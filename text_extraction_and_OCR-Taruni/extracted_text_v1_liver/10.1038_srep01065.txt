Although liver fibrosis reflects disease severity in chronic hepatitis patients, there has been no simple and
accurate system to evaluate the therapeutic effect based on fibrosis. We developed a glycan-based
immunoassay, FastLec-Hepa, to fill this unmet need. FastLec-Hepa automatically detects unique
fibrosis-related glyco-alteration in serum hyperglycosylated Mac-2 binding protein within 20 min. The
serum FastLec-Hepa counts increased with advancing fibrosis and illustrated significant differences in
medians between all fibrosis stages. FastLec-Hepa is sufficiently sensitive and quantitative to evaluate the
effects of PEG-interferon-a/ribavirin therapy in a short post-therapeutic interval. The obtained fibrosis
progression is equivalent to -0.30 stages/year in patients with sustained virological response, and 0.01
stages/year in relapse/nonresponders. Furthermore, long-term follow-up of the severely affected patients
found hepatocellular carcinoma developed in patients after therapy whose FastLec-Hepa counts remained
above a designated cutoff value. FastLec-Hepa is the only assay currently available for clinically beneficial
therapy evaluation through quantitation of disease severity.
T
he World Health Organization has estimated that the prevalence of chronic infections with hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more than 5% of the world population. The high rate of viral
transmission worldwide has also resulted in an explosive increase in incidence of liver cirrhosis (LC),
because liver fibrosis caused by the persistent infections with HBV and HCV irreversibly progresses in chronic
hepatitis (CH) patients without effective treatment. As the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
increases proportionally to the severity of hepatitis and the presence of LC, it is now clear that about 90% of
HCC cases originate from infection with HBV or HCV. It is estimated that more than one million patients
worldwide die from liver disease related to HBV or HCV infection each year. Immunomodulatory therapy with
PEG-interferon-a and ribavirin is the standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC)1
. Recent
genome-wide association studies have revealed that variation in the host interleukin-28B gene can predict the
outcome of therapies for viral clearance2–4. Such pharmacokinetic understanding should allow for more precise
treatment protocols and follow-up analyses to optimize the opportunity for patients to achieve sustained virological response (SVR)5,6. Linear peptidomimetic HCV and NS3/4A serine protease inhibitors such as telaprevir
and boceprevir are new drugs that, in combination with PEG-interferon-a and ribavirin, substantially improve
the rates of response among patients with HCV genotype 1 infection1
. Alternatively, suppression of hepatic
decompensation in chronic hepatitis B patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis has been evaluated during
long-term treatment with antiviral agents, such as adefovir, lamivudine, entecavir, and tenofovir7
. For example,
cumulative entecavir therapy (for at least 3 years) resulted in substantial histological improvement and regression
of fibrosis or cirrhosis8
.
The efficacy of therapy is currently evaluated by frequent monitoring of ‘‘viral load’’ or ‘‘liver injury’’5
. From the
viewpoint of developing preventive strategies for HCC, the risk of HCC development should also be estimated
along with them. For this purpose, liver biopsy is generally considered as the gold standard in which fibrosis is
subclassified into 5 stages of severity (F0–4). However, this procedure is invasive and shown to cause a high rate of
sampling error (about 15% false-negatives for cirrhosis) in patients with diffuse parenchymal liver diseases.

Furthermore, in a retrospective cohort study9
, the rate of fibrosis
progression was estimated at about 20.28 stages/year in patients
with SVR and 0.02 stages/year in patients with nonsustained virological response (NVR). This indicates that the biopsy is not suitable
for evaluating the effect of therapy after a short interval. The procedure has further disadvantages such as inaccuracy, biopsy-related
complications, the need for hospitalization, the time involved, and
low cost-effectiveness10. Therefore, alternative noninvasive assays are
desired and should provide a quantifiable readout of fibrosis progression using a method that is accurate, cost-effective and relatively
simple.
To date, several methods have been developed10 including
FibroScan, which measures hepatic fibrosis biomechanically as tissue
stiffness based on transient elastography. FibroScan has the advantages of being rapid and technically simple; however, its diagnostic
success rate is affected by operator skill. Therefore, it has been suggested that FibroScan, in conjunction with assay of serum fibrosis
biomarkers, should improve diagnostic accuracy. FibroTest11 and
FibroMeter12, believed to be the most reliable indices of fibrosis, have
been used in the combination assay aiming to eliminate the need
for liver biopsy13,14. However, FibroTest and FibroMeter do not
complement FibroScan in the development of a rapid ‘‘on-site
diagnosis’’ system. This is because each requires both extensive
and specialized blood analyses (FibroTest requires a2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin, c-glutamyltransferase and total
bilirubin whereas FibroMeter requires platelet count, prothrombin
index, AST, a2-macroglobulin, hyaluronic acid and urea). In addition, both tests require data on age, and also sex for FibroTest.
Glycans are referred to as the face of cells, which reflect their status
such as differentiation stage rather than their state of damage, and
therefore they can be great markers for chronic disease. In the case of
hepatitis, glycans are considered to reflect more specifically the progression of fibrosis than viral load. In the search for a simple and
rapid method that is not markedly affected by tissue inflammation
and ALT fluctuation, the possibility of glycomic and glycoproteomic
techniques has emerged15,16, and there are reports of some successful
examples applicable for use in the clinical laboratories17–19. However,
the current glycomic techniques require at least 3 hours of sample
preparation for analysis and this has markedly reduced the combination use of glycan-based immunoassays with FibroScan. In this
report, we describe for the first time, a rapid and simple glycan-based
immunoassay, FastLec-Hepa, that can quantify fibrosis as precisely
as FibroTest and also readily evaluate the antifibrotic effects of
therapy at the clinical site (Supplementary Fig. 1). Moreover, we
introduce a novel method for rational selection of the ‘‘nonfucose binding type’’ lectins and provide details of how this concept
can be adopted for future development of clinically useful glycodiagnostic tools.
Results
Changes in the N-glycosylation of M2BP during progression of
liver disease. Based on previous reports20–23, we adopted the serum
90 K/Mac-2 binding protein (M2BP) as a glycoprotein biomarker
for liver fibrosis. M2BP is secreted from many cell types, including
hepatocytes (http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000108679), and
it has been shown to modulate many processes, particularly those
related to cell adhesion. For example, the interaction of M2BP with
matrix fibronectin can modulate adhesion and the high expression of
M2BP by tumor cells increases the level in the circulation of affected
patients. A prominent feature of native human M2BP is its
oligomerization to large ring structures20, resembling a ‘‘sugarpowdered doughnut’’ which is potentially covered with 70–112
N-glycans (Fig. 1a). To confirm serum M2BP as a valid marker,
we performed a pull-down assay with serum (2 ml each) from five
individuals in each of the following groups: HCC, LC, CHC or
healthy volunteer with normal liver (HV). Although two bands
appeared in all HVs and two CHC patients, M2BPs from patients
with relatively severe fibrosis, i.e., LC and HCC, migrated as a single
band, the mobility of which was similar to that of the lower band for
HVs (Fig. 1b). Significant increases in band intensity with excessive
smearing of the bands were seen for most HCC patients. A
subsequent investigation of 125 HCV patients with stagedetermined fibrosis showed alteration in the quality and quantity
of M2BP during the progression of fibrosis (Fig. 1c) and apparent
alteration in the amount of each band (Fig. 1d and e), as described in
the previous investigations22,23. M2BP has been shown to have
multibranching and sialylated N-glycans. Moreover, it has been
suggested that extension of polylactosamine on M2BP controls its
binding to galectin-3, a major binding partner in vivo. Sialylation
and extension of polylactosamine affect the charge and size of M2BP
and this results in altered electrophoretic migration. Accordingly,
we speculate that the size heterogeneity of M2BP seen on
electrophoresis is due to such alterations in glycosylation. In fact,
the difference in the band migration was eliminated by Sialidase
A treatment, and the smearing of the bands in HCC was reduced
by treatment with N-Glycosidase F (Supplementary Fig. 2). These
results indicated that the altered quality of M2BP during progression
of liver disease was due to changes in N-glycosylation.
Selection of the optimal lectin for direct measurement of diseaserelated M2BP. To construct a reliable assay (see Supplementary
Fig. 3), we needed to identify a lectin probe that could most
readily discriminate the altered N-glycans of M2BP and specifically
binds to them in serum without pretreatment. For this purpose, we
added a subtraction process to our recently described microarraybased selection strategy16 (Supplementary Fig. 4). In brief, we first
obtained a typical glycan profile for serum M2BPs by averaging the
glycan profiles of M2BPs immunoprecipitated from 125 HCV
patient sera by the antibody-overlay lectin microarray16,18,24 (step
1). In this step, we selected 27 lectins binding to M2BP from a 45-
lectin array (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Most of them bound not only
to M2BP (ca. 10 mg/ml in serum), but also to other abundant serum
glycoproteins, whereas some suggested rather specific binding to
M2BP. We designated them as high-noise lectins or high signal-tonoise (S/N) lectins, respectively (Fig. 2a). We then selected the
candidate lectins for the assay by subtracting the high-noise lectins
from the M2BP-binding lectins (step 2), using a glycan profile of
whole serum (Supplementary Fig. 5)
25. Comparing the profiles for
M2BP and whole serum (Fig. 2b), we quickly identified 6 lectins with
a high S/N ratio. Interestingly, all lectins identifying fucose
modification, which is the most well-known glyco-alteration in
liver disease (Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA), Lens culinaris
agglutinin (LCA), Aspergillus oryzae lectin (AOL), and Aleuria
aurantia lectin (AAL)), were high-noise lectins (Fig. 2b). After
subtraction, we used both the Mann–Whitney U test as a
nonparametric test, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis, to characterize the diagnostic accuracy of the candidate
lectins at each stage of fibrosis: significant fibrosis (F2/F3/F4),
severe fibrosis (F3/F4) and cirrhosis (F4) (step 3). As a result, we
found that the diagnostic score of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin
(WFA) was superior to the other 5 lectins at every fibrosis stage
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6).
‘‘Proof-of-concept’’ experiment for direct quantitation of the
serum WFA-binding M2BP by sandwich immunoassay. We
quantitatively analyzed the WFA-binding M2BPs (WFA1-M2BP)
in serum. Sera, pretreated as described in the Methods, were firstly
subjected to affinity capture with 20 ml slurry of WFA-coated agarose
gel. The eluted fraction was immunoprecipitated with a capturing
antibody against M2BP and the product was analyzed by Western
blot. The intensity of the ‘‘smearing-band’’ signal for WFA1-M2BP
gradually increased in proportion to the severity of liver fibrosis
(Supplementary Fig. 7), as indicated by the red line shown in
www.nature.com/scientificreports
SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 1065 | DOI: 10.1038/srep01065 2

Fig. 1e. We next conducted a sandwich immunoassay with WFA
and anti-M2BP antibody (see Supplementary Fig. 3b). WFA was
immobilized on the surface of a 96-well microtiter plate through
biotin–streptavidin interaction. We performed the first assay for
the WFA-binding activity using recombinant human M2BP
(rhM2BP). As a result, a linear regression analysis revealed a linear
range of detection from 0.039 to 0.625 mg/ml (Supplementary Fig. 8a).
Subsequently, we used culture supernatant of a hepatoblastoma cell line
HepG2, which expresses WFA1-M2BP, to illustrate the dosedependency of the interaction of WFA with M2BP/HepG2. We also
showed that heat treatment of the culture supernatant eliminated this
binding activity (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Finally, we performed a
sandwich immunoassay for direct measurement of WFA1-M2BP in
untreated serum samples, and the results correlated well with the
quantitative assay using affinity capture and lectin microarray
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 and 9).
FastLec-Hepa: a fully automated sandwich immunoassay for
direct quantitation of serum WFA1-M2BP. We adapted the
WFA-antibody immunoassay to the HISCL-2000i bedside clinical
chemistry analyzer18. We successfully adjusted every reaction
condition during the automatic assay by HISCL, which is about a
17-min manipulation. Heat pretreatment of the serum was avoided
to ensure both binding avidity and the fast association rate.
Repeatability was assessed by performing 10 independent assays of
three samples, and the coefficient of variation ranged between 2.1%
and 2.5% (data not shown). Sensitivity was determined by triplicate
assays of samples generated by 2-fold serial dilution of 50 mg/ml
rhM2BP. The linear regression analysis identified a linear range of
detection (R2 5 1.00) from 0.025 to 12.5 mg/ml (Fig. 3a, a range of
0.025 to 1.6 mg/ml also shown in Fig. 3b). The resulting dynamic
range was 25-fold that of the manual sandwich immunoassay
described above. We next examined whether the HISCL
measurements made on serum from HCV patients (n 5 125) were
consistent with lectin microarray analysis, and this comparison
resulted in sufficient linearity with coefficient of determination,
R2 5 0.848 (Fig. 3c). Accordingly, we could perform automatic
quantitation of serum WFA1-M2BP in 180 patients in 1 hour and
we have therefore named it FastLec-Hepa.
Validation of FastLec-Hepa. For a validation study, we obtained
serum from CH patients at two locations: Nagoya City University
Hospital and Hokkaido University Hospital (Supplementary
Fig. 10). Staging of these patients (n 5 209) by histological activity
index (HAI) was conducted independently by two senior pathologists
on ultrasonography-guided liver biopsy samples. F0–F1 was assigned
in 82 cases (39.2%), F2 in 52 (24.9%), F3 in 40 (19.1%), and F4
(cirrhosis) in 35 (16.7%). Serum from healthy volunteers (with no
history of any hepatitis virus infections) was obtained for analysis
from two sites (n 5 48 from National Institute of Advanced
Industrial Science and Technology [AIST]: HV1; n 5 70 from
Nagoya City University: HV2). Their FastLec-Hepa counts

(Supplementary Table 1) are also plotted in a box-whisker diagram in
Supplementary Fig. 11 along with that from a separate group of 1,000
healthy volunteers (HV3). Based on the calibration curve ([FastLecHepa counts]/106 5 1.027 3 [rhM2BP] 1 0.006 in Fig. 3a, b), the 75th
percentiles of HVs of 64,205–107,617 and the 25th percentile of LC of
1,327,596 patients (see also Supplementary Fig. 11), we estimate the
concentration of WFA1-M2BP to be approximately 0.09 mg/ml in the
serum of HV patients and . 1.0 mg/ml in that of LC patients. This
means that the linear range shown in Fig. 3a is sufficient for accurate
quantitation of WFA1-M2BP in all serum samples. The analyses
showed a gradual increase with the progression of liver fibrosis, but
it did not correlate with the grade of hepatic activity defined by HAI
scoring (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Next, we made a statistical comparison of FastLec-Hepa with
other simple tests for liver fibrosis: the direct fibrosis marker hyaluronic acid (HA), the indirect fibrosis index FIB-426 and the glycanbased fibrosis index LecT-Hepa18,27. We enrolled 160 patients
(F02F1 5 66, F2 5 41, F3 5 33 and F4 5 20) whose age, platelet
count, AST, ALT and HA levels were readily available
(Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). As
shown in Fig. 4a, the results of all the tests correlated well with the
stage of fibrosis (P , 0.0001). However, an ROC analysis concluded
that FastLec-Hepa detected cirrhosis with the highest diagnostic
accuracy (Fig. 4b and Table 1). Notably, FastLec-Hepa distinguished
between F3 and F4 with 90% sensitivity, 85% specificity, and with an
AUC of 0.91. These results were superior to LecT-Hepa (sensitivity:
Figure 2 | Selection of the optimal lectin for the lectin-antibody sandwich immunoassay. (a) The kinetics of lectins binding to serum glycoproteins. The
M2BP-binding lectins are divided into two categories: high-noise lectins and high signal-to-noise (S/N) lectins. The high-noise lectins bind to both
M2BPs and abundant serum glycoproteins, causing a strong suppression of the M2BP–lectin interaction (see top panel). On the other hand, the number of
binding targets in serum for the high S/N lectins is negligible, resulting in the specific interaction with the target M2BP (see lower panel). (b) Classification
of M2BP-binding lectins. The high S/N lectins are those detecting M2BPs with at least twice the signal intensity seen for other serum glycoproteins. The
classification strategy is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 4. (c) Diagnostic performance of 6 candidate lectins. P-values were determined using the

95%, specificity: 70%, and AUC: 0.87), FIB-4 (sensitivity: 55%, specificity: 94%, and AUC: 0.76), and HA (sensitivity: 80%, specificity:
70%, and AUC: 0.78).
Clinical utility of FastLec-Hepa: quantitative monitoring of
antiviral therapy. To assess clinical utility, we examined two types
of trials—short-interval evaluation and long-term follow-up—both
of which are essential for following the patients receiving PEGinterferon-a and ribavirin therapy. For the first trial, we enrolled
41 patients with CHC who had previously undergone 48 weeks
of therapy at Hokkaido University Hospital. According to the
definition described in the Methods, 26 and 15 of them were
judged as SVR and NVR/relapse (non-SVR), respectively. For each
patient, we performed FastLec-Hepa on serum samples, which were
collected just before treatment (Pre) and within a short period (12–
22 weeks) after treatment (Post) (Fig. 5a). We found a marked
decrease from Pre to Post counts (P 5 0.0061) in SVR patients,
but no apparent change for non-SVR patients (P 5 0.9780)
(Fig. 5b). Specifically, a median percent decrease of 31% was found
for SVR patients (median Pre-count of 161,053 and median Postcount of 110,739), while the level for non-SVR patients was
essentially constant. These results show that the assay can evaluate
the effect of therapy within a short period after treatment. This is an
important advance, because the ALT levels of non-SVR, as well as
SVR, are mostly decreased into the range of 10–64 IU/ml during this
period (Fig. 5c)
5
. In fact, changes in the FastLec-Hepa counts did not
correlate with those in the ALT counts (Supplementary Fig. 13),
thereby invalidating ALT-dependent fibrosis assays, including
FIB-4 (Fig. 5d).
In support of our finding that the FastLec-Hepa counts correlate
excellently with the stage of fibrosis, we found a strong correlation
between the histopathological scores and the median of the
log10[FastLec-Hepa] counts (Fig. 5e). These correlations were
approximated to two linear equations: y 5 0.23x 1 4.9 for F0 to
F3, and y 5 0.58x 1 3.8 for F3 to F4 histology. This means that
FastLec-Hepa can reliably reproduce the assessment of therapeutic
effects, which were previously drawn from histopathological scoring9
. Indeed, the median changes in fibrosis obtained by FastLecHepa analysis were about 20.295 stages/year for SVR and
0.010 stages/year for non-SVR (Fig. 5f). These data were consistent
with the rate of fibrosis progression and regression determined by
Shiratori et al9
.
For the second trial, we enrolled 6 HCV patients (SVR 5 3 and
non-SVR 5 3) with advanced fibrosis who completed 48 weeks of
therapy at Nagoya City University Hospital. Sera were collected
before therapy and at 0, 1, 3, and 5 years after the end of therapy
(see Fig. 5g). FastLec-Hepa counts in SVR patients gradually
decreased and reached below the median of F0 patients within
3 years. However, those in non-SVR patients remained above the
median for F3 patients during the follow-up period (Fig. 5h).

Interestingly, HCC had developed in two non-SVR patients whose
FastLec-Hepa counts remained above the median of F4 patients
throughout. Other fibrosis indices, such as FIB-4 and biochemical
parameters (ALT and AST), did not distinguish between SVR and
non-SVR or appear to predict this occurrence (Fig. 5i-k).
Discussion
We have described the development and use of a fully automated,
glycan-based immunoassay termed FastLec-Hepa, for the evaluation
of liver fibrosis. A high degree of reliability in the quantitative aspects
of this method should establish it as a clinically significant test,

particularly for revealing and managing patients at a high risk of
progression to liver complications such as HCC and related lifethreatening events. The most striking advantage of FastLec-Hepa is
not only its simplicity but also its capacity to provide fibrosis readouts that are not influenced by fluctuations in the ALT value or
inflammation, both of which can cause falsely high estimates in most
of the other fibrosis tests available10. In fact, our study has illustrated
robust capacity of FastLec-Hepa to evaluate the effects of antiviral
therapy and subsequent disease progression in both the short and
long term.
Many retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated
that achieving SVR through the PEG-interferon-a/ribavirin treatment significantly reduces liver-related morbidity and mortality
(i.e., hepatic decompensation, HCC, and liver-related death)28–30.
As this combination therapy is effective in only about 50% of patients
with HCV genotype 1, new agents1 and targets31 for antiviral treatments of HCV have been developed to achieve SVR more effectively
after the therapy. Long-term follow-ups often show that the risk
of disease progression is significantly high in patients with nonSVR after PEG-interferon-a/ribavirin treatment. Furthermore, the
development of HCC in patients with SVR remains at a significant
cumulative rate (2%)28,30,32,33. For these reasons, a new data-mining
model using individual factors (age, platelet count, serum albumin
and AST) was developed recently to identify patients at a high risk of
HCC development34. This is, however, a statistical procedure for
estimating the chance of disease progression, and there is not a direct
evaluation of fibrosis. In the present report, we performed a longterm retrospective study with serially collected sera from SVR and
non-SVR patients, in which we showed the potential use of FastLecHepa for improved prognostic accuracy. Indeed, recent advances in
the development of antifibrotic agents lead us to expect the therapeutic elimination of health risks associated with HCC and decompensation35. Moreover, we expect that FastLec-Hepa will be proved
for its usefulness in rapid evaluation of progression and regression
of fibrosis in clinical trials of newly developed antifibrotic agents.
Hence, FastLec-Hepa should be very useful for fibrosis stage screening and evaluation of disease progression in untreated individuals or
patients under or after treatment, as well as evaluation of the most
recently developed drugs.
It is important to note that FastLec-Hepa has many merits, including speed (possibly 1,000 assays per day) and full automation for
measurement of a serological glycobiomarker: these attributes will
enable retrospective studies with valuable serum specimens that have
been collected previously. In addition, our recently developed calibrator for FastLec-Hepa will improve traceability and enable simultaneous assay and data storage in multiple diagnostic facilities. The
data obtained with diluted serum samples demonstrated a high level
of assay reproducibility and a very favorable linear detection range
(Supplementary Fig. 14). Furthermore, we found an excellent agreement between assay values for serum and plasma prepared simultaneously from the same patient. Presently, we have about 10,000 sera
and plasma available with detailed clinical notes collected in more
than 10 facilities in Japan, and a series of retrospective studies is
under way. We will shortly conclude licensing of our system for
clinical implementation, based largely on the trials of the present
study. In contrast to this, the majority of recent noninvasive techniques are currently shifting to physical measurements such as
FibroScan, acoustic radiation force impulse36 and real-time strain
elastography37. Any on-site assay of large numbers of blood samples
should provide a diagnostic value comparable to that of FibroTest,
and a direct comparison in the same patient group will be necessary
to evaluate this. We note here that according to a recent statistical
validation method38, predicted AUC of the diagnostic value of
FibroTest for detection of advanced fibrosis in our sample set
(DANA score 5 1.81) was approximately 0.77, which was comparable to the AUC of FastLec-Hepa we obtained (0.79).
FastLec-Hepa has adopted a new paradigm for clinical diagnosis,
‘‘glyco-diagnosis’’, which is based on the quantity and quality of
protein glycosylation patterns that well indicate disease progression.
To detect such changes in glycosylation by conventional methods
(e.g., mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, or capillary electrophoresis), it is absolutely necessary to liberate the glycans of
interest from their protein linkages15,17,39. It is possible to employ
an alternative technology, which is based on a lectin–antibody sandwich immunodetection system for intact glycoproteins bearing disease-specific glyco-alterations. Such assays have been used to detect
changes in fucosylation of N-linked glycans, which are associated
with liver disease. However, in the present study, fucose-binding
lectins were classified as ‘‘high noise’’ (Fig. 2b), and thus an enrichment of the target protein was the essential process in the assay.
Lectin-overlay detection is performed typically after on-plate enrichment of the target glycoproteins by an immobilized antibody. In such
cases, detection relies on a low avidity (high dissociation rate)
between the captured glycoprotein and the overlaid lectin probe
(see right of Supplementary Fig. 3b). These kinetic considerations
essentially eliminate the use of an automated bedside clinical chemistry analyzer. Even though a fucose-binding lectin was immobilized
on the beads (see left of Supplementary Fig. 3b), it still remains a
problem for reliable quantitation by autoanalyzer. Our previous system LecT-Hepa16,18,19,26, which detects the level of fucosylated a1-acid
glycoprotein, requires enrichment of the protein prior to the assay.
In the present study, we have developed a strategy to overcome
these problems in glyco-diagnosis associated with clinical implementation, and realized a rapid ‘‘on-site diagnosis’’ system
(17 min, within the minimum time required for single assay by
HISCL), based on analysis of a glycomarker (Supplementary
Fig. 1). The strategy for selecting the most robust lectin led us to
WFA, and away from the use of fucose-binding lectins, for the direct
measurement system (Fig. 2). The diagnostic utility of M2BP, a
protein resembling ‘‘sweet-doughnut’’20, brought a favorable density
and orientation of the disease-related glycan on the homomultimer.
These characteristic structures resulted in a major increase in the
avidity of M2BP for the plated WFA. The resulting glycan–lectin
interaction, which is remarkably strong and specific, made it possible
to develop the rapid and highly sensitive assay (see left of
Supplementary Fig. 3b). We believe that this unique strategy will
revolutionize the use of glyco-diagnosis in clinical medicine and
potentially provide a framework for the development of a new generation of biomarker assays.
Methods
Patient samples, biochemical parameters and indices. Patients with chronic
hepatitis were enrolled at Nagoya City University Hospital and Hokkaido University
Hospital. Healthy volunteers as the controls were randomly selected in Nagoya City
University Hospital (70 individuals) and AIST (48 individuals). The institutional
ethics committees at Nagoya City University Hospital, Hokkaido University Hospital,
and AIST approved this study, and informed consent for the use of their clinical
specimens was obtained from all participants before the collection. In addition, we
used 1,000 serum samples from virus-negative Caucasians as the normal population,
which were purchased from Complex Antibodies Inc. (Fort Lauderdale, FL) and
collected under IRB-approved collection protocols. Fibrosis was graded in the
patients according to the histological activity index (HAI) using biopsy or surgical
specimens. Biopsy specimens were classified as follows: F0, no fibrosis; F1, portal
fibrosis without septa; F2, few septa; F3, numerous septa without cirrhosis; and F4,
cirrhosis. The three diagnostic targets in this study were defined as significant fibrosis:
F21F31F4; severe fibrosis: F31F4; and cirrhosis: F4. Hepatic inflammation was also
assessed according to the HAI, as follows: A0, no activity; A1, mild activity; A2,
moderate activity; and A3, severe activity. Cirrhosis was confirmed by
ultrasonography (coarse liver architecture, nodular liver surface, and blunt liver
edges), evidence of hypersplenism (splenomegaly on ultrasonography) and/or a
platelet count of , 100,000/mm3
. Virological responses during PEG-interferon-a
and ribavirin therapy were defined as follows5
: SVR, absence of HCV RNA from
serum 24 weeks following discontinuation of therapy; nonresponder, failure to clear
HCV RNA from serum after 24 weeks of therapy; relapse, reappearance of HCV RNA
in serum after therapy was discontinued. For all patients, age and sex were recorded
and serum levels of the following were analyzed: aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), c-glutamyltransferase (GGT), total bilirubin,

albumin, cholinesterase, total cholesterol, platelet count (PLT), hyaluronic acid (HA).
The FIB-4 index was calculated as follows: [age (years) 3 AST (U/L)]/[platelets
(109
/L) 3 ALT (U/L)1/2]
26. Fibrosis-specific glyco-alteration of a1-acid glycoprotein
was determined by lectin–antibody sandwich immunoassays with a combination of
three lectins (Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA), Maackia amurensis
leukoagglutinin (MAL), and Aspergillus oryzae lectin (AOL))16. All assays used an
automated chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay system (HISCL-2000i; Sysmex
Co., Kobe, Japan)18.
Enrichment of M2BP from serum. An automated protein purification system
(ED-01; GP BioSciences Ltd., Yokohama, Japan) was used to immunoprecipitate
M2BP from serum specimens. In brief, sera (2 ml) were diluted 10-fold with PBS/
0.2%(w/v) SDS, heated at 95uC for 20 min, mixed with 10 ml of Triton X-100 in TBS
(TBSTx) and injected into a 96-well SUMILON microtiter plate (Sumitomo Bakelite
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The plate and working reagents, including biotinylated antiM2BP antibody (10 ng/ml), streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, washing buffer (1%
TBSTx) and elution buffer (TBS containing 0.2% SDS), were loaded into the system.
This generated 110 ml of purified M2BPs per serum sample (96 samples in 3.5 h).
Western blot analysis. Anti-human M2BP polyclonal antibody was purchased from
R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) and biotinylated with Biotin Labeling
Kit – NH2 (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Purified serum M2BPs were
electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 5–20% polyacrylamide gels (DRC,
Tokyo, Japan) and transferred to PVDF membranes. After treatment with Block AceH
(DS Pharma Biomedical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), the membranes were incubated with
biotinylated anti-M2BP polyclonal antibody, and then with alkaline phosphataseconjugated streptavidin (1/5000 diluted with TBST; ProZyme, Inc., San Leandro,
CA). The membranes were incubated with Western Blue stabilized substrate for
alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI).
Lectin microarray analysis. Enriched M2BPs were analyzed with an antibodyoverlay lectin microarray24. Purified protein (14 ml) was diluted to 60 ml with PBS
containing 1%(v/v) Triton X-100 (PBSTx); this was applied to a LecChipTM (GP
BioSciences Ltd.), which included three spots of 45 lectins in each of seven reaction
wells. After incubation for 12 h at 20uC, 2 ml of human serum IgG (10 mg/ml) was
added to the reaction solution on each chip and incubated for 30 min. The reaction
solution was then discarded, and the chip was washed three times with PBSTx.
Subsequently, 60 ml (200 ng) of biotinylated anti-human M2BP in PBSTx was
applied to the chip, and incubated for 1 h. After three washes with PBSTx, 60 ml
(400 ng) of a Cy3-labeled streptavidin (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK)
solution in PBSTx was added and incubated for 30 min. The chip was rinsed with
PBSTx, scanned with an evanescent-field fluorescence scanner (GlycoStationTM
Reader1200; GP BioSciences Ltd.) and analyzed with the Array Pro Analyzer software
package, version 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD). The chip was scanned
with the gain set to register a maximum net intensity , 40,000 for the most intense
spots. The net intensity value for each spot was calculated by subtracting the
background value from the signal intensity value. The relative intensity of
lectin-positive samples was determined from the ratio of their fluorescence to the
fluorescence of the internal-standard lectin, DSA.
Quantitation of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-binding M2BP. Serum was
pretreated as described above under enrichment of M2BP from serum. Pretreated
samples (50 ml) were diluted with an equal volume of starting buffer (0.1%(w/v) SDS
in PBSTx), added to the WFA-coated agarose in a microtube (20 ml slurry; Vector
Lab., Burlingame, UK), and incubated at 4uC for 5 h with gentle shaking. After
centrifugation of the reaction solution at 2000 3 g for 10 min, the supernatant was
removed to a new microtube. The precipitate was suspended in 50 ml of the starting
buffer, recentrifuged and this second supernatant combined with the first (designated
as path-through fraction T). The precipitate was then washed with 200 ml of the
starting buffer and the bound glycoproteins were eluted with 60 ml of 200 mM
galactosamine/0.02%(w/v) SDS in PBS (designated as elution fraction E). M2BP was
immunoprecipitated from fractions T and E and examined by electrophoresis under
reducing conditions on 5–20% gradient SDS–polyacrylamide gels.
WFA-antibody sandwich ELISA. Flat-bottomed 96-well streptavidin-precoated
microtiter plates (Nunc, Int., Tokyo, Japan) were treated with biotinylated WFA
(Vector, 250 ng/well) for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were incubated with
the diluted serum samples (50 ml) in PBS containing 0.1%(v/v) Tween20 (PBS-t) for
2 h at room temperature and then with 50 ng/well of the anti-human M2BP
polyclonal antibody, in PBS-t for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed
extensively and then incubated with 50 ml of horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.,
Philadelphia, PA) at 1:10,000 in PBS-t for 1 h at room temperature. The substrate
3,39,5,59-tetramethylbenzidine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fremont, CA) solution
(100 ml) was added to each well. The enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 100 ml
of 1 M sulfuric acid, and the optical density measured at 450 nm.
WFA-antibody sandwich immunoassay by HISCL. The fibrosis-specific form of
glycosylated M2BP was measured based on a sandwich immunoassay approach.
Glycosylated M2BP was captured by WFA immobilized on magnetic beads, and the
bound product was assayed with an anti-human M2BP monoclonal antibody linked
to alkaline phosphatase (ALP-aM2BP). Two reagent packs (M2BP-WFA detection
pack and a chemiluminescence substrate pack) were loaded in the HISCL. The
detection pack comprised three reagents: a reaction buffer solution (R1), a
WFA-coated magnetic beads solution (R2) and an ALP-aM2BP solution (R3). The
chemiluminescence substrate reagent pack contained a CDP-Star substrate solution
(R4) and a stopping solution (R5). Typically, serum (10 ml) was diluted to 60 ml with
R1 and then mixed with R2 (30 ml). After the binding reaction, R3 (100 ml) was added
to the reaction solution. The resultant conjugates were magnetically separated from
unbound components, and mixed well with R4 (50 ml) and R5 (100 ml) before reading
of the fluorescence. The chemiluminescent intensity was acquired within a period of
17 min in the operation described above. The reaction chamber was kept at 42uC
throughout.
Statistics. Statistical analyses and graph preparation used Dr. SPSS II Windows
software (SPSS Co., Tokyo, Japan), GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA), and Windows Excel 2007. This facilitated selection of the optimal lectin for
analysis of fibrosis and a comparison of the diagnostic value of other serological
fibrosis markers and indices. Because the data distribution for each parameter was
non-Gaussian, the P-values were determined by nonparametric tests, such as the
Mann–Whitney Utest and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations with liver fibrosis
were estimated as the significance of differences among the staging groups (F0–1, F2,
F3, and F4) determined by Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric one-way analysis of
variance. To assess classification efficiencies for detecting significant fibrosis, severe
fibrosis and cirrhosis, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was
also carried out to determine the area under the curve (AUC) values. Cutoff values
obtained from Youden’s index were used to classify patients. Diagnostic accuracy was
expressed in terms of specificity, sensitivity and AUC.
