Abstract
Guarding behavior is an important activity in sub-social insects, and this behavior is believed to improve the survival of
offspring. Sclerodermus harmandi (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) is one of most powerful epizoic parasitoid wasps, and it
parasitizes Monochamus alternatus, a borer of wood and also the primary vector of the pinewood nematode
Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. After laying eggs, S. harmandi exhibits sub-social behavior involving the female tending the
clutch of eggs until emergence (guarding behavior). In this study, the benefits of this maternal care with regard to
improvements in the survival of offspring were examined. During the developmental stages, only offspring in the egg and
larval stages were sensitive to guarding behavior. A positive relationship between the survival of the offspring and the
duration of guarding was detected with logistic regression analysis. A female replacement experiment demonstrated that
multiparous S. harmandi stepmothers showed guarding behavior and that this behavior improved the survival of the
immature offspring, whereas nulliparous stepmothers failed to exhibit the guarding behavior. These results indicate that S.
harmandi females display maternal care and that this behavior improves the survival of offspring.

Introduction
Maternal care, which is typically defined as any post-ovipositional behavior that promotes the survival, growth, and development of offspring [1], is considered a hallmark of sub-sociality in
insects [2–5]. According to the behavioral form, maternal care is
classified into three groups [1,6]: behaviors that protect offspring
from natural enemies (predators, parasitoids, and microorganisms)
[7], behaviors that provide/protect resources needed by the
offspring [8], and behaviors that improve resources and/or
facilitate resource acquisition (e.g., feeding) by offspring [9].
Among the three behavior forms, predators and parasitoids usually
serve as the primary agents that lead to maternal care in insects
[10]. Maternal care of offspring is age-specific and greatly
improves offspring survival [11,12]. Additionally, food provision
is also considered an important form of maternal care [13].
Forficula auricularia, a species of earwig, provides food via
mouthpart-to-mouthpart contact [14]. Anisolabis maritime (Dermaptera: Anisolabididae). improves the survival of its nymphs by
collecting turtle food pellets even when long distances from the
food resource [13].
Parental care behavior has evolved independently in at least 13
orders and at least 45 families of insects [1,15]. Most social insect
species and a relatively large family of Hemiptera display parental
care [11,16]. However, maternal care is unusual amongst parasitic
wasps. Few studies have addressed the behavior of female wasps.
In a bethylid wasp, Goniozus nephantidis, female wasps remain with
offspring until pupation to protect the offspring from superparasitism, multiparasitism and conspecific intruders [17].
Sclerodermus harmandi (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) is one of the
most powerful epizoic parasitoid wasps against the larvae and
pupae of Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a
borer of wood and also the primary vector of the pinewood
nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus in Japan and China [18]. The
rate of dead trees which was caused by pine nematode reduced
98.0% after release of wasps in the tested field [19]. Some studies
have examined the host preferences [20,21], development [22],
biological control efficiency against different pests [23], and
ultrastructure of antennae and embryos [24–25] of S. harmandi. But
the adaptive significance of maternal behavior in this species is not
well studied.
Here, we present our studies on the maternal care by S.
harmandi. We addressed the following questions: (1) Was the
survival of offspring improved by maternal care? (2) Which
developmental stage (egg, larva, or cocoon) was sensitive to
maternal care? (3) Does the guarding duration affect the survival of
offspring? (4) Can replaced females, including multiparous and
nulliparous stepmothers, improve the survival of the offspring?
Results
Behavioral observations
Upon finding that the hosts were suitable for oviposition, the
female S. harmandi stung the host and injected venom with her
ovipositor on the intersegmental membrane of the host abdomen,
paralyzing the struggling host. When attacked, hosts rolled their
bodies, which indicated that female were stinging the hosts and

injecting venom. The female then cleaned the surface of the host
to provide a habitable environment for her offspring. The female
parasitoids laid a clutch of eggs onto the host surface. After a short
rest, the female visited each of the eggs and patted them with its
antennae gently and continuously. Moreover, the females also
touched their offspring with their mouthparts and mandibles. If
the eggs left the host surface, the mother clasped them with her
mandibles and replaced them. During the larval stage, the female
wasp bit off the epidermis in the intersegmental membrane of the
hosts, resulting in some lacunae at the host surface. The larvae
extended their heads into the lacunae to absorb the host
haemolymph. The female parasitoids patted the offspring continuously with their antennae throughout the larval stage. When
larvae overlapped, the female parasitoid clasped the overlapped
larvae with its mandibles and dispersed them. If a larva died and
became melanotic, the female parasitoid wasp kept it far from both
the healthy larvae and the host. During the cocoon stage, the
mothers still patrolled the cocoons and patted their offspring
continuously. Males emerged as adults 1 or 2 days prior to females.
The young male chewed a hole in the female cocoons to facilitate
the emergence of the female pupae and then mated with the
emerged females.
1. Female egg laying rate and egg mortality
The period of laying eggs for the female S. harmandi was
relatively concentrated in the first 2 days (Figure 1). The number
of eggs laid differed significantly with days since oviposition
(Figure 1. ANOVA: F5,36= 186.417, P,0.001), and did not
increase significantly after 2 days (Figure 1). The results showed
that during the ovipositing stage, the first 2 days were the key
period for female S. harmandi to lay eggs (figure 1). After 3 days
from ovipositing, some eggs began to die (Figure 2. ANOVA:
F7,48= 3.367, P = 0.005).
2. Maternal care and offspring survival
Survival of offspring in the whole-stage guarding group (Table 1,
group 5) was significantly higher than that in the non-guarding
group (Table 1, group 1). This result indicates that the guarding
behavior of female S. harmandi improves the survival of offspring.
The survival of eggs in the egg-guarding hiatus group (Table 1,
ETL, group 2) was lower than that in the whole-stage-guarding
group (Table 1, ETL, group 5). The survival of the larvae was
lower in the larval-guarding hiatus group (Table 1, LTC, group 3)
compared with the whole-stage-guarding group (Table 1, LTC,
group 5). The survival rates of pupae were not significantly
different between the cocoon-guarding hiatus group (Table 1,
CTA, group 4) and the whole-stage-guarding group (Table 1,
CTA, group 5). These results indicate that eggs and larvae were
sensitive to maternal care, while cocoons were not.
3. The influence of guarding duration on the survival of
offspring
The survival of eggs, as measured as the number of first instar
larvae, was increased with increasing guarding duration. A positive
correlation was detected by logistic regression between rate of egg
survival and the duration of guarding behavior (Figure 3, logistic
regression: R2= 0.842, guarding duration coefficients = 0.944,
constant coefficients = 1.569; ANOVA F1,40= 212.935, P,0.001).
A similar tendency was detected between the rate of larval survival
and the increasing duration of guarding (Figure 4, logistic
regression: R2= 0.656, guarding duration coefficients = 0.951,
constant coefficients = 1.563; ANOVA F1,47= 89.778, P,0.001).

significant difference (Tukey multiple comparisons test, P$0.05).

Increased investment of time by the females resulted in higher rate
of larval survival (Figure 4).
4. Effects of replaced females, including multiparous and
nulliparous stepmothers, on survival of offspring
The survival of the offspring in the multiparous guarding group
(Table 1, group 6) was higher than that in the non-guarding care
group (Table 1, group 1). No difference between the multiparousguarding group (Table 1, group 6) and the whole-stage-guarding
group (Table 1, group 5) was found. This result indicates that the
guarding behavior of multiparous females, like maternal females,
improves the survival of offspring. The survival of the offspring was
not significantly different between the nulliparous-guarding group
(Table 1, group 7) and the non-guarding group (Table 1, group 1),
indicating that nulliparous female rarely guarded or destroyed the
conspecific offspring.
5. The influence of maternal care on sex ratio
Though the number of females and males was significantly
different between the whole-stage-guarding group and the nonguarding group (Table 2), the sex ratio (females/[males+females])
was not significantly different between the two groups (Table 2). In
conclusion, maternal care had no influence on sex ratio, and S.
harmandi broods were female-biased.
Discussion
Maternal care in insects is considered a hallmark of sub-sociality
[1,26], and an understanding of the evolution of maternal care
offers insight into the origin of eusociality in insects [27–28]. The
evolution of maternal care depends on the benefit of care, in terms
of offspring survival, as well as the cost of future female fecundity
under given ecological conditions. Maternal care only evolves
when the benefits outweigh the costs of maternal care [17,27,29].
In this study, the benefits of maternal care in the parasitoid wasp S.
harmandi were demonstrated as increased survival and a positive
relationship between the survival of the eggs/larvae and the
guarding duration. This study is, as far as we know, the first
reported research about the behavior of maternal care in this
species.
The forms of maternal care are diverse in insects and include
nesting behavior, as well as protection and/or food provision for
the whole brood and/or to individual offspring [1–2,13,16–
17,28,30]. Forficula auricularia,a species of European earwig, guards
its eggs in soil burrows throughout winter. During egg guarding,
mothers continuously clean the eggs with their mouthparts to
protect the eggs from pathogens [5,31–33]. In a species of shield
bug, Parastrachia japonensis (Hemiptera: Cydnidae), maternal care
by provisioning increases nymphal survival under high-predation
pressure environments [10,34]. Female Anisolabis maritima (Dermaptera: Anisolabididae) bring food to the nest after their eggs
hatch, and this behavior increases the survival of the nymphs [35].
The majority (75%) of female P. japonensis foraged and provisioned
their nests with drupes of the host plant, Schoepfia jasminodora
(Olacacae), to feed their offspring [36]. The female treehopper,
Publilia modesta, guards its offspring, but the primary purpose of
maternal care is to attract ants (mutualists), because ant-tending
increases the number of surviving nymphs to adulthood by
approximately five-fold [37]. Maternal care in Bledius spectabili, a
subsocial intertidal beetle, protects the brood from flooding and
anoxia in its burrow [38].
In the current study, we found that the survival of immature
offspring was increased if the mothers stayed with their offspring.
According to behavioral observations, several likely reasons for the

improved survival of the offspring due to female S. harmandi
behavior emerged. First, these insects protected the food resource
from deterioration. During the process of maternal care, female S.
harmandi launched multiple attacks on the host and injected
venom. Previous studies showed that venom not only paralyzes the
ability of the host to struggle but also protects the haemolymph of
the host from deterioration [39]. Although the active component
of venom is still unknown, previous work has demonstrated that
the deterioration of host was delayed 3.8 days by the stinging of
female S. harmandi [39]. Second, the mothers facilitated food
resource acquisition [9,14]. The female wasps bit off the epidermis
of the host, resulting in some lacunae in the host surface. The
larvae extended their heads into the lacunae to absorb the
haemolymph of the hosts. Third, the maternal care behavior
resulted in avoidance of the offspring’s conspecific competition
[40]. During development of larvae, the immature forms of S.
harmandi became larger, and sometimes, this growth resulted in
overlap by larvae. In these circumstances, the female wasps
dispersed the larvae one by one to avoid larval competition for
food and space. Finally, the maternal care provided a suitable
habitat for the offspring [38]. In the case of eggs that left the host
surface, the female S. harmandi clasped these eggs with its
mandibles and replaced them on the host. Additionally, females
kept the dead larvae far away from other healthy larvae to insure
that healthy offspring avoided contamination by the poisonous
chemicals released by the decaying (dead) larvae.
The maternal care of offspring has been reported to be
associated with the stages of offspring [11,16–17,41]. Generally
speaking, younger offspring are more sensitive to maternal care
since these stages are more vulnerable to ecological factors, such as
predators or food availability [41]. For instance, females Bethylid
wasps Goniozus nephantidis defend younger offspring more than
older offspring because the risk of younger offspring being
destroyed by infanticidal intruders are higher than older offspring
[42]. Maternal care is classified into 3 groups in insects according
to the stage of offspring: (1) staying only with the eggs [10,43], (2)
staying with eggs until the offspring reach an advanced developmental stage [8,17], and (3) staying with eggs until emergence
[5,20]. In this study, female S. harmandi stayed with its offspring
until the offspring completed emergence, but only eggs and larvae
were sensitive to maternal care, while the survival of the cocoons
was seldom influenced by maternal care. These results likely stem
from the facts that the eggs and larvae were more vulnerable
compared to the cocoons and that the eggs and larvae were
directly exposed to the female parasitoid and thus were available
for the mother to provide assistant to improve survival, while the
cocoons were insulated from the mother by the fibroin shell.
In our present study, we found that (1) multiparous stepmothers
of S. harmandi exhibited maternal care and improved the survival of
offspring and (2) nulliparous stepmothers did not exhibit maternal
care but had no adverse influence, such as infanticide or
superparasitism, on the survival of the offspring. In the bethylid
wasp Goniozus nephantidis, offspring that were subjected to the
guarding behavior of a stepmother suffered a high mortality [17],
and the same effect occurs in the lace bug Corythucha hewitti [11].
The stepmothers of S. harmandi (including both multiparous and
nulliparous stepmothers) rarely killed offspring because these
stepmothers were probably siblings or originated from the same
recent ancestry as the biological mother, because the mating of
Bethylid wasps frequently occurs between siblings from the same
brood [44]. A recent study in the Bethylid wasps showed that the
relatedness between adult females mediates the degree of
aggression in competitive interactions, and in concrete terms,
contest behaviour was less aggressive when competitors were more
closely related [45]. Furthermore, the hosts of the parasitoid S.
harmandi are abundant in natural conditions. At least 50 species of
insects in 20 families have already been reported to be suitable as
hosts for S. harmandi [46]. Infanticide and superparasitism are more
likely to occur when resources are limited [47–50]. For instance,
one of reasons for Bethylid wasps Goniozus nephantidis or Laelius
pedatus performing ovicide is that the unparasitized hosts (resources) are reared [17,51]. Therefore, female S. harmandi seldom attack
the parasitized host and seldom kill or destroy conspecific
immature forms. Finally, according to the results of the female
replacement experiment described here, we can infer that
oviposition is the trigger to initiate maternal care, since only the
multiparous stepmothers of S. harmandi exhibited maternal care.
This inference was demonstrated in the whitefly Aleyrode singularis,
as only the ovipositing females of this species exhibit maternal care
[6].
In conclusion, adult female bethylid wasps of the species S.
harmandis remained with their broods from egg stage to adulthood.
This behavior benefitted the survival of the offspring. Multiparous
stepmothers provided maternal care that increased the survival of
the offspring; however, nulliparous stepmothers did not provide
such care. Such subsocial behavior has been reported only a few
times in the parasitoid wasps. The costs of maternal care in the
species of S. harmandis, such as decreased female fecundity, and the
effects of maternal care on the survival of offspring in the presence
of enemies, such as predators and parasitoids, warrant further
examination in the future.
Materials and Methods
Insects
The parasitoid S. harmandi was reared on the pupa of Tenebrio
molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) for 50 successive generations in our laboratory. Pupae of T. molitor are commonly used as a
substitute for the M. alternates host, which are difficult to collect in
abundance for the mass rearing of S. harmandi. The pupae of T.
molitor were stored at 0uC for 2 days prior to use in parasitoid
rearing. The adults of S. harmandi were placed in plastic vials

(1063 cm), and a small cotton ball with 10% honey solution was
placed into each vial as a food source for the adults. The females in
the study were used 10 days after emergence. Insects were kept in
a climatic chamber at 2461uC with 70% relative humidity and a
16-hour light: 8-hour dark photoperiod.
Individual female S. harmandi were placed in 1.267.5-cm glass
vials that were plugged by a tampon. Each vial contained one T.
molitor pupa. Host pupae weighed 100–160 mg. Experiments were
carried out at 2461uC with 70% relative humidity and a 16-hour
light:8-hour dark photoperiod. Each experiment comprised 175
vials (7 repetitions with 25 vials per repetition).
The relationship between the oviposition productivity
and days after emerged
One female S. harmandi and one T. molitor pupa were placed into
a glass vial (1.267.5 cm).The pre-oviposition stage for the S.
harmandi occurred during the first 2 days, and S. harmandi seldom
oviposits during this period. We recorded the cumulative number
of eggs from the third day (beginning of ovipositing stage) after the
female and hosts were put together. If eggs were wizened, we
considered them dead. The number of eggs was checked every
12 hours (0.5 day) for 7 days using an anatomical lens with a cold
light source.
Effects of maternal care on the survival of the offspring
We determined the effects of maternal care on the survival of
the offspring with respect to the following issues: whether maternal
care improves the survival of offspring, which stages of the
offspring are sensitive to maternal care, and whether replaced
females, including multiparous and nulliparous stepmothers,
improves the survival of the conspecific offspring. Seven groups
were designed to address the questions. In the first group, mothers
stayed with their broods during the all developmental stages (i.e.,
egg, larva, and cocoon) of the offspring (whole-stage care group).
In the second group, the mothers, after ovipositing for 2 days, were
removed from the vial in order to prevent guarding behavior to
the offspring (non-care group). In the third group, mothers were
removed from the vial in the egg stage (egg-guarding hiatus group),
in order to ensure that the offspring lacked guarding behavior in
the egg stage. The removed mother was stored in an empty vial
and then placed back into the vial to stay with her offspring after
the eggs hatched to larvae. Similarly, in the fourth and the fifth
groups, the mothers were absent in the larval and cocoon stages,
respectively (larva-guarding hiatus group and cocoon-guarding
hiatus group). In the sixth and seventh groups, the mothers were
removed from the vial and were replaced by stepmothers that
stayed with the brood until the offspring emerged as an adult. Two
types of stepmothers were used: stepmothers that had previously
reproduced (multiparous stepmothers) and stepmothers that had
not previously reproduced (nulliparous stepmothers). Both the
multiparous stepmothers and the nulliparous stepmothers were of
the same age as the parental mother.
Upon hatching of the offspring from a prior stage to a posterior
stage, we recorded the number of the first instar larvae, cocoons,
and adults (females and males) to calculate the survival of the
offspring. If the adults of the offspring were all-male broods, we
excluded the samples and added new samples to yield a total of
175 vials (7 repetitions with 25 vials per repetition).
The influence of guarding duration on the survival of
offspring
Offspring in the sensitive stages were subjected to maternal
guarding behavior for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 days. During this period,
the mothers stayed with the offspring in the vial. For the remaining
time of a sensitive stage, the mothers were removed from the vial.
The removed mothers were stored in an empty vial and then
placed back into the vial to remain with the offspring after
hatching from a sensitive stage to a posterior stage. We determined
the offspring survival (number of immature individuals in a
posterior stage, for example egg survival was defined as the
number of first instar larvae).
Data analysis and statistics
Means of each repetition (7 repetitions with 25 vials per
repetition) were calculated. The statistical analyses for this study
were performed using the SPSS 17.0 program for Windows. Oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA, [a = 0.05]), Tukey multiple
comparisons test were performed to clarify the relationship
between oviposition productivity and days from ovipositing
(Experiment 1). Logistic regression was performed to determine
the relationship between the rate of egg/larval and guarding
duration (Experiment 4). Independent-sample t-tests were performed to determine whether guarding behavior influenced the
numbers of female offspring or male offspring. The Chi-Square
test was performed to access the sex ratio (proportion of the
females). ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparisons were
performed to assess the survival of the offspring in different
groups (whole-stage guarding group, non-guarding group, egg/
larvae/cocoon-guarding hiatus groups, multiparous stepmother
guarding group, and nulliparous stepmother guarding group).
ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparisons test were carried out
after the normal distribution test and homogeneity of variance test.
