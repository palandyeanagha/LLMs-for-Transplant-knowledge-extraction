Limited incision?
There is no doubt that a smaller incision augurs improved 
pain relief and improved cosmesis compared with standard 
incision.
Any limited incision brings the possibility of injuring the 
skin and soft tissues by stretching to get a better look in a 
reduced visual surgical feld. This in turn can cause a longer 
operating time (and resulting cost).
But as the surgical team becomes more familiar with 
these procedures, there are quickly, after a learning curve, 
shorter surgical times.
A reduced visual feld may lead to an increased rate of 
bone complications and poor component position in operations with implant insertion, which in turn may lead to more 
frequent failures and possibly decreased survivorship.
There is also a higher risk of neurovascular injury leading 
to iatrogenic nerve damage and vascular injury resulting in 
thrombosis or bleeding.
In theory, because of these difculties and possibly higher 
complication rates, the risk of reoperation is higher.
However, we can be reassured by the literature of the last 
years, as seen in the articles of the diferent experts of this 
review.
Finally, the contributions of limited incision can be categorized into critical goals (reduced pain and quicker return 
to function) and secondary consequences (shorter hospital 
stay and less cost).
But it is clear that the minimal incision technique is not 
de facto minimally invasive surgery.
Less aggressive technique?
Despite temptation, most surgeons didn’t get caught in the 
trap to be limited to a smaller incision, even if it could get 
personal advertising. Won over by the frst publications at 
the end of the 1990s, they tried to improve their technique 
by saving at the most the soft tissue in depth and repairing 
what they had damaged.
This approach is a technically demanding procedure; thus, 
potential disadvantages are related to the need for extensive 
learning curve.
The result was less muscle damage, reduced blood loss 
and fewer blood transfusion requirements.
This change brought less pain and allowed especially 
improved short-term recovery (earlier return to normal gait, 
earlier return of quadriceps function and motion considerably faster achieved, for example).
It must be noted that less pain and improved cosmesis in 
view of a small incision are making a signifcant contribution to the psychological impact on patient’s attitude, satisfaction and motivation for speeded up recovery. All authors 
report decreased pain scores and use of analgesics.
This less-invasive surgery needs generally the use of 
downsized and dedicated instrumentation, making bone cuts 
in situ, and minimal dislocation. As a result have emerged a 
multitude of implants and ancillary material to the delight 
of many manufacturers.
Shorter hospitalization?
Over the past decade, fast-track surgery has gained popularity as a means of optimizing early postoperative rehabilitation and increasing patient satisfaction.
This achievement follows much preparation well before 
operation: organizational and psychosocial. These are two 
elements, combined with almost total absence of pain, particularly through sustained local anesthesia, that will enable 
us to expand access to fast-track surgery to most of people.

This approach brings quicker rehabilitation and hence 
signifcant decrease in length of hospital stay.
The corollary of this is that, fnally, the minimally invasive techniques are cost-efcient.
The short-stay protocol was not associated with a higher 
complication rate and must be encouraged.
In conclusion
Minimally invasive techniques are safe and reproducible in 
the hands of an experienced surgeon and with selected and 
appropriated patients.
First advantages are relatively few postoperative complications comparable to or less than previous classic methods.
Therefore, minimally invasive techniques are currently 
more and more used in many surgical procedures on the soft 
tissues and bones from the hip to the foot.
