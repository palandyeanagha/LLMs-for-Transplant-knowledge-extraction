Abstract
Background: The need for the timely collection of diagnostic biosamples during symptomatic episodes represents a major
obstacle to large-scale studies on acute respiratory infection (ARI) epidemiology. This may be circumvented by having the
participants collect their own nasal swabs. We compared self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of swabbing quality and
detection of viral respiratory pathogens.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a prospective study among employees of our institution during the ARI
season 2010/2011 (December-March). Weekly emails were sent to the participants (n = 84), reminding them to come to the
study center in case of new symptoms. The participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one nostril, and trained
study personnel collected one from the other nostril. The participants self-collected another two swabs (one from each
nostril) on a subsequent day. Human b-actin DNA concentration was determined in the swabs as a quality control. Viral
respiratory pathogens were detected by multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV15 kit, Seegene, Eschborn, Germany). Of 84
participants, 56 (67%) reported at least one ARI episode, 18 participants two, and one participant three. Self-swabbing was
highly accepted by the participants. The amount of b-actin DNA per swab was higher in the self- than in the staff-collected
swabs (p = 0.008). b-actin concentration was lower in the self-swabs collected on day 1 than in those collected on a
subsequent day (p,0.0001). A respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of selfcollected swabs (p = 0.36). With both approaches, the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A/B/C
(12/75 swabs, 16%) and human coronavirus OC43 (4/75 swabs, 5%). There was almost perfect agreement between self- and
staff-collected swabs in terms of pathogen detection (agreement = 93%, kappa = 0.85, p,0.0001).
Conclusions/Significance: Nasal self-swabbing for identification of viral ARI pathogens proved to be equivalent to staffswabbing in this population in terms of acceptance and pathogen detection.

Introduction
The need for the timely collection of diagnostic biosamples
(such as nasal swabs) during acute symptomatic episodes represents
a major obstacle to large-scale studies on acute respiratory
infection (ARI) epidemiology. This may be circumvented by
having the participants collect their own nasal swabs (‘‘selfcollected nasal swabs’’ or ‘‘self-swabbing’’). This method has been
shown to be highly acceptable and feasible in various populations,
e.g. among parents who collected nasal swabs from their children
[1] or adults who collected swabs from themselves [2] (also
reviewed in [3]). While the mere feasibility of nasal self-swabbing
has thus been amply demonstrated, efforts to validate the
diagnostic equivalence of self-swabbing compared to staff-swabbing are still ongoing. In a sample of 38 individuals with ARI
symptoms, Larios et al. compared self-collected midturbinate
swabs with staff-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (gold standard)
that were collected the same day. The self-collected swabs had a
sensitivity of 86% for the detection of respiratory pathogens
compared to the gold standard [4]. Luinstra et al. found similar
detection rates for respiratory pathogens between self- and staffcollected midturbinate swabs when one staff-collected and one selfcollected swab were taken from opposite nostrils during the same
visit to a campus health center [5]. Ip et al. investigated the
validity of self-collected nasal (posterior nares) and pharyngeal
swabs to detect influenza virus infection and came to the
conclusion that self-swabs may be a good alternative [6]. While
these results do provide substantial evidence for the validity of selfcollected midturbinate swabs, anterior nasal swabs have not been
evaluated in this respect. Moreover, self-collected nasal swabs
collected on separate days have not been compared with each
other.
In the present study, we thus compared quality of swabbing and
efficiency of viral detection of anterior nasal swabs in the following
scenarios: 1) self- vs. staff-collected swabs that were taken during
the same visit to the study center (day 1), and 2) self- and staffPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48508

collected swabs from day 1vs. self-collected swabs that were
obtained at home on a later day.
Materials and Methods
Sample and Study Design
A prospective study was conducted during the 2010/2011 ARI
season among a convenience sample of employees of our
institution, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in
Braunschweig, Germany. In December 2010, employees (18 to
69 years old) were sent messages through the internal e-mail
system inviting them to participate in the study. This invitation
contained a link to the institutional intranet where information
about the study was made available in English and German.
Individuals planning to leave Braunschweig during the study
period and staff members of the Departments of Epidemiology
and Infection Genetics were not eligible to participate, the latter
due to concern over a potential conflict of interest.
At the baseline visit (December 2010–January 2011), the study
aims were explained to the participants and informed consent was
obtained. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect
basic sociodemographic data. At the end of the ARI season (April/
May 2011) the study participants completed a short acceptance
questionnaire. All participants received a remuneration of 5 J.
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the State
Board of Physicians of the German Federal State of Lower
Saxony.
Early Detection of ARI Symptoms and Collection of Nasal
Swabs
During January–March 2011 weekly e-mail messages were sent
to the participants reminding them to come to the study center
within 7 days of onset of at least one of the following symptoms:
sudden onset of stuffy or runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache,
malaise, chills, or fever, defined as body temperature .38uC. In
the study center, a trained staff member (A.G.) obtained a nasal
swab (regular flocked swab, Copan, Brescia, Italy, product number
359C) from the participant’s left nostril and instructed him/her
how to perform a self-swab. The participants also received written
and visual instructions for nasal self-swabbing. The participants
then self-collected a swab from the right nostril. Briefly, the swab
was to be inserted into the nostril to the point where the basal edge
of the flocked tip had just entered the nostril, corresponding to a
depth of insertion of approx. 1 cm. The swab was then rotated
three times, being careful to swab all 360u of the anterior nasal
lining and to include the superior recess (‘‘Little’s area’’) and the
latero-inferior recess. The swab was then placed into 1 ml
universal viral transport medium (Copan). A swabbing kit
containing written and visual self-swabbing instructions, two nasal
swabs and two vials of 1 ml transport medium was then given to
the participants with the request to self-collect two nasal swabs
(one from each nostril) at home the next day, to place each swab in
1 ml transport medium and to return the swabs to the study center
as soon as possible. The swabs were stored at 270uC until analysis.
The timeline of the study is shown in Fig. 1.
Laboratory Analysis
Detection of human b-actin coding sequences was used as a
measure of sample adequacy, assuming that the amount of b-actin
gene DNA can serve as proxy for the presence of human epithelial
cells [7,8]. DNA was extracted from a 350 ml aliquot of transport
medium with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit (Qiagen GmbH,
Hilden, Germany). b-actin DNA quantification was tested by realtime PCR with QuantiTect SYBRGreen PCR (Qiagen GmbH,
Hilden, Germany) using the primers 59 CCA ACC GCG AGA
AGA TGA CC 39 (forward) and 59 GAT CTT CAT GAG GTA
GTC AGT 39 (reverse), corresponding to positions (59) 382–617
(39) of the human b-actin gene (Eurofins mwg Operon, Ebersberg,
Germany). This resulted in amplification of a 236 bp fragment,
possessing a molecular weight of 15.8 kD based on an assumed
average molecular weight of 660 Dalton per basepair. Serial
dilutions of the plasmid eTC GFP b-actin DZip (Plasmid 27124 by
Addgene, 1 Kendall Sq. Ste. B7102 Cambridge, MA 02139,
USA), which contains these b-actin gene sequences in a
pcDNA3.1 backbone, were analyzed in parallel to obtain the
standard curve. b-actin DNA concentration was determined in all
four swabs. The values of the two swabs that were self-collected at
home were pooled. The technician performing the laboratory
analyses was not blinded as to whether a swab was staff- or selfcollected.
Detection of viral respiratory pathogens. RNA was
extracted from 200 ml aliquots of transport medium (UTM Kit,
Copan, Brescia, Italy) with the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit
(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized with
the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and tested by multiplex PCR (Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit, Seegene Germany,
Eschborn, Germany) for the presence of any of 15 human viral
respiratory pathogens (adenovirus A/B/C/D/E, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus 1/2/3/4, human coronavirus
229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4,
influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, and
rhinovirus A/B/C), following the manufacturer’s recommendations except that 4 ml instead of 1 ml cDNA was used as input for
the PCR reaction.
Acceptability
Satisfaction and acceptability were assessed using a nine-item
questionnaire. Participants rated each item on a five-point Likert
scale with 1 indicating strong disagreement, 2 disagreement, 3
neither disagreement nor agreement, 4 agreement, and 5 strong
agreement. Some of these items were reverse-phrased to reduce
response bias.
Statistical Analysis
Data were described by percentage for categorical variables and
median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables.

swab were obtained on day 1 from separate nostrils. The participants
were instructed to collect a self-swab from each nostril the next day,
but the actual day of self-swabbing ranged from day 2 to day 6, as
indicated by the triangle.

Self- and Staff-Collected Nasal Swabs
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48508

Agreement between self- and staff-collected nasal swabs in the
detection of respiratory pathogens was examined with Cohen’s
kappa (k) statistic using the following classification: ,0 = poor; 0–
0.2 = slight; 0.21–0.4 = fair; 0.41–0.6 = moderate; 0.61–0.8 = substantial; and 0.81–1 = nearly perfect agreement [9]. The McNemar test was used to compare proportions of positive swabs
between paired samples. Log transformation did not lead to
normal distribution of the b-actin DNA concentration values.
Thus, the non-transformed values were used and differences
between staff- and self-collected swabs were examined with the
Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. b-actin DNA concentration values
were also divided into quartiles and examined for association with
positivity status using a test for trend. The statistical program SPSS
for Windows, version 19, was used for all analyses.
Results
Eighty-four participants responded to the invitation e-mail,
corresponding to a response rate of 18%. Seventy-two participants
(86%) were women, the median age was 37 years (range, 28–46).
About half of the respondents had a university degree (including
university of applied sciences) and about 12% were born outside
Germany.
Acceptability
Overall, both staff- and self-collected nasal swabs were highly
accepted (Table 1). Most participants reported that instructions
how to collect the swab were easy to understand and that the nasal
self-swab was easy to perform. The participants did not make a
preference regarding self- or staff-collected swabs (Table 1).
Detection of ARI Symptoms and Collection of Nasal
Swabs
Fifty-six of 84 (67%) participants reported at least one ARI
episode, 18 (32%) participants reported two episodes, and one
participant reported three, resulting in a total of 75 ARI episodes
for the final analysis. The number of ARI symptoms reported in a
single ARI episode ranged from one to seven (median, 3.0). Thus,
75 matched pairs of staff- and self-collected nasal swabs,
performed on the same day, were available. About 14% of these
were taken on the day of symptom onset (day 1), 33% on day 2,
22% on day 3, 12% on day 4, and 19% on or after day 5. The
additional set of self-collected swabs, which was to be collected at
home the next day, was obtained in the majority of ARI episodes
(71/75, 95%), for 67/71 (94%) of which swabs from both nostrils
were returned, and from only one side in the remaining four.
Sixty-two percent of these swabs were indeed collected the next
day (day 2) and the latest one on day 6 (Fig. 1).

Laboratory Results
When comparing the staff- and self-swabs collected on day 1, bactin DNA concentration was higher in the self-collected swabs
(p = 0.008) (Fig. 2A). The b-actin DNA concentration was higher
in the self-swabs collected on or after day 2 than in the self-swabs
from day 1 (p,0.0001). Interquartile distance was smallest in the
staff-collected swabs and greatest in the swabs that were selfcollected at home, indicating lower variability in the staff-collected
than in the self-collected swabs. b-actin DNA levels did not
correlate with the duration of symptoms preceding the day of swab
collection (Fig. 2B).
A respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of
staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs collected on day 1
(p = 0.36, McNemar test). In both, the most frequently identified
pathogens were human rhinoviruses A, B or C (12/27 positive
swabs, 44%), human coronavirus OC43 (4/27 swabs, 15%) and
parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 or 4 (4/27, 15%). Table 2 contains
the complete list of detected pathogens, expressed as percentages
of all 75 swab pairs collected on day 1 in which a pathogen was
detected in at least one of the two swabs. There was nearly perfect
agreement between the staff- and self-swabs collected on day 1 in
terms of pathogen detection (percent agreement = 93%, k = 0.85,
Fig. 3). The overall sensitivity of self-collected swabs to detect a
respiratory pathogen was 96%, compared to the staff-collected
swabs (Table 3). This very good agreement between the staff- and
self-collected swabs from day 1 is also evident in the flow diagram
shown in Fig. 3.
Analyzing the results obtained with the self-swabs from day 2 or
later, a viral pathogen was detected in 39% (26/67) of the swab
pairs when the results of both nostrils were combined. When the
swabs from each side were considered separately, a pathogen was
detected in 31% (21/67) of the self-collected swab from the right
and in 37% (25/67) of swabs from the left nostril. However, this
apparent difference was not significant (p = 0.22, McNemar test).
Comparing viral detection of these self-swabs with that of the staffcollected swabs from day 1 revealed substantial agreement

(percent agreement = 85%, k= 0.67). The detection of a viral
pathogen was independent of the amount of b-actin DNA in both
staff- and self-swabs collected on day 1 (Fig. 4). Likewise, there was
no association between viral positivity status and b-actin DNA
levels across all samples (p for trend = 0.943).
Discussion
This prospective study comparing staff- and self-collected nasal
swabs for the detection of ARI pathogens clearly demonstrated the
validity of self-swabbing; specifically, self-swabbing was not inferior
in terms of acceptance, satisfaction, sample adequacy, and viral
detection rate. Of note, we observed excellent agreement in viral
detection between self- and staff-collected swabs collected the same
day. The agreement between the swabs that were self-collected at
home and the staff-collected swabs was somewhat less pronounced, but still was classified as substantial (k= 0.67). This lower
agreement may be explained by the time lag between collection of
the staff-swabs and the self-swabs at home, which spanned up to 6
days and resulted in five additional positive self-swabs, but only
two additional negative ones. Thus, taken together, the results
strongly indicate equivalence of self-collected and staff-collected
swabs in this study population.
Noteworthy differences were detected in b-actin DNA concentration, which was used to quantify the amount of host cells and
thus served as a measure of sample adequacy [8]. Median b-actin
DNA concentration was significantly higher in the self-collected
than in staff-collected swabs, but also in the swabs that were selfcollected at home than in the self-collected swabs from day 1.
Taken together, these results suggest (1) that the participants
applied higher swabbing pressure than the trained staff member,
likely due to high confidence in the self-swabbing procedure, and
(2) that a training effect resulted in yet greater confidence and
more vigorous swabbing when self-swabbing was repeated at home
$1 day later. In support of this notion, in a study comparing staffand self-collected swabs that were obtained the same day Smieja
et al. observed a higher number of epithelial cells and a tendency
toward a higher b-actin DNA level in a second self-swab that was
collected immediately after the first one [8]. Alternatively, the
presence of leukocytes in purulent secretions may have contributed
to b-actin levels in some swabs. However, we do not consider this
to be a major contributing factor since most participants did not
have purulent secretions. Another theoretical reason for the higher
b-actin DNA levels in the swabs that were self-collected at home
might have been the longer disease duration, leading to higher
shedding of epithelial cells or higher leukocyte numbers in the
secretions. However, as shown in Fig. 2B, there was no association
between duration of symptoms and b-actin concentration in the
swabs, thus ruling out this possibility in the present study. Of note,
more thorough sampling (as reflected by higher b-actin DNA
levels) did not improve viral detection in our study, suggesting that
the amount of host cells on the swabs was near the optimum in
most cases. Alternatively, the sampling of host cells may not be a
major determinant for the detection of ARI viruses due to the
presence of sufficient amounts of viral particles in nasal secretions.
A criticism of studies comparing staff- and self-collected swabs
from the same day has been that the participants might feel more
confident in the presence of study personnel [10] and that selfswabs might actually be inferior when collected in the absence of
study personnel. We tested this hypothesis by including two
additional nasal swabs which were self-collected at home $1 day
later. Comparison of these swabs with staff-collected swabs
collected on day 1 revealed good agreement in terms of viral
detection and even better sample adequacy, thus demonstrating
the diagnostic equivalence of self-swabbing in an unsupervised
setting, provided that the participants have been trained
adequately.
Limitations
It should be kept in mind that only two individuals with PCRproven influenza virus infection were detected. Therefore, anterior
nasal self-swabbing for the detection of influenza virus infection
still needs to be validated in dedicated studies. Recently, a flocked
mid-turbinate swab was developed and turned out to be superior
to the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab in terms of ARI virus
detection [8]. The anterior nasal swab used in the present study
has not been compared to this midturbinate swab. This should be
done in a future study. Our findings are also limited by the fact
that the study was conducted in a selected study population
recruited within a research institution. However, the population
included a mixture of scientific, clerical and support staff. Notably,
education level spanned a broad range and did not influence viral
detection or b-actin DNA levels. Nonetheless, our findings need to
be validated in future studies using random samples drawn from
the general population.
Due to much lower expenses for personnel and travel, selfcollection would be a highly cost-efficient way to obtain diagnostic
nasal swabs in medium and large scale population-based studies on
ARI epidemiology [3]. The presented study adds significantly to
the growing body of evidence demonstrating its diagnostic
equivalence to staff-collection.
Conclusions
Nasal self-swabbing proved to be an acceptable, feasible and
valid method to identify viral respiratory pathogens in this selected
adult population. Its applicability in the general population should
be tested in future studies.
