Abstract
Background: Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) is primarily hepatotropic, markers of HCV replication were detected
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as in ex vivo collected tissues and organs. Specific strains of
HCV were found to be capable to infect cells of the immune system: T and B cells and monocytes/macrophages as
well as cell lines in vitro. The direct invasion of cells of the immune system by the virus may be responsible for
extrahepatic consequences of HCV infection: cryoglobulinemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of markers of HCV infection: negative strand HCV RNA
and non-structural NS3 protein in PBMC subpopulations: CD3+
, CD14+ and CD19+. The presence of virus and the
proportion of affected cells within a particular PBMC fraction could indicate a principal target cell susceptible for HCV.
Methods: PBMC samples were collected from 26 treatment-free patients chronically infected with HCV. PBMC
subpopulations: CD3+
, CD14+, CD19+ were obtained using positive magnetic separation. The presence of negative strand
RNA HCV and viral NS3 protein were analyzed by strand-specific RT-PCR and NS3 immunocytochemistry staining.
Results: Negative strand HCV RNA was detectable in 7/26 (27%), whereas NS3 protein in 15/26 (57.6%) of PBMC
samples. At least one replication marker was found in 13/26 (50%) of CD3+ cells then in 8/26 (30.8%) of CD14+ and
CD19+ cells. The highest percentage of cells harboring viral markers in single specimen was also observed in
CD3+ (2.4%), then in CD19+ (1.2%), and much lower in CD14+ (0.4%) cells.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that CD3+ cells are a dominant site for extrahepatic HCV replication, although other
PBMC subpopulations may also support virus replication.
Keywords: HCV, PBMC, Extrahepatic replication, NS3 protein, Negative strand HCV RNA
Background
Multiple studies showed that hepatitis C virus (HCV) is
not a strictly hepatotropic pathogen [1-4]. In recent
years, the evidence of the extrahepatic HCV replication
by detection of positive and negative strand HCV RNA
and viral proteins were shown in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC); [5-8], bone marrow [9] and
in the central nervous system [10,11] as well as in vitro
in cell culture models: macrophages, cell lines MT2,
Huh7, Jukat, Molt-4 [12].
Molecular markers of extrahepatic HCV replication
were detected frequently in subjects with severely
impaired immunity, in particular due to advanced HIV
infection [2,3,5,13]. In these patients cells supporting
HCV replication were T and B lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages [6,14].
The clinical consequences of HCV extrahepatic replication are known, as the role of viral infection in the induction of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia and B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) is well ascertained

[15-18]. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these phenomena are poorly understood. They may
include functional defects, abnormal proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes due to chronic inflammatory
process and/or direct cell infection by the virus [19-22].
To characterize the extrahepatic sites of HCV replication and virus reservoirs in the organism the studies of
separate markers of HCV replication in PBMC were performed [2,8,23,24], however, there is no complex study
detecting both viral genetic material and viral proteins in
separated cell subpopulations, as well as determining the
frequency of cell infection with HCV. While presence of
negative strand HCV RNA indicates virus RNA replication, NS3 HCV production indicates the presence of
viral mRNA translation and polyprotein processing [23].
Non structural protein (NS3) as an essential component
of the HCV replication life cycle, and plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of HCV.
The aim of the present study was to determine the
prevalence of HCV infection in separated PBMC fractions: T cells (CD3+
), B cells (CD19+) and monocytes
(CD14+
). The presence of HCV intermediate replication
product (negative strand RNA) as well as the presence
of viral NS3 protein were analyzed in different cell
subpopulations.
Results and discussion
The mechanisms of HCV replication in cells of the immune system are far from clear. Invasion of cells by this
virus may be consequential as previous in vivo and in vitro
studies showed modified multiple gene expression and
apoptotic pathways in HCV infected cells [14,25,26]. Thus,

it is important to recognize the principal target population
for HCV within cells of the immune system and further
determine the role of the virus in cell dysfunction, particularly in the light of the were described detrimental effect
of HIV/HCV coinfection [14].
Previous studies have reported evidence for extrahepatic
replication of HCV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) [2-7]. However, discrepancies exist regarding the
main cell populations infected [8,13,21,23]. Other studies
have reported evidence for HCV replication in granulocytes and dendritic cells as well as in extrahepatic tissues
[23]. While extrahepatic replication is gaining wide acceptance some authors consider it to be controversial [27,28].
Replicative forms of HCV were detected in all studied
subpopulations: CD3+
, CD14+, CD19+.
The negative strand HCV RNA was detected in 7/26
(27%) PBMC samples with similar frequency in all separated CD3+
, CD14+ and CD19+ cells, 3/26 (11.5%), 2/26
(7.6%) and 4/26 (15.3%) respectively (Table 1). The presence of genomic (positive) HCV RNA strand was detectable in all cell specimens studied (data not shown). The
measurement of positive to negative strand ratio was not
performed due to the limited amount of material and
low viral loads. However, our previous studies indicated
that the genomic RNA strand is typically detectable at a
level 1–2 logs higher than the negative strand [29].
The presence of HCV NS3 protein was observed in
more than half 15/26 (57%) of the examined PBMC
samples, most frequently in CD3+ cells: 11/26 (42.3%),
followed by CD14+ and CD19+ cells: 6/26 (23%). The observed prevalence of HCV infection was higher than
reported in other studies performed in immunocompetent
patients, probably due to the application in the current
analysis of two different viral replication markers [3,7,13].
Previous studies showed that CD3+ cells harboured
the virus more often than the remaining PBMC subpopulations [3,14,15,19,30].
In our study we found that half of CD3+ samples (13/26)
were NS3 HCV positive, whereas in CD14+ and CD19+ the
prevalence reached 30.8%. In two patients, NS3 HCV was
observed in all three examined cell subpopulations (Table 1;
Figure 1).
Proportion of NS3 positive cells within cell subsets was
highest for CD3+ cells (range: 1–17; mean: 2.4 ± 4.2),
whereas for CD14+ (range: 1–20; mean: 4 ± 0.7), and
CD19+ (range: 1–23; mean: 1.2 ± 4.5); (Table 1).
No correlation between NS3 HCV and HCV RNA
negative strand was found, which could be due to low

level of the virus replication [5,24]. While in some other
studies the presence of HCV proteins was correlated
with HCV RNA, however, this was based on the analysis
of the genomic, not negative strand RNA [1,8,31,32].
The prevalence of NS3 - positive cells is lower than observed in the liver were proportion infected cells varies
from 0.04% to more than 80% [31,33]. Results of the
current study are similar to those published by RodriguezInigo et al. who used in situ hybridization in unselected
PBMC. In that study infected cells constituted 0.08% to
4% of all PBMC [8].
Conclusions
Our results indicate that CD3+ cells are a dominant site
for extrahepatic HCV replication, although other PBMC
subpopulations may also support virus replication.
Methods
Blood samples were collected on EDTA, from 26 consecutive chronically HCV infected patients (male/female 17/9;
mean age 54.69 ± 8.12) treated at Clinic of Hepatology
and Acquired Immune Deficiencies, Medical University of
Warsaw.
Twenty five patients were infected with genotype 1b,
one with genotype 3a.
Eleven patients (42%) were diagnosed with crioglobulinemia. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the
studied patients are shown in Table 1 [34].
The study was approved by the Internal Review Board
at the Warsaw Medical University (ref. no. KB/17/2013)
and each patient provided a written consent.
Magnetic cells sorting
PBMC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on
Histopaq (Sigma, Missouri, USA) from 10 ml of blood
collected into a tube containing EDTA. The PBMC subpopulations: CD3+
, CD14+, CD19+ were isolated by positive
selection by IMag (magnetic cell separation system, BD
IMagnet™; San Jose, USA). For separation of particular cell
subpopulations, the following antibodies were used: antiCD3 (anti-human CD3 magnetic Particles-DM, BD IMag™,
San Jose, USA), anti-CD19 (anti-human CD19 magnetic
Particles-DM, BD IMag™; San Jose, USA), anti-CD14
(anti-human CD14 magnetic Particles-DM, BD IMag™;
San Jose, USA).
Purity of each population was verified by flow cytometry (Canto II, BD) using the antibodies: PE mouse antihuman CD3 (BD Pharmingen™, San Jose, USA), PE
mouse anti-human CD14 (BD Pharmingen™; San Jose,
USA), APC mouse anti-human CD19 (BD Pharmingen™;

San Jose, USA), and isotype control: PE and APC mouse
IgG1ĸ (BD Pharmingen™; San Jose, USA).
The purity of the separated CD3+, CD14+ and CD19+
cells was no lower than 92.4%, 97.5% and 96.7%, respectively (Figure 2).
Detection of negative strand HCV RNA
HCV RNA was extracted from 1×106 PBMC and 2-3×104
of separated CD3+, CD14+and CD19+ subpopulations, as
described elsewhere [1]. Qualitative detection of the
negative-strand HCV RNA, spanning 5’UTR viral region
was accomplished by specific synthesis of cDNA in 70°C
using the thermostable enzyme Tth (Applied Biosystem,
Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA).
For Tth-based RT-PCR detection of the negative strand,
cDNA was synthesized in 20 μl of reaction mixture
containing 50 pM sense primer, 1x RT buffer (Applied
Biosystem, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA), 1 mM
MnCl2, 200 mM (each) dNTP, and 5 U of Tth (Applied
Biosystem, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). After
30 min at 72°C, Mn2+ was chelated with 8 μl of 10x EGTA
chelating buffer (Applied Biosystem, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, USA), 50 pM antisense primer was added, the
volume was adjusted to 100 μl, and the MgCl concentration was adjusted to 2.2 mM. To increase the specificity
and sensitivity of assay, wax beads (Ampliwax; Applied
Biosystem) were routinely employed for “hot start”. The
amplification was performed in Perkin Elmer GenAmp
PCR System 9600 thermocycler (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
Massachusetts, USA). The sequence of primers and reaction conditions are shown in Table 2. The PCR products
were analyzed on 2% agarose gel.
All PCR runs included positive controls, consisting of
end point dilutions of the respective RNA strands. The
titers were determined by analyzing 10-fold serial dilutions of the template. To prevent contamination, prePCR steps were carried out in separate room. Negative
controls consisting of PBMC from HCV negative patients were included in all reaction series: one negative
sample was processed for every 3 to 4 tested specimens.
Under these conditions, none of the negative controls
was positive [35].
The strand specific assay used in the study was capable
of detect 100 viral genomic eq/ml of the correct negative
strand or HCV genomic strand, while ≥ 108 genomic
equal of the incorrect strand. The amount of used RNA
was 1–4 μg RNA per reaction [5].
The results were reported as positive or negative.
Detection of HCV NS3 in PBMC and separated cell
subpopulations
PBMC smears preserved in acetone/chloroform were incubated with primary monoclonal anti-NS3 antibody
(Novocastra™, Leica, Newcastle, UK), following incubation
with Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). To stain the cell nuclei,
preparations were incubated with Hoechst reagent
(Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, USA) and analyzed by fluorescent microscope Eclipse 80i (Nikon, Tokio, Japan) using
330–380 nm (Hoechst) and 450 – 490 nm (Alexa 488)
UV-2A filter.
The control material included PBMC samples collected from uninfected patients and liver biopsy samples
from HCV infected patients (positive samples) and uninfected patients (negative control). The specificity of the
method was verified by an “internal” reaction control
without a primary antibody (Figure 1).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi square test (Install
07). Spearman’s correlation test was used to investigates the linear relationships between presence of
NS3 HCV in individual cell subpopulations: CD3+
,
CD14+
, CD19+, and negative strand level HCV RNA.
P values > 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The analysis was performed by use of Statistica software, version 10.
