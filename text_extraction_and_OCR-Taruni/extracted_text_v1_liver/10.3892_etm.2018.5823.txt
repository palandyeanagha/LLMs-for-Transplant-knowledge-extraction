Abstract. The aim of the present study was to analyze the risk 
factors for new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients 
who have received a liver transplant. A total of 190 patients 
who underwent liver transplantation between March 2001 and 
January 2015 were followed up, and analyzed retrospectively. 
Sex, age, primary disease, preoperative laboratory findings 
(hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine and glomerular filtration 
rate), surgical approach, blood loss during the surgery and 
transfusion volume, postoperative complications, and the 
average levels of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (from liver 
transplantation to the onset of CKD) were analyzed. In total, 
40 patients developed new-onset CKD after transplantation. 
Clinical data in the new-onset CKD group were compared 
with the non‑CKD group. A χ2 test, t-test and logistic regression analysis were performed using SPSS 17.0 software. The 
incidence of new-onset CKD after liver transplantation was 
21.1%. Renal pathology included IgA nephropathy, hepatitis 
B virus-associated nephropathy, membranous proliferative 
glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis and 
cryoglobulinemia-associated renal injury. Among the CKD 
patients, 85.7% had tubulointerstitial damage. Univariate 
analysis showed that preoperative renal function, hemoglobin, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion volume, 
postoperative acute kidney injury, average levels of CNIs, 
and hypertension were risk factors for new-onset CKD after 
liver transplantation. Logistic regression analysis showed 
that preoperative glomerular filtration rate [odds ratio 
(OR)=0.980, P=0.041], hemoglobin (OR=0.972, P=0.034), 
average levels of CNIs (OR=1.364, P=0.015) and hypertension (OR=4.833, P=0.048)] were independent risk factors for 
new-onset CKD. The incidence of new-onset CKD in patients 
who received liver transplantation was high. The main risk 
factors were identified to be preoperative glomerular filtration 
rate, hemoglobin, postoperative average levels of CNIs and 
hypertension.
Introduction
With the increase in the success rate of liver transplantation, 
giving rise to overall 1- and 5-year patient survival rates of 90 
and 75%, respectively(1), more and more patients are developing 
late complications, such as renal dysfunction. Liver transplant 
patients have the second highest incidence of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) post-surgery, after heart and lung transplant 
patients (2). Some studies have reported the incidence of CKD 
is 4.0-27.5% within 1 year after liver transplantation (3). CKD 
is a major contributor to post-transplant mortality. The relative 
risk is 3.32 (2.96-3.71) (2). Therefore, it is necessary to identify 
the causes of new-onset CKD after liver transplantation. Some 
studies have reported that the causes are complex and may 
include the preoperative glomerular filtration rate, a history of 
hypertension, diabetes, the degree of proteinuria, hemoglobin 
level and the duration of renal impairment (4-6). Calcineurin 
inhibitor (CNI)-related nephrotoxicity and chronic CNI nephrotoxicity are often observed in liver transplant patients. One 
study indicated that low-dose tacrolimus combined with everolimus 1 month after liver transplantation could help preserve 
renal function at 1 year post-liver transplantation (7). However, 
few studies have been published regarding the intraoperative 
risk factors for new-onset CKD. The goal of the current study 
was to analyze the risk factors for new-onset CKD occurring 
in patients receiving liver transplantation, and to assess how 
the quality of life and long-term survival of these patients may 
be improved.
Patients and methods
Patients. Forty patients with new-onset CKD were analyzed 
retrospectively among 190 patients who underwent liver 
transplantation between March 2001 and January 2015 at 
Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital (Beijing, China) or 
People's Hospital, Peking University (Beijing, 100044); the 
remaining 150 patients did not develop CKD, and 40 of them 
were selected randomly, using a random number chart, to 
serve as the control group. The risk factors for new-onset

CKD occurrence were analyzed in patients who received 
liver transplantation.
Methods. Demographic details, relevant preoperative and postoperative laboratory tests, and average levels of CNIs (during 
liver transplantation to the onset of CKD) were recorded. All 
patients were followed up every 3 months after liver transplantation, and urinalysis and kidney function were examined. 
None of the patients required hemodialysis. Kidney function 
was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
which was calculated with the CKD-EPI equation according 
to the 2002 KDOQI guidelines (3). CKD is defined as renal 
impairment (kidney morphology, pathology, imaging, blood or 
urine composition abnormalities) persisting for >3 months with 
or without eGFR decrease, and/or eGFR<60 ml/min·1.73 m2
for >3 months with or without renal impairment. New-onset 
CKD is defined as CKD that occurs after liver transplantation. 
In patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), HBsAg, HBsAb, 
HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb and HBV-DNA were tested regularly. Antiviral drugs included entecavir, adefovir dipivoxil 
and tenofovir. In patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis C antibody and HCV-RNA were examined regularly. The 
routine treatments included interferon, lamivudine and ribavirin. Prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were 
selected as anti-rejection drugs after liver transplantation.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed 
with SPSS version 17.0, with P<0.05 considered to indicate 
a statistically significant difference. Measurement data are 
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data were 
estimated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribute 
test, unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare between 
groups if the data were estimated to be normally-distributed, 
and the Mann Whitney U test was used if the data had a 
non-normal distribution. Count data are expressed as a 
percentage, and a χ2 test was used to compare between two 
groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the 
contributing factors to new-onset CKD in patients receiving 
liver transplantation.
Results
Comparison of preoperative clinical data between the 
new‑onset CKD group and the non‑CKD group in patients 
who received liver transplantation. The new-onset CKD 
patients were followed up for 63±45 months (4-156 months) 
vs. 42±21 months (6-84 months) in the non-CKD group. 
The average age in the new-onset CKD group was 51.5±8.8 
(28-70) years, compared with 47.4±11.2 (10-60) years in the 
non-CKD group. Of the 40 patients in the new-onset CKD 
group, 35 (87.5%) were male.
Primary diseases of the liver included HBV-related cirrhosis, 
alcoholic cirrhosis, liver cancer, HBV-related cirrhosis with 
hepatocellular carcinoma, primary biliary cirrhosis, cryptogenic cirrhosis and drug-induced hepatitis. There were no 
statistically significant differences in primary liver diseases 
between the two groups (P=0.054), as shown in Table I. 
Preoperative biochemical tests included hemoglobin level, 
liver function, renal function, and albumin and lipid levels. The 
preoperative eGFRs and hemoglobin levels of the new-onset 
CKD group were significantly lower than those in the control 
group (P<0.05): The mean hemoglobin level was 102.6±21.7 g/l 
in the new-onset CKD group vs. 121.3±28.7 g/l in non-CKD 
patients; and the mean eGFR was 105.6±37.1 ml/min·1.73 m2
in the new-onset CKD group vs. 131.6±44.1 ml/min·1.73 m2
in the non-CKD group (Table II; Figs. 1 and 2). None of the 
patients in the new-onset CKD and non-CKD groups were 
diagnosed with CKD prior to the liver transplant. Some of the 
patients in new-onset CKD group seems have lower eGFR but 
the data were all in normal range.
Surgical methods, intraoperative blood loss, blood 
transfusion and anhepatic time. 13/40 patients (40.6%) 
in the new-onset CKD group and 22/40 (55%) in the 
non-CKD group received orthotropic liver transplantation. 19/40 (59.4%) patients in the new-onset CKD 
group and 18/40 (45%) in the non-CKD group received 
piggyback orthotropic liver transplantation. There were no 
significant differences in surgical procedures between the 
two groups (P=0.263).
Blood loss in the new-onset CKD group was 5,697±7,749 ml 
vs. 2,268±2,185 ml in the control group (P=0.000), and intraoperative blood transfusion in the new-onset CKD group 
was 5,181±3,780 ml vs. 3,754±2,902 ml in the control group 
(P=0.031). Blood loss and intraoperative blood transfusion 
were different between the two groups. The anhepatic time was 
63.3±15.6 min in the new-onset CKD group vs. 69.2±18.0 min 
in the non‑CKD group, and there was no significant difference 
between the two groups (P=0.611). The blood transfusion 
volumes during surgery are shown in Fig. 3.
Postoperative incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI 
after liver transplantation was defined as a serum creatinine 
level elevated to ≥26.4 µmol/l, or increased to ≥50% of the 
baseline within one 48 h period during 1 month following 
liver transplantation. 16/40 (40%) patients in the new-onset 
CKD group developed postoperative AKI vs. no patients in 
the non-CKD group, as shown in Table III.
Average levels of CNIs from liver transplantation to the onset 
of CKD. We calculated the average levels of CNIs from liver 
transplantation to the onset of CKD. The mean concentration 
of tacrolimus in the new-onset CKD group was 14.0±4.5 ng/ml 
vs. 11.0±2.8 ng/ml in the control group (P=0.001), as shown in 
Table III and Fig. 4.
Postoperative complications. Postoperative complications included postoperative hypertension and diabetes. 
14/40 (35.0%) patients developed hypertension in the 
new-onset CKD group vs. 5/40 (12.5%) patients in the control 
group (P=0.040); 13/40 (32.5%) patients developed diabetes 
in the new-onset CKD group vs. 9/40 (25.0%) patients in the 
control group (P=0.222), as shown in Table III. There was 
no recurrence of HBV and HCV post-liver transplantation 
within the follow-up period, which was 63±45 months in 
the new-onset CKD group and 42±21 months in the control 
group.

Our data, analyzed by univariate analysis, indicated that 
preoperative eGFR (P=0.010), preoperative hemoglobin 
(P=0.003), intraoperative blood loss (P=0.000), intraoperative 
blood transfusion (P=0.031), postoperative AKI (P=0.000), 
postoperative average levels of CNIs (P=0.001) and 
postoperative hypertension (P=0.040) were associated with 
new-onset CKD occurrence in patients who had undergone 
liver transplantation, as shown in Table IV. By multivariate 
logistic regression analysis, we showed that preoperative 
eGFR, hemoglobin level, average postoperative levels of CNIs 
and postoperative hypertension were independent risk factors 
for new-onset CKD occurrence (Table V).
Renal pathology of patients with new‑onset CKD following 
liver transplantation. Out of 40 patients in the new-onset 
CKD group, only 7 patients gave consent for renal biopsy. 
6/7 (85.7%) patients had tubulointerstitial damage, which was 
associated with CNIs. Some exhibited glomerular diseases, 
including IgA nephropathy, HBV-associated nephropathy, 
membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis, focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and cryoglobulinemia-associated 
kidney damage, as shown in Table VI.
Discussion
CKD significantly impacts long-term prognosis and is a 
common complication in patients who have received a liver 
transplant. Studies (3) have reported that the incidence rates of 
CKD are 4.0-27.5% within 1 year and 30-50% within 10 years 
post-surgery (8). In this study, 190 patients who underwent 
liver transplantation were followed up for 4-156 months; 
40/190 (21.1%) patients developed new-onset CKD, which was 
significantly higher than the general population.
There have been few studies regarding intraoperative 
risk factors for new-onset CKD. In the present study, we 
analyzed surgical methods (orthotopic liver transplantation 
or piggyback orthotopic liver transplantation), anhepatic 
time, intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion, and the

results indicates that the volume of intraoperative blood loss 
and blood transfusion was a risk factor for new-onset CKD 
occurrence. The kidneys are sensitive to ischemia, especially 
in patients with impaired renal function, who are less tolerant 
of intraoperative hemodynamic instability. With an increase 
in intraoperative blood loss and blood transfusion leading to 
a decrease in renal perfusion pressure and glomerular filtration rate, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is aggravated. That

eventually leads to inflammatory responses, such as leukocyte 
infiltration, interstitial edema and a decrease in microvascular 
blood flow, which conversely exacerbates ischemic reperfusion injury (9).
Previous data also indicated that the dose-dependent 
nephrotoxicity of CNIs also plays an important role in 
new-onset CKD (10). Morard et al (11) reported that FK506 
concentrations of ≥10 and ≥8 ng/ml at 1 and 5 years post‑liver 
transplantation, respectively, were independent risk factors for 
the occurrence of CKD. In this study, we analyzed the average 
plasma FK506 concentration between the time of liver transplantation and the onset of CKD. Our results showed that the 
average plasma FK506 concentration was 14.0±4.5 ng/ml in 
the new-onset CKD group, in contrast to 11.0±2.8 ng/ml in 
the control group (P=0.001). Our multivariate analysis indicated that the average plasma concentration of FK506 from 
the time of liver transplantation to the onset of CKD was an 
independent risk factor for new-onset CKD in patients who 
had received liver transplantation. Calcineurin stimulates the 
secretion of endothelin by vascular endothelial cells, the release 
of angiotensin II and the overexpression of transforming 
growth factor-β. This process is accompanied by weakening 
of matrix degradation enzyme activity, which causes excessive contraction of glomerular arterioles, hyalinosis, chronic 
thromboembolism and excessive synthesis of the extracellular 
matrix. Finally, it leads to tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, 
and a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration 
rate. The severity of nephrotoxicity is mainly due to the 
long-term use of calcineurin drugs. In addition, the side effects 
of CNIs, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and 
hyperuricemia, also increase renal damage.
Our study also showed that preoperative low glomerular 
filtration rate and low hemoglobin are risk factors for 
new-onset CKD in patients who have received a liver transplant. These patients are more prone to ischemia-reperfusion 
injury during and after surgery because of the trauma and 
circulation instability.
Several studies have analyzed the postoperative risk factors 
for CKD in patients who have received liver transplantation. 
AKI was associated with the occurrence of CKD (12-14). The 
occurrence of CKD in liver transplant patients who had AKI 
was several times higher than in those patients who did not 
have concomitant AKI (15). Tinti et al (16) retrospectively 
studied 24 patients who had received liver transplantation, 
9 of which developed postoperative AKI. The incidence 
rates of CKD were 44.4 and 6.7% in the AKI group and the 
non-AKI group, respectively. Our univariate analysis showed 
that postoperative AKI was a risk factor for new-onset CKD 
occurrence in patients who had received liver transplantation. 
The rate of AKI was 100% in the new-onset CKD group. 
In contrast, it was only 40.7% in the non-CKD group (P=0.000).
In the general population, elevated blood pressure may 
cause various injuries, including glomerular endothelial 
and epithelial cell injuries, and an increase in the activity 
of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This eventually 
leads to damage to kidney function and proteinuria. 
Hypertension is commonly seen among patients with chronic 
glomerulonephritis, especially in FSGS. Some studies have 
reported that postoperative hypertension and diabetes are 
risk factors for CKD among patients who have received 
liver transplantation. Shao et al (10) retrospectively analyzed 
772 liver transplant patients,and showed that post-operative 
hypertension (OR=2.230, 95% CI: 1.059-4.696, P<0.05) was a 
risk factor for CKD, as determined by logistic regression. Our 
study consistently showed that postoperative hypertension was 
an independent risk factor for new-onset CKD occurrence. 
However, there was no statistical difference in the postoperative 
occurrence of diabetes between the new-onset CKD group and 
the non-CKD group, according to our data. This discrepancy 
may possibly be attributed to the short history of diabetes. 
However, our results will be further confirmed by future 
studies with larger number of patients.
In the past, very few CKD patients who received 
liver transplantation underwent renal biopsy. Several 
studies showed that the renal pathology in CKD patients 
was complex and diverse, including CNI-induced renal 
damage, hypertensive renal damage, diabetic nephropathy, 
HBV-associated membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, 
thrombotic microangiopathy, FSGS, membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia-associated 
renal damage, acute tubular necrosis, acute interstitial 
nephritis, amyloidosis, anti-glomerular basement membrane 
nephropathy, crescent glomerulonephritis and hydroxyethyl 
starch-associated tubule and interstitial lesions (11,17,18). In 
our study, 7 out of the 40 new-onset CKD patients underwent 
renal biopsy, among which 6 patients had acute or chronic 
tubular and interstitial damage. On the contrary, glomerular 
diseases included IgA nephropathy, membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis associated with HBV, membranous 
proliferative glomerulonephritis, FSGS and cryoglobulinemia associated with renal damage.
In conclusion, CKD is a common complication in patients 
who have received liver transplantation, and can affect the 
long-term prognosis of these patients. The preoperative 
glomerular filtration rate, hemoglobin level, average level of 
CNIs and postoperative hypertension are major risk factors for 
new-onset CKD following liver transplantation. Considering 
the severe shortage of liver donors, it is important to prevent 
new-onset CKD and improve survival by more carefully 
monitoring renal disease and function. Anemia correction, 
careful monitoring of CNI concentration and the prevention 
of AKI are of great significance for liver transplant patients 
with regard to avoiding new-onset CKD. We will examine 
more kidney biopsy samples among new-onset CKD patients 
post-liver transplant in order to better analyze the contribution of various risk factors to renal pathology in a future 
study. Finally, our study provided evidence to support the 
development of a better follow-up system to improve survival 
and quality of life for liver transplant patients.
Our sample size was limited, some of the conclusions were 
failed to be further discussed, such as the number of patients in the 
new‑onset CKD groups were not sufficient to assess the severity 
of CKD. We will expand the sample size for future studies.
