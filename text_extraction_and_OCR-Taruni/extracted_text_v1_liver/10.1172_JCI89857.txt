Introduction
A major threat to human health is posed by emerging viruses, such 
as dengue (DENV) and Ebola (EBOV). Dengue is estimated to infect 
390 million people annually in over 100 countries (1). Dengue fever 
can progress to a life-threatening disease, known as severe dengue, particularly upon a secondary infection with a heterologous 
DENV strain. Consequently, development of a dengue vaccine has 
been hampered by the necessity to generate simultaneous protection against 4 distinct DENV serotypes (2). As a further challenge, 
recent studies have suggested that preexisting DENV immunity 
may enhance Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and vice versa, and consequently increase disease severity (3–5). While an Ebola vaccine 
has shown promise recently (6), it is not yet approved. Moreover, 
no effective antiviral treatment is available against DENV, EBOV, 
ZIKV, and most other emerging viral pathogens, leaving the global 
population at risk for significant morbidity and mortality.
Most antiviral therapies approved to date target viral enzymes 
(e.g., protease or polymerase) via a “one drug, one bug” approach. 
This approach has demonstrated measurable success in treating 
chronic viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, 
such an approach to drug development is inefficient, expensive, 
and, therefore, not easily scalable to address the large unmet 
clinical need (7). Moreover, targeting virally encoded factors by 
monotherapy often is associated with rapid emergence of drug 
resistance (7). One alternative approach to treating viral infections 
while increasing the barrier to resistance is to target host functions, which the viruses intimately rely on (7). Moreover, focusing on host factors commonly required by multiple viral pathogens could provide broad-spectrum coverage. The host-targeted 
approach is attractive, particularly for the treatment of emerging 
viral infections lacking any treatment, given the opportunities to 
repurpose already existing drugs that are known to modulate specific host functions with tolerable side effect and toxicity profiles.
Intracellular membrane traffic is one of many cellular processes 
hijacked by viruses. Membrane traffic relies, in part, on the interactions between adaptor protein complexes (AP1 through AP5) and the 
transmembrane cargo. The well-characterized clathrin-associated 
APs, AP1 and AP2, are heterotetrameric complexes, which orchestrate the formation of vesicles destined for bidirectional transport 
in the secretory pathway and for endocytosis from the plasma membrane, respectively (8). The 2 host cell kinases AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) and cyclin G–associated kinase (GAK) regulate 
Global health is threatened by emerging viral infections, which largely lack effective vaccines or therapies. Targeting host 
pathways that are exploited by multiple viruses could offer broad-spectrum solutions. We previously reported that AAK1 and 
GAK, kinase regulators of the host adaptor proteins AP1 and AP2, are essential for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the 
underlying mechanism and relevance to other viruses or in vivo infections remained unknown. Here, we have discovered that 
AP1 and AP2 cotraffic with HCV particles in live cells. Moreover, we found that multiple viruses, including dengue and Ebola, 
exploit AAK1 and GAK during entry and infectious virus production. In cultured cells, treatment with sunitinib and erlotinib, 
approved anticancer drugs that inhibit AAK1 or GAK activity, or with more selective compounds inhibited intracellular 
trafficking of HCV and multiple unrelated RNA viruses with a high barrier to resistance. In murine models of dengue and 
Ebola infection, sunitinib/erlotinib combination protected against morbidity and mortality. We validated sunitinib- and 
erlotinib-mediated inhibition of AAK1 and GAK activity as an important mechanism of antiviral action. Additionally, we 
revealed potential roles for additional kinase targets. These findings advance our understanding of virus-host interactions and 
establish a proof of principle for a repurposed, host-targeted approach to combat emerging viruses.
Anticancer kinase inhibitors impair intracellular viral 
trafficking and exert broad-spectrum antiviral effects

vivo functional relevance remain unknown. In the present study, 
we demonstrate a role for AAK1- and GAK-regulated AP1 activity in HCV release and document that HCV particles specifically 
cotraffic with AP1 and AP2 in live cells. We also show a requirement for AAK1 and GAK in the life cycles of DENV and EBOV. 
Furthermore, we provide support for the feasibility of repurposing sunitinib/erlotinib combination as a broad-spectrum antiviral 
approach using in vitro models of multiple viral infections and 
murine models of DENV and EBOV. Lastly, we characterize the 
mechanism of action of sunitinib and erlotinib by validating AAK1 
and GAK as critical mediators of the antiviral effect and revealing additional potential antiviral host targets, which include AXL 
receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL), KIT proto-oncogene receptor 
tyrosine kinase (KIT), and the proto-oncogene RET.
Results
APs cotraffic with HCV and orchestrate infection. To determine the 
differential roles of AP1 and AP2 in HCV infection, we examined 
the effect of depleting their μ subunits in Huh7.5 human hepatoma 
receptor-mediated endocytosis and trans-Golgi network (TGN) 
transport (9–12). Specifically, AAK1 and GAK phosphorylate the μ
subunits of AP1 and AP2, thereby enhancing their binding affinity for 
sorting motifs within the cargo (9, 10, 13–15). Moreover, GAK recruits 
clathrin-associated APs to the plasma membrane and TGN (16).
Other groups have implicated APs in the life cycle of multiple unrelated viruses (17–26), and we reported roles for AP2 in 
HCV entry and assembly (22, 23). Our work demonstrated that 
through AP2 phosphorylation, AAK1 and GAK regulate these 
temporally distinct steps of the HCV life cycle, thereby, for the 
first time, uncovering their role as “master regulators” of a viral 
infection (22, 23). Moreover, we reported that sunitinib and erlotinib, approved anticancer drugs with potent binding to AAK1 and 
GAK (dissociation constant [KD] of 11 and 3.1 nM, respectively; ref. 
27), or selective, chemically distinct GAK inhibitors, block HCV 
entry and assembly in tissue culture (22, 23, 28). Although clathrin APs are presumed to mediate intracellular viral trafficking, 
this hypothesis has not been addressed in live cells. Moreover, the 
roles of AAK1 and GAK in viral infections beyond HCV and their in

lular infectivity was not affected by overexpression of either WT 
or T144A AP1 (Figure 1F). In contrast, extracellular infectivity 
increased upon ectopic expression of WT AP1 and decreased with 
ectopic expression of T144A AP1 (Figure 1F). Thus, viral release 
emerges as yet another step of the HCV life cycle, beyond entry 
and assembly, which is regulated by AAK1 and GAK.
While APs were postulated to directly mediate intracellular 
viral trafficking, this has never been addressed experimentally in 
live cells with any virus. To test the hypothesis that HCV particles 
shuttle with clathrin APs intracellularly, we used live cell imaging. 
The cotrafficking of individual, infectious HCV particles harboring a tetracysteine (TC) tag within the core protein (TC-core) with 
AP1- or AP2-mCherry was monitored (32). We previously have 
shown that TC-core motility requires HCV virion assembly (32). 
cells on distinct steps of the viral life cycle. Successful depletion of 
each targeted AP was confirmed (Figure 1A), with no alteration in 
the expression of the nontargeted AP (data not shown). AP2 depletion reduced HCV entry, had no effect on HCV RNA replication, 
and reduced HCV assembly (i.e., reduced intra- and extracellular 
infectivity in lysates and culture supernatants derived from HCVtransfected cells, respectively), as we previously reported (Figure 1, B–D, and refs. 22, 23). In contrast, AP1 depletion reduced 
extracellular infectivity only (Figure 1, B–D), consistent with a 
defect in viral release, in agreement with prior reports (29, 30). To 
test whether, in addition to AP2 (22), phosphorylation of AP1 by 
AAK1 and GAK is important for infectious HCV production, we 
studied the effect of overexpressing phosphorylation site mutant 
AP1 (T144A) on HCV infectivity (Figure 1E and ref. 31). IntracelFigure 2. AP1, AP2, and their regulatory kinases, AAK1 and GAK, are essential for DENV infection in vitro.

Supplemental Videos 5–10). These findings support our hypothesis that the antiviral effect of sunitinib and erlotinib is associated 
with reduced intracellular viral traffic.
The role of AAK1 and GAK in DENV infection in cells. The 
requirement for AAK1 and GAK in viral infections beyond HCV 
is unknown. To investigate whether another, distantly related 
member of the Flaviviridae family relies on these regulatory 
kinases and their associated AP targets, we examined the effect 
of the corresponding gene silencing on DENV infection in human 
hepatoma (Huh7) cells. We observed a requirement for AP2, but 
not AP1, in DENV entry using cell lines stably expressing shRNA 
targeting AP1, AP2, or a nontargeting (NT) sequence (Figure 2, A 
and B). While depletion of AP1 and AP2 had no effect on DENV 
RNA replication as measured by subgenomic replicon assays (ref. 
34 and Figure 2C), it diminished the production of infectious 
virus in culture supernatants (Figure 2D). Silencing expression of 
AAK1 and GAK resulted in no apparent cytotoxic effect (Figure 
2, E and F) but, analogously to experiments with HCV, inhibited 
entry and infectious virus production of DENV, with no effect on 
RNA replication (Figure 2, G–I). These results implicate AAK1 
and GAK in the DENV life cycle via regulation of 2 temporally 
distinct steps that depend on the clathrin-associated APs: entry 
and infectious virus production.
To determine whether a comparable effect on DENV infection can be achieved pharmacologically and further validate AAK1 
and GAK as antiviral targets, we treated DENV-infected cells with 
selective AAK1 and GAK inhibitors. The imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine-based compounds 7737 and 7745 were originally developed 
Analysis of TC-core puncta stained with the biarsenical dye FIAsH 
revealed that a large fraction of motile TC-core cotrafficked with 
either AP1 (25%) or AP2 (38%), whereas only 3% cotrafficked with 
the autophagosomal marker LC3 (Figure 1, G and H, Supplemental Figure 1A, and Supplemental Videos 1–3; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/
JCI89857DS1). The velocities of the cotrafficking particles were 
consistent with previous reports on secretory vesicle trafficking 
as well as TC-core puncta cotrafficking with vesicle-associated 
membrane protein (VAMP) (refs. 32, 33, and Supplemental Figure 
1B). AP2-associated TC-core puncta motility was reduced significantly upon mutation (Y136A) of a YxxΦ motif within core, a motif 
critical for AP2 binding and HCV assembly (22), as measured by 
the overall distance traveled (Figure 1I and Supplemental Video 
4). These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a role 
of clathrin-associated APs in mediating intracellular virus trafficking. Specifically, these imaging data combined with our current 
and previous characterization of the roles of AP1 and AP2 in the 
life cycle of HCV (22, 23) support the hypothesis that AP1 cotraffics with HCV during viral release, while AP2 cotraffics with HCV 
during viral entry and subsequently to the sites of assembly.
To understand whether drug modulation of AP phosphorylation by AAK1 and GAK manifests itself in an intracellular trafficking defect, we studied the effect of sunitinib and erlotinib, 
approved drugs with potent anti-AAK1 and/or anti-GAK activity, 
on HCV particle trafficking by live cell imaging. Treatment of 
HCV-infected cells with sunitinib and erlotinib reduced motility 
of TC-core puncta cotrafficking with AP1 and AP2 (Figure 1J and

least 2 experiments. Shown in B, C, and F are means ± SD. Individual experiments in B–E and F had 5–10 and 2 biological replicates, respectively.

To determine whether DENV can escape treatment with sunitinib and erlotinib, we passaged DENV in the presence of sunitinib/erlotinib combination or the DENV nonstructural (NS) 4B 
protein inhibitor SDM25N at increasing concentrations (0.5–2.5 
μM) corresponding to values between EC50 and EC90. Infectious virus output was quantified over several passages by plaque 
assays. By passage 8, DENV4 overcame inhibition by SDM25N 
with the emergence of a previously characterized resistance mutation in NS4B (P101L, analogous to P104L in DENV2) (36). In contrast, DENV4 was cleared from the culture by passage 6 under the 
sunitinib/erlotinib treatment without any phenotypic resistance 
(Figure 3F). These results point to sunitinib/erlotinib combination 
as a potential anti-DENV strategy with a higher relative barrier to 
resistance than a direct-acting antiviral.
Broad-spectrum activity of sunitinib and erlotinib. Next, we 
studied the effect of sunitinib and erlotinib on replication of 2 
additional flaviviruses, West Nile virus (WNV) and ZIKV. Sunitinib dose-dependently inhibited both WNV and ZIKV by focusformation and plaque assays with EC50 of 0.51–0.55 μM, whereas 
erlotinib demonstrated some efficacy only against ZIKV with EC50
of 6.28 μM (Supplemental Figure 4, A and B, and Table 1).
We also investigated whether EBOV, a member of an unrelated 
viral family (Filoviridae), whose entry depends on AP1 and AP2 
activity (18, 37–39), may be similarly dependent on AAK1 and GAK. 
To test this hypothesis, we silenced AAK1 and GAK expression in 
Vero cells (Figure 4A) and measured infection of vesicular stomatitis virus encapsidated RNA (encoding a GFP reporter gene) pseudotyped with EBOV glycoproteins (rVSV-GP EBOV). Quantification 
of GFP-positive cells at the 20-hour time point by flow cytometry 
revealed that AAK1 and GAK depletion reduced infection relative to 
NT control (Figure 4C) without impacting cell viability (Figure 4B). 
A similar level of inhibition was observed upon quantification of 
viral RNA at 3 hours after infection, highlighting a defect in the entry 
step (Supplemental Figure 5A). These data further validate AAK1 
and GAK as targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. Moreto modulate AAK1 activity as a potential treatment of neurological disorders (KD = 1 nM, IC50 < 10 nM) (Figure 2J, Supplemental 
Figure 2, and ref. 35). The isothiazolo[5,4-b]pyridines 12g and 12i 
(Figure 2K) are potent (KD = ~8 nM), selective, ATP-competitive 
GAK inhibitors capable of restricting HCV infection (28). We 
measured a dose-dependent inhibition of the DENV serotype 
2 (DENV2) infection following a 2-day drug treatment with all 4 
compounds, with half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50s) 
of 1.5–5.1 μM (Figure 2, J and K). The concentration range yielding at least 1 log reduction in viral infection showed minimal or no 
toxicity as measured by alamarBlue assays.
Together, these results validate AAK1 and GAK as regulators 
of DENV infection and point to their pharmacological inhibition 
as a potential anti-DENV strategy.
Sunitinib and erlotinib have a synergistic anti-DENV effect 
and a high genetic barrier to resistance in vitro. To determine 
whether a similar effect on DENV infection can be achieved 
with approved drugs with potent anti-AAK1 and/or anti-GAK 
activity, we treated DENV-infected cells with sunitinib and 
erlotinib (Figure 3A). Consistent with published HCV data 
(22, 23), we measured a dose-dependent inhibition of DENV2 
infection following a 2-day drug treatment with an EC50 of 0.51 
μM for sunitinib and 6.5 μM for erlotinib by luciferase assays 
(Figure 3, B and C). The concentration range yielding at least 2 
log reduction in viral infection showed minimal or no toxicity 
as measured by alamarBlue assays with half-maximal cellular 
cytotoxicities (CC50s) of 8.0 μM for sunitinib and >50 μM for 
erlotinib (Figure 3, B and C, and Table 1). Similar results were 
demonstrated by standard plaque assays (Supplemental Figure 3A). Notably, treatment with combinations of the 2 drugs 
revealed synergistic inhibition of DENV2 infection with a synergy volume of 36.7 μM2
% at the 95% CI and no synergistic toxicity (Figure 3, D and E, and Supplemental Figure 3B). Importantly, sunitinib and erlotinib also dose-dependently inhibited 
infection of DENV1, DENV3, and DENV4 (Table 1).

over, treatment of Vero cells with sunitinib and erlotinib resulted in 
a dose-dependent decrease in rVSV-GP EBOV infection measured 
by flow cytometry 20 hours after infection and entry measured by 
quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) 3 hours after 
infection (Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 5B). Although the 
effect of erlotinib measured by flow cytometry was modest relative 
to that of sunitinib, combination treatment displayed measurable 
synergy in inhibiting entry with a synergy volume of 147.05 μM2
% 
at the 95% CI and zero synergistic toxicity (Figure 4, E and F). Next, 
we tested the ability of these drugs to inhibit authentic EBOV infection in Huh7 cells. Sunitinib treatment resulted in a dose-dependent 
reduction in EBOV infection with EC50 value of 0.47 μM and CC50
greater than 10 μM, whereas erlotinib showed moderate activity 
with EC50 of 12.9 μM and no appreciable cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested (Figure 4G and Table 1).
To explore more broadly the spectrum of coverage provided by sunitinib and erlotinib, we studied their antiviral effects 
against additional unrelated viruses. Viral infection was measured in various cell lines following 3-day treatment regimens. 
We detected antiviral activity of either or both drugs against RNA 
viruses in 6 families (Table 1), including Togaviridae (e.g., chikungunya virus [CHIKV]), Arenaviridae (e.g., Junin virus [JUNV]), 
and Paramyxoviridae (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). 
These data expand the possible indications of sunitinib and/or 
erlotinib as antiviral agents beyond Flaviviridae infections, to 
other established and emerging RNA viruses.
Sunitinib/erlotinib combinations are effective in vivo. To 
address the therapeutic potential of sunitinib and erlotinib as 
antiviral agents, we tested their application in a murine model 
of dengue. We measured viral burden and mortality in an IFNα/β and IFN-γ receptor–deficient murine model of dengue on 
129/Sv (AG-129) (40, 41) and C57BL/6 (AG-B6) genetic backgrounds. In a prophylaxis model, we initiated once-daily treatment of AG-B6 mice with 30–60 mg/kg of sunitinib and erlotinib in combination or individually concurrently with DENV 
inoculation and analyzed viremia at 48 hours. The doses tested 
for each drug were at or near the equivalent of approved human 
dose as calculated based on the body surface area per the FDA’s 
guidelines (42). These doses were below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in mice and confirmed to be nontoxic in our 
dengue model (42–44). Treatment with erlotinib did not alter 
viremia, whereas sunitinib alone marginally reduced it (Figure 
5A). Consistent with our in vitro synergy results, daily administration of the combination treatment resulted in 11-fold 
reduction in viral RNA (Figure 5A). In addition, we measured 
a significant reduction of the infectious virus load by plaque 
assays in the serum as well as spleen and liver in mice treated with 30 mg/kg doses of sunitinib and erlotinib relative to 
vehicle controls (Supplemental Figure 6A). Pharmacokinetic 
analysis revealed that within the first 6 hours of administration 
each drug concentration in the serum, as measured by liquid 
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, exceeded the

data (Supplemental Figure 6B). Moreover, the synergy between

the serum by 18 hours, which is in contrast with the slower clearance rates reported in humans (44, 45), both drugs concentrate 
severalfold within tissues where DENV replicates, such as liver 
(46, 47). To maintain higher serum drug concentration, we next 
administered 30 mg/kg drug combination at 12-hour intervals 
and measured viremia. The twice-daily drug administration 
resulted in an even more apparent reduction of viral load relative to vehicle control (Figure 5B). Notably, drug administration 
reduced viral load from day 2 to 3 postinfection in contrast to an 
increase in viral load within the control arm during that time.
To assess whether the reduction in viral load would translate 
into improved disease outcome, we determined the effect of combination treatment with sunitinib and erlotinib on morbidity and 
mortality in AG-129 and AG-B6 mice. Following infection with a 
lethal DENV inoculum, we initiated once-daily drug administration at a dose sufficient to significantly reduce viremia (i.e., 30 
mg/kg of each drug). The animals were monitored twice daily 
and were euthanized when moribund (48). The experiment was

treatment proved efficacious with either i.p. or oral administration, the latter of which is approved for use in humans (Figure 5, 
C and D). We also compared the effect of daily treatment with the 
individual drugs with that of the combination. In this trial, 94% 
of vehicle-treated AG-129 mice succumbed to infection; treatment with erlotinib did not alter survival, whereas sunitinib alone 
offered partial (37%) protection. Consistent with our in vitro

Upon a 5-day drug treatment regimen given either i.p. or orally, 
we observed a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality 
of infected animals relative to vehicle controls (Figure 5, C and

infection on day 4–8 postinfection, whereas sunitinib/erlotinib

To confirm that the antiviral activity is correlated with functional inhibition of AAK1 and GAK activity, we measured levels of 
phospho-AP2 upon drug treatment. Dose-dependent reduction in 
the phospho-AP2 to total AP2 ratio was demonstrated in DENVinfected cells (Figure 6D).
Next, we conducted gain-of-function assays to further validate 
AP2, a substrate for both AAK1 and GAK, as a key mediator of the 
anti-DENV effect of these drugs. Ectopic expression of WT but not 
T156A phosphorylation AP2 mutant or vector control either partially or completely rescued the antiviral effect of sunitinib/erlotinib 
combination (Figure 6, E and F). These results indicate that AAK1- 
and GAK-mediated phosphorylation of AP2 is a mechanism underlying the antiviral effect of sunitinib and erlotinib against DENV.
Next, we determined whether these drugs exert their antiviral 
effect in vivo by similarly inhibiting phosphorylation of the AAK1 
and GAK ligand AP2. Liver tissue lysates harvested from AG-B6 
mice 3 hours after drug administration revealed dose-dependent 
inhibition of AP2 phosphorylation upon treatment with sunitinib 
and erlotinib, and most markedly with the combination (Figure 
6G). These results provide evidence that drug exposure in animals 
is associated with modulation of AP2.
These data, combined with the finding that more selective 
AAK1 and GAK inhibitors lacking affinity to most of sunitinib’s 
and erlotinib’s cancer targets (e.g., VEGFR and EGFR) (28, 
35) have anti-DENV activity, indicate that AAK1 and GAK are 
important mediators of the observed antiviral effect. Nevertheless, these data cannot rule out additional potential cellular 
targets mediating the anti-DENV activity of these compounds. 
Whereas erlotinib’s target selectivity is quite narrowly focused 
on EGFR and GAK with significantly less affinity for other 
kinases, sunitinib is a multitarget kinase inhibitor (49, 50). We 
thus examined the effects of siRNA-mediated depletion of 27 
major kinases targeted by these small molecules (KD < 20 nM) 
on DENV infection and cellular viability. Using a cutoff of greater than 50% inhibition of viral infection as measured by luciferase assays normalized to cell viability in 2 independent screens, 
we identified AXL, KIT, and RET as possible antiviral targets of 
our kinase inhibitors in addition to AAK1 and GAK (Figure 6H). 
However, silencing of KIT also substantially reduced cellular 
viability (Supplemental Figure 7).
Taken together, our data indicate that inhibition of AP-mediated intracellular membrane trafficking regulated by AAK1 and 
GAK represents an important mechanism by which sunitinib and 
erlotinib inhibit DENV infection in vitro and in vivo and that additional mechanisms, potentially mediated by other kinases, may 
act in concert.
Discussion
Clathrin-associated AP1 and AP2 complexes have been implicated 
in orchestrating multiple viral infections; however, their precise 
mechanistic involvement was not characterized. Moreover, the 
relevance of AAK1 and GAK, kinase regulators of these APs that 
we discovered as essential for HCV infection, to other viral infections remained unknown. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap 
and evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting AAK1 and 
GAK as a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy. Integrating RNAi, 
dominant interfering, pharmacological and molecular virology 
mortality with combination drug treatment (Figure 5E). Furthermore, even when the combination drug treatment was initiated at 
various time points after infection, the mice remained protected 
relative to vehicle control, albeit mice treated at 48 hours after 
inoculation eventually succumbed to infection (Figure 5F).
Given the observed potency of sunitinib and sunitinib/erlotinib combination against EBOV infection in vitro, we assessed in 
vivo efficacy of these drugs in a murine model of Ebola. Drugs were 
administered daily i.p. for 10 days beginning at 6 hours before infection. As with the dengue model, the chosen doses were at or near the 
equivalent of approved human dose, below the MTD in mice, and 
confirmed to be nontoxic in our Ebola model. All mice demonstrated 
signs of morbidity as evident by weight loss during the first 7–10 days 
after infection (Figure 5G). Ninety percent of vehicle-treated mice 
succumbed to infection on days 6–13 postinfection; treatment with 
erlotinib at 45 mg/kg did not alter animal survival, whereas 5 mg/
kg sunitinib alone increased survival to 30% (Figure 5H). Consistent 
with our in vitro synergy results, we observed the greatest weight 
gain and survival (50%) with a combination drug treatment.
Together, these results demonstrate therapeutic potential of 
sunitinib/erlotinib combinations against infections with 2 unrelated emerging RNA viruses.
Mechanisms underlying the antiviral effects of sunitinib and erlotinib in vitro and in vivo. To better understand the target(s) and 
mechanism of action underlying the anti-DENV activity of sunitinib and erlotinib, we first probed the steps of the viral life cycle 
affected by these compounds. We detected interference precisely 
with the steps inhibited via siRNAs against AAK1 and GAK (Figure 
2, G and I), namely entry and infectious DENV production (Figure 
6, A–C). Notably, DENV RNA replication, a step commonly inhibited by direct-acting antivirals (7), was not affected by these drugs. 
This phenotype supports a hypothesis that inhibition of AAK1 and 
GAK likely contributes to the anti-DENV effect of these drugs.
Figure 7. Model: AAK1 and GAK in infection and as broad-spectrum antiviral targets. Host kinases AAK1 and GAK regulate entry, assembly, and/or 
release of multiple RNA viruses through phosphorylation of the membrane 
trafficking adaptors AP1 (pink) and AP2 (purple). Sunitinib, erlotinib, and 
selective inhibitors of AAK1 and GAK disrupt these temporally distinct 
steps of the viral life cycle and act as broad-spectrum antivirals.

antiviral activity correlates with reduced AP2 phosphorylation in 
tissues upon drug treatment. These findings reveal that a block in 
AP2 phosphorylation mechanistically explains at least in part the 
antiviral effect of AAK1 and GAK inhibitors. These findings also 
present AP2 phosphorylation as a useful pharmacodynamic biomarker in potential future clinical studies. We further demonstrate 
that sunitinib and erlotinib reduce HCV-AP1 and -AP2 cotrafficking by live cell imaging, thereby validating this mode of action at 
the molecular level. While AP-mediated intracellular membrane 
trafficking likely represents a primary mechanism by which AAK1 
and GAK regulate viral infection, additional substrates of these 
kinases, such as NUMB, also may contribute to this function (23).
We explore the possible involvement of additional targets with 
KD’s of 20 nM or less reported for sunitinib and erlotinib using a 
siRNA library against 27 kinases. Our siRNA screen reveals that 
none of the other major targets of erlotinib beyond GAK, namely 
EGFR and STK10, affect DENV infection. In contrast, at least 3 
additional targets of sunitinib beyond AAK1, namely AXL, KIT, 
and RET, may facilitate DENV infection and thus potentially 
also mediate sunitinib’s antiviral effect. AXL is an already known 
attachment factor/signaling receptor for multiple RNA viruses, 
including DENV, EBOV, and possibly ZIKV (52–55). Although confirmatory studies with AXL-deficient cells are required, inhibition 
of AXL by sunitinib may contribute to its effect on DENV entry. 
KIT and RET are paralogs with no reported roles in RNA viral 
infections and await further investigation. Given our inability to 
silence expression of KIT without a substantial negative impact on 
cell viability (likely due to its role in cell survival and proliferation; 
ref. 56), its specific relevance to DENV infection remains unclear. 
Overall, our data underscore the utility of using sunitinib and 
erlotinib as pharmacological probes to identify novel host factors 
required for viral infection.
We speculate that inhibition of AAK1 and GAK accounts for 
these drugs’ effect against a broad spectrum of viruses, particularly those previously shown to depend on AP1 and AP2 activity, 
such as EBOV (18, 37–39). Inhibition of additional kinases including AXL, KIT, and RET may play a role. Though most of the EC50
values we report fall in the low micromolar range for the 6 viral 
families tested (Table 1), the relative potency of sunitinib and erlotinib varies between the different viral species. Such differences 
can be attributed to both variations in the assays used and the 
likely distinct dependence on the various host factors targeted by 
these inhibitors in the life cycle of different viruses. Other mechanisms of action, such as modulation of immune responses, also 
could contribute to the protective phenotype observed in vivo.
Although toxicity is a concern when targeting host functions, finding a safe therapeutic window may be feasible. Sunitinib and erlotinib 
each are approved as a once-daily oral treatment for multiple cancers 
at doses comparable to those exhibiting antiviral activity in vivo. A 
combination therapy already has been evaluated clinically and was 
tolerated, albeit with an increase in the adverse events primarily related to gastrointestinal disturbances (57, 58). However, a shift from the 
long-term treatment of cancer to acute infection such as with DENV 
should improve tolerance and minimize adverse effects. The safety 
and efficacy of sunitinib and/or erlotinib will be evaluated in dengue 
patients in the near future and potentially in patients with EBOV disease in future outbreaks (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02380625).
approaches, we demonstrate roles for AP1 and AP2 complexes as 
well as AAK1 and GAK in entry and assembly/release of Flaviviridae family members and validate these host factors as attractive 
targets for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy (Figure 7). We establish that sunitinib and erlotinib inhibit DENV and EBOV infections 
in vitro and in vivo, and are potent in vitro against WNV, ZIKV, 
and RNA viruses from 4 additional families: Togaviridae, Arenaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Retroviridae. Together, our data 
illustrate the utility of these 2 clinically approved compounds both 
as tools to identify host factors important in viral infection and as 
potential therapies against emerging viral infections.
Using advanced live cell imaging, we provide the first direct 
evidence, to our knowledge, that viral particles cotraffic intracellularly with AP complexes. Our imaging findings exclude a theory 
whereby AP complexes contribute to viral infections solely by 
recruiting or mediating intracellular traffic of host cargo components essential for the viral life cycle.
We show that sunitinib and erlotinib, potent, albeit nonselective, inhibitors of AAK1 and GAK, respectively, restrict DENV and 
EBOV infections in vitro and their combination reduces viremia, 
morbidity, and mortality in the relevant murine models. Replication assays demonstrating efficacy against viral species in 6 
unrelated families (Table 1) further support our broad-spectrum 
hypothesis, though in vivo efficacy beyond dengue and Ebola 
remains to be tested. AAK1 and GAK have partially overlapping 
functions (12, 23), which may explain moderate antiviral effect in 
vitro with either sunitinib or erlotinib, yet synergistic activity upon 
treatment with both. The synergy also may result from inhibition 
of additional targets by these compounds. Although the observed 
reduction in DENV load was relatively modest in mice, it correlated with a significant survival benefit, comparable to the report on 
host α-glucosidase inhibitor celgosivir (51), which yielded 100% 
protection from mortality with less than 10-fold reduction in viremia. Importantly, the sunitinib/erlotinib combination remained 
protective in the mouse model of dengue even when administered 
after established infection, thereby supporting its promise as both 
prophylaxis and therapy.
We provide multiple lines of evidence to support modulation 
of AAK1 and GAK activity as an important mode of antiviral action 
of sunitinib and erlotinib in the dengue model. We demonstrate 
that these drugs inhibit both DENV entry and infectious virus production, analogous to the phenotype seen with RNAi-mediated 
suppression of clathrin-associated APs and AAK1 and GAK. Additionally, we demonstrate antiviral effects of more selective AAK1 
and GAK inhibitors. Due to lack of affinity to most of sunitinib’s 
and erlotinib’s cancer targets (e.g., VEGFR and EGFR) (28, 35), the 
activity of the selective compounds further confirms that AAK1 
and GAK are relevant antiviral targets. While the more selective 
GAK inhibitors also bind KIT, more work is required to validate 
whether KIT is an anti-DENV target. Furthermore, we characterized the mechanism by which the pharmacological inhibition of 
AAK1 and GAK mediates the anti-dengue effect. We establish that 
antiviral activity of sunitinib and erlotinib correlates with reduced 
phospho-AP2 levels in vitro. In accordance with this observation, 
we show that WT but not a phosphorylation AP2 mutant can rescue the anti-dengue effect of these drugs. We provide evidence 
that this mechanism also plays a role in vivo by demonstrating that

strategies challenges the design of broadly effective direct-acting 
antivirals; however, a host-targeted approach could circumvent 
this issue. Sunitinib and erlotinib inhibit all 4 DENV serotypes. 
Moreover, a broad-spectrum therapy, such as with sunitinib/
erlotinib combination, could be used to treat DENV-CHIKV (59, 
60) or DENV-ZIKV (61) coinfections and infections with newly 
emerging RNA viruses. It also can be administered even before 
an accurate diagnosis of a viral threat, thereby increasing protection. Furthermore, although viral resistant mutations can emerge 
during treatment with host-targeted approaches (62), targeting 
of host proteins that are not under the genetic control of viruses 
is more likely to have a higher barrier to resistance than classical 
direct-acting antivirals. This is exemplified by our data and treatment with cyclophilin inhibitors (63). We recognize, however, that 
our dengue resistance assay is somewhat limited by the shortterm virus passage. Although we predict that the genetic barrier 
to resistance is high, it may be possible to select for resistance over 
longer-term passage under different conditions or in a different, 
chronic infection model. Lastly, viruses use strategies similar to 
those of cancer cells for overcoming drug-mediated inhibition. 
Simultaneous inhibition of several kinases or targeting of several 
pathways by the same drug or drug combination may prove attractive in combating viral pathogens, as previously shown in cancer 
(64). Such “polypharmacology” by a single drug could increase 
the effectiveness while minimizing viral resistance.
In summary, our study serves as a proof of concept for the 
feasibility of identifying novel host-targeted broad-spectrum antiviral therapies via both repurposing and development of novel 
chemical entities. Such approaches may provide additive and possibly synergistic effects in combination with other strategies being 
developed to combat emerging viral infections.

Live cell imaging. Huh7.5 cells were infected with concentrated 
HCV TC-core (32) at MOI of 1 for 24 hours, then transfected with 
either AP1- or AP2-mCherry using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 
and seeded onto collagen-coated 35-mm fluorodishes (World Precision Instruments). At 72 hours after infection, cells were labeled with 
biarsenical dye (1.25 μM) in Opti-MEM at 37°C for 30 minutes, then 
washed 3 times with 1X BAL (2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol) wash buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 500 μM 1,2-ethanedithiol in OptiMEM. The cells were washed and incubated in prewarmed imaging 
media (DMEM-F12; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 mM 
nonessential amino acids, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 mM 
HEPES. When specified, TC-core–infected cells were incubated with 
DMSO, sunitinib (4 μM), or erlotinib (10 μM) beginning at 24 hours 
after infection. Time-lapse images were taken using a Leica SP5 II 
AOBS Tandem Scanner Spectral confocal microscope with a ×100 
1.46 oil objective and a heated (37°C) chamber. An average of 5 movies representing individual cells with 15–30 trackable puncta each 
were recorded per sample with sequential frames taken every 2 seconds. Individual core puncta run lengths and transport velocities were 
calculated using the Manual Tracking plug-in for ImageJ, measuring 
the distance traveled (in any direction) between frames for a respective TC-core puncta.

from the resulting supernatants was titered by plaque assays. SDM25N

 PFU produced in C6/36 cells) was inoculated 
retro-orbitally into mice under general and local anesthesia. Drugs 
were administered at the indicated doses in a total volume of 100–200 
μl per animal using 10% Captisol as vehicle. Drugs or vehicle were 
administered i.p. or orally once or twice daily starting at the time of 
inoculation or at various time points after inoculation for a total of 
3–5 days. Mice were monitored twice daily until the conclusion of the 
experiment. Moribund animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide 
inhalation. Serum was isolated from whole blood harvested retroorbitally at 48 or 72 hours after DENV inoculation under general and 
local anesthesia. Tissues were harvested following euthanasia and 
snap-frozen on dry ice until further analysis.
In vivo Ebola studies. Groups of 10 female C57BL/6 mice (8–12 
weeks of age) purchased from Jackson Laboratory were treated with 
drugs or vehicle 6 hours before viral challenge. Erlotinib and sunitinib 
poration of RNA into BHK-21 cells, harvesting of supernatants at day 
10, and titering via standard plaque assays on BHK-21 cells. In parallel, on day 2 after electroporation, DENV-containing supernatant was 
used to inoculate C6/36 cells to amplify the virus. For in vivo experiments, DENV supernatant was concentrated 100-fold by centrifugation at 50,000 g. rVSV-GP EBOV was propagated and titered on Vero 
cells via fluorescent-focus assay (69).
Entry assays. Huh7.5 cells were infected with HCVpp (71, 72) and 
8 μg/ml Polybrene for 4 hours. Firefly luciferase activity was measured at 48–72 hours after infection. DENV2 entry was measured at 
6 hours after infection of Huh7 cells by monitoring of Renilla luciferase activity. Luminescence was detected on InfiniteM1000 plate 
reader (Tecan). Vero cells were infected with rVSV-GP EBOV for 3 
hours, total RNA was harvested and reverse transcribed, and EBOV 
GP transcript was quantified by real-time PCR and normalized to 
GAPDH expression.
Infection assays. Huh7 cells were infected with DENV or ZIKV in 
replicates (n = 3–10) for 4 hours at MOI of 0.01. Overall infection was 
measured either at 48 hours using a Renilla luciferase substrate or 
at 72 hours by plaque assays. Vero cells were infected with rVSV-GP 
EBOV for 4 hours and washed. At 20 hours after infection, cells were 
fixed with 4% formaldehyde and analyzed on an LSR II cytometer (BD 
Biosciences) using FITC channel. Data were processed using FlowJo 
software. EBOV infection was carried out under biosafety level 4 conditions. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were formalin-fixed, 
and infection was measured by immunofluorescence using KZ52 
anti-EBOV antibody in an Operetta HCS using the Harmony software 
package. Other viral infection assays, conducted by the Diamond lab 
(WNV), IBT Bioservices (CHIKV, RSV, JUNV), and the NIH/National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (others), were performed 
as summarized in Table 1.
RNA replication assays. HCV RNA replication was measured 72 
hours after electroporation, as previously described (22). DENV2 replication assays were performed as previously described (34). Briefly, 
Huh7 cells were transfected with DNA-launched DENV2 replicon, 
pCMV-DV2Rep along with TET-ON plasmids. Thirty-six hours after 
transfection, viral RNA transcription was induced by doxycycline and 
shut down by changing to doxycycline-free medium 6 hours later. Replication was monitored by luciferase activity every day for 3 days. Data 
were normalized to activity at 24 hours after induction.
Infectious virus production. Infectious HCV or DENV production 
(i.e., extracellular infectivity) was measured in culture supernatants of 
cells electroporated with viral RNA for 48–72 hours and used to infect 
naive cells for 48 hours. Intracellular HCV infectivity was measured 
by inoculation of naive cells with lysates of electroporated cells subjected to 4 rounds of free-thawing and clarified at 5,000 g, as previously described (22).
Pharmacological inhibition. For entry assays, cells were pretreated 
with the inhibitors or DMSO for 1 hour before and for the duration of 
the infection, followed by replacement with drug-free medium. For 
the overall infection, RNA replication, or infectious virus production 
assays, inhibitors were left in for the duration of the study.
Gain-of-function assays. WT or T156A AP2 or empty vector control was expressed ectopically in Huh7 cells by lentiviral transduction. 
Twenty-four hours after transduction, cells were pretreated with sunitinib and erlotinib, infected with luciferase reporter DENV at MOI of 
0.01, and incubated for 72 hours prior to luciferase and viability assays.

were administered i.p. at the indicated doses in a total volume of 200 
μl using 10% Captisol as vehicle. A group of 10 mice was left untreated 
to allow for interpretation of any survival seen in the vehicle-treated 
group. Mice were inoculated i.p. with 100 PFU of mouse-adapted 
EBOV. Mice were then treated once daily for a total of 10 days and 
observed daily for 28 days for lethality or clinical signs of disease.
RNA extraction and quantification. Total RNA from cells was 
isolated using an RNA purification kit (Macherey-Nagel). Mouse 
serum was purified from whole blood using Terumo Capiject Capillary Blood collection tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tissues were 
homogenized using 0.9- to 2-mm stainless steel beads in a BBX24 
Bullet Blender homogenizer (NextAdvance). Total RNA from serum 
and tissues was extracted with QIAamp UltraSens Virus kit (Qiagen). 
cDNA was generated using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen). DENV RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR using 
TaqMan GEX master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and AAK1, 
GAK, EBOV GP, and housekeeping gene (GAPDH) RNA was quantified using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a 
StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Primer 
and probe sequences are as follows: DENV2 forward, GAGAGCAGATCTCTGATGAATAA; DENV2 reverse, ACTGTTGCACAGTCGACAC; DENV2 probe, TATGCTGAAACGCGAGAGAAACCGC; GAPDH forward, GAAATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAG; GAPDH reverse, 
GAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCATG.
Viability assays. Viability was assessed using alamarBlue reagent 
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Fluorescence 
was detected at 560 nm on an InfiniteM1000 plate reader (Tecan).
Data analysis of combination drug treatment. Synergy/antagonism 
analysis was performed using the MacSynergy II program as previously 
described (23, 73). Matrix data sets in 4 replicates were assessed at the 
95% confidence level for each experiment. Synergy and log volume 
were calculated. As suggested by Prichard et al. (73), such data sets 
should be interpreted as follows: volumes of synergy or antagonism at 
values less than 25 μM2
% are insignificant, those of 25–50 μM2% are 
minor but significant, those of 50–100 μM2
% are moderate and probably important in vivo, and those of greater than 100 μM2
% are strong 
and likely to be important in vivo.
Statistics. All data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. 
Fifty percent effective concentrations (EC50) were measured by fitting of 
data to a 3-parameter logistic curve. P values were calculated by 2-tailed 
unpaired t test and 1- or 2-way ANOVA with either Dunnett’s or Tukey’s 
multiple comparisons tests for in vitro data sets and by Mann-Whitney 
test for in vivo data sets as specified in each figure legend. Survival curve 
P values were calculated by log-ranked Mantel-Cox test.
Study approval. Animal research was conducted under a protocol 
approved by Stanford’s IACUC (Administrative Panel on Laboratory 
Animal Care) and its Institutional Biosafety Committee (Administrative Panel on Biosafety) or by the US Army Medical Research Institute 
of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) IACUC in compliance with the 
Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals. The Stanford and 
USAMRIID animal facilities are AAALAC-accredited and adhere to
