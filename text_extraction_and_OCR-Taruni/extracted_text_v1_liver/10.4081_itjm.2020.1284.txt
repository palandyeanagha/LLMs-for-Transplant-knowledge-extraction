Introduction
In December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases
occurred in Wuhan, China, caused by a newly identified coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). This coronavirus
rapidly spread to China and other countries causing a
global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a β-coronavirus,
virus that can lead to serious and potentially fatal respiratory tract infections. It was found that the genomic
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% of the identity
with the SARS-CoV responsible for the epidemic in
2003. It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 could use
the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2), the
same receptor as SARS-CoV, to infect humans and
penetrate cells.
Clinical characteristics of patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2
Based on ongoing epidemiological investigations,
the incubation period of the virus is 1-14 days, mostly
3-7 days. SARS-CoV-2 is contagious during the latency period. Based on the knowledge acquired during
these months the infection has been divided into three
phases, the first asymptomatic or with mild symptoms,
the second and third characterized by hyperactive inflammatory state responsible for lung lesions and that
in some patients can rapidly develop acute respiratory
distress syndrome, respiratory failure, multiple organ
failure, and even death. 
The most common clinical manifestations
recorded in the three stages of infection are fever,
cough, fatigue, dyspnea, sore throat. In addition, some
patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as
diarrhea and vomiting.
Elderly people or those with underlying diseases
(e.g. hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) are at greater
risk of rapidly developing acute respiratory distress
syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and clotting dysfunction, which quickly lead to death. Laboratory tests vary depending on the stages of infection,
in the most severe stages neutrophil count, D-dimer,
blood urea and creatinine are significantly higher and

ABSTRACT
For some patients with SARS-CoV-2, the worst clinical damage is not caused by the virus itself, but by an overactive inflammatory state. In fact, in some people the immune system goes into overdrive and launches a large-scale assault on the tissue
known as cytokine storm. This excessive inflammatory/immune reaction can damage tissue and eventually kill people. Evidence
shows that blocking such cytokine storms can be effective and trials are under way to test drugs that act by reducing cytokine
response, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab which bind interleukin 6 (IL-6), or anakinra which is the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1). However, other drugs that block the cytokine cascade can also be considered. In this article we describe the scientific and molecular motivation for the use of drugs that act by modulating the hyperactive inflammatory system in severe
patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2, considering in particular an old drug that has been in use for many years for other therapeutic indications such as colchicine, and that could be favorable to its use, with low cost and good tolerability.

the lymphocyte count is low. In addition, inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-10, IL-1 increase, indicating the
altered inflammatory and immune status of the patients. Data also showed that patients have higher
plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, the granulocyte colony
stimulation factor (GCSF). 
The disease tends to progress more rapidly in older
people, with a shorter median number of days among
people aged 65 years or older, from the onset of the
first symptoms until death. Infants and the elderly
need more attention and care because of their immature or weak immune system.1-6
Inflammatory cytokine storm in patients
with severe SARS-CoV-2
Phase two and three of the infection are characterized by a hyperactive inflammatory state that can result in a cytokine storm (CS). CS refers to the
excessive and uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The syndrome can be caused by a variety of diseases, including infectious diseases,
rheumatic diseases and cancer immunotherapy such
as CAR-T. Clinically, it presents as systemic inflammation, multiple organ failure and elevated inflammatory parameters. In infectious diseases, CS usually
originates from the infected focal zone, spreading
throughout the body through circulation. The accumulation of evidence has revealed that a percentage of
patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 have a high cytokine profile similar to CS. Studies have reported the
level of inflammatory factors in patients with SARSCoV-2 during CS, cytokine levels in 41 hospitalized
patients (including 13 intensive care and 28 non-intensive care patients), IL-1, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), granulocyte and
macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
IFNγ, tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly increased, including IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, G-CSF, TNFα
were higher in severe patients. Several other studies
confirmed increased levels of IL-6 in severe SARSCoV-2 patients. One study analyzed lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in 123 patients, all patients had
lymphocytopenia, the percentage of reduction in CD8
+ T lymphocytes was 28.43% and 61.9% in mild and
severe groups respectively, and the reduction in NK
cells was 34.31% and 47.62% in mild and severe
groups respectively. 
In addition, serum levels of IL-6 in the severe
group were significantly higher than in the mild group.
It is possible that CS aggravates lung damage and
leads to other fatal complications. At this stage, the
markers of systemic inflammation therefore appear to
be extremely high. Therefore, blocking CS and knowing when to start anti-inflammatory therapy is essential to reduce the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2.
Probably in phase one of the infection the inflammatory/immune response is important to fight the virus,
in phase two and three a multi-organ systemic inflammation is probably responsible for the worsening of
the health condition, in these phases, therefore, it
could be useful to act with CS blocking agents.6-20
Therapeutic approaches to reduce cytokine
storm
Based on the above, new strategies to attenuate
inflammatory responses are likely to improve clinical
outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients in stages two and
three of infection. Here we describe the agents that
have the potential to reduce inflammation and CS
virus-induced. Undoubtedly, antiviral and supportive
treatments are very important. The CS is relatively
common in severe cases and often leads to fatal lung
lesions, anti-inflammatory therapy can help prevent
these damages. As we know, there is a variety of antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
glucocorticoids, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine,
immunosuppressants, cytokine inflammatory antagonists (such as IL-6 inhibitor monoclonal antibodies,
TNF inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitors). Evidence suggests that the use of immunomodulatory agents reduces systemic
inflammation before causing multi-organ dysfunction. At this stage, the use of corticosteroids may also
be justified in combination with the use of cytokine
inhibitors such as tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) or
anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist). However, is there
a dilemma of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapy? If so, when and at what doses? All
these questions are still the subject of intense debate
and do not reach a consensus. The main concern is
that anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory drugs,
such as corticosteroid, may delay the elimination of
the virus and increase the risk of secondary infections,
especially in those with compromised immune systems. Second, biological agents targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit a specific
inflammatory factor, and therefore may not be very
effective in stopping CS in SARS-CoV-2, where other
cytokines may be of significant importance. Finally,
the time window of anti-inflammatory treatment is
very important. According to the evidence, severe patients usually suffered a sharp deterioration in 1-2
weeks after the onset of infection, early initiation of
anti-inflammatory therapy in this extremely short
time window is likely to achieve a favorable response
to treatment and avoid a worsening of the condition.
During the SARS epidemic in 2003, glucocorticoid
was the main drug of immunomodulatory therapy.
However, some studies have shown no beneficial ef-

fect with glucocorticoid in SARS-Cov-2 infection
leading to deterioration of the disease. In addition,
there is no evidence of randomized clinical trials supporting glucocorticoid treatment for SARS-CoV-2.
However, some evidence indicates that the benefit of
glucocorticoid use is likely to outweigh the adverse
effect. Among the interleukin inhibitors that have
shown some evidence of efficacy there are IL-6 inhibitors. Tocilizumab is an antibody that binds specifically to IL-6 thus blocking its signaling and
inflammatory mediated response. Tocilizumab is
widely used in rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis and on August 30, 2017, Tocilizumab was approved in the United States for severe life-threatening
cytokine release syndrome caused by chimeric immunotherapy of T cell antigen receptors (CAR-T).
Recent trials demonstrate the efficacy of Tocilizumab
in the treatment of phase two or three patients with
SARS-CoV-2. Together with basic anti-virus treatment, Tocilizumab was applied to 20 patients 400 mg
once intravenously. Within a few days, the fever returned to normal and the other symptoms improved
significantly. The opacity of the lung lesion on
Tocilizumab scans was absorbed in 90.5% of patients.
In addition, the percentage of peripheral lymphocytes
returned to normal in 52.6% of patients. Their data
suggest that Tocilizumab could be an effective treatment in severe SARS-CoV-2. So far, several clinical
studies have been recorded on the safety and efficacy
of Tocilizumab in the treatment of severe SARS-CoV2 pneumonia in adult hospitalized patients. To date,
several clinical trials are under way in Italy to test its
efficacy and safety in SARS-Cov-2 patients.
Chinese health authorities have approved the use
of this interleukin 6 inhibitor drug in SARS-Cov-2 patients. Sarilumab belongs to the same class. It is a
human monoclonal interleukin 6 receptor antibody for
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, it has the same
pharmacodynamic profile as tocilizumab and also
shares the same tolerability profile, and the common
side effects that occur in 1-10% of treated patients are
lung tract infections, which could be an unfortunate
factor for treatment in SARS-Cov-2 patients. Emapalumab is an anti-interferon-gamma antibody (IFNγ)
used for the treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH causes excessive secretion of
IFN-γ which contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. Emapalumab binds and neutralizes IFN-γ, preventing it from inducing pathological effects Anakinra
is a biopharmaceutical drug used for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis. It is a recombinant and slightly
modified version of the human interleukin 1 receptor
antagonist protein. It also appears to be effective in the
treatment of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS),
a form of cytokine storm. A study is currently under
way to study the efficacy and safety of Emapalumab
and Anakinra in reducing hyperinflammation and respiratory distress in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) are first-line drugs for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and are also used for the treatment
of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Some studies have reported that QC/HCQ have a
broad spectrum of antiviral effects on a variety of different viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), Marburg virus, and SARS-CoV-1. QC and
HCQ may interfere with the binding of viral particles
to the receptor of their cell surface or with the pH-dependent endosome-mediated viral input of wound
viruses to inhibit the viral cycle. They may also interfere with post-translational modification of viral proteins or compromise proper viral protein maturation
through pH modulation. In addition, CQ and HCQ can
regulate the immune system by affecting cell signaling
and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although QC or HCQ are often used for the treatment
of rheumatic diseases due to its immunomodulatory
and anti-inflammatory effects, the benefit in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 can be attributed primarily to
its antiviral effects. Recently, CQ and HCQ have been
demonstrated in several studies to reduce the viral load
of SARS-CoV-2 and shorten the duration of viremia.
Whether their immunomodulatory effect also plays a
role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 still requires further investigation.21-44
Colchicine
One drug that could perhaps add value to counteract SARS-Cov-2 CS is colchicine. 
Colchicine is used for the treatment of gout, Behçet’s disease, prevention and treatment of pericarditis
and family Mediterranean fever, Sweet syndrome,
scleroderma, and amyloidosis. Perhaps the most effective results of colchicine treatment have been obtained in family prophylaxis of Mediterranean fever.
The scientific hypothesis of the use of colchicine in
SARS-CoV-2 is based on the anti-inflammatory properties of the drug and on the already widely demonstrated efficacy of familial Mediterranean fever and in
pericarditis, considering that these diseases also
demonstrate a phase of hyperactivation of the inflammatory system. Recently published data on colchicine
seem to suggest a potential synergism in the treatment
at different trigger point levels of cytokine storm. In
fact, colchicine acts by decreasing inflammation
through multiple mechanisms. The main mechanism
of action is to bind the tubulin molecule and thus inhibit its polymerization. In particular, its anti-inflammatory effect has been attributed to the decomposition
of microtubules into neutrophils thus inhibiting their
[page 90] [Italian Journal of Medicine 2020; 14:1284]

migration. Furthermore, colchicine can also alter the
distribution of adhesion molecules on the surface of
both neutrophils and endothelial cells, leading to a significant inhibition of the interaction between white
blood cells and endothelial cells interfering with their
transmigration. Therefore, there is growing evidence
that the anti-inflammatory effect of colchicine is multifaceted. Probably the main mechanism of action for
cytokine reduction in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is
the inhibition of IL-1, IL-6 and IL-18 interfering with
the inflammatory protein complex NLRP3, a factor increasingly recognized for its role especially in recurrent idiopathic pericarditis and Mediterranean fever
(Figure 1).
In addition, colchicine accumulates in white blood
cells and affects them in various ways: by decreasing
motility, loosening chemotaxis and adhesion, it inhibits the production of superoxide anions, interrupts
the degranulation of mast cells. It is important to note
that studies have shown that viroporin E, a component
of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV),
forms Ca2C-permeable ion channels and activates
NLRP3 inflammation. In addition, another viroporin
3a has been shown to induce activation of NLRP3 inflammation. The mechanisms are unclear. Colchicine
counteracts the increased inflammation of NLRP3,
thus reducing the release of IL-1b and a number of
other interleukins, including IL-6, the added value of
this drug compared to IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors is that it
acts upstream of the cascade of cytokines and not only
on one route, moreover at standard doses it shows a
good tolerability profile. Several clinical trials are currently underway to study the efficacy of colchicine in
patients with SARS-Cov-2, as shown in Table 1. In
particular, two trials are underway in Italy to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of colchicine in SARS-Cov-2
patients, the first Colchicine Counteracting Inflammation in COVID-19 Pneumonia (ColCOVID-19) and
the second entitled Treatment with colchicine of patients affected by Covid-19: a pilot Study.

Conclusions
Inflammation is an indispensable part of an effective immune response, without which it is difficult to
successfully eliminate an infectious agent. The inflammatory response begins with the initial recognition of
a pathogen, which then mediates the recruitment of
immune cells, eliminates the pathogens and ultimately
leads to tissue repair and return to homeostasis. However, some viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 induce an excessive and prolonged cytokine response, known as
cytokine storms, which results in high morbidity and
mortality due to immunopathology. Therefore, therapeutic interventions targeting these pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines could be useful to improve
undesirable inflammatory responses. In addition, since
high viral titers in the early and later stages of infection are strongly related to the severity of the disease
in humans, strategies to control viral load and attenuate the inflammatory response may be useful. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 is a viral infectious disease that
mainly manifests itself in fever and pneumonia, and
antiviral therapies are certainly the mainstream, but
we believe that treatments that reduce the cytokine response may be effective especially for more severe
cases. In this way, biological agents targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines can only inhibit a specific inflammatory factor, and therefore may not be very
effective in stopping CS in SARS-CoV-2 where other
cytokines may be of significant importance. The
colchicine could result in a therapeutic treatment that
acts upstream of the cytokine cascade in IL-6 and IL1, bringing more benefits, it is also low-cost and if
used at the right doses with a good tolerability profile.
Furthermore, there is a fundamental aspect to add, biological drugs (such as tocilizumab, sarilumab etc.)
can, with reference to the RCP and evidence of the
drugs, cause with a common frequency secondary infections of the respiratory tract and, therefore, paradoxically compromise the clinical situation of patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2, therefore clinical evidence is needed to clarify their possible use and on
which target of SARS-CoV-2 patients. For colchicine,
however, with reference to the RCP, clinical study and
pharmacovigilance data, the risk of upper respiratory
tract infections may not be an issue. However, data on
the viral nature of SARS-CoV-2 and considering substantial damage to the host’s immune system in severe
cases, it is essential to balance the risk/benefit before
starting anti-inflammatory therapy. Furthermore, the
early anti-inflammatory treatment started at the right
time is of fundamental importance and should be
adapted to the individual patient to get the most out of
it, however this would be an interesting area for future
research, and data deriving from ongoing clinical studies will respond to our questions.
