Summary and conclusions
A collaborative study including centres in the United
Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand was instituted
in 1970 to determine the incidence of cancer in patients
treated for at least three months with azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil. Follow-up of 3823
renal transplant recipients showed an almost 60-fold
increase of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma together with an
excess of squamous-cell skin cancer and mesenchymal
tumours. A series of 1349 patients without transplants
showed an excess of the same tumours, though to a less
extent.
These preliminary findings provide no clear evidence
that immunosuppressive drugs produce the increased
risk of most of the common cancers that might be
expected from the simplest interpretation of impaired
"immunosurveillance."
Introduction
In 1970 a study was instituted with the support of the Cancer
Research Campaign to investigate the incidence of cancer in
patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. This was

prompted by the great interest in "immunosurveillance,"
a concept that had been formulated by Thomas' and developed
by Burnet2-namely, that cancer had its earliest beginnings
in aberrant cells that were normally eliminated by the immune
system. Support for this was adduced from work on animals,
but human data were scanty until immunosuppressive drugs
began to be used on a large scale in renal transplantation and
for various medical disorders. It then became possible to see
whether drugs that impaired immunological function favoured
the development of cancer in man.
By 1970 the number of cases of reticulum-cell sarcoma
reported in renal transplant recipients suggested that these
patients experienced a substantially increased risk of this type of
malignancy.3 4 It was not known, however, whether the
incidences of other types of cancer were also increased and
whether any excess risk was associated with immunosuppressive
treatment in the absence of foreign antigens in organ transplants.
Since such questions could be answered only by assembling a
large number of suitable cases for follow-up, a collaborative
group was organised consisting of the directors of most of the
larger renal transplant units in the United Kingdom and many
nephrologists, rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, and other
physicians who were known to use immunosuppressive drugs
in their clinical practice. Shortly after the study began it was
extended through Professor Sheil and the Australasian Transplant Subcommittee to cover all transplant centres in Australia
and New Zealand. We present here the preliminary results of
this collaboration.
Methods
NOTIFICATION
Participants agreed to notify patients in whom azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil had been used for at least 12
weeks for a non-malignant disorder. Information on each patient
included date of birth, underlying disorder, name of the drug, date of
starting treatment, and, in the case of transplant recipients, source
of the graft (cadaver, mother, etc). Patients with transplants were
included from other years, since records in transplant centres
permitted complete ascertainment of eligible patients. In most
medical centres, however, notification was restricted to cases in

which immunosuppressive treatment was instituted after the study
began. Patients known to have had cancer at the time they were
eligible for entry to the study were excluded.
FOLLOW-UP
All UK patients were followed up yearly from the date of starting
treatment to see whether they were alive, still receiving immunosuppressive drugs, and free from cancer. Patients no longer under
the care of the notifying consultant were followed up through their
general practitioners or through the consultants to whose care they
had been transferred. If death had occurred or the drug had been
stopped the relevant dates were recorded as well as those of any
subsequent courses of the drugs in question. When cancer had been
diagnosed further details were requested. A copy of the death certificate was obtained for all patients who died in the UK and for all who
died after a diagnosis of cancer in Australia and New Zealand.
Follow-up information on Australian and New Zealand patients was
provided from the records of the- Australasian Transplant Subcommittee, which were updated every six months.
PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND CONTROLS
The hospital records of all patients who developed cancer, including
all tumours of the central nervous system, were examined and details
of present and past medical history and doses of immunosuppressive
drugs used extracted. For patients who had undergone transplantation, data were also extracted relating to the HLA and ABO blood
groups of recipient and donor together with possible and definite
rejection crises. For comparison similar information was obtained on
patients who had not developed malignant disease, but as there
were so many more of these this was sought for only one-eighth of the
patients, who were chosen at random. Information was not available
for all of the recent cases of cancer, and the total number of patients
with cancer in these analyses is therefore lower than those used in
analyses of mortality and incidence rates.
ANALYSIS
In the mortality analysis the observed numbers of deaths from
cancer were compared with "expected" figures obtained by
multiplying the person-years at risk for each sex and five-year age
group in each quinquennium by the corresponding age-specific and
sex-specific national mortality rates. The data were made as comparable as possible with those from which the mortality rates were
derived by recording observed deaths as due to cancer only when
death had been so attributed in the death certificate.
The observed numbers of cases of cancer in UK patients were
compared with the numbers expected from the cancer incidence
rates in the general population. The rates recorded by the Birmingham
Cancer Registry5 were taken as representative, and the Birmingham
rate for each sex in each five-year age group applied to the
corresponding number of person-years at risk.
Cancer registration had been introduced recently in one Australian
state (New South Wales) but it was not clear how representative the
data were for the whole country, and we preferred to calculate
expected figures for Australasia by applying Australian age-specific
mortality rates inflated by the corresponding ratios of incidence to
mortality rates in New Zealand, which is the most comparable

country with longstanding cancer registration. (Pilot analysis showed
that the use of separate New Zealand figures for the New Zealand
patients made only a trivial difference to the results. Analyses using
the most recent incidence data from New South Wales will be made in
future.) Expected numbers for skin cancer in Australasia could not,
however, be calculated in this way, as the New Zealand data exclude
skin cancer; nor would they, in any case, have been of any help, as the
incidence of skin cancer varies greatly with latitude.
Because the methods differed by which the study received followup information on UK and Australasian patients the period covered
by this report differs between the two groups. All Australasian patients
were followed up to 30 April 1977, whereas the UK analysis incorporates events up to the beginning of the quarter in which the
latest anniversary of starting immunosuppressive treatment occurred
before 30 September 1978.
Results
The study population falls conveniently into four groups-namely,
UK and Australasian transplant series, and UK and Australasian nontransplant series. Follow-up of the Australasian non-transplant
series, however, was incomplete and no observations on these patients
are included here. Tables Im and IIm (miniprint) give the age and
sex distribution of patients with at least one yearly follow-up in
each of the other three groups. As expected, the proportions of
patients aged under 15 and over 54 were larger in the non-transplant
series (12 6% and 25-2°( respectively) than in the transplant series
(3 80% and 4 3-) respectively).
Tables IIlm and IVm list the underlying disorders, which were
provided by the participants and varied greatly in diagnostic detail.
Only when terms such as uraemia and chronic renal failure were
used was the participant routinely asked for further information.
The large proportion of transplant recipients with "other, multiple,
and unspecified renal disorders" (table IlIm) reflects the difficulty
of making a precise single diagnosis in patients who present with
end-stage renal failure. The larger proportion of transplant recipients
with analgesic nephropathy in Australasia than in the UK may be
related to the greater prevalence of analgesic abuse in Australia,
particularly in women. In the Australasian series analgesic
nephropathy was responsible for 19 0"0 of all renal failure in women
and girls treated by transplantation; in the UK series the figure was
2 100. The paucity of such cases in the UK, however, was largely
compensated for by an excess of cases of chronic pyelonephritis
(the two diagnoses account for 19° and 18%°' of all transplant
operations in Australasia and the UK respectively), and possibly the
diagnostic criteria in the two countries differ.
In patients without transplants the most common underlying
disorders were rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions (360 )
but renal and gastrointestinal disorders were also well represented.
TRANSPLANT SERIES
Mortality
Table Vm gives the observed and expected numbers of deaths
attributed to cancer in the UK and Australasian transplant series
comoined. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (including microgliomas)
and skin cancers were considered separately because of evidence
that their incidence was likely to be increased. A 26-fold excess of
deaths from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was evident, with eight deaths
observed compared with 0 30 expected. The true excess was even
greater, as three deaths certified as due to a cerebral tumour and two
attributed to gastric cancer were, in fact, found histologically to be due
to lymphomas. The actual number of deaths from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma was therefore 13. In contrast there was no death from
Hodgkin's disease in either the UK or Australasian series (018
expected).
The only non-lymphoid cancer for which a material excess was
observed in mortality was skin cancer; three deaths were observed,
all of squamous-cell type and all in Australia, as against 033 expected,
suggesting a 10-fold increase in mortality. In Australia four other
deaths attributed to carcinomatosis or lung cancer in the death
certificate were considered clinically to be due to squamous carcinomas
of the skin with metastases in the lung and other sites. Such cases are
very uncommon in the general population. According to J Ford
(personal communication) only 0 3%' of deaths certified as due to
carcinomatosis in New South Wales were, in fact, due to skin cancer

with metastases, so the excess mortality from skin cancer was probably
much greater than that implied in table Vm.
If we exclude the nine deaths from "other" cancers that were
actually due to lymphoma or skin cancer the slight excess of deaths
attributed to cancers other than skin and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
(16 observed, 9-72 expected) is changed to a deficit. A deficit was, in
fact, to be expected if the incidence of these cancers was not influenced
by treatment, as patients had to be initially free from cancer to be
admitted to the study, whereas this restriction did not apply to the
national population, whose mortality rates were used for comparison.
Incidence of cancer
Table VI shows the numbers of cases of cancer that were observed
and expected. Skin cancer in Australasia and cervical carcinoma-insitu in both series are omitted because of the difficulty of obtaining
appropriate figures for estimating the numbers expected. The
pronounced contrast between the number of deaths from cancer
(27) and the number of cases of cancer (69) was due partly to the fact
that some patients with cancer survived to the end of the study period
and partly to the fact that some patients with cancer had another cause
certified as the underlying cause of death. Table VI shows that there
was a grossly increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34
cases observed as against 0 58 expected) and, in the UK, an excess
incidence of squamous-cell cancer of the skin (three cases observed as
against 0-13 expected). Fifteen of the 34 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas
affected the brain and presented typically as space-occupying lesions
that prompted standard investigation. The extent of the specific
increase in the risk of cerebral non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could not,
however, be measured separately, as neither incidence nor mortality
data are available for this condition in any population. It is, however,
normally so rare that the occurrence of two cases was commented on
in 1968,' and the increased risk must be enormous.
The excess of lymphomas could not be explained by tihe close
medical supervision of transplant recipients that led to a high necropsy
rate, as only six cases (18%,) were first detected post mortem.
A striking feature in table VI is the short interval between transplantation and the appearance of an excess of non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas: this was over 70-fold within two years of entry to the
study (within two years and 12 weeks of transplantation) and remained
fairly constant thereafter. Indeed, seven cases were diagnosed in the
first six months after entry, six in the second six months, and six in
the second year.
Numerically the most important tumour other than non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma was skin cancer. The implication that there is an increased
incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma in UK transplant recipients

is supported by the findings in Australasia (table VIIm). Basal-cell
carcinoma is common in Australia, and the incidence of this type of
skin cancer may not be abnormal. For squamous carcinoma, however,
the rates were so high that they cannot be typical of the general
population. If they were, over 50%' of men and 35% of women would
develop the disease by 55 years of age. Support for the conclusion
that a real increase in incidence had been produced comes from the
fact that most skin cancers in transplant recipients were squamouscell carcinomas (62°' ), whereas tumours of this type constitute a
minority of skin cancers in the general population. Virtually all
affected areas of the skin were regularly exposed to sunlight.
Other non-lymphoid cancers apart from skin cancer showed a
roughly two-fold excess (combined series, 30 cases observed as
against 17 8 expected). It has already been implied that cancer may
be detected more promptly and more completely in transplant
recipients, who are under close medical supervision, than in the
general population. Because of this and the fact that an appreciable
excess was not observed in the mortality data the excess of these other
cancers should be interpreted with caution. Types of cancer that
were detected in these patients and might have been missed in the
general population included two hypernephromas in recipients'
own kidneys that were removed after transplantation and an asymptomatic thyroid cancer found at necropsy. Two other cases that would.
have been less likely to occur in the general population were the two
renal pelvis cancers in patients with analgesic nephropathy, since a
relation between these disorders is established in the absence of
either immunosuppression or transplantation.7 Among the remaining
26 cases (compared with slightly fewer than 17 expected) some rare
types of malignancy were represented by more than one case-for
example, squamous carcinoma of the vulva (two) and mesenchymal
tumours (a rhabdomyosarcoma, a Kaposi sarcoma in a black patient
from West Africa, and a mesothelioma).
Clinicalfeatures
Most transplant recipients (including those who developed cancer)
received azathioprine continuously. The average dose given to the
UK patients who developed lymphoma was higher than that given to
the control patients, particularly during the first six months; this
difference, however, was not statistically significant (table VIIIm),
and no such difference was shown in Australasian patients (table
VIIIm). The average azathioprine dose given to the Australasian
patients was higher than that given to the UK patients. Doses, however, are normally given/kg body weight, and the Australasians may
have been heavier.
Australasian patients who developed skin cancer received on
average a significantly higher dose during the first six months than
the controls (P < 0-01). A similar but not statistically significant
difference was observed in the UK.
Information on whether antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) was given
after transplantation was not provided routinely on all Australasian
patients. Most who received it were treated at one centre, where it
was notified as having been given to 47%' of the 347 who received a
transplant. Six patients developed a lymphoma, of whom three were
notified as having had ALG. (A fourth patient with lymphoma, who

was the only one at the centre for whom no information about ALG
was notified, was found to have been given ALG when the hospital
records were searched specifically for this.) Lymphomas occurred
in two of the 130 UK patients who received ALG (relative risk 222)
and in 13 of the remaining patients who did not (relative risk 61).
The difference between these risks was not, however, significant.
Table IXm shows the number of rejection crises experienced by
control patients and those who developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
or skin cancer together with the numbers that would have been
expected if the patients with cancer had experienced the same
incidence of crises as the controls. A rejection crisis was defined as an
occasion on which at least 150 mg prednisone, or an equivalent dose
of other steroid, was given after at least five consecutive days at a

recorded by one, two, and four years after the index operation,
including the experience of each patient up to the time of diagnosis of
cancer or, in the case of controls, the time of follow-up or death.
There was no evidence that patients with lymphoma suffered more or
fewer rejection crises than those who did not develop the disease,
nor was any difference suggested when'different time periods were
examined or when 100 mg was used to define the occurrence of a
crisis. A higher proportion of patients with skin cancer than controls
suffered no rejection crises, and this difference was significant at
one year (P <0-05).
One difference between patients who developed lymphoma and the
controls was that the former tended to have had a longer period of
dialysis before transplantation, but the difference was not significant.
The biggest difference recorded was in the proportions who had
received dialysis for three years Ior more. Among the patients with
lymphoma and the controls these proportions were 27% (3/1 1) and
13% (28/214) respectively in'the. UK series, and 6%/ (1/16) and 1%
(1/93) respectively in the Australasian series.
Patients with canc'er and the co'ntrols were also co'mpared for the
numbers of transplants they had received. The results showed no

tendency for patients who developed lymphoma or skin cancer to
have received any greater number than the controls (table Xm).
These tumours occurred in patients treated for chronic glomerulonephritis, polycystic disease, analgesic nephropathy, malignant
hypertension, and chronic pyelonephritis, and there was no apparent
predilection for them to occur in any particular disorder.
The proportion of patients with lymphoma or skin cancer with
ABO blood group other than 0 who received kidneys from donors
of blood group 0 was not significantly different from that of control
patients. No other cases of discrepant ABO blood groups between
donor and recipient were noted among patients with cancer. Data
on HLA groups were incomplete, but no significant differences
between cases and controls were noted when these details were
available.
Table XIm shows the incidences and observed and expected
numbers of cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in various age groups
in the transplant and non-transplant series. The relative risk
fell somewhat with increasing age, while the absolute risk appeared
to increase; the trend of increasing incidence with age, however, was
not quite significant (P < 0 10).

Incidence of cancer-Patients in the non-transplant series showed
an increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (four cases as
against 0 34 expected; P<0 001), squamous carcinoma of the skin
(two as against 0 38 expected; P=0 06), and all other tumours other
than skin cancer (34 as against 21 74 expected; P < 0 01) (table XIII).
The last group included three mesenchymal tumours (a rhabdomyosarcoma, a leiomyosarcoma, and a meningioma) and one cancer of the
vulva. Interestingly, although the mortality data showed little evidence
of an excess of these types of cancer, most of the sites showing an
excessive incidence of cancer were similar to those noted in the
transplant series-that is, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and skin,
vulval, and mesenchymal tumours. As in transplant recipients,
an excess of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was evident soon after starting
treatment with immunosuppressive drugs and the excess of skin
cancer was confined to squamous-cell carcinoma.
Clin7ical characteristics-There were no gross differences in the
doses of immunosuppressive drugs given to the patients who developed
cancer and the controls. Of the four patients who developed nonHodgkin's lymphoma, two had rheumatoid arthritis, one had chronic
glomerulonephritis, and one had dermatomyositis.

to a less extent, in patients without transplants treated with
immunosuppressive drugs.
LYMPHOID TUMOURS
The most striking excess occurred in non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas (mainly described as reticulum-cell sarcomas and
microgliomas) in the transplant series, which confirms what
has been reported before.8 So pronounced was the excess that its
existence was deduced from cases that had been reported by
19704 before any prospective study had been started. This
excess of lymphoid tumours was extraordinary in its magnitude,
its predilection for the brain, and the very short induction
period. Possible explanations include hypotheses concerning
immunosurveillance, graft-versus-host reaction, chronic antigenic stimulation, and oncogenic viruses. For each of these
there is laboratory support. The short induction period,
sometimes within a few months after transplantation, suggests
a viral origin, since transformation could take place immediately if the virus was already present.
That patients without transplants also showed an excess of
lymphoid tumours suggests that immunosuppression is
important, though the presence of a graft may contribute,
since in transplant recipients the excess was much greater.
Other observations support the primary importance of immunosuppression. Firstly, there was no tendency for lymphoid
tumours to be more common in recipients who experienced
repeated rejection crises (table IXm) or in those who had
multiple grafts (table Xm). Secondly, a study of patients
receiving dialysis, who have severely depressed immune
function, showed that they also had an increased incidence of
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and that in one of them, who had
never been given immunosuppressive drugs, the lymphoma
affected the brain.9 Thirdly, certain rare hereditary disorders
characterised by major immunological impairment, such as the
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, are associated with an increased
risk of lymphomas. It may also be relevant that a reticulumcell sarcoma has been reported in the brain of a woman who
apparently had no IgA in her serum.'0
A direct mutagenic effect of the chemical agents appears to
be unlikely because of the abrupt increase in incidence, the
subsequent constancy of the risk from the time of first exposure,
and the lack of any noticeable dose effect-all of which are in
pronounced contrast to the usual findings with known chemical
carcinogens.
Only four patients without transplants developed nonHodgkin's lymphoma (three treated with azathioprine and one
with cyclophosphamide) and the excess must be interpreted
with caution. An explanation could be that it was due to the
underlying condition for which the patients were treated. A
threefold excess of lymphomas was observed in a very large
series of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Finland,"1 but it is
not clear whether this was associated with any particular form
of treatment. In our series two cases occurred in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (0-18 expected) and two in patients with
other conditions (0-16 expected). Of these second two cases,
one occurred in a woman being treated for dermatomyositis,
which is associated with an increased risk of malignancy but
not characteristically with a risk of lymphoma. In none of these
cases was the brain affected, but three such cases in patients
without transplants being treated with similar drugs have been
reported.'2-'4
From our findings the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is
probably smaller in patients without transplants than in
transplant recipients (P <0-001). Differences in the type, amount,
and duration of drug treatment were, however, substantial.
Azathioprine was given initially to only 64% of patients in the
non-transplant series and was continued for over two years in
less than 30%, whereas azathioprine was continued in over
90% of the transplant recipients throughout the period of
observation. Similar differences were observed in the case of
1465
prednisone. When azathioprine was used the doses were
comparable, but the average doses of prednisone given to
patients without transplants were roughly half those given to
patients with transplants and even less (about a quarter) during
the first six months. Another difference between the two series
was that the transplant recipients had experienced the immunosuppressive effects of severe renal failure before transplantation,
whereas only a minority of patients in the non-transplant
group had a renal disease, let alone one of comparable severity.
Part of the difference, therefore, may have been due to the
longer and more intense immunosuppression experienced by
the transplant group. Support for this also comes from our
observation that transplant recipients with lymphoma tended
to have had a longer period of dialysis before transplantation
than other patients.
SKIN CANCER
The predominance of skin cancer among cases of malignancy
in transplant recipients collected by Penn et al from around
the world was striking even in their first reports3; but in the
absence of any means of calculating "expected" numbers, their
findings might simply have reflected the fact that many transplant recipients lived in areas with high ultraviolet irradiation.
Evidence that the excess was real was obtained by Walder et al,'5
who found an inversion of the usual ratio of basal-cell to
squamous-cell carcinomas; Hoover and Fraumeni,8 who
compared the incidence in a heterogeneous population of
transplant recipients from different countries with that expected
from incidence rates for skin cancer in the USA; and Hardie
et al'6 in Queensland, where a special effort had been made to
obtain a baseline figure for the general population. In the
experience of Hardie et al the incidence of skin cancer in patients
given cadaveric renal transplants was increased some 20-fold.
In our study an excess of skin cancer was observed in both
the transplant and non-transplant series. An observed 10-fold
increase in mortality from skin cancer in transplant recipients
(based on three deaths) may be an appreciable underestimate,
because four further deaths from this cause were attributed in
death certificates to carcinomatosis or lung cancer. All were due
to squamous-cell carcinoma, which was also predominant
among the non-fatal cases. Indeed, there was little reason to
suppose that the incidence of basal-cell carcinoma was abnormal
at all.
There were too few cases of melanoma to provide any firm
evidence of a specific risk. One case occurred in the UK transplant series (0-12 expected) and none in the non-transplant
series (0-14 expected). Four occurred in Australia, where the
disease is relatively common. If the rates for both sexes recorded
in table VIIm are compared with those obtained by McCarthy
et all7 in New South Wales it appears that the incidence might
have been increased about fivefold.
OTHER TUMOURS
There were three cases of acute leukaemia, all in transplant
recipients, compared with an expected figure of less than one,
and six mesenchymal tumours when effectively none were
expected. The mesenchymal tumours consisted of two
rhabdomyosarcomas (one in the transplant series, one in the
non-transplant series), one leiomyosarcoma (non-transplant
series), one Kaposi sarcoma (transplant series), one mesothelioma (transplant series), and one meningioma (nontransplant series). Both rhabdomyosarcomas were diagnosed
within two years of starting immunosuppressive treatment,
which raises questions similar to those in relation to lymphoid
tumours.
There were four cases of bladder cancer in patients without
transplants when less than one was expected, and a single

case in a transplant recipient. Cyclophosphamide was used
more often in patients without transplants than in the others
(46% as against 500 in the first three years), and the excess
was more pronounced in those who had received the drug
(three cases observed as against 0-29 expected; P <0-01). Two
further cases occurred in patients without transplants treated
with cyclophosphamide after the latest follow-up date used
for this analysis, and several other cases of bladder cancer after
cyclophosphamide treatment have been reported elsewhere.18
Hence the risk of this disease is apparently related specifically
to the use of cyclophosphamide.
Of other rare tumours, three were squamous carcinomas of
the vulva (one in the non-transplant series), one was a
metastasising carcinoid tumour (transplant series), and one
was an intrahepatic biliary carcinoma (non-transplant series).
The three cancers of the vulva were similar in character to
squamous carcinoma of other parts of the skin and are perhaps
more appropriately classed with skin cancers than with "other"
cancers. The intrahepatic biliary carcinoma in a patient in the
non-transplant series is interesting in view of Hoover and
Fraumeni's8 report of similar cases in transplant recipients.
Our findings provide no clear evidence that immunosuppressive drugs produce an increased risk of most of the
common cancers. Few of the patients, however, had been
under observation for over five years, and an increase may
appear later.

Effects of indomethacin on postural hypotension in
Parkinsonism

Summary and conclusions
A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of indomethacin on orthostatic hypotension in Parkinsonism.
Twelve elderly patients participated and the drug was
given in two ways-as an intravenous infusion of 50 mg
over 30 minutes and by mouth 50 mg thrice daily for six
days. Results were assessed by measuring the degree of
hypotension on standing, response to the cold pressor
test, and forearm blood flow (by strain-gauge plethysmography).

Indomethacin significantly reduced the fall in blood
pressure on standing (P <0 001) and lessened or reversed
orthostatic symptoms. Furthermore, there was an
enhanced response to the cold pressor test and a reduction
in forearm blood flow.
These findings suggest that indomethacin has a positive
effect on systemic vascular resistance.
Introduction
Orthostatic hypotension is a common, disabling problem in
Parkinsonism. The lesion responsible may be localised within
the efferent sympathetic fibres of the baroreceptor system,'
though other lesions cannot be excluded.' 2 We do not know
whether Parkinsonism and orthostatic hypotension constitute
an incomplete or variant form of the Shy-Drager syndrome.
Most workers believe that such a diagnosis requires evidence of
autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension, sexual impotence,
urinary incontinence, rectal incontinence, loss of sweating, etc)
in addition to the features of Parkinsonism and pyramidal or
cerebellar signs.3-'
Since indomethacin proved to be effective in the Shy-Drager
syndrome6 we decided to evaluate its efficacy against postural
hypotension in idiopathic Parkinsonism.
