Abstract Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive liver disease, histologically characterized by
inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts, and clinically
leading to multi-focal biliary strictures and with time cirrhosis and liver failure. Patients bear a significant risk of
cholangiocarcinoma and colorectal cancer, and frequently
have concomitant inflammatory bowel disease and
autoimmune disease manifestations. To date, no medical
therapy has proven significant impact on clinical outcomes
and most patients ultimately need liver transplantation.
Several treatment strategies have failed in the past and
whilst prescription of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevails, controversy regarding benefits remains. Lack of
statistical power, slow and variable disease progression,
lack of surrogate biomarkers for disease severity and other
challenges in trial design serve as critical obstacles in the
development of effective therapy. Advances in our understanding of PSC pathogenesis and biliary physiology over
recent years has however led to a surge of clinical trials
targeting various mechanistic compartments and currently
raising hopes for imminent changes in patient management.
Here, in light of pathophysiology, we outline and critically
evaluate emerging treatment strategies in PSC, as tested in
recent or ongoing phase II and III trials, stratified per a
triad of targets of nuclear and membrane receptors regulating bile acid metabolism, immune modulators, and
effects on the gut microbiome. Furthermore, we revisit the
UDCA trials of the past and critically discuss relevant
aspects of clinical trial design, including how the choice of
endpoints, alkaline phosphatase in particular, may affect
the future path to novel, effective PSC therapeutics.

Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare and slowly
progressive liver disease with strong genetic and clinical
associations with autoimmunity and characterized by
multi-focal inflammatory and fibrotic bile duct strictures
leading to fluctuating cholestasis, cirrhosis, and ultimately
end-stage liver disease [1]. Diagnosis is based on the
demonstration of characteristic cholangiographic bile duct
findings in the setting of elevated alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) and following exclusion of differential diagnoses
[e.g. immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) associated sclerosing
cholangitis]; magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC)
is the method of choice. In many patients, ALP fluctuates,
and may be normal. Subgroups of PSC patients exist and
must be accounted for in clinical practice and outcome
assessments (e.g. small-duct PSC, PSC with ulcerative
colitis or Crohn’s colitis, PSC with elevated IgG4 [2–4]),
likely to represent, however, variant forms of the same
pathophysiological entity.
Considered a rare disease affecting around 1/10,000 in
the most prevalent areas of Northern Europe and the US,
PSC occurs at all ages although typically diagnosed in
younger adults 30–40 years of age with inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD; in 70–80%, 50–60% or 20–30% in
Northern Europe and USA, Southern Europe, and Asia,
respectively). Patients with PSC carry an exceptionally
high risk of hepatobiliary and colorectal malignancy with a
cumulated risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) approaching
20% at 30 years in some patient series [5]. Many patients
develop recurrent bacterial cholangitis, biliary sludge or
gallstones, or symptomatic biliary strictures even without
such complications (often coined ‘‘dominant strictures’’)
that may profit from endoscopic treatment with balloon
dilatation [6, 7]. Because of the complications and comorbidities, although rare, PSC represents a significant
burden for patients as well as for specialized health services. Critical unmet needs include lack of effective medical therapy, lack of tools for early detection of CCA, and
reliable biomarkers for prognostication in the setting of a
highly variable disease.
There is currently no effective medical therapy with
benefit for clinical outcomes in patients with PSC.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), whilst considered standard-of-care in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), has
failed to show significant and consistent effects on transplant-free survival in PSC [8]. Prescription is still
widespread, and often a trial period of 3–6 months is
employed, after which the decision for continued UDCA
treatment is done based on biochemical response and
potential symptomatic benefits (reduced pruritus) [9]. High
doses of UDCA ([ 20 mg/kg/day) should be avoided [10].
In regions where UDCA prescription is less prevalent (e.g.
Northern Europe and the US), patients are currently left
with symptomatic measures (e.g. to control pruritus and
osteopenia) and clinical surveillance only, with endoscopic
therapy and ultimately liver transplantation as invasive
treatment options for clinically significant biliary strictures
and end-stage liver disease, respectively.
In high-prevalence areas like Scandinavia, PSC is a
major indication for liver transplantation [11]. Mortality is
increased fourfold compared to the general population,
partly due to end-stage liver disease; however, more than
40% of PSC deaths have been attributed to cancer development [5]. Current tools for early detection of CCA perform poorly; however, annual screening by hepatobiliary
imaging and full ileocolonoscopy is recommended by
international guidelines [12]. There is currently a trend
away from annual ultrasound-based screening for gallbladder polyps (and hepatocellular cancer in cirrhotic
patients) towards the use of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and MRC as the annual screening imaging modality
of choice [13, 14], but the full utility of various screening
modalities for early cancer detection in PSC awaits
prospective validation [15].
Pathophysiological basis of therapy
A major challenge in identifying effective therapeutic
approaches is that a proven conceptual framework is still
lacking for PSC pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of PSC
currently appears complex, many-facetted and with an
incomplete understanding of primary versus secondary
processes, leaving critical knowledge gaps in the selection
of potential therapeutic targets [1]. Both environmental and
genetic causes are believed to play a part in establishing
pathways currently thought to drive pathogenesis, through
avenues involving toxic effects of bile due to altered bile
acid composition and cholestasis [16], factors related to the
gut microbiota [17], as well as autoimmunity [18], all
contributing to inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis
in PSC.
There is a strong genetic evidence for autoimmune
susceptibility as a basis for interest in immune-modulating
therapy. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
identified more than 20 genetic risk loci [19–25], clearly
establishing PSC as an autoimmune disease as seen from
the genetic perspective [18]. Furthermore, data have proposed that pathogenic T-cells originating from colonic and
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:588–614 589

small bowel activation, may subsequently migrate to the
liver driven by an overlapping expression in the gut and the
liver of relevant lymphocyte homing components including
the a4b7 integrin and mucosal vascular addressin cell
adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) [26]. In the liver, these
recruited lymphocytes have been suggested to involve in
the biliary inflammation leading to apoptosis and necrosis
of cholangiocytes, and with time tissue fibrosis [27, 28].
Gut-derived antigens presented by PSC-associated
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants to the T cell
receptor (TCR) may also contribute to adaptive immune
responses in the portal areas by means of molecular
mimicry [29–31]. Possibly, gut leakage of pro-inflammatory bacterial products (e.g. lipopolysaccharides, LPS) also
contributes by involving innate immune responses [32–35].
Furthermore, a series of studies now strongly indicate that
the gut microbiota may be involved in PSC pathogenesis
[17, 36–40] giving rise to clinical trials involving fecal
transplantation, non-absorbable antibiotics, and other
means of manipulating the gut microbiome in patients
[17, 41–43]. In the bile ducts, bacterial, and fungal colonization may follow cholestasis and endothelial damage,
through the establishing of a pathogenic biliary microbiota
further propagating inflammation and intercurrent infections [44].
Toxic effects of bile upon cholangiocytes [32, 45], due
to cholestasis, or primary or secondary changes in bile
composition as part of disease processes in the bile ducts or
colon [46–50], or impairment of protective means (e.g. the
so-called ‘‘bicarbonate umbrella’’) [51], may contribute to
biliary inflammatory and fibrotic processes. This ‘‘toxic
bile hypothesis’’ has inspired a broad portfolio of compounds aimed at manipulation of bile acids, cholestasis and
regulators of bile acid metabolism, nuclear receptors
included [52, 53].
Regardless of the order of mentioned pathophysiological
events or the initiating factors, a final common pathway of
cellular crosstalk leads to activation of stellate cells (and
possibly portal myofibroblasts) with fibrosis, collagen
deposition and generation of the scar tissue causing the bile
duct strictures [54, 55], processes revealing targets for
antifibrotic therapy [56–58]. The relative importance of the
many elements believed to contribute to PSC development
and progression is unknown and may vary between subgroups of patients and depending on disease stage (early
disease likely to yield other opportunities for therapy than
late stage disease).
Following the many developments in our understanding
of PSC pathogenesis, the most prominent feature of the
PSC research field these days is the emergence of a variety
of clinical trials (Fig. 1). This new situation has raised
hopes for the emergence of effective therapeutics in PSC,
showing little reminiscence of the scenario 5–10 years ago
when there was little or no clinical trial activity. However,
past experiences and the reasons for the failures of UDCA
to show effects on clinical outcomes (and even increased
mortality in the high-dose [28–30 mg/kg/day] UDCA
trial), despite promising effects on hepatic biochemistries
and prognostic scores, warrants consideration and caution
in our evaluation of results from the ongoing trials [59].
The highly variable natural course of the disease with
fluctuating symptoms and laboratory tests as well as its
rarity and relatively slow progression causing low eventrates in clinical trials altogether complicate study design
and the evaluation of results, and improved surrogate
endpoints to tackle this situation are highly warranted
[60, 61].
On the basis of these reflections, in the following we
will outline the spectrum of emerging therapies, categorized by their plausible pathophysiological foundation. We
will critically evaluate the current evidence base for these
new therapeutic options and discuss how trial design may
be optimized and improved to better allow us to achieve
reliable results on which regulatory and clinical decisionmaking can be based.
Therapeutic approaches
Bile acid therapeutics
The term ‘‘cholestatic liver disease’’ is ambiguous, and
may imply cholestasis both as cause and effect for hepatocellular and biliary changes observed in a variety of liver
diseases. Obstructive cholestasis occurs in PSC as a consequence of biliary strictures, and bile acid toxicity has
been argued to be a critical component in the development
of progressive liver disease. Under the ‘‘toxic bile
hypothesis’’-model for PSC, it may also be argued that bile
acids serve as initiating factors for the inflammation and
fibro-obliterative changes to the bile ducts, either because
of changes to bile composition, or to deficiencies in protective or compensatory mechanisms, the so-called ‘‘biliary
bicarbonate umbrella’’ included. Bile formation is a complex physiological process, also involving protective
mechanisms throughout the exposed surfaces of the biliary
tract. Driven by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mediated chloride secretion and
chloride/bicarbonate anion exchanger type 2 (AE2) [51],
cholangiocytes secrete a bicarbonate rich fluid contributing
about 25% of the daily bile production. The bicarbonate is
concentrated at the apical surface of the biliary epithelium,
presumed to form a protective layer above the cholangiocytes, whereby deficient protection might lead to or
aggravate biliary disease.

During cholestasis, compensatory mechanisms aim to
alleviate the potential toxic side effects of bile components,
bile acids in particular [62, 63]. The process is orchestrated
by a family of quite promiscuous (i.e. having relatively
broad ligand specificities) nuclear receptors for which bile
acids also can serve as activating ligands, most notably the
farnesoid X receptor (FXR) [64], the pregnane X receptor
(PXR) [65], and the vitamin D receptor [66]. Contributions
to the orchestrating efforts comes from related nuclear
receptors with differing specificities, e.g. small heterodimer
partner (SHP), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR),
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa)
and the glucocorticoid receptor, as reviewed elsewhere
[62, 67]. Principle effects cover five main areas: (a) inhibition of bile acid synthesis [through cytochrome P 7A1
(CYP7A1)], (b) enhancement of detoxification (through
CYPs, sulfotransferases and glucuronosyltransferases),
(c) reduced basolateral bile acid uptake (mainly through
downregulation of Na?-taurocholate cotransporting
polypeptide [NTCP]), (d) increased basolateral (mainly
through upregulation of solute carrier organic anion
transporter family member 3A1 [SLCO3A1], organic
solute transporter alpha and beta [OSTa/b] and multidrug
resistance-associated protein 4 [MRP4]) and apical
(through bile salt export pump [BSEP]) bile acid efflux,
(d) pleiotropic effects of involved nuclear receptors on
various inflammatory, apoptotic and fibrotic pathways.
The logic behind bile acid based therapies in PSC is thus
to target unspecific (e.g. choleresis and bicarbonate secretion), specific (e.g. FXR activation) or pleiotropic (e.g.
inflammation, apoptosis or fibrosis) aspects relating to bile
acid physiology, resulting in enhanced protection and
reduced harm from the intrinsic toxicity of bile acids, bile
acid metabolites, and other bile constituencies. Interest in
bile acid based therapy in PSC was however sparked long
before many of these biological insights, by the success of
UDCA in the treatment of PBC. Arguing against primary
roles of bile acid toxicity in PSC initiation, GWAS
revealed no susceptibility loci that clearly harbor genes
potentially involved in bile acid homeostasis (with TGR5
on chromosome 2 and HDAC7 on chromosome 12 possible
exceptions), and there is no data to support involvement of
genes causing Mendelian cholestasis syndromes (e.g.
multidrug resistance protein 3 [MDR3] and BSEP) in PSC.
This probably indicates that bile acid toxicity and reduced
cholangiocyte protection during cholestasis are rather than
for initiation involved in downstream, common pathways
and disease progression, still rendering the processes as
attractive therapeutic targets.

UDCA is a hydrophilic bile acid which, in moderate doses,
is thought to exert its mechanisms of action mainly through
protective effects on cholangiocytes by reducing
hydrophobicity and toxicity of bile via the stimulation of
hepatobiliary secretion, and a direct effect on adaptive
immunity e.g. by inhibiting dendritic cells, but the exact
mechanisms by which UDCA exerts its effects have not
been finally defined [68]. It is not, however, an FXR
agonist.
Enthusiasm was high for UDCA as initial research
indicated positive effects in PSC (Table 1). Five early
placebo-controlled trials of UDCA at doses between 13 and
15 mg/kg/day showed effect on primary endpoints defined
as reduction in ALP and other liver enzymes or reduction
in the PSC-specific Mayo risk score [69–74]. However,
sample sizes were small (n = 6, 10, 13, 20 and 51 patients
in treatment groups, respectively) and statistical power
insufficient, limiting the validity of the results. Furthermore, these studies were flawed by short duration (3, 12, 24
and 24 months and mean 2.2 years, respectively) compared
to the natural history of PSC, evolving over decades.
Three randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of
UDCA in PSC have investigated clinical outcome parameters as the primary outcome, all failing to prove statistically significant beneficial effects on liver transplantationfree survival or cholangiocarcinoma [8, 10, 71]. Follow-up
ranged from 2 to 5 years. The earlier of these trials succeeded in enrolling the predefined number of patients
(n = 51 for UDCA and placebo groups, respectively),
estimated to yield 70% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.0
(placebo:UDCA) given an estimated survival free of
treatment failure of 3.3 years in this panel of patients with
advanced liver disease. However, at 2 years, treatment
failure had occurred in 16/31 versus17/32 in the UDCA
and placebo groups, respectively, with 9 vs 8 liver transplantations and 4 vs 3 deaths (deaths not responsible for
failure), leading to the conclusion of no treatment effect
and speculations that this was due to advanced disease
stage [71].
A major problem for the other two UDCA trials was
their failure to include a sufficient number of patients to
reach the pre-defined power thresholds. Out of 455 PSC
patients who were screened for a high-dose UDCA trial,
only 149 entered the study (n = 76 vs 74 in UDCA vs
placebo groups), with 6 later withdrawals in the treatment
group, with importantly the main indication for exclusion/
non-eligibility being inadequate ALP elevation [10].
Sample size calculations based on an expectation that 35%
of patients would reach the primary endpoint within
5 years estimated that n = 149 patients would yield 80%
power to detect a 50% reduction in event-rate in UDCA
compared to placebo with 5% level of significance, with a
co-primary endpoint including death, liver transplantation,
meeting minimal listing criteria, development of varices,
cholangiocarcinoma or progressing to cirrhosis. However,
event-rates for death and liver transplantation were low [5
vs 3 deaths and 11 vs 5 transplantations in the UDCA
(n = 76) and placebo (n = 74) groups, respectively] [10].
Even the largest multicenter RCT to date, including
n = 219 patients, of which 97 patients treated with UDCA
(17–23 mg/kg/day) with 5 year follow-up, failed to recruit
the predefined required number of patients (n = 346) to
detect a statistically significant difference (80% power to
detect a 50% reduction in event-rate in UDCA compared to
placebo with 5% level of significance) in the primary
endpoint [8]. Only 11/101 vs 7/97 patients in the placebo
and UDCA groups, respectively, reached the co-primary
endpoint of liver transplantation or death (P = 0.37). No
significant effect of UDCA was demonstrated in this study
on either liver enzymes, cholangiocarcinoma or transplantation-free survival. Although the likelihood of a type
II error is high, the continued failure to demonstrate any
effect in the 15 year follow-up study (no difference
between UDCA and placebo group regarding the primary
endpoint of cancer-free survival, P = 0.73; a total of 8 and
6 patients died in the UDCA and placebo groups, respectively) supports the conclusion of the original paper [75].
Four meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate benefit on
survival of UDCA in PSC [76–79].
Based on physiological data on a dose-dependent
increase in UDCA enrichment of the bile of patients with
PSC [43–47% at normal doses (10–17 mg/kg/day);
56–59% at high-dose (18–32 mg/kg/day)] [80], pilot
assessments were performed that indicated enhanced efficacy of high-dose UDCA prescription in PSC [72, 81]. As a
follow-up to this, a multicenter high-dose (28–30 mg/
kg/day) UDCA clinical trial was carried out, surprisingly
observing an increase in clinical endpoints including liver
transplantation and death, colorectal dysplasia, and development of esophageal varices [10, 59, 82]. In consequence,
the subsequent American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases (AASLD) clinical practice guidelines
advised against the use of UDCA as medical therapy in
PSC [83], whereas the European Association for the Study
of the Liver (EASL) guidelines conclude that no specific
recommendation for the general use of UDCA in PSC may
be made based on the inadequate present data [12]. The
mechanisms explaining the detrimental effects of highdose UDCA have not been fully elucidated, but may be
partly linked to the increased amount of unabsorbed UDCA
delivered to the colon and changes in microbial bile acid
metabolism [47].
The debate surrounding the high-dose trial led to a
dramatic drop in UDCA prescription for PSC, in the US
particularly, and even loss of on-label prescription in some
countries. As elaborated below, the UDCA trials should

thus be scrutinized for learning experiences of relevance to
ongoing and future trials, given the persisting emphasis on
ALP as a surrogate biomarker for treatment effect. Critical
questions must be asked: is reduction in ALP a valid
endpoint in trials for PSC and what is a clinically significant reduction in ALP in PSC, over and above the natural
ALP fluctuations known to occur? In scientific terms, the
question for UDCA in PSC is still open; a well-powered,
adequately designed clinical trial has not yet been performed—and likely never will be. What seems certain is
that high-dose UDCA should be avoided, but for lower
doses (10–15 mg/kg/day) current prescription is left at the
discretion of the individual physician—a situation clearly
not acceptable for a proposed first-in-line therapeutic in a
devastating disease.
norUrsodeoxycholic acid
24-Norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA) is a synthetic side
chain-shortened UDCA derivative, which is resistant to
amidation and undergoes cholehepatic shunting [84].
NorUDCA appears to enhance general resistance to bile
acid induced biliary injury, partially via a bile-acid
dependent bicarbonate-rich choleresis created through
stimulation of canalicular flow, proposedly reinforcing the
‘‘bicarbonate umbrella’’ [85, 86]. Furthermore, pleiotropic
effects on inflammatory, apoptotic and fibrotic pathways
over and above the choleresis likely contribute to the preclinical effects [87, 88]. In contrast to UDCA, norUDCA is
secreted into bile in an unconjugated, glucuronidated form
and its metabolite, nor-lithocholate, does not accumulate in
hepatocytes or cause hepatotoxicity in animal models. This
may be an important point, as markedly elevated levels of
hepatotoxic lithocholic acid (LCA) was observed in the
treatment arm in post-hoc analyses of serum bile acid
composition from PSC patients in the high-dose UDCA
trial, possibly contributing to the increased rates of adverse
outcomes.
A multicenter phase II clinical trial including 161 PSC
patients without concomitant UDCA therapy demonstrated
dose-dependent serum ALP reduction (12.3%, 17.3% or
26.0% vs placebo, respectively) during a 12-week treatment with norUDCA 500 mg/day, 1000 mg/day,
1500 mg/day or placebo (Table 2). Moreover, norUDCA
induced a similar dose-dependent reduction in serum
transaminases. Importantly, norUDCA showed an excellent safety profile similar to placebo and pruritus-rates were
not different from placebo. Based on these promising
findings, a Phase III study (NUC5/PSC) is ongoing
(Table 3).
Steroidal FXR agonists
The nuclear bile acid receptor FXR has been implicated in
human cholestatic conditions such as progressive familial
intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) type 1 and intrahepatic
cholestasis of pregnancy [89, 90]. Exemplified, two pairs of
siblings with homozygous FXR truncation or deletion
variants were reported, of which all four children suffered
from severe, early-onset PFIC and liver failure before the
age of two [91]. One of the key roles of FXR is downregulating CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid
production. Negative feedback also affects bile acid turnover, directly through FXR activation in the liver and
indirectly via FXR activation in the gut leading to downregulation of enterocyte apical sodium dependent bile acid
transporter (ASBT) and increased fibroblast growth factor
19 (FGF19) secretion, which signals to hepatocytes via
portal blood and hepatocyte fibroblast growth factor
receptor 4 (FGFR4) activation [92]. Like several of the
other bile acid receptors involved in the regulation of bile
acid physiology, FXR directly or indirectly induce pleiotropic effects affecting inflammation and metabolism

[93, 94]. Therapeutic activation of FXR and FGF19 is
under heavy investigation in cholestatic and metabolic liver
diseases, utilizing both bile-acid derivatives (e.g. obeticholic acid [OCA]) and small-molecular, synthetic FXR
analogues (discussed below) (Tables 2, 3).
The selective FXR agonist OCA (6a-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid) was approved as second line treatment
in PBC based on significant ALP reductions compared to
placebo in one phase III trial (POISE; n = 217) and data
from a 3-year open-label follow-up study were favorable
[95–97]. Dose-dependent pruritus occurred in many
patients, a particular problem for cholestatic patients in
whom pruritus often occurs as a complication to disease.
Also in non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
phase II and III efficacy signals have been reported
[98, 99]. OCA is derived from the primary human bile acid
chenodeoxycholic acid (an endogenous FXR ligand), and
chemically modified to make it 100 times more potent.
The efficacy and safety of OCA in patients with PSC
was evaluated in dose-finding RCT AESOP, using change
in ALP from baseline as the primary outcome (Table 2)
[100]. In this trial, treatment arms given OCA 1.5–3 mg or
5–10 mg in ALP-dependent titrating dose levels were
compared to placebo. Results showed effect on the primary
endpoint with a similar reduction in ALP of about 25% at
24 weeks for the two treatment arms; however, only OCA
5–10 mg achieved statistically significant increased ALP
reduction compared to placebo (DALP difference OCAplacebo - 83.4, P = 0.04; ca - 25% vs - 4.8%.
OCA was generally safe and well tolerated [100].
However, pruritus was reported as a side effect in both
treatment arms but not in the placebo group in a dosedependent pattern, despite exclusion of patients with severe
pruritus at baseline and a higher proportion of patients in
the placebo group compared to the 5–10 mg treatment
group (pruritus at baseline: 16/25 [64%] vs 9/26 [35%] of
patients). Similar findings were previously demonstrated in
the phase III trial in PBC, where 39/70 (56%) and 50/73
(68%) of patients in the 5–10 mg and 10 mg treatment
arms experienced pruritus compared to 28/73 (38%) in the
placebo group. Reports of deaths in cirrhotic PBC patients
linked with off-label (too high doses) OCA treatment
prompted the FDA to issue a warning leading to intensified
instructions for dose reduction in late-stage disease. As a
note of caution, increased levels of fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19) following OCA treatment were observed in
the AESOP trial, as anticipated by others, thus prudence
regarding a potentially increased malignancy risk may be
indicated particularly in PSC with its inherent high risk of
cancer.
Non-steroidal FXR agonists
Concerns regarding adverse effects of OCA have fueled
quests for alternative FXR agonists with maintained therapeutic effects such as decreased hepatic bile acids and
(possibly) anti-inflammatory effects while avoiding
adverse effects associated with OCA (pruritus, disagreeable lipid profile changes with HDL decrease and LDL
increase, potential for drug-induced liver injury and hepatocarcinogenesis) [101].
Cilofexor, a non-steroidal FXR agonist, was investigated in a phase II trial (n = 52) with patients randomized
to 12 weeks treatment with 100 mg (n = 22), 30 mg
(n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) reporting that cilofexor was
safe, well-tolerated and showed effect on biochemical
endpoints (Table 3) [102]. Both the absolute and relative
ALP reduction was larger in the 100 mg treatment arm
compared to placebo (median DALP - 20.5% vs ? 3.4%,
P = 0.03), whereas significant differences were not seen
for the 30 mg arm. In contrast to OCA, cilofexor did not
induce pruritus, which occurred in 36% (8 of 22) of
patients treated at 100 mg, 25% (5 of 20) at 30 mg, and
60% (6/10) with placebo.
Tropifexor is another non-steroidal FXR agonist with
promising results in preclinical studies in non-alcoholic

steatohepatitis (NASH) and currently under investigation in

[103, 104]. Along considerations above, tropifexor may
hold therapeutic prospects in PSC, but currently no trials in
PSC are listed for tropifexor at clinicaltrials.gov.
Aldafermin (NGM282)
FGF-19 is produced in the liver, gallbladder, and the distal
small intestine upon FXR activation [92]. It inhibits bile
acid synthesis via downregulation of CYP7A1 but as a note
of caution may also stimulate cell proliferation in the liver
and gut through pathways mediated by activation of IL6/
STAT3 signaling [105], and has been implicated in the
development of hepatocellular carcinoma in mouse models
[106]. NGM282 is a synthetic analogue of FGF-19, which
may provide beneficial effects in cholestatic liver disease
through prolonged inhibition of bile acid synthesis. This
FGF-19 analogue has been modified to enable biased
FGFR4 signaling maintaining the regulatory functions of
FGF-19 in bile acid metabolism while avoiding the STAT3
activation and hence lacking tumorigenic effects [107].
In an NGM282 phase II RCT including 62 patients with
PSC, the primary endpoint of a significant decrease in ALP
at 12 weeks was not met (ALP ? 25.6 [? 13.4%] and -
9.8 [- 2.8%] in the 1 mg and 3 mg treatment arms compared to - 0.6 for placebo; P = 0.43 and 0.65 for treatment
groups compared to placebo) [107]. However, findings in
exploratory endpoints might indicate improvement of
hepatic injury and fibrosis (DELF test: - 0.3 for both
treatment groups vs 0.1 for placebo, P = 0.049 and 0.02 for
1 and 3 mg compared to placebo; DPRO-C3: - 6.3, - 9.0
and 3.5 for 1 mg, 3 mg and placebo groups, P = 0.01 and
0.001 for 1 and 3 mg compared to placebo) and reduction
in C4 (- 6.2 and - 9.4 ng/ml in 1 mg and 3 mg treatment
groups) and bile acids (total endogenous bile acids: - 19.7,
- 9.6 and - 4.1 in 1 mg, 3 mg and placebo groups;
P = 0.16 and 0.04 for 1 and 3 mg compared to placebo).
Altogether, the multi-compound efficacy signals from
activation of two distinct targets, FGF and FGF19, in the
same biological pathway does hold promise for further
trials in PSC, as they do for similar observations in PBC
and NAFLD. The relationship between FXR/FGF19-signaling and changes observed in the gut microbiome in PSC
also warrant clarification [17, 38, 108], and may even open
for new treatment strategies in a disease in which inflammatory distribution overlaps almost perfectly with the
enterohepatic circulation of bile acids [46, 109].
ASBT inhibitors
Further to the point on enterohepatic circulation of bile
acids, ASBT is responsible for the reabsorption of
conjugated bile acids in the terminal ileum. As mentioned,
FXR exerts some of its effects through down-regulation of
ASBT, reducing the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids
and reducing the bile acid pool. Inhibition of ASBT is
associated with improved liver histology in animal models
of cholestatic liver disease and was hypothesized to bring
therapeutic benefit in PSC [110–112]. An open-label phase
II trial of an ASBT inhibitor (LUM001, maralixibat) has
been completed with 27 PSC patients, and preliminary
results available at clinicaltrials.gov indicate that no clinically relevant change in liver biochemistries was observed
(Table 2). Concerns related to the potential impact from the
increased colonic exposure of bile acids on diarrhea,
colonic inflammatory activity or colonic dysplasia risk in
PSC patients with IBD await further clarification.
All-trans retinoic acid
The cascades of events leading to transcriptional regulation
by nuclear bile acid receptors FXR, PXR and VDR, mostly
involves heterodimer formation with retinoid X receptor
(RXR) as part of binding to relevant DNA response elements [67]. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) activates the
nuclear receptor complex FXR/RXR, leading to reduced
bile acid synthesis through SHP and potentially other
pathways [113]. Promising findings in animal models of
cholestasis provided the basis for studies evaluating ATRA
as therapy for PSC [113, 114]. In a small pilot study
(n = 15), combination therapy with UDCA
(15–23 mg/day) and ATRA for 12 weeks did not meet the
primary endpoint of 30% serum ALP reduction [median
DALP - 34 (reduced from 277 to 243), - 12.3%,
P = 0.09]; however, DALT - 39% (median ALT 76 vs 46,
P = 0.001) (Table 2) [115]. A phase II trial investigating
lower dose ATRA (10 mg b.d.) is ongoing (Table 3).
Fibrates and PPAR activation
PPARs (PPAR-a in particular) are critical to the regulation
of hepatic transporters involved in bile homeostasis and
hence logical targets for therapy in cholestatic liver diseases. PPAR agonists have anti-cholestatic effects,
including enhancement of biliary phospholipid secretion
and mixed micelle formation through upregulation of
MDR3, and inhibition of bile acid synthesis and upregulation of bile acid detoxification [116, 117]. Natural ligands
include a broad variety of lipophilic acids, such as essential
fatty acids, eicosanoids, phytanic acid, and palmitoylethanolamide [118]. As described for FXR, PXR and
VDR, PPARs have pleiotropic effects, partially orchestrated by an intricate cross-talk with the bile acid nuclear
receptors, including anti-inflammatory effects (e.g. by
reduction in NF-jB-dependent gene activation and
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:588–614 599
123

inflammatory cytokines), as well as anti-fibrotic effects
(e.g. through reduced stellate cell activation and collagen
deposition) [119]. In PBC patients with insufficient effect
of UDCA, the pan-PPAR agonist bezafibrate demonstrated
beneficial effects in a phase III investigator-initiated RCT
[97, 120]. Patient-series indicate potential benefits from
bezafibrate also in PSC [121, 122], but to date no RCT has
been performed. Similar reports pertain to the PPAR-a
agonist fenofibrate [123]. For the PPAR-d agonist
seladelpar, however, further trial activity in PSC (and
NAFLD) has been suspended due to unexpected hepatic
events (in the NAFLD arm).
The bezafibrate assessments in PSC originate from
Japan (Table 2). A small prospective open-label study
(n = 11, 12 weeks), showed promising results as assessed
by reduced levels of ALP (by 54% at 12 weeks) and ALT
with subsequent increase following cessation of treatment
[122]. In a previous study, the same group reported effect
(ALP reduced by 30.4% [median – 177] at 6 months) of
bezafibrate 400 mg/day; ALP was reduced in 5/7 PSC
patients [121]. In a small study of eight PSC patients only
published as an abstract, fenofibrate was reported to induce
significant reduction in ALP and ALT but no change in
Mayo risk score at 6 months [124]. The larger FrenchSpanish study reported that fibrates (fenofibrate
200 mg/day or bezafibrate 400 mg/day for at least
6 months) in addition to UDCA in patients with ALP [
1.5 9 ULN on UDCA alone, reduced ALP and ALT by
41% and 39% respectively at 3 months, as well as reduced
pruritus in 20 PSC patients, with 40% of patients reaching
ALP \ 1.5 9 ULN [123]. A multicenter RCT regarding
the effect of bezafibrate on cholestatic itch in PBC and PSC
started in 2016 and is still ongoing [125].
Gut microbiota targeting therapy
The close association between PSC and IBD has long
inspired hypotheses on PSC pathogenesis in which the
bowel plays a causal role [126]. In Northern Europe and the
USA almost 80% of PSC patients have proof of concurrent
IBD, and since IBD in PSC is often right-sided and quiescent, the true number may be higher. In the opinion of the
authors of this review article, the combined bowel-biliary
inflammatory phenotype which predominates the patient
pool of sclerosing cholangitis without an identifiable cause
in Western countries, is likely to represent a single
pathophysiological entity, with however variability in disease presentation and severity.
The mechanistic aspects of the role of the bowel in PSC
are unclear. Whilst the earliest theories of PSC pathophysiology claimed a ‘‘leaky gut’’ whereby bacterial
components and products would passively drift with portal
blood to cause biliary inflammation, more recent
sophistication involves specific interactions between the
liver and the gut microbiome, and even ‘‘single-bug’’
associations (e.g. Veillonella and Klebsiella) [37, 40, 127].
Whether involvement of the gut microbiota relates to
immunological stimulation, including innate immune activation, or bacterial metabolites of endogenous or exogenous origin, is unknown, as for the majority of diseases
where the gut microbiome recently has been implicated
[17]. Another fundamental question is whether observed
alterations in the gut microbiota serve causal roles in the
development of PSC or occur secondary to the ongoing
disease processes, or both. The gut microbiota certainly
holds strong co-metabolic functions in bile acid homeostasis [46, 128], and may influence bile physiology either
directly or indirectly (e.g. via altered FXR signaling). How
such metabolic influences compare with and potentially
cross-talk with effects from the gut microbiota on the
innate or adaptive immune system in PSC remains to be
delineated.
Therapy directed at the gut microbiota is an attractive
avenue to be explored in PSC. Modalities evolve rapidly
along with general developments in the physiological
elaboration of the gut microbiota, and cover broad and
general approaches like non-absorbable antibiotics, diet
and fecal transplantation, as well as more specific addition
or deletion of specific bacterial strains through pro-/prebiotics and bacteriophage applications, respectively
[129, 130].
Antibiotic therapy
A number of antibiotics have shown suggestive ALP signals in PSC (Table 2), with the first reports appearing on
tetracycline in 1959 and 1965, later also from metronidazole, azithromycin, vancomycin and minocycline (reviewed elsewhere [131]). Most emphasis has been put on
vancomycin, which is a poorly absorbed (‘‘gut-selective’’)
antibiotic shown to significantly modify the gut microbiota
(particularly reducing Bacteroides and Prevotella species
[132]), and may also hold immunomodulatory properties
[133]. For vancomycin, there are three case-series and two
small RCTs published and several studies registered as
ongoing; however, long-term data are lacking and the total
number of patients systematically investigated is still
limited.
Initially, vancomycin therapy in PSC was reported in
children, where ALP is not mentioned, as ALP is not used
for follow-up of PSC in pediatric patients. The first case
series from 1998 described three children with PSC and
IBD who received vancomycin, all of which experienced
reduced liver enzymes upon treatment with increased
levels subsequent to drug withdrawal [134]. A patient
series (n = 14) from 2008, observed improvement in ALT
600 J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:588–614
123

(P = 0.007) and GGT (P = 0.005) at 1–2 months in all 14
children, but less pronounced in cirrhotic patients [135]. At
vancomycin discontinuation, liver enzymes increased in
non-cirrhotic patients who then resumed treatment, resulting once again in reduced ALT and GGT. In 2013, vancomycin given to 14 children with PSC resulted in
normalization of previously elevated GGT in all patients at
1–3 months, remaining normal after 12 months of therapy.
Balancing these findings, a retrospective assessment of 66
children receiving vancomycin therapy in the registry of
the Pediatric PSC consortium (22 as initial therapy and 44
after failing UDCA) [136], detected no statistically significant differences in liver-related outcomes between
groups on vancomycin only (n = 22), UDCA only
(n = 60), vancomycin after UDCA (n = 26), and no therapy (n = 35).
Two RCTs have been published for vancomycin in adult
PSC patients (Table 2). In a small RCT (n = 35) from
2013, four groups of PSC patients (n = 8–9 per group)
received vancomycin 125 or 250 mg four times per day or
metronidazole 250 or 500 mg three times per day for
12 weeks. The primary endpoint of ALP reduction was
achieved in both vancomycin groups (DALP in low- and
high-dose vancomycin: - 43%, P = 0.003 and - 40%,
P = 0.002) but not in the metronidazole groups [137].
Results assessed by other endpoints (bilirubin, Mayo risk
score) were conflicting showing improvement in one or
more low-dose groups only and not in high-dose groups. In
another RCT from 2016, vancomycin was compared to
placebo (n = 29; n = 18 vs 11 for vancomycin vs placebo
groups), reporting an effect on ALP reduction at 3 months
compared to 1 month of treatment [DALP - 142.9 (-
18.2%), P = 0.02 in the treatment group, compared to
DALP - 58.1 (- 6.6%) in placebo group] [138]. Slight
differences in baseline ALP should however be noted
(1160 versus 897 in treatment versus placebo groups,
respectively).
For an open-label phase III trial of vancomycin in PSC,
results are available at clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier: NCT01802073) but not published for 9/14 children and 9/20 adults who completed the study. The main
reasons for non-completion were non-compliance in children (4/5) and physician’s decision in adults (7/11).
Change in ALP was not a primary outcome and data are not
given. In adults, 6/9 (66.7%) and 6/9 (66.7%) achieved
each of the two primary outcomes of clinically significant
reduction in ALT and GGT, respectively, at 3 months,
compared to 100% (10/10 and 8/8 for ALT and GGT) of
children. At 2-year follow-up, there were no deaths or
serious adverse events in adults (0/20) and only 1/14
children experienced a serious adverse event (stricture
requiring stenting). For an open-label study of vancomycin
in PSC and biliary atresia, results are available at
clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01322386) but not published for 9/11 enrolled children 0–16 years of age with PSC. Some PSC patients
(n = 11) signed consent but were not enrolled. Improved
liver blood tests (not specified which and no levels given)
were reported for 9/9 PSC patients.
Metronidazole and UDCA combination therapy was
compared to UDCA ? placebo in PSC patients (n = 80,
36 months) in a RCT, resulting in decreased ALP (DALP
- 337 vs - 214, i.e. - 52.4% vs - 37.7%), and Mayo risk
score. Furthermore, significantly more patients showed
histologic improvement of stage (34%, P = 0.047) or grade
(34.4% vs 14%, P = 0.014) in the metronidazole group
[139]. An open-label pilot study for rifaximin in PSC
(n = 16, 12 weeks) failed to show significant changes in
ALP (ALP increased with 5 IU/mL from 342 to
345; ? 1%) and rifaximin was concluded to lack effect
[140]. Minocycline has several properties in addition to
being antibiotic, potentially contributing to its therapeutic
effects in PSC, including anti-inflammatory (e.g. upregulation of the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10) and
antiapoptotic properties [141, 142]. An open-label pilot
study of minocycline (1 year) showed significant
improvement of ALP (DALP - 65, 19.7%; P = 0.04) and
Mayo score [143].
In sum, the promising efficacy signals from long-term
antibiotic treatment in PSC provide proof-of-concept support for the notion of a pathogenic role of the gut microbiome. However, as for the overall changes in the gut
microbiota in PSC, further studies are needed to clarify the
mechanisms responsible for the observations. Delineation
of these mechanisms may open new avenues for more
specific therapies involving the gut microbiome in PSC,
potentially overcoming the troublesome issues related to
side effects and promotion of anti-microbial resistance that
occurs with gross antibiotics therapy. As of yet, long-term
antibiotics prescription in PSC should only be performed in
the context of clinical trials.
Fecal transplantation
Fecal transplantation (FMT) is established therapy for
recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis refractory to treatment
with antibiotics, for which it has demonstrated clinical
benefits [144]. Enthusiasm has been high regarding the use
of FMT for treatment of PSC [17] and IBD [145]; however,
interpretation of current data in the field is complicated by
the substantial variations in current protocols as to route
and frequency of application, stool preparation prior to
transplantation, choice of donors, randomization and welldefined control groups [146]. For PSC, only one full-text
paper has been published to date reporting on the effects of
FMT in PSC [41]. This open-label phase I/II study
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:588–614 601
123

investigated the safety and efficacy of a single FMT
delivered by colonoscopy in 10 patients with PSC and
concomitant IBD. At week 24 post-FMT, the predefined
endpoint of C 50% ALP reduction from baseline was
reached by 3/10 (30%, or more specifically 3/9) and there
were no adverse events. The change in ALP is not
numerically reported in the article, but graphical presentation per patient shows fluctuating levels of ALP over time
suggesting that at 12 weeks there would be no overall
difference from baseline. The abundance of engrafter
operational taxonomic units in patients post-FMT correlated with decreased ALP levels (P = 0.02) whereas no
significant effect of FMT on bile acids was found.
Probiotics and bacteriophage applications
Probiotic therapy was investigated in PSC patients with a
cocktail containing four Lactobacillus and two Bifidobacillus strains in a small crossover RCT (n = 14,
3 months) [147]. Results showed no difference in ALP (-
9 vs. - 9%; P = 0.99), other liver enzymes or symptoms.
A phase III trial is registered (NCT00161148) but has
surpassed its completion date without status verification for
several years.
A pathobiont is a commensal bacterium, which may
shift from symbiosis (a symbiont) to exerting pathogenic
features depending on the circumstances. The suggestions
of Veillonella and Klebsiella pneumonia involving in PSC
pathogenesis seem convincing [37, 40, 127], however the
chicken-and-the-egg problem remains open, as both
microbes seem to be involved in other liver and non-liver
diseases and may also appear abundant due to the presence
of advanced liver disease. The concept however is interesting, as it opens for the targeting of specific bacteria, as
successfully done in murine experiments by specific bacteriophage killing in alcoholic hepatitis and PSC
[130, 148]. As our understanding of the gut microbiota in
human diseases evolves, we are likely to see more specific
therapeutic approaches along this thinking, targeting
specific bacteria or specific pathways of gut microbial
physiology.
Immune modulating therapy
It is a paradox in PSC that all immune-modulating therapies so far have failed to be effective in halting disease
progression despite strong genetic and circumstantial data
implying that PSC is an autoimmune disease [18–25].
Furthermore, T-cells dominate the portal inflammatory
infiltrates in liver biopsies in PSC [149], partially resulting
from cholangiocyte-immune cell cross-talk [31, 32], partially also possibly through migration of activated lymphocytes from the gut to the liver (‘‘homing’’) as stated by
the ‘‘aberrant T-cell homing’’-hypothesis on PSC pathogenesis [26, 27]. Even during heavy immunosuppression
following liver transplantation, PSC patients develop disease recurrence at relatively high frequencies [150], contrasting the immune and autoimmune signatures that
should suggest otherwise.
Glucocorticoids: immunosuppression in PSC with features
of autoimmune hepatitis
There is a continuous spectrum of autoimmune activity
across PSC patients, with higher activities typically seen in
the young. In patients with PSC fulfilling the diagnostic
criteria for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH; 7–14% of adult
patients with PSC), traditionally denominated ‘‘PSC-AIH
overlap’’, more recently diagnosed as ‘‘PSC with features
of AIH’’ [151], glucocorticoid therapy along standard
guidelines for treatment of autoimmune hepatitis is recommended although not evidence based [152]. Treatment
response is often less pronounced than in autoimmune
hepatitis alone, and evaluation of effects on transaminases
and IgG must be weighed against corticosteroid side effects
(e.g. osteoporosis) and discontinuation may be considered
in patients in whom there is little impact.
There is no evidence for clinically significant efficacy of
glucocorticoids in PSC patients without AIH [153] or in
PSC with elevated IgG4 unless a diagnosis of IgG4-associated sclerosing cholangitis can be made per the HISORt
criteria [154]. Observational data are discouraging. A
cohort study (n = 21) reported significant, but marginally
important, improvement in serum ALP (DALP - 23%;
P = 0.003) and AST levels (119 ± 14 vs 103 ± 19 U/L,
P = 0.02) at 1 year following budesonide therapy with loss
of effect 3 months post-treatment, with no effect on Mayo
risk score or histology and a significant loss of bone density
as an important side effect [155]. No significant effect on
liver biochemistries was observed in a RCT (n = 12,
24 months) [156] or another RCT comparing budesonide to
prednisolone (n = 19) [157].
Azathioprine, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, methotrexate,
and mycophenolate
For other immunosuppressants, very limited data exists.
Studies are generally few and mostly lack placebo or are
small (n = 2–30) and underpowered. Although ALP
reduction has been reported in singular cases following
treatment with azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF) and tacrolimus, proof of any effect on clinical
outcome is lacking.
Due to the association of PSC with IBD, many patients
are taking azathioprine for their IBD at the time of PSC
diagnosis and progression. There are no RCTs for
602 J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:588–614
123

azathioprine as PSC therapy. Existing data are limited to
case reports and a prospective case series (n = 15, median
41 months of treatment) [158], and although improvement
in ALP (mean DALP - 557 [- 55.8%]; ALP normalized in
5/15 patients) and histology (6/10, 2/10 and 2/10 showed
improved, stable or worsened histology, respectively) was
reported in this series, there were no convincing data of
effect on clinical outcomes. Of note, a Swedish population
based registry study have suggested an impact from azathioprine (and statins) on clinical outcomes in PSC [159],
so further and more targeted assessments to this end may
still be considered.
Ciclosporin inhibits IL-2 transcription and hence T-cell
response and possibly T regulatory cell production, while
methotrexate exerts anti-inflammatory properties through
suppression of T-cell activation and adhesion molecule
expression. One placebo-controlled trial (n = 35) investigated ciclosporin in PSC patients but was aimed at evaluating effect on UC activity, and does not report ALP
change, other liver biochemistries or liver histology [160].
For methotrexate, a preliminary trial showed promising
improved histology at 1 year in 6/9 patients, but a RCT
(n = 24, 2 years) by the same group found no effect on
liver biochemistry or histology [161]. However potential
bias was reported by the authors, with baseline cirrhosis
slightly more frequent in the treatment group compared to
placebo (58% vs 42%) [162]. Any effect on clinical outcome has not been proven, but it may be argued that it has
not been well investigated for the two drugs.
Regarding MMF, a potent immunosuppressant that
attenuates both B- and T-cell proliferation, a pilot study
(n = 30) showed a significant but clinically marginal ALP
reduction (ALP reduced by 223 [19.6%] from 1135 to
912, P = 0.02) [163]. Subsequently, a small RCT did not
show improved effect of combination therapy with MMF
(1 g/day) ? UDCA (n = 12) over UDCA alone (n = 13)
following 2 years of treatment (ALP change - 16.3%
vs ? 2.8% in MMF vs placebo groups at 2 years; histology and cholangiography also showed no effect of
treatment) [164]. For tacrolimus, which inhibits IL-2
receptor expression and IL-2 production and hence T-cell
proliferation, two small open-label trials (n = 10 and 16,
respectively) have been published [165, 166], both
showing effect on liver biochemistry. The former showed
70% reduction in ALP at 1 year, concluding that tacrolimus will be an important agent in the treatment of PSC
[166]. In the larger of these, ALP was reduced by 46.5%
in the n = 8 (50%) patients who completed 1 year of
therapy [165]; however, drop-out numbers were high due
to poor tolerance for the drug, perhaps due to gastrointestinal side effects associated with a high number of
proctocolectomized patients.
Biologics in the treatment of PSC
Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting TNF-a,
commonly used in the treatment of severe IBD. In PSC,
one small pilot study was conducted in which infliximab
failed to demonstrate any effect on ALP, histology or liver
related symptoms (Table 2) [167]. Currently, an ongoing
international multicenter retrospective study initiated by
the International PSC Study Group (IPSCSG) is investigating the effect on ALP and PSC-related clinical events of
anti-TNF-a therapy used for IBD in PSC patients. Preliminary reports from the assessment do not suggest an
efficacy on the hepatobiliary disease in PSC from anti-TNF
therapy [168].
Vedolizumab, a selective humanized monoclonal antibody to the a4b7 integrin expressed on lymphocytes, blocks
gut lymphocyte trafficking through inhibition of the binding of a4b7 integrin to MadCAM-1. In the bowel, this leads
to reduced intestinal inflammation and induction of
mucosal healing and vedolizumab has emerged as an
effective treatment option in refractory IBD [169, 170].
During inflammatory conditions, PSC included, MadCAM1 and relevant chemokines (e.g. CCL25, CCL28 and
CXCL12) are detected in the portal areas [171–173], suggesting vedolizumab may represent a putative therapeutic
agent in PSC. However, results of a small retrospective
study (n = 34) and subsequently a larger international retrospective study (n = 102) in patients with PSC and IBD
have been disappointing, showing no evidence for significant improvement of liver biochemistry in PSC [174, 175].
Whether a dedicated trial of vedolizumab in PSC will be
performed, is thus doubtful.
VAP-1 is an adhesion molecule expressed by hepatic
endothelial cells which supports leukocyte recruitment to
sites of inflammation through NF-jb dependent expression
of other adhesion molecules including MadCAM-1
expression on endothelial cells [176]. VAP-1 is highly
expressed in PSC livers compared to healthy livers [177],
particularly on the endothelial lining of sinusoids, but also
on fibrous septa in cirrhotic PSC livers. A phase II, single
arm, open-label, multicenter clinical trial BUTEO is
investigating the safety and activity in PSC of timolumab, a
VAP-1 inhibitor (BTT1023, a fully humanized monoclonal
antibody against VAP-1), but results are not yet ready
(Table 3).
Anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic therapies
Cenicriviroc is a CCR2/CCR5 antagonist with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects demonstrated in animal
models of fibrosis and NAFLD [178]. Final results are still
pending for a 24 week phase II trial for cenicriviroc in
PSC, but provisory results posted on clinicaltrials.gov
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:588–614 603
123

indicate that ALP was reduced but not normalized following treatment (mean ALP reduction - 4.5% at
24 weeks; no patients achieved ALP normalization or 50%
ALP reduction but 50% [n = 10] of patients achieved ALP
reduction to \1.5 9 ULN). In NAFLD, cenicriviroc is
one of the compounds being taken to phase III stage of
evaluation, and is also scrutinized in combination with the
FXR agonist tropifexor (see above) as one of the first
attempts at multi-targeted, combination therapies in this
entity [179]. The latter point is interesting also from a
conceptual perspective, summarizing the knowledge from
clinical trials in PSC reviewed within the present chapter:
is a single target sufficient? Or will multiple pathways
ultimately have to be addressed for efficacy to be expected,
e.g. bile acid, immune targets and gut microbiota targets
jointly—each with small, but additive effects?
Simtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against
lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), a matrix enzyme which
plays a central role in fibrogenesis, stabilizing the fibrotic
matrix by catalyzing cross-linkage of elastin and type I
collagen. LOXL2 activity induction was reported in fibrotic
liver diseases including PSC and hepatic and serum
LOXL2 levels correlated with fibrosis in PSC
[56, 180, 181]; hence LOXL2 appeared to be an attractive
target for therapy. In a phase II clinical trial, patients with
compensated PSC (n = 234; half of which had bridging
fibrosis or cirrhosis at baseline) were randomized to treatment with simtuzumab 75 mg, 125 mg or placebo for
96 weeks [57]. Results were disappointing, however, for
the primary endpoint, showing no effect on fibrosis as
assessed by hepatic collagen content. Results were also
negative for both treatment arms compared to placebo
regarding Ishak fibrosis scores and event-free survival.
Overall, 80 (34%) patients had fibrosis progression (34%,
33% and 44% in the 75 mg, 125 mg and placebo groups)
and 47 (20%) experienced PSC-related clinical events.
The simtuzumab trial is nevertheless interesting, due to
its opportunities for exploratory endpoints considerations
against liver biopsy findings. In total, 47 patients (20%)
experienced at least one of the clinical events included in
the co-primary endpoint (ascending cholangitis [n = 31,
13%], jaundice [n = 15, 6%], ascites [n = 7, 3%], sepsis
[n = 4, 2%], CCA [n = 3, 1%]); hepatic encephalopathy,
variceal hemorrhage and hepatocellular cancer each
with \1%) but no deaths or liver transplantations occurred, underscoring the need for good surrogate endpoints. In
multivariate analysis, PSC-related clinical events were
more frequent in patients with (at baseline) advanced
fibrosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03; 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.02–4.06; P = 0.045), higher ALP (HR per 10 U/L,
1.01; 95% CI 1.00–1.02; P = 0.015), and higher ELF test
(HR per unit, 1.26; 95% CI 0.98–1.61; P = 0.073).
Stratification of patients by baseline ALP demonstrated
a stepwise increase in risk of clinical events at week 96
(risk 6%, 19% and 34% in patients with baseline ALP \
158, 158–324 and [324 U/L) [57], supporting previous
reports of an association between ALP [1.5 9 ULN with
clinical outcomes in PSC. However, change in ALP at
week 12 or other time points were not associated with
clinical events in the simtuzumab trial.
Study design and biomarkers
Successful development of therapy in PSC is currently
hampered by uncertainties on study design and lack of
prospectively validated surrogate markers for efficacy.
Examples of challenges related to study design include: (1)
long disease duration and low event-rate; (2) lack of early
stage disease identifiers; (3) confounding comorbidity, IBD
in particular; (4) high disease variability and fluctuating
disease activity; and (5) lack of established biomarkers for
(a) risk stratification and clinical trial patient selection and
(b) as surrogate markers for disease severity and treatment
effects.
A majority of the clinical trials conducted in PSC to date
have been ill powered. This is mainly due to the combination of a rare disease with slow disease progression (in
some patients over decades) where definitive outcomes
such as liver transplantation or death rarely occur within a
relatively short study period. Furthermore, clinical assessment of large patient series support the existence of subgroups of patients with distinct prognostic features (e.g.
PSC with UC is associated with more aggressive disease
compared to PSC with Crohn’s disease) [3]. Refined and
more stringent phenotype definitions of PSC patients
entered into trials might thus contribute to improved power.
The high frequency of cholangiocarcinoma and other
malignancies in PSC is also a challenge, representing both
a confounder for disease behavior and potentially relevant
endpoints.
Improved selection of patients based on disease severity
or stage would enhance our ability to conclude reliably
from trials. Furthermore, the fluctuating disease course in
PSC is poorly captured by currently used severity measures
and prognostic algorithms, over and above the transient
aggravations that may occur related to intercurrent events
such as biliary obstructions and bacterial cholangitis.
Finally, one may even argue that at the time where a
diagnosis of PSC is currently made, i.e. based on biliary
strictures on imaging, it is already too late for many of the
proposed mechanisms of action for relevant drugs to be
efficacious. Such considerations lead to deep questions on
how to make a diagnosis of PSC, and whether current
emphasis on imaging may lead to an intrinsic underrepresentation of early stages where medical therapy may be
604 J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:588–614
123

expected to show efficacy, i.e. the biliary strictures as an
irreversible feature—by some denominated ‘‘cirrhosis of
the bile ducts’’.
Alkaline phosphatase
ALP is the single marker receiving most attention in clinical trials in PSC and was used as a primary or secondary
endpoint in almost every clinical trial in PSC with published data over the past 20 years (Tables 1, 2). Most
studies of therapy in PSC have also used elevated ALP at
baseline as one of the inclusion criteria. The International
PSC Study Group presented expert opinion in a position
paper based on a Delphi process of reiterated discussions,
concluding that ALP is one of the top five candidate surrogate markers for clinical trials in PSC [61]. In a followup paper, authors affiliated with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) also favors ALP as a surrogate
endpoint, although concluding that ALP should be supported by other biomarkers or clinical benefit [60]. They
base their conclusion on a claim that a limited pool of
published data support that ALP normalization, or reduction by 40%, or achieving a level less than 1.3–1.5 9 ULN
may identify patients with improved outcomes [182–185].
The arguments in favor of using ALP as a primary endpoint
are that (1) ALP reflects disease severity in PBC and could
be expected to perform similarly in PSC; (2) ALP increases
with increasing symptoms caused by significant biliary
strictures and decreases following their treatment in
observational studies; and (3) four retrospective cohort
studies reported that normalization of ALP or improvement
to \1.3–1.5 9 ULN was associated with better clinical
outcome [182–185]. As a note of caution, though,
prospective data are lacking and two of these retrospective
studies were long-term post hoc analyses of UDCA trials.
In the 10-year follow-up study for the Scandinavian
medium–high-dose UDCA trial, patients who achieved
ALP normalization or 40% reduction or reduction to
1.5 9 ULN had improved transplant-free survival regardless of treatment arm (UDCA or placebo) [8]. In the highdose UDCA trial (n = 150), ALP reductions were not
related to complications in individual patients in the UDCA
treatment arm [182]. Rather, evidence suggesting an
association of ALP with prognosis in this trial rests on the
fact that patients who achieved ALP B 1.0 9 ULN at least
once during follow-up (in the high-dose UDCA as well as
the placebo arm) had a lower risk of death and LT compared to patients in the same treatment arm who did not
experience ALP normalization at any point.
In summation, it is reasonable to say that most arguments in favor of ALP are weakly founded and further
studies to clarify its utility are certainly warranted. Is ALP
truly a suitable surrogate disease severity marker or risk
stratification tool in PSC? The cutoff values for ALP at
baseline and the definition of change in ALP (magnitude
and time point for evaluating change) varies between different studies (Tables 1, 2). Hence, the algorithms proposed
to date also generally lack external validation and attempts
at cross-validation have failed (e.g. ALP \ 1.5 9 ULN
was discriminatory at 2 years in one cohort [185] but was
only predictive when applied at 6 or 12 months in two
other studies [184, 186], which did not replicate this cutoff
value at 2 years). The considerations hold considerable
importance, as exemplified by ALP efficacy signals in
several recent phase II clinical trials (norUDCA: DALP -
12.3%, - 17.3% and - 26.0% compared to placebo in the
500 mg, 1000 mg and 1500 mg treatment groups; OCA:
DALP - 25.7%; bezafibrate: DALP - 40%; fenofibrate:
DALP - 43%; vancomycin: DALP - 18.2% to - 43%),
which at best parallel past experiences with UDCA (DALP
- 40.6% to - 72.6%), and hence should prompt reflections
as to whether these signals indeed will translate into clinical benefit—and as such fundamentally also how to deal
with UDCA prescription in PSC.
The challenges related to patient inclusion based on
ALP can be exemplified by a panel extracted from the PSC
patient registry in Oslo, where one or more ALP values
were available for a random selection of 112 PSC patients.
Depending on whether the lowest or highest ALP value
represented a hypothetical time of screening for a clinical
trial, 30 (26.8%) or 26 (23.2%) patients had ALP values
within the normal range, while 48 (42.9%) or 41 (36.6%)
patients had ALP \1.5 9 ULN, hence failing to comply
with a commonly used cut-off point for inclusion in clinical
trials. Bilirubin levels exceeded 2.0 mg/dL in 24 (21.4%)
of patients at both time points. Applying the combined
criteria of ALP [1.5 9 ULN and bilirubin B 2.0 mg/dL,
only 42 (37.5%) and 71 (43.8%) of the patients would be
eligible for inclusion. Thus, from about a quarter to more
than half of our patients would be excluded from several
ongoing or past clinical trials in PSC contributing to the
power issues of clinical trials in PSC, and moreover, might
lead to a selection bias that may hamper generalization of
results.
Other surrogate endpoints
A recent review of surrogate endpoints in PSC endorsed by
the FDA as well as the previous position paper on the same
subject by the International PSC Study Group both give
much space to the discussion of ALP [60, 61]. Acknowledging, however, the challenges associated with ALP as a
prognostic biomarker in PSC, the development of other
non-invasive tests has received intense attention over
recent years (Table 4). Several PSC-specific clinical
models, comprising a mixture of clinical features and

laboratory values, and based on logistic regressions or
machine-learning methodology, have been suggested to
serve prognostic purposes yet frequently include ALP
[187, 188]. The prognostic scores may turn out to represent
useful surrogate endpoints, although the most widely used
clinical model, the revised Mayo risk score, demonstrated
limited utility in early stage disease and failed to predict
the negative outcome of the high-dose UDCA trial. Certainly, their broad scope of parameters may also render
them less sensitive to dynamic changes within distinct
pathways.
Tests reflecting liver fibrosis seem promising. The
patented and commercially available serum-based
Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test and ultrasound based
transient elastography have shown strong associations with
clinical outcome in PSC independent of other factors, and
have both been validated in independent studies from different centers or in multicenter cohorts [57, 189–192].
Novel and more specific biomarkers of liver fibrosis, discriminating collagen formation from degradation as
opposed to just reflecting the more static fibrosis load, have
also been associated with clinical outcome in PSC and may
be suited to evaluate treatment effects, with PRO-C3 the
currently most promising single marker [193]. Markers of
inflammation, autoimmunity or gut barrier function
including IL-8 [194], VAP-1 [177], autotaxin [195] or
soluble CD14 [33] have also demonstrated association with
clinical outcome and may represent relevant surrogate
endpoints in trials targeting these pathways; however,
independent validation and more knowledge about the
natural history and fluctuations of theses markers, alone
and in combination, are warranted.
Conclusions
The role of UDCA in the treatment of PSC remains controversial. A surge of interest in clinical trials in PSC over
recent years has resulted in proof-of-concept for bile acid
therapies beyond UDCA using novel agents as well as

Grading systems may include various
pathophysiologic processes
Strong association with clinical outcome
(LTX-free survival, time to LTX) for
stage assessed by Ishak, Nakanuma,
and Ludwig staging systems was
demonstrated in a single-center study
and validated in an independent
international multicentre study.
Nakanuma staging appeared to have
the best prognostic value [205, 206]
Association of Ludwig stage with
clinical outcome has been
demonstrated in several studies
One study estimated (using a Markov
model) that change in stage at 2 and
5 years would appear in 66% and 96%
of PSC patients with Ludwig’s stage II
at baseline, indicating that changes in
histology can be seen within the scope
of a therapeutic trial [207]
Invasive, risk of adverse events

biopsies unless care is taken to biopsy

No consensus on a single system for

relates to the larger bile ducts, which
are not accessed by standard liver

biliary duct inflammation as a parallel
to the use of fecal calprotectin in
inflammatory bowel disease

antibiotic treatment directed at the gut microbiota (Fig. 1).
Antifibrotics and therapy targeting the immune system
seem paradoxically disappointing. The establishment of
validated risk stratification tools and surrogate endpoints
would facilitate drug development. Likely, combination
therapy covering several aspects of PSC pathogenesis will
ultimately be needed to achieve clinical efficacy.
