1. Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic 
cholestatic liver disease, characterized by inflammatory 
and fibrotic bile duct lesions forming multiple strictures 
and dilatations of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts 
(1-3). The disease is more common in men than women, 
and among Caucasians and Northern Europeans, than in 
Southern Europeans, Asians, or Africans (4,5). 
Criteria for diagnosis are; cholangiographic findings 
of multifocal strictures and beading of the intraand/
or extra-hepatic bile ducts, compatible biochemical 
abnormalities, and exclusion of secondary causes 
(1,4,6). PSC is closely linked to inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD), and some cases come to medical 
attention when patients with IBD are screened for liver 
disease (7). Genetic disposition and disordered immune 
regulation is considered to have a role in PSC. A recent 
report suggested that first-degree relatives and siblings 
are associated with a PSC prevalence approximately 
100-fold that of nonrelatives (8). However, specific 
mechanisms remain un-clarified to date (1). 
Gradual progression of cholestasis results in 
end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Ursodeoxycholic 
acid administration, with or without the use of 
immunosuppressive agents, seems to have a moderate 
clinical effect on liver function tests, but it is not clear 
whether there is a beneficial effect on delaying the 
progression of the disease and improving the overall 
survival rate (4,9). Effective medical treatment remains 
a matter of debate.
2. PSC and liver transplantation
Liver transplantation is the optimal treatment for 
patients with PSC presenting with ESLD and associated 
complications, such as severe manifestations of portal 
hypertension (4). The short-term outcome has been 
excellent. The impact of a recurrence on long-term 
survival has been a concern but was not significant in 
deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) based on 
Western experience (10). 
In Asia, especially in the Far East, however, organs 
from deceased donors remain extremely scarce. LDLT 
has been accepted with enthusiasm and its indications 
have been extended to adult recipients (11,12). 
Despite technical difficulties and the ethical 
dilemma, well planned donor selection protocol 
and technical innovations have paved the way for 
Summary Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of unknown 
origin which eventually results in liver cirrhosis. The disease is reported to be more 
common among the Western population than in the Asian population. Asian experience 
remains limited. Diagnosis and treatment standards in the Far East have largely followed 
those in the West, including liver transplantation. Unlike in the West, however, recent 
reports from Japan have presented with a higher recurrence rate of PSC after liver 
transplantation, suggesting the intractable nature of the disease even after the replacement 
of the entire affected organ.

advancement with satisfactory results (13,14). LDLT 
for adult recipients has become standard practice in the 
region for various indications including ESLD due to 
PSC.
3. DDLT and PSC
Although a higher rate of re-transplantation has been 
reported, PSC is considered a good indication for 
DDLT with an excellent 5-year graft survival rate of 
approximately 80%. Evidence of recurrence has been 
suggested in earlier experience (15,16), and is currently 
an established concept (17). Recurrence of PSC after 
DDLT has been reported at rates between 1% to 33%, 
depending on the diagnostic criteria and follow-up 
duration (4). 
Graziadei and colleagues proposed combined 
cholangiographic and hepatic histologic criteria with 
strict exclusion criteria (cases with ABO incompatibility 
between donor and recipient, nonanastomotic strictures 
before posttransplantation day 90, anastomotic 
strictures alone, hepatic artery complications, or 
ductopenic rejection were excluded) and reported that 
PSC recurs after DDLT in 20% of cases with typical 
radiologic manifestations found within a year, and 
histologic presentation within 3 years after DDLT (18). 
Factors affecting recurrence have been extensively 
studied in the Western literature. An earlier retrospective 
study suggested that the presence of an intact colon 
before transplantation was significantly associated 
with recurrence (17). Other studies identified different 
factors as risk: recipient-donor gender mismatch (19), 
use of OKT3 or steroid resistant rejections (20,21), 
persistent ulcerative colitis after transplantation (22), 
human leukocyte antigen DRB1*08 (HLADRB1*08) 
(23). A most recent large series with a longer follow 
up period supports the findings that colectomy remains 
a significant risk factor, and further, use of extended 
donor criteria may also be a significant risk factor (24).
4. Recurrence of PSC in LDLT
A case suspected of recurrent PSC following LDLT was 
first reported by Kita et al. (25). Since then, there have 
been sporadic case reports of LDLT for PSC from living 
related donors (26-34) (Figure 1). However, follow-up 
periods were less than 2 years in most case reports, and 
recurrence was not reported. 
Aside from these case reports, LDLT for PSC can 
be sporadically identified among moderate to large 
registries worldwide (35-38). From Korea, Moon et 
al. (35) reported 2 cases among 580 recipients. From 
Japan, Soejima et al. (36) also reported 2 cases of 
LDLT for PSC in their series of 52 LDLTs. Both, 
however, lacked a specific description of the long - 
term outcome. The largest PSC registry analysis by 
Maheshwari et al. (38) reported the outcome of 3,309 
patients who underwent liver transplantation, among 
whom 69 cases were LDLT. Only 10 cases presented 
with a follow-up period longer than a year. 
An explanation for this lack of information on 
the long-term outcome of LDLT for PSC, especially 
regarding recurrence, may be due to the rare incidence 
of PSC in the Far East where LDLT is far more 
common than DDLT.
5. PSC in Japan and LDLT
Report on the epidemiology of PSC in Asian countries 
remains scarce. Currently, large registry analysis or 
nationwide survey study results are only available from 
Japan (Figures 2 and 3).
A recent nationwide survey from Japan including 
391 patients with PSC with a median follow up period 
of over five years presented that the estimated median 
survival of all patients was 13.1 years, with a 5-year 
survival rate of 74.5%. Thirty-eight patients underwent 
liver transplantation with a 5-year survival rate of 
92.0%. Cholangiocarcinoma was found in 14 (3.6%) 
patients. Prevalence of IBD was 32%. Interestingly, 
authors' pointed out two distinctive features recognized 
among Japanese patients. First, two peaks in age 
distribution were demonstrated (in the twenties and in 
the sixties) an uncommon distribution not reported in 
the Western series. Second, while the presence of IBD 
was limited to 37%, 7.2% of patients, mainly those 
older than 50 years of age, experienced autoimmune 
pancreatitis (39-41). 
Earlier registry analysis including 66 patients who 
underwent LDLT for PSC has raised a concern on the 
impact of recurrence calling for study with well defined 
diagnostic criteria and a longer follow up period (42). 
Since then, two single center case series of LDLT for 
PSC have been published from high volume centers 
(43,44). 
The Tokyo group described the outcome of 9 adult 
LDLT cases, of which 8 were living-related. The 
14

survived for more than a year, 13 (59%) presented with 
PSC recurrence with a mean follow-up period of 31 
months, 5 of whom died or required re-transplantation 
due to graft failure. The HLA haplotypes that may 
affect recurrence of the hepatic condition remain 
unclear, although HLA-DR15 is positively associated 
with ulcerative colitis. The group concluded that unlike 
PBC, the recurrence of PSC adversely affects the 
outcome in LDLT (44). 
Finally, based on the above two reports, a 
nationwide survey was conducted collecting the data of 
132 patients from 29 centers in Japan. Fifty-three (40%) 
had IBD, and 4 (3%) had cholangiocarcinoma. After 
excluding patients not undergoing primary standard 
LDLT, and further, excluding ABO-incompatible cases, 
those complicated with hepatic artery thrombosis 
and ductopenic rejection, 96 remained for analysis. 
Recurrence was diagnosed in 26 patients (27%) after 
transplantation. Recurrence-free survival was 57% at 
5 years after LDLT and graft loss rate was 69% among 
those with recurrence compared to 23% among those 
without. Multivariate analysis revealed that high MELD 
scores, first-degree-relative donors, postoperative CMV 
infection, and early biliary anastomotic complications 
were significant risk factors for recurrence (45).
6. Conclusion
Indeed, presenting with a high rate of recurrence 
after replacement of the entire affected organ, PSC 
median follow-up period was 3.5 years after LDLT. 
The five-year patient survival rate was 90%. According 
to Graziadei's criteria (18), however, recurrent PSC 
was diagnosed in four patients. The rate of freedom 
from recurrent PSC at 5 years was 49%. The mean 
time to recurrence was 3.3 years. When limited to 
biologically related donor-recipient cases, recurrent 
PSC was diagnosed in 50% of cases. None of the 
patients presented with the HLA haplotypes associated 
with a higher susceptibility for developing PSC in the 
Caucasian population (43). 
The Kyoto group reported 28 patients with PSC 
who underwent LDLT. Among the 22 patients who

encountered in the LDLT setting seems like an 
intractable entity. In addition, much remains unknown 
about the nature of PSC in the Far East where LDLT 
is predominantly performed in place of DDLT as 
compared to the West. 
Whether the high rate of recurrence following 
transplantation in Japan may be attributed to 
the unrecognized genetic background, or to the 
characteristic organ source found in the region that is 
often from a biologically related living donor, remains 
to be elucidated.
