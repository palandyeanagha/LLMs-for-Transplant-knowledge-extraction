Abstract
Background: Conventional perioperative analgesic modalities (e.g. opioids, epidural analgesia) have their own
drawbacks, which limit their clinical application. This study investigated the opioid-sparing effectsof the oblique
subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) blockade with ropivacaine for the patients undergoing open liver
resection with a Mercedes incision.
Methods: 126 patients who were scheduled for open liver resection were enrolled in this study. Patients were
randomly assigned to receive bilateral ultrasound-guided OSTAPblocks with either 0.375% ropivacaine (groupT) or 0.
9% isotonic saline (group C). Both groups also received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and intravenous
40 mg parecoxib every 12 h for a total of 3 days. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters, plus intraoperative
and postoperative cumulative sufentanil consumption, were recorded.
Results: 70 patients were enrolled in the study finally. There were no significant differences between the two
groups with respect to preoperative parameters, and surgical and anesthetic characteristics. The intraoperative
sufentanil use, cumulative sufentanil consumption at 5 min after extubation, 2 h, 4 h,12 h and 24 h after operation
in group T was significantly less than that in group C (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.044, respectively).
Compared with group C, postoperative NRS pain scores at rest were significantly lower at 2 h and 4 h
postoperatively in group T (P = 0.04and 0.02, respectively); NRS scores at the time of coughing were also
significantly lower in group T than in group C at all time points except 5 min after extubation (all P < 0.001).
Furthermore, compared with group C, the number of intraoperative vasodilator use, the extubation time and the
incidence of nausea was reduced in group T.
Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with ropivacaine can significantly decrease the
perioperative cumulative dosage of analgesics and improve analgesic effect without obvious side effects for the
patients who underwent an open liver resection with Mercedes incision when compared tothe ultrasound-guided
OSTAP block with saline.

Background
Pain control is a vital component to achieve enhanced recovery after liver surgery. Effective postoperative pain control will reduce the incidenceof numerous postoperative
complications, can facilitateearly mobilization and may result in earlier recovery [1]. However, optimal postoperative
analgesic modalities following liver resection remain controversial [1, 2].Paincontrol is historically achieved by the
administration of opioids, whichis associated with welldocumented side effects, such as sedation, respiratory
depression,pruritus, hallucinations and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Epidural analgesia, another
routinely used analgesic technique, offers equivalent or superior pain scores when compared toconventional systemic opioids. However, its utilizationis limited by
perioperative coagulation dysfunction, which is typical in
the patients for liver surgery and subsequent catastrophic
neurologic injuries resulting from epidural haematoma
[3–5]. In addition, epidural analgesia is independently associated with an increased use of blood transfusions and a
longer hospital stay [5]. Enhanced recovery following hepatectomy has gained attention even though there is limited evidence on the efficacy and effectiveness of existing
analgesic techniques. The oblique subcostal transversus
abdominis plane (OSTAP) block has been demonstrated
to improve pain-related outcomes after upper abdominal
surgeries, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy [2–4, 6–
9]. To our knowledge, the analgesic efficacy of ultrasoundguided OSTAP blocks has not been extensively investigated in the setting of open liver surgery for patients suffering from liver cancer, especially for the roof-shaped
incision, including the Mercedes incision [3, 6, 9, 10].
Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ultrasoundguided OSTAP blocks can reduce cumulativeopioid consumption for the patients undergoing liver resection with
the Mercedes incision when added to conventional multimodel intravenous analgesic technique. The aim of this
prospective comparative investigation was to assess the
impact of OSTAP blockade in a multimodal perioperative
analgesic regimen and any related side effects in patients
undergoing liver resection with Mercedes incision.
Methods
This prospective,observer blinded randomized control
trialwas conducted at the First Affiliated Hospital, School
of Medicine, Zhejiang University in China after being approved by the Ethical Committee of Zhejiang University
(Hangzhou, People’s Republic of China) (Ref: 2013–662).
Each patient read and signed a consent form before enrolment in the study.
Participants
From February 20,2014 to February19, 2015, 126 patients who suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma and

distant metastasis; no invasion of the diaphragm or surrounding tissues; indocyanine green retention rate at
15 min < 15%; a remnant liver volume/standard liver
volume ratio of > 50% in patients with liver cirrhosis
and > 35% in patients without liver cirrhosis; and Class
A or B on the Child–Pugh liver function scale. Exclusion
criteria were as follows: the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (ASA) IV or above, body mass
index < 18 or > 26 kg/m2
, age > 65 or < 18 years old,
currently taking contraceptives, pregnancy, inability to
understand Mandarin, inability to properly describe
postoperative pain to investigators (e.g. language barrier,
neuropsychiatric disorder), relevant drug allergy, preexisting neuralgia, history of chronic pain, consumption
of opioids within 24 h before surgery, alcohol or drug
abuse, contraindications to peripheral nerve block (e.g.
allergy to local anesthetics, coagulopathy, local or systemic infection), history of abdominal surgery or trauma,
previous liver resection, rupture or bleeding of the
tumor, emergency surgery for liver resection, estimated
operation time of more than 6 h, intraoperative bleeding
more than 500 mL, transplant donor liver resections,
and those unable to be extubated postoperatively for any
clinical reason.
Randomizationand blinding
The study was an observer blinded randomized control
trial. The patients were randomly assigned to receive bilateral OSTAP blocks with either 40 mL 0.375% ropivacaine (Naropin; AstraZeneca, Sodertalje, Sweden) (group
T) or with 40 mL 0.9% isotonic saline (group C). No adjuvant was added to the solutions. Identical boxes containing either isotonic saline or ropivacaine were sealed
and marked with the name of the project, the names of
the investigators, and consecutive numbers according to
a computer-generated block randomization list provided
by www.random.org. Study medication was prepared by
a designated nurse (LNZ, who did not participate in direct patient care). The nurse (LNZ) opened the box and
drew the study medication into identical syringes. Two
of the anesthesiologists (JGG, HLL) performed all intraoperative assessments, and two other investigators (SJY,
LC) assessed and recorded all the postoperative data.
Oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP)
block
After sedation with midazolam, the same ultrasoundguided OSTAP block approach was performed bilaterally
by one of two clinical investigators (JGG, HLL) in both
groups. Ultrasound images were obtained using Sonosite
S-Nerve ultrasound machine (Sonosite®, Micromaxx,
Guo et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:36 Page 2 of 11

Bothwell, WA, USA) with the HFL38x broadband linear
array probe. The ultrasound probe was obliquely placed
on the upper abdominal wall. The neurofascial layer of
OSTAP was identified as lying between the rectus abdominis and the transversus abdominis muscle. To perform the blocks, abdominal skin was prepared with 5%
povidone iodine solution and covered with sterile drapes.
Local infiltration was performed with 1–2 mL of 2%
lidocaine at the needle entry site. A 22G, 120 mm Stimuplex D Plus needle (B. Braun, Melsungen AG,
Germany) was advanced using an in-plane technique
until the tip lay within the neurovascular fascial plane
between the rectus abdominis and the transversus abdominis muscle. Following negative aspiration, a test injection with 1 mL of 0.9% normal saline was performed
to confirm the needle location. Then 20 mL ropivacaine
(group T) or saline (group C) was injected with intermittent aspiration every 3–5 mL while observing the expansion of intermuscular plane on each side.
Sensory change was then assessed bilaterally between
the midclavicular line and the midline, starting above
dermatome T4 and moving caudally to dermatome L4.
A pinprick was tested with a blunt needle and cold with
disinfectant swabs at 10, 20 and 30 min after the OSTAP
block by one clinical investigator (QQP). If the intended
sensational decrease in surgical dermatomes did not
occur after 30 min, the patient was regarded as having a
failed block and was excluded from further investigation
during the analysis and statistic phase.
Intraoperative anestheticmanagementbefore and after
OSTAP placement
All patients received a standardized anesthetic regimen.
No additional preoperative medications were administered after block placement. Upon arrival in the operating room, ASA standard monitoring, including
electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure and
pulse oximetry was established. Pre-sedation heart rate
(HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were recorded as baseline values. Supplemental oxygen
(oronasal mask at 4 L/min) was administered. After
placement of a peripheral venous catheter, a lactated
Ringer’s infusion was started at a maintenance rate. With
proper sedation an OSTAP block was performed in both
groups as stated above.
About 30 min after the OSTAP block, general
anesthesia was induced with propofol (0.5–2.0 mg/kg),
sufentanil (0.2–0.6 μg/kg) and rocuronium (0.6–1.0 mg/
kg). After endotracheal intubation, ventilation was
started with oxygen and medical air (FiO2 = 0.6) and
ventilator settings were adjusted to maintain normocapnia. A total intravenous anesthesia technique composed
of propofol, sufentanil, dexmedetomidine and intermittent
rocuronium was used to maintain adequate anesthesia
with bispectral index (BIS) at 40–50 (A-2000 BIS™ monitor; Aspect® Medical Systems, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
The dexmedetomidine was administrated intravenously
with a loading dose of 0.5–0.7 μg/kg/h for 10 min
followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2 μg/kg/h until 1–
1.5 h before abdomen closure. The propofol effect-site target concentrations were titrated to keep BIS between 40
and 50. If MAP or HR of the patient increased up to 20%
of the initial value, intravenous sufentanil 0.05 μg/kg was
administered. Repeated doses of sufentanil were given
every 5 min to keep the blood pressure around the patient’s baseline values. The amount of sufentanil required
was documented. If the MAP or HR of the patient decreased up to 20% of the initial value, the propofol effectsite target concentrations were adjusted first; if BIS was in
the range of 40–50, ephedrine 5 mg intravenously was administered, and additional doses of ephedrine were permitted every 2 min to maintain haemodynamic stability.
The patient’s nasopharyngeal temperature was maintained
between 36.0 °C and 36.5 °C by WarmTouch™(Covidien,
Bishop’s Stortford, UK). An independent anesthesiologist
(QQP), who wasblinded to the mode of perioperative analgesia, would then complete the recording of the haemodynamic parameters after the bilateral OSTAP blocks.
A Mercedes incision was made about 40 min after the
bilateral OSTAP blocks. The subsequent surgical procedure was performed according to the institutional
standards by four surgical groups. At the end of the surgeries, these patients were then transferred to the postanesthetic care unit (PACU). Each patient’s trachea was
extubated when extubation criteria, including a response
to verbal commands, a spontaneous respiratory rate exceeding 12 breaths/min, Vt more than 5 mL/kg, endtidal carbon dioxide partial pressure < 45 mmHg, and
SPO2 more than 92%, were met.
Postoperative analgesia and antiemetic use
Before the day of the operation, all patients were familiarized with the verbal numerical rating scale (NRS)
evaluation ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst imaginable pain). A standardized postoperative analgesic
regimen was used, which consisted of 40 mg parecoxib
(diluted in 4 mL NS) every 12 h initiated 30 min before
surgery intravenously for a total of 3 days unless contraindicated due to renal insufficiency or coronary heart
disease, etc. The patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device (a PCA pump; GemStar®, Hospira Inc. Lake Forest,
IL, USA) was connected at the end of surgery and was
set to deliver a bolus of 2 μg of sufentanil with a lockout
time of 10 min with a continuous infusion at 1 μg/h.
Local anesthetics were not infiltrated into the surgical
wound intraoperatively. All patients received antibiotic
Guo et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:36 Page 3 of 11

and regular ondansetron 4 mg per day for PONV
prophylaxis until 3 days postoperatively.
Upon extubation, the pain score at rest and on coughing were evaluated by nurses (SJY and LC) who were
blinded to the groups using NRS (0–10). All patients received intravenous sufentanil (2 μg) titration from the
PCA device bolus at 10 min intervals if their NRS scores
were > 3 in PACU. An acute pain service team was responsible for maintenance of the PCA pump according
to the hospital standard. Transition from PACU to the
surgical ward was considered safe when the patient had
achieved > 9 in the modified Aldrete score for at least
10 min. In the ward, pain at rest and on coughing was
recorded for each patient using NRS (0–10) at 2, 4, 12,
24 and 48 h after the operation by the research staff.
Rescue opioid with intravenous sufentanil was provided
by PCA pump bolus when needed. If the patients had
inadequate analgesia after 3–5 bolus doses of sufentanil,
the acute pain service (APS) staff would increase the
bolus dose by 20–25%. If the patient was not satisfied by
sufentanil PCA, intramuscular tramadol was administered for breakthrough pain by physicians on the ward.
Sedation levels were recorded using the Ramsay Sedation Scale. Excessive sedation was defined as a Ramsay
Sedation Scale value of 5 or 6, which required the administration of naloxone.
Data collection
Preoperative and intraoperative variables included age,
gender, weight, height, ASA physical status, liver function tests; estimated intraoperative blood loss (mL); operative time (min); anesthesia time (defined as the time
spent in the operating room in minutes); dosage of intraoperative sufentanil administered. Postoperative variables included NRS scores, cumulative sufentanil
consumption, the incidence of PONV. Ramsay Sedation
Scale scores [11] collected 5 min after extubation, and
2 h, 4 h, 12 h and 24 h after the operation was evaluated
as: [1] the patient is anxious and agitated or restless, or
both; [2] the patient is co-operative, oriented and tranquil; [3] the patient responds to commands only; [4] the
patient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap or
loud auditory stimulus; [5] the patient exhibits a sluggish
response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus;
and [6] the patient exhibits no response.
Dermatome sensory distribution was recorded 30 min
after the OSTAP blockade. The incidence of accidental
vascular or intraperitoneal puncture, and symptoms suggestive of local anesthetic toxicity were also recorded.
All patients were interviewed until 48 h postoperatively.
Complications, such as bruises and swelling at the block
site, were followed up and managed by APS until completely resolved. The haemodynamic parameters were
recorded after the OSTAP blockade at the following
time points: T0, just before the OSTAP blockade; T1,
5 min after the OSTAP blockade; T2, 10 min after the
OSTAP blockade; T3, 20 min after the OSTAP blockade;
T4, 30 min after the OSTAP blockade, T5, just before incision; T6, 3 min after incision; T7, 5 min after incision;
T8, 10 min after laparotomy; T9, 30 min after laparotomy; and T10, 48 h after the operation.
Sample size
The primary outcome was cumulative sufentanil consumption24h after surgery(intraoperative sufentanilconsumptionand 24 h after operationsufentanilconsumption)
in this study. The secondary outcome included the time
required to extubate, postoperative NRS scores, side effects, and haemodynamic variations perioperatively. In
our preliminary trial of 18 patients, the cumulative sufentanil consumptionwere 89.45 ± 15.5 μg and 80.35 ± 12.
89 μg in group C and in group T within 24 h after surgery,
respectively. According to the preliminary study, we calculated that 32 patients would be required in each group for
a 90% power to detect 10% reduction of cumulativesufentanil consumption at the α level of 0.05. To account for
any patient dropouts or missing data, we planned to enroll
40 patients per study group.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzedusing SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was
used to check for normal distribution. Parametric data
were expressed as mean with95% confidence intervalsand nonparametric data as median with interquartile
range. Group means were compared using the Student’s
t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test as appropriate. For
continuous data, overall differences were tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc test
with least significant difference t-test (LSD) or KruskalWallis test followed by a Mann–Whitney U test when
appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as
values and percentages and were compared using the χ2
test. Significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Results
A total of 126 patients were assessed for eligibility; 19
did not meet the inclusion criteria; 27 refused to participate. A total of 10 patients were excluded from the final
analysis because of a change of operative plan (n = 1);
failure to complete the 30 min observation period after
OSTAP (n = 2); intraoperative bleeding > 500 mL(n = 1);
operative time > 6 h (n = 2); unplanned postoperative
mechanical ventilation (n = 3); and failed blockade in
group T (n = 1). Data were analyzedon 35 patients in
each group (Fig 1).

Preoperative parameters
The demographics and preoperative details of the
remaining 70 patients are presented in Table 1. There
were no significant differences between the two groups
with respect to age, weight, ASA class, past medical history of diabetes or hypertension, preoperative laboratory
studies, including international normalized ratio, prothrombin time, total bilirubin and aspartate
aminotransferase.
Intraoperative parameters
Surgical and anesthetic characteristics are shown in
Table 2. No significant differences were observed in incision length, time from classic TAP block to incision, operative time, estimated intraoperative blood loss and
intravenous cystaloids administered between group C
and group T. In addition, no significant difference was
found among the five surgical teams or anesthetists between the two groups. In group T, less intraoperative
propofol dosage was required compared with group C,
but the difference was not statistically significant (Table
2). Compared with group C, the time to extubation was
significantly shorter in group T (P = 0.02). There were
no differences between the two groups regarding the
number of patients using ephedrine (vasopressor). However, the number of patients that required a vasodilator
intraoperatively in group T was significantly less than
that in group C (P = 0.002).

OSTAP blockade
In both groups, the OSTAP was easily performed using
ultrasonography, and the procedures were carried out
without any complications. During statistics, the effect
of OSTAP blockade was checked one by one in both
groups. In group C, no patients had the dermatome sensory distribution by pinprick approach. One patient had
failed blocks in Group T and was excluded from the final
analysis. The OSTAP block in group T resulted in a
distribution of sensory block ranging from T5 to T11
(Fig. 2). None of the patients suffered from any complications related to the bilateral OSTAP block, such as
vascular or intraperitoneal puncture, local anesthetics
systemic toxicity, bruises or swelling at the block site.
Perioperative pain control
The intraoperative sufentanil use in group T was significantly less than that in group C (P = 0.001). Compared
with group C, cumulative sufentanil consumption at
5 min after extubation, and 2 h, 4 h, 12 h and 24 h after
the operation was significantly lower in group T (P = 0.
001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.044, respectively) (Fig 3).
Nevertheless, no significant difference was found in the
cumulative sufentanil consumption at 48 h after opertation between the two groups (P = 0.181). Following discharge from the recovery unit to the one-day surgery
ward, there were no differences between the groups in
the requirements for non-opioid analgesic medication.
However, four patients in group C and one in group T
could not be satisfied by sufentanil PCA and they received intramuscular tramadol 100 mg for breakthrough
pain. Group C required more rescue tramadol compared
to group T, but the difference was not statisticallysignificant (P > 0.05).
Both groups delivered good analgesia at rest. However,
compared with group C, the OSTAP block significantly reduced postoperative NRS pain scores at rest, with (median
(interquartile range)) at 2 h after the operation (2 [1, 2] vs.
2 [1–3]) and 4 h after the operation (1 [1, 2] vs 2 [1–3]).
NRS scores at the time of coughing were also significantly
lower in group T than in group C at all time points except
5 min after extubation (all P < 0.001) (Table 3).

Nausea, vomiting and sedation
Compared to group T, group C demonstrated a higher
incidence of nausea between 4 h and 8 h after the operation (22.9% vs 5.71%; P < 0.05). However, there were no
significant differences on the sedation score, the number
of times of vomiting and hypotension postoperatively
(P > 0.05; Fig. 4). The incidence of pruritus was very low,
and there was no significant difference between both
groups (1 vs. 1 postoperatively; P > 0.05) (Table 4).
Hemodynamics
According to the protocol, the hemodynamics parameters were also recorded before and after the OSTAP
block and at incision. There were no significant differences between baseline values of HR (T0) and at T1
through T10. In addition, there was no statistically
significant difference of HR between the two groups at
all time points (P > 0.05; Fig. 4). Compared to baseline
values, the MAP after laparotomy was significantly
higher in both groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 3); however, there
was no significant difference between the two groups
(P > 0.05; Fig. 4). Moreover, there was no significant difference in HR and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry
(Sp02) between the two groups (P > 0.05; data not
shown).
Postoperative complications
No patients suffered from liver dysfunction postoperatively. Postoperative complications included pulmonary
infection (four in group C and two in group T occurred
3 days after the operation, P > 0.05) and renal insufficiency (one in group T 2 days postoperatively,P > 0.05).
Finally, all the patients were discharged home in a good
condition.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this was the first observe blinded
randomized and controlled study to evaluate the use of
the OSTAP blockade for patients undergoing an open
liver resection with a Mercedes incision. We found that
when comparing the control group OSTAP with saline,
the ropivacaine OSTAP blockade had improved perioperative analgesia with decreased opioid use both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Furthermore, the
ropivacaine OSTAP blockade decreased the intraoperative vasodilator use, the extubation time, the incidence

of nausea, and the pain scores, which were reported
from 0 to 4 h postoperatively. It demonstrated that the
OSTAP blockade with ropivacine offers postoperative
analgesic benefit for the Mercedes incision in patients
undergoing hepatectomy.
Liver cancer is one of the most common malignancies
worldwide, especially in China. Hepatic resection is currently the best choice among all therapeutic strategies.
As part of the multimodal approach for perioperative
analgesia, classic TAP block has been widely accepted in
patients who have undergone lower abdominal surgery,
with an evident reduction of the morphine requirement
within the first 24 h postoperatively, and a significant
decrease of opioid-related side effects, such as PONV [2,
7, 9, 12–14]. There are three common approaches of
performing a TAP blockade: subcostal, classic midaxillary and ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric. The distribution of
local anesthetic and the extent of sensory blockade differ
among these three approaches [9, 12]. For the upper abdomen operation, Hebbard [15] originally described the
OSTAP approach in 2008, which was thought to exhibit
effective analgesia involving dermatomes T6–T10 (for
upper abdominal surgery). Lee et al. [16] found that the
subcostal approach may block as cephalad as T8 (interquartile range T7–T9). Recently, the OSTAP block was
reported to produce better analgesia than the classic
TAP block or intravenous opioid analgesia during the
first postoperative 24 h period in patients undergoing
laparoscopic cholecystectomy [17]. Based on this investigation, we used the subcostal approach to perform a
TAP block for open hepatectomy. Our findings were in
agreement with existing investigations on upper abdominal
surgery with a bilateral OSTAP blockade [7–9, 18–20].
To our knowledge,there are few reports on the use of
the TAP block for major hepatobiliary surgery [3, 6, 10].
Eldin et al. [3] demonstrated that combining postoperative continuous TAP (3 days) and intravenous PCA

improved postoperative pain management and reduced
fentanyl consumption, with a shorter stay in the intensive care unit for the patient undergoing liver resection
with an inverted L-shape incision. The most common
approaches for hepatectomy are midline, J-shaped, and
Mercedes incisions. Usually, the incision type used depends on the surgeon’s preference and experience.
Demirbas et al. [21] concluded that the duration of analgesics use was longer in the J-shaped incision than in
the Mercedes incision. Mercedes incisions have been the
most frequently used by our liver surgeons for adequate
exposure of the liver from surrounding structures. This
incision was performed along the path of vessels and
nerves, which resulted in lighter tension on the incision
and less damage to vessels and nerves of the abdominal
wall. Moreover, this incision has been reported to provide faster healing and a better cosmetic outcome.
A recent meta-analysis [8] suggested that the optimal
time for TAP block placement should be preoperatively,
as opioid requirement and pain score were significantly
reduced in comparison with that of TAP block performed postoperatively. In this investigation, we performed the OSTAP block before general anesthesia
induction and endotracheal intubation. Our results
showed that several intraoperative parameters in group
T, including sufentanil dosage, the number of patients
who used a vasodilator and the time to extubation, were
significantly less than those in group C. Compared with
group C, cumulative sufentanil consumption till postoperative24h and NRS pain scores at 2 h and 4 h postopertively decreased significantly in group T. Our results
were consistent with previous findings where TAP
blocks have been described to last from 6 h to 24 h
using ropivacaine [7, 16, 22–24]. The duration of the
peripheral nerve block depends on several factors, such
as the choice of local anesthetics, the site of injection
and the presence of adjuncts. Ropivacaine is the most
frequently used local anesthetic for peripheral nerve
block in the People’s Republic of China [22]. Lee et al.
[16] demonstrated that maximal dermatome spread was
observed at 30 min and usually regressed by 24 h. Although few studies have shown the analgesic effect lasting longer than 24 h [25], Stoving et al. [24]
demonstrated that the blockade duration of ultrasoundguided unilateral TAP block with 20 mL 75 mg/mL ropivacaine was approximately 10 h with a large variation in
healthy volunteers. A meta-analysis about the analgesic
efficacy of TAP in 31 controlled trials including 1611
adult participants who underwent abdominal laparotomy, abdominal laparoscopy, or caesarean delivery,
showed that pain scores at rest and on movement were
reduced at 6 h postoperatively. In addition, TAP block
reduced intravenous morphine consumption at 6 h and
12 h postoperatively [7]. Therefore, using a longer-acting
local anesthetic, such as liposomal bupivacaine [2, 26,
27] or continuous TAP blocks [2, 10, 28] with catheters
may provide extended duration, longer pain control in
the postoperative period and, therefore, further decrease
the need for postoperative opioids. Randomizedtrials are
needed to further investigate the effect of continuous
TAP blocks or liposomal bupivacaine on the pain control and the patients’ recovery after hepatectomy.
Tominimizeconfounding factors and increase comparability, we elected to keep the external conditions and
procedures identical between the two groups. In this investigation, sensory block was assessed 10 min, 20 min
and 30 min after the block was placed, and one patent
in group T was excluded from the final analysis because
of a failed blockade. Mitchel et al. [19] conducted an experiment in awake volunteers and found that an
ultrasound-guided OSTAP blockade can have a dermotomal span up to T4–L4 segments with maximal sensory
loss after 30 min. Lee et al. [16] found that the subcostal
approach blocked a median of four segments (interquartile range 3–5), with the most cephalad being T8 (interquartile range T7–T9). Maximum dermatomal spread
was observed at 30 min. In this study, the OSTAP block
in group T resulted in a distribution of sensory block
ranging from T5 to T11, which is less than that reported
by Wassef et al. [29]. The time for incision in this investigation was 40 min after OSTAP, which was at the peak
of the blockade effect. No significant differences were
observed in incision length, time from TAP to incision,
operative time, estimated total intraoperative blood loss
or amount of intravenous fluid administered between
group C and group T. The two anesthesiologists performing the OSTAP blocks or intraoperative anesthesia
management were blinded to the study; and the nurses
who recorded the parameters and the postoperative
follow-up were also blinded to this investigation.
One of the main concerns about the OSTAP blockade
is the systemic toxicity of the local anesthetics. The
study by Griffiths et al. [30]reported potentially toxic
ropivacaine concentrations following the use of TAP
blocks in gynecologic surgery when a similar total dose
of ropivacaine (3 mg/kg) was used. Toju et al. [31] found
that the administration of ropivacaine at 3 mg/kg during
OSTAP led to rapid increases in plasma concentration
during the first 2 h after the blockade and the Cmax
nearly reached the threshold for systemic toxicity. Ropivacaine is predominantly eliminated by extensive metabolism in the liver, which depends on hepatic blood flow
as well as the degree of protein binding. Edouard et al.
[32] reported that the resection of three or more liver
segments was associated with a 53% decrease in the free
ropivacaine clearance. Therefore, the first limitation was
that we did not measure plasma ropivacaine concentrations in group T perioperatively, although none of the
Guo et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2018) 18:36 Page 9 of 11

patients had symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (e.g. tinnitus, seizures, cardiovascular collapse) either immediately following the OSTAP blocks or in the
PACU postoperatively. In addition, patients in this investigation were not followed up beyond hospital discharge
at postoperative day for potential chronic pain. Finally,
these data represent the experience at a single academic
institution with ASA III or less patients with relatively
low BMI, and may not be generalizable to the broader
international population.
Conclusion
The ultrasound-guided OSTAP block has become an important analgesic modality for upper abdominal surgery,
such as the hepatectomy with a Mercedes incision. It
provids an opioid-sparing analgesic effect without obvious side effects. However, the modest duration of a single shot OSTAP is a significant limitation. OSTAP with
continuous catheterization or with local anesthetics of
longer duration needs to be further investigated.
