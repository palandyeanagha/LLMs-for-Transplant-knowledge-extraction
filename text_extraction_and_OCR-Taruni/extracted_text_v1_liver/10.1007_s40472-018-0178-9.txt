Abstract
Purpose of Review The purpose of this review was to summarise how machine perfusion could contribute to viability assessment
of donor livers.
Recent Findings In both hypothermic and normothermic machine perfusion, perfusate transaminase measurement has allowed
pretransplant assessment of hepatocellular damage. Hypothermic perfusion permits transplantation of marginal grafts but as yet
has not permitted formal viability assessment. Livers undergoing normothermic perfusion have been investigated using parameters similar to those used to evaluate the liver in vivo. Lactate clearance, glucose evolution and pH regulation during normothermic perfusion seem promising measures of viability. In addition, bile chemistry might inform on cholangiocyte viability and
the likelihood of post-transplant cholangiopathy.
Summary While the use of machine perfusion technology has the potential to reduce and even remove uncertainty regarding liver
graft viability, analysis of large datasets, such as those derived from large multicenter trials of machine perfusion, are needed to
provide sufficient information to enable viability parameters to be defined and validated .

Introduction
The assessment of donor liver viability before transplantation
has traditionally involved pre-retrieval review of the donor
circumstances and biochemistry, followed by visual appraisal
of the organ in situ in the donor. This has been further refined
by the development of prognostic models which give an estimation of the risk of graft failure based on multivariate analysis of large donor datasets, so called donor risk indices [1•,
2–4]. These indices include factors relating to donor age, sex,
race, height, cause of death (trauma, stroke, anoxia or other),
bilirubin, smoking history, the location of the donor in relation
to the transplant centre, whether the graft was whole, split, or a
partial graft, whether from a brain dead or circulatory death
donor and cold ischaemic time [1•, 3, 4].
While such indices have helped reduce uncertainty about
the suitability of a liver for transplantation, they have not
eliminated it. There are many reasons for this, some of which
are enumerated below:
1. Causes of death
While all indices have a broad category distinguishing
causes of death associated with better and worse outcomes for the liver following transplantation (e.g. trauma
and stroke, respectively), other causes of death may have
adverse effects on graft outcomes (e.g. carbon monoxide
poisoning). In addition, hepatic ischaemia prior to death
(e.g. as a result of an out of hospital cardiac arrest) will
have different graft outcomes depending when in the

recovery from the initial ischaemic insult the organ was
retrieved from the donor and transplanted.
2. Mechanism of death
While donor risk indices include a variable for livers
donated after circulatory death (DCD), none include any
variable relating to the duration of the withdrawal phase
(withdrawal of treatment to circulatory arrest) or the duration of asystole (circulatory arrest to cold in situ perfusion) which may be important outcome determinants [5].
Animal work has documented the adverse hormonal and
haemodynamic changes occurring in this period which
affect graft outcomes [6, 7]. Similarly, brain death in
donation after brain death (DBD) donors has complex
and widespread consequences that affect all organs. The
autonomic reflex response to increasing intracranial pressure includes the release of massive quantities of catecholamines; this release causes peripheral vasospasm
and reduced organ perfusion. In the process of brain
death, hemodynamic instability worsens, with loss of
sympathetic vascular tone and hypovolemia as a consequence of diabetes insipidus. Brain death also results in a
range of pro-inflammatory and immune responses that
affect the donor liver and impair outcome [8–10].
Variables, such as the time from brain death to donation,
have been shown to affect outcomes in renal transplantation and may have similar effects on liver outcomes [11].
None of these are taken into account in the different risk
indices.
3. Pre-donation management
A number of different donor treatment strategies have
been suggested to influence the outcomes of transplanted
organs. One of the most recent is the induction of mild
hypothermia (35 ± 0.5 °C) in DBD donors which has been
shown to reduce delayed graft function in renal transplantation, and to be particularly beneficial to extended criteria
donor kidneys [12].
4. Steatosis
Steatosis is well recognised as an adverse factor, one
associated with primary non-function and early allograft
dysfunction [13]. It is not included in any of the above
prognostic models and is difficult to quantify accurately in
the donor [14].
5. Extraction time
Recent work has shown that the period of time taken to
extract kidneys from the donor and place them into cold
storage influences early outcome significantly [15], and it
is likely that the time taken to extract the liver has a similar
adverse effect. Although flushed with cold preservation
solution in situ, it takes some time for the liver to cool
down [16], and during prolonged extraction, it is probable
that some rewarming occurs that might have an effect on
short- and long-term outcome.
6. Recipient factors
Recipient variables also affect the outcome of liver transplantation and should be kept in mind when selecting an appropriate donor liver [17, 18].
It is against this background of uncertainty that liver transplant surgeons are challenged to decide whether or not to use a
liver graft, and in whom to use it, knowing also that a decision
not to proceed leaves their patient at risk of death on the
waiting list. In 2015 in the USA, 1673 (11%) patients died
on the waiting list and 1227 (8%) were removed due to being
too sick, while 703 livers were retrieved but not transplanted,
representing 9.6% of all retrieved livers [19, 20]. A similar
picture is seen in the UK and across the Eurotransplant region,
with around 18% of patients dying or being removed from the
waiting list while potentially viable DBD and DCD livers go
unused [21, 22].
This review summarises some principles that might be used
for viability assessment as well as recent advances and current
limitations of liver graft viability assessment using extracorporeal machine perfusion technologies.
In assessing viability, it is important to independently assess the major liver cellular compartments.
Viability Assessment of the Hepatocellular
Compartment: Metabolic Zonation
The range of biochemical tests examining hepatocellular
function makes their interpretation complex, but we believe that the interpretation is helped by considering the
tests in the context of metabolic zonation of the liver.
Zonation refers to the functional specialisation of different
hepatocytes along the liver lobule and is related to the
exposure of zone 1 (periportal) hepatocytes to the inflow
of blood with higher levels of oxygen, hormones, and metabolic substrates compared to zone 3 hepatocytes. Figure 1
illustrates the zonal distribution of some of the processes
occurring in vivo. During extracorporeal perfusion, the liver is subject to different levels of oxygen and different
zonal oxygen gradients, may be free of hormonal influence
and is exposed to artificial concentrations of substrate depending on the perfusate used, all of which may modify the
zonal behaviour.
Glucose metabolism was the first process to be identified as having zonal metabolic differences [23], with gluconeogenesis occurring in zone 1 and glycolysis in zone 3.
Lactate metabolism is an oxygen and ATP-dependent process predominantly occurring in zone 1. Impaired lactate
clearance implies zone 1 damage, and since zone 1 would
be the last zone to be deprived of a supply of oxygenated
blood, it may actually signify a pan-lobular injury.
Conversely, an ischaemic injury to zones 2 and 3 may not
affect lactate clearance; hence, lactate clearance is a relative insensitive marker of moderate damage, but may be a
Curr Transpl Rep (2018) 5:72–81 73

useful marker of viability. Damage to zones 2 and 3 may
affect the incorporation of circulating glucose into glycogen, and therefore, perfusate glucose might be a marker of
severe damage signifying impaired liver viability.
Hepatic regulation of acid-base balance depends upon
the differential metabolism of glutamine along the lobule
[24, 25]. Ammonia is transported as glutamine to the liver
where it is hydrolysed by glutaminase to glutamate and
ammonia, and the ammonia then enters the urea cycle to
form urea. Glutaminase activity is largely confined to zone
1, and its activity is pH dependent, being inhibited in the
presence of an acidosis. Urea synthesis can occur across
zones 1, 2 and the first part of zone 3; residual ammonia is
taken up by glutamine synthetase which is located in the
cells immediately adjacent the central veins [26].
Interruption of ammonia metabolism will compromise the
liver’s ability to regulate pH, resulting in worsening
acidosis.
Other metabolic processes may be used to demonstrate
liver synthetic function, such as the production of coagulation factors, albumin and complement. To be useful,
there need to be rapid and sensitive assays for such
metabolic products. Metabolic processes involved in drug
metabolism are also distributed along the lobule, providing
an opportunity to interrogate the integrity of each zone
with the appropriate reagent.
Interrogating liver zones will reveal a pattern of damage, but will not necessarily give a global impression of
functional liver reserve. Markers of hepatocellular damage,
such as transaminase release into the perfusate, give an
indication of damage, from which the amount of residual
function may be inferred, but they are limited as markers of
viability. Evaluating the ability of the liver to metabolise a
substrate known to be metabolised by all liver zones may
provide an estimate, and such assays are currently under
development but are yet to be validated in an extracorporeal circuit [27]. Unlike other organs, the liver has a remarkable regenerative ability and it remains to be defined
what level of injury, what threshold of residual functional
capacity and which recipient circumstances are required to
guarantee complete functional recovery of the liver and
survival of the recipient post-transplant.
Viability Assessment of the Cholangiocyte
Compartment: Bile Biochemistry
While evaluation of hepatocellular function should enable
avoidance of primary non-function of the liver, it will not
predict cholangiopathy. To assess the bile duct, different physiological processes need to be monitored.
The amount of bile production has been commonly cited
as a marker of liver viability [28, 29], but in our initial
experience, the volume of bile produced does not appear
to correlate with graft function post-transplant [30•, 31].
Bile production is a combination of two processes, bile
salt-dependent secretion by biliary canaliculi (also known
as the bile acid dependent canalicular fraction) and bile salt
independent secretion [32]. Once in the bile ducts, the bile
is subject to modification by cholangiocytes by resorptive
and secretory processes, which add bicarbonate and water,
and reabsorb glucose, amino acids and bile salts. The bile
salt-dependent fraction of bile forms around a third of normal bile, and bile salts are either synthesised by the liver or
derived from sinusoidal blood as part of the enterohepatic
circulation. In an isolated perfused liver, with no supplementary bile salts added, this fraction is likely to be very
small unless bile salts are added to the perfusate [33]. The
bile salt-independent production of bile may also be adversely affected by ex situ perfusion. For example,
hyperglycaemia, independent of diabetes, has been shown
to reduce the production of bile by affecting the
cholangiocyte’s absorptive processes; as the cells absorb
the higher quantities of glucose, they take up more water
from the bile (see below) [34]. Hence, in the presence of

is rich in hormones, nutrients and oxygen. Periportal (zone 1) metabolic
processes will include those requiring such conditions, while perivenous
(zone 3) hepatocytes may preferentially include those metabolic
processes that are less dependent on high levels of oxygen, for
example, or those requiring products made in the periportal
hepatocytes, such as urea

the high glucose concentrations seen in many liver perfusions, the volume of bile salt-independent bile produced
could be reduced.
Assessment of the Vascular Compartment:
Vascular Resistance
Disruption of the endothelial cell lining and the no reflow
phenomenon cause an increase in vascular resistance that
reflects endothelial damage and viability, although oedema
may also influence blood flow to an organ [35]. When a
liver is removed from cold storage and reperfused on a
machine, vascular resistance is high but falls quickly, both
during hypothermic perfusion and normothermic perfusion
(personal observations) [36, 37]. This resistance pattern is
similar to that seen in hypothermic perfusion of kidneys,
and in that setting, resistance is commonly cited as discriminating good from bad kidneys, although the evidence
for a threshold value is absent [38, 39]. In a similar manner,
some authors have quoted arterial and portal flows as
markers of viability [40••, 41], although absolute values
of flow are unhelpful without knowledge of perfusion pressure. While there are some preliminary animal data suggesting that portal (and not hepatic arterial) resistance may
be discriminatory [30•], this remains to be substantiated.
Portal resistance is also affected by the pressure in the
hepatic veins, which varies according to which perfusion
machine is used and the method of caval drainage (negative pressure or passive drainage), so absolute values will
depend on the circumstance of perfusion.
Assessment of the Immune Cell Compartment
The final compartment that contributes to reperfusion injury, and hence viability, is the immune compartment. The
liver is host to numerous different leucocyte populations
such as Kupffer cells and dendritic cells, all of which may
respond to ischaemia-reperfusion injury by production of
inflammatory proteins such as cytokines and damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [42–44]. Our unpublished observations show release of large quantities of
chemokines, including interleukins-6, -8, -10, -18 and
monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1/CCL2), into the
perfusate reflecting activation of the immune cell compartment [42, 43]. This is in contrast to results from hypothermic oxygenated liver perfusion [45, 46]. The ability to
measure the degree of immune cell activation during normothermic perfusion in real time may give another dimension to predicting viability post-transplant. It is also one
area that is potentially modifiable during perfusion, with
the addition of leucocyte filters to reduce the circulating
numbers of emergent liver immune cells and direct chemokine inhibitors to moderate immune activation.
Hypothermic Perfusion
One certainty is that the longer the liver remains in static cold
storage, the poorer the function. It is possible that some of the
effects of hypothermic storage may be mitigated by oxygenated machine perfusion. Two groups have led the evaluation
of hypothermic extracorporeal liver perfusion. Guarrera and
colleagues were the first to evaluate clinical hypothermic machine perfusion, and although not incorporating an oxygenator into their circuit, analysis of perfusate showed that some
oxygenation was achieved passively in the organ chamber
[46, 47]. The other group to pioneer hypothermic perfusion
is that of Dutkowski and colleagues, who perfused the portal
vein alone with actively oxygenated perfusate in a technique
they termed hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) [48].
This has been followed by Porte and colleagues performing
hypothermic oxygenated perfusion of both artery and portal
vein or Dual-HOPE (D-HOPE) [49]. Hypothermic extracorporeal liver perfusion has been shown to be associated with
good outcomes for livers that would ordinarily be considered
marginal, either because of their DCD status or because of
other poor prognostic factors [46, 48, 49]. There appears to be
a direct benefit in reducing expression of proinflammatory
cytokines [46], down-regulation of Kupffer cell activity
[45], replenishing ATP stores [50] as well as reducing vascular resistance [51, 52]. All of these may contribute to the
function and marked absence of biliary complications, including cholangiopathy, in DCD livers that have experienced
prolonged warm ischaemia [53•]. Replenishing oxygen at
low temperature may also have the advantage of avoiding
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [54, 55•],
while in contrast, the generation of ROS during normothermia has been cited as a complication of aggressive oxygenation during normothermic perfusion with resultant post reperfusion syndrome and vasoplegia [31]. Whether hypothermic
extracorporeal liver perfusion improves long-term outcomes
is the subject of ongoing randomised controlled clinical trials
(NCT01317342; NCT03124641; NCT03031067;
NCT02584283).
Assessment of the liver’s functional capacity during
cold perfusion is difficult, since metabolic processes are
differentially affected by hypothermia and may be unrepresentative of function at normothermia. Nevertheless, biochemical analysis of the perfusate may provide insight into
the degree of hepatocellular damage sustained before and
during preservation [56], but simple analysis of the effluent
from flushing out the cold storage solution during bench
work might be equally insightful. Pacheco et al. have previously shown a relationship between the transaminase
Curr Transpl Rep (2018) 5:72–81 75

content of the effluent washed out of the graft immediately
before reperfusion and the post-transplant levels in the recipient [57], and more recently, Hoyer et al. showed that
the ALT levels during controlled rewarming also mirrored
levels post-reperfusion in the recipient [58]. We have also
demonstrated that effluent cold storage solution washed
out immediately prior to normothermic perfusion correlates with ALT levels during normothermic perfusion and
that perfusion levels in turn correlate with post-transplant
transaminase levels [36].
Normothermic Perfusion
The technique of normothermic extracorporeal liver perfusion
(NELP) typically involves perfusing a red cell-based perfusate
through hepatic artery and portal vein at physiological pressures and incorporates a heater/oxygenator into the circuit to
maintain temperature and oxygenation. In contrast to hypothermic perfusion, NELP provides an opportunity to assess
viability using similar biochemical assessments that are
employed clinically. The viability assessment itself needs to
include evaluation of both hepatocellular and biliary components of injury and function. Any functionality assessment
must also recognise that the ability to function in an isolated
artificial circulation of around 2 l is not the same as being able
to function in vivo.
The absence of validated criteria for viability assessment has not prevented clinical evaluation of NELP, initially in case reports used to assess marginal grafts [59],
and latterly in small clinical studies [31, 40••, 41, 60, 61].
Table 1 compares recent studies of NELP with respect to
measures used to assess livers during normothermic perfusion, with reference to hepatocellular and biliary compartments. As can be seen, lactate clearance and bile output are
the most common functional measures, with transaminase
levels as markers of hepatocellular damage. What is more
surprising is the absence of assessment of cholangiocyte
integrity in many reports.
Hepatocellular Compartment During Normothermic
Perfusion
Lactate clearance is the most widely accepted measure of liver
function during normothermic perfusion, but it depends only
on the viability of zone 1 hepatocytes and not zones 2 and 3. In
a small volume perfusion circuit, a relatively small number of
viable hepatocytes may be sufficient to clear lactate, and
hence, clearance of lactate is not necessarily a marker of viability. Conversely, an inability to clear lactate may represent
damage to zone 1 hepatocytes (and thus usually a pan lobular
injury) or may be due to concomitant lactate production, as
may happen when an aberrant lobar artery is not perfused.
Figure 2 shows typical biochemical profiles during
NELP. The raised perfusate glucose which characterises
most NELPs is likely to be in part due to glycogen breakdown (zone 3), in part due to the metabolism of lactate and
in part due to glucose synthesis from circulating amino
acids and pyruvate, although glucose synthesis is likely
to be inhibited in the presence of high concentrations of
circulating glucose. Glycogen breakdown is an oxygenindependent ATP-independent process occurring during
hypothermia [68, 69]. It continues early after reperfusion
during NELP, but in viable livers, the high levels of circulating glucose should block glycogenolysis and stimulate
glycogenesis. As a result, perfusate glucose falls, reflecting
zone 3 integrity. In some perfusions, however, the perfusate glucose may not rise, and as such may imply glycogen
depletion or pan-lobular injury; in such circumstances, a
glucose challenge may discriminate between the two, since
in the glycogen-depleted liver, the added glucose will be
metabolised or converted to glycogen. It is possible that a
liver with marked disruption of zone 3 metabolism may
exhibit a persistently high perfusate glucose, as the ability
to incorporate glucose into glycogen is impaired. This interpretation of these observations remains to be proven.
Ammonia metabolism plays a crucial role in the liver’s
ability to regulate pH. Interruption of ammonia metabolism
will therefore result in worsening acidosis. Hence, the requirement for additional alkali supplementation to maintain
a near physiological pH during normothermic extracorporeal
liver perfusion implies a larger lobular injury affecting all
zones.
Cholangiocyte Compartment During Normothermic
Perfusion
Cholangiocyte viability during NELP can be monitored by the
degree to which the bile has undergone secretory and resorptive modification, and in particular, the secretion of bicarbonate to deprotonate bile acids and the removal of glucose [32,
70]. Deprotonation is believed to be necessary to prevent
cholangiocyte damage by bile acids within the duct and is
achieved largely by bicarbonate secretion [71, 72]. Thus, in
the presence of normal cholangiocyte function, bile should
have an alkali pH; our early results suggest that a pH > 7.5 is
associated with viable cholangiocytes and no post-transplant
cholangiopathy [36].
Glucose absorption by cholangiocytes facilitates water absorption from bile [70], and its concentration in bile should be
≤ 1 mmol/L in the context of a normal plasma glucose of 4 to
8 mmol/L [73]. Assessment of bile glucose during NELP is
more complex, since the perfusate glucose concentration is
frequently supra-physiological. Nevertheless, a biliary glucose ≤ 3 mmol/L or a bile/perfusate gradient ≥ 10 mmol/L
was associated with viable ducts in our series [36].

The lack of viability criteria also hampers development
of optimal protocols and perfusates for NELP, since without a validated viability endpoint, the results of clinical and
preclinical studies are difficult to interpret. Instead, NELP
has been introduced as a tool to reassure surgeons, but as
such, it has not completely removed “gut feeling” in deciding whether or not to use a liver, in particular a marginal
liver. In addition, there is little evidence to date that moderate periods of NELP are superior to hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion. Indeed, the incidence of primary
non-function, early allograft dysfunction and
cholangiopathy in early reports of NELP contrasts with

Years of preclinical perfusion research, focusing on machine perfusion as a preservation method, are now translating into the clinic. While the use of machine perfusion
technology has the scope to reduce and potentially even
remove uncertainty regarding liver graft viability, there remains an element of gut feeling when determining whether
or not to transplant a machine-perfused liver.
Although hypothermic oxygenated perfusion has been
shown to permit transplantation of marginal grafts, it has
not, to date, afforded the ability to verify viability before
implantation. Normothermic extracorporeal liver perfusion provides more information regarding liver function,
and normal biochemical parameters during perfusion are
readily recognised. However, interpretation of data relating to less than ideal livers remains challenging, in particular differentiating viable from non-viable. Introduction
of the technology in the absence of clear guidance regarding viability has allowed accumulation of data to inform
assessment, albeit with a risk of using a graft that will not
work, or which may be associated with long-term problems such as cholangiopathy. More data are needed before
meaningful and accurate guidance can be produced.
