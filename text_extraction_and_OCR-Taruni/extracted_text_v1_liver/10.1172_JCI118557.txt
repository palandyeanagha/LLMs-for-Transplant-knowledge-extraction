Abstract
The marked tropism of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) for
natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes has led us to investigate the effect of HHV-6 on cellular cytotoxicity. We
describe here how HHV-6 infection of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) leads to upregulation of their
NK cell cytotoxicity. The induction of NK cell activity by
HHV-6 was abrogated by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to
IL-15 but not by mAbs to other cytokines (IFN-a, IFN-g,
TNF-a, TNF-b, IL-2, IL-12) suggesting that IL-15 secreted
in response to viral infection was responsible for the observed effect. Furthermore, NK activation by HHV-6 was
blocked with mAb to CD122, as well as by human anti–
HHV-6 neutralizing antibodies. Using RT-PCR, we were
able to detect IL-15 mRNA upregulation in purified monocyte and NK cell preparations. IL-15 protein synthesis was
increased in response to HHV-6. Finally, addition of IL-15
to PBMC cultures was found to severely curtail HHV-6 expression. Taken together, our data suggest that enhanced
NK activity in response to viral infection represent a natural anti-viral defense mechanism aimed at rapidly eliminating virus-infected cells. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1373–

Introduction
Natural killer (NK)1 cells are lymphocytes capable of killing
tumor cells and virus-infected cells independently of MHC restriction (1, 2). Their importance in viral immunosurveillance
in vivo is evidenced by the fact that patients lacking NK cells
are subject to multiple infections by herpesviruses (3, 4). One
herpesvirus gaining medical interest since its discovery in 1986
(5) is the human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6). This virus’ growing
importance in immunobiology is partly attributable to its ability to infect CD41 T lymphocytes, the main cellular target of
HIV-1; interestingly, HHV-6 has been shown to interact with
HIV-1 (6–9). Infection of T cells by HHV-6 leads to the downregulation of CD3 molecule (10), upregulation of CD4 molecule (11) and inhibition of both IL-2 synthesis (12) and cellular
proliferation (12–14). HHV-6 can also infect other immunocompetent cells such as B and CD81 T lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, megakaryocytes and NK cells (11, 15–18).
It has been reported that NK cells rapidly internalize HHV-6
(i.e., within 1 h) but signs of productive infection are only observed if cells are cultured for several weeks prior to infection,
a time at which no residual NK cytotoxic activity is observed
(18). Infection of NK cells by HHV-6 also leads to upregulation of CD4 molecules on the cell surface which correlates with
susceptibility of these cells to HIV-1 infection (18).
NK cells are known to represent an important natural defense mechanism in controlling viral infection (1–2), and the
ability of NK effectors to lyse autologous HHV-6-infected
PBMC has been reported (19). However, there are no studies
on the consequences of HHV-6 infection on NK cell activity
per se. One group has reported that during the acute febrile
phase of HHV-6 infection there was a significant increase in
NK cytotoxicity when compared to the NK activity observed
during convalescence (20). Our objective was to learn more
about, and evaluate the potential effect of, HHV-6 infection
on NK cell activity. Our results clearly show an enhancement
of NK activity during the early phase of infection (24–48 h);
this enhancement is abrogated by neutralizing antibodies to
IL-15 as well as by anti-CD122 mAbs which react with the b
subunit of the IL-2 receptor. IL-15 is a recently described cytokine of 14 kD first isolated from a simian epithelial cell line
(21). Another group has also isolated a cytokine from the human leukemic Hut102 cell line, designated IL-T, which resembles closely IL-15 (22). IL-15 shares biological activities with
IL-2 such as stimulation of T cell proliferation, induction of cytotoxic T cells and lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell generation (21–23). IL-15 mediates its action through binding to
the CD122 molecule as well as to the common gamma chain
receptor (21, 23, 24). The present results show for the first time
that the early events of immune cell activation such as NK cell
cytotoxicity observed following infection by HHV-6, a human
lymphotropic herpesvirus, are mediated via IL-15 induction,
and also confirm that this cytokine is indeed a potent stimulator of NK activity. Our data may also explain the increase in
NK activity during the acute febrile phase of HHV-6 infection
(exanthem subitum) reported by other investigators (20).
Methods
Cell lines and viruses. HSB-2, K562 and CEM NKr cell lines were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
(Rockville, MD) cells were obtained through the National Institutes
of Health AIDS Research and References Reagent Program (Bethesda, MD). These cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics

(i.e., complete medium). HHV-6 (GS strain) (5) was propagated in
HSB-2 cells as previously described (25). Virus was concentrated
from culture supernatant by high speed centrifugation. The viral
preparation used in this study had a titer of 106 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/ml.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation. PBMC were
obtained from healthy donors after centrifugation of heparinized
venous blood over Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, Montreal, Canada)
gradients and cultured in complete medium. Various cell populations
were depleted from PBMC by first incubating the cells with either
anti-CD3, -CD4, -CD8, -CD21 (Ortho Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ),
anti-CD14 (Immunotech Inc., MA) or anti-CD16 (Becton Dickinson,
CA) for 30 min at room temperature followed by addition of low toxicity baby rabbit complement (C’) (Gibco Life Technologies, Mississauga, Canada) for 1 h at 378C. Cells were washed and effectiveness
of depletion assessed by flow cytometry (for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD21),
cytomorphology (CD14) and cytotoxic activity (CD16). Consistently,
, 2% contaminating CD31, CD41, and CD81 and less than 1%
CD211 and monocytes were present in selectively depleted cultures.
NK activity of CD16-depleted cultures was , 2% when tested in
standard 51Cr-release assay using K562 target cells. In some experiments, monocytes were isolated by elutriation. These monocyte preparations were . 90% pure as determined by CD14 marker reactivity.
NK cell cytotoxicity assay. NK cell activity was determined by
standard 51Cr-release assay (20). Briefly, K562 target cells (106) were
labeled with 100 mCi of sodium chromate (DuPont, Canada) for 60
min at 378C. After four washes, the target cells (104) were mixed with
effector PBMC at a 1:20 ratio in V-bottomed wells and incubated for
16 h at 378C in a CO2 incubator. Plates were centrifuged and the radioactivity of supernatant (0.1 ml) was measured using a gamma
counter (LKB, Sweden). Data are expressed as percent specific release after calculation using the following formula:
In some experiments, NK cytotoxicity against the NK cell activity resistant CEM NKr cell line was also determined as described above.
Other antibodies and cytokines. Neutralizing mAbs to human IL-2,
IL-12, interferon-a (IFN-a), tumor necrosis factor a and b were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Neutralizing mAb to
IFN-g was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA) and to CD122
from Becton-Dickinson. mAb to IL-15 and recombinant simian IL-15
were a gift from Immunex (Seattle, WA).
Cell Treatment. One million PBMC or PBMC depleted of various cell subpopulations were either treated (in duplicate) with mockinfected culture supernatant or infected with HHV-6 for 2 h at 378C
after which cells were washed with Hank’s buffer to remove unadsorbed virus and resuspended in 1 ml of complete medium. After 20 h
at 378C, cells were adjusted to 4 3 106
/ml and 0.05 ml of this suspension (in triplicate) were added to 104 51Cr-labeled K562 cells and NK
activity was determined as described above. In some experiments,
cell-free supernatant from mock- and HHV-6–treated PBMC were
collected at various time points and added (at 25% final volume) to
untreated PBMC before mixing with K562 cells.
NK activity of PBMC was also tested in presence of rIL-15 (50 ng/
ml), anti–IL-15 (10 mg/ml) and anti-CD122 (10 mg/ml).
Virus neutralization and inactivation. HHV-6 was inactivated by
heat (568C, 1 h) or by ultra-violet (UV) light irradiation (2 3 106 mJ).
Effectiveness of inactivation treatments was determined by testing infectivity of viral preparations by immunofluorescence assays (IFA)
on HSB-2 cells using mAb specific for HHV-6 gp110 (ABI, Columbia, MD). Consistently, , 1% of cells were found positive for HHV-6
gp110 4 d after treatment with inactivated preparations while 40% of
cells were positive for gp110 after treatment with infectious virus. As
a specificity control, HHV-6 preparation neutralized with a reference
serum was used (12, 16). The HHV-6 antibody-positive serum used
was from a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia from whom the
GS isolate was obtained. GS serum had a IgG titer (to HHV-6) of
(cpm experimental cpm spontaneous) –
cpm maximum cpm spontaneous –
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- × 100
320, as measured by IFA and neutralized 1000 TCID50 of HHV-6 at
a 1:20 dilution. This serum (with gold labeling) binds to the surface of
HHV-6 (not shown). In control experiments, we found that this serum sample adsorbed with Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus lost its neutralizing activity to these viruses but still retained activity against HHV-6.
Immunofluorescence and DNA slot blot. The effects of rIL-15 on
HHV-6 expression was determined by IFA and DNA slot blot techniques. PBMC were depleted of CD81 or CD561 or both cell populations using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD8 or CD56 mAb
and then stimulated with PHA (1 mg/ml) and IL-2 (5 U/ml) for 2 d.
Cells were infected with HHV-6 for 2 h, then washed with PBS and
resuspended in complete medium containing IL-2 (5 U/ml) with or
without rIL-15 (10, 50, 100 ng/ml) or anti–IL-15 antibodies (10 mg/
ml). On day 7 after infection, the cells were harvested, washed with
PBS and processed for IFA. Live cells were stained with anti–HHV-6
2D6 mAb (ABI, Columbia, MD) followed by fluoresceinated goat
anti–mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO).
Five thousand cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Facscan, Becton Dickinson, CA). On day 7 after infection, genomic DNA was extracted using the Easy DNA kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and
processed for slot blot hybridization. 0.5 mg, 0.1 mg, and 0.02 mg of
DNA from each sample were denatured with NaOH (0.1 N) and applied to nylon membranes. Membranes were probed with the HHV-6
HinDIII fragment ZVH14 and detection was carried out by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (Amersham,
Arlington Heights, IL).
Immunodetection of IL-15 production by monocytes. Elutriated monocytes (91% CD141) were either treated with mock-infected fluid or
with HHV-6 for 1 h, washed with PBS and resuspended in complete
medium (20 million/ml) for varying time periods (i.e., from 2 to 18 h)
and then supernatants were collected and stored frozen until used.
200 ul of undiluted, 1/2 and 1/4 diluted samples were applied to nitrocellulose membrane using a dot blot apparatus (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry
milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for one hour,
washed with TBS-T and incubated overnight at 48C with anti–IL-15
mAb (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) (5 mg/ml). Detection was made by
chemiluminescence (Amersham) using a peroxydase-labeled goat
anti–mouse serum. The relative IL-15 protein level was determined
by laser densitometry.
IL-15 mRNA analyses by RT-PCR. PBMC, elutriated monocytes,
and positively selected cell populations were treated either with mock
fluid or HHV-6 for varying time periods and then total RNA was extracted, treated with DNase and subjected to RT-PCR as previously
described (12). Ten percent of the PCR reaction was electrophoresed
on a 2% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized
with specific 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide probes complementary
to an internal region of the amplicons. The following oligonucleotides
were used in PCR reactions: IL-15A (59-ATGAGAATTTCGAAACCACATTTG-39), IL-15B (59-CCATTAGAAGACAAACTGTTCTTTGC-39), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
or actin (see Refs. 12, 25). The following hybridization probe was
used for IL-15: IL-15P (59-ATGTCTTCATTTTGGGCTGTTTCAGTGCAG-39). After hybridization and washes, membranes were exposed to films. The housekeeping genes GAPDH and actin were used
as RNA controls to evaluate the amount of RNA used for amplification. The concentration of RNA among the various samples was corrected by calculating the optical density values of the actin and
GAPDH bands. To calculate the fold increase in IL-15 RNA transcripts, the ratio (IL-15/housekeeping gene) obtained from HHV-6-
stimulated cells was compared to the ratio (IL-15/housekeeping
gene) for mock-treated cells, as previously described (12, 25).
Results
HHV-6 increases cytotoxic activity of CD161 cells. Patients’ NK
activity during the acute febrile phase of HHV-6 infection has

Herpesvirus-6 Enhances NK Activity via IL-15 1375
been shown to be increased when compared to that of NK activity of patients in convalescence (20). In an effort to better
understand this phenomenon, we studied NK activity of
PBMC from healthy individuals after in vitro infection by
HHV-6. PBMC (106
) from 10 individuals were infected with
the GS strain of HHV-6 (105 TCID50) and 20 h P.I. cytotoxic
activity was determined using a standard 51Cr-release assay on
K562 target cells. Among the PBMC donors, individuals with
known low NK activity were also included. As shown in Fig. 1
A, an increase in cytotoxic activity was observed in all HHV-6-
infected PBMC samples when compared to the cytotoxic activity
of mock-infected cells. The mean difference in cytolytic activity between infected and uninfected cells was highly significant
(P , 0.001, by Student t test). Although variations in cytotoxic
activity between PBMC from different donors was observed as
expected, all showed greater killing efficiency following infection with HHV-6, regardless of their HHV-6 antibody (i.e., seropositive or seronegative) status. Furthermore, the increase
in cytotoxicity was correlated with the HHV-6 dose used. As
shown in Fig. 1 B, at the lowest dose of HHV-6 used (i.e.,
0.0025 TCID50), no significant increase was observed while
higher dose of virus caused significant enhancement of target
cell lysis. Similar experiments conducted with HHV-6 strain
Z29 (B type) gave identical results (not shown). To determine
if this increase in cytotoxic activity is associated with a NK
phenotype, we selectively depleted CD161 cells from PBMC
and tested the effect of HHV-6 on the cytolytic activity of the
residual cell population. As shown in Fig. 2, infection by HHV6 of unfractionated PBMC from 3 donors caused a significant
increase (P , 0.01) in killing. These cells were treated with
rabbit complement in order to provide appropriate controls.
However, when CD161 cells were depleted from PBMC, a
significant decrease (P , 0.01) in spontaneous NK activity was
observed. Moreover, HHV-6 infection of CD16-depleted
PBMC did not result in increased cytotoxicity above that of
mock-infected PBMC, suggesting that CD161 cells are directly associated with the increased killing of K562 cells observed following infection by HHV-6. Addition of HHV-6 directly to K562 cells in the absence of effector cells did not
provoke lysis of target cells ruling out the possibility of direct
cytotoxicity by HHV-6 (data not shown).
Detection of NK stimulatory factor in supernatants of HHV6–infected PBMC cultures. Increased NK activity associated
with infection of PBMC could be due to direct activation of
NK cells by HHV-6 or via the induction and release of NK
stimulatory factor(s). To test these hypotheses, PBMC from
two donors were infected with HHV-6 and supernatants were
collected at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 h post-infection (PI). PBMC
were washed extensively after virus adsorption in order to prevent supernatant contamination by residual viral particles. Supernatants collected at various times after infection were
added (25% final volume) to resting PBMC of the corresponding individual donor and analyzed for their ability to stimulate
NK activity. As shown in Fig. 3, a significant (P , 0.05) increase in NK activity was observed after addition of supernatant (5 h) from donor 1, when compared to that of supernatant
at time 0, which represents the baseline value. Supernatants
collected 10 h post-infection were capable of stimulating NK
cells of both donors efficiently (P , 0.02). Longer incubation
post-infection did not significantly increase NK activity above
that at 10 h after infection. Since it is known that productive infection of resting PBMC by HHV-6 is not an efficient process
(26), it is very unlikely that the presence of viral particles in supernatant was responsible for the NK stimulation observed.
Moreover, addition of supernatant from HHV-6–treated PBMC
to K562 cells, in the absence of effector cells, did not cause any

cell line at a 20:1 effector to target ratio. Data, expressed as percent

significant lysis, thus excluding the possibility of direct cytotoxicity by soluble factors.
Having determined that HHV-6 induced a NK stimulatory
factor within 10 h of infection, we became interested in identifying which cell population(s) is(are) responsible for the production of such factor. Supernatant from HHV-6–infected
(20 h P.I.) PBMC (of four donors), which were depleted of selected cell populations such as CD31, CD41, CD81, CD141,
CD211, and CD161 cells were therefore tested for their ability to stimulate NK activity. Results from these experiments
suggested that NK stimulatory factor production cannot be ascribed to a sole cell subset (data not shown) and is presumably
the result of the response of different cell types to viral infection.
Infectivity of HHV-6 is not required for NK cell stimulation. After the above evidence that NK cell stimulation by
HHV-6 is a result of a cell secreted factor, as a next step we
tested if viral infectivity was necessary for induction of this factor. The results summarized in Table I indicate that UV- or
heat-inactivated HHV-6 is still able to stimulate NK activity as
efficiently as the infectious virus. However, neutralization of
HHV-6 by human antibodies abolished the ability of HHV-6
to stimulate NK activity. These results suggest that thermostable protein(s), recognized by the neutralizing antibodies,
is(are) involved in the triggering of the NK stimulating-factor.
In light of the above observations on the NK activityenhancing effect of HHV-6 we were also interested in knowing
whether this virus can modulate NK cytotoxicity against a NK
activity resistant cell line such as CEM-NKr. Results presented
in Table I (bottom panel) indicate that no increase in killing
against the CEM target was observed following infection of
PBMC by HHV-6.
IL-15 is responsible for NK cell activation by HHV-6. It has
recently been reported that human PBMC, upon stimulation
with IL-15, become capable of efficiently lysing different target cells (21). However, the effect of IL-15 on NK activity
against the NK sensitive K562 cell line has not been reported.
Addition of recombinant simian IL-15 to PBMC cultures
greatly enhanced the lytic power of NK cells towards K562 target cells (Fig. 4). However, pre-incubation of IL-15 with neutralizing mAb to IL-15 eliminated this cytotoxicity-enhancing
activity of the IL-15 (not shown). Interestingly, the addition of
anti IL-15 to PBMC cultures resulted in loss of NK activity
while anti IFN-g had no effect (data not shown).
Knowing that HHV-6 induced a soluble factor capable of

Herpesvirus-6 Enhances NK Activity via IL-15 1377
stimulating NK activity, our efforts were deployed in identifying such factor. We therefore incubated HHV-6–infected
PBMC in presence of neutralizing antibodies to cytokines, i.e.,
IL-2, IFN-a, IFN-g, TNF-a, TNF-b, and IL-12 known to activate NK cells. There were no significant differences in cytotoxic killing of target cells by HHV-6–infected PBMC treated
or not with these cytokine-neutralizing antibodies (data not
shown). However, when anti–IL-15 antibodies were added to
HHV-6 infected PBMC cultures, a striking reduction in NK
activity was observed. As shown in Fig. 4, both HHV-6 and
rIL-15 (50 ng/ml) increased cytotoxic activity of PBMC. Addition of antibodies to IL-15 at the time of infection considerably
reduced the lysis of target cells to levels below those of untreated PBMC, presumably as a consequence of the neutralization by these antibodies of the spontaneously produced IL15. On the other hand, addition of neutralizing antibodies to
IFN-g at the time of infection did not significantly affect the
ability of HHV-6 to stimulate NK cells.
It has been reported that IL-15 interacts with the b chain
(CD122) of the IL-2 receptor and that blocking of CD122 with
antibodies abolishes the ability of IL-15 to stimulate cytotoxic
activity (21, 23). As an additional test of the hypothesis that
HHV-6 mediates NK cell activation through an IL-15–dependent pathway, we examined the effect of anti-CD122 antibodies on such activation. First, as shown in Fig. 5, no increase in
cytotoxicity was observed when HHV-6–infected PBMC were
incubated in the presence of anti-CD122, confirming the notion that IL-15 is indeed the cytokine involved in NK cell activation associated with HHV-6 infection. Second, we confirmed that incubation of cells with anti-CD122 blocks the
effect of IL-15 on NK cell activation.
HHV-6 induces IL-15 mRNA, and IL-15 protein synthesis
in purified monocytes. All evidence gathered so far suggested
that IL-15 was the cytokine responsible for the enhanced NK
activity observed after HHV-6 treatment. Since adherent cells
obtained from PBMC were found to express high level of IL15 messages (21), we used purified monocyte preparations to
test whether HHV-6 can actually modulate IL-15 gene expression. Elutriated monocytes were treated with HHV-6 for varying time periods after which IL-15 and actin mRNA levels
were determined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6 (top and
middle figures), both mock-treated PBMC and monocytes
constitutively expressed IL-15 messages. Upon HHV-6 stimulation, induction of IL-15 mRNA was observed as early as 2 h
P.I. reaching maximal activation at 10 h P.I. with a threefold
increase in IL-15 mRNA as compared to mock-treated cells. In
addition, we tested whether IL-15 transcripts could be detected in cell types other than monocytes. PBMC were treated
with HHV-6 for 8 h and then, with the use of antibody-coated
magnetic beads, CD21, CD191, CD141, and CD561 cells
were positively selected, lysed and processed for RT-PCR as
described above. IL-15 transcripts were only detected in unfractionated PBMC, and in CD141 and CD561 cell fractions
(Fig. 6, bottom) while no IL-15 signal was observed in T
(CD21) and B cell (CD191) fractions (not shown).
Supernatants from mock-and HHV-6–treated monocytes
were also tested for immunoreactive IL-15 as described in
Methods. As shown in Fig. 7, a slight induction of IL-15 was
observed three hours post HHV-6 treatment. By 6 h, a 2.5-fold
increase was found and by 9 and 19 h P.I. a 3.6-fold increase in
IL-15 protein level was observed in HHV-6 treated monocytes
as compared to sham-treated control group.
NK and CD81 T cell–mediated control of HHV-6 infection. Killing of HHV-6 infected targets by NK cells has been
observed previously (19). To evaluate the potential antiviral
role of NK cells and their activation by IL-15, we first determined the ability of HHV-6 to infect CD8- and CD56-depleted
PBMC cultures. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the level of HHV-6 expression was slightly increased in NK-depleted cells compared

with the most dramatic effect observed in NK-depleted cultures (Fig. 8 A, middle panels). The addition of recombinant
IL-15 (10 ng/ml) to CD8- or CD56-depleted cultures was
found to severely inhibit HHV-6 infection (Fig. 8 A, right panels) suggesting that the control of HHV-6 infection is not solely
dependent on one phenotypic cell population. To learn more
on this aspect, we then tested the effect of IL-15 on HHV-6 infection of cultures depleted of both CD81 and CD561 cells.
In these doubly depleted cultures, a previously effective dose
of IL-15 (10 ng/ml) was found to have minimal effect on HHV-6
infection, suggesting that at least one of the cell types, i.e., either CD81 or CD561 cells, must be present for IL-15 to be effective in the control of HHV-6 infection. At the highest dose
of IL-15 used (i.e., 100 ng/ml), a reduction in HHV-6 infection
was observed, likely as a result of residual CD81 T or NK cell
in the culture.
Discussion
In general, viral infections trigger a cascade of events in the
host, leading to immune cell activation which eventually reFigure 6. HHV-6 augments IL-15 transcription in monocytes. Elutriated monocytes were treated either with mock infected culture fluid

sults in the control of the invading pathogens. The nonspecific
arm of the immune response, represented by macrophages,
NK cells, granulocytes and cytokines is thought to play an important role in limiting the early progression of infection by viruses. Mechanisms such as inhibition of virus multiplication by
IFNs and lysis of infected cells by NK cells enable specific B
and T lymphocytes to mount an effective response which eventually leads to viral clearance. Although most viral infections
are cleared this way, some viruses have elaborated sophisticated strategies to evade immune attack by limiting viral gene
expression in infected cells. Perhaps the best examples of immune evasion by viruses are those observed with Herpesviruses. These viruses are never eliminated from the host despite
a strong immune response developed following primary infection. Whether it is by residing in privileged areas such as sensory neurons (e.g., HSV-1 and VZV) or through modulation of
cell surface molecules (e.g., CMV and EBV), these herpesviruses persist throughout the host’s life. Viral reactivation from
latently-infected cells can lead to serious secondary pathogenic
events especially in immunocompromised patients such as organ graft recipients, patients under anti-cancer chemotherapy,
and HIV-seropositive individuals.
One herpesvirus gaining increasing medical importance is
HHV-6. HHV-6’s marked tropism for cells of the immune system has made this virus the source of numerous speculations
with regard to its contribution to various immunodeficiencyrelated diseases. A previous report by Lusso et al. (18) described the infection and destruction of human NK cells by

complete medium supplemented with IL-2 (5 U/ml). 
Selected cultures were further conditioned with anti–

ml). (A) On day 7 P.I., cells 
were processed for IFA as

HHV-6. Although these authors observed rapid internalization of HHV-6 particles (i.e., within 1 h PI), productive infection of NK cells could only be observed if NK cells were cultured for several weeks before infection. The direct impact of
HHV-6 infection could not be studied since no residual NK activity was observed after prolonged in vitro culture of NK cells.
Our objective was to learn more about HHV-6-NK cell interactions by studying the cytotoxic activity of such cells after an
encounter with HHV-6. Our results clearly show that HHV-6
increases the cytotoxic activity of NK cells early after exposure
to virus. Our data also show that enhancement of NK cell cytotoxicity by HHV-6 is restricted to NK-sensitive cell lines such
as K562 and is not observed against naturally resistant cells
such as the CEM-NKr cell line. These results suggest that
HHV-6 increases the cytotoxic potential of NK cells in such a
way that NK sensitive target cells are more readily recognized
and killed. The mechanism by which HHV-6 stimulates NK
cell activity was defined after the observation that conditioned
media from HHV-6–infected PBMC could also stimulate NK
cells. The secretion of a soluble factor, in response to viral infection, was responsible for the observed effect. The fact that
both UV- and heat-inactivated HHV-6 preparations could also
stimulate NK cells as efficiently as the infectious virus, suggested that a thermostable HHV-6 protein, after interaction
with cells, triggers the secretion of immunomodulatory factor(s) capable of stimulating NK cells. It is conceivable that the
binding of viral and cellular ligands was responsible for this effect. After numerous attempts to identify the NK activating
factor(s) we succeeded in linking IL-15 to this phenomenon.
Other cytokines such as IL-2, TNF-a, TNF-b, IFN-a, IFN-g,
and IL-12 were not found to be involved in NK cell activation
in this system. IL-15 is a newly described cytokine that possesses biological properties similar to those of IL-2 such as induction of LAK, T cell growth promotion and induction of
CTL activity (21–23). Furthermore, it was shown that IL-15
binds to CD122 (p75 or b chain) and that blocking of CD122
with mAb results in the inhibition of IL-15 biological activities.
In our system, in the presence of mAb to CD122, HHV-6 did
not stimulate NK activity, corroborating the observation that
IL-15 needs to interact with CD122 to transmit its stimulatory
signal to the NK cell (21, 23).
It is known that NK cells play an important role in immunosurveillance through killing of virus-infected and tumor cells.
The results presented here, using HHV-6, have enabled us to
better understand the network of interactions involved in sustaining and increasing NK cell activity in response to a threat
such as a viral infection. Through IL-15 secretion, NK cells acquire increased killing potential, which is effective in eliminating infected cells thereby limiting viral growth and spread. Secretion of spontaneous IL-15 also contributes to maintain NK
cell killing potential in vitro. Addition of antibodies to IL-15
considerably reduced the spontaneous NK activity which was
correlated with an increase in HHV-6 expression. The combination of NK cell-depleted cultures together with neutralizing
antibodies to IL-15 lead to the highest levels of HHV-6 expression suggesting that the cytotoxic potential and the antiviral
activity of the cells involved is at least partly dependent on this
cytokine. The addition of exogenous recombinant IL-15 was
found to greatly influence the ability of HHV-6 to grow in
PBMC, CD8- or CD56-depleted cultures. In fact, cultures
treated with IL-15 were not found to support viral growth.
However, the removal of both CD81 and CD561 cells impaired the anti-viral effectiveness of IL-15 suggesting an indirect mode of action, through cytotoxic cell activation and increased killing of infected cells. A similar, but IL-2–mediated
mechanism involving effectors with a CD81/CD161 phenotype has been reported in the control of Epstein-Barr virusinfected/transformed cells in vitro (27).
Finally, the present data raise the question of whether
other viruses are also capable of modulating NK cell activity in
such a fashion (i.e., via IL-15 induction). We are currently investigating this issue.
In conclusion, the results presented here are the first to
show that (a) HHV-6 enhances NK cell activity and that (b)
this enhancement occurs via IL-15. Our results may also explain the in vivo observations of Takahashi et al. (20) who
have reported higher NK activity in patients with acute HHV-6
infection. Our data also suggest that, although HHV-6 can interact with NK cells, these cells are still functional during the
first days post-infection and, moreover, they are highly cytolytic as a consequence of IL-15 release by PBMC in response
to HHV-6 infection. Secretion of IL-15 following viral infection may therefore represent a powerful host defense mechanism involved in restricting viral growth and in limiting the
spread of the infectious agent.
