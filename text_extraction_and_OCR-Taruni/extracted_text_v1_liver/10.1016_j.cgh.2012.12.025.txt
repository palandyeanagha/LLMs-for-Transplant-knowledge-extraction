Abstract
BACKGROUND & AIMS—Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α antagonists have been associated
with drug-induced liver injury (DILI). We reviewed cases of DILI in the United States to identify
those associated with use of TNF-α antagonists.
METHODS—We searched the U.S. DILI Network (DILIN) database, from 2003 to 2011, for
cases associated with TNF-α antagonists. Mean Roussel-Uclaf Causality Assessment Method
scores were calculated. A DILIN severity score was assigned according to a previously published
scale, and we identified 6 subjects likely to have DILI associated with use of TNF-α antagonists.
We also searched PubMed for articles that reported hepatotoxicity from TNF-α antagonists,
identifying 28 additional cases suitable for analysis.
RESULTS—The drugs presumed to have caused DILI were infliximab (n = 26), etanercept (n =
4), and adalimumab (n = 4). The anti–TNF-α agent was the probable cause of 12 cases of DILI
(35%), a very likely cause for 21 (62%), and a definite cause for 1 (3%). Median latency was 13
weeks (range, 2–104); however, 7 cases (20%) had latency periods longer than 24 weeks. Twentytwo of 33 subjects who underwent serologic analysis (67%) tested positive for anti-nuclear and/or
smooth muscle antibodies. Of these 22, 17 underwent liver biopsy; 15 subjects had clear features
of autoimmunity. The 22 subjects with autoimmune features had longer median latency (16 vs 10
weeks) and higher peak levels of alanine aminotransferase (784 vs 528 U/L) than the 12 without
such features. There was 1 case of severe cholestasis. All but one subject improved after
discontinuation of the implicated drug; 12 subjects received corticosteroid therapy. No deaths

were attributed to liver injury, although one patient with preexistent cirrhosis required liver
transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS—Acute liver injury caused by TNF-α antagonists may be a class effect because
multiple agents in this category have been implicated. The most common presentation is an
autoimmune phenotype with marked hepatocellular injury, but a mixed non-autoimmune pattern
or predominant cholestasis also occurs. The prognosis is usually good after drug discontinuation,
although some patients may benefit from a course of corticosteroids. ClinicalTrials.gov: Number,

Biological response modifiers are prescribed to modify the body’s response to inflammation,
infection, and neoplasia. These compounds include interferons, interleukins, bone marrow
colony-stimulating factors, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–α antagonists. All of the TNFα antagonists have been associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI).1,2 In addition,
these agents carry specific warnings about the risk of reactivation of chronic hepatitis B.3
A Food and Drug Administration postmarketing surveillance program received more than
130 reports of liver injury resulting from either infliximab or etanercept treatment.4 The
results were reported in Food and Drug Administration minutes, and although in many of
these cases competing causes were identified, including viral reactivation, 7 of the reported
cases were notable for their strong association with the TNF-α antagonist in question.4
Two cases of successful treatment with etanercept after a prior DILI episode attributed to
infliximab have recently been reported, suggesting that cross-toxicity is not universal among
the different TNF-α antagonists.5,6 However, it has been shown that several TNF-α
antagonists have a similar ability to elicit the development of serologic markers of
autoimmunity. These compounds have also been associated with reactivation of latent
tuberculosis, hepatitis B, the development of lymphoma, demyelinating disease, seizures,
aplastic anemia, and skin rash.3 Accordingly, some reported cases of TNF-α antagonist–
induced liver injury exhibited autoimmune features on liver histology.6 This suggests the
possibility that genetically susceptible individuals may generate an idiosyncratic immune
response after inhibition of the TNF-α pathway.1
In this report, we describe cases that are deemed to be ≥50% likely to represent bona fide
TNF-α antagonist–associated hepatotoxicity. Six were enrolled in the ongoing U.S. DrugInduced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) Prospective Registry Study.7
 We also performed a
detailed literature search and critically reviewed 34 additional published cases. Of those, 28
met criteria for inclusion. Herein we summarize the clinical and laboratory presentation as
well as clinical outcome of these 34 subjects.
Methods
We searched the U.S. DILIN database (between 2003 and 2011) for instances of DILI
associated with TNF-α antagonists that were scored probable (score 3) or higher likelihood
on the following scale developed by the DILIN group: 1 = definite (>95% likelihood), 2 =
highly likely (76%–95%), 3 = probable (51%–75%), 4 = possible (25%–50%), and 5 =
unlikely (<25%).7 This means that we did not include cases of elevated liver test results
associated with a TNF-alpha antagonist, which by consensus evaluation were found to be
only possible or unlikely (ie, ≤50% likelihood of DILI). The Roussel-Uclaf Causality

Assessment Method (RUCAM)8
 score was calculated according to published guidelines, and
the mean score (from 3 reviewers) was calculated. Causality assessment by RUCAM scores
is as follows: 0 or lower, relationship with the drug excluded; 1–2, unlikely; 3–5, possible;
6–8, probable; and >8, highly probable. A DILIN severity score was assigned according to a
previously published scale from 1 (mild with bilirubin <2.5 mg%) to 5 (death or liver
transplantation).7 Six subjects with a causality score of 1, 2, or 3 were identified, and
demographics and descriptive statistics for them were summarized by the Duke Clinical
Research Institute, the data coordinating center of the DILIN.
The authors had access to the study data and have reviewed and approved the final
manuscript.
Search and Review of Literature
A detailed literature review was performed by using the PubMed database in April 2011 by
using the search terms “hepatotoxicity,” “liver injury,” “tumor necrosis factor,” and the
generic names of all commercially available TNF-α antagonists. All cases that were
published as of December 2011 were reviewed by 2 of the authors by using a causality
assessment method similar to that used in the DILIN Causality Committee meetings.
However, instead of 1 principal investigator and 2 reviewers (not involved in the care of the
subject), we used 2 DILIN reviewers (M.G., M.B.) who discussed the published cases, with
assistance of a third reviewer (H.L.B.) in case of lack of consensus. However, the 2
reviewers came to a consensus in all literature cases and assigned each published case both a
causality and a severity score in a fashion similar to and according to the DILIN protocol.1,2
Only those cases that were deemed at least a probable (score 3 or lower) on the DILIN
causality scale were included in this report. Six published cases were excluded from the
analysis because they were scored as only possible; thus, 28 cases are included in this
report.9–13
Autoimmunity was defined by the presence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) or smooth
muscle antibody in a titer ≥1/80 (at the time of DILI onset) or, if available, liver histology
consistent with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Liver biopsies obtained from the subjects in the
DILIN registry were all interpreted by D.E.K. without knowledge of clinical or laboratory
features.
Results
Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network Subjects
Selected demographic, clinical, and serum biochemical features of the 6 DILIN subjects
with hepatotoxicity attributed to TNF-α antagonists are shown in Table 1. The median
latency (duration of drug use before onset) was 16 weeks (range, 2–52 weeks). At
presentation, half had jaundice, half had nausea, but only one had fever, and none had
immunoallergic features of skin rash or eosinophilia. The hepatic injury pattern was
predominantly hepatocellular; 4 patients developed jaundice, but only 1 had significantly
impaired coagulation (international normalized ratio [INR], 3.5), and none developed ascites
or other signs of hepatic failure. Five of the 6 patients were treated with corticosteroids. One
patient had a protracted illness, but all ultimately recovered and could be withdrawn from
corticosteroid therapy without recurrence. Clinical summary of a representative DILIN case
is reported below, and those of the remaining cases are included in the Supplementary
Materials.

Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network case report
Subject 1—A 28-year-old man with quiescent Crohn’s disease was started on infliximab
(300 mg [5 mg/kg] intravenously monthly) for ankylosing spondylitis refractory to
celecoxib. Four months before starting infliximab, serum enzymes were normal.
Concomitant medications included fluoxetine, fluticasone, and omeprazole, and he reported
no known drug allergies. After the fourth infusion, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels
increased to 132 U/L, and total bilirubin was 0.8 mg/dL. In the week of his fifth infusion,
ALT increased to 311 U/L, whereas alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos) and bilirubin remained
normal. Infliximab was stopped. He remained asymptomatic throughout, but ALT peaked at
1270 U/L. Serum ANA was initially negative, but 1 month later, it was positive in a titer of
1:160. Anti–smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) remained negative, and immunoglobulin (Ig)
G levels were normal. Serum ALT fell to 198 U/L by 2 months after the last infusion but
rose again to 1167 U/L, with a total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL (Figure 1 A1). Evaluation for
hepatitis A, B, and C was negative, and hepatic computed tomography and ultrasound were
normal. A liver biopsy obtained 3 months after the last infliximab infusion showed portal
and lobular mixed inflammatory infiltrate with autoimmune features and no fibrosis (Figure
1 A2 and A3). Prednisone (50 mg/d) was started, and liver enzymes fell into the normal
range within 2 months. Prednisone was tapered and stopped after 7 months. The serum ANA
reverted to negative. He was placed on etanercept 11 months after his last dose of
infliximab, and serum enzymes remained normal. The assigned DILIN causality score was 1
(definite), RUCAM 5 (possible), and severity score 1 (mild).
Comment—This subject developed progressively elevated serum aminotransferase levels
after 5 doses of infliximab, but he remained asymptomatic and had only a mild increase in
serum bilirubin. He was taking fluoxetine, fluticasone, and omeprazole at the time of onset,
but these agents had been taken for more than a year and were continued. No other cause of
liver disease was identified. Liver biopsy findings, ANA positivity, and response to
prednisone suggested DILI with auto-immune features triggered by infliximab.
Literature Review
Twenty-eight additional published cases were evaluated, and the results are summarized
together with the 6 DILIN cases in Tables 2 and 3. The most common underlying disease
was psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis (13 cases, 8 women), followed by inflammatory
bowel disease (12 cases, 7 women), rheumatoid arthritis (6 cases, all women), and
ankylosing spondylitis (3 cases, 1 woman). The drug most commonly incriminated was
infliximab (26 cases), followed by etanercept and adalimumab (4 each). No published cases
were found linked to natalizumab, golimumab, or certolizumab. On the basis of the reports
and causality assessment by 2 of the authors (M.G. and M.B.), 1 case was considered
definite, 21 were considered very likely (causality score 2), and 12 cases were deemed
probable (causality score 3). An alcohol use history was available in 21 cases. Alcohol was
considered a possible competing cause in 3 cases, but the final causality assessment for the
anti-TNF compound was very likely in 1 case and probable in the other 2.
Severity scores could be ascertained in 30 cases, and the reaction was rated as mild in 20,
moderate in 8, and severe (including 1 liver transplant) in 2. Peak serum ALT ranged from
140–2250 U/L, and bilirubin ranged from normal–27.7 mg/dL. The presence or absence of
autoimmune serologies or histologic features was reported in 33 cases; 22 (66%) had
autoimmune serologic markers and/or histologic features at some point during the clinical
course. Overall, the prognosis was good, although 1 patient with underlying cirrhosis
required liver transplantation.14 Twelve subjects improved after discontinuation of the
implicated drug and with the addition or increased dosage of oral or parenteral corticosteroid
therapy. The remainder improved after discontinuation of the implicated drug. Several

patients tolerated treatment with etanercept without recurrence of liver injury after cessation
of infliximab or adalimumab.5,6,9,15,16 Two did well with low-dose etanercept after DILI
associated with full dose.11,12
We compared 22 cases with autoimmune features (serology and/or histology) vs those
without (Table 4). Those with auto-immune features had serum ANA titers ranging from
1:80 to 1:2560, and 17 subjects underwent liver biopsy that revealed autoimmune
histopathologic features in 15. In contrast, among the 8 (of 12) patients without positive
autoimmune serologies who underwent liver biopsy, none had clear-cut autoimmune
features. Patients with autoimmune features tended to have longer latency and were more
likely to have a hepatocellular pattern of serum enzyme elevations, with higher peak ALT
and higher R values (Table 4).
Discussion
Increased levels of TNF-α have been described in numerous inflammatory and infectious
conditions, including liver diseases, eg, alcoholic hepatitis. As a result, anti–TNF-α
antibodies or other antagonists have been proposed as therapies for such liver diseases,
because uncontrolled pilot studies have suggested beneficial effects.17,18 However,
randomized, controlled trials have indicated that persons with alcoholic hepatitis treated
with infliximab fared worse than untreated controls.17,18 Because TNF-α has beneficial as
well as deleterious effects, down-regulation of its levels or activity needs to be carefully
considered. In some patients treated with TNF-α blockers, acute liver injury has developed
that may be severe and prolonged.2 Of the TNF-α antagonists, infliximab-associated injury
has been the best documented, most likely because of its earlier approval and more
widespread clinical use. As of 2011, more than 1,500,000 persons had been exposed to
infliximab alone.1,2 Fewer bona fide etanercept-induced hepatotoxicity case reports have
been published. In fact, this drug has been successfully used after resolution of DILI caused
by other TNF-α inhibitors5,6,9,15,16 (and DILIN subject 8). In all, a switch to an alternative
TNF-α antagonist because of predominantly infliximab-associated DILI did not result in
recurrent liver injury in 5 published cases.5,6,15,19,20
A recent review of a national database reported that the risk of elevation of liver enzymes in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were on TNF-α antagonists was low (ALT or
aspartate aminotransferase [AST] elevation >3× upper limit of normal <1%) and that
etanercept was less likely to be associated with liver enzyme elevation as compared with
infliximab or adalimumab.21 The fact that so few cases have been attributed to etanercept in
psoriatic disease may be due to its more recent approval in 2004 and the smaller number of
patients treated. Certolizumab (Cimzia) and golimumab (Symponi) are the newest drugs in
the class. To our knowledge, DILI attributed to these 2 agents has not yet been reported,
although both package inserts mention the risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation as well as
idiosyncratic elevation of ALT, which are greater than in placebo. A systematic review of
the use on anti-TNF agents in patients with chronic hepatitis C confirms the general
impression that these agents are safe in the majority of patients, including those with
underlying liver disease.22 An exception is that these agents can cause reactivation of
hepatitis B.3,22
Infliximab, etanercept, and adalimumab inhibit TNF-α signaling by directly binding soluble
and membrane-bound TNF-α, and all contain, at least in part, a human IgG antibody
component. Nevertheless, they differ in their molecular structures. Infliximab is a chimeric
IgG1 monoclonal antibody, whereas etanercept is a fusion of recombinant soluble TNF-α
receptor type 2 with an Fc domain of human IgG1, and adalimubab is a fully humanized
IgG1 monoclonal antibody. In view of these differences, it is not surprising that in a few

cases, a lack of cross-toxicity between etanercept and infliximab has been noted.16,23 Each
of these subjects had developed liver toxicity while using infliximab, recovered after
cessation of infliximab, and did not exhibit any relapse in liver injury when later treated with
etanercept. A similar case report has also recently been published that demonstrated
successful treatment of psoriatic arthritis with etanercept after adalimumab hepatotoxicity.15
In addition, infliximab and etanercept have also been observed to elicit different effects on
the humoral autoimmune response.24 The frequent development of autoantibodies within 1
year of treatment has been reported in infliximab-treated patients, whereas in etanercepttreated patients, no significant variation of ANA or anti-DNA level was observed.25 In
contrast, all 4 etanercept cases in this report (2 from DILIN) developed serologic
autoimmune markers, with ANA titers as high as 1:1280 and weakly positive serum
antimitochondrial antibody in 1 case (Tables 2 and 3).
We used a causality assessment method similar to that used in the DILIN causality
committee meetings, with 2 reviewers (M.G., M.B.) who discussed the published cases and
came to a consensus. According to this process, 22 of 34 subjects (65%) were deemed
definite or very likely and 12 (35%) probable.
Clinically, the most common presentation of anti-TNF hepatotoxicity is an acute
hepatocellular injury (R > 5 in 75% of cases), occurring a median of 13 weeks after initiation
of therapy; however, 7 of 34 cases had a latency greater than 6 months. Pure bland
cholestasis was also observed in 1 case (DILIN subject 3). Laboratory data revealed that
serum aminotransferases ranged from 140 to >2000 U/L and that bilirubin was significantly
elevated (>3 mg/dL) in 10 of 27 patients (37%). Of note, reactivation of chronic hepatitis B,
acute hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis E virus infection were excluded in all
of the DILIN cases. Autoimmune features (positive ANA and/or ASMA) were common,
including some with classic histologic features of AIH.6,9,26–33
Fortunately, the prognosis was usually good. The fact that in 6 cases (3 very likely and 3
probable), the autoantibodies decreased or disappeared with corticosteroid therapy suggests
drug-induced rather than de novo idiopathic autoimmunity.34 This autoimmune signature
(either AIH on biopsy or ANA titers ≥1:80) was seen in 22 patients and occurred with
infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept treatment, supporting the concept that despite
molecular structural differences, a class effect is present. The 12 cases lacking autoimmune
features were also different, because their latency was significantly shorter (10 vs 16 weeks),
and the peak serum ALT (median, 528 vs 784 U/L) and R values were lower than those
cases with autoimmune features (Table 4). Prolonged cholestasis may also occur, as
exemplified by DILIN subject 3.
The mechanism by which the TNF-α antagonists lead to DILI is unknown. Because the
injury can occur after only one infusion, dose-dependent toxicity is unlikely, although
patients in whom low dose etanercept was tolerated after developing DILI with full dose
injection have been reported.11,12 Unpredictable idiosyncratic DILI seems most likely,
because in this series no patients had clinical evidence of a rash or eosinophilia, and only
one presented with fever. Nonetheless, the serologic and histopathologic studies with
features of AIH strongly suggest that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are
important in the pathogenesis. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether genetic or
other markers of the hepatotoxicity associated with TNF-α antagonists can be identified.
In summary, we have described 6 well-characterized cases of DILI in the setting of TNF-α
antagonist therapy and also reviewed 28 additional published cases. The most common
clinical presentation was that of an acute hepatocellular injury with autoimmune features,
including histologic changes that are similar to spontaneous AIH. Additional presentations

include a milder mixed injury pattern with shorter latency and less commonly, a prolonged
cholestatic injury pattern. The prognosis is generally favorable, and corticosteroids may be
helpful in accelerating resolution in subjects with autoimmune features. Treatment with an
alternative TNF-α antagonist after resolution of the liver injury appears to be well tolerated
without recurrence.
