Abstract
Rhabdomyolysis is a pathogenetic cause of acute kidney injury. In
such circumstances, not only should therapeutic strategies to
replace the failing kidney be implemented, but measures should
also be explored to prevent further damage by circulating
myoglobin. Volume expansion and forced diuresis have been used,
but when a kidney fails, renal replacement therapies are instituted.
The techniques and devices used for classic dialytic techniques
have displayed a limited capacity for the removal of circulating
myoglobin. In a recent paper, Naka and colleagues have proposed
the use of a super-high-flux membrane in continuous hemofiltration.
The removal of myoglobin was greater than in than any previous
report. Thus, if the removal of myoglobin is desirable, a
combination of continuous hemofiltration and hyperpermeable
membranes seems to be the most effective. However, care must
be exercised to prevent unwanted albumin losses.
Rhabdomyolysis is a pathogenetic cause of acute kidney
injury in a large number of cases where traumatic or nontraumatic causes induce muscle cell disruption [1]. Naka and
colleagues concluded an interesting study on myoglobin
clearance by hemofiltration using a ‘super-high-flux’
membrane in a case of acute rhabdomyolysis [2].
The paper is of peculiar interest for several reasons. First,
because of the renal damage induced by circulating
myoglobin, not only should therapeutic strategies be
implemented to replace the failing kidney function, but
preventive measures should also be explored to prevent
further damage due to renal tubular obstruction, altered
intrarenal hemodynamics and tubular cell dysfunction. So far,
acute kidney failure has been treated by classical methods of
renal replacement therapies, while protective measures have
been limited to volume expansion by alkaline fluids and forced
diuresis by osmotic diuretics. Second, all attempts to
produce a significant removal of myoglobin by extracorporeal
therapies have so far displayed controversial results but in
general they have been proved to be modestly useful. Thus,
although the rationale for a quick and effective removal of
myoglobin in acute rhabdomyolysis would be strong and
logical, the practical results obtained with traditional methods
have been disappointing. The inefficient removal of myoglobin
results in a permanently high circulating level of the molecule
and a perpetuation of the pathological insult with
prolongation of anuria and delay of renal function recovery.
Why are extracorporeal techniques hardly effective in
removing myoglobin? There are several reasons that depend
on the nature of the molecule, on its distribution in the
organism, on the mechanism of solute transport and on the
structure of the membrane in the extracorporeal technique.
Myoglobin has a molecular mass of 17 kDa but because it is
non-spherical and carries electrical charges it can be
considered to be a solute with an Einstein–Stokes radius
greater than expected. In these circumstances, not only does
the solute have a very low diffusion coefficient, thus requiring
transport by convection, but it also possesses a steric
magnitude that is likely to be rejected by the membrane
pores. The volume of distribution in the human body is not
known but the molecule has been estimated to be distributed
into two pools: one is in equilibrium with the vascular
circulation, which should be about one-tenth of the body
weight; the other is in equilibrium with the muscle tissue,
which is hard to define. The two pools do not equilibrate
rapidly, so a very efficient system of blood purification will
cause a significant decrease in the circulating levels,
suggesting that optimal application will involve intermittent
frequency. In contrast, a less efficient system, capable of
maintaining the levels at a steady state, can cope with the
daily generation but needs to be administered 24 hours a

day. Finally, the membrane and technique used for the
membrane separation process are crucial for the efficiency of
the therapy. There is no question that convection should be
used, because of the molecular mass of the solute. However,
standard cellulosic membranes are practically impermeable
to the molecule; high-flux membranes should be used.
The limitation imposed by high-flux membranes in convective
therapies such as hemofiltration is that in the presence of a
low sieving coefficient for myoglobin, even high-volume
hemofiltration or pulse high-volume hemofiltration may be
inefficient [3]. Theoretically the sieving for myoglobin should
be in the range 0.4 to 0.6, but this is only true in optimal
conditions, with aqueous solutions and in the absence of
concentration polarization. The average pore size is a
statistical function and very little is known about the shape of
the Gaussian curve of the pore size distribution when the
membrane is used in vivo with the interference of high
filtration fractions and plasma proteins. Under these
conditions the sieving value may fall below 0.1, so that even
in the presence of high filtration volumes the final clearance
will be negligible.
Attempts to use plasmapheresis have resulted in higher
sieving coefficients, but the final clearance is minimal
because of the limitations imposed by low volume exchanges.
A different approach could be tried either using adsorption
directly on whole blood or using coupled plasma-filtration
adsorption in which the patient’s plasma is reinfused after
being regenerated by passage through a sorbent cartridge.
Results with such systems are under evaluation and seem
encouraging.
The solution proposed by Naka and colleagues seems to be
feasible and effective. The use of a continuous technique in
conjunction with a hyperpermeable membrane with a
myoglobin sieving well beyond the classic values observed
with high-flux membranes seems to provide clearance and
removal values previously unobtainable. One of the possible
limitations is represented by albumin leakage, which should
be rigorously tested and evaluated in a wider series of
patients and treatment conditions. In the case described in
this study, myoglobin clearance was significantly greater with
the hyperpermeable membrane than the control treatment
with a standard high-flux membrane.
In conclusion, the use of hyperpermeable membranes in
continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) might
represent a novel approach to the treatment of acute
rhabdomyolysis not only because efficient renal replacement
is provided but also because a potential protective effect can
be envisaged in the rapid and efficient removal of circulating
myoglobin. Potential drawbacks due to unwanted loss of
beneficial molecules should be carefully explored;
nevertheless, the therapy could be of enormous advantage
and, in the case of excessive albumin losses, pulse superhigh-flux therapy could be used in conjunction with standard
CVVH for a few hours each day as a compromise between
the beneficial effects of myoglobin removal and the negative
effects of excessive albumin losses in continuous treatments.
A randomized controlled trial would be of interest in
comparing the innovative and traditional approaches, using
as the primary end-point the time to renal recovery. Such a
trial will probably be difficult to perform for several reasons;
nevertheless, the rationale for the new therapy is known and
we should try to provide a certain level of evidence from
observational studies and case series if studies at a higher
level are not yet available or are impossible to perform. The
commercial availability of such new membranes in daily
practice will definitely broaden the possibilities of the clinical
application of super-high-flux hemofiltration techniques.
