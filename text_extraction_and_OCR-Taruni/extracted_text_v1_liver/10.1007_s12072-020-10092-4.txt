Dear Editor
COVID-19 is associated with higher mortality in patients 
pre-existing comorbidities. There has been several reports 
recently describing abnormalities in liver function tests 
(LFT) in COVID-19 patients ranging from very mild abnormalities in the non-cirrhotic patients to moderate elevation 
of liver enzymes in the cirrhotic patients [1, 2]. Our recent 
review showed that 14–53% of patients with COVID-19 
developed hepatic dysfunction and 2–11% of patients had 
underlying chronic liver disease [3].
In this context, we would like to report two of our patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis presented with acute-onchronic liver failure (ACLF) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Both patients had a rapidly progressive liver failure followed 
by respiratory failure and succumbed to the disease within 
days of the diagnosis.
Case 1 A 69-year-old gentleman with NASH cirrhosis 
and chronic portal vein thrombosis was diagnosed in March 
2020 with a small hepatocellular carcinoma. His bilirubin 
was 8.8 mg/dl, alanine amino transferase (ALT) 42 U/L, 
albumin 2.6 g/dL, INR 1.54 and creatinine 1.28 mg/dl. 
His Child Pugh score was 10 (Class C) and his model for 
end-stage liver disease (MELD) was 23. His HBsAg, antiHBcAb, and anti-HCV antibodies were negative. He was 
being worked up for liver transplantation. He presented 
again in mid-April with 5 days history of abdominal distension, altered sensorium and breathing difculty. His past 
medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Clinical examination revealed jaundice, moderate 
ascites (grade 2), pedal edema and grade 2 encephalopathy. 
His respiratory rate was 28 per minute and oxygen saturation 
92% on room air. His arterial blood gas showed pH 7·314, 
pO2 55·4 mm Hg and pCO2 36·8 mmHg. His Hb 12.1 g/dl, 
white blood cell count 7780 cells/mm3
, diferential count 
showed Neutrophils 6690 cells/mm3 (86%), lymphocytes 
311 cells/mm3 (4.0%), and platelet count 139×109/L. He 
was negative for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E IgM antibodies. 
His serum bilirubin was 20·2 mg/dl, ALT 58 U/L, albumin 
2.7 g/dL, International normalized ratio (INR) 2.82 and creatinine was 2·83 mg/dl (not on diuretics). His Child Pugh 
score was 13 (Class C) and MELD was 39. The marker of 
acute phase reaction such as C-Reactive protein (CRP) was 
not available.
His chest X-ray showed left-sided pleural efusion. A CT 
thorax revealed bilateral patchy ground glass attenuation of 
the lung parenchyma (Fig. 1a). His nasopharyngeal swab for 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was positive. Ascitic fuid analysis 
did not show spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. He was commenced on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin which was 
the then protocol for management of COVID-19 patients. 
However, his clinical condition deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and worsening hypoxia requiring ventilatory support. Patient died on day 4 following the diagnosis.
Case 2 A 47-year-old gentleman was examined in December 2019. He had decompensated cryptogenic cirrhosis with 
serum bilirubin of 12.2 mg/dl, ALT 70 U/L, INR 1.82, albumin 2.5 g/dl and creatinine 0.58 mg/dl. He was negative for 
Hepatitis B including anti-HBcAb and anti-HCV antibodies. His non-invasive liver screen did not show metabolic or 
autoimmune etiology. There was no signifcant past medical 
history. He was advised work up for liver transplantation, 
but there was some delay in the process due to COVID-19 
pandemic. He re-presented at the end of March 2020 with 
jaundice and abdominal distension. He was breathless with a 
respiratory rate 32 per minute. He was jaundiced, had tense 
ascites with no encephalopathy. His oxygen saturation was 
89% on room air. His blood tests showed Hb 12.1 g/dl, white 
cell count 6530 cells/mm3
 with neutrophils 5550 cells/mm3
(85%) and lymphocytes 457 cells/mm3 (7.0%) and platelet 
count 114×109
/L. His serology was negative for Hepatitis 
A and E IgM. His LFT showed a signifcant deterioration 
with bilirubin 21.6 mg/dl, ALT 70 U/L, INR 3.36, creatinine 
0.97 mg/dl, with MELD of 32. His CRP was 12.4 mg/L.

His chest X-ray showed mild bilateral patchy opacities. In 
view of tense ascites and respiratory distress, a large volume 
paracentesis was performed but with no improvement in his 
symptoms. His CT thorax showed difuse areas of mosaic 
attenuation changes in both lungs. His nasopharyngeal swab 
for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was initially negative. However, 
his condition continued to deteriorate with hepatic encephalopathy and hypotension requiring admission to intensive 
care. His repeat chest X-ray showed worsening bilateral pulmonary infltrates (Fig. 1b). A repeat RT-PCR was positive 
for SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, his liver and hemodynamic 
parameters deteriorated with increasing oxygen requirement 
needing invasive ventilation. He died of multiorgan failure 
3 days after the 2nd COVID-19 test.
Discussion
These two cases possibly illustrate the adverse efect of 
SARS-CoV-2 in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
Both these patients developed signifcant liver injury 
probably related to SARS-CoV-2, leading to jaundice, 
coagulopathy, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, fulflling 
the APASL defnition for ACLF. Subsequently, their condition worsened with hemodynamic instability and progressive hypoxia leading to untimely death. Liver is involved 
in COVID-19 probably by direct cytopathic efect or possibly by cytokine mediated injury. Interestingly, ACE2 the 
receptor that binds SARS-CoV-2 is highly expressed in 
cholangiocytes (59.7%) and in hepatic vasculatures. Elevated liver enzymes in COVID-19 were observed more in 
critically ill patients. Hepatic dysfunction in these patients 
was associated with poor prognosis [3]. Clinical deterioration with worsening of jaundice, ascites leading to ACLF in 
our cases were probably linked to COVID-19. There was no 
other attributable precipitating cause that we could identify. 
A transjugular liver biopsy may have been useful, unfortunately, both patients were clinically unstable to undergo the 
procedure.
Wang and colleagues [4] described fndings from postmortem liver biopsy in two patients with severe COVID-19. 
The liver histology showed substantial apoptosis of hepatocytes with mild-to-moderate focal lobular infammation and 
lymphocytic infltration. More importantly, electron microscopy identifed large number of coronavirus particles within 
the cytoplasm of hepatocytes with associated mitochondrial 
edema and damaged cell membrane. Treatment of COVID19 continues to evolve. Based on recent trials HCQ is no 
longer recommended.
Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic used in COVID-19 
to prevent bacterial infections, is metabolized in the liver 
and, therefore, should be used with caution in cirrhotic 
patients.
Both our patients developed worsening hemodynamics 
and altered neurological status, the cause of which could 
be multitude. Most likely reason in this scenario is hepatic 
encephalopathy related to worsening liver failure secondary 
to COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 related neurotoxicity 
could not be ruled out. A recent systematic review reported 
at least 25% COVID-19 patients develop neurological complication, manifesting as headache and altered sensorium 
[5]. Alternatively, hypoxia and multiorgan failure related to 
liver failure could also mimic hepatic encephalopathy. It is 
known that COVID-19 patients with underlying comorbid 
conditions are associated with poor survival. Patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis, in addition to underlying liver dysfunction, coexisting complications such as hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia and frailty may infuence the clinical outcome, particularly in the presence of superadded infections. 
Moreover, cirrhosis is characterised by increased systemic 
infammation and immune paralysis at the same time, leading to complex immunological dysfunction. These factors

may contribute to severe disease with rapid progression in 
patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Thus the presence of 
underlying cirrhosis is probably associated with much higher 
mortality in COVID-19 compared to other comorbidities.
To our knowledge, ours is the frst reported cases of 
COVID-19 associated with ACLF fulflling APASL criteria leading to rapid deterioration and death. A preliminary 
data from an international liver registry reported 152 cases 
of COVID-19 in patients with chronic liver disease with 
a higher morality in Child Pugh C disease. However, the 
median bilirubin in this series was 1·1 mg/dl with a MELD 
score of 10 and notably there was no reported ACLF [6]. 
Given the ongoing pandemic in several countries, it is 
important to obtain cases as much as possible for better 
management of these high--risk patients.
