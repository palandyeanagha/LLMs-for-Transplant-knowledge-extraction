Abstract
Background: A better understanding of the development of metastatic disease and the identification of
molecular markers for cancer spread would be useful for the design of improved treatment strategies. This study
was conducted to identify gene expressions associated with metastatic phenotypes of locally advanced cervical
carcinomas and investigate whether gains or losses of these genes could play a role in regulation of the transcripts.
Gene expressions and copy number changes were determined in primary tumors from 29 patients with and 19
without diagnosed lymph node metastases by use of cDNA and genomic microarray techniques, respectively.
Results: Thirty-one genes that differed in expression between the node positive and negative tumors were
identified. Expressions of eight of these genes (MRPL11, CKS2, PDK2, MRPS23, MSN, TBX3, KLF3, LSM3) correlated
with progression free survival in univariate analysis and were therefore more strongly associated with metastatic
phenotypes than the others. Immunohistochemistry data of CKS2 and MSN showed similar relationships to
survival. The prognostic genes clustered into two groups, suggesting two major metastatic phenotypes. One
group was associated with rapid proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation, invasiveness, and tumor size (MRPS23,
MRPL11, CKS2, LSM3, TBX3, MSN) and another with hypoxia tolerance, anaerobic metabolism, and high lactate
content (PDK2, KLF3). Multivariate analysis identified tumor volume and PDK2 expression as independent
prognostic variables. Gene copy number changes of the differentially expressed genes were not frequent, but
correlated with the expression level for seven genes, including MRPS23, MSN, and LSM3.
Conclusion: Gene expressions associated with known metastatic phenotypes of cervical cancers were identified.
Our findings may indicate molecular mechanisms underlying development of these phenotypes and be useful as
markers of cancer spread. Gains or losses of the genes may be involved in development of the metastatic
phenotypes in some cases, but other mechanisms for transcriptional regulation are probably important in the
majority of tumors.

Background
Lymph node involvement is the first indication of spreading and a strong prognostic factor for epithelial cancers
[1]. A better understanding of the development of metastatic tumor phenotypes and the identification of molecular markers for lymphatic spread would be useful in
design of improved treatment strategies [2]. Cervical carcinomas have been studied extensively during the last
years in the search for biological characteristics that are
associated with lymph node involvement. Tumor volume
is among the strongest prognostic factors. Severe hypoxia,
high level of lactate, high proliferation rate, increased angiogenesis, high interstitial fluid pressure, and low apoptotic activity have also been associated with poor
prognosis [3-9], suggesting that these are metastasis promoting phenotypes. The molecular biology behind these
phenotypes has not been clarified, but the proliferation
proteins EGFR and ERBB2, the anti-apoptosis proteins
cIAP1 and BCL2, and the glucose transporter GLUT1 may
be involved [10-14]. A more comprehensive characterization of the tumors is, however, needed to achieve a complete understanding of how metastatic phenotypes
develop in cervical cancers.
Gene expression microarrays are useful for discovery of
new genes that are regulated in metastatic tumors [2,15].
Panels of genes associated with lymph node metastasis
have been identified for several cancer types by using this
technique [2,16], suggesting that the gene expression program is altered in metastatic as compared to nonmetastatic tumors. Genes related to treatment outcome or
lymph node metastasis have also been identified in
microarray studies of cervical cancers [17-19]. Less than
20 patients were included in these studies, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions from the results. Moreover,
protein expressions or copy numbers of the genes were
not addressed.
In the present work we have used microarrays to identify
gene expressions associated with metastatic phenotypes of
cervical cancers and to investigate whether gains or losses
of these genes could play a role in the transcriptional regulation and phenotype development. Locally advanced
primary tumors of squamous cell origin, all receiving curative radiotherapy, were included. Treatment outcome
differs considerably among these patients, emphasizing
the need for identifying and exploring risk factors. We
report 31 genes that differed in expression between lymph
node positive and negative tumors, as diagnosed from
magnetic resonance (MR) images. These genes provided a
basis for further analyses and enabled us to generate
hypotheses of gene functions in metastatic tumors. The
importance of gains and losses for the expression of these
genes were explored by including genomic microarray
data in the analyses. The gene data were further related to
progression free survival, since this end point is a stronger
indicator of the metastatic capacity of the tumors than the
diagnosed metastatic status per se. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed to identify coregulated genes
that were probably associated with the same phenotypes.
Results
Differentially expressed genes in node positive versus 
node negative tumors
Twenty-nine patients were diagnosed with pathologic
lymph nodes in the pelvic region, including three with
additional pathologic para-aortic nodes, whereas 19
patients were node negative. Thirty-one genes with major
difference in expression when comparing the data of node
positive and negative tumors, were selected. These were
16 genes with higher and 15 with lower expression in the
node positive tumors (Figure 1A) and included genes coding for structural proteins, such as the mitochondrial
ribosomal proteins MRPS23 and MRPL11, enzymes participating in metabolism, like the pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinase PDK2 and the hexokinase HK2, proteins interacting with the extracellular matrix, such as moesin (MSN)
and the hyaluronglucosaminidase HYAL1, the cell division cycle CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 2
(CKS2), the proteinase inhibitor cystatin A (CSTA), and
others with multiple or more unclear functions with
regard to metastasis development, like the hypothetical
proteins MGC14151, LSM3, and FLJ13291, the muscleblind-like protein MBNL2, the T-box transcription factor
TBX3, the krüppel-like factor KLF3, the annexin ANXA4,
and the myocyte enhancer factor MEF2A (Table 1). The
data of probes representing the same gene, but with a different sequence, were always highly correlated (p <
0.0001), and the most differentially expressed probe is
listed. The microarray data showed significant correlation
to quantitative real time (qRT) PCR measurements of
selected genes (Additional file 1).
Gene copy numbers
Pronounced gene copy number changes were observed in
most tumors, and gains on chromosome 1q, 3q, and 5p
and losses on 3p were among the most frequent ones
(data not shown). The 31 genes identified from the gene
expression microarray analysis were selected for further
analyses (Additional file 2). Gain and/or loss was seen for
all these genes (Figure 1B), however, the aberrations were
generally not frequent and occurred in less than half of the
tumors for all but CSTA on 3q21. Some genes were
located on the same chromosomal region (Table 1), such
as MRPS23 and PDK2 on 17q (Figure 2A), and the data of
these genes were highly correlated (data not shown). Significant relationship between the gene copy number
changes and expressions was found for seven genes:
MRPS23, MSN, LSM3, ANXA4, MBNL2, FLJ13291, and
MGC14151, for which aberrations were detected in 5–23

Gene expressions and copy numbers in Figure 1 node negative and positive tumors
Gene expressions and copy numbers in node negative and positive tumors. A, Expression ratios of 31 genes that differed in expression between 19 node negative and 29 node positive cervical tumors. The data are the average log2ratio of two 
dye-swap experiments. Gene symbols (NCBI UniGene) are shown to the right. The genes indicated with a dark blue line were 
upregulated in node positive compared to node negative tumors, whereas those marked light blue were downregulated. The 
ratios were median centered, and expressions higher and lower than the median expression of that gene are shown in red and 
green, respectively. The most intense colors represent log2ratios of > 2.0 (red) and < -2.0 (green) relative to the median, 
whereas black represents expression close to the median value. B, Gene copy number relative to modal DNA content 
(log2ratio) of the BAC clones covering or are close to the genes in (A) for the patients presented in (A). Patient P-058 is not 
included, since tumor DNA was not available. BAC clone identifications and the corresponding gene symbols (NCBI UniGene) 
are shown to the right. Gene gains and losses are shown in red and green, respectively, whereas black represents no aberration. The most intense red and green colors represent log2ratios of > 0.8 and < -0.8, respectively. The log2ratios varied 
between -0.84 and 2.19.

tumors (Figure 2B). Among these genes, the copy number
changes correlated with metastatic status for ANXA4 and
FLJ13291 (Additional file 3). The comparison of the data
between node positive and negative tumors was, however,
hampered by the very few cases with aberrations.
Protein expressions
Immunohistochemistry was performed on five genes
(CKS2, CSTA, HK2, MEF2A, MSN), for which differentially expression between node positive and negative
tumors was observed and antibodies were commercially
available, to assess the protein expression and identify the
cell types expressing the gene. All proteins were expressed
in tumor cells (Figure 3), and expression was also seen in
stroma cells for HK2, MEF2A, and MSN. The expression
levels differed considerably among the tumors for all proteins. To search for relationships between gene and protein expression, the immunostaining in both tumor and
stroma cells was considered by calculating an average
score for the two cell types using data on tumor cell fraction. For CSTA and MSN there was a linear relationship
between protein and gene expression, but for CKS2 a certain transcript level seemed to be needed before protein
was detected (data not shown). We therefore compared
the immunostaining score between the quartile of cases
(n = 12) with the highest gene expression and the remaining 36 ones for CKS2 and CSTA, which were upregulated
in node positive tumors, and between the quartile of cases
with the lowest gene expression and the remaining 36
ones for MSN, HK2, and MEF2A, which were downregulated in node positive tumors. The immunostaining score
of CKS2, CSTA, and MSN was significantly higher in the
cases with high gene expression compared to those with
low (p < 0.007 for each protein), in concordance with the
gene expression results. The difference remained significant when only the immunostaining in tumor cells was
considered for MSN (Figure 3). No correlation between
gene and protein expression was found for MEF2A or
HK2, regardless of whether immunostaining in both cell
types (data not shown) or only in tumor cells was considered (Figure 3).
Progression free survival
The data of the differentially expressed genes were related
to progression free survival in univariate analysis to find
the genes with the strongest relationship to metastasis.
The correlation was significant for the expression of
MRPL11, PDK2, KLF3, MRPS23, CKS2, TBX3, LSM3, and
MSN (Table 2), suggesting that these genes were more
strongly associated with metastatic phenotypes than the
others. MRPL11, CKS2, and PDK2 were the most significant ones (Table 2, Figure 4A). The highest significances
were generally achieved with the categorised data and are
listed for all genes, although the ratios (linear or log2)
were more significant for MRPS23, CKS2, LSM3. Tumor
volume was the strongest prognostic factor among the
clinical variables (Table 2). Metastastic status per se, as
determined by MR imaging, showed no prognostic significance due to the limited number of patients, however,
number of pathological lymph nodes was significant.
Multivariate analysis identified MRPL11, TBX3, and PDK2
expression as independent prognostic gene variables,
whereas only tumor volume was identified in a model
containing the clinical variables (Table 2). Tumor volume
and PDK2 expression remained independent prognostic
variables when both clinical and gene variables were considered.
Univariate analysis of the gene copy number changes, categorised as gain, loss, or no change, showed a significant
relationship to progression free survival for MRPS23 (p =
0.0002), PDK2 (p = 0.004), and MSN (p = 0.016).
Although the aberrations were not frequent, occurring in
5 (MRPS23), 7 (PDK2), and 14 (MSN) tumors, they
seemed to have a pronounced influence on the survival
probability when they occurred (Figure 4B). The relationship for MRPS23 and PDK2 was similar, except for two
additional losses of PDK2, reflecting their colocation on
chromosome 17q. The three tumors with gain of PDK2
had a high PDK2 expression, however, there was no general correlation between expression and aberration for
this gene (Figure 2B). The results in Figure 4B for PDK2
could therefore be a consequence of its colocalization
with MRPS23. The results of MRPS23 and MSN, on the
other hand, were consistent with our observations that the
aberrations correlated with the expression levels of these
genes (Figure 2B) and that the expression levels showed
prognostic significance (Figure 4A).
In univariate analysis of the protein expressions the
immunostaining score of the tumor cells was included as
continuous data, without considering the score in stroma
cells. The data showed a significant relationship to progression free survival for CKS2 (p = 0.034) and MSN (p =
0.025), but not for CSTA, MEF2A, and HK2. The largest
difference in survival was achieved when using a cut off
for the immunostaining score of 4 and 9 for CKS2 and
MSN, respectively (Figure 4C). The protein data were
therefore in concordance with the gene expression results,
showing that high expression of CKS2 and low expression
of MSN were associated with poor survival (Figure 4A).
Gene clusters
Unsupervised clustering of the eight prognostic genes was
performed based on the gene expression microarray data
(log2ratios) to identify genes that were coregulated in the
same tumors and therefore probably associated with the
same phenotypes. The genes clustered into two major
groups with high degree of collinearity (p < 0.05), one
group with MSN, TBX3, LSM3, CKS2, MRPL1, and

MRPS23 and another with PDK2 and KLF3 (Figure 5A),
suggesting that they were associated with at least two distinct phenotypes. The data of the former group, except for
MSN expression, showed a significant correlation to
tumor volume (p < 0.04 for each gene), whereas no such
relationship was found for PDK2 and KLF3 expression.
To ensure that the expression data of each phenotype separated the patients into groups with different survival
probability, unsupervised clustering of the patients was
performed. The combined expression data (log2ratios) of
each group of coregulated genes were used in two separate
analyses. Clustering based on MSN, TBX3, LSM3, CKS2,
MRPL1, and MRPS23 expression identified four tumor
groups, for which patients of group 1 and 4, with high
expression of LSM3, CKS2, MRPL11, and MRPS23 and, in
general, low expression of MSN and TBX3 compared to
group 2 and 3, had the lowest survival probability (Figure
5B). Seven of the eight tumors with gain of MRPS23 or
loss of MSN were in these groups. A similar analysis based
on KLF3 and PDK2 expression, separated two major
tumor groups, for which patients in the group with high
PDK2 and low KLF3 expression had the lowest survival
probability (Figure 5C). All tumors with gain of PDK2
were in this group. Each of the two phenotypes indicated
by the coregulated genes in Figure 5A were therefore associated with poor progression free survival probability and
therefore with metastasis development.
Discussion
Genes that differed in expression between node positive
and negative cervical tumors and therefore may be related
to metastatic phenotypes, were identified in our study.
Our data on protein expressions and gene copy numbers
provided information on the cell type expressing the
genes and the regulation mechanisms involved. The frequent copy number changes, especially on chromosome
1q, 3q, 3p, and 5p, were consistent with previous reports
[20,21]. Copy number changes of the differentially
expressed genes were, however, less common. Such
changes do probably not play a role in development of the
metastatic phenotypes in the majority of tumors, for
which other transcriptional regulation mechanisms seem
to be important. It should be noted that no general conclusion about the role of gene copy number changes in
development of the metastatic phenotypes could be
drawn from our study, since only selected genes were considered. Gains or losses of other genes may be important
and even influence the expression of the genes addressed
here.

The protein data were not correlated with the gene expressions of two of the five proteins investigated, HK2 and
MEF2A. Cross-reaction of the antibodies used for immunohistochemistry to other proteins may explain this
apparent discrepancy. Hence, although the MEF2A antibody used was recommended for this protein, the producer states that cross-reactions to MEF2C and MEF2D
may occur to a lesser extent. The protein data may also be
less representative of the entire tumor than the gene
expressions, since they were derived from a single biopsy

whereas several samples were used in the microarray analyses. Moreover, post-transcriptional control of the protein
levels is a likely explanation of these results as well [22].
We identified two independent groups of genes with prognostic significance, suggesting the existence of at least two
major metastatic phenotypes of the locally advanced
stages of cervical carcinomas. None of the prognostic
genes have previously been associated with metastasis in
this tumor type. Genes, such as EGFR, ERBB2, BCL2, cIAP,
and GLUT1, which have shown correlations to survival in
protein studies [10-14], were, however, not identified
here. None of these were differentially expressed between
the node positive and negative tumors with the cut off
used in our study and therefore not considered in the further analyses. A separate analysis showed that EGFR
expression correlated with survival (data not shown), in
concordance with previous reports [13]. The other genes
may be regulated post-transcriptionally or be prognostic
in larger studies. Our strategy was therefore not suited to

find all prognostic genes, but ensured that the ones identified were truly associated with metastatic phenotypes.
Based on the current knowledge of gene function it was
possible to relate the prognostic genes to biological characteristics that have been associated with metastasis development in cervical cancers and thereby propose molecular
mechanisms underlying these characteristics.
MRPS23, MRPL11, CKS2, TBX3, LSM3, and MSN constituted the largest group of coregulated and prognostic
genes. The former five genes probably play a role in tumor
growth, since their expression showed a significant relationship to tumor volume. MRPS23 and MRPL11 are
structural components of the mitochondria. Upregulation
of these genes suggests increased mitochondrial activity,
energy production through oxidative phosphorylation,
and a high oxygen consumption rate. CKS2 is involved in
cell cycle control, and its activation has been associated
with high proliferation of lymphoma cells and incidence
of metastasis in colon carcinomas [23,24]. LSM3 and
TBX3 may also participate in cell cycle control; upregulation of LSM3 promotes proliferation of pancreatic cancer
cells, and TBX3 may interact with the cell cycle protein
CDKN2A [25,26]. Our data are therefore consistent with
increased mitochondrial activity and cellular proliferation
in metastatic tumors, probably leading to rapid growth
and large volumes. These phenotypes have previously
been associated with poor prognosis of cervical cancer [7],
and our findings point to genes that are associated with
and might participate in their development. Furthermore,
when gains and losses of MRPS23 and LSM3 occur, they
may influence the gene expressions and possibly the
development of metastatic disease.
Clustering of MSN together with MRPS23, MRPL11,
CKS2, TBX, and LSM suggests a role of this gene in cell
proliferation, consistent with previous studies [27]. Loss
of MSN function may also cause cell depolarization,
increased motility, and invasiveness, and therefore be
directly involved in several steps during spreading [27].
MSN repression may therefore actively promote metastasis development in some rapidly growing tumors. Our
data further suggest that gene loss leads to MSN downregulation and is associated with a metastatic phenotype.
Loss of heterozygosity studies have shown increased
imbalance on the X chromosome in lymph node metastases as compared to the primary cervical tumors, in agreement with this hypothesis [28].
The other group of coregulated and prognostic genes,
PDK2 and KLF3, is probably associated with hypoxia tolerance. Activation of PDK2 directs glycolytically derived
pyruvate towards anaerobic metabolism and lactate output rather than oxidative phosphorylation through
repression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex
[29]. Repression of KLF3 may indicate increased glucose
metabolism under hypoxia, although other functions
involving growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, have also
been proposed [30,31]. Our data on PDK2 and KLF3
therefore suggest activation of strategies to conserve
energy and, hence, survive under hypoxia. Hypoxia and
high lactate content are prognostic factors for cervical cancer [3,5,8], consistent with our hypothesis. Moreover,
repression of PDH subunit alpha 1 has previously been
associated with treatment outcome of this disease [17],
and similar survival strategies are probably used in other
tumor types, showing activation of lactate dehydrogenases [32,33]. Our data showed that tumors with concurrent gain of PDK2 and MRPS23 had high expression of
MRPS23 and PDK2, large volumes above the median
value, a very short survival time and, therefore, an
extremely high risk for metastasis development, suggesting the combined characteristics of rapid proliferation,
high oxygen consumption, and hypoxia tolerance.
The regulation of the other differentially expressed genes
also contributes to the characteristics of metastatic disease. Many of them were coregulated with the prognostic
ones, and could be markers of a high proliferation activity
or regulated in response to hypoxia. Repression of NTN4
and HYAL1 may promote cell migration and invasive
growth, whereas BAI3, VWF, and EPB41L4B probably participate in angiogenesis, attachment of tumor cells to
endothelial surfaces, or reflect vascular structures in the
tumors [34-36]. Moreover, regulation of NEK1, CSTA,
ANXA4, and DDOST indicates activation of DNA damage
repair (NEK1) and resistance to apoptosis (CSTA and possibly ANXA4 and DDOST) [37-39], whereas transcriptional downregulation of HK2 may be a result of glucose
deprivation [22]. The roles of MBNL2, RCL1, MGC14151,
ERO1L, DNAJC9, PLAC2, and MEF2A are more unclear,
but may involve regulation of proteins like the insulin
receptor (MBNL2) [40] or proteins participating in development (MEF2A). Elevated VWF plasma levels have been
found in node positive cervical cancer patients [41], consistent with our results. Moreover, increased CSTA protein
expression has been correlated with poor prognosis of
breast carcinoma, whereas repression of ERO1L has been
shown to increase the recurrence probability of pulmonary adenocarcinoma [42,43], suggesting that these genes
are related to metastasis development also in other tumor
types.
Conclusion
We have identified genes associated with major metastatic
phenotypes of cervical cancers that probably are related to
rapid proliferation and hypoxia. Copy number changes of
the genes may be involved in development of these phenotypes in some cases, but other mechanisms for transcriptional regulation are probably important in the

majority of tumors. The gene expressions may be useful
markers of cancer spread, since they showed a stronger
relationship to progression free survival than the metastatic status and number of pathological lymph nodes and
added prognostic information to tumor volume.
Although our findings need to be confirmed in larger
studies with more patients, they provide a useful basis for
further investigations to reveal the mechanisms underlying development of these phenotypes.
Methods
Patients, lymph node involvement, and treatment
Forty-eight patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, diagnosed in the period 2001
– 2004 at Health Enterprise Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, were included. Tumor stage (The Fédération Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes) was 2a (1
patient), 2b (29), 3b (14), and 4a (4), and tumor grade
was 2 or 3. Lymph nodes were evaluated at the time of
diagnosis with MR imaging, using axial fast spin echo T2-
weighted images. A pelvic phased array coil was used for
nodes below the promontory. The body coil was used for
retroperitoneal nodes from the promontory to the upper
pole of the kidneys. Lymph nodes were classified as pathologic when the minimal axial diameter exceeded 10 mm
in oval nodes or 8 mm in round nodes. Using these criteria for metastasis in pelvic lymph nodes in prostatic and
urinary bladder carcinoma, the sensitivity and specificity
were 75% and 98%, respectively [44]. Some tumors may
therefore falsely be classified as node negative. Pretreatment tumor volume, determined from the MR images as
π/6·x·y·z, where x is largest diameter in the sagittal plane
through the cervix length axis and y and z are diameters in
a plane orthogonal to this axis, ranged from 17 – 336 cm3
(median 46 cm3).
All patients received external irradiation and brachytherapy with curative intent. External irradiation, 50 Gy to
tumor and parametria and 45 Gy to the rest of the pelvic
region, was delivered by use of a linear accelerator in 25
fractions five times per week. A 192Ir stepping source was
used for endocavitary brachytherapy, employing 21Gy in
five fractions to point A. Adjuvant cisplatin (40 mg/m2)
was given weekly in maximum 6 courses during the
period of external radiation. Twenty-two patients completed all cisplatin courses, whereas the others had dose
reduction or delay due to toxicity problems. The follow up
included clinical examinations every 3rd month for the
first 2 years, twice a year the next three years, and thereafter once a year. MR imaging of pelvis and retroperitoneum
and X-ray of thorax were performed when symptoms of
recurrent disease were seen. Progression free survival,
defined as the time between diagnosis and the first event
of locoregional and/or distant relapse or cancer related
death, was used as end point. Four patients, who died due
to cerebral hemorrhage or treatment related complications, were censored. All other deaths were cancer related.
Observation time, calculated for the patients that were
still alive, ranged from 15 – 51 months (median 36
months). The study was approved by the regional committee of medical research ethics in southern Norway
(REK no. S-01129), and written informed-consent was
achieved from all patients.
Tumor specimens
One – four biopsies (median 3 biopsies), approximately 5
× 5 × 5 mm in size, were used in the microarray analyses
of each tumor, minimizing confounding effects caused by
intratumor heterogeneity in gene expressions and copy
numbers [21]. The biopsies were taken from different
locations of the tumor at the time of diagnosis, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C.
All biopsies had more than 50% tumor cells in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, derived from the central
part of the specimen. Median tumor cell fraction was 70%
(range 50–90%) for both the node positive and negative
tumor groups. Total RNA was isolated by use of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) followed by double precipitation with isopropanol and final precipitation with 5
M lithium chloride [45]. Genomic DNA was isolated
according to a standard protocol, including proteinase K,
phenol, chloroform, and isoamylalcohol [46]. A separate
biopsy was fixed in neutral 4% buffered formalin and
used for immunohistochemistry.
Gene expression microarray analysis
Gene expressions were studied using array slides produced at the Microarray Facility at Health Enterprise Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, containing 15000 cDNA
clones. Labeled cDNA was synthesized from 20 μg total
RNA by anchored oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription,
using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and
Fairplay labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the presence of either Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inch., Piscataway, NJ). The labeled cDNA
of each tumor was co-hybridized with that of a reference
sample (Universal Human Reference RNA, Stratagene) to
the array slides overnight at 65°C, using an automated
hybridization station (GeneTAC, Genomic Solutions/Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA). All hybridizations were performed twice in a dye-swap design. Scanning and image
analysis were performed with an Agilent scanner (Agilent
Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and the GenePix 4.1
image analysis software (Axon Instruments Inc., Union
City, CA), respectively. Data preprosessing included correction of saturated intensities [47], filtering of weak and
bad spots, and lowess normalization. Our protocol for the
cDNA microarray experiments has revealed reliable
results in agreement with northern analyses in previous
studies on cell lines [45].

Quantitative real time PCR
For validation of the microarray data we performed qRT
PCR of four genes (HK2, KLF3, MRPS23, PDK2) in all 48
tumors and two genes (CSTA, DDOST) in twelve tumors.
Pre-designed, gene-specific TaqMan probe and primer sets
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a 7500
Sequence Detector (Perkin-Elmer) were used (Additional
file 4). Ten ng cDNA, which was synthesized from total
RNA by use of Superscript II transcriptase (Invitrogen),
was employed. Conditions for amplification were one
cycle of 95°C in 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C in
15 sec and 60°C in 1 min. The reactions were carried out
in triplicate in a 25 μl reaction volume and a 96-well plate
format. Gene expression was calculated using the deltadelta method, were the B2M gene served as an internal
control and the reference sample used in the microarray
experiments served as a calibrator [48].
Genomic microarray analysis
Gains and losses of the genes identified in the cDNA
microarray analysis were assessed using genomic array
slides produced by the Microarray Facility at Health Enterprise Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, containing 5000
unique BAC clones (RPCI-11 library, Wellcome Trust
Sanger Institute, Cambridge, UK) that covered the whole
genome with a resolution of approximately 1 Mbp. The
BAC clone localizations were obtained from Ensembl
[49]. The clone identifications corresponding to the genes
of interest are listed in Additional file 2. Forty-seven of the
48 tumors were included, for which genomic DNA was
available. One half μg of digested and ethanol-purified
DNA and normal female reference DNA were labeled by a
random primer reaction with Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inch.), respectively, and
co-hybridized to the array slides in 48 hours at 37°C by
use of an automated hybridization station (GeneTAC,
Genomic Solutions/Perkin Elmer) and our established
protocol [50]. Scanning, image analysis, and normalization were performed as described previously, using an
Agilent scanner (Agilent Technologies Inc.), the GenePix
4.1 image analysis software (Axon Instruments Inc.), and
the M-CGH data preprosessing software, respectively [50].
Gene copy number changes were determined from the
log2ratios by using a cut off value specific for each tumor,
taking into account the tumor cell fraction, the DNA
ploidy, and the empirically determined dynamics of the
experiments (Figure 2A). This procedure provides results
in agreement with fluorescence-in situ-hybridization data
[50,51]. The data were classified as gain, loss, or no
change in copy number relative to the modal DNA content.
Immunohistochemistry
Commercially available antibodies for CKS2, CSTA, HK2,
MEF2A, and MSN were used. Paraffin tissue sections of all
tumors were stained using the Dako EnVision™ + System,
Peroxidase (DAB) (K4007 and K4011, Dako Corporation,
CA) and Dakoautostainer. Monoclonal antibodies MSN
(clone 38/87, Sigma, MI), CSTA (clone WR-23/2/3/3,
Sigma), CKS2 (clone 1F7G5, Zymed Laboratories Inc.,
CA), and polyclonal antibodies HK2 (AB3279, Chemicon
International, CA) and MEF2A (C-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) were used. Detailed information on the
immunohistochemical staining has been published previously [52]. All series included positive and negative controls that gave satisfactory results. Negative controls
included substitution of the monoclonal antibody with
mouse myeloma protein of the same subclass and concentration as the monoclonal antibody and substitution of
the polyclonal primary antibody with normal rabbit IgG
of the same concentration as the polyclonal antibody.
Immunostaining was scored on a 3-tiered scale for both
intensity (absent/weak, 1; moderate, 2; strong, 3) and
extent of staining (percentage of positive tumor cells <
10%, 1; 10–50%, 2; > 50%, 3). The scoring results of
intensity and extent were multiplied to give a composite
score ranging from 1 to 9 for each tumor.
Statistical analysis
The SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) program
[53] with a false discovery rate of 10% was applied on the
log2ratios to find the genes that differed most in expression between the node positive and negative tumors. This
method does not take into account the increased information and certainty in the data achieved from dye-swap
designs with two experiments on each tumor. The analysis
was therefore performed on the raw data sets. The differentially expressed genes were selected and the average
expression ratios were calculated from the log2ratios of
the two dye-swap experiments for further use.
The data of the differentially expressed genes were
included in Cox univariate and multivariate analysis of
progression free survival, using the SPSS software. When
the variables are semi continuous, the covariate values
may be any uniform function of these. We tested three
functions for the gene expression data: the log2ratio, the
ratio, and the categorized form, and genes showing significance (p < 0.05) for one of these functions were identified
as major metastasis genes. In the analysis of categorized
data, the tumors were divided into three groups; one
group of 12 tumors with the highest expression ratios,
another group of 24 tumors with intermediate ratios, and
a third group of 12 tumors with the lowest ratios. The survival probability of the three groups were compared in
Kaplan Meier plots to ensure that there was a monotonous increase or decrease in survival among the groups.
The categorized form was chosen as approximately the
group of 12 tumors versus the others. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression data was per-

developed for this purpose [54].
