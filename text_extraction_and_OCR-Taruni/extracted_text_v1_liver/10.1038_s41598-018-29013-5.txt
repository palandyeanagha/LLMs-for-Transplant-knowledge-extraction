ionizing radiation

For the primary treatment of emergency exposure to high-dose radiation, such as in the event of a 
radiation accident, the top priority is the reconstitution and restoration of haematopoiesis. In most 
radiation accidents, drug therapy is chosen as the most suitable treatment; the chosen drug should 
already be approved domestically, stably supplied and regularly stockpiled. In the present study, a 
single administration of romiplostim (RP), an approved thrombopoietin receptor agonist, produced a 
100% survival rate in C57BL/6J mice exposed to a lethal dose (7Gy) of 137Cs γ-rays, and all irradiated 
mice survived for more than 30 days with both 3- and 5-day consecutive administrations. By day 
30, the peripheral blood cells, bone marrow cells and haematopoietic progenitor cells of the RPadministered irradiated mice had all recovered to a level that was not signifcantly diferent from that 
in non-irradiated mice. In contrast to myelosuppression, which did not fully recover until day 30, the 
expression of several bone marrow cell surface antigens recovered sooner, and DNA repair concurrently 
increased in haematopoietic cells, speeding the resolution of double strand breaks and reducing the 
rates of apoptosis. These fndings suggest that RP may be a clinic-ready countermeasure to treat victims 
of radiation accidents.
Severe acute radiation syndrome (ARS) induced by more than 3–4 Gy of radiation exposure can bring about 
immediate death due to life-threatening multiorgan failure involving the haematopoietic and gastrointestinal 
systems1,2
, and in the case of radiation accidents, many victims develop ARS and come close to dying. Te priority 
for ARS is achieving the reconstitution and restoration of haematopoiesis, as radiation-induced bone marrow 
death frequently results in infections due to a decreased number of white blood cells, bleeding due to a lack of 
platelets, and anaemia due to a dearth of red blood cells in the circulation3,4
 within 60 days afer irradiation. 
Furthermore, in cases of high-dose radiation exposure, it is necessary to treat gastrointestinal injury, which can 
induce nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and abdominal pain within 1 month afer irradiation. Bone marrow 
transplantation (BMT) and pharmacological approaches are efective and commonly used treatments for haematopoietic failure of ARS5–8
, but their medicinal applications are clearly diferent. Te use of BMT has many 
limitations involving a patient’s age, HLA type and post-therapy graf-versus-host rejection, while pharmacological approaches possess relatively few limitations and can be applied to anyone, anytime, anywhere. Tus, pharmacological approaches are ideal countermeasures for radiation emergencies and accidents and would ideally be 
conducted with commercially available and widely approved pharmaceutical drugs; the best such drug treatment 
would be a single medication.
In our previous study involving mice lethally irradiated with 7Gy of γ-rays, we successfully optimized a protocol with multiple approved drugs: romiplostim (RP), erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor (G-CSF) and nandrolone (ND; 19-nortestosterone)9
. Although the combination of EPO, G-CSF and ND 
(no RP) resulted in the survival of only 50% of the irradiated mice at day 30, the survival rate of mice treated with 
the complete RP-added protocol reached 100%. In addition to granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor

and interleukin-3, G-CSF and EPO are known to be potentially efective for accelerating the recovery of patients’ 
bone marrow, even afer exposure to lethal doses of radiation10–13. In contrast to G-CSF and EPO, however, the 
utility of RP as a potential radioprotective agent is unclear14–16.
RP is an approved TPO mimetic for the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and promotes the activation of myeloproliferative leukaemia virus proto-oncogene (c-mpl) receptors and the production 
of platelets17. ND, a pharmaceutical drug used in surgery and to treat thermal injuries, has been reported to accelerate the regeneration of the small intestinal mucosa following irradiation18. However, the addition of RP greatly 
improved the survival rate of irradiated mice with a damaged small intestine9
, suggesting that RP plays a crucial 
role in the recovery of the haematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems when administered via the optimized 
protocol.
In the present study, we focused on the efcacy of RP in the rescue of mice exposed to a lethal dose of γ-rays. 
Because a single administration of RP sufciently improved the 30-day survival rates of irradiated mice, we further optimized the protocol of single RP administration. During the 30-day post-irradiation period, we evaluated 
the radiomitigative efects of RP on the haematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems through cellular and molecular analyses.
Results
In vivo investigation of medication identifes the efectiveness of the thrombopoietin-mimetic 
c-mpl agonist RP as a countermeasure against ARS. Our previous study showed that RP was very 
important for multidrug ARS treatment9
; thus, the present study investigated the radiomitigative efect of a single 
administration of RP. Tree consecutive days of RP administration mitigated the lethal efect of a 7-Gy dose of 
γ-irradiation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Te radiomitigative efects of RP were similarly shown in 
mice with 1-day and 5-consecutive-day administration (Fig. 1B), and the drug showed partial efectiveness even 
if administered 24 hours afer irradiation (Fig. 1C). Te average post irradiation survival time of mice receiving 
24-hour-delayed RP administration was 25 days, signifcantly longer than that of untreated controls (14 days) but 
shorter than that of mice that received RP afer only a 2-hour delay. Tese results suggest that the radiomitigative 
efect of single RP administration depend on administration dosage and duration and are impaired by delay 
of initial administration; additionally, RP administration on 3 consecutive days, beginning within 2 hours afer 
irradiation, at a dosage of 50µg/kg of body weight (µg/kg) can almost completely suppress the lethal efect of 7Gy 
of radiation.
RP showed slight radiomitigative action against the lethal effect of more than 7 Gy of radiation. The 
above-mentioned RP regimen suitable for 7 Gy-irradiated mice (3 consecutive days of administration at 50 µg/kg, 
beginning 2hours afer irradiation) signifcantly lengthened the average lifetime of 8 Gy-irradiated mice to 19 days, 
compared to the 12.75 days of 8 Gy-irradiated control mice, and allowed 1 out of 8 irradiated mice to survive for 
30 days afer irradiation (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, the 7 Gy-suitable RP dose was inefective against the lethal 
efects of 9Gy and 10Gy. Te lifetime-lengthening efect of RP on 8 Gy-irradiated mice was improved by dose 
optimization (Fig. 1E). Among the administered doses of 50, 100, 200, and 500µg/kg, the highest 30-day survival 
rate and longest lifetime were shown in mice that received a dose of 100 µg/kg. Te radiomitigative efect of RP 
against the lethal efects of 8Gy irradiation seemed to increase in a dose-dependent manner from 50 to 100 µg/kg, 
but the peaked radiomitigative efect appeared to decrease in a dose-dependent manner above 200 µg/kg.
At the end of a series of investigating the radiomitigative efect of RP, we confrmed the long-term survival 
of 7 Gy-irradiated mice treated with suitable RP administration. Observation until 200 days afer irradiation 
showed that the 200-day survival of the irradiated mice with RP administration was approximately 85% (Fig. 1F). 
Side efects of RP were not shown, since all non-irradiated mice that received RP administration survived with 
no malignancy until 200 days. From these results, we decided in the present study to analyse the radiomitigative 
efects of RP in 7 Gy-irradiated mice treated with a suitable regimen for that radiation dose.
Improvement of multiple tissues by RP administration. Te body weights of the non-RP-treated irradiated mice gradually decreased across 17 days afer irradiation (Fig. 2B). By contrast, the administration of RP 
for 1, 3 or 5 consecutive days of RP administration suppressed the body weight reduction caused by irradiation 
(Fig. 2). Te efect of RP on the small intestine is shown at day 10 (Fig. 3A–C). Figure 3A shows representative 
small intestines of non-irradiated (RP-untreated) and irradiated mice without and with RP treatment at day 10. 
Regarding mice without RP treatment, the villi remained showing radiation-induced denudations and morphological alterations. However, the small intestines of the RP-treated mice regained their morphological integrity. 
While the villus length of the RP-untreated irradiated mice was signifcantly reduced by 43% of the value from 
non-irradiated controls, the villi of the RP-treated mice similar in length to those of non-irradiated controls 
(Fig. 3B). Likewise, the villi of the RP-treated irradiated mice were similar in width to those of the non-irradiated 
controls (Fig. 3C). Tese fndings indicate that RP promoted the recovery of gastrointestinal tissues damaged by 
γ-irradiation.
Te haematopoietic system was also restored with RP treatment. Independently of RP treatment, bone marrow cell counts were signifcantly decreased within 4 days afer irradiation and remained impoverished until day 
20 (Fig. 4A). Recovery from the decreased number of bone marrow cells occurred from day 20 to 30 with RP 
treatment, and bone marrow cells in irradiated mice with RP treatment reached counts that were statistically similar to those in non-irradiated mice. Regarding peripheral blood, the white blood cell, red blood cell, and platelet 
counts of the irradiated mice were all decreased by irradiation and recovered with RP treatment (Fig. 4B–D). 
However, there was a diference in the response to irradiation among peripheral blood cells: white blood cells 
behaved similarly to bone marrow cells (Fig. 4B) but decreases in red blood cell and platelet counts gradually 
progressed until at least day 20 (Fig. 4C,D). Interestingly, RP treatment markedly enhanced platelet production, 
but platelets recovered at approximately the same time as white and red blood cells and bone marrow cells. At

Figure 1. Improvement of post-radiation survival by the TPO-mimetic c-mpl agonist RP. (A) Single RP 
administration dose-dependently mitigated the lethal efect of 7Gy of γ-irradiation. Te dosages of RP were 
5, 10, 20 and 50 µg/kg of body weight (µg/kg)/day (“IR+RP” groups), and the administrations were given 
intraperitoneally for 3 consecutive days, starting immediately afer irradiation (within 2hours). Te group 
receiving no drug treatment is shown as “7Gy IR,” and the number of mice in each group was eight. Survival 
data were analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves (n=8 in all the groups). (B) Efect of administration 
length on post-radiation survival. Te period of RP administration was varied to 1, 3 and 5 consecutive days 
(IR+RP-1d, 3d and 5d,n=12–20 in each group) at identical dosage (50μg/kg of body weight/day). (C) Efect 
of administration delay. Te frst of 3 RP administrations on consecutive days was conducted 2, 24 or 48hours 
afer irradiation (RP, RP post 24h or 48h). Each dosage was fxed at 50 µg/kg/day (n=8 in each group). (D) 
Radiomitigative efects of RP were shown against large doses of γ-irradiation (7Gy+RP, 8Gy+RP, 9Gy+RP, 
and 10Gy+RP, n=8 in all the groups) compared with each radiation control. RP dosages were identical at 
50 µg/kg/day. (E) Dosage-dependent radiomitigative efect of in 8 Gy-irradiated mice. More than 50 µg/kg/day 
of RP administration (100, 200 and 500 µg/kg/day) dosage-dependently improved the survival of 8 Gyirradiated mice (n=8 in all the groups). (F) Long-term observations of RP-treated mice (50 µg/kg for 3 
consecutive days). Mice irradiated with 7Gy and treated with RP (IR+RP-3d) were kept until 200 days afer 
irradiation. “0Gy”, “RP-3d” and “7Gy IR” represented results of non-irradiated mice with or without RP 
administration and non-RP-treated irradiated mice, respectively (n=16 in each group). Asterisks in panels 
indicated signifcant diferences by the log-rank test compared with each radiation control (P<0.05).

day 30, the number of peripheral blood cells (white and red blood cells and platelets) was incompletely recovered 
in the irradiated mice, but there were no signifcant diferences between control and RP-treated irradiated mice 
(Table 1).
Moreover, we analysed the haematopoietic system in bone marrow. Haematopoietic progenitor cell counts 
(total number of CFU-GM, CFU-Mix and BFU-E) in the bone marrow of irradiated mice were insufciently 
restored by RP treatment, as were mononuclear cells, whose numbers remained almost identical (Table 1).

Te nucleated bone marrow cells in the femurs of the non-irradiated and irradiated groups with and without 
RP were classifed into 15 populations according to the cell surface antigen profles. Te representative FACS 
histograms and plots of the non-irradiated control at day 0 show how to identify the immature cell populations (Fig. 5A–D) and mature cell populations (Fig. 5E–O). Te numbers of the population enriched for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+CD34−), haematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells 
(Lin−c-kit+Sca-1+CD34+) and common myeloid progenitors (Lin−c-kit+Sca-1−CD34+) in the bone marrow 
were signifcantly lower in RP-untreated irradiated mice than in RP-untreated non-irradiated mice until day 20 
(Fig. 5A–C). RP administration did not reverse the radiation-induced reductions in the population enriched for 
haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, haematopoietic multipotent progenitor cells, and common myeloid 
progenitors to restore the levels seen in in RP-untreated irradiated mice. Regarding common lymphoid progenitors (Lin−c-kit−Sca-1+CD34+), similar levels were found between RP-untreated irradiated and RP-treated irradiated mice, and there were no signifcant diferences on day 20 (Fig. 5D). Te fndings for myeloid and lymphoid 
cells are shown in Fig. 5E–O. Te mature myeloid and lymphoid cells were relatively recovered, in contrast to the 
immature haematopoietic cells. Te numbers of macrophages, granulocytes, erythroid progenitors and dendritic 
cells in the bone marrow were signifcantly recovered in RP-treated irradiated mice compared to RP-untreated 
irradiated mice until day 20 afer γ-irradiation (Fig. 5E–H). Although the numbers of B cells, immature T cells 
and helper T cells did not recover following treatment (Fig. 5I–K,M,O), signifcant recovery was observed for 
NK cells and killer T cells on a comparison between RP-treated irradiated and RP-untreated irradiated mice 
(Fig. 5L,N).
RP administration improves DNA repair response and reduces apoptotic signals. To evaluate the efect of RP administration on repair of DNA damage, we analysed the foci of γ-H2AX, one of DNA 
double strand break markers19,20, and 53BP1, one of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factors21–23, in 
bone marrow mononuclear cells of irradiated mice at days 0, 1, 4 and 14, and a representative image for day 1 
is shown (Figure 6). γ-H2AX foci were increased 1 day afer irradiation and gradually decreased until day 14, 
but RP administration signifcantly suppressed the number of γ-H2AX foci at day 1 (Fig. 6A,C). By contrast, 
radiation-induced 53BP1 foci appeared at day 1 but were signifcantly increased by RP treatment (Fig. 6B,C). Te 
increase in 53BP1 foci indicated the possibility that the NHEJ pathway was promoted by RP; thus, we analysed 
the rate of early apoptotic cells among bone marrow mononuclear cells by detecting cytokeratin 18 foci (Fig. 7). 
Specifc antibodies against cytokeratin 18 is used for determination of early apoptotic events in cells and/or tissues 
by detection of specifc cytokeratin 18 fragments containing the aspartic acid residue 396 neo-epitope, which is 
exposed afer cleavage of cytokeratin 18 by caspases. Cleavage at this position is carried by caspase-9 early in 
apoptosis and by caspase-3 and caspase-7 during the execution phase24,25. Cytokeratin 18+/early apoptotic cells 
populations were signifcantly increased by irradiation on days 1 and 14 (Fig. 7A,B). Radiogenic apoptosis was 
signifcantly suppressed by RP treatment. Tese results showed that RP administration promoted a DNA repair 
pathway and suppressed apoptosis.
Discussion
Te present study demonstrated that RP, an ITP therapeutic drug, achieved the complete rescue of mice exposed 
to lethal γ-irradiation (Fig. 1). A series of analyses of the haematopoietic parameters indicated that RP enhanced 
the recoveries of several haematopoietic cells by day 30 post-irradiation (Fig. 2,4,5). In addition, RP treatment for 
3 days afer irradiation improved intestinal integrity and morphology, indicating the restoration of the intestinal 
mucosa (Fig. 3). Furthermore, at one day afer irradiation, DNA double-strand breakage was found to be signifcantly suppressed afer RP treatment, and a signifcant increase in DNA repair was seen in the nuclei of bone marrow cells, suggesting that RP treatment reduced the apoptosis response of haematopoietic cells nearly to control 
values (Fig. 6, 7). In the present study, it was shown that the optimum dose of RP was 50 μg/kg of body weight/
day (Fig. 1A), which is 50-fold higher than the clinically used dose (1μg/kg of body weight/day) but within the 
range showing no toxicity26. Moreover, in our preliminary trials using X-rays to overcome mortality due to 8Gy 
of irradiation, mice that received 50µg/kg of RP twice per day (12-hour intervals) for 3 consecutive days achieved 
a 100% 30-day survival rate (data not shown). Terefore, the present fndings suggest that RP may be a very useful 
radiomitigative drug for the emergency treatment of victims exposed to high doses of radiation and may be especially efective in case of radiation accidents.
Te TPO receptor c-mpl is constantly expressed on the surface of haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells27 and not 
only promotes megakaryocytic diferentiation but also regulates their self-renewal activity and pluripotency28,29. Tis 
receptor is classifed as a cytokine receptor class I and induces receptor dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation, 
as well as a series of signalling events, including the activation of Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator 
of transcription, Shc/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt15,30, which plays a 
critical role in the signalling of a wide array of cytokines and growth factors leading to various cellular functions, including cell survival, proliferation, growth, haematopoiesis and the immune response31,32. De Lavel et al. reported that 
TPO-increased DNA-dependent protein kinase-dependent DNA repair limits haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell 
cells (CD4−CD8a+) (L). B cells (CD45R/B220+NK1.1−) (M), NK cells (NK1.1+) (N) and B/NK cells (O) were 
isolated from non-T lineage cells. Te dotted line in each fgure shows the value for RP-untreated non-irradiated 
mice. Te data are expressed as the means±SD (n=12–30 used in each group). Statistical signifcance was 
determined by a comparison among (a) the non-irradiated groups with and without RP, (b) the irradiated 
groups with and without RP, (c) the non-irradiated and irradiated groups, and (d) the RP-treated groups with 
and without irradiation (P<0.05).

mutagenesis in response to DNA damage33, and TPO was recently shown to promote NHEJ DNA repair in haematopoietic stem cells through the specifc activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-kB) pathways and their target, LEX-134,35. In addition, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, such as TPO and eltrombopag, protect against cell death/apoptosis in cardiac myocytes via the down-regulation of caspase-3 activity, which is 
downstream of JAK/Src tyrosine kinase36, and Tronik-Le et al. reported the frst demonstration of efcacy of a single 
injection of TPO shortly afer in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation for reducing HSC injury and improving functional 
outcomes37. TPO has been shown to exhibit important selective DNA repair promoting activity for NHEJ but not 
homologous recombination. In addition, a few previous reports have shown that TPO and TPO receptor agonists act 
as radioprotective/mitigative agents14–16, and RP was recently approved as a second-generation thrombopoietin agonist38. In the present study, RP treatment signifcantly suppressed DNA double-strand breakage and increased DNA 
repair in bone marrow cells (Fig. 6), and RP suppressed the accumulation of cytokeratin 18 fragments via cleavage by 
caspase (Fig. 7), indicating that the RP signal might attenuate the radiation-induced DNA damage, restore the genomic 
integrity of haematopoietic cells, and suppress the rate of cellular apoptosis. Tese mechanisms may have resulted in a 
signifcant improvement in the 30-day survival rate and the recovery of several haematopoietic parameters (Figs 1–5). 
However, in order to clarify the details of the mechanisms underlying the increased survival, further studies are needed, 
such as determining the roles of other important haematopoietic organs, the spleen39, and the lung40; the roles of secondary internal signalling mechanisms, such as extracellular vesicles41; and the therapeutic efects of mesenchymal 
stromal/stem cells42 induced by RP administration, as the survival of an individual exposed to lethal ionizing radiation 
depends not only on the cell populations and DNA repair in bone marrow cells but also on various factors in various 
other organs. Additional investigations are currently underway to clarify how the RP-treated mice were able to escape 
radiation-induced early death immediately afer irradiation.

Te present study shows that RP leads to the complete rescue of mice exposed to lethal ionizing radiation, with 
improvement in several haematopoietic parameters and the histological appearance of the intestine. In addition, 
RP treatment attenuated the radiation-induced DNA damage in nuclei of haematopoietic cells and improved 
DNA repair, which reduced the rate of apoptotic haematopoietic cells, suggesting that RP may act as a triggered 
physiological regulator in exposed individuals. Tese fndings suggest that RP may be useful as a clinic-ready 
countermeasure for radiation accidents.
Materials and Methods
Exposure of mice to a lethal dose of γ-irradiation. Female C57BL/6 J Jcl mice were delivered at 7 
weeks of age from the breeding facilities of Clea Japan (Tokyo, Japan). At 8 weeks of age, the mice were subjected to varying lethal total-body irradiation doses of 7–10 Gy of 137Cs γ-rays at a dose rate of 0.9 Gy/min or 
7 Gy of X-rays (150 kVp, 20 mA, 0.5 mm aluminium and 0.3 mm copper flters) at a dose rate of 1.0 Gy/min 
using an X-ray generator (MBR-1520R; Hitachi Medical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Te mice were then administered the 
medications described below. All of the mice were housed in standard cages in a temperature-controlled room 
under a 12-h/12-h light/dark cycle in a specifc-pathogen-free environment at the Institute for Environmental 
Sciences. Tey were provided with sterilized standard laboratory mouse chow diet and drinking water at libitum. 
All experiments were conducted according to legal regulations in place in Japan and the Guidelines for Animal 
Experiments of the Institute for Environmental Sciences and Hirosaki University afer approval by the animal 
experimental committees of both organizations. In the present study, select criteria were applied prior to sacrifce, 
e.g., more than 20% loss of body weight, respiratory distress, etc.
Treatment with the human thrombopoietin-mimetic c-mpl agonist RP. Te irradiated mice were 
administered the human thrombopoietin-mimetic c-mpl agonist RP (Romiplate®; Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Co., Ltd., 
Tokyo, Japan) within 2 h afer γ-irradiation. Similarly, the non-irradiated mice were also administered RP and 
used as controls. RP was administered intraperitoneally, and the doses were determined based on the fndings 
of previous reports9,13,15,16. Te applied dose of RP used in the present study ranged from 5 to 500 µg/kg/day for 
1, 3 or 5 days within 2h following exposure to γ-irradiation. Te treated mice were maintained until day 30 and 
weighed every week. Until day 30, the numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets in the peripheral 
blood of the surviving mice were counted using Celltac-α (NIHON KOHDEN, Tokyo, Japan). Te surviving mice 
were anaesthetized with isofurane, a widely used inhalation anaesthetic (Powerful Isoful®; Zoetis, London, UK), 
and sacrifced. Total nucleated bone marrow cells in the femurs of the non-irradiated and irradiated groups with 
or without RP were counted using Burker-Turk solution (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).
Figure 7. Apoptotic response in the bone marrow cells from the femurs of surviving mice. (A) Nucleated bone 
marrow cells from the femurs of non-irradiated and irradiated groups with or without RP were collected at days 
0, 1, 4 and 14, and the cells were tested for apoptosis. (B) A representative image from day 1 was shown. Te 
data are expressed as the means±SD (n=3 independent experiments). Statistical signifcance was determined 
between RP-untreated and RP-treated irradiated mice (*P<0.05).

Profling the cell diferentiation of bone marrow cells using fuorescence-activated cell sorting 
(FACS). Cell diferentiation profles of bone marrow cells were analysed using FACSAria (Becton Dickinson, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Te bone marrow cells harvested from the mice were treated with Pharm Lyse bufer 
(Becton Dickinson). Afer removal of the lysed red cells, 2.5× 105
 cells of the bone marrow cell suspension 
were stained with fuorescence-labelled CD11b, CD34, Sca1, c-kit, CD25 and a lineage cocktail involving biotin 
conjugated-CD8a, CD45R/B220, CD4, Ly6G (Gr-1), TER119, CD11c and NK1.1. Next, 2.5×105
 cells obtained 
from the identical suspension were stained with fuorescence-labelled CD8a, CD45R/B220, CD4, Ly6G (Gr1), TER119, CD11c and NK1.1. Following staining with 7AAD, we gated the 7AAD–viable cell population and 
counted the number of Lin–c-kit+Sca-1+CD34– (population enriched for haematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cells), Lin–c-kit+Sca-1+CD34+ (multipotent progenitor), Lin–c-kit+Sca-1–CD34+ (common myeloid progenitor), Lin–c-kit–Sca-1+CD34+ (common lymphoid progenitor), CD11b+ (macrophages), Gr-1+ (granulocytes), 
TER119+ (erythroid progenitor), CD4+CD8a+ (immature T cells), CD4+CD8a– (helper T cells), CD4–CD8a+
(killer T cells), CD25+ (pro- and pre-B cells), CD45R/B220+NK1.1– (B cells) and NK1.1+ (NK cells) populations. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse Sca-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs),

biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD45R/B220 mAbs, biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 mAbs, biotin-conjugated 
anti-mouse CD8a mAbs, and biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD8b mAbs were purchased from BioLegend (San 
Diego, CA, USA). PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD34 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, 
TX, USA).
Methylcellulose culture. Colony-forming cells (CFCs), including colony-forming unit-granulocyte/
macrophage (CFU-GM), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming unit-granulocyte/erythroid/macrophage/megakaryocyte (CFU-Mix) cells, were assayed by the methylcellulose method as described 
previously9
.
Histological analyses. At day 10 afer γ-irradiation or RP treatment, the duodenum tissue was excised 
from the small intestine at 4 cm below the pyloric junction, flushed with calcium- and magnesium-free 
phosphate-bufered saline (PBS [−]; Sigma-Aldrich, Stockholm, Sweden), and fxed in 10% formalin overnight. 
Sections of duodenum tissues (approximately 1 cm in thickness) were embedded in parafn. Ten, 4 μm-thick 
sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and observed under 20× magnifcation using an 
inverted microscope. Te villus height was determined by measuring the distance from the villus-crypt junction 
to the villus tip, and the villus width was determined by the distance of the villus-crypt junction. Under blinded 
conditions, the villus length and width were measured for at least 10 villi in every sample.
Immunofuorescent detection of γ-H2AX, 53BP1. Te bone marrow cells were collected at days 0, 
1, 4, and 14, washed with PBS (−), and fxed with ice-cold 75% ethanol for 10min at room temperature. Fixed 
cells were washed with PBS (−), permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) on ice for 5min, and 
washed twice with PBS (−). Te cells were then incubated with an anti-phospho-histone H2AX (ser139) monoclonal antibody and anti-53BP1 monoclonal antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) diluted 1:300-fold with 
20mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 137mM NaCl, 0.1% TWEEN-20 (TBST) containing 5% skim milk at 37°C for 120min, 
and subsequently washed with PBS (−) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgM (μ chain) antibody diluted 1:400-fold with TBST containing 
5% skim milk at 37 °C for 60min. Following a second wash with PBS (−), the cells were adhered to microscope 
glass slides (Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) using a StatSpin® CytoFuge 2 (Iris Sample Processing, Inc., 
Westwood, MA, USA) and mounted using Vectashield® Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, 
Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). For the quantitative analysis, the γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci were counted per cell 
using an LSM 710 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a Z-stack function that scans by changing the depth for thick samples and storing the data as layers. Under blinded conditions, 
the number of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci per cell was counted for more than 50 cells in every sample.
Detection of apoptosis. Te extent of apoptosis was determined by M30 CytoDEATH antibody (Roche 
Life Science, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (H + L) FITC conjugate (Millipore) 
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Te bone marrow cells were collected at days 0, 1, 4 and 14; washed 
with PBS (−); and fxed with ice-cold pure methanol for 30min at −20 °C. Fixed cells were washed with washing 
bufer (PBS [−] containing 0.1% TWEEN-20) twice and then incubated with M30 CytoDEATH antibody diluted 
1:50 with incubation bufer (PBS [−] containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% TWEENs-20) for 60 min 
at 20 °C. Tese cells were subsequently washed with PBS (−) twice and incubated with anti-mouse IgG-FITC 
antibody diluted 100-fold with incubation bufer for 30 min at 20 °C. Following a second wash with PBS (−), 
the cells were adhered to microscope glass slides using a StatSpin® CytoFuge 2 and mounted using Vectashield® Mounting Medium with DAPI. Photographs of the cells were taken with an LSM 710 laser scanning microscope. 
In addition, a quantitative analysis was performed using a fow cytometer (Cytomics FC500; Beckman-Coulter, 
Fullerton, CA, USA).

Statistical analyses. Te statistical signifcance of diferences among multiple groups was assessed using 
the Steel-Dwass test. Data from survival studies data were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method followed by 
the Mantel-Cox (log-rank) test for the assessment of signifcant diferences. Te levels of signifcance were calculated using the sofware program Excel 2007 (Microsof, Redmond, WA, USA) with the Statcel 3 add-on (OMS, 
Saitama, Japan). A P value of less than 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical signifcance.
