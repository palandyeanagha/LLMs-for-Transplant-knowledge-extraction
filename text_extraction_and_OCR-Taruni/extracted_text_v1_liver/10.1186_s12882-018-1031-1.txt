Abstract
Background: Conversion from calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy to a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
inhibitor following kidney transplantation may help to preserve graft function. Data are sparse, however, concerning
the impact of conversion on posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) or the progression of pre-existing diabetes.
Methods: PTDM and other diabetes-related parameters were assessed post hoc in two large open-label multicenter
trials. Kidney transplant recipients were randomized (i) at month 4.5 to switch to everolimus or remain on a
standard cyclosporine (CsA)-based regimen (ZEUS, n = 300), or (ii) at month 3 to switch to everolimus, remain
on standard CNI therapy or convert to everolimus with reduced-exposure CsA (HERAKLES, n = 497).
Results: There were no significant differences in the incidence of PTDM between treatment groups (log rank p = 0.97
[ZEUS], p = 0.90 [HERAKLES]). The mean change in random blood glucose from randomization to month 12
was also similar between treatment groups in both trials for patients with or without PTDM, and with or without
pre-existing diabetes. The change in eGFR from randomization to month 12 showed a benefit for everolimus
versus comparator groups in all subpopulations, but only reached significance in larger subgroups (no PTDM
or no pre-existing diabetes).
Conclusions: Within the restrictions of this post hoc analysis, including non-standardized diagnostic criteria and
limited glycemia laboratory parameters, these data do not indicate any difference in the incidence or severity of
PTDM with early conversion from a CsA-based regimen to everolimus, or in the progression of pre-existing
diabetes.

Background
Diabetic nephropathy is now the most frequent indication for kidney transplantation, accounting for approximately a third of kidney transplants in the US [1], and
is set to grow in frequency as the prevalence of diabetes
continues to grow [2, 3]. Additionally, under conventional
immunosuppressive regimens, up to 20% of kidney transplant recipients develop posttransplant diabetes mellitus
(PTDM) [4–6]. Both pre-existing diabetes [7, 8] and
PTDM [9] are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events [9, 10] and inferior long-term survival, as
well as morbidity from diabetes-related complications [7,
11]. The diabetogenic effect of calcineurin inhibitors
(CNIs), particularly tacrolimus [4, 12] and steroids [5], can
be compounded by maintenance steroid therapy, especially pulsed steroid therapy for the treatment of rejection
[13]. In this unfavorable context, novel immunosuppressive regimens must be carefully evaluated in terms of their
diabetogenic potential.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor agents sirolimus and everolimus have been widely
assessed within a variety of regimens for de novo or delayed initiation following kidney transplantation [14].
mTOR inhibitors offer the potential for CNI sparing,
which might be expected to lower the risk for PTDM
[15]. However, results from the early era of sirolimus
therapy in kidney transplantation raised concerns that the
class may have an inherent diabetogenic effect [16, 17]. In
a large randomized trial of sirolimus published in 2006,
Vitko et al. reported an increased rate of PTDM in patients randomized to a loading dose (6 mg) and a fixed
dose of 2 mg/day versus mycophenolate mofetil when
both were administered in combination with standarddose tacrolimus and steroids [18]. Although smaller
trials using fixed sirolimus dosing [19, 20] or high sirolimus exposure targets [21] did not demonstrate any
effect, an analysis of United States Renal Data System data
from over 20,000 patients undergoing kidney transplantation during 1995–2003 concluded that patients treated
with sirolimus were at increased risk of PTDM whether administered in combination with a CNI or an antimetabolite
[22]. In contrast, a large meta-analysis published in 2006
found that use of mTOR inhibitors was not associated with
any increased risk of developing insulin-treated PTDM
compared to antimetabolite therapy [23].
As experience with mTOR inhibitors has grown, fixed
dosing has been replaced by progressively lower trough
concentration targets, and concomitant CNI exposure
has been reduced [14]. Loading doses for sirolimus have
typically become smaller, and no loading dose is required
for everolimus due to its shorter half-life. In large, randomized trials undertaken recently, no increase in the rate
of PTDM was observed in the sirolimus [24, 25] or everolimus [26, 27] treatment arms.
Conversion to an mTOR inhibitor from CNI therapy
after the first 3–12 months post-transplant is an appealing
immunosuppressive strategy, harnessing the potent immunosuppressive effect of CNIs during the period of highest risk for rejection but taking advantage of the reduced
nephrotoxicity associated with mTOR inhibitors [28]. To
date, no analyses are available concerning the impact of
conversion to an mTOR inhibitor on PTDM or the
progression of pre-existing diabetes. We report here a post
hoc analysis of diabetic parameters in two large, multicenter trials (ZEUS [29] and HERAKLES [30]) in which de
novo kidney transplant recipients were randomized to
either convert to everolimus in a CNI-free regimen or to
remain on a standard cyclosporine (CsA)-based regimen,
or in one study to alternatively switch to everolimus with
reduced-exposure CsA.
Methods
Study design and conduct
This was a post hoc analysis of data from two 12-month,
prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized trials of
de novo kidney transplant recipients (ZEUS [29] and
HERAKLES [30]).The objective of the analysis was to
compare the incidence and severity of PTDM, and
progression of pre-existing diabetes, to month 12
post-transplant in patients receiving everolimus-based
CNI-free maintenance immunosuppression versus
those who continued to receive a standard CsA-based
regimen or everolimus with reduced-exposure CsA. In
both studies, patients received standard-exposure CsA
with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS)
and steroids from time of transplant, and were randomized to continue the CsA-based regimen or convert to
everolimus at 4.5 months (ZEUS) [29] or 3 months
(HERAKLES) [30] post-transplant. In one of the studies
(HERAKLES), there was a third treatment arm in which
patients received reduced-exposure CsA with everolimus targeting a lower exposure range.
Patients
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in the two studies
were identical other than a lower maximum age for
recipients and donors in the ZEUS study (65 years)
versus the HERAKLES study (70 years). The minimum
recipient and donor ages were 18 and 5 years, respectively,
in both studies. Key exclusion criteria at time of study
entry were more than one previous kidney transplant, loss
of a previous graft due to immunological reasons, multiorgan transplantation, donation after cardiac death, and
previous or current panel reactive antibodies > 25%. At
the time of randomization, additional exclusion criteria
were graft loss, severe (Banff grade ≥ III), recurrent or
steroid-resistant rejection prior to randomization, proteinuria > 1 g/day and dialysis dependency. In both studies,
Sommerer et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:237 Page 2 of 13

patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that in
the opinion of the investigator would interfere with
the appropriate conduct of the study were excluded.
A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is shown
in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Immunosuppression
All patients received induction with basiliximab (Simulect®,
Novartis Pharma, Nürnberg, Germany). CsA (Sandimmun
Optoral®, Novartis Pharma, Germany) was administered to
all patients, with a target trough concentration in both
studies of 150–220 ng/mL from the time of transplant to
randomization. All patients received EC-MPS 1440 mg/day
(myfortic®, Novartis Pharma, Germany), and steroids administered according to local practice from the time of
transplant to month 12.
For patients in the standard-CsA arms, CsA target
trough concentrations after randomization were 120–
180 ng/mL to month 6, and 100–150 ng/mL thereafter;
EC-MPS was continued to month 12. In the CNI-free
everolimus arms of both studies, everolimus was initiated at a dose of 1.5 mg then adjusted to target a trough
concentration of 5–10 ng/mL, and EC-MPS was continued to month 12. In the ZEUS study, conversion from
CsA to everolimus took place stepwise over a period of
up to four weeks starting at month 4.5. In the HERAKLES study, conversion took place at month 3 and was
completed within 24 h. In the patients randomized to
everolimus with reduced-exposure CsA in the HERAKLES study, EC-MPS was discontinued and everolimus
was started on the day of randomization with CsA dose
unchanged, then on the following day CsA dose was adjusted to target 50–75 ng/mL thereafter. In this group,
the everolimus target range was 3–8 ng/mL.
Evaluation
This post hoc analysis compared the following outcomes between treatment groups up to month 12
post-transplant within the ZEUS and HERAKLES trials:
the incidence of PTDM; requirement for hypoglycemic
therapy (insulin or non-insulin); change in random blood
glucose; estimated GFR (eGFR) at month 12 and the
change in eGFR from randomization to month 12. Other
than eGFR at month 12, none of these endpoints were
pre-specified in the study protocols. Data were analyzed
according to whether patients did or did not have
pre-existing diabetes and subsequently did or did not develop PTDM. PTDM was defined as diabetes reported by
the investigator as an adverse event at any point after
transplantation in a patient not categorized as diabetic at
baseline (i.e. at time of transplant). Patients were categorized as diabetic if diabetes was listed in the medical history by the investigator at the time of study entry. There
were no pre-specified laboratory criteria for PTDM or
pre-existing diabetes. Data on the use of insulin or other
antidiabetic therapies were obtained via standard reporting procedures for concomitant medication at each study
visit. If treatment with such drugs was started, investigators were required to document any adverse events, as per
Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Both trials were fully
monitored by an external medical monitor.
Blood glucose was measured at routine visits and are
random values.
Biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) was graded
according to Banff criteria [31].
The primary efficacy endpoint of the ZEUS study was
the adjusted eGFR estimated by the Nankivell formula
(eGFR, [32]) at month 12. The primary efficacy endpoint
in the HERAKLES study was change in eGFR (Nankivell
formula) from randomization (month 3) to month 12.
Statistical analysis
All analyses are reported for the safety populations,
comprising all patients who received at least one dose
of study drug after study entry. Data on the incidence
of PTDM across both studies in patients randomized to
everolimus-based CNI-free therapy or standard CsAbased therapy were pooled.
Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was
applied for missing 12-month values for immunosuppression drug doses, drug concentrations, and eGFR.
Continuous variables (e.g. drug dose, drug exposure)
were compared between groups using the two-sample
Wilcoxon rank-sum test of the F-test. The incidence of
categorical events in each study and in the pooled analysis was compared between groups using Fisher’s test.
Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to events were compared between groups using the log rank test. The
change in eGFR from randomization to month 12 was
analyzed by an ANCOVA model with treatment, center,
donor type as factors and eGFR value at randomization
as covariate.
All tests were two-sided. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Patient population and risk factors for diabetes
In total, 300 patients in the ZEUS study and 497patients
in the HERAKLES study were included in the current
analysis. Patients were categorized according to whether
they developed PTDM or whether they had pre-existing
diabetes (Fig. 1).
In both studies, demographic factors, body mass index
(BMI), hepatitis C (HCV) status and baseline random
blood glucose concentration, generally showed no
marked differences between the treatment arms among
patients with PTDM, no PTDM or pre-existing diabetes
(Table 1). There were significant differences between the
Sommerer et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:237 Page 3 of 13

everolimus and CsA cohorts of ZEUS for recipient age
among patients with pre-existing diabetes, and for BMI
at time of transplant in patients without PTDM and
without pre-existing diabetes (Table 1). Almost all patients in both studies were white (97.5% [268/275] in
ZEUS, 93.6% [409/437] in HERAKLES).
Immunosuppression
CsA exposure was comparable between treatment groups
at randomization in both trials (Table 2). Oral steroid doses
were generally slightly higher after randomization in the
everolimus-based CNI-free groups than in CsA-containing
regimens within the subpopulations of both trials, with
the difference reaching significance in the ‘no PTDM’
and ‘no pre-existing diabetes’ groups of ZEUS (Table 2).
Use of intravenous steroids to treat rejection before or
after randomization was similar between treatment
group arms prior to randomization in both trials, and
any observed percentage differences within the PTDM
and pre-existing diabetes cohorts arose from very small
absolute numbers.
Post-transplant diabetes mellitus
In the ZEUS study, PTDM was present at randomization
(i.e. month 4.5 post-transplant) in 9.2% (13/142)
everolimus-treated patients and 5.3% (7/133) of CsA-treated
patients; corresponding values at month 12 were 9.9% (14/
142) and 6.0% (8/133). In the HERAKLES trial, the incidence of PTDM was 4.6% (7/152), 6.3% (9/142) and 4.2%
(6/143) at randomization (i.e. month 3 post-transplant) in
the everolimus, CsA and everolimus/reduced CsA groups,
respectively, compared to 6.6% (10/152), 7.8% (11/142)
and 6.3% (9/143) at month 12. Thus, after randomization,
there were only a total of two new cases of PTDM in the
ZEUS study and eight new cases in the HERAKLES trial,
distributed equally across treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier
estimates showed that there were no significant differences in the incidence of PTDM between treatment
groups in either trial (Fig. 2).
When data from both studies were pooled, the incidence of PTDM at month 12 among patients without
pre-existing diabetes was 8.2% (24/294) in patients randomized to everolimus without CNI therapy, compared
to 6.9% (19/275) in those randomized to standard CsA
therapy (p = 0.64).
The use of antihyperglycemic therapy was similar
between groups for patients with PTDM (everolimus
13/14 [11 insulin, 9 non-insulin therapies] patients,
CsA 6/8 [6 insulin, 2 non-insulin therapies] patients) in
the ZEUS study, and in the HERAKLES study (everolimus
9/10 [5 insulin, 6 non-insulin therapies], CsA 10/11 [7
insulin, 6 non-insulin therapies], everolimus/reduced CsA
9/9 [8 insulin, 6 non-insulin therapies]).
Pre-existing diabetes
At time of transplant, pre-existing diabetes was present
in 8.4% and 8.3% of the everolimus-treated and
CsA-treated patients in the ZEUS trial, and in 11.1%,
13.9% and 11.2% of the patients randomized to everolimus, CsA or everolimus/reduced CsA in the HERAKLES

study, respectively. There was no apparent difference in
progression of random glucose concentrations between
the two treatment groups to month 12 for patients with
pre-existing diabetes (Fig. 3). From randomization to
month 12, the mean (SD) change in random glucose concentration was 1.1 (3.4) mmol/L versus 1.5 (4.5)mmol/L in
the everolimus versus CsA groups in the ZEUS study (p =
0.52). In the HERAKLES study, the mean (SD) change
was 2.2 (3.0) mmol/L, 0.5 (4.9) mmol/L and − 0.2 (3.7)
mmol/L in the everolimus, CsA and everolimus/reduced
CsA arms, respectively (p = 0.24).
Among patients with pre-existing diabetes, use of
antihyperglycemic therapy was similar between groups
in the ZEUS trial (everolimus 12/13 patients [12 insulin, 3 non-insulin therapies], CsA 12/12 [12 insulin, 4
non-insulin therapies]) and the HERAKLES trial (everolimus 16/19 [16 insulin, 3 non-insulin], CsA 22/23 [20 insulin, 9 non-insulin], everolimus/reduced CsA17/18 [17
insulin, 6 non-insulin]).
Blood glucose concentrations
The mean (SD) change in random blood glucose from
randomization to month 12 among patients with
PTDM was similar in the everolimus group versus the
CsA group for the ZEUS study (p = 0.10) and the
HERAKLES study (p = 0.38). Mean random blood glucose levels also remained similar between treatment
groups in both trials for patients who did not develop
PTDM (Fig. 3). As expected, patients with PTDM
clearly had higher glucose values compared to patients
without PTDM (Fig. 3).
Biopsy-proven acute rejection
The higher rate of mild BPAR (Grade I) in the overall
ZEUS study population was reflected in the cohorts
without PTDM or pre-existing diabetes (Additional file
1: Table S2). In the HERAKLES study, there were no
significant differences in the incidence of BPAR between
treatment groups in any subpopulation (Additional file 1:
Table S2).
Renal function
The change in eGFR from randomization to month 12
was significantly in favor of everolimus in the two largest
subpopulations (no PTDM and no pre-existing diabetes)
for both trials (Table 3). In the subpopulations with
PTDM or pre-existing diabetes, the differences between
groups were of a similar order of magnitude to those
seen in the larger subpopulations, but in these small cohorts statistical significance was not reached.
Discussion
Results from this post hoc analysis of two large randomized studies do not suggest any difference in the incidence or severity of PTDM in patients who were
converted early post-transplant from a CsA-based regimen to everolimus, or in the progression of pre-existing
diabetes. Kaplan-Meier estimates showed comparable
rates of PTDM in the different treatment cohorts after
randomization in both studies to month 12, with similar
patterns of random blood glucose concentration over
time in the subpopulations with or without PTDM or
pre-existing diabetes. The number of patients who developed PTDM after randomization was identical in the
everolimus group or the standard CsA group, but absolute
numbers were very low, even within this large pooled cohort, so firm conclusions cannot be drawn.
The progressive renal deterioration which is frequently
associated with diabetes in the general population has
also been documented in patients with PTDM [33, 34],
so any potential benefit for preservation of renal function may be particularly relevant in this subpopulation.
Here, the change in eGFR from randomization to month
12 in patients receiving everolimus within a CNI-free

regimen which was achieved in the overall study populations at month 12 [29, 30] was also observed in the
subpopulation of patients with PTDM, although the
small numbers of patients precluded any statistical
differences. Mean eGFR in patients randomized to
CNI-free therapy with everolimus in patients with
PTDM improved by 14 mL/min/1.73m2 in the ZEUS
study and by 4.9 mL/min/1.73m2 in HERAKLES by
month 12. Among patients with pre-existing diabetes,
there was a numerically greater improvement in renal
function from randomization to month 12 in the CNI-free
cohorts of both trials versus the comparator groups.
Certain aspects of the analysis should be taken into
account. First, PTDM was included from the time of

transplant, with few events in either group after
randomization, and the onset of PTDM was collected by
standard adverse event reporting, with no pre-specified
criteria. In the DIRECT study [4], in which data on HbA1c,
insulin level and oral glucose tolerance testing were collected prospectively to month 6 in patients receiving a
standard CsA-based regimen, the incidence of treated
PTDM was 7.4% but a further 7.4% had untreated PTDM
based on American Diabetes Association criteria (14.8%
overall) [35]. Based on the 6.8–8.0% incidence of PTDM
reported by 12 months in the current studies, it is likely
that the standard reporting adverse event techniques did
not capture all cases of PTDM. However, since it seems
reasonable to assume that centers applied the same procedures for monitoring and defining PTDM regardless of
patients’ immunosuppressive treatment, it is unlikely that
this will have biased diagnosis rates between treatment
arms. Second, oral glucose tolerance tests were not recorded and HbA1c levels were not measured, with the
only available laboratory test being random blood glucose
levels. This is a weakness of the analysis. The presence of
hyperglycemia could be recorded as an adverse event by
investigators, but no strict reporting checks for this value
were in place, hence reporting of hyperglycemia is not
fully reliable. Information on antidiabetic therapy was captured by standard documentation of concomitant medication, and may have been incomplete despite the strict
external monitoring. Third, the analysis does not address
the relative diabetogenic effect of everolimus and CsA
during the very early post-transplant period (up to month
3), when the rate of onset of glucose metabolism disturbances, hyperglycemia and onset of PTDM can be highest
[4, 36]. Fourth, the results presented here apply only to
conversion from CsA (not tacrolimus) to everolimus after
the initial weeks post-transplant. Tacrolimus, now the
dominant CNI, is widely regarded to be more diabetogenic than CsA [37, 38]. Fifth, the studies were not
powered to detect differences within subpopulations for
the primary endpoint (eGFR at month 12) or to detect
differences in any of the endpoints which were specified
post hoc. Indeed, even with this large pooled dataset,
the number of patients who developed PTDM after
randomization was very small, restricting interpretation.
Lastly, the follow-up period (a maximum of nine months
after randomization) was too short to assess any long-term
effect of CNI administration on late-onset PTDM or progression of pre-existing diabetes.
Conclusions
Within the limitations of this post hoc analysis, including
an absence of pre-specified diagnostic criteria for PTDM or
extensive laboratory data, conversion from a CsA-based
regimen to everolimus in combination with mycophenolic
acid and steroids within the first six months after kidney
transplantation does not appear to affect the subsequent risk of developing PTDM, or adversely affect the
progression of pre-existing diabetes. This finding from
the subgroup analysis adds to the observed benefit on
renal function after switching to everolimus-based therapy with CNI-withdrawal seen from the main study
analyses.
