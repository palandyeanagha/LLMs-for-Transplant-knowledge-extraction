Abstract In the schedule for the evaluation of individual
quality of life (SEIQoL) the weights for five individualized
quality of life domains have been derived by judgment
analysis and direct weighting (DW). We studied the feasibility and validity of adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA) as
an alternative method to derive weights in 27 cancer
patients and 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Further,
we assessed the convergence between direct weights and
weights derived by ACA, and their correlation with global
quality-of-life scores. All respondents finished the ACA
task, but one in five respondents were upset about the ACA
task. Further, the task was vulnerable to judgment ‘errors’,
such as inconsistent answers. The agreement between the
two weights was low. Both weighted index scores were
strongly correlated to the unweighted index score. The
relationships between the index score and scores on a
visual analogue scale for global individual quality of life
and global quality of life were similar whether or not the
index score was calculated with DW weights, with ACA
weights, or without using weights. We conclude that,
because weights did not improve the correlation between
the index score and global quality of life scores, it seems
sufficient to use the unweighted index score as a measure
for global individual quality of life.

Introduction
Quality of life (QoL) instruments have traditionally been
based on a needs model of QoL, with the same domains,
assessment criteria, and weighting applied to all respondents [1]. Individual quality of life (iQoL) measures
recognize that people define life domains in different ways,
use different criteria to evaluate the domains, and place
differing emphasis on their importance to overall quality of
life [2, 3]. The schedule for the evaluation of individual
quality of life (SEIQoL) is a method of assessing iQoL. It
has been used in many contexts [3–7].
The SEIQoL consists of three stages of administration.
The first is a semistructured interview, in which respondents are asked to nominate five areas of life (domains) that
they consider most important to the overall quality of their

lives [1]. In the second stage the respondents rate their
functioning on each of these domains, and in the third the
relative weights of the domains are quantified.
In the original version of the SEIQoL a method called
judgment analysis (JA), based on social judgment theory,
was used for stage 3 [2, 3]. In social judgment theory,
linear models are used to explain the impact of important
factors, or cues, and their weights, on judgments. For the
SEIQoL, to quantify the relative weights, subjects were
presented with 30 randomly generated profiles of hypothetical situations labeled with the five chosen domains
[3]. Respondents were asked to rate the QoL they associated with each profile on a VAS. Ten of the 30 scenarios
were replicates to allow for a measure of consistency of
judgments. The judgments were modeled using multiple
regression to produce five relative weights summing to
100 [2]. The authors stated that JA was a successful aid to
the evaluation of QoL [2, 3, 8], but from a theoretical
viewpoint the number of 20 scenarios was small. Thirty to
50 scenarios are recommended to model the five weights
[9]. McGee reported the use of 40 scenarios in the first
study on the SEIQoL [8], but in later studies only 30
scenarios were used, of which ten were replicates [1–3].
Further, the time required to administer the JA to
respondents is long and the task cumbersome, especially
for older and cognitively impaired people. It requires
compensatory decision-making processes, i.e., the ability
to make an overall judgment on the basis of weighted
information. These drawbacks make JA unsuitable for
application in most clinical practices as well as for frequent assessment over a short period of time [1]. Because
of these problems with JA, Browne et al. [1] developed a
more easy to administer version of the SEIQoL, namely
SEIQoL-direct weighting (SEIQoL-DW). Respondents are
asked to fill in a pie chart in which the relative size of
each sector of the pie represents the weight the respondent
attaches to a QoL domain. The validity and reliability of
the DW in comparison with the JA-based SEIQoL have
only been investigated in two small studies. The first was
done in a sample of 40 healthy volunteers [1]. The mean
absolute difference between the 200 weights derived for
each method, that is, 40 times five weights, was 7.8 at the
first measurement, and 7.2 at the second measurement.
When weights derived from the two methods were converted to ranks and compared for agreement, the j value
was moderate at both measurements (0.40 and 0.44,
respectively). The reliability of the weights was moderate
for the DW (j = 0.51), and only fair for JA (j = 0.31)
[1]. In a later study, Waldron et al. compared the psychometric characteristics of the SEIQoL-DW with the
SEIQoL-JA among 80 patients with advanced incurable
cancer. The index scores generated by the two methods
fell within a range of 14.9 [10]. These differences are
large in clinical terms [3]. Therefore, the authors [10]
concluded that the two methods are not interchangeable.
Despite this lack of data on the DW, and its demonstrated
lack of agreement with the JA, it has become the standard
method for eliciting weights of the SEIQoL, due to it
being simple to administer. However, a fundamental distinction in cognitive psychology is that between explicit
and implicit thought [1], and previous evidence with
weighting methods suggests that respondents may be
unable to provide accurate implicit weights through a
method such as the DW [1]. Indirect methods such as JA
are based on more basic and simple judgmental tasks,
such as paired comparisons, and thereby may reduce
possible biases that may play a role in direct judgments.
Further, indirect methods are more likely to avoid the
social desirability effect according to which respondents
bias their response toward the perceived values of the
researcher/clinician [11]. Another advantage is that indirect methods can provide measures of internal reliability
and validity for individual interviews [1]. An alternative
indirect weighting method might be conjoint analysis,
which was developed in mathematical psychology and,
like JA, has a strong theoretical basis [12–14]. As in JA,
conjoint analysis is based on the premises that any treatment or health state can be described by its characteristics
(or attributes) and that the extent to which an individual
values a treatment or health state depends on the levels of
these characteristics. The method can be used to estimate
the relative importance of these attributes, and may
therefore be suitable for eliciting the weights of domains
of iQoL, since the domains can be seen as attributes of
iQoL.
In conjoint analysis the number of paired comparisons
needed to estimate the weights may be as high as the
number of scenarios needed in JA, but nowadays software,
adaptive conjoint analysis, is available that is adaptive to
respondent’s answers and can minimize the number of
paired comparisons. As an indirect method, it may provide
a feasible alternative to JA. ACA has been used to derive
treatment preferences in patients with lupus nephritis, with
HIV medication, and with cancer [15–17].
This study aims to assess the feasibility and the validity
of the ACA to derive weights for iQoL domains. Furthermore, agreement of the weighting procedures performed by
the ACA and the DW will be assessed. Because it would
not be feasible to use the JA as well, the ACA was only
compared with the DW. Since JA is rarely used and the
scientific community has overwhelmingly embraced the
DW, despite the lack of data on its validity, we wished to
compare ACA and DW. Further, relationships of the
resulting iQoL index scores with scores on a VAS for QoL
and for iQoL may give more insight into the validity of
both weighting methods.

Methods
Patients
To assess the feasibility and validity of the ACA to
derive iQoL weights, a convenience sample of outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis or cancer who were
treated at the Leiden University Medical Center were
asked to participate in the study. We selected patients
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who received multidisciplinary day treatment or had an appointment with the
specialized nurse consultant about their treatment.
Patients with cancer were selected if they received
curative radiotherapy at the time of the study or had
received curative radiotherapy in the 6 months before.
The latter patients received a letter at home in which the
head of the Department of Radiotherapy asked them to
participate in the study. These groups were selected
because they presented at the clinic with symptoms (RA)
or were known to have side effects (cancer) impacting
their quality of life. All patients were only included in
the study after they had given their informed consent.
The Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden University
Medical Center approved the research protocol.
Interview and questionnaire
Patients were interviewed either at the hospital or at home.
First, patients had to rate their current global QoL on a
horizontal VAS anchored at the two extremes by the terms
‘best imaginable quality of life’ and ‘worst imaginable
quality of life’. Next, iQoL was assessed by the SEIQoL. If
patients were unable to nominate five areas of life, they
were presented with a list with predetermined domains,
such as family, health, finances, living conditions, work,
social, and leisure activities, to help them make a choice
[3]. Next, patients rated their functioning on each of these
domains on five adjacent 0–100 mm vertical VAS scales
anchored at the two extremes by the terms ‘best possible’
and ‘worst possible’. Further, patients had to rate their
global iQoL, given their ratings on the five domains, on a
VAS anchored at the two extremes by the terms ‘the best
life I can imagine’ and ‘the worst life I can imagine’. In this
article, the score for global iQoL on the VAS is named as
SEIQoL-VAS. Finally, the weights of the IQoL domains
were determined from the DW and the ACA.
The DW-pie consists of five stacked, centrally mounted,
interlocking laminated discs. Each disc has a different
color and is labeled with one of the five domains nominated
by the individual. The discs can be rotated over each other
to produce a dynamic pie chart where the relative size of
each sector represents the weight the respondent attaches to
a QoL domain [1].
The ACA is a computerized questionnaire [18]. At the
start of the ACA survey, respondents were asked to indicate, using the mouse or key strokes, how important they
considered the difference between the best and the worst
level of functioning on each of the five SEIQoL domains
on a seven-point Likert scale, with adjectives at the first
(not important), third (somewhat important), fifth (quite
important), and seventh (very important) radio button. Next
they were presented with a series of paired comparisons.
The pairs consisted of two scenarios, one on the left-hand
side, and one on the right-hand side (see appendix). The
scenarios differed with respect to the level of functioning
on two or three domains of QoL. Although the use of
scenarios with four or five domains would have provided
for more precise estimates, we had to balance this against
feasibility. We decided such scenarios were too difficult for
this first experience using the ACA to assess SEIQoL
weights. Each domain had four levels of functioning: very
well, fairly reasonable, rather bad, and very bad. Respondents had to indicate their preference for the alternative on
the left or right on a nine-point Likert scale. The number of
pairs presented was based on the formula 39(N - n -
1) - N, where N is the number of levels across all domains
and n is the number of domains, resulting in 39(20 - 5 -
1) - 20 = 22 pairs [19]. This formula presents a rule of
thumb leading to three times the number of observations as
parameters available (for simulations on accuracy of prediction with various numbers of pairs, see [20]). We
presented 25 paired comparisons, where scenarios were
defined using two (pairs 1–15) or three (pairs 16–25)
domains.
Finally, patients filled out a questionnaire that addressed
demographic factors such as age, sex, marital status, education, and religion.
Computation of iQoL weights and index scores
For the DW, the relative weight of a domain is equal to the
proportion of the pie chart that its sector represents, which
can be read from a 100-point scale on the circumference.
Relative weights for the ACA are calculated as follows.
First, patient utilities for all levels of functioning on the
domains are derived by ordinary least-squares regression
analysis, from participants’ answers to the pairwise comparisons, assuming a linear main effects additive model (for
details see [18]). Next, the relative weights for the domains
are calculated by dividing the range of each domain (utility
of highest level – utility of lowest level) by the sum of
ranges of all domains, and multiplying by 100 [16, 19]. The
relative weights are expressed as percentages (the five
weights add up to 100%) and reflect the extent to which the
difference between the best and worst levels of each domain
drives the decision to choose a specific scenario [16].

The index score for iQoL is a weighted score, calculated
by multiplying the functioning scores for the domains with
their corresponding weights as derived by the DW and the
ACA method, and summing these. Further, an unweighted
index score was calculated by simply summing up the
functioning scores and dividing by 5.
Feasibility and validity
The feasibility of the ACA was assessed by measuring the
percentage of patients that were able to finish the task, by
measuring the administration time, and by asking the
patients how they evaluated the ACA with respect to difficulty and acceptability. We asked patients two
quantitative items about the method being confronting
(very, somewhat, not) or being unpleasant versus fun
(1 = very unpleasant, 5 = much fun). Further, we also
coded qualitative statements about the ACA being upsetting (comments such as ‘nasty’, ‘mean’, ‘suicide
questions’, ‘I felt like a prisoner’). As a measure of difficulty we also assessed how often patients chose the worst
option in a dominant pair, a pair in which one of the scenarios was on all domains better than the other.
The validity of the ACA was first studied by assessing
the number of inconsistencies in the rank ordering of
utilities, that is, the number of pairs in which the utilities
for two levels of functioning were ranked opposite to the
direction of the levels of functioning. We analyzed whether
age, health status, and level of education were related to
answers to dominant pairs and the number of inconsistencies by Pearson’s correlation and analysis of variance.
Next, we assessed whether patients were willing to trade
off a decrease from the best to the second-best functioning
level on their most important domain with the largest
improvement on their second important domain. This was
done by computing the ratio between the difference in
utilities for the largest benefit in the second important
domain and the difference in utilities for the two highest
functioning levels of the most important domain. A value
smaller than 1 was taken as indicating that the patient was
not willing to trade off decline in the most important
domain for any benefit in the second important domain. We
similarly assessed whether patients were willing to trade
off a decrease from the second to the third functioning level
on their most important domain with the highest
improvement on their second important domain.
Agreement
The absolute differences between the weights assigned in
the DW and in the ACA were described by means and
standard deviations. Agreement between the weights was
assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient and
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Pearson’s correlation
represents the linear association between two measures and
is not strictly a measure of agreement. However, a Pearson’s correlation which is much larger than the intraclass
correlation would provide some indication of a systematic
change between measures, as might occur if there were
learning effects [21]. Correlations between the weighted
scores and the unweighted score on the one hand, and the
VAS scores for QoL and iQoL on the other hand, were
assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. We used
SPSS version 12.0 for Windows.
Results
Patients
Of the 71 patients approached, 27 patients with cancer and
20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were willing to participate (response rate 66%). Twenty cancer patients and
four patients with rheumatoid arthritis declined to participate. Reasons not to participate were: too burdensome
(n = 5), patients too busy with treatment or work (n = 3),
and other (n = 3). In 13 cases the reason was unknown:
two patients did not give a reason and 11 patients did not
respond at all. Characteristics of the patients are described
in Table 1. Patients were, on average, 61 years old (SD
10 years). In 32 cases (68%), the interview was held at the
hospital, the other interviews were held at home.

ACA: feasibility and validity
All patients nominated five areas which they considered
most important to their QoL, of whom two patients had to
consult the list with predetermined domains. Domains of
life mentioned most frequently were own health, relationships with partner and children, social contacts and
friendships, hobbies and recreation, and work (Table 2).
The ACA survey took on average 20 min (range 10–
37 min). All patients were able to finish the ACA. Five
patients (11%) were in some sense upset about the ACA
survey, and a further three (6%) judged the questions as
very confronting. An additional patient found it very
unpleasant. For example, when a patient had nominated
own health and relationship with the partner as domains,
the ACA could offer one scenario in which the patient’s
health was very good whereas the relationship with the
partner was poor, and another scenario in which the
patient’s health was very poor whereas the relationship
with the partner was very good. Some patients became
upset when they had to make a choice between such
options.
Patients were offered, on average, 2.9 dominant pairs
(range 0–6). In such pairs, four times (3%) the worst option
was chosen and once (1%) the patient had no preference.
The four patients who chose the worst option had the same
level of education and were of the same age as the other
patients.
When the utility assigned to a higher level of functioning on a particular domain is lower than that assigned
to a lower level of functioning on that same domain, this is
inconsistent. Because each domain had four functioning
levels, six different pairs of levels [(493)/2] can be constructed for each domain, that is a total of 30 pairs of
utilities per person. On average, patients’ utilities were
rank-ordered opposite to the level of functioning in 3.9 out
of these 30 pairs (13%; Table 3). For the most important
domain, the mean number of inconsistencies was 0.2,
whereas this was 1.7 for the least important domain, and
the correlation between the inconsistencies and the domain
weights was r = -0.50 (P = 0.000, n = 235, 47 9 5
weights). The number of inconsistencies was lower in
patients with a higher education level (Spearman’s rho –
0.30; P = 0.04), whereas it was not related to age or health
status.
One out of 43 patients was not willing to trade off a
decline from the best to second-best functioning level on
the most important domain for the largest benefit on the
second important domain. Further, all patients were willing
to trade off a decline from the second to the third level of
the most important domain for the largest benefit on the
second important domain.

Agreement between DW weights and ACA weights
The mean absolute difference between the DW weights and
the ACA weights varied from 4.4 to 7.5 for the five domains
of iQoL, on a scale from 0–100 (Table 4). For all five
domains together, 36 pairs (15%) differed by more than 10
points. For the most important domain according to the ACA
weighting, 17 patients (36%) had a difference of more than
10 points between their DW weight and ACA weight.
The correlation between the DW weights and the ACA
weights varied from 0.22 to 0.43, and the intraclass correlation coefficient varied from 0.18 to 0.33, both
indicating a low agreement between the two weighting
methods (Table 5).
Consequences of weighting method
The index score for iQoL calculated with the weights
derived by the ACA (SEIQoL-ACA) was slightly higher
than the index score of the SEIQoL-DW [mean score 71.6
(SD 11.5) versus 70.1 (SD 12.2); P = 0.02] and both were
higher than the unweighted index (mean 67.2, SD 12.4).
The SEIQoL-VAS score correlated strongly and almost
equally with the SEIQoL-ACA, the SEIQoL-DW, and the
unweighted score. The three index scores were also positively related to the global QoL VAS (Table 6).
Discussion
We explored whether the ACA was a feasible and valid
method to derive weights for iQoL domains. The iQoL
community seems to have fully embraced the DW, despite
its lack of agreement with the original JA method. Contrary
to JA, the DW has no theoretical underpinning. Further,
DW is a direct method, and as such may not capture
implicit or unconscious thoughts or preferences. Since
respondents will generally not be explicitly aware of the
contributions of their life domains to their overall QoL,

indirect methods may be of more value. JA is not feasible,
however, in most situations, and for this reason we piloted
another theory-based indirect method, the ACA. ACA and
JA are based on the same premises. However, JA was
initially developed for assessing expert opinion [22, 23],
respondents have to rate many scenarios, and the task is
cumbersome. Due to its adaptive nature, ACA is much less
cumbersome than a full-scale conjoint analysis, which is a
nonparametric form of JA. In addition to being indirect,
ACA can provide measures of internal reliability and
validity (inconsistencies, willingness to trade) for individual interviews. The agreement between DW weights and
ACA weights may give insight into the validity of the two
methods.
ACA was to some extent feasible, because the ACA
took on average 20 min and all patients were able to finish
it. However, one in five patients judged the ACA task as
upsetting, very confronting, or very unpleasant. The paired
comparison task, despite working well for some domains,
turned out not to be appropriate for some others. Especially
choosing between two domains that are dear to the patient
turned out not to be feasible. Sometimes, the computer
offered a dominant pair, mostly resulting from the fact that
the utilities of the functioning levels were almost equal.
Only seldom was the worst option chosen. This finding
shows that almost all patients understood the task of paired
comparisons and were able to make a valid choice.
A limitation of our procedure was that patients did not
rate scenarios with four or five domains. Although the use
of such scenarios would have provided for more precise
estimates, this had to be balanced against feasibility. Using
all five attributes in the pairwise comparisons would also
have allowed for the evaluation of full profiles (health
states). The goal of this first study on the use of ACA for
the SEIQoL was merely to assess its feasibility and to
compare ACA weights with DW weights, not to assess full
profiles. We therefore preferred to opt for the more feasible
approach, which we deemed sufficiently difficult already.
Many patients gave inconsistent answers, but these
inconsistencies mostly occurred on domains 3 and lower,
and especially on the least important domain. For the two
most important domains, the large majority of patients had
utilities ordered in the same direction as the corresponding
levels of functioning. In the case of less important domains,
the differences between utilities of successive functioning
levels are probably small, which leads to inconsistent
answers.
A major premise of the ACA is that respondents are
willing to use compensatory decision making. Our findings
show that almost all people were willing to do so. The
willingness to trade off the difference between a decline on
the most important domain with the largest benefit on the
second most important domain is consistent with the
finding that, in patients with colorectal cancer, 95% were
willing to trade off a 1% loss of survival [17].
The agreement between DW and ACA weights was low.
Browne et al. reported similar findings for the comparison
between JA and DW [1]. Further, the weights derived from
each method were only poorly or moderately correlated to
each other. The differing weights from the DW and the
ACA suggest that the two methods are not interchangeable.
Weighting had almost no effect on relationships with
other global measures of QoL, and the DW index score
correlated 0.95 with the ACA index score, and both
weighted index scores were also highly correlated to the
unweighted index score. Weighting or not weighting
domains of QoL has received much attention in the literature. Some studies have shown that there is no effect of
weighting [24–28]. For iQoL, the findings of Wettergren
et al. suggest that the degree of importance is already built
into the process of selection, when the participants themselves select the domains [28]. Further, it has been
suggested that a satisfaction evaluation had incorporated
the judgment of item importance [29]. Our findings indeed
show that the weighted iQoL index scores were higher than
the unweighted index score, which indicates that patients
gave higher weights to domains with better functioning.
Most likely, the patients already take into account the
importance of a specific domain, first in the selection of the
domain and next when they evaluate the functioning on
that domain.
Our study has some limitations. The number of patients
was relatively small, due to the qualitative character and
semistructured design of the SEIQoL interview. However,
larger numbers would not have changed the conclusion of
our paper. A problem in measuring the validity of the
SEIQoL is that a gold standard for iQoL is lacking. JA has
been considered the standard weighting method, but due to
its complex nature has been replaced in the field by DW.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to include both the JA
and the ACA, because of the cognitive burden imposed on
the patients.
Despite the patients’ reluctance to perform the ACA, our
study gave clear insight into the problems of deriving
weights for iQoL domains. Our findings show that
weighting has almost no effect on the association between
the SEIQoL and global iQoL, although incorporating
weights for domain functioning led to slightly higher iQoL
index scores than the unweighted index score. Selecting
and weighting domains are clearly confounded. Because of
the high correlations between the weighted and unweighted
index scores, it seems sufficient to use the unweighted
index score as a measure for global iQoL.
