Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes
of cancer-related death worldwide, being the fifth most
common cancer and the third most common cause of
cancer-related mortality. The incidence of HCC has been
rising in the USA over the last 20 years. Liver transplantation is an optimal treatment option, as it eliminates HCC as
well as the underlying liver disease. The Milan criteria
(1 lesion greater than or equal to 2 cm and less than or
equal to 5 cm, or up to 3 lesions, each greater than or equal
to 1 cm and less than or equal to 3 cm) have been adopted
by many transplant societies worldwide as the criteria to
determine whether patients with HCC can move forward
with liver transplantation. However, many believe that the
Milan criteria may be too strict in regard to its size requirements for lesions. This has led to a number of expanded
criteria for liver transplantation, concerning both overall
size and number of lesions, as well as incorporation of other
markers of tumor biology. Tumor markers, such as alphafetoprotein, can also be used to follow treatment of HCC and
possibly exclude patients from transplant. HCC presenting
beyond Milan criteria can also be down-staged with locoregional therapy. Monitoring response to locoregional therapy
and longer wait times after locoregional therapy prior to
transplant can serve as surrogate markers of tumor biology
as well.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of
cancer-related death worldwide, being the fifth most common
malignancy and the third most common cause of cancerrelated mortality.1,2 The incidence of HCC has been rising in
the USA over the last 20 years and has been attributed to risk
factors, such as chronic hepatitis C infection, hepatitis B infection, heavy alcohol use, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, among others.3 Recent data has shown that only 46%
of HCC cases are diagnosed early on and most are unable to
receive curative therapy.4 Currently, it is estimated that the
median survival for untreated HCC is less than 1 year.5
Surgical resection, orthotopic liver transplant (OLT), and
ablative techniques are potentially the only curative options
available for HCC. Liver transplant is an excellent therapeutic
option for long-term survival in patients with HCC, as it
eliminates both HCC and the underlying advanced liver
disease.2 Initially, poor patient selection (advanced tumor
burden, unclear tumor etiology) resulted in high rates of
tumor recurrence post-transplant.6 This changed in 1996
when Mazzaferro and colleagues7 showed 75% 4-year survival rate and 83% recurrence-free survival rate, utilizing
their now well-known Milan criteria. These criteria (one
lesion greater than or equal to 2 cm and less than or equal
to 5 cm, or up to 3 lesions, each greater than or equal to 1 cm
and less than or equal to 3 cm, with no evidence of vascular
invasion or extra-hepatic metastases) showed comparable
survival outcomes compared to transplants performed on
patients with cirrhosis but without HCC.
The Milan criteria have seen widespread approval and have
been incorporated into the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS) criteria since 2002, for listing patients with HCC for
liver transplant. UNOS is the private, non-profit group that
handles the USA’s organ transplant system, under contract
with the US government. They manage the US transplant
waiting list as well as the database that contains all the organ
transplant data in the country.8 The Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network is the government workforce operating as a part of the Human Resources and Services Administration of the US Department of Health and Human
Services.9 Currently in the United States, the model for endstage liver disease score exception points are granted to
patients with HCC within Milan criteria or who were initially
identified as outside the Milan criteria but successfully downstaged within the Milan.
However, many believe that the Milan criteria may be
too strict in regard to its size requirements for lesions.

Publications from around the world support the idea that
patients with HCC beyond Milan criteria can be transplanted
with reasonable post-transplant outcomes (Table 1, Fig. 1).
Additionally, the Milan criteria have been criticized as very
restrictive, as this system is based on tumor size and
number, without taking tumor biology into account.10 This is
where the concept of downstaging takes place, which is a
process of applying locoregional therapy (LRT) to lesions currently outside of the accepted transplant criteria, to reduce
tumor burden, meet transplant criteria, and get transplanted.
Many studies have reported acceptable long-term liver transplant outcomes for patients with HCC beyond Milan criteria
who were successfully down-staged to within Milan criteria
by applying LRT to reduce the tumor burden.
The purpose of this article is to review the different staging
criteria present beyond the Milan criteria, types of LRT used in
downstaging, and other factors used in evaluating posttransplant recurrence risk.
Other HCC transplant criteria used
One of the most commonly used expanded HCC liver transplant criteria was published by Yao et al.11 in 2001, known as
the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) criteria.
These criteria are defined as a single tumor less than or
equal to 6.5 cm, or up to 3 lesions with the largest lesion
less than or equal to 4.5 cm, with a total tumor diameter no
greater than 8 cm. In that study, patients transplanted for
HCC within these criteria had 1- and 5-year survival rates of
90% and 75.2% respectively, compared to a 1-year survival
rate of 50% in patients who exceeded these criteria.11 These
criteria were originally fashioned using explant HCC pathological data but were later validated in subsequent studies.
In 2007, the same group used the UCSF criteria prospectively
in 168 patients with pretransplant imaging and showed
5-year recurrence-free survival of 81%, similar to Milan criteria, while being able to offer OLT to an extra 5-20% of
patients with HCC not included by the Milan criteria.12
Duffy et al.13 from UCLA looked at liver transplants performed for HCC between 1984 and 2006. In their cohort of
467 patients, 173 were within Milan criteria, 185 within UCSF
criteria, and 109 beyond UCSF. There were no significant differences in post-transplant survival rates between the Milan
and UCSF criteria at 5 years, by pre-operative imaging (79%
vs. 64%, p = 0.061). Patients with tumors beyond UCSF criteria had 5-year post-transplant survival of less than 50%.
Further studies conducted more recently have validated the
UCSF criteria as having similar patient and tumor-free survival compared to the Milan criteria.14
In 2000, the Pittsburgh criteria were conceived – these
criteria modified the tumor-node-metastasis (commonly
known as TNM) classification and investigated such HCC
characteristics as micro/macrovascular invasion, lobar distribution, tumor size, and lymph node involvement (all of which
are independent predictors of tumor-free survival), as well as
evidence of metastatic disease. Tumor number was not found
to be a significant predictor. In this staging system, tumorfree survival is directly proportional to staging, and the
likelihood of tumor recurrence in each stage is homogenous.15 These criteria were able to increase the indications
for transplant (being able to transplant larger-sized lesions
that would not meet Milan criteria).
Chen et al.16 showed in their study that the Pittsburgh
criteria better predicted outcomes and prognosis than the traditional International Union against Cancer pTNM classification. In a later study, the Pittsburgh group applied Milan and
UCSF criteria to a cohort of 393 patients who underwent OLT
for HCC. Of the 248 patients within Milan criteria, 5-year

patient survival and recurrence-free survival rates were
67.3% and 95.7%. Of the 265 patients within UCSF criteria,
the 5-year patient survival and recurrence-free survival rates
were 67% and 94.4%.17 However, one of the main roadblocks
to using these criteria is that information on vascular invasion
and lymph node involvement is not easily obtained preoperatively, limiting its use.
In 2008, the Hangzhou criteria were established. These
criteria dictated that the total tumor diameter could be either
1) less than or equal to 8 cm or 2) greater than 8 cm, with
histopathologic grade 1 or 2 (based on Edmonson criteria,
which describe grade 1 as being well differentiated and grade 2
as being moderately differentiated) and a preoperative alphafetoprotein (AFP) #400. Using these criteria, 5-year overall
survival was 70.7% and recurrence-free survival was 62.4%,
similar to Milan criteria. However, with the Hangzhou criteria,
an additional 37.5% of patients who would have been beyond
Milan criteria were able to be transplanted, having favorable
long-term survival outcomes.18 These criteria, however, rely
on pretransplant lesional biopsies to estimate tumor differentiation. As the American Association for the Study of Liver
Disease guidelines do not recommend routine biopsy of liver
lesions, this would be more difficult to implement.
In 2009, Mazzafero and colleagues19 came up with the Upto-Seven criteria. These criteria proposed that HCC with 7 as
the total of the size of the largest lesion in cm and number of
lesions, without vascular invasion, could have survival outcomes as good as those within Milan criteria. Using a registry
of 1556 patients who underwent OLT for HCC in 36 centers,
1112 had HCC beyond Milan criteria and 444 had HCC within
Milan criteria. A total of 454 of the 1112 patients had microvascular invasion, and the 5-year survival of those outside
Milan criteria was 53.6% compared to the 73.3% 5-year survival for those within Milan criteria. In the 283 patients without
microvascular invasion but who were within the Up-to-Seven
criteria, 5-year overall survival was 71.2%.19 A limitation to
that study was that it utilized data from postoperative histology
in making determinations on outcomes. This would not be
available in the pretransplant setting. Other determinants of
tumor biology (response to pretransplant treatment, AFP concentrations, etc.) were also not utilized.19 That being said, it
was in this study that the ‘Metro Ticket Calculator’ was conceived, which can provide 3- and 5-year overall survival probabilities based on characteristics of the HCC lesion. The
concept posits that the farther you travel (beyond Milan/established criteria), the greater the price (higher post-transplant
mortality and HCC recurrence rates).10
In 2016, the Toronto extended criteria were published.
These criteria have no upper limit on size and number of
lesions, but exclude patients with extrahepatic metastases,
evidence of venous or biliary tumor thrombus, or cancerrelated symptoms (weight loss >10 lbs or worsening performance status over 3 months).20 Most importantly, all
patients with lesions beyond Milan criteria require a liver
biopsy of the largest lesion to evaluate for poor differentiation, which would exclude patients as well. Prospective analysis was done comparing 138 patients meeting Milan criteria
versus 105 patients beyond Milan criteria (72.4% of which
were beyond UCSF criteria) but within Toronto criteria; the
5-year survival rates were not statistically different between
the two groups (78% vs. 68%). AFP was also reviewed afterwards and values >500 at listing or at time of transplant were
associated with worse outcomes, regardless of whether they
were or were not within Milan criteria.20 These criteria are
novel as they are more directly trying to measure tumor
biology. However, some may have issue with a lesional
biopsy, as there is an increased risk of tumor seeding.
Biomarkers
The previously mentioned extended criteria demonstrate that
there is an increased desire for further information on tumor
biology and surrogates of tumor biology when trying to
determine transplant suitability. While histopathologic data
of lesions can be helpful in determining presence of microvascular invasion or poorly differentiated HCC, these characteristics are difficult to obtain in the pretransplant setting.
This limitation has led to an increased interest in identifying
the best prognostic serologic biomarkers for HCC.
AFP is the most common prognostic biomarker studied in
relation to HCC. It has been utilized by numerous centers and
has been recently adopted by UNOS as a marker to exclude or
include patients from transplant listing (Table 2). Hameed
et al.21 investigated 211 patients who underwent OLT for
HCC and were within Milan criteria based on imaging. There
was a significant association between AFP levels and vascular
invasion, starting at AFP level greater than 300 ng/mL. AFP
greater than 1000 ng/mL was noted to be the strongest pretransplant variable predicting vascular invasion, which was
the only significant predictor of tumor recurrence. The 5-
year recurrence-free survival rate for patients with AFP
greater than 1000 ng/mL was 52.7% compared to 80.3% in
those with AFP less than 1000 ng/mL.21 Utilizing this as an
exclusion in the trial would have excluded 4.7% of patients
and decreased the rate of HCC recurrence by 20%. Using a
lower cut-off of AFP greater than 400 ng/mL would have
doubled the number of patients excluded (to around 9%)
but with only an extra 6% HCC recurrence reduction.21
Duvoux et al.22 were able to demonstrate that increasing
AFP levels at time of listing were related to worse 5-year
recurrence and survival rates. When patients were divided
into groups based on AFP less than 100 ng/mL, between
100-1000 ng/mL, and greater than 1000 ng/mL, there were
statistically significant different 5-year recurrence and overall
survival rates (16.2% and 67.5% vs. 26.8% and 51.1% vs.
53.0% and 39.1%, p<0.001).22 In particular, according to
their model, even subsets of patients exceeding Milan criteria
with one to three lesions and a largest lesion size of 6 cm or
with four or more lesions with maximum tumor diameter of 3
cm could be considered eligible for OLT if their AFP was less
than 100 ng/mL. Conversely, the model identified patients

within Milan criteria but with AFP greater than 1000 ng/mL
with high recurrence risk and significantly reduced survival.22
However, the optimal AFP value for defining patients at
higher risk for HCC recurrence has not been found. The
Hangzhou criteria previously mentioned utilization of an AFP
cut-off of up to 400 ng/mL and were able to obtain a 5-year
overall survival rate of 70.7% in patients meeting their
criteria.18 Lai et al.23 reviewed 158 patients undergoing OLT
for HCC and noted that patients with the combination of AFP
up to 400 ng/mL and total tumor diameter no greater than 8
cm had a 5-year recurrence-free survival of 74.4%, similar to
Milan and UCSF criteria, while this approach was able to
increase the number of transplant candidates. Toso et al.24
used similar parameters with their study, looking at total
tumor volume (referred to here as TTV; being no greater
than 115 cm3
) and AFP no greater than 400 ng/mL. In their
prospective study of 166 patients transplanted for HCC, 134
were within Milan and 32 were beyond Milan but within TTV/
AFP criteria; the 4-year overall survival rates for the Milan
and TTV/AFP groups were similar at 78.7% vs. 74.6%.
Some studies have even recommended an AFP less than
100 ng/mL as an upper limit. Grat et al.25 performed a
study evaluating 121 patients transplanted for HCC and demonstrated that increasing AFP had a nearly linear association
with increased risk of HCC recurrence in patients transplanted
within UCSF and Up-to-Seven criteria. Patients transplanted
under UCSF and within AFP limits had better 5-year recurrence-free survival than those within UCSF but not within
the AFP limit (100% vs. 69%). This trend was also seen in
those meeting the Up-to-Seven criteria (100% vs. 71.9%).
Recent publications have not only been investigating just a
static AFP prior to OLT but the trend of AFP in patients awaiting
OLT. This AFP ‘slope’ has been thought to be more reflective of
the dynamic nature of tumor biology than just a single value.
Giard et al.26 recently looked at 336 patients undergoing OLT for
HCC who were within Milan criteria. Nearly all (98%) of the
patients had LRT at some time prior to transplant and the AFP
slope was estimated by the AFP values during this pretransplant
period. An AFP slope increase greater than 7.5 ng/mL/month
despite LRT was significantly associated with post-transplant
HCC recurrence (3-time increasing risk compared to those
with a decreasing AFP slope) and microvascular invasion.26
The current UNOS HCC model for end-stage liver disease
exception criteria take into account a candidate’s AFP. Candidates applying for standardized MELD exception for within
Milan criteria HCC must have an AFP less than or equal to 1000
ng/mL. Candidates with AFP greater than 1000 ng/mL can
undergo LRT, and if the AFP decreases to less than 500 ng/mL,
then the candidate can be qualified for a standardized MELD
exception (as long as the AFP remains <500 ng/mL). Patients
with AFP greater than 500 ng/mL after LRT need to apply to the
national liver review board to receive MELD exception points.27
Downstaging
Besides using extended criteria to transplant patients with
HCC beyond Milan criteria, patients might undergo therapy
until the tumor burden will be within the Milan criteria. The
term, ‘downstaging’, refers to the use of LRT applied in order
to decrease the tumor burden until it meets suitable criteria
for OLT (usually Milan criteria).10 One of the advantages of
this method is that tumor biology can be assessed based on
tumor behavior over a period of time. Good response to
downstaging has often been linked to the presence of histologic markers of good prognosis in the treated HCC (lack of
microvascular invasion, low tumor grading, lack of satellite
lesions), similar to patients being transplanted within Milan
criteria at presentation.28 In the USA, UNOS policy now
requires a 6 month waiting period prior to granting HCC
MELD exception points, so that tumor biology and response
to LRT can be assessed.27
Yao et al.29 showed in 2015 that patients beyond Milan criteria undergoing downstaging to within Milan criteria for HCC
prior to OLT had similar 5-year post-transplant survival and
recurrence-free probabilities compared to patients within
Milan criteria (T2 lesion) without downstaging (77.8% and
90.8% vs. 81% and 88%). Even when assessing response
via 5-year intention-to-treat survival rate, there was no difference between the downstaging and T2 groups (56.1% vs.
63.3%). Similar post-transplant outcomes have been shown
in other downstaging studies as well.5,30 Current UNOS policy
includes a downstaging protocol to allow patients to obtain HCC
MELD exception points if specific criteria are met (Fig. 2).27
The main options for LRT include ablative techniques
(radiofrequency ablation or microwave ablation), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), or trans-arterial radioembolization. The decision as to what type of LRT should be
used depends on the degree of tumor burden, liver function,
and location of the tumor.10 The most commonly used
staging system for HCC is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer

(commonly known as the BCLC) staging system. This system
evaluates tumor burden, liver function, as well as patient performance status when stratifying patients into different categories. Given that patients being down-staged have advanced
tumor burden, based on BCLC staging, TACE is usually utilized
most often, followed by trans-arterial radioembolization and
ablative techniques.2
Since it has the best quality of evidence, TACE is the
recommended treatment option for large or multifocal HCC
without evidence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis (BCLC stage B, intermediate).31 Conventional TACE
involves arterial catheter delivery of chemotherapy (usually
doxorubicin or cisplatin) via lipiodol emulsion followed by vascular embolization of tumor-feeding vessels. The combination
of cytotoxic and ischemic injury tends to be significant as
these lesions are usually fed entirely by arterial flow, as
opposed to liver parenchyma that receives most of its blood
flow via the portal system.28 Patients with poor hepatic function (total bilirubin >2 mg/dL) or tumor burden greater than
50% of liver volume have higher risk for decompensation
after TACE.28 The advent of super-selective TACE, done to
minimize ischemic injury to nontumor liver tissue while still
inducing tumor necrosis, can mitigate some of these risks.32
Trans-arterial radioembolization is another treatment
modality for HCC. With this modality, microspheres containing Yttrium-90 are infused into the hepatic artery and are
preferentially delivered to the tumor area, where they emit
high-energy, low-penetration radiation to the tumor. Because
of the small size of the microspheres, trans-arterial radioembolization can be used in portal vein thrombus.28
Ablative techniques have also been used with downstaging,
though these are usually used in concert with other forms of
LRT. These range from percutaneous ethanol injection to
radiofrequency or microwave ablation. In radiofrequency ablation, cell death is attained by frictional heat using high
frequency alternating current, this heat producing coagulation
necrosis.28 Location of the lesion is important when considering radiofrequency ablation, as lesions near blood vessels may
not be treated appropriately due to a heat sink effect (impaired
heating of tumor cells because of ‘cooler’ blood flow near the
lesion). Lesions treated are usually no larger than 3 cm, as the
ablative zone produced with radiofrequency ablation results in
reduced tumor ablation in lesions larger than 3 cm.2 Microwave
ablation uses electromagnetic energy to heat tissue and is less
prone to the heat sink effect, allowing treatment of lesions near
large blood vessels.28
Response to LRT and wait times
The response of HCC to different modalities of LRT is an
important surrogate marker for survival, as well as a measure
of tumor biology. The modified Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria were developed as a method
for measuring treatment response based on tumor shrinkage.
These criteria distinguish response into four categories –
complete response (disappearance of arterial enhancement in
tumor(s)), partial response (at least 30% reduction in sum of
diameters of viable tumor compared to baseline), stable
disease (not meeting partial response or progressive disease
criteria), and progressive disease (an increase of at least 20%
in sum of the diameters of viable tumor compared to baseline,
or the appearance of new lesions).33 Gillmore et al.34 performed a study looking at 83 patients with HCC undergoing
TACE with follow-up imaging done after a median of 64 days.
They found overall and target lesion response of 57% and 73%
based on mRECIST results, with a significant association
between survival and overall (complete or partial) mRECIST
response in the form of a 42% risk reduction. Bargellini
et al.35 presented a study of 33 patients with HCC beyond
Milan criteria who underwent OLT after treatment with TACE.
Tumor response was reviewed by CT scan at 1 month after
intervention based on mRECIST criteria. The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly better in patients with complete
response (94.4%) compared to partial response (45.4%) and
stable disease (50%). These significant differences were similarly seen with 5-year recurrence-free rates (94.4% vs. 46.7%
and 50%, respectively). Another study assessed patients
undergoing OLT for HCC after TACE (both within and beyond
Milan criteria), with treatment response assessed using
mRECIST. That study showed that the 5-year recurrence rate
was 5.3% in complete and partial responders compared to
17.6% in those with stable or progressive disease.36
Along with response to LRT, the waiting time while listed for
liver transplant can be used to further assess tumor biology
and identify aggressive HCC. Halazun et al.37 showed that
patients with HCC receiving OLT in regions with shorter wait
times (median of 1.6 months) had significantly higher posttransplant mortality than patients transplanted in regions
with longer wait times (median 7.6 months), with 5-year survival rates of 67% versus 75%, respectively. The concept of
‘ablate and wait’ to assess tumor biology over time has been
shown to have merit in other studies, with the most current
UNOS policy requiring a 6 month waiting period for patients
listed with HCC prior to receiving MELD exception points.27,38
The policies in regard to UNOS MELD exceptions for HCC
have been an evolving field. Up until recently, patients were
granted a MELD exception of 28 points after showing stable
within-Milan criteria HCC for 6 months from listing (with an
AFP #1000 ng/mL). Escalating MELD exception points could
be accrued every 3 months, with a cap of 34. Since May 2019,
however, new policies have been implemented, where
patients receive exception points equal to the median MELD
at transplant (MMaT) -3. The median MELD at transplant
refers to the median of MELD scores at the moment of
transplant of all recipients 12 years and older transplanted
in hospitals within 250 nautical miles around the listing

hospital in the last year.27 This change was made to make
sure that a candidate’s assigned score was more proportional
to their needs and that candidates who relied on their native
MELD were not disadvantaged. This was also done to ensure
that MELD exception points for HCC had a similar impact on
transplantation in different parts of the country, each with
unique median MELDs at transplant.27,39
Post-transplant recurrence
One of the major fears after liver transplant for HCC is tumor
recurrence, which has been noted to occur in 8-20% of
transplanted patients. HCC recurrence usually occurs within
2 years after transplant, with a median survival of around 1
year after diagnosis.40 While many elements have been
linked to tumor recurrence post-transplantation, there are
few standardized risk scores formed to ascertain a transplant
recipient’s chances of HCC recurrence. After successful OLT in
patients with HCC, further information can be obtained based
on the explant pathology.
The Risk Estimation of Tumor REcurrence After Transplant
(RETREAT) is a validated prognostic score to help predict
post-transplant HCC recurrence, detect patients who can be
assisted by adjuvant therapy, and aid in defining posttransplant HCC surveillance schedules. When reviewing characteristics significant for HCC recurrence in 721 patients with
HCC within Milan criteria, three variables were noted to be
independently associated with HCC recurrence. These
included 1) tumor burden of the explant liver (total of
largest viable tumor diameter and the number of viable
tumors of explanted liver), 2) evidence of microvascular
invasion, and 3) AFP at time of transplant. The RETREAT
score was derived from these variables, with point values
being assigned to each of the criteria and with scores ranging
from 0-8 (higher scores denoting higher risk of recurrence)
(Table 3). A RETREAT score of 0 predicted 1- and 5-year HCC
recurrence rates of 1% and 2.9%, whereas RETREAT scores of
5 or more were associated with 1- and 5-year HCC recurrence
rates of 39.3% and 75.2% (C-statistic of 0.77, 95% confidence interval of 0.71-0.82). This scoring system was validated in another cohort of 340 patients, with a C-statistic of
0.82 (95% confidence interval of 0.77-0.86).41
Conclusions
HCC is an ever-growing entity and is becoming a more
common etiology to pursue orthotopic liver transplantation.
Successful outcomes for transplantation due to HCC should
have 5-year survival rates similar to those receiving liver
transplant for non-HCC related liver disease. While the Milan
criteria have provided good, stable post-transplant survival
and recurrence-free outcomes, there appear to be other
expanded criteria that have been able to provide similar
outcomes while opening the pathway of transplant to a
larger cohort of patients. The majority of these criteria,
however, require lesional tissue/histology to comment on
markers of tumor biology, like microvascular invasion or
poor tumor differentiation. Downstaging of HCC to within
Milan criteria is the alternative option. Surrogates of tumor
biology can be assessed with this approach, such as response
to LRT and increased wait times after LRT before transplant.
AFP level or the AFP slope in producers can be another option
to predict those with higher chances of recurrence and can be
used in patient selection for transplant. These methods can be
considered to choose optimal transplant candidates and
increase the number of patients who liver transplantation
can safely be offered to.
