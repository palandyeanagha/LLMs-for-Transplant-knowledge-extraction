Abstract
Background: In the United States, the highest burden of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and CHB-related liver cancer is
in the state of California, primarily in the San Francisco (SF) Bay and Los Angeles (LA) areas. The aim of this study
was to estimate county-specific hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence and quantify CHB cases by age,
race/ethnicity, nativity, and disease activity status.
Methods: Twelve counties in SF Bay Area and three large counties in LA area were included for this analysis.
Race/ethnicity-specific prevalence of HBsAg for each county and the state of California as a whole, was estimated by
including prevalence data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and various studies that
estimated HBsAg prevalence in US and foreign-born Asian Pacific Islanders, Hispanic, and Black populations. In addition,
clinical data of 2000 consecutive CHB patients (collected between 2009 and 2014) from a large clinical consortium in
the SF Bay area were used to calculate the age-specific disease burden.
Results: Of the 15 counties analyzed, SF had the highest HBsAg prevalence (1.78%), followed by Santa Clara (1.63%)
and Alameda (1.45%). The majority of CHB cases were estimated to be in LA County (83,770), followed by Santa Clara
(31,273), and Alameda (23,764). Among the CHB cases, 12.7% is active HBeAg positive, 24.2% is active HBeAg negative,
and 10.6% has cirrhosis.
Conclusion: This study confirms and quantifies the current burden of CHB in high endemic counties in the state of
California using population-level estimates combined with clinical data including those from the community.

Background
As a leading cause of liver disease, liver cancer, and liver
transplantation, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is an important public health problem globally [1]. In 2013, viral
hepatitis took the lives of about 1.45 million people and
was the seventh leading cause of death in the world, surpassing malaria and tuberculosis [1]. An estimated
850,000–2.2 million people in the United States (US) live
with CHB and only 34.6% are aware of their infection
[2]. The highest prevalence of CHB and CHB-related
liver cancer in the U.S is in the state of California (CA),
primarily in the San Francisco (SF) bay and Los Angeles
(LA) areas [3]. However, only 34.6% are diagnosed [2],
33.3% of those diagnosed receive care [4], and 45% of
those linked to care receive treatment if eligible according to treatment guidelines [5]. Without diagnosis, linkage to care and treatment, one in four people with CHB
will die from cirrhosis, liver cancer, and/or liver failure
[6]. In US regions with high proportion of immigrants,
such as the SF Bay area, the vast majority of confirmed
cases of CHB are Asian or Pacific Islander (API) [2]. A
study from San Francisco found that of all hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection cases reported, 84% were API and
of those 80% were foreign born [7]. In the U.S., the prevalence of CHB among foreign-born people is estimated to
be 10 times higher than the national prevalence rate [8]. A

seroprevalence survey study on Asian Americans in the
SF Bay area concluded that 8.9% API were infected with
CHB but 65.4% of the chronically infected adults were unaware of their infection [2]. One of the four overarching
goals of the Department of Health and Human Services
Action Plan for the Prevention, Care and Treatment of
Viral Hepatitis is to increase the diagnosis rate of CHB
from 33 to 66% by 2020 [9].
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) has been the primary data source for HBV
[10] prevalence estimate in the US population. However,
due to the small sample size in the survey, it is not an appropriate source for county- and state-specific prevalence
estimates of CHB [11]. In addition, county-level and race/
ethnicity-specific data are important for setting priorities
in public health and resource allocation at the local level
and since the distribution of CHB disease burden varies
by race/ethnicity which itself varies by counties. Thus,
to fill this gap, the aim of this study was to estimate the
prevalence of HBsAg and quantify CHB active disease
burden in the state of CA and certain specific counties
by age, race/ethnicity, and disease activity status, using
population-based data and clinical data from a large
clinical and community consortium in the SF bay area.
Methods
As a first step, we obtained age-specific population for
12 counties in the SF Bay area and 3 large counties in
the LA area (Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange
counties) as well as county-specific race/ethnicity distributions in these populations from the US census [12].
We then categorized the population according to the following four major racial/ethnic groups: White, Hispanic,
Black, and API. Nativity data for Black and API populations were also obtained from the US census bureau.
Approximately, 10.3% of Blacks in the US are foreign
born [13], of whom 36% were born in Africa, 35% in
Jamaica and Dominican Republic, 15% in Haiti, and 9% in
East and South America, and 5% elsewhere [14]. Within
the API population, we further divided the groups into:
South Asian (23.3%), Korean (8.6%), Japanese (6.7%) and
other East Asian (61.4%) [15, 16]. Secondly, we calculated
age-specific API foreign-born population distribution from
the US census data [17] and used these age-specific distributions for the East Asia, Korea and South Asia group. For
example, the Japanese foreign born distribution was reported to be 27% in the US [15]. Next, we collected race/
ethnicity- and nativity-specific HBsAg prevalence data
among White [11], Hispanic [11, 18], Black [11, 19–21] and
APIs [2, 11, 19, 22–24] in the US from the literature. Jung
et al. reported a 0% (353 people tested) of HBsAg prevalence among 70+ year old Hispanic population, which we
decided not to take and assume the same prevalence for 60
+ as the 60–69 age-group (0.38%). Table 1 shows the race/
ethnicity- and nativity- as well as age-specific prevalence
rates, where reported, in the studies that we used as prevalence data to calculate the overall prevalence for the SF Bay
area, the LA area and for the entire state of California.
In all race/ethnicity groups of ages 0–19 years, except
for the Black foreign-born Africa and Haiti groups as
well as the API foreign-born East Asia, we used the
NHANES 2015 data. NHANES reported a prevalence of
0.03% (0.01–0.08) among 6–19 year old group, which we
used for 0–19 year olds in the White, Hispanic, Black
US-born, API US-born Korea, Japan and South Asia
groups, as well as the Japanese foreign-born group. We
used the prevalence that was 10-fold greater than the
general population explanation of the NHANES study
and applied it to the Black foreign-born in Jamaica and
Dominican Republic, API US-born East Asian and API
foreign-born Korean groups for estimating the prevalence among 0–19 year olds.
In order to quantify the age-specific “active” disease
burden in relation to CHB activity and cirrhosis, we analyzed clinical baseline data such as HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 2000 consecutive
new treatment-naïve CHB patients who presented between 2009 and 2014 at several hepatology and community gastroenterology and primary care clinics as of the SF
Bay Area Consortium (SFBAC). Following the American
Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD)
guidelines [6], disease status was defined as “active” by the
following criteria: presence of cirrhosis or an elevation of
ALT > 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or evidence of significant histological disease plus elevated HBV
DNA above 2000 IU/mL for HBeAg-negative and above
20,000 IU/mL for HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic cases.
Results
Estimates of HBsAg prevalence and burden
The age-specific foreign-born distribution for API for
age groups 0–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69,
and 70+ were 22, 64, 83, 87, 89, 87, 90%, respectively.
Combining population distribution by county, race/ethnicity
and nativity with race/ethnic specific HBsAg-prevalence, we
estimated that overall, all race-combined, there are 104,734
(range 70,952–153,598) CHB cases or 1.18% (range
0.80–1.73%) in the SF Bay area. Table 2 shows the estimated overall age-specific HBsAg-prevalence (all race
combined) and related number of CHB cases in the SF
Bay area.
As shown, the highest prevalence was amongst ages
40–49 (2.08%) with a total of 25,627 (24.5% of all cases),
followed by 1.86% for those between the ages of 30
and 39. In the LA area, with a population of 15.5
million, we estimated that the overall prevalence is
0.71% (range 0.46–1.12%), with a total of 109,442 (range
71,363–172,482) with CHB. For California as a state with

a population of 39.1 million, the prevalence was estimated
to be 0.78% (0.51–1.21%), with a total estimated case

County-, race/ethnicity-, and nativity-specific HBsAg
prevalence and burden
Of the 15 counties analyzed, SF County had the highest
HBsAg prevalence (1.78%), followed by Santa Clara
(1.63%), Alameda (1.45%), San Mateo (1.40%) and Contra
Costa (0.88%), as shown in Fig. 1. However, LA County
(83,770), Santa Clara (31,273), Alameda (23,764) and
Orange County (15,091) have high number of individuals with HBsAg due to its large population.
Figure 2 shows the population and HBsAg distribution in
the SF Bay area (Fig. 2a), Santa Clara County (Fig. 2b), and
San Benito County (Fig. 2c). As shown, the SF Bay area has
a 24.5% API population, but accounts for 88.5% of all CHB
cases. Santa Clara County has the highest API population
(36%) and they account for 94% of the HBsAg-positive
cases in the county. San Benito County has the highest Hispanic population (59%), and they account for 38% of the
HBsAg-positive cases in the county. In contrast, although
API constitutes only 4% of the population in San Benito,
they account for 50% of the HBsAg cases in this county.
In the SF Bay area, the HBsAg prevalence in API is estimated to be 4.26%. Although API comprises of 24.5%

of the total population it accounts for 88.5% (92701) of the
104,734 HBsAg-positive cases. Of the HBsAg-positive cases
among API cases, 4.93% were estimated to be US born and
84.0% foreign born (Table 3). Black cases (2886) made up
2.76% of total cases, with 0.39% being US born and 2.37%
being foreign born.
Active disease burden
Table 4 shows the patient characteristics of the 2000
CHB patients in the Stanford and community clinic
consortium from the SF Bay area (SFBAC). Of these, 55.8%
were male, and the median age at diagnosis was 43. About
22% were positive for HBeAg, with 14% non-cirrhotic

active HBeAg-positive and 26% non-cirrhotic active
HBeAg-negative. Approximately 9% of all cases had
cirrhosis.
Applying clinical data from Table 4 to the SF Bay area
CHB population, in Table 5, we show the estimated data
on HBeAg, CHB activity, and cirrhosis. The number of
active CHB cases, who are considered to be eligible for
antiviral treatment by the AASLD guideline because they
have significant viremia and evidence of on-going inflammation or hepatic fibrosis, included 14,3149 (12.6%)
in the HBeAg-positive group, and 25,636 (24.5%) in the
HBeAg-negative group, with 11,112 (10.6%) cirrhosis
cases at baseline. In the LA area, a total of 51,952 people
out of the 15.5 million population and 109,442 CHB
cases are estimated to need antiviral treatment. When
projected to the state of California as a whole, out of
an estimated 305,419 CHB cases, 38,158 are active
HBeAg-positive, 73,700 are active HBeAg-negative and
33,091 are cirrhotic. In total, an estimated 144,949 (47.5%)
people with CHB in CA meet the AASLD criteria for
treatment.
Discussion
This study confirms and quantifies the current burden of
CHB in high endemic counties in the state of CA using
population-level estimates combined with real-world clinical data including those from the community. We estimated the overall all race-combined HBsAg-prevalence of
the SF Bay area, LA area, and the state of CA to be 1.18,
0.71 and 0.78%, respectively. The national US HBsAg
prevalence estimated by NHANES is only 0.3% [11]. According to our estimates, SF Bay area prevalence surpasses
the 0.3% by about 4-fold. The prevalence is highest in the
SF (1.78%), Santa Clara (1.63%), and Alameda (1.45%)
counties. However, the burden based number of patients
is highest in the LA (83,770), Santa Clara (31,273) and
Alameda (23,764) counties, due to the large population,
especially APIs, in these counties. As expected, a significant portion of the burden is among the API population,
with an estimated 4.26% HBsAg-prevalence. This rate is
higher than the 3.1% reported by the NHANES 2015
study as the true prevalence of CHB infections for Asians
[11], including both immigrants and naturalized citizens.
Our estimate is comparable to the 3.8% prevalence reported by Levy et al. among men aged 18–35 years residing in low-income neighborhoods in Northern California
[25]. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that Asians account for 50% of
all CHB cases in the US [26], our study estimated that in
CA, especially in the SF Bay area, APIs make up 88.5% of
all the CHB cases. Particularly relevant is the high proportion of total CHB cases among the API foreign-born
group that account for 84.0% of all the cases in the SF Bay
area. It is estimated that the overall burden of CHB in the
U.S. will continue to increase with ongoing immigration
from countries with intermediate (2–8%) to high (> 8%)
HBV prevalence [8]. For the foreign born population, we

carcinoma (HCC) due to HBV are high in the API population, data from SEER registries have shown a decline
in HCC incidence among Asians, while rates in other racial/ethnic groups will continue to rise [27, 28]. In fact, in
a national forecast study using SEER national data, by
2030, Hispanics will have the highest HCC in the country,
while Asians will have the lowest HCC rates [28]. It is important to note that Hispanic is the largest racial/ethnic
population in the state of California, accounting for 39%
of the total CA population [29]. Relative to Asians, Hispanics tend to have lower CHB infection but higher HCV
infection. Although our HBsAg-prevalence estimate of the
Hispanic population in the SF Bay area is only 5% of the
total, in counties that have large Hispanic populations
such as San Benito and Merced, the Hispanic population
makes up to 38% of all CHB cases. During the 2006–2010
period, among individuals aged 50–64 years, Hispanics experienced higher HCC incidence and mortality rates than
Asians and Whites [30]. Few studies have investigated risk
factors for HCC in Hispanics and the reasons for the rising trend in this ethnic group, although one study did
show that HBV infection is one of the risk factors for
HCC in Hispanic [30].
Although we analyzed 62% of the total population of
California, it is unclear whether we can generalize the
data from SF and LA reported here to the entire state of
California, as SF and LA cover counties that are more
densely populated and more diverse, and the remainder
43 counties in the state are quite different. However, our
clinical data, including HBeAg status, among CHB patients from the university liver and community gastroenterology and primary care clinics were comparable to
those reported by a North American multicenter study
[31], suggesting some utility of generalizing our estimates
to the state of CA. As there are many immigrants in
California from the Middle East, which historically
had a higher HBV prevalence than Western Europe or the
European settlers of North America, the NHANES study
we used to estimate the prevalence among whites does
not differentiate among the white population which is
likely a limitation in our study.
Given the high burden of CHB and HCC in the SF
Bay area and California, targeted prevention and control
efforts are needed to minimize the burden in these communities. A recent CDC-funded study showed that in
cities with large populations of Asia- and Africa-born
immigrants, community-based and refugee clinic-based
HBV testing initiatives can identify substantial numbers
of individuals with CHB [32], and stresses the fact that
culturally and linguistically specific approaches were necessary in all phases of the initiatives. Our data and estimates can be used for resource allocation planning to
target specific geographic areas and subpopulations,
race/ethnicities for effective interventions, such as
screening and linkage to care with appropriate therapies,
to minimize the burden of CHB and its clinical consequences, such as liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer. These
interventions are urgently needed as currently most of
the CHB patients (70%) in the US are not aware of their
HBV infection and there are also large gaps at various
levels of the cascade of care for those with known CHB
[5, 33–35]. Importantly, improved linkage to care can
identify patients who may benefit from antiviral therapy
which has been shown in both randomized control studies
as well as large cohort studies in the US to substantially
reduce HCC risk in CHB patients [36, 37].
Conclusion
In summary, our data suggest that there are approximately
305,000 persons living with CHB in the State of CA, and
about half of these (47.5%, 150,000) have cirrhosis and/or
meeting AASLD guideline criteria for antiviral therapy.
We also found significant variation in the racial/ethnic
