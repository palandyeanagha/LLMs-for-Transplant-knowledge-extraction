Abstract
Studies in the rat have pointed to a role for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the pathogenesis of acute
tubular necrosis. These studies used antibodies, which may
have nonspecific effects. We report that renal ICAM-1
mRNA levels and systemic levels of the cytokines IL-1 and
TNF-a increase 1 h after ischemia/reperfusion in the mouse.
We sought direct proof for a critical role for ICAM-1 in the
pathophysiology of ischemic renal failure using mutant
mice genetically deficient in ICAM-1. ICAM-1 is undetectable in mutant mice in contrast with normal mice, in which
ICAM-1 is prominent in the endothelium of the vasa recta.
Mutant mice are protected from acute renal ischemic injury
as judged by serum creatinine, renal histology, and animal
survival. Renal leukocyte infiltration, quantitated morphologically and by measuring tissue myeloperoxidase, was
markedly less in ICAM-1–deficient than control mice. To
evaluate whether prevention of neutrophil infiltration could
be responsible for the protection observed in the mutant
mice, we treated normal mice with antineutrophil serum to
reduce absolute neutrophil counts to , 100 cells/mm3
.
These neutrophil-depleted animals were protected against
ischemic renal failure. Anti–ICAM-1 antibody protected
normal mice against renal ischemic injury but did not
provide additional protection to neutrophil-depleted animals. Thus, ICAM-1 is a key mediator of ischemic acute
renal failure likely acting via potentiation of neutrophil–
endothelial interactions. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1056–
1063). Key words: cell adhesion molecules • kidney failure,

Introduction
Ischemia and reperfusion result in tissue injury in a number of
organs, including heart, brain, kidney, and gastrointestinal
tract, with important implications for patient morbidity and
mortality. Acute renal failure is the most costly renal disease
requiring hospitalization, and ischemic acute renal failure continues to be associated with a mortality rate of z 50%. The
pathophysiological mechanisms leading to acute ischemic renal failure are not fully understood. There is no clinically accepted therapy that prevents cellular injury after ischemic injury to the kidney (1). We have proposed that the outer
medullary vascular congestion that is seen in ischemic acute renal failure (2) may result, at least in part, from intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)1
-1–mediated adhesion of leukocytes
to the endothelium with obstruction of the venous vasa recta
and/or leukocyte-mediated increases in endothelial permeability leading to erythrocyte aggregation and edema (2, 3). Interference with outer medullary blood flow would then result in
sustained ischemia to the outer medulla, even after systemic
blood pressure and total renal blood flow were returned to
normal.
ICAM-1, CD54, an adhesion receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on endothelial cells, is a counterreceptor of lymphocyte function–associated antigen (LFA)-1
(CD11a/CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) present on mast
leukocytes. The CD54-CD11/CD18 interaction is an important
determinant of leukocyte–endothelial cell adhesion (4). mAbs
directed against ICAM-1 or LFA-1 are protective against both
the functional impairment and histological changes of ischemic
acute renal failure in the rat (5–7). Studies using ICAM-1 antibodies, however, cannot definitively establish the role of
ICAM-1 in the pathophysiology of ischemic tissue dysfunction.
Anti–ICAM-1 mAb may not block all ICAM-1–dependent interactions since ICAM-1 has multiple sites for integrin binding
(4). Antibodies vary in their specificity. Blocking a particular
epitope does not necessarily neutralize the functional activity
of the protein to which the antibody is directed. Since not all of
the functions of an adhesion molecule such as ICAM-1 are
known, it is not possible to establish in vivo or in vitro the extent to which the antibody is neutralizing. In addition, antibodies trigger secondary cellular responses and have nonspecific
immunological effects. Antibodies against adhesion molecules
have been shown to mimic the effects of the natural ligands of
the surface target molecule (8). Antibodies to neural cell adhesion molecule, for example, activate G-protein–coupled phospholipase C signaling pathways, increase cytosolic free calcium
concentration, decrease intracellular pH, and activate protein
kinases (9). Antibodies to other adhesion molecules also have
multiple effects on signaling and genetic responses in cells. For
example, in cells treated with antibodies to b1 integrins, there
is increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins
(10). Antibodies to fibronectin receptors, which block adhesion of synovial fibroblasts to fibronectin, induce the expresAddress correspondence to Joseph V. Bonventre, Massachusetts

sion of genes encoding the metalloproteinases, collagenase
and stromelysin (11). Furthermore, an antibody can induce a
different set of signals and responses than the actual ligand
does (11). It is possible that an antibody to ICAM-1 may trigger a response in endothelial cells that might confer protection
against renal failure, but this response may be unrelated to the
blocking function of the antibody. Thus, consequences of functional ablation of ICAM-1 are not necessarily predictable from
prior studies using antibodies.
An alternative ablative approach that avoids these problems in interpretation of antibody studies involves the inactivation of the gene encoding ICAM-1. Genetic ablation of
ICAM-1 has, in some cases, resulted in functional consequences that have been surprisingly different from those predicted from results with “blocking” antibodies (12). For example,
the ICAM-1 “knockout” mouse demonstrated that ICAM-1
was not required for thymocyte differentiation, although prior
studies, in thymic organ culture, indicated that blocking
ICAM-1 with mAb during T cell differentiation resulted in accumulation of CD42CD82 cells and delay in accumulation of
CD41CD81 cells (13).
The present studies were designed to seek definitive evidence for a role of ICAM-1 in ischemic renal injury by determining the functional and histological consequences of bilateral renal ischemia in mice genetically deficient in ICAM-1
expression. We also sought to determine which leukocyte population mediates ischemic renal injury by examining the effects
of neutrophil depletion on renal dysfunction that follows an
ischemic insult.
Methods
ICAM-1–deficient mice. ICAM-1–deficient mice were produced (12)
by homologous recombination of the ICAM-1 gene. The ICAM-1
gene was interrupted in exon 4 by the neomycin resistance gene in
embryonic stem cells. J1 embryonic stem cells heterozygous for the

Northern analysis demonstrates increased ICAM-1 mRNA expression in normal kidney tissue after renal ischemia and 1, 2, or 5 h reperfusion. Little ICAM-1 mRNA is detected after sham surgery. Hybridization with a full-length human GAPDH probe was used to 
demonstrate equal loading of lanes.

TNF-a (A) and IL-1 (B) levels were measured in normal mice 0, 1, 2,

surgery. Data are expressed as means61 SEM. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of animals studied at each point. P values

mice are presented.

disrupted ICAM-1 locus were used to produce chimeric mice, some
of which showed transmission of the mutated ICAM-1 locus. Southern analysis of tail biopsy specimens was used to identify heterozygous mice, which were bred to produce homozygous ICAM-1–deficient mice. Wild-type littermates were used as controls. As previously
reported (12), ICAM-1–deficient mice had no obvious abnormalities
in tissue architecture. Activated thymocytes and spleen cells taken
from these animals express no ICAM-1.
Ischemia protocols. ICAM-1–deficient and control mice weighing 20–40 g were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg). 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl at 378C was also
administered intraperitoneally. Core body temperature was maintained at z 378C. Using a midline abdominal incision, renal arteries
and veins were bilaterally occluded for 32 min with microaneurysm
clamps, during which time the abdomen was closed. The time of ischemia was chosen to maximize reproducibility of renal functional impairment while minimizing animal mortality in these animals, who
were not administered fluid intravenously. In one group of young
mice pretreated with antineutrophil serum (ANS) (see below), the
ischemic period was only 25 min. After the renal pedicle clamps were
removed, the kidneys were observed for an additional 5 min to document color change indicating reflow, and the incision was sutured.
Sham surgery consisted of a surgical procedure that was identical except that microaneurysm clamps were not applied. Blood samples for
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine determination were obtained from the tail vein or via cardiac puncture at 24, 48, or 72 h after
reperfusion. BUN and creatinine were measured by standard urease
assay/conductivity and picric acid reactions, respectively. All experiments were blinded to the investigator performing the surgery until
2–3 d after the surgery, and to the pathologists scoring the sections
until all the data were obtained.
Neutrophil depletion experiments. Approximately 16 h before ischemia, 150 ml of rabbit anti–mouse neutrophil serum (Intercell Technologies, Hopewell, NJ) or control antibody (anti-DPTA, the generous gift of Dr. Sy, Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General
Hospital) was administered intraperitoneally to 129/J mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) weighing 20–40 g. The animals
were subjected to bilateral renal ischemia as described above. Immediately after the microaneurysm clamps were applied, 200 ml of anti–
mouse ICAM-1 antibody derived from a hybridoma cell line (14, 15)
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD)
or control antibody (anti-DPTA) or vehicle was injected via the internal jugular vein. In an additional set of experiments, mice weighing
20–25 g were administered ANS or control antibody as described
above without the anti–ICAM-1 antibody or its control. These mice
were then subjected to 25 min of bilateral ischemia z 16 h after the

ANS or control antibody. Blood for determination of absolute neutrophil counts was obtained by cardiac puncture from animals that
had received ANS or control serum but were not subjected to renal
ischemia. Neutrophil counts were determined manually on Wright’sstained smears. There were no statistically significant differences in
the number of peripheral lymphocytes, monocytes, atypical lymphocytes, or eosinophils between the ANS and control groups. Blood for
BUN and creatinine determination was obtained 24 h after ischemia
as described above.
Light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Kidney tissue was
harvested at 24, 48, and 72 h after ischemia or sham surgery, fixed in a
solution of 10% formaldehyde and 1.5% methanol, and paraffin embedded. 4-mm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The
percentage of tubules in the outer medulla that showed epithelial necrosis or had necrotic debris was estimated as follows: 0, none; 11,
, 10%; 21, 10–25%; 31, 26–75%; 41, . 75%. Infiltrating neutrophils were counted using an eyepiece graticule, at a magnification of
400, and were quantitated as neutrophils per unit area (0.0625 mm2)
of the outer medulla. We estimated the fractional area of the outer
medulla containing any neutrophils by inspection of serial 3400
fields. In those regions containing neutrophils, 5–15 fields were
counted to derive a mean number of neutrophils per field. The number of neutrophils per unit area was then derived by multiplying the
mean number of neutrophils per field with the fraction of area of the
outer medulla containing these cells. All evaluations were made on
coded sections without knowledge of the experimental group to
which the mice belonged.
For immunohistochemistry, frozen kidney sections were incubated with anti–ICAM-1 (1:100) or ICAM-2 (1:500) followed by biotinylated secondary antibody, and finally by avidin-biotin-peroxidase (ABC method [5]). Staining of coded sections was graded as
follows: 0, none; 11, positive; 21, intensely positive.
Northern analysis. Total mRNA was prepared and blots were
probed with 32P-labeled full-length mouse ICAM-1 cDNA (16) using
standard techniques (17). Briefly, kidney tissue was homogenized in
guanidine isothiocyanate and RNA isolated by centrifugation in a cesium chloride gradient. Hybridization was carried out in formamide
at 428C, and the blots were washed in 23 SSPE (150 mM NaCl, 10
mM NaH2PO4, 1.0 mM EDTA) at room temperature twice, 23 SSPE
at 658C, twice and then 0.5 3 SSPE twice at room temperature.
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. MPO activity, used as an indicator of neutrophil infiltration, was measured (18) at 4, 24, 48, and
72 h of reperfusion in coded kidney tissue from control and mutant
mice and from sham-operated animals. Briefly, aliquots (0.2 ml) of
40,000-g supernatants of kidney homogenates were added to 0.8 ml of
reaction buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.2
mg/ml O-dianisidine dihydrochloride, and 0.0006% H2O2. Absorbance was determined at 460 nm. MPO activity, normalized to protein content of the supernatant, was expressed as the percentage of
measured activity in kidneys from mice subjected to sham operations.
TNF and IL-1 levels. Systemic levels of TNF-a and IL-1 were
determined by ELISA as previously described (12). Blood was taken
at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h after release of the vascular clamps or sham surgery.
TNF-a and IL-1 concentrations were determined on serial dilutions
of plasma samples, using ELISA (Endogen, Inc., Boston, MA) according to the procedure recommended by the supplier. Absorbance
was determined at 450 nm with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and values were calibrated using a standard
curve.
Statistics. Means of BUN and creatinine values, absolute neutrophil counts, and MPO activity were compared using analysis of variance followed by unpaired t tests. Mortality rates and pathology
scores were compared using Fisher’s exact test, and neutrophil counts
were compared with t tests with unequal variances (19). A P , 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
In normal mice, after bilateral renal pedicle clamping for 32
min, and 1, 2, or 5 h of reperfusion in normal mice, kidney
ICAM-1 mRNA levels were increased when compared with
levels in kidneys from sham-operated animals (Fig. 1). Plasma
concentrations of TNF-a and IL-1, two cytokines known to enhance ICAM-1 expression (4) levels, were elevated at 1 and 2 h
and TNF-a remained elevated at 4 h after renal ischemia (Fig. 2).
At 1 h after ischemia, mean serum TNF-a levels were 129617
pg/ml in sera from postischemic mice and 9.865.7 pg/ml in sera
from animals after sham surgery (n 5 4, P , 0.002). IL-1 levels
were 21.365.3 pg/ml in postischemic mice and undetectable in
the sera from sham animals (n 5 4, P , 0.03).
Serum creatinine increased approximately sevenfold over
baseline after bilateral renal ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion
in control mice and increased to 12-fold baseline by 48 h after
ischemia. ICAM-1–deficient mice were protected from ischemic renal injury (Fig. 3). Comparable protection from ischemic
injury was found in both male and female ICAM-1–deficient
mice (data not shown). None of the ICAM-1–deficient mice
followed for 72 h after ischemia (n 5 4) died, whereas 50% of
the control postischemic (n 5 6) animals died (P , 0.05,
Fisher’s exact test) (Table I). At 24, 48, and 72 h after ischemia, histologic sections of the kidneys of control mice had
significantly more tubular epithelial necrosis in the outer medulla than ICAM-1–deficient mice (P , 0.01 by Fisher’s exact
test) (Fig. 4 and Table II). Regenerative activity, as evidenced
by tubular epithelial cell mitoses, were prominent in the controls at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 4). Controls had significantly more
neutrophils in the outer medulla than the ICAM-1–deficient
mice did at 24, 48, and 72 h (Table II). Consistent with the histological identification of greater neutrophil infiltration in the
control mice, kidney MPO activity at 4, 24, and 72 h after reperfusion was markedly greater in control postischemic mice
than in ICAM-1–deficient mice (Fig. 5). Generalized neutrophil activation is supported by our unpublished observations in
the rat, in which kidney ischemia and reperfusion result in an
increased amount of MPO activity in the heart (data not shown).
No ICAM-1 was detectable by immunohistochemistry in
the kidney tissue from mutant mice before or after ischemia, in
contrast with normal mice that constitutively express ICAM-1
in the vasa rectae, peritubular capillaries, arterial endothelium,
and faintly in glomeruli. It is of interest that the vasa rectae of
both normal and ICAM-1–deficient mice constitutively express ICAM-2 (data not shown). Staining for ICAM-2 was
present in the glomeruli, peritubular capillaries, vasa rectae,
and arterial endothelium in ICAM-1–deficient, control, and
sham-treated groups. Thus, ICAM-2 appears to be less important than ICAM-1 in the pathophysiology of ischemic renal
injury.
We hypothesized that the protection seen in the ICAM1–deficient mice is due to the diminished localization of endovascular neutrophils in the kidney because of the absence of

ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, the effects of neutrophil depletion in normal mice on functional consequences of ischemia were assessed. Neutrophil depletion was produced by treatment with rabbit anti–mouse
ANS. Furthermore, in order to compare the effects of neutrophil depletion with treatment with anti–ICAM-1 antibodies,
one group of animals was administered anti–ICAM-1 mAb
and another group of mice was treated with anti–ICAM-1 antibodies after neutrophil depletion. We found that the preparations of ANS lost efficacy to decrease neutrophil counts with
time of storage. This provided us with an opportunity to evaluate how functional protection correlated with neutrophil depletion. As shown in Fig. 6 A, there was a good correlation between peak creatinines at 24 h and absolute neutrophil counts
at the time of ischemia. Protection against ischemic injury was
seen only in those animal groups in which ANS treatment resulted in a reduction in the absolute neutrophil count to , 100
cells/mm3
. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the protection afforded by
anti–ICAM-1 mAb alone was roughly equal to that afforded
by severe neutrophil depletion. Anti–ICAM-1 mAb did not
provide additional protection when administered to neutrophil-depleted animals. Protection is also seen with ANS treatment in younger mice (20–25 g) subjected to a shorter period
(25 min) of ischemia (Fig. 7). The mean neutrophil count in
these mice was 190690 cells/mm3
.
Discussion
These experiments demonstrate that ICAM-1–deficient mice
are markedly protected from ischemic injury to the kidney.
This protection is observed despite elevated baseline peripheral leukocyte counts. It has been previously reported (12, 20)
that the mutant mice grow and reproduce normally with no increase in spontaneous infections (in a controlled environment). Lymphoid development is normal, but antigen-specific
immune responses are decreased (12, 20). The ICAM-1–deficient mice are resistant to the lethal effect of high dose endotoxin, even though plasma concentrations of IL-1 and TNF-a
are increased to levels seen in normal mice after endotoxin administration (12). The livers of mutant mice had much less infiltration of neutrophils in response to endotoxin when compared with wild-type mice despite the elevated peripheral
neutrophil counts (10).
Our data suggest an important role for ICAM-1 and leukocyte–endothelial adhesion in the pathophysiology of ischemic
renal failure. ICAM-1 is constitutively expressed in the vasa
recta of normal animals. The elevated systemic TNF-a and
IL-1 levels after ischemia and reperfusion provide a possible
mechanism of upregulation of ICAM-1 in the postischemic tissue. These cytokines likely derive from the ischemic organ, as
has been demonstrated in brain (21) and liver (22). To our
knowledge, increases in systemic levels of IL-1 have not previously been demonstrated after renal ischemia and reperfusion. Sakr et al. have reported elevated TNF-a levels with ischemia and reperfusion in the rat kidney (23). IL-1 and TNF-a
upregulate CD11b/CD18 expression on leukocytes, increase
ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells, and/or increase
CD11/CD18 avidity for ICAM-1, thus increasing leukocyte endothelial adhesion and activation of leukocytes, augmenting
local inflammatory mediators, and enhancing tissue damage
(4). Administration of IL-1 to rats results in increased neutrophil infiltration of the kidney (24). Ischemia to the kidney results in increased MPO levels in cardiac tissue (unpublished
observations), suggesting that systemic factors such as TNF-a
and IL-1 may enhance neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium
of the heart and possibly other organs. This neutrophil adhesion in organs not directly involved with the insult may contribute to the development of multiple organ failure that is frequently seen with acute renal injury (1).
Given our previous localization of administered anti–
ICAM-1 antibody to the vasa rectae of the outer medulla (5)
and the inhibition of ischemia-induced increases in MPO activity in the kidneys of ICAM-1–deficient mice, these data are
consistent with our hypothesis that ICAM-1 is critically involved in the interaction of leukocytes with the endothelium of
the vasa recta. These leukocyte–endothelial interactions may
contribute to residual obstruction of blood flow and prolonged
local ischemia after the pedicle clamps are removed and may
explain the medullary vascular congestion in the postischemic
renal outer medulla (2, 3). We propose that the protection afforded by knockout of the ICAM-1 gene is due to prevention
of leukocyte accumulation in the kidney with consequently
less release of proteases, reactive oxygen species, and other
toxic and vasoactive metabolites. Our data demonstrating
quantitatively less neutrophil infiltration in the outer medulla
of ICAM-1–deficient mice supports this hypothesis.
A role for neutrophils (PMNs) in ischemic injury to the
kidney has been considered but never proven in vivo (25). It is
theoretically possible that the protection against ischemic injury seen in the mutant mice and with anti–ICAM-1 treatment
in the rat (5) may be unrelated to neutrophil–endothelial interactions. For example, ICAM-1 is a fibrinogen receptor (26),
and one possible consequence of mutation of the ICAM-1
gene is decreased intravascular coagulation. Hellberg et al. (3)
have suggested a role for erythrocytes in postischemic injury.
To evaluate further the importance of the neutrophil, we
tested whether neutrophil depletion could protect against ischemic injury in the normal mouse. Furthermore, to determine
whether ICAM-1–dependent protection was neutrophil dependent, we investigated whether anti–ICAM-1 mAb treatment could provide additional protection over that observed
with neutrophil depletion. The protection afforded the mice
treated with ANS provides additional evidence for a role of
neutrophils in ischemic acute renal failure. The fact that anti–
ICAM-1 mAb did not confer additional protection in the neutrophil-depleted animals is consistent with, but does not prove,
the hypothesis that protection from acute ischemic renal injury
in ICAM-1–deficient mice or with anti–ICAM-1 mAb is neutrophil dependent.
Neutrophils accumulate in various organs after ischemia
and reperfusion (27–29). Neutrophil depletion has been shown
to protect rats against ischemic renal injury in some studies
(29, 30) but not in others (31, 32). These studies varied with regard to the model of ischemia used, the measure of renal function, the age and gender of the animals, and, perhaps most importantly, the degree of neutropenia achieved. Hellberg et al.
(29) reduced absolute neutrophil count to 60610 cells/mm3
with ANS. In the neutrophil-depleted group inulin clearance
was fourfold higher than in control animals. In the study by
Klausner et al. (30), ANS was administered to rats 18 h before
ischemia and resulted in a decrease in absolute neutrophil
count to 125656 cells/mm3
. Mean creatinine in the neutrophildepleted group was 1.860.2 mg/dl vs 4.860.6 mg/dl in the control group (P , 0.05). In two other studies, protection was not

observed in rats in which neutrophil counts had been reduced.
In one case (31), however, the neutrophil counts (400–600
cells/mm3
) were significantly higher than levels attained in our
studies in mice and the Hellberg et al. and Klausner et al. studies in rats. Thornton et al. (32) reduced absolute neutrophil
counts in rats to a mean of 74617 cells/mm3
 with ANS and
found no protection with ANS in a model of bilateral renal
ischemia for 29 or 37 min.
Several mechanisms may contribute to neutrophil-mediated reperfusion injury. Activated neutrophils can release cytokines, reactive oxygen species, proteases, elastases, MPO,
and other enzymes. These substances upregulate adhesion receptors, are chemotactic, increase vascular permeability to
other inflammatory cells, damage tissue directly (33), and impair endothelial function (33–35). Neutrophils increase injury
to endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation
(33). Endothelial layer damage results in a decreased vasodilatory response to hypoxia and acetylcholine (36), which may result in further ischemic injury. Activated neutrophils have increased adhesiveness and increased cytoplasmic stiffness and,
along with aggregated platelets, can physically obstruct capillaries. Activated neutrophils produce vasoconstrictive arachidonic acid metabolites, which may potentiate vascular obstruction (37). Reperfusion of isolated perfused kidneys with
activated neutrophils can accentuate the functional renal impairment observed with ischemia (38).
Our results may have significant implications for the treatment of ischemic acute renal failure and the preservation of renal allografts in humans. In a phase I trial, it has been shown
that anti–ICAM-1 mAb can be administered safely to patients
after renal transplantation (39). Our data suggest that agents
designed to block leukocyte–endothelial interactions mediated
via ICAM-1 may be therapeutically effective in the prevention
and treatment of acute renal failure.
In summary, ICAM-1–deficient mice are protected against
ischemia/reperfusion injury. Depletion of neutrophils in normal mice results in protection against ischemia-induced deficits in renal function. Administration of anti–ICAM-1 antibodies is protective in the mouse but does not confer protection
beyond that observed with neutrophil depletion. These data
suggest a critical role for leukocytes and adhesion molecules,
in particular ICAM-1, in the pathophysiology of ischemic
acute renal failure and may have important therapeutic implications for the treatment of acute renal failure in humans.
