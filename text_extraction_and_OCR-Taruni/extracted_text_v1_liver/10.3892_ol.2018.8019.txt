Abstract. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) serves a primary 
function in metastasis and recurrence of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, in order to evaluate 
the analytical performance and clinical value of the liquid 
biopsy-based platform, a novel integrated subtraction enrichment and immunostaining‑fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(iFISH®) platform was applied to analyze CTCs in patients 
with HCC undergoing liver transplantation (LT). In total, 
30 patients with HCC undergoing LT and 10 healthy volunteers 
were enrolled. CTCs in peripheral blood that were obtained 
from each patient prior to LT and 3 months thereafter were 
detected using the iFISH® platform, and CellSearch® system 
was performed for each subject for comparison. Using iFISH®
and CellSearch®, the percentage of CTCs in patients with 
pre-operative HCC were 70.00% and 26.67%, respectively. 
CTCs counted using iFISH® (iFISH-CTCs) were increased 
compared with CellSearch® (Cellsearch-CTCs) (P<0.01). A 
significant decrease in iFISH‑CTCs was observed 3 months 
following LT (3.04±0.93/7.5 to 1.0±0.53/7.5 ml, P<0.05). 
Furthermore, patients with lower preoperative iFISH-CTCs 
level (<5/7.5 ml) had markedly increased recurrence-free 
survival compared with iFISH-CTCs (>5/7.5 ml, 15 vs. 
5.5 months; P<0.01. iFISH® platform exhibits an increased 
analytical sensitivity, and may be used as a dynamic monitoring tool for CTCs, and CTCs may be a good prognostic 
indicator for patients with HCC undergoing LT.
Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent 
malignancies worldwide and was the second leading cause of 
cancer-associated mortality in 2011 (1). The incidence rate 
of HCC is the highest in east and Southeast Asia, as well as 
in Middle and Western Africa; however, it is also becoming 
more prevalent in the United States and Europe (1). Despite 
liver transplantation (LT) remaining one of the most effective radical treatments, a significant proportion of patients 
still suffer from unfavorable outcomes due to a high recurrence rate (~15-20%) (2,3). Ultrasonography has been widely 
used in HCC screening and monitoring; however, interpretation of test results is subjective and depends upon the skill 
and experience of investigators and therefore this limits its 
clinical application. Likewise, radiological examinations 
including contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are sometimes not 
able to detect small tumors and inconspicuous metastasis 
lesions due to low sensitivity, leading to delayed treatment. 
α-fetoprotein (AFP) is a widely used serum marker in the 
clinical diagnosis and surveillence of HCC. However, it 
has been previously reported that pregnancy, benign liver 
disease and certain gastrointestinal tumors may contribute 
to false-positive results (4). Therefore, the importance of 
developing an accurate diagnostic marker or monitoring tool 
for patients with HCC should be emphasized.
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cells that have shed into 
the vasculature from a primary or metastatic solid tumor and 
are carried around the body via blood circulation. Previous 
studies have demonstrated that CTCs serve a key function in 
metastasis and recurrence in HCC (5,6). Due to the complete 
Application of a novel liquid biopsy in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver transplantation

removal of tumor lesion(s) and implantation of tumor-free 
grafts through LT, the source of short-term recurrence and 
metastasis must be residual extrahepatic CTCs. Therefore, 
investigation of CTCs in peripheral blood, also termed liquid 
biopsy, is a promising strategy for monitoring patients with 
HCC undergoing LT.
CellSearch® system is a traditional device for CTCs detection (7). High-level CTCs detected by CellSearch® system have 
been implicated in increased recurrence risk in HCC patients 
after liver resection (8,9). However, previous evidence demonstrated that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process 
may contribute to the low expression of epithelial cell adhesion 
marker (EpCAM) and cytokeratins (CKs), and thus reduce the 
detection sensitivity (10). The immunostaining‑fluorescence 
in situ hybridization® (iFISH®) platform exhibits good 
sensitivity in breast (7), gastric (8), lung (9) and pancreatic 
cancer (10), and is therefore highly recommended. However, 
the size of tumor cells and EpCAM expression varies. iFISH 
can eliminate red blood cells (RBCs) and deplete white 
blood cells (WBCs) using anti-CD45 antibodies, then in situ
phenotypic and karyotypic identification is performed using 
centromere probe 8 (CEP8), which effectively improves CTCs 
detection sensitivity via subtractive enrichment (11). In the 
present study, iFISH® was utilized to separate and characterize CTCs in patients with HCC undergoing LT. The present 
study aims to evaluate the analytical performance of iFISH®
and examine it's clinical value, as well as compare it to the 
CellSearch® system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first time that this platform has been applied to patients with 
HCC undergoing LT.
Materials and methods
Patients and sample collection. Between November 2014 and 
October 2015, peripheral blood samples were collected from 
30 HCC patients undergoing LT, and 10 healthy controls in 
Renji Hospital (Shanghai, China). Blood was obtained 2 days 
prior to transplantation for patients with HCC (baseline), and 
a median of 90 days (range, 81-97 days) following LT. At each 
time point, 7.5 ml peripheral blood was collected from each 
subject for iFISH® and Cellsearch® analyses. Blood samples 
were processed within 48 h of collection. Ethical approval 
for the recruitment of human subjects was obtained from the 
Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated 
Renji Hospital (Shanghai, China) and was consistent with 
ethical guidelines provided by the Declaration of Helsinki 
(1975). Written informed consent was obtained from each 
patient prior to collecting blood samples. Clinical information 
was also collected including the AFP level, size and number 
of tumors, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage (12), 
Milan criteria (13), Child-Pugh score and presence of 
hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, vascular invasion and 
portal vein tumor thrombus. Patients were followed up 
every 3 months during the first postoperative year and at 
least every 3-4 months thereafter. The mean follow-up was 
11.2 months (range, 4-20 months). During the follow-up, 
3 patients succumbed to intrahepatic recurrence and 3 patients 
succumbed to extrahepatic metastasis. All patients were 
monitored prospectively by measuring levels of serum AFP 
and performing abdomen ultrasonography monthly in the 
first 3 months and every 6 months in late stage following LT. 
Chest x-ray was also performed every 6 months following LT. 
For patients with test results indicating recurrence, CT and/or 
MRI, and even bone scanning were used to verify whether 
intrahepatic recurrence and/or extrahepatic metastasis had 
occurred. A diagnosis of recurrence was based on typical 
imaging appearances in CT, MRI and/or bone scans, as well 
as an elevated AFP level >400 IU/ml.
Subtraction enrichment in iFISH®. Subtraction enrichment of 
CTCs was performed similarly to previous studies (7,10,11). 
Cytelligen® CTC enrichment kit (Cytelligen Inc., San 
Diego, CA, USA) was used to enrich CTCs. Briefly, a 7.5 ml 
blood sample was collected into acid-citrate-dextrose anticoagulant tube, centrifuged at 600 x g for 5 min at room 
temperature and the supernatant was discarded. The sample 
was mixed with 3 ml Separation Matrix (Cytelligen Inc., 
San Diego, CA, USA), centrifuged at 400 x g for 5 min at 
room temperature and the white buffy coat was collected 
and then incubated with 150 µl immunomagnetic particles 
conjugated to anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)45 antibody 
(SEH-001R3; Cytelligen Inc.) for 10 min at room temperature, separated by a magnetic separator (cat. no. V8151; 
Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The bead-free 
solution was transferred to a centrifuge tube and washed 
twice with CRC washing buffer (SEH-001R1; Cytelligen 
Inc.) and, centrifuged at 650 x g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, then 100 µl Cytelligen 
Fixative (SEH-001R4; Cytelligen Inc.) was added at room 
temperature for 4 h and the cell suspension was placed into 
cover glass, 37˚C overnight for drying.
Immunofluorescent staining of CTCs in iFISH®. CTCs 
identification was performed using the Cytelligen® CTCs identification kit (Cytelligen Inc.) according to the manufacturers' 
protocol. Samples were prepared and fixed as aforementioned. Briefly, the cover glass was removed in FR2 buffer 
(FSH-001R2; Cytelligen Inc.) and dehydrated in 100% ethanol 
for 2 min in room temperature. CEP 8 SpectrumOrange 
(Vysis, Inc.; Abbott Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, 
USA) hybridization was performed according to a previously 
published protocol (7) Slides were then were then incubated 
with antibody preparation solution-1 (FSH-001R6; Cytelligen 
Inc.), anti-cytokeratin 18 antibody (HAB-001R1; Cytelligen 
Inc.) and anti-CD45 antibody (HAB-001R2; Cytelligen Inc.). 
Finally, mounting medium (FSH-001R7; Cytelligen Inc.) with 
DAPI was added and observed using a fluorescence microscope 
(Magnification, x40; Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). CTCs 
were defined as cells with features of CK+/CD45-/DAPI+ 
and hybridization signal for CEP8 ≥2, CK‑/CD45‑/DAPI+ 
and hybridization signal for CEP8>2. CK-/CD45+/DAPI+ and 
hybridization signal for CEP8=2 was defined as a white blood 
cell (WBC) and CK-/CD45-/DAPI+ and hybridization signal 
for CEP8=2 was defined as an indeterminate cell.
CTCs detected using CellSearch® system. Samples were 
detected using CellSearch® system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Inc., San Diego, 
CA, USA). Prior to testing, 7.5 ml of peripheral blood was 
collected (as aforementioned) into the CellSave Preservative 

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 15: 5481-5488, 2018 5483
Tube containing EDTA and pre‑prepared fixative (PBS, 25% 
proprietary ingredients, 0.1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide; 
included in the CellSearch® CTC Kit; Veridex LLC, Raritan, 
NJ, USA) for protecting CTCs morphology. Subsequently, 
6 ml buffer (included in the CellSearch® CTC kit) was added 
into the tube and centrifuged at room temperature with 164 x g 
for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The tube was 
placed in the CellTracks Autoprep System (Menarini Silicon 
Biosystems, Inc.). EpCAM-coated magnetic beads were used 
to enrich cells which expressed EpCAM on their surface, and 
the enriched cells underwent subsequent immunofluorescence 
staining.
Immunofluorescence reagent (cat no. 7900001; Menarini 
Silicon Biosystems, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol and included anti-CK (CK8, CK18 and 
CK19; 0.0006%) antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin, 
anti-CD45 antibody (0.0012%) conjugated to allophycocyanin and nuclear dye DAPI (0.005%). The immunostaining 
of cells was performed at room temperature for 20 min.

Finally, cells were transferred to the CellTracks Analyzer 
II (Cat no. 9555; Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Inc.) for 
analysis. CTCs were characterized as EpCAM-positive, 
CK-positive, DAPI-positive and CD45-negative cells 
(EpCAM+/CK+/DAPI+/CD45-).
Validation of iFISH® platform in cell lines. A cell spiking test 
was performed to validate the effectiveness of iFISH® platform 
in HCC. Huh-7 cells, a hepatoma cell line, was obtained from 
the cell bank of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultured 
in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) in a humidified 
5% CO2/95% air atmosphere at 37°C. For the spiking test, 
100 Huh-7 cells were added to each 7.5 ml of peripheral blood 
obtained from the 10 healthy volunteers. Then the aforementioned iFISH® protocol was performed to enrich and count the 
CTCs detected. The mean recovery rate was calculated by the 
ratio of iFISH-CTCs number to 100 spiked cells number in 
the 10 samples.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed 
using SPSS (version 22.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, 
USA). Data with a normal distribution are presented as 
the mean ± the standard deviation, whereas data without 
a normal distribution are presented as the median (range). 
Difference between groups was analyzed using the χ2 test, 
Fisher's exact test or Student's t-test, as appropriate. If 
variations within groups were not homogeneous, data were 
analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test 
or Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as appropriate. The agreement between CellSearch® and iFISH® was determined 
by κ test. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used 
for nonparametric correlation analysis. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the sensitivity (SEN) and specificity of different methods. Positive 
predictive values and negative predictive values were also 
computed. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined 
as the time from LT to the date of conformed recurrence 
or the final follow‑up. Kaplan‑Meier survival curves with 
log-rank test were used to compare the difference in RFS. 
The threshold of AFP level between high-AFP and low-AFP 
patients was 400 IU/ml (4). Univariate Cox proportional 
hazards regression analysis was performed to identify 
RFS-associated risk factors. Graphical plots were generated 
using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, 
CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically 
significant difference.
Results
Technical validation of iFISH® platform. As iFISH® platform has never been applied in HCC field, to the best of our 
knowledge, the analytical performance of iFISH for CTCs 
detection was preliminarily examined in 1 patient and 10 
volunteers, as well as cell spiking test. Blood specimens from 
10 healthy volunteers were examined and no iFISH-CTCs 
were detected. Furthermore, one patient with HCC was investigated and exhibited terminal HCC with distant metastases 
and a number of 7 iFISH-CTCs and CK-/CD45-/DAPI+/CEP8 
>2 was identified. In the cell spiking test, the mean recovery 
rate was 81.60±6.04%, suggesting that iFISH platform was 
practical for patients with HCC undergoing LT. iFISH-CTCs 
identified by various characteristics are presented in Fig. 1.
Detection of CTCs in HCC patients and healthy volunteers. 
With the exception of single CTCs detected, CTC clusters 
(defined as CTCs aggregated through plakoglobin‑dependent 
intercellular adhesion) were also detected in certain samples. 
These CTC clusters are derived from multicellular groupings 
of primary liver tumor cells. A CTC cluster demonstrated 
23- to 50-fold increased metastatic potential compared

with single CTCs as indicated in previous studies (14). In 
the present study, it was estimated there would be 1 CTC 
cluster to every 20 CTCs conservatively. As demonstrated 
in Fig. 2, the number of CTCs detected in patients with 
HCC was 0-23/7.5 ml (median, 1/7.5 ml) for iFISH®, which 
was significantly increased compared with that detected by 
CellSearch® (0-2/7.5 ml, median 0/7.5 ml; P<0.01). CTCs were 
detected using iFISH® in 21/30 patients (70%), presenting an 
increased detection rate compared with that in CellSearch® 
(8/30 patients, positive rate; 26.67%). The κ agreement coefficient between iFISH® and CellSearch® was 0.077 (P=0.559), 
indicating that the similarity in results between Cellsearch

and iFISH was poor. No CTC was detected in any healthy 
volunteer for either approach.
To discriminate patents with HCC from healthy volunteers, 
ROC curves were applied to determine the detection efficiency 
of iFISH and CellSearch®. The SEN of iFISH® was markedly increased compared with that of CellSearch® (SEN, 70 
vs. 26.67%; P<0.01; Table I).
The postoperative levels of CTCs were measured in 
23 patients at 3 months following transplantation. Compared 
with preoperative results, the number of CTCs detected was 
decreased in 65.21 and 34.78% (iFISH® and CellSearch®, 
respectively) of patients with HCC following LT. However, 
the iFISH-CTCs level didn't change in 21.73% of patients and 
increased in 13.04%. For Cellsearch-CTCs, the ratio is 56.52 
and 8.70% respectively (Fig. 3). iFISH-CTCs count was significantly decreased following transplantation (P<0.05). Notably, 
the patient whose iFISH-CTCs counts increased from 2/7.5 ml 
preoperatively to 12/7.5 ml postoperatively was diagnosed with 
extrahepatic metastasis 4 months following surgery. There was 
no similar elevation detected in the Cellsearch®-CTCs count.
Associations between positive rate of CTCs and clinicopathological characteristics. The associations between positive 
rates of both preoperative Cellsearch-CTCs and iFISH-CTCs 
and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC patients were 
examined.
Results identified a significant negative association between 
iFISH-CTCs positive rate and high-AFP rate (Spearmans 
correlation value=‑0.617; P<0.001). However, no significant 
associations were observed between CTCs and other clinicopathological features including AFP level, vascular invasion, 
portal vein tumor thrombus, BCLC stage and Milan criteria 
(Table II).
Notably, results demonstrated that the median preoperative iFISH-CTCs number in low-AFP and high-AFP patients 
was 1.5/7.5 ml (range, 0-23) and 0/7.5 ml (range, 0-4), 
respectively, which suggested that the low-AFP subgroup had 
a significantly increased iFISH‑CTCs level compared with 
the high-AFP group (P<0.01, Fig. 4). Noticeably, positive 
iFISH-CTCs were detected in 90% of patients with low-AFP 
levels. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated that AFP 
levels were negatively associated with iFISH-CTCs levels 
(R=-0.385; P<0.05).
Prognostic value of CTCs in HCC patients. At a medium 
follow-up of 15 months (range 4-20), 11 patients with 
HCC (36.67%) were diagnosed with intrahepatic recurrence (n=7) or extrahepatic metastasis using CT or MRI 
scanning. Furthermore, metastatic lesions were located in 
numerous locations including the bone (n=1), lung (n=1), 
abdominal cavity (n=1) and the adrenal gland (n=1), which 
were detected by CT, MRI or bone scanning. Univariate 
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis identified that 
preoperative iFISH‑CTCs (≥5/7.5 ml) and vascular invasion 
were prognostic factors for RFS (Table III). The median RFS 
in patients with iFISH‑CTCs <5/7.5 ml was significantly 
increased compared with CTC ≥5/7.5 ml (15 vs. 5.5 months). 
Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that preoperative 
iFISH‑CTCs ≥5/7.5 ml was associated with poor RFS (hazard 
ratio=5.142, P<0.01; Table III, Fig. 5A). For patients with 
low-AFP (AFP<400 IU/ml) levels, the prognostic value was 
increased (hazard ratio=26.4, P<0.001; Fig. 5B) comparing 
with high-AFP patients.
Discussion
In the present study, the analytical performance and clinical 
value of iFISH® in patients with HCC undergoing LT was 
evaluated. The detected iFISH-CTCs count was markedly 
increased compared with that of Cellsearch-CTCs, and the 
positive rate of iFISH-CTCs was significantly increased 
compared with Cellsearch-CTCs. Furthermore, the positive 
rate of Cellsearch‑CTCs in the present study was significantly 
decreased compared with previous studies investigating 
patients with HCC who underwent hepatectomy (15-17). 
One possible reason for this is that the tumor lesion was 
drawn out thoroughly during LT; however, following hepatectomy, lesions may remain in residual liver lobes. Thus, for 
patients with HCC undergoing LT, the increased detection 
sensitivity may facilitate in the clinical application of the 
iFISH® platform.
The ability of iFISH® system to discriminate between 
HCC patients and healthy volunteers may provide a promising 
method for diagnosing and/or monitoring HCC. Currently, 
AFP remains the mainstream serum screening biomarker 
for HCC. However, ~30-40% of patients with HCC are 
AFP-negative (18,19), and it has been previously demonstrated 
that pregnancy, benign liver disease and certain gastrointestinal tumors may contribute to false-positive result (4,20). 
Therefore, guidelines in the USA and Europe have recommended ultrasonography alone without AFP examination as 
the routine surveillance method for HCC (21,22). Notably, 
in the present study results demonstrated that there was an 
increased negative association between iFISH-CTCs positive 
rate and high-AFP rate. This association was evident as one or 
more iFISH-CTCs were detected in 90% of low-AFP patients.

Thus, iFISH-CTCs levels may provide an effective supplement for the AFP approach, especially for those patients with 
low-AFP levels.
The present study also examined the dynamic change of 
CTCs during the perioperative period. Surgical manipulation including squeezing or traction on the tumor has been 
proven to facilitate tumor cell dissemination into circulation (23). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time 
that a significant decrease of iFISH‑CTCs load was observed 
following LT, which may be caused by the radical removal 
of the primary tumor. However, future studies should be 
implemented to investigate the value of monitoring CTCs 
changes along with postoperative treatment. According to 
the present study, the regular surveillance of iFISH-CTCs 
following LT counts may be effective for early-detection 
of HCC recurrence, and subsequently inform personalized 
antitumor therapy.
The prognostic value of iFISH® platform was also 
investigated. Results of the present study demonstrated that 
iFISH®‑CTCs (≥5/7.5 ml) was a prognostic factor for patients 
with HCC undergoing LT. Despite this, Cellsearch®-CTCs 
have been previously reported as a strong predictor for HCC 
recurrence following curative resection (15-17); however, the 
prognostic value of Cellsearch®-CTCs was not favorable in 
the present study, which may be due to the low detection rate. 
Additionally, it was also identified that in addition to vascular 
invasion, portal vein tumor thrombus, BCLC stage and Milan 
criteria, iFISH-CTCs is an independent prognostic predictor 
for patients with HCC undergoing LT. Notably, Milan criteria 
has been previously reported as a well-known predictor for 
HCC recurrence following transplantation (13). However, 
in the present study, results demonstrated that only 50% 
(10/20) of patients exceeding Milan criteria suffered relapse. 
Considering the lack of serum biomarker in Milan Criteria, 
iFISH-CTCs count may be a promising option.
To conclude, iFISH® platform presents an increased 
analytical sensitivity compared with the Cellsearch® platform 
and has the potential to be a dynamic monitoring tool for 
CTCs, whose level in peripheral circulation may be a prognostic marker for patients with HCC undergoing LT.
Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier analysis of RFS in patients with different level of iFISH-CTCs and AFP. (A) Patients with lower preoperative iFISH-CTC count 
(<5/7.5 ml) had increased RFS compared with those with iFISH‑CTC ≥5/7.5 ml (P<0.01). (B) Patients with AFP <400 IU/ml, patients with preoperative 
iFISH‑CTC count <5/7.5 ml had significantly increased RFS compared with those with iFISH‑CTC ≥5/7.5 ml (P<0.001). RFS, recurrence‑free survival; 
iFISH, immunostaining‑fluorescence in situ hybridization; CTCs, circulating tumor cells; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; AFP, α-fetoprotein.
Table III. Univariate analysis of factors predictive for RFS. Preoperative iFISH‑CTCs ≥5/7.5 ml and vascular invasion were 
prognostic factors for RFS.
