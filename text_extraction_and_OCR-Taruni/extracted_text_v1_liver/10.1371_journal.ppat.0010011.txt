Increased Fidelity Reduces Poliovirus Fitness
and Virulence under Selective Pressure in Mice

RNA viruses have high error rates, and the resulting quasispecies may aid survival of the virus population in the
presence of selective pressure. Therefore, it has been theorized that RNA viruses require high error rates for survival,
and that a virus with high fidelity would be less able to cope in complex environments. We previously isolated and
characterized poliovirus with a mutation in the viral polymerase, 3D-G64S, which confers resistance to mutagenic
nucleotide analogs via increased fidelity. The 3D-G64S virus was less pathogenic than wild-type virus in poliovirusreceptor transgenic mice, even though only slight growth defects were observed in tissue culture. To determine
whether the high-fidelity phenotype of the 3D-G64S virus could decrease its fitness under a defined selective pressure,
we compared growth of the 3D-G64S virus and 3D wild-type virus in the context of a revertible attenuating point
mutation, 2C-F28S. Even with a 10-fold input advantage, the 3D-G64S virus was unable to compete with 3D wild-type
virus in the context of the revertible attenuating mutation; however, in the context of a non-revertible version of the
2C-F28S attenuating mutation, 3D-G64S virus matched the replication of 3D wild-type virus. Therefore, the 3D-G64S
high-fidelity phenotype reduced viral fitness under a defined selective pressure, making it likely that the reduced
spread in murine tissue could be caused by the increased fidelity of the viral polymerase.

Introduction
RNA viruses have the highest replicative error rates in
nature, with approximately one mistake made per 1,000–
100,000 nucleotides copied [1–3]. As a result, each viral
genome is likely to differ from every other virus by one or
more point mutations. The complex populations thus
generated, called quasispecies, have been hypothesized to be
important for survival of the population as a whole in the
presence of selective pressure, under which a few viruses that
contain beneficial mutations would survive and act as
founders for the next generation [1,4]. For example, viruses
with mutations that confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies would benefit the virus population as a whole under
selective pressure from the host immune response. However,
the vast majority of errors made during replication are
deleterious, resulting in debilitation of a high percentage of
the population. Therefore, RNA viruses live on the edge of
‘‘error catastrophe,’’ where the cost of deleterious mutations
is in dynamic balance with the benefit of adaptive mutations
[1,5,6].
A promising new class of antiviral drugs, RNA virus
mutagens, takes advantage of the cost of error catastrophe.
Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog mutagen, which is incorporated into the viral genome during replication and increases
error frequency by promiscuous base-pairing [3]. Ribavirin
debilitates the viral population over several rounds of
replication by causing accumulation of deleterious mutations
and error catastrophe [5]. Previously, we isolated a poliovirus
variant able to survive serial passage in ribavirin, and mapped
this phenotype to a single mutation in the viral polymerase,
3D-G64S [7]. The mechanism of ribavirin resistance in 3DG64S mutant poliovirus was shown to be due to increased
fidelity of RNA replication by showing that it has lower
reversion frequency at the resistance mutation for the antiviral compound guanidine [7], confers resistance to other
mutagens as well [7], by direct sequencing of viral genomes
[8], and by demonstration that the purified 3D-G64S poliovirus displays increased fidelity in solution that correlates in a
delayed conformational change before phosphoryl transfer
compared to the wild-type enzyme [8].
If a viral quasispecies is important to the survival either of
individual genomes or of the population during growth
under standard laboratory conditions, the higher fidelity of
3D-G64S virus should result in an attenuated phenotype.
Therefore, we wondered if the 3D-G64S virus would have
growth defects in tissue culture, a relatively simple environment, or in mice, a complex environment with many selective
pressures. Laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to
poliovirus infection; however, mice transgenic for the human
poliovirus receptor, CD155, are susceptible to injected
poliovirus [9–11]. When poliovirus receptor (PVR) mice are
given poliovirus by intramuscular (IM) injection in the leg,
animals develop paralysis and eventually die of paralytic
disease. Poliovirus inoculated by IM injection is thought to
traffic up the sciatic nerve, to the spinal cord, and then to the
brain [12,13], during which many different environments are
likely to play a role in its propagation.
In this study, we found that 3D-G64S poliovirus is less
pathogenic than wild-type virus in mice, but displays little

growth defect in tissue culture. This attenuation in mice was
at least partially due to the increased fidelity of the 3D-G64S
virus in the context of a defined selected pressure, since it was
unable to compete with 3D wild-type virus in the context of a
revertible attenuating point mutation. Therefore, we argue
that, in the face of the myriad selective pressures encountered
by poliovirus during murine infection, the decreased variability in the population generated by the relatively highfidelity 3D-G64S polymerase may be a distinct disadvantage
for the growth and spread of the mutant virus.
Results
3D-G64S Virus Is Less Pathogenic than Wild-Type Virus in
Mice
To test whether the pathogenicity of high-fidelity 3D-G64S
virus was comparable to that of wild-type virus in infected
animals, mice that express the human poliovirus receptor [9]
were inoculated by IM injection with 5 3 106 PFU (plaqueforming units), an amount slightly over the LD50 for these
animals [9]. Animals infected in this way develop symptoms
similar to poliomyelitis in humans [10]. First, animals display
lethargy, then weakness and paralysis in the inoculated leg,
then paralysis of both legs, followed quickly by death. For this
study, we monitored the time required for the first symptoms,
weakness and paralysis of the inoculated limb, to develop.
Figure 1 shows time courses for 48 mice inoculated with
either wild-type or 3D-G64S virus. The 3D-G64S-inoculated
animals developed disease significantly more slowly than
wild-type infected animals, and fewer animals succumbed to
disease (Figure 1). Therefore, the 3D-G64S virus is less
pathogenic than wild-type virus in mice.
Competition between 3D-G64S and Wild-Type Virus in
Mice
To test whether the decreased pathogenicity of the 3DG64S virus could be observed in mixed infections, we infected
PVR mice with mixtures of wild-type and 3D-G64S virus. A
1:2 ratio of wild-type:3D-G64S virus was chosen because, as
will be shown in subsequent figures, this ratio was required to
achieve equal RNA yields in mixed infections of HeLa cells. A
total of 2 3 107 total PFU of mixed virus were given as IM
injections and mice were sacrificed at the first sign of disease,
usually 3 or 4 d post-infection. To monitor the relative
accumulation of the mutant and wild-type RNAs of mixed
infections, we took advantage of the presence of an additional
BstBI restriction enzyme site engineered at the position of
the 3D-G64S mutation. As shown in Figure 2A, BstBI
digestion of end-labeled RT-PCR reaction products from
mixtures of wild-type and 3D-G64S RNAs is expected to
produce products of different sizes. For the sets of primers
used here, a 558-basepair (bp) fragment is produced from RTPCR analysis of wild-type RNA, and a 396-bp product from
3D-G64S RNA. Although this assay was not designed to
quantify the total amounts of these viral RNAs, it should
accurately determine their relative proportions within a
population. Inoculated leg muscles and brains were harvested
from mice infected with a mixture of wild-type and 3D-G64S
viruses, RNA was extracted, and the products of reverse
transcription, PCR amplification, end-labeling and BstBI
digestion were quantified. As shown in Figure 2B and
quantified in Figure 2E, both wild-type and 3D-G64S viruses
were able to replicate within the inoculated muscle tissue.
However, when products from brains were analyzed (Figures
2C and 2F), a distribution of outcomes was observed: in many
mice (69%), only the wild-type band was present (e.g., mice 1,
2, 4, 6); in some mice (22%), the 3D-G64S band was
predominately or exclusively present (e.g., mouse 5), and
only rarely (9%) were both bands present (e.g., mouse 7).
These results support two conclusions; first, 3D-G64S virus
has a defect in spreading to the brain following IM infection,
and second, because usually only one of the two viruses was
found in the brain, there is a bottleneck between the injection
site and the brain. This bottleneck to poliovirus spread has

PVR mice were given IM injections with 5 3 106 PFU of either the wildtype or 3D-G64S viruses and were monitored for symptoms of disease.

between 3D-G64S and wild-type viruses.

Attenuation of High-Fidelity Poliovirus
Synopsis
RNA viruses have the highest error rates in nature, resulting in the
likelihood that each virus differs from other viruses in the population
by one or more mutations. The consequence of this ‘‘infidelity’’ is
that the viral population as a whole, under selective pressure from
the immune system or antiviral drugs, may benefit from adaptive
changes in a subset of its members. Therefore, it has been theorized
that RNA viruses need high error rates to survive in complex
environments. We tested this hypothesis using a drug-resistant
poliovirus that contains a mutation in its polymerase that reduces
errors during replication. We found that this high-fidelity mutant
virus has reduced growth in mice, a complex environment where
mutations may be required for growth and spread within the
infected animal. At least part of this attenuation is likely due to the
high fidelity of this mutant virus, since it was unable to compete
with the low-fidelity version of the virus in the context of a defined
selective pressure. Therefore, it is likely that mutations do benefit
viral populations, especially in complex environments such as an
infected animal or human.

been observed previously in both humans [14,15] and in mice
[15] (J. K. Pfeiffer, unpublished data).
To ensure that both viruses were able to replicate and be
detected in the brain at the same time, intracerebral (IC)
inoculations were performed using a 1:1 input ratio of wildtype:3D-G64S virus. Samples from the brains of these mice
(Figures 2D and 2G) showed that both viruses were able to
replicate in the brain when inoculated into this tissue.
Therefore, the preferential spread of wild-type virus from
the infected muscle to the brain did not result from an
inability of 3D-G64S virus to replicate in murine brain tissue.

The decreased virulence of the high-fidelity 3D-G64S
mutant virus (Figure 1) could result from: (1) an advantage
conferred to the wild-type virus by the increased complexity

Attenuation of High-Fidelity Poliovirus

of its quasispecies population, or (2) a growth disadvantage
conferred to the 3D-G64S mutant virus by some other
property of the mutant polymerase than its increased fidelity.
To monitor the replication of high-fidelity 3D-G64S poliovirus in tissue culture, several kinds of viral growth assays
were performed. After infection of HeLa cell monolayers
with wild-type and 3D-G64S virus at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 10 PFU/cell, the growth curves of singlecycle infections were found to be indistinguishable (Figure
3A). Furthermore, when wild-type and 3D-G64S virus growth
was compared in plaque assays (Figure 3B), the plaques were
of similar size at all temperatures tested, indicating equivalent growth of the viruses for several rounds of replication in
HeLa cells.
To test for a defect in RNA accumulation in the 3D-G64S
mutant virus, we performed competition assays in HeLa cells
with wild-type and G64S mutant virus and monitored the
relative proportions of RNA after single-cycle infections. To
determine the sensitivity of the competition assay, plasmid
DNAs that contained wild-type and 3D-G64S cDNAs were
mixed at various ratios and the 3D polymerase coding regions
were amplified and end-labeled by PCR. The BstBI-digested
products from the wild-type and 3D-G64S genomes (Figure
2A) displayed equivalent intensities when obtained from a 1:1
mixture of wild-type and 3D-G64S mutant cDNAs (Figure
3C). At 1:10 input ratios, however, the bands derived from the
minority species were barely visible, and disappeared
altogether at 1:100 input ratios. Therefore, this assay is
capable of detecting both the wild-type and 3D-G64S-derived
products, as long as the input amounts are within 10-fold of
each other (Figure 3C). When the relative amounts of RNA
accumulation of wild-type and 3D-G64S virus from single and
mixed infections of HeLa cell monolayers were monitored, a
slight RNA accumulation defect for the 3D-G64S virus was
observed. As shown in Figure 3D, a 1:1 input ratio of the two
viruses displayed a decreased accumulation of 3D-G64S RNA
relative to that of wild-type. Using twice as much 3D-G64S
virus in the mixed infection equalized the bands (Figure 3D).
Therefore, although no defect was observed in viral growth
assays in HeLa cells, 3D-G64S virus displayed a slight RNA
accumulation defect during a single cycle of replication.
Viral growth in HeLa cells, however, may not mirror
replication capacity in murine cells, and subtle growth
defects may be more apparent in primary cells. Therefore,
we compared the growth of wild-type and 3D-G64S viruses in
mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) derived from PVR mice [9].
In single-cycle growth curves in these primary cells, 3D-G64S

in (C), and digested with BstBI. Control bands ‘‘uncut’’ and ‘‘mix’’ were

PFU/cell, respectively). Products were quantified by Phosphorimager and

Attenuation of High-Fidelity Poliovirus

virus showed slightly reduced accumulation at early time
points (Figure 4A), displaying 2- to 4-fold titer reduction
compared to wild-type virus at 3, 4, and 5 h post-infection.
Despite this slight growth defect in a single-cycle growth
curve, wild-type and 3D-G64S viruses displayed similar
plaque sizes in the PVR-MEF (Figure 4B). To test whether
this slight growth defect would prevent the 3D-G64S virus
from propagating during multiple passage in the PVR-MEF,
RNA from serially passaged mixtures of wild-type and G64S
virus was analyzed. PVR-MEF were inoculated with a 1:1 input
ratio of mutant:wild-type virus at high MOI (5–30 PFU/cell).
As shown in Figure 4C, the 3D-G64S and wild-type product
amounts were comparable over three rounds of serial
passage, indicating no significant growth defect exists for
the mutant virus in PVR-MEF even during multiple rounds of
infection. It should be noted that poliovirus replication is 10-
to 100-fold less efficient in MEF compared with HeLa cells
(Figures 3A, 4A and 4B); therefore, MEF represent a stringent
environment, where growth defects may be more apparent.
The fact that 3D-G64S virus matches the replication of wildtype virus in MEF indicates the mutant virus has only a slight
growth defect in cultured cells.
Effect of a Defined Selective Pressure on the Fitness of 3DG64S Mutant Virus: Characterization of the Selective
Pressure
The reduced pathogenesis of the 3D-G64S mutant virus
could result, as stated previously, from a growth defect or the
quasispecies restriction caused by increased polymerase
fidelity. In the latter case, the increased mutation rate in
the wild-type virus population would presumably aid in viral
spread in the diverse environments encountered during
spread through the animal. We do not know what these
diverse selection pressures might be; therefore, we chose to
exert a defined selective pressure on the viral mixtures of
wild-type and G64S mutant virus and inquire whether the
high-fidelity phenotype of the 3D-G64S virus became a
liability. Specifically, a single amino acid change (F28S) in
the coding region for poliovirus protein 2C is known to
confer temperature sensitivity to the virus in cell culture [16]
(J. K. Pfeiffer, unpublished data). We engineered two versions
of the F28S amino acid change: one version that contained a
single nucleotide substitution [2C-F28S(1m)], which should be
able to revert readily during propagation, and a second
version that contained three nucleotide substitutions [2CF28S(3m)], to reduce the probability of reversion to the wildtype codon (Figure 5). These two versions of the F28S
mutation were cloned into wild-type and 3D-G64S backgrounds and the resulting viruses were plaque-purified and
propagated at 32 8C, the permissive temperature. No differences in the rates of growth of viruses that contained the 2CF28S(1m) and 2C-F28S(3m) mutations were observed during
single-cycle infections in cell culture (J. K. Pfeiffer, unpublished data). As shown in Figure 5, the presence of either the
single-nucleotide (1m) or the three-nucleotide (3m) 2C-F28S
mutation did not change the ability of the 3D-G64S virus to
compete with virus that was wild-type at the 3D locus during
serial passage in HeLa cells.
To determine the effect of the 2C-F28S(1m) and 2CF28S(3m) mutations on pathogenesis and growth in mice, and
the role of the probability of genetic reversion in these
processes, we inoculated PVR mice intramuscularly with the

assay.

were harvested, and the virus was used to infect fresh cells at high MOI
(5–30 PFU/cell). This cycle was repeated a total of three times; BstBI
digestion assay products are shown for passages 1, 2, and 3 (P1, P2, P3),

three different mixtures of viruses, designated by their 2C
allele, depicted in Figure 5. The three mixtures were
generated as follows: wild-type, containing a 1:10 mixture of
wild-type and 3D-G64S virus; 2C-F28S(1m), containing a 1:10
mixture of 2C-F28S(1m) and 2C-F28S(1m)/3D-G64S virus; and
2C-F28S(3m), containing a 1:10 mixture of 2C-F28S(3m) and
2C-F28S(3m)/3D-G64S virus (Figure 6A). The ratio of 1:10
(wild-type: 3D-G64S) at the 3D locus was chosen to enhance
the detection of 3D-G64S-containing RNAs, should they
compete poorly with virus that was wild-type at the 3D
polymerase locus. 2-wk-old mice were inoculated by IM
injection with the three mixtures of viruses and neuropathological symptoms were monitored as a function of time.
Upon injection of 5 3 106 PFU, mice inoculated with virus
mixtures that were wild-type at the 2C locus showed
symptoms by the third day post-infection, whereas mice
inoculated with the 2C-F28S(1m) virus mixture showed a
small, but significant, delay in disease onset (Figure 6A). Even
more strikingly, the 2C-F28S(3m) virus mixture was found to
cause no disease at the input dose of 5 3 106 PFU (Figure 6A).
At higher doses, however, the 2C-F28S(3m) virus mixture
caused disease (Figure 6B).
We hypothesized that the 2C-F28S mutation is highly
attenuating, as shown by the profoundly reduced pathogenesis of the 2C-F28S(3m) virus mixture. However, because
the 2C-F28S(1m) mutations could readily revert to a wild-type
sequence, the 2C-F28S(1m) virus mixture caused much more
disease than the 2C-F28S(3m) mixture. To test this hypothesis, the viral RNAs present in muscle tissue from diseased
mice [wild-type and 2C-F28S(1m) from Figure 6A, and 2CF28S(3m) from Figure 6B] were amplified and sequenced in
the region of the 2C mutations. Portions of the resulting
chromatograms, as well as sequences obtained from RT-PCR
products of the viral RNAs in the input pools, are shown in
Figure 6C. As predicted, the sequences near the site of the
mutations at the 2C locus from the wild-type pool, and the
2C-F28S(3m) pool did not change during passage in the
mouse. However, virus isolated from mice infected with the
2C-F28S(1m) pool showed a high frequency of reversion to
wild-type sequence at the F28S(1m) codon (Figure 6C).
Therefore, the increased pathogenesis of the F28S(1m) virus
pool, relative to that of the F28S(3m) virus pool, was
accompanied by direct reversion of the F28S(1m) mutation,
implying that there was strong selective pressure for wildtype sequence at this codon.
Effect of a Defined Selective Pressure on the Fitness of 3DG64S Mutant Virus: Growth in Mouse Tissue
To ask whether the presence of the strong selective
pressure to revert the 2C-F28C mutation would decrease
the competitiveness of 3D-G64S virus, we analyzed the
relative ratios of 3D-G64S and wild-type RNA sequence at
the 3D locus by analysis of muscle samples from many of the
mice shown in Figure 6. For the mixture of viruses that were
wild-type at the 2C locus (Figure 7A), the 3D-G64S genomes
were more highly represented than genomes that were wildtype at the 3D locus, which was an expected result
considering the 10-fold excess of the 3D-G64S virus in the
inoculum. However, in the context of the ‘‘revertible’’
attenuating mutation, 2C-F28S(1m), the 3D-G64S products
were poorly represented in the resulting population (Figure
7B). However, in the presence of the ‘‘non-revertible’’ 2CF28S(3m) mutations, the 3D-G64S products were once again
well-represented in the population (Figure 7C). These results,
quantified in Figure 7D, argue that the high fidelity of the 3DG64S virus decreases its fitness in the presence of a defined
selective pressure, if errors introduced by the wild-type
polymerase can bring about escape from that pressure.
Discussion
It has been theorized that RNA viruses need high error
rates to survive in complex environments [1]. With the
isolation of a high-fidelity poliovirus, we were in a unique
position to address this hypothesis.
In tissue culture, we found a slight RNA accumulation
defect of 3D-G64S poliovirus in HeLa cells (Figure 3), which
may result from the decreased rate of nucleotide incorporation observed in reactions with purified 3D-G64S polymerase [8]. In murine embryo fibroblasts derived from PVRexpressing mice, a slight growth defect was also observed in
single-cycle infections (Figure 4A). Nevertheless, in both
HeLa cells and PVR-MEF, the 3D-G64S could compete with
wild-type virus over several rounds of serial passage (Figures 4
and 5). Our results differ from those of Arnold et al, where
population sequencing suggested the 3D-G64S virus could
not compete with wild-type virus even during one round of
competition passage [8]. We do not know the basis for this
discrepancy, but it could be due to differences in the virus
clones used, the method of detection, or the cell lines.
In mouse infections, the 3D-G64S virus was less pathogenic
Figure 5. Serial Passage Competition Assay in HeLa Cells for Mixtures of
Wild-Type and 3D-G64S Viruses Containing the 2C-F28S TemperatureSensitive Attenuating Mutation
One-to-one mixtures of 3D-G64S to WT virus containing the indicated
2C-F28S mutations were used to infect HeLa cells at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/
cell at 32 8C. At 12 h post-infection, cell-associated RNA and virus were
harvested, and the virus was titered to determine input for the next
passage. This cycle was repeated three to five times, and representative
gels of digestion products, with maps indicating the mutations at the 2C
locus in the mixtures of viruses that were wild-type and 3D-G64S at the
3D locus, are shown: (A) wild-type, (B) 2C-F28S(1m), (C) 2C-F28S(3m). X

Attenuation of High-Fidelity Poliovirus

than wild-type virus, as measured by the time of symptom
onset and the number of animals acquiring disease (Figure 1).
When mice were inoculated with a mixture of the wild-type
and 3D-G64S viruses, both were able to replicate in muscle
and both were capable of spreading to the brain, although
3D-G64S virus spread to the brain less often than wild-type
virus. Interestingly, we found that generally, only one of the
two input viruses was present in the brain of infected animals.
This so-called poliovirus ‘‘bottleneck effect’’ has been
observed before, both in mice and in humans [14,15]. Other
pathogens also encounter bottlenecks during spread within a
host. The plant RNA virus Cucumber mosaic virus undergoes
striking bottlenecks during spread within an infected plant
[17], and Salmonella strains and Pneumocystis carnii experience
bottlenecks during spread in rodents [18–20]. We will
describe the nature of the poliovirus bottleneck effect in
more detail in the future.
The virulence and growth defects of 3D-G64S poliovirus in
mice could be due to its enhanced fidelity or to the slight
growth defect documented here. To determine whether
enhanced fidelity could play a role in the fitness of poliovirus,
we competed 3D-G64S virus against virus that was wild-type
at the 3D locus in the context of a defined selective pressure,
a revertible attenuating point mutation in the viral 2C coding
region. Indeed, the 3D-G64S virus was unable to compete
with virus that was wild-type at the 3D locus in the presence
of a revertible version of the 2C mutation. This did not result
from a growth defect of the 3D-G64S virus, because, in the
absence of the 2C mutation, or in the presence of a nonrevertible version of the 2C mutation, the 3D-G64S-containing virus could compete well with virus that was wild-type at
the 3D polymerase locus (Figure 7).
The results presented here argue that a high-fidelity
poliovirus variant that contains the 3D-G64S mutation in
the coding region for its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is
less able to revert attenuating point mutations. Therefore, in
the context of known, harmful, mutations, a virus that is wildtype at the 3D polymerase locus is more fit than the higherfidelity 3D-G64S virus. Most of the mutations made during
viral growth are likely to be deleterious, and it is possible that
reversion of attenuating mutations is important for survival
of RNA viruses. However, why would it not be advantageous
for a virus to encode a higher-fidelity polymerase and simply
not to make so many errors in the first place?
Genetic change can be very rapid in the presence of a lowfidelity polymerase (Figure 6C). In a complex environment
such as within a mouse, the ability to generate a quasispecies
may allow virus populations to respond to the different
environments they encounter during spread between tissues
and in reaction to changing pressure of the host immune
Figure 6. Pathogenesis of Mixtures of Wild-Type and 3D-G64S Viruses
Containing the 2C-F28S Temperature-Sensitive Attenuating Mutation
PVR mice were injected intramuscularly with 5 3 106 (A) or 2 3 108 (B)
PFU of total virus. The viral inocula were 1/10 mixtures of the wild-type/
3D-G64S derivatives to allow 3D-G64S viruses a chance to compete. For
example, 2C-F28S(1m) was a mixture of 5 3 105 PFU of 2C-F28S(1m) and
4.5 3 106 PFU of 2C-F28S(1m)/3D-G64S, giving a total of 5 3 106 PFU. The
numbers of mice in each group, as designated by the identity of the 2C
allele, were: wild-type, 26 mice; 2C-F28S(1m), 32 mice; 2C-F28S(3m), 4
and 27 mice in (A) and (B), respectively. Asterisks denote time points
where statistically significant differences (p , 0.05, determined by twosample Student’s t-test, [d 2, 0.00125; d 3, 0.00125; d 4, 0.0112]) were
observed between 2C-F28S(1m) and wild-type viruses. (C) Sequence

each is shown.

Attenuation of High-Fidelity Poliovirus

response. In monkeys infected with a vaccine strain of
poliovirus, distinct mutations were observed to occur within
2 d post-infection, only to revert to the inoculated sequence
later in the course of disease [21]. Furthermore, HIV is known
to change its cell tropism from macrophage-tropic to T celltropic, during spread in many infected individuals [22–23]. It
would be interesting to determine whether the pathogenesis
of HIV is reduced by increasing the fidelity of its replicative
machinery. We have shown that, in the presence of a defined
selective pressure, the increased fidelity of the 3D-G64S
mutant virus decreases its fitness. Given the slight growth
defect of the 3D-G64S mutant virus, we further suggest that,
the decreased virulence of high-fidelity 3D-G64S mutant
poliovirus in the mouse is due, at least in part, to its relative
inability to generate variants suitable for the variety of
selection pressures faced during the normal course of
infection of a complex organism.
Materials and Methods
Cells, mice, and viruses. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 10% calf serum [24].
PVR mice expressing the human poliovirus receptor (CD155) from a
b-actin promoter were obtained from R. Andino (University of
California at San Francisco) [9]. Primary MEF were harvested from
PVR mice. Day 14–18 embryos were harvested, washed in phosphatebuffered saline, the heads and viscera were removed, and the body
was minced with a sterile razor blade. The slurry was trypsinized and
homogenized with a pipet for 10 min and then plated in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum. Experiments with MEF were performed between passages two
and five (see below). Mahoney serotype 1 poliovirus was grown from a
single plaque generated by transfection of the viral cDNA clone [25].
Individual plaques were grown into high-titer virus stocks by
infecting monolayers of HeLa cells at 37 8C. Plasmids that encoded
cDNAs for temperature-sensitive mutant viruses were transfected at
32 8C, and small plaques were picked 4 d later. In all cases, care was
taken to ensure that the specific infectivities were comparable to
wild-type plasmid cDNAs transfected at the same time. Multiple
individual plaques were chosen from the transfections and propagated for three cycles of infection at 32 8C to generate high-titer
stocks. The phenotypes of these stocks were then compared to those
of the original plaque isolates to ensure that no additional mutations
were acquired during propagation.
Plasmid construction. The 3D-G64S mutation in the viral 3Dcoding region was introduced by site-specific mutagenesis, which
added a BstBI restriction enzyme site (sense primer:
59ATTTTCTCCAAGTACGTTTCGAACAAAATTACTGAAGTG 39).
This BstBI-marked 3D-G64S derivative was engineered to contain
three nucleotide substitutions (GGT to TCG) to minimize reversion at
this site. A mutation in the 2C coding region, F28S, which confers
temperature sensitivity [16], was introduced into both the 3D-G64S
and wild-type poliovirus clones in two forms: one with nucleotide
substitution [TTC to TCC, termed 2C-F28S(1m)] and the other with
three nucleotide substitutions [TTC to AGT, termed 2C-F28S(3m)]. In
each case, the entire PCR-generated region was confirmed by
sequencing.
Tissue culture infections. For single-cycle viral growth curves, 2 3
106 HeLa cells or 23105 PVR-MEF were infected at 37 8C at an MOI of
10 PFU/cell, harvested at various times post-infection, and lysed by
repeated freeze-thawing. Cell-associated virus was quantified by plaque
assay on HeLa cell monolayers [7]. Each growth curve was performed at
least twice and results were similar in all replicates. For competition
experiments, as shown in Figure 3D, 23106 HeLa cells were infected at
an MOI of 0.1 or 10 PFU/cell with wild-type virus, 3D-G64S virus, or
both viruses, at varying ratios for 5 h at 37 8C. Cells were harvested and
RNA was extracted using TRIZOL (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California,
United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For serial
passage competition experiments shown in Figure 5, 23106 HeLa cells
were infected at 32 8C with a 1:1 mixture of wild-type and 3D-G64S
viruses at low MOI (0.1 PFU/cell). At 12 h post-infection, cell-associated
virus and RNA were harvested (as above), and the cycle was repeated
three to five times, titering the virus each time to determine input for
the next cycle. Serial passage experiments in PVR-MEF (Figure 4C)
were performed as above, except that 2 3 106 MEF were infected at a
high MOI (5–30 PFU/cell) at 37 8C, and cell-associated virus and RNA
were harvested at 6 h post-infection.
Mouse infections and tissue processing. All animal work was
performed according to protocols approved by the Stanford
University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. For
IM inoculations, 50 ll of virus was injected into the thigh muscle of
the right hind leg of mice that were 2–10 wk old, as indicated, using a
28–gauge needle. Before IC inoculations, 2-wk old animals were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 11 ll of a solution
containing 2.5% avertin/g animal weight. Once animals were unconscious, 20 ll of virus stock was injected into the cerebrum through the
right temple. Mice were observed for symptoms twice per day, and
were euthanized at the first sign of disease, weakness in the inoculated
limb, or, for IC-inoculated mice, ruffled fur and general lethargy.
Tissues, including the inoculated leg muscle, brain, or both, were
harvested and frozen at 80 8C until studied. Tissues were ground
into a fine powder under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle.
RNA was extracted from approximately 300 mg of total tissue using
TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the supplied protocol.
Reverse transcription-PCR digestion assay. RNA was reverse
transcribed using 5–10 lg of RNA per cDNA synthesis reaction using
Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and reverse primer
59ATAGGTTCCCAGAA GCCATTCTC39 for the 3D polymerasecoding region or 59CCATGTCGAACGCAGAGCGCCTGG39 for the
2C-coding region. Twenty percent of the reverse transcription
reaction was PCR amplified using 5 9CCGCATTTGGAAGTGGATCTACTCAGCAG3 9 and 5 9CCATGTCGAACGCAGAGCGCCTGG39 primers for the 2C-coding region and

primers 59GCTTCACCTGGTGAAAGCATTGTGATCG39 and
59ATAGGTTCCCAGAA GCCATTCTC39 primers for the 3D-coding
region. The 3D reverse primer was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Massachusetts, United
States), and 125 lCi [c32P] ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts, United States), and was used at a 1:5 ratio with the unlabeled 3D
reverse primer in PCR reactions. The PCR reactions contained 1 unit
Taq (Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States) and were done
according to the supplier protocol, using a buffer that contained 50
lM potassium glutamate, 20 lM potassium HEPES (pH 8.4), 3 lM
MgCl2 and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The PCR products were digested with
BstBI (New England Biolabs) at 65 8C for 3–16 h, and products were
ethanol-precipitated in the presence of glycogen (Invitrogen). Pellets
were resuspended in denaturing gel loading dye (80% formamide, 10
mM EDTA, 0.025% bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol, 0.1% SDS),
heated to 80 8C for 2 min, and loaded on gels that contained 7%
polyacrylamide and 8M urea. Gels were dried under vacuum on DE81
paper (Whatman, Florham Park, New Jersey, United States) and
exposed to PhosphorImager screens.
Sequence analysis. The cDNAs products from viral RNAs purified
using the QiaAmp kit (Qiagen) or from cDNA-encoding plasmids
were PCR-amplified for sequence analysis at the F28S locus. The PCR
reactions were performed as above, except that no radiolabel was
added. Products were run on 1% agarose gels and products were
excised, purified using the Qiaex II kit (Qiagen), and sequenced
commercially (Sequetech, Mountain View, California, United States).
