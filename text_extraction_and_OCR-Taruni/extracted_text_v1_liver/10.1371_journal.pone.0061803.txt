Abstract
Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with cardiovascular atherosclerosis independent of
classical risk factors. This study investigated the influence of NAFLD on autonomic changes, which is currently unknown.
Methods: Subjects without an overt history of cardiovascular disease were enrolled during health checkups. The subjects
diagnosed for NAFLD using ultrasonography underwent 5-min heart rate variability (HRV) measurements that was analyzed
using the following indices: (1) the time domain with the standard deviation of N-N (SDNN) intervals and root mean square
of successive differences between adjacent N-N intervals (rMSSD); (2) the frequency domain with low frequency (LF) and
high frequency (HF) components; and (3) symbolic dynamics analysis. Routine blood biochemistry data and serum leptin
levels were analyzed. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was measured.
Results: Of the 497 subjects (mean age, 46.2 years), 176 (35.4%) had NAFLD. The HRV indices (Ln SDNN, Ln rMSSD, Ln LF,
and Ln HF) were significantly decreased in the NAFLD group (3.51 vs 3.62 ms, 3.06 vs 3.22 ms, 5.26 vs 5.49 ms2, 4.49 vs 5.21
ms2
, respectively, all P,0.05). Ln SDNN was significantly lower in the NAFLD group after adjustment for age, sex,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, body mass index, smoking, estimated glomerular filtration rate, HOMA-IR,
and leptin (P,0.05). In the symbolic dynamic analysis, 0 V percentage was significantly higher in the NAFLD group (33.8% vs
28.7%, P = 0.001) and significantly correlated with linear HRV indices (Ln SDNN, Ln rMSSD, and Ln HF).
Conclusions: NAFLD is associated with decreased Ln SDNN and increased 0 V percentage. The former association was
independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors and serum biomarkers (insulin resistance and leptin). Further risk
stratification of autonomic dysfunction with falls or cardiovascular diseases by these HRV parameters is required in patients
with NAFLD.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) refers to a spectrum
of liver disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. [1] The clinical
implications of NAFLD stem from its high prevalence, ranging
from 10% to 30%, and the potential to progress to liver cirrhosis,
hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. [2] In Taiwan, the
prevalence of NAFLD is 11.5–41% in the adult population, [3]
and NAFLD is emerging as an important public health issue
worldwide.
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e61803

The pathogenesis of NAFLD mainly involves insulin resistance
and hyperleptinemia, which are also related to atherosclerosis and
autonomic changes. [4] Unsurprisingly, cardiovascular disease
(CVD) is one of the major causes of death in patients with
NAFLD. [5] The association of NAFLD with both carotid and
coronary atherosclerosis has been reported to be independent of
the classical risk factors for CVD. [6,7] Conversely, the effect of
NAFLD on autonomic changes measured by heart rate variability
(HRV) has not been reported. HRV is used widely to assess
cardiac autonomic function because of its noninvasiveness and
high repeatability. [8] We hypothesized that NAFLD was
associated with HRV changes independent of conventional
cardiovascular risk factors and serum biomarkers (insulin resistance and leptin). We therefore performed this study to evaluate
this issue.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
Subjects without an overt history of CVD were enrolled during
health checkups at the Far Eastern Poly Clinic from March to
November 2011. The exclusion criteria were: past history of CVD
(coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart
failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional and class,
cerebral vascular disease), arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, premature bigeminy, or trigeminy), pacemaker implant, use of drugs
influencing the autonomic system (clonidine, methyldopa, tricyclic
antidepressants, scopolamine, antiarrhythmic drugs), hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism with treatment, thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) levels .10 or ,0.01 mIU/mL, hemoglobin levels
,10 g/dL, or renal insufficiency with estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) ,60 mL?min21?
1.73 m22. We defined the
group of subjects with NAFLD as the NAFLD group and the
group of subjects without NAFLD as the control group. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of National Taiwan
University Hospital. All patients signed the written informed
consent.
Clinical and Laboratory Assessments
Blood pressure was measured after the subjects had rested for
5 min while sitting. Waist circumference was measured at the
midpoint between the lower rib and the iliac crest at the end of
a normal expiration while the subjects were standing. The body
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2
). After
subjects had fasted for at least 8 h, a blood sample was drawn for
analysis of levels of fasting blood glucose and hemoglobin, serum
leptin, and plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-
cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV antibody, creatinine,
and insulin. Fasting serum insulin levels were measured by an
immunochemiluminometric assay (ADVIA Centaur insulin assay,
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostic Inc., Tarrytown, NY, USA).
Insulin resistance was calculated by the homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index) using the
following formula: fasting insulin (mU/mL) level 6fasting glucose
level (mmol/L)/22.5. Serum leptin level was measured by ELISA
using commercial kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Human Leptin ELISA kit [K1005-1], B-Bridge international,
Inc., Cupertino CA, USA). The inter-assay and intra-assay
coefficients of variation of assays were #10%. The eGFR
(mL?min21
?1.73 m22) was calculated using the Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula: 1866(serum creatinine)–
1.1546(age)–0.20360.742 (if female).
Definition of NAFLD
Liver ultrasonography was used to assess the presence of
NAFLD. Steatosis was diagnosed based on the presence 1 of the 3
criteria: (1) diffusely increased liver echogenicity with evident
contrast between the liver and kidney; (2) diffusely increased liver
echogenicity with blurring of the intrahepatic vessels or the
diaphragm; (3) bright liver echogenicity with poor penetration of
the posterior hepatic segment and intrahepatic vessels or invisibility of the diaphragm. [9] To exclude other causes of liver
disease, the subjects with a weekly intake of alcohol .70 g in
women and .140 g in men, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and use of
drugs that may induce fatty liver (steroid, amiodarone, estrogen,
methotrexate, valproic acid) were excluded from the NAFLD
group. [10,11].
Definition of Metabolic Syndrome
We used the criteria for the metabolic syndrome proposed by
the Third Adult Treatment Panel of National Cholesterol
Education Program (NCEP-ATP III). [12] In this study, the
defining level of waist circumference was changed to a waist
circumference of .90 cm in men and .80 cm in women
according to the Asia-Pacific guidelines for managing obesity.
[13] Metabolic syndrome was defined clinically, based on the
presence of 3 or more of the following: (1) central obesity (waist
circumference: men, .90 cm, women, .80 cm, in Asia); (2) a high
triglyceride level (.150 mg/dL) or drug treatment for high
triglycerides; (3) a low HDL-cholesterol level (men, ,40 mg/dL;
women, ,50 mg/dL) or drug treatment for low HDL-cholesterol;
(4) high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure $130 mm Hg or
diastolic blood pressure $85 mm Hg) or antihypertensive drug
treatment; (5) a high fasting plasma glucose concentration
(.100 mg/dL) or drug treatment for type 2 diabetes.
Definition of Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus
Hypertension was defined by systolic blood pressure $140 mm
Hg or diastolic blood pressure $90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive
drug treatment. Diabetes mellitus was defined by fasting glucose
levels .126 mg/dL, postprandial glucose level .200 mg/dL, or
drug treatment for type 2 diabetes.
Definition of Dyslipidemia
Dyslipidemia was defined based on the presence of $3 of the
following: (1) a high triglyceride level (.150 mg/dL) or drug
treatment for high triglycerides; (2) a high LDL-cholesterol level
(.130 mg/dL) or drug treatment for high LDL; (3) a low HDLcholesterol level (men, ,40 mg/dL; women, ,50 mg/dL) or on
drug treatment for low HDL-cholesterol.
Measurement of HRV
All subjects underwent 5-min HRV measurements in the supine
position in the same room with a fixed room temperature after
they had rested for at least 5 min. Recordings were performed
using a 24-h ambulatory ECG Holter recording (MyECG E3-80,
Mircostar Company, Taipei, Taiwan). An automated algorithm
was used for annotating each of the digitalized 1 h ECG data;
technicians carefully inspected and corrected the annotated file to
enable extraction of the RR intervals.

Time Domain and Frequency Domain Analysis of HRV
In accordance with the recommendations of the European
Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing
Electrophysiology, [8] HRV was analyzed by the following indices:
(1) the time domain with the standard deviation of N-N (SDNN)
intervals and root mean square of successive differences between
adjacent N-N intervals (rMSSD); and (2) the frequency domain
with the low frequency (LF: 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high frequency
(HF: 0.15–0.4 Hz) components.
Symbolic Dynamics of HRV
Briefly, consecutive RR interval sequences of at least 300 were
selected. Patients with RR interval sequences ,300 were
excluded. The full range of the sequences was divided into 6
levels (from 0 to 5), and patterns of length L = 3 were constructed.
[14] The Shannon entropy of the pattern distributions was
calculated to evaluate the complexity of the pattern distribution.
[14] All possible patterns were classified into 3 families referred to
as: (1) patterns with no variation (0 V; all 3 symbols were equal); (2)
patterns with 1 variation (1 V; 2 consequent symbols were equal
and the remaining symbol was different); and (3) patterns with 2
variations (2 V; all symbols were different from the previous one).
The percentage of the patterns 0 V, 1 V, and 2 V were calculated.

Statistical Analysis
Based on the report on HRV in patients with metabolic
syndrome [15], a sample of 326 participants (163 in each arm) was
needed to provide power of at least 90% to detect a significant
difference of Ln SDNN between NAFLD and control groups using
a 2-sided statistical significance level of P.05, assuming the mean of
3.28, standard deviation of 0.52 in the NAFLD group and mean of
3.46, standard deviation of 0.48 in the control group.
The results are given as mean 6SD or number. The clinical
characteristics of the patients were compared by Student’s t test for
continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables.
P,0.05 was considered statistically significant. Because the
distribution of the HRV indices was skewed to the right, the
indices were natural logarithm (ln)-transformed, and a normal
distribution was confirmed by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov goodness-of-fit test (P.0.15). The relationship of NAFLD and HRV
indices was investigated by a general linear regression model.
P,0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 (Chicago, IL,
USA).
Results
Characteristics and Clinical Parameters of Study
Population
A total of 497 subjects, including 176 men and 321 women aged
18–80 years (mean, 46.2 years), were enrolled for final analysis.
There were 176 (35.4%) subjects with NAFLD, and 57 (11.5%)
subjects with metabolic syndrome. Compared with the subjects in
the control group, subjects in the NAFLD group had higher age,
number of men who smoked cigarettes, BMI, waist circumference,
systolic and diastolic blood pressure and higher levels of AST,
ALT, GGT, total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol,
creatinine, eGFR, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR,
and leptin (all P,0.05). Subjects in the control group had higher
HDL-cholesterol levels (P,0.05). These 2 groups were comparable in TSH, frequency of diabetes, and beta blocker use (all
P.0.05, Table 1).
Time Domain and Frequency Domain of HRV
The HRV indices of time and frequency domain (Ln SDNN,
Ln rMSSD, Ln HF, and Ln HF) were significantly decreased in
the NAFLD group (all P,0.05, Table 2). These HRV indices were
significantly correlated with clinical parameters, insulin resistance,
and leptin (only Ln SDNN is shown Table 3). In general linear
regression analysis after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, liver function, metabolic syndrome, body mass
index, smoking, eGFR, HOMA-IR, and leptin, NAFLD was only
negatively associated with Ln SDNN (P,0.05) rather than with Ln
rMSSD, Ln HF, and Ln LF.
Symbolic Dynamics of HRV
After excluding the patients with RR interval sequences ,300,
486 patients underwent symbolic analysis and Shannon entropy
calculation (170 in the NAFLD group and 316 in the control
group). The 0 V and Shannon entropy were significantly
correlated with clinical parameters (Table 3). In the symbolic
dynamic analysis, the 0 V percentage was significantly higher in
the NAFLD group (33.8% vs 28.7%, P = 0.001). 1 V percentage, 2
V percentage, and Shannon entropy were similar in the 2 study
groups (Table 4). 0 V was also significantly correlated with linear
HRV indices (Ln SDNN, Ln rMSSD, and Ln HF, Table 5). In the
multiple regression analysis after adjustment for the age, sex, ALT,
fasting glucose levels, hypertension, and total cholesterol levels, 0 V
was positively associated with the presence of the metabolic
syndrome (P,0.05) rather than with NAFLD.
Discussion
Our study is the first to demonstrate that NAFLD is associated
with autonomic changes evaluated by HRV index. Newton et al.
demonstrated cardiac autonomic dysfunction presenting as orthostatic hypotension and a relative nocturnal hypotension in patients
with NAFLD. [16] However, there was only 34 subjects in each
NAFLD and control groups [16].

as a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and insulin
resistance plays a role in both conditions. [1,11] The components
of the metabolic syndrome exert sympathetic activation, [15] and
several studies have shown the association between the metabolic
syndrome and decreased HRV. [15,18,19] Our study also showed
that the NAFLD group had a greater frequency of the metabolic
syndrome and lower HOMA-IR than the control group.
Nevertheless, we demonstrated that NAFLD was associated with
autonomic changes (decreased Ln SDNN) independent of
traditional CVD risk factors, components of the metabolic
syndrome, and HOMA-IR in the present study.
In addition to insulin resistance, the pathogenesis of NAFLD
also involves hyperleptinemia, which is also related to atherosclerosis and autonomic changes. [4] Leptin is a hormone that
regulates appetite and metabolism. [20] In recent years, leptin has
been found to have many biological effects on various systems and
may be the signal that integrates vascular, metabolic, and
neuroendocrine responses. [21] Plasma leptin levels have been
positively associated with cardiovascular complications in humans,
[22,23] and this effect has been observed independent of BMI and
traditional cardiac risk factors. [24] Hyperleptinemia is also
associated with coronary atherosclerosis, as measured by coronary
artery calcium, and this association is independent of insulin
resistance. [25] According to Machado et al., leptin level increases
progressively with increasing severity of hepatic steatosis. [26]
Increasing plasma leptin concentrations are associated with a shift
of the sympathovagal balance toward a progressive increase in
sympathetic activation. [4] Our study also showed that the
NAFLD group had higher plasma leptin levels than the control.
However, we also demonstrated that NAFLD was associated with
autonomic changes (decreased Ln SDNN) independent of the
plasma leptin level in the present study. NAFLD has been shown
to have an independent relationship with sub-clinical inflammation. [27] Increased heart rate and reduced HRV are also
associated with subclinical inflammation. [28] Therefore, the
autonomic changes in NAFLD may be the consequence of
subclinical inflammation and increased oxidative stress. Further
studies are needed to validate this causal relationship.
The Association of NAFLD and Symbolic Dynamics
Analysis of HRV
The standard linear HRV methods of analysis do not seem
adequate to study any short-term instability that may precede
major arrhythmias, [14,29] probably because of the presence of
only brief and transient instabilities in the RR interval dynamics
[14,30] that therefore led to controversial results. [14,29,31,32]
Guzzetti et al. have proposed a nonlinear method of HRV analysis
(3-beat symbolic dynamic analysis) to quantify the prevalence of
sympathetic or parasympathetic cardiac modulation in conditions
in which the use of a linear HRV approach is limited or disputed.
[14] An increase in sympathetic activity results in an increase in
0 V percentage. [14] Our results showed that 0 V percentage was
significantly higher in the NAFLD group than in the control
group. 0 V percentage was also negatively associated with Ln
SDNN in this study. Therefore, both linear and non-linear HRV
parameters (Ln SDNN decrease and 0 V percentage increase)
indicated activation of sympathetic tones in patients with NAFLD.
Conversely, symbolic analysis of 3 beat sequences considers the
different time course of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac
modulations and seems appropriate for elucidating the neural
pathophysiological changes in patients with NAFLD. [14]
However, 0 V was significantly associated with the presence of
the metabolic syndrome rather than with NAFLD in the multiple
regression analysis. Therefore, symbolic dynamic analysis can be
used for further risk stratification for NAFLD with the metabolic
syndrome.
Clinical Implications
A history of falls is common in NAFLD (43%). [33] Compared
with controls, the proportion of people with recurrent falls is
significantly higher in NAFLD groups with injuries, emergency
medical attention, fracture rates, and hospital admissions. [33]
Falls and the aforementioned associations are unrelated to the
presence of diabetes or the severity of liver disease. [33] Falls are
also considered to be a direct consequence of autonomic nervous
system dysfunction. On the other hand, a decrease in SDNN has
been reported to be associated with increased overall and
cardiovascular mortality in the general population. [34,35]
Symbolic dynamic analysis has been used for the studying short
HRV instabilities preceding sudden cardiac death. [36] Our study
has demonstrated changes in these parameters in NAFLD.
Therefore, further risk stratification of autonomic dysfunction
with falls [33] or CVD [37,38] by these HRV parameters should
be studied in patients with NAFLD.
According to the report from Dogru T et al, the circulating
levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are increased in
male subjects with biopsy proven NAFLD. [39] The increase of
ADMA is independent from traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
[39] Li Volti G et al. have proposed a link between ADMA and
endothelial dysfunction in db/db mice. After treatment with
silibinin in db/db mice, the plasma level of ADMA reduced. The
reduction in ADMA level was associated with the improvement of
insulin resistance. [40] ADMA has also been reported to evoke
sympathetic activation in rat model. [41] Taken together, ADMA
may have a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, endothelial
dysfunction and sympathetic activation. Further researches are
warranted to elucidate the connection. Both ADMA and HRV
parameters may be regarded as early markers of cardiovascular
disease.
Study Limitations
Our findings have some limitations. First, the design of the study
was cross-sectional design; therefore, a causal relationship between
NAFLD and changes in HRV parameters could not be
demonstrated. Second, NAFLD was defined by ultrasonic
examination rather than by tissue biopsy. However, routine tissue
biopsy for NAFLD was not feasible in clinical practice.
