Summary 
During the last decade, the cost of DNA sequencing technologies has decreased several orders of magnitude, with the
proportional increase of speed and throughput. Human
Genome Project took almost 15 years to complete the
sequence of the human genome. With the second and third
generation technologies, this can be done in the matter of
days or hours. This progress and availability of sequencing
instruments to virtually every researcher leads to replacing of
many techniques with DNA sequencing and opens new venues of research. DNA sequencing is used to investigate basic
biological phenomena, and is probably going to be increasingly used in the context of health care (preimplantation
diagnostics, oncology, infectious diseases). Current trends
are aiming towards the price of 1000$ for sequencing of one
human genome. Without any doubt, we can expect improvement of existing and the development of fourth generation
technologies in the coming years.

302 Gu`vi}: The history of DNA sequencing
Introduction
»....sequencing DNA now is one of the easiest
jobs you could have besides sloppin’ burgers« Kary
Mullis (1)
During the last decade we have witnessed rapid
development of new sequencing technologies and
their applications. Interestingly enough, this progress
practically started after the completion of the se -
quencing of the human genome. The first sequence
of the human genome was obtained using so called
»first generation« sequencing technology. In the following years, »second« or »next generation« sequencing (NGS) technologies were developed, characterized by massive parallelization, improved automation
and speed, and, most importantly, greatly reduced
price. While »next generation« approaches were
being improved, the »third« or »next-next generation«
technologies appeared, this time characterized by single-molecule sequencing (SMS). Very often, expressions like »deep sequencing«, »massive parallel
sequencing« (MPS), »high throughput sequencing«
(HTS or HT-Seq) are used for »second« and »third«
generation technologies. Some of these technologies
were abandoned, some are still being developed or
improved, while other are now routinely used in the
laboratories around the world. The aim of this article
is to provide overview of the development and
description of key sequencing technologies, as well as
the explanation of key terms.
First generation sequencing
The first two widely-known methods for DNA
sequencing appeared in 1977. One, known as »che -
mical cleavage« sequencing, was published in Fe -
bruary by Maxam and Gilbert (2). The second, known
as »chain terminator« sequencing, »dideoxy« sequen -
cing or »Sanger« sequencing, was published in De -
cember by Sanger and collaborators (3). Interestingly,
these works were culmination of both groups’ active
work on determination of the sequence of nucleic
acids (4–6). Both approaches rely on the separation
of the mixture of DNA fragments of various sizes on
polyacrylamide (PAA) slab gels.
»Chemical cleavage« sequencing
In this approach (2), DNA fragment that is to be
sequenced could be obtained by, for example, restriction digestion of plasmid and subsequent electrophoretic separation and isolation of desired fragment. Fragment is 5’ or 3’ terminally labelled with 32P
using alkaline phosphatase and polynucleotide kinase
(5’ labelling) or terminal transferase (3’ labelling).
Since both 5’ or 3’ termini are labelled, double
stranded fragment is denatured, single strands separated on PAA gel and isolated, thereby enabling
sequencing of each strand (Figure 1.A).
For each strand, aliquots of the four cleavage
reactions are prepared. Single-stranded (ss)DNA is
first chemically modified, causing creation of abasic
site(s), and exposing the backbone that is subsequently easily broken by alkali treatment. For chemical modification, base- or pyrimidine-/purine-specific
reagents are used. Chemical reactions are optimized
to ensure random modification and cleavage along
the ssDNA (i.e. the conditions are mild), thereby generating a mixture of single-stranded fragments of various sizes. Finally, cleaved 32P-ssDNA is separated on
denaturing PAA gel. The sequence is read from an
autoradiograph of the gel. Each fragment ends with
the site of cleaved base, which is being read from bottom to the top of the gel. In the original publication,
each set of four cleavage reactions was run at least
twice on the PAA gel. One run was short, enabling
reading of short fragments, while additional, longer
run, enabled reading of longer fragments. The length
of se quen ced fragment depended on the size of the
PAA gel, and authors reported that they could
sequence fragments up to 100 bp.
Although the authors have devised ways to perform base-specific cleavage, the final protocol suggests using conditions that modify two bases (albeit
not with the same preference). This approach generates redundant fragments in different chemical cleavage reactions, which serves as in-experiment control.
For example, dimethyl-sulfate causes methylation of
adenine (A) and guanine (G), with G being methylated faster. Methylation destabilizes N-glycosidic bond,
and the DNA strand can be broken upon treatment
with alkali. After separation on the PAA gel, a pattern
of dark and light bands can be seen. Dark bands arise
from breakage of G, and light bands from breakage
of A. However, gentle treatment of methylated DNA
with diluted acid releases preferentially A, leading to
appearance of easily distinguishable dark A bands
and light G bands. Similarly, treatment with hydrazine
and piperidine releases thymines (T) and cytosines
(C). Alternatively, the addition of NaCl into the reaction would cause release of C only (Figure 1.A).
This sequencing approach was not widely used,
due to two major drawbacks. One is the use of hazardous chemicals (e.g. hydrazine is neurotoxin). The
other is the fact that a lot of DNA is needed, which,
with the need to have four or even eight reactions,
could pose significant problem. Still, this approach
could be a method of choice for sequencing of very
short fragments, or when design of adequate
primer(s) for sequencing is problematic.
»Sanger« sequencing
In 1977. the team of F. Sanger published the
almost complete sequence of the genome of bacteriophage FX174 (7), using previously developed
»plus and minus« sequencing (8). Later that year, sim-

to cause breaking of DNA strand

Mild conditions of chemical

the example of such gel. If four

to run fragments labelled with

Knowing the sequence of the

1) Template DNA is fragmented
and adapters are attac hed. After
generation of ssDNA library, single strands are attac hed to the
beads. 2) Beads are enclosed in
PCR microreactors in water/oil
emulsion, thus enabling clonal
amplification of bound fragment. 3), 4) Beads carrying
clonally amplified template
ssDNA are deposited in the wells

304 Gu`vi}: The history of DNA sequencing
pler and more rapid »chain terminator« sequencing
method was published (3), and, shortly after, the
com plete sequence of 5,368 bp long FX174
genome was determined using the new method (9),
representing the first DNA genome ever sequenced.
Unlike »chemical cleavage« method, in Sanger’s
approach DNA was synthesized using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment)-mediated extension of
oligonucleotide primer, with ssDNA being a template.
Single-stranded DNA was divided in 4 aliquots. Each
reaction contained DNA polymerase, a primer, and
mixture of four deoxyribonucleotide-triphosphates
(dNTPs), of which three (e.g. 32P-dATP, dCTP, dGTP)
were in equimolar concentration and fourth (e.g.
dTTP) in 20 times lower concentration. In addition,
the 2’,3’-dideoxy analogue of the fourth dNTP (e.g.
ddTTP) was added in excess. Since ddNTPs lack 3’-
OH group, the synthesis of DNA chain is terminated
upon incorporation of ddNTP (hence the name of the
method; Figure 1.B.4). The presence of both dNTP
and ddNTP enables synthesis of chains of different
lengths (Figure 1.B.1,6). Separation of four reactions,
containing denatured 32P-ssDNA, on the adjacent
lanes of denaturing PAA gel and subsequent analysis
of autoradiograph enabled reading of the sequence,
similar to Maxam-Gilbert method. Initially, authors
were able to read the sequence of up to 300 bp.
This method also had its difficulties. Short mono -
nucleotide repeats were hard to interpret, as the bands
were often not separated and correct reading of the
sequence mostly depended on the experience of the
operator. Furthermore, sometimes artefacts appeared
on the PAA gel, most likely originating from the conformers of the ssDNA. These difficulties were alleviated by introduction of thinner PAA gels (10), enabling
runs at higher voltages (and thereby generating higher temperatures) and requiring less material, finally
resulting in sharper bands. Later introduction of silver
staining of PAA gels (11–13) and fluore scent dyes
(see below) eliminated the use of radioactive isotopes.
Due to its simplicity and reliability, »chain terminator« sequencing quickly became dominant method
for sequencing. Its automated adaptation was used in
all major sequencing enterprises, as, for example,
sequencing of human mitochondrial genome (14),
the first bacterial ge nome, Haemophilus influenzae
(15), the first eukaryotic genome, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (16), the first multicellular animal genome,
Caenorhabditis elegans (17), the first plant genome,
Arabidopsis thaliana (18), and culminating with the
sequencing of genomes of Drosophila melanogaster
(19, 20) and human (21–24). Even nowadays, automated »chain terminator« sequencing is frequently
used for small-scale targeted resequencing.
Automation of »Sanger« sequencing
As mentioned before, the potential of »Sanger«
sequencing was quickly realized by the research community. This motivated a number of researchers to
work on automation of the procedure. The most
prominent were L. Hood and M. Hunkapiller, associated with Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI). In the first
report (25), they offered two major improvements –
labelling of DNA with fluorescent dyes and computerbased acquisition and analysis of the sequence data.
The instrument that was developed (and that would
soon become model ABI 370) contained PAA gel
with 16 lanes. Instead of radioactive isotopes, DNA
primers were labelled with fluorescent dyes. Initially,
one dye was used for all reactions, which required
running of four reactions in adjacent lanes of the gel
(Figure 1.B.5,6). Later, different dye for each of the
four sequencing reactions was used (Figure 1.B.2,6).
This enabled running all reactions in one lane of the
gel, thus greatly improving throughput. Excited by
laser, the fluorescence was detected, in real time,
close to the bottom of the gel. In both »one dye« and
»four dyes« configuration, four electropherograms or
chromatograms were obtained, that, when superimposed, produced the sequence of the analyzed fragment (Figure 1.B.6). Using one dye, authors could
sequence around 400 bp, and with four dyes around
200 bp. In order to ensure the reliability of sequence
determination, authors suggested sequencing of both
strands.
The problem with »one dye« configuration was
that different mobility of bands in adjacent lanes
made it difficult for computer to assemble the
sequence (25). This problem was partially alleviated
by use of four dyes and running the reactions in the
same lane. Some mobility shifts between different
dyes (1 – 1.25 bp) were observed, and were later
compensated by adding linkers between the dye and
the primer, and by modification of the analysis software (25). Further improvements of the automation
came from introducing of dye-labelled ddNTPs (26),
which made possible to perform four reactions in one
tube (Figure 1.B.3), and from introducing capillaries
(27) instead of slab gels (Figure 1.B.6). 
Over the next two decades, ABI sequencers
were significantly improved (28–33). The number of
lanes in PAA gel-based models increased from 16
(ABI 370A) to 96 (ABI 377). The first capillary
sequencer was model ABI 310, with one capillary,
and the model 3730xl had 96 capillaries. At the same
time, the length of the reads increased from 350 (ABI
370A) to over 900 (ABI 3730xl), while the run times
decreased from 18h to 3h. The introduction of model
3730 increased the speed of the sequencing of the
human genome.
The major drawbacks are the price per base and
the problems related to cloning and sequencing of
regions containing repetitive sequences (34). Inte -
restingly, in the dawn of »next generation« sequencing, scientist from the J. Craig Venter Institute used
automated »dideoxy« sequencing to sequence the
diploid genome of a human individual (J.C. Venter
himself), using the ABI sequencer 3730xl (24), most

likely the last human genome ever to be sequenced
using »Sanger« sequencing.
Sequencing by hybridization (SBH)
SBH can be considered as a sequencing
approach between »first« and »second« generation,
because the core of the idea included massive parallelization. It was developed by a team of Serbian scientists in the early 1990’s (35, 36). The idea was to
determine the oligonucleotide content of the template DNA chain by hybridizing it with short (5-25 bp)
oligonucleotides (37). By aligning of overlapping
oligonucleotides (of known sequence) that hybridized
with the template DNA, one could reconstruct its
sequence. The method was envisaged to have two
formats: first, where the template DNA is immobilized
on solid surface, while labelled short oligonucleotides
of known sequence are used to query the template,
and second, where short oligonucleotides of known
sequence are arrayed onto solid surface, while
labelled test-DNA is offered as a probe (Figure 1.C).
Stringent hybridization conditions are essential factor
in the procedure, since no mismatches are allowed.
Obviously, the read length corresponds to the length
of the used oligonucleotides. Each queried base is
interrogated by several overlapping oligonucleotides,
providing internal control of sequencing. Using this
approach, authors were able to reliably sequence
fragments of 100 and 340 bp (38, 39).
Although the method was suggested to have the
potential to be used for large-scale sequencing, there
are some drawbacks that most likely prevented this
approach to be widely used. The number of oligonucleotides required for complete sequencing depends
on their length and can be very high (4n for n-mer,
e.g. for octamer 48 = 65356). Furthermore, hybri -
dization and wash conditions that retain only perfectly matched hybridizations are not easy to optimize,
with, for example, end-mismatched duplexes being
the particular problem. In addition, when short oligo -
nucleotides were used to sequence longer fragments,
there was a high chance of getting branching points
in the final assembly, leading to multiple possible output sequences. Finally, this approach also has no
good solution for dealing with repetitive sequences.
On the other hand, SBH can be used for targeted
resequencing of short fragments, or high-throughput
typing of known mutations or SNPs (40). The potential of this approach is also illustrated by the fact that
SBH inspired development of novel sequencing
methodologies in the last few years (41, 42).
Second generation sequencing
The key feature of »next generation« sequencing methodologies is parallelization of high number of
sequencing reactions. This was achieved by miniaturization of sequencing reactions. In addition, detection
systems were greatly improved. The time needed to
determine the Gbp-sized sequences was reduced to
hours or days, with the accompanying price reduction, compared to »Sanger« sequencing. It all started
in 2005. with the report from 454 Life sciences.
»454« sequencing
»454« sequencing by synthesis (SBS) was developed by 454 Life Sciences, which was later acquired
by Roche. This technology is used in Genome Se -
quen cer series of instruments. »454« sequencing (43)
relies on pyrosequencing (44–46), miniaturized and
massively parallelized using PicoTiterPlates (47). 
Pyrosequencing (Figure 1.D.5) is based on the
detection of light signal upon incorporation of nucleo -
tide by polymerase. Incorporation of dNTP releases
pyrophosphate (PPi). In the presence of ATP sulfurylase and adenosine 5’-phosphosulfate (APS), PPi is
converted to ATP. Luciferase-ATP mediates conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin, which generates a
light signal. Amount of light is proportional to the
number of ATP molecules, which is proportional to
the number of released pyrophosphates, or, in other
words, incorporated nucleotides.
The first step in sample preparation is mechanical fragmentation (nebulization) of DNA (Figure
1.D.1). Next, double-stranded adapters, »A« and »B«,
are ligated to the termini of each fragment (Figure
1.D.1). Adapter »A« contains binding site for the
sequencing primer. One strand of adapter »B« is
biotinylated and serves to attach the fragment on
streptavidin-beads. This mixture of fragments is incubated with streptavidin-beads that bind all fragments
that contain adapter »B«. Fragments that are ligated
to two »A« adapters are lost upon first washing step,
while fragments that are ligated to two »B« adapters
bind beads with both termini. In the next step, DNA
on the beads is denatured, unbiotinylated strands are
released from the beads and collected, thus generating ssDNA library. This library is then mixed with the
excess of capture beads coated with oligonucleotides
complementary to adapter »B«, aiming to bind maximally one fragment per bead. Then, beads are mixed
with water/oil emulsion, containing PCR reagents and
primers complementary to adapters, thus generating
thousands discrete PCR microreactors (48), small
droplets containing only one bead (Figure 1.D.2).
This mixture is then subjected to thermal cycling
(emulsion PCR, emPCR), which leads to clonal amplification of the fragment bound to the capture bead.
Each newly generated strand is, upon denaturation
during PCR, bound by free oligonucleotides of the
capture bead. This procedure produces millions of
new DNA molecules. Once the clonal amplification is
completed, microreactors are broken, and DNA-containing beads are enriched and subjected to denaturation that leaves only ssDNA bound to beads. In the

final step, the sequencing primer is attached to
ssDNA fragments.
These beads are then deposited into the wells of
the PicoTiterPlate, one bead per well (Figure 1.D.3).
In addition, enzyme-beads, coated with sulfurylase
and luciferase, are also deposited into the wells
(Figure 1.D.4). The plate is loaded into the instrument’s flow chamber, through which the sequencing
reagents flow (Figure 1.D.6). The bottom of the plate
is in optical contact with charge-coupled device
(CCD) sensor, which captures emitted light from individual wells. During sequencing, the plate is flushed
with each nucleotide separately. Incorporation of the
dNTPs releases PPi molecules, which are converted
to light signals by sulfurylase and luciferase attached
to the enzyme-beads. After incorporation of dNTPs
and detection of light signals, the reagents are
washed away and flow cell is treated with apyrase,
which removes any remaining dNTPs. Incorporation
of 2 or 3 dNTPs of the same type is registered as a
stronger light signal (Figure 1.D.7). Depending on the
format, the plate contains few hundred thousand to
almost two million wells. In the first publication, the
read length was more than 100 bp, and later it
improved to up to 1000 bp (49). The latest instrument is claimed to be able to produce 700 million bp
per 23 h run, with 99.997% accuracy.
The major drawbacks of this technology are the
reagent cost and high error rates in homopolymer
repeats (50), in particular that it currently does not
allow efficient detection of single-base insertions or
deletions in homopolymers. Sequencing of the
genome of J.D. Watson (of the Watson and Crick
fame) by the same group (51) was performed at the
same coverage (∼7.5x) like sequencing of the ge -
nome of J.C Venter (24), but, reportedly, for approximately one hundredth of the price. Furthermore,
compared to the Human Genome Project that took
almost 15 years, the sequencing of J. D. Watson’s
genome took 2 months, using three instruments. 
»Illumina« sequencing
»Illumina« sequencer is able to produce larger
volume of data, compared to 454 sequencer. With
the read length of 100 bp, and run time of 11 days,
the current instrument can produce 600 Gbp of data
(52). This is great improvement, compared to the
original report (53), where, while obtaining reads of
35 bp, 2 Gbp of sequence was produced.
This technology is also based on sequencing by
synthesis. Using bridge amplification, polonies (PCR
colonies) of clonally enriched template DNA are generated. Similar to »454« sequencing, template DNA is
fragmented, and two different sets of adapters are
attached to the termini of the fragments – one set
needed for binding the flow cell and second needed
for sequencing. These fragments are denatured and
single strands are then injected into the flow cell, the
surface of which is covered with the dense lawn of
primers, complementary to the sequence of adapters
(Figure 1.E.1). Template strands are attached via
adapter sequence onto the surface of the flow cell.
Complementarity of attached primers and adapter on
the free end of single-stranded template DNA leads
to creation of bridges, i.e. annealing of adapters to
the primers (Figure 1.E.1). Upon addition of PCR
reagents, the second strand is generated. Dena -
turation leads to dissociation of bridges, and the new
annealing step creates new bridges by each strand
(Figure 1.E.1). Repeating the process of bridge amplification, small cluster of around 1000 clonally amplified fragments is generated (Figure 1.E.2). Reverse
strands are cleaved and washed away. Remaining
clusters of single strands are templates for subsequent
sequencing. The procedure involves reversible terminator nucleotides, each labelled with different fluorescent dye. This enables addition of all four dNTPs at
the same time (Figure 1.E.3). Upon addition, complementary nucleotides are incorporated, and unincorporated dNTPs are washed away. The chemical group
on dNTPs prevents extension of the chain. Next, an
image of the flow cell is recorded, with fluorescent
signal in those places where clusters are (Figure
1.E.4). Chemical treatment of the flow cell removes
the fluorescent dye from incorporated nucleotides
and recovers 3’-OH group. The flow cell is then
flushed with the new cycle of dNTPs, that are incorporated, and image of the flow cell is recorded. By
stacking and superimposing images obtained during
all cycles, the software is able to reconstruct sequence
of each template cluster (Figure 1.E.4). The described
procedure is termed single-read sequencing. For
paired-read sequencing, i.e. sequencing of the second strand, the original clusters are converted to
dsDNA, and already sequenced strands are removed.
Since different adapters are on the termini of each
fragment, the choice of strand to be sequenced can
be determined by the complementarity of the
sequencing primer with one or the other adapter.
Finally, if such need exists, one could perform matepair sequencing. The termini of template dsDNA are
biotinylated and the fragments are circularized.
Circular molecules are fragmented and biotinylated
fragments (i.e. fused termini of the original template)
are enriched. Adapters are then attached to these
hybrid fragments, and sequencing is performed as
described. This approach enables sequencing of the
short termini of the 2–5 Kbp long fragments, while
ignoring the portion in the middle and can be used,
for example, for analysis of structural variants, e.g.
translocations or inversions.
Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and
Detection (SOLiD)
SOLiD is next-generation sequencer instrument,
marketed by ABI. It is based on sequencing by ligaJ Med Biochem 2013; 32 (4) 307

tion (SBL). This procedure involves sequential annealing of probes to the template and their subsequent
ligation, and is, therefore, related to SBH. Sample
preparation is somewhat similar to that of »454«
sequencing (54). Template dsDNA is fragmented,
and two different adapters attached to the termini of
the fragments (Figure 2.A.1). These fragments are
then mixed with the excess of beads. Single-fragment-bound beads are mixed with PCR reagents and
each bead is enclosed within a microreactor droplet
in water/oil emulsion (Figure 2.A.2). Subsequent PCR
clonally amplifies fragment on the bead. In the next
step, beads are deposited onto the glass slide (Figure
2.A.3). Then, the bases are read by probing the
beads with mixtures of 5’ fluorescently labelled
octamer probes. Last two 3’ bases of the octamer are
known, while the rest is degenerate. With 16 possible
combinations of two bases, there is limited number of
fluorescent dyes that can be used. Therefore, probes
containing certain combinations of two 3’ (interrogatory) bases (di-base) are labelled with the same dye:
for example, for each di-base, the reverse sequence is
in the same colour, as well as the complementary dibase and its reverse sequence (e.g. AC, CA, GT and
TG), and so on. The sequencing begins by adding
oligonucleotide primer complementary to the
adapter, with its last 3’ base annealed to the last base
of adapter i.e. adapter-template junction. Then, a
pool of probes labelled in the same colour is added.
If the two interrogatory bases (together with 6 degenerate bases) find complementary sequence, DNA ligase ligates the probe to the primer (Figure 2.A.4).
The fluorescent signal is recorded. Then, last three 5’
bases (including terminal base with fluorescent dye)
of the probe are cleaved, followed by addition of the
next pool of probes, labelled with the second dye. In
case of successful annealing, the second probe is ligated to the first probe. The process is repeated, followed by probing with the pools of probes labelled
with the third and fourth dye. After 4 cycles, two
nucleotides are »read« and three are skipped, per
each probe (e.g. + + – – – + + – – – + + – – –...).
The addition of 4 pools of probes can be done n
times. Then, the ligated probes and oligonucleotide
primer are removed and the new one is annealed.
The new primer is reset, i.e. located 1 base away from
adapter-template junction towards 5’ end (n-1). The
cycles of probe annealing and ligation are repeated
(Figure 2.A.4). Since the new primer is shifted one
base towards 5’ end, the first of the two bases with
the interrogated previous primer, the 5’ base, will be
interrogated again, along with the new 5’ base. The
reader should keep in mind that at this level, it is not
possible to know which base is »recognized« in first or
second step, since there are four probes labelled with
the same dye. Resetting of the primer is done 4 times
(from n-1 to n-4), thus enabling interrogations of all
bases, including those covered by degenerate bases.
Each base is interrogated twice.
To decipher the bases behind two fluorescent
signals registered for each interrogated position,
there is an artificial four-colour code (not to be mixed
with the four dyes used for labelling of the probes).
For example, red fluorescence followed by red fluorescence is blue, yellow fluorescence followed by yellow fluorescence is blue, red fluorescence followed by
yellow fluorescence is green, etc. At the same time,
each colour encodes the first and the second »recognized« base. Simply by the order of four colours, computer is able to reconstruct the sequence of bases,
since the identity (and colour) of bases #1 and #2
influence the identity and colour of bases #2 and #3,
etc. (Figure 2.A.4). Using this approach, 50 bp reads
can be obtained. The key advantage of this method is
that each base is interrogated twice. Major disadvantages are read length and run times.
Third generation sequencing – emerging
technologies
Third generation technologies are driven by the
goal to reduce the price of sequencing and to simplify the procedure. One way to achieve this is to avoid
preparation and amplification of samples by sequencing single molecules, thereby reducing the cost of
reagents. Furthermore, optical systems for detection
of incorporation events have inherent drawbacks, and
another tendency of third generation methods is to
use non-optical detection systems.
Single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing
Most prominent technology for single molecule
sequencing (SMS) is marketed by Pacific Biosciences
(55). To achieve SMS, the authors have developed a
chip with wells in the zeptoliter (10–21 L) volume
range. On the bottom of each well, one molecule of
DNA polymerase is immobilized, using biotin-streptavidin system. Once the template ssDNA is coupled
with immobilized DNA polymerase, fluorescently
labelled dNTPs are added. Although the fluorescence
of free-floating dNTPs is not quenched, the special
detection system, due to the design of the well, is able
to detect only the fluorescence of the nucleotide
being incorporated in the growing strand of DNA
(Figure 2.C). Since the fluorescent dye is attached to
the phosphate group, incorporation releases fluorescent signal from the nucleotide and the detection of
signal (i.e. pulse) stops. Therefore, during synthesis of
the second strand, each incorporation is measured in
real time. Since all four nucleotides are added simultaneously, and measurement is made in real time, the
speed of sequencing is increased compared to technologies where individual nucleotides are flushed
sequentially. Reported accuracy is 99.3%, and it most
likely could be improved by circularizing the template
and sequencing it several times. Read length is more
than 900 bp (50).
308 Gu`vi}: The history of DNA sequencing

DNA nanoball sequencing
DNA nanoball sequencing (DNB) was developed by the inventor of SBH (42). It also belongs to
sequencing by ligation approaches. DNA template is
fragmented into fragments of 400 – 500 bp. Next,
two halves of adapter 1 are ligated onto the termini of
each fragment (Figure 2.B.1). Upon circularization of
the molecule, adapter #1 site is created. Then, this
circular molecule is nicked and two halves of adapter
#2 are ligated, which upon circularization create
adapter 2. In the same way, adapters #3 and #4 are
introduced into the fragment, with the final step being
circularization that creates adapter #4 site, along with
removal of the portion of template sequence (Figure
2.B.1). Four adapters are located roughly at the positions 3, 6, 9 and 12 o’clock. In the next step, this circular molecule is subjected to many cycles of rolling
circle amplification, generating ssDNA concatemer.
Four adapter sequences contain palindromic
sequences, which interact and cause coiling of the
long ssDNA into tight ball of DNA, roughly 300 nm
in size (Figure 2.B.2). DNBs are deposited onto the
arrayed flow cell, with wells accommodating only one
nanoball, enabling high density of DNBs to be
sequenced (Figure 2.B.3). The bases of the template
are read in 5’ and 3’ direction from each adapter, up
to ten bases in each direction. Since only short se -
quen ces, adjacent to adapters, are read, this sequen -
cing format resembles a multiplexed form of matepair sequencing approach. The actual sequencing
procedure involves probing nanoballs with anchor
probe, complementary to adapter sequence and pool
of four fluorescently labelled probes with degenerate
nucleotides in all but one position, which is actually
interrogated (similar to SOLiD sequencing). Upon
annealing, anchor and degenerate probe will be adjacent, and ligated. Unbound probes are washed away
and fluorescence recorded (Figure 2.B.4). Ligated
probes are removed, and a new pool of probes is
added, specific for different interrogated position.
The cycle of annealing, ligation, washing and image
recording is repeated for all ten positions adjacent to
one terminus of one adapter. This process is repeated
for all seven remaining adapter termini.
The major disadvantage is the short length of
reads, although authors managed to sequence the
whole human genome. Claimed cost of the reagents
for sequencing of the whole human genome is under
5000$. The major advantage of this approach is the
high density of arrays, and therefore high number
DNBs (∼350 million) that can be sequenced. 
Nanopore sequencing
Nanopore sequencing is not yet commercially
available. Nanopores are formed by pore forming
proteins, such as different kinds of biological channels, e.g. a–haemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus
(56). The idea behind sequencing using nanopores is
that the conductivity of the pore for the ion currents
changes when the pore is blocked by the strand of
nucleic acid passing through the pore. The flow of ion
current will depend on the shape of the molecule
translocating through the pore. Since nucleotides
have different shapes, in theory it should be possible
to recognize each nucleotide by its subtle effect on
the change of the ionic current (57). The key advantage of this approach is that it sequences single molecules, and therefore minimal sample preparation is
necessary. In addition, as no amplification or ligation
occurs, nucleotides and enzymes are not required. It
is plausible that it will be possible to achieve very long
read lengths (in the Kbp range). Currently, the crucial
problem of the technology is reducing the speed of
DNA translocation through the nanopore, in order to
ensure reliable measurement of the current change.
Ion torrent
Ion Torrent technology was developed by the
inventor of »454« sequencing (58), and it is marketed by Life Technologies. Sample preparation is very
similar to the one used for »454« sequencing. How -
ever, instead of PicoTiterPlate, a chip with ion-sensitive field-effect transistor sensor, engineered to be
able to detect individual protons, is used. The instrument has no optical components. Beads containing
enriched template DNA are deposited into the wells
of the chip. The chip is situated within the flow cell,
and is sequentially flushed with individual dNTPs.
Integration of nucleotide releases H+ that changes
the pH of the surrounding solution proportional to the
number of incorporated nucleotides (Figure 2.D).
This is detected by the sensor on the bottom of each
well, and converted to electronic signal, that is re -
corded by the system. The latest version of the instrument (Ion Proton) is claimed to have throughput of
20 Gbp, with reads of 200 bp, and run time of up to
4 h (59). The major disadvantages of the system are
problems in reading homopolymer stretches and relative short read length, what is partially compensated
by the number of wells (up to 11 million). The major
advantage seems to be the price.
Conclusion
»Sanger« sequencing is still considered to be the
»gold standard« of sequencing, due to its accuracy
and read lengths. Automated »Sanger« sequencing
still produces the longest reads, although »next-generation« technologies are coming closer to this mark.
Still, »Sanger« sequencing is notoriously slow and
expensive. On the other hand, second and third generation technologies are able to sequence whole
human genome at 30x coverage within 10 days, for
10000$. Key problems of these technologies are
accuracy and short reads, which makes final assembly
J Med Biochem 2013; 32 (4) 309

or alignment difficult and computationally challenging. The ideal technology of the future will have to
come with increased accuracy, longer read lengths
and reduced price. Single molecule sequencing technologies probably hold the potential to become the
sequencing technologies of the future, especially with
their potential to directly sequence RNA molecules
(by replacing DNA polymerase with RNA-dependent
DNA polymerase (60)). Another important venue of
research will be analysis of genome and transcriptome of single cells (61, 62).
Improvement and development of new sequencing technologies is making them increasingly available and affordable to researchers. To meet the needs
of scientists who do not have the ambition to routinely sequence large genomes, few companies have
launched benchtop sequencers, with somewhat
reduced capabilities (63). The choice of the technology depends on the needed application and advantages or disadvantages of the particular sequencing
approach. For example, 454 technology produces
long reads, but its sequencing volume is in hundreds
of Mbp range and is produced within hours, while
»Illumina« sequencing produces shorter reads, with
volume of hundreds of Gbp, within days. In most
cases, an average academic laboratory or core facility can purchase at most one platform. Therefore, this
decision should be thoroughly contemplated,
depending on the user’s current, but also prospective
needs. 
Increasing throughput and decreasing price of
sequencing are slowly replacing other methods. For
example, it can be expected that expression profiling
by microarrays will be abandoned. Contemporary
applications of sequencing include de novo sequencing and resequencing of whole genomes (51), gene
expression profiling (64, 65), detection of methylated
regions in the genome (66), but also analysis of portions of the genome (e.g. exome (67), ChIP-Seq (68),
genotyping, mutation analysis (69)), with different
methods of sequence enrichment methods being
increasingly available (70).
Completion of the sequencing of the human
genome had little implication for routine healthcare
(71). However, with the decrease of price of sequencing, many clinical diagnostic procedures (e.g. preimplantation diagnostics (72, 73)) will be replaced by
sequencing. It will become possible to untangle great
heterogeneity of complex genetic disorders (cancer,
neuro-psychiatric disorders) (74, 75). In addition to
improved health care, basic science will also benefits
from novel sequencing technologies. Genomes of
many viruses, bacteria, plant and animal species are
being sequenced, what will have great impact on agricultural and environmental sciences.
New sequencing technologies are developed
and improved very rapidly. Probably by the time this
article is published, some numbers will not be up to
date. It is difficult to predict the fate of existing and
emerging technologies. Some technologies, like 454
or Illumina are already established in the laboratories
around the world. If they are going be replaced by
more recent technologies, such as Ion Torrent or single molecule sequencing, remains to be seen. Most
likely, not only the existing technologies will be
improved, but we can expect the rise of fourth generation sequencing technologies, all aiming to bring the
1000$ within our reach (76, 77).
