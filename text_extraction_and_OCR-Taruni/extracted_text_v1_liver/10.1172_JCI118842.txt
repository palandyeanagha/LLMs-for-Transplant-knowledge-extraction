Abstract
The anti-viral T cell response is believed to play a central
role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus infection. Since
chronic evolution occurs in . 50% of HCV infections, the
sequential analysis of the T cell response from the early clinical stages of disease may contribute to define the features
of the T cell response associated with recovery or chronic viral persistence. For this purpose, 21 subjects with acute hepatitis C virus infection were sequentially followed for an
average time of 44 wk. Twelve patients normalized transaminase values that remained normal throughout the follow-up period; all but two cleared hepatitis C virus-RNA
from serum. The remaining nine patients showed persistent
viremia and elevated transaminases. Analysis of the peripheral blood T cell proliferative response to core, E1, E2, NS3,
NS4, and NS5 recombinant antigens and synthetic peptides
showed that responses to all hepatitis C virus antigens, except E1, were significantly more vigorous and more frequently detectable in patients who normalized transaminase
levels than in those who did not. By sequential evaluation of
the T cell response, a difference between the two groups of patients was already detectable at the very early stages of
acute infection and then maintained throughout the followup period. The results suggest that the vigor of the T cell response during the early stages of infection may be a critical
determinant of disease resolution and control of infection.

Introduction
The hepatitis C virus (HCV)1 is an RNA virus that can cause
acute self-limited infections and chronic hepatocellular injury
with possible progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1). The mechanisms responsible for liver cell damage
and for the high rate of viral persistence are still largely unknown.
While the contribution of a direct cytopathic effect of HCV
to liver damage is still controversial, several lines of indirect
evidence, including the existence of chronic HCV infections
without clinically overt disease (2) and the frequent association with autoimmune syndromes (3), indicate that immunemediated mechanisms are likely to play an important role in
the pathogenesis of hepatitis C. This is also suggested by the
presence of CD41 and CD81 T cells able to recognize structural and nonstructural HCV antigens within the liver as well
as in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic HCV infection (4–14). Why HCV can persist with high efficiency in the
face of CD8- and CD4-mediated anti-viral T cell responses
readily detectable in blood and liver and thus potentially favorable to HCV clearance is a central pathogenetic issue that
remains to be addressed.
Most available data on cell-mediated immune responses
come from patients with an already established condition of
chronic infection (4–14), whereas only a single study has been
carried out so far in patients with acute HCV infection suggesting that an efficient T cell response to NS3 and possibly to
other nonstructural HCV proteins is critical for successful viral
clearance (15).
To further characterize the T cell responses occurring in
the initial stages of disease which are likely to be crucial for the
final outcome of infection and to define the peculiar features
of the T cell response which are specifically associated with recovery or chronic viral persistence, we studied the HLA class
II–restricted proliferative T cell response to HCV proteins sequentially from the early clinical stages of disease in patients
with different outcomes of infection. Results indicate a quantitative difference in the HLA class II–restricted T cell response
to HCV antigens core, E2, NS3, NS4, and NS5 between patients with acute HCV infection who succeed in normalizing
the biochemical parameters of disease activity and those who
maintain elevated transaminase levels. This difference in the
anti-viral T cell response may represent an important determinant of the final outcome of infection.
Methods
Patients. Twenty one patients with acute hepatitis C (18 males and 3
females; mean age, 30) were studied. Diagnosis of acute HCV infection was based on the finding of elevated values of serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) at least 10 times the normal values, associated with anti-HCV antibody seroconversion by second-generation
ELISA (ELISA II; Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Raritan NJ, which detects antibodies to core, NS3 and NS4) or by RIBA II (Ortho Diagnostic Systems) showing the appearance of antibodies to NS4 (in
most cases) or NS3. Four patients were included in the study even
though seroconversion was not observed, on the basis of their clinical
behavior and anamnestic characteristics. Other possible causes of
acute hepatitis (i.e., viruses, toxins, alcohol, autoimmunity, metabolic
factors) were excluded.

T Cell Response in Acute HCV Infection 707
One of the patients with acute hepatitis was coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and became hepatitis B surface antigen positive
2 mo after the transaminase peak caused by HCV. The remaining patients were negative for HBV markers. HCV-RNA was tested at the
beginning of the disease confirming the HCV etiology.
Control experiments were performed on 12 healthy subjects with
no evidence of previous exposure to HCV (i.e., they were negative
for anti-HCV by second-generation ELISA).
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Parma, and all patients gave informed consent before entering
the study.
Qualitative and quantitative HCV-RNA determination. Sera were
tested for qualitative HCV-RNA by a reverse transcription–nested PCR
assay with two sets of primers located in the conserved 59 untranslated region as described previously (10). Briefly, RNA was extracted
by guanidinium thyocianate from 100 ml of serum, retrotranscribed
with the HCV external antisense primer 1A (59-GATGCACGGTCTACGAGACCTC-39). The cDNA was amplified using the primer
1A and the external sense primer 1B (59-AACTACTGTCTTCACGCAGAA-39). 3 ml of the first PCR products were used for a second
round of amplification using an internal antisense primer 2A (5-GCGACCCAACACTACTCGGCT-39) and an internal sense primer 2B
(59-ATGGCGTTAGTATGAGTG-39). PCR products were analyzed
by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium
bromide. Two negative control sera were included in each experiment.
Levels of circulating HCV-RNA were measured using the
branched-DNA amplification assay, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Quantiplex Version 1.0; Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA)
(16, 17). In brief, lysis, hybridization, capture, and signal amplification were carried out on duplicate 50 ml serum samples in 96-well
plates. A mixture of synthetic oligonucleotides, including probes that
mediate capture and probes that bind to the bDNA amplifier molecule were added to the well. This leads to the capture of the HCVRNA molecules onto the surface of the plate and linking of the target
to synthetic bDNA molecules. Multiple copies of an alkaline phosphatase-linked synthetic probe hybridize to the immobilized complex
thereby amplifying the target signal. Quantitation of HCV-RNA is
based on the measure of light emission by a chemiluminescent substrate (dioxetane), which is proportional to the amount of nucleic acid
in the sample. The quantity is finally determined by a standard curve
and expressed in HCV RNA equivalents per milliliter. The lower
limit of sensitivity of this assay is 350,000 genome equivalents/ml.
HCV genotyping. Genotyping was performed by LIPA assay (Innogenetics, Zwijnaarde, Belgium) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, RNA was extracted by guanidinium thyocianate from 100 ml of serum, retrotranscribed with random priming
examers (Pharmacia Biothech, Uppsala, Sweden). The cDNA was
amplified with an external set of biotin 59 end-labeled primers derived from the 59 untranslated region of HCV; 0.2 ml of the first PCR
products were used for a second round of amplification using an internal set of biotin 59 end-labeled primers. The PCR products were
checked on an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide to rule out
contamination and to ensure adequate products for the reverse-hybridization assay. The PCR products (the first PCR product if showing a
clear band on the agarose gel or the nested amplified products) were
then denatured before addition of the hybridization buffer and incubation with the genotyping strips for 2 h at 508C. Strips were then
stringently washed at 508C for 30 min.
Hybridized PCR products were detected by means of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase immunochemical staining using NBIP as a
substrate. The strips were analyzed, and the genotype assigned according to the pattern of PCR products hybridization (18).
HCV antigens and peptides. The HCV antigens E1, E2, NS3,
NS4, and NS5 were expressed as COOH-terminal fusion proteins
with human SOD in yeast (Streptomices cerevisiae) as previously described (10). Purity of the antigen preparations ranged between 85
and 95%. Recombinant SOD and yeast extracts were used in each experiment as control for nonspecific proliferation. Antigens were
kindly provided by Chiron Corporation.
Synthetic 20-mer peptides overlapping by 10 amino acid residues
and covering the entire HCV core and NS4 antigens of genotype 1a
(HCV-1 sequence) were purchased from Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia).
Isolation of PBMC and T cell subsets. PBMC were isolated from
fresh heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. CD4-and CD8-positive T cell populations were purified by
immunomagnetic separation using Dynabeads (Dynal A.S., Oslo,
Norway), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, PBMC or
antigen-specific T cell lines (see below) were incubated with CD4 or
CD8-conjugated magnetic beads at a bead to cell ratio of 3 to 1 for 1 h
at 48C on a rotating platform. Positively selected cells were then recovered by an additional incubation for 1 h at room temperature with
an mAb (Detachabead; Dynal A.S.) competing with CD4 or CD8 antibodies bound to the beads. Isolated cell populations were resuspended at 4 3 106
 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mM
Hepes, 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 mg/ml gentamycin, and 10% human serum (complete medium).
Production of antigen-specific polyclonal T cell lines. Total PBMC
were preincubated for 4–6 h with HCV antigens at 10 mg/ml, then
washed and cultured at 3 3 106 cells/ml in a 24-well plate. After 5 d,
activated T cells were expanded by adding IL-2. Growing lines were
restimulated after an additional 15 d with irradiated (3,000 Rad)
autologous, antigen-prepulsed PBMC (5 3 105/ml) in medium supplemented with 30 U/ml recombinant IL-2. From this point, T cell
lines were restimulated every 14 d and provided with supplementary
IL-2–containing medium between restimulations to maintain the cell
concentration between 3 3 105 and 1 3 106 (19).
Proliferation assays. PBMC (2 3 105) were plated at 50 ml/well in
96-well plates and stimulated with either HCV antigens (10 mg/ml) or
control SOD (10 mg/ml) or yeast extracts (1 and 0.2 mg/ml). To avoid
toxic or direct inhibitory effects of the antigen on effector cells,
PBMC were washed after 4–6 h, resuspended in complete medium at
a final concentration of 106 cells/ml, and cultured in a total vol of 200
ml for 7 d at 378C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
In selected experiments, unfractionated T cells (105/well) or purified CD4- or CD8-positive T cells from polyclonal T cell lines (5 3
104/well) were incubated with autologous irradiated (3,000 Rad)
PBMC (105/well) as antigen-presenting cells (APC), prepulsed with
antigen, and then washed before coculture with T cells.
For synthetic peptide stimulation, PBMC (2 3 105) were cultured
in 200 ml of complete medium in the presence of 2.5 mg/ml of individual peptides for 7 d. PHA stimulation was carried out for 3 d with different concentrations of the mitogen (1:200, 1:400, 1:800, 1:1,600;
PHA-M; Gibco Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). All proliferation assays were performed in triplicate and [3H]thymidine
(
3H-TdR; 0.5 mCi per well; sp act 2.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham International, Amersham, UK) was added 15 h before harvesting. The results
are expressed as the mean counts per minute of triplicate determinations. The stimulation index was calculated as the ratio between mean
counts per minute obtained in the presence and absence of antigen.
Determination of HLA restriction. mAbs recognizing monomorphic determinants of DR (D1-12; IgG2a), DQ1 (BT3/4; IgG1), DQ2
(XIII358/4; IgG2a), DQ3 (XIV466; IgG2b), DP (B7/21; IgG2a), and
an mAb anti- HLA A,B,C-specific (W6/32; IgG2a) were a gift from
Dr. R.S. Accolla, University of Verona, Italy (19). Irradiated non–T
cells as APC (2 3 104/well) were incubated with mAbs for 2 h before
addition of antigen. After a further 4–6 h incubation with antigen,
APC were washed and added to responder T cells (105/well). AntiHLA class II mAbs were used at a 1:1,000 final dilution of ascitic
fluid; purified W6/32 was used at the concentration of 1 mg/ml.
Statistical analysis. Stimulation indexes derived from patients who
normalized ALT values and patients with persistently elevated transaminase levels were compared by the Student’s t test for unpaired
data. Frequencies of significant proliferative T cell responses were
compared by x
2
 and log-linear analysis. Possible correlations between

proliferative T cell responses and HCV-RNA levels were assessed by
linear regression analysis.
Results
Clinical outcome. The follow-up of the 21 patients with acute
hepatitis C enrolled into the study (from clinical presentation
with symptoms of acute hepatitis and/or transaminase elevation) ranged between 18 and 91 wk (average follow-up 44 wk).
17 patients were genotyped, and the most prevalent genotype
was genotype 1a (8 patients) followed by genotype 3a (5 patients), genotype 1b (3 patients), and genotype 2a (1 patient)
(Table I). 12 of the 21 patients with acute hepatitis C normalized the ALT values (group I); ALT normalization was observed 3–7 wk from clinical presentation, with the exception of
a single patient who was coinfected with HBV and normalized
ALT values after 18 wk, showing a biphasic transaminase peak
(patient 4). The remaining 9 patients (group II) showed transaminase levels persistently above the normal range, with the
exception of patient 15 (followed 91 wk) (Table I) who showed
a mild activity of disease with continuous ALT fluctuations
from normal to slightly elevated values (2–3 times the upper
limit), and patient 21 (followed 29 wk) (Table I) who rapidly
normalized ALT levels after a very high transaminase peak at
presentation (3,000 U/L), but relapsed after 4 wk of normal
ALT. ALT levels at presentation were not predictive of the
different clinical outcomes.
10 of the 12 patients who normalized ALT showed negative
HCV-RNA by nested PCR at the end of the follow-up, while
two patients (patients 9 and 12) remained HCV-RNA positive.
All patients with elevated ALT were persistently HCV-RNA
positive (Table I). Since HCV can reactivate even after long
periods of normal ALT and, on the other hand, clinic and virologic recovery can be observed also late after a protracted liver
inflammation, it is clear that definitive conclusions about final
diagnosis cannot be drawn for a proportion of patients followed for less than a year (Table I).
Proliferative T cell responses to HCV proteins and peptides. PBMC stimulation with HCV proteins was carried out
every wk during the first mo of disease, every 2 wk during the
following 2 mos, and then once a month for the rest of the follow-up. Some time points were missing due to the variable
compliance of the patients. An antigen concentration of 10 mg/
ml was used based on the results of a previous study (10) showing that optimal levels of proliferative T cell response were induced by this antigen concentration. PBMC from 12 control
HCV-uninfected subjects were serially tested with HCV proteins and peptides to define the levels above which a proliferative response can be considered positive. Based on these results, stimulation index values of 3 and 4 (which correspond to

T Cell Response in Acute HCV Infection 709
the mean plus at least 2 standard deviations of the response to
each protein or peptide obtained in the control group) were
defined as the upper limit of the normal range for proliferative
responses to HCV proteins and peptides, respectively. All results with recombinant proteins were corrected by subtraction
of the stimulation index values obtained with control recombinant SOD and yeast extracts. Since a few healthy uninfected
controls showed proliferative response to the batch of recombinant core antigen used in this study, data with this recombinant protein will not be illustrated to avoid ambiguity in the interpretation of the results. T cell reactivity to HCV core was
therefore assessed only with synthetic peptides, which never
induced significant levels of proliferative response in the control group.
Significant proliferative responses to NS4, NS5, and E2
were observed with similar frequencies in the whole patient
population (NS4 29%, NS5 28%, E2 28%), suggesting similar
levels of immunogenicity of these antigens at the effector
T cell level. Higher frequencies of significant T cell responses
(43%) were observed with NS3, whereas only 10% of E1-specific responses were detected.
To characterize the effector cell population responsive to
HCV proteins, in selected patients, antigen-responsive cells
were expanded and kept in continuous culture by PBMC stimulation with antigen and IL-2. As expected, because of the exogenous nature of the antigen used for PBMC stimulation,
PBMC responsiveness to antigen was shown to be sustained by
HLA class II–restricted, CD41 T cells, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
When the proliferative responses expressed by patients
who succeeded in normalizing ALT and those who maintained
persistently elevated transaminase values were analyzed, a
clear difference emerged from the comparison of the two
groups. Both vigor and frequency of significant responses to
E2, NS3, NS4, and NS5 were much greater in group I than in
group II. This was evident from the comparison of the peak
proliferative responses displayed by individual patients to the
different HCV proteins (Fig. 2, bottom of each panel) as well
as from the comparison of the frequency of significant responses to individual proteins expressed by each patient during the follow-up (Fig. 2, top of each panel). The sequential
analysis of the T cell response to HCV proteins in the two
groups of patients as a function of the time from clinical presentation, showed that significant values of proliferative responses to E2, NS3, NS4, and NS5 were more frequent in patients who normalized ALT at almost all time points of the
follow-up (Fig. 3).
Similarly, the vigor of the T cell responses to E2, NS3, NS4,
and NS5 was also significantly greater in group I, as shown by
the comparison of all responses to the individual proteins (in
terms of stimulation indexes) expressed by the two groups of
patients throughout the follow-up (Fig. 4). In contrast, vigor
and frequency of significant responses to E1 were similar in
the 2 groups of patients. A significant difference between
group I and II was observed also with an additional experimental approach based on T cell stimulation with synthetic
20-mer peptides covering the entire HCV core and NS4 regions (P , 0.001 for both antigens) (Fig. 5). This difference
was highly significant when all determinations derived from all
patients of the 2 groups were compared. In particular, while
only one of the patients who normalized ALT did not respond
to NS4 peptides at the time points analyzed, a complete lack of
response was detected in six patients with persistent transaminase elevation. Furthermore, all patients who normalized ALT
responded to at least one core peptide, whereas no response to

liver damage. Finally, a larger number of core and NS4 T cell
epitopes were simultaneously recognized by patients who normalized transaminase values compared to the patients with
persistently elevated ALT. Only one patient with persistent
ALT normalization responded to C22 but not to NS4 peptides
during the course of the follow-up; all other patients of this
group responded to one or more core and NS4 peptides simulFigure 2. Frequencies and peaks of proliferative T cell responses to HCV proteins.

taneously. Among the group of patients with persistent ALT
elevation, two patients showed sporadic responses to core but
not to NS4 peptides, four responded neither to core nor to NS4
peptides, and three patients responded to both. To assess
whether the weaker responses to HCV proteins in patients
with persistently elevated ALT were due to a general state of
T cell hyporesponsiveness, T cell proliferative responses to different doses of PHA analyzed sequentially in the two groups
of patients during the first 6 mos of follow-up were compared.
No statistically significant difference was observed between
group I and II (not shown).
HCV viremia and T cell proliferative responses. Patients who
normalized ALT transiently or persistently showed either undetectable viremia at the beginning of disease or a rapid fall to
negative values by bDNA analysis. While bDNA remained
negative in all patients with persistent normalization of ALT,
the only two patients who developed a chronic disease after
transient ALT normalizations were HCV-RNA negative (by
bDNA) at clinical presentation but became bDNA positive
later (patients 15 and 20, Tables I and II). All patients with
persistently elevated ALT were persistently HCV-RNA positive. An inverse relationship was observed between viremia
and T cell responses, since patients who normalized ALT
showed lower viremia and higher levels of T cell responses to
HCV proteins, whereas patients with persistent liver inflammation showed high viremia and weak T cell responses (Table
II). Despite this, a statistically significant correlation could not
be demonstrated by linear regression analysis between levels
of stimulation index and levels of viremia at the individual
points of the follow-up. This is, however, not surprising if one
considers that in the interplay between virus and host immune
system a given immunologic event needs some time to cause
its effect on the virus and vice versa, making highly unlikely
the possibility of finding a correlation between virologic and
immunologic parameters measured at the same time points.
Discussion
Acute HCV infection represents an ideal natural model to
study the pathogenesis of viral persistence because the high
rate of chronic evolution provides the opportunity to follow sequentially from the early stages of infection the immune events
associated with recovery from disease or with chronic liver
damage and viral persistence.
To assess whether quantitative and/or qualitative differences in the antiviral immune response can account for different outcomes of disease, we have focussed our analysis on the
HLA class II–restricted T cell response to HCV antigens because this response is crucial for optimal induction of neutralizing antibodies as well as cytotoxic T cell responses (20). In
addition, several lines of evidence indicate that the pattern of
cytokines secreted by CD41 helper T cells can facilitate eradication of infection when it is dominated by T helper 1 responses or can favor viral persistence if it is oriented toward T
helper 2 effects (21).
Previous studies from our laboratory showed that asymptomatic anti-HCV1 subjects who successfully cleared HCVRNA from serum and PBMC after a previous episode of acute
HCV infection can express vigorous HLA class II–restricted T
cell responses to HCV antigens, even several years after resolution of hepatitis (10). T cell responses were stronger than in
chronically infected patients, raising the question of whether
the relative strength of response can represent a crucial determinant of viral clearance or persistence and whether a quantitative difference in the T cell response among patients with different outcomes of disease is also present at the early stages of
infection, when the crucial pathogenetic events are likely to
occur.
To address this important issue a group of patients with
acute HCV infection was selected and studied for the proliferative T cell response to HCV proteins sequentially from clinical presentation to the later stages after acute disease. The
main finding of our study is the observation that T cell responses to structural (core and E2) as well as nonstructural
(NS3, NS4, and NS5) HCV antigens are more frequently detectable and significantly stronger in the group of patients who
normalize the transaminase levels. A difference in the response to NS3, NS4 and NS5 was observed at all time points
analyzed. The difference was less striking for E2 (Fig. 3), even
if comparison of the average values of all determinations carried out in the two groups throughout the follow-up gave
highly significant results (Fig. 4).
The difference between the two groups of patients was evident not only using recombinant proteins to study T cell responses but also using synthetic peptides. While our results
with NS4 peptides cannot be compared with previous data because no information was available so far on the fine specificity
of the HLA class II–restricted response to this HCV region,
the most immunogenic epitopes of the core antigen reported
previously (AA 23–42, 66–85, 131–150) correspond to AA sequences widely recognized in our group of patients (11). Our
data are partially in keeping with the results of a recent study
showing that the T cell response to NS3 and possibly to the
other nonstructural proteins is stronger in patients with selflimited acute infection than in those evolving to chronic hepatitis (15). Our results extend these observations indicating also
that the T cell response to core and E2 is more vigorous in patients who recover from acute infection. This suggests that the
whole HCV-specific T cell response, rather than the response
to nonstructural proteins only, is enhanced in self-limited compared to evolving acute hepatitis C. The lack of difference with
respect to the response to E1 may be due to the high variabilFigure 4. Comparison of the strength of T cell responses to HCV proteins in patients with different outcome of infection. j, patients who

ity of this region combined with its small size (E1 is half of the
size of E2).
All these results are consistent with the concept that an efficient and vigorous T cell response at the early stages of infection may be critical to limit the spread of the virus within the
infected host and to keep viral replication under control. This
may provide the immune system with an important advantage
over the virus which may ultimately favor viral clearance over
chronic persistence. An efficient immune response able to
limit viral spread and replication could also facilitate development of an asymptomatic carriage of the virus with persistence
of HCV-RNA in serum but absence of biochemical signs of
liver disease, as it may have happened in patients 9 and 12 (Table I). Thus, recovery (ALT normalization with negative
HCV-RNA) and asymptomatic carriage (ALT normalization
with positive HCV-RNA) may simply represent two different
levels of control exerted by the immune system over the virus.
All these interpretations are based upon the assumption
that the difference observed in vitro reflects a different vigor
of responses mounted in vivo upon viral antigen presentation
to the immune system. Although this is the most likely interpretation of our results, it is important to consider that our

from a total number of 115 determinations for core (59 and 56 determinations in patients who normalized and in those with persistently elevated 
ALT, respectively) and 102 determinations for NS4 (59 and 43 determinations in patients of group I and II, respectively) carried out sequentially 
during the course of the follow-up. These numbers of determinations derive from the total number of patients tested (21) multiplied by the number of assays carried out throughout the follow-up in each patient. Amino acid sequences of each peptide are indicated by the amino acid position from the NH2
 terminus of the core and NS4 proteins. The inserts illustrate the statistical comparison between the percentage of significant

T Cell Response in Acute HCV Infection 713
study was focused on the peripheral blood compartment which
may only partially reflect immune events occurring within the
infected liver (12) where HCV-specific T cells may be preferentially present at the acute stage of infection. Therefore, the
alternative possibility that weaker peripheral blood T cell responses associated with chronic evolution are caused by persistent sequestration of HCV-specific T cells within the liver as a
result of continuous viral replication and antigen presentation
cannot be completely ruled out at present. However, it is of
note that the T cell response of the patients who normalized
ALT was significantly stronger already at the early stages of
disease (Fig. 3) when both groups of patients had similarly elevated transaminase levels, as expression of acute hepatitis with
cellular recruitment within their livers. This finding strongly
suggests that the overall anti-viral immune response was actually more efficient in patients who ultimately succeeded in
resolving the disease. Unfortunately, this issue cannot be directly addressed because ethical reasons preclude the possibility of obtaining liver tissue from patients with acute HCV infection.
An additional factor to take into account in the interpretation of the results of our study is the genotype of the infecting
virus. In fact, more than 50% of the patients with persistent
liver cell injury were infected by genotype 2a or 3a, whereas
the HCV proteins used to stimulate their T cell responses were
derived from genotype 1, which is the prevalent genotype detected among recovered patients. Thus, the strength of the
T cell response may have been influenced by the degree of homology between the sequence of the infecting virus and that of
the proteins used to stimulate in vitro the T cell response. This
interpretation is however contradicted by the evidence that the
T cell response in genotype 1–infected patients with persistently elevated ALT was not stronger than in the patients of
the same group infected by other genotypes (genotypes 2 and
3) (data not shown). Moreover, two additional lines of observations argue against this interpretation. First, E2 was the most
frequently recognized protein by T cells of patients with persistently elevated ALT, even though the variability of this region
is the highest among different genotypes. Second, a highly significant difference between groups was also observed with respect to T cell responses to HCV core which is the most conserved HCV antigen. Significant T cell responses observed in
acutely infected patients with persistent liver damage (like
those described in the present study) were less frequently detectable and less vigorous than the responses previously reported in patients with long lasting chronic HCV infections
(10, 13). This suggests that T cell responsiveness to HCV proteins in the peripheral blood compartment may progressively
increase as a function of the time of infection. This may be due
either to progressive induction of responses to subdominant
epitopes as a result of continuous presentation of viral antigens
(22) or to a different compartmentalization of T cells in different stages of infection or to recovery of the T cell function after an early stage of T cell hyporesponsiveness. Alternatively,
the different strength of responses may reflect different epidemiological and virological features of the populations of patients selected in different studies. While patients with a history of drug addiction were included in this longitudinal study
of acute HCV infection, most of the data previously reported
in chronic hepatitis C came from infections of posttransfusional or sporadic origin less frequently related to drug addiction (10, 13).
In conclusion, our study suggests that the relative strength
of the T cell response to HCV proteins in the acute phase of
hepatitis C may represent a critical determinant of the final
evolution of disease. The defective T cell responses of patients
with persistently elevated ALT do not seem to be due to a generalized poor T cell responsiveness because the general state
of T cell reactivity, as indicated by the PHA study, was not significantly different in the two study groups. Even though definitive conclusions about long-term diagnosis cannot be drawn
for a proportion of our patients who were followed for less
than a year, what our study unequivocally establishes is the
concept that a vigorous anti-viral T cell response is associated
with the capacity of the host to normalize ALT levels and recover from hepatitis, either transiently or permanently. Therefore, development of a strong T cell response seems to be essential for disease resolution, even though it might not be
sufficient for definitive recovery. Additional studies are
needed to understand why some patients can mount efficient
T cell responses able to control viral replication while the same
responses are profoundly depressed in other patients. Irrespective of the primary causes of this T cell hyporesponsiveness, however, early potentiation of the defective responses
may represent a rational objective of future therapeutic strategies to decrease the rate of chronic evolution of hepatitis C.
