Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the
most prevalent liver disease worldwide, and there is no
approved pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of vitamin E and
pioglitazone has been established in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive form of NAFLD. GLP1RA and SGLT2 inhibitors, which are currently approved
for use in diabetes, have shown early efficacy in NASH,
and also have beneficial cardiovascular or renal effects.
Innovative NASH therapies include four main pathways.
The first approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation.
Medications in this approach include modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptors (e.g., pemafibrate,
elafibranor), medications targeting farnesoid X receptor
axis [obeticholic acid; OCA)], inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, ACC inhibitor), and fibroblast growth
factor-21 analogues. A second target is oxidative stress,
inflammation, and apoptosis. This class of drug includes
apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor and emricasan (an irreversible caspase inhibitor). A third target is
intestinal microbiomes and metabolic endotoxemia. Several agents are in ongoing trials, including IMMe124,
TLR4 antagonist, and solithromycin (macrolide antibiotics). The final target is hepatic fibrosis, which is strongly
associated with all-cause or liver-related mortality in
NASH. Antifibrotic agents are a cysteine–cysteine motif
chemokine receptor-2/5 antagonist (cenicriviroc; CVC) and
galectin 3 antagonist. Among a variety of medications in
development, four agents such as OCA, elafibranor, ASK1
inhibitor, and CVC are currently being evaluated in an
international phase 3 trial for the treatment of NASH.
Within the next few years, the availability of therapeutic
options for NASH will hopefully curb the rising trend of
NASH-related diseases.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most
prevalent chronic liver disease. One-fourth of the adult
population is now suffering from NAFLD worldwide
[1, 2]. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive
form of NAFLD, can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and is rapidly becoming the leading
cause for end-stage liver disease or liver transplantation
[3]. In Japan, liver-related diseases, such as cirrhosis and
HCC, are now the third leading cause of death in type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [4], which is closely associated
with NAFLD. It is estimated that the prevalence of diagnosed NASH will reach 18 million by 2027 in US, Japan,
and EU 5 (England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain).
Lifestyle interventions, such as dietary caloric restriction
and exercise, currently the cornerstone of therapy for
NASH/NAFLD, can be difficult to achieve and maintain,
underscoring the dire need for pharmacotherapy. However,
there are no approved pharmacotherapies for NASH/
NAFLD. This review presents the agents currently used in
managing NASH/NAFLD and their pharmacologic targets.
It also provides an overview of NAFLD agents currently
under development.

Currently recommended pharmacotherapies
in the practice guidelines from US, Europe,
and Japan
Evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of
NASH/NAFLD were published by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) in 2012 [5],
the Japan Society of Gastroenterology (JSG)–Japan Society
of Hepatology (JSH) in 2014 [6], and the European
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASD)–European
Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASL)–European
Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) in 2016 [7].
The AASLD recently proposed NAFLD ‘‘guidance’’ to
help clinicians understand and implement the most recent
evidence [8]. In summary, pioglitazone and vitamin E are
now recommended as pharmacotherapies for biopsy-proven NASH patients with and without diabetes, respectively,
although long-term efficacy or safety should be established
(Table 1) [5–8].
Whom to treat
Dietary changes and lifestyle modifications are now the
first-line therapy for patients with NASH. Body weight
reduction cannot be achieved in a lot of patients. The most
difficult question to answer is what will be the target
population of NAFLD/NASH pharmacologic treatment.
According to the practice guideline from Europe proposed
in 2016, pharmacotherapies should be considered for
NASH patients with fibrosis stage 2 or higher and with
early stage fibrosis with high risk of fibrosis progression
(older age, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, increased ALT,
and high necroinflammatory activity) [5]. According to a
meta-analysis evaluating five adult NAFLD cohort studies,
the presence of advanced fibrosis (stage 2 or more) is the
most important predictor of liver-related mortality in
NAFLD patients [9]. The AASLD guidance also suggests
that pharmacotherapies aimed primarily at improving liver
disease should be limited to patients with NASH and
fibrosis [8]. Therefore, patients with non-aggressive type of
NAFLD (NAFL or NASH stage 0) does not require liverspecific treatments, although the prevention of

cardiovascular or renal diseases are strategically essential
in them (Fig. 1).
How to treat (Fig. 2)
Antioxidants/hepatoprotective drugs
Vitamin E Oxidative stress has been implicated to have an
important role in the progression of NASH [10, 11].
Vitamin E is well known as a free radical scavenger, and
has been expected for the treatment of NASH. We previously reported that vitamin E treatment for 1 year reduced
serum transaminase activities as well as transforming
growth factor-beta1 in adult NASH patients who were
refractory to dietary intervention [12, 13]. In pioglitazone
versus vitamin E versus Placebo for the Treatment of
Nondiabetic Patients with Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis
(PIVENS) trial, vitamin E (800 mg/day) is superior to
placebo for the improvements of NASH histology in adults
NASH without diabetes and cirrhosis [14]. According to a
random-effects model analysis of the five studies, vitamin
E significantly reduced serum hepatobiliary enzymes,
hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning compared with the control group [15]. In those
studies, however, fibrosis improvement was not confirmed.
In Japan, long-term vitamin E treatments (300 mg/day) for
more than 2 years can ameliorate hepatic fibrosis in NASH
patients, especially in those whose serum transaminase
activities and insulin resistance can be improved [16]. This
result has suggested that metabolic factors should be controlled even when vitamin E is administrated. Although
vitamin E is now recommended only for biopsy-proven
NASH patients without diabetes on the basis of PIVENS
trial, it is associated with histological improvement
regardless of diabetic status [17]. However, the primary
concern regarding vitamin E for NASH treatment has been
the potential for toxicity with long-term or high-dose use.
Vitamin E treatment may increase all-cause mortality [18],
prostatic cancer (SELECT trial) [19], and hemorrhagic
stroke [20], although several conflicting results exist. When
vitamin E is administrated for NASH, treatment with lower
dose (300–400 mg/day rather than 800 mg) of its agent
should be considered [17].
Glutathione (GSH) Glutathione (GSH), L-glutamyl-Lcysteinyl-glycine, is a tripeptide present in every cell of the
human body, and also has an anti-oxidative effect. A pilot
study found that oral administration of GSH (300 mg/day)
for 4 months can decrease ALT levels and hepatic steatosis
in Japanese NAFLD patients, in those without severe
fibrosis or uncontrolled diabetes. Large-scale clinical trials
are needed to verify its efficacy [21].
UDCA Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is covered
by health insurance for chronic liver diseases in Japan, is
known to have anti-oxidative efficacy [22]. According to a
large, multicenter RCT, standard dose of UDCA has no
effects on liver histology in NASH [23], although some
studies suggest that high dosage of this agent may show a
favorable effect. Currently, UDCA is not recommend for
NASH treatment in the guidelines [5–8].

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)
agonists (Fig. 3)
PPARc Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trials (RDBPCT) have shown that pioglitazone [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARc)
agonist] significantly ameliorated steatosis and necroinflammation compared to placebo in diabetic NASH
[24, 25]. Recently, a 3-year study in 101 NASH patients
with prediabetes/T2DM (an 18-month RCT, followed by
an 18-month open-label phase with pioglitazone treatment)
confirmed its long-term safety and efficacy [26]. However,
pioglitazone has also several concerns for wide clinical use,
such as increased risks at prostate or pancreas cancer, body
weight gain, fluid retention, bone fracture in women, and
increased cardiovascular events. INT131, which is a
selective PPARc modulator (SPPARMc), is in development for T2DM patients. INT131 demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c, equivalent to 45 mg
pioglitazone, but with less fluid accumulation and weight

gain [27]. Although no study with INT131 for the NASH
treatment has been initiated, its agent will be expected in
the future. MSDC-0602K is a PPARc-sparing thiazolidinedione. A study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
efficacy of MSDC 0602K in patients with NASH is
ongoing (EMMINENCE). This is a RDBPCT of three
doses of MSDC-0602K or placebo given orally once daily
to subjects with biopsy-proven NASH with fibrosis and no
cirrhosis (NCT02784444).
PPARa There have been no studies proving the efficacy
of PPARa agonists, such as bezafibrate or fenofibrate,
which are extensively used in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia but have no impact in NASH/NAFLD.
Bezafibrate has been believed to be effective in breast
cancer patients with tamoxifen-induced NASH [28].
Pemafibrate (K-877), a selective PPARa modulator
(SPPARMa), will be described as below.
Saroglitazar Saroglitazar is a dual PPARa/c agonist
approved for the treatment of dyslipidemia in diabetic
patients in India [29]. Phase 2 RDBPCT comparing three
doses of saroglitazar (1, 2, or 4 mg) with placebo in
NAFLD is now ongoing (EVIDENCES II; NCT03061721).
The primary endpoint of the study is percentage change
from baseline in serum ALT levels at week 16 in the
saroglitazar groups as compared to the placebo group.
Elafibranor (GFT505) Elafibranor is an unlicensed dual
agonist of PPARa/d receptors, and has been shown to
improve steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in mouse
models of NAFLD [30]. A phase IIb RDBPCT showed
patients resolving NASH without worsening hepatic
fibrosis with 120 mg elafibranor in those with NAS C 4
(GOLDEN-505) [31]. Treatment was not effective in those
with NAS \4 (19 vs. 12%, p = 0.045). A multicenter,
phase 3 RDBPCT study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
of elafibranor in NASH without cirrhosis is ongoing
(RESOLVE-IT) (NCT02704403). The primary objectives
of this study are to evaluate the effect of elafibranor
(120 mg/day) treatment in NASH patients (NAS C 4) with
stage 2/3 fibrosis compared to placebo on (1) histological
improvement and (2) all-cause mortality and liver-related
outcomes in patients with NASH and fibrosis. RESOLVEIT is a RDBPCT (2:1), conducted in approximately 2000
patients, at 250 centers worldwide.
Pan-PPAR agonist IVA337 is an anti-fibrotic treatment
with a unique mechanism of action going through the
activation of all three alpha, gamma, and delta PPARs
(pan-PPAR agonist). IVA337 is effective in experimental
skin fibrosis and lung fibrosis [32, 33]. A phase 2b
RDBPCT in NASH to assess IVA337 is now recruiting
(NATIVE). NATIVE study will investigate the safety and
efficacy of two doses of IVA337 (800 and 1200 mg/day)
over a 24-week period and will enroll up to 225 patients in
12 European countries (NCT03008070).
Antidiabetic drugs
T2DM is strongly associated with NASH and liver-related
mortality. The most important problem is what kinds of
drugs are the most appropriate for NASH/NAFLD with
diabetes among a variety of antidiabetic medications. Ideal
anti-diabetic treatments on the view of NASH treatment
must have weight-reducing efficacy, reduced cardiovascular event, prevention of HCC, low cost, and improved QOL
[34]. There are no approved diabetic therapies except
pioglitazone for NASH [5–8]. Metformin is now positioned
as the first-line therapy according to the guideline of ADA/
EASD because of its low cost, weight-reducing effect,
preventive effect on cardiovascular event, and safety profiles. Unfortunately, metformin has no data regarding
improvement in liver enzymes and histology in NASH/
NAFLD, although it is associated with a reduced incidence
of HCC and extrahepatic malignancies. Novel antidiabetic
drugs will become a candidate for the treatment of NASH
as we previously reviewed this point [34]. Incretin-associated drugs are classified into DPP4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA).
Unfortunately, there is conflicting evidence showing efficacy of DPP4 inhibitors in NASH/NAFLD patients with
diabetes, although a number of patients involved into these
studies is relatively small [34]. The efficacy of liraglutide, a
GLP-1RA, was reported in NASH patients in Western
countries (LEAN study [35]) and Japanese studies (LEANJ study [36]). That most of patients naı¨ve to injection
therapy will hesitate daily injection therapy. Dulaglutide
has some advantages such as weekly injection, disposable
and prefilled device, and similar safety profiles to other
GLP-1RAs. Semaglutide, a novel GLP-1 RA, is in
advanced stages of development for diabetes. To investigate the effect of semaglutide on NASH, a phase 2
RDBPCT comparing the efficacy and safety of three different doses of once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide versus
placebo in 372 participants with NASH is now ongoing
(NCT02970942). Semaglutide has three advantages over
other GLP-1RA. First, the SUSTAIN-6 trial showed that
semaglutide has a potential benefit on prevention of cardiovascular events [37]. Second, semaglutide is superior to
dulaglutide on glucose control and weight loss in T2DM
patients (SUSTAIN 7 trial). SUSTAIN 7 is a phase 3b,
40-week, efficacy and safety trial of 0.5 mg semaglutide
versus 0.75 mg dulaglutide and 1.0 mg semaglutide versus
1.5 mg dulaglutide, both once-weekly, as add-on to metformin in 1201 people with T2DM. Third, oral agent of
semaglutide is now under development and of clinical use
in the near future. As a result, among a variety of GLP-1
RA, dulaglutide or semaglutide will be the most promising
in the treatment of diabetic NASH [34, 38]. According to
the AASLD guidance, however, it is premature to consider

GLP-1RA to specifically treat in NASH/NAFLD patients
without diabetes [8] because of insufficient evidence. Subanalyses of three RDBPCT of SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin [39, 40], luseogliflozin [41]) for the treatment of
T2DM, serum transaminase activities in SGLT2 inhibitortreated patients were significantly reduced compared to
those in the placebo group. The finding that causes of
abnormal ALT level (31 IU/L or above) in a majority of
Japanese diabetic patients may be associated with NAFLD
[42] implies that the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor on
NASH/NAFLD patients can be expected. Several pilot
studies found significant reduction in ALT, body weight,
and the fatty liver index in NAFLD patients [43–45]. The
impact of SGLT2 inhibitor on liver histology is not confirmed. Takeda et al. reported a case of NASH with T2DM
who resolved steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning after the ipragliflozin treatment [46]. Akuta et al.
also recently demonstrated that all eight NAFLD patients
with SGLT2 administration relieved hepatic steatosis and
three of them obtained improvement in liver fibrosis [47].
Two open RCTs have been reported from Japan to compare
the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor to other diabetic medications such as pioglitazone and metformin. The first repot is
to compare the effect of luseogliflozin to metformin in
T2DM patients with NAFLD. Hepatic steatosis, evaluated
by liver-to-spleen (L/S) ratio on CT, was significantly
reduced in the luseogliflozin group compared to in the
metformin group [48]. The aim of another report is to
compare the efficacy of ipragliflozin versus pioglitazone in
NAFLD patients with T2DM. Serum ALT levels, HbA1c,
and fasting plasma glucose were similarly reduced in the
two treatment groups. Nevertheless, body weight and visceral fat area showed significant reductions only in the
ipragliflozin group compared with the pioglitazone group
[49]. A few open pilot studies of SGLT2 inhibitor in
NAFLD patients are ongoing in the western countries
(NCT02696941) or Asia (NCT02875821, NCT02964715).
The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors versus other diabetic drugs
(metformin, sulfonyl urea) is also investigated
(NCT02696941, NCT02649465). The effects of empagliflozin treatment on hepatocellular lipid content, liver
energy metabolism, and body composition is now investigated in a multicenter, RDBPCT, interventional, and
exploratory pilot study in patients with newly diagnosed
T2DM (NCT02637973).
Lipid-altering agents
Approved agents for dyslipidemia Ezetimibe, a potent
inhibitor of cholesterol absorption, has been explored for
the treatment of NASH/NAFLD, but conflicting results
exist [50–52]. Histological findings (steatosis and inflammation) have been relived after the ezetimibe treatment
without control arms [50, 51]. A RDBPCT (MOZART
study) showed that ezetimibe 10 mg orally daily for
24 weeks did not significantly affect hepatic steatosis over
placebo [52]. A meta-analysis using six studies (two RCT
and four pilot) has shown that ezetimibe may decrease
serum liver enzymes and hepatic steatosis, but histological
effectiveness remains uncertain [53]. Omega-3 fatty acids
are often administrated for patients with hypertriglyceridemia. Two large studies (EPE-A study [54], WELCOME study [55]) failed to show the therapeutic benefit of
omega-3 fatty acids in patients with NASH/NAFLD.
Omega-3 fatty acids is limited to be used in NASH/
NAFLD with hypertriglyceridemia [8]. Since NAFLD
patients are at high risk of cardiovascular morbidity or
mortality, statins could be used to treat dyslipidemia with
NASH/NAFLD [8]. Statin use seems to be associated with
inhibition of hepatic inflammation, improvement of hepatic
fibrosis, and reduced hepatocarcinogenesis [56], although
prospective RCTs are now difficult to perform.
Pemafibrate Pemafibrate, a novel SPPARMa, was
approved in Japan in 2017. In Japan, phase 2, RDBPCT
decreased serum transaminase activities as well as lipid
profiles in patients with dyslipidemia without increasing
adverse effects [57]. Pemafibrate, which improves liver
pathology in diet-induced rodent model of NASH [58], will
become a promising therapeutic agent for human NASH. In
Japan, clinical trials for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH
will begin in the near future.
Aramchol Aramchol, a cholic-arachidic acid conjugate,
has inhibitory effects of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD).
Aramchol was initially produced for treatment of gallstone
[59]. However, animal experiments showed a strong
reduction of hepatic fat accumulation rather than gallstone
dissolution. In humans, hepatic fat content was significantly reduced in the aramchol (300 mg/day) group [60].
Higher doses of aramchol (400 and 600 mg) are currently
being tested on biopsy-proven NASH patients without
cirrhosis in a 52-week phase 2b trial, which evaluates their
effect on hepatic triglyceride content using MR spectroscopy (NCT02279524).
GS0976 Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is a key enzyme
that regulates the conversion of malonyl-CoA to acetylCoA [61]. Malonyl-CoA is a key regulator of fatty acid
metabolism, controlling the balance between de novo
lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. An open-label, proofof-concept study evaluating GS-0976, an investigational
inhibitor of ACC, in NASH patients. The data, from ten
patients treated with GS-0976 20 mg taken orally once
daily for 12 weeks, indicated that treatment was associated
with statistically significant improvements in liver fat content and noninvasive markers of fibrosis (NCT02856555).
At week 12, patients receiving GS-0976 experienced a 43%
median relative decrease in liver fat content, from 15.7 to
J Gastroenterol (2018) 53:362–376 367
123

9.0% (p = 0.006), as measured by magnetic resonance
imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Median
liver stiffness, a noninvasive marker of fibrosis, declined
from 3.4 to 3.1 kPa at week 12 (p = 0.049), as assessed by
magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). In addition,
patients with reductions in hepatic fat demonstrated
improvements in liver biochemistry and serum markers of
fibrosis and apoptosis, supporting the biological activity of
GS-0976. A separate phase 2 RDBPCT evaluating GS-0976
in 126 patients with NASH is completed. According to
Liver Meeting 2017, GS-0976 demonstreated signficant
decrease in hepatic fat content and TIMP-1 (a serum marker
associated with hepatic fibrosis).
Anti-hypertensive drugs
Angiotensinogen receptor blockers (ARB) There are no
particularly favored agents for control of hypertension,
although a few studies suggest that angiotensinogen receptor
blockers (ARB) may have anti-fibrotic effects in NASH
patients [62, 63]. Unfortunately, a RDBPCT regarding the
effect of losartan for 96 weeks in NASH patients failed
because of slower recruitment than expected due to the
widespread use of ARB in NASH patients [64]. It may be
difficult to plan prospective RDBPCT to establish the efficacy or ARB for the treatment of NASH/NAFLD.
FXR ligand
Obeticholic acid (OCA) Obeticholic acid (OCA), a ligand of
farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is a synthetic variant of natural
bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid. In animal models, FXR
activation has been demonstrated to reduce hepatic glucogenesis, lipogenesis, and steatosis. In the FLINT trial,
treatment with OCA achieved a primary end-point of
improving the necro-inflammation without worsening of
fibrosis in 46% of the treated patients with NASH. Moreover,
compared to placebo, NASH resolution was obtained in 22%
of treated patients [65]. A phase 2 RDBPCT in Japan
(FLINT-J trial) showed that high doses of OCA (40 mg/day)
significantly resolved NASH compared with placebo (38 vs.
20%, p = 0.049). Fibrosis improvement in the OCA treated
group is similar to that in the placebo group. There are
plausible reasons explaining this discrepancy between
FLINT and FLINT-J study. In the FLINT-J study, NASH
with mild fibrosis at entry is prevalent. Some patients in the
OCA group refused post-treatment liver biopsy, and those
are classified into non-responders. An international, phase 3
study (REGENERATE study) is now ongoing. However,
OCA has several drawbacks, such as elevated LDL levels,
itching, and high cost [65].
INT-767 INT-767 is a bile acid analogue that acts as a
dual agonist on FXR/Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5
(TGR5). In an animal model, INT-767 improved histological features of NASH and modulated the activation of
hepatic monocytes [66]. TGR5 has been known to affect
energy metabolism, glucose homeostasis, bile composition/
secretion, and inflammation.
Non-bile acid FXR Selective non-bile acid synthetic
FXR agonists have been developed to resolve disadvantage
of OCA. Those have the potential to provide metabolic
effects without increasing side effects of pruritus and elevated LDL. Phase 2 studies with GS-9674 are ongoing in
patients with NASH (NCT02854605), primary biliary
cholangitis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC). Two other FXR agonists, LMB763 (NCT02913105)
and LJN452 (NCT02855164), have been developed and are
in phase 2 trials.
MGL-3196 The thyroid hormone receptor b (THRb) is
the predominant liver thyroxine (T4) receptor, through
which increased cholesterol metabolism and excretion
through bile is mediated. MGL-3196, a highly selective
THRb agonist, has been developed to target dyslipidemia
but has also been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis in fatfed rats [67]. Phase 2 trials are ongoing in patients with
biopsy-proven NASH and C 10% liver steatosis using
percent change from baseline hepatic fat fraction assessed
by MRI-PDFF as a primary outcome (NCT02912260).
Anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis agents
Pentoxifylline Pentoxifylline (PTX), a methylxanthine
derivative, has anti-inflammatory effects and decreases
oxidative stress. An RDBPCT showed that PTX therapy for
1 year significantly improved histological features of
NASH compared to placebo [68]. A meta-analysis evaluating five studies showed improvement histological findings such as lobular inflammation and NAS without
affecting lipid profiles [69]. However, this drug is no
longer commercially available in Japan because its initial
efficacy for treating after-effects of brain stroke was reevaluated and found to be insufficient.

(ASK1) is activated by extracellular TNFa, intracellular
oxidative or ER stress and initiates the p38/JNK pathway,
resulting in apoptosis and fibrosis [70]. Inhibition of ASK1
has therefore been proposed as a target for the treatment of
NASH. An open-label phase 2 trial evaluating the investigational ASK1 inhibitor selonsertib (GS-4997) alone or in
combination with the monoclonal antibody simtuzumab
(SIM) in NASH patients with moderate-to-severe liver
fibrosis (stages 2/3). The data demonstrate regression in
fibrosis that was, in parallel, associated with reductions in
other measures of liver injury in patients treated with
selonsertib for 24 weeks. Patients receiving selonsertib
demonstrated improvements in several measures of liver

disease severity, including fibrosis stage, progression to
cirrhosis, liver stiffness (measured by MRE), and liver fat
content (measured by MRI-PDFF). As no differences were
observed between combination and monotherapy, results
are presented for selonsertib (18 and 6 mg) with/without
SIM and for SIM alone [71]. Thus, international phase 3
trials evaluating selonsertib among NASH patients with
stage 3 (STELLAR3; NCT03053050) or cirrhosis (STELLAR4; NCT03053063) are ongoing (STELLAR program).
Tipelukast MN-001 (tipelukast) is a novel, orally
bioavailable small-molecule compound that exerts its
effects through several mechanisms to produce its antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models, including leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonism, inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE) (mainly 3 and 4), and
inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). An open-label study
to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of MN001 (Tipelukast) on HDL function and serum triglyceride
levels in NASH/NAFLD with hypertriglyceridemia is
ongoing (NCT02681055).
Emricasan Emricasan, an irreversible caspase inhibitor,
improves NAS and fibrosis in murine models of NASH
[72]. A phase 2b study in patients with NASH (stage 1-3) is
evaluating the efficacy of 72 weeks of emiricasan 10 or
100 mg (ENCORE-NF, NCT02686762). Another phase 2b
study in patients with NASH with cirrhosis and severe
portal hypertension is assessing the efficacy of three doses
Emricasan (10, 50, 100 mg/day) on portal hypertension
(ENCORE-PH, NCT02960204). Primary outcome is mean
change in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG).
Vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) inhibitor (BI
1467335) The adhesion molecule vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) is a membrane-bound amine oxidase that
promotes leukocyte recruitment to the liver, and the soluble
form (sVAP-1) accounts for most circulating monoamine
oxidase activity, has insulin-like effects, and can initiate
oxidative stress [73]. VAP-1 is directly involved in stellate
cell activation and is a strong profibrogenic stimulus. Thus,
targeting VAP-1 may result in a decrease in leukocyte
recruitment and reduction of inflammation and fibrosis. BI
1467335 is a VAP-1 inhibitor that works by blocking
leucocyte adhesion and tissue infiltration in inflammatory
process. Phase 2a trial of BI 1467335 is a multicenter,
RDBPCT in 150 patients with clinical evidence of NASH
(NCT03166735).
Gut microbiome
IMM-124e IMM-24e is an IgG-rich extract to bovine
colostrum from cows immunized against lipopolysaccharide (LPS). IMM-24e can reduce exposure of the liver to
gut-derived bacterial products and LPS. An open-label,
phase 1/2 clinical trial in ten patients with biopsy-proven
NASH improved liver enzymes as well as glycemic control
via increase in serum levels of GLP-1, adiponectin, and T
regulatory cells [74]. A phase 2 RDBPCT of IMM-124E
for 24 weeks is currently ongoing for NASH patients
(NCT02316717).
Solithromycin Solithromycin is a highly potent nextgeneration macrolide antibiotic. In a phase 2 open-label
study, all six NASH patients had reductions in NAS (mean
reduction, 1.3) and ALT level (mean reduction, 17.8 U/L)
after 90 days of treatment with solithromycin
(NCT02510599).
TLR4 antagonist JKB-121 is a long-acting small molecule that is efficacious as a weak antagonist at the Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4). It is a non-selective opioid antagonist
that has been shown to prevent the LPS-induced inflammatory liver injury in a methionine/choline-deficient diet
fed rat model of NAFLD. In vitro, JKB-121 neutralized or
reduced the LPS-induced release of inflammatory cytokines, deactivated hepatic stellate cells, inhibited hepatic
stellate cell proliferation, and collagen expression. Inhibition of the TLR4 signaling pathway may provide an
effective therapy in the prevention of inflammatory hepatic
injury and hepatic fibrosis in NASH patients [75]. A phase
2 RDBPCT trial of JKB-121 for the treatment of NASH is
ongoing (NCT02442687).
Antifibrotic agents
Given that hepatic fibrosis stage is the most important
determinant of mortality in NASH patients [9, 76], there is
an unmet medical need for an effective anti-fibrotic treatment for those with advanced fibrosis. Several anti-fibrotic
agents have been developed for the treatment of advanced
NASH.
Cenicriviroc Cenicriviroc (CVC), a C–C motif chemokine receptor-2/5 (CCR2/5) antagonist, has been developed
to primarily target inflammation. This agent has also
antifibrotic effects and improves insulin sensitivity. Macrophage recruitment through CCR2 into adipose tissue is
believed to play a role in the development of insulin
resistance and T2DM. Administration of CCR2 antagonist
resulted in modest improvement in glycemic parameters
compared with placebo [77]. CCR5 antagonist is expected
to impair the migration, activation, and proliferation of
collagen-producing hepatic stellate cells [78]. According to
phase 2b trial (CENTAUR study), significant improvement
of fibrosis without worsening NASH after 1 year of CVC
treatment was found (20%) compared with placebo (10%)
[79]. Although asymptomatic amylase elevation (grade 3)
was more frequent in the CVC group than in the placebo
group, this agent is well tolerated. Phase 3 evaluation for
the treatment of NASH with stage 2/3 fibrosis is now
ongoing and recruiting (AURORA study; NCT03028740).
J Gastroenterol (2018) 53:362–376 369

Simtuzumab (SIM) SIM is a monoclonal antibody
against the enzyme lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL-2)
responsible for the cross-linking of collagen and overexpressed during the fibrosis progression [80]. Unfortunately,
this agent could not bring additional benefit over ASK1
inhibitor to improve hepatic fibrosis in phase 2b study as
mentioned above. Finally, SIM was withdrawn from candidates of NASH treatments.
Galectin-3 antagonist Galectin-3 protein expression,
which is essential to the development of hepatic fibrosis,
was increased in NASH with the highest expression in
macrophages surrounding lipid-laden hepatocytes. In mice
models, GR-MD-02, a galectin-3 inhibitor, resulted in
marked improvement in liver histology with a significant
reduction in NASH activity and collagen deposition [81].
Although there was no safety concern in phase 2a trials in
NASH patients with stage 3 fibrosis [82], there was no
apparent improvement in the three non-invasive tests for
assessment of liver fibrosis. A phase 2b clinical trial to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of GR-MD-02 for the
treatment of liver fibrosis and resultant portal hypertension
in 162 patients with NASH cirrhosis (NASH-CX trial) is
now ongoing (NCT02462967). Top-line results will be
reported in early December 2017.
ND-LO2-s0201 Hsp47 (heat shock protein 47) is a collagen-specific molecular chaperone that is essential for the
maturation and secretion of collagen. ND-LO2-s0201 is a
vitamin A-coupled lipid nanoparticle containing siRNA
against HSP47. A phase 1 open study is completed to
evaluate in subjects with severe hepatic fibrosis (stage 3/4)
(NCT02227459).
Ongoing or scheduled clinical trials in Japan
To our best knowledge, there are several ongoing or
scheduled clinical trials in Japan. Two agents, including
semaglutide and ASK1 inhibitor, were already mentioned
above.
Nonsteroidal MRA Several nonsteroidal antagonists of
the mineralocorticoid receptor (MRA) are in clinical
development with a clear focus on the treatment of diabetic
kidney diseases. In Japan, MT3995, a novel nonsteroidal
MRA, is currently tested for the treatment of NASH (phase
2, NCT02923154).
FGF-21 (fibroblast growth factor-21) Fibroblast
growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a hepatokine, is a 181-aminoacid-secreted protein that is produced in the liver. FGF-21
regulates glucose in the liver and the white adipose tissue
and its circulating levels are elevated in NAFLD patients,
considered to play a protective role against NAFLD [83].
A RCT in a small group of obese T2DM patients with
FGF-21 found significant improvement in lipid profiles as
well as weight loss, reduced insulin levels, and raised
adiponectin [84]. A phase 2 study of BMS-986036, a
recombinant FGF-21 in NASH patients for 16 weeks, is
completed (NCT02413372). This was a multicenter
RDBPCT (1:1:1) in adults with BMI C 25 kg/m2
, biopsyproven NASH with stage 1–3, and hepatic fat fraction
C 10%, assessed by MRI-PDFF. Patients received subcutaneous injections of BMS-986036 10 mg daily
(n = 25), BMS-986036 20 mg weekly (n = 23), or placebo (n = 26) daily for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy
endpoint was absolute change in MRI-PDFF at week 16.
At week 16, both dosing regimens of BMS-986036
(10 mg daily or 20 mg weekly) significantly reduced liver
fat as measured by MRI-PDFF versus placebo (6.8 and
5.2%, respectively, Z. 1.3%, p = 0.0004 and p = 0.008).
Both dosing regimens also improved Pro-C3 (N-terminal
type III collagen propeptide, a fibrosis biomarker [85]),
liver stiffness evaluated by MRE, as well as adiponectin,
ALT, and AST. Improvements in lipid profiles were also
observed in the treatment groups. Overall, BMS-986036
had a favorable safety profile, with no deaths or serious
adverse events related to treatment, and no discontinuations due to adverse events. An international phase 3
study of BMS-986036 for the treatment of NASH with
stage 3/4 will be planned.
Drug repositioning
Amlexanox Amlexanox is an inhibitor of noncanonical IjB
kinases IKK-e and TANK-binding kinase 1. Amlexanox is
an approved small-molecule therapeutic presently used in
the clinic to treat aphthous ulcers and asthma. Treatment of
obese mice with amlexanox elevates energy expenditure
through increased thermogenesis, producing weight loss,
improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased steatosis.
Because of its record of safety in patients, amlexanox may
be an interesting candidate for clinical evaluation in the
treatment of NAFLD [86]. An open-label study and a phase
2 RDBPCT are currently assessing the effects of 12 weeks
of amlexanox in patients with diabetes, obesity, and fatty
liver on hepatic fat content by MRI, HbA1c, and weight
(NCT01975935 and NCT01842282).
Pirfenidone Pirfenidone (PFD) is an orally bioavailable
pyridone derivative that has been clinically used for the
treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [87]. PFD
markedly attenuated liver fibrosis in Western diet (WD)-
fed melanocortin 4 receptor-deficient (MC4R-KO) mice
without affecting metabolic profiles or steatosis. PFD prevented liver injury and fibrosis associated with decreased
apoptosis of liver cells in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice [88].
PFD can be repositioned as an antifibrotic drug for human
NASH.

Milestones in the treatment of NASH/NAFLD
Until now, the gold standard of assessment for treatment
efficacy in NASH has been liver histology. However,
repeated liver biopsies are practically difficult to be performed in NASH patients, because of risk, sampling error,
observers’ variability of pathological interpretation, and
cost. Simple, reliable, and cost-effective parameters should
be established to monitor the disease and evaluate the
treatment efficacy.
ALT In the sub-analysis of PIVENS study, ALT
response, which was defined as ALT reduction over 30%
from baseline or ALT levels less than 40 IU/l, reflect histological improvement [89]. As we also previously reported in 2015 [90], ALT response was the best predictor of
reduction in NAS or fibrosis regression in 52 Japanese
patients with NASH undergoing repeated biopsies.
Body weight Weight loss has been believed to be associated with improvements of liver histology in patients
with NAFLD/NASH. Data from 261 NASH patients
receiving repeated liver biopsies showed that weight loss,
the absence of diabetes, ALT normalization, and baseline
NAS less than 5 were independent predictors of NASH
resolution without fibrosis worsening after 1 year of lifestyle intervention [91].
HbA1c Decreased levels in HbA1c [92] were more
strongly associated with fibrosis improvement in 39 Japanese patients with diabetes and NAFLD who underwent
sequential liver biopsies. As a result, we believe that these
three clinical parameters, including ALT, body weight, and
HbA1c (ABC), can become the milestones in the treatment
of NASH (Fig. 4), although the appropriate goal of each
parameter to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis will be established.
FIB4 index Fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) index and NALD fibrosis
score (NFS) are now established as the best predictors of
severe fibrosis in NAFLD [8, 93–95]. FIB-4 index is simply calculated using an algorithm based on AST, ALT,
platelet count, and age. The FLINT study demonstrated
that OCA treatment of NASH patients led to a statistically
significant decrease in FIB4 index from baseline as compared to placebo (OCA: - 0.246 vs. placebo: - 0.047;
p = 0.0076). Further, a decline in FIB-4 of 10% after
24 weeks of treatment predicted improvement in fibrosis
by at least one stage as assessed by biopsy at 72 weeks
(p = 0.0448). While NFS declined in the OCA-treated
patients and increased in the placebo patients, it did not
appear to be sensitive to changes in fibrosis. This result,
presented by Dr. Sanyal in the annual meeting of AASLD
held in 2015, provides support for the use of FIB-4 index as
potential non-invasive alternative means for monitoring
fibrosis changes in response to treatment (Fig. 4).
Imaging Although imaging studies such as VCTE (Fibroscan) [96–98] and MR elastography (MRE) [99] have
been extensively studied to detect severe fibrosis in
NAFLD [8, 95], it is unknown whether these modalities are
also useful to evaluate treatment efficacy. Many ongoing
clinical trials, which evaluate clinical efficacy of NASH/
NAFLD, are using imaging modalities using MRI-PDFF/
MRE, which will become an alternative to liver biopsy.
Who should treat?
Diabetes specialist should pay attention to liver status.
Three studies using Fibroscan showed that 12–18% of
diabetic patients are estimated to have significant liver
fibrosis by different cutoffs [100–102]. Another study using
MRE found that advanced fibrosis (defined as
MRE C 3.6 kPa) was 7.1% in diabetic patients [103]. In a
cross-sectional multicenter study conducted by JSGNAFLD, the presence of diabetes is associated with
advanced fibrosis in 1365 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients
[104]. These results imply the importance of collaboration
between the hepatologists and diabetes team. However, the
leading cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD is
cardiovascular diseases, followed by extrahepatic cancer
and liver-related diseases [105]. There are a variety of
stakeholders in the treatment of NASH/NAFLD, including
the hepatologist, cardiologist, endocrinologist, dietician,
and patients (Fig. 5). Lifestyle modification intervention
and pharmacotherapies should be delivered in collaboration with multi-disciplinary medical staff [106] (Fig. 5).

Future perspectives
Clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with NAFLD/
NASH are shown in Table 2. The primary endpoint should
be measurable, sensitive to change, clinically meaningful,
and be able to be quantified consistently. Reversal of
steatohepatitis with at least no worsening of fibrosis has
been considered as a primary endpoint of clinical trials.
Although hepatic fibrosis is the most critical determinant
of all-cause or liver-related mortality in NASH, it remains
to be solved whether improvement in hepatic fibrosis can
lead to prevention of liver-related mortality in NASH
patients. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes is dramatically increasing worldwide. NASH-related liver diseases (HCC, hepatic failure, and variceal hemorrhage) will
soon be the leading causes of liver transplantation. It is
estimated that the market size of NASH will reach 49
billion in 2027 in US, Japan, and EU 5 (England, France,
Germany, Italy, and Spain). When pharmacotherapies are
initiated for the target of liver disease in NASH/NAFLD,
benefits and risks should be discussed with patients [8].
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) should be evaluated
before and after pharmacotherapies. It is estimated that the
risk for HCC development in NASH/NAFLD without
advanced fibrosis is very small given the extremely large
number of patients without advanced fibrosis within the
general population. Economical cost and benefit should
also be balanced [107].
Conclusions
To prevent liver-related morbidity/mortality in NASH
patients, those with fibrosis should be considered for
pharmacotherapies in addition to conventional dietary
interventions. The first-line therapy for those without diabetes is vitamin E on the basis of accumulating evidence,
although its impact on preventive effect of hepatic fibrosis
and hepatocarcinogenesis remain uncertain. Diabetic
NASH patients should be preferentially treated with novel
drugs licensed for diabetes treatment such as GLP-1RA and
SGLT2 inhibitors. SPPARMa (pemafibrate) is promising
in NASH patients with dyslipidemia. There are currently
several innovative agents in the drug pipeline for NASH
worldwide. Four drugs (OCA, elafibranor, selonsertib, and
