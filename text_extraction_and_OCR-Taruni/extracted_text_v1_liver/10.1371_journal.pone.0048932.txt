Abstract
Background: Salvage liver transplantation (SLT) is restricted to patients who develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
recurrence within Milan criteria (MC). Little is known about outcomes for SLT in patients with recurrent HCC within
University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria after liver resection (LR).
Methods: Between January 2001 and December 2011, 380 patients with HCC meeting UCSF criteria, 200 of which were
resected (LR group) from a perspective of SLT in case of recurrence, and 180 directly underwent LT (PLT). We compared
patient characteristics, perioperative and long-term outcomes between SLT and PLT groups. We also assessed the outcome
of LR and PLT groups.
Results: Among the 200 patients in LR group, 86 (43%) developed HCC recurrence and 15/86 (17%) of these patients
presented HCC recurrence outside UCSF criteria. Only 39 of the 86 patients underwent SLT, a transplantation rate of 45% of
patients with HCC recurrence. Compared with PLT group, LR group showed lower overall survival rate (P = 0.005) and higher
recurrence rate (P = 0.006). Although intraoperative blood loss and required blood transfusion were more frequent in SLT
group, the perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were similar in SLT and PLT groups. The overall survival
and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between the two groups. When stratifying by graft type in the SLT group,
overall survival and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between deceased donor LT (DDLT) and living donor LT
(LDLT) groups. In the subgroup analysis by MC, similar results were observed between patients with recurrent HCC meeting
MC and patients with recurrent HCC beyond MC but within UCSF criteria.
Conclusion: Our single institution experience demonstrated that prior hepatectomy and SLT for recurrent HCC within UCSF
criteria was feasible and SLT could achieve the same outcome as PLT.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC), which is the fifth most
common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide,is a global health problem [1,2]. Liver transplantation (LT) is the optimal therapy for patients with HCC and
decompensated cirrhosis (Child class B–C) [3] because it removes
not only the tumor but also the underlying cirrhotic liver that is at
risk for the development of de novo HCC. However, the shortage of
donor organs represents the major problem in applying primary
transplantation to all patients. Liver resection (LR) is still the firstline treatment in patients with HCC and preserved liver function
(Child class A) [3], however, the long-term prognosis is undermined by a high incidence of HCC recurrence, up to 50–70% of
cases 5 years after surgery [4–6]. The combination of both
treatments can be a reasonable strategy: HCC patients, within
Milan criteria [7] (single nodule #5 cm or two or three nodules
,3 cm) and with preserved liver function, can successfully
undergo LR, limiting the transplantation option to cases of tumor
recurrence or hepatic decompensation. LR as a primary therapy
with LT in mind for tumor recurrence or deterioration in liver
function, so-called salvage transplantation, was first proposed by
Majno et al [8].
The two largest initial studies on salvage LT have reported
conicting results. Belghiti et al. concluded that liver resection
before transplantation does not increase the morbidity or impair
long-term survival after LT [9]. Similar results have been reported
by Gaudio et al and other workers [10–12]. Whereas the other
report associated LT after resection with higher operative
mortality, an increased risk of recurrence, and a poorer outcome
than primary LT [13]. The previous studies on salvage LT were
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e48932

based on deceased donor LT (DDLT); recently, Hwang et al [14]
also concluded that combinations of recipient prior hepatectomy
and living-donor liver graft were feasible for salvage living donor
LT (LDLT), suggesting that salvage procedures should be
extended to the living-donor setting. To date, at least 3 reports
have analyzed the results of salvage LDLT after liver resection for
HCC [14–16]. However, few studies have been performed to
compare the short and long-term outcomes of LDLT and DDLT
in patients with recurrent HCC after LR.
Moreover, salvage LT is restricted to patients who develop
recurrence within Milan criteria and could represent a loss of
opportunity for the subgroup of patients who develop recurrence
beyond Milan criteria. Nevertheless, Yao et al [17] proposed that
the indication for LT for HCC be expanded to include any solitary
tumor less than 6.5 cm, or three or fewer nodules with the largest
lesion being less than 4.5 cm and a total tumor diameter of less
than 8 cm (the so-called University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF) criteria). Similarly, Duffy et al [18] reported their single
institution experience with LT for HCC and demonstrated
prolonged survival after LT for tumors beyond Milan criteria
but within UCSF criteria. Given these reports, we wondered
whether the salvage procedure might be useful in patients with
recurrent HCC within UCSF criteria after LR.
Here, we analyzed retrospectively 380 HCC patients within
UCSF criteria who underwent LR or LT at our institute between
January 2001 and December 2011. We investigated the short- and
long-term outcomes of salvage LT for patients with recurrent
HCC within UCSF criteria after hepatectomy. In additional, we
examined the short- and long-term outcomes of salvage LT for
patients by comparing LDLT with DDLT.
Patients and Methods
Patient Selection
The study was performed from January 2001 to December
2011 and included 380 patients younger than 65 years with HCC
within UCSF criteria on imaging. All the 380 patients were
potentially transplantable according to UCSF criteria. HCC was
diagnosed on the basis of standard clinical criteria, imaging criteria
and a fetoprotein levels (AFP), and diagnosis was confirmed by
histological examination of the liver specimens. All HCC were
examined by experienced hepatopathologists and categorized
based on tumor number, size, differentiation grade, microscopic
vascular invasion, satellite nodules [19], and fibrosis classification
scheme proposed by Ishak et al [20].
Among the 380 patients, LR was offered as initial treatment in
200 patients with resectable disease and an adequate estimated
post-resection liver function reserve. Anatomic resection, with
complete removal of at least one Couinaud’s segment including
the tumor area fed by portal branches, was considered [21]. If
anatomic resection was not technically possible, we tried to obtain
an appropriate margin, greater than 2 cm [22]. Patients with
chronic hepatitis B were all treated by appropriate antiviral
therapy before and after surgery. Postoperative follow-up included
liver function tests, level of serum AFP and abdominal ultrasonography on a 3-month basis in the first 6 months after surgery
and on a 6-month basis in the subsequent period, and chestabdominal CT scan once a year. The strategy was to consider LT
for patients who would have developed hepatic HCC recurrence
or deterioration of liver function after resection during follow-up.
Accordingly, among the 200 transplantable patients, 39 (19.5%)
were subsequently transplanted: all for tumor recurrence. All
recurrences were discussed at the multidisciplinary meeting and
were classified as transplantable or nontransplantable using the
same criteria (UCSF criteria).
Patients with deteriorated liver function or unresectable disease
were evaluated for LT. The 180 patients transplanted for HCC in
the study period were selected according to the following
pretransplant criteria: age ,65 years, absence of metastatic lymph
nodes or extrahepatic spread at the preoperative evaluation,
absence of macroscopic vascular invasion, no history of other
malignant tumors within the last 5 years, HCC meeting UCSF
criteria. Recurrence was defined as the appearance of a new lesion
with features of HCC on imaging. In our institution, the criteria
for salvage LT were basically similar to those for primary LT.
Preoperative staging routinely included hepatic ultrasound, chest
and abdominal computer tomography (CT), and bone scintigraphy to look for any extrahepatic tumor spread. In order to avoid
the progression of the tumor in the waiting list period,
pretreatment for HCC that included transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and a combination
of these strategies had been adopted.
A total of 219 patients underwent primary or salvage LT for
HCC within UCSF criteria. All the liver grafts were from brain
dead donors or living donors. The selection criteria for the donor
and recipient as well as surgical techniques for both donor and
recipient operations have been described in detail elsewhere

[23,24]. A detail description of the immunosuppression regimen
was described in previous investigation [25]. All patients were
followed after surgery by our surgical team, with CT scans of the
chest and abdomen every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6
months thereafter. Also, AFP level was measured every 3 months.
Additional imaging techniques (magnatic resonance imaging
(MRI), bone scintigraphy) were performed if recurrent HCC was
suspected. The patients were followed until April 2012 or their
death.
Ethics Statement
All clinical investigations were in accordance with the ethical
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was
obtained from the Committee of Ethics in West China Hospital of
Sichuan University. Living and deceased donations were voluntary
and altruistic in all cases, and written informed consent was
obtained from both donors and recipients before surgery.

Design of the Study
LR in patients potentially eligible for transplantation (n = 200)
was compared with primary LT patients (n = 180), to assess the
outcome of each treatment strategy. Survival in each group was
calculated from the time of the primary procedure (LR or LT).
Salvage LT after LR for HCC (n = 39) was compared to primary
LT for HCC (n = 180) to assess the operative risk and the
postoperative complications of this surgical procedure. Moreover,
we performed subgroup analysis in the salvage LT group by graft
type (LDLT or DDLT) and selection criteria (within Milan criteria
or beyond Milan but within UCSF criteria). Survival in each
group was calculated from the time of transplantation.
Statistical Analysis
Patient baseline characteristics are expressed as mean 6
standard deviation (SD) and median with range for continuous
data, and as frequency for categorical data. Statistical analysis was
performed using Student t test, Mann-Whitney test, x
2 test, Fisher’s
exact test, log-rank test, and Cox regression. Cumulative overall
survival and recurrence rates were calculated using the KaplanMeier method, and the differences between curves were evaluated
using the log-rank test. The Cox model with the determination of
the hazard ratio was applied to evaluate the risk associated with
prognostic variables. Univariate results were reported as hazard
ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The variables reaching
statistical significance by univariate analysis were then included for
multivariate analysis with proportional hazard regression. P,0.05
was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were

software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
LR Versus Primary LT
Demographic data and tumor characteristics. The clinical and tumor characteristics of patients are listed in Table S1.
Child-Pugh class-A patients predominated in the LR group and
class-B and -C patients in the LT group. Also, the MELD score
was likewise significantly lower in the LR group than in the LT
group (P = .001).Preoperative nonsurgical treatments (TACE,
RFA) were more prevalent in the primary LT group (P,.001).
Moreover, a single tumor was more common in the LR group
than in the LT group. No significant differences were observed
regarding other clinical and tumor characteristics between LR
group and LT group.
HCC recurrence in LR group and primary LT
group. Among 200 patients eligible for transplantation that
underwent LR, 86/200 (43%) developed HCC recurrence and
15/86 (17%) of this subgroup of patients presented an HCC
recurrence outside UCSF criteria. The most common site of
recurrence was intrahepatic, and only ten cases of HCC
recurrence was extrahepatic (including lung, right adrenal gland,
bone).The median time to recurrence was 12.9612 months
(range, 6–67) with no significant difference between recurrence
within UCSF and beyond UCSF (12.5612 versus 13.2611
months, P = NS). Among the 71 patients with HCC recurrence
within UCSF, 39 (54.9%) underwent a salvage LT with a median
time on the waiting list of 2 months. The remaining 32 patients
with HCC recurrence within UCSF criteria were not transplanted
for the following reasons: in 10 cases because they were over 65
years at the time of HCC recurrence, in 5 cases due to death on
the waiting list, the occurrence of significant comorbidities during
follow-up representing contraindications for LT (severe ischemic
heart disease) in 5 patients, and 12 patients were denied LT at the
time of recurrence (n = 5) or were lost to follow-up (n = 7).
Among 180 patients underwent primary LT, 49/180 (27.2%)
developed HCC recurrence and 6/49 (12%) of this subgroup of
patients presented an HCC recurrence outside UCSF criteria. The
most common site of recurrence was intrahepatic, and only four
cases of HCC recurrence was extrahepatic (including lung and
lumbar vertebra). The median time to recurrence was 20614
months (range, 9–61). The mean time to recurrence in the primary
LT group was significantly longer than that in the LR group
(P = 0.038).
Long-Term outcomes. Cumulative overall survival and
recurrence curves of the two groups are shown in Fig 1A and
Fig 1B. LR patients had 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of 77, 62,
and 52%, respectively, versus 90, 81, and 72% in the primary LT
group, respectively. This trend in improved survival with primary
LT was statistically significant (P = .005). Meanwhile, LR patients
had 1-, 3- and 5-year recurrence rates of 25, 41, and 53%,
respectively, versus 11, 25, and 31% in the primary LT group,
respectively. This trend in increased recurrence with LR was
statistically significant (P = .006).
Salvage LT Versus Primary LT
Demographic data. The demographic data and tumor
characteristics of LT patients are presented in Table 1. No
significant differences were observed regarding age, sex, or liver
disease etiology between primary LT group and salvage LT group.
The majority of HCCs in both groups were related to hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection. However, the proportion of Child-Pugh
classification A was significantly higher in the salvage LT group
than in the primary LT group (P,.001). The MELD score was
likewise significantly lower in the salvage LT group than in the
primary LT group (P = .003). Fifty-eight percent of patients had
antitumor treatment before LT in the primary LT group,

including TACE, RFA, and a combination of the two strategies;
while 46% in the salvage LT group. The median interval on the
waiting list was 3 months (range 1–10 months) for patients who
underwent primary LT, 2 months (range 1–7 months) for patients
who underwent salvage LT.
Among the 39 salvage LT patients, 10 patients underwent
major hepatectomy before LT and the remained 29 patients
underwent minor liver resection. Graft types included cadaveric
whole organs in 30 patients (salvage DDLT group) and right lobe
living donor grafts (adult to adult) in 9 patients(salvage LDLT
group). Age, sex, liver disease etiology, Child-Pugh score, MELD
score, and pretransplant treatments did not significantly differ
between the two groups.
Tumor characteristics. There was no significant difference
in neoplasm size, tumor number, differentiation or satellitosis
between the primary and salvage LT groups. Furthermore, no
difference in Milan criteria was apparent. However, patients in the
salvage LT group showed a greater incidence of microscopic
vascular invasion (P = .01). Moreover, a higher proportion of
patients in the salvage LT group had the preoperative serum AFP
level less than 400 ng/mL (P = .02). Similar results were observed
between salvage DDLT and salvage LDLT groups, except for the
microscopic vascular invasion and preoperative serum AFP level.
Patients in the salvage LDLT group had a greater proportion of
multiple tumors than those in the salvage DDLT group (66.7% vs.
36.7%); however, this difference was not statistically significant.
Perioperative outcomes. Primary LT versus Salvage LT:
Operation profiles and posttransplant complications are summarized in Table 2. Operation time was not greatly prolonged in the
salvage compared with the primary LT group. However, patients
in the salvage LT group showed significantly more intraoperative
blood loss (P,.001) and required more packed red blood cell
transfusion (P = .007). The incidence rates of various posttransplant complications were similar in the salvage and primary LT
groups. No difference was observed in perioperative mortality,
intense care unit (ICU) stay or hospital stay duration.
Salvage DDLT versus Salvage LDLT: No significant differences
were observed between the two groups regarding operation time,
intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications, including
bleeding, vascular complication, biliary complication, sepsis,
primary graft dysfunction and acute rejection. Patients in the
salvage LDLT group required more packed red blood cell
transfusion, however, this difference was not statistically significant
(P = .08). Similarly, no difference was observed in perioperative
mortality, ICU stay or hospital stay duration between salvage
DDLT group and salvage LDLT group.
Long-Term outcomes. Survival and tumor recurrence data
are shown in Table 3. Overall survival for the entire cohort LT

patients at 1, 3, and 5 years after transplantation were 89%, 80%,
and 69%; and the tumor recurrence rates for the entire cohort LT
patients at 1, 3, and 5 years after transplantation were 12%, 24%,
and 32% respectively.
The factors related to survival in the cohort LT patients are
presented in Table S2. Univariate analysis showed that tumor
number, tumor size, microscopic vascular invasion, poor differentiation, satellitosis nodules, and tumor beyond Milan criteria were
significantly associated with reduced survival after LT for HCC.
On multivariate analysis (Table 4), only microscopic vascular
invasion (P = .003), poor differentiation (P ,.001), and satellitosis
nodules (P = .04 ) independently predicted poor survival; tumor
number, tumor size, and tumor beyond Milan criteria did not
independently inuence post-transplant survival. To specially
mention, the treatment modality (primary vs. salvage LT) did
not affect overall survival significantly on multivariate analysis.
Primary LT versus Salvage LT: Cumulative overall survival
curves of the two groups are shown in Fig 2A. Patients in the
primary LT group had slightly higher 5-year survival rates
compared with patients in the salvage LT group (5-year rates, 72%
vs. 61%, respectively); however, this difference was not statistically
significant (P = .54). The 5-year recurrence rates also did not
significantly differ between the two groups (31% vs. 33%,
respectively, Fig 2B).
Moreover, we divided the results obtained in two periods:
patients enrolled from 2001 to 2006 and after 2006. Survival and
tumor recurrence data during the two periods are shown in Table
S3. From 2001 to 2006, 68 HCC patients within UCSF criteria
underwent primary LT, while 17 patients with recurrent HCC
meeting the criteria underwent salvage LT. The long-term overall
survival and recurrence rates did not differ significantly between
primary LT and salvage LT groups during the first period (overall
survival, P = .46; recurrence, P = .62). From 2006 to 2011, 112
HCC patients within UCSF criteria underwent primary LT, while
22 patients with recurrent HCC meeting the criteria underwent
salvage LT. The long-term overall survival and recurrence rates
did not differ significantly between primary LT and salvage LT
groups during the second period (overall survival, P = .20;
recurrence, P = .55).
Salvage DDLT versus Salvage LDLT: Long-term overall
survival rates did not differ significantly between salvage DDLT
and salvage LDLT groups (5-year rates, 67% and 60%,
respectively, Fig 3A). The 5-year recurrence rates also did not
significantly differ between the two groups (31% vs. 40%,
respectively, Fig 3B).
Long-term outcomes in the salvage LT group according to
selection criteria: The 39 patients who underwent salvage LT were
divided into two groups (group A, recurrent HCC within Milan
criteria; group B, recurrent HCC beyond Milan but within UCSF
criteria). Patients with recurrent HCC within Milan criteria had
slightly higher 3-year and 5-year survival rates compared with
those with recurrent HCC beyond Milan but within UCSF criteria
(3-year rates, 83% vs. 69%; 5-year rates, 66% vs. 55%,
respectively, Fig 4A); however, this difference was not statistically
significant (P = .50). The 1, 3, and 5-year recurrence rates also did
not significantly differ between the two groups (Fig 4B).
Discussion
In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the outcome of
patients with HCC meeting UCSF criteria selected for LR and
LT. The overall survival after LR in our series was 52% at 5 years.
However, Facciuto et al [11] reported that 5-year survivals of 35%
for HCC patients beyond Milan criteria, and Fong et al. [4],
reported 3-year and 5-year survivals of 48% and 33%, respectively, for patients with tumors greater than 5 cm. One
explanation for this discrepancy is that a large proportion of
HCC in our series were within Milan criteria. The 1-, 3- and 5-
year survival rates were 90, 81, and 72% and 1-, 3- and 5-year
recurrence rates of 11, 25, and 31% in the primary LT group,
which showed reduced incidence of recurrence and improved
survival compared to LR group. In fact, similar results had been
observed by some previous studies [26–28]. However, the choice
of a particular treatment option would depend on individual liver
function and availability of a donor liver in the setting of shortage
of donor organs. Our purpose was not to compare two treatment
groups, but to ascertain the outcome of a combined strategy
employing prior LR and salvage LT for HCC meeting UCSF
criteria.
Moreover, LR has several advantages for patients with HCC
meeting UCSF criteria and well-preserved liver function. First, LR
is technically far less complex than LT and can be performed
without delay. Second, for patients with HCC meeting UCSF
criteria and well-preserved liver function, LR would achieve
recurrence-free, long-term survival in nearly a half of patients in
our series, and a half of grafts are saved for the community and
can be transplanted to other patients who have no other
alternative. Last but not least, patients with HCC beyond Milan
criteria are at higher risk of disease progression and higher
dropout rate on waiting list [29]. LR could achieve initial control
of the tumor and decrease dropout rate, leaving salvage LT as a
reserve option to manage recurrence.
The Milan criteria [7] for HCC have been widely used as the
guideline for the selection of candidates for LT in many
transplantation centers. In recent years, some investigators have
argued that the Milan criteria are too restrictive and limit the
transplant option at a time when the incidence of HCC is
increasing. Several recent series have demonstrated good outcomes using expanded criteria (the UCSF criteria), with long-term
survival similar to Milan criteria [18,30–32]. Similar results were
observed in our study. In the present report of 219 patients
managed in a single institution, LT is confirmed as appropriate
and effective treatment for patients with HCC meeting UCSF
criteria, with 1, 3, 5-year survival rates of 89%, 80%, 69% and 1,
3, 5-year recurrence rates of 12%, 24%, 32%, respectively.
Salvage LT, which was first proposed by Majno et al [8], is
restricted to patients who develop recurrence within Milan criteria
and could represent a loss of opportunity for the subgroup of
patients who develop recurrence beyond Milan criteria. Recently,
Kaido et al [15] reported that the selection criteria for salvage LT
to treat recurrent HCC could be expanded to Kyoto criteria
(tumor number #10, the maximal diameter of each tumor was
#5 cm and serum des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin levels of
#400 mAU/mL). However, the patient cohort in their study was
small and the Kyoto criteria was based on salvage LDLT. As
mentioned above, LT for HCC within UCSF criteria could
achieve excellent long-term survival similar to Milan criteria.
Nevertheless, little is known about outcomes for salvage LT in
patients with recurrent HCC within UCSF criteria after LR.
Hence, a study about salvage LT for recurrent HCC within UCSF
criteria was of great value. Here, we found favorable short- and
long-term outcomes in 39 patients who underwent LT for
recurrent HCC meeting UCSF criteria after LR.
Although the intraoperative blood loss and required blood
transfusion were more frequent than primary LT group, the
operation time was not prolonged in salvage LT group. Moreover,
the perioperative mortality and posttransplant complications were
similar in the salvage and primary LT groups. The larger volume

of intraoperative blood loss in the salvage LT group might be
caused by intra-abdominal adhesion. Heavy adhesions are often
encountered after prior LR, and minute collaterals penetrate into
such adhesions in patients with portal hypertension. Inattentive
dissection of such perihepatic adhesions could result in many
uncontrollable sites of pinpoint bleeding at the dissection surface.
The similar phenomenon was also observed by Adam et al and
Hwang et al [13.14]. Adam et al [13] reported that their 17
patients who underwent salvage LT after LR versus 195 who
underwent primary LT for HCC showed higher blood requirements. Hwang et al [14] reported that bleeding complications
occurred more frequently in patients undergoing salvage LDLT
than those undergoing primary LDLT.
The overall survival and recurrence rates did not significantly
differ between the primary LT and salvage LT groups. However,
both in primary LT and in salvage LT groups, the rates of HCC
recurrence were higher compared to previous literature reports
[8–10,13–15]. For example, the 5-year recurrence rates in the
primary LT and salvage LT groups were 31% and 33% in the
present study. Nevertheless, Kaido et al [15] reported that the 5-
year recurrence rates in the primary LT and salvage LT groups
were 8% and 22%. These inconsistent results may be due to
different criteria for salvage LT. Such as, most previous studies
used Milan criteria to screen patient for salvage LT; while the
UCSF criteria was used to screen patient for salvage LT in our
study. Other factors in these studies such as small sample size and
different ethnicities could also cause the inconsistent results. When
stratifying by Milan criteria in the salvage LT group, the overall
survival and recurrence rates did not significantly differ between
patients with recurrent HCC meeting Milan criteria and patients
with recurrent HCC beyond Milan but within UCSF criteria,
which indicated that salvage LT for recurrent HCC beyond Milan
but within UCSF criteria was feasible.
The initial studies on salvage LT were based on DDLT;
however, several recent series [14–16] indicated that combinations
of recipient prior hepatectomy and living-donor liver graft were
feasible for salvage LDLT. However, to the best of our knowledge,
few studies have been performed to compare the short- and longterm outcomes of LDLT and DDLT in patients with recurrent
HCC after LR. In the primary LT setting, Gondolesi et al. [33]
reported comparable results in HCC patients who underwent LT
using living donors or deceased donors. Di Sandro et al [34] also
reported that LDLT guarantees the same long-term results as DDLT. In the present study, no significant differences were
observed between salvage DDLT and LDLT group regarding
operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative complications and perioperative mortality. Patients in the salvage LDLT
group required more packed red blood cell transfusion, however,
this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, the longterm overall survival and recurrence rates did not differ
significantly between salvage DDLT and salvage LDLT groups,
which indicated DDLT and LDLT could equally achieve the
salvage procedure.
The most common cause of death in patients who underwent
either LR or LT was HCC recurrence. The pathologic factors
associated with biologic aggressiveness include tumor differentiation grade histologic type, presence of a peritumoral capsule, and
microscopic vascular invasion [35–37]. Not surprisingly, microscopic vascular invasion, poor differentiation, and satellitosis
nodules were independent predictors of poor survival in our
series. These determinants have been associated with poor
outcome in prior series [37–39]. The univariate analysis showed
that tumor size, tumor number, and tumor beyond Milan criteria
were also significantly associated with reduced survival after LT
for HCC, however, these factors were excluded in the multivariate
analysis. One explanation for the phenomenon is that these
preoperative tumor characteristics may not be better indicators of
post-LT tumor biology behavior. Based on personal observations,
we found that some patients with small tumors, however, will still
do poorly after transplant while others outside UCSF boundaries
can still surprise us and do well. The multinational database
analysis from Onaca also showed good results for some expanded
tumors, with 5-year survival above 60% for patients with 2 to 4
tumors from 3 to 5 cm [30].Some tumors, even large or extensive
ones, exhibit less aggressive biology than do others.
Preoperative locoregional therapy, which was used in more than
half of our patients, was not associated with improved posttransplant survival on multivariate analysis. Our results were
consistent with some previous reports [17,29]. Locoregional
treatments do, however, have the potential to prevent waiting list
drop out due to tumor progression. Lu et al [40] reported RFA to
be an effective bridge to LT, as it limited the dropout rate from LT
candidacy to only 5.8% and contributed to post-LT survival rates
of 85% and 76% at 1 and 3 years after transplant. Hence;
locoregional therapy remains a viable tool for local tumor control,
particularly in patients with advanced HCC facing prolonged
waits for LT.
In conclusion, salvage LT for recurrent HCC within UCSF
criteria was feasible and it could achieve the same outcome as
primary LT. Moreover, salvage LDLT could achieve the same
short- and long-term outcomes as salvage DDLT. Since our study
was limited to a single center experience and a retrospective
research, it is critical that multicentric studies and an intention-totreat analysis should be performed to confirm our results.
