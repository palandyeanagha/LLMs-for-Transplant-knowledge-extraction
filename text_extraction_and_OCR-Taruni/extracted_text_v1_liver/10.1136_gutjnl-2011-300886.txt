GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an
increasing cause of liver disease necessitating liver
transplantation. In patients with advanced NASH,
there are often coexistent clinical issues that impact
on the outcome of liver transplantation. There are
no guidelines for the assessment and management
of patients with NASH undergoing liver transplantation.
A group was therefore invited by the Council of
the British Transplant Society (BTS) to prepare
guidelines for the management of NASH before and
after liver transplantation. The guideline is
approved by the British Society of Gastroenterology, the British Association for the Study of Liver
and NHS Blood and Transplant.
The first draft was written by Dr P N Newsome
(senior lecturer and consultant hepatologist, Liver
Unit, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust) in Autumn 2010 with contributions
from the following guideline group: Dr Peter
Henriksen (consultant cardiologist and honorary
senior lecturer, Edinburgh Heart Centre, NHS
Lothian, University Hospitals Division), Professor C
P Day (Professor of Liver Medicine, Institute of
Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University), Dr D
Thorburn (consultant hepatologist, Liver Unit,
Royal Free Hospital, London), Mr D F Mirza
(consultant hepatobiliary and transplant surgeon,
Liver Unit, University Hospital Birmingham NHS
Foundation Trust), Dr J W Ferguson (consultant
hepatologist and honorary senior lecturer, Liver
Unit, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust), Dr G Auzinger (consultant intensive
care medicine, Liver Intensive Therapy Unit, King’s
College Hospital London NHS Foundation Trust),
Dr M Allison (consultant hepatologist, Liver Unit,
Department of Medicine, Cambridge University
Hospital NHS Foundation Trust), Dr J W Tomlinson
(reader in endocrinology, Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of
Birmingham), H Manley (British Liver Trust), Dr K J
Simpson (senior lecturer in hepatology, University of
Edinburgh and honorary consultant physician,
Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit, Royal Infirmary
Edinburgh), Professor S G Hubscher (Leith Professor
and Professor of Hepatic Pathology, University of
Birmingham, and consultant histopathologist,
University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation
Trust), Dr C Millson (consultant hepatologist, St
James’s University Hospital, Leeds), Dr J Oben
(Wellcome Trust senior lecturer and consultant
hepatologist, University College London, Centre for
Hepatology, Royal Free Hospital, London), Professor
J M Neuberger (Associate Medical Director for
Organ Donation and Transplantation, NHS Blood
and Transplant and honorary consultant physician,
Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham), Dr P J
McKiernan (consultant paediatrician, Liver Unit,
Birmingham Children’s Hospital) and Dr J I Wyatt
(consultant histopathologist, St James’s University
Hospital, Leeds).
This followed a systematic review of the literature using retrieval from electronic databases and
reading suggestions from colleagues. There was also
significant input from the British Liver Trust across
the whole document as well as the section on
patient perspective.
The document was revised in the autumn and
winter of 2010, principally by Dr P N Newsome and
Dr P A Andrews (Chair, BTS Standards Committee).
The last date of literature review was November
2010. A draft version was circulated to members of
the BTS Council and placed on the BTS website for
comment in March 2011 (http://www.bts.org.uk/
transplantation/standards-and-guidelines/). The final
version was revised in the light of comments received
in April 2011.
These guidelines represent consensus opinion
from experts in the UK in the fields of hepatology,
transplantation and related disciplines. They
represent a snapshot of the evidence available at the
time of writing. It is recognised that recommendations are made even when the evidence is weak,
and indeed much of the evidence quoted is level C
(consensus opinion) and so this document in many
parts serves a consensus statement rather than
clinical guidelines. However, as there is clear
evidence in many sections and given that this
document has been endorsed by the British Society
of Gastroenterology, the British Association for the
Study of Liver, BTS and UK and Ireland Transplant,
it is felt the paper states a guideline. Although it is
believed that the information presented is a fair
summary of current evidence and best practice,
neither the authors nor the BTS can be held
responsible for any errors or omissions. The guidelines are not designed to be proscriptive, nor to
define a standard of care. Doses of prescribed drugs
should always be checked by the responsible clinician according to the relevant information provided
by the manufacturers of the drugs.
It is anticipated that these guidelines will be
revised in 2015.

GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS
For each recommendation, assessments have been made of the
quality of supporting evidence and the strength of the recommendation. This is in keeping with other national guideline
groups.1
For each recommendation, the quality of evidence has been
graded as one of:
1. Level AdData derived from multiple randomised clinical
trials or meta-analyses.
2. Level BdData derived from a single randomised trial or nonrandomised studies.
3. Level CdConsensus opinion of experts, case studies or
standard of care.
For each recommendation, the strength of recommendation has
been indicated as one of:
1. Class IdConditions for which there is evidence and/or
general agreement that a given evaluation, procedure or
treatment is beneficial and effective.
2. Class IIdConditions for which there is conflicting evidence
and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/efficacy
of an evaluation, procedure or treatment.
3. Class IIadWeight of evidence/opinion is in favour of
usefulness/efficacy.
4. Class IIbdUsefulness/efficacy is less well established by
evidence/opinion.
5. Class IIIdConditions for which there is evidence and/or
general agreement that an evaluation/procedure/treatment is
not useful/effective and in some cases may be harmful.
There are few data on transplant assessment of patients with
NASH and therefore most recommendations are grade II or III
and level C.
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
Indications for liver transplantation in NASH related cirrhosis
1. Criteria for diagnosis of NASH group should include an
established clinical and histological diagnosis of NASH on liver
biopsy, or a histological diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis with
a clinical phenotype compatible with underlying NASH, as
defined by the presence of three or more components of the
metabolic syndrome prior to liver transplant (LT). (Level C,
Class I).
2. Criteria for consideration of listing for LT in patients with
NASH cirrhosis either due to end stage liver disease or
presence of hepatocellular carcinoma should be in line with
standard national criteria. (Level C, Class I).
Assessment of operative risk in NASH patients undergoing liver
transplant
3. Although the diagnosis of NASH cirrhosis should not be
regarded, in itself, to be a risk factor for poor outcome in the
perioperative period of LT, cardiovascular risk should be
closely considered in patients with NASH as they have more
risk factors for cardiovascular disease and are likely to require
further non-invasive testing. (Level C, Class I).
4. All NASH patients should undergo preoperative risk
stratification to exclude symptomatic coronary artery
disease and assessment for the presence of structural heart
disease, left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. (Level C, Class I).
5. Patients unable to achieve four metabolic equivalence of
tasks (METs), or those with at least one intermediate risk
factor should be considered for further cardiac testing. (Level
C, Class I).
6. Within a transplant centre, cardiology input should be
provided by cardiologists with an interest/experience in the
assessment of patients with liver disease. (Level C, Class I).
7. The following moderate risk groups should be discussed early
with a cardiologist: (i) patients with chest pain of possible
cardiac origin; and (ii) patients receiving treatment for
established coronary disease or previous coronary revascularisation. (Level C, Class I).
8. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a single stress test
for NASH patients undergoing LTassessment. The choice of test
will be in part determined by local expertise. (Level C, Class I).
9. Patients without refractory ascites should be considered for
a cardioselective b blocker such as bisoprolol prior to LT. This
should be titrated gradually and not started in the immediate
perioperative period. Patients already receiving propanolol or
carvedilol for prophylaxis against variceal bleeding should
continue on those non-selective agents. (Level B, Class IIa).
10. Pravastatin should be considered in patients not already
receiving a statin or continued in those patients already
receiving it. Ideally, pravastatin should be started at least
1 week before surgery. Specifically, simvastatin and atorvastatin should be avoided in patients undergoing LT due to
interactions with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). (Level B,
Class I).
Assessment and management of nutritional status during
transplant work-up
11. There are no data to support an absolute cut-off for body
mass index (BMI) and LT although patients with a BMI
>40 kg/m2 are likely to have an increased postoperative and
long term mortality. BMI should be corrected for the presence
of ascites and peripheral oedema. (Level C, Class IIa).
12. Weight loss should not be recommended in patients with
decompensated end stage liver disease due to the risk of
protein calorie malnutrition. (Level C, Class III).
13. For patients with compensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma, it may be appropriate to try and achieve weight
loss before proceeding/while waiting for a transplant. (Level
C, Class II).
14. All potential NASH transplant recipients, including those
with an elevated BMI, should be assessed by a dietician and
supplemental feeding considered if protein calorie malnutrition is present. (Level C, Class I).
15. Dietary assessment of patients being assessed for LT should
include use of handgrip strength, anthropometry and/or
subjective global assessment to objectively define the
patient’s nutritional status and allow supplementation if
required. (Level B, Class I).
16. Dietary assessment of patients should be repeated on an
annual basis while they remain on the waiting list for LT.
(Level B, Class I).
Surgical aspects of liver transplantation for patients with NASH
17. Consider bariatric surgery at the time of LT in recipients
with severe morbid obesity, those with failed treatment of
obesity or in patients with recurrent NASH undergoing
retransplantation. (Level C, Class IIa)
18. Consider bariatric surgery in recipients with severe morbid
obesity, those with failed treatment of obesity or in patients
developing progressive NASH with fibrosis in the allograft.
(Level C, Class IIa).
Perioperative monitoring
19. While there is likely to be an increased operative risk, the lack
of evidence from controlled clinical trials indicates that no

recommendation can be made about the use of intraoperative cardiac output monitoring. (Level B, Class II).
20. Moderately tight glucose control (6e10 mmol/l) should be
targeted during the early post-transplant course in patients
of all aetiologies. (Level A, Class II).
21. If started preoperatively, statin therapy should be continued
during the postoperative phase. (Level B, Class I).
Immunosuppression
22. Alongside immunosuppression with CNI and antimetabolite, consideration should be given to either a steroid free
regimen or early steroid withdrawal (within 3 months) in
patients with NASH. Where steroid free regimens are used,
induction therapy (such as antithymocyte globulin or
interleukin 2 receptor antagonism) should be considered.
(Level B, Class IIa).
23. Tacrolimus levels should be 5e8 ng/ml to reduce the impact
on renal function and dyslipidaemia. Mycophenolate should
be used as the preferred antimetabolite to permit lower levels
of tacrolimus. (Level B, Class IIa).
24. Close follow-up and early recognition and treatment of the
recognised consequences of transplantation and immunosuppression (such as weight gain, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,
diabetes and renal impairment) remain the key to preventing
excess risk from recurrent NASH. (Level C, Class I).
Post-transplant monitoring of NASH patients and disease
recurrence
25. Histological examination of the explanted liver should be
carried out to confirm the presence of features compatible
with end stage NASH and to exclude features suggesting an
alternative diagnosis. (Level C, Class I).
26. The main role of biopsy is to the allow diagnosis and staging
of liver histopathology. Where NASH is the only or
dominant pathology, liver allograft biopsies can be scored
using the Kleiner classification. Biopsies performed elsewhere
should be reviewed at the transplant centre to ensure
reproducibility. (Level C, Class I).
27. Post-transplant monitoring of patients should include an
initial ultrasound (US) at 1 year, followed by every 2 years,
looking for the presence of a fatty liver. (Level C, Class IIa).
28. Post-transplant monitoring of patients with a fatty liver on
US should include protocol liver biopsies to detect disease
recurrence, as liver function tests may be normal. Repeat
biopsy should be considered every 3 years, unless there is
a clinical indication for more frequent biopsies. (Level C,
Class IIa).
Post-transplant management of NASH
29. Post-transplant patients should receive support, advice and
treatment in order achieve a target BMI of <25 kg/m2
. This
should be in the context of a multidisciplinary team,
incorporating dietary modification, exercise intervention
and the potential use of pharmacotherapy and surgical
intervention where appropriate. (Level C, Class I).
30. Post-transplant patients should be screened for the presence of
diabetes and, if present, reviewed regularly for the development of complications. Glycaemic control should be optimised in accordance with the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance. (Level A, Class I).
31. Patients transplanted for NASH should be monitored on a 6
monthly basis for risk factors for cardiovascular disease
(blood pressure (BP), lipids, haemoglobin A1c), which should
be addressed with the intention of reducing cardiovascular
events. (Level C, Class I).
32. A BP target of 140/90 mm Hg (130/80 mm Hg in patients
with diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or renal dysfunction)
should be aimed for (Level A, Class I).
33. Antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers or
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered in view of their possible additional effects of abrogating
liver fibrosis. (Level C, Class II).
34. A target low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of
<2.6 mmol/l is advised as the 10 year cardiovascular event
rate exceeds 20% for the liver transplant population.
Pravastatin and ezetimibe are preferred agents in view of
their demonstrated efficacy and absence of interactions
with CNIs. (Level C, Class IIa).
Transplantation for NASHdthe patients’ perspective
35. There is a need to increase understanding of liver disease and
its many causes, to improve patient outcomes and to reduce
the stigma many patients experience. (Not graded).
36. The potential cardiovascular morbidity associated with
NASH should be discussed with patients and guidance
given on diet and exercise, and sources of support (including
psychological support) as part of ongoing management.
(Not graded).
37. Provision of independent pre- and post-transplant emotional
and psychological counselling and support is very important,
along with an opportunity to provide confidential feedback
to the transplant team post-operatively. (Not graded).
PREVALENCE OF NASH CIRRHOSIS IN THE UK
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis
(NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is closely associated with obesity
and represents the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic
syndrome. The prevalence of NAFLD has risen rapidly in parallel
with the dramatic rise in levels of obesity and DM,2 resulting in
it now being the commonest cause of liver disease in the West.3
NAFLD prevalence
The prevalence of NAFLD is between 20% and 30% in Western
adults,4 5 rising to 90% in extreme obesity.6 NAFLD affects 3%
of the general paediatric population, rising to 53% in obese
children,7 8 with implications for future disease burden. NASH,
the more advanced and clinically important form of NAFLD, has
an estimated prevalence of 2e3% in the general population9 and
37% in the morbidly obese.6 Steatosis was present in 70% of
a large cohort of patients with type 2 DM.10 The Foresight
report predicted that with the alarming growth of obesity, the
burden of NAFLD on primary care and liver services will double
from a current annual cost of £4.2 billion by 2050.11
Association with increased mortality and progression to liver
cirrhosis
Patients with a diagnosis of NAFLD have been shown to have
a significantly higher overall12e16 and liver related13 14 mortality
compared with an age and sex matched general population. In
patients with NASH, the limited data available point to approximately one-third of patients developing progressive fibrosis over
a 5 year period, with up to 9% developing cirrhosis.17 18 The risk
factors for progressive NASH related liver disease are obesity, type
2 DM, insulin resistance and older age. Current evidence suggests
that the natural history of NASH cirrhosis is similar to that of
hepatitis C cirrhosis with respect to decompensation.19 20 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a recognised complication of cirrhosis

of a number of aetiologies, is also known to occur in NASH
related cirrhosis, and also rarely in precirrhotic NASH.21 A
prospective study on NASH cirrhotics has found a cumulative
annual incidence of 2.6% for the development of HCC in this
patient group compared with 4.0% for patients with hepatitis C
virus (HCV) cirrhosis.22 Obesity and DM have been found to be
risk factors for the development of HCC in cirrhosis of a variety of
aetiologies.23 24 The mortality of patients with NAFLD ranges
from 12.6% over 7.6 years of follow-up in mixed cohorts to
between 20.2% and 59.5% in secondary care cohorts
(13.7e21 years of follow-up). In the most recent study with
21 years of follow-up, this corresponded to an excess mortality of
70% (standardised mortality ratio 1.7; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.25).15
Need for liver transplantation
The increase in the number of patients with advanced liver
disease secondary to NASH, as well as associated HCC, will
impact on the potential future demand for LT. Analysis of
National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) data
shows that in both 2008 and 2009, 12% of patients placed on the
elective LT waiting list were categorised as having NASH
cirrhosis, with 14.8% of these individuals with NASH listed
with HCC. Consistent with the known association with insulin
resistance, 49.1% of patients with NASH cirrhosis listed for LT
were diabetic compared with 22.1% of all other registered
patients (although the criteria for the definition of DM were not
well defined).
INDICATIONS FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN NASH
RELATED CIRRHOSIS
Given that LT is a relatively recently identified indication for
patients with NASH, data for long term follow-up are more
limited compared with LT for other causes of chronic liver
disease. Nevertheless, data from several American centres
suggest that patients with NASH do not have an inferior
outcome 1, 2 and 5 years after LT when compared with other
aetiologies of liver disease.25e27
There are no data to suggest that the natural history of
cirrhosis after an initial clinical decompensation or the rate of
change of Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score differ
for patients with NASH compared with other causes of
cirrhosis. Hence the current recommendation should be that
there are no disease specific indications for listing for LT in
this condition and that those currently useddthat is, MELD
score and/or specific variant indications (eg, diuretic resistant/
intolerant ascites)dshould remain. In those patients with HCC
on the background of NASH related cirrhosis, there are no data
to support modification of the general criteria for listing for LT.
Many patients with end stage liver disease have a presumptive
diagnosis of NASH. Patients may have a longstanding history or
DM/hypertension with no other obvious reason for cirrhosis
other than presumed previous NASH. Generally, when such
patients present with liver decompensation they do not undergo
liver biopsy, hence the need for standardisation of diagnosing
NASH. As such, in the absence of a histological diagnosis of
NASH, the presence of cirrhosis with a clinical phenotype
compatible with underlying NASH, as defined by the presence of
three or more components of the metabolic syndrome28 prior to
LT, is sufficient.
Recommendation 1: Criteria for diagnosis of NASH should
include an established clinical and histological diagnosis of
NASH on liver biopsy, or a histological diagnosis of cryptogenic
cirrhosis with a clinical phenotype compatible with underlying
NASH, as defined by the presence of three or more components
of the metabolic syndrome prior to LT. (Level C, Class I).
Recommendation 2: Criteria for consideration of listing for
LT in patients with NASH cirrhosis either due to end stage liver
disease or the presence of HCC should be in line with standard
national criteria. (Level C, Class I).
In an era of significant organ shortage, with current mortality
on the elective LTwaiting list being around 18% in the UK, there
is a duty to allocate organs responsibly. The national guidelines
for adult LT are that patients should only be listed for LT if they
have a predicted 5 year survival after transplantation of $50%
(NHSBT Adult Liver Transplantation Guidelines 2009, accessed
19 February 2011 at http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/
about _transplants/organ_allocation/liver/national_protocols_
and_guidelines/adults.jsp). Standard exclusion criteria will apply
to NASH patients being considered for LT although their strong
association with the metabolic syndrome will likely involve
a more stringent assessment of cardiovascular risk.
There is not a large literature on the cost effectiveness of LT.
Longworth et al compared the disease groups of alcohol, primary
sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis.29 They
reported that the estimated gain in quality adjusted life years
from transplantation was positive for each of the disease groups,
and the mean incremental cost per quality adjusted life year
(95% bootstrap confidence intervals) from time of listing to
27 months for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic
liver disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis are £29 000
(£1000 to £59 000), £48 000 (£12 000 to £83 000) and £21 000
(£23 000 to £60 000), respectively. The higher cost in the
alcoholic liver disease group was because a greater number of
such patients were assessed for LT but not listed. There are no
data looking at the cohort of NASH patients, although it is
likely that the costs will be close to those seen in patients with
alcoholic liver disease given concerns about cardiovascular risk.
Their post-transplant outcomes are similar to those of other
aetiologies so it is likely their cost effectiveness will be similar to
that seen for indications such as alcoholic liver disease.
Research/audit recommendations
1. It would be helpful to calculate the cost effectiveness of LT
for patients with NASH, with particular attention to the
numbers needed to assess for each patient placed on the
transplant list.
2. Data on use of marginal donors in this group should be
recorded and compared with patients transplanted for other
aetiologies.
ASSESSMENT OF OPERATIVE RISK IN NASH PATIENTS
UNDERGOING LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
Having identified that a patient may benefit from LT, the next
stage in the process involves an assessment of the risk to the
patient of proceeding with the operation. The risks can be
divided into short (up to 90 days) and long term (1 year
onwards) to cover the immediate risks of the operation itself and
then the longer term survival. In both of these categories there is
concern that patients with NASH cirrhosis are at higher risk.
Risk of cardiovascular events
Cardiovascular risk factors are commonly found in patients
undergoing LT, with hyperinsulinaemia, type II DM, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and abdominal obesity disproportionately
present in NASH patients.10 30 Myocardial disease and
dysfunction are common in cirrhotic patients. Indices of
myocardial contractility such as left ventricular stroke work are

increased at rest.31 A sustained increase in baseline cardiac
output leads to cardiac hypertrophy and increases in left
ventricular diastolic and left atrial pressures.31 Cirrhotic patients
may have a normal resting ejection fraction but their reserve and
ability to increase heart rate and cardiac output in response to
stress are reduced, predisposing to decompensation during the
anhepatic phase and following reperfusion.32 33
The above is of particular relevance to a significant proportion
of patients with NASH related cirrhosis as they suffer from end
organ damage from lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. The
presence of pretransplant insulin treated DM has an adverse
impact on long term post-transplant survival,34 and many
individuals with NASH related cirrhosis have diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications. Indeed, atherosclerosis has been found to be present in a higher proportion of
patients with cirrhosis due to NASH compared with cirrhosis of
other aetiologies.35 Other diabetic complications such as proliferative retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcer disease have also been
shown to predict an increased morbidity/mortality in diabetic
cohorts outside the context of organ transplantation.36e38 A
further area of perceived increased risk relevant to the NASH
cirrhotic population is that of the effect of obesity on LT
outcome, which will be covered in the following section.
While there are data which suggest that NASH is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease,39 further large
scale prospective studies are needed to draw firm conclusions
about the independent hepatic contribution to the increased
cardiovascular risk seen in patients with NASH.30 Notably,
NASH has been reported to independently predict chronic
kidney disease, which may explain part of the contribution to
cardiovascular risk.40
Recommendation 3: Although the diagnosis of NASH
cirrhosis should not be regarded, in itself, to be a risk factor for
poor outcome in the perioperative period of LT, cardiovascular
risk should be closely considered in patients with NASH as they
have more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and are likely to
require further non-invasive testing. (Level C, Class I).
Cardiovascular event rate after liver transplantation
Cardiovascular complications are a common cause of early
morbidity and mortality after LT.41 42 Analysis of over 21 000
patients undergoing LT in the European Liver Transplant
Registry reported a 3 month mortality of 12%,43 with 8% of
deaths secondary to cardiac and a further 7% secondary to
cerebrovascular causes. In a study of 413 patients of varying
causes of end stage liver disease undergoing LT between 2001
and 2005, the 30 day all cause mortality was 9%, with 7%
developing a myocardial infarction (as defined by postoperative
troponin elevation) within that time period. A history of
previous stroke or coronary disease was associated with a 6.5-
fold and 4-fold increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction
and death, respectively.44
Preoperative cardiac risk assessment relies on the presence of
clinical risk markers, the patient’s functional capacity and the
extent or risk of the surgical procedure. LT is considered intermediate risk surgery compared with higher risk surgical procedures, such as aortic surgery, in European and American
guidelines for preoperative cardiac risk assessment.45 46
However, the 1e5% 30 day risk of myocardial infarction and
cardiac death quoted for intermediate risk surgery in these
guidelines45 is less than the rate of cardiovascular complications
observed in many LT series47e49 suggesting that LT surgery
should more probably be considered as moderate to high risk.
Research/audit recommendations
1. It is important to collect data on cardiovascular events for
patients with NASH undergoing LT to establish if their event
rate differs from cohorts transplanted for other indications.
2. To allow for appropriate comparisons, it is important to
define what constitutes a cardiovascular event in terms of
type of event and time since the operation.
Preoperative selection and assessment
Phase I: looking for factors to risk stratify
An accurate and reliable means of predicting short and long term
post-LT progression in an individual is clearly desirable but not
currently available. Several factors which confer increased risk
have been identified (table 1) but data on their risk when added
together are less clear.45 The history should seek to determine
the patient’s functional capacity, as assessment of the capacity
to perform a range of common daily tasks has been shown to
correlate well with maximum oxygen uptake on treadmill
testing.50 MET is an expression of energy expenditure during
physical activity as a multiple of resting metabolic rate. One
MET is considered as the resting metabolic rate, two METs
would represent walking at a slow pace (eg, 3 km/h) and four
METs would represent walking up two sets of stairs.
Preoperative cardiorespiratory assessment in patients with
NASH does not differ to that routinely performed in other
potential LT recipients. Standard tests include chest radiography,
arterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests, 12 lead ECG and
echocardiogram (with the following variables recorded: pulmonary artery systolic pressure, right ventricular function, left
ventricular function, tricuspid regurgitation velocity and isovolumic relaxation time).
A retrospective analysis of patients transplanted with NASH
cirrhosis found that the combination of age $60 years, BMI
$30 kg/m2
, DM and hypertension predicted a 50% mortality
within 1 year of transplantation.26 This needs to be confirmed in
larger cohorts but is consistent with another analysis of
predictors of increased long term mortality post-LT.51 An
attempt to incorporate comorbidity factors in a summative
fashion to predict long term outcome after LT using a modified
comorbidity index (Charlson Index) also found that the
pretransplant presence of more than one defined risk factor for
patients undergoing elective first transplantation resulted in
a 5 year post-LT survival of <50%.52
Stratification of patients to various risk categories on the basis
of risk markers varies across guidelines but one unifying principle is the assessment of a patient’s functional state, as judged
by METs. Both European45 and American53 guidelines of
cardiovascular evaluation and care for patients undergoing
non-cardiac surgery suggest that those with good functional

capacity (four or more METs) without symptoms do not require
non-invasive testing prior to LT. This is in contrast with the
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
guidelines which recommend that potential LT recipients should
undergo further cardiac investigation with dobutamine stress
echocardiography and confirmatory angiography if they have
any of the following factors: age >50 years, a history of chronic
smoking, a past medical or family history of heart disease, or
DM.54
In the event that a patient’s functional capacity is reduced to
below four METs, the presence of between one53 and three45
intermediate risk factors are required to stratify a patient as
moderate risk and therefore indicate the need for non-invasive
testing.
Acute heart failure, symptomatic valvular disease and
pulmonary hypertension will generally preclude patients being
listed for LT. Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean
pulmonary artery pressure of >25 mm Hg at rest at cardiac
catheterisation.55 It also requires a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of #15 mm Hg and a pulmonary vascular resistance of
$240 dyn/s/cm5
. Portopulmonary hypertension is a separate
indication for transplantation and will not be covered within
these guidelines. Some of these conditions may respond to
treatment, and options are expanding with improved management of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, with some
centres reporting successful combined cardiac and LT surgery.
Recommendation 4: All NASH patients should undergo
preoperative risk stratification to exclude symptomatic coronary
artery disease and assessment for the presence of structural heart
disease, left ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. (Level C, Class I).
Recommendation 5: Patients unable to achieve four METs,
or those with at least one intermediate risk factor should be
considered for further cardiac testing. (Level C, Class I)
An algorithm to aid in the investigation of cardiovascular risk
patients with NASH cirrhosis being considered for LT is detailed
in figure 1.
Phase II: role of cardiac testing
Assessment of functional capacity can be difficult in patients
with end stage liver disease due to NASH because of the high
incidence of reduced mobility, physical deconditioning and
obesity. While risk stratification will determine the next level of
cardiovascular investigation, early discussion with a cardiologist
experienced in assessing cardiovascular risk in patients with end
stage liver disease should be considered for more complex cases.
Recommendation 6: Within a transplant centre, cardiology
input should be provided by cardiologists with an interest/
experience in the assessment of patients with liver disease.
(Level C, Class I)
Recommendation 7: The following moderate risk groups
should be discussed early with a cardiologist: (i) patients with
chest pain of possible cardiac origin; and (ii) patients receiving
treatment for established coronary disease or previous coronary
revascularisation. (Level C, Class I)
The role of the cardiologist includes, but is not limited to, the
following: (i) coronary angiography (invasive or by CT); (ii)
functional testing with myocardial perfusion imaging; (iii)
optimisation of pharmacotherapy; (iv) coronary revascularisation; and (v) advice on perioperative cardiac management in
patients accepted for LT.
Cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing predicts survival in
LT candidates and following LT in general. CPX involves exercising on an upright bicycle, with assessment of the performance of both heart and lungs. In essence, it measures the point
when exercise becomes anaerobic, and if this measurement is
reduced, then operative risk is deemed to be high. In two
studies, a threshold level of <60% peak oxygen consumption
during CPX independently predicted survival and length of
hospital stay.56 57
Cardiac stress testing is directed towards establishing the
presence of obstructive coronary disease but it appears to have
a more limited predictive value for perioperative cardiac
decompensation in this patient population compared with other
high risk surgical groups. Dobutamine stress echocardiography
(DSE), although moderately specific for coronary artery disease,
lacks sensitivity in patients undergoing LT.58 59 Pre-existing high
cardiac output in cirrhotics limits the value of DSE, and hence
direct inotropic stimulation with the b agonist dobutamine is
preferential to the use of vasodilators such as adenosine or
dypridamole. The vasodilated state of the patients with portal
hypertension may attenuate the ability of vasodilators to
increase coronary arterial blood flow but the theoretical advantage of dobutamine is often limited due to the concurrent
administration of b blockers and an inherent chronotropic
incompetence found in some patients with chronic liver
disease.48 Guidelines on preoperative cardiac risk assessment
indicate that patients with multiple cardiac risk markers or poor
functional status undergoing high risk surgery are recommended
for stress testing by perfusion imaging or DSE.45 46 Negative stress
testing is reassuring, providing an excellent negative predictive
value in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.60 61 The
positive predictive value for perioperative myocardial infarction or
death in this high risk surgery group is between 20% and 30%
following a positive stress test.61 Perfusion imaging and DSE
detect the presence of fixed obstructive coronary stenoses
responsible for myocardial ischaemia during increased myocardial
workload. The presence of obstructive coronary disease increases
the risk of perioperative myocardial infarction but other factors
Figure 1 Assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) prior to liver transplantation. The
number and severity of risk factors, as described in table 1, determines
the risk category of a patient with NASH. This is also influenced by the
metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) that a patient can undertake. One
MET is considered as the resting metabolic rate, two METs would
represent walking at a slow pace (eg, 3 km/h) and four METs would
represent walking up two sets of stairs. For those patients deemed to be
at moderate risk, further investigation is required, preferably with some
form of stress testing. OLT, orthotopic liver transplantation.

contribute, including changes in coagulation and platelet activation during the perioperative period.62
According to Bayesian principles, the positive predictive value
of a screening test depends on the prevalence of disease in the
population tested. Patients with established vascular disease are
more likely to have (asymptomatic) coronary disease than
patients with liver cirrhosis. This may partly explain the
comparably weak positive predictive value of DSE in LT
patients. Studies have also reported poor discrimination for
identifying patients at risk of perioperative troponin elevation
and cardiac decompensation.59 63 Many transplant centres use
DSE as a preoperative screening test and the most recent AASLD
guideline recommends DSE in smokers, patients with coronary
disease or type II DM.54 A positive test mandates coronary
angiography according to this guideline but patients with nonobstructed coronary arteries may still experience cardiac
decompensation during LT.64 The predictive value of other noninvasive methods such as 99Technetium labelled single photon
emission computer tomographic studies is likewise poor.65
Calcification of coronary arteries on CT scanning is correlated
with cardiovascular risk factors and the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Coronary calcification is seen in patients
with the metabolic syndrome who are assessed for LT.66 Coronary calcium scoring may be used to further define the 10 year
risk of cardiovascular events in asymptomatic populations.67 It
does not provide information on the presence of obstructive
coronary disease or inducible myocardial ischaemia and there is
no evidence to support its use in perioperative risk assessment.
The above tests may aid in triaging patients in regards to
diagnostic coronary investigations. Apart from standard invasive
coronary angiography, CT coronary angiography is used with
increasing frequency in the assessment of patients with possible
cardiac chest pain. Despite the advantage of minimal invasiveness, it is limited in its ability to discriminate obstructive
coronary lesions by the presence of coronary calcification and
coronary stents. CT coronary angiography has been used to rule
out coronary disease in patients undergoing heart valve surgery
and non-cardiac surgery. Recent guidelines have suggested an
application to further evaluate patients considered at intermediate risk of coronary disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery but
it is currently not a recommended technique for perioperative
risk assessment in non-cardiac surgery.45 68 Further research is
required and no recommendation was given for this imaging
modality in the most recent joint European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Anaesthesiology guideline on
preoperative cardiac risk assessment.45
Recommendation 8: There is insufficient evidence to
recommend a single stress test for NASH patients undergoing LT
assessment. The choice of test will be in part determined by
local expertise. (Level C, Class I).
Pharmacological risk reduction with b blockers and statins has
been extensively studied. Randomised trials selecting high risk
patients, cohort studies and meta-analyses provide evidence
supporting a decrease in cardiac mortality and myocardial
infarction using cardioselective b blockers in patients with
clinical risk factors undergoing high and intermediate risk
surgery.69 Treatment should be titrated and initiated ideally
between 30 days and at least 1 week before surgery, with
suggested targets of heart rate 60e70 beats/min and systolic
blood pressure >100 mm Hg.45 Higher dose b blockade started
in the perioperative period was associated with increased
mortality, reinforcing the need for gradual titrated introduction
of therapy.70 Recent data have suggested that use of b blockers
in patients with refractory ascites is associated with poor
survival and result in higher rates of paracentesis induced
circulatory dysfunction,71 72 suggesting that b blockers should
be contraindicated in these patients.
Recommendation 9: Patients without refractory ascites
should be considered for a cardioselective b blocker such as
bisoprolol prior to LT. This should be titrated gradually and not
started in the immediate perioperative period. Patients already
receiving propanolol or carvedilol for prophylaxis against variceal
bleeding should continue on those non-selective agents. (Level B,
Class IIa).
Similarly, starting statins has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality by 44% in meta-analyses in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.69 73 Stopping of statins may also
result in a rebound effect and lead to increased cardiovascular
complications.74 Pravastatin is the statin of choice as it is
transformed enzymatically in the liver cytosol whereas all other
statins undergo extensive microsomal metabolism by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme systems and thus have greater
interactions with CNIs.75 Specifically, simvastatin and atorvastatin should be avoided in patients undergoing LT due to the
interactions with CNIs resulting in rhabdomyolysis.
Recommendation 10: Pravastatin should be considered in
patients not already receiving a statin or continued in those
patients already receiving it. Ideally, pravastatin should be
started at least 1 week before surgery. Specifically, simvastatin
and atorvastatin should be avoided in patients undergoing LT
due to interactions with CNIs. (Level B, Class I).
ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF NUTRITIONAL STATUS
DURING TRANSPLANT WORKUP
Perioperative morbidity and mortality is increased following
major surgical procedures among the obese because of concomitant cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidaemia and pulmonary dysfunction.76 The AASLD practice guideline, among
others, suggests that morbid obesity should be considered
a contraindication to LT.54 77
Influence of obesity on postoperative liver transplant outcome
A consistent drawback with the majority of studies examining
the influence of obesity on transplant outcome has been that the
amount of ascites/peripheral oedema has not been taken into
account when calculating BMI. Table 2 details how weight can
be adjusted for ascites and peripheral oedema. This is important
given that ascites is a marker of disease severity. Of the 12
published studies, only Leonard’s study79 measured ascites
volume at transplantation and identified those with obesity as
opposed to those with marked ascites.77 79e89 A second drawback is that the conclusions are drawn only from those patients
with obesity who have undergone transplantation, so extrapolation from these to all potential candidates may be misleading.
Analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing database
demonstrated that primary graft non-function and immediate, 1
year and 2 year mortality were significantly higher in the
morbidly obese group (p<0.05). In addition, 5 year mortality
was significantly higher in both severely and morbidly obese
subjects (p<0.05), mostly as a result of adverse cardiovascular

events.77 KaplaneMeier survival was significantly lower in
morbidly obese patients, and morbid obesity was an independent predictor of mortality. Further analysis of the United
Network for Organ Sharing database in 2009 drew broadly
similar conclusions, although it suggested that obese patients
(BMI >40 mg/kg2
) tended to be transplanted with more
advanced MELD scores and hence these patients might be best
served by receiving a graft at an earlier stage than non-morbidly
obese counterparts.89 This is borne out by a large study of 29 000
patients waitlisted for LTs which found that obese recipients
waited longer and were more likely to be passed over.90 Looking
at UK LToutcome data for patients with hepatitis C, a high BMI
was an independent predictor of a worse outcome at 90 days,
but not long term.91
The importance of correcting for ascites volume was
demonstrated by Leonard et al, correction resulting in 11e20%
of patients moving into a lower BMI classification.79 The relative risk for mortality increased by 7% for each litre of ascites
removed, with the conclusion that corrected BMI is not an
independent predictor of patient or graft survival. This would
suggest that obesity should not be considered to be an absolute
contraindication to LT in the absence of other relative contraindications. The decision to list a patient will include an
assessment of all potential relative contraindications, such as
a BMI of >40.
Recommendation 11: There are no data to support an
absolute cut-off for BMI and LT although patients with a BMI
>40 mg/kg2 are likely to have an increased postoperative and
long term mortality. BMI should be corrected for the presence of
ascites and peripheral oedema (Level C, Class IIa).
Weight loss in liver transplant recipients
There are no data on the following: (i) impact of weight loss
pretransplant, (ii) data on intervention studies post-LT or (iii)
strategies for maintaining weight loss in transplant recipients.
Behaviour changes required for liver transplantation
For tobacco, alcohol or illicit substances, a requirement for
complete abstinence is widely accepted and enforceable, and
adherence can be checked. Food, however, is a basic requirement
which cannot be proscribed, and food restriction in patients
with end stage liver disease is potentially harmful. Despite the
appearance of obesity, some patients with advanced liver disease
will have protein calorie malnutrition, and therefore should be
fully assessed by a dietician for evidence of protein malnutrition.
Dietary restriction risks worsening protein calorie malnutrition,
and should only be contemplated under careful supervision by
a dietician. Protein calorie malnutrition is associated with
reduced graft and patient survival.92 A weight orientated
contract after LT is superficially attractive, to mimic the existing
no alcohol contract, but the practicalities would need careful
consideration.
Recommendation 12: Weight loss should not be recommended in patients with decompensated end stage liver disease
due to the risk of protein calorie malnutrition. (Level C, Class
III).
Recommendation 13: For patients with compensated
cirrhosis and HCC, it may be appropriate to try and achieve
weight loss before proceeding/while waiting for a transplant.
(Level C, Class II).
Assessment of patient nutritional status
Nutrition management in patients with advanced liver disease
and obesity is problematic. Accurate estimation of nutritional
status is difficult in patients with advanced liver disease,
regardless of whether or not they are obese, in part due to poor
interobserver reproducibility and overestimation of values
because of third spacing of fluid. Protein calorie malnutrition is
a condition of body wasting related to dietary deficiency of
calories and protein, is found in 65e90% of patients with end
stage liver disease93 and is associated with reduced graft and
patient survival.92 94 The detection and management of protein
calorie malnutrition is therefore an integral part of the dietary
assessment.
Skinfold measurement and handgrip strength are simple tests
of nutritional status, with the latter proving to be a good
predictor of complications in patients with advanced liver
disease.95 Other methods include the subjective global assessment, which combines multiple elements of nutritional assessment to classify the severity of malnutrition.96
In 1997, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and
Metabolism developed guidelines for meeting nutritional goals in
patients with end stage liver disease.97 This included a diet
consisting of 35% fat (15e20% monosaturates, minimal trans
fats, reduced saturated fats, <10% total fat), 50% carbohydrate
(minimal refined carbohydrate) and 15% protein. For obese
patients with end stage liver disease, the transplant team should
be aware that dietary restriction risks enhancing protein calorie
malnutrition, and should only be contemplated under careful
supervision by a dietician. If safe, calorie restriction should be
limited to target no more than 0.5e1 kg (1e2 lb) weight loss per
week and to avoid weight loss exceeding 1.5 kg per week. In some
circumstances malnutrition may be present despite apparent
obesity, in which case supplementation with night time tube
feeding may be of value.98 Patients with well preserved liver
function and small HCCs may benefit from weight loss but only
if the delay does not adversely affect their cancer.
Recommendation 14: All potential NASH transplant recipients, including those with an elevated BMI, should be assessed
by a dietician and supplemental feeding considered if protein
calorie malnutrition is present. (Level C, Class I).
Recommendation 15: Dietary assessment of patients being
assessed for LT should include use of handgrip strength,
anthropometry and/or subjective global assessment to objectively define the patient’s nutritional status, and start supplementation if required. (Level B, Class I).
Recommendation 16: Dietary assessment of patients should
be repeated on an annual basis while they remain on the waiting
list for LT. (Level B, Class I).
SURGICAL ASPECTS OF LIVER TRANSPLANTATION FOR
PATIENTS WITH NASH
Perioperative issues in NASH patients undergoing liver
transplantation
Patients undergoing LT for NASH pose additional challenges for
surgical teams. As the potential donor pool continues to evolve,
the use of extended criteria donors in NASH recipients needs to
be assessed, especially donor grafts with moderately severe
steatosis. Such patients are also less likely to be suitable recipients for split liver and living related transplantation as the
segmental liver graft is more likely to be relatively small for size
for the obese NASH recipient. Consequently, patients with
NASH may have restricted access to the already severely limited
donor organ pool, reducing their chances of undergoing LT.
Few data exist on the use of steatotic donor livers and their
impact on the development of post-transplant recurrent NASH.
As disease recurrence after LT is common and the diagnosis
based on liver histology, the performance of a core liver biopsy

after reperfusion and prior to abdominal closure is of value to
provide baseline liver histology for comparison with late posttransplant biopsies. These biopsies may also assist the evaluation of patients with early graft dysfunction, which these grafts
may be more predisposed to.
Bariatric surgery at the time of transplantation
LT surgery provides an opportunity to perform additional bariatric surgical procedures to facilitate weight loss and also limit
the risk of recurrent disease. Such procedures do add an additional risk to what is already a high risk procedure. The presence
of portal hypertension or post-reperfusion coagulopathy would
be strong reasons to perform the least invasive additional bariatric surgical procedure. As a small proportion of LT patients
may require a future Roux-en-Y biliary enteric anastomosis, it is
preferable to limit bariatric procedures to non-bypass procedures. Similarly, the use of gastric bands in the setting of
advanced liver disease and subsequent post LT immunosuppression may increase the risk of sepsis related to the device.
Almost no evidence exists on the role of bariatric surgery at
the time of LT. It would therefore be logical to consider such an
approach only in highly selected situations, possibly in recipients with severe morbid obesity, those with failed treatment of
obesity or in patients with recurrent disease undergoing
retransplantation. The choice of procedure should be guided by
the status of the recipient at the end of the transplant procedure,
the essential requirements being the presence of satisfactory
early liver graft function, adequate haemostatic parameters,
control of all bleeding and the availability of local bariatric
surgical expertise. The use of less invasive options such as gastric
balloons is potentially attractive, as this will keep the additional
risks to a minimum. The intragastric balloon (IGB) is a safe,
endoscopically placed, saline filled, silicone balloon which can
remain in the stomach for up to 6 months.99 There are good
efficacy data in non-transplant patients, such that some bariatric
services use it as a firstline procedure and progress only to formal
bariatric surgery if the IGB fails. The weight loss achievable by
the IGB has been shown to be up to 32 kg after 6 months.
Portal hypertension is a contraindication to IGB placement
and may limit its utility in early post-transplant patients. The
rate of spontaneous deflation of the IGB is very low at <0.1%. In
the unlikely event that the IGB does deflate unexpectedly,
methylene blue dye admixed with the saline in the balloon will
discolour the stool and so provide prompt evidence of leakage of
the balloon contents.
Recommendation 17: Consider bariatric surgery at the time
of LT in recipients with severe morbid obesity, those with failed
treatment of obesity or in patients with recurrent NASH
undergoing retransplantation. (Level C, Class IIa).
Bariatric surgery after liver transplantation
The LT recipient who remains morbidly obese or develops
recurrent or de novo NASH may in the course of time be
considered a candidate for bariatric surgery. Little or no data exist
on the timing and selection of such patients for bariatric surgery.
The vast majority of these patients will be on modest stable
maintenance immunosuppression, and ideally would be off
corticosteroids or on low dose maintenance corticosteroids. Most
patients are on a combination of an antiproliferative agent
(azathioprine or mycophenolate) and a CNI (tacrolimus or
ciclosporin). Patients on mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi, sirolimus or everolimus) will need to stop these
drugs 4 weeks before an operation as they are associated with
impaired wound healing, and alternative regimens considered.
There are few data on which to base recommendations for
patient and procedure selection for patients undergoing bariatric
surgery post-LT. Extensive adhesions may make the laparoscopic
approach difficult or sometime impossible, with a higher risk of
open conversion and its additional risks. The use of intestinal
bypass surgery may have an impact on future biliary enteric
surgery and may also affect the absorption of immunosuppressive medication. In view of these issues, it is preferable to
consider the use of endoscopic placed gastric balloons as the
procedure of choice, followed by non-bypass gastric surgery as
the next option. Case reports support the feasibility and efficacy
of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for recurrent NASH in LT recipients
with morbid obesity.100
Recommendation 18: Consider bariatric surgery in recipients with severe morbid obesity, those with failed treatment of
obesity or in patients with developing progressive NASH with
fibrosis in allograft. (Level C, Class IIa).
PERIOPERATIVE MONITORING
The anhepatic and reperfusion phases during LT are associated
with a high risk of cardiovascular instability. The former occurs
due to a sudden reduction in venous return, and the latter
because of the effects of the return of cold, acidotic and hyperkalaemic preservation fluid into the circulation.101 Release of
vasoactive mediators and myocardial depression related to free
oxygen radical production are additional pathogenetic mechanisms. The clinical picture is characterised by sudden onset of
profound arterial hypotension due to the combined effects of
reduction in systemic vascular resistance, increase in pulmonary
vascular resistance and drop in heart rate and cardiac output.
Patients with NASH and associated cardiovascular risk factors
may be particularly vulnerable to these effects, and advanced
haemodynamic monitoring with pulmonary artery catheters
(PAC) is routinely performed in many transplant centres. Despite
the theoretical advantage of invasive perioperative monitoring and
therapeutic guidance based on PAC data, randomised controlled
trials in high risk surgery102 or in the critically ill103 have not
shown any evidence of benefit. Indeed, there are no controlled
data showing an advantage of PAC use, or indeed any other form
of advanced haemodynamic monitoring tool, during LT.
Trans-oesophageal echocardiography provides immediate and
direct assessment of cardiac structures and the functional status
of both ventricles. It is an excellent tool to diagnose new onset
regional wall motion abnormalities and enables assessment of
the filling status of the left ventricle as well as estimation of
pulmonary artery pressures. Compared with PAC it is relatively
non-invasive and low risk; however, it is operator dependent and
requires appropriate training. Whether intraoperative management based on trans-oesophageal echocardiography imaging
provides any outcome benefit is unknown. The lack of continuous monitoring capability outside the operating theatre in the
intensive care unit (ICU) is another potential drawback.
Recommendation 19: While there is likely to be an increased
operative risk, the lack of evidence from controlled clinical trials
indicates that no recommendation can be made about the use of
intraoperative cardiac output monitoring. (Level B, Class II)
Perioperative management of conditions frequently associated
with NASH
Insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and blood sugar control
A linear relationship exists between blood sugar levels and
adverse outcome in hospitalised patients, regardless of the
presence of DM. A large single centre randomised controlled
study published in 2001 showed a 42% relative mortality

reduction in surgical ICU patients when blood sugar levels were
normalised to 4.4e6.1 mmol/l.104 This was achieved by virtue of
continuous insulin infusion in combination with hypercaloric
parenteral nutrition. The control group only received therapy if
the glucose level exceeded 11.9 mmol/l. A minority of patients
had a history of DM (13%) and only 5% of patients were
admitted following transplantation, which makes extrapolation
of the findings to the post-LT setting difficult. Subsequent
multicentre studies and a meta-analysis failed to reproduce the
results of this trial, and concerns have been raised in regards to
the possible harmful effects of tight glucose control through an
increased incidence of life threatening hypoglycaemia.
The largest study to date from the Australian and New
Zealand Intensive Care Society collaborators (Normoglycaemia
in Intensive Care EvaluationeSurvival Using Glucose Algorithm
Regulation (NICEeSUGAR)), a multicentre randomised
controlled trial, randomised more than 6000 patients to tight
glucose control of 4.5e6 mmol/l versus 10 mmol/l or less.
Surprisingly, intensive insulin therapy increased mortality in
both medical and surgical patients, perhaps in association with
an increased incidence of severe hypoglycaemia.105 In comparison with the earlier trial, patients were primarily enterally fed
and they received significantly less calories and insulin; however,
the blood sugar level in the control group was comparable,
averaging 8 mmol/l. In the absence of evidence in relation to
perioperative blood sugar management in NASH and extrapolating from the available data pertaining to ICU patients,
moderate glucose control targeting levels between 6 and
10 mmol/l is recommended.
Recommendation 20: Moderately tight glucose control
(6e10 mmol/l) should be targeted during the early post-transplant course in patients of all aetiologies. (Level A, Class II).
NASH and statin use in the perioperative period
Dyslipidaemia is a common finding in patients with NASH and
statins are widely used for this indication. Recent studies have
extended the use of statins beyond traditional indications of
lipid lowering therapy. Cholesterol independent therapeutic,
pleiotropic effects of statins include anti-inflammatory and
antioxidative properties, improvement of endothelial function
and increased nitric oxide bioavailability. In addition to antiinflammatory properties, statins may interfere with the activation of the coagulation cascade and modulate platelet function.
Several retrospective trials and prospective studies in patients
undergoing vascular surgery have shown a beneficial effect of
statins, with reduction in the incidence of perioperative
myocardial infarction, coupled with an excellent safety profile.
Several experimental and observational trials postulate a beneficial role of statins in sepsis, especially in patients with suspected
bacterial infection.106
Patients already receiving statins should not have their treatment interrupted perioperatively or during the intensive care
stay to maintain the beneficial pleiotropic effects and reduce the
risk of cardiac events.107 As statins can interact with CNIs,
careful attention should be paid to the choice and dose of statin
used. Pravastatin is the statin of choice in view of it having the
least interactions with CNIs.75
Recommendation 21: If started preoperatively, statin
therapy should be continued during the postoperative phase.
(Level B, Class I).
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
Lifelong immunosuppression (IMS) is required in the great
majority of patients following LT, irrespective of primary indication. Overall, liver allograft recipients have an increased risk of
morbidity and mortality from cardiac and cerebrovascular
disease, weight gain and DM.108 Maintenance IMS regimens are
based on either monotherapy with a CNI (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) or an mTORi (sirolimus or everolimus), or combination
therapy with two or more of corticosteroids, CNI, mTORi and
an antimetabolite (usually azathioprine or mycophenolate). The
selection of the most appropriate regimen for the patient is
likely to vary during the course of the lifetime of the graft
and will depend on many factors, including the indication,
likelihood and consequences of allograft rejection, and comorbid
conditions.109
Although both recurrent and de novo NASH may develop in
the allograft, there have been no significant prospective trials
evaluating different IMS regimens in patients grafted for NASH.
The selection of the most appropriate IMS regimen for the liver
allograft recipient transplanted for NASH will depend on many
factors, including:
< The time after transplant. In many cases, immunosuppression load can be reduced; many centres withdraw steroids by
3 months.
< Risk of rejection. This will depend on many factors, including
the indication for transplantation, a history of early or late
rejection and the response to increased immunosuppression.
< Comorbid conditions. For example, CNI may be reduced or
avoided where there is renal impairment.
< Indication. mTORi may be preferred for those with liver cell
cancer.
< Complications. CNIs may be reduced or avoided when renal
impairment develops, and mycophenolate should be avoided
when neutropenia develops.
Impact of immunosuppressive agents on risk factors for NASH
The currently used agents all have differing impacts on components of the metabolic syndrome, as shown in table 3 .51 108e116
Ciclosporin and tacrolimus have slightly differing effects on
some of these risks: for example, new onset diabetes after
transplantation is more common with tacrolimus than ciclosporin110 while hyperlipidaemia is more common with ciclosporin.109 Due to superior patient outcome, tacrolimus is
preferred to ciclosporin and is the firstline CNI used in clinical
practice.117
Selection of an immunosuppressive regimen
The prime goal of any immunosuppression regimen must be
maintenance of normal graft function and prevention of graft
damage from immune and other factors, with an acceptable side
effect profile. However, the selection of specific combinations of
immunosuppressive agents may allow a reduction of the risk of
recurrence of NASH in the graft and the associated vascular and
metabolic side effects.
While there are no prospective studies evaluating different
immunosuppressive regimens in this context, the following may

be considered for those transplanted with or for the metabolic
syndrome and/or NASH:
< Corticosteroids. Where possible, use either a steroid free
regimen or early steroid withdrawal. Where steroid free
regimens are used, induction therapy (such as antithymocyte
globulin or interleukin 2 receptor antagonism) should be
considered.
< CNIs. Although tacrolimus may be more strongly associated
with DM than ciclosporin, it has a better effect on graft
outcome.
< mTORi. Should be avoided as firstline agents although they
may be indicated for those with liver cell cancer or as rescue
therapy.
Several studies support use of antimetabolites such as mycophenolate to allow lower doses of tacrolimus and reduce the
impact on DM and renal dysfunction.118e120 This is reinforced
by data demonstrating that NASH patients develop worse renal
dysfunction after transplant, even after DM and hypertension
are taken into account.121
Recommendation 22: Alongside immunosuppression with
CNI and an antimetabolite, consideration should be given to
either a steroid free regimen or early steroid withdrawal (within
3 months) in patients with NASH. Where steroid free regimens
are used, induction therapy (such as antithymocyte globulin or
interleukin 2 receptor antagonism) should be considered. (Level
B, Class IIa).
Recommendation 23: Tacrolimus levels should be 5e8 ng/
ml to reduce the impact on renal function and dyslipidaemia.
Mycophenolate should be used as the preferred antimetabolite,
to permit lower levels of tacrolimus. (Level B, Class IIa).
It is essential that modification of the immunosuppressive
regimen should be considered in combination with lifestyle and
pharmacological approaches to reducing the recurrence and
impact of metabolic syndrome. This includes regular monitoring
and treatment (where indicated) of DM, hypertension and
hyperlipidaemia.
Recommendation 24: Close follow-up and early recognition
and treatment of the recognised consequences of transplantation
and immunosuppression (such as weight gain, hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia, DM and renal impairment) remain the key to
preventing excess risk from recurrent NASH. (Level C, Class I).
POST-TRANSPLANT MONITORING OF NASH PATIENTS AND
DISEASE RECURRENCE
NASH recurrence in the liver allograft
Many studies have described histological features of recurrent
fatty liver disease in patients transplanted for NASH.25 27 122e128
Similar changes have also been observed in patients transplanted
for conditions other than NASH.124 125 129e134 Some of these
patients were initially diagnosed as having cryptogenic cirrhosis
at the time of listing but were subsequently found to have
pretransplant risk factors for fatty liver disease while others
presumably reflect transplant related risk factors that predispose
to the metabolic syndrome.
Recommendation 25: Histological examination of the
explanted liver should be carried out to confirm the presence of
features compatible with end stage NASH and to exclude
features suggesting an alternative diagnosis. (Class I, Level C).
Histological assessment of NASH recurrence
The histological features of NASH in the liver allograft are
essentially the same as those occurring in the native liver.
However, changes seen in post-transplant biopsies may be
modified by a number of other complications of LT. The challenge to the pathologist is to distinguish whether all features are
attributable to fatty liver disease or whether there is an additional post-transplant complication. Conditions that may
have overlapping histological features with certain components of NASH include rejection, biliary complications and
vascular/architectural changes, including nodular regenerative
hyperplasia.135e137
Late rejection may lack the typical portal tract features of
acute rejection and frequently includes centrilobular necroinflammatory changes (‘central perivenulitis’) that may be associated with hepatocyte ballooning and with the development of
centrilobular fibrosis. Biliary complications are characterised by
periportal ductular reaction and fibrosis, both of which have been
described as features of NASH in the native liver.138 Nodular
regenerative hyperplasia is an increasingly recognised finding in
late post-transplant biopsies and may be associated with the
development of perisinusoidal fibrosis in centrilobular regions.139
The latter sometimes occurs as an isolated finding without
conspicuous nodularity. There are also interactions between HCV
infection, insulin resistance and metabolic fatty liver disease,
which may be important in the pathogenesis and severity of
recurrent HCV infection and de novo NASH.132 140e143 For this
reason, biopsies performed elsewhere should be reviewed at the
transplant centre.
Semiquantitative scoring systems are increasingly used to
assess the severity of NASH in the native liver.144 The most
widely used systems are those described by Brunt145 and
Kleiner, 146 both of which grade the severity of steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation, and stage the
severity of fibrosis. Although several studies have assessed the
histological severity of NASH in the liver allograft, the clinical
utility of formal scoring systems in this context has not been
validated. Problems may arise if there are coexistent graft
complications that can mimic some of the NASH related
features that are used for histological grading or staging. Scoring
should therefore only be carried out if the changes seen can be
attributed to NASH alone.
Recommendation 26: The main role of biopsy is to allow
diagnosis and staging of liver histopathology. Where NASH is
the only or dominant pathology, liver allograft biopsies can be
scored using the Kleiner classification. Biopsies performed elsewhere should be reviewed at the transplant centre to ensure
reproducibility. (Class I, Level C).
Frequency and impact of NASH recurrence
Fatty change occurs in 60e100% of patients within a few
months of transplantation, and approximately 10e40% develop
features of steatohepatitis, albeit usually not severe. Approximately 10% of patients progress to bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis
by 10 years post-transplant.27 Likewise, features of fatty liver
disease are commonly seen in protocol biopsies from patients
transplanted for conditions other than NASH.134 147 148 Onethird of patients with histological evidence of recurrent NASH
have normal liver enzymes, which supports the role of protocol
liver biopsies in monitoring disease progression in the liver
allograft.127 While disease progression is rapid in occasional
cases, resulting in graft failure within 2e3 years of transplantation,123 in the majority of cases recurrent NASH does not
appear to have a major impact on graft survival in the first
5 years post-transplant.27 149 150 However, the long term clinical
importance of recurrent NASH is not yet known, and data from
the pretransplant setting indicate that NASH confers a worse
prognosis to that of simple steatosis over a 10e15 year period.

Distinction between NASH and steatosis in the allograft should
therefore result in a focus on changes in lifestyle advice and
medical therapy.
Recommendation 27: Post-transplant monitoring of patients
should include an initial US at 1 year, followed by every 2 years,
looking for the presence of a fatty liver. (Class IIa, Level C).
Recommendation 28: Post-transplant monitoring of
patients with a fatty liver on US should include protocol liver
biopsies to detect disease recurrence, as liver function tests may
be normal. Repeat biopsy should be considered every 3 years
unless there is a clinical indication for more frequent biopsies.
(Class IIa, Level C).
Factors predicting NASH recurrence
Cumulative steroid dose after LT has been shown to predict
recurrence of NASH in the allograft25 but further work is
required to identify whether other factors such as BMI, dyslipidaemia and diabetic status/control are also responsible. Use of
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been suggested to
reduce recurrence post-transplant.132
Research/audit recommendation
It will be important to compare non-invasive modalities for the
assessment of NASH and fibrosis with liver biopsy post-LT.
POST-TRANSPLANT MANAGEMENT OF NASH
Obesity and weight management
Patients transplanted for NASH are at an increased risk for the
subsequent development of features of the metabolic syndrome.
New onset obesity is reported in 17e43% of post-transplant
patients.128 151e153 In addition, hypertension is reported in 35%,
impaired glucose tolerance/DM in 16%, hypercholesterolaemia
in 18% and hypertriglyceridaemia in 19% of patients.128 Overt
post-transplant metabolic syndrome comprising a constellation
of cardiovascular risk factors may be present in up to 58% of
patients.109 154 155 Importantly, 26% of deaths in post-transplant
NASH patients are due to cardiovascular causes128 and those
patients with post-transplant metabolic syndrome have significantly more cardiovascular events than those without metabolic
syndrome (30% vs 8%).154
Morbidly obese patients (BMI >40 kg/m2) have a higher
incidence of primary graft non-function post-transplant but this
does not appear to impact on 1e2 year graft survival. However,
30 day, 1 year and 2 year mortality are significantly higher in
morbidly obese patients. Five year mortality is increased in both
severe (BMI >35 kg/m2
) and morbid obesity but this is not
a reflection of intraoperative mortality. Using a proportional
hazards model of survival, 2 year survival is independently
predicted by morbid obesity and type 2 DM.77
While it makes clinical sense to optimise weight management
and reduce cardiovascular risk, there are currently no published
studies that have examined the impact of weight reduction on
outcome in patients transplanted for NASH. In a single study,
>90 min of exercise per week was associated with improved
quality of life outcomes as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire
in post-LT patients although the precise indication for transplantation was not defined in this cohort.156
Recommendation 29: Post-transplant patients should
receive support, advice and treatment in order achieve a target
BMI of <25 kg/m2
. This should be in the context of a multidisciplinary team, incorporating dietary modification, exercise
intervention and the potential use of pharmacotherapy and
surgical intervention where appropriate. (Level C, Class I).
Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
Studies have reported a variable prevalence of post-transplant
DM and although some of the variability may be explained
by different diagnostic criteria, values range from 13% to
61%.154 157e159 The prevalence of DM in the post-transplant
group is 6.0 times higher (95% CI 4.2 to 8.4) than in age and
sex matched control populations.160 Insulin resistance has
been documented in almost all patients with pretransplant
cirrhosis.161 162 After transplantation, insulin sensitivity
improves,161e163 but importantly many patients (in excess of
40%) remain insulin resistant.109
Patients with DM have increased mortality post-transplant in
comparison with non-diabetic patients.34 While mortality
in patients whose DM is controlled by diet alone is not increased
in comparison with non-diabetic post transplant patients, those
patients on oral agents and/or insulin therapy have increased
mortality.164 More detailed outcome studies are urgently needed
and there are currently no published data that have examined
the impact of glycaemic control on outcome in patients transplanted for NASH.
Recommendation 30: Post-transplant patients should be
screened for the presence of DM and, if present, reviewed
regularly for the development of complications. Glycaemic
control should be optimised in accordance with NICE guidance.
(Level A, Class I).
Cardiovascular risk
There is a high incidence of cardiovascular events in LT recipients, with an increased standardised risk compared with a
non-transplant population.41 Twenty-six per cent of deaths in
post-transplant NASH patients are due to cardiovascular
causes.128 Patients with post-transplant metabolic syndrome
have significantly more cardiovascular events than those
without metabolic syndrome (30% vs 8%).154
Recommendation 31: Patients transplanted for NASH
should be closely monitored on a 6 monthly basis for risk factors
for cardiovascular disease (BP, lipids, haemoglobin A1c), which
should be addressed with the intention of reducing cardiovascular events. (Level II-3, Level C Class I) (Level C, Class I).
Hypertension
The prevalence of hypertension after LT is significantly higher
than that in the general population (standard prevalence ratio
3.07, 95% CI 2.35 to 3.93).160 While accepted JNC-7 (Seventh
Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) definitions of
hypertension applydthat is BP $140/90 mm Hgdpatients with
type 2 DM, common in this population, and/or renal dysfunction,
should have a target BP <130/80 mm Hg.
Non-pharmacological measures including weight reduction,
salt restriction, physical activity and alcohol restriction are
recommended despite the absence of specific trials. The aim of
pharmacological therapy is to achieve the target BP, and in the
setting of LT there is evidence that calcium channel blockers,
b blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are
efficacious in this respect.165e168 Specific agents may also confer
additional benefits, such as reduction of proteinuria169 and
prevention of liver fibrosis170 with angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors, although these are not yet proven.171
Recommendation 32: A BP target of 140/90 mm Hg (130/
80 mm Hg in patients with DM and/or renal dysfunction)
should be aimed for. (Level A, Class I).
Recommendation 33: Antihypertensive agents such as
calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme

inhibitors should be considered in view of their possible additional effect of abrogating liver fibrosis. (Level C, Class II).
Dyslipidaemia
The prevalence of post-LT dyslipidaemia ranges from 66% to
85%, usually with a mixed picture of elevated total cholesterol
and triglycerides.172 Although standard treatment thresholds
apply, a target LDL cholesterol of <2.6 mmol/l is advised as the
10 year cardiovascular event rate exceeds 20% for the LT population.172 Therapeutic lifestyle changes are recommended,
although not evidence based. Statins have been shown to be
efficacious173 174; however, consideration should be given to drug
interactions (eg, ciclosporin and calcium channel blockers)
which can be minimised with the use of pravastatin.108 Ezetimibe has been demonstrated to be effective at reducing serum
cholesterol and to have few side effects and no interaction with
immunosuppressive regimens.175 However, long term outcome
studies are not yet available for this agent.
Recommendation 34: A target LDL cholesterol of
<2.6 mmol/l is advised as the 10 year cardiovascular event rate
exceeds 20% for the LT population. Pravastatin and ezetimibe
are preferred agents in view of their demonstrated efficacy and
absence of interactions with CNIs. (Level C, Class IIa).
NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE IN CHILDREN
NASH is now the commonest liver disease in childhood,
reflecting the global increase in childhood obesity.176 177 NASH
currently affects approximately 10% of adolescents and up to
40% of obese adolescents.178 The majority of children who have
undergone biopsy for suspected NASH have some degree of
hepatic fibrosis. This is usually mild, but risk factors for
increased fibrosis include age, the degree of obesity, male sex,
ethnicity and hypopituitarism.176 179
Increased carotid artery intimal thickness occurs in children
with NASH and they have also been shown to have increased
mortality.180 181 It is unclear at present whether the presence of
NASH is itself an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
disease in obese children.
There are four published cases of paediatric transplantation for
NASH.181e183 In two cases the primary aetiology was hypopituitarism, and all four cases had hepatopulmonary syndrome as the
immediate indication for transplantation. All survived, but
recurrence of NASH with significant fibrosis was universal within
the first year. In one case this required repeat transplantation after
3 years. Another case was treated with metformin and initial
moderate fibrosis resolved 3 years post-transplant.
Pre-transplant assessment
Investigations should include routine pretransplant assessment
but in addition should focus on components of the metabolic
syndrome, including fasting lipid profile, hyperuricaemia,
hypertension and evaluation of pituitary function. Specific
screening for hepatopulmonary syndrome including, as
a minimum, saturation monitoring, is indicated. At present
there is insufficient evidence to justify formal invasive screening
for cardiovascular disease.
Indications for transplantation
These are similar to those for end stage liver disease of any cause.
Management post-transplantation
No specific evidence guidelines can be recommended; however,
in the absence of autoimmune disease, steroid administration
should be minimised. It would appear sensible to minimise
calcineurin inhibition by the use of antimetabolites such as
mycophenolate or azathioprine.
Monitoring
Evidence based recommendations cannot be given. Good practice would suggest active monitoring for components of the
metabolic syndrome and protocol liver biopsies at 1, 5 and 10
years post-transplant.
De novo post-transplant NASH
This may well turn out to be a quantitatively more important
issue than NASH as a primary indication for LT, given the high
incidence of obesity following transplantation. However, although
current long term studies suggest that fibrosis is a common
finding in late post-transplant biopsies, in these cases it does not
appear to be related to the development of fatty liver disease.184 185
Longer follow-up of patients who have become obese after LTwill
provide insights on the burden of de novo NASH.
TRANSPLANTATION FOR NASHdTHE PATIENTS’ PERSPECTIVE
Improving awareness and reducing stigma
Patient feedback suggests that opportunities for early intervention and diagnosis in patients with key risk factors for NASH,
such as obesity, DM and insulin resistance, are being missed,
leading to unnecessary disease progression. Many patients also
report a degree of stigma associated with liver disease in the
public’s perception. This can be very difficult for patients and
families to deal with and can make them feel very isolated.
Patients, and in particular family members, say they would have
liked to have been forewarned about the symptoms of advanced
liver disease and not just been given information on the transplant process. Many mention hepatic encephalopathy as being
particularly distressing and feel that understanding the cause
would have reduced this distress.
Recommendation 35: There is a need to increase understanding of liver disease and its many causes, to improve patient
outcomes and reduce the stigma many patients experience. (Not
graded).
Patients diagnosed with NASH, particularly those who do not
have obvious symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, report
confusion or lack of information on their diagnosis, its cause and
what they can do to manage and improve their condition. With
appropriate advice, management and support, patients can make
lifestyle changes, improve liver health and avoid transplantation.
Many patients struggle to maintain lifestyle changes in the long
term. Many receive ongoing monitoring for clinical symptoms
but no support for maintaining lifestyle changes.
Some patients believe they will be a ‘different person’ posttransplant and can find it difficult to come to terms with
ongoing health problems. Those who suffered from depression,
stress or eating disorders prior to transplant can find themselves
falling back into old patterns.
It is important that patients understand the cardiovascular
risks associated with both NASH and LT and what they can do
to reduce these. Family members have a key role in supporting
patients pre- and post-transplant, particularly with understanding and managing diet and being aware of symptoms. It is
important that they are given information and involved in
decisions.
Recommendation 36: The potential cardiovascular
morbidity associated with NASH should be discussed with
patients and guidance given on diet and exercise, and sources of
support (including psychological support) as part of ongoing
management. (Not graded).

Psychological impact
The emotional and psychological impacts of the transplant
process are significant and can be particularly difficult for people
without good support from family and friends, or for those who
have suffered from depression before transplantation. Patients can
find it helpful to be put in touch with people who have previously
been through the transplant experience, often as part of support
groups. People who receive a transplant say they struggle to put
into words the gratitude they feel towards the transplant team
and the donor family. They therefore find it difficult to raise any
complaints directly with the transplant team. Some patients (and
their family members) have difficulty post-transplant in coming
to terms with a transplanted organ. Patients also report experiencing flashbacks to their time in intensive care and say that they
find it difficult to discuss these feelings with the transplant teams.
The need for confidential emotional and psychological support is
often raised by patients and carers.
Recommendation 37: Provision of independent pre- and
post-transplant emotional and psychological counselling and
support is very important, along with an opportunity to provide
confidential feedback to the transplant team postoperatively.
(Not graded).

helpline enquiries, case studies, contacts and transplant support
groups.
