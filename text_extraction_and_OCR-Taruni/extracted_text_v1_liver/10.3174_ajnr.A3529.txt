ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conventional 3D-DSA volumes are reconstructed from a series of projections containing temporal
information. It was our purpose to develop a technique which would generate fully time-resolved 3D-DSA vascular volumes having better
spatial and temporal resolution than that which is available with CT or MR angiography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a single contrast injection, projections from the mask and fill rotation are subtracted to create a series
of vascular projections. With the use of these projections, a conventional conebeam CT reconstruction is generated (conventional
3D-DSA). This is used to constrain the reconstruction of individual 3D temporal volumes, which incorporate temporal information from the
acquired projections (4D-DSA).
RESULTS: Typically, 30 temporal volumes per second are generated with the use of currently available flat detector systems, a factor of
200 increase over that achievable with the use of multiple gantry rotations. Dynamic displays of the reconstructed volumes are viewable
from any angle. Good results have been obtained by using both intra-arterial and intravenous injections.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to generate time-resolved 3D-DSA vascular volumes with the use of commercially available flat
detector angiographic systems and clinically practical injection protocols. The spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the time
frames are largely determined by that of the conventional 3D-DSA constraining image and not by that of the projections used to
generate the 3D reconstruction. The spatial resolution and temporal resolution exceed that of CTA and MRA, and the small vessel
contrast is increased relative to that of conventional 2D-DSA due to the use of maximum intensity projections.

n 1980, when DSA was introduced,1-3 it was originally hoped
that intravenous x-ray angiography would be feasible. However, the inability to clearly visualize vascular structures caused by
vessel overlap as well as limited signal-to-noise ratio due to then
available contrast medium and the image intensifier (II) detector
technology quickly led to the adaption of techniques by use of
small intra-arterial (IA) contrast injections in combination with
the newly available real-time digital imaging capabilities. This capability greatly facilitated the development of the minimally invasive procedures by using x-ray angiography and the field of interventional radiology in general.
The feasibility of obtaining rotational volume acquisitions by using a C-arm angiographic system equipped with an II was initially
simulated in 1988 and then by use of an II-based apparatus, implemented in 1996 by Ning and Kruger.4,5 In 1997, Fahrig et al6,7 extended this work showing both in vitro and in vivo results. These
systems, as well as currently used systems with flat detectors, allow
creation of 1 3D-DSA volume per gantry rotation. Since the introduction of commercial angiographic systems and software suitable
for performing 3D-DSA in 1999, the assessment of vasculature in
interventional x-ray suites has been done by using the combination
of 3D-DSA volume reconstructions (non–time-resolved) and multiple conventional 2D-DSA acquisitions. Multiple 2D acquisitions
have been necessary because of 1) the need to visualize the sequences
of vascularfilling and2) theinability to clearly see anatomic details on
the 3D reconstructions because of the resulting overlap of arterial
and, in some instances, venous structures. The need to obtain multiple 2D temporal series at the desired view angle obviously contributes significantly to the radiation exposure and contrast medium
dose associated with these examinations.

The method that we describe involves the use of a 3D-DSA
vascular volume as a constraining image. The proposed reconstruction method uses all, or most of, the projections obtained
after a rotational acquisition done before (mask run) and after (fill
run) the injection of contrast medium. This constraining volume
is combined with the acquired projections to form a time-series of
3D volumes (4D-DSA). The 3D-DSA depicts an average of the
vascular opacification present during the rotational acquisition.
Each of the individual projections used to form the standard 3DDSA volume contains temporal information. Although it must be
understood that a CT volume cannot be reconstructed from a
single projection, we do not propose a new 3D-DSA volume reconstruction technique. We have developed algorithms that permit 3D-DSA time-resolved volumes (4D-DSA) to be generated by
use of the constraining volume and single x-ray projections.
Rather than 1 vascular volume per gantry rotation, this technique
typically generates 30 time-resolved 3D-DSA volumes per second
(by use of a currently available flat detector angiographic system),
a rate 200 times faster than could be achieved by use of sequential gantry rotations, and at the same contrast and x-ray dose as
used to obtain 1 standard 3D-DSA volume.
This capability allows for the viewing of the vasculature in a dynamic display, at any angle, for all time points at any desired angle.
This largely eliminates the problem of vessel overlap. The availability
of a “library” of time-resolved 3D timeframes thus facilitates diagnosis by providing the ability to view the anatomy not only in any desired view but also to do this at any desired phase of vascular filling,
thus eliminating any confusion that might occur as the result of vascular overlap. An additional benefit is that it provides a library of
vascular roadmaps at any stage of vascular filling for use in endovascular therapeutic procedures.
The purpose of the work was to investigate the feasibility of reconstructing time-resolved 3D vascular volumes (4D-DSA) from conventional
3D-DSA acquisitions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Acquisition
All images were acquired by use of either
a biplane Artis dBA system or an Artis
Zeego flat detector angiographic system
(Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). All human and animal studies were performed
under institutionally approved institutional review board and/or Animal Care
and Use Committee protocols. Rotational images for subtracted 3D reconstructions were obtained by use of 5-, 8-,
or 10-second acquisitions to capture the
full cycle of contrast inflow and washout. To obtain a sufficient number of
consistent projections for an accurate
3D reconstruction and to capture inflow
and washout, the rotational acquisition
must be long enough to follow a bolus
through the vasculature. This may be
achieved by use of either multiple C-arm rotations or by use of
C-arm rotations of an appropriate duration, for example, 5, 8, or
10 seconds. It seems likely that, depending on the dynamics of the
circulation, that is, fast or slow, there will be particular acquisition
protocols that are optimal for particular conditions, for example,
a 5-second acquisition for evaluation of a patient with an aneurysm at the circle of Willis or a fast-flow carotid cavernous fistula
or an 8- or 10-second acquisition for a patient with occlusive
disease in which filling occurs by collaterals. More experience is
required before definite recommendations can be given regarding
choice of an optimal acquisition protocol. Intravenous studies
were performed after injection of iohexol (300 mg I/mL) into a
peripheral vein at the rate of 4 mL/s over 8 –10 seconds followed
by a 10-mL saline chase injected at the same rate. Intra-arterial
studies were obtained by use of injection of 5–8 mL iohexol.
Image Processing and Reconstruction Process
Four-dimensional DSA reconstruction uses multiplicative projection processing to generate a series of time-resolved 3D volumes (4D-DSA) by embedding the time-resolved data from the
standard projections of a rotational acquisition. Before back projection, the individual projections from the acquisition are spatially convolved to increase the SNR. They therefore form a low
spatial frequency mask that basically enhances portions of the 3D
constraining image that are present at each point in time. After a
normalization step, this mask then provides proper projection
weighting. As a result of the convolution process, the SNR of the
individual timeframes is limited by the constraining image SNR
ratio and not by the SNR of the individual projections. When the
single projections are back-projected into the 3D volume, there is
a tendency for the projection values from overlapping vessels to
FIG 1. Schematic of 4D-DSA reconstruction. After creation of the 4D-DSA timeframes, each one
may be viewed in a dynamic form showing the inflow and outflow of contrast from the vasculature, just as with a standard 2D-DSA series. As shown on the 2 series of 4 images at the bottom of
the illustration, any selected time (in this case, the image framed in red in the top row of 4 images)
may be viewed at any desired angle. Four possible views of the selected image are shown in the
bottom row of 4 images.

cause the deposition of erroneous signal (an opacity shadow from
opacified vessel to nonopacified vessel) into vessels in the 3D volume. To reduce this effect, for each timeframe, an angular (temporal) search is performed, looking for a range of time before and
after the frame that is being projected. After this search, the minimum signal for each voxel is assumed to be due to the ray with the
minimum degree of overlap; that value is then assigned to the
timeframe being processed. For voxels requiring an angle other
than the current angle as a result of the search, the temporal resolution is lower than the typical 30/s rate, as data from a different
timeframe are substituted. The frequency of this depends on the
sparsity of the vessel configuration. However, overall volume
frame rates of 6 frames/s are typical. Figure 1 illustrates the steps in
this process. Any of the time-resolved 3D timeframes (3D volumes) can be rotated for viewing at whatever angle the user
thinks gives the clearest depiction of the relevant vasculature.
These 3D timeframes can be viewed with playback speed reduced or increased, paused, or replayed as desired. The user
interface provides for interactive 4D viewing of the 3D temporal volume timeframes and provides for a true interactive 4D
viewing experience of the contrast-enhanced perfusion of a
vascular network.
Estimate of Relative SNR
The SNR values for the acquired projections, for 3D-DSA and for
4D-DSA, were estimated by placing regions of interest in the images. Because variations of the signal selected by the maximum
intensity projection process can contribute to the standard deviation in a region of interest, the statistical variations in the
4D-DSA image were measured from the difference between 2
successive 4D-DSA frames that were rotated to the same position. In the 3D-DSA, these variations were very small, so no
subtraction was performed. It was not possible to subtract sequential acquired projections because they are not 3D-rotatable and cannot be registered for subtraction. Thus, the presence of these potential signal variations in the acquired
FIG 2. Images show a selected projection from a 3D-DSA rotational acquisition (top left), a 4D-DSA timeframe (center), and a standard 3D-DSA
reconstruction (right). The SNRs of the 3 images at the region indicated by the yellow arrows are shown beneath each image. The single image
at the bottom shows traces of the profile across the 2 arteries indicated by the red line. These images were obtained by use of an IA injection
of contrast medium.

projection region of interest could have decreased the measured SNR shown in Fig 2.
Simulation of Flow Information From 4D-DSA
A digital phantom was constructed to simulate the various steps in
signal curve generation. The phantom consisted of a vein and an
artery running perpendicular to the vein. Each was assigned venous and arterial -variate time dependences. A 4D-DSA reconstruction was performed with the use of a constraining volume
obtained from the reconstruction of the known vessel distribution. Signal curves were then generated from 2 selected regions
of interest for different versions of the 4D-DSA reconstruction
algorithm.
Quantitative Color-Coded 4D-DSA
Previous work has shown the ability to create color-coded parametric images from 2D-DSA series.8,9 Because the basic 4D-DSA
images contain signal that is proportional to the contrast (iodine)
concentration as a function of time, it is possible to also view these
series as a color-coded display showing contrast time of arrival
(TOA) in each pixel. TOA maps were created by first forming a
volume showing the highest contrast concentration, that is, vessel
opacification that occurred during the rotational acquisition
(Cmax) and noting the time to reach Cmax/4 on a per-voxel basis.
Color-coded 4D-DSA images were obtained by multiplying TOA
maps by a binarized version of the 4D-DSA MIP timeframes.
A method for displaying regions of
vascular anatomy with increasing times
of the contrast bolus arrival can be
achieved by multiplying the TOA image by a sliding window that sequentially reveals pixels within a TOA range
defined by the window. We refer to
this as a bolus arrival mode. For the
results illustrating this capability, we
used a Gaussian display window with
full width at half maximum of 20 4DDSA timeframes.
RESULTS
Simulation of Reconstruction
Elements
The angular search results in some distortion of the signal waveforms. When it
is desired to generate quantitative signal
curves, the effect of this can be limited
because it is possible to omit points from
the waveform for which the search resulted in the choice of a projection that is
too remote (in time) from the current
frame. The signal curve then can be interpolated by use of points for which the
search resulted in a suitable temporal
displacement, for example, below a chosen threshold.
For the purpose of generating signal
curves that correspond exactly to the
signal curves in the acquired projections, it is possible to modify the basic reconstruction algorithm
to include a binary version of the constraining image. In this case,
the projection values are directly deposited in the 3D vascular
space and will reproduce the signal curves provided by the projections. This series of 3D volumes does not accurately represent
the actual opacification of the vascular network because of vessel
overlap and the use of the back-projection step used to create
these volumes. However, for the purpose of generating individual
voxel signal curves, there are several characteristics of the 4D-DSA
reconstruction algorithm that affect the resultant curves that
aim to correct the vessel overlap problem inherent in the 3D
timeframe volumes. This is demonstrated in the simulations performed with the digital phantom.
As shown in Fig 3, after the basic back-projection step when
the projections are multiplied by a binary constraining image (upper right), there are signal peaks caused by the alignment of the
vessels with the projection direction. When these are present, they
can occasionally give the impression of reversed flow. These peaks
are somewhat reduced when the angular search is added to the
reconstruction (Fig 3, lower left panel). Better results are obtained
when the projections are normalized by dividing them by an estimate of the number of aligned voxels along the individual rays,
obtained from the constraining image (Fig 3, lower right panel).
These normalizing projection images (1 per projection) are created by forward projections of the thresholded and binarized conFIG 3. Demonstration of the effects of reconstruction elements on accuracy of reconstructed
simulated vessel signal curves. The digital phantom is shown in the top frame on the left. The vessels
in the phantom (phantom artery and phantom vein) had specified time dependence. These are considered to represent ground truth. The input time curves for these vessels are shown in each panel for
comparison. C indicates constraining image; P, projections. The reconstructed wave forms are shown:
1) after multiplication (represented by C  P) of the projections by a binary constraining image (top
right); 2) multiplication of the projections by the binary constraining image plus an angular minimum
search (represented by C  P  search, bottom left); and 3) multiplication of the projections by the
binary constraining image followed by normalization by the estimate of the numbers of projected ray
voxels obtained from the constraining image (CPNorm, bottom right). The y-axis shows arbitrary
units of attenuation. The x-axis shows the projection number.

straining image. With the use of this method, the similarity of the
reconstructed signal curves to those of the input signal curves is
satisfactory. This technique effectively helps to weight deposition
of the attenuation coefficient in voxels along a ray, resulting in
more accurate 4D-DSA raw 3D temporal volume when a normalized projection is back-projected.
Anatomic Display
Imparting temporal resolution to an already reconstructed 3D vascular volume
requires far fewer multiplicative projections than if the goal were to reconstruct
a vascular (anatomic) volume itself by
summing a limited number of projections. In our technique, the anatomic
structures in those voxels have already
been reconstructed. Time dependence
can then be effectively performed with
the use of a small number of multiplicative projections.10,11
Figure 4 shows a series of 4D-DSA
arterial phase images from a study performed for evaluation of an unruptured
aneurysm. These illustrate the ability to
view the time-resolved 4D series from
any desired viewing angle. This ability to
retrospectively view a dynamic angiographic sequence from any arbitrary view angle can potentially
result in a significant reduction in radiation exposure because, in
our experience, to obtain optimal views, it is not unusual to require multiple 2D acquisitions even when performing a “tarFIG 4. Four-dimensional DSA reconstruction from a 3D-DSA reconstruction performed for evaluation of an unruptured paraclinoid aneurysm.
An IA injection of contrast was used for this examination. The top row shows selected timeframes viewed at the rate of 6 frames per second
at a fixed viewing angle. The bottom row shows the same timeframes viewed at 4 different angles, which would have not been obtainable in a
biplane acquisition because of the mechanical inability to position the A-plane gantry (red icon).

geted” (single vessel) diagnostic examination. This ability also removes the need to obtain extreme cranial-caudal views that
require passing x-rays through a highly attenuating path. With
4D-DSA, such views can be achieved with the use of a reconstruction acquired from data acquired such that rays traverse a much
less attenuating trajectory.
Ourinitial efforts to useintravenousinjections of contrastin conjunction with DSA were hampered by the overlap of vascular structures on the 2D images.With 4D-DSA, this limitation is largely overcome because optimal views, which avoid overlap, can be chosen
and viewed at any stage of vascular filling (any view angle at any
timeframe and any timeframe at any view angle). This is illustrated in
Fig 5, in which the course of the right internal carotid artery can be
clearly seen in the early arterial phase 4D-DSA timeframe.
SNR and Vessel Profiles
Figure 2 shows a comparison of SNR values measured in the regions of interest indicated by the yellow arrows. The apparent
SNR of the acquired projection may
have been decreased because of anatomic variations during gantry rotation.
Also shown are normalized vessel profiles along the red lines indicated. The
profile across these 2 arteries on the acquired projection is noisy. Determination of the exact 4D-DSA spatial resolution requires more careful experiments
with the use of well-defined phantoms.
These studies are ongoing.
Figure 6 illustrates the ability to color-code a 4D-DSA image such that
quantitative information about blood
flow can be extracted. This example
shows a 4D reconstruction of a study
performed for evaluation of an AVM.
DISCUSSION
In this report, we have demonstrated the
feasibility of generating time-resolved
3D-DSA vascular volumes with the use
of commercially available flat detector
angiographic systems and clinically
practical injection protocols. A review of
other angiographic methods (both timeresolved and non–time-resolved) indicates that 4D-DSA can provide spatial
and temporal resolution that exceeds
that of these competing techniques, for
example, MRA and CTA. In particular,
4D-DSA thus provides a new imaging
technique with spatial and temporal resolution exceeding competing time-resolved angiographic techniques. Figure
7 shows the relative voxel volume and
frame duration for existing time-resolved angiographic methods. We emphasize that this was a feasibility study
with implementation of the technique
with the use of a prototype environment. Studies to understand
the trade-offs of various acquisition and injection protocols are
underway. Full understanding and optimization of these protocols will require significantly more experience and use of the
technology.
Validation studies will be required to establish the reconstructed matrix size and radiation dose that would be required to
provide the highest-resolution 4D-DSA volumes. It is interesting
to note that despite recent research developments in MR, the
dominant commercial method is still time-resolved imaging of
contrast kinetics (TRICKS), which has spatial and temporal resolution 2 orders of magnitude below that of 4D-DSA.12
The availability of 4D-DSA provides the user with a technique
that, from a single contrast injection and rotational acquisition
(provided an acceptable constraining volume can be obtained),
provides a library of time-resolved images that may be viewed
from any desired angle at any time during contrast filling and

frames per second for visualization of arrival times between 1 and 4.5 seconds. On the top of the
figure, binarized 4D-DSA timeframes multiply a time-of-arrival map providing a dynamic display in
which each pixel in each timeframe is represented by a quantitative time of arrival value. In the
bottom half of the figure, a sliding Gaussian display window is used to show the passage of the
bolus through the AVM. The 4D-DSA TOA volume (static) and 4D-DSA TOA (dynamic) 3D
timeframes can be viewed from any angle. The 4D-DSA TOA (dynamic) 3D timeframes allow viewing
of the temporal dynamics of the 4D-DSA TOA from any angle at any point in time forwhich datawere
acquired. These images were obtained by use of an IA injection of contrast medium.

emptying. Although conventional 3D-DSA reconstructions are
viewable at any angle, they do not allow viewing of the vasculature
during different stages of filling and emptying, for example, a pure
arterial phase or pure venous phase. Because 4D-DSA allows this,
it should, in our opinion, allow the performance of many procedures requiring the use of x-ray angiography with significantly
less x-ray exposure and contrast medium dose because it would
reduce the need to obtain multiple 2D-DSA acquisitions. We also
believe that because the time-resolved volume viewable from any
angle at any time will largely eliminate the impact of vascular
overlap, that 4D-DSA will provide a method that will again make
the use of intravenous injections for angiographic studies an attractive alternative to conventional IA studies, thus potentially
increasing the safety (less invasive) and efficacy (obtaining images
of all relevant vasculature with a single injection and acquisition)
of interventional and diagnostic procedures.
It should be emphasized that 4D-DSA is a purely angiographic
technique and as such only indirectly provides perfusion information, that is, it provides information about blood flow to tissue.
This is because it is not possible to reconstruct the tissue surrounding vessels from only a single projection. Although the constraining volume is reconstructed from a large number of projections, the tissue perfusion represented by that volume is an
average, over time, and thus cannot provide dynamic perfusion
information. It is possible, however, that 4D-DSA could provide
valuable arterial input function information for alternate schemes
of measuring perfusion with a C-arm angiographic system.13
All of the images shown in this report were reconstructed retrospectively and were not available at the time of the actual examinations. The reconstruction time per 4D-DSA frame is presently
less than 1 second. Clinical validation of
the anatomic and temporal accuracy as
well as documentation regarding the
value of the technique in reducing procedure times, x-ray exposure, and contrast medium dose will start once the
technique is developed to a point at
which it may be transferred to a clinical
angiographic system.
Four-dimensional DSA will ultimately
be used along with 4Dfluoroscopy, a technique that will provide real-time fluoroscopic roadmap views from any arbitrary
direction without a need for gantry movement. Together, 4D-DSA and 4D fluoroscopy should increase diagnostic capabilities and improve the safety and
efficacy of endovascular interventions.
CONCLUSIONS
It is feasible to generate time-resolved
3D-DSA vascular volumes with the use
of commercially available flat detector
angiographic systems and clinically
practical injection protocols. The spatial
resolution and SNR of the timeframes
are largely determined by that of the
conventional 3D-DSA constraining image and not by that of the projections used to generate the 3D
reconstruction. The voxel volume and temporal resolution are
theoretically almost 10 times that of CTA and MRA, and the
small-vessel contrast is increased relative to that of conventional
2D-DSA as the result of the ability to use MIP renderings. The
availability of 4D-DSA should greatly reduce the need to acquire
multiple 2D series during examinations. The availability of 4DDSA volumes viewable from any angle at any time completes the
transition of DSA to a full 4D angiographic technique.12,13
