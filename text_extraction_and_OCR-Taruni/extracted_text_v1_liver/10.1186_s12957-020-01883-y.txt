Abstract
Background: The benefit of surgery in patients with non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases (NCRN
NELM) remains controversial. At the population level, several statistical prognostic factors and scores have been
proposed but inconsistently verified. At the patient level, no selection criteria have been demonstrated to guide
individual therapeutic decision making. We aimed to evaluate potential individual selection criteria to predict the
benefit of surgery in patients undergoing treatment for NCRNNELM.
Methods: Data for 114 patients undergoing surgery for NCRNNELM were reviewed. In this population, we
identified an early relapse group (ER), defined as patients with unresectable recurrence < 1 year postoperatively
who did not benefit from surgery (N = 28), and a long-term survival group (LTS), defined as patients who were
recurrence-free ≥ 5 years postoperatively and benefited from surgery (N = 20). Clinicopathologic parameters, the
Association Française de Chirurgie (AFC) score, and a modified 4-point Clinical Risk Score (mCRS) (excluding CEA
level) were analyzed and compared between LTS and ER groups.
Results: The majority of patients were female and a majority had an ASA score ≤ 2 at the time of liver surgery. The
median age was 55 years. Almost half of the patients (46%) presented with a single-liver metastasis. Intermediateand low-risk AFC scores represented 40% and 60% of the population, respectively. Five- and 10-year overall survival
(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 56% and 27%, and 30% and 12%, respectively. Negative prognostic
factors were the size of liver metastases > 50 mm and delay between primary and NCRNNELM <24 months for OS
and DFS, respectively. AFC score was not prognostic while high-risk mCRS (scores 3–4) was predictive for the
poorer OS. The clinicopathologic parameters were similar in the ER and LTS groups, except the presence of N+
primary tumor, and the size of liver metastases was significantly higher in the ER group.
Conclusion: In patients with resectable NCRNNELM, no predictive factors or scores were found to accurately
preoperatively differentiate individual cases in whom surgery would be futile from those in whom surgery could be
associated with a significant oncological benefit.

Core tip
We reviewed a series of 114 patients who underwent
surgery with curative intent for non-colorectal nonneuroendocrine liver metastases (NCRNNELM). In the
whole series, a 5-year overall and disease-free survival were
56% and 30%, respectively. At the population level, none of
the previously reported factors or scores was found to be
prognostic. At the individual level, no baseline primary
tumor or liver metastasis characteristic was able to differentiate the patients who would benefit from surgery from
those who would not. These results confirm that surgery is
an effective option in selected patients with NCRNNELM
but strongly highlights the lack of biomarkers to guide individual therapeutic decision making.
Introduction
In contrast to colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), the role
of surgery for the treatment of patients with liver metastases from non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine origin
(NCRNNELM) remains poorly defined [1]. Several reports
have shown that liver resection can lead to prolonged survival and the occasional cure in these cases serve as a
proof-of-concept that surgery could represent an effective
therapy in a subgroup of these patients [2–4]. Different predictive and prognostic factors, mainly related to surrogate
markers of primary tumor aggressiveness, including the rate
of progression and the extent of metastatic disease, have
been proposed [2, 3, 5]. However, apart from the fact that
these factors and risk models have been inconsistently
validated in external series [2, 3, 6–9], their accuracy for
preoperatively distinguishing the individual patients who
will or will not benefit from surgery remains undetermined.
In fact, this question regarding the benefit of surgery in
these oncological patients is complex as benefits may range
from improved quality of life and avoidance or delay of several lines of chemotherapy to prolonged survival and cure.
In patients with NCRNNELM in particular, which includes
a variety of primary tumors with different tumor biologies,
the results of surgery should be carefully balanced against
constant improvements in systemic and locoregional treatments [5, 10]. To independently address this question in a
retrospective series, it can be assumed that no oncological
benefit was obtained in patients who developed rapid and
unresectable postoperative recurrence, whereas true oncological benefit was obtained in patients who maintained a
disease-free status for a prolonged time after surgery.
Therefore, we reviewed a recent series of patients who
underwent surgery for NCRNNELM and analyzed the
prognostic value of several preoperative clinico-pathological
factors and of the score developed by the Association
Française de Chirurgie (AFC) [2]. We also tested a new
simple model adapted from the clinical risk score (CRS),
established for patients undergoing surgery for CRLM [11].
To evaluate the potential value of these factors as individual
selection criteria for surgery, we compared the characteristics of patients defined as having obtained no benefit from
surgery (i.e., the patients who developed unresectable recurrence within the first postoperative year), and patients
considered to have benefited from surgery (i.e., the patients
who are recurrence-free at 5 years after the first liver
surgery).
Patients and methods
Patients
A consecutive series of patients who underwent surgery for
NCNNELM between January 2005 and December 2017
were reviewed. In all cases, surgical decisions were made
during multidisciplinary institutional tumor boards. When
neoadjuvant treatment was administered for liver metastases, patients were considered for surgical intervention only
in cases in which they responded to the treatment, as
defined by stable or responding disease according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria [12]. In all patients, surgery was of curative intent for
all liver metastases, consisting of radical surgical resection or
clearance with radiofrequency destruction (RF). The study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institut Jules
Bordet (CE2953) and the Hôpital Erasme (P 2019/232).
Surgery
Surgery was performed by a laparoscopic or open approach
according to the surgeon’s choice. RF was preferentially
reserved for centrally located lesions ≤ 30 mm. Liver resection and RF were performed under intraoperative ultrasound guidance. Resections of 3 or more liver segments
were defined as major hepatectomies. Operative complications were graded according to Clavien-Dindo classification
(CD), as in-hospital or within 90 postoperative days [13].
Major complications were defined as CD grade ≥ III.
Follow-up and patient categorization
After surgery, follow-up data were collected, including
clinical, laboratory, and imaging (computed tomography
scan or magnetic resonance imaging) data. Two groups
of patients were defined: The early relapse group (ER),
including the patients who developed unresectable/nonclearable tumor recurrence in the first year after surgery,
and the long-term survival group (LTS), including the
patients who were disease-free at least 5 years after the
first liver surgery, also including patients who underwent
surgery several times for tumor recurrence. In addition,
to test another cut-off that might correspond to some
benefit of the surgical intervention, we also compared
the ER group with the patients who were disease-free at
least 3 years after the intervention.

Analysis of potential prognostic factors and scores
Several factors, related to demographics, primary tumor
type, and stage, and characteristics of liver metastases,
and two scores were evaluated. First, the AFC score [2],
that includes 6 factors, the origin of the primary tumor
(0 to 3 points), the patient age (0 to 2 points), the
disease-free interval between treatment of the primary
tumor and diagnosis of the liver metastases (0 to 2
points), the presence of extrahepatic metastases (0 to 1
point), a gross residual disease resection (0 to 1 point),
and the need for major hepatectomy (0 to 1 point). According to this score, patients were stratified into three
groups, defined as low- (score of 1 to 3), intermediate-
(score of 4 to 6), or high-risk (score > 6). Second, we
used a modified CRS (mCRS) that we adapted from the
traditional CRS model established for CRLM [11]. Traditional CRS includes 5 parameters, worth 1 point each,
including the nodal invasion of the primary tumor (N+),
a disease-free interval between the primary tumor and
diagnosis of the liver metastases < 12 months, the presence of more than 1 liver metastasis, the largest liver
metastasis > 50 mm, and a preoperative CEA level > 200
ng/ml. In mCRS, we considered the 4 first factors without the CEA level because it is not really relevant in
NCRNNELM. Using this 4-point mCRS, patients were
stratified into low- or high-risk groups according to scores
of 0 to 2 and 3 to 4. The predictive values of different parameters and of the AFC and mCRS scores were evaluated
in the entire series and compared between the ER and LTS
groups. Similar comparisons were made between the ER
group and the group of patients who were disease-free at
3 years after surgery. In addition, to evaluate the potential
impact of primary tumor origin, we separately analyzed the
results in patients with liver metastases from breast and
non-breast origins, from digestive (including esophageal,
gastric, pancreatic, small intestine) and non-digestive origins, from genitourinary and non-genitourinary origins,
and from sarcoma and non-sarcoma origins.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed with the statistical software
SPSS v25. Descriptive analysis of all of the clinical and
histological parameters was done. OS was defined as the
time from the date of first liver surgery to the date of
death from any cause. DFS was considered to be the
time from the date of surgery to the date of detection of
first recurrence or death. Survival curves were generated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. For uni- and multivariate analyses of AFC score, mCRS, and each element
of both scores, hazard ratios were calculated using Cox
regression analysis. Factors with univariate significance
at a level of p value < 0.1 were entered into a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. In multivariate
models, a p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
Clinicopathologic parameters were compared between
the ER and LTS groups using the Mann-Whitney U test
for continuous data and with the chi-square test for categorical variables.
Results
Patient characteristics
Data for 114 patients undergoing surgery for NCRN
NELM were analyzed. Patient demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics are shown in Table 1. The
majority of patients were female, the median age was 55
years, and the majority of patients had an ASA score ≤ 2
at the time of liver surgery. None of the patients had
chronic liver dysfunction such as cirrhosis. The majority
of liver metastases were of breast cancer origin (61%),
followed by genitourinary, sarcoma, gastrointestinal,
melanoma, and squamous cancers. None of the patients
had extrahepatic metastases at the time of diagnosis and
surgery for liver metastases. Lymph node metastases
were present with primary tumors in 40% of the patients. In 38% and 49% of the patients, the disease-free
interval between the primary tumor and liver metastases
was > 12 months and > 24 months, respectively. Neoadjuvant treatment was administered for the primary
tumor in 37% and adjuvant therapy in 70% of the cases.
Liver metastases were multiple in 54% and > 50 mm in
20% of the cases. At the time of liver surgery, no patient
had been diagnosed with extrahepatic metastases. After
the diagnosis of liver metastases, 83% of patients
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery and
58% received adjuvant chemotherapy. According to the
AFC score, 60% had a low risk, 40% had an intermediate
risk, and no patients had high-risk disease. According to
mCRS, 77% had a low score and 23% had a high score.
Surgery
Surgical data and postoperative outcomes are detailed in
Table 1. Surgery was mainly performed via an open
approach, representing 69% of the cases. Major hepatectomies represented 20% of the cases. RF was used in
29%. Postoperative complications occurred in 20% of the
cases, including major complications in 11%. No postoperative mortality was observed.
Postoperative outcomes
After a median follow-up of 81 months, 65 patients
(57%) experienced recurrence. The median time to recurrence was 10 months. The liver represented the most
common site for recurrence (44%) and the exclusive site
in a third of the patients. Other sites of recurrence were
the lung, peritoneum, brain, and bone in 4%, 3%, 1%,
and 1%, respectively. Eleven patients (10%) underwent
additional surgery for liver recurrence, including 1
patient who underwent 3 liver interventions (Table 1).

In the whole cohort, 3-, 5- and 10-year OS were 76%,
56%, and 27%, respectively, with a median OS of 65
months (Fig. 1). Three- and 5-year DFS were 39% and
30%, respectively, with a median DFS of 18 months
(Fig. 2). Postoperative survival was similar in patients
who underwent surgery for breast cancer or for nonbreast cancer liver metastases, with 3-, 5-, and 10-year
OS rates of 70.2%, 50%, and 23% versus 86%, 69%, and
34%, respectively (p = 0.142), and 3- and 5-year DFS
rates of 31% versus 23% and 49% and 42%, respectively
(p = 0.322). Postoperative survival was also similar in
patients who underwent surgery for digestive or for

non-digestive cancer liver metastases, with 3- and 5-
year OS rates of 81.4% and 50.9% versus 74.9% and
56.7%, respectively (p = 0.705), and 3- and 5-year DFS
rates of 36% and 24% versus 37% and 31%, respectively
(p = 0.966). Postoperative survival was also similar in
patients who underwent surgery for sarcoma and nonsarcoma liver metastases, with 3- and 5-year OS rates
of 88.9% and 71.1% versus 74.5% and 54.5%, respectively (p = 0.191), and 3- and 5-year DFS rates of 52.5%
and 35% versus 35.7% and 29.5%, respectively (p = 0.4).
Interestingly, 3- and 5-year OS rates in genitourinary
and non-genitourinary were of 100% and 83.3% versus
73.1% and 53.3%, respectively (p = 0.08), and 3- and 5-
year DFS rates of 75% and 75% versus 33% and 26%, respectively (p = 0.027) (Table 2).
Univariate and multivariate regression analysis of
potential prognostic factors
In univariate analysis, liver metastasis size > 50 mm and
primary tumor N+ status were significantly associated
with poorer OS, while only liver metastasis size > 50 mm
remained predictive for poor OS in multivariate analysis
(Table 3). The only significant poor predictive factor for
DFS was a time interval between the diagnosis of the
primary tumor and of the liver metastasis of < 24
months (p = 0.013). When AFC score was categorized

into low and intermediate risks, no difference was observed for survival. When mCRS was categorized into
low and high risks, a significant difference was observed
for OS (p = 0.009, HR = 2.05 + 95% CI (1.12–3.76)), but
not for DFS, (p = 0.31). The significance of mCRS for
OS was not confirmed in multivariate analysis (p = 0.7).
Comparison of the early relapse and long-term survival
groups
From the overall cohort, we identified 28 patients who
recurred within the first postoperative year (ER group)
(24.5%) and 20 patients who were disease-free at least 5
years after surgery (LTS group) (17.5%) (Table 4). The
proportions of breast NCRNNELM were similar in the 2
groups, representing 18 (46%) and 13 (65%) patients in
the ER and LTS groups, respectively. Clinicopathologic
parameters were similar overall between the ER and LTS
groups, except for the presence of N+ primary tumor
and liver metastasis size that were significantly higher in
the ER group. Of note, liver metastases > 50 mm and the
disease-free interval between diagnosis of the primary
tumor and of the liver metastasis were not significantly
differently distributed among ER and LTS patients. AFC
score did not discriminate between ER and LTS patients,
either for the values of the score (p = 0.7) or when
categorized into low and intermediate risks (p = 0.7).
Similarly, mCRS scores were similar among ER and LTS
patients (p = 0.1), whereas low- and high-risk mCRS patients tended to be differently distributed, high-risk
mCRS representing 12/28 (43%) of the ER patients and

0.059). When comparing the ER patients with those who
were recurrence-free at 3 years after surgery, the ER
group was associated with more lymphatic invasion at
the primary tumor (p = 0.002), had a higher number of
LMs preoperatively (p = 0.02), and received more neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery for the primary (p =

recurrence-free at 3 years, the AFC score was not significantly different in ER patients, while mCRS was significantly higher (p = 0.037) (Table 4).
Discussion
The term NCRNNELM corresponds to a heterogeneous
group of patients with liver metastases from various origins. This denomination is mainly used by surgeons to
define cases where, in contrast with CRLM [14], the surgical indication remains controversial. Currently, in the
absence of controlled or case-matched studies, the real
benefit of surgery in patients with NCRNNELM remains
difficult to assess and it is challenging to determine
whether long-term postoperative survival in some of
these patients results from the surgical treatment itself
or from the selection of a subgroup with favorable
tumor biology. However, as in patients with CRLM,
long-term DFS obtained after surgery for NCRNNELM
indicates that some of these patients may have an intermediate tumor progression profile, characterized by a
limited metastatic capacity, as defined by oligometastatic
status [15–17]. Therefore, as in CRLM, the identification
of biomarkers of such oligometastatic behavior would
represent highly relevant progress toward a better understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in
different modes of tumor progression and for personalized therapeutic decision making. In this view, specific
markers of tumor biology that can be used to predict the
benefit of surgery in individual cases are critically
needed, even more than population-based prognostic

models. To address this question, the characterization of
the long-term disease-free survivors after surgery for
NCRNNELM (oligometastatic cases who benefited from
surgery) as compared with the patients who developed
rapid postoperative recurrences (the diffuse metastatic
cases who did not benefit from surgery) may represent a
first step toward identifying accurate, clinically available
selection criteria. In particular, in such a heterogeneous
group of patients, the respective contributions of surgery
and systemic treatment for improving the outcome
could be difficult to discriminate. In that sense, it might
be assumed that both the patients with prolonged DFS
and those with rapid recurrence after surgery represent
appropriate target groups to be identified preoperatively,
corresponding to the good candidates for surgery and to
those in whom surgery should be contraindicated,
respectively.
In this series, we observed postoperative outcomes
that were similar overall to those recently reported in
the literature [1, 2, 7, 18, 19]. At 3 and 5 years, OS
rates were 75% and 55% and DFS rates were 40% and
30%, respectively, and surgery was associated with limited operative morbidity and no mortality, confirming
that surgery may represent an effective and safe therapeutic option in selected patients with NCRNNELM
[7]. Furthermore, the fact that prolonged DFS was obtained in approximately a third of the patients may
serve as a proof-of-concept for the existence of oligometastatic progression in some of these cases. In contrast with other studies, we could only identify a few
prognostic factors, related to the primary tumor stage
and the extent of liver involvement [2, 6, 18, 19]. In
multivariate analysis, only the nodal status of the primary tumor and the size of liver metastases were associated with the postoperative OS but not with the risk
of recurrence. In addition, a delay of longer than 2
years between the primary and the diagnosis of liver
metastases appeared to be predictive for improved
DFS, but not for OS. Furthermore, the prognostic
value of the model proposed by the AFC was not verified [2]. Several factors could be responsible for these
discrepancies [2, 3, 7]. Primarily, the present results
were obtained in highly selected patients, as indicated
by the fact that almost half of them had single-liver
metastases and that the patients who progressed on
systemic therapy were excluded. This criterion is likely
to have excluded the patients with the poorest tumor
biology. Our cohort included only patients with low or
moderate risk according to AFC score. Nevertheless, in
the original series published by Adam, only 3% of the
population had a high-risk AFC score [2], while ranging from 3 to 6% in other series [3, 7]. In addition to
the AFC score, we also evaluated the prognostic value
of a simple mCRS, derived from the traditional CRS
established for patients with CRLM. Interestingly, this
4-point mCRS appears, in this series, to be of potentially higher prognostic value as compared with the
AFC score. In univariate analysis, mCRS was predictive
for OS but not for DFS. Even though mCRS was not
prognostic in multivariate analysis and this very preliminary observation has to yet be confirmed in larger
groups, it may suggest that similar pathways, eventually reflected by similar surrogates, could be responsible for tumor aggressiveness in CRLM and NCRN
NELM. Along this line, even if the numbers in each
category are limited, we did not observe a prognostic
impact of the origin of the primary tumor, such as
breast versus non-breast or digestive versus nondigestive. Also, this observation may potentially encourage others to test candidate biomarkers that have
been recently demonstrated in CRLM in patients with
NCRNNELM [20–26].
Based on our initial definition of the ER and LTS
groups, with a postoperative DFS cut-off of ≤ 1 year and
> 5 years, respectively, we observed that approximately,
a quarter of the patients underwent oncologically futile
surgery, whereas surgery was associated with a strong
oncological benefit in less than 20% of the cases, underlining the lack of accuracy of current selection processes.
Among baseline characteristics of primary tumors and
liver metastases, none appeared to be reliable for distinguishing these two groups. Only a positive nodal status
of the primary tumor and the size of liver metastases
when they were diagnosed were different between these
groups. However, due to large overlaps, these factors do
not appear as potentially usable exclusion criteria for
surgery. Furthermore, neither the AFC score nor the
mCRS was found to discriminate between LTS and ER
patients. When we compared the ER group with the patients with a DFS > 3 years, in whom a plausible surgical
benefit could have been obtained, the rate of a positive
nodal status of the primary tumor and the number of
liver metastases at preoperative staging were significantly
increased in the ER group. Interestingly, although the
AFC score was not discriminating between these groups,
the mCRS was significantly increased in ER patients as
compared with the patients with a DFS > 3 years.
This work had several limitations. Mainly, this is a
limited retrospective series, including highly selected
patients. In addition, similarly to most of the studies in
patients with NCRNNELM [2, 3, 7, 27, 28], the present
series included a majority of patients with breast cancer
liver metastases. However, no significant difference was
observed when we compared postoperative outcomes in
patients with breast and non-breast NCRNNELM.
In conclusion, although our overall results confirm
that surgery could be effective in some patients with
NCRNNELM, they also highlight the lack of accurate

selection criteria for personalized therapeutic decision
making. In this series, the previously described AFC
score was unable to preoperatively identify the individual
patients who would benefit from surgery. At the same
time, a simple clinical score adapted from a prognostic
model in CRLM showed some promising prognostic
value, suggesting that similar biomarkers could be relevant
in liver metastases, irrespective of the primary tumor origin. Taken together, these results underline the need for
translational research to identify new biomarkers of individual tumor behavior in patients with NCRNNELM.
