Abstract
Background: Hepatitis E is a major public health problem in the developing countries. Pathogenesis of hepatitis E virus
(HEV) infection is poorly understood.
Methods: This case-control study included 124 Hepatitis E patients (46 acute and 78 recovered), 9 with prior exposure to
HEV and 71 anti-HEV negative healthy controls. HEV induced CTL response by Elispot, cytokines/chemokines quantitation
by Milliplex assay and peripheral CD4+ & CD8+ T cell frequencies by flow cytometry were assessed.
Results: Among the patient categories, HEV specific IFN-c responses as recorded by Elispot were comparable. Comparisons
of cytokines/chemokines revealed significantly high levels of IL-1a and sIL-2Ra during acute phase. Circulating peripheral
CD4/CD8+ T-cell subsets in acute and recovered individuals were comparable compared to controls, while among patient
categories CD8+T cell subset was significantly higher in recovered individuals.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that IL-1a and sIL-2Ra play a role in the pathogenesis of acute Hepatitis E infection. Lack
of robust HEV ORF2-specific CTL response in the peripheral blood of HEV infected patients during the acute and recovered
phases of the disease may be associated with involvement of innate immune cells/localization of the immune events at the
site of infection.

Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of epidemic and
sporadic acute hepatitis that is usually mild and self-resolving with
the highest disease attack rate among young adults. However, a few
patients develop severe disease manifesting as fulminant hepatic
failure (FHF) [1]. Though the overall case-fatality rate of acute
hepatitis E is 0.5–1%, it may reach up to 20–25% among pregnant
women [2].The disease severity in pregnant women might be
attributed to altered immune responses in these patients [3].
HEV specific IgM and IgG antibodies appear to have
neutralizing activity [4], their longevity and exact role in
protection against HEV re-infection remains unclear [5].Significantly higher anti-HEV IgM and IgG titers in the FHF patients
bled within 2 weeks of onset of jaundice irrespective of the
outcome of the disease, suggested the involvement of humoral
immune response in HEV pathogenesis [6].
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) serve as a reservoir
for other hepatotropic viruses that cause chronic infection, such as
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [7,8,9].
Detection of HEV RNA in the absence of replication in PBMCs of
acute hepatitis E patients indicated that these cells are not the site for
replication of HEV [10]. Chandra et al reported HEV RNA
positivity in the sera after normalization of transaminases, suggesting
that liver injury is independent of viral replication [11]. Recent studies
have indicated the involvement of expression profiles of peripheral
immune cells in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis E [12,13].
Previous studies have shown correlation between IFN- c release
by Elispot and severity in resolving acute hepatitis E patients [14].
However, comparative evaluation of the cytokine/chemokine
profiles of the immune cells and the role of antigen-specific CTLs
during HEV infection/recovery still remains to be explored.
The present study attempts to understand the involvement of
host factors: HEV specific cytokine/chemokine profiles, T cell
response in terms of IFN-c release directed against ORF2 protein
of HEV by Elispot assay and peripheral CD4+ & CD8+ T cells
frequencies, during the acute and the recovery phases of selflimiting acute hepatitis E.
Methods
Study population
The study population of 204 included (1) Acute viral hepatitis
(AVH-E) group: 46 patients (2) Recovered group: 78 patients (3)
Exposed group: 9 individuals and (4) Control group: 71 healthy
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31822

individuals, termed as HEV naive (Table 1).The diagnosis of
hepatitis E was based on the presence of IgM antibodies to
hepatitis E virus (IgM-anti-HEV) as detected by ELISA [15]. The
patients were classified as acute viral hepatitis (AVH-E) based on
the standard clinical and biochemical criteria [6]. Briefly, patients
presenting with icterus, dark-colored urine, elevated alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) (normal level, 4–40 IU/l) and/or bilirubin levels (.1 mg/ml) in the serum and/or presence of bile salts
and pigments in the urine were considered to have hepatitis. The
recovered individuals had a previous history of acute hepatitis E.
The patients were enrolled from different hepatitis outbreaks in
the state of Maharashtra, Western India. The exposed group
consisted of healthy persons who could not recall a history of an
illness resembling viral hepatitis indicating that they had been
exposed to HEV in the past. They were positive for IgG anti-HEV
antibodies. The patient and the exposed group population
negative for HBsAg, anti-HIV, IgM anti-HAV, anti-HCV
antibodies were only included in the study. The Control group/
HEV naive consisted of age- and sex-matched apparently healthy
individuals negative for HBsAg, anti-HIV, anti-HCV, IgM/IgG
anti-HEV and IgM anti-HAV antibodies. None of the patients was
having any past history of chronic liver disease, severe systemic
illness or was undergoing therapy at the time of sampling. Due to
logistic problems the quantity of blood sample drawn in most of
the patients was small. Hence, the subjects assessed for cytokine
assay, T cell frequencies and Elispot were not necessarily the same.
The samples from the exposed group were processed only for
Elispot assay. This study was approved by the Institutional
‘‘Ethical Committee for Research on Humans’’ and written
consent was obtained from all the participants involved in the
study.
Serological & Molecular assays
Blood samples were collected in K3 EDTA tube and plasma
was separated. All samples were screened in ELISA for the
presence of IgM antibodies against hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV
IgM; Hepavase A-96, General Biologicals Corp., Taiwan),
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg; Surase B-96, General
Biologicals), IgM antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc IgM; Anticorase B-96, General Biologicals), antibodies to
hepatitis C (anti-HCV; Ortho HCV 3.0, Ortho Clinical
Diagnostics, USA), antibodies to HIV-1 (INSTITM HIV-1
antibody Test Kit, Biological Laboratories Inc, Richmond, British
Columbia, Canada), anti-HEV IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA
based on the use of recombinant ORF2 antigen (rORF2p) [15]
and serum alanine amino transferase levels (ALT; Span Diagnostics, India). The end points of serum ALT levels, IgM and IgG
levels were determined as previously described [16].
Preparation of ORF2 protein
Complete ORF2 gene (1983 bp:5147–7129 nt, corresponding
to 660 aa) from genotype 1 of HEV was cloned in pVAX1;
56 kDa. This ORF2 protein (rORF2p) was expressed in
baculovirus system (56 kDa) [17,18].It was purified by HPLC
and was used in all the assays [6].
Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs)
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from
fresh blood collected in K3 EDTA tube by Ficoll-Hypaque density
gradient centrifugation. Cells were re-suspended in RPMI 1640
medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) supplemented with 2 mmol/
l L-Glutamine, 1 mmol/l sodium pyruvate and 20 ug/ml of
gentamycin.
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent spot (Elispot) assay
Hepatitis E virus specific Elispot assay for IFN-c release was
done in 27 acute HEV patients, 22 recovered from Hepatitis E, 9
exposed individuals to Hepatitis E(IgG anti HEV +ve) and 18
Control/HEV naı¨ve individuals (IgG anti HEV 2ve) as previously
described [19].Briefly, 96-well nitrocellulose bottomed plates
(MAIPS 4510; Millipore Bedford, MA) were coated with
recombinant anti-human IFN-c mAb (Mab Tech, Sweden) at a
concentration of 5 mg/ml and kept at 4uC overnight. The plates
were washed with wash buffer (phosphate buffered saline, (PBS)
containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20) and blocked with fetal bovine
serum (FBS) for 2–4 h at 37uC. To estimate the number of HEVspecific IFN-c secreting spot forming cells (SFCs), 16105 PBMCs/
well were stimulated with rORF2p (20 mg/ml). In the control
wells, cells were stimulated with 10 ug/ml of Phytohemagglutinin
A (PHA-A) (Sigma, USA)/medium alone. After incubation at
37uC, the plates were washed with PBS and with wash buffer.
Biotinylated anti-human IFN-c mAb (Mab Tech, Sweden) at a
concentration of 2 mg/ml was added. After washing, avidin-bound
horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories, USA),
containing 0.1% Tween 20, was added and kept at room
temperature. This was followed by the addition of the AEC
substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After drying, SFCs were counted
in ELISPOT reader (Carl zeiss, Germany) using KS ELISPOT
software and was expressed per 105 cells. The cutoff level of SFCs
was calculated as the average number of SFCs in the negative
control wells. Assays with high background or with no PHA
response were excluded. Normalization of the data was done by
subtracting the number of spot forming cells in unstimulated wells
from the antigen stimulated wells. The values are expressed as
median (range).The patient categories were compared with the
Table 1. Clinical characteristics of patients and controls enrolled in the study.

HEV naı¨ve group. Statistical analyses were carried out in the data
after normalization.
Stimulation of PBMCs and cytokine assay
Cytokine assay was carried out in 24 well plates in 44 AVH-E
patients, 23 recovered individuals and 16 controls/HEV naı¨ve as
previously described [6]. Cytokine levels were measured from
culture supernatants for each sample using a Milliplex cytokine
assay (Millipore Billerica, MA).
Milliplex Analysis
Cytokine concentrations in the rORF2p stimulated culture
supernatants were determined using Milliplex immunoassay Kit
(Millipore Billerica, MA). The assay was performed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions as reported [18]. Eight cytokines
(IL1a, IL1RA, sIL-2Ra, IL-12p70, TNF-b, IFN-a, MIP-1, IL-8)
were estimated.
CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell enumeration by flow cytometry
Freshly drawn 100 ul peripheral blood was stained with antihuman CD4+ T (FITC) and CD8+ T (FITC) in 46 AVH-E, 78
recovered individuals and 71 controls/HEV naı¨ve along with
appropriate isotype controls (ebiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA)
and were analyzed as previously described [19]. For each
experiment 10,000 events were acquired within the lymphocyte
gate and were analyzed using the Cell Quest software (Becton
Dickinson, USA). Results are expressed as median (range).
Statistical analysis
The levels of cytokines and chemokines were analysed after log
transformation and a value of 0.1 pg/ml was used in case of
undetectable concentration in the tested samples. Mann–Whitney
U-test was used for numerical data. Correlation between
quantitative parameters was analyzed using Spearman rank
correlation coefficient test. For all analyses, a p-value #0.05
derived from a two-tailed test was considered to be significant. All
statistical analysis was performed with SPSS11.0 software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
rORF2p specific CTL activation in Elispot
To characterize the antigen-specific T-cell response to HEV, we
determined the frequency of IFN-c-producing T cells in response
to rORF2p by ELISPOT assay (Figure 1). In control/HEV naı¨ve
group (IgM/IgG anti HEV negative) (n = 18), IFN-c responses in
unstimulated, rORF2p and PHA stimulated cells were 0(0–4), 1(0–
25) and 10-4(12–248) SFC/105 cells respectively (Figure 1A). The
corresponding figures in the exposed group (IgM anti-HEV
negative and IgG anti HEV positive) (n = 9) were 0(0–6), 4(0–16)
and 107(10–196) respectively (Figure 1B).
In AVH-E group (n = 27), IFN-c responses in unstimulated,
rORF2p and PHA stimulated cells were 28(1–195), 22(0.6–253)
and 92(11–284) SFC/105 cells respectively (Figure 1C).In the
recovered group (n = 22), the corresponding figures were 32(0–
208), 41(2–209) and 175(10–410) respectively (Figure 1D). After
normalization of the data, IFN-c responses in the rORF2p
stimulated cells of AVH-E patients and recovered individuals were
significantly higher compared to controls. Among the patient
categories HEV specific IFN-c responses were comparable. The
results are expressed as median (range) (Figure 2).
CTL response by Elispot was analyzed longitudinally in 6
patients at two time points, during the acute and recovery phase.
One of the patients had a fall; a rise was observed in another, while
in the rest 4, the SFC/105 cells were in the same range (data not
shown).
Peripheral T lymphocyte population in patients and
controls
The proportions of circulating peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells are expressed as percentage of gated lymphocytes. In the 71
controls/HEV naı¨ve, the median (range) of CD4+ & CD8+ T cells
were 36(10.3–59.5) and 23.3(11.2–80.8) respectively. Similarly, in
46 AVH-E & 78 recovered individuals, CD4+ T cells were
35.2(10.5–79.9) & 37.3(20.4–72.8) and CD8+ T cells were
24(11.7–42.5) and 27.5(13.4–52.9) respectively. CD4+ and
CD8+ T subsets were unchanged in AVH-E and recovered
individuals compared to the controls. Among the patient
categories, CD8+ T subset was significantly higher in recovered
individuals (p = 0.04).
Cytokine profiles during Hepatitis E infection and in
recovery
The levels of IL-1a, MIP-1a in AVH-E and MIP-1a in the
recovered group were significantly elevated compared to controls
(p,0.05 in each). Levels of IFN-a and TNF-b were significantly
lower in the AVH-E group and that of sIL-2Ra, IL-1RA and TNFb were lower in the recovered group in comparison to controls
(P,0.05 in each). The levels of IL-12p70 & IL-8 were comparable
in both the AVH-E & recovered groups, whereas sIL-2Ra, IL-1RA
in AVH-E and IL-1a levels in recovered group were comparable
with control. Comparison among the patient categories revealed
significantly higher levels of sIL-2Ra and IL-1a in AVH-E
(p = 0.0001 & 0.018 respectively) (Figure 3A, 3B & 3C).
Correlation of anti HEV IgM & IgG levels with CTL
response
Spearman analysis showed that for AVH-E patients, IFN-c
release by rORF2p in Elispot was negatively correlated with IgG
levels (r = 20.738, p = 0.015). No correlation of IgM anti-HEV
titers with IFN-c release by Elispot was recorded.
Discussion
The present study is a comprehensive report demonstrating the
nature of involvement of (a) recombinant ORF2 protein specific
CTL response (b) cytokine profiles directed against recombinant
ORF2 protein and (c) peripheral T lymphocytes in the
pathogenesis/recovery from acute hepatitis E.
The outcome of HEV infection is reported to be dependent on
both the T cell subsets and antigen non-specific inflammatory cells
recruited to the liver [12]. In our series, the percentage of CD4+ &
CD8+ T cells were unchanged in AVH-E and recovered
individuals compared to the controls. CD8+ T population was
significantly more in the recovered individuals compared to AVHE. Prabhu et al. showed the presence of more number of CD4+ T
cells in the liver of FHF caused by HEV when compared to that of
healthy individuals elucidating the role of CD4+ T cells in
providing help and activating cytotoxic T cells [20]. Trehanpati
et al. reported an increase in the proportion of CD8+ T cells in
AVH-E but no change in the CD4+ T cell compartment in
peripheral blood [13]. The difference in the results of these studies
may be related to large differences in sample size and the
difference in cluster of differentiation (CD) markers used.
The involvement of CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis and virus
clearance in acute infections with hepatitis A, hepatitis B and
hepatitis C virus has been well recognized [21,22,23]. Hence,

CTL responses directed against HEV protein was assessed to
understand its role in the host cell injury. Significantly high HEV
specific and robust nonspecific IFN-c producing T-cell response in
Elispot in AVH-E patients of current series suggests role of IFN-c
in the clearance of HEV infection. Diminished HEV specific and
robust nonspecific IFN-c-producing T-cell response in recovered
cases compared to controls makes its role unclear Further work is
needed to determine if this response involves CD4+ or CD8+

subsets (or both). IFN-c is the signature cytokine that enhances the
activity of NK cells. High levels of background IFN-c production
in the absence of HEV specific protein in both the patient
categories goes in parallel with the previous report of involvement
of innate mechanisms involving NK/NKT/T reg cells in the
pathogenesis of hepatitis E [24].
Wu et al. reported that acute hepatitis patients displayed a
detectable HEV specific T cell response, whose levels decreased
along with the decreasing titre of anti-HEV antibody and in
convalescence [14]. A study by Srivastava et al. reported a
heightened IgG response as assayed by B cell Elispot to be
associated with a more severe disease [25]. In the current series of
acute and recovered individuals, IgM levels did not have any
correlation with HEV specific CTL response; whereas IgG levels
of the acute patients were negatively correlated with the same. In
spite of the contradictory reports due to difference in assays, post
onset days of illness of study subjects, the involvement of IgG levels
in HEV pathogenesis cannot be overlooked. Similar findings were
reported by Husain et al. reporting increased frequency of
recombinant ORF2 protein specific IFN- c secreting cells in acute
hepatitis E patients compared to the controls elucidating reactivity
of T cells to the full length ORF2 protein [26].
Elevated serum levels of IL-1a and IL-1b have been correlated
with the impairment of hepatocytes, since they were reported to be
present only in the acute and not in the recovery phase of viral
hepatitis [27]. Similarly, increased IL-1a levels in AVH-E vs
recovery in the current series of patients and increased levels of IL1b and TNF-a in AVH-E and recovered cases in our previous
report [16] suggest their probable role in the pathogenesis of
hepatitis and hepatocytic injury. In acute hepatitis patients, high
levels of sIL-2Ra returning to normal during resolution has been
suggested to be associated with the diagnosis of inflammation in
hepatitis, a process in which interleukin 2 may participate [28].
With our data of higher levels of sIL-2Ra in AVH-E patients vs.
recovery, its use as a marker of inflammation in hepatitis could
further be ascertained with supporting data from patients with
fulminant hepatitis E.
In conclusion, our data suggest that there is no robust HEV
ORF2-specific T cell response in the peripheral blood of HEV
infected patients during the acute and recovered phases of the
disease. Further work assessing HEV specific CTL responses in the
peripheral blood of acute, recovered individuals and at the site of
infection of fulminant hepatic failure patients by longitudinal study
at different post onset days of illness remains to be elucidated.
