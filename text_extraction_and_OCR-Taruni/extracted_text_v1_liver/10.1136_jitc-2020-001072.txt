ABSTRACT
Background Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint 
inhibitor (ICI) is a promising treatment for unresectable 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, whether ICIs 
would have the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation 
and the necessary of nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) 
prophylaxis are still unclear. We aimed to investigate the 
role of NUCs prophylaxis in HBV-infected patients who 
underwent ICIs treatment.
Methods The study was a retrospective prospective 
design to review and follow-up consecutive 62 patients 
with chronic hepatitis B or resolved HBV infection who had 
received ICIs treatment for the unresectable HCC. Of them, 
60 patients with documented baseline serum HBV DNA 
value were classified into three categories according to the 
baseline HBV viral load and the status of antiviral therapy 
before ICI treatment. The clinical status, including tumor 
response, viral kinetics and liver function, was recorded 
and investigated.
Results No HBV reactivation occurred in the 35 patients 
with HBV DNA ≤100 IU/mL on NUCs therapy. Of the 19 
patients with HBV DNA >100 IU/mL who started NUCs 
simultaneously with ICI treatment, none encountered HBV 
reactivation during the immunotherapy. Of the six HBV 
patients without NUCs treatment, three had a greater 
than 1 log decrease in HBV viral load, and one maintained 
his serum HBV DNA in undetectable status during ICI 
treatment. Eventually, one out of six experienced HBV 
reactivation after 9 weeks of ICI treatment.
Conclusion No patients on antiviral therapy developed 
HBV reactivation, and one out of six not receiving antiviral 
therapy had HBV reactivation. HBV viral load higher 
than 100 IU/mL is safe and not a contraindication for ICI 
treatment for HCC, if NUCs can be coadministrated.
INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 
fifth most common cancer and the secondleading cause of cancer-related death worldwide that constitutes 854000 new cases and 
810000 deaths per year.1 Hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) infection is common across the world, 
and globally approximate 54% of HCCs are 
attributed to chronic HBV infection.2
 In 
Asian-Pacific region, chronic hepatitis B is 
endemic and plays much more important 
role in the development of HCC and its 
complications.3 4 Despite the improvement in 
surveillance and treatment of viral hepatitis, 
many patients still present with or progress to 
unresectable or advanced disease and require 
systemic therapy.2
 Immunotherapies with 
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such 
as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the antiprogrammed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibodies, 
are recently emerged, effective immunotherapeutic agents for HCC.5–7
HBV reactivation is defined as the abrupt 
reappearance or rise of HBV DNA in the 
serum of a patient with resolved or inactive 
chronic HBV infection.8
 This event can be 
triggered by the administration of either anticancer agents, immunosuppressive or biological therapies.8–11 CD8 T cell exhaustion 
due to PD-1 upregulation is characterized 
in chronic viral infection, including chronic 
hepatitis B (CHB).12 13 Previous studies 
suggested that blockade of the axis of PD-1 
and its ligand (PD-L1) could restore anti-HBV 
T cell responses, which could enhance the 
control of HBV.14–16 In CheckMate-040 trial, 3 
of 51 HBV-HCC patients (6%) presented a 1 
log decline of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) 
level during nivolumab therapy.5
 However, 
two case reports described HBV reactivation in patients received ICI treatment for 
lung cancer.17 18 Currently, most of the clinical trials, including CheckMate-040 and 
Keynote-224, request CHB patients should 
be on nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) treatment and had a HBV viral load <100IU/mL 
before receiving their first dose of ICI treatment.5 6 So far, whether immunotherapy with 
ICIs would have the risk of HBV reactivation 
and the necessary of NUCs prophylaxis are 
still unclear.2 11 19 In this study, we aimed to

before the end of June 2019 were retrospective 
reviewed of medical records. Since July 2019, the rest 
of the patients were recruited in an immunotherapy 
biomarker study and had prospectively observational 
monitoring.
The diagnosis of HCC was according to the AASLD 
treatment guidelines.20 ICI treatment was administered for HCC patients with intermediate stage after 
locoregional treatment failure by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), or advanced stage with intolerable adverse events or treatment failure to sorafenib, 
or deteriorated liver reserves beyond Child-Pugh class 
A so that target therapy was not approved based on the 
reimbursement criteria of National Health Insurance 
(NHI) in Taiwan.21 22 All the enrolled patients did 
not receive other locoregional therapies, including 
TACE, during the ICI treatment. According to their 
baseline HBV viral load and the status of antiviral 
therapy before ICI treatment, the enrolled patients 
were classified into three categories, including 
(1) patients with HBV DNA ≤100 IU/mL on NUCs 
therapy (fulfilled CheckMate-040 and Keynote-224 
HBV criteria),5 6 (2) patients with HBV DNA >100 IU/
mL on NUCs therapy and (3) patients with HBV but 
without receiving NUCs therapy throughout the ICI 
treatment because of not fulfilling the NUCs reimbursement criteria for CHB in NHI, Taiwan.
Treatment and outcome assessment
ICIs were prescribed according to the recommended 
dosage and safety information (2–3mg/kg, every 2 weeks 
for nivolumab and every 3 weeks for pembrolizumab).5 6
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE; V.5.0) was applied for the 
assessment of therapeutic safety. Clinical evaluation with 
Child-Pugh class, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, hemogram, serum chemistry and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 
level were performed every 2–3 weeks during the treatment. Clinical tumor response was assessed by RECIST 
V.1.1 based on contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan or 
MRI.23 The image examinations were carried out every 
6–8 weeks during ICIs treatment.22 The study complied 
with Taiwan NHI regulation; HBV viral load monitoring 
was done every 6 months while on NUCs treatment. For 
patients on ICI treatment without NUCs, HBV viral loads 
were monitored every 2–3 months in this study. Additional 
HBV DNA test was performed if a serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level exceeded 100U/L with suspicion 
of HBV reactivation.24 25 According to this guidance, 45 
had follow-up HBV DNA values.
Definitions
HBV reactivation was defined as a 10-fold increase in HBV 
DNA from baseline, or reappearance of HBsAg in HBsAgnegative case, or HBV DNA from undetectable to higher 
than 1000IU/mL.11 26 Hepatitis related to HBV reactivation was defined as a threefold or greater increase in 
serum ALT that exceeds 100U/L.24 25 The upper normal 
limit of ALT was 40U/L. The ALT flare was defined as a 
rise in ALT>5fold upper limit of normal (ULN), which 
is classified as grade III hepatic toxicity by CTCAE 5.0 
grading system. The ALBI score was calculated using the 
formula: (log10 bilirubin x 0.66) + (albumin x 0.085), 
where bilirubin is in umol/L and albumin in g/L; and 
the cut points of the ALBI grade were based on previous 
report.27
Virological and biochemical tests
Serum HBV DNA level was measured by quantitative PCR 
method (Roche COBAS 6800 HBV test) with the lower 
detection limit of 10IU/mL. Serum biochemistry tests 
were measured by systemic multiauto-analyzer (Technicon SMAC, Technicon Instruments, Tarrytown, New 
York, USA). Serum AFP level was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Elecsys AFP Assay, 
Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with clinically 
reportable range from 0.908 to 1 998 000ng/mL.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as median (range), 
while categorical variables were analyzed as frequency 
and percentages. The Pearson X2 analysis or Fisher’s 
exact test was used to compare categorical variables, while 
the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was applied

considered statistically significant. All statistical analyzes 
were performed using the Statistical Package for Social 
Sciences (SPSS V.17.0 for Windows, SPSS).
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics of the study cohort
The patients were classified into three categories, 
including HBV DNA ≤100IU/mL on NUCs therapy, 
HBV DNA >100IU/mL on NUCs therapy and HBV 
without NUCs therapy. For the six patients without NUCs 
treatment, four had HBV viral load less than 2000IU/
mL; the other two had elevated HBV viral loads, but their 
ALT levels were less than 2 folds of ULN; which were not 
fulfilled the regulation of Taiwan NHI for NUCs treatment. No significant differences of liver reserves could 
be identified between these three groups. The patients 
with HBV DNA ≤100IU/mL on antiviral therapy were 
significantly older (median age: 63.4 vs 58.0 and 56.5 
years old, p=0.019) compared with the others. Besides, 
these patients had smaller tumor size (4.0 vs 8.7 and 
8.8cm, p<0.001), lower serum level of AFP (373.2 vs

1992.6 and 3082.2ng/mL, p=0.028); and more of them 
had experienced surgical resection for HCC before ICI 
treatment (62.9% vs 21.1% and 50.0%, p=0.013). Generally, most of the patients (80%) were at BCLC stage C. 
The majority (73.3%) of them was within Child-Pugh 
class A; but 65.0% was classified beyond ALBI grade 1. 
Two patients presented with positive anti-HCV antibody. 
Both their HCV viral loads were undetectable throughout 
the ICI treatment. The median cycles and duration of ICI 
treatment were five cycles (1–35) and 2.1 months (0.5–
24.5) for patients with HBV DNA ≤100IU/mL on NUCs; 
five cycles (1 – 23) and 2.3 months (0.2–15.0) for HBV 
DNA >100IU/mL on NUCs; nine cycles (4 – 19) and 5.1 
months (1.6–13.6) for patients not on NUCs, respectively. 
In addition, the follow-up period of the three patient 
groups was 5.4 months (0.5–25.7), 3.9 months (0.2–17.9) 
and 10.4 months (4.0–24.8), respectively. The detailed 
baseline characteristics were presented in table 1.
Viral kinetics of HBV during ICI treatment
In patients with HBV DNA ≤100IU/mL on NUCs therapy, 
no case experienced HBV reactivation during the ICIs 
treatment. Of the 19 patients with HBV DNA >100IU/
mL who started antiviral therapy simultaneously with ICI 
treatment, seven cases had longer survival to monitor their 
HBV DNA after NUCs treatment (figure 1A). Only one 
experienced suboptimal suppression by tenofovir with 
low HBV viremia but without ALT elevation or adverse 
events (details were presented in figure 2A); the others 
had a substantial decrease in HBV viral load during the 
follow-up period (table 2).
Of the six patients without antiviral treatment, five had 
detectable HBV viral load at baseline. Interestingly, three 
patients developed a notable decrease in HBV viral load 
during ICI treatment; and one maintained his serum HBV 
DNA in undetectable level during ICI treatment. Eventually, one patient experienced HBV reactivation with a 
>10fold increase in HBV DNA level and ALT flare after 
9 weeks of ICI treatment (figure 1B). After HBV reactivation, his HBV was controlled by tenofovir treatment 
and did not lead to HBV-related liver failure (table 3 and 
figure 2B). On the other hand, case N6 died of rapid 
tumor progression, and we could not get the followed 
data of HBV viral load.
Status of hepatitis during ICI treatment
Twenty-three patients (38.3%) experienced ALT>100U/L 
during the follow-up period. Of them, 10 patients had 
ALT flare (>5fold ULN), but only four had more than 
10-fold ULN ALT increase (5.7% and 10.5% in HBV 
DNA ≤100IU/mL and HBV DNA >100IU/mL on 
NUCs patients) (table 2). As presented in table 4, tumor 
progression is the main cause of ALT elevation in each 
group of patients. Two patients on NUCs therapy (one 
with baseline HBV DNA ≤100IU/mL and the other 
one>100IU/mL) had developed immune-related adverse

event (iRAE) hepatitis. The incidence of iRAE hepatitis 
was not significantly different among the three groups. 
Of the six HBV patients without NUCs treatment, two 
developed ALT elevation >100U/L during ICI therapy. 
One was resulted from HBV reactivation, and the other 
one was attributed to tumor progression.
DISCUSSION
This is the largest real-world cohort from Asian patients 
with HBV-related HCC treated by ICIs till now. In our 
cohort, HBV reactivation developed in only one patient 
who did not receive antiviral agent during ICI therapy; 
and was controlled by tenofovir treatment that did not 
lead to HBV-related liver failure. Otherwise, no patients 
with ongoing NUCs suffered from noteworthy HBV reac-
tivation during ICI treatment; even their baseline HBV 
DNA levels were higher than 100IU/mL.
For patients with HBV-related HCC, HBV reactivation 
and its subsequent morbidity were identified as poor 
prognostic factors of the overall survival.28 According 
to previous studies, the incidence of HBV reactivation 
ranges from 4% to 67% in patients with HBV-related 
HCC undergoing chemotherapy; and the contributed 
mortality rate was up to 18%.29 30 Apart from the direct 
cause of death, the scheduled treatment to HCC would 
be delayed or premature terminated due to deteriorated 
liver function by HBV reactivation that would also have 
impacts on the prognosis.31 32 For patients who received 
hepatectomy or loco-regional therapies for HCC, HBV 
reactivation was also reported and identified in relation 
to the prognosis.33–35 However, the data regarding to the 
kinetics of HBV viral loads during ICI therapy for HCC 
were still limited.
In patients with chronic hepatitis B, the upregulated 
inhibitory receptors on the CD8 T cells limit their defen-
sive function and lead to the exhausted phenotype.13
PD-1 is the most expressed inhibitory receptor, especially 
on the intrahepatic HBV-specific T cells.36 37 Blockage of 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could restore not only antitumor 
but also antiviral T cell function then help to suppress 
HBV viral load.12 37 According to the recent phase 1b 
study, a single dose of nivolumab at 0.3mg/kg could lead 
to HBsAg decline in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis 
B.38 Despite the lack of data to support HBsAg decline 
in our study, we still demonstrated three out of six cases 
had substantial decline in HBV DNA and additional one 
case maintained his HBV viral load in undetectable status 
during ICI therapy among patients who did not receive 
NUCs treatment. These findings may imply the poten-
tial role of ICI in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. 
However, even under NUCs treatment, a more than 1 log 
increase in HBV DNA during nivolumab treatment was 
reported in 11% (5/47) of HBV-related HCC patients in 
the Asian cohort of checkmate 040.39 In spite of that, their 
peak HBV viral load were all less than 2000IU/mL and no 
HBV-related adverse events were reported. In our cohort, 
presence of low HBV viremia was observed in one patient

during tenofovir treatment which did not lead to ALT 
elevation or adverse events. According to AASLD (American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) guideline, 
change NUCs is not required as it did not meet the definition of antiviral drug resistance (1 log increase in HBV 
DNA).11 In addition to the previous case reports,17 18 40 a 
recent Chinese study demonstrated that 6 of 114 (5.3%) 
HBsAg-positive patients with various cancers developed 
HBV reactivation during anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, but 
no HBV-related fatal events occurred.41 Our real-world 
data also demonstrated that HBV reactivation would 
occur in one out of six patients who did not receive preemptive anti-viral treatment. Accordingly, we still have to 
keep awareness of HBV reactivation during ICI treatment 
for HBV-HCC.42
In checkmate-040 and Keynote-224 trials, patients were 
required to receive effective anti‐viral therapy and had a 
viral load <100IU/mL before initiating ICI treatment.5 6
In the real life, however, ICIs would be delivered to more 
complex populations of patients than those of clinical 
trials that raise a question to the necessity of keeping low 
viral load before ICI therapy. Our data suggested that 
HBV viral load higher than 100IU/mL is safe and not a 
contraindication for ICI treatment for HCC, if NUCs can 
be coadministrated. By this way, none developed HBV 
viral load increase during the treatment course.
Although our data supported the feasibility of administering anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with HCC and HBV, 
the optimal use of NUCs remains uncertain. Whether 
patients at low risk of HBV reactivation may be monitored rather than receive prophylaxis in this setting, and 
an optimal threshold of HBV viral load that ICIs can be 
safely initiated without NUCs required further studies to 
determine.
There are several limitations in this study. First, this study 
only enrolled patients from a single hospital. However, 
our hospital is the main leading tertiary medical center 
in Taiwan. The information bias would be ameliorated 
by regular clinical assessment. Besides, it is so far the 
largest real-world HBV-HCC cohort that investigated the 
viral kinetics of HBV during ICI treatment. Second, the 
serum level of HBsAg was not frequently rechecked in our 
patients during ICI treatment according to the reimbursement criteria of NHI in Taiwan. Third, no ideal control 
arm could be designed in this study. For sorafenib-failed 
HCC patients, sorafenib on treatment group could not 
serve as control. For patients who received ICIs as first-line 
therapy, sorafenib on treatment patients were also not suitable as a control group because the pharmacologic difference between sorafenib and ICIs. The ideal control group 
should be HCC patients with serum HBV DNA >100IU/
mL who received ICI treatment after sorafenib failure or 
intolerance but was prohibited to use NUCs throughout the 
treatment. However, it is not ethical for this design. Forth, 
the risk of HBV reactivation might be underestimated 
because some patients only received very few cycles of ICIs 
and experienced early tumor progression and mortality. 
In our study, 15 did not have follow-up HBV DNA values; 
including nine patients did not experience ALT elevation 
during ICIs treatment; and the other six patients met early 
tumor progression. The risk of HBV reactivation might be 
underestimated in these cases. Finally, the antiviral agents 
prescribed to our patients were not consistent. Most of the 
patients (72.2%) on antiviral therapy were prescribed with 
entecavir; and the others used tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir alafenamide. However, all these NUCs 
belong to high potency antiviral agents that could suppress 
high HBV viral loads.43 44
In conclusion, no patients on antiviral therapy (regardless of HBV viral load at baseline) developed HBV reactivation, and one out of six not receiving NUCs had HBV 
reactivation. Patients with HBV viral load higher than 
100IU/mL could safely receive ICI treatment under the 
protection of NUCs treatment.
