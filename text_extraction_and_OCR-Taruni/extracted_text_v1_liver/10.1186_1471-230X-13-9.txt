Abstract
Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is identified as a negative prognostic indicator in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), though the basis for this is unknown.
Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of 191 HCC patients treated at the
University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) with orthotopic liver transplantation between 1998–2008. Clinical
characteristics were compared between patients with and without DM prior to liver transplantation and logistic
regression analyses were conducted to assess the effect of DM on clinical outcomes including vascular invasion.
Results: Eighty-four of 191 (44%) transplanted patients had DM at time of transplantation. An association of DM
with invasive disease was found among transplanted HCC patients where histologically confirmed macrovascular
invasion was found in 20.2% (17/84) of diabetics compared to 9.3% of non-diabetics (10/107) (p=0.032). This
difference also remained significant when adjusting for tumor size, number of nodules, age, obesity and etiologic
risk factors in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR=3.2, p=0.025).
Conclusions: DM is associated with macrovascular invasion among a cohort of transplanted HCC patients.
Keywords: Diabetes mellitus, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Vascular invasion
Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer
related death worldwide [1]. The incidence in the United
States has tripled over the past three decades [2] and is
estimated to increase further over the next two decades
largely due to the increasing prevalence of hepatitis C
infection [3-5]. Established risk factors for HCC include
chronic viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse include tobacco
smoking [6], non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [7],
autoimmune hepatitis [8], obesity [9], aflatoxin exposure
[10], and diabetes mellitus (DM) [11-13].
There is evidence to support a role for DM in the
development and progression of HCC. An association
between DM and HCC has been demonstrated by population based cohort studies of diabetic patients [11-13]
and case–control studies of HCC patients [14-16]. DM
negatively impacts survival in early stage HCC patients
undergoing resection and other local treatments [17-20]
but there is limited data on the impact of DM in the setting of transplanted HCC patients and little is known
about the mechanism by which diabetes causes decreased
survival. The current study examines a prospectively collected cohort of transplanted HCC patients. As all patients
had complete tumor pathologic analysis we focused on
pathologic features that might account poorer prognosis
in HCC with DM.
Methods
This study was approved by the University of Rochester
Institutional Review Board (IRB) and is a retrospective
analysis of a prospectively collected database. HCC
patients who received cadaveric liver transplantation at
the University of Rochester medical center (URMC) between January 1998 and December 2008 were identified
through the prospectively collected solid organ transplant

database. (n=191) Criteria for transplantation included absence of overt tumor thrombus and tumor metastasis, adequate physical health and general functional status, and
adequate social support. All patients listed for liver transplantation at URMC are prospectively followed as part of
the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) program
eligibility requirements. Patients are entered into this
database at the time transplantation occurs. Baseline
demographic data, date of HCC diagnosis, past medical
history, laboratory data, imaging information and explant
pathologic data are entered at the time of transplantation.
Patients were considered to have alcohol related cirrhosis
as an etiologic risk factor if there was a history of at least
3 alcoholic beverages per day for a minimum of 6 months.
Post-transplant laboratory data, imaging data and information pertaining to recurrence, survival, and cause of
death was collected and entered prospectively.
Pre-transplant DM status was determined by thorough
retrospective chart review. Post-transplant DM status
was not obtained or included in this analysis. Patients
were considered to have DM if the most recent history
and physical or office visit note prior to liver transplantation indicated regular use of oral hypoglycemic agents
or insulin as an outpatient or a history of DM in the past
medical history section.
Pathologic reporting on transplanted HCC is standardized and includes tumor size, grade, and comprehensive
information on macrovascular and microvascular invasion [21]. The number of tumors and tumor sizes were
obtained from pathology reports of surgical specimens.
Patients were considered to have NASH as a potential
etiologic risk factor only if there was clear evidence of
steatohepatitis on pathologic review of the explant
specimen. Macrovascular and microvascular invasion
were defined pathologically as previously described [22].
Macrovascular invasion was defined as vascular invasion
of either major portal veins or hepatic veins, and microvascular invasion as microscopic vascular invasion of the
tumor by small vessels within the parenchyma of the
liver. Body mass index (BMI) was prospectively collected
in all patients listed for transplant and the value was calculated based on height and weight at closest available
time-point prior to transplantation.
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were
summarized. Continuous variables were compared between non-diabetic and diabetic groups using t-tests.
Chi-square tests were used to compare the difference
between the two groups for categorical variables in each
cohort. Similarly, the associations between macrovascular
invasion and DM as well as post-transplant HCC recurrence and DM were evaluated in the transplant cohort
using multivariate logistic regressions. We included total
tumor diameter and multinodular disease in the multivariate models a-priori because they are known risk factors
for macrovascular invasion and HCC recurrence [23].
Variables including age, BMI and etiologic risk factors
(NASH, hepatitis C and hepatitis B) were included in the
multivariate models because univariate testing revealed
significant differences (p<0.05) in distribution between the
diabetic and non-diabetic cohorts. Mortality was estimated by the method of Kaplan-Meier and differences
between groups were compared using log-rank test in
each cohort. The transplant program at the University of
Rochester has a quality assessment committee. Cause of
death was determined by transplant committee multidisciplinary consensus in a prospective fashion when cause
of death was ascertainable. Hazard ratios for the relevant
clinical factors were assessed using multivariate Cox
regressions. Tests were two-sided with p<0.05 considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were carried
out using SPSS.
Results
Patient characteristics of transplanted cohort
The mean age of the transplanted population was 57.2 ±
8.6 and 85.9% were males (Table 1). The most common
underlying etiologic risk factors for cirrhosis in the transplanted cohort were chronic hepatitis C (54.5%), alcohol
abuse (24.6%), NASH (7.3%) and chronic hepatitis B (6.2%).
Less common risk factors included hemochromatosis
(9 patients), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (2 patients),
autoimmune hepatitis (2 patients), and biliary atresia
(1 patient). Five patients (2.6%) had more than one known
risk factor for cirrhosis.
Forty four percent (84/191) of the transplanted
patients had DM at the time of liver transplantation, and
of those with DM 11.9% (10/84) were diet controlled,
28.6% (21/84) used oral sulfonylurea medication, 11.9%
(10/84) used non-sulfonylurea medication, and 51.2%
(43/84) used insulin. There was a non-significant trend
toward increased prevalence of DM in more recent
years. Patients with DM were significantly older at the
time of liver transplantation (60.7 vs 55.0, p<0.0001),
and the prevalence of NASH was significantly higher in
DM patients (13.1% vs 2.8%, p=0.007) (Table 2). NonDM patients had a significantly higher INR at the time
of transplant (1.64 vs 1.37, p=0.001), and a higher
proportion of non-DM patients had chronic hepatitis C
(62.6% vs 44.0%, p=0.011). All other characteristics and
pre-transplant mean laboratory values were similar between patients with and without DM. Similar proportions of each group received pre-transplant treatment
such as chemoembolization, ablation, radiation and resection. In the transplanted cohort, the average total
tumor diameter was similar between non-DM and DM
patients (5.12 cm vs 5.81 cm, p=0.294), and similar proportions had a largest tumor that was >5cm in diameter
(16.8% of non-DM vs 23.8% DM, p=0.274). Fifty seven

percent of non-DM patients had multinodular disease
compared to 54.8% of patients with DM in the transplant population (p=0.771). Portal vein thrombosis was
found on histologic review of the liver explant in 13.1%
of non-diabetics and 22.6% of diabetics (p=0.122).
Impact of DM on HCC macrovascular invasion
The presence of DM was associated with a significantly
higher rate of histologically confirmed macrovascular in
the cohort of HCC patients receiving liver transplantation. Seventeen of 84 (20.2%) patients with DM had
histologic evidence of gross vascular invasion compared
to 10 of 107 (9.4%) non-DM patients (p=0.034). Only

one of these subjects had a suggestion of possible
macrovascular invasion on pre-transplant imaging. All
but one patient with evidence of macrovascular invasion
also had histologic evidence of microvascular invasion.
Thirty three patients (17.2%) had evidence of microvascular invasion without macrovascular invasion, and
the rate was equal in patients with and without DM
(17.9% vs 17.0%, p=0.82). In multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for total tumor diameter, number
of nodules, age, BMI>30 and etiologic risk factors the
presence of DM predicted for an increased risk of
macrovascular invasion (OR=3.2, p=0.025) (Table 2). If
NASH and BMI are taken out of the model DM remains
a significant independent predictor of macrovascular invasion (OR=3.19, p0.034). In addition we examined the
model with the additional interaction term of diabetes
and macrovascular invasion in the multivariate regression analysis and the effect was not significant
(p=0.6407). Therefore, we did not include the term in
our final model.
DM and post-transplant HCC recurrence
Post-transplant HCC recurrence among patients with a
history of DM was not significantly different than recurrence among patients without DM (28.6% (24/84) vs
19.6% (21/107), ( p=0.15). In multivariate logistic regression analysis including DM, vascular invasion, total tumor
diameter, number of nodules, age, and etiologic risk factors both microvascular invasion (OR3.7, p=0.009) and
macrovascular invasion (OR=32.5, p=<0.0001) but not
DM (OR=0.96, p=0.9) were associated with an increased
risk of post-transplant HCC recurrence (Table 3). The
highest rates of post-transplant recurrence were seen in
diabetic patients receiving insulin. Thirty percent (13/43)
of patients with DM receiving insulin recurred after
transplantation compared to 26.8% (11/41) of patients
with DM not receiving insulin and 19.6% (21/107) of
non-diabetics.
Impact of diabetes on survival in HCC
At the time of this analysis 50.3% (96/191) of the transplanted patients had died over a median follow up time
of 63.4 months. The median survival as estimated by
Kaplan meier survival analysis of the transplanted nonDM patients was 78.3 months compared to 31.1 months
in transplanted patients with DM (p=0.2). The cause of
death was known for 85 patients with most common
causes of death being recurrent HCC (41.2%, 35/85), infection (34.1%, 29/85) and cardiovascular disease (14.1%,
12/85). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis
including age, total tumor diameter, multinodular vs
uninodular disease and DM, macrovascular invasion
predicted for worse survival in the transplant cohort
(HR=4.7, p=<0.0001) (Table 4).
Discussion
This analysis suggests that DM is associated with an
increased incidence of histologically confirmed vascular
invasion in a cohort of HCC patients receiving liver
transplantation. DM remained a significant predictor of
macrovascular invasion when adjusting for tumor size,
number of nodules, age, obesity and etiologic risk factors
in multivariate analysis. Among pathologic features of
HCC macrovascular invasion is identified as the strongest
predictor of post-transplant recurrence of HCC and
survival, a finding consistent with previous reports [24,25].
A number of studies have evaluated the impact of DM
on HCC incidence, prognosis, and disease behavior.
Patients with DM have up to a 4-fold increased risk of
developing HCC compared to patients without DM
[11-16]. Studies of early stage HCC patients undergoing
liver resection demonstrated significantly decreased overall survival and recurrence free survival in diabetic
patients compared to non-diabetics by multivariate analysis [18,19]. Other studies in early stage HCC patients
with DM treated with resection have demonstrated
decreased survival in some subgroups [17,20].
The impact of DM on pathologic parameters has been
evaluated in colorectal cancer where it is suggested to
influence pathologic stage [26] and in breast cancer Table 3 Multivariate analysis of post-transplant HCC

where DM is associated with estrogen receptor negativity. [27,28] Macrovascular invasion [24] and microvascular invasion [25] have been identified as key negative
prognostic indicators in HCC, findings which were
echoed in the current study. Among patient and tumor
characteristics that could be indentified prior to transplantation tumor size and the presence of DM were
significantly associated with macrovascular invasion.
Macrovascular invasion was the strongest predictor of
disease recurrence following transplantation and significantly associated with risk of post-transplant death.
Several potential explanations can be offered regarding
the association between DM and HCC development and
progression. Stage migration, delayed diagnosis, or less
stringent screening may be factors although our analysis
showing equal waiting list times would refute this argument. DM may have a direct causative role in HCC development and progression possibly through promotion
of carcinogenesis, tumor growth, and invasiveness.
These direct effects may be mediated by alterations in
gene transcription induced by increased levels of glucose
[29], insulin, or counter-regulatory hormones such as
growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor. An
etiologic role for increased insulin levels is supported by
epidemiologic studies showing a higher rate of HCC
development in diabetic cirrhotics treated with insulin
compared to those treated with oral hypoglycemic
agents [30]. Also, diabetic patients may have alterations
in hepatocyte expression of surface receptors such as insulin receptor or insulin-like growth factor receptor that
increase susceptibility to unidentified tumor promoting
factors. Recent studies have demonstrated increased
expression and activity of ILGFR-1 in HCC tumors [31],
and inhibition of these receptors in animal models
results in decreased metastatic potential of HCC tumor
cell lines [32].
There are several limitations to this study. First the
presence of DM was determined based on medical history or medication use rather than by fasting glucose or
hemoglobin A1C measurement. Thus, the presence of
physiologic glucose intolerance is likely underestimated.
The lack of reliable data on the timing of DM onset
relative to diagnosis of cirrhosis and HCC hinder our
ability to confer a causal relationship. We were not able
to examine the potential impact of DM on histologic
grade or histologic grade as a potential confounder on
the relationship between DM and vascular invasion because histologic grade was not adequately captured in
this database. Also, this study was exploratory and hypothesis generating in nature and confined to a single
institution. It is possible that the observed associations
are due to chance. Confirmatory studies in larger
cohorts including multiple institutions are needed.
Given that this is a tertiary liver transplant referral
center there is potential for referral bias. Lastly, we did
not observe a significant difference in overall survival
although we do note a trend toward decreased survival
as indicated by the Kaplan meier estimates. Patients
with transplanted HCC die from causes other than
recurrent or uncontrolled HCC such as liver failure, infection, bleeding, and post-operative complications in
the setting of transplantation and there is considerable
variation in survival times as indicated by the large
standard deviations in mean survival times. It seems
likely that any direct effect of DM on HCC-related
mortality would require a larger cohort.
Conclusions
Despite the limitations this study offers evidence that
DM is associated with increased vascular invasion in
HCC. These novel findings, if confirmed, could have
clinical implications, and suggest clinicians may need to
consider the impact of DM when selecting patients for
liver transplantation. The incidence of glucose intolerance and DM in patients with liver cirrhosis is 60-80%
and 20-60% respectively [33] so it is imperative that we
understand how to best manage DM in the setting of
cirrhosis and HCC. The current study suggests further
research is required to better understand the interaction
between DM and disease pathogenesis and outcomes in
HCC.
