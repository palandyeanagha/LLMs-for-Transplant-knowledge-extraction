INTRODUCTION
Fulminant hepatic failure refers to a highly 
specific and fatal albeit rare clinical syndrome, 
manifesting as various abnormalities in liver 
function tests in a patient without pre-existing 
hepatic pathology. The deterioration in liver 
function is associated with coagulopathy and 
altered level of consciousness due to hepatic 
encephalopathy.1
 However, owing to the difficulty 
in the assessment of hepatic encephalopathy in 
young children and infants, presence of signs of 
encephalopathy is not a part of diagnostic criteria 
in children as opposed to adults.2,3 There is wide 
variation in the etiology leading to fulminant

ABSTRACT
Objectives: To determine etiologies, clinical presentations and outcomes of children with fulminant 
hepatic failure in the first liver transplant center of Pakistan.
Methods: It was a retrospective, observational study, conducted in Paediatric Gastroenterology Department 
of Shifa International Hospital. Patients between one month to 16 years were included who fulfilled the
Pediatric Acute Liver Failure study group (PALFSG) definition of acute liver failure as biochemical evidence
of liver injury with no known co-existing chronic liver disease, coagulopathy not corrected by vitamin K, 
an International Normalized Ratio (INR) greater than 1.5 if the patient has encephalopathy, or greater than 
2.0 if the patient does not have encephalopathy. The data collected was recorded on a self-constructed 
proforma after IRB approval.
Results: There were 28 patients in the study which ncluded 17 males and 11 females with a mean age of 
72.86±52.50 months. The most common etiologies were Hepatitis A (29%) in isolation or co-infection with 
Wilson Disease, typhoid fever. It was followed by seronegative hepatitis (29%). Majority (64%) had acute 
presentation (7 to 28 days), jaundice (82%) being the most common symptom. Severity of encephalopathy 
was significantly associated with outcome (p=0.02). There were 6 (21%) patients who succumbed to death.
Conclusions: The study highlights infective diseases as the predominant etiology causing fulminant liver 
failure in children. Our study highlights lower mortality in children

hepatic failure depending on the age group 
and geographical location, with the acute viral 
hepatitis4 and drugs among the leading causes.5
Other causes leading to fulminant hepatic failure 
include seronegative hepatitis, metabolic liver 
diseases, autoimmune hepatitis, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis and sepsis. Mortality 
associated with this devastating event is reported 
to be between 506 and 70 percent.7
Supportive treatment becomes less effective with 
advanced levels of coagulopathy and coma. Liver 
transplantation remains the only possible solution 
in these patients. The need to pick subtle signs and 
laboratory parameters pointing to a bad prognosis, 
the importance of early start of effective treatment 
and fewer management options for advanced 
cases calls for a standardized diagnostic and 
management strategy. Delayed referrals to centers 
equipped with the facility of hepatic transplantation 
is a major cause of increased mortality in these 
patients. It is particularly relevant in a country like 
Pakistan where, facilities catering the need for liver 
transplantation are also inadequate meet the need 
of the masses and concept of multidisciplinary 
team approach is yet developing.8
This study was conducted at the first Paediatric 
liver transplant center in Pakistan to investigate 
etiology, clinical presentation, and outcome after 
the diagnosis of fulminant hepatic failure was 
established.
METHODS
This observational retrospective study was 
conducted in Paediatric department of Shifa 
International Hospital. The hospital serves as a 
tertiary care hospital with services of Paediatric 
gastroenterology and Paediatric liver transplant. 
All patients who were referred to us between 
2012 to 2019 aged one month to 16 years who 
fulfilled the criteria for fulminant hepatic failure 
(FHF) were included in the study.
Patients with chronic liver diseases as suggested 
by history of symptoms more than six months 
and incomplete files were excluded from the 
study.9
 Pediatric Acute Liver Failure study groups 
(PALFSG) consensus definition of acute liver 
failure in children was used as inclusion criteria 
which states biochemical injury of liver injury 
with no known co-existing chronic liver disease, 
coagulopathy not corrected by vitamin K, an 
International Normalized Ratio (INR) greater 
than 1.5 if the patient has encephalopathy, or 
greater than 2.0 if the patient does not have 
encephalopathy.10 In children, the emphasis is 
on presence of significant coagulopathy in the 
absence of sepsis.11 FHF was further classified 
according to hyper-acute (less than seven days), 
acute (8 to 28 days) and subacute presentations (5 
to 12 weeks) depending on time taken to develop 
encephalopathy after onset of jaundice.
Data including age, gender, height, weight, 
liver function tests like alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT, Total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, coagulation profile prothrombin 
time (PT/INR), serum albumin and blood sugar 
levels were studied from the case files. Laboratory 
workup pertaining to specific etiologies like viral 
markers, serum ceruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary 
copper levels, metabolic workup, autoimmune 
liver profile, blood cultures and septic workup 
was also reviewed for each patient. Clinical 
presentation, grade of encephalopathy, time from 
first symptom to encephalopathy and etiology 
was taken into consideration. Patient’s outcome 
in terms of survival on supportive care, survival 
after liver transplant and/or death was recorded 
from patients file. Information was taken on selfdesigned questionnaire. (Ref: IRB # 1157-433-
2018, Dated: October 23, 2018) Institutional review 
board approval was taken. Data was reviewed on 
SPSS 23. Chi-square test was applied and a p value 
of <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.
RESULTS
There was a total of 28 patients, 17 males (61%) 
and 11 females (39%) included in the study who 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the 
participants was 72.86±52.50 months. The mean 
height was 97.95±32.82 cm and mean weight was 
19.09±11.12 kg. The various etiologies of hepatic 
failure are shown in Table-I.

The participants underwent a series of 
investigations. The maximum and minimum 
values of baseline liver function tests, random 
blood glucose and ammonia were also recorded 
and are shown in Table-II.
The mean prothrombin time was 36.93±30.52, 
INR was 3.33±2.33, total bilirubin 25.73±18.06, 
direct bilirubin was 17.61±14.14 mg/dl, mean 
albumin 2.84±0.53 g/l, alkaline phosphatase 
levels of 361.54±308.44 U/L. Mean ammonia 
levels were 204.41±109.57 mg/dl and blood 
sugar levels were 99.69±47.21 mg/dl. In the 
electrolytes, serum sodium was 125.95±34.23 
mEq/l, serum potassium 3.75±1.20 mEq/l, 
bicarbonate levels were 18.85±4.86 mEq/l and 
phosphorus was 3.26±1.94 mEq/l. Complete 
blood count profile of patients showed mean 
hemoglobin 9.87±1.79 g/dl, total leukocyte 
counts of 20082.14±14113.38, mean platelet count 
was 285188.68±195826.72.
The most common (64%) type of presentation 
was acute which ranges from seven to 28 days. 
This was followed by hyper acute presentation 
(22%) which was less than seven days and lastly, 
sub-acute presentation which presented in 5-12 
weeks (14%). The most common presenting 
symptom was jaundice (82%). The outcome of all 
the participants was also recorded. The outcome 
was divided into four categories: six patients 
(21%) Left against Medical Advice (LAMA), one 
patient (4%) was discharged on Request (DOR), 15 
(54%) patients survived while six patients (21%) 
succumbed to death. Amongst the 15 patients 
who had survived, 14 survived on supportive 
care and one patient underwent living donor 
liver transplant. The etiologies for patients who 
had died were also recorded. The most common 
etiology was Hepatitis A (33%). The other 
etiologies included Salmonella sepsis (17%), 
seronegative hepatitis (17%), malignancy (17%) 
and Hepatitis A co-infection with Wilson’s disease 
(17%). The patients in hepatic failure presented 
with varying degrees of encephalopathy. These 
degrees have been shown in Table-III.
The degrees of encephalopathy were 
significantly associated with outcomes (p=0.02). 
Patient mortality was also related to the level of 
hepatic dysfunction particularly dysfunction in 
synthesis of essential clotting factors. INR more 
than 4 was seen in 9 patients and 19 had INR less 
than 4 however, it was not found to be significantly 
associated with outcome. 
Chi-square test was also applied to determine 
if there were significant differences of outcomes 
as compared to levels of ammonia, bilirubin, 
albumin and ALT. They were all found to be nonsignificant.
DISCUSSION
Fulminant hepatic failure is an uncommon but 
serious condition with high mortality reported 
worldwide. Our study highlights diverse causes 
of fulminant hepatic failure presenting in 
Pakistan from the first Paediatric liver transplant 
facility. Acute viral hepatitis A (29%) is the 
leading cause of fulminant hepatic failure seen 
in our study. Co-infection with Hepatitis A and 
Wilson disease was seen in 2 (7%) patient and 
hepatitis A co-infection with Typhoid fever was 
also seen in 1 (3%) patient. This finding highlights 
the fact that low threshold should be kept, and 
patients should be screened for other co-existing 
etiologies along with hepatitis A. Limited studies 
done in Pakistan have all shown Hepatitis A as 
the leading cause of FHF. Similarly data from 
neighboring countries like India shows same 
pattern, however, Hepatitis E is reported as the 
predominant cause in Indian adults.12 Amongst 
the other infective etiologies, we had two(7%) 
patients with Septicemia, one patient (3%) had

salmonella sepsis with organism resistant to 
ceftriaxone. To our knowledge this was the first 
case of ceftriaxone resistant salmonella sepsis 
causing fulminant hepatic failure in a six-year-old 
child with a rapidly deteriorating clinical course 
leading to mortality.13 Previously Salmonella 
sensitive to ceftriaxone has been case reported as 
etiology for FHF in children from middle east.14
CMV hepatitis was seen in one patient (4%). 
Half of all the causes are infective in origin. The 
second most common cause in our study was sero 
negative (non A non E) hepatitis 8 (29%) patients. 
Studies from other centers in Lahore and Karachi 
has shown similar trends.15
Amongst the metabolic causes Dicarboxylic 
aciduria and Wilson disease was seen in one (3%) 
patient each. Drugs Valproate toxicity which 
was idiosyncratic was seen in one patient (4%) 
which is in contrast with western literature where 
acetaminophen toxicity is the most common 
cause.10 Among malignancy we had one patient 
with ALL relapse presenting with FHF. In our 
study 15(53.5%) patients survived, 14 improved 
on supportive care and only one patient with 
seronegative hepatitis survived following liver 
transplant.16 Timely liver transplant remains the 
only cure for survival in patients not improving 
on supportive care.17 Our rate of liver transplant 
is similar to other studies from resource limited 
countries, owing to delayed referrals, rapidly 
worsening disease process and limitation of the 
procedure as well.18 In contrast 10% of Paediatric 
liver transplants done in America are due to 
FHF.19 Mortality was seen in 6 (21.4%) patients. 
seven (25%) patients went LAMA/DOR so 
difficult to comment on their outcome. Mortality 
(21%) reported in our study is lower than another 
study reported from Lahore (36%).20 The degree of 
encephalopathy was significantly associated with 
mortality (0.02). This trend has been observed 
in other studies as well.21 Prothrombin time and 
INR were not found to be significantly associated 
with outcome in our study, a similar trend has 
been observed in some studies.22
The study shows infective etiologies as the 
predominant cause of fulminant hepatitis in 
Pakistani children, and highlights the need for 
improved sanitation, water supply, hand and food 
hygiene, vaccination23 and awareness.
Limitations to the study: There were few patients 
who were available as participants in the study. 
The sample size was also small due to records 
of patients being incomplete. Additionally, the 
study is retrospective in nature which is another 
limitation.
CONCLUSION
The study highlights infective diseases as the 
predominant etiology causing fulminant liver 
failure in children. Our study highlights lower 
mortality in children, majority of patients improved 
with supportive care while one patient underwent 
liver transplant.
