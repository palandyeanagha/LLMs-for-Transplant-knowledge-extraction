Abstract
Costimulation between T cells and antigen-presenting cells is essential for the regulation of an efective alloimmune response 
and is not targeted with the conventional immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation. Costimulation blockade 
therapy with biologicals allows precise targeting of the immune response but without non-immune adverse events. Multiple 
costimulation blockade approaches have been developed that inhibit the alloimmune response in kidney transplant recipients 
with varying degrees of success. Belatacept, an immunosuppressive drug that selectively targets the CD28-CD80/CD86 
pathway, is the only costimulation blockade therapy that is currently approved for kidney transplant recipients. In the last 
decade, belatacept therapy has been shown to be a promising therapy in subgroups of kidney transplant recipients; however, 
the widespread use of belatacept has been tempered by an increased risk of acute kidney transplant rejection. The purpose 
of this review is to provide an overview of the costimulation blockade therapies that are currently in use or being developed 
for kidney transplant indications.

1 Introduction
Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to prevent acute kidney transplant 
rejection (AR). Currently, the standard immunosuppressive regimen consists of induction therapy (either a T celldepleting agent or basiliximab, an antibody directed against 
the interleukin [IL]-2 receptor), followed by maintenance 
therapy consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI; either 
tacrolimus or ciclosporin) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) 
with or without glucocorticoids [1–4]. Although transplantation is a success story of modern medicine, the long-term 
allograft and patient survival are infuenced by the toxicity 
of CNIs, which include infections, malignancies, metabolic 
adverse efects, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity [5–7]. 
Another limitation of current immunosuppression is that it 
is a ‘one size fts all’ therapy and is not tailored to the individual needs of a KTR. Therefore, novel and personalized 
therapeutic strategies have to be developed.
Several approaches have been investigated to limit the 
adverse efects of CNIs, including monitoring of CNI concentrations to guide dosing, and CNI-sparing regimens. 
Examples of the latter are CNI minimization, CNI withdrawal, CNI conversion to alternative immunosuppressive 
agents, and, lastly, CNI avoidance from the time of the transplantation with substitution of an alternative immunosuppressive drug [8]. However, many such trials failed because 
they resulted in unacceptably high incidences of AR and 
toxicity, or an increased incidence of infections associated 
with the alternative immunosuppressants [9–15].
Costimulation is essential for the regulation of an efective alloimmune response. The costimulatory pathway is not 
targeted with the conventional immunosuppressive therapy. 
Biologicals that intervene with the costimulatory pathway 
may allow more precise targeting of the immune response 
without causing non-immune adverse events. Belatacept, a 
fusion protein composed of a crystallizable fragment (Fc) 
of immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and the extracellular domain 
of cytotoxic T lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA4), is the only 
costimulation blockade therapy that is currently approved 
for the prevention of rejection after kidney transplantation 
[16, 17]. Belatacept is well-tolerated and its use is associated 
with an improved allograft function compared with CNI in 
certain subgroups of KTRs [18, 19]; however, belatacept

Key Points
Multiple costimulation blockade drugs have been developed and tested in kidney transplant recipients. Belatacept, a biological that inhibits the interaction between 
antigen CD28 and CD80/86, is the only costimulation 
blockade drug that is currently approved for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection.
Belatacept is well-tolerated and is associated with a 
better allograft function compared with calcineurin 
inhibitors. A reason for concern is the higher risk of 
acute kidney transplant rejection compared with current 
standard immunosuppressive therapy.
Optimization of the selection of patients with a low risk 
for belatacept-resistant rejection in combination with 
new treatment strategies is necessary to expand the use 
of belatacept in the future.
The safety and efcacy of several other biologicals that 
target costimulation pathways (i.e. CD28 and CD40) are 
currently being investigated for kidney transplantation.
T-cell/transmembrane, Ig, and mucin (TIM) family; and (2) 
the TNF (tumor necrosis factor)/TNF receptor superfamily 
(Fig. 1) [21].
Signal 3 is formed by cytokines and the (increased) 
expression of cytokine receptors, such as the IL-2 receptor 
α-chain (CD25) (Fig. 1). Activation of CD25 will activate 
intracellular signaling pathways downstream of the TCR, 
including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), calcineurin, and PI3 K pathways, followed by the activation of 
transcription factors that regulate the production of several 
cytokines (i.e. IL-2 and interferon [IFN]-γ) [24]. These and 
other cytokines promote T-cell proliferation of diverse efector CD4+ T-cell subsets and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells [25].
3 Belatacept Therapy in Kidney 
Transplantation
3.1 Development of Belatacept
Belatacept targets the CD28-CD80/CD86 pathway. The 
costimulation molecule CD28 is a surface receptor that is 
constitutively expressed on T cells (Fig. 1). The inhibitory 
receptor CTLA4 is localized in intracellular vesicles in 
resting T cells and is expressed on the cell surface 48–72 h 
after T-cell activation. CTLA4 binds to CD80 and CD86 
with a higher afnity than CD28 [21]. Therefore, the binding of CTLA4 to CD80/CD86 dampens the activation of T 
cells [26]. At birth, almost all human T cells express CD28 
[27]. Aging, continuous antigenic stimulation (which can 
be caused by, for example, end-stage renal disease, human 
immunodefciency virus infection, and auto-immune disease) and cytomegalovirus infection lead to loss of CD28 
expression of T cells [27–29]. These CD28− efector memory T cells have reduced costimulatory requirements and an 
impaired proliferative capacity, but are highly proinfammatory [27, 30]. These cells rapidly secrete efector cytokines 
(i.e. TNFα and IFNγ) upon restimulation.
One of the frst biologics that was designed to target the 
CD28-CD80/CD86 superfamily was abatacept (Fig. 1), a 
fusion protein composed of an Fc of IgG1 and the extracellular domain of CTLA4 [31]. Because CTLA4 binds with 
a higher afnity to CD80/CD86 than CD28, it was hypothesized that T-cell activation could be inhibited with such 
a CTLA4 construct. Abatacept is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 2) [32], and has been 
tested in non-human primates transplanted with a kidney 
or pancreatic islets; however, alloreactivity appeared to be 
inhibited insufciently [33, 34]. Therefore, the development 
of abatacept therapy for transplantation was discontinued 
and a new CTLA4-Ig construct (belatacept) was developed 
with increased avidity for CD80 and CD86 by changing 
two amino acids (L104E and A29Y) (Figs. 1 and 2) [16]. 
may not be the game changer it was hoped to be due to a 
high risk of AR [20]. In this review, the current applications 
of biologicals that target costimulation pathways in kidney 
transplantation are discussed, including the current status 
and future strategies of belatacept therapy.
2 Costimulation
The process of T-cell activation is a complex cascade consisting of three signals. First, alloantigens from the allograft 
are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs; dendritic 
cells, macrophages, and B cells), which then home to the 
draining lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, the alloantigens 
are presented on the surface of APCs by human leucocyte 
antigen (HLA) molecules. In humans, the T-cell receptor 
(TCR) on naive T cells is activated after interaction with the 
alloantigen/HLA complex, which is also known as signal 1 
(Fig. 1). A costimulatory signal (signal 2) is necessary to 
achieve full activation of T cells. Several cell-surface proteins (costimulatory ligands) on APCs interact with their 
complementary receptors on naive T cells (Fig. 1). Signal 
2 represents a combination of positive and negative signals 
that regulate the outcome of the HLA/TCR. Without this signal, naive T cells will undergo apoptotic cell death [21–23].
Two costimulatory pathways are critical for T-cell activation: (1) the Ig superfamily (e.g. CD28 [T-cell-specifc 
surface glycoprotein CD28] family), the CD2/signaling 
lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family, and the 

Costimulation Blockade in Kidney Transplant Recipients 35
Belatacept was found to have a fourfold higher binding afnity for CD86 and a twofold higher binding afnity for CD80 
compared with abatacept [16]. Although the development 
of abatacept in transplantation was stopped, abatacept was 
recently used as rescue therapy in nine KTRs with an intolerance to CNI, because belatacept was temporarily unavailable due to manufacturing problems [35, 36]. None of the 
allografts were lost after a median period of 115 months and 
one patient experienced AR [35].
Belatacept was approved as treatment for the prevention 
of AR by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the 
US FDA in 2011 based on the results of two large randomized, controlled, multicenter, phase III trials (Fig. 2): 
The Belatacept Evaluation of Nephroprotection and Efcacy 
as First-line Immunosuppression (BENEFIT) study (with 
standard criteria donors) and the BENEFIT-extended criteria donors (BENEFIT-EXT) study [17, 37, 38]. In these 
trials, 1264 KTRs were treated with either ciclosporin or 
belatacept as frst-line treatment in combination with MPA 
and glucocorticoids. The main fndings of the BENEFIT and 
BENEFIT-EXT studies were that the 1-year patient and allograft survival of patients treated with belatacept were similar 
to patients treated with ciclosporin [37, 38]. Although the 
incidence of acute T-cell-mediated rejection (aTCMR) was 
increased in belatacept-treated patients, the kidney function was better in these patients compared with ciclosporintreated patients [37, 38]. In addition, the use of belatacept 
was associated with an increased risk for post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative disease, mostly in Epstein–Barr virus 
seronegative KTRs [37–39].

The safety and efcacy of belatacept were also tested 
in a phase II, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial in 
liver transplant recipients [40]. This trial randomized 260 
patients between therapy with belatacept (three diferent 
belatacept regimens) or tacrolimus (two diferent tacrolimus 
regimens). The primary composite endpoint consisted of 
incidence of acute liver transplant rejection, graft loss, and 
death at 6 months after transplantation. The occurrence of 
the composite endpoint was higher in the belatacept groups 
(42–48%) than in the tacrolimus groups (15–38%) [40]. The 
results of this study were reason to discontinue further development of belatacept for liver transplantation. However, 
the mean estimated glomerular fltration rate (eGFR) was 
15–34 mL/min/1.73 m2 higher in the liver transplant recipients treated with belatacept [40]. Therefore, liver transplant 
recipients with an impaired renal function could beneft 
from belatacept therapy. Proper selection of patients and an 
adjusted treatment protocol can possibly improve the results 
of belatacept in liver transplantation in the future [41].
3.2 Clinical Outcomes of De Novo Use of Belatacept 
in Kidney Transplant Recipients
A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed of 
fve studies that compared treatment with belatacept with 
CNIs (including the BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT studies) 
in 1535 KTRs [42]. Of the 521 patients treated with a CNI, 
478 patients used ciclosporin and 43 patients were treated 
with tacrolimus. After 3 years of treatment, no diference 
was seen between patients treated with either belatacept or 
a CNI regarding the risk of death (relative risk 0.75, 95% 
confdence interval [CI] 0.39–1.44; p=0.39), allograft loss 
(relative risk 0.91, 95% CI 0.61–1.38; p=0.67), and incidence of aTCMR (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.85–2.86; p=0.15) 
[42]. However, the kidney allograft function was better in 
patients treated with belatacept (eGFR mean diference of 
9.96 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI 3.28–16.64; p=0.0035). 
Furthermore, the use of belatacept was associated with a 
reduced incidence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus, better 
blood pressure, and a better lipid profle 1 year after therapy 
with belatacept [42].
In 2016, the 7-year follow-up results of the BENEFIT and 
BENEFIT-EXT studies were published. In these studies, the 
risks of death and graft loss in KTRs treated with belatacept 
were similar to those in KTRs treated with ciclosporin [18, 
19]. Although, the risk of aTCMR was higher in belatacepttreated patients compared with ciclosporin-treated patients, 
their kidney function after 7 years was better. An explanation for the better kidney function may be that belatacept 
is associated with less interstitial infammation and tubular 
atrophy compared with CNIs. Vitalone et al. compared the 
1-year protocol biopsies of KTRs treated with belatacept 
or ciclosporin [43], and found that the biopsies of patients 
treated with belatacept contained less interstitial infammation, interstitial fbrosis, and tubular atrophy, and gene 
expression analysis revealed a lower expression of genes 
involved in fbrosis and tubulointerstitial damage compared 
with the biopsies of patients treated with ciclosporin [43]. 
In another study, 10-year protocol biopsies of 23 clinically 
stable KTRs treated with belatacept and 10 KTRs treated 
with CNI (seven taking ciclosporin and three taking tacrolimus) were analyzed [44]. The biopsies of belatacept-treated

patients contained less interstitial infammation and tubular 
atrophy, less interstitial infammation, and less hyalinosis 
[44].
The 7-year follow-up studies also showed that the formation of de novo donor-specifc anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) 
was reduced in the belatacept-treated patients compared with 
the patients treated with ciclosporin [18, 19]. A possible 
explanation for this observation may be that costimulation 
blockade with belatacept leads to more efective prevention 
of DSA formation by B cells and that drug adherence is better in patients treated with belatacept because of intravenous 
administration. The occurrence of post-transplant diabetes 
mellitus, blood pressure, and lipid profle were not discussed 
in the long-term follow-up studies of belatacept.
To conclude, these long-term outcomes demonstrate that 
belatacept therapy is a safe therapy for KTRs and is associated with a better kidney function and a reduced incidence of 
de novo DSA. Whether long-term belatacept therapy leads 
to a better metabolic profle than CNI therapy is not known 
[18, 19, 39].
A limitation of the BENEFIT studies is that belatacept 
therapy was compared with ciclosporin therapy. Currently, 
the CNI of choice in most transplant centers is tacrolimus 
[1, 45]. No large, head-to-head, randomized controlled trials 
have been performed that compared the outcomes of patients 
treated with either belatacept or tacrolimus. In our center, a 
trial was performed that included 40 KTRs who were randomized between frst-line therapy consisting of tacrolimus 
or belatacept, in combination with MPA and glucocorticoids [46]. The AR incidence in the frst year after transplantation was higher in belatacept-treated patients (55% vs. 
10%; p=0.006) [46]. Another randomized controlled trial 
compared three treatment regimens in KTRs: alemtuzumab 
induction with tacrolimus, alemtuzumab induction with 
belatacept, and basiliximab induction with belatacept and 
a 3-month course of tacrolimus [47]. This study was halted 
prematurely after the inclusion of 19 patients, due to a high 
rate of serious adverse events in belatacept-treated patients, 
including thrombotic complications and aTCMR [47].
The comparison between belatacept and tacrolimus 
therapy has also been investigated in three indirect studies 
[48–50]. In a single-center, retrospective analysis, the outcomes of KTRs treated with belatacept (n=97) were compared with a historical cohort of patients treated with tacrolimus (n=205) [48]. An increased rate of aTCMR was noted 
in patients treated with belatacept compared with patients 
treated with tacrolimus (50.5% vs. 20.5%) [48]. In a retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study, the outcomes of KTRs treated with either tacrolimus or belatacept 
were compared [49]. The risk of AR was higher in the frst 
post-transplant year in patients treated with belatacept (odds 
ratio 3.12, 95% CI 2.13–4.57; p<0.001) but no diference 
was seen in the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% 
CI 0.61–1.15; p=0.28) or allograft loss (HR 0.83, 95% CI 
0.62–1.11; p=0.20) [49]. Muduma et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with an indirect treatment 
comparison analysis between tacrolimus (both immediaterelease and prolonged-release formulations) and belatacept 
[50]. The AR rate was reduced in patients treated with tacrolimus compared with patients treated with belatacept (risk 
ratio 0.22 [95% CI 0.13–0.39] to 0.44 [95% CI 0.20–0.99]) 
[50]. The risks of allograft loss and death were similar 
between both treatments.
One of the reasons for the high risk of aTCMR after 
belatacept may be that the immunosuppressive function of 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) is impaired [51–55]. Tregs are 
dependent on signaling via CTLA4, and binding of belatacept to CD80/86 interferes with CTLA4. Therefore, the 
combination of belatacept with therapies that preserve Treg 
functionality, such as T-cell-depleting antibodies and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors could possibly lead to a reduced incidence of AR [4, 56, 57].
The combination of induction therapy with T-cell-depleting drugs and belatacept has been tested in several studies, 
with various outcomes. In one study, alemtuzumab induction followed by tacrolimus or belatacept led to a similar 
incidence of AR [58]. In another study, patients treated with 
T-cell-depleting induction therapy (either rabbit antithymocyte globulin [rATG] or alemtuzumab) followed by 
belatacept were compared with patients treated with rATG 
induction followed by tacrolimus [59]. In all patients, glucocorticoids were withdrawn early. The AR incidence was 
higher in patients treated with belatacept, but the allograft 
and patient survival were similar [59]. In a third study 
(described above), alemtuzumab induction with belatacept 
in KTRs resulted in a high rate of serious adverse events 
and the study was halted prematurely [47]. T-cell-depleting 
induction therapy has also been tested in KTRs treated with 
belatacept in combination with mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus 
or everolimus). The AR rate in patients treated with this 
combination of drugs is low, and a signifcant increase in 
Tregs is seen [60–63].
Possible explanations for a lower rate of acute rejection 
after T-cell-depleting induction therapy compared with basiliximab induction therapy were (1) after T-cell-depletion 
therapy an increased repopulation of Tregs is seen, and (2) 
repopulated memory T cells in rATG-treated KTRs showed 
impaired cytokine responsiveness compared with those of 
basiliximab-treated KTRs [57, 64].
To conclude, although the studies that compared belatacept therapy with tacrolimus therapy have their limitations 
(limited number of patients or indirect comparison), belatacept is associated with an increased risk of aTCMR.

3.3 Clinical Outcomes After Conversion 
to Belatacept in Kidney Transplant Recipients
Although the use of belatacept is associated with an 
increased risk of aTCMR, it has been shown to be a good 
alternative in KTRs with a contraindication to CNIs. Multiple studies have reported successful conversion to belatacept in KTRs with CNI-induced nephrotoxicity, impaired 
allograft function, delayed graft function, CNI-mediated 
thrombotic microangiopathy, or atypical hemolytic uremic 
syndrome [65–82]. Furthermore, KTRs with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus while receiving CNI therapy may 
beneft from belatacept [83, 84]. In addition, since belatacept must be administered intravenously, it has the potential 
advantage of providing better compliance, for instance in 
adolescent KTRs [85].
Several approaches for conversion to belatacept have 
been evaluated, such as early or late conversion [77, 86–89], 
belatacept combined with a short period of tacrolimus therapy [48], and non-invasive screening for AR after conversion 
to belatacept to detect AR at an early stage [90]. In a phase 
II, prospective, randomized trial, KTRs with a stable kidney 
function were randomized, 6–36 months after transplantation, to maintenance therapy with either belatacept (n=84) 
or CNIs (n=89) [88]. Three years after randomization, kidney function was better in the belatacept group [89]. The 
rate of acute rejection was higher in the belatacept group 
(8.4%) compared with the CNI-treated patients (3.6%), but 
this diference was not statistically signifcant (p=0.2) [89]. 
In retrospective studies, a benefcial efect on kidney allograft function was seen in patients with early conversion 
to belatacept (within 3 months post-transplantation) and 
patients with low-grade proteinuria [77, 86, 87]. The combination of belatacept with 9 months of tacrolimus reduced 
the risk of aTCMR in a retrospective, single-center study 
(the 1-year aTCMR rate of belatacept therapy, tacrolimus 
therapy, and belatacept plus 9 months of tacrolimus was 
50%, 20.5%, and 16%, respectively), without an increased 
incidence of infections [48]. Malvezzi et al. also examined 
a strategy to safely convert KTRs to belatacept [90]. After 
the start of belatacept, the dose of tacrolimus was gradually 
reduced and withdrawn after 2 months. Serial measurements 
(at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month time points) of urine chemokine 
(C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9) were used to screen for AR 
non-invasively. In this study, 35 KTRs with a contraindication for CNIs were converted to belatacept after a median 
of 3.3 years (interquartile range 1.3–7.2) after transplantation [90]. Only one patient had a biopsy-proven AR that 
responded well to glucocorticoid pulse therapy [90]. The 
urinary CXCL9 concentration was elevated during AR. In 
addition to CXCL9, other potential minimally invasive biomarkers in the urine and blood of KTRs, such as cell-free 
DNA and extracellular vesicles, may assist clinicians to 
identify AR at an early stage [91, 92].
Currently, two studies are actively recruiting KTRs for 
conversion to belatacept; one study will investigate the 
efect of conversion to belatacept on proteinuria (ClinicalTrials.gov identifer NCT02327403), while the other study 
will examine the outcomes of conversion to belatacept 
3 months after transplantation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifer 
NCT02213068).
3.4 Belatacept Therapy in Sensitized Kidney 
Transplant Recipients
Initially, most studies that investigated the efectiveness of 
belatacept included only immunological low-risk KTRs [37, 
42, 46]. However, because belatacept therapy is associated 
with a reduced incidence of de novo DSA production, a 
growing number of studies on the application of belatacept 
(de novo and conversion) in sensitized KTRs are available 
[18, 19].
In the BELACOR study, 49 KTRs with preformed DSAs 
(maximal mean fuorescence intensity between 500 and 
3000) were treated with induction therapy of rATG followed 
by de novo belatacept maintenance therapy plus MPA and 
glucocorticoids [93]. The outcomes were compared with a 
retrospective control group of patients treated with CNIs. 
After 1 year of follow-up, no patients in the belatacept group 
experienced antibody-mediated rejection, while aTCMR 
occurred signifcantly more often in the belatacept-treated 
patients. Complete disappearance of class II DSAs was seen 
signifcantly more often in belatacept-treated patients [93].
In a retrospective study, the efcacy of belatacept in 
reducing anti-HLA antibodies in highly sensitized kidney 
transplant (current panel reactive antibodies≥98–100%) 
was investigated [94]. Sixty highly sensitized KTRs were 
treated with belatacept de novo, glucocorticoids, MPA, and 
low-dose tacrolimus (targeted to predose concentrations 
5–8 ng/mL in the frst 6 months, 3–5 ng/mL in months 6–9, 
followed by tapering and discontinuation at months 9–11 
post-transplantation). The control group existed of 44 highly 
sensitized KTRs treated with the current standard-of-care 
therapy (tacrolimus, MPA, and glucocorticoids). In the 
KTRs treated with belatacept, a decrease in the breadth and 
strength of HLA class I antibodies and current panel reactive 
antibodies was observed compared with the control group 
[94].
In another retrospective, single-center study, 29 DSApositive KTRs with a contraindication for CNI therapy were 
converted to belatacept after a median of 444 days [95]. The 
control group consisted of 44 non-immunized belatacepttreated KTRs. After a median follow-up of 308 days, one 
belatacept-treated patient experienced AR and two rejections were diagnosed in the CNI-treated patients. The eGFR 

Costimulation Blockade in Kidney Transplant Recipients 39
improved from 32 to 41 mL/min/1.73 m2 after conversion 
to belatacept [95]. In a smaller retrospective study, similar 
results were reported in six immunized KTRs (panel reactive antigen>80%, or positive fow cytometry crossmatch) 
who were converted from tacrolimus to belatacept (median 
4 months after transplantation) [96].
3.5 Biomarkers Predicting Belatacept‑Resistant 
Rejection
Because of the increased risk of aTCMR, belatacept may not 
be the game changer it was hoped to be [20]. Possibly, the 
drug should be reserved for KTRs with a low risk of belatacept-resistant AR. Quantifcation of an individual KTR’s 
risk of AR prior to transplantation is essential to identify 
those who might beneft from belatacept-based immunosuppressive therapy. Clinical tests to reliably predict the risk 
of belatacept-resistant AR are not yet available. The risk of 
AR is currently estimated with pretransplant assessment of 
DSAs, and HLA mismatch; however, alloreactive memory 
T-cell responses are not measured with these assays. The 
presence of alloreactive T cells pretransplantation can lead 
to rapid recognition of alloantigens after transplantation, and 
early AR [97, 98]. These alloreactive T cells can be measured with pretransplantation functional assays (e.g. measurement donor-reactive immune cells with enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent spot [ELISpot]) [97, 99].
Several studies have been performed to elucidate the 
pathogenesis of AR after belatacept therapy. An immunomic 
analysis of biopsies with AR of KTRs treated with tacrolimus or belatacept showed no diference in the intragraft gene 
expression and immunohistochemistry of markers that are 
involved in AR [100]. This implies a fnal common pathway of AR that is independent of the immunosuppressive 
regimen.
Apart from the efect of belatacept on Tregs [51–55], 
other T cells have been associated with belatacept-resistant 
AR, such as highly cytotoxic CD28− memory T cells, CD4+
CD28+ efector memory T cells, CD4+CD57+Programmed 
Death-1− T cells, and T helper (Th) 17 memory cells [46, 
98, 101–105]. However, conficting data have been reported 
regarding the possibility of predicting belatacept-resistant 
AR by measuring some of these T-cell subsets [46, 98, 
101–105], and currently none are clinically reliable for AR 
risk.
Another reason that may contribute to the increased incidence of AR is that belatacept therapy does not inhibit the 
T-cell activation pathway downstream of the TCR, in contrast to tacrolimus therapy [106]. In a study of 20 belatacepttreated KTRs, no inhibition of the phosphorylation of three 
important signaling molecules (p38MAPK, extracellular 
signal-regulated kinases [ERK] 1 and 2, and AKT8 virus 
oncogene cellular homolog [Akt]) was noted after treatment 
with belatacept [106]. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of 
ERK was increased in belatacept-treated patients on days 
4 and 90 in patients with an AR compared with patients 
without an AR [106].
Prediction of AR was not possible with a targeted proteomic analysis of pre-rejection serum samples of KTRs 
treated with belatacept [107]. In an assay with 92 infammation-related proteins, no diference was seen in the proteomic 
profle between the pre-rejection samples and samples of 
patients without AR [107].
To conclude, there are several explanations for the 
increased risk of AR associated with belatacept therapy. At 
present, no specifc tests (besides pretransplant screening for 
degree of sensitization) are available that can predict the risk 
for belatacept-resistant AR.
4 Alternative Approaches of Costimulation 
Blockade
4.1 CD28 Antibodies
Selective targeting of the CD28 antigen on T cells might 
be a superior immunosuppressive therapy compared with 
belatacept since this blockade leaves the inhibitory signal 
of CTLA-4 intact and may preserve Treg function (Fig. 1) 
[108, 109]; however, blockade of CD28 has been challenging. Most anti-CD28 antibodies bind to an epitope lying in 
the basolateral C’’D domain of CD28. Crosslinking of this 
epitope with an anti-CD28 antibody results in receptor clusterization, which leads to activation of the CD28 receptor 
instead of inhibition. In 2006, a CD28 humanized antibody 
(TGN1412) was tested in a phase I study (Fig. 2) [110]. This 
antibody was developed to cause activation and proliferation of Tregs independent of signals received from the TCR. 
In studies in cynomolgus macaques, TGN1412 revealed no 
toxic efects; however, in humans, infusion of TGN1412 led 
to life-threatening massive cytokine release in six healthy 
volunteers, and all of them had to be transferred to the intensive care unit [110]. CD4+ efector memory T cells appeared 
to be responsible for the massive cytokine release [111]. The 
reason that preclinical testing failed to predict this dramatic 
adverse efect was that CD4+ efector memory T cells of 
cynomolgus macaques do not express CD28, therefore these 
cells cannot be stimulated with TGN1412 [111].
Currently, two monovalent antibodies with only antagonistic action to CD28 are in clinical development—FR104 
and lulizumab-pegol (Fig. 2) [112, 113]. In non-human primates transplanted with a kidney allograft, FR104 in combination with rapamycin, a low dose of tacrolimus, or 1 month 
of low-dose tacrolimus, induced long-term allograft survival 
[114, 115]. Lulizumab-pegol was tested in non-human primates and showed inhibition of T-cell-dependent antibody 

40 M. van der Zwan et al.
responses and cytokine production [116]. In humans, both 
drugs have been evaluated in phase I clinical studies and 
were safe and well tolerated (Fig. 2) [113]. At present, a 
prospective multicenter study has been started to investigate 
the efcacy of lulizumab in combination with rATG, glucocorticoids, belatacept, tocilizumab, and everolimus in KTRs 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifer NCT04066114).
4.2 CD2/SLAM Family Antibodies
An antibody that interferes with the CD2/SLAM family is 
alefacept (Fig. 1). This is a fusion protein of lymphocyte 
function-associated antigen (LFA)-3 and the Fc part of 
IgG1 [117]. LFA-3 is expressed on APCs and is the ligand 
of CD2 on T cells. CD2 is expressed on all T cells, but 
memory T cells express the highest levels [118]. Alefacept 
binds to CD2 on T cells and blocks the interaction between 
CD2 and LFA-3. It was approved by the FDA in 2003 for 
the treatment of psoriasis, and administration of alefacept 
leads to the depletion of memory T cells (Fig. 2) [117]. In a 
phase II, randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter 
study, maintenance treatment with alefacept was compared 
with placebo in KTRs [119]. Both patient groups were also 
treated with tacrolimus, MPA, and glucocorticoids. There 
was no signifcant diference in the rate of biopsy-proven 
AR (alefacept 11% vs. placebo 7%; p=0.3). Furthermore, 
malignancy occurred more often in patients treated with alefacept (5.7%) compared with placebo (0.9%; p=0.06) [119]. 
In 2011, the manufacturer decided to stop the development 
of alefacept [120].
4.3 CD40/CD154 (CD40 Ligand) Antibodies
The CD40/CD154 pathway is a promising target for immunosuppressive therapy in KTRs. CD40 (TNF receptor 
superfamily 5 [TNFRSF5]) is constitutively expressed on 
the surface of APCs, including B cells, macrophages and 
dendritic cells, and T cells (mainly CD8+) [121]. CD154 
is the ligand of CD40 and is expressed on activated T cells 
and subsets of natural killer cells, eosinophils, and activated 
thrombocytes (Fig. 1) [121]. Ligation of CD40 with CD154 
leads to T-cell-dependent B-cell activation and proliferation, germinal center formation, Ig production, and isotype 
class switching. Furthermore, stimulation of CD40 provides 
macrophage efector function and promotes CD28-mediated 
costimulation through upregulation of CD80/CD86 and 
HLA molecules on APCs [122, 123].
Multiple antibodies that target the CD40/CD154 pathway 
have been developed and tested in patients with autoimmune 
diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, infammatory bowel disease, and 
idiopathic thrombocytic purpura [124]. Several CD154 
monoclonal antibodies (e.g. hu5C8, IDEC-131, ABI793, and 
H106) were tested in non-human primates and showed prolonged kidney allograft survival [33, 125–128]. However, in 
humans, administration of anti-CD154 antibodies led to an 
unanticipated, higher incidence of thrombotic complications, 
possibly because of activation of the coagulation cascade 
through CD154 activation on thrombocytes [129]. Therefore, the clinical development of anti-CD154 antibodies was 
terminated. Since CD40 is not expressed on thrombocytes, 
antagonistic anti-CD40 antibodies might not evoke thrombotic events. At present, many antagonistic anti-CD40 antibodies (e.g. ASKP1240, CFZ533, HCD122, Chi220, 3A8, 
2C10R1, 2C10R4, BI-655064, FFP104, ch5D12) are under 
investigation [124, 130]. Two of these anti-CD40 antibodies 
have been tested in KTRs, namely CFZ533 (iscalimab) and 
ASKP1240 (bleselumab).
Bleselumab is a fully humanized, non-depleting, antiCD40 IgG4 antibody. In non-human primates, bleselumab 
prolonged kidney allograft survival [131]. In a phase Ib study 
in KTRs, bleselumab was well tolerated and no thrombotic 
events occurred [132]. A more extensive (phase II) trial 
examined the efcacy and safety of bleselumab in KTRs 
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifer NCT01780844) (Fig. 2). Preliminary data presented at a conference showed that the incidence of AR 3 years of therapy was 13% in KTRs treated 
with standard therapy (tacrolimus), 11% in patients treated 
with bleselumab with low-dose tacrolimus (p =1.00 vs. 
standard therapy), and 41% in patients treated with bleselumab (p=0.02 vs. standard therapy) [133]. Furthermore, an 
increased incidence of cytomegalovirus and BK virus infections was seen in patients treated with bleselumab [132, 133].
Iscalimab is a non-B-cell-depleting anti-CD40 antibody that 
induced prolonged survival and function of kidney allografts 
in cynomolgus monkeys [134]. Furthermore, iscalimab led to 
complete absence of splenic germinal center formation, and 
formation of de novo DSA [134]. It is currently being tested 
in 325 KTRs in a phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifer 
NCT02217410) comparing standard-of-care therapy (tacrolimus, MPA, and glucocorticoids) with subcutaneous iscalimab 
every 2 weeks in combination with MPA and glucocorticoids 
(Fig. 2). Data from a proof-of-concept trial performed in 
2016–2017 demonstrated comparable efcacy on the composite endpoint of AR, graft loss, or death (21.2% vs. 22.2%), 
better kidney function (55.8 vs. 45.5 mL/min/1.73 m2
), and a 
reduced incidence of post-transplant diabetes mellitus (14.7 
vs. 38.9%) in patients treated with iscalimab compared with 
tacrolimus after 6 months of treatment [135].
5 Future Directions
Modulation of the costimulation pathway with biologicals remains a promising strategy for the prevention of AR 
because it is more specifc than traditional pharmacologic 

Costimulation Blockade in Kidney Transplant Recipients 41
immunosuppression and appears to have the advantage of 
having only limited non-immune toxicity. To date, belatacept 
is the only costimulation blockade therapy approved for the 
prevention of rejection. Although belatacept has been shown 
to be a promising therapy in subgroups of patients, its widespread use has been limited because of (1) the increased risk 
of aTCMR compared with tacrolimus; (2) concerns regarding its safety (increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder); and (3) logistical aspects, including the 
need for regular infusions and its temporary unavailability 
due to production shortages.
The use of belatacept could be expanded in the future, 
when it is possible to reliably identify patients who are 
at a low risk for belatacept-resistant AR (Fig. 3). Belatacept-based therapy may be administered to these low-risk 
patients, while the standard of care (tacrolimus-based 
therapy) should be ofered to KTRs with a high risk for 
belatacept-resistant AR (Fig. 3). Belatacept may also be an 
attractive alternative for patients with contraindications for 
CNIs (Fig. 3).
Another strategy to expand the use of belatacept is to 
combine belatacept with tacrolimus or other immunosuppressive therapies (Fig. 3). The risk of belatacept-resistant 
AR is reduced when it is used in combination with a short 
period, or low-dose, of tacrolimus [48, 90]. Belatacept therapy infuences the immunosuppressive function of Tregs 
[51–55]; therefore, the combination of belatacept with therapies that preserve Treg functionality, such as mTOR inhibitors, T-cell-depletion therapy, anti-CD40 antibodies, and 
adoptive therapy with Tregs could possibly lead to a more 
precise control of alloimmunity (Fig. 3) [56]. The combination of CTLA4/Ig and blockade of CD40/CD154 has not yet 
been tested in humans; however, in several animal transplant 
models, this combination produced long-term allograft survival [136–140].
CD28− memory T cells are insensitive to belatacept 
therapy; therefore, belatacept should be avoided in KTRs 
with a high number of these cells, or should be combined 
with drugs that efectively control CD28− memory T-cell 
immunity (Fig. 3). Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has 
immunomodulatory properties and, in vitro, these cells are 
shown to inhibit CD28− memory T cells [141, 142]. The 
combination of alemtuzumab induction followed by infusion with mesenchymal stem cells, belatacept, and sirolimus is currently being tested (ClinicalTrials.gov identifer 
NCT03504241).
More intensive monitoring of KTRs after conversion to 
belatacept might lead to better prevention or earlier recognition of AR. Belatacept dosing is administered at fxed intervals and is based on the body weight of the patient. According to the manufacturer of belatacept, it is not advisable to 
perform therapeutic drug monitoring of belatacept [143]. 
Pretransplant identification of high risk for belatacept-resistant AR:
- Clinical parameters: repeat transplant, HLA mismatch, PRA, DSA, previous rejection episode
- Alloantigen-specific memory T cells (in living donors)
- T cells with higher risk for belatacept-restistant AR: CD28-
 memory T cells, CD4+CD28+ effector memory T cells, CD4+CD57+PD1- T cells, and Th17 memory cells
Standard regimen (induction+TAC+MPA± glucocorticoids):
- High risk for belatacept-resistant AR
- Other contraindications for belatacept, i.e. EBV seronegativity
Belatacept-based immunosuppression*:
- Low risk for belatacept-resistant AR
- Reasons for minimization/withdrawal/conversion/avoidance of CNI:
- Contraindication to CNI: TMA, DGF, neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, poorly controlled DM
- Adherence problems
- Belatacept therapy pretransplantation to reduce anti-HLA antibodies
* Strategies:
1. CNI minimization: belatacept combined with a lower dose of tacrolimus
2. CNI withdrawal: belatacept combined with a period of tacrolimus
3. CNI conversion: early or late conversion to belatacept
4. CNI avoidance: 
- Standard belatacept regimen: basiliximab induction, belatacept, MPA ± glucocorticoids
- Promotion of Treg: belatacept combined with T cell-depleting induction, mTOR inhibitor, 
 anti-CD40 antibody, or adoptive therapy with Treg
- Inhibition of memory T cells: belatacept combined with mesenchymal stem cells
Monitoring for biomarkers of AR (in blood 
or urine): Transcriptomics, proteomics,
donor-derived cell free DNA, and extracellular 
vesicles

However, in the BENEFIT studies, a more intensive regimen 
was associated with an increased incidence of malignancies and infections, without an increase in efcacy [37, 38]. 
An automated assay to determine belatacept serum concentrations was recently developed [144]. The authors found 
reduced peak concentrations of belatacept in patients with 
a lower bodyweight [144]; however, whether this reduced 
exposure to belatacept leads to an increased risk of AR is 
unknown, but is certainly a reason for further investigation 
(Fig. 3).
Belatacept is currently administered every 4 weeks in the 
maintenance phase. In a 10-year follow-up study, the belatacept 4-weekly regimen was compared with administration 
of belatacept every 8 weeks [145]. After 10 years, kidney 
function and the risk of allograft loss or death was similar 
between the two groups; however, the risk of AR was higher 
in patients who received belatacept every 8 weeks [2]. With 
further investigation, such as the above-mentioned measurement of belatacept serum concentrations, the 8-weekly dosing regimen could ofer logistical advantages in subgroups 
of KTRs in the future.
Early recognition and treatment of AR leads to less allograft damage; therefore, minimally invasive screening for 
(preclinical) AR in KTRs could lead to better allograft survival (Fig. 3). Potential biomarkers for minimally invasive 
screening of AR in blood or urine are now entering the clinic 
[91, 107, 146]. Applying these minimally invasive screening 
tools to belatacept-treated patients could be a way to expand 
the use of belatacept.
To conclude, targeting the costimulation pathway is 
a complex but exciting task. Belatacept is a promising 
immunosuppressive therapy for KTRs, but a more tailored 
approach in the selection of patients, treatment protocol, and 
post-transplant monitoring is necessary to expand the use 
of belatacept.
