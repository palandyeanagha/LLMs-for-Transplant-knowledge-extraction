Background: Both stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) are effective local treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but whether RFA
is superior to SBRT is still controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to
compare the treatment outcomes of SBRT with RFA as curable or bridge intention.
Methods: We searched online databases for studies that compared treatment
outcomes for SBRT and RFA. Eligibility criteria included evaluation of local control, overall
survival (OS), transplant rate, and post-transplant pathological necrosis.
Results: As no randomized clinical trials met the criteria, 10 retrospective studies with
a total of 2,732 patients were included. Two studies were in favor of SBRT in local
control, two studies preferred RFA in OS, and others reported comparable outcomes
for both. SBRT demonstrated significantly higher 1- and 3-year local control than RFA
[odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% CI 0.24–0.74, P = 0.003; and OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37–0.80,
P = 0.002, respectively]. However, SBRT reported significantly shorter 1- and 2-year OS
(OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.21–1.90, P = 0.0003; and OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.38–2.01, P < 0.00001,
respectively). As bridge treatment, no significant difference was shown in transplant rate
and post-transplant pathological necrosis rate (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32–1.03, P = 0.060;
and OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.13–1.82, P = 0.290, respectively).
Conclusions: This study demonstrates SBRT is able to complete a better local control
for HCC than RFA, though the OS is inferior to RFA because of tumor burden or liver
profiles of the enrolled studies. Well-designed, randomized, multicenter trials will be
required to further investigate the conclusion.

Pan et al. SBRT vs. RFA in HCC
INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation is the most beneficial therapy for early
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, as it removes both
the tumor and the cirrhotic liver (1). However, given organ
availability limitation, a number of patients who may benefit
from this treatment have to stay on the waiting list for a
long time. Therefore, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are offered as potential alternative
local control modalities for patients in the waiting list (2, 3).
RFA induces coagulative necrosis of tumor through thermal
effect and is the first-line treatment for small HCC (≤3 cm),
providing comparable long-term outcome with resection (4).
However, RFA has several contraindications, including large
tumor size and lesions adjacent to major vessels or close to the
liver hilum. The above circumstances may result in incomplete
ablation, which potentially leads to worse prognosis (5–9).
SBRT is an advanced technology that delivers ablative
radiation doses to tumors in a few fractions while minimizing
the dose to normal liver tissue. Early results with SBRT have
shown considerable local control even for large tumors or HCC
ineligible for surgery (10). Moreover, SBRT has been frequently
used as an alternative to RFA for small HCC patients with tumors
near critical anatomical structures or major vessels due to the heat
sink effect that can occur with RFA (11).
Recent publications have reported either comparable
outcomes between the two treatment modalities or favorable
outcomes for one to the other (3, 10, 12–19). Most of the
published studies retrospectively reviewed clinical data in one
single center; the results of these observational studies could have
been strongly affected by several biases, and hence, the efficacy
of these two treatments regarding disease control, long-term
survival, and treatment related complications is ununified.
With the absence of randomized data, meta-analysis might
be able to draw a relative objective and reliable conclusion by
integrating data from different clinical centers. The aim of this
meta-analysis is mainly to compare the benefits of SBRT and
RFA in the local progression (LP) control and overall survival
(OS) in the treatment for HCC and to further help in clinical
decision making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Selection
The inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis were as follows:
(1) diagnosed primary liver cancer definitively and patients
diagnosed with HCC based on pathological evidence from fineneedle aspiration (FNA) or in the absence of biopsy evidence,
based on imaging techniques including contrast-enhanced
ultrasonography (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) companied with alphafetoprotein elevation; (2) no evidence of invasion into the major
portal/hepatic vein branches or extrahepatic metastasis based
on radiologic imaging; (3) patients without previous treatment
of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), surgery,
chemotherapy, or other antitumor treatment; (4) documented
indications for SBRT and RFA clearly; (5) either randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) or retrospective studies were candidates;
(6) patients of two groups with comparable basic clinical
characters; and (7) studies with outcome information regarding
LP rates, OS rates, and/or transplant rates.
Studies with following characteristics were excluded: (1)
studies that did not report original data, including abstracts, case
reports, expert opinions, editorials, reviews, or letters; (2) either
group in the studies or combined other therapies; and (3) studies
based on the same cohort.
Search Strategy
A systematic online databases search of PubMed Central,
Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was separately
conducted by two reviewers to identify all relevant availability of
studies until August 26, 2019.
This meta-analysis was performed consistent with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) statement checklist. The subject headings
(MeSH) search included “radiofrequency ablation,” “stereotactic
radiation therapy,” and “hepatocellular carcinoma”; and
keywords search was used, including “radiofrequency ablation,”
“stereotactic body radiation therapy,” and “hepatocellular
carcinoma.” These terms were used in different combinations.
Only studies on humans and English-language studies were
included. A manual research was performed by browsing all
references of all identified studies. This progressed research was
repeated to ensure to include the whole relevant studies. The
research was completed by two reviewers before the data analysis
independently (Y-XP and MX). If a study was controversial, the
corresponding author was asked to judge (Y-JZ).
Data Collection
Data were extracted from the included studies, including number
of patients in the SBRT and RFA groups; age; gender; primary
tumor size; number of tumors; median dose of SBRT; Child–
Pugh class; median follow-up time; 1-, 2-, and 3-year LP rates;
1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates; post-transplant necrosis rates; and
time to liver transplant.
Definitions
LP was defined as the recurrence of lesion in the treatment
area by imaging studies. And LP time was the period from the
initial treatment to the discovery of LP or last follow-up. The OS
was defined the period from the date of initial treatment of the
HCC to the date of death related to any cause or last follow-up.
Transplant rate was the proportion of patients who received liver
transplantation after SBRT or RFA therapies. Post-transplant
pathological necrosis was evaluated by post-transplant pathology.
Statistical Analysis and Synthesis
All analyses were performed with the help of statistical software,
named Review Manager, version 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Center;
Oxford, England). For data evaluation, patients were assigned
into two groups: the SBRT-treated group and the RFA-treated
group. The odds ratio (OR) and/or hazard ratios (HRs)
accompanying 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated
for dichotomous and univariable analysis outcomes in terms

Meanwhile, we assessed the heterogeneity among trials according
to the chi-squared (χ
2
) test including the inconsistency factor
(I
2
). The heterogeneity was defined as a P < 0.05 or an I
2 >40%
(20). Given the small number of included studies, though the
heterogeneity was not high, the random effects model was applied
throughout to enhance the reliability of results. A potential
publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting the Begg
funnel plots in which the standard error (SE) of log OR or log
HR was plotted against the OR or HR, respectively.
RESULTS
Search Results and Quality Assessment
A total of 440 studies were identified for the first time from
PubMed by the search strategy previously established, and 269
studies were identified via other sources or review. Subsequently,
11 studies were deleted for duplication with the help of Mendeley
(Elsevier Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The titles and abstracts of 270
studies were then screened for inclusion. The full texts of 36
studies were read; and, finally, we included 10 non-RCT studies
that met the present meta-analysis criteria (3, 10, 13–16, 18, 19,
21, 22). The details of the PRISMA flow diagram of the literature
for meta-analysis is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 (23).
In the present analysis, three studies were based on already
existing database (13, 15, 19), and the remaining seven studies
were based on retrospective studies (3, 10, 16–18, 21, 22). Two
studies conducted SBRT or RFA for transplant intent. Five studies
were performed in the USA (10, 13, 15, 18, 19), two in Japan
(12, 16), one in Canada (3), one in South Korea (17), and
one in China (22). Out of 2,732 patients from the 10 included
studies, 859 patients were classified into the SBRT group, and
the rest of the 1,873 patients were classified into the RFA group.
The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) (24) were used to assess
the quality of non-randomized studies. Although the qualities
of selections and outcomes were relatively appropriate in terms
of each study, over 50% of included studies were mediumscore studies because of inconsistent comparability. Therefore,
we believed that the present meta-analysis possesses a medium
class of quality (Supplementary Table 1).
Among included studies, two studies were in favor of SBRT on
local control (10, 21), two studies preferred RFA on OS (15, 19),
and others reported comparable outcomes between groups (3, 13,
16–18, 22). Notably, according to baseline characteristics, several
studies enrolled patients in SBRT group were prone to suffer
from larger tumor diameter (3, 10, 16, 19) and higher proportion
of Child–Pugh C patients [(18); Table 1]. These groups were
evaluated for therapeutic efficacy in treating HCC patients. The
details of the studies included in the present meta-analysis are
listed in Table 1.
Local Progression Rates
Six out of the 10 studies illustrated 1-, 2-, and 3-year LP rates
(10, 16–18, 21, 22). Our pooled results showed that the SBRT

group had significantly better 1- and 3-year local control rates
than the RFA group (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26–0.83, P = 0.010; and
OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37–0.81, P = 0.003, respectively). However,
the 2-year LP rate showed marginal benefit of SBRT group than
the RFA group (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43–1.05, P = 0.080). No
heterogeneity was shown among the studies of 1-, 2-, and 3-year
LP rates (χ
2 = 2.93, I2 = 0%; χ2 = 0.33, I2 = 0%; and χ2 = 2.66,
I
2 = 0%, respectively) (Figure 1).
Overall Survival
Nine studies with 2,700 patients compared OS rates of SBRT
group with RFA group (3, 10, 13, 15–17, 19, 21, 22), one study
with 280 patients were excluded as both SBRT and RFA were
applied as bridge therapies before transplantation, and the actual
OS rates of SBRT or RFA might be affected by subsequent
transplantation (3). The pool results showed that 2-year OS rates
of RFA group were better than those of the SBRT group (OR 1.57,
95% CI 1.23–2.00, P < 0.0003), whereas there were no differences
for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates in both groups (OR 1.38, 95% CI
1.00–1.93, P = 0.050; OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.90–2.33, P = 0.130; and
OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.81–2.26, P = 0.250, respectively; Figure 2).
Additionally, a secondary analysis was performed to control
the potential report bias, and we enrolled the studies that
reported outcomes of both LP and OS. As a result, the 1-,
2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates indicated no significant difference
between both groups (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.59–1.57, P = 0.870;
OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.89–2.03, P = 0.160; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.28–
3.36, P = 0.960; and OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.37–1.16, P = 0.150,
respectively; Supplementary Figure 2).
Prognosis for Treatment Allocation
Three and five studies evaluated the results of treatment
allocation as a prognostic factor for LP (10, 16, 17) and OS
(13, 15, 17, 19, 21), respectively. The treatment allocation was

not a prognostic factor for LP (HR 0.72, 95% IC 0.42–1.25,
P = 0.240). However, RFA group was more favorable than
SBRT group for OS benefits (HR 1.43, 95% IC 1.24–1.64,
P < 0.00001; Figure 3).
Transplant and Post-transplant
Pathological Necrosis Rate
Three and two studies reported the transplant rate and posttransplant pathological necrosis rate, respectively (3, 10, 18).
There were no significant differences in transplant rate and posttransplant pathological necrosis rate for both SBRT and RFA
(OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.24–1.79, P = 0.040; and OR 0.46, 95% CI
0.13–1.63, P = 0.230, respectively; Figure 4).
Publication Bias
The Begg funnel plot was used to evaluate the reliability of
publication bias in our meta-analysis (25). The shape of 11 funnel
plots was basically inverted and bilateral symmetry. Therefore,
these results indicated that there was little publication bias among
all comparisons in this meta-analysis (Supplementary Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
The main finding of this meta-analysis is that SBRT showed a
better local control than RFA for patients with HCC, though
the 2-year OS rates of SBRT were inferior because of the tumor
burden and liver profiles. Recently, RFA, as a traditional curable
treatment, was challenged by SBRT (15, 21, 22). With the
development of imaging technique, such as four-dimensional CT
(4DCT), SBRT is able to provide a more precise picture of HCC
for treatment design (26). This improvement of SBRT effectively
fixed the deficiencies of the high incomplete ablation rate of RFA
under several specific conditions (7).
In 2006, Romero et al. (27) firstly applied the radiational
technique of SBRT as a salvage treatment to control the primary
and metastatic liver tumors. Although only 25 patients with 45
lesions that were unfit for other local control treatment were
included in this study, the results preliminarily indicated that
SBRT was feasible with acceptable toxicity and local control
efficacy. They additionally pointed out that patients with Child
B level were accompanied by high toxicity risks, and the optimal
dose-fractionation schemes had to be found. Inspired by Romero
et al., other investigators mainly focused on the application of
SBRT on unresectable HCC and its effect in combination with
other therapies (28–30). All these studies proved that SBRT was
safe and provided satisfying local control for HCC, and this
encouraged the temptation of expanding the indications of SBRT
from a salvage or bridge treatment to curable intention.
RFA has long been applied as the first-line treatment for
small HCC according to several clinical practice guidelines,
including the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
and American Association for the Study of Liver Disease
(AASLD) (31, 32). However, RFA still suffers from high incidence
of local incomplete ablation because of technical limitations
[varies from 2 to 60% (5–9)], and it required additional or
combinational therapies (33). As an advanced technique that
shows reliable local control and safety on HCC, SBRT has been
considered as a potential alternative therapy to RFA.
Many observational or retrospective studies in recent years
have indicated that SBRT showed a non-inferior local control
rate as compared with RFA (10, 16–18, 22). Shiozawa et al.
(16) first compared the clinical outcomes between SBRT and

RFA for HCC patients in a pilot study in 2015 and reported
that SBRT was likely to become an important option for local
treatment of early HCC. The subsequent studies indicated
that SBRT appeared to be a reasonable alternative treatment
of inoperable HCC in 2016 (10, 22). Subsequently, several
large-volume validation studies based on online database had
also proved comparable outcomes between SBRT and RFA
regarding local control (13, 19). Moreover, in 2019, Kim
et al. (17) retrospectively reviewed the institutional database
for RFA and SBRT with curative intent, and they revealed
that SBRT appears to be an effective alternative treatment for
HCC when RFA is not feasible due to tumor location or
size. However, another database validation from the American
National Cancer Database revealed better OS of RFA than SBRT
(15). A meta-analysis is needed to attain definitive proof to solve
these debates. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to help
identify the advantages and disadvantages of SBRT and RFA
in HCC.
In the present meta-analysis, with respect to local control,
SBRT showed significantly lower 1- and 3-year LP rates, which
indicated that SBRT achieved superior local control to RFA in
treating HCC. In detail, there were five and four studies that
enrolled the 1- and 3-year LP rate analyses, respectively. Among
these studies, studies from Wahl et al. (10) and Duan et al.
(22) were based on patients with inoperable HCC, studies of
Shiozawa et al. (16) and Hara et al. (21) were based on patients
with early-stage HCC, and studies from Kim et al. (17) and
Mohamed et al. (18) did not specify patients characteristics.
Most of the enrolled studies tended to draw the conclusions
with respect to local control that supported SBRT. Moreover,
Wahl et al. (10) and Hara et al. (21) reached significantly
favorable results for SBRT in treating inoperable and earlystage HCC, respectively. However, only Kim et al. (17) clarified
the information of HCC location; others did not refer to this
critical factor, which might influence the local control of RFA in
our previous study (34). Additionally, treatment allocation was
not a significance prognostic factor on the basis of prognostic
analysis. Therefore, further studies are needed to guarantee the
appropriate individual treatment allocation.
Although SBRT enjoyed higher local control rates than RFA in
the present study, the 2-year OS rates of SBRT were significantly
lower than RFA. Notably, Berger et al. (19) and Rajyaguru
et al. (15), who reported favorable OS rates of RFA with large
sample volume, did not illustrate the LP rates correspondingly.
There were two main reasons to the contradictory results
between OS rates and LP rates. Firstly, there might be report
bias when analyzing LP rates for both groups, which might
result in inconsistent outcomes between LP rates and OS
rates because of unreported LP. Therefore, we conducted the
secondary analysis on OS rates that included the studies that
reported both LP rates and OS rates, and we found that the
1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were comparable between SBRT
and RFA (Supplementary Figure 2). Secondly, as the first-line
treatment, RFA is more likely to be assigned to patients with
better conditions. Patients who underwent SBRT were prone to
suffer from larger tumor size and worse liver function, which
indicated worse prognosis and decreased OS. Interestingly, the
3- and 5-year OS rates showed no significance in both groups,
indicating that patients who did not die of tumor burden
or liver functions in a short time might finally benefit from
both treatments similarly. Meanwhile, RFA showed significant
survival benefit for prognostic analysis on treatment allocation,
which also could be explained by the reasons above. Therefore,
we believed that the real effects of SBRT and RFA on longterm survival need to be further validated by high-level evidence,
including RCTs.

Pan et al. SBRT vs. RFA in HCC
As for bridge therapies to transplant, both SBRT and RFA
provided a similar effect on patients waiting for transplantation.
And the post-transplant pathological necrosis rate was
comparable between both groups. These outcomes indicated that
SBRT can be safely utilized as a bridge treatment to patients in
the waiting list for transplantation with HCC, as an alternative
to conventional bridging therapies. However, only three studies
and 536 patients in total compared these parameters, and more
solid studies were needed to be enrolled in the future.
This meta-analysis suffered from several limitations. First
of all, only retrospective studies were available, resulting in
relatively low quality of the evidence for the whole pooled results.
Secondly, the results from this study should be interpreted
carefully, because the sample sizes of four studies were relatively
small, which is supposed to affect the reliability. And a further
sensitivity analysis on the factors affecting outcomes could not
be applied. Additionally, some studies were shorter followup in the SBRT group, which could result in obscuring late
effects. Therefore, some well-designed, large, prospective, and
multicenter studies are desperately needed to obtain more
solid evidence.
CONCLUSIONS
In sum, our meta-analysis shows that SBRT provided better local
control than RFA, and it could be used as a potential alternative
local control treatment for HCC.
