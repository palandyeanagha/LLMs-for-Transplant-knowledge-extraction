Abstract Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis and/or porto-systemic shunting. The clinical symptoms are widely variable,
extending from subtle impairment in mental state to coma.
The utility of categorizing the severity of HE accurately
and efficiently serves not only to provide practical functional information about the current clinical status of the
patient but also gives valuable prognostic information. In
the past 20–30 years, there has been rapid progress in
understanding the pathophysiological basis of HE; however, the lack of direct correlation between pathogenic
factors and the severity of HE make it difficult to select
appropriate therapy for HE patients. In this review, we will
discuss the classification system and its limitations, the
neuropsychometric assessments and their challenges, as
well as the present knowledge on the pathophysiological
mechanisms. Despite the many prevalent hypotheses
around the pathogenesis of the disease, most treatments
focus on targeting and lowering the accumulation of
ammonia as well as inflammation. However, treatment of
minimal HE remains a huge unmet need and a big concerted effort is needed to better define this condition to
allow the development of new therapies. We review the
currently available therapies and future approaches to treat
HE as well as the scientific and clinical data that support
their effectiveness.

Introduction
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as ‘‘brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or porto-systemic shunting manifesting as a wide spectrum of
neurological or psychiatric abnormalities ranging from
subclinical alterations to coma’’ [1]. The recognition that
liver disease and in particular jaundice could be associated
with mood and behavioral disturbances can be traced back
to the father of Western medicine, Hippocrates (460–371
BC) [2]. However, it was not until experimental work in
the late nineteenth and the twentieth century that pathophysiological mechanisms of this relationship started to
unravel, instigating a shift leading to the understanding that
behavioral changes are an integral consequence of chronic
liver insufficiency and disease.
Classification of hepatic encephalopathy
The clinical presentation of HE may be highly variable
constituting, a myriad of signs and symptoms ranging from
defects in cognition, personality and intellect to altered
conscious state and impaired neuromuscular function such
as asterixis and hyperreflexia. The heterogeneous manifestations of HE vary not only between patients but also
longitudinally for an individual patient. Furthermore,
important observations that cirrhotic patients who appear
clinically ‘‘normal’’ could also have defects on electroencephalography [3] and neuropsychometric testing [4] have
led to the concept of minimal HE (mHE). In order to
reconcile short comings and difficulties in accurately
defining and classifying the severity of HE, in 1998 the
World Organisation of Gastroenterology introduced a
multiaxial definition of HE [5], which categorized HE
according to; (1) etiology (Type A—Acute Liver failure,
Type B—Portosystemic bypass without intrinsic liver disease, Type C—Cirrhosis), (2) severity (minimal or West
Haven Grade 1–4 [Table 1]), (3) time course (episodic,
recurrent, persistent), and (4) precipitated versus spontaneous. The EASL-AASLD consensus modified this in 2014
but kept the main elements of this classification [1].
The West Haven Criteria categorizes HE into 4 stages
based solely on clinical criteria, and is often used arbitrarily and subjectively by clinicians in routine practice
rather than considering all manifestations in a particular
stage [6]. It has good functionality in distinguishing those
patients at the lower and higher ends of the scale, but the
main limitation lies in accurate identification and discrimination of grade 1 HE from those who have no HE and
those with mHE due to significant inter- and intra-observer
inconsistency [7]. The Hepatic Encephalopathy Scoring
Algorithm (HESA) [8] combines clinical and neuropsychological assessment as a means of improving the sensitivity of grading and has shown promise in clinical trials
[9]. The Clinical Hepatic Encephalopathy Staging Scale
(CHESS) [10] was developed as a newer method, and
grades severity of HE in a linear fashion from 1 to 9, but is
not widely used. Grade II HE is more readily discriminated
using disorientation and asterixis as markers, which has led
to a proposal by the International Society for Hepatic
Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism (ISHEN) to
term HE Grade CII as Overt HE (OHE), whereas Grade 1
and mHE may be classed as Covert HE (CHE) [7]. OHE
and CHE can be viewed as tangible points in a paradigm
that considers the spectrum of neurocognitive impairment
in cirrhosis as a continuum rather than categorical [11].
The term CHE is limited, being in essence an umbrella
term. A study of 132 cirrhotics demonstrated CHE to be
heterogeneous syndrome requiring a combination of clinical and neuropsychometric indicators for diagnosis [12]. In
a recent prospective study, Thomsen et al. [13] showed that
patients with Grade 1 HE were clinically, pathophysiologically and prognostically distinct from those with mHE,
suggesting that lumping Grade 1 HE and mHE together
under the term CHE is potentially flawed.
The utility of categorizing the severity of HE accurately
and efficiently serves not only to provide practical functional information about the current clinical status of the
patient but gives valuable prognostic information and

presents objective standards for research and trials
involving HE. The current challenge thus is of first clarifying what is ‘‘normal’’, as an absence of HE does not
necessarily equal absence of neuropsychometric abnormality [14], and then determining optimal methods by
which early HE can be consistently and accurately distinguished. Montagnese et al. [14] advocate the advantages of
considering an individual’s lifelong neuropsychometric
performance and co-morbidity in determining whether any
abnormality equates to HE.
Neuropsychometric assessment
Although termed minimal, mHE is not trivial, having been
associated with a multitude of deleterious effects on quality
of life [15], including sleep disturbance [16], falls [17],
ability to drive [18] and impacts on employment ability,
with knock-on effects on associated socio-economic status
[19]. The occurrence of mHE predicts the onset of OHE
[20] and adversely affects survival [21]. Several methods
are available to diagnose mHE, including common tests
such as Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score
(PHES), Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) and Electroencephalogram (EEG); less widely-used tests include the
scan test, Continuous Reaction Time (CRT) Test, Inhibitory Control Test (ICT) and repeatable battery for the
assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS). A
significant issue, however, is just the moderate concordance between differing methodologies, [22] which is
likely indicative of the tests reflecting different pathologies
[23], and thus they should be considered as complementary
rather than equivalent [14]. Given the detrimental impact
of mHE, there is an urgent need to translate diagnostic
criteria and tests into pragmatic everyday clinical practice
[24].
Assessing the degree to which cognitive dysfunction is
caused by hepatic insufficiency can be challenging, as not
only can a multitude of potential concurrent factors such as
infection, renal failure, drugs, or pre-existing cognitive/
psychiatric disorders contribute to and exacerbate HE, but
causes of underlying liver disease such as alcohol [25],
obesity [26] and Hepatitis C [27] may also lead to
impairment in cognitive ability. This distinction is important in order to allow identification and correct individual
treatment of all mechanisms causing altered mental status.
HE is observed in a one third of all patients admitted to
hospital with acute decompensation [28]. The presence of
HE is predictive of worse survival in both patients with and
without Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) [29].
Isolated HE in acute decompensation is different to the
ACLF, in that it is associated with older age, inactive
drinkers and not fundamentally related to the severity of
underlying liver disease, highlighting the predisposition of
other insults to the brain (ageing and alcohol) in the
development of HE [29]. In ACLF, HE is more frequent in
younger patients with more severe liver failure, infection
and evidence of systemic inflammation (white cell count
and C-reactive protein). Cognitive impairment in cirrhosis
is strongly associated with bacterial infection; a prospective study demonstrated cognitive impairment (overt or
subclinical) in 42% of cirrhotics without infection, in 79%
with infection and in 90% with sepsis and systemic
inflammatory response [30]. It is proposed that HE in
ACLF is clinically distinct from that in acute decompensation driven by diverse pathological mechanisms in each
entity [31], underscoring the multifactorial pathogenesis of
this condition. More studies are therefore required for the
better understanding of each condition and mechanism of
development of HE.
Pathophysiological mechanisms of HE
HE occurs due to a combination of distinct pathophysiological mechanisms such as inflammation [32], oxidative
stress [33], impaired blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, neurotoxins, impaired energy metabolism of the
brain [34] and more (Fig. 1). Moreover, it is assumed that
HE is caused by similar mechanisms both in mHE and
overt states of the syndrome. However, recent clinical and
experimental data suggest that there are discrepancies
between studies indicating that HE is likely to be a
heterogenous entity. In this section, we will try to assess
the current limitations in our understanding of the pathophysiology of HE.
Brain edema and energy metabolism
In acute liver failure (ALF), the deficiency of energy
metabolism associated with brain edema has been fully
described. This energy dysfunction is thought to be due to a
compromised tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme, a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity, limited anaplerotic flux and
capacity of astrocytes to detoxify ammonium by glutamine
synthesis, increased lactate synthesis as well as mitochondrial permeability transition induced by oxidative/nitrosative stress [34, 35]. At later stages of the disease,
several mechanisms have been proposed where the circulating ammonia can increase glutamine, which could secondarily impact energy metabolism through an initial
osmotic stress, while changes in the glutamate–glutamine
cycle will follow. Additionally, brain edema is life
threatening and in these patients brainstem herniation and
death can occur [36]. However, instead of a severe edema
seen in ALF, mild edema is seen in chronic liver failure
Hepatol Int (2018) 12 (Suppl 1):S135–S147 S137
123

(CLF), which correlates with lower and more variable
ammonia concentrations [37]. Finally, the presence of
edema is described infrequently in ACLF patients where it
is only present in 4–8% of patients [38].
In line with this, a recent ex vivo study in 6 weeks bileduct ligated (BDL) rats showed that a rise in lactate (1.7
fold) and not glutamine is an important player in the
pathogenesis of brain edema in CLF [39]. In an apparently
contradictory study, Hadjihambi et al. [40] showed a
decrease in extracellular lactate in the cerebral cortex, due
to hemichannel dysfunction, (Fig. 2), which suggests that
the total brain lactate increase reported by previous studies
would be due to its intracellular accumulation. Interestingly, Rackayova et al. [41] reported no significant elevation of lactate in rats 8 weeks following BDL, which is a
very severe model of HE. These observations are very
important as lactate does not only act as an osmolyte but is
also an essential energy metabolite, reflecting potential
cerebral energy impairment in patients with HE.
Neurotransmission alterations
Another pathogenic mechanism in HE associated with
energy disturbances is the alteration in neurotransmission
systems, such as the glutamatergic and GABA-ergic systems, resulting in neuronal disinhibition (mechanism
described in Fig. 2). However, recent studies in a model of
8-week BDL rats [41] have shown no changes in GABA
concentrations but observed a decrease of glutamate and
aspartate while glutamine concentrations were elevated.
Therefore, contrary to the traditional approaches, these
changes could be explained as the result of ammonium
detoxification driven by increased glutamine synthesis
from glutamate in astrocytes, without necessarily affecting

ammonia levels (C). The

neurotransmission at late stages of the disease. However, a
more thorough investigation of mild models of CLF needs
to be performed with more precise techniques for neurotransmitter examination.
Bile acids
The presence of huge concentrations of bile acids was
recently shown to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) of cirrhotic patients with HE [42]. In animal
models, it has been shown that rats with acute galactosamine-induced liver failure exhibit regional cerebral
edema, indicating that the BBB had lost, at least in part,
its barrier function [43]. In a model of BDL, a significant
increase in circulating bile acids and a compromise in the
integrity of the BBB were found. In the light of these
studies, increases in serum bile acids are not just a feature
of biliary disorders. Spillover of bile acids into the circulation are also observed during ALF [44], ACLF [44],
and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [45], and even in the
CSF of cirrhotic patients. Therefore, the direct role of
bilirubin or bile acids in the development of HE should
also be reconsidered.
Manganese accumulation
Manganese deposits have been described as a cofactor in
the development of HE. The observation that the reduction
in brightness of the basal ganglia observed on magnetic
resonance imaging rapidly improves after liver transplantation [46] may be supportive of the manganese deposition
hypothesis. However, the observation that, in occupational
manganese exposure, the resolution in cerebral pallidal T1
hyperintensity is much slower [47] suggests that this is a
more complex issue.
Inflammation
It is important to highlight that brain cell damage is not
only a consequence of the development of HE but also a
contributing factor. Under these circumstances, it has been
shown that astroglia releases TNF-a, followed by a release
of glutamate while also activating microglia [48]. Microglia activation is usually followed by proliferation and
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL1b and IL-6 [48], while there is strong evidence that this
inflammatory state can lead to neuronal death in vitro and

also revealed impairment of

in vivo [49, 50]. It is well known that this inflammatory
state can be triggered from systemic inflammation underlying the gut–liver–brain axis alteration, which includes
direct effects of systemic pro-inflammatory molecules in
the brain, recruitment of monocytes after microglial activation and altered permeability of the BBB [51].
There is evidence based on both animal and human
studies showing that high ammonia induces HE only if
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is present [43, 52]. Thus, it is widely accepted that sepsis is able
to trigger HE in cirrhotic patients as a result of altered
nitrogen metabolism and also by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators [53]. In 2000, Rolando and colleagues
suggested that, in ALF patients, the presence of SIRS
resulted in a poorer neurological outcome [31]. Furthermore, in ACLF, sepsis is an important precipitating factor
for decompensating liver failure and HE in previously
stable patients with cirrhosis [54], indicating the importance of inflammation in the pathogenesis of the disease.
The CANONIC study also demonstrated the clear role of
systemic inflammation in patients with advanced HE which
also correlated with mortality [55].
Treatment
The approach to the treatment of HE depends on its
severity. Ammonia remains the main target and is aimed at
reducing the production of ammonia and maximizing the
body’s removal of ammonia from the bloodstream. However, ammonia metabolism is complex and is regulated in
various organs such as the liver, muscles, kidneys and
brain. Therefore, the drugs used to treat HE need to be well
understood and undergo regulated clinical trials to maximize their effectiveness. Additionally, lack of treatment for
other precipitating factors involved in the development of
HE, such as oxidative stress, inflammation or other cerebral
alterations, is a major limiting step in the treatment area.
The first priority of treatment depends on actively identifying and treating all potential precipitating causes, such as
infection, electrolyte disturbance, dehydration, etc., while
managing the complications of encephalopathy. Finally,
recurrence of HE needs to be addressed when the patient
recovers from the acute episode. Despite the subtle nature
of minimal and episodic HE, it can have significant effects
on a patient’s daily living. Unfortunately, at this time, only
OHE is routinely treated and overall medical treatment
options for HE are limited. Finally, a more personalized
treatment will have to be developed for patients, without
focusing only on the stage of HE but also considering the
disease responsible and its history. Some of the most current and emerging treatments for HE are discussed in the
following section and depicted in Table 2.
Non-absorbable disaccharides and polyethylene
glycol
Lactulose and to a lesser extent lactitol are standard
treatments that are aimed at reducing the amount of
ammonia absorbed into the blood stream. One of the
actions of lactulose is to create a hyperosmolar environment and act as a laxative preventing efficient absorption of
ammonia by the colon (Fig. 1). Despite the lack of evidence for the use of lactulose on patients with acute HE
[56], a recent meta-analysis showed that non-absorbable
disaccharides have beneficial effects in the treatment and
prevention of HE. Furthermore, other benefits include
reduction in serious liver-related morbidities and all-cause
mortality [57]. Studies comparing lactulose to control are
lacking and, therefore, no comparative studies exist to
strongly validate the use of lactulose for the treatment of
hyperammonemia [58]. Additionally, one study showed
that nearly 50% of HE recurrence was related to either no
adherence or inappropriate dosing [59]. There is, however,
a danger for overuse of lactulose leading to complications,
such as dehydration, aspiration, hypernatremia and perianal
skin irritation. This can lead to difficulties during liver
transplantation and can cause malnutrition in patients [59]
or even precipitate HE. Despite the limited evidence of
efficacy, lactulose is widely used in clinical practice. While
some studies have shown benefits in primary prophylaxis
with lactulose [60], current guidelines do not recommend
the routine use of lactulose as primary prophylaxis for HE
[61]. Additionally, Rahimi et al. [61], performed a randomized clinical trial comparing polyethylene glycol
(PEG) and lactulose treatments in patients with cirrhosis
admitted to the hospital for HE. The results of this study
revealed that PEG led to more rapid HE resolution than
standard therapy, suggesting that PEG may be superior to
standard lactulose therapy in patients with cirrhosis hospitalized for acute HE. However, more studies are required
to establish the effectiveness of this compound.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are divided into two classes: absorbable and
non-absorbable antibiotics. Within the absorbable category,
neomycin has been previously used extensively in the
management of acute, but not chronic HE. A study has
demonstrated that neomycin is as effective as lactulose in
33 patients [62], although, in another randomized study by
Strauss, neomycin was shown to be no better than a placebo in patients with HE [63]. Patients who are maintained
on chronic neomycin must have periodic evaluation for
potential side effects while more clinical trials are required
to evaluate the effectiveness of this antibiotic. In the poorly
absorbable antibiotics category, rifaximin is the most
S140 Hepatol Int (2018) 12 (Suppl 1):S135–S147
123

commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of HE and has
also been used in a number of trials [64]. A meta-analysis
by Wu et al. [65] has shown that rifaximin is as effective
and potentially better than non-absorbable disaccharides at
treating HE. A double-blind, randomized study with 120
patients revealed a significant decrease in OHE when both
treatments, lactulose and rifaximin, were used in combination rather than when lactulose treatment was used alone.
Length of hospital stay was also significantly decreased
[66]. The data clearly demonstrate that patients tolerate
rifaximin better and that best results are achieved when it is
coupled with lactulose. Moreover, a cohort study of 299
patients revealed a reduced risk of hospitalization involving HE over a 6-month period with the use of rifaximin
[67]. Despite this, further research is required to support
the use of rifaximin alone since limitations such as lack of
placebo represent the current studies [68]. The only significant complication observed so far with this antibiotic
involved two unique cases of Clostridium difficile infection
[69].
L-ornithine and L-aspartate
L-Ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) are substrates for the
urea cycle and can increase urea production in periportal
hepatocytes. They also activate glutamine production by
activating glutamine synthetase in perivenous hepatocytes
and skeletal muscles. Studies have indicated that LOLA
use was ineffective in reducing the ammonia concentration
and the severity of HE in ALF patients [70]. However, in

patients with CLF, an improvement in recurrent bouts of
HE was shown, while the treatment was well tolerated and
was shown to be superior to placebo [71]. Furthermore,
although LOLA initially lowers blood ammonia levels,
even in end-stage liver disease, its effects appear to be
temporary as a rebound hyperammonemia is sometimes
observed on cessation of the drug [72]. Further research is
required in determining amount, duration and dosage of
this treatment.
Ornithine phenylacetate
Drug treatment with ornithine phenylacetate (OP) focuses
on the formation of glutamate and the removal of glutamine. L-Ornithine is active in the synthesis of glutamate.
OP stimulates glutamine synthetase activity in peripheral
organs [73]. The consequent increase in glutamine synthesis results in a net decrease of plasma ammonia. Finally,
in order to prevent the ‘rebound effect’ of glutaminase,
glutamine is conjugated with phenylacetate to form
phenylacetylglutamine, a molecule that cannot be metabolized and is harmlessly excreted in the urine [74]. OP
successfully prevents increases in arterial ammonia while
evidence exists from animal models suggesting a significant decrease in extracellular brain ammonia, preventing
intracranial hypertension and improving the mental state
(mechanism of action summarized in Fig. 1) [75]. OP is
currently in Phase II trials and a small open-label study has
shown that the administration of OP was safe and resulted
in a marked reduction in ammonia concentration [73].
However, a recent randomized clinical trial in 38 consecutive cirrhotic patients, enrolled within 24 h of an upper
gastrointestinal bleed, indicated that OP appeared well
tolerated although failed to significantly decrease plasma
ammonia at the given doses (10 g/day) [76]. In a large
clinical trial in about 230 patients with OHE, preliminary
data shows that the administration of OCR-002 results in a
dose-dependent significant reduction in ammonia and an
improvement in the severity of HE (unpublished data;
www.oceratherapeutics.com)
Glycerol phenylbutyrate (HPN-100)
Glycerol phenylbutyrate (GPB) provides an alternative
pathway for ammonia removal and waste nitrogen excretion in the form of phenylacetyl glutamine. This results in a
lower net blood glutamine and, therefore, ammonia production from the action of glutaminase. In a randomized,
double-blind Phase IIb study, effectiveness of this drug was
shown in cirrhotic patients with evidence of a reduction of
ammonia and a reduction in both the recurrence of HE and
re-hospitalization [77]. However, this effect was lost when
co-administered with rifaximin. This suggests its potential
usefulness in secondary prophylaxis of HE. However, more
clinical trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of
this drug as a treatment of HE.
Albumin administration and dialysis
Albumin can be beneficial to HE patients because it has
anti-oxidant properties and is able to scavenge reactive
oxygen species. However, studies on albumin administration in patients with stage II or higher HE was ineffective
in resolving HE severity, ammonia levels, oxidative stress
markers or cytokines, but it prolonged survival [77]. It was
also found that albumin dialysis using the Molecular
Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) in patients with
HE showed a quicker improvement than in patients not
treated with this device [78]. MARS also achieved
decreases in plasma bilirubin, ammonia and creatinine
concentrations as well as improved portal pressure in
ACLF [79]. However, there was no significant improvement in severe HE [80]. Further studies are required for
conclusions to be drawn and to evaluate the efficacy of this
treatment.
Portosystemic shunt occlusion
Large portosystemic shunts bypass the liver, resulting in
hyperammonemia and HE. While embolization of these
shunts was shown to resolve HE immediately, it is only
effective in the presence of residual liver function. A retrospective study evaluating patients with recurrent HE who
achieved complete occlusion of portosystemic shunts
compared to patients who did not undergo the procedure
showed some benefits in embolization [81]. In patients with
end-stage liver disease, this treatment not only is less
effective but can also be deleterious, and therefore patients
need to be selected carefully [82]. An endovascular
approach to manage shunts is minimally invasive and may
involve occlusion of the shunt with coils or plugs, or, if
associated with varices, a balloon-occlusion retrograde
trans-venous obliteration technique may be used to obliterate both [83].
AST-120
AST-120 involves the use of orally administered microspherical carbon, which exhibits a selective adsorbent
profile, adsorbing small molecules such as ammonia. A
study on rodents with CLF treated with AST-120 indicated
decreased arterial ammonia levels, normalized brain water
content and locomotor activity, but did not demonstrate an
effect on systemic oxidative stress [84]. In contrast, a study
by Bajaj et al. [85] failed to report an improvement in
CHE. A phase II trial (Ocera Therapeutics (2014) https://
S142 Hepatol Int (2018) 12 (Suppl 1):S135–S147
123

clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00867698) showed a comparable efficacy to that of lactulose in patients with mHE,
with fewer side effects, although more studies are required
for the further development of this treatment.
Probiotics
Probiotic therapies attempt to adapt the gut environment.
This is an attempt to limit the amount of ammonia produced in the colon. Patients treated with probiotics often
show lowering of blood ammonia and less severe HE,
although no significance has been shown [86]. Additionally, a systematic review of nine randomized control trials
(RCTs) concluded that probiotics were associated with
improvement in mHE, prophylaxis of OHE and reduction
in severe adverse events [87]. The use of probiotics in
secondary prophylaxis was also evaluated in an open-label
RCT, dividing 235 patients into probiotic, lactulose or no
therapy groups [88]. Both lactulose and probiotics were
more effective than no treatment, although there was no
significant difference between them. Despite the lack of
significance in this data, there seems to be no adverse
consequence of using these treatments. Finally, a recent
meta-analysis has shown that, overall, the use of probiotics
was more effective in decreasing hospitalization rates,
improving mHE and preventing progression to OHE than
placebo, while the use of probiotics did not affect mortality
rates. However, given the huge variability in the type and
composition of probiotics and the lack of validation studies, its use is not routinely recommended for patients with
HE.
Nutrition and branched-chain amino acids
Malnutrition can lead to a paradoxical increase in ammonia
and decreased survival by influencing protein turnover
[89], increasing susceptibility to infections, impairing
immunocompetence [90] and inducing malabsorption [91].
It is believed that maintaining muscle mass in patients is
important, since it has the ability to remove ammonia from
circulation, while patients administered with enough protein observed a beneficial effect in the management of
hyperammonemia and HE [92].
Administration of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)
is believed to help improve nutrition and may be effective
in HE treatment. However, BCAA have paradoxically been
seen to increase blood ammonia levels [93]. It is recommended that BCAA be used only by patients who are
severely protein-intolerant. If given, BCAA should be
administered orally, as opposed to intravenous treatment
which may result in lower gut glutaminase activity [56]. A
meta-analysis of eight trials conducted by Gluud et al. [94]
concluded that oral BCAA improved manifestations of HE
but showed no effect on overall mortality or nutrition status. Once again, there is not enough evidence through
clinical trials for these treatments to be used consistently
with confidence, and they usually just act as complimentary
treatments.
As increased GABA-ergic neurotransmission has been
implicated in neuronal inhibition associated with HE, the
efficacy of utilizing benzodiazepine receptor antagonists to
treat HE has been evaluated in several RCTs. A metaanalysis of 6 RCTs with a total of 641 patients found that
flumazenil (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) treatment
versus placebo resulted in significant clinical improvement
of HE (odds ratio = 6.15; 95% CI 4.0–9.5; p\0.001), but
the trials were limited by very short follow-up period, a
maximum 72 h in 2 trials and less in the rest [95.] A
Cochrane review analyzed 13 randomized trials (2 of
which were included in the previous meta-analysis) with a
total of 805 patients comparing flumazenil versus placebo
[96.] Flumazenil was associated with only short-term
improvement in HE (risk difference 0.28; 95% CI
0.20–0.37) with no significant effects on recovery from HE
or survival. Short-term benefit of flumazenil with the
absence of prolonged effects is not unsurprising given its
short elimination half-life (0.7–1.3 h), and thus it is not
currently advocated for routine clinical use to treat HE.
L-Carnitine plays a key role in mitochondrial energy
metabolism by facilitating carriage of long-chain fatty acids
from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix and in
portocaval-shunted rats shown to have a protective effect
against hyperammonaemia [97]. A meta-analysis of 7 RCTs,
including 660 patients with HE grade ranging from subclinical to grade 3, found L-Carnitine to reduce ammonia
levels, with associated improvement in HE [98]. However,
all 7 RCTs were performed at a single center and were of
small to moderate size. Although the results are encouraging,
further larger multi-center studies are required before routine
use of L-carnitine for HE can be advocated.
Treatment with plasma exchange can modulate systemic
inflammation in ALF, leading to improved outcomes, and it
is associated with improvement in cerebral oxygen and
improved HE [99]. However, in the largest trial of plasma
exchange for ALF, no significant difference was noted in
intracranial pressure between the two groups, likely
because of under-powering as only 16 patients had
intracranial pressure measured, with no further details
about improvement in HE [100].
Future approaches
Whereas liver transplantation is the most effective treatment
available, it is not always an option. There are a few treatments still in the experimental phase which hold future
promise for the therapy of HE (Table 3) such as
Hepatol Int (2018) 12 (Suppl 1):S135–S147 S143
123

Minocycline, which reduces microglial cell activation in
cerebral insult and results in a reduction of brain edema as
well as plasma and CSF ammonia levels. Ibuprofen has been
shown to restore the function of the glutamate–nitric oxide–
cyclic guanine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in cerebral
cortex and learning ability in portocaval-shunted rats.
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil can also be
beneficial in chronic HE. Indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of
3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a key enzyme responsible for the synthesis of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and
tetradehydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) (potent selective positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptors),
has been shown to attenuate brain production of ALLO and
THDOC and to improve activity in animals with CLF and
mild HE [101]. It is important to note that non-steroidal antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen and indomethacin would
need to be used extremely cautiously in cirrhotics due to their
effects on other systems such as renal function. Benzodiazepine inverse agonists such as Ro15-4513 have also been
shown to be effective in the treatment of HE in animal
models of acute [102] or chronic liver failure [103]. Finally, a
phase II study is currently underway investigating whether
fecal microbiota transplantation can reverse HE in cirrhotic
patients with episodic HE despite maintenance therapy with
lactulose and/or rifaximin. Additionally, a small study performed recently reported beneficial effects of this treatment
in the management of HE [104]. Despite the new and interesting treatments arising, it is essential for the current
treatments used in clinics to be well understood and also to
undergo regulated studies before their use on patients.
Conclusions
In the past 20–30 years, there has been rapid progress in
understanding the pathophysiological basis of HE. Many new
strategies are addressing the issue of hyperammonemia but the
lack of direct correlation between ammonia levels and the
severity of HE makes it difficult to select patients for liver
transplantation. The results of the Phase IIb study of OP are
awaited, as it will provide the first evidence of the role of
ammonia in patients with an acute episode of HE on the
background of CLF. The recently defined entity of ACLF and
the identification that this entity is distinct from acute decompensation has huge implicationsfor the selection of HE patients
for clinical trials. Finally, treatment of mHE remains a huge
unmet need and a huge concerted effort is needed to better
definethis condition to allow the development of newtherapies.
