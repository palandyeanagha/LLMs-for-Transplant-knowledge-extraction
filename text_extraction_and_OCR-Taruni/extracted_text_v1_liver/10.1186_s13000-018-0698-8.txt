Abstract
Background: Hepatic steatosis renders hepatocytes vulnerable to injury, resulting in the progression of preexisting
liver disease. Previous animal and cell culture studies implicated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), signal
transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and estrogen-receptor
α in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis and disease progression. However, to date there have been few studies
performed using human liver tissue to study hepatic steatosis. We examined the expression patterns of mTOR,
STAT3, ERK and estrogen-receptor α in liver tissues from patients diagnosed with hepatic steatosis.
Methods: We reviewed the clinical and histomorphological features of 29 patients diagnosed with hepatic steatosis: 18
with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 11 with alcoholic fatty acid disease (AFLD), and a control group (16 biliary
cysts and 22 hepatolithiasis). Immunohistochemistry was performed on liver tissue using an automated immunostainer.
The histologic severity of hepatic steatosis was evaluated by assessing four key histomorphologic parameters common
to NAFLD and AFLD: steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning degeneration and fibrosis.
Results: mTOR, phosphorylated STAT3, phosphorylated pERK, estrogen-receptor α were found to be more frequently
expressed in the hepatic steatosis group than in the control group. Specifically, mTOR was expressed in 78% of
hepatocytes, and ERK in 100% of hepatic stellate cells, respectively, in patients with NAFLD. Interestingly, estrogenreceptor α was diffusely expressed in hepatocytes in all NALFD cases. Phosphorylated (active) STAT3 was expressed
in 73% of hepatocytes and 45% of hepatic stellate cells in patients with AFLD, and phosphorylated (active) ERK was
expressed in hepatic stellate cells in all AFLD cases. Estrogen-receptor α was expressed in all AFLD cases (focally
in 64% of AFLD cases, and diffusely in 36%). Phosphorylated STAT3 expression in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate
cells correlated with severe lobular inflammation, severe ballooning degeneration and advanced fibrosis, whereas
diffusely expressed estrogen-receptor α correlated with a mild stage of fibrosis.
Conclusions: Our data indicate ERK activation and estrogen-receptor α may be relevant in the development of
hepatic steatosis. However, diffuse expression of estrogen-receptor α would appear to impede disease progression,
including hepatic fibrosis. Finally, phosphorylated STAT3 may also contribute to disease progression.

Background
Hepatic steatosis is a frequent histological finding in
liver biopsy specimens. The causes of hepatic steatosis
include obesity, excessive alcohol intake, chronic autoimmune diseases, Wilson’s disease, hepatitis C virus and
certain pharmacological drugs [1]. Increasing evidence
indicates that hepatic steatosis enhances hepatocellular
susceptibility to additional injuries, eventually leading to
hepatic fibrosis [2]. The molecular factors contributing
to hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular damage, and hepatic
fibrosis have been studied, but their action mechanisms
are still not fully resolved.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls
lipid biosynthesis via various effector molecules, such as
sterol regulatory element-binding protein like-1c (SREBP-1c)
[3] which engages in the development of hepatic steatosis
[4]. mTOR, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) all
belong to downstream mediators of leptin signaling [5–7],
and it has been shown that leptin plays a crucial role in
hepatic lipid regulation [8]. In cell experiments, signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) has
been shown to be required for IL-6-mediated activation
of hepatic stellate cells, eventually resulting in hepatic
fibrosis [9]. Also, the kinases, including extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), are activated early in liver
injury, and then led to hepatic fibrosis of rats [10]. In
addition, estrogen is a steroid hormone that preserves
hepatic lipid hemostasis by acting via estrogen-receptor α
[11, 12]. Animal and cell culture studies suggest estrogen
prevents hepatic fibrosis by blocking lipid peroxidation
and production of reactive oxygen species [13].
To date, the cellular localization and expression patterns
for leptin signaling proteins and estrogen-receptor α have
not been collectively determined in liver tissue, and specifically in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. Hepatic stellate
cells line the perisinusoidal space, and are located between
hepatocytes and the sinusoidal endothelium [14]. When
activated by liver injury, these cells newly express α-smooth
muscle actin and transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like
cells, which form the extracellular matrix that leads to
hepatic fibrosis [14–16].
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic
fatty liver disease (AFLD) are two common causes of
chronic liver disease worldwide [17]. Although managed
differently [18], NAFLD and AFLD possess similar histomorphologic features (e.g., macrovesicular steatosis, lobular
inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning degeneration)
[19–21] and a similar course of disease progression
(simple steatosis followed by steatohepatitis, fibrosis,
and micronodular cirrhosis) [21–23]. They have shared
and disease-specific mechanisms of lipid accumulation,
and their pathogenesis includes oxidative stress, iron
deposition, overexpression of cytochrome P450E1, and
involvement of endotoxins and tumor necrosis factor α
[19–21]. Oxidative stress induces expression of lipid
metabolism-associated transcription factors (e.g., SREBP-1c)
that regulate de novo fatty acid synthesis [4]. Diseasespecific mechanisms include augmented lipolysis in adipose
tissue and consequent increases in circulating free fatty
acid levels in NAFLD, but not in AFLD [20]. The major
substrate of cytochrome P450E1 is excessive free fatty acids
in NAFLD and ethanol in AFLD [4, 19, 24].
Here, we evaluated the clinical and histomorphologic
features and expression patterns of mTOR, phosphorylated
STAT3 (pSTAT3), phosphorylated ERK (pERK) and
estrogen-receptor α in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells
in liver tissue from patients with hepatic steatosis, along
with a control group (biliary cysts and hepatolithiasis). Our
goal was to determine the roles these proteins might play
in the development of hepatic steatosis.
Methods
Patients and liver tissues
This retrospective study comprised 29 patients with hepatic
steatosis; 18 diagnosed with NAFLD and 11 diagnosed with
AFLD. Patients were selected from the electronic database
of the Department of Pathology, Seoul National University
Boramae Hospital. Information in the database was
obtained from needle biopsies of liver tissue during
2005–2011. Diagnoses were based on clinicopathological
correlations, the results of a serologic test of liver function,
causes of the liver dysfunction, a history of alcohol intake,
and histomorphologic evaluation of liver tissue biopsies
[25, 26]. Inclusion criterion for liver biopsies was a tissue
specimen > 1 cm in length without fragmentation or >
10 portal tracts with macrovesicular steatosis in > 5% of
hepatocytes.
Results of a serologic test of liver function were
regarded as abnormal if aspartate transaminase (AST) or
alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were each > 40 U/L
and total bilirubin levels were > 1.2 mg/dL. Body mass
index (BMI) was determined as body weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared. According to the
revised World Health Organization criteria for obesity in
the Asia Pacific region, BMIs > 25, 23–24.9, 18.5–22.9,
and < 18.5 correspond to obesity, overweight, normal
heathy weight, and underweight, respectively [27].
Alcoholic fatty liver disease was considered if alcohol
consumption was excessive (> 30 g/day for men and >
20 g/day for women) as per each patient’s self-reporting
and interviews with family members.
To better understand protein expression patterns in
non-neoplastic hepatocytes, we used a control group
composed of surgically resected liver tissue from 16 cases
of biliary cysts and 22 cases of hepatolithiasis (without
steatosis, fibrosis or dysplasia).

Histomorphologic assessment
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples
were microsectioned and stained with both hematoxylin
and eosin and Masson’s trichrome stain. Diagnoses of
NAFLD and AFLD were based on clinical features and
pathological criteria [23, 25, 26]. Common histomorphologic
features of NAFLD and AFLD include the four core features
of steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning degeneration,
and fibrosis, all of which were assessed using the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH
CRN) NAFLD activity score (NAS) system [26] and the
descriptive system proposed for alcoholic liver disease [23].
NAFLD was also sub-classified as significant or mild using
the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis (SAF) scoring system [28].
The SAF and NASH CRN NAS systems apply similar
criteria when determining grades and scores for steatosis,
activity and fibrosis. The main difference is the evaluation
criteria of ballooning degeneration; SAF system puts the
size and number of the enlarged cells into consideration
while the NASH CRN system considers only the number
of enlarged cells [29].
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed using an automated Ventana Benchmark XT immunostainer (Ventana
BenchMark XT; Ventana Medical Systems Inc., Tucson,
AZ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, 3-μm-thick tissue sections were placed on electrostatic charged glass slides, deparaffinized, and subjected to
antigen retrieval. The antigen was detected using ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit (Ventana Medical
Systems Inc.). For double staining, an ultraView Universal
Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection Kit (Ventana Medical
Systems Inc.) was used. The following primary antibodies
were used at the following dilutions: mTOR (49F9, 1:50;
Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), pSTAT3 (1:50; Cell
Signaling), pERK1/2 (44/42 MAPK, Thr 202/Tyr 204)
(E10, 1:50; Cell Signaling), estrogen-receptor α (SP1, ready
to use; Ventana Medical Systems Inc.), and α-smooth
muscle actin (1A4, 1:500; Labvision, Fremont, CA, USA).
For negative controls, each antibody was replaced with
phosphate-buffered saline.
For mTOR and the phosphorylated (i.e., active) forms
of STAT3 and ERK, nuclear staining was evaluated and
considered positive when ≥10% of hepatocytes, or any of the
hepatic stellate cells, were stained. For estrogen-receptor α
expression, the area of positively stained hepatic nuclei was
categorized as 1 (< 10%), 2 (10–50%), or 3 (> 50%), and
staining intensity was graded as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3
(strong). A total score (1 to 9) was calculated by multiplying
area and intensity scores. Estrogen-receptor α expression
was also defined as negative, focal, or diffuse (scores of 1,
2–4, and 6–9, respectively). α-smooth muscle actin was used
as a marker for hepatic stellate cells [13, 14].
Statistical analysis
Statistical differences were analyzed using the chi-square
test or Fisher’s exact test (2-sided) for categorical variables,
and the Mann-Whitney U test or analysis of variance
for continuous variables. P values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM Inc., Armonk,
NY, USA).
Results
Clinical and histomorphologic features of hepatic steatosis
Clinical and histomorphologic characteristics of patients
with hepatic steatosis and a control group (biliary cysts
and hepatolithiasis cases without steatosis, fibrosis or
dysplasia) are summarized in Table 1. Most NAFLD
patients were obese, whereas 55% of AFLD patients
were of normal weight (P = 0.001). An AST/ALT ratio ≤
2 was more often observed in the NAFLD group than
the AFLD group, but the difference was not statistically
significant. The NAFLD group showed milder histomorphologic features in lobular inflammation, ballooning
degeneration and fibrosis than the AFLD group (P < 0.05,
respectively). Representative histomorphologic features
are shown in Fig. 1.
Protein expression patterns in hepatic steatosis
The hepatic steatosis group frequently showed more
positive expression of proteins than the control group
(P < 0.05 for the most proteins). The only exception to
this trend was pSTAT3 in hepatic stellate cells which
showed marginal expression differences (P = 0.055) (Table 2).
In detail, hepatic mTOR was expressed in 78% of NAFLD
cases. Of interest, estrogen-receptor α expression was
diffusely positive in all NAFLD cases. NAFLD cases
were also characterized by low (hepatocytes, 17%) or no
(hepatic stellate cells) pSTAT3 expression, and low
(hepatocytes, 22%) or predominant (hepatic stellate
cells, 100%) pERK expression. Notably, in AFLD,
pSTAT3 was often observed in both hepatocytes (73%)
and hepatic stellate cells (45%). All AFLD cases had
estrogen-receptor α-positive hepatocytes, with focal
positivity in 64% of cases and diffuse positivity in 36%.
Estrogen-receptor α was not sufficiently expressed to
be considered positive by immunohistochemical evaluation in the non-neoplastic hepatocytes of the control
group (biliary cyst and hepatolithiasis cases without
hepatic steatosis, fibrosis or dysplasia). Representative
immunohistochemical features can be seen in Fig. 2.
We observed non-specific cytoplasmic or membranous
staining of mTOR in non-neoplastic hepatocytes in all
hepatic steatosis and control cases. Hence, only mTOR
staining in the nucleus was evaluated.

Relationship between protein expression and histologic
severity in hepatic steatosis
Expression of pSTAT3 in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate
cells significantly correlated with severe histologic features
(e.g., severe lobular inflammation, severe ballooning inflammation, and advanced stage of fibrosis; P < 0.05, respectively) (Table 3). In contrast, diffuse nuclear expression of
estrogen-receptor α in hepatocytes correlated with mild
histologic features (P < 0.05). There was no statistical relationship between pERK expression and histologic severity,
although there was a near significant relationship (P =
0.083) between pERK expression and lobular inflammation
in hepatic stellate cells.
Using the NASH CRN and SAF histologic scoring systems, we classified NAFLD as mild, severe, or significant.
Ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation were
significantly increased in severity in patients with either
severe or significant NAFLD when compared to those
with mild NAFLD (P < 0.05, respectively) (Additional file 1).
However, it should be noted that there was no difference
in protein expression between the severe/significant
subgroup and the mild subgroup.

Discussion
The present study identifies pSTAT3 as a potential marker
of histologic severity in hepatic steatosis. pSTAT3 may be
required in disease progression of hepatic steatosis. Our
data showed that pSTAT3 expression in hepatocytes and
hepatic stellate cells correlated significantly with severe
lobular inflammation, severe ballooning degeneration, and
advanced fibrosis. These pSTAT3 results are in agreement
with previous animal and cell culture studies in which
interleukin-6 promoted liver inflammation by activating
hepatic STAT3 [30]. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report of pSTAT3 expression in the liver tissue of
hepatic steatosis patients.
Previous studies also found that STAT3 activation in
hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells lead to hepatic fibrosis
[31–35]. Here, STAT3 mediated the effects of leptin via
collagen gene activation in a liver fibrogenesis mouse
model [31, 32]. STAT3 may promote hepatic fibrosis
[36, 37] through the upregulation of tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinases-1 [33, 34] and transforming factor-ß
expression [37]. On the other hand, repression of STAT3
expression was found to exacerbate liver inflammation in
interleukin-10-deficient mice [38] and accelerate hepatic
fibrosis during cholestasis [39]. Further study will be required to determine if there might be condition-specific
feedback loops that enhance or inhibit STAT3 function.
In hepatic steatosis with severe or advanced histomorphologic features, we found estrogen-receptor α expression
was focal rather than diffuse. Our data suggest that diffuse
expression of estrogen-receptor α may actually have a
protective effect against disease progression, potentially
by serving as a hepatic receptor for estradiol [40],
which inhibits the generation of reactive oxygen species
and suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation, resulting
in reduced proliferation and collagen production [13, 41].
Protective effects of estrogen in patients with hepatic
fibrosis have been reported by others [41]. Moreover, an
estradiol study where mice were administered a high-fat
diet plus ethanol suggested that an estrogen conjugate
might benefit both NAFLD and AFLD patients [42].
However, reports showing the expression patterns of
estrogen-receptor α in human hepatic nuclei are rare [43].
Our data indicates that both pERK in hepatic stellate
cells and estrogen-receptor α in hepatocytes may be
linked to the development of hepatic steatosis. pERK
was expressed in hepatic stellate cells in all hepatic
steatosis cases examined. Previous studies of rodent liver
tissue also implicate pERK in the development of hepatic
steatosis, as well as steatohepatitis [44–46]. Moreover,
pERK signaling in activated hepatic stellate cells was
pro-fibrogenic in NAFLD [15] and AFLD [47] patients
in previous studies. Estrogen-receptor α was sufficiently
expressed in all NAFLD and AFLD cases. In chicken
primary hepatocytes, estrogen enhanced hepatic fatty
acid synthesis [48]. In NAFLD patients with elevated
serum estrogen levels [11], estrogen entered hepatocytes,
resulting in the translocation of ligand-bound estrogenreceptors to the nucleus [49]. Serum estrogen levels are
known to be elevated in alcoholic men [50], perhaps
owing, at least in part, to the presence of biologically active
phytoestrogen (derived from plant-based ingredients such
as grains, fruits, and hops) in alcoholic beverages [51].
To our knowledge, this is the first report of mTOR
nuclear expression in human liver tissue. mTOR was
previously believed to localize exclusively to the cytoplasm; however, recent reports document its presence in
multiple intracellular compartments, including the nucleus,
as well as shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus.
However, a specific nuclear function for mTOR has yet to
be established [51–53].
This retrospective study does have some limitations.
First, many of the NAFLD patients were young men at lessadvanced disease stage. This reflects the inclusion of men
who underwent medical check-ups prior to mandatory
military service in Korea; our hospital is among the institutions providing official health documentation. Second, it
was not determined whether mTOR, STAT3 and ERK
belong to leptin signaling pathways. Leptin and leptinreceptor antibodies used in this study did not specifically
recognize their target antigens in human liver tissue. This
occurred despite previous use of these antibodies to specifically detect leptin and leptin-receptor in the hepatocellular
carcinoma (Additional file 2), breast, biliary tract, appendix
and stomach [54, 55].
Conclusions
Here we have shown that pSTAT3 expression correlates
with severe histomorphologic features in hepatic steatosis, and suggest that diffuse expression of estrogenreceptor α may lessen severity. Hence, both proteins
may play a role in mechanisms of disease progression in
patients with hepatic steatosis. Our results also implicate
pERK and estrogen-receptor α in the development of
hepatic steatosis. How these proteins modulate the disease development process is, however, unclear and warrants further study.
