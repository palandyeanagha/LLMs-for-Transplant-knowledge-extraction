The human body is bordered by the skin and mucosa, which are the cellular barriers that
define the frontier between the internal milieu and the external nonsterile environment.
Additional cellular barriers, such as the placental and the blood–brain barriers, define protected niches within the host. In addition to their physiological roles, these host barriers
provide both physical and immune defense against microbial infection. Yet, many pathogens
have evolved elaborated mechanisms to target this line of defense, resulting in a microbial
invasion of cells constitutive of host barriers, disruption of barrier integrity, and systemic
dissemination and invasion of deeper tissues. Here we review representative examples of
microbial interactions with human barriers, including the intestinal, placental, and blood–
brain barriers, and discuss how these microbes adhere to, invade, breach, or compromise
these barriers.
INVASIVE PATHOGENS AND HOST BARRIER
Acritical event in systemic infection is the
crossing by its causative agent of one or
multiple host barriers (Fig. 1). It can schematically occur according to two nonexclusive
scenarios: (i) the barrier function of a tissue
can be compromised either by physical means
(wound, catheter, surgery, arthropod bite) or in
the context of a host condition that disrupts
the integrity of tissues (inflammation, dysfunction of a host gene product implicated in barrier function), and this barrier damage allows
microbial invasion; (ii) barrier(s) can also be
crossed actively, via the direct action of microbial gene products that mediates microbial adhesion to and translocation across cells constitutive of host barriers.
ENTEROPATHOGENS AND THE INTESTINAL
BARRIER

separate the host from its external nonsterile

environment. The intestinal barrier is made of
a monolayer of polarized epithelial cells called
enterocytes. Tight junctions (TJs) and adherens
junctions (AJs) hold together enterocytes. TJs
are the most apical structures and are made of
transmembrane proteins (occludins, claudins,
junction adhesion molecules [JAMs], and the
coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor [CAR]),
connected to intracellular proteins (such as ZO1, -2, -3, MAGUK, and PAR family proteins).
TJs prevent paracellular diffusion of molecules
or luminal microorganisms (Anderson et al.
2004). AJs are required for the integrity of TJs
and are located directly below them (Harris and
Tepass 2010). They are made of E-cadherin,
which is connected to the actin cytoskeleton.
AJs and TJs are located at the apical and luminal
side of enterocytes. Their basolateral side seats
on a basement membrane made of extracellular
matrix proteins, which separate them from the
lamina propria, that contains connective tissue,
stromal cells, blood and lymphatic capillaries,
and cellular effectors of the immune system,
such as lymphocytes, dendritic cells, or resident
macrophages, some of which are in direct contact with enterocytes and the intestinal lumen
via extending dendrites (Rescigno and Di Sabatino 2009).
The intestinal epithelium apical surface delineates the interface between the host and the
intestinal lumen. The intestinal barrier is in continuous contact and crosstalk with up to 1014
microorganisms, which constitute the intestinal microbiota. It represents a major potential
portal entry for microbes into the host. Microbial pathogens have evolved specific capacities
to adhere to, invade, or disrupt the intestinal
barrier (Sousa et al. 2005; Guttman and Finlay

2009; Yoshida et al. 2011). These pathogens have
to counteract host defenses and competition
from the resident microflora in the gut. Microbes can cross epithelial barriers by disrupting
intercellular junctions or by interacting with epithelial cell receptors, leading to the traversal in a
transcellular or paracellular route. Pathogens
may also take advantage of the luminal sampling
property of host cells to get access to the lamina
propria.
Disruption of Tight Junctions
by Enteropathogens
Intestinal pathogens may adhere to the apical
surface of enterocytes, remain extracellular, and
modify the barrier properties of the epithelium.
This event can lead to local invasion of the lamina propria. Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC) are diarrheagenic bacteria (Wong et al. 2011) that affect
TJs (occluding and ZO-1) through type-III secretion system (TTSS) effectors EspF, Map, and
EspG (Dean and Kenny 2004; Matsuzawa et al.
2005), leading to a decreased transepithelial resistance and aberrant TJs. Helicobacter pylori expresses several adhesins that mediate bacterial
attachment to gastric epithelial glycan receptors,
and possesses a type-IV secretion system that
injects the multifunctional bacterial effector
CagA into the host cell cytoplasm (Rieder et al.
2005). CagA alters the composition and the
function of TJs (Amieva et al. 2003) and leads
to a disruption of the epithelial polarity, which
could have a role in H. pylori-associated carcinogenesis (Saadat et al. 2007).
Toxin A and toxin B from Clostridium
difficile are both implicated in the pathogenesis of pseudomembranous colitis (Kuehne et al.
2010). They dissociate TJ’s proteins occludin,
ZO-1 and ZO-2, thus increasing intestinal epithelium permeability (Voth and Ballard 2005).
The bifunctional enterotoxin CPE of Clostridium perfringens, which can cause diarrhea, forms
pores in the host cell plasma membrane, and
binds claudin-3 and claudin-4 with high affinity (Sonoda et al. 1999; Winkler et al. 2009;
Robertson et al. 2010), inducing their degradation, a decrease in transepithelial resistance
and disruption of TJs. The role of claudins in
the barrier function of TJs was discovered via
these studies (Sonoda et al. 1999).
Rotavirus, member of the Reovirus family
causing gastroenteritis, also colonizes the gut
and disrupts tight junctions. VP8 subunit of
VP4, an outer rotavirus protein, moves ZO-1,
claudin-3, and occludin from TJs, then disrupting the barrier integrity (Nava et al. 2004; Beau
et al. 2007). Similar effects are produced by the
viral enterotoxin NSP4, which blocks the formation of TJs by preventing lateral recruitment
of ZO-1 (Tafazoli et al. 2001). Reoviruses use the
TJ protein JAM-1 as a cellular receptor (Barton
et al. 2001). The viral surface protein s1 directly
interacts with the amino-terminal domain of
JAM-1 and disrupts the homodimers of this
junction protein (Forrest et al. 2003; Campbell
et al. 2005; Guglielmi et al. 2007).
Active Microbial Crossing of the
Intestinal Barrier
Translocation across Enterocytes
Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterium that crosses the intestinal, blood –
brain and placental barriers, inducing gastroenteritis, meningitis/encephalitis, and maternofetal infection. InlA and InlB, two surface proteins of L. monocytogenes, which interact with
their respective host receptors E-cadherin and
Met, induce internalization of L. monocytogenes
into cultured epithelial cells. Importantly, in
contrast to human E-cadherin, mouse E-cadherin is unable to interact with InlA and to promote L. monocytogenes entry into cells (Lecuit
et al. 1999, 2001). This species specificity relies
on the sixteenth amino acid of the mature Ecadherin, a proline in humans, and a glutamic
acid in mice. E-cadherin from guinea pig is also
recognized by InlA and harbors a proline at position 16. In this species, contrary to the mouse,
L. monocytogenes is able to cross the intestinal
barrier, disseminate systemically, and induce a
dose- and InlA-dependent lethality (Lecuit et al.
2001). To prove the role of the InlA–E-cadherin
interaction in the ability of L. monocytogenes to
cross the intestinal barrier, a transgenic mouse
model expressing human E-cadherin in postCross-Host Barriers

mitotic nonproliferative small intestinal enterocytes was designed (Lecuit et al. 2001). In contrast to nontransgenic mice, and similarly to
guinea pigs and humans, transgenic mice expressing human E-cadherin are highly permissive to orally acquired listeriosis, demonstrating
a critical role for InlA in the ability of L. monocytogenes to cross the intestinal barrier. Epidemiological study of human cases of listeriosis
evidence supports this result, because clinical
strains express a functional InlA significantly
more often (96%) than food isolates do (65%)
(Jacquet et al. 2004), which is in favor of a role of
InlA in crossing the intestinal barrier in humans.
In contrast to the InlA–E-cadherin interaction,
the InlB –Met interaction is not necessary for
crossing the intestinal barrier in transgenic
mice, as well as in gerbil, which is permissive
for InlA and InlB (Khelef et al. 2006; Disson
et al. 2008). The way by which L. monocytogenes
gets access to the adherens junction protein Ecadherin and the mechanism by which bacteria
cross the intestinal barrier were not known until
recently. It had been proposed that L. monocytogenes access to E-cadherin may be facilitated
when extruding epithelial cells detach from the
tips of intestinal microvilli, thereby exposing Ecadherin to the luminal side of the intestine
(Pentecost et al. 2006). This was shown in vitro
and correlated with a colocalization of bacteria
with extruding cells in rabbit ileal loop in vivo. It
has now been shown that E-cadherin is luminally accessible not only around extruding enterocytes at the tip and lateral sides of villi, but
also particularly around mucus-expelling goblet cells (GCs) and in villus epithelial folds. L.
monocytogenes preferentially adheres to accessible E-cadherin on GCs in a ligated loop of transgenic mice expressing human E-cadherin, is
internalized, rapidly transcytosed across the intestinal epithelium, and released in the lamina
propria by exocytosis fromwhere it disseminates
systemically (Nikitas et al. 2011). L. monocytogenes is thus able to exploit intrinsic tissue heterogeneity to access its receptor. These results
highlight transcytosis as an unexpected pathway
that is hijacked by L. monocytogenes to breach
the intestinal barrier and cause systemic infection. The precise mechanism by which L. monocytogenes transcytoses across enterocytes is currently being investigated.
Some viral species also use basolateral cell
adhesion molecules as receptors to infect epithelia. The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor
(CAR) is a component of the tight junction,
which is located under the classical TJ proteins
(occludin and claudin) and is thus inaccessible
to viruses that contact host cells via their apical
surface (Freimuth et al. 2008). As indicated by
its name, it is both targeted by adenovirus and
coxsackieviruses, leading to a decrease in epithelial impermeability (Bergelson et al. 1997). Coxsackieviruses B are members of the Enterovirus
family and the causative agents of meningitis
and myocarditis. Coxsackievirus-B infects polarized cell layers through binding to the decay-accelerating factor (DAF) proteins on the
apical cell surface (Coyne and Bergelson 2006).
Virus attachment to DAF leads to the activation
of the src kinase Abl, inducing a Rac-dependent
reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that
enables the viruses to relocalize to tight junctions. Once in the junction, viral particles interact with CAR, and are internalized in caveolar
vesicles, a mechanism dependent on the activation of Fyn kinase by DAF (Coyne and Bergelson 2006). Internalization of coxsackievirus-B
also requires the TJ protein occludin (Coyne
et al. 2007). The subsequent release from epithelial cells has been suggested to occur through a
calcium signal and calpain-dependent necrosis
of the infected cells (Bozym et al. 2011).
Host Cell Sensing of Intestinal Lumen Content
as an Achilles’ Heel Exploited by Microbes
M cells, which are specialized epithelial cells
located at the Peyer’s patch level and in villi
and CD11cþCX3CR1high cells, continuously
sample the intestinal lumen and transport antigens to the mucosal lymphoid tissues (Rescigno
2011). This process is required to either induce
tolerance or to initiate immune responses. However, many microbes exploit M cells as an Achilles’ heel to enter the lamina propria, including
enteroviruses, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella
flexneri, and Salmonella enterica (Corr et al.
2008).

S. enterica causes severe diseases in humans,
ranging from gastroenteritis to systemic infections (typhoid fever). Systemic infections because of Salmonella serovars are species-specific:
S. enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) induce typhoid fever, a systemic infection in human,
whereas S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.
Typhimurium), which induces a self-limited
gastroenteritis in immunocompetent humans,
but causes a typhoid-like systemic infection
in mice. For this reason, mice have been widely
used to study typhoid fever (Monack et al.
2004), although they are generally more resistant than humans to intestinal colonization by
S. enterica. To circumvent this limitation, a streptomycin pretreated mouse model of enterocolitis has been developed that allows probing the
host and bacterial factors contributing to intestinal immunopathology (Grassl and Finlay
2008). After oral ingestion, S. Typhimurium invades intestinal tissues and induces mucosal inflammation. It may enter the blood circulation
and infect downstream organs such as liver and
spleen (Watson and Holden 2010). S. Typhimurium exploits both dendritic cells and M cells to
access the lamina propria. It was shown that, in
the terminal ileum of mice, CD11cþ (mainly
CX3CR1high) lamina propria monocytic phagocytes extend protrusions across the epithelium,
which facilitates pathogen transport from the
gut lumen into the lamina propria (Rescigno
et al. 2001; Niess et al. 2005; Chieppa et al.
2006). DCs may then allow the clearance of
the pathogen, but in an immunocompromised
host may lead to the subsequent colonization of
deeper organs. However, sampling by DCs alone
does not account for the translocation of S. Typhimurium to the lamina propria (Hapfelmeier
et al. 2008). S. Typhimurium is also able to
translocate through M cells to access Peyer’s
patches lamina propria (Jones et al. 1994). The
glycoprotein 2 (GP2), specifically expressed on
the apical plasma membrane of M cells, recognizes FimH, a component of type-I pili expressed by Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli and S. Typhimurium, which allows the
internalization of these bacteria (Hase et al.
2009). Another protein, encoded by lpf from
the fimbrial operon, interacts with mouse M
cells (Baumler et al. 1996). Once attached, Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1), which
codes for bacterial proteins translocated into
target cells by the SPI-1 type-III secretion system (TTSS-1), promotes bacterial invasion
of mouse M cells (Clark et al. 1998). S. Typhimurium may also cross the intestinal barrier
through the epithelial cells in an SPI-1 dependent manner. Recently, the mechanism by
which S. Typhimurium crosses the epithelial
barrier at the cecal level and is released in the
lamina propria has been studied in detail (Muller et al. 2012). It has been shown by use of in
vivo confocal microscopy in a murine Salmonella–diarrhea model that the breaching of the
epithelial barrier relies on both TTSS-1-mediated invasion and TTSS-2-dependent transcytosis to the basolateral side. Once in the lamina
propria, the bacterium is transiently extracellular before being phagocytized, among others
by CD11cþCX3CR1high monocytic phagocytes,
which enables it to colonize the lamina propria.
S. Typhimurium may then exploit the immune
surveillance after crossing the epithelial barrier
to infect its host.
Paracellular Pathway
Pathogens such as parasites (Entamoeba histolytica and Toxoplasma gondii) (Yoshida et al.
2011) or bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae) have
been proposed to cross the intestinal barrier in a
paracellular route. This serves to target intercellular junctions and to actively propel between
two cell membranes. Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) is
a human parasite with the capacity to actively
cross not only the intestinal barrier but also the
blood–brain and placental barriers (Barragan
and Sibley 2003). Tg parasites have been shown
to accumulate around intercellular junctions.
They may use the paracellular route to cross
epithelial barriers without altering the barrier
permeability. Crossing may occur through the
interaction of the Tg surface adhesin MIC2 with
the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), which is present in the apical surfaces of
epithelial barriers (Barragan et al. 2005) and
requires the motility property of the parasite
(Barragan and Sibley 2002). Tg has to be interCross-Host Barriers

nalized by host cells to replicate, and its entry
and the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole
depend on the association of its apical tip with
the host cell through the parasite transmembrane protein AMA1, and a subsequent rearrangement of the host and Tg cytoskeletons.
This allows the parasite to replicate at the intestinal level, and could also be the first step for
the invasion of downstream organs (Tyler and
Boothroyd 2011).
Streptococcus agalactiae(group B Streptococcus [GBS]) is a normal constituent of the intestinal microflora and the major cause of human
neonatal meningitis. Among the GBS clones,
ST-17 is strongly associated with meningitis in
infants. It has been shown that a ST-17-specific
surface-anchored protein called hypervirulent
GBS adhesin (HvgA) is required for intestinal
colonization and translocation across the intestinal barrier and the blood–brain barrier (BBB),
leading to meningitis (Tazi et al. 2010). The
mechanism by which the ST-17 clone crosses
the intestinal barrier is still unknown. However,
previous data suggest that the paracellular route
could be a way for GBS to cross epithelial barriers. Using differentiated epithelial cells grown
on Transwell inserts as a model, it has been
shown by transmission electron microscopy
that GBS interacts with intercellular junctions
and has the capacity to cross the monolayer by
a paracellular mechanism via an active and transient opening of cell junctions (Soriani et al.
2006). This process depends on the pilus backbone of GBS, but the host receptors are still not
known (Pezzicoli et al. 2008). However, the
mechanism by which the ST-17 clone crosses
the intestinal barrier is currently unknown.
MICROBES AND THE PLACENTAL BARRIER
The human maternofetal barrier contains two
anatomically distinct components, the chorioallantoic placenta and the chorioamnion. The
barrier is formed at the placental level by specialized epithelial cells, the villous syncytiotrophoblasts, which are differentiated from underlying
mononuclear cytotrophoblasts. Multinucleated
syncytiotrophoblasts are in direct contact with
maternal blood circulating in the intervillous
space. A basement membrane separates these
trophoblastic cells from a connective tissue that
contains fetal capillaries. The amniotic epithelium forms the maternofetal interface in the
chorioamnion. The apical surface of this epithelium is exposed to amniotic fluid, whereas its
basal surface sits on a basement membrane that
overlies the amniotic mesoderm (Cross et al.
1994; Huppertz 2008; Maltepe et al. 2010).
A number of pathogens invade the placenta
but few are known to actively cross the placental
barrier and disseminate to the fetus. Infection
of placenta can lead to abortion, premature
delivery, and fetal and neonatal infection. Coxiella burnettii, the agent of Q fever, is an intracellular bacterium which may infect trophoblast
(Baumgartner and Bachmann 1992; Ben Amara
et al. 2010) and, in rare cases, the fetus (Carcopino et al. 2009) leading to abortion and premature delivery. Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of the malaria, has long been
known to affect pregnancy (Brabin et al. 2004).
Parasitized erythrocytes bind to chondroitin sulfate A expressed at the syncytiotrophoblast apical surface,where theyaccumulate,impeding the
physiological functions of the placenta (Scherf
et al. 2001). Adverse outcomes are low birth
weight babies,fetal loss, as well as increased perinatal and maternal mortality. Several Chlamydia
spp, such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila abortus, Chlamydophila psittaci, and Chlamydophila pneumonia are involved in adverse
pregnancy outcomes in humans and/or animals (Baud et al. 2008). These obligate intracellular bacteria have been shown to infect trophoblasts in a mouse model of infection, probably
via infected maternal neutrophils (Buendia et al.
1998).
The exact mechanism by which pathogens
may cross the placental barrier and infect the
fetus remain often elusive. The mechanisms by
which some of the microorganisms responsible
for maternofetal infections in human may cross
this barrier are described below.
Tg is responsible for congenital infection in
up to 30% of infected pregnant women, when
primary infection is acquired during pregnancy.
Tg has been shown to infect directly primary
human trophoblasts (Abbasi et al. 2003) and

extravillous trophoblasts of human ex vivo inoculated placental explants (Robbins et al.
2012), as well as trophoblasts in a rodent animal
model (Calomys callosus) (Ferro et al. 2002).
This invasion may be the critical event leading
to the infection of the fetus. Another nonexclusive hypothesis is that Tg crosses the placental
barrier in a paracellular way through the interaction between the parasite adhesin MIC2 and
ICAM-1 (Barragan et al. 2005), ICAM-1 being
up-regulated during the infection (Juliano et al.
2006).
Brucella abortus (Ba) is an intracellular bacterium that infects animals and humans, inducing a fetal abortion. Ba is thought to be transmitted in cows via the oro-pharyngeal route
after exposure to infected placenta released on
abortion. It colonizes placenta in its natural
hosts (Carvalho Neta et al. 2010) as well as giant
trophoblasts in a mouse animal model (Tobias
et al. 1993; Kim et al. 2005b). It could be transmitted to the fetus, indicating a crossing of the
placental barrier. A surface protein of Ba (SP41)
is associated with adherence to and invasion
of nonphagocytic HeLa cells (Castaneda-Roldan et al. 2006). However, the receptor is not
known and trophoblasts may express other receptors recognized by Ba. The exact mechanism
by which Ba may cross the placental barrier is
not known.
Coxsackieviruses B (CVB) may be transmitted to the fetus during delivery (Moore 1982)
but the rate of transplacental transmission although present (Konstantinidou et al. 2007), is
not known. In a study conducted by Satosar
et al. (2004) it was shown that CVB was present
in 35% of infected placentae obtained from
cases with fetal or neonatal death or severe neonatal morbidity, indicating a potential strong
role of coxsackieviruses in placental infection.
It is not known, however, if the mechanism by
which CVB crosses the fetal barrier has similarities with crossing of other host barriers (intestinal barrier and BBB).
Rubella virus, which belongs to the Togaviridaefamily, is associated with congenital rubella
syndrome (CRS), a major cause of developmental abnormalities, including blindness and deafness (Banatvala and Brown 2004; Duszak 2009).
Despite efficient vaccination programs, this disease still affects some areas in developing countries. Infection by Rubella virus occurs by inhalation, the placenta being subsequently infected,
leading to focal necrosis of the epithelium in
the chorionic villi and in the endothelial cells
of its capillaries (Tondury and Smith 1966).
Despite the existence of animal models of vertical transmission (Cotlier et al. 1968; Kono
et al. 1969), the pathophysiology of the infection remains mostly elusive. It has been proposed that infected cells in the placenta detach
into the lumen of vessels, resulting in infection and damage of fetal organs. As classically
observed for vertically transmitted microbes,
symptoms associated with CRS are more severe
when the infection occurs during the first trimester of gestation but the infection can occur
throughout the pregnancy (Grillner et al. 1983;
Miller 1991).
The recent reemergence of another member
of the Togaviridae family that belongs to the
Alphavirus genus, Chikungunya virus, led to
the demonstration that it is associated with
severe neonatal infections, including encephalopathy. As mother-to-child transmission is
rare in antepartum but frequent in the context
of intrapartum maternal viremia, and the placenta is not a site of viral replication, this favors
a model of vertical transmission via placental
breaches that forms around the term during
parturition, as described for a number of other
viruses associated with elevated maternal viremia during delivery, such as HIV, HBV, and
arboviruses such as Dengue virus or West
Nile virus (Couderc et al. 2008; Gerardin et al.
2008).
L. monocytogenes actively crosses the placental barrier and causes severe maternofetal infections in humans (Mylonakis et al. 2002; Lecuit et al. 2007). The ability of L. monocytogenes
to infect cytotrophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic cells has been shown from immunohistopathological studies of placentas from women
with listeriosis, in conjunction with the use of
human primary trophoblasts and third trimester human placental explants (Lecuit et al. 2004).
Importantly, and in contrast to what is observed
at the intestinal barrier level, both InlA and InlB

interactions with their receptors on syncytiotrophoblasts are necessary for efficient invasion
(Lecuit et al. 2004). These findings suggest that
L. monocytogenes crossing of the human fetoplacental unit follows a transplacental route,
after attachment to and invasion of the syncytiotrophoblasts in an InlA- and InlB-dependent
manner, respectively. It has been recently proposed in an ex vivo model of human first trimester placental explant that L. monocytogenes enter
the placenta in an InlA-dependent manner
mostly through the extravillous trophoblasts,
which anchor the placenta in the decidua, and
not through the syncytiotrophoblasts (Robbins
et al. 2010). This apparent difference may be
because of intrinsic anatomical differences in
first and third trimester explants, the former
presenting with more anchoring villi and extravillous trophobalsts than the latter. Of note, infection of fetus and abortion because of L.
monocytogenes occur far more frequently during
later stages of pregnancy (80% of maternofetal listeriosis occur after 22 weeks of amenorrhea; data from the French National Reference
Center for Listeria). The requirement of InlA in
L. monocytogenes crossing of the placental barriers has been independently shown epidemiologically, because L. monocytogenes isolates expressing a functional InlA are very significantly
associated with their fetoplacental origin (Jacquet et al. 2004; Disson et al. 2008). The mechanism of infection has also been studied in animal models in vivo. As previously described, a
limitation to the study of L. monocytogenes in
vivo is that InlA and InlB interactions with their
respective receptors are species-specific: InlA
interacts with guinea pig E-cadherin, as in human, but not mouse and rat, E-cadherin (Lecuit
et al. 1999), whereas InlB interacts with mouse
Met, as in human but not guinea pig Met (Khelef et al. 2006). In apparent contradiction with
the above epidemiological, ex vivo and in vitro
results, InlA plays no role in L. monocytogenes
fetoplacental infection in the guinea pig, despite
its permissiveness to the InlA pathway (Bakardjiev et al. 2004). Similarly, InlB plays no role in
L. monocytogenes fetoplacental infection in the
mouse, despite its permissiveness to the InlB
pathway (Le Monnier et al. 2007). To investigate
the role of both InlA and InlB in vivo, studies
were conducted in two complementary animal
models permissive for these two pathways: the
gerbil, a natural host for L. monocytogenes, and a
knockin mouse line that expresses a humanized
version of E-cadherin in place of endogenous
mouse E-cadherin. Using these two models, it
has been established that L. monocytogenes specifically targets the placenta in vivo, in an InlA
and InlB interdependent manner, and interacts
with its receptors E-cadherin and Met, thereby
deciphering the molecular mechanism underlying the ability of L. monocytogenes to target
and cross the placental barrier (Disson et al.
2008).
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM PATHOGENS
AND THE BLOOD –BRAIN BARRIER
Infectious meningitis is a severe and potentially
lethal infection of the meninges, the protective
membranes covering the central nervous system (CNS), even in otherwise healthy children
or adults. Clinical and neuropathologic studies
have clearly documented the complications of
bacterial meningitis, which are brain edema,
increased intracranial pressure, seizure, arterial
and venous cerebral vascular insults, and other
motor, sensitive, sensorial, and cognitive sequelae (Scheld et al. 2002). Host immune responses
are frequently inadequately tuned to control infection within the CNS, either insufficient and
unable to control microbial burden, or excessive
and associated with excessive inflammation and
irreversible tissue damages (Tunkel and Scheld
1995; Pfister and Scheld 1997). In this context,
disruption of the BBB is a hallmark event in the
pathophysiology of meningitis and subsequent
CNS disease, which is critical not only for microbial access to the CNS, but also in the control
of the infection.
The BBB maintains the homeostasis of the
CNS microenvironment by restricting access of
macromolecules, cells, and pathogens. The BBB
sensu stricto is anatomically represented by the
cerebral microvascular endothelium. Epithelial
cells of the choroid plexus and meningeal vessels
are two additional potential sites of crossing the
blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Brain microK.S. Doran et al.

vascular endothelial cells (BMEC) are held together by tight junctions, display a paucity of
pinocytosis, and thus form a barrier (Betz 1985,
1992). Yet, despite its highly restrictive nature,
certain pathogens are able to penetrate the BBB
and gain entry into the CNS. The exact mechanisms by which these microorganisms pass
through the BBB result from a complex interplay between host and microbial factors. Two
principal mechanisms, operating individually
or in tandem, are an increased permeability of
the barrier and the direct invasion of the microorganism. The reasons for increased permeability of the BBB during infections are not fully
understood. A dose- and time-dependent increase in permeability was observed in various
animal models of bacterial meningitis (Temesvari et al. 1993; Kim et al. 1997; Mayhan 1998).
These data suggest a role for bacterial factors,
like cell wall components and toxins, in promoting BBB permeability either directly or indirectly through induction of host factors. Several reports have linked increased BBB permeability
to a parallel increase in levels of circulating cytokines in the blood and CSF during infection
(Lo et al. 1994). Tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), IL-1, and IL-6 are major early response cytokines that trigger a cascade of inflammatory
mediators, including other cytokines, chemokines, arachidonic acid metabolites, and reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates (Dinarello 2000).
Blood –Brain Barrier Composition
The BBB, composed primarily of a specialized
layer of BMEC, separates the brain and its surrounding tissues from the circulating blood,
tightly regulating the flow of nutrients and molecules and thereby maintaining the proper biochemical conditions for normal brain function
(Betz 1985, 1992). In addition, other periendothelial structures, such as pericytes, astrocytes,
and a basement membrane, contribute to the
BBB function (Abbott et al. 2010). These cells
function in a coordinated fashion to regulate the
passage of nutrients and other small lipophlic
molecules while restricting the access of other
macromolecules (Pfister et al. 1992; Rubin and
Staddon 1999). The brain endothelial cells are
mainly characterized by the presence of tight
intercellular junctions that promote high transendothelial electrical resistance and therefore
impede paracellular flux of macromolecules
(Ballabh et al. 2004). Similar to epithelial cells,
endothelial cells express adherens junctions (AJ)
and tight junctions (TJ) proteins at sites of intercellular contacts (Schulze and Firth 1993;
Wolburg and Lippoldt 2002). In BMEC, TJ are
composed of four integral membrane proteins:
occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecules, and cell-selective adhesion molecules,
which are linked through cytoplasmic proteins
(zonala-occludin-1 (ZO-1), -2, -3, cingulin) to
the actin cytoskeleton. AJ are composed of
VE-cadherins, which are connected to actin
cytoskeleton through catenins (Furuse 2010;
Lampugnani et al. 1995; Hirase et al. 1997; Martin-Padura et al. 1998; Rudini and Dejana 2008).
Claudin 1, -3, -5, and -12 have been identified at
the BBB with claudin-5 being especially critical
for BBB formation (Nitta et al. 2003), whereas
occludin specifically regulates calcium flux between the blood and brain (Liebner et al. 2008).
In addition to maintaining endothelial integrity
for normal homeostasis these junctional complexes also play important roles in the maintenance of cell polarity, signaling, and modulation of transcription (Bazzoni and Dejana
2004; Dejana 2004).
Pathogen Invasion of the BBB
Significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular interactions between
the BBB and microbial pathogens with the availability of in vitro tissue culture models of human BMEC (hBMEC) (Stins et al. 1994; Weksler
et al. 2005) and in vivo animal models (Smith
et al. 1973; Doran et al. 2002; Wickham et al.
2007; Uchiyama et al. 2009; Sheen et al. 2010).
Microbial interactions with the BBB may involve crossing of BMEC in a vacuole (transcytosis), through the intercellular junctional spaces
( paracytosis), or while inside a host cell (e.g.,
infected phagocyte) using it as a vehicle to cross
the barrier (Trojan horse) (Kim 2008, 2010)
(Fig. 2).

Microbial Adhesion to BMEC and Transcytosis
across the BBB
Many meningeal pathogens are able to enter or
“invade” brain endothelium apically and exit
the cell on the basolateral side, thereby crossing
the BBB cellularly. The engagement of host cell
receptors results in signaling processes that
drive massive host actin cytoskeletal rearrangement to promote bacterial uptake into the cell.
Electron microscopic (EM) studies have shown
the presences of meningeal pathogens in membrane bound vacuoles within BMEC, suggesting
the involvement of endocytic pathways as well as
avoidance of lysosomal fusion for BBB traversal
(Nizet et al. 1997; van Sorge et al. 2008, 2011).
Many studies have focused on the identification of bacterial and host components involved
in microbial interactions with the BBB (Kim
2008). Critical bacterial components have been
discovered by screening random mutant libraries (Badger et al. 2000; Doran et al. 2005), analyzing bacterial transcription profiles during infection (Dietrich et al. 2003; Teng et al. 2005),
and using bioinformatic approaches for whole
genome comparisons (Uchiyama et al. 2009;
van Sorge et al. 2009; Tazi et al. 2010). Bacterial
pili, or fimbriae, have emerged as a common
class of adhesins used by many meningeal pathogens, such as E. coli K1(Teng et al. 2005), GBS
(Maisey et al. 2007; van Sorge et al. 2009), and
N. meningitides (Kirchner and Meyer 2005) to

terial components such as CbpA and NanA, a
surface anchored sialidase, in S. pneumonia
(Ring et al. 1998; Uchiyama et al. 2009), lipoteichoic acid and HvgA in GBS (Doran et al.
2005; Tazi et al. 2010), type1 fimbriae, OmpA
and ibeA/B in E. coli K1 (Prasadarao et al.
1999a,b; Teng et al. 2005), promote brain endothelial cell attachment and subsequent cellular
penetration. Separately, bacterial toxins play an
important role in microbial interactions with
the BBB. In case of E. coli K1, cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (CNF-1) activates RhoA resulting in increased invasion of BMEC in vitro and
increased penetration of the BBB in vivo (Khan
et al. 2002, 2003). In contrast, b hemolysin (bh/c) of GBS (Doran et al. 2003; Lembo et al.
2010), pneumolysin of S. pneumonia (Zysk et
al. 2001) and HiB lipopolysaccharide (Patrick
et al. 1992) all cause apoptosis in brain endothelial cells, which lead to increased BBB permeability and bacterial penetration in vivo.
A broad range of host cell surface receptors
have been reported to mediate interaction with
pathogens that lead to subsequent cellular penetration in the CNS. The laminin receptor (LR)
and platelet activating factor receptor (PAFr)
have been identified as common portals of
CNS entry for the leading meningeal pathogens
such as E. coli K1 (Chung et al. 2003; Kim et al.
2005a), Neisseria meningitidis(Virji et al. 1993),
Streptococcus pneumoniae (Ring et al. 1998; Orihuela et al. 2009), and Haemophilus influenzae
(Swords et al. 2001). LR was identified to function as a receptor for CNF-1 of E. coliK1 (Chung
et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2005a), PilQ and PorA
of N. meningitidis, CbpA of S. pneumoniae,
and OmpP2 of H. influenzae (Orihuela et al.
2009). The PAFr binds to phosphorylcholine
on the bacterial surface, which results in b-arrestin-mediated invasion of brain endothelial
cells (Radin et al. 2005). Inflammatory activation of host cells shifts the targeting of S. pneumoniae to this G-protein-coupled receptor
(Cundell et al. 1995). This results in promoting
bacterial transcytosis across the cell, whereas
non-PAFr-mediated entry shunts bacteria for
exit and reentry on the apical surface in a novel
recycling pathway (Ring et al. 1998). Integrins
are also emerging as common receptors for
many meningeal pathogens. Bacteria may engage components of an extracellular matrix to
bridge tointegrins andinitiateintegrin signaling
pathways. For example, human collagen bridges
GBS pili adhesin, PilA, and a2b1 integrin on
BMEC, resulting in bacterial attachment, immune activation, and ultimately penetration of
the CNS (Banerjee et al. 2011). Similarly, fibronectin bridges N. meningitidis to a5b1 integrin
on BMEC surface enabling bacterial internalization (Unkmeir et al. 2002). Glycan structures,
specially glucosaminoglycans (GAG), that interact with integrin signaling machinery, have
been shown to interact with bacterial proteins
such as the GBS a C protein (Chang et al. 2011).
Given that many of these host cell factors preferentially localize to the basolateral surface of
polarized endothelium, disruption of junctional protein complexes on infection may result in
a nonpolarized distribution of proteins on the
BBB plasma membrane and their luminal accessibility (see below).
Paracytosis
Several meningeal pathogens are capable of either cleaving or remodeling these intercellular
junctional proteins and therefore affect BBB
integrity. Disruption of these cellular contacts
leads to increased BBB permeability and also
facilitates bacterial translocation into the brain.
Bacterial toxins such as pneumolysin and b-hemolysin, of S. pneumoniae and GBS, respectively, are implicated in directly affecting the BBB
integrity by causing endothelial cell death (Zysk
et al. 2001; Lembo et al. 2010). For GBS, higher
toxin production has been associated with increased capacity to cause meningitis (Doran et
al. 2003). In addition, toxin production results
in increased production of proinflammatory
cytokines/chemokines, especially TNF-a, which
negatively impact the BBB function (Sharief
et al. 1992; Kim et al. 1997; Barichello et al.
2011).
Pathogens may also bind to endothelial cells
at or near the TJs (Grab et al. 2004, 2005) and
induce the secretion of host proteases that can
cleave TJ or AJ proteins. For example, N. meningitidis induces specific cleavage of the TJ comCross-Host Barriers

ponent occludin through the release of host matrix metalloproteinase 8, resulting in endothelial cell detachment and increased paracellular
permeability (Schubert-Unkmeir et al. 2010).
A similar strategy is used by Borrelia, which
was shown to degrade TJ proteins and allow
passage of monocytes (Reijerkerk et al. 2006).
Some pathogens may adopt a more sophisticated strategy of remodeling the junctional complexes. E. coli K1 OmpA initiates a signaling
process that leads to the dissociation of b-catenins from cadherins which further results in
disruption of barrier integrity (Sukumaran
and Prasadarao 2003). The type-IV pili of N.
meningitides, on the other hand, stimulates the
b2-adrenoceptor/b-arrestin signaling pathway
in endothelial cells, leading to recruitment of
the Par3/Par6/PKCz polarity complex and delocalization of junctional proteins which result
in anatomical gaps that are used by the bacteria to penetrate into the CNS (Coureuil et al.
2009, 2010). Human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) envelope glycoprotein gp120 has also
been shown to increase BBB permeability by
interacting with endothelial trans-membrane
coreceptor CCR5 and CXCR4 (Kanmogne et
al. 2007).
Phagocyte-Facilitated Invasion
The use of phagocytic cells for BBB invasion
(Trojan horse mechanism) appears to be mainly
used by intracellular pathogens that are able to
survive and eventually multiply in professional
phagocytes. According to this scenario, a pathogen first infects a bone-marrow-derived cell,
such as a macrophage, monocyte, or dendritic
cell, which may then penetrate the BBB, acting
as a shuttle for the microbe. For example,
CD11b expressing cells are infected and used
by T. gondii to breach the BBB (Lachenmaier
et al. 2011). Similarly, monocytes or macrophages may be used by C. neoformans, L. monocytogenes, M. tuberculosis, and Brucella and
Salmonella spp for entry into the CNS (Greiffenberg et al. 1998; Drevets et al. 2004; JoinLambert et al. 2005; Charlier et al. 2009). West
Nile virus infection of BMEC modulates TJ proteins in endothelial cells and facilitates migration of virus-infected cells through that space
into CNS (Verma et al. 2009). HIV infection
of monocytes increases surface expression of
LFA-1, an ICAM1 ligand that increases the likelihood of adhesion to CNS endothelial cells
(Stent and Crowe 1997). After penetration, these
infected monocytes and macrophages can
spread the pathogen to microglia, perivascular
macrophages, and astrocytes, creating a reservoir
for the organismin the CNS. These parenchymal
pathogen reservoirs primarily result in microglial activation, leukocyte infiltration into the
CNS, and neuronal damage.
Inflammation and BBB Permeability
Finally, host inflammatory factors may also contribute to loss of BBB integrity, resulting in pathogen penetration into the CNS. It was recently shown that polymorphonuclear neutrophils
contribute to BBB impermeability loss during
the GBS meningitis (Banerjee et al. 2011). Although neutrophils are critically important to
fight against bacterial sepsis, depletion of peripheral neutrophils in a murine hematogenous
model of GBS meningitis prolonged survival,
decreased bacterial CNS load, and decreased
BBB leakage in GBS-infected mice (Banerjee
et al. 2011). Correspondingly, prevention of
leukocyte infiltration into the CNS using antiCD18 antibody has been shown to improve
pneumococcal and HiB meningitis outcomes
(Tuomanen et al. 1989; Saez-Llorens et al. 1991).
Different bacterial components initiate inflammatory activation of brain endothelial cells,
resulting in secretion of cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-a, IL-1, IL-8, or TGF-b, the
levels of which are typically elevated in meningitis patients (Waage et al. 1989; Fida et al. 2006;
Nagesh Babu et al. 2008). These cytokines may
have an autocrine effect on BMEC, leading to
increased expression of host receptors that further promote bacterial penetration. For example, cells stimulated with TNF-a, IL-8, or TGFb resulted in an increased bacterial uptake in
vitro (Cundell et al. 1995; Zhang et al. 2002;
Banerjee et al. 2010). OmpA of E. coli K1 binds
to gp96 glycoprotein on BMEC surface and this
interaction in turn increases the expression of

type-1 fimbriae that bind to CD48 (Prasadarao
et al. 2003; Khan et al. 2007). Pathogen interaction with BMEC also results in activation of
several signal transduction pathways that either
leads to actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and
subsequent bacterial uptake or proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine secretion and localized inflammation. In the majority of instances
actin cytoskeleton rearrangement signaling
events involve activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Prasadarao et al. 1999b; Banerjee
et al. 2011), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K), r GTPases (Khan et al. 2003) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (Das et al. 2001)
(cPLA2), and src kinases (Slanina et al. 2010).
Additionally, activation of mitogen-activated
protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathways promotes proinflammatory cytokine secretion (Sokolova et al. 2004; Banerjee et al. 2010, 2011).
Transcriptional analysis of the BMEC on
GBS infection revealed a specific gene-activation program acting to orchestrate neutrophil
recruitment (IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2), activation
(IL-6, IL-8), survival (GM-CSF), and extravasation (ICAM-1). This response was dependent
on the GBS b-h/c toxin, the transcriptional
regulator of virulence, CovR and PilA expression (Doran et al. 2003; Lembo et al. 2010;
Banerjee et al. 2011). Additional in vitro studies
with S. pneumoniae, HiB, S. typhimurium, E.
coli K1, Streptococcus suis, L. monocytogenes,
and N. meningitidis reveal a similar core BMEC
transcriptional response that results in the induction of neutrophil signaling pathways (Wilson and Drevets 1998; Vadeboncoeur et al. 2003;
Galanakis et al. 2006; Schubert-Unkmeir et al.
2007; Banerjee et al. 2010; van Sorge et al. 2011).
Continued exposure and invasion of the pathogen may result in overactivation of BBB endothelium and lead to increased inflammation
that may ultimately compromise BBB integrity.
IN SUMMARY
Microbial interactions with host barriers are key
events in invasive infectious diseases. The deciphering of the molecular mechanisms underlying microbial attachment to, invasion of, translocation across, and disruption of host barriers
is not only important in a biomedical perspective but also on a basic perspective. Future studies will hopefully help improve the severe prognosis of invasive infection, and also contribute
to a better understanding of the physiology of
host barriers.
