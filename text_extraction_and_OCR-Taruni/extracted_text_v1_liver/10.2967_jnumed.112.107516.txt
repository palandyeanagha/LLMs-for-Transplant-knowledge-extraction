The success of liver transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) is enhanced by careful patient selection on
the basis of the Milan criteria. The criteria are traditionally
assessed by contrast CT, which is known to be affected by
structural or architectural changes in cirrhotic livers. We aimed
to compare dual-tracer (11C-acetate and 18F-FDG) PET/CT with
contrast CT for patient selection on the basis of the Milan criteria. Methods: Patients who had HCC and had undergone
both preoperative dual-tracer PET/CT and contrast CT within
a 1-mo interval were retrospectively studied. They then underwent either LT (n 5 22) or partial hepatectomy (PH) (n 5 21;
HCC of # 8 cm). Imaging data were compared with data from
postoperative pathologic analysis for accuracy in assessment
of parameters specified by the Milan criteria (tumor size and
extent, vascular invasion, and metastasis), TNM staging, and
patient selection for LT. Results: Dual-tracer PET/CT performed equally well in both LT and PH groups for HCC detection (94.1% vs. 95.8%) and TNM staging (90.9% vs. 90.5%).
Contrast CT performed reasonably well in the LT group but not
in the PH group for HCC detection (67.6% vs. 37.5%) and TNM
staging (54.5% vs. 28.6%). In the LT group, the sensitivity and
specificity of contrast CT for patient selection on the basis of
the Milan criteria were 43.8% and 66.7%, respectively (comparable to values in the literature); the sensitivity and specificity of
dual-tracer PET/CT were 93.8% and 100%, respectively (both
Ps , 0.05). From the surgeon’s perspective, we tended to perform transplantation for patients with higher diagnostic certainty
(stricter CT criteria) because of a shortage of donor grafts.
Patients who were not transplant candidates usually underwent
up-front hepatectomy without the benefit of reassessment contrast CT, resulting in lower accuracies for the PH group. The
overall sensitivity (96.8%) and specificity (91.7%) of dual-tracer
PET/CT for patient selection for LT were significantly higher
than those of contrast CT (41.9% and 33.0%, respectively)
(both Ps , 0.05). Sources of error for contrast CT were related
to cirrhosis or previous treatment and included difficulty in
differentiating cirrhotic nodules from HCC (39%) and estimation of tumor size (14%). Overstaging of vascular invasion (4.6%)
and extrahepatic metastases (4.6%) was infrequent. The rate
of false-negative results of dual-tracer PET/CT was 4.7%.
Conclusion: Dual-tracer PET/CT was significantly less affected
by cirrhotic changes than contrast CT for HCC staging and
patient selection for LT on the basis of the Milan criteria. The
inclusion of dual-tracer PET/CT in pretransplant workup may
warrant serious consideration.

Surgical treatment offers the best chance of cure for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver resection
is a safe option in experienced hands. However, the tumor
recurrence rate at 5 y after partial hepatectomy (PH) can be
as high as 80% (1–3), and patients with limited functional
hepatic reserve are not considered suitable candidates for the
procedure. Liver transplantation (LT) is thus regarded as the
ultimate solution for these patients.
Initial trials of LT for HCC in the 1980s did not have a
satisfactory outcome, with 5-y survival rates of 18%–40%.
The low success rates were largely attributed to inappropriate patient selection and a long waiting time because of
graft scarcity (4–7). In 1996, Mazzaferro et al. (8) proposed
the Milan criteria to maximize the benefit of orthotopic LT.
They proposed a set of selection criteria on the basis of the
relationship between small HCCs and better patient survival
after LT. They found that patients with radiologic evidence of
a single tumor with a diameter of 5 cm or less or a maximum
of 3 tumors each with a diameter of 3 cm or less had a 5-y
survival rate of 75% and a disease-free survival rate of 83%.
Their findings were later confirmed by other transplant reReceived Apr. 16, 2012; revision accepted Sep. 14, 2012.

search groups (9). Although there are individual differences
in these criteria, there is agreement that tumor number and
size are the key factors that affect patient survival.
In all studies of criteria for patient selection for LT, the
imaging tool used for the selection of patients has been either
CT or MRI. It is well known, however, that their sensitivity
for the detection of HCC is suboptimal in the presence of architectural distortion caused by severe cirrhosis in pretransplant patients, mostly reported to be about 60%–70% (10,11).
In recent years, double-contrast MRI with both gadolinium
and superparamagnetic iron oxide has been reported to
have significantly improved the detection of HCC in cirrhotic
livers, with a sensitivity of 75%–80% (12–14). Besides CT
and MRI, PET has also been used.
In the past few years, dual-tracer PET/CT with 11C-acetate
(
11C-ACT) and 18F-FDG has been found to be useful in the
evaluation of primary and metastatic HCC disease (15–17).
Because these 2 tracers are biochemical probes of HCCs and
are complementary to each other, according to tumor cellular
differentiation, they can not only maximize sensitivity for the
detection of malignant lesions but also identify tumors with
better differentiation and better prognosis (18). Previous
studies (15,18) suggested that the capacity of dual-tracer
(11C-ACT and 18F-FDG) PET/CT to perform a whole-body
metastatic survey (including bones) makes it the most comprehensive modality for staging compared with conventional
radiologic imaging methods. On the basis of these potential
advantages, we performed the present study to evaluate the
accuracy of dual-tracer PET/CT for HCC staging and patient
selection for LT on the basis of the Milan criteria and compared the results with those of contrast CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients who had undergone LT or PH (largest lesion size,
#8 cm) for HCC at the Department of Surgery, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, between March 2004 and
March 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. As a general guideline,
patients with satisfactory liver function were offered liver resection
as the first treatment. Patients who had poor liver function that was
not expected to tolerate liver resection were considered for LT.
For comparison of the accuracy of dual-tracer PET/CT with that
of contrast CT for HCC staging and patient selection for LT on the
basis of the Milan criteria, all patients meeting the following 3
conditions were enrolled in the study. First, the patients had received
preoperative assessment by both triphasic CT of the abdomen and
dual-tracer PET/CT, and the time interval between the 2 imaging
sessions had to be less than 1 mo. Second, the patients had not
received any treatment between preoperative imaging (dualtracer PET/CT and contrast CT) and surgery. For patients who
had undergone PH, the third condition was that there should be
no tumor involvement of resection margins, as documented by
postoperative histopathologic analysis.
All patients provided verbal and written consent after being
given clear instructions and explanations about the purposes and
details of this study, which was approved by the institutional ethics
committee (equivalent to an institutional review board) at Hong
Kong Sanatorium and Hospital; study approval was also obtained
from The University of Hong Kong.
Forty-three patients (34 men and 9 women; age range, 30–77 y;
median age, 61 y) satisfied the inclusion criteria; 22 had LT (age
range, 30–64 y; median age, 55 y), and 21 had PH (age range, 42–
77 y; median age, 65 y). Thirty-seven patients were hepatitis B
virus carriers, and 3 were hepatitis C virus carriers. The patients’
clinical and biochemical data are shown in Table 1. There were no

significant differences in age, sex ratio, Child–Pugh grade, major
organ biochemistry, a-fetoprotein concentration, and hepatitis virus status between the 2 groups of patients. The median time intervals between imaging and surgery were 35 d for CT and 21 d for
PET/CT. Five patients in the LT group and 1 patient in the PH
group had received bridging treatment by transcatheter arterial
chemoembolization (TACE) before preoperative assessment by
contrast CT and dual-tracer PET/CT. One patient had contrast
CT and dual-tracer PET/CT before and after TACE.
Dual-Tracer PET/CT and Contrast CT
The dual-tracer PET/CT protocol was previously described
(15,16). All patients fasted for at least 6 h, and the blood glucose
concentration was determined before the injection of PET radiopharmaceuticals (all had glucose levels of ,8 mmol/L). 11C-ACT
(440–590 MBq; 7.4 MBq/kg of body weight) was administered
intravenously, and limited whole-body (from base of skull to upper thigh) imaging was performed at 20 min after injection. Data
acquisition with an integrated in-line PET/CT scanner (Biograph
LSO or Biograph 16 LSO HI-REZ; Siemens) began with CT (no
contrast agent, 130 kV, 110–115 mA, 2-mm pitch, and 1-s tube rotation); CT was followed by PET with a 2-min emission acquisition time and a 16.2-cm axial field of view per position. About
15 min after the completion of 11C-ACT imaging, 330–520 MBq
(6.3 MBq/kg of body weight) of 18F-FDG were injected intravenously. PET/CT imaging with the same positions and acquisition
settings began at 60 min after 18F-FDG administration.
All CT studies were performed with a multidetector CT scanner
(Light Speed 16; GE Healthcare) and standard unenhanced and
3-phase contrast-enhanced protocols (collimation, 1.5–2.0 mm; image
reconstruction interval, 5 mm) for dynamic evaluation of the liver.
Enhanced images were acquired after intravenous contrast agent
injection (Omnipaque 300; 2 mL/kg; GE Healthcare). Guided by
an early arterial phase automatically acquired with a 180–Hounsfield unit increase in attenuation, with reference to the abdominal
aorta at the level of the liver dome, a late arterial phase followed 12
s later, and then a portal venous phase followed 40 s later. Delayedphase imaging was performed when better delineation of lesion extent was needed or to check for capsular enhancement.
Interpretation According to Milan Criteria
In the present study, a patient was classified as either satisfying
or not satisfying the Milan criteria for transplantation (a single
HCC lesion of #5 cm or a maximum of 3 HCC lesions of #3 cm
each, no macroscopic vascular invasion, and no extrahepatic metastasis) on the basis of preoperative imaging with dual-tracer
(11C-ACT and 18F-FDG) PET/CT or contrast CT.
An intrahepatic lesion (liver or intrahepatic tumor thrombus) on
PET images was considered to be an HCC on the basis of focally
increased 11C-ACT or 18F-FDG metabolism and a well-defined
margin compared with the background liver parenchyma, as visually judged by 3 nuclear medicine physicians (each with 7–10 y of
experience in dual-tracer PET/CT). They read the images independently before reaching a consensus on the final diagnosis,
which was supported by a semiquantitative evaluation (lesion-toliver maximum standardized uptake value [SUV] ratio, .1.20).
The lesion boundary was delineated in 3 dimensions automatically
by the second derivative “PET edge” computational method with
MIMContouring V4.1.8 commercial software (MIM Software, Inc.).
The longest diameter of the lesion calculated by this computational
algorithm was regarded as the “functional” lesion size on PET.
An extrahepatic lesion (extrahepatic tumor thrombi or metastasis) was assessed with the same evaluation methods, except that
only the maximum SUV of the lesion was measured (the ratio was
not necessary in the absence of background liver activity), and was
considered to be an HCC if the maximum SUV was greater than
2.5 on either 18F-FDG or 11C-ACT PET images.
CT studies were interpreted independently by experienced radiologists without prior knowledge of the dual-tracer PET/CT
findings. A lesion was considered positive for HCC if it showed
contrast enhancement during the arterial phase and washout with
isoattenuation or hypoattenuation during the portal venous or
delayed equilibrium phase. A mosaic pattern and delayed capsular
enhancement were also taken as ancillary signs of a positive diagnosis. The “physical” lesion size was regarded as the longest orthogonal diameter on the transaxial or reconstructed sagittal or coronal
CT images. Other information, such as vascular tumor involvement
and metastases, was likewise recorded independently.
The imaging findings were compared with the results of histopathologic analysis of explanted livers and resected liver and extrahepatic specimens (lymph nodes, vessels, and peritoneum), if
any, because histopathologic analysis was used as the reference
standard. Specific parameters recorded for each patient were diagnosis of individual liver lesions (HCCs, dysplastic nodules, and
regenerative nodules), size, location (liver segment), number of
lesions, tumor cellular grade or differentiation, vascular thrombosis
with or without tumor involvement, nontumor liver tissue status, and
extrahepatic metastasis. A lesion seen on contrast CT or PET/CT was
considered to be a true-positive lesion if it was confirmed to be
HCC by microscopic histopathologic analysis and was in the same
location and segment indicated by gross pathology.
Statistical Analysis
Quantitative comparisons between contrast CT and 18F-FDG
PET/CT, 11C-ACT PET/CT, and dual-tracer PET/CT were made
with the x2 test for the following aspects: sensitivity for the detection of HCCs and small (#2-cm) HCCs, HCC staging (TNM
system; (19)), and patient selection for LT according to the Milan
criteria. P values of less than 0.05 signified statistical significance.
Histopathologic analysis was used as the reference standard.
RESULTS
Pathologic Examination
The diagnosis of HCC was confirmed in all patients, and
each patient had at least 1 HCC lesion found by postoperative
pathologic analysis.
LT Group. Twenty-two patients in the LT group had a
total of 34 HCC lesions with a median tumor size of 2.5 cm
(range, 1.0–8.0 cm). Cirrhosis, dysplastic nodules, and regenerative nodules were found in all explanted livers. One
patient had intrahepatic portal vein tumor thrombosis. All
specimens were examined, including 4 specimens (a 2.0-cm
portal node, a peritoneal biopsy at a location with significant mesenteric stranding, and 2 portal venous thrombi)
from 4 patients with suspect findings on CT, and no extrahepatic metastasis was found. Histopathologic evidence obtained after LT showed that 16 patients (72.7%) met the
Milan criteria and that 6 patients (27.3%) did not. Among
the latter 6 patients, 3 had tumors larger than 5 cm (6.5, 7,
and 8 cm) and 3 had multicentric HCC, each with 1 lesion
194 THE JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE • Vol. 54 • No. 2 • February 2013

larger than 3 cm (3.5, 4, and 5 cm). According to the TNM
staging system, 13 patients (59.1%) were at stage I, 8 patients
(36.4%) were at stage II, and 1 patient (4.5%) was at stage III.
PH Group. Twenty-one patients in the PH group had a
total of 24 HCC lesions with a median tumor size of 2.8 cm
(range, 1.0–7.5 cm). One patient had vascular tumor invasion of a portal vein branch. All resected liver specimens
showed moderate cirrhotic features, with dysplastic and regenerative nodules. On the basis of the findings for the resected liver specimens and the assumption that all tumors
were removed (all with clear resection margins), 15 patients
(71.4%) met the Milan criteria and 6 patients (28.6%) did
not. Each of the 15 patients who met the Milan criteria had
only 1 tumor, and these tumors were smaller than 5 cm (range,
1–4.5 cm). Of the 6 patients who did not meet the criteria, 3
had tumors larger than 5 cm (5.4, 7.0, and 7.5 cm); 2 had
multicentric HCC, with 1 lesion being larger than 3 cm (3.3
and 3.5 cm); and 1 had a tumor measuring 2.5 cm and tumor
invasion of a portal vein branch. According to the TNM
staging system, 16 patients (76.2%) were at stage I, 3
patients (14.3%) were at stage II, and 2 patients (9.5%)
were at stage III.
When the 2 groups were combined, there were a total of
58 HCC lesions, including 23 small HCC lesions (1–1.5 cm:
n 5 11; .1.5–2 cm: n 5 12; median size, 1.5 cm). Twentyseven HCC lesions, including 15 small HCC lesions (,2 cm),
were well differentiated; 31 HCC lesions, including 8 small
HCC lesions, were moderately differentiated. No lesion
was classified as poorly differentiated by histopathologic
analysis.
Preoperative CT and PET/CT Imaging
Detection of Malignant Lesions. The lesion- and patientbased sensitivity for the detection of malignant lesions by
triphasic contrast CT and 18F-FDG, 11C-ACT, and dual-tracer
PET/CT in the LT group is shown in Table 2. In the LT
group, 11C-ACT PET/CT was more sensitive than 18F-FDG
PET/CT and contrast CT for the detection of HCC (all Ps ,
0.05). Figure 1 shows a typical patient with 3 liver nodules
avid for 11C-ACT but not 18F-FDG; each was confirmed to
be a well-differentiated HCC smaller than 3 cm in explanted
liver. Two patients with false-negative 11C-ACT PET/CT
results had received bridging treatment by TACE before preoperative imaging. The pathology of the explanted livers
of these 2 patients showed significant tumor necrosis and
a small amount of viable tumor tissue. The sensitivity for
the detection of malignant lesions in the PH group is also
shown in Table 2. Again, 11C-ACT PET/CT was more sensitive than contrast CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT (all Ps , 0.05).
Contrast CT was found to have an overall lesion-based
sensitivity of 55.2% (Table 2), with individual detection sensitivities of 67.6% in the LT group and 37.5% in the PH group
(P , 0.05 for the 2 groups). There was no significant difference in the sensitivity of 11C-ACT and 18F-FDG PET/CT
between the 2 groups (both Ps . 0.05). The overall sensitivity
of 18F-FDG PET/CT was low (32.8%), as already shown by
an earlier report (16) indicating that early HCCs were more
often tumor cells of a younger generation and with better
differentiation and that their metabolic avidity favored
11C-ACT instead of 18F-FDG.
To evaluate the ability of the present study to delineate
small HCCs, we analyzed a subgroup of small tumors (1–2 cm;
mean 6 SD, 1.6 6 0.28 cm). The sensitivity for the detection
of small HCCs by 11C-ACT PET/CT was 87.0%, which was
comparable to its overall sensitivity (93.1%) (P . 0.05)
(Table 2). The sensitivities for the detection of small HCCs
by 18F-FDG PET/CT and contrast CT were 17.4% and
43.5%, respectively; these sensitivities were significantly
lower than their overall sensitivities (both Ps , 0.05). Almost two-thirds of the small HCCs were well differentiated
(15/23; 65.2%). A total of 12 dysplastic nodules ($1 cm;
mean 6 SD, 1.5 6 0.34 cm) were identified by postoperative pathologic analysis. 18F-FDG PET/CT and 11C-ACT
PET/CT yielded true-negative results for all dysplastic nodules (specificity, 100%). Contrast CT yielded false-positive
results for 2 dysplastic nodules (1.5 and 2.0 cm) with mild
arterial-phase contrast enhancement; they were misdiagnosed as small HCCs (specificity, 83.3%). 11C-ACT PET/CT correctly identified 1 patient in the LT
group as having tumor thrombi along an intrahepatic portal
vein and a main portal vein (seen as 11C-ACT–avid hypermetabolic lesions), but the results of contrast CT were indeterminate because of the lack of contrast enhancement
within the thrombi. 11C-ACT PET/CT yielded true-negative

results for 4 patients for whom extrahepatic metastasis was
suggested by CT (2 with vascular tumor thrombi, 1 with an
enlarged portal node, and 1 with a mesenteric metastasis).
Both 11C-ACT and 18F-FDG PET/CT and contrast CT
revealed no macroscopic vascular invasion or extrahepatic
metastasis in the PH group, but there was pathologic evidence of vascular invasion in 1 patient’s resected liver specimen (all types of imaging yielded false-negative results).
TNM Staging and Patient Selection for LT According to
Milan Criteria. Table 3 shows the accuracy of the 4 imaging modalities (triphasic contrast CT, 11C-ACT PET/CT,
18F-FDG PET/CT, and dual-tracer PET/CT) for TNM staging (19) in the 2 groups. 11C-ACT PET/CT was more accurate
for staging than contrast CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in both
groups of patients (all Ps , 0.05). Figure 2 shows that CT had
difficulty in differentiating dysplastic nodules from small
HCCs in a typical patient with cirrhosis. The differentiation
might have been more uncertain in patients who had undergone TACE treatment. However, changes after TACE seemed
to have little effect on PET images (Fig. 3). Although, on the
basis of the contrast CT findings after TACE, this patient did
not meet the Milan criteria, TACE should have had at least
a partial effect, as reflected by the improved clinical and biochemical parameters. With concordant findings from PET/CT
and other favorable clinical factors, including the availability
of a graft, the patient subsequently underwent LT. The results
of pathologic analysis agreed with the PET/CT findings, indicating that this patient met the Milan criteria.
Figure 4 shows the only lesion suspected of being a highgrade dysplastic nodule on the basis of mild 11C-ACT avidity (lesion-to-liver maximum SUV ratio, 1.15). PET performed
4 mo later revealed normalized metabolism, suggestive of
regression (the patient was receiving antiviral treatment).
Nonetheless, PET performed 20 mo thereafter revealed a
well-defined 11C-ACT–avid nodule in the same location.
Without knowledge of the PET findings, the pathologist
who examined the explanted liver described this nodule as
“having features of a well-differentiated HCC (1.8 cm) that
was transformed from a high-grade dysplastic nodule.”
Table 4 summarizes the abilities of PET/CT and contrast
CT to correctly select patients for LT on the basis of the Milan
criteria. Assessment was made in terms of 4 elements—
lesion size, lesion number, intrahepatic vascular invasion,
and extrahepatic metastasis. 11C-ACT PET/CT was significantly more accurate in patient selection than contrast
CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT (all Ps , 0.05). On the basis

of 11C-ACT PET/CT for patient inclusion and exclusion
were 93.5% (29/31 correctly identified as meeting the
Milan criteria) and 91.7% (11/12 correctly identified as
not meeting the Milan criteria), respectively. The incremental values of 11C-ACT PET/CT over contrast CT for
patient inclusion and exclusion were 51.6% and 58.3%,
respectively. Sources of error (nonexclusive) for contrast
CT in patient inclusion and exclusion were indeterminate
or negative conclusion in differentiating cirrhotic nodules
(dysplastic nodules, regenerative nodules, or changes after
TACE) from HCCs (39.5%; 17/43), inaccurate account of
lesion size (14%; 6/43) or number (2.3%; 1/43), and overstaging because of a false-positive diagnosis of vascular
(4.7%; 2/43) or extrahepatic (4.7%; 2/43) metastasis. Discordance between 11C-ACT PET/CT and pathologic findings
was found for 3 patients with false-negative results; the
results for 2 of these patients were determined to be negative
by both tracers. These 2 patients had tumor necrosis with
minimal residual tumor tissue after TACE.
DISCUSSION
After the introduction of the conventional Milan criteria in
1996, the results of orthotopic LT improved substantially
through careful patient selection (8,9). The objectives of the
criteria are to include more patients with a good prognosis
for LT and to prevent a poor prognosis by avoiding transplantation in patients who do not meet the criteria. The criteria enable objective patient selection and provide a fair
system for allocation of the limited supply of liver grafts.
With 10 y of experience, the Milan group achieved a patient
survival rate of over 70% in 300 LTs by adopting the criteria
(20). Equally good results were observed in the rest of the
world when a similar principle was followed, although the
criteria might have been expanded at some centers (21,22).
The Milan criteria feature 2 independent predictors of
patient survival and disease recurrence—tumor size and

found in segment V. Results of pathologic analysis for excised liver
confirmed well-differentiated HCC (3.6 cm) in right lobe (segments V
and VI) and dysplastic nodule (2.0 cm) in left lobe (segment IVb),
adjacent to gallbladder.

lesions (red arrows, CT 1–CT 5) and enlarged portal node (red circle, CT 6), hence
beyond Milan criteria. In excised liver, 2

with 2 11C-ACT–avid lesions, and a few necrotic nodules without malignant cells were
found. Portal node was found negative for
metastasis by pathologic analysis and 11CACT PET/CT.

tumor number. The most accurate measurement of tumor
size and number is obtained by examination of pathologic
specimens, but this information can be acquired only after
transplantation. Contrast CT has been used as a standard
assessment tool for this purpose, but its accuracy has not
been greatly improved even by advanced multidetector CT
with fast acquisition and computation capabilities (21,23).
The typical triphasic pattern of arterial enhancement may
not always be present in small HCCs on CT scans. On the
other hand, true tumors are often obscured by a background
of cirrhosis intermixed with regenerative and dysplastic
nodules. Furthermore, other hypervascular lesions, such
as a small hemangioma, an inflammatory nodule, or a focal
arterioportal shunt, may mimic small HCCs. False-positive
and false-negative nodules are common findings. It has
been suggested that only 10%–30% of nodules smaller than
2 cm on the arterial phase of contrast CT represent HCCs in
highly cirrhotic livers (24). On the other hand, it was reported
that ultrasound imaging, CT, and MR imaging revealed
hypervascularity in 34%, 52%, and 47% of HCCs of different
grades and with a median size of 1.6 cm, respectively. MR
imaging, especially dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging and double-contrast MR imaging, has been reported
to be better than CT for the overall detection of HCCs (12–
14,24,25). However, a Korean study showed that multidetector CT, superparamagnetic iron oxide MR imaging, and
double-contrast MR imaging had comparable accuracies
for assessing the appropriateness of patients for LT on the
basis of the Milan criteria (12).
Tumor extension is often over- or underestimated (27%–
50%) in cirrhotic livers; this was the case in the original
study that proposed the Milan criteria (8,26,27). Several
large series of studies on the sensitivity of CT (helical and
multidetector CT) in patients with cirrhotic HCC treated by
LT reported a sensitivity range of 60%–70% on a patient basis
(23,28–30). Our result in the LT group was 73.3% (67.6% on
a lesion basis), in agreement with the results in the literature.
The only difference is the lower sensitivity (42.9%; 37.5% on
a lesion basis) in the PH group.
We reviewed these studies and found 2 possible reasons
for the results. The first reason is related to the CT diagnostic criteria. Some of these studies, in addition to the typical
contrast enhancement pattern, included lesions without
arterial-phase enhancement but with delayed-phase washout. Therefore, studies that adopted this wider margin for
diagnosis also reported a large number of false-positive nodules
(up to 59%) (30). The second reason is based on the first reason; the stricter criteria in the present study tended to include
patients with a greater certainty of diagnostic accuracy but
also tended to exclude more patients with less certainty. In
view of the severe shortage of liver grafts in Hong Kong, we
embrace a more cautious attitude so that preference is given to
patients who are expected to have more definitive CT results.
Patients who are not LT candidates because of various
individual factors will undergo PH as a definitive treatment
as soon as the surgery can be arranged. Some patients with
less definitive CT findings will also undergo tumor resection as long as the clinical diagnosis is highly suggestive of
HCC. Therefore, we speculate that a “preselection” element
might have contributed partly to the lower performance of
contrast CT in the PH group.
Patient selection on the basis of the Milan criteria added
another set of conditions to the criteria for lesion detection.
CT findings agreed with pathologic findings for 43.8% of
FIGURE 4. Carrier of hepatitis B virus in LT

PET/CT (3 times). 11C-ACT PET/CT image in
July 2007 showed 11C-ACT–avid lesion with
ill-defined margins in segment V, suggestive
of early HCC or high-grade dysplastic nodule. Activity of lesion was normalized 4 mo
later but reappeared in 2009.

the patients in the LT group and for 40% of the patients in
the PH group. These rates are similar to that reported in a
German study (41%) (27). The performance of 11C-ACT
PET/CT in the LT group was similar to that in the PH group,
a result that is not surprising because it is relatively independent of benign anatomic or structural variations. As shown
in Tables 2–4, sensitivity for the detection of malignant lesions, staging accuracy, and consistency with the Milan criteria were similar (.90%) in the 2 groups when dual-tracer
PET/CT was used. Therefore, the data suggested that patients
in the PH group could have been given equal consideration
for LT had the dual-tracer PET/CT findings been used as
the criterion evaluating tool. This approach would definitely
affect management decisions. Nonetheless, more data are
needed for further validation.
In the last decade, Ho et al. studied the complementary
nature of 2 biochemical PET tracers, 11C-ACT and 18F-FDG,
for the detection of primary and metastatic HCCs (15,16).
They found that de novo synthesis of free fatty acids is upregulated in well-differentiated HCCs and that acetate (11CACT), a precursor of acetyl-coenzyme A, may be the preferred
metabolic substrate. As HCC cells become more malignant
and dedifferentiated, their biochemical substrates for growth
also progressively shift to 18F-FDG, a marker of glycolysis.
The sensitivity of an individual tracer for the detection of
malignant lesions is thus dependent on tumor cell differentiation, and the dual tracers are complementary. The sensitivity of 11C-ACT PET alone for the detection of malignant
lesions is approximately 87% for HCCs of intermediate and
small sizes. Because early or small HCCs tend to be well
differentiated, 11C-ACT is the more important tracer for
PET imaging. In the present study, the sensitivity of 11CACT PET/CT for the detection of small HCCs (1–2 cm) was
87.0%. This rate is similar to those reported in previous
studies, but it was derived from a different, independent
group of patients (31). It was also significantly higher than
those achieved by 18F-FDG PET/CT (17.4%) and contrast
CT (43.5%) in the present study.
Our results showed that regenerative nodules were not
avid for either of the 2 tracers and that they could be distinguished from HCCs. Dysplastic nodules were frequently
found in pathologic specimens, but only 1 lesion was retrospectively suspected of being a high-grade dysplastic nodule that showed mild 11C-ACT avidity before LT (Fig. 4).
More data are needed to evaluate the relationship between
11C-ACT and high-grade dysplastic nodules. Previously
published data suggested that structural changes secondary
to cirrhosis do not affect the PET diagnosis as much as they
do the CT diagnosis.
Vascular invasion and histopathologic grading are 2 other
predictors of outcomes for LT in patients with cirrhotic
HCC. These have been regarded as providing valuable prognostic information but otherwise are not available until after
surgery. With dual-tracer PET/CT, these parameters are
valuable for preoperative treatment planning (18). Although 11C-ACT was shown to have superior sensitivity for the detection of malignant lesions throughout the present study,
the complementary role of 18F-FDG should not be underestimated, because an earlier report suggested that some
metastatic HCC lesions may dedifferentiate even if the primary HCC tumor initially comprises 11C-ACT–avid, welldifferentiated cell types (15). Therefore, 18F-FDG is needed
for a complete assessment of all of the Milan criteria (metastasis). Moreover, 18F-FDG, as a marker of dedifferentiated
HCC tumor pathology, has been shown by other researchers
to be a predictor of tumor recurrence and a less favorable
outcome after transplantation (32).
In the present study, we purposely included a group of
recipients of PH for comparison. We assumed that there
was no HCC disease in the unresected livers—the only part
of the study without pathologic proof (but contrast CT and
PET/CT findings were negative). Although recurrence was
seen in some of these patients during follow-up, they were
not considered different from other PH patients in whom
recurrence was attributed to de novo metachronous tumor
development, occult tumor seeding, or micrometastasis via
portovenous sinuses or shunts and not to suboptimal preoperative imaging assessment.
Another limitation is that the synthesis of 11C-ACT requires
technical expertise and an on-site cyclotron. With significant
improvements in PET and cyclotron technologies in the past
decade, many “baby cyclotrons” have become available and affordable. Because 18F-FDG is far from being a universal tracer
for all tumors, the complementary use of a good tracer, such as
11C-ACT, for liver cancer should be encouraged.
CONCLUSION
This is the first study to use dual-tracer PET/CT for the
evaluation of patients with HCC in a setting in which the
Milan criteria are used to select patients for LT. The basic
principle underlying these criteria is the ability of imaging
to accurately define the true stage of disease. In the presence
of chronic and cirrhotic liver disease, an imaging technique
that is not so affected by the structural changes of the background parenchyma is needed. The results of the present
study confirmed that dual-tracer PET/CT works in keeping
with this principle because of the use of a pair of functional
probes that are known to be less affected by structural changes
and not compromised by size, that have complementary biochemical sensitivities to cover a wide range of tumor cells
with different degrees of differentiation or dedifferentiation,
and that can be used to perform a metastatic survey. All of
these elements contribute to the potential of this technique
for better patient selection. To understand the logistics, cost,
and feasibility of this imaging technique in pretransplant
workup for patients with HCC, large-scale research needs
to be conducted.
