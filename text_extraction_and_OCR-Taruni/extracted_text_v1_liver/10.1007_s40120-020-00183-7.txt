ABSTRACT
Introduction: Hereditary (variant) transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) with polyneuropathy
(ATTR-PN) is a rare genetic disorder that causes
progressive autonomic and sensorimotor neuropathy, severe disability, and death within
10 years of onset. Previous studies have primarily focused on how baseline cardiac characteristics affect mortality, but the impact of
non-cardiac baseline characteristics is less
defined.
Methods: We systematically searched PubMed/
Medline (1990–2019) to identify studies that
assessed the impact of baseline ATTR-PN characteristics on survival. Outcomes were first
summarized descriptively. Extracted survival
data were then disaggregated, and parametric
mixture models were used to assess survival
differences among patient groups defined by
factors known to affect survival.
Results: The search yielded 1193 records, of
which 35 were retained for analysis. Median
survival ranged from 0.5 to [25 years. The largest survival differences were between cohorts
who underwent liver transplantation (LTx)
versus those who did not. Among LTx cohorts,
pre-LTx ATTR-PN disease duration C 7 years,
poor nutritional status, and late disease onset
reduced median survival by 13, 12, and
10 years, respectively. Other prognostic survival
factors included non-Val30Met genotype and
baseline presence of urinary incontinence,
erectile dysfunction, or muscle weakness.
Conclusion: Survival in patients with ATTR-PN
is highly variable and affected by non-cardiac
baseline characteristics, such as autonomic
dysfunction, large fiber involvement, late-onset
disease, and non-Val30Met mutation. Careful
interpretation of these findings is warranted

Key Summary Points
Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis
(ATTRv) with polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN)
is a rare genetic disorder.
Survival in patients with ATTR-PN is
largely characterized by and dependent on
associated cardiac damage, but the impact
of non-cardiac characteristics on survival
are less defined.
This study sought to assess the impact of
non-cardiac baseline characteristics on
survival in ATTR-PN.
Survival in patients with ATTR-PN was
highly variable and affected by nonVal30Met mutation and non-cardiac
baseline characteristics, such as
autonomic dysfunction, large fiber
involvement, and late-onset disease.
INTRODUCTION
Hereditary (variant) transthyretin amyloidosis
(ATTRv) is a rare autosomal dominant disease
whereby mutations in the transthyretin (TTR)
gene destabilize the protein’s native homeotetrameric structure and cause it to disassociate
into amyloidogenic TTR monomers. As a result,
insoluble amyloid fibrils accumulate in the
peripheral and autonomic nerves, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, eyes, and connective tissues [1, 2]. Three phenotypes
predominate in ATTRv amyloidosis: one is
almost exclusively characterized by restrictive
cardiomyopathy, another predominantly by
polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), and the third is a
mixed phenotype [3–5].
ATTR-PN prevalence has been estimated at
approximately 10,000 to 40,000 persons globally, with endemic foci in Portugal, Sweden, and
Japan [6, 7]. Notably, disease phenotypes and
penetrance across these endemic areas and
elsewhere are often different, even for the same
genotype [8]. For example, inaugural symptoms
of early-onset disease (\50 years old) include
spontaneous burning or sharp pain, non-painful sensations (paresthesia and restless leg syndrome), and/or autonomic symptoms (sexual
dysfunction, impaired bladder function, constipation alternating with diarrhea, early satiety, orthostatic dizziness and syncope)
associated with damaged distal small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers [1]. Conversely, in late-onset disease, the combination
of well-preserved unmyelinated nerve fibers and
axonal sprouting is associated with impaired
superficial and deep sensation, severe neuropathic pain, early distal motor involvement, but
relatively mild autonomic symptoms at initial
presentation [1, 9, 10]. Absent early intervention with liver transplantation (LTx) or diseasemodifying pharmacological treatments, ATTRPN symptoms generally follow an ascending,
proximally-oriented pattern as patients experience progressive debilitating polyneuropathy
and inexorable loss of motor and organ
functions.
Among persons with the classic disease
phenotype, death has been reported to occur
within 10–15 years of symptom onset, often
from cachexia and malnutrition due to gastrointestinal complications [11, 12]. Prognostic
survival factors include cardiac dysautonomia
[3] and the presence of a mutation other than
the more common Val30Met (also referred to as
p.Val50Me) tgenotype [11, 13]; both of which
are associated with poorer survival.
Owing partly to its phenotypic heterogeneity
but also to its rarity, our understanding of survival in ATTR-PN is limited and largely based on
observations of persons with the Val30Met
genotype. Furthermore, the progression of
associated cardiac symptoms and their effects
on survival have been the predominant focus in
larger studies [14]. However, as our
136 Neurol Ther (2020) 9:135–149

understanding has evolved to reflect a heterogeneous disease, so too should our understanding of how this heterogeneity affects
survival. This systematic review and analysis
were conducted to describe the impact of noncardiac clinicopathologic factors on survival
and to assess survival trends among ATTR-PN
subgroups.
METHODS
The relevant evidence was assessed in a two-step
process consisting of a systematic literature
review to identify relevant data and a descriptive synthesis of those data. The target disease
population was limited to persons with ATTRPN.
Record identification and selection
Records were identified via a systematic literature review per a pre-specified protocol and
conducted according to modified American
Academy of Neurology guidelines (AAN) [6, 15].
Structured electronic searches of PubMed/Medline and Scopus were conducted on 15 February
2019 to identify relevant primary studies without regard to language of origin or year of
publication (See Electronic Supplementary
Material Appendix A). Non-human studies and
case reports (studies with \ 10 ATTR-PN
patients) were excluded. Narrative reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were
retained separately so that they could be searched for relevant primary reports not yielded by
the electronic search.
The electronic search was supplemented
with a hand search of conference materials from
the International Symposium on Amyloidosis
for the three most recent years held (2014,
2016, and 2018). The rationale for evaluating
this supplemental material was twofold. First,
the consideration of unpublished scientific
materials is indicated by the AAN guidelines as a
prerequisite for a comprehensive review [15].
Second, materials presented at conferences may
not have had time to be published while
otherwise being relevant to the content of the
present review. To avoid including duplicated
information between published and conference
sources, a conference record was included only
when the information presented in the record
was not also reported in an associated peer-reviewed manuscript authored by one or more of
the same authors. If the same study was reported as a conference material and as a peer-reviewed manuscript, only the latter was
considered for inclusion in this review.
Records yielded by the search strategy were
de-duplicated and assessed for inclusion via
three rounds of review (title, abstract, and fulltext) based on a pre-specified rubric applied by
two reviewers. Inconsistencies were adjudicated
by consensus. Records were retained if they
satisfied the following inclusion criteria:
• Human studies of adults (aged C 18 years).
• Primary report.
• Reported survival among persons with ATTRPN.
• Follow-up time for survival assessment
was C 5 years.
• Sample size is C 10.
• Survival was assessed from a defined baseline
event (symptom onset, diagnosis, or treatment initiation).
• Reported whether patients received diseasemodifying pharmacologic treatment or LTx.
• Patients were symptomatic at the baseline
event (assumed unless noted otherwise).
Records were also included in the descriptive
analysis of clinicopathologic prognostic factors
if they also included a multivariate assessment
of the impact of clinicopathologic factors on
survival.
Where sequential studies reported the same
endpoints updated for the same cohort, the
study with the longest follow-up time was
retained, while those with shorter follow-up
times were excluded—except where those with
shorter follow-up times included relevant survival endpoints not reported in the more recent
reports. Additionally, studies or outcomes for a
given cohort were excluded if they included
only patients with ATTRv variants associated
with the phenotype predominantly characterized by cardiomyopathy (i.e., Val122Ile,
Thr60Ala, Ser77Tyr, Ile84Ser, Val30Ala, and
His90Asp). There was no a priori determination
Neurol Ther (2020) 9:135–149 137

of which specific diagnostic methods or degree
of documentation constituted a valid diagnosis
of ATTR-PN. It was only required that the
cohort in question was described as one comprised entirely of individuals with ATTR-PN.
Data Extraction and Synthesis
There were two survival outcome categories of
interest for this study.
The first category included time-to-event
survival outcomes, such as survival probabilities, survival percentages, failure probabilities,
and failure percentages as measured from a
baseline event (symptom onset, diagnosis, or
treatment initiation). Where survival outcomes
were reported in figures only, survival data were
extracted using digitization software (Digitizeit,
version 2.3; Braunschweig, Germany). Survival
outcomes were pooled according to clinicopathologic characteristics reported in each
study.
The impacts of clinicopathologic characteristics on survival were analyzed further. To
mitigate the potentially biasing effects of
uneven censoring and varying follow-up times
among the extracted survival outcomes,
patient-level survival data were reconstructed
from reported aggregate-level outcomes using
methods previously described [16– 18]. This disaggregation produced a register of patient-level
survival observations, and those with ‘‘disease
onset’’ as the baseline event (i.e., starting point
from which survival was measured) were considered suitable for further analysis.
Modeling was used to derive survival curves
from the aforementioned patient-level observations. Expecting latent heterogeneity within
the dataset, we applied parametric mixture
modeling that decomposed the overall survival
curve into constituent curves. In other words,
mixture models assume that the overall survival
of a cohort is a function of two or more subgroups: each with its own survival curve that
can be estimated with a standard parametric
distribution. Specifically, the overall survival
S tð Þ for a given cohort was specified as a
weighted average (p) of the constituent
subgroup survival curves (here S1 and S2; e.g.,
LTx and no-LTx) according to Eq. 1:
S tð Þ¼ p:S1ð Þþ t ð Þ 1  p S2ð Þt : ð1Þ
Parameter p denotes the proportion of
patients belonging to the latent subgroup 1.
All model parameters (p, S1, and S2) are
estimated using the flexsurv-library package of
the R programing language for the calculation
of the hazards and survival functions and the
‘‘nlm-command’’ for maximizing the likelihood
function. Standard errors around the estimated
parameters were calculated by taking the
diagonal elements of the inverse Hessian at
the maximum likelihood.
We stratified the survival data into three
classes: (1) LTx versus no LTx; (2) early onset
versus late onset; and (3) V30M (i.e, Val30Met)
versus non-V30M genotype. Survival was estimated for each class via the method described
above, and the mean survival in the class was
calculated as the area under the curve. The
mean [95% confidence interval (CI)] difference
between classes was equal to the difference
between survival means.
The second survival outcome category pertained to clinicopathologic prognostic survival
factors. When assessed by univariate or multivariate analysis to determine their individual
impacts on survival, these factors were recorded
along with the directionality and magnitude of
their effects and subsequently analyzed
descriptively.
Retained studies were classified using the
modified AAN guideline [15] as has been
reported previously [6]. Evidence classifications
ranged from class I (strongest evidence, low risk
of bias) to class IV (weakest evidence, very high
risk of bias). Risk of bias was evaluated primarily
with respect to two considerations: the method
by which the initial ATTR-PN diagnosis was
made and the frequency of follow-up.

RESULTS
The electronic search of the peer-reviewed literature yielded 979 unique records, and the
hand search of conference materials yielded
1014 records. In total, 1993 records were assessed in full, of which 35 were retained (Fig. 1;
Table 1). These reported survival outcomes
assessed over 265,346 person-years [N = 11,116;
median follow-up 10 (range 5–35) years]. Most
of the retained studies were of a longitudinal,
observational design conducted between 1990
and 2007. Risk of bias was low, and evidentiary
quality of the retained studies was moderate
overall (Table 1).
Survival was first assessed descriptively and
by combining the aggregate-level data into
groups according to distinguishing characteristics known to the authors to impact survival
(i.e., genotype, whether one has received a liver
transplant, and whether one has early- or lateonset disease). This preliminary assessment
(figures not shown but available upon request)
confirmed the need for mixture modeling,
which was conducted using disaggregated data
from the 12 studies (45 observations, N = 3348)
with disease onset as the baseline timepoint.
Disaggregated survival data were analyzed
with parametric mixture modeling to assess
survival differences among patient groups
defined by factors known to affect survival. The
most pronounced survival difference (reported
here and subsequently as mean years from
symptom onset to death) was observed between
LTx and non-LTx patients: 26.0 (95% CI
25.0–27.9) versus 12.0 (95% CI 11.2–13.0); difference 15.0 (95% CI 13.7–16.3) (Fig. 2). Also
significant was the survival difference between
early-onset versus late-onset patients: 24.7 (95%
CI 23.4–26.0) versus 12.9 (95% CI 11.0–13.8);
difference 11.8 (95% CI 10.1–13.4) (Fig. 3).
Combining these factors demonstrated that LTx
patients with early-onset disease had significantly longer survival than LTx patients with
late-onset disease: 26.6 (95% CI 25.6–27.4) versus 13.1 (95% CI 11.6–14.7); difference 13.5
(95% CI 11.7–15.3) (Fig. 4). However, the same
comparison among non-LTx patients yielded a
non-significant difference (12.7 vs. 12.5).
A comparison between V30M genotype versus non-V30M genotype indicated longer

survival for V30M (22.2 vs. 10.4), but the trend
was not significant owing to limited observations for non-V30M patients.
Of the 35 retained studies, eight reported the
outcomes of multivariate survival analysis
(Table 2). Other than LTx status, the clinicopathologic survival factors identified as having a
statistically significant impact on survival
included sex/gender, pre-LTx disease duration,
and symptoms of disease progression [e.g.,
modified body mass index (mBMI), serum
albumin levels at the time of LTx, and the
presence/absence of urinary incontinence at the
time of LTx]. These observations indicated that
female sex/gender, B 7-year disease duration by
the time of LTx, mBMI [600, and a lack of
urinary incontinence at LTx were all associated
with improved survival versus matched
comparisons.

of patient subgroups for whom survival differs
from the commonly-cited 10–15 years—in some
cases markedly less [52]. For non-LTx patients,
heterogeneity was most evident among those
with non-Val30Met genotypes for whom median survival was poorer compared to persons
with the ATTRv Val30Met (6.3 vs. 12.1 years
after onset). Furthermore, those who underwent
LTx had better survival than those who were
untreated (21.8 vs. 9.6 years). Evidence of the
impact of disease-modifying pharmacological
treatments was limited but demonstrated survival benefits of tafamidis versus no treatment
and potentially versus LTx.
Aside from genotype and treatment experience, other baseline non-cardiac clinicopathologic characteristics associated with shorter
survival included longer disease duration before
LTx, late-onset disease, and lower mBMI. Given
the previously known associations of many of
the non-cardiac clinicopathologic survival factors identified in this study with baseline

disease progression and the negative relationship between baseline disease progression and
survival time [53], some of our findings are
unsurprising. There were, however,
notable studies demonstrating the impact of
competing prognostic factors on survival. For
example, at 20 years of follow-up after ATTRv
Val30Met onset, Okamoto et al. [40] reported a
non-significant effect of sex on survival at
15 years of follow-up after disease onset for
those with early-onset disease (76 vs. 78%,
p = 0.33); in contrast, when the same comparison was evaluated among LTx patients with
late-onset disease, the difference was significant
[69% (females) vs. 37% (males); p = 0.02]. The
significant effect of sex in late-onset patients—
who typically present with more advanced cardiac symptoms—despite no such finding in
early-onset patients highlights intra-genotype
survival differences that may be mitigated by
sex and disease onset. Another example was
reported by Adams et al. [19] who demonstrated
that the survival benefits of LTx can be entirely
negated by advanced disease progression at
baseline, as indicated by a Norris score B 55.
We also assessed the risk of bias and evidentiary quality of the records retained in this
review and, notably, both were within acceptable limits overall. These metrics were largely
based on the definitiveness of the ATTRv
amyloidosis diagnosis (i.e., genetic and histological testing) and the transparency by which
diagnoses were reported. Given that many of
the retained records reported LTx cohorts and
that histological and genetic testing are often
required for LTx [25, 53], it follows that the
records retained for this review would be scored
highly.
This study has limitations which should be
noted. First, in 1996 there began a more concerted, evidence-driven effort to optimize
patient selection for LTx globally [40, 53]. LTxassociated survival benefits reported here may
have been downwardly biased due to our having grouped data from patients who underwent
LTx in pre- and post-1996 time periods, whereas
survival after LTx in a contemporary treatment
setting may be longer. This implies a related
limitation: that due to lack of evidence it was
not possible to control for patients having been
at different stages of disease progression at the
time of LTx or starting other treatments. Third,
this study is limited to patients who received no
treatment, underwent LTx, or received tafamidis due to these being the only ATTR-PN
patients with long-term survival outcomes
(i.e., C 5 years). There are other treatments
available or currently being evaluated to treat
ATTR-PN, but there are as yet insufficient survival follow-up data on these treatments. Lastly,
Fig. 4 Impact of timing of disease onset. Cohorts with LTx and no early-onset disease (LTx ? NO early onset) are shown
to have shorter modeled survival versus cohorts with LTx and early-onset disease (LTx ? Early onset)

survival is only one outcome—albeit a critical
one—for evaluating ATTR-PN disease progression, whereas progression of neuropathy would
also have been an informative endpoint had
sufficient evidence been available. Similarly, our
survival analysis did not consider the implications of cardiac sequelae, which have been
reported extensively in the literature and are
important because our objective was to look at
the impact of non-cardiac factors.

CONCLUSION
Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, this study evaluates survival in individual
ATTR-PN subgroups for whom survival has
often been imprecisely defined. Our estimates
indicate that 10- to 15-year survival is an overlyoptimistic assumption for many patients. Median survival for untreated patients with nonVal30Met genotypes is considerably worse than
that for Val30Met disease, with survival
approximately 6 years from symptom onset in
the former and approximately 12 years in the
latter. Conversely, the 10- to 15-year survival
estimate that is commonly used may underestimate the benefits of definitive treatment with
LTx or disease-modifying treatment with medications. Median survival may range from 14 to
25 years from symptom onset in treated
patients, depending on the genotype of the
disease and the extent of disease progression by
the time treatment is started. Nevertheless, the
evidence presented here demonstrates that
ATTR-PN is quite heterogenous and, consequently, that our understanding of the prognosis of these patients should be similarly
nuanced.
