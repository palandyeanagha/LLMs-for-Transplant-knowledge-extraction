Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of panel-based NGS in the diagnostic approach
of monogenic cholestatic liver diseases.
Study design: Patients with diagnosis of chronic cholestatic liver disease of an
unknown etiology underwent NGS of targeted genes panel. Group 1 included five
patients (prospectively recruited) hospitalized from January to December 2017 while
group 2 included seventeen patients (retrospectively recruited) hospitalized from 2010 to
2017 presenting with low-GGT PFIC phenotype (group 2a, 11 patients) or indeterminant
cholestatic liver cirrhosis (group 2b, 6 patients).
Results: Among 22 patients enrolled into the study, 21 various pathogenic variants
(including 11 novel) in 5 different genes (including ABCB11, ABCB4, TJP2, DGUOK,
CYP27A1) were identified. The molecular confirmation was obtained in 15 out of 22
patients (68%). In group 1, two out of five patients presented with low-GGT cholestasis,
and were diagnosed with BSEP deficiency. Out of three patients presenting with
high-GGT cholestasis, one patient was diagnosed with PFIC-3, and the remaining
two were not molecularly diagnosed. In group 2a, seven out of eleven patients, were
diagnosed with BSEP deficiency and two with TJP-2 deficiency. In group 2b, three out of
six patients were molecularly diagnosed; one with PFIC-3, one with CYP27A1 deficiency,
and one with DGUOK deficiency.
Conclusions: Panel-based NGS appears to be a very useful tool in diagnosis of
monogenic cholestatic liver disorders in cases when extrahepatic causes have been
primarily excluded. NGS presented the highest diagnosis rate to identify the molecular
background of cholestatic liver diseases presenting with a low-GGT PFIC phenotype.

Lipinski et al. ´ Panel-Based NGS in Cholestasis
BACKGROUND
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology including
targeted gene panels, whole-exome sequencing (WES), or
even whole-genome sequencing (WGS), have now opened
promising possibilities to identify the molecular background of
rare diseases, also in the field of pediatric hepatology and liver
transplantation (1–3). It is estimated that nearly 20% of liver
transplantation (LTx) procedures in children are performed
due to monogenic, mostly cholestatic, liver disorders (4, 5).
The identificable causes of cholestasis have grown recently due
to application of NGS (5, 6). The latest guidelines from the
European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology,
and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) have also recommended the use of
modern, broad-based NGS sequencing in the proper clinical
context (7).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility
of panel-based NGS in the diagnostic approach of monogenic
cholestatic liver diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Five patients which were hospitalized in our center from January
to December 2017 with diagnosis of chronic cholestatic liver
disease of an unknown etiology were prospectively recruited to
the study (group 1). Cholestasis was defined based on serum
direct bilirubin concentration >1.0 mg/dL according to the latest
ESPGHAN recommendations (7). The diagnosis of cholestatic
liver disease of unknown etiology was established based on the
following criteria:
(1) exclusion of known infectious (based on serology (IgM
and IgG) of HAV, HBV, HCV, EBV, CMV, HSV-1, HSV2, TORCH infections; bacterial cultures of blood and urine)
causes of cholestasis; (2) exclusion of known metabolic (based
on urine organic analysis with GC/MS profiling, acylcarnitine
profile by tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MS/MS) of
DBS, serum transferrin IEF, blood ammonia and lactate, serum
amino acids, urinary glycosaminoglycans testing, serum very
long chain fatty acids levels, urine and serum arabitol levels,
morning cortisol levels, thyreotropine and free thyroxine levels,
serum α1-antitrypsin levels, serum immunoreactive trypsinogen
level as a part of newborn screening program) causes of
cholestasis; (3) exclusion of Alagille syndrome according to the
classical definition of the presence of three of five major clinical
criteria (8); (4) in patients presenting with hypo-/acholic stools
and/or elevated GGT cholestasis exclusion of biliary atresia (by
histopathologic examination of liver biopsy specimens and/or
an intraoperative cholangiography in selected cases) and other

causes of extrahepatic cholestasis (by an ultrasound examination
and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in selected
cases). The reference ranges for GGT in the 1st year of life were in
accordance with Cabrera-Abreu and Green (9). In some patients
presenting with intrahepatic cholestasis of an unknown etiology,
the liver biopsy has been done.
The second group of patients was recruited retrospectively
and included 17 patients which hospitalized in our center
from 2010 to 2017 with a diagnosis of chronic cholestatic liver
disease of unknown etiology. Based on clinical, biochemical,
and histological presentation, this group was divided into
patients presenting with low-GGT PFIC phenotype (group 2a,
11 patients) or indeterminant cholestatic liver cirrhosis (group
2b, 6 patients). The low-GGT PFIC phenotype was diagnosed
based on (1) low (normal) serum GGT activity; (2) early
(neonatal/infantile) onset of cholestasis; (3) exclusion of known
infectious and metabolic causes of cholestasis (as mentioned
above); (4) a progressive disease course; (5) liver histopathology
examination resembling those in PFIC patients. The diagnosis of
liver cirrhosis was based on the histopathological examination of
liver biopsy specimens.
Genomic DNA was extracted by automated method
(MagnaPure; Roche, CA) from peripheral blood samples of the
patients. NGS of targeted genes panel, created by The Children’s
Memorial Health Institute’s for the simultaneous sequencing
of 1000 clinically relevant genes including 53 items related to
cholestatic liver disorders was used as a genetic target in all
patients. Coding regions (excluding non-transcribed exons) and
bordering intron sequences of the following genes: ABCB11,
ABCB4, AGL, ALDOB, ATP7B, ATP8B1, BCS1L, CFTR, CLDN1,
CYP27A1, DGUOK, DHCR7, EPCAM, FAH, FH, GFM1, HNF1A,

due to highly homologous regions), NPC1, NPC2, PEX1,
PEX10, PEX11B, PEX12, PEX13, PEX14, PEX16, PEX19, PEX2,

SLC25A13, SMPD1, TJP2, TRMU, UGT1A1, VIPAS39, VPS33B
were analyzed.
NGS was performed on a HiSeq 1500 platform (Illumina, CA)
using custom NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Choice Library (Roche,
CA) according to a published protocol (10). Generated reads
were first merged and low-quality reads removed. Then the reads
were aligned to the hg19 (GRCh37) reference human genome.
Potential PCR duplicates and reads mapping to multiple genomic
locations were removed. In variant calling, any call with the
ratio smaller than 0.2 was assumed to be homozygous, and the
rest—heterozygous. Alignments were viewed with Integrative
Genomics Viewer v. 2.3.82. The detected variants were annotated
using Annovar and converted to MS Access format for final
manual analysis.
All the non-coding and common variants (minor allele
frequency above 0.01 in the general population) were discarded.
The rare variants affecting the coding regions were filtered basing
on the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and predicted
consequences at the transcript level. The variants were prioritized
according to the population frequency and the predicted effect on
the protein.

Lipinski et al. ´ Panel-Based NGS in Cholestasis
In order to detect potentially causative variants from NGS
data, we applied a computational algorithm termed Phenotypic
Interpretation of eXomes (PhenIX) (11). The software evaluates
and ranks detected gene variants based on pathogenicity
and semantic similarity of patients’ phenotype described by
Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to those of known
Mendelian diseases.
The nomenclature of molecular variants follows the Human
Genome Variation Society guidelines (HGVS, http://varnomen.
hgvs.org/) using human cDNA sequence of appropriate genes
followed the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD, http://
www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk).
The chart review of patients’ medical records concerning the
age of onset, as well as biochemical, histological, and molecular
data were collected.
An informed and written consent was obtained from patients
and their parents. Ethical approval of the study protocol
was obtained from the Children’s Memorial Health Institute
Bioethical Committee, Warsaw, Poland.
RESULTS
Twenty-two patients, including 14 males and 8 females, were
enrolled into the study. All patients were of Caucasian ancestry
and had unrelated parents. Group 1 included 5 patients (23%)
with a mean age 4 years of first signs and symptoms (median 2
months, age range 1 month−14 years) and 7 years at molecular
analysis. Group 2a included 11 patients (50%) with a mean age
9 months of first signs and symptoms (median 6 months, age
range 1–11 months) and 8 years at molecular analysis. Group 2b
included 6 patients (27%) with a mean age 10 months of first signs
and symptoms (median 2 months, age range 1 month−4 years)
and 9 years at molecular analysis (in one patient post mortem).
Among 22 patients enrolled into the study, 21 various
pathogenic variants (including 11 novel) in five different genes
(including ABCB11, ABCB4, TJP2, DGUOK, and CYP27A1) were
identified. The molecular confirmation of monogenic cholestatic
liver disease was obtained in 15 out of 22 patients (68%). In the
second study group, the positive molecular detection rate was
higher than in the first group (70 vs. 60%).
In group 1, two out of five patients had presented with lowGGT cholestasis, and they were subsequently diagnosed with
bile salt export pump (BSEP) deficiency. Out of three patients
presenting with high-GGT cholestasis, one patient was diagnosed
with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC-3),
and the remaining two patients were not molecularly diagnosed
in NGS.
In group 2, all but one had presented with low-GGT
cholestasis. Low-GGT PFIC phenotype was observed in 11 out
of 17 patients while indeterminant cholestatic liver cirrhosis was
reported in the remaining six patients. In patients presenting
with low-GGT PFIC phenotype, the partial external biliary
diversion (PEBD) procedure was performed in four of them,
at a median age of 2 years (age range 0.5–6 years), due to
an ineffective ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy. In one
of them, the ileal-bypass procedure had to be performed (one
month after PEBD). Overall, out of all patients presenting with
low-GGT PFIC phenotype, seven were diagnosed with bile salt
export pump (BSEP) deficiency and two patients were diagnosed
with tight junction protein 2 (TJP-2) deficiency. Two patients
(including one with high-GGT cholestasis) were not molecularly
diagnosed in panel-based NGS. Out of six patients presenting
with indeterminant cholestatic liver cirrhosis, the living donor
LTx was performed in all of them at a median age of 3 years
and 4 months. Overall, in this group, one patient was diagnosed
with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3), one patient was diagnosed with bile acid synthesis defect
(CYP27A1 deficiency), and one patient was diagnosed with
mitochondrial depletion syndrome (DGUOK deficiency). Three
patients were not molecularly diagnosed in panel-based NGS.
The child diagnosed with CYP27A1 deficiency had succumbed
at 3.5 years of age due to the graft failure observed 3 months
after LTx.
Detailed characteristics of the clinical, biochemical,
histological, and molecular phenotypes of the presented
patients is summarized in Table 1.
DISCUSSION
The study presented a high clinical utility of panel-based NGS in
the diagnostic approach of monogenic cholestatic liver diseases
in pediatric hepatology and liver transplant center.
There have been published a few studies which have
assessed a comprehensive molecular analysis approach
based on high-throughput sequencing (panel-based NGS)
for neonatal/infantile cholestasis (12–15). The diagnostic
yield of panel-based NGS was reported to be various,
mostly depending on the patients selection criteria. The
diagnostic yield in our study was high because the patients
were enrolled in a referral center with facilities of liver
transplantation. The highest diagnosis rate was noted to
identify the molecular background of cholestatic liver diseases
presenting with a low-GGT PFIC phenotype. Similarly to
the literature, the important value of applying NGS was
reported in cases of an early onset cholestasis to rapidly identify
the molecular background of disorders causing low-GGT
PFIC (12–15).
Togawa et al. (12) performed the study on usefulness of NGS
panel containing 18 genes in children with neonatal/infantile
intrahepatic cholestasis. Out of 109 patients recruited, 31 (28%)
were molecularly diagnosed. This low diagnostic yield could
be related to the patients selection criteria, because besides the
patients clinically diagnosed with known genetic cholestasis,
there were included children with probable non-genetic causes
such as prematurity, infections, metabolic, and endocrinological
abnormalities. Other cause of low diagnostic yield could be using
NGS panel with only 18 genes compared to the gene panel
with 53 genes applied in our studies. The positive molecular
diagnosis rate in the group clinically diagnosed with known
genetic cholestasis syndromes such as Alagille syndrome, PFIC,
neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency
and Dubin–Johnson syndrome was 71% (22/31). This rate is

comparable with our results regarding the group presenting with
low-GGT PFIC phenotype.
In the study of Chen et al. (13), 102 patients presenting
with various forms of cholestasis or idiopathic liver disease were
recruited and subsequently underwent a molecular analysis by
NGS panel containing 52 genes. The overall diagnostic yield
of genetic diagnoses was 33 of 102 (32%) patients. A greater
diagnostic yield was noted in 25 of 37 (68%) patients with
suspected genetic diseases including PFIC (16/27, 59%), Wilson
disease (5/5, 100%), or syndromic cholestasis (4/5, 80%). The
latter results are comparable with ours highlighting the usefulness
of panel-based NGS in diagnosing patients with genetic liver
diseases in a proper clinical setting.
Nicastro et al. (14) have recently presented a diagnostic
protocol addressed to all newborns and infants with persistent
cholestasis. The stool color, GGT level, and liver biopsy pattern
were the main determinants aiming to timely diagnose the
extrahepatic causes of cholestasis and then, define the group
of patients with suspected monogenic diseases. Overall, genetic
testing allowed a final diagnosis in 29 of 48, with a 60%
detection rate. Among the inherited disorders identified, the most
frequent were Alagille syndrome and PFIC1–3. According to
Nicastro et al. (14) we acknowledge that targeted NGS appears
to be a very useful tool in diagnosis of monogenic cholestatic
liver disorders in cases when extrahepatic causes have been
primarily excluded.

Lipinski et al. ´ Panel-Based NGS in Cholestasis
The diagnostic approach of neonatal/infantile cholestasis
is traditionally based on clinical, biochemical, imaging, and
histopathological findings (7). The identificable causes of
cholestasis have grown recently due to application of NGS
technology (6). Molecular analysis is also helpful to expand
the genotypic spectrum of diseases presenting with similar
phenotypes (6). The pathogenic variants in TJP2 (encoding
the TJP2 protein which is essential for tightness of cell
junctions between the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts),
NR1H4 (encoding the regulatory FXR of bile acids synthesis
and enterohepatic flow) and MYO5B genes have been found
recently in patients presenting with phenotype resembling BSEP
deficiency (16–18). In our study we found two patients to
be affected with TJP2 deficiency presenting with low-GGT
PFIC phenotype.
There are also some diagnostic methods like urine bile acids
analysis using liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry,
that are not routinely available worldwide yet (19). The
introduction of targeted NGS allowed us to diagnose disorders
which have not been recognized yet, like inborn errors of bile
acids metabolism (CYP27A1 deficiency).
The molecular characterization constitutes the essential
determinant for making decisions about the medical
management, including liver transplantation (LTx). Currently,
we know about the development of progressive fatty liver disease
in some FIC1 deficient patients after Ltx (20, 21). LTx still
remains controversial in the group of hepatic mitochondrial
DNA depletion syndromes due to an extrahepatic involvement,
possible neurological deterioration and unpredictable outcome
(19, 22). However, in our center, like in the others worldwide,
LTx is sometimes performed before molecular confirmation of
the underlying disease. That is why, targeted NGS is essential
to timely diagnose the underlying monogenic disease. In our
study, NGS helped to identify one patient with mild form of
DGUOK deficiency.
NGS sequencing is also very useful in diagnosis of ABCB4
deficiency due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation (23).
Dröge et al. (24) in the cohort of 427 patients with suspected
genetic cholestasis observed that the median age of symptoms
onset in PFIC-3 patients was later than in patients with PFIC1 or PFIC-2. Schatz et al. (25) have also described the national
survey data on ABCB4 disease highlighting that the younger
disease onset, the more severe phenotype, and patients with
milder phenotypes could be not diagnosed before adulthood. In
our study, we molecularly diagnosed two patients with ABCB4
deficiency—the first one with milder phenotype and symptom
onset in adulthood and the second one with more severe
phenotype requiring LTx early in life.
Although the presented information is not new, the study
provided useful information documenting the diagnostic value of
NGS panel in cholestatic liver disease, especially those with lowGGT cholestasis. One missense mutation p.Asp482Gly was the
most frequent in our patients. Novelty was given by description
of new pathogenetic variants for cholestatic liver diseases.
CONCLUSIONS
1. Panel-based NGS appears to be a very useful tool in diagnosis
of monogenic cholestatic liver disorders in cases when
extrahepatic causes have been primarily excluded.
2. NGS presented the highest diagnosis rate to identify the
molecular background of cholestatic liver diseases presenting
with a low-GGT PFIC phenotype.
