Abstract
Objective: The present study applied the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
(STROBE) statement to observational studies published in prestigious occupational medicine and health journals.
Results: A total of 60 articles was evaluated. All sub-items were reported in 63.74% (95% confdence interval [CI], 
56.24–71.24%), not reported in 29.70% (95% CI, 20.2–39.2%), and not applicable in 6.56% (95% CI, 4.86–8.26%) of the 
studies. Of the 45 sub-items investigated in this survey, eight were reported 100% of the time, 13 were addressed in 
more than 90% of the articles, 22 were included in more than 75% of the studies, and 27 sub-items were applied in 
more than 50% of the articles published in the journals included in this study.

Introduction
Observational studies have an important role in researching the benefts and harms of medical interventions [1]. 
Te results of these studies should be reported as transparently as possible “so that readers can follow what was 
planned, what was done, what was found, and what conclusions were drawn” [2]. Te credibility of a research 
depends on a critical assessment by others, in the study 
design, conduct, and analysis of it [3]. In order to assess 
the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence from the 
observational studies von Elm et  al. designed in 2007 a 
22-item checklist to assist with clear reporting of observational studies called: the Strengthening the Reporting 
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) 
Statement [2]. Tis checklist includes a description of 
methodological items and instructions on how to use 
them to transparently report observational studies. Several extensions of these statements have been published 
with additional recommendations for specialized felds 
of research—for example, the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for Newborn Infection (STROBE-NI) [4] and Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology—
nutritional epidemiology (STROBE-nut) [5].
To our knowledge, the quality of reporting in occupational observational studies has not been assessed. 
Observational study designs are often used in studies 
published in occupational medicine and health journals. Terefore, the present study investigated the quality of occupational observational studies reporting

value of new data and avoid wasted research.
Main text
Methods
Journal identifcation
We conducted a cross-sectional study and selected four 
top occupational medicine and health journals with highimpact factors (IFs) based on the Information Sciences 
Institute (ISI) in the Web of Knowledge (http://www.
webofknowledge.com, date of access 14 Aug 2017) as of 
2016, including journals in the frst quartile in category 
(Q1) of scientifc journal ranking (http://www.scimagojr.
com, date of access 14 Aug 2017) among the most prestigious and impactful occupational medicine and health 
journals indexed in international databases. In addition, 
we checked the `Instruction for authors’ section of the 
websites for each of the included journals to determine 
if they contained the STROBE statement for authors or 
endorsed it as a guideline for reporting observational 
research articles (Table 1).
Study search and selection
We frst evaluated the archives from January 1 until 
July 19, 2017, to retrieve observational studies (cohort, 
cross sectional) studies published in each of the four 
prestigious occupational medicine and health journals. 
Accordingly, we enrolled 60 observational articles in our 
study, which were randomly assigned to two reviewers 
without blinding the name of the journal or the authors 
of the articles. Te reviewers independently made decisions regarding the number of items from the STROBE 
check-list which were addressed in the selected studies.
Reliability and validity adherence
To check the judgment of two reviewers regarding the 
quality of observational studies, we conducted a pilot 
study as follows: frst, among the articles that were previously retrieved, an article was selected randomly and the 
strengths and weaknesses of its evidence were assessed 
based on the predetermined checklist of items. Any disagreement over the items was discussed to reach the same 
interpretation of the checklist in order to increase the 
reliability between the two reviewers.
Second, two articles were selected randomly from 
among all the selected studies for the two reviewers to 
evaluate the checklist items based on three choices for 
each sub-item (reported/not reported/not applicable). 
Tis work was done in order to calculate an indicator of 
the reliability between two reviewers, the KAPPA statistic, in evaluating the items of the STROBE checklist in 
the selected articles. Te KAPPA statistic was calculated 
according to the formula below:
Landis and Koch suggested that a Kappa greater than 
0.75 represents excellent agreement beyond chance, 
a Kappa below 0.40 represents poor agreement and a 
Kappa of 0.40–0.75 represents intermediate to good 
agreement [6]. Based on Additional fle 1: Table  S1 and 
Additional fle  2: Table  S2, the Kappa statistic between 
reviewers A and B in this study was 53%
KAPPA = (Percent agreement observed) − (Percent agreement expected by chance alone )
100% − (Percent agreement expected by chance alone) =
KAPPA = 76.7 − 50.86%
100 − 50.86% = 0.53.

in each of the selected journals. During this period, we 
identifed enough cohort and cross sectional studies, but 
did not fnd enough case–control studies; thus, only for 
this type of study, we expanded the search range from 
January 1, 2016, to July 19, 2017. Te search revealed 188 
observational articles.
Second, the types of articles were classifed according 
to the journal in which they were published. Next, a specifc number was assigned to each selected article and, 
based on random numbers table, we randomly selected 
15 observational (fve each cohort, case–control, and

In order to assess the validity of the reviewers’ judgments in this cross-sectional study, reviewers A (J. Ah) 
and B (K. Mo) read and scored the included observational articles and independently made decisions regarding the quality of reporting in each observational study. 
Any disagreements were resolved by adjudication with 
the third (I. Mo) and fourth authors (B. Ma).
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp; Armonk, 
NY, USA). Te absolute frequencies and percentages of 
each sub-item in the selected articles were addressed. Te 
total percentage for all sub-items (1–22) was reported 
(Table 2).
Results
Figure  1 shows the fow diagram of the search process 
and the numbers of observational articles included at 
each stage of the study published in prestigious scientifc 
occupational medicine and health journals in 2016–2017. 
During the search process, of 281 original articles, 93 
were not observational studies and were excluded from 
the study. Finally, we selected 60 observational studies 
from four prestigious scientifc occupational medicine 
and health journals, including Scand J Work Environ 
Health, Occup Environ Med, J Occup Environ Med, and 
Am J Ind Med.
Te absolute frequencies and percentages of items and 
sub-items addressed by these studies are summarized 
in Table 2. Te sub-items were reported in 63.74% (95% 
confdence interval[CI], 56.24–71.24%), not reported in 
29.70% (95% CI, 20.2–39.2%), and not applicable in 6.56% 
(95% CI, 4.86–8.26%) of the cohort, case–control, and 
cross sectional studies. Tis table also shows that, of the 
45 sub-items investigated in this survey, collectively, eight 
sub-items were reported 100% of the time, 13 sub-items 
were addressed in more than 90% of the articles, 22 subitems were included in more than 75% of the studies, and 
27 sub-items were applied in more than 50% of the articles assessed from the journals included in this study.
Additional fle  3: Figure S3 shows the percentages of 
adequately reported STROBE sub-items in articles published in the top four occupational medicine and health 
journals. In this fgure, sub-items including 2-Introduction, 7a-Outcomes, 8a-Sources of data, 12a-Control for 
confounding, 15-N of outcome events, 18-Key results, 
20a-Interpretation, and 20b-Similar studies were all 
reported in the articles published in the four prestigious 
journals included in this study.
Additional fle  4: Figure S4 shows the percentages of 
STROBE sub-items not reported in articles published in 
the top four occupational medicine and health journals. 
Collectively, the fve sub-items with the lowest reporting 
in the articles were 12f-Sensitivity analyses, 13b-Nonparticipation, 17-Other analyses, 14b-N of participants 
with missing data, and 12c-Interactions.
Additional fle 5: Figure S5 shows that among 45 subitems in the STROBE statement, those such as 12e-Loss 
to follow-up, 6d-N of exposed and unexposed, and 
6c-matching criteria were the most common not applicable items in the articles included in the present study.
Discussion
Te STROBE statement provides valuable recommendations for all authors when reporting the results of analytical observational studies, supports editors and reviewers 
when considering these articles for publication, and 
helped readers to critically appraise published articles [2]. 
In total, approximately 63.47% of the items and sub-items 
in the STROBE checklist were reported in cohort, case–
control, and cross-sectional studies published in the four 
journals of occupational medicine and health included in 
the present study, 11 years after the dissemination of the 
STROBE statement. However, numerous observational 
studies are published in less fastidious peer-reviewed 
occupational medicine and health journals. Tus, it is 
expected that the quality of reporting of such studies is 
poorer than that reported in the present survey, although 
the results of the present study indicate that even this 
quality is not sufcient. To our knowledge, this study is 
the frst to assess the quality of reporting of observational 
studies in occupational medicine and health literature; 
however, similar work has been performed in other disciplines; for example, Hendriksma et al. [7]. in 2016 conducted a similar study to evaluate the quality of reporting 
of observational studies in otorhinolaryngology based on 
the STROBE statement. Tey reported that the articles in 
the top fve general medical journals reported a mean of 
69.2% (95% CI 65.8±72.7%) of items, compared to 51.4% 
(95% CI 47.7±55.0%) in the top fve ear, nose, and throat 
journals. Tese results are similar to the mean of 63.74% 
(95% CI 56.24–71.24%) obtained in our study. Jeelani 
et al. [8]. conducted a similar study in 2014 to assess the 
quality of reporting of cross-sectional studies published 
in the Indian Journal of Community Medicine by evaluating the extent to which they adhered to the STROBE 
statement. In this study, the most frequently reported 
checklist items included the summary of what was done 
and what was found in the abstract, background/rationale, objectives, setting, outcome data, key results in the 
discussion, and interpretation of results. In our study 
(Additional fle 2: Table S2) the most frequently reported 
STROBE checklist items were the explanation of the scientifc background and rationale for the investigation 
being reported; clearly defning all outcomes; providing

sources of data; and describing all statistical methods, 
including those used to control for confounding; reporting the numbers of outcome events or summary measures; summarizing key results with reference to study 
objectives; providing a cautious interpretation of results 
considering the objectives, and explaining the results of 
similar studies. Te fndings in our study are consistent 
with those reported in the previous study [8, 9].
In 2016, Agha et  al. [9] assessed the compliance 
of observational studies in plastic surgery using the 
STROBE statement checklist. Te average STROBE score 
in his study was 12.4 (range 2–20.1) with a standard deviation of 3.36. Tis mean in plastic surgery articles is not 
satisfactory and lower than the average obtained from the 
occupational medicine and health journals evaluated in 
the present study.
Te results of this study reveal that the quality reporting of observational studies published in the most prestigious occupational medicine and health journals is yet 
not clear and desirable enough. Tus, this issue should be 
the focus of the both authors’ and editors’ special attention when reporting and/or reviewing the reports of 
observational studies.
Limitations
•First, the random selection of cohort, case–control, 
and cross sectional studies from prestigious occupational medicine and health journals may result in a 
selection bias in the results.
•Second, the limited number of articles selected and 
evaluated in this survey, may in-crease the possibility 
of random error.
•Tird, the quality and accuracy of the STROBE subitems addressed in the selected articles depended 
primarily on the judgment of the reviewer, which 
increased the probability of information bias in the 
results.
