Abstract Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; Hunter
syndrome) is a rare X-linked recessive disease caused by
deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulphatase,
leading to progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans
in nearly all cell types, tissues and organs. Clinical manifestations include severe airway obstruction, skeletal deformities,
cardiomyopathy and, in most patients, neurological decline.
Death usually occurs in the second decade of life, although
some patients with less severe disease have survived into their
fifth or sixth decade. Until recently, there has been no effective
therapy for MPS II, and care has been palliative. Enzyme
replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human iduronate-2-sulphatase (idursulfase), however, has now been
introduced. Weekly intravenous infusions of idursulfase have
been shown to improve many of the signs and symptoms and
overall wellbeing in patients with MPS II. This paper provides
an overview of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and
symptomatic management of patients with MPS II and
provides recommendations for the use of ERT. The issue of
treating very young patients and those with CNS involvement
is also discussed. ERT with idursulfase has the potential to
benefit many patients with MPS II, especially if started early
in the course of the disease.

Introduction
First described by Major Charles Hunter in 1917 [15],
mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II or Hunter syndrome;
OMIM +309900) is an X-linked recessive disease caused by
deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulphatase
(I2S). This enzyme cleaves O-linked sulphate moieties from
the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan sulphate and
heparan sulphate as the first step in their degradative
pathway. The clinical phenotype of MPS II (Fig. 1) is
characterised by progressive pathological lysosomal storage
of GAGs in nearly all cell types, tissues and organs.
Oropharyngeal and tracheo-bronchial deposition of GAGs
leads to severe airway obstruction due to macroglossia,
supraglottic narrowing, and tracheomalacia. This obstructive
anatomy and physiology leads to sleep apnoea and airway
obstruction. As the disease progresses, the respiratory system
is further compromised by pulmonary restriction secondary to
the effects of the disease on the thoracic skeleton. Deposition
of GAGs in the heart, liver and spleen leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac valve dysplasia and hepatosplenomegaly. Bone
and joint involvement results in severe skeletal deformities
and limitations of joint mobility. In patients with CNS
involvement, severe learning difficulties and progressive
neurological decline occur. The clinical manifestations of
MPS II generally lead to death in the first or second decade of
life, although in the more attenuated form of MPS II, death
may occur in early adulthood, and some patients have
survived into their fifth and sixth decades of life.
Until recently, there has been no effective therapy for
MPS II. Care has been palliative, focusing on management
of the multiple clinical symptoms. Haematopoietic stem cell
therapy (HSCT) has been attempted in some patients [36],
but the long-term results have been unsatisfactory. The
recent introduction of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
with recombinant human I2S (idursulfase), however, has
raised the possibility that the burden of GAG storage can be
reduced and that the progressive tissue and organ damage
associated with MPS II can be slowed or even prevented.
The availability of ERT thus requires a greater awareness
and understanding of the disease amongst a range of
medical specialists and primary care physicians, so that
early diagnosis can be made and treatment started before
organ damage becomes irreversible.
This article gives an overview of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and symptomatic management of patients
with MPS II and provides, for the first time, recommendations for the use of ERT.
Incidence and inheritance
Data from The Netherlands and Germany indicate that the
incidence of MPS II is 1.3 per 100,000 male live births [1, 23].
Two-thirds of patients present with CNS involvement,
representing the more severe end of the disease phenotype.
There have been very few reports of recurrent or common
mutations within the gene encoding I2S. As a consequence,
genotype–phenotype correlations have been difficult to
establish, with the exception of those patients who present
with large deletions, which are most often associated with
more severe disease [38].
As MPS II is an X-linked recessive condition, it would
not be expected to affect females. Despite this, a few girls
have been reported with MPS II [35]. Affected females
generally have low levels of I2S activity and an attenuated
clinical phenotype, although the somatic abnormalities can
be severe in some individuals. In affected heterozygous
females, skewed inactivation of the X-chromosome prevents expression of the normal allele [35].
Molecular basis of MPS II
MPS II is the only known X-linked MPS disorder. The
human gene encoding I2S has been mapped to Xq28. It

contains nine exons spread over 24 kb. Individuals with
major deletions or rearrangements in the gene usually have
severe MPS II. An I2S-like pseudogene, comprising copies
of exons 2 and 3 and intron 7, is located about 20 kb from
the active gene [34]. A recurring rearrangement is due to
recombination between the intron region of the gene and a
homologous region near exon 3 of the pseudogene, with
inversion of the intervening DNA [3]. Very large deletions
of the I2S locus may extend to adjoining genes, as the
neighbouring DNA is gene rich. A contiguous gene
syndrome involving fragile X mental retardation (FMR1
and FMR2) genes could possibly explain the unusual
phenotypes seen in some severely affected patients [33].
Over 150 different mutations, resulting in a spectrum of
disease phenotypes, have been described.
General disease manifestations and diagnosis
Treatment of possible disease complications can greatly
improve quality of life. Early diagnosis is therefore
essential, particularly with the recent introduction of ERT.
Table 1 shows the common presenting features of patients
with MPS II, together with the range of specialists who are
likely to be involved in diagnosis and care.
Clinical spectrum of MPS II
MPS II is a variable, progressive, multisystem disorder. In
most patients, symptoms are severe and death occurs at an
early age. In other patients the disease has a more chronic
and protracted course. The age of presentation of MPS II is
also variable, as are the presenting signs and disease
complications. Figure 2 shows the age at onset of the main
signs and symptoms of the disease in a cohort of 82 patients
enrolled in HOS, the Hunter Outcome Survey. This is a
multinational long-term outcomes survey to investigate the
natural history of MPS II and the safety and efficacy of
ERT with idursulfase [8].
The traditional classification of patients into ‘mild’ or
‘severe’ subtypes, on the basis of length of survival and the
presence or absence of CNS disease, is a gross simplification. The disorder should rather be regarded as a continuum
between two extremes (severe and attenuated). It is
important to note that individuals who are diagnosed with
an attenuated form of the disease may still have symptoms
and complications that lead to significant morbidity and
disability, and may present with mild to moderate learning
difficulties. Although the clinical course for the more
severely affected patients is relatively predictable, there is
considerable variability in the clinical phenotype and
progression of the more attenuated form of the disease.
Individuals with attenuated MPS II are most often
diagnosed between the ages of 4 and 8 years. For the majority
of these affected patients, the clinical course is very similar to
the intermediate form of MPS I (MPS IH/S, Hurler–Scheie
disease). Survival to adulthood is common, but death often
occurs between the ages of 20 and 30 years from cardiac or
respiratory disease (Fig. 3). A few patients are less severely
affected. In these, life expectancy can be near normal, and
such affected males may have children [9].
Patients with the more severe form of MPS II exhibit a
chronic and progressive disease involving multiple organs
and tissues. They appear normal at birth, although they tend
to be heavy, some have inguinal or umbilical hernias and
there is an increased incidence of Mongolian blue spots
[25]. The age at diagnosis is usually between 18 and
36 months, compared with 9 months for severe MPS I [6].
Death from a combination of neurological deterioration and
cardiorespiratory failure usually occurs in the mid-teenage
years.
Physical appearance
The typical patient with attenuated MPS II is short with
some change of facial features. Significant arthropathy and
connective tissue involvement lead to joint contractures. A
combination of hepatomegaly and lax abdominal muscles
leads to abdominal prominence.

In the more severely affected patients, the typical facial
features become apparent in the first 3 years. They are most
likely caused by a combination of storage in the soft tissues
of the orofacial region and underlying facial bone dysostosis. Thickening of the alae nasi, lips, ear lobules and
tongue becomes progressively more obvious. The patients
often develop a plethoric, rosy-cheeked appearance. Thickening of the calvaria results in macrocephaly. Facial and
body hypertrichosis is often seen and the scalp hair
becomes coarse, straight and thatch-like. Patients also
develop specific, pearly, papular skin eruptions, which are
usually first seen around the scapulae, but then spread to
involve the trunk and upper thighs. These skin eruptions,
first noted in Hunter’s original presentation, are said to be
pathognomic for MPS II [32].
Development
Infants with MPS II appear normal at birth, and early
developmental milestones may also be normal, even in the
presence of significant somatic disease. Developmental
outcomes, however, are highly variable. Significant psychosocial problems occur in affected teenagers and young
adults [40]. Even in patients with attenuated disease, cranial
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are often grossly
abnormal, with extensive white matter changes as well as
dilated perivascular spaces, despite apparently normal
intellectual skills [27].
Patients with more severe MPS II also appear normal at
birth, and early developmental milestones may be normal.
Some patients fail hearing screening tests in the first year,
and speech delay is not unusual in more severely affected
patients. By 18–24 months, developmental delay is usually
apparent. Most patients make very slow progress after this
stage, with a developmental plateau beginning between 3
and 5 years of age. Unlike children with severe MPS I, who
are usually placid, more severely affected children with
MPS II can be hyperactive and aggressive. By the time of
death in their second decade, most patients with CNS
involvement are severely mentally handicapped and dependant on care providers for all their needs.
Biochemical diagnosis
Assessing urinary GAGs (heparan and dermatan sulphates) is
the usual first screening test for MPS II, and can be
quantitative (measurement of total urinary uronic acid) or
qualitative (GAG electrophoresis). Although neither test can
offer a definitive diagnosis, abnormal measurements indicate
the likely presence of an MPS disorder. The sensitivity of
these tests, however, is not perfect, particularly when
measurements are made on samples of dilute urine. Definitive
diagnosis is established by enzyme assay in leukocytes,
fibroblasts or plasma, using substrates specific for I2S.
Another sulphatase should be measured in conjunction, in
order to exclude multiple sulphatase deficiency. This is a
much rarer disorder than MPS II and is generally associated
with a very poor prognosis. It should be noted that the amount
of enzyme activity measured in vitro from cellular extracts

does not indicate where an individual falls within the MPS II
spectrum of disease severity.
Prenatal diagnosis
Prenatal testing is available for foetuses at risk of MPS II. This
is generally carried out by enzyme assay of I2S in uncultured
chorionic villi, allowing early testing and rapid diagnosis of
affected foetuses. Very low activities have been measured in
some pregnancies with a (heterozygous) female foetus,
emphasising the need to combine an enzyme assay with foetal
sex determination [7]. Molecular-genetic prenatal testing can
be performed if the mutation is known in the family.
Carrier testing
Previous methods of carrier detection based on an I2S assay
in either plasma or hair roots are now known to be
unreliable, as there is considerable overlap between the
normal and heterozygous ranges. The only definitive test
for determining carrier status is based on DNA analysis. In
a small number of families, however, the mutation remains
elusive, despite full sequencing of the I2S locus.
Symptomatic treatment
Even with the introduction of ERT, patients with MPS II
still require supportive symptomatic treatment from a wide
range of specialists. A comprehensive initial assessment of
each patient at diagnosis should therefore be undertaken,
and should be followed by regular reviews. Supportive
management and the anticipation of possible complications
can greatly improve the quality of life of affected
individuals and their families. Family members should be
offered genetic counselling, and contact with other affected
families, patients and support groups can be helpful.
Skeletal abnormalities
Orthopaedic complications, caused by a combination of
direct bone involvement and severe arthropathy, can lead to
significant disability. The destructive arthropathy, which
especially affects the hip joints, is a feature of the skeletal
disease in some patients and may be due to secondary
events occurring within chondrocytes and/or osteoblasts as
a result of storage.
Progressive arthropathy may affect all joints and leads to
severe restriction of motion. The hip joints appear to be
particularly vulnerable and severe erosive hip dysplasia can
be especially disabling. Poor hand function, due to the
characteristic claw-hand deformity, carpal tunnel syndrome
and interphalangeal joint stiffness, is also common.
Abnormal joint function is largely a result of both
metaphyseal deformities and thickened joint capsules.
Secondary erosive joint disease is particularly disabling
and is extremely difficult to manage medically and/or
surgically. The deformed acetabulum and pelvis makes
prosthetic surgery a challenge, and many patients become
wheelchair-bound because of hip pain. The role of physical
therapy in MPS II is not well studied, but range-of-motion
exercises appear to offer some benefit in preserving joint
function and should be started at an early age. If significant
restriction of joint movement has already occurred, rangeof-motion exercises may slow further progression.
Cardiovascular system
Cardiac abnormalities detected by echocardiography are
common in patients with MPS II. Valvular involvement,
with thickening and stiffening of the valve leaflets,
commonly leads to mitral and aortic regurgitation and/or
stenosis [24]. Cardiomyopathy is much less common but
may be associated with an increased risk of cardiac
arrhythmia [14]. Valve replacement surgery may be
necessary, and annual cardiac evaluation with echocardiography is essential. Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis should
be used where appropriate. The prevalence and age at onset
of the main cardiovascular signs and symptoms as reported
in HOS are shown in Table 2.
Respiratory disease and upper airway manifestations
Chronic recurrent rhinitis and persistent copious nasal
discharge without obvious infection are common. Enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids, a narrowed trachea,
tracheomalacia, thickened vocal cords, redundant tissue in
the upper airway, and an enlarged tongue can contribute to
upper airway complications [4, 26, 39]. The upper airway
involvement leads to noisy breathing, particularly at night,
and is probably a major component of obstructive sleep
apnoea, which is a common complication in the later stages

of the disease [16]. Because of the airway disease, there is a
high risk associated with anaesthesia in these patients [17].
In patients with attenuated MPS II, rhinorrhoea tends to
improve with age, but upper airway obstruction and sleep
apnoea become more troublesome with increasing age. A
progressive restrictive respiratory defect also becomes
apparent with increasing age, mainly due to progressive
changes in the thoracic skeleton.
Sleep studies should form part of the regular assessment
schedule, and significant episodes of hypoxia should be
managed by continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure
devices. Severely affected patients often find such treatment
difficult to tolerate. In these patients, supplemental oxygen
alone may be an acceptable alternative, but should be used
with caution in patients with documented hypercapnia.
Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are frequently performed to correct Eustachian tube dysfunction and to
decrease airway obstruction. Severely affected patients also
tend to have frequent ear infections and constant rhinorrhoea. Early placement of ventilating tubes is recommended
in severely affected individuals.
Gastrointestinal system
Protuberance of the abdomen and hernias caused by
progressive hepatosplenomegaly are common. Although
organ size can become massive, storage of GAGs in the
liver and spleen does not lead to either liver or splenic
dysfunction. Patients are prone to periodic bouts of watery
diarrhoea, which occur without apparent cause and are not
associated with malabsorption. Rectal biopsies in affected
patients have demonstrated storage within gut neural cells,
and an autonomic cause for episodes of diarrhoea has been
postulated [10]. With age, loss of muscle strength and
physical inactivity lead to constipation.
Abdominal hernias should be repaired surgically, though
recurrence can occur. Diarrhoea can be controlled by diet
and the use of antimotility drugs.
Central nervous system
Communicating high pressure hydrocephalus, which is
common in MPS I, is rare in MPS II. Other CNS
complications, such as seizures, are more common. They
are usually tonic–clonic in nature and respond to standard
anticonvulsant treatment.
Progressive compression of the spinal cord with resulting cervical myelopathy due to thickening of the dura
(hypertrophic pachymeningitis cervicalis) and hyperplasia
of the transverse ligament is common [21]. In addition,
MRI scans of the craniocervical junction will often show
deposition of GAG around the tip of the odontoid process.
Most patients have a well-formed odontoid process and
atlanto-axial subluxation is usually not a feature of MPS II.
Cervical myelopathy may initially present as reduced
activity, exercise intolerance or difficulty in rising from a
sitting position. If it remains untreated, irreversible cord
damage can occur.
Hypertrophic pachymeningitis cervicalis and cervical
compression secondary to hyperplasia of the transverse
ligaments should be quickly and aggressively treated in
patients with attenuated disease. Early and careful cervical
decompression performed by an experienced team may
prevent severe and devastating consequences.
Peripheral nervous system
Carpal tunnel syndrome is common in patients with
attenuated forms of MPS II and should be promptly
investigated and treated. Nerve conduction studies should
be conducted to monitor patients, as the typical symptoms
of compression (pain, tingling or numbness) do not occur
[13]. Surgical decompression of the median nerve at an
early stage of involvement results in either partial or
complete improvement in most patients.
Visual problems
Although corneal opacity has been reported [31], it is not
generally a feature of MPS II and helps to distinguish the
disorder clinically from severe MPS I and MPS VI. In
addition glaucoma is rarely present, even in severely
affected patients. Retinal degeneration resulting in decreased peripheral vision and poor dark adaptation is
common, but often difficult to investigate fully in a severely
affected patient. Disc oedema, uveal effusions and epiretinal membranes have all been reported as part of the variable
ocular pathology [2, 20, 37].
Electroretinography confirms retinal degeneration in many
patients, but a disturbance of vision apart from nyctalopia
(‘night blindness’) is rare. Chronic papilloedema without
evidence of raised intracranial pressure is common and may
be due to deposition of GAGs within the sclera causing
pressure on the optic nerve at the interscleral level [2].
Regular, annual, ophthalmological assessment is required and should include a measure of intraocular
pressure. Spectacles should be prescribed as appropriate.
Hearing
Hearing loss is common in patients with severe MPS II and
is correlated with the severity of somatic disease. Manifestations leading to hearing loss include frequent middle ear
disease secondary to Eustachian tube dysfunction, dysostosis of the ossicles of the middle ear, scarring of the
tympanic membrane, and damage to the eighth nerve.
272 Eur J Pediatr (2008) 167:267–277

Audiological abnormalities usually consist of conductive
deafness early in the course of the disease but as the child
ages a sensorineural element appears and most patients
have combined deafness once the disease is fully established [29]. Moderate to severe hearing loss develops in
most adults with attenuated MPS II. In most patients there
is a mixture of both conductive and sensorineural deafness
[22]. Appropriate regular audiology assessment and provision of the correct auditory aids are required.
Education and behaviour
Given the intellectual involvement in the more severely
affected patients, it is important that infants with MPS II are
provided with a stimulating environment to encourage as
much learning as possible during the early stages, as some
skills may be retained during the later period of general
deterioration. For patients with more attenuated forms of the
disease, deafness and physical limitations may impact on
education. Educational assessments of special needs should
be undertaken to ensure that an appropriate educational
environment is provided. This may be in a mainstream
school with additional help or within a special school system.
Many patients with severe MPS II exhibit hyperactivity
and aggression. Psychological assessment, behaviour management and the use of medication should be considered in
these patients. The hyperactivity generally responds poorly
to methylphenidate, and over-sedation is a risk with other
forms of medication.
Anaesthetic complications
All patients with MPS II present major anaesthetic risks, and
death can result if appropriate precautions are not taken [12].
Patients should only undergo general anaesthesia in centres
staffed with anaesthesiologists experienced in these disorders. The most important complications relate to the
following.
– Dysostosis multiplex leading to rigidity of the neck and
spine. Although instability of the spine is rare, significant cervical compression may be present in patients
with attenuated disease. This can result in sudden
neurological deterioration if excessive neck manipulation is performed during attempts to intubate the patient.
– Induction may be difficult because of an inability to
maintain an adequate airway.
– Intubation may require smaller-than-anticipated endotracheal tubes and a narrow trachea and thickened
vocal cords will impede view. It is recommended that a
paediatric pulmonologist or ear, nose and throat
specialist should be present during intubation. Fibreoptic laryngotracheoscopy is usually essential.
– Extubation can also be hazardous for these patients,
and there is an increased incidence of post-obstructive
pulmonary oedema.
– Recovery from anaesthesia may be slow, and postoperative airway obstruction is always a risk.
Enzyme replacement therapy
Recombinant I2S (idursulfase; Elaprase, Shire Human
Genetic Therapies, Cambridge, MA, USA) has recently
been licensed for treatment of patients with MPS II in the
United States, European Union and Switzerland. Idursulfase is produced in a continuous human cell line and is a
purified form of the natural lysosomal enzyme I2S.
Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the oligosaccharide chains of the glycoprotein enzyme allow specific
binding of idursulfatase to M6P receptors on the cell
surface, leading to cellular internalisation and targeting of
the enzyme to lysosomes, and subsequent catabolism of
accumulated GAGs.
Phase I/II trial
Twelve patients were enrolled in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial of idursulfase for 24 weeks,
followed by an open-label extension study.
Urinary GAGs were reduced within 2 weeks of initiating
idursulfase treatment and remained low for the 48 weeks of
the study (P<0.0001). Both liver and spleen volumes were
decreased at 24 weeks (P<0.01) and 48 weeks (P<0.001).
The distance that patients could walk in 6 min (6-min walk
test) increased by an average of 48 m after 48 weeks (P=
0.013). Six patients developed IgG antibodies that did not
appear to influence the clinical response to idursulfase [18].
Phase II/III trial
A multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of idursulfase, 0.5 mg/kg administered weekly,
compared with placebo. Additionally, the trial evaluated
idursulfase, 0.5 mg/kg every other week, compared with
placebo. Ninety-six patients were randomized to one of
three groups with each patient receiving a total of 52
infusions of either idursulfase, idursulfase alternating
weekly with placebo, or placebo. The primary efficacy
endpoint of the trial was a composite of two clinical
measures – forced vital capacity and the 6-min walk test.
Patients receiving the weekly dosing regimen of idursulfase showed a statistically significant improvement in
the primary efficacy endpoint (P<0.005) compared with
Eur J Pediatr (2008) 167:267–277 273

placebo. Patients receiving the alternate-week dosing
regimen of idursulfase also showed a statistically significant improvement (P<0.05) compared with placebo [19].
Treatment with idursulfase was generally well tolerated.
The most common adverse events observed were associated
with the clinical manifestations of MPS II. Of the adverse
events considered possibly related to idursulfase, infusionrelated reactions were the most common and were generally
mild. There were two patient deaths during the study, both of
which were considered unrelated to treatment with idursulfase. IgG and IgM antibodies were observed in the idursulfase-treated patients at some point during the course of the
study. When antibodies occurred, there was a transient
increase in urinary GAGs, presumably due to a neutralising
effect. This did not correlate with any of the clinical variables
measured (Shire HGT, data on file). No IgE antibodies were
observed and no patient withdrew from the trial due to an
adverse event considered related to idursulfase [19].
Current treatment with idursulfase
Idursulfase is given by weekly intravenous infusion over
3 h at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg diluted in an appropriate volume
of saline (according to weight). Patients may receive
premedication with antipyretics and/or antihistamines at
the discretion of the prescribing physician. Patients who
have experienced infusion-related reactions should be
premedicated for subsequent infusions. Consideration
should be given to the possibility of sodium overload in
small infants, and, if necessary, the total volume of the
infusion can be decreased to 50 ml. Although the treatment
is generally safe and infusion-related reactions are no more
frequent than with other protein-based therapies, anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.
Early response to ERT
The response to ERT appears to depend on the severity of
the individual’s condition and the age at which the
treatment begins. In our experience, the first sign of
efficacy in most young (prepubertal) patients is usually an
enhanced feeling of wellbeing and greater energy, manifesting as an increased ability to take part in normal daily
activities. By 2 months, most patients have urinary GAG
levels approaching the normal range and there is usually
evidence of a reduction in size of the liver and spleen. After
a further month of therapy there is often an improvement in
soft-tissues joint contractures and the beginning of a growth
spurt. By 6 months of treatment, most patients have
improved the distance that they can achieve in the 6-min
walk test and most show stabilisation (if not improvement)
in pulmonary function tests. Most of the improvement
occurs in the first 12–18 months of treatment. After this
period of time, gains are very slow and the condition of
most patients will generally have stabilised, although
physicians still need to be vigilant and look actively for
possible disease-related complications.
ERT for particular patient groups
Treating very young patients
Experience of treating children under the age of 5 years
with idursulfase is limited, as the clinical trials enrolled
patients above this age so that the patients would be able to
comply with and be able to cooperate with repeated
pulmonary function and endurance testing. The following
is therefore based on our personal clinical experience.
Treating patients at a very young age leads to practical
problems with the infusions. These may be resolved with
indwelling vascular access devices. Outcomes are likely to
be better in patients treated from a very young age, but
there are currently no recommendations on how to monitor
the response to treatment, especially in patients either too
young to cooperate with the tests used in the clinical trials
(pulmonary function tests and 6-min walk test) or in
patients who are not yet showing symptoms of the disease.
This situation would be improved by identifying a suitable
biomarker that would reflect the disease burden and that
would respond promptly to therapy.
We believe that these challenges should not prevent the
introduction of treatment in patients under the age of 5 years
after discussion with parents. Careful clinical follow-up,
however, will be necessary in these patients, accompanied by
regular (annual) developmental assessments. As of October
2006, there were 12 patients below 5 years of age in HOS.
Treating patients with severe CNS involvement
Idursulfase is not expected to cross the blood–brain barrier
and therefore would not be expected to lead to any
improvement in CNS dysfunction in patients with severe
MPS II. In most patients there is likely to be some initial
benefit in terms of enhanced respiratory function due to
airway improvement and reduction in size of the liver and
spleen. In addition, joint mobility may improve as a result
of ERT on peri-articular soft tissue. The burden of weekly
intravenous therapy may be significant in some patients
with very severe CNS disease. The authors believe that
patients with severe CNS involvement may be offered the
possibility of treatment for a ‘trial’ period of 12–18 months,
after which time a decision should be made as to whether to
continue. Decisions on whether to start and continue
treatment should be made only after detailed discussion
with the parents.

Home therapy
More than 90% of patients treated with idursulfase have
had no infusion-related reactions and, in those who do, the
reactions are mostly minor and respond promptly to
reducing the rate of infusion and using antipyretics and
antihistamines for future treatments. Under these circumstances, it would appear that idursulfase is a therapy that
could be administered safely in the patient’s home after a
minimum of 12 infusions in hospital.
Depending on the labelling and clinical practices in
particular countries, a logical approach would appear to be
to consider home therapy for those patients with minimal or
no obstructive airway disease (as judged by sleep study and
pulmonary function tests). It should be stressed, however,
that ERT during respiratory infections or other intercurrent
illnesses are contraindicated. Treatment should be postponed under such circumstances, regardless of whether
treatment is given in the hospital or home setting.
Management of infusion reactions
Infusion-related reactions appear to be of two types: those
occurring during the infusion and ‘late’ reactions occurring
12 h or more after the infusion.
The classic reactions occurring during the infusion, with
fever, chills and urticaria, respond to temporarily stopping
the infusion, administering paracetamol (acetominophen)
and antihistamines, and restarting the infusion after at least
30 min but at a slower rate. Before subsequent infusions,
patients should be premedicated with acetominophen and
antihistamines 1 h before the infusion. If the reactions
continue despite this premedication, consideration should
be given to pretreatment with corticosteroids; for example,
prednisolone, 1 mg/kg, 12 h and 1 h before infusion.
Late reactions typically consist of a sunburn-type rash
and mild wheezing. The rash can be managed as above, but
the wheezing requires bronchodilator treatment and, possibly, oxygen supplementation. All patients who have
significant infusion-associated reactions should have specific immune testing. Reducing the rate of infusion is
mandatory in these patients.
To assess the efficacy of ERT in individual patients and to
ensure the appropriate management of possible infusion-related
reactions, it is recommended that the treatment of patients
receiving ERT is overseen by experienced physicians in centres
with expertise in treating lysosomal storage diseases.
Haematopoietic stem cell therapy
The potentially beneficial effect of HSCT on lysosomal
storage diseases is thought to be due to the replacement of
deficient macrophages with marrow-derived donor macrophages (Kupffer cells – pulmonary, splenic, nodal, tonsillar
and peritoneal macrophages – and microglial cells) which
constitute an ongoing source of enzyme capable of gaining
access to various storage sites. HSCT has been successful
in modifying the course of the disease in patients with
severe MPS I and MPS VI. In a single small study of HSCT
in MPS II, however, the results of treatment were not
positive, with nine of ten patients continuing to exhibit
progressive neurodegeneration [36].
The future
Whilst ERT is likely to benefit many patients with MPS II,
the problems associated with severe CNS involvement are
unlikely to be solved by intravenous ERT. Other methods
of treatment, including alternative routes of enzyme
administration, will therefore need to be studied. Direct
administration of enzyme into the cerebrospinal fluid, either
into the ventricle or lumbar space, has not prevented
progressive neurological deterioration in another lysosomal
storage disorder, type II Gaucher disease [28]. This
approach has not been attempted in MPS II, and formal
studies are required, perhaps with the addition of immunosuppression to prevent antibody formation. Currently, there
are no suitable methods for infusion directly into the brain,
and repeated intracerebral injections would not be practical.
It may be that to treat CNS disease more effectively,
peripheral ERT may have to be combined with other
approaches, such as cell-based therapies, perhaps involving
gene enhancement or replacement.
Gene therapy is the logical approach for treating
disorders of the CNS, and animal work on other MPS
disorders is beginning to show promise [5, 30]. Choice of
vector, the use of immunosuppression and the route of
administration are all issues that need addressing before the
first human clinical trials of gene therapy involving MPS
disorders are performed.
Use of nanoparticles containing engineered myoblasts
expressing I2S has been reported. Scaling-up studies, however,
are required to evaluate the feasibility of such devices [11].
Conclusion
MPS II (Hunter syndrome) is a severe progressive multisystemic disorder that has the potential to cause disease in
most body systems and is usually fatal in the second or third
decade of life. Ideally, management should be centralised in
major medical centres with access to all medical specialties.
Eur J Pediatr (2008) 167:267–277 275

Management is multidisciplinary and a holistic approach to
the patient is required, especially for those who have severe
neurological involvement. ERT is an important new therapy
that has the potential to help many patients, providing that it is
started early in the course of the disease. CNS disease remains
a major challenge and an innovative approach to treatment
will be needed if this is to be addressed fully.
