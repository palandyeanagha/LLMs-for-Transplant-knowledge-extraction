Abstract
A 77-year-old man hospitalized for epigastric pain showed jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. Laboratory tests revealed elevated hepatobiliary enzymes and inflammatory markers, and imaging studies demonstrated a 12 cm hepatic cyst compressing the common bile duct. The diagnosis was a giant hepatic cyst causing obstructive jaundice. Cyst drainage and sclerotherapy with 5% monoethanolamine oleate was performed
twice, resulting in almost complete disappearance of the cyst. Obstructive jaundice due to a hepatic cyst, as
seen in this case, is relatively rare and this report includes a review of other similar cases in Japan.

Introduction
Hepatic cysts are usually asymptomatic but may occasionally present as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention (1, 2). However, even in symptomatic hepatic cysts, obstructive jaundice is rarely seen. Sanfelippo et
al (3) reported obstructive jaundice in only two of 82 patients with hepatic cysts. Recent trends in the treatment of
symptomatic hepatic cysts, except in cases of acute rupture,
hemorrhage or where cancer is suspected, include cyst
drainage followed by drug injection (sclerotherapy). Ethanol
and minocycline are often used as sclerosing solutions, and
more recently, monoethanolamine oleate has been used with
good results (4-6). We recently encountered a patient with
obstructive jaundice due to a hepatic cyst who was successfully treated with sclerotherapy using monoethanolamine
oleate. This case is presented here, together with a discussion of the related medical literature.
Case Presentation
A 77-year-old man was referred to our hospital because
of persistent epigastric pain. His past history was unremarkable except for appendectomy at age 18 and pulmonary tuberculosis at age 75. Physical examination on admission
showed the patient to be lucid and afebrile. His blood pressure was 152/84 mmHg and pulse rate 87 bpm. The abdomen was soft and slightly distended, with mild tenderness in
the upper abdomen. There was no rebound, guarding, hepatosplenomegaly, palpable masses, or lower extremity edema.
Laboratory findings on admission revealed elevated hepatobiliary enzymes and inflammatory markers (Table 1), urinalysis was positive for bilirubin, and abdominal ultrasound
showed a large cystic lesion in the right hepatic lobe
(Fig. 1). The lesion contained no septum or calcifications,
and the intrahepatic bile ducts in both hepatic lobes were dilated. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed the presence of a large cystic lesion 12 cm in diameter (Fig. 2a),

which showed no enhancement with contrast medium
(Fig. 2b). Both T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
images of the lesion showed homogeneously high signal intensity as compared with normal liver parenchyma
(Fig. 3a and b ). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography indicated the presence of a large spherical
lesion near the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts
that was compressing the intrahepatic bile ducts and keeping
them separate from the common bile duct (Fig. 3c). Endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography revealed downward compression of the common bile duct, gall bladder,
and cystic duct (Fig. 4). The intrahepatic bile ducts could
not be visualized on endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography. No flow of contrast medium was detected in the
cystic lesion, and neither gall stones, tumors, nor abnormalities of the pancreatobiliary duct could be identified. On the
basis of these findings, a diagnosis was made of obstructive
jaundice due to a giant hepatic cyst.
On day 15 after admission, about 600 mL of fluid was
drained from the cyst by means of transcutaneous transhepatic drainage. Repeat abdominal ultrasound showed almost
complete disappearance of the cyst (Fig. 5). Sixty milliliters
of 5% monoethanolamine oleate was then injected, the patient was placed in different positions for 30 minutes, after
which the monoethanolamine oleate was aspirated. On the
following day the drainage tube was removed. The fluid
drained from the cyst was reddish-brown and serous, with
cell counts of less than 100 (cells could not be classified), a
specific gravity of 1.019, negative Rivalta test result, and cytologically identified as class I. Bacteriologic cultures of the
cyst contents were negative, but cyst fluid tumor markers
were markedly elevated: CEA, 94.7 ng/mL; CA19-9, 
5,000 U/mL; CA125, 1,159 U/mL. Despite the initial almost
complete disappearance of the cyst, regrowth was noted 28
days after the first drainage (Fig. 6), and a second drainage
was thus performed. Drainage of about 300 mL of fluid followed by injection of 60 mL of monoethanolamine oleate
resulted in disappearance of the hepatic cyst and resolution
of the abdominal pain. On days 33 and 41 after admission,
serum transaminase and total bilirubin, respectively, were
within normal limits. On day 41 after admission, the patient
was discharged from hospital. He has since shown an uneventful course with no recurrence of the hepatic cyst.
Discussion
The prevalence of hepatic cysts is 0.1 to 0.5% (3) based
on autopsy studies and 2.5% based on ultrasound examinations (7). Hepatic cysts have been classified by Henson et al
(8) into four types: congenital, neoplastic, inflammatory, and
traumatic. Congenital hepatic cysts are further categorized
into solitary and polycystic cysts. The findings of the present patient are consistent with a solitary unilocular cyst.
For diagnosing a hepatic cyst, it is important to rule out
hepatic cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Imaging study
findings that suggest a cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma
include the presence of solid elements with enhancement on
contrast computed tomography (9). In the present patient,
none of the imaging studies showed solid elements, and no
enhancement was seen on contrast computed tomography.
The diagnosis in this case was therefore a simple hepatic
cyst. Laboratory findings on admission showed elevated hepatobiliary enzymes and inflammatory markers. In addition,
serum transaminase was elevated, but normalized after cyst
drainage. Since other causes of an elevated serum transaminase level were absent, this elevation was considered to
be caused by obstructive jaundice.
Typical magnetic resonance imaging findings of a hepatic
cyst include the same signal intensity as water (10), that is,
homogeneous low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging
and homogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging. However, our patient had homogeneous high signal
intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images, which suggests intracystic hemorrhage or a high protein concentration.
This, combined with the reddish-brown color of the drained
cyst fluid, indicates that the patient may have been suffering
intracystic bleeding, which caused cyst enlargement prior to
the development of symptoms, even though findings of abdominal ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography
were not typical for intracystic hemorrhage.
Markedly elevated tumor marker levels have been reported even in histologically diagnosed simple cysts (11,
12). Iwase et al (13) reported CA19-9 levels in hepatic cyst
fluid at least 100 times higher than in normal serum concentrations. The present patient also had markedly elevated cyst
fluid tumor marker levels, and imaging studies indicated a
simple cyst.
Solitary nonparasitic cysts of the liver causing obstructive
jaundice were first reported in 1950 by Caravati et al (14).
In connection with the findings for our patient, we reviewed
reports of similar cases in the Japanese and English medical
literature. We found a total of 51 patients with the following
characteristics: mean age, 65.8±15.2 years (range, 29 to 90
years); male to female ratio, 7:6; cyst size, 12.5±5.1 cm
(range, 2 to 30 cm); and total bilirubin, 10.2±7.7 mg/dL
(range, 1.5 to 31.5 mg/dL). Twenty-nine patients were
treated surgically and 22 were treated non-surgically. Of the

patients for whom detailed medical records of surgery were
available, 11 underwent cystectomy, 9 cyst fenestration, and
5 hepatic resection. Of those who were treated nonsurgically, 6 received only drainage and 16 received drainage followed by drug injection (sclerotherapy), using absolute ethanol and minocycline for 7 patients each, and
monoethanolamine oleate for 2 patients.
The prognosis of solitary nonparasitic cysts of the liver
with obstructive jaundice is relatively good. Irrespective of
whether treatment is surgical or non-surgical, the patient
should have a good clinical course. In the present case, we
selected non-surgical treatment for the initial management in
consideration of the patient’s quality of life.
Selection of the appropriate sclerotherapy type after cyst
drainage is also important. Ethanol can cause abdominal
pain (15), and in some cases overdosage may lead to alcoholic intoxication (16), while adverse reactions including
eosinophilia have been reported for minocycline (17). Great
care must thus be taken when using these drugs. Monoethanolamine oleate is commonly used for sclerotherapy of
esophageal varices. Iwasaki et al (6) have treated at least 20
patients with symptomatic hepatic cysts using monoethanolamine oleate as “cyst sclerotherapy” and reported resolution
or reduced size of the cyst in all cases without any adverse
reactions or recurrence. As the cyst showed regrowth following initial treatment with monoethanolamine oleate, a second
drainage was needed. This regrowth was thought to be
caused by insufficiency of monoethanolamine oleate injection. However, thereafter, treatment with monoethanolamine
oleate was effective for our patient. As monoethanolamine
oleate sclerotherapy for hepatic cysts has been reported in
only relatively few cases, further studies with a larger number of patients are necessary.
In the present case, the dose of injected monoethanola623

mine oleate was about 0.9 ml/kg (60 ml/67 kg; body
weight). Kobashi et al (18) injected monoethanolamine
oleate into rat liver via the portal vein to evaluate liver damage by serum transaminase and histological examination. At
a dose of 0.8 ml/kg, transaminase markedly increased and
the liver demonstrated extensive necrosis histologically.
Seven days postinjection, transaminase levels fell within
normal limits and the necrotic area had almost disappeared.
Koide (19) injected monoethanolamine oleate into dog liver
via the portal vein and evaluated the damage to the liver,
lung and kidney by blood chemistry and histological examination. Repeated administration of monoethanolamine oleate
of a total amount of 6 ml/kg injected on 12, 6 or 3 occasions over a 3-week period produced liver damage. In contrast, there was little damage to the lung or kidney. In the
present case, if most of the injected monoethanolamine
oleate volume (0.9 ml/kg) had been absorbed into blood

vessels, liver damage would likely have continued for several days. As there was no serious liver damage in the present patient, most of the monoethanolamine oleate must
have been aspirated. Watanabe et al (20) reported that retrograde infusion of monoethanolamine oleate into the common
bile duct of the guinea pig resulted in extensive hepatic necrosis and hyperammonemia. In the present case, no contrast
medium was detected in the cystic lesion on endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography, indicating that there was
no communication between the cyst and the common bile
duct. This negative finding is very important, because
monoethanolamine oleate injection into the liver cyst would
present serious risk if it did in fact communicate with the
bile duct.
Our patient was diagnosed with a simple cyst based on
the basis of imaging and cytology findings. Since neoplastic
changes of hepatic cysts have occasionally been reported
(21, 22), careful follow-up will be necessary.
