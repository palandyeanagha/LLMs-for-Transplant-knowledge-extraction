Brain death is the state of irreversible loss of brain function due to organic brain lesions. Although there are minor
variations among the criteria that are used to define brain
death, the essential criteria for establishing brain death include
complete unresponsiveness, permanent apnea, and an absence
of brainstem reflexes (1). A variety of reflex movements have
been reported in patients with brain death, such as plantar
responses, muscle stretch reflexes, abdominal reflexes, and
finger jerks (2). Because the aforementioned reflexes are spinal
reflexes, the existence of such reflex movements does not
preclude the diagnosis of brain death. While the occurrence
of reflex movements in brain-dead patients is not uncommon
in the literature, there have been no reports of reflex movements in brain-dead patients in Korea. The purpose of the
present study was to evaluate the frequency and type of reflex
movements in Korean patients admitted in our hospital who
fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for brain death.
Among the patients admitted to the Organ Transplantation Center at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea,
for determination of brain death and donation of organs,
those who met the criteria for brain death were enrolled for
the present study between March 2003 and February 2005.
Brain death was determined according to the guideline of
Korean Medical Association (3) in conjuction with the recommendations of the American Academy of Neurology (4)
which were (i) complete clinical neurological examination
including documentation of coma, the absence of brainstem
reflexes, and apnea, (ii) persistence of above clinical features
for at least 6 hr (to determine irreversibility), (iii) exclusion
of hypothermia, drug intoxication, and other metabolic causes
of coma, and (iv) demonstration of electrocerebral inactivity
by electroencephalogram performed after the second examination. The protocol (5-7) used to evoke movements consisted of (i) painful stimuli applied to the supraorbital area,
sternum, and nail beds of the four limbs, (ii) neck flexion,
(iii) tactile stimulation of the palmar and plantar areas, and
(iv) apnea test. Any movement that occurred reproducibly
was observed and recorded on the video-tape for independent
examination by two neurologists.
Twenty-nine patients fulfilling the criteria of brain death
were recruited during the two-year-long study period. Because
the diagnosis of brain death in children is a complex clinical
and ethical issue (8), three pediatric patients younger than
15 yr of age were excluded; thus the remaining 26 adult
patients were examined as described above. The most common cause of brain death was either spontaneous or traumatic
intracranial hemorrhage (Table 1). Fifteen patients were male
(mean age, 39±10 yr; range, 18-61 yr). Twenty-five of the
26 patients ultimately underwent organ harvesting. Five
(19.2%) of the 26 patients exhibited reflex movements. Four
patients had traumatic subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage and one patient had a massive spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage of the left hemisphere.
A wide range of reflex movements was observed in each
patient (Table 2). Ipsilateral or contralateral pronation-extension reflex movement was observed in three patients. An

Reflex Movements in Patients with Brain Death: A Prospective Study
in A Tertiary Medical Center
Reflex movements have been reported to occur in up to 75% of brain-dead patients,
but this issue has not been addressed in Korea. The patients admitted to our hospital who met the criteria for brain death were enrolled between March 2003 and
February 2005. The frequency and type of reflex movements in these patients
were evaluated prospectively using a standardized protocol. Brain death was determined according to the guideline of Korean Medical Association. Of 26 patients
who were included, five (19.2%) exhibited reflex movements such as the pronation-extension reflex, abdominal reflex, flexion reflex, the Lazarus sign, and periodic leg movements. This finding suggests that the frequency of spinal reflex movements is not rare and the awareness of these movements may prevent delays in
brain-dead diagnosis and misinterpretations.

Reflex Movements in Patients with Brain Death 589
abdominal reflex movement was observed in two patients.
One patient with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage exhibited the Lazarus sign (9), raising both arms briefly before
dropping them onto the chest at painful stimulation. The
triple flexion reflex movement of the leg was observed in
two patients. One patient with massive intracranial hemorrhage exhibited spontaneous repetitive leg movements resembling the periodic limb movements occurring during sleep;
this patient also exhibited the triple flexion reflex of the leg.
This patient has been described in detail elsewhere (10). Reflex
movements were evoked in all five patients in response to
either painful or tactile stimuli. However, similar movements
also occurred spontaneously in three patients in the absence
of any apparent stimulation. Anterior neck flexion evoked
pronation-extension reflexes in two patients. One patient
exhibited the triple flexion reflex movement of the leg during the apnea test.
About 20% of the brain-dead patients that we examined
in the present prospective study exhibited reflex movements;
this is comparable to the incidence of reflex movements in
brain-dead patients in other prospective studies (2, 6, 7).
However, one retrospective study revealed reflex movements
in 75% of brain-dead patients (11). Documentation of brain
death appears to vary among medical centers (12), and the
identification of a movement as a spinal reflex in brain-dead
patients depends on the awareness of individual physicians
as well as hospital policies (13). A prospective study of a large
patient population using a standardized protocol (including
definitions of reflex movements) is required to obtain an accurate description of reflex movements in brain-dead patients.
Most of patients in the present study were enrolled after
admission to an organ transplantation center, to which only
patients who are candidates for organ donation are referred
by other hospitals. Consequently, there may have been selection bias in the present study. Moreover, only 29 patients
were diagnosed as brain dead over the course of two years;
this small number of patients might reflect Koreans’ views
on organ transplantation, because only patients for whom
family members provided consent for organ donation were
transferred to the organ transplantation center. A survey of
attitudes towards brain death and organ donation in Korea
revealed that only half of the respondents had positive views
about brain death (14).
We observed various types of reflex movement in the present study. The most common type of movement was unilateral upper limb pronation-extension reflexes, which were
present in three of five patients. Although the most common
reflex movements reported by a large multicenter study of
brain-dead patients were undulating toe flexion response (7),
we did not observe such movements in our patients. Different patient population and small number of patients in present study might account for the discrepancy from others.
There are many explanations for the reflex movements
exhibited by brain-dead patients, but the mechanisms that
underlie such movements remain obscure (2). One mechanism that has been proposed as underlying such reflex movements is medullary hypoxia and hypercapnea-induced activity of cervical cord neurons. The reflex movements evoked
during the apnea test in one patient in the present study
support this hypothesis. Others have suggested that disinhibition of movement generators of the spinal cord increase
the activity of the movement generators, which provokes
movement. This mechanism could explain the flexion of the
lower extremities and the periodic leg movements that were
observed in our patients. Alternatively, it has been hypothesized that mechanical compression/decompression of the spinal
root or cervical spinal cord by neck flexion/extension can generate movement. Indeed, two of our patients exhibited reflex
movements in response to neck flexion. The results of the
present study suggest that there may be multiple mechanisms
underlying the generation of reflex movements in brain-dead
patients.
Demand for organ transplantation is increasing rapidly.
Therefore, brain-dead patients are becoming an increasingly
important source of organs for transplantation. If physicians
are not aware of reflex movements that can occur in braindead patients, or if there is disagreement among physicians
about the causes of such movements, determination of brain

death might be delayed and could result in the failure of
organ donation. Nevertheless, determination of brain death
should be undertaken with circumspection, particularly when
related to organ transplantation (15). The use of specialized
medical personnel and multidisciplinary team-based approaches will ensure the highest possible accuracy with respect to
determining brain death. In addition, medical training that
specifically addresses brain death is required (12). The frequency of spinal reflex movements is not rare and the awareness of these movements may prevent delays in brain-dead
diagnosis and misinterpretations.
