from source has a median terminal fall velocity of 3 m s-1
, for 
which the fall time from a height of 10-50 km in normal 
atmosphere is 35-70 minutes. This suggests that the outward 
radial velocity of the expanding cloud averaged 180-90 km h- 1

than is normal in volcanic explosions, and was comparable with 
the most powerful one currently known. In normal explosions,

the expansion is due to magmatic gases which constitute a few 
wt% of the magma. In the Rotoehu case it is possible that steam 
constituted a few tens of wt% of magma involved. 
This ash is an example of a new class of pyroclastic deposit for 
which the name 'littoral co-ignimbrite ash-fall' is proposed.

The complete nucleotide sequence of hepatitis B virus 
genome (subtype ayw) cloned in Escherichia coli has been 
determined using the Maxam and Gilbert method and the 
dideoxynucleotide method. This sequence is 3,182 nucleo -
tides long. Location of the nonsense codons shows that the 
coding capacity of the L chain is larger than the coding 
capacity of the Schain. Eight open regions, able to code for 
polypeptide chains larger than 100 amino acids, have been 
located. Region 6, which ?s the largest, covers more than 
80% of the genome. The gene S which codes for polypeptide 
I of the Hbs Ag and was previously located between 
coordinates 95.1 and 73.6 is contained in region 7. 
HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) infects man at a very high rate, In 
western Europe and USA, about 10% of the population carry an 
HBV serological marker such as the surface antigen (HBs Ag) or 
the corresponding antibody (HBs Ac) 1
• In some areas of tropical 
Africa and southeastern Asia, this percentage can be as high as 
60% or 70% (ref. 2). Recovery is spontaneous in most cases, but 
the virus can cause very severe complications like fulminant 
hepatitis, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in addition to which a 
hepatocarcinoma can develop3

are at least 120 million chronic carriers of HBs Ag, the so-called 
healthy carriers, throughout the world2
• 
In addition to HBs Ag, two other antigens have been 
identified: HBc Ag which corresponds to the core of the virus, 
and HBe Ag whose location within the virion has been recently 
demonstrated4
• It was also shown that the viral genome is made 
up of a circular DNA molecule which is partially single-stranded 
and about 3,200 bases long5
•
6
• The virion also harbours a DNA 
polymerase able to repair the viral DN A7
• The novel structure of 
this virus makes its classification somewhat difficult. 
The biological study of the virus is complicated by the fact that 
HBV cannot be propagated in cell cultures and the only available viral source remains human serum. However, cloning of the 
HBV genome in Escherichia coli has allowed the purification of 
large amounts of genetically homogeneous HBV DNA, and the 
establishment of several restriction maps8
-
10• Hence we have 
recently11 localised and determined the primary structure of the 
S gene which codes for polypeptide I and its glucosylated 
derivative polypeptide II, which are the major components of 
the HBsAg. 
In this article, we report the complete primary structure of the 
viral genome (subtype ayw) previously cloned in E. coli.

Fla, 1 Viral DNA (serotype ayw), repaired with the endogenous 
DNA polymerase and the four nucleotide triphosphates, was 
digested with EcoRI endonuclease and cloned in E. coli using A gt 
WES bacteriophage as the cloning vehicle 1
6 • The cloned DNA was 
referred to as Eco HBV DNA. To avoid genetic drift, all stocks 
used to analyse the DNA sequence were made on plates from the 
same lysate obtained after the first cloning step. Recombinant 
phages were purified by two successive CsCl gradients and the 
DNA was phenol extracted11 • After hydrolysis with EcoRI 
endonuclease, Eco HBV DNA was separated from the two A arms 
by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation17 . To prepare each set of 
restriction DNA fragments, 25 to 30 µg of Eco HBV DNA were 
fully hydrolysed with one of the restriction enzymes described in 
Fig. 2, using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer 
(Biolabs). Restriction fragments were dephosphorylated by 
incubation at 65 °C for 45 min with 4 µl of bacterial phosphatase. 
This enzyme was then inactivated by alkaline treatment18 and 
DNA fragments were 5' labelled with [ ·/2
P]ATP (NEN; specific 
activity 2,500 Ci mmol- 1
) and polynucleotide kinase (P. L. Biochemicals) as described by Maxam and Gilbert12• Labelled fragments were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and eluted from the 
gels as previously described. The two labelled ends of each restriction fragment were then separated either by hydrolysis of the DNA 
fragment with another restriction endonuclease and gel electrophoresis or by heat denaturation in the presence of 30% 
dimethyl sulphoxide and gel electrophoresis 13 . DNA fragments 
labelled at one 5' end were eluted from the preparative gel and 
dissolved in water. Chemical reaction, specific for G, A+ G, C + T, 
T and A+ C giving a stronr,er band for A than C were performed as 
described previously12'
13' • Sequence reaction products dissolved 
in loading solution were heat denatured and fractionated on 25, 16 
and 8% acrylamide gel. Figure la is an example of fractionation on 
an 8% acrylamide slab gel of the sequence reaction products 
obtained with Hinf C" DNA fragment (nucleotides 658 to 552). 
When the two labelled ends were separated by hydrolysis with a 
restriction enzyme, nucleotide sequences were also determined 
with the dideoxynucleotide method14 adapted by Maat and 
Smith15 for double-stranded DNA fragments. Figure lb is an 
example of fractionation on a 16% acrylamide gel of such reaction 
products obtained with Bg/A' fragment (nucleotide sequence from 
residue 1,264 to residue 1,338). The two G lanes correspond to two 
different reaction conditions. In GI there is no dGTP while in G2 
the final concentration of dGTP is 2 µM. In both reactions, there is 
1 mM ddGTP, final concentration. Subscript prime indicates the 
position of the 32P on the L strand, subscript second, its position on 
the S strand. 
double-stranded DNA by Maat and Smith15 were used. Two 
examples of sequencing gel autoradiograms are shown in Fig. 1. 
To analyse independently both DNA strands and to overlap all 
the restriction sites used as starting points, a large number of 
fragments were analysed (Fig. 2). The localisation of the 5' end 
of the largest DNA strand on the BamHI viral restriction map 
and the knowledge of this restriction map on the Eco HBV 
DNA allowed the identification of the cloned DNA strands with 
respect to the viral DNA strands. Here we call the DNA strand 
of Eco HBV DNA homologous to the longest viral DNA strand 
the L strand, and the other, the S strand. The sequence shown in 
Fig. 3 corresponds to the Eco HBV DNA, which is 3,182 
nucleotides long. 
Location of the open reading frames 
on the viral genome 
A computer program was used to search for nonsense codons on 
both DNA strands 1
9
• It appears from Fig. 4 that the number and 
distribution of nonsense codons are very different on S and L 
strands. Considering the total genome length, a random distribution of nucleotides should give about 50 nonsense codons 
in each reading frame. Instead one observes 33, 29 and 15 
nonsense codons in the S strand for each phase and 61, 60 and 41 
nonsense codons on the L strand. In addition, their distribution 
along the DNA molecule is very different on the two strands. On 
the L strand, the open reading frames are relatively short (Fig. 
4). Four regions are able to code for 100 amino acids or more. 
These four regions labelled 1 to 4 are 510, 327, 447 and 345

nucleotides long. On the S strand (,Fig. 4 ), the open regions are 
much longer. These regions labelled 5 to 8 are 498, 2,553, 1,296 
and 657 nucleotides long. The length of the above hypothetical 
coding regions which include the EcoRI restriction site (such as 
regions 4, 6 and 7) is only valid if no DNA has been lost in the 
vicinity of this restriction site on cloning, which is most likely. In 
spite of this limitation, the distribution of stop codons clearly 
shows that the coding capacity of the L strand is larger than that 
of the S strand. 
Regions 1, 2, 3 and 4 appear to be located on the genome as 
two pairs (Fig. 5)-region 3 is located immediately downstream 
of region 1 and region 2 immediately beyond region 4. Regions 
5, 6, 7 and 8 extend over the whole genome and overlap with 
each other in different reading frames (Fig. 5). Region 6 covers 
about 80% of the genome and includes the whole of region 7 and 
part of regions 5 and 8. Regions 6 and 7 correspond partly to the 
single-stranded region of the genome. Regions 4 and 5 cover the 
5' extremity of the S strand and the nick of the L strand.

Tentative translation of open regions 
Few proteins have been shown to be coded by the viral 
genome9
'
11 , but one can suppose that, because of its very small 
size, regions with open reading frames are largely used for 
translation. Therefore, a search for the ATG codons which 
could initiate translation has been made near the beginning of 
these regions, although the existence of mRNA splicing20•
21 
could complicate the translation of the open regions. The positions of these ATGs are shown by small arrows in Fig. 5. In 
region 1 to 4, the numbers of codons located downstream from 
these ATG codons are 79, 60, 145 and 28 respectively. Regions 
2 and 4 have particularly low coding capacities. However, these 
coding capacities could be modified by mRNA splicing. For 
example, the translation from the first ATG located in region 4, 
of mRNA transcribed from regions 4 and 2 and spliced could 
allow the synthesis of a polypeptide with a molecular weight 
(MW) up to 18,000. For simplicity and clarity, only regions with 
an open reading frame able to code for 100 amino acids or more 
are taken into account. But a more complicated splicing pattern 
of mRNA could link, in one open reading frame, areas with 
small coding capacity scattered all along the genome. If region 3 
which spans in the single-stranded part of the genome is actually 
translated into protein, this can happen only after DNA 
synthesis of the missing strand. 
In regions 5, 6, 7 and 8, the situation appears to be very 
different. The number of codons located downstream of the first 
ATG are respectively 154, 832, 389 and 212. Region 6 (2,553 
nucleotides long) contains 9 ATG codons. The first and second 
are located at 57 and 1,296 nucleotides respectively from the 
beginning of this region. The seven other A TGs are regularly 
distributed in the second half of this region. In the case where 
translation is initiated at the first ATG, a protein of MW 90,000 
might be synthesised. DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases have a MW of that order22•
33, so it is tempting to 
suggest that the DNA polymerase found within the virion could 
be coded by this region. 
By correlating the amino acid sequences of both ends of the 
HBs Ag polypeptide 1
24 and the nucleotide sequence of the Eco 
HBV DNA, we are able to localise the gene coding for this 
polypeptide in region 7. This gene, called S gene, was previously 
located between positions, 95.1 and 73.6 on the genome map 11 • 
The ATG (position 3,030) corresponding to the N-terminal 
extremity of the polypeptide I is the third of region 7. It is 
located 618 nucleotides from the beginning of this region, 
whereas the two other ATGs (positions 337 and 13) are at 129 
and 453 nucleotides from the beginning. The fact that the ATG 
3030 is preceded by two other ATGs in the same open reading 
frame deserves some additional comment. Three explanations 
can be given: (1) Region 7 is completely translated and gives rise 
to a long polypeptide different from polypeptide I but whose 
C-terminal amino acid sequence is identical to polypeptide I. A 
similar situation occurs with protein VP2 and VP3 of SV4025•
26 
and the 33,000 and 100,000 MW proteins of adenovirus 227 • (2) 
Region 7 is completely translated into a precursor protein of 
polypeptide I. (3) The region upstream of the third ATG is not 
translated. At the present time, one cannot choose between the

three hypotheses. Nevertheless, the first hypothesis could 
partially explain the presence of large polypeptides found in 
small amount in the HBs Ag preparations24• 
Translation of the terminal nucleotide sequence of region 8 
would give rise to a polypeptide having at its C-terminal end a 
repeated sequence of 9 amino acids: Ser-Pro-Arg-Arg-ArgArg-Ser-Glu-Ser. The last amino acid of the first sequence, Ser, 
would be the first one of the second sequence. In the corresponding DNA sequence, however, the only repetition is 
TCTCAA (Ser-Glu). Beyond the ATG codon, region 8 contains 
24 arginine codons-11 % of the total codons. In the last 35 
codons there are 16. arginine codons. This large proportion of 
basic amino acids is similar to that observed in histone, which 
suggests that the translational product of region 8 could be a 
polypeptide with a high affinity for HBV DNA. Therefore, if this 
region is translated, one could envisage that the HBc Ag could 
be coded by this DNA sequence. 
Search for signal sequences 
From a comparative analysis of the primary structure of viral or 
cellular mRNAs and of chromosomal DNA fragments, some 
remarkable DNA sequences were found. In several circumstances, a sequence identical or similar to 5'TATAAA was 
observed in front of the transcribed region (ref. 28 and D. 
Hogness and M. Goldberg, personal communication), while the 
sequence AAUAAA has been found at the 3' end of mRNA, 
near the poly(A)tail29-
31 • On the other hand, it has been shown 
that during the initiation of translation the 3'OH end of 16S 
ribosomal RNA hybridises to the 5' end of prokaryotic mRNA 
through the CCUCC sequence32• The occurrence of a similar 
phenomenon has not been demonstrated in eukaryotic cells. 
Nevertheless, sequences able to hybridise to the 
3'GCGGAAGGA sequence of the 18S ribosomal RNA have 
been observed in some eukaryotic mRNAs28•
33-35• Therefore, 
we looked for these sequences in the Eco HBV DNA. The 
5'T AT AAA sequence was found only at position 1,269 on the S 
strand at 335 nucleotides before region 6. It could therefore 
correspond to a signal relating to the initiation of transcription of 
this very large open region. In that case, since this sequence is 
followed by three ATGs (1,089, 1,022, 998) all in a closed 
reading frame, a splicing of the corresponding mRNA should

Fig. 4 Diagram showing the localisation of the nonsense codons 
on chains L and S of the EcoHBV DNA. Three reading frames, 
called <Ill, <ll2 and <ll3, were defined from the 5' end of each DNA 
strand. On the L chain, <Ill is defined by its first triplet AAT, <ll2 by 
ATT and <ll3 by TIC. On the S chain, <Ill is defined by its first 
triplet CCA, <ll2 by CAC and <1>3 by ACA. The viral DNA is 
circular and its length in nucleotides (3,182) is not a multiple of 3. 
Therefore, going through the EcoRI site phase <Ill is change to 
phase <1>2, phase <ll2 to phase <1>3 and phase <1>3 to phase <1>1. 
Vertical bars represent stop codons. Numbers 1 to 8 define the 
areas with an open reading frame arbitrarily chosen with a length 
above 100 codons. Region 1 goes from nucleotide 1,351 to 1,860, 
region 2 from nucleotide 119 to 445, region 3 from 1,904 to 2,350, 
region 4 from 2,855 to 17, region 5 from 1,847 to 1,350, region 6 
from 935 to 1 and from 3182 to 1565, region 7 from 466 to 1 and 
from 3,182 to 2353, region 8 from 1,392 to 736.

• The EcoRI site is the origin of the physical map. Block 
arrows define the open reading frames on the two viral DNA 
strands. The small arrows indicate the ATG codon located closest 
to the beginning of the open region. The S gene is located between 
positions 95.1 and 73.6 and is included in region 7. 
take place to link its 5' end to a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the open reading frame of region 6. Sequences 
which differ by only one nucleotide were found 36 times on the S 
strand and 45 times on the L strand. The 5' AA TAAA sequence 
occurs once on the L strand at position 689, 243 nucleotides 
after the stop codon of region 2. This sequence is not found in 
chain S even at the end of gene S which is known to code for 
polypeptide I. Two sequences, 5'GCCTICCT and 
CGCCTTCC, able to hybridise with the 3' end of 16S RNA 
ribosomal, were found at positions 61 and 417 on the L strand. 
Sequences able to hybridise with 6 or 7 nucleotides of the 3'0H 
end of this RNA were found once on the L chain and 8 times on 
the S chain. Among. these, the CCTTCC sequence located at 
position 3,176 on the S strand follows a short palindromic 
sequence 5'GTGGAA ITCCAC 3' starting at position 8. This

feature could be related to the expression of the S gene located 
downstream.

Design, synthesis and characterisation of a 
34-residue polypeptide 
that interacts with nucleic acids

Based on secondary structure prediction rules and model 
building a neutral artificial 34-residue polypeptide with 
potential nucleic acid-binding activity was synthesised. 
This peptide and its covalent dimer showed strong interaction with cytidine phosphates and single-stranded DNA. 
The dimer had considerable ribonuclease activity with high 
preference for cleavage at the 3 ' -end of C. 
0028-0836/79/ 430650--06501 .00 
BASED on the known X-ray structures of proteins, rules were 
proposed by various authors (see ref. 1 for review) to describe 
the relationship between primary and secondary structure of a 
protein molecule. These rules may be applied to predict the 
secondary structure of proteins of which only the amino acid 
sequence is known. An example of this is the suggested succession of the secondary structural elements (a-helix, (3~strand, 
reverse turn) in Escherichia coli lac repressor2
•

• Proof or disproof of the proposed secondary structure will come from X-ray 
diffraction studies on crystalline lac repressor.
