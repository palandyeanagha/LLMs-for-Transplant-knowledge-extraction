Abstract
An aging population has prompted us to evaluate the indications of liver transplantation (LT) in elderly patients more 
frequently. In this review, we summarize the short- and long-term results after LT in elderly patients and also discuss the 
criteria used to select patients and how recipient age can challenge current allocation systems. Briefy, the feasibility and 
early outcomes of LT in elderly patients compare favorably with those of younger patients. Although long-term survival is 
less than satisfactory, large-scale studies show that the transplant survival beneft is similar for elderly and younger patients. 
Therefore, age alone does not contraindicate LT; however, screening for cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and asymptomatic 
malignancies, evaluating nutritional status, and frailty, is crucial to ensure optimal results and avoid futile transplantation.

Introduction
Since the first successful liver transplantation (LT) in 
humans in 1967 [1], this procedure has shifted from a “last 
chance” treatment to a well-standardized procedure, now 
accepted as the only curative option for patients with endstage liver disease. The medical and surgical complexity of 
LT, combined with the current organ shortage, has led physicians to propose several selection criteria, among which 
the age of the recipient has always been considered important. In fact, during the 1980s, the recipient age could not 
exceed 45–50 years [2], whereas now, arbitrary age limits 
have been abandoned. Transplant teams have become faced 
with increasing demand among elderly patients, in line with 
an aging population and also higher incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with age [3]. Consequently, several questions 
related to elderly recipients are emerging. Numerous studies from western and eastern countries have explored the 
impact of recipient age on post-transplant survival. However, 
their results are contradictory and the selection policies with 
regard to the age of the recipient are subject to variations 
from one center to another. This review discusses the main 
questions related to LT, excluding living donor LT, in elderly 
patients, based on the available literature.
Feasibility of LT in the elderly patients
In 1991, Starzl et. al reported a series of 156 patients older 
than 60 (the oldest being 76) who underwent LT [4]. The 
3-year survival rate was 65% and the authors concluded that 
“Advanced Age per se is Not a Contraindication to Liver 
Transplantation” provided that respiratory and cardiovascular function is adequate. Since the defnition of elderly recipients is unclear, the cutof age in series moved progressively 
to 65 years and, more recently, to 70 years [5–10]. Data from 
the United Network for Organ Sharing and the European 
Liver Transplant Registry show an increase in the proportion of elderly LT recipients over 65 years and over 70 years 
in the past decade. For example, in the United States, the 
proportion of registrants aged≥65 years rose from 8% in 
2002 to 17% in 2014 [11]. The same trend was observed in 
recipients aged≥70 years (1.4–3.1%). In 2010, a publication 
based on UNOS data revealed that four patients≥80 years 
old were transplanted [12]. These results support the feasibility of LT in elderly patients is now widely agreed. Table 1
summarizes the fndings of several series showing the feasibility of LT in septuagenarians.

Safety of LT in elderly patients
Studies investigating the factors impacting early survival 
after LT have identifed two categories of predictors: those 
related to recipient conditions such as sarcopenia, MELD 
score, and organ failure at the time of transplant [13–15] 
and those related to post-transplant function recovery of 
the graft [16–18]. The practical consequence of these fndings is that optimal grafts should be given to the sickest 
recipient. Notably, the age of the recipient did not clearly 
predict early survival. Moreover, studies that compared

the early outcomes of young vs. elderly recipients did not 
report higher rates of mortality, or vascular or biliary morbidity [7, 19–23]. One of three available studies [20, 22, 
23] reported a higher incidence of neuropsychiatric complications in the elderly group. The recent meta-analysis 
of Gomez Gavara did not fnd any diference in the risk of 
complications between young and elderly recipients [24]. 
It could be argued that the absence of the impact of age on 
early outcomes could result from a stringent selection of 
elderly recipients. Indeed, despite that the prevalence of 
cardiovascular comorbidities and diabetes increases with 
aging, not all studies reviewed in this work demonstrated 
signifcantly higher proportions of comorbidities in elderly 
recipients.
Long‑term outcomes after LT in elderly 
patients
Several scoring systems have been proposed for predicting 
long-term outcomes after LT. Most of the predictors are 
related to donor factors, intraoperative data, and parameters 
of the recipient. The age of the recipient had predictive value 
in several scores, such as the SOFT, the BAR score, and the 
donor to recipient model [25–27].
Similarly, data from American and European registries have shown lower post-transplant overall survival of 
older patients [5, 28]. The actuarial survival at 5 years was 
55% for UNOS patients older than 70 years vs. 73% for 
younger recipients. In Europe, 5-year survival rates were 
66% for recipients over 60 years vs. 73% for recipients aged 
46–60 years old. The natural lower life expectancy can 
explain the association between advancing age and increased 
mortality among old patients. In fact, the diferences in life 
expectancy between younger and older age groups can be 
accounted for as in cancer research [29]. This approach 
may also be considered in the feld of transplantation. Some 
investigators have pointed out that analysis based on crude 
survival is not valid and that we should think in terms of 
survival beneft from transplantation instead of post-LT survival. This suggests that a specifc statistical model should 
be used [30]. Rather than a Cox model, which gives the 
hazard ratio of death according to age, eventually adjusted 
to confounding factors, a transplant-related survival beneft 
should be used, as it can be defned. Consequently, Su et al. 
found that advanced age among UNOS transplanted patients 
had no impact on the transplant-related survival beneft for 
equivalent MELD scores or among patients with vs. those 
without HCC [11]. This fnding was explained by the fact 
that although post-LT survival was lower in older patients, 
the risk of death or exclusion from a waitlist, because of 
deterioration of general status, was higher. They concluded 
that patient age alone should not be used to disqualify a 
potential candidate for LT and that the current aging of 
recipients does not impair the survival beneft obtained by 
transplantation. Based on this discussion, age may be considered a variable in a potential future score, perhaps as a 
continuous variable, as suggested by Garcia et al. [31].
Selection of elderly candidates for LT
As reported previously, LT in elderly patients is feasible and 
does not seem to be associated with higher surgical risk. 
Moreover, transplant survival beneft remains similar to that 
of younger patients. Based on this evidence, the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver decided that age is 
not a limitation when considering LT for an elderly patient 
[32]. Similarly, the American Association for the Study 
of the Liver 2013 recommends considering physiologic 
rather than chronological age when evaluating a patient for 
LT [33]. However, both emphasized the need to screen for 
comorbidities.
• Comorbidities and cancer screening
 Good cardiac function is required to cope with the 
hemodynamical stress related to LT itself and other 
potential events such as hemorrhage and reperfusion 
syndrome. However, cirrhotic patients often sufer socalled cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, combining systolic and 
diastolic dysfunction, and electrophysiological abnormalities [34]. This pre-existing cardiomyopathy can be 
worsened by coronary arterial disease (CAD), the prevalence of which increases with aging. It is estimated that 
27% of patients over 50 years old with liver disease have 
moderate to severe coronaropathy [35]. A case—control 
study did not fnd an increased prevalence of CAD in 
patients with cirrhosis. Traditional cardiovascular risk 
factors remain relevant and should guide preoperative 
evaluation [36]. Specifc modalities of cardiac assessment are not well codifed, but there is a consensus to 
evaluate a candidate for LT by electrocardiogram and 
transthoracic echocardiography [32]. Patients with risk 
factors should have a cardiopulmonary exercise test done 
to diagnose asymptomatic CAD. This test also measures 
aerobic capacity, which is predictive of post-LT outcomes [37]. Although initial studies have reported that 
CAD carries high-risk post-transplant morbidity and 
mortality [38, 39], a recent multicentric study found a 
similar post-LT survival for patients with obstructive 
CAD and patients without obstructive CAD, provided 
they received adequate treatment prior to transplant. Specifcally, age>55 years with CAD was not found to be 
associated with higher mortality [40].
 Screening for asymptomatic malignancies is mandatory before enrolling a patient. For patients older

than 50 years, colonoscopy is recommended to detect 
colorectal cancer. In patients considered at risk, CT 
colonography can be an alternative. For patients with 
alcoholism or smokers, workup should rule out neoplasia arising from the lung, ear–nose–throat region, 
bladder, and esophagus. Chest CT scan, consultation 
with an ENT specialist and a stomatologist, and upper 
GI endoscopy (ideally during the same session with 
colonoscopy) are also useful. Dedicated consultation 
with a gynecologist and a dermatologist is also recommended [32].
• Nutritional status
 Nutritional status is a key factor to ensuring success 
after LT in all patients, irrespective of age. According to 
one study, recipients with a BMI<18.5 kg/m2 had the 
worst outcomes [41]. Since advanced age is a risk factor 
for malnutrition, physicians should pay attention to the 
nutritional status of older recipients. This evaluation is 
complex because the usual measures of assessing nutritional status are of little value in the setting of end-stage 
liver disease. The best surrogate marker seems to be sarcopenia, quickly evaluated by measuring the thickness 
of the psoas muscle on CT scan. Sarcopenia was demonstrated to be a strong predictor of post-LT mortality [13]. 
The 3-year survival rates ranged from 26 to 77% for the 
lowest to the highest quartiles of the psoas area, respectively. If poor nutritional status is a certain risk factor for 
early mortality, correcting malnutrition remains, in practice, an elusive goal for patients in poor general health 
[42]. No clear strategy to treat malnutrition in patients 
with cirrhosis has been established. Some groups have 
proposed placing an enteral feeding tube before LT in 
severely malnourished patients and a feeding jejunostomy during LT [43, 44].
• Frailty index
 Frailty is a condition which embodies weakness, 
muscle wasting, exhaustion, slow walking, and limited 
activity. Its prevalence is high in older adults. The presence of three or more of the above criteria defnes frailty, 
according to Fried [45]. The 6-min walk distance test 
was used initially to assess the relevance of frailty in LT 
candidates. Commonly used in patients with cardiac or 
pulmonary disease, this simple test was an efcient predictor of mortality after adjusting to confounding factors 
[46]. Frailty was observed in 43% of patients with endstage liver disease and was also associated with a higher 
risk of depression [47]. Lai et al. tested the concept of 
frailty in candidates awaiting LT and found that the risk 
of mortality or delisting increased by 45% per each point 
increase of the frailty index [48]. The negative impact of 
frailty on waiting list mortality has also been confrmed, 
but this efect remains unmodifed by age [49]. Similar fndings in patients≥65 years were reported using 
a diferent method for assessing frailty, a short physical 
performance battery [50].
 In elderly patients, candidacy for LT should be evaluated in light of sarcopenia, frailty, and cardiopulmonary 
reserves, which can be assessed easily by these methods. 
Combining this information is necessary to recognize 
which older patients are poor candidates for LT and 
which older patients are good candidates despite their 
age. These points also emphasize the need for a geriatric 
evaluation when older patients are referred for LT.
• Severity of liver disease and age
Should we take the severity of the liver disease itself into 
consideration when considering elderly transplant patients? 
As early as 2001, Levy et al. reported poor survival after 
LT in older patients at high risk, namely those hospitalized 
in an intensive care unit at the time of transplant or with 
high serum bilirubin levels [51]. Since 2002, the MELD 
score has become a worldwide predictor of mortality for 
patients waiting for a LT. Interestingly, the lower MELD 
scores of older recipients in most of the studies published 
during the MELD era [6, 8, 11, 52, 53] suggest that LT 
was reserved for older candidates with less severe disease 
and that a form of unconscious or conscious selection was 
applied. Despite this selection, some studies have reported 
poor results after transplanting elderly patients with high 
MELD scores [20, 48]. Similarly, a large analysis of transplanted patients 60 years old or older from the UNOS registry during 1994–2005 found that mechanical ventilation and 
creatinine were among the other independent predictors of 
post-transplant survival [12].
Age and graft allocation systems
Considering LT in the elderly also raises questions about the 
graft allocation system. An optimal allocation system aims 
to maximize "utility" while respecting "equity or justice" 
and avoiding "futility." To address the issue of utility, most 
of the allocation rules rely on the "sickest frst" principle. In 
a geographic area of severe graft shortage, this approach, 
mainly based on the MELD score, is considered the most 
reasonable [54]. Some adjustments are made using waiting 
time or prioritization so that patients needing LT, but with a 
low MELD score (cholangitis, cancer, metabolic disorder), 
have an equal chance for a transplant. However, MELDbased allocation systems carry the risk of futile LT if there 
is no defnite limit in the severity of the patient’s condition beyond which post-LT mortality is too high to justify 
LT. Countries with high donation rates have not chosen this 
approach. This more favorable situation allows centers to 
choose the optimal recipient for a given graft to maximize 
good long-term results.

Deciding on the most appropriate kind of graft for an 
elderly patient is important. According to a recent study, 
models with highest performance in predicting graft survival 
are those that are dominated by donor factors, suggesting 
that it is mainly donor-related factors that afect long-term 
graft survival. In contrast, short-term outcomes are best 
predicted by models dominated by recipient-related factors 
[55]. Given that old grafts are associated with lower longterm survival in many scoring systems [25, 26, 56, 57], but 
with little impact on short-term outcomes, an old graft for 
older recipients with shorter life expectancy could be an 
acceptable strategy. If the allocation rule is based only on 
age matching, this could lead to inequities in the chance 
of receiving an organ. Since there are more elderly donors 
than young donors, young recipients would have to wait 
much longer than older recipients [58]. Cucchetti et al. proposed an “age mapping” approach, working in two steps: 
frst, every patient has an equal chance to obtain a graft, 
but the best livers (basically, the youngest grafts) should 
be given to patients with the longest life expectancy. They 
also demonstrated that giving a graft from an old donor to a 
young recipient is more detrimental than giving it to an old 
recipient [59].
An argument against the “older to older” approach is that 
recipient age+donor age>120 was found to be the strongest 
independent predictor of poor survival in the UNOS registry [12]. This would mean that a recipient over 65 years 
would be given a graft from a donor younger than 55 years, 
which is impossible in countries with severe organ shortage. Given the other factors contributing to post-LT survival 
in this study, it seems that “older to older” is feasible provided that the recipient does not sufer from additional organ 
failure and is "ft" for transplant after meticulous workup. 
A new allocation system was implemented in the United 
Kingdom in 2018, in which the guiding principles rely upon 
the transplant beneft score (TBS) and proportional ofering 
by waiting time [60]. The TBS is defned as the diference 
between the patient’s expected utility from the transplant 
and their need. These two numbers are calculated by 27 variables, including the ages of the recipient and donor. This 
illustrates again that the prognostic value of the recipient’s 
age itself should be analyzed while considering numerous 
other parameters.
Conclusion
The age of LT recipients is increasing with the world’s 
aging adult population. Thus, the indications for LT in the 
elderly are becoming a frequent focus of discussion. There 
is growing consensus that LT in the elderly is feasible and 
has acceptable short- and long-term results, comparable 
to those of younger adults, and ofering similar transplant 
beneft. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal patient selection process in this population and the costefectiveness of transplanting older patients as opposed to 
younger patients has not been addressed. Moreover, quality 
of life, one of the secondary goals of transplantation, has 
not been sufciently studied in older recipients [61]. The 
place of retransplantation in elderly patients also remains 
unclear. The emotional toll of decisions about whether or not 
to transplant a given patient as well as the emotional factors 
afecting these decisions is rarely mentioned in the literature. 
Previous reviews have pointed out that studies available on 
this topic are retrospective and make it difcult to draw frm 
conclusions [24, 62]. Critical factors of successful LT in the 
elderly have been identifed and assessment tools are available. However, the indication for LT in the elderly patient is 
a complex decision, for which a multidisciplinary approach 
is a prerequisite.
