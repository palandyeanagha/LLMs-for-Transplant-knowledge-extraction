Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, particularly HEV genotype 1 (HEV-1), can result in fulminant
hepatic failure and severe placental diseases, but mechanisms underlying genotype-specific
pathogenicity are unclear and appropriate models are lacking. Here, we model HEV-1
infection ex vivo at the maternal-fetal interface using the decidua basalis and fetal placenta,
and compare its effects to the less-pathogenic genotype 3 (HEV-3). We demonstrate that
HEV-1 replicates more efficiently than HEV-3 both in tissue explants and stromal cells,
produces more infectious progeny virions and causes severe tissue alterations. HEV-1
infection dysregulates the secretion of several soluble factors. These alterations to the
cytokine microenvironment correlate with viral load and contribute to the tissue damage.
Collectively, this study characterizes an ex vivo model for HEV infection and provides insights
into HEV-1 pathogenesis during pregnancy that are linked to high viral replication, alteration
of the local secretome and induction of tissue injuries.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded, positive
polarity RNA virus that belongs to the Hepeviridae family.
Human cases of hepatitis E are caused by Orthohepevirus
A species, which comprises eight genotypes1. Genotypes 1 and 2
are obligate human pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route
that has been associated with large outbreaks and epidemics in
developing countries. Genotypes 3, 4, and 7 are responsible for
sporadic cases of zoonotic hepatitis E, primarily in industrialized
countries2,3.
HEV infection is usually asymptomatic or causes acute
self-limiting illness. In countries with poor sanitation, HEV-1
infection during pregnancy often results in fulminant hepatic
failure (FHF, in 15–30% of cases) associated with severe placental
diseases, including eclampsia, hemorrhage, membrane rupture,
spontaneous abortion, and stillbirths2,4. These fatal outcomes
resemble those reported for other harmful pathogens during
pregnancy and can be attributed to dysfunctions at the maternalfetal interface composed of the pregnant endometrium lining or
decidua basalis (decidua), and fetal placenta5–7. In western
countries where genotype 3 (HEV-3) prevails, HEV infection is
rather harmless during pregnancy8–10.
Significant effort has been made toward understanding HEV-1-
induced FHF during pregnancy. However, the causal relationship
between infection and placental dysfunction remains elusive. The
lack of appropriate in vivo and in vitro experimental models and
the difficulty to propagate the virus in vitro hampered the
understanding of this genotype-specific pathogenesis in pregnant
women. Although case reports and longitudinal studies using
peripheral blood samples have incriminated viral load, immune
response, hormones, and few signaling pathways in the observed
adverse pregnancy outcomes4,11, peripheral responses do not
accurately reflect the events occurring at the maternal-fetal
interface12. To our knowledge, only a single study identified viral
components in placental tissue from HEV-1-infected women,
suggesting the placenta as an extra-hepatic site for viral
replication13.
To provide insights into the genotype-specific pathogenicity of
HEV during pregnancy, we ex vivo modeled the pathological
HEV-1 and less-pathological HEV-3 infection at the maternalfetal interface using organ culture from the maternal decidua and
fetal placenta. Whereas both HEV genotypes are able to infect the
maternal-fetal interface, HEV-1 replicates more efficiently in
decidua and placenta tissue explants as well as in primary
fibroblast-like stromal cells isolated from both tissues, produces
higher amounts of infectious progeny virions and causes severe
morphological alterations. Furthermore, viral replication correlates with pronounced alterations in the cytokine, chemokine, and
growth factor networks at the maternal-fetal interface resulting in
an exacerbated tissue injury. Collectively, the genotype-specific
fatal outcomes during pregnancy are likely linked to efficient viral
replication and a dysregulated local secretome.
Results
Maternal-fetal interface supports high HEV-1 replication. We
ex vivo modeled HEV infections at the maternal-fetal interface
using organ cultures of the maternal decidua and fetal placenta
from elective pregnancy terminations and examined their susceptibility to clinical strains of HEV-1 and HEV-3 isolated at the
acute phase of infection from the feces of a traveler returning
from India and an autochthone infected patient, respectively.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a substantial replication
of HEV-1 that reached a plateau within 2 days in the placenta
and 5 days in the decidua (Fig. 1a, b). Although, following
similar trend, HEV-3 replication was significantly lower in both
tissues.
HEV replication is highly sensitive to anti-viral drugs such as
ribavirin (RBV) both in vitro and in clinical settings2,14. To further
corroborate our observation that HEV replicates at the maternalfetal interface, we treated infected tissues with an optimal dose of
50 µM of RBV and monitored viral replication over time.
Treatment with RBV resulted in strong inhibition of HEV-1 and
HEV-3 replication both in the decidual and placental tissue
explants (Supplementary Fig. 1). The lack of viral replication in
tissue explants exposed to UV-irradiated virions further strengthens the active replication of HEV at the maternal-fetal interface.
The fact that RBV treatment did not completely abrogate the viral
replication in the placenta organ cultures is probably due to the
complexity of the tissue architecture. Nonetheless, our findings
demonstrate that the detection of viral genome in the culture
supernatants is reminiscent of active viral replication.
To ascertain the tropism of HEV-1 during pregnancy, we then
performed in situ hybridization (ISH) on the infected tissue
explants using a set of probes covering the whole-HEV genome
(Fig. 1c, d). Hybridization with HEV probes resulted in a higher
amount of dot-like signals in HEV-1 infected samples compared
to HEV-3. In addition, HEV-1 positive cells showed a spatial
clustered signal distribution indicative of replication foci (Fig. 1c).
Compared to HEV-3, HEV-1-related signal tends to be more
intense (Fig. 1c). Nonetheless, quantitative analysis using large
microscopy fields revealed a 2 to 3-fold higher number of cells
infected with HEV-1 than HEV-3 in both tissues (Fig. 1d).
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the
maternal-fetal interface supports HEV replication with a better
tropism for HEV-1.
HEV-1 infection is associated with tissue injury. Lessons from
the TORCH (Toxoplasma, Others, Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus) infections have revealed that
viral replication at the maternal-fetal interface is associated with
tissue damage and adverse pregnancy outcome15,16. Furthermore,
apoptotic and necrotic features were previously reported in liver
biopsies from HEV infected patients17,18. Accordingly, we
assessed whether HEV infection impairs the morphology of the
maternal-fetal interface. We first evaluated the programmed cell
death by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labelling (TUNEL) staining of tissue sections 5 days post infection
(Fig. 2a, b). Mock-infected tissues showed a sparse to no TUNEL
staining; whereas a significant increase in the proportion of
TUNEL positive cells in HEV-1 infected decidua and placenta
tissue explants was observed (Fig. 2a, b). Apoptotic cells were
depicted both in the outer syncytiotrophoblast and the inner
cytotrophoblast layers as well as in the villus core of the placenta.
In contrast to HEV-1, HEV-3 infection led to scattered apoptotic
cells in both the decidua and placenta (Fig. 2a, b).
We next analyzed whether HEV infection impairs the
architecture of the maternal-fetal interface. Hematoxylin-Eosin
(HE) staining demonstrates that HEV-1 infection induces
significant injury to the decidua and placenta as evidenced by
the necrotic features, such as pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and
karyolysis (Fig. 2c, d). Furthermore, HEV-1-infected placenta
displayed a drastic disruption of the trophoblastic layer (Fig. 2d).
The effects of HEV-3 infection were milder in both tissues
(Fig. 2c, d).
Taken together, our findings demonstrate that HEV-1 infection
induces significant increase in tissue injury at the maternal-fetal
interface that might account for the morbid pregnancy complications reported during pregnancy.

within first semester of pregnancy, is mandatory not only for
embryo implantation but also for the maternal-fetal tolerance.
Any alteration to the local secretome can provoke pregnancyrelated disorders19,20. Therefore, we assessed the impact of HEV1 and HEV-3 infection on the maternal-fetal interface secretory
profile. Based on their respective roles during pregnancy19–22, the
levels of selected cytokines (IL-6, IL-15, IL-18, TNF-α, and
sICAM-1), chemokines (CCL-3, CCL-4, CCL-5, and CXCL-10),
growth factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF, and VEGF-A), and metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) were quantified in tissue culture supernatants 2 days post infection (Fig. 3).
We observed three secretion profiles upon infection of decidual
and placental tissues with HEV. The first profile includes factors
that are not affected by infection, such as G-CSF, VEGF-A,
MMP-2, and MMP-9 in the decidua (Fig. 3a) and VEGF-A,
MMP-2 in the placenta (Fig. 3b). The second profile comprises
factors that are increased by infection independently of the viral
genotype including sICAM-1 and GM-CSF in both tissues
(Fig. 3a, b), or G-CSF and MMP-9 only in the placenta (Fig. 3b).
The last profile consists of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-6,
CCL-3, CCL-4, and CXCL-10) that are differentially regulated by
HEV-1 and HEV-3 infection. Compared to HEV-3, IL-6, CCL-3,
and CCL-4 secretion is markedly enhanced by HEV-1 infection,
while CXCL-10 is significantly depressed in both tissues.
Regardless of the infection, TNF-α, IL-15, IL-18, and CCL-5
were absent or barely detected.
We next investigated the relationship between the level of the
differentially altered factors and HEV-1 or HEV-3 replication in
decidual and placental tissue. The secretion levels of IL-6, CCL-3,
CCL-4, CXCL-10, and HEV-1 load in decidual explants were highly
correlated with a 0.0001 ≤ P-value ≤ 0.003 and a R-value ≥ 0.80
using Spearman’s ranked correlation test (Fig. 3c). HEV-1 load was
also highly correlated with CCL-3, CCL-4, CXCL-10 levels in the
placenta with a 0.047 ≤ P-value ≤ 0.0001 and a R-value ≥ 0.82 using

Spearman’s ranked correlation test (Fig. 3d). Although, it reached
significance, the effect of HEV-1 replication on the IL-6 placental
production was very low. Unlike HEV-1, only moderate correlations were observed between HEV-3 and cytokine production both
in the decidua and placenta samples (Supplementary Fig. 2).
To further visualize the global pattern of soluble factor

HEV-1 at the far end of the mock, while HEV-3 clustered at an
intermediate position. Thus, PCA analysis reveals a genotypespecific cytokine signature that discriminates HEV-1 from HEV-3
and may contribute to the differential viral pathogenicity at the
maternal-fetal interface.
To determine the impact of the changes in the cytokine
environment, we challenged fresh decidua and placenta organ
cultures with UV-irradiated conditioned medium (UV-CM)
harvested from their respective HEV-1- or HEV-3-infected

of histological sections (Fig. 4c, d) revealed that the tissue injury is
significantly more prominent with UV-CM obtained from HEV1-infected samples for both the decidua and placenta. Nonetheless, the tissue disruption in the presence of UV-CM is less
prominent than with the original inoculum (Fig. 2) suggesting
that HEV-induced damage was at least partially due to alterations
in the cytokine/chemokine networks.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that HEV-1 infection
has higher capacity than HEV-3 to alter the secretome at the
maternal-fetal interface further contributing to HEV-1 associated
tissue injury.
HEV-1 replication impairs the type III interferon secretion.
Innate sensing of invading pathogens has been clearly associated
with the production of interferons (IFNs) that can impede the
replication of a broad spectrum of viruses23–27. Nonetheless, at
mid-gestation, the human placenta produces large amounts of
type III IFNs even in the absence of threats. This constitutive
release of IFNs correlated with expression of interferonstimulated genes (ISGs) have been suggested as a persistent
defense mechanism during the second trimester of pregnancy28.
In order to shed light on the mechanisms that underlie the discrepancies between HEV-1 and HEV-3 replication at the
maternal-fetal interface, we assessed the secretion profiles of type
I (IFN-α2 and -β), type II (IFN-γ) and type III (IFN-λ1, -λ2/3)
IFNs in tissue culture supernatants 2 days post infection (Fig. 5).
Regardless of the infection, both the decidua and the placenta
produced low levels of IFN-α2, IFN-β and IFN-γ (Fig. 5a, b).
However, HEV-1 infection significantly impaired the production
of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3 in the decidual, and IFN-λ2/3 in the
placental explants, while HEV-3 infection has no impact on type
III IFN secretion (Fig. 5a, b). Correlation analyses demonstrated
that the production of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2/3 is negatively correlated with HEV-1 load in the decidua (p ≤ 0.0087 by Spearman’s ranked correlation test, Fig. 5c), while correlation is
observed only for IFN-λ2/3 in the placental tissues (p = 0.0096 by
Spearman’s ranked correlation test, Fig. 5d).
To ascertain the role of type III IFNs in HEV infection, we
treated infected tissues with either IFN-λ1 or IFN-λ2 and
monitored viral replication over time. Quantitative RT-PCR
analysis revealed that both cytokines significantly inhibit HEV-1
replication in the decidual tissue explants (Fig. 5e). However, the
effect of these cytokines was less prominent in the placental
settings and inhibition was observed only with IFN-λ2 treatment
(Fig. 5f).
Taken together, these findings suggest that HEV-1 antagonizes
type III IFN production to sustain its efficient replication at the
maternal-fetal interface.
HEV-1 targets stromal cells at the maternal-fetal interface.
Stromal cells contribute actively to the maintenance of tissue
homeostasis by supporting the tissue vascular remodeling and the
development of the fetal placenta, which are mandatory for a
successful pregnancy29. Several pathogens that threaten the
pregnancy replicate within these cells impacting their proper
function22,29–31. Therefore, we next assessed whether fibroblastlike stromal cells (stroma) derived from decidual and placental
tissues could support HEV replication (Fig. 6). We infected
freshly isolated decidual and placental stromal cells with either
HEV-1 or HEV-3 and monitored viral replication over time. In
parallel, we used the prototypic human hepatocellular carcinoma
HepG2/C3A cell line as a control (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the replication
of HEV-1 was significantly higher than HEV-3 after 7 days of
infection, reaching 4.6-fold and 2.4-fold increase in decidual and
placental stromal cells respectively (Fig. 6a, b). The presence of
the ORF2 viral capsid protein in both stromal cell types further
confirmed the higher infection of HEV-1 (Fig. 6c, d). In contrast
to stromal cells, the HepG2/C3A cell line showed efficient replication only for HEV-3 as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR
analysis and ORF2 immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 3). In
agreement with previous data32, microscopic analysis did not
show any cytopathic effects of HEV-1 or HEV-3 in these primary
stroma cells.
Collectively, our data identify the maternal-fetal stromal cells
as targets for HEV infection that are more likely to support HEV1 replication rather than HEV-3.
HEV-1 alters the secretome of primary stromal cells. We next
investigated whether HEV infection impairs the dynamic
secretory function of stroma cells19,20,22,29. Two days post
infection, supernatants were collected from HEV-1, HEV-3, or
mock-infected decidual and placental stromal cell cultures, and
soluble factors were subsequently quantified (Fig. 7). Compared
to HEV-3, HEV-1 infection resulted in significant increase of
several pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, sICAM-1,
CCL-3, CCL-4, G-CSF, and GM-CSF in decidual cells (Fig. 7a).
Infection of placental cells induced lesser amounts of these
mediators with significantly higher secretion of IL-6 and sICAM1 in HEV-1 infected cultures (Fig. 7b). Irrespective of HEV
genotype, VEGF-A was increased only in placental stroma and
the production of metalloproteinases was not affected in both cell
types (Fig. 7a, b).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that HEV-1, and to a
lesser extent HEV-3, skews the cytokine, chemokine, and growth
factor secretory profile in both the decidual and placental stroma,
corroborating the observations made with tissue explants. Thus,
the HEV-1 infection of decidual and placental stroma cells may
not only favor viral dissemination but also impair their tissuesupport functions and underlie some of the adverse pregnancy
outcomes associated with this HEV genotype.
HEV-1 and HEV-3 progeny display differential infectivity. To
provide further insights into the differential pathogenicity of

HEV-1 and HEV-3 at the maternal-fetal interface, we assessed the
infectivity of HEV-1 and HEV-3 progeny virions. Equivalent copy
number of viral RNA recovered from HEV-1 and HEV-3 infected
decidual and placental explant supernatants were used to infect
primary stromal cells or HepG2/C3A cell line. Data depicted in
Fig. 8 demonstrate that supernatants recovered from infected
tissues contain infectious progeny virions that can replicate in
both type of cells. Compared to HEV-3, HEV-1 virions replicated
at a significantly higher rate in decidual and placental stroma cells
(Fig. 8a, b). In contrast, HEV-3 virions replicated more efficiently
in HepG2/C3A cells (Fig. 8c, d). Thus, HEV-1 infection of the
maternal-fetal tissues generates infectious progeny virions that
preserve the tropism of the original inoculum and replicate more
efficiently than HEV-3 in both decidual and placental stroma

cells. The HEV-1 progeny virions released at the maternal-fetal
interface could then easily spread to neighboring cells, thereby
promoting viral dissemination in utero and might explain the
underlying pathogenicity of HEV-1 rather than HEV-3 during
pregnancy.
Discussion
The mechanisms underlying HEV genotype-specific severity
during pregnancy and viral transmission to the fetus remain
poorly understood. Using an ex vivo model of first trimester
maternal-fetal interface, we provide here the first evidence that
the decidua and the placenta are prone to HEV-1 infection rather
than HEV-3, resulting in the generation of infectious progeny
virions.
Being highly irrigated, the maternal-fetal interface is exposed to
viral particles present in circulating blood after ingestion of
infected components or release of progeny virions from infected
hepatocytes33,34. The presence of high viral loads in sera from
pregnant women with FHF and experiencing placental disease is
in favor of this hematogenous spread35. Our findings advance the
state-of-the-art by highlighting the interplay between the decidua
and the placenta at the maternal-fetal interface in association with
the preponderance of stroma cells as a vertical transmission
mechanism of HEV similar to the TORCH pathogens5,6,19,30,36.
Genotype-dependent factors may favor HEV-1 replication in
decidual and placental tissues. The newly discovered ORF4 protein encoded by the HEV-1 genome could therefore recruit other
viral proteins and/or host-related factors to promote HEV-1
replication37. The expression of the ORF1 and ORF3 viral
proteins can also impair the host innate immune response
through blockade of the IFN or retinoic-acid-inducible gene-1
(RIG-1)-like signaling pathways resulting in viral escape38,39.
Several reports have highlighted differences in the production of
IFNs as well as the subsequent induction of ISGs23–27,40. Both the
HEV strain and experimental settings could probably contribute
to these discrepancies. Herein, neither HEV-1 nor HEV-3-
induced type I and type II IFN secretion at the maternal-fetal
interface. However, HEV-1 viral load was negatively correlated to
the expression of type III IFNs and CXCL-10. This significant
decrease of IFN-λ, associated with the inhibition of HEV-1
replication by type III IFNs, suggest that HEV-1 subverts the IFN
signaling pathway to replicate efficiently. The moderate inhibition
of HEV-1 by IFN-λ2 in placental tissue might be inherent to the
tissue architecture and factors, the induction of IFN resistant ISGs
or persistent activation of the JAK/STAT signaling25.
Our findings highlight also a distinct pathogenicity between
HEV genotypes at the maternal-fetal interface and provides a
plausible explanation for the discrepant outcomes between
HEV-1 and HEV-3 infection during pregnancy. We clearly
demonstrate that HEV-1 is associated with increased apoptosis
and necrosis at the maternal-fetal interface with alterations of the
placental barrier architecture. HEV-associated tissue apoptosis
and necrosis have been previously reported in liver biopsies of
infected patients and animal models17,18,41. While, the origin of
this tissue injury remains elusive a recent study suggested that it
might involve mitochondrial damage and/or activation of the
caspase family members41. Our results revealed also that HEV-1
infection alters the secretion profile of decidual/placental tissues
and cells. These findings are consistent with data correlating the
increase of several pro-inflammatory factors in the peripheral
blood from HEV-1 infected women with adverse pregnancy
outcomes42. Under steady-state conditions, the secretome within
the female reproductive tract and gestational tissue is finely tuned
to support embryo implantation, placental development, and fetal
immune tolerance. Conversely, an uncontrolled, prolonged, or
excessive mediator secretion in response to viral infection has
previously been associated with tissue injury and adverse pregnancy outcomes19–22,43. Indeed, a pro-inflammatory microenvironment may lead to the recruitment and activation/
differentiation of pro-inflammatory cells and/or additional viral
targets44,45. Consequently, a positive feedback loop can be
established and exacerbates the local response, further amplifying
tissue damage and viral spread. By modulating cytokine and Decidual stroma HEV RNA (×104 copies/mL)

chemokine expression, HEV may also alter leukocyte chemotaxis
resulting in ineffective immune response and impaired viral
clearance. In addition to elevated local inflammation, defective or
inadequate placental development may explain HEV-1-associated
pregnancy disorders. For instance, the HEV-1 associated decrease
of CXCL-10 could impair the invasion/migration of the fetal
trophoblast and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries, both of
which are mandatory for successful placentation46–49. Our findings that conditioned media from infected samples induces tissue
damage even in the absence of viral replication further highlight
the involvement of the local environment in HEV-1 pathogenicity
and underscore the importance of host factors that can also
promote viral pathogenicity17,45. However, we cannot exclude the
contribution of viral capsid protein and/or RNA in the induction
and/or promotion of the release of soluble mediators. Nevertheless, the greater effects with HEV-1 clinical strain would
suggest that both virus- and host-related factors contribute to the
viral pathogenesis during pregnancy.
Despite the scarce information concerning HEV-3 during
pregnancy, the lack of clinical manifestations suggests that the
pro-inflammatory response to HEV-3 may correspond to a minor
bystander effect that is harmless to fetal development. It’s also
possible that elements of the maternal immune system might
limit HEV-3 replication at the maternal-fetal interface avoiding
any pregnancy complications. As a matter of fact, we have
previously demonstrated that Natural Killer cells from the
maternal innate immune system can control the replication of
human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus, preventing
the development of congenital infection29,50.
Most of pregnancy diseases related to HEV-1 infection have
been reported mainly in the second and third trimester. Lessons
learned from the TORCH pathogens have demonstrated that
infections during early pregnancy are highly detrimental to fetal
development. However, HEV-1-induced illness during the first
trimester has not been well documented although it might be
detrimental for pregnancy outcome. Even if our ex vivo model of
first trimester pregnancy, similar to any other experimental
model, has its limits, our findings within this model are the first
suggesting that HEV-1 infection in early pregnancy may result in
clinical symptoms that can be intermingled with pregnancy disorders, such as spontaneous abortion, or preeclampsia. The
immunological and hormonal changes in later terms may then
worsen the outcome of the pregnancy. Additional studies using
samples from term pregnancy and/or in utero infected women as
well as other viral strains warrant further investigations to fulfill
our understanding of HEV pathogenicity.
In summary, our data suggest that the viral tropism and efficient replication combined with abnormal pro-inflammatory
cytokine and chemokine secretion dictate the extent of tissue
damage at the maternal-fetal interface and might be responsible
for HEV-1-associated pregnancy disorders (Fig. 9). Beyond
providing an explanatory mechanism for the severity of HEV-1
infection during pregnancy, we now present a new experimental
model to study HEV infection, setting the stage for the testing
and development of novel therapeutic strategies directed toward
supporting human pregnancy.

Tissue culture and isolation of primary cells. First trimester pregnancy samples
(8–12 weeks of pregnancy) were obtained from healthy women (aged 18–30 years)
following an elective vaginal termination of pregnancy51. Briefly, 0.3 cm2 of tissue
explant was prepared from the decidua basalis (decidua) and placenta and maintained for up to 2 weeks in DMEM:F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS). Matched decidua and placenta samples were used in all the experiments.
For primary cell isolation, matrix digestion and cellular disaggregation were
achieved with a 45 min (37 °C) digest with the enzyme, collagenase IV (SigmaAldrich, France). Mononuclear cells were then isolated from the cell suspension by
Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient separation (Amersham Biotech) and plated
overnight at 37 °C. Fibroblast-like stromal cells were enriched by successive rounds
of mild trypsinization29. Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2/C3A cell line
(ATCC CRL-10741) was maintained in DMEM culture medium supplemented
with 10% FCS.
HEV clinical strains and infection protocol. HEV-1 and HEV-3 clinical strains
were obtained at the acute phase of infection from the feces of a traveler returning
from India and an autochthone infected patient, respectively. Patients were tested
negative for HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C. Fecal samples were diluted in DMEM
and centrifuged at 1200×g for 10 min. Viral strains were recovered from the
supernatant and passed through a 22 µm filter. HEV RNA was quantified by RTqPCR with aliquots stored at −80 °C until use. Matched decidua and placenta
explants were infected with the same HEV-1 or HEV-3 clinical strain.
Tissue were infected over a 24 h period (at 35.5 °C) with 2 × 107 copies of
HEV-1 or HEV-3 RNA (~MOI 10) in a 24-well plate and a final volume of 500 µl
of DMEM:F-12 supplemented with 2% FCS; mock controls comprised uninfected
explants. Each explant is then washed five times in PBS. The explants are then laid
on collagen sponges in DMEM:F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS and cultured at
37 °C and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere30.
Prior to infection, primary stromal cells isolated from either the decidua or
placenta and HepG2/C3A cells were seeded in 6-well plates overnight (5 × 105 cells/
well). Cells were then infected with 107 RNA copies of either HEV-1, HEV-3
(~MOI 20), or were left uninfected in a final volume of 1 ml of DMEM:F-12
containing 2% FCS at 35.5 °C. After 24 h, the cell layer was rinsed five times with
PBS and subsequently cultured in 2% FCS-medium at 35.5 °C.
At different time points post infection, half of the cell culture supernatant was
collected and replaced with fresh media. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C for
subsequent quantification of viral RNA and soluble mediators. For viral production
kinetics, day 0 supernatant was collected after wash before culture. The residual
value obtained for day 0 was subtracted from each kinetic point. Residual day 0
values were 1 × 105 copies/ml and 3 × 105 copies/ml for decidua and placenta
respectively, regardless of the genotype.
HEV quantification. HEV RNA was extracted from culture supernatants using the
QiaAmp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The RNA quantification was performed using one-step, real-time RT-PCR with a LightCycler 480
instrument (Roche Diagnostics, France). The following primers targeting the
ORF2/ORF3 overlapping region were used: Forward primer (5′-
GGTGGTTTCTGGGGTGAC-3′), Reverse primer (5′-AGGGGTTGGTTGGATG
AA-3′) and the probe 5′–6-carboxyfluorescein
(FAM)–TGATTCTCAGCCCTTCGC–6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine
(TAMRA)–3′. The amplification efficiency was then calculated using the standard
curve. RNA standards were designed using a conserved fragment within the ORF3
gene (70 nt) amplified from an HEV infected patient sample and cloned into
pGEM.3Z vector. The fragment was then retro-transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase. The obtained positive strand was used as the RNA standard in all the
quantitative RT-PCR experiments. A standard curve was generated from the serial
tenfold dilutions of this RNA standard52,53. Data for normalized RT-qPCR values
were presented as viral RNA copies/mL. The detection limit for this validated
method is 100 HEV RNA copies/mL.
Histological analyses. After 5 days, mock, HEV-1, or HEV-3 infected decidual or
placental tissue explants were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
then 3-micron thick sections processed for histological analyses using hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining, in situ hybridization (ISH) and terminal deoxynucleotidyle transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay.
Histology slides were scanned using the Panoramic 250 Flash system (3DHISTECH, Hungary). Images were processed using the Panoramic Viewer software
(3DHISTECH, Hungary). The quantification of necrosis (H&E staining) in infected
samples versus mock-infected controls was performed in ten high power fields per
sample taken randomly.
For ISH of HEV RNA, tissue sections were processed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, USA). The commercially
available HEV-specific probes (V-HEV) were used to detect the positive strand
RNA. RNase-free conditions were maintained during all steps. Slides were scanned
using ×40 objective. For ISH quantification, the number of HEV-positive cells was
counted in ten random regions that cover the whole slide and then reported to the
area (cm2) of each region.
The apoptotic cells were detected in situ by TUNEL assay using a Cell Death
Detection Kit, TMR red (Sigma-Aldrich, France). The sections were processed
according to the manufacturer’s directions. The slides were further stained with
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:5000 dilution, Sigma). Histology slides
were scanned using ×20 objective. Apoptotic cells with red plot within the nuclei
and normal cells with blue nuclei were identified in the processed sections. The
quantification of apoptosis in infected samples versus mock-infected controls was
performed in ten high power fields per sample taken randomly.
Quantification of soluble factors. Culture supernatants were collected 2 days post
infection and stored at −80 °C for quantification of soluble mediators. Seventeenmultiplexed Affymetrix cytokine assays (Procarta/eBioscience, France) were used
to quantify cytokines (IL-6, IL-15, IL-18, IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and
sICAM-1), chemokines (CCL-3, CCL-4, CCL-5, and CXCL-10), growth factors
(G-CSF, GM-CSF, and VEGF-A), and metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Interferons assessment was conducted by
Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) using the Human Type 1/2/3 Interferon Panel
(5-plex) (Biolegend, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Principal component analysis (PCA). PCA of IL-6, CCL-3, CCL-4, and CXCL-10
in both decidual and placental tissues were performed using ClustVis web tool
(http://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/). Values were centered, unit variance scaling was
applied to rows and single value decomposition with imputation was used to
calculate principal components.
Preparation of conditioned medium (CM). Mock, HEV-1, or HEV-3 infected
decidual or placental explant supernatants were collected 5 days post infection and
then UV-irradiated for 30 min using Spectroline EF-140/F UV lamp (220 volts, 50
HZ, 17 Amps). The UV treatment was sufficient to abolish viral infection. Fresh

Fig. 8 HEV-1 replication in explants derived from the decidua and placenta
generates infectious progeny particles. Freshly isolated stromal cells a, b, or
the HepG2/C3A cell line c, d, were challenged with culture supernatants
(SN) from either HEV-1 (red), or HEV-3 (cyan) infected decidual a, c, or
placental b, d explants. Viral replication was then followed over a 2-week
period by RT-qPCR. Data represent means values ± S.E.M. of six
independent donors. * denotes a statistical comparison made between
HEV-1 and HEV-3 infected cells. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 by two-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test.

decidual and placental explants were then cultured for 5 days in decidual UV-CM
and placental UV-CM, respectively, before further analyses.
Immunocytochemistry and fluorescence microscopy. Primary decidual and
placental stromal cells or HepG2/C3A cells were plated on glass coverslips and then
infected with either HEV-1, HEV-3, or were left uninfected. Seven days post
infection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3%
Triton X-100, and stained with antibodies against the HEV capsid protein (antiORF2, clones 1E6 and 4B2, 1:200 dilution, Clinisciences) and vimentin, a stromal
cell marker (1:100 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) for primary cells or αtubulin for HepG2/C3A cells (1:250 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich). Bound primary
antibodies were visualized by the addition of Alexa Fluor-conjugated, class-specific
secondary antibodies (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with 4,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:5000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich). Z-stack images
were acquired using an LSM710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) with
×63 oil objective. Images were processed using the Imaris software (Bitplane AG,
Switzerland).
Identification of infectious progeny virions. Culture supernatants were collected
from HEV-1 or HEV-3 infected explants 5 days post infection with viral load
quantified by RT-qPCR. Freshly isolated stromal cells, or the HepG2/C3A cell line
(ATCC CRL-10741), were then infected with 5 × 105 RNA copies from each
supernatant. After extensive washing, viral replication was followed over a 5-week
period as described above.
Ribavirin and interferon treatment. Ribavirin (RBV) and recombinant IFN-λ1
and IFN-λ2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Peprotech France respectively. Tissue explants were treated with 50 µM of RBV or 100 ng/mL of IFN-λ after
HEV infection and were maintained in tissue culture until the end point of the
experiment.
Statistical analyses. All experiments were conducted on matched decidua and
placenta samples from the same donor. The total number of independent donors
for each experiment is indicated in the figure legend. Graphs represent mean values
with error bars indicating the S.E.M. Statistical analyses were performed using the
GraphPad Prism software 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA). Two-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare the
kinetics of HEV-1 and HEV-3 viral production in tissue explants, and in isolated
primary cells from the same donors. Repeated measures ANOVA with the Tukey
post hoc test was used to compare values for mock, HEV-1, and HEV-3 infected
samples from the same donors. Correlations between soluble factor secretion and
viral production were calculated with Spearman’s rank correlation test. * denotes a
statistical comparison made between HEV-1 and HEV-3 infected tissues or cells. #
denotes a statistical comparison made between mock and HEV-1 or HEV-3
infected tissues or cells. P-values< 0.05 were considered to be significant
(*/#P < 0.05; **/##P < 0.01; ***/###P < 0.001).
