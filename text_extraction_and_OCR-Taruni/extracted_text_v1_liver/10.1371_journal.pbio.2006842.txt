Abstract
Composed of hundreds of microbial species, the composition of the human gut microbiota
can vary with chronic diseases underlying health disparities that disproportionally affect ethnic minorities. However, the influence of ethnicity on the gut microbiota remains largely
unexplored and lacks reproducible generalizations across studies. By distilling associations
between ethnicity and differences in two US-based 16S gut microbiota data sets including
1,673 individuals, we report 12 microbial genera and families that reproducibly vary by ethnicity. Interestingly, a majority of these microbial taxa, including the most heritable bacterial
family, Christensenellaceae, overlap with genetically associated taxa and form co-occurring
clusters linked by similar fermentative and methanogenic metabolic processes. These
results demonstrate recurrent associations between specific taxa in the gut microbiota and
ethnicity, providing hypotheses for examining specific members of the gut microbiota as
mediators of health disparities.
Author summary
Understanding microbiota similarities and differences across ethnicities has the potential
to advance approaches aimed at personalized microbial discovery and treatment, particularly those involved in ethnic health disparities. Here, we explore whether or not selfdeclared ethnicity consistently varies with gut microbiota composition across 1,673
healthy individuals in the United States. We find subtle but significant differences in taxonomic composition between four ethnicities, and we replicate these results across two
study populations. Within the gut microbiota of Americans, there are at least 12 microbial
taxa, which reproducibly vary in abundance across ethnicities. These taxa tend to correlate
in abundance and metabolic functions and overlap with previously identified taxa that are
associated with human genetic variation. We discuss the roles these taxa play in digestion

Introduction
The human gut microbiota at fine resolution varies extensively between individuals [1–3], and
this variability frequently associates with diet [4–7], age [6, 8, 9], sex [6, 9, 10], body mass
index (BMI) [1, 6], and diseases presenting as health disparities [11–14]. The overlapping risk
factors and burden of many chronic diseases disproportionally affect ethnic minorities in the
United States, yet the underlying biological mechanisms mediating these substantial disparities
largely remain unexplained. Recent evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that ethnicity
associates with variation in microbial abundance, specifically in the oral cavity, gut, and vagina
[15–17]. To varying degrees, ethnicity can capture many facets of biological variation including social, economic, and cultural variation, as well as aspects of human genetic variation and
biogeographical ancestry. Ethnicity also serves as a proxy to characterize health disparity incidence in the US, and while factors such as genetic admixture create ambiguity of modern ethnic identity, self-declared ethnicity has proven a useful proxy for genetic and socioeconomic
variation in population scale analyses, including in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP)
[18–20]. Microbiota differences have been documented across populations that differ in ethnicity as well as in geography, lifestyle, and sociocultural structure; however, these global
examinations cannot disconnect factors such as intercontinental divides and hunter–gatherer
versus western lifestyles from ethnically structured differences [21–23]. Despite the importance of understanding the interconnections between ethnicity, microbiota, and health disparities, there are no reproducible findings about the influence of ethnicity on differences in the
gut microbiota and specific microbial taxa in diverse US populations, even for healthy individuals [6].
Here, we comprehensively examine connections between self-declared ethnicity and gut
microbiota differences across more than a thousand individuals sampled by the American Gut
Project (AGP, N = 1375) [24] and the HMP (N = 298) [6]. Previous studies demonstrated that
human genetic diversity in the HMP associates with differences in microbiota composition
[25], and genetic population structure within the HMP generally delineates self-declared ethnicity [20]. Ethnicity was not found to have a significant association with microbiota composition in a Middle Eastern population; however, factors such as lifestyle and environment that
influence microbiota variation across participants was homogenous compared to the ethnic,
sociocultural, economic, and dietary diversity found within the US [26]. While ethnic diversity
is generally under-represented in current microbiota studies, evidence supporting an ethnic
influence on microbiota composition among first generation immigrants has been recently
demonstrated in a Dutch population [27]. The goal of this examination is to evaluate, for the
first time, if there are reproducible differences in gut microbiota across ethnicities within an
overlapping US population, as ethnicity is one of the key defining factors for health disparity
incidence in the US. Lifestyle, dietary, and genetic factors all vary to different degrees across
ethnic groups in the US, and it will require more even sampling of ethnic diversity and stricter
phenotyping of study populations to disentangle which factors underlie ethnic microbiota variation in the AGP and HMP.

Results
Microbiota are subtly demarcated by ethnicity
We first evaluate gut microbiota distinguishability between AGP ethnicities (Fig 1A, family
taxonomic level, Asian-Pacific Islanders [N = 88], Caucasians [N = 1237], Hispanics [N = 37],
and African Americans [N = 13]), sexes (female [N = 657], male [N = 718]), age groups (years
grouped by decade), and categorical BMI (underweight [N = 70], normal [N = 873], overweight [N = 318], and obese [N = 114]) (Demographic details in S1A Table). Age, sex, and
BMI were selected as covariates because they are consistent across the AGP and HMP data
sets. Additionally, 31 other AGP categorical factors measuring diet, environment, and geography were compared for pairwise differences between two ethnicities using proportions tests,
and very few (10/894) tests significantly varied (S1 Table additional sheets). Interindividual
gut microbiota heterogeneity clearly dominates; however, analyses of similarity (ANOSIM)
reveal subtle but significant degrees of total microbiota distinguishability for ethnicity, BMI,
and sex but not for age (Fig 1B, Ethnicity; Fig 1C, BMI; Fig 1D, Sex; Fig 1E, Age) [28]. Recognizing that subtle microbiota distinguishability between ethnicities may be spurious, we independently replicate the ANOSIM results from HMP African Americans (N = 10), Asians
(N = 34), Caucasians (N = 211), and Hispanics (N = 43) (S2A Table, R = 0.065, p = 0.044). We
again observe no significant distinguishability for BMI, sex, and age in the HMP. Higher rarefaction depths increase microbiota distinguishability in the AGP across various beta diversity
metrics and categorical factors (S2B Table), and significance increases when individuals from
over-represented ethnicities are subsampled from the average beta diversity distance matrix
(S2C Table). Supporting the ANOSIM results, Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) models with four different beta diversity metrics showed that while all
factors had subtle but significant associations with microbiota variation when combined in a
single model, effect sizes were highest for ethnicity in seven out of eight comparisons across
beta diversity metrics and rarefaction depths in the AGP and HMP (S2D Table). We additionally test microbiota distinguishability by measuring the correlation between beta diversity and
ethnicity, BMI, sex, and age with an adapted BioEnv test (S2E Table) [29]. Similar degrees of
microbiota structuring occur when all factors are incorporated (Spearman Rho = 0.055, p-values: Ethnicity = 0.057, BMI < 0.001, Sex < 0.001, Age = 0.564). Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
dominated the relative phylum abundance, with each representing between 35% and 54% of
the total microbiota across ethnicities (S1 Fig).
We next test for ethnicity signatures in the gut microbiota by analyzing alpha and beta
diversity, abundance and ubiquity distributions, distinguishability, and classification accuracy
[30]. Shannon’s Alpha Diversity Index [31], which weights both microbial community richness (observed operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) and evenness (Equitability), significantly
varies across ethnicities in the AGP data set (Kruskal–Wallis, p = 2.8e-8) with the following
ranks: Hispanics > Caucasians > Asian-Pacific Islanders > African Americans (Fig 2A). In
the HMP, there is a significantly lower Shannon diversity for Asian-Pacific Islanders relative to
Caucasians and a trend of lower Shannon diversity for Asian-Pacific Islanders relative to Hispanics; African Americans change position in diversity relative to other ethnicities, potentially
as a result of undersampling bias. Five alpha diversity metrics, two rarefaction depths, and separate analyses of Observed OTUs and Equitability generally confirm the results (S3A Table).
If ethnicity impacts microbiota composition, pairwise beta diversity distances (ranging
from 1/completely dissimilar to 0/identical) will be greater between ethnicities than within
ethnicities. While average gut microbiota beta diversities across all individuals are high (Bray–
Curtis = 0.808), beta diversities between individuals of the same ethnicity (intraethnic, Bray–
Curtis = 0.806) are subtly but significantly lower than those between ethnicities in both the

AGP (interethnic, Bray–Curtis = 0.814) and HMP data sets (intraethnic, Bray–Curtis = 0.870
versus interethnic, Bray–Curtis = 0.877) (Fig 2B). We confirm AGP results by subsampling
individuals from over-represented ethnicities across beta metrics and rarefaction depths

(S4A and S4B Table). Finally, we repeat analyses across beta metrics and rarefaction depths
using only the average distance of each individual to all individuals from the ethnicity to which
they are compared (S4C and S4D Table).

Next, we explore interethnic differences in the number of OTUs shared in at least 50% of
individuals within an ethnicity, as the likelihood of detecting a biological signal is improved in
more abundant organisms relative to noise that may predominate in lower abundance OTUs.
Out of 5,591 OTUs in the total AGP data set, 101 (1.8%) OTUs meet this ubiquity cutoff in all
ethnicities, and 293 (5.2%) OTUs meet the cutoff within at least one ethnicity. Hispanics share
the most ubiquitous OTUs and have the lowest average abundance/ubiquity (A/U) ratio (Fig
2C), indicating stability, whereby stability represents a more consistent appearance of OTUs
with lower abundance but higher ubiquity [32]. This result potentially explains their significantly lower intraethnic beta diversity distance and thus higher microbial community overlap
relative to the other ethnicities (Fig 2B). Comparisons in the AGP between the higher sampled
Hispanic, Caucasian, and Asian-Pacific Islander ethnicities also reveal a trend wherein higher
intraethnic community overlap (Fig 2B) parallels higher numbers of ubiquitous OTUs (Fig
2C), higher Shannon alpha diversity (Fig 2A), and higher stability of ubiquitous OTUs as measured by the A/U ratio (Fig 2C).
We next assess whether a single ethnicity disproportionately impacts total gut microbiota
distinguishability in the AGP by comparing ANOSIM results from the consensus beta diversity distance matrix when each ethnicity is sequentially removed from the analysis (Fig 3A and
S2E Table). Distinguishability remains unchanged when the few African Americans are
removed but is lost upon removal of Asian-Pacific Islanders or Caucasians, likely reflecting
their higher beta diversity distance from other ethnicities (Fig 3A). Notably, removal of Hispanics increases distinguishability among the remaining ethnicities, which may be due to a
higher degree of beta diversity overlap observed between Hispanics and other ethnicities (S4B
Table). Results conform across rarefaction depths and beta diversity metrics (S2F Table), and
pairwise combinations show strong distinguishability between African Americans and Hispanics (ANOSIM, R = 0.234, p = 0.005) and Asian-Pacific Islanders and Caucasians (ANOSIM, R = 0.157, p < 0.001).
Finally, to complement evaluation with ecological alpha and beta diversity, we implement a
random forest (RF) supervised learning algorithm to classify gut microbiota from genus-level
community profiles into their respective ethnicity. We build four one-versus-all binary classifiers to classify samples from each ethnicity compared to the rest and use two different sampling
approaches to train the models synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) [33] and
downsampling for overcoming uneven representation of ethnicities in both the data sets (see
Materials and methods). Given that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve (or AUC) of a random guessing classifier is 0.5, the models classify each ethnicity fairly
well (Fig 3B), with average AUCs across sampling techniques and data sets of 0.78 for AsianPacific Islanders, 0.76 for African Americans, 0.69 for Hispanics, and 0.70 for Caucasians. Ethnicity distinguishing RF taxa and out-of-bag error percentages appear in (S2 Fig).
Recurrent taxon associations with ethnicity
Subtle to moderate ethnicity-associated differences in microbial communities may in part be
driven by differential abundance of certain microbial taxa. 16.2% (130/802) of the AGP taxa
and 20.6% (45/218) of HMP taxa across all classification levels (i.e., phylum to genus, S5 Table)
significantly vary in abundance across ethnicities (Kruskal–Wallis, pFDR < 0.05). Between data
sets, 19.2% (25/130) of the AGP and 55.6% (25/45) of the HMP varying taxa replicate in the
other data set, representing a significantly greater degree of overlap than would be expected by
chance (ethnic permutation analysis of overlap, p < 0.001 each taxonomic level and all taxonomic levels combined). The highest replication of taxa varying by abundance occurs with
22.0% of families (nine significant in both data sets / 41 significantly varying families in either

data set), followed by genus with 13.4% (nine significant in both data sets / 67 significantly
varying genera in either data set).
Among 18 reproducible taxa, we categorize 12 as taxonomically distinct (Fig 4) and exclude
six in which nearly identical abundance profiles between family/genus taxonomy overlap.
Comparing relative abundance differences between pairs of ethnicities for these 12 taxa in the
AGP reveals 30 significant differences, of which 20 replicate in the HMP (p < 0.05, Mann–
Whitney U). Intriguingly, all reproducible pairwise differences are a result of decreases in
Asian-Pacific Islanders (Fig 4). We also test taxon abundance and presence/absence associations with ethnicity separately in the AGP using linear and logistic regression models, respectively, and we repeat the analysis while incorporating categorical sex and continuous age and
BMI as covariates (S6 Table). Clustering microbial families based on their abundance correlation reveals two co-occurrence clusters: (i) a distinct cluster of six Firmicutes and Tenericutes

families in the HMP and (ii) an overlapping but more diverse cluster of 20 families in the AGP
(S3 Fig). Nine of the 12 taxa found to recurrently vary in abundance across ethnicities are represented in these clusters (Fig 4), with four appearing in both clusters and the other five
appearing either in or closely correlated with members of both clusters (S3 Fig). Furthermore,
90% (18/20) of families in the AGP cluster and 66% (4/6) of taxa in the HMP cluster significantly vary in abundance across ethnicities. We also found overlap for AGP and HMP data
sets between taxa significantly varying in abundance across ethnicities (with false discovery
rate [FDR] < 0.05) and taxa in RF models with percentage importance greater than 50% for an
ethnicity (S2B Fig). Taken together, these results establish general overlap of the most significant ethnicity-associated taxa between these methods, reproducibility of microbial abundances
that vary between ethnicities across data sets, and patterns of co-occurrence among these taxa,
which could suggest they are functionally linked.
Most heritable taxon of bacteria varies by ethnicity
Identified as the most heritable taxon in the human gut [34, 35], the family Christensenellaceae
exhibits the second strongest significant difference in abundance across ethnicities in both
Fig 4. Ethnicity-associated taxa match between the HMP and AGP. Bar plots depict the log10 transformed relative abundance for individuals possessing the respective
taxon within each ethnicity, ubiquity appears above (AGP) or below (HMP) bars, and the 25th and 75th percentiles are shown with extending whiskers. Mann–Whitney
U tests evaluate differences in abundance and ubiquity for all individuals between pairs of ethnicities; for example, the direction of change in Victivallaceae is driven by
ubiquity while abundance is higher for those possessing the taxon. Significance values are Bonferroni corrected for the six tests within each taxon and data set, and bold
p-values indicate that significance (p < 0.05) and direction of change replicate in the AGP and HMP. Data available at https://github.com/awbrooks19/microbiota_and_

AGP and HMP data sets (S5 Table, Family: AGP, Kruskal–Wallis, pFDR = 1.55e-9; HMP, Kruskal–Wallis, pFDR = 0.0019). Additionally, Christensenellaceae is variable by sex and BMI (AGP:
Sex, Kruskal–Wallis, pFDR = 1.22e-12; BMI, Kruskal–Wallis, pFDR = 0.0020) and represents
some of the strongest pairwise correlations with other taxa in both co-occurrence clusters (S3
Fig). There is at least an eight-fold and two-fold reduction in average Christensenellaceae
abundance in Asian-Pacific Islanders relative to the other ethnicities in the AGP and HMP,
respectively (S5 Table), and significance of all pairwise comparisons in both data sets show
reduced abundance in Asian-Pacific Islanders (Fig 4). Christensenellaceae also occurs among
the top 10 most influential taxa for distinguishing Asian-Pacific Islanders from other ethnicities using RF models for both AGP and HMP data sets (S2A Fig). Abundance in individuals
possessing Christensenellaceae and presence/absence across all individuals significantly associate with ethnicity (S6 Table, Abundance, Linear Regression, pBonferroni = 0.006; Presence/
Absence, Logistic Regression, pBonferroni = 8.802e-6), but there was only a slight correlation
between the taxon’s relative abundance and BMI (S4 Fig). Confirming previous associations
with lower BMI [36], we observe that AGP individuals with Christensenellaceae also have a
lower BMI (Mean BMI, 23.7 ± 4.3) than individuals without it (Mean BMI, 25.0 ± 5.9; Mann–
Whitney U, p < 0.001). This pattern is separately reflected in African Americans, Asian-Pacific
Islanders, and Caucasians but not Hispanics (Fig 5), suggesting that each ethnicity may have
different equilibria between the taxon’s abundance and body weight.
Genetic- and ethnicity-associated taxa overlap
Many factors associate with human ethnicity, including a small subset of population specific
genetic variants (estimated approximately 0.5% genome wide) that vary by biogeographical
ancestry [37, 38]; self-declared ethnicity in the HMP is delineated by population genetic structure [20]. Here, we investigate whether ethnicity-associated taxa overlap with (i) taxa that have
a significant population genetic heritability in humans [34, 35, 39, 40] and (ii) taxa linked with
human genetic variants in two large Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)-microbiota
analyses [35, 40]. All recurrent ethnicity-associated taxa except one were heritable in at least
one study, with seven replicating in three or more studies (Table 1). Likewise, abundance differences in seven recurrent ethnicity-associated taxa demonstrate significant GWAS associations with at least one variant in the human genome. Therefore, we assess whether any genetic
variants associated with differences in microbial abundance exhibit significant rates of differentiation (fixation index [FST]) between 1,000 genome superpopulations [38]. Out of 49 variants associated with ethnically varying taxa, 21 have higher FST values between at least one pair
of populations than that of 95% of other variants on the same chromosome and across the
genome; the FST values of five variants associated with Clostridiaceae abundance rank above
the top 99% (S7 Table). Since taxa that vary across ethnicities exhibit lower abundance in
Asian-Pacific Islanders, it is notable that the FST values of 18 and 11 variant comparisons for
East Asian and South Asian populations, respectively, are above that of the 95% rate of differentiation threshold from African, American, or European populations. Cautiously, the microbiota and 1,000 genomes data sets are not drawn from the same individuals, and disentangling
the role of genetic from social and environmental factors will still require more controlled
studies.
Discussion
Many common diseases associate with microbiota composition and ethnicity, raising the central hypothesis that microbiota differences between ethnicities can occasionally serve as a
mediator of health disparities. Self-declared ethnicity in the US can capture socioeconomic,

cultural, geographic, dietary, and genetic diversity, and a similarly complex array of interindividual and environmental factors influence total microbiota composition. This complexity
may result in challenges when attempting to recover consistent trends in total gut microbiota
differences between ethnicities. The challenges in turn emphasize the importance of reproducibility, both through confirmation across analytical methods and replication across study populations [15–17, 20, 27, 42]. In order to robustly substantiate the ethnicity–microbiota
hypothesis, we evaluated recurrent associations between self-declared ethnicity and variation
in both total gut microbiota and specific taxa in healthy individuals. Results provide hypotheses for examining specific members of the gut microbiota as mediators of health disparities.
Our findings from two American data sets demonstrate that (i) ethnicity consistently captures gut microbiota with a slightly stronger effect size than other variables such as BMI, age,
and sex; (ii) ethnicity is moderately predictable from total gut microbiota differences; and (iii)
12 taxa recurrently vary in abundance between the ethnicities, of which the majority have been
previously shown to be heritable and associated with human genetic variation. Whether
shaped through socioeconomic, dietary, healthcare, genetic, or other ethnicity-related factors,
reproducibly varying taxa represent sources for novel hypotheses addressing health disparities.

producers in the gut, and they have been negatively associated to severe forms of Crohns disease and Ulcerative Colitis in association with reduced butyrate metabolism [43–45]. AsianPacific Islanders possess significantly less Odoribacteriaceae and Odoribacter than Hispanics
and Caucasians in both data sets, and severity of Ulcerative Colitis upon hospital admission
has been shown to be significantly higher in Asian Americans [46]. Considering broader physiological roles, several ethnicity-associated taxa are primary gut anaerobic fermenters and
methanogens [47, 48] and associate with lower BMI and blood triglyceride levels [36, 49].
Indeed, Christensenellaceae, Odoribacteriaceae, Odoribacter, and the class Mollicutes containing RF39 negatively associate with metabolic syndrome and demonstrate significant population genetic heritability in twins [39]. Implications for health outcomes warrant further
investigation but could be reflected by positive correlations of Odoribacteriaceae, Odoribacter,
Coriobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, and the dominant Verrucomicrobiaceae lineage
Akkermansia with old age [50, 51]. Akkermansia associations with health and ethnicity in
Western populations may reflect recently arising dietary and lifestyle effects on community
composition, as this mucus-consuming taxon is rarely observed in more traditional cultures
globally [23]. Moreover, these findings raise the importance of controlling for ethnicity in
studies linking microbiota differences to disease because associations between specific
microbes and a disease could be confounded by ethnicity of the study participants.
Based on correlations in individual taxon’s abundance, a similar pattern of co-occurrence
previously identified as the “Christensenellaceae Consortium” includes 11 of the 12 recurrent
ethnically varying taxa [34], and members of this consortium associate with genetic variation in
the human formate oxidation gene, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member 1 (ALDH1L1),
which is a genetic risk factor for stroke [35, 52, 53]. Formate metabolism is a key step in the
pathway reducing carbon dioxide to methane [54, 55], and increased methane associates with
increased Rikenellaceae, Christensenellaceae, Odoribacteriaceae, and Odoribacter [56]. Products
of methanogenic fermentation pathways include short chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which,
through reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, is linked to cancer cell apoptosis and reduced
risk of colorectal cancer [57, 58]. Asian Americans are the only ethnic group where cancer

surpasses heart disease as the leading cause of death, and over 70% of Asian Americans were
born overseas, which can affect assimilation into Western lifestyles, leading to reduced access to
healthcare and screening and proper medical education [57, 59–61]. Preliminary results from
other groups suggest that the gut microbiome of Southeast Asian immigrants changes after
migration to the US [62]. Indeed, as countries in Asia shift toward a more Western lifestyle, the
incidence of cancers, particularly gastrointestinal and colorectal cancers, are increasing rapidly,
possibly indicating incompatibilities between traditionally harbored microbiota and Western
lifestyles [63–66]. Asian Americans have higher rates of type 2 diabetes and pathogenic infections than Caucasians [67], and two metagenomic functions enriched in control versus type 2
diabetes cases appear to be largely conferred by cluster-associated butyrate-producing and
motility-inducing Verrucomicrobiaceae and Clostridia taxa reduced in abundance among AGP
and HMP Asian-Pacific Islanders [11]. Both induction of cell motility and butyrate promotion
of mucin integrity can protect against pathogenic colonization and associate with microbial
community changes [11, 58, 68]. Levels of cell motility and butyrate are key factors suspected to
underlie a range of health disparities including inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and type 2
diabetes [11, 69–71]. Patterns of ethnically varying taxa across ethnicities could result from
many factors including varying diets, environmental exposures, sociocultural influences,
human genetic variation, and others. However, regardless of the mechanisms dictating assembly, these results suggest that there is a reproducible, co-occurring group of taxa linked by similar metabolic processes known to promote homeostasis.
The utility of this work is establishing a framework for studying ethnicity-associated taxa
and hypotheses of how changes in abundance or presence of these taxa may or may not shape
health disparities, many of which also have genetic components. Differing in allele frequency
across three population comparisons and associated with the abundance of Clostridiales, the
genetic variant rs7587067 has a significantly higher frequency in African (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.802) versus East Asian (MAF = 0.190, FST = 0.54, Chromosome = 98.7%,
Genome-Wide = 98.9%), admixed American (MAF = 0.278, FST = 0.44, Chromosome = 99.0%,
Genome-Wide = 99.1%), and European populations (MAF = 0.267, FST = 0.45, Chromosome = 98.7.3%, Genome-Wide = 98.7%). This intronic variant for the gene HECW2 is a
known expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) (GTEx, eQTL Effect Size = -0.18, p = 7.4e-5)
[72, 73], and HECW2 encodes a ubiquitin ligase linked to enteric gastrointestinal nervous system function through maintenance of endothelial lining of blood vessels [74, 75]. Knockout of
HECW2 in mice reduced enteric neuron networks and gut motility, and patients with Hirschsprungs disease have diminished localization of HECW2 to regions affected by loss of neurons
and colon blockage when compared to other regions of their own colon and healthy individuals [76]. Hirschsprungs disease presenting as full colon blockage is rare and has not undergone
targeted examination as a health disparity; however, a possible hypothesis is that lower penetrance of the disease in individuals with the risk allele at rs7587067 could lead to subtler effects
on gut motility resulting in Clostridiales abundance differences.
Despite the intrigue of connecting the human genome, microbiota, and disease phenotypes,
evaluating such hypotheses will require more holistic approaches including incorporating
metagenomics and metabolomics to identify whether enzymes or metabolic functions reproducibly vary across ethnicities, as well as direct functional studies in model systems to understand if correlation is truly driven by causation. Further limitations should also be considered,
including recruitment biases for the AGP versus HMP, variation in sample processing and
OTU clustering, and uneven sampling, which could only be addressed with downsampling of
over-represented ethnicities. Still, despite these confounders, care was taken to demonstrate
the reproducibility of results across statistical methods, ecological metrics, rarefaction depths,
and study populations. Summarily, this work suggests that abundance differences of specific

taxa, rather than whole communities, may represent the most reliable ethnic signatures in the
gut microbiota. A reproducible co-occurring subset of these taxa link to a variety of overlapping metabolic processes and health disparities and contain the most reproducibly heritable
taxon, Christensenellaceae. Moreover, a majority of the microbial taxa associated with ethnicity are also heritable and genetically associated taxa, suggesting that there is a possible connection between ethnicity and genetic patterns of biogeographical ancestry that may play a role in
shaping these taxa. Our results emphasize the importance of sampling ethnically diverse populations of healthy individuals in order to discover and replicate ethnicity signatures in the
human gut microbiota, and they highlight a need to account for ethnic variation as a potential
confounding factor in studies linking microbiota differences to disease. Further reinforcement
of these results may lead to generalizations about microbiota assembly and even consideration
of specific taxa as potential mediators or treatments of health disparities.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
Access to HMP data was obtained through dbGaP approval granted to SRB and AWB. Institutional Review Board approval was granted with nonhuman subjects determination IRB161231
by Vanderbilt University.
Data acquisition
AGP data was obtained from the project FTP repository located at ftp://ftp.microbio.me/
AmericanGut/. AGP data generation and processing prior to analysis can be found at https://
github.com/biocore/American-Gut/tree/master/ipynb/primary-processing. All analyses utilized the rounds-1–25 data set, which was released on March 4, 2016. Throughout all analyses,
QIIME v1.9.0 was used in an Anaconda environment (https://continuum.io) for all script
calls, and custom scripts and notebooks were run in the QIIME 2 Anaconda environment
with python version 3.5.2, and plots were postprocessed using Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/
en/) [77]. Ethnicity used in this study was self-declared by AGP study participants as one of
four groups: African American, Asian or Pacific Islander (Asian-Pacific Islander), Caucasian,
or Hispanic. Sex was self-declared as either male, female, or other. Age was self-declared as a
continuous integer of years old, and age categories defined by the AGP by decade (i.e., 20’s,
30’s, etc.) were used in this study. BMI was self-declared as an integer, and BMI categories
defined by AGP of underweight, healthy, overweight, and obese were utilized. A total of 31 categorical metadata factors were assessed for structuring across ethnicities with a two proportion
Z test between pairs of ethnicities using a custom python script (S1 Table additional sheets).
The p-values were Bonferroni corrected within each metadata factor for the number of pairwise ethnic comparisons. 97% OTUs generated for each data set are utilized throughout to
maintain consistency with other published literature; however, microbial taxonomy of the
HMP is reassigned using the Greengenes reference database [78]. Communities characterized
with 16S rDNA sequencing of variable region four followed an identical processing pipeline
for all samples, which was developed and optimized for the Earth Microbiome Project [79].
HMP 16S rDNA data processed using QIIME for variable regions 3–5 was obtained from
http://hmpdacc.org/HMQCP/. Demographic information for individual HMP participants
was obtained through dbGaP restricted access to study phs000228.v2.p1, with dbGaP approval
granted to SRB and nonhuman subjects determination IRB161231 granted by Vanderbilt University. Ethnicity and sex were assigned to subjects based on self-declared values, with individuals selecting multiple ethnicities being removed unless they primarily responded as Hispanic,
while categorical age and BMI were established from continuous values using the same criteria

for assignment as in the AGP. The HMP Amerindian population was removed due to severe
under-representation. This filtered HMP table was used for community level analyses (ANOSIM, alpha diversity, beta intra-inter); however, to allow comparison with the AGP data set,
community subset analyses (co-occurrence, abundance correlation, etc.) were performed with
taxonomic assignments in QIIME using the UCLUST method with the GreenGenes_13_5
reference.
Quality control
AGP quality control was performed in Stata v12 (StataCorp, 2011) using available metadata to
remove samples (Raw N = 9,475) with BMI more than 60 (−988 [8,487]) or less than 10 (−68
[8,419]); missing age (−661 [7,758]), with age greater than 55 years old (−2,777 [4,981]) or less
than 18 years old (−582 [4,399]); and blank samples or those not appearing in the mapping file
(−482 [3,917]), with unknown ethnicity or declared as other (−131 [3786]), not declared as a
fecal origin (−2,002 [1784]), with unknown sex or declared as other (−98 [1686]) or located
outside of the US (−209 [1477]). No HMP individuals were missing key metadata or had other
reasons for exclusion (−0[298]). Final community quality control for both the AGP and HMP
was performed by filtering OTUs with less than 10 sequences and removing samples with less
than 1,000 sequences (AGP, −102 [1375]; HMP, −0 [298]). All analyses used 97% OTUs generated by the AGP or HMP, and unless otherwise noted, results represent Bray–Curtis beta
diversity and Shannon alpha diversity at a rarefaction depth of 1,000 counts per sample.
ANOSIM, PERMANOVA, and BioEnv distinguishability
The ANOSIM test was performed with 9,999 repetitions on each rarefied table within a respective rarefaction depth and beta diversity metric (Fig 1 and S2A–S2B Table), with R values and
p-values averaged across the rarefactions. Consensus beta diversity matrices were calculated as
the average distances across the 100 rarefied matrices for each beta diversity metric and depth.
Consensus distance matrices were randomly subsampled 10 times for subset number of individuals from each ethnic group with more than that subset number prior to ANOSIM analysis
with 9,999 repetitions, and the results were averaged evaluating the effects of more even representations for each ethnicity (S2C Table). Consensus distance matrices had each ethnicity and
pair of ethnicities removed prior to ANOSIM analysis with 9,999 repetitions, evaluating the
distinguishability conferred by inclusion of each ethnicity (Fig 3A, S2F Table). Significance
was not corrected for the number of tests to allow comparisons between results of different
analyses, metrics, and depths. PERMANOVA analyses were run using the R language implementation in the Vegan package [80], with data handled in a custom R script using the Phyloseq package [81]. Categorical variables were used to evaluate the PERMANOVA equation
(Beta Diversity Distance Matrix ~ Ethnicity + Age + Sex + BMI) using 999 permutations to
evaluate significance, and the R and p-values were averaged across 10 rarefactions (S2D
Table). The BioEnv test, or BEST test, was adapted to allow evaluation of the correlation and
significance between beta diversity distance matrices and age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity simultaneously (S2E Table) [29]. At each rarefaction depth and beta diversity metric, the consensus
distance matrix was evaluated for its correlation with the centered and scaled Euclidian distance matrix of individuals continuous age and BMI, and categorical ethnicity and sex encoded
using patsy (same methodology as original test) (https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). The
test was adapted to calculate significance for a variable of interest by comparing how often the
degree of correlation with all metadata variables (age, sex, BMI, ethnicity) was higher than the
correlation when the variable of interest was randomly shuffled between samples 1,000 times.

Alpha diversity
Alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Equitability, Chao1, Observed OTUs) were computed for each rarefied table (QIIME: alpha_diversity.py), and results were collated and averaged for each sample across the tables (QIIME: collate_alpha.py). Pairwise nonparametric t
tests using Monte Carlo permutations evaluated alpha diversity differences between the ethnicities with Bonferroni correction for the number of comparisons (Fig 2A, S3 Table, QIIME:
compare_alpha_diversity.py). A Kruskal–Wallis test implemented in python was used to
detect significant differences across all ethnicities.
Beta diversity
Each consensus beta diversity distance matrix had distances organized based on whether they
represented individuals of the same ethnic group or were between individuals of different ethnic groups. All values indicate that all pairwise distances between all individuals were used (Fig
2B, S4A and S4B Table), and mean values indicate that for each individual, their average distance to all individuals in the comparison group was used as a single point to assess pseudoinflation (S4C and S4D Table). A Kruskal–Wallis test was used to calculate significant differences in intraethnic distances across all ethnicities. Pairwise Mann–Whitney U tests were calculated between each pair of intraethnic distance comparisons, along with intra-versusinterethnic distance comparisons. Significance was Bonferroni corrected within the number of
intra-intraethnic and intra-interethnic distance groups compared, with violin plots of intraand interethnic beta diversity distances generated for each comparison.
Random forest
RF models were implemented using taxa summarized at the genus level, which performed better compared to RF models using OTUs as features, both in terms of classification accuracy
and computational time. We first rarefied OTU tables at a sequence depth of 10,000 (using R
v3.3.3 package vegan’s rrarefy() function) and then summarized rarefied OTUs at the genus
level (or a higher characterized level if genus was uncharacterized for an OTU). We filtered for
rare taxa by removing taxa present in fewer than half of the number of samples in rarest ethnicity (i.e., fewer than 10/2 = 5 samples in HMP and 13/2 = 6 [rounded down] in AGP), retaining 85 distinct taxa in the HMP data set and 322 distinct taxa in the AGP data set at the genus
level. The resulting taxa were normalized to relative abundance and arcsin-sqrt transformed
before being used as features for the RF models. We initially built a multiclass RF model, but
since the RF model is highly sensitive to the uneven representation of classes, all samples were
identified as the majority class, i.e., Caucasian. In order to even out the class imbalance, we
considered some sampling approaches, but most existing techniques for improving classification performance on imbalanced data sets are designed for binary class imbalanced data sets
and are not effective on data sets with multiple under-represented classes. Hence, we adopted
the binary classification approach and built four one-versus-all binary RF classifiers to classify
samples from each ethnicity compared to the rest. 10-fold cross-validation (using R package
caret [82]) was performed using ROC as the metric for selecting the optimal model. The performance metrics and ROC curves were averaged across the 10 folds (Fig 3B). Without any
sampling during training the classifiers, most samples were identified as the majority class, i.e.,
Caucasian, by all four one-versus-all RF classifiers. In order to overcome this imbalance in
class representation, we applied two sampling techniques inside cross-validation: i) downsampling and ii) SMOTE [33]. In the downsampling approach, the majority class is downsampled
by random removal of instances from the majority class. In the SMOTE approach, the majority
class is downsampled, and synthetic samples from the minority class are generated based on
Gut microbiota diversity across ethnicities in the United States

the k-nearest neighbors technique [33]. Note, the sampling was performed inside cross-validation on training set, while the test was performed on unbalanced held-out test set in each fold.
In comparison to a no-sampling approach, which classified most samples as the majority class,
i.e., Caucasians, our sampling-based approach leads to improved sensitivity for classification
of minority classes on unbalanced test sets. Nevertheless, the most accurate prediction remains
for the inclusion in the majority class. The ROC curves and performance metrics table in Fig
3B show the sensitivity–specificity tradeoff and classification performance for one-versus-all
classifier for each ethnicity for both the sampling techniques applied on both of the data sets.
For both of the data sets, downsampling shows higher sensitivity and lower specificity and precision for minority classes (i.e., African Americans, Asian-Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics)
compared to SMOTE. However, for the majority class (i.e., Caucasian), downsampling lowers
the sensitivity and increases the specificity and precision compared to SMOTE. The sensitivity–specificity tradeoff, denoted by the AUC, is reduced for Hispanics in both the data sets.
The most important taxa with >50% importance for predicting an ethnicity using RF model
with SMOTE sampling approach are shown in S2A Fig. Among the 10 most important taxa
for each ethnicity, there are nine taxa that overlap between the AGP and HMP data sets
(highlighted by the blue rectangular box); however, which ethnicity, they best distinguish varies between the two data sets. Within each data set we highlighted taxa that are distinguishing
in RF models and have distinguishing differential abundance in S2B Fig, reporting both the
FDR corrected significance for Kruskal–Wallis tests of differential abundance, and the percent
importance for the most distinguished ethnicity of each in RF models. We also report out-ofbag errors for the final RF classifier that was built using the optimal model parameters
obtained from cross-validation approach corresponding to each ethnicity and sampling procedure for both AGP and HMP data sets in S2C Fig.
Taxon associations
Taxon differential abundance across categorical metadata groups was performed in QIIME
(QIIME: group_significance.py, S5 Table) to examine whether observation counts (i.e., OTUs
and microbial taxon) are significantly different between groups within a metadata category
(i.e., ethnicity, sex, BMI, and age). The OTU table prior to final community quality control
was collapsed at each taxonomic level (i.e., Phylum–Genus; QIIME: collapse_taxonomy.py),
with counts representing the relative abundance of each microbial taxon. Differences in the
mean abundance of taxa between ethnicities were calculated using Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric statistical tests. p-values are provided alongside false discovery rate and Bonferroni corrected p-values, and taxon were ranked from most to least significant. Results were collated
into excel tables by taxonomic level and metadata category being examined, with significant
(FDR and Bonferroni p-value < 0.05) highlighted in orange, and taxa that were false discovery
rate significant in both data sets were colored red. The Fisher’s exact test for the overlap of
number of significant taxa between data sets was run at the online portal (http://vassarstats.
net/tab2x2.html), with the expected overlap calculated as 5% of the number of significant taxa
at all levels within the respective data set, and the observed 25 taxa that overlapped in our analysis. The permutation analysis was performed by comparing the number of significant taxa (S5
Table, pFDR < 0.05) overlapping between the AGP and HMP to the number overlapping when
the Kruskal–Wallis test was performed 1,000 times with ethnicity randomly permuted. In 1/
1,000 runs, there was one significant taxon overlapping at the family level and one in 3/1,000
permutations at the genus level, with no significant taxa overlapping in any repetitions at
higher taxonomic levels. The 12 families and genera that were significantly different were evaluated to not be taxonomically distinct if their abundances across ethnicities at each level
Gut microbiota diversity across ethnicities in the United States

represented at least 82%–100% (nearly all >95%) of the overlapping taxonomic level, and the
genera was used if classified and family level used if genera was unclassified (g__). Average relative abundances on a log10 scale among individuals possessing the taxon were extracted for
each taxon within each ethnicity, and the abundance for 12 families and genera were made
into bar chart figures (Fig 4). The external whisker (AGP above, HMP below) depicts the 75th
percentile of abundance, and the internal whisker depicts the 25th percentile. Pairwise Mann–
Whitney U tests were performed between each pair of ethnicities using microbial abundances
among all individuals and were Bonferroni corrected for the six comparisons within each
taxon and data set. Bonferroni significant p-values are shown in the figure and shown in bold
if significance and direction of change replicate in both data sets. Ubiquity shown above or
below each bar was calculated as the number of individuals in which that taxon was detected
within the respective ethnicity. Additional confirmation of ethnically varying abundance was
also performed at each taxonomic level (S6 Table), at which the correlation of continuous age
and BMI along with categorically coded sex and ethnicity were simultaneously measured
against the log10 transformed relative abundance of each taxon among individuals possessing
it using linear regression (S6 Table, Abundance) and against the presence or absence of the
taxon in all individuals with logistic regression (S6 Table, Presence Absence). Significance is
presented for the models each with ethnicity alone and with all metadata factors included (age,
sex, BMI), alongside Bonferroni corrected p-values and individual effects of each metadata
factor.
Co-occurrence analysis
Bacterial taxonomy was collapsed at the family level, Spearman correlation was calculated
between each pair of families using SciPy [83], cluster maps were generated using seaborn (S3
Fig), and ethnic associations were drawn from S5 Table. Correlations were masked where Bonferroni corrected Spearman p-values were >0.05, and clusters were identified as the most
prominent (strongest correlations) and abundance enriched. Enrichment of ethnic association
was evaluated by measuring the Mann–Whitney U of cluster families’ ethnic associations (pvalues, S5 Table) compared to the ethnic associations of noncluster taxa. Cluster-associated
families were identified as having at least three significant correlations with families within the
cluster.
Christensenellaceae analysis
The abundance of the family Christensenellaceae was input as relative abundance across all
individuals from the family level taxonomic table. Individuals were subset based on the presence/absence of Christensenellaceae, and BMIs were compared using a one-tailed Mann–
Whitney U test, then each was further subset by ethnicity and BMI compared using one-tailed
Mann–Whitney U tests and boxplots within each ethnicity (Fig 5).
Genetically associated, heritable, and correlated taxa analysis
Genetically associated taxa from population heritability studies [34, 35, 39, 40] with a minimum heritability (A in ACE models or H2r) >0.1 and from GWAS studies [35, 40] were
examined for exact taxonomic overlap with our 12 ethnically-associated taxa. The 42 genetic
variants associated with Unclassified Clostridiales are rs16845116, rs586749, rs7527642,
rs10221827, rs5754822, rs4968435, rs17170765, rs1760889, rs6933411, rs2830259, rs7318523,

along with variants in Table 1 except for chr7:96414393 (total = 49) were then assessed in
1,000 Genomes individuals for significant differentiation across superpopulations [38]. The
1,000 Genomes VCF files were downloaded (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/
20130502/), and variants with a minor allele frequency less than 0.01 were removed, with FST
calculated between each pair of superpopulations using vcftools [84]. The East Asian versus
South Asian FST rates were not used in the analysis. A custom script was used to examine the
FST for each of the 49 variants and was compared to the FST of all variants on the same chromosome and all variants genome-wide for that pair of populations, with percentile calculated
and the number of variants with a higher FST divided by the total number of variants. The
eQTL value and significance for rs7587067 were drawn from the GTEx database [73].

S2 Fig. Summary of RF distinguishing taxa and out-of-bag error for each ethnicity. (A)
Importance of taxa for predicting each ethnicity using RF models with SMOTE sampling
approach are shown as percentage contributions, highlighted by color for each ethnicity.
Among the 10 most important taxa for each ethnicity, nine overlap between the AGP and
HMP data sets (highlighted by the blue rectangular box); however, which ethnicity they best
distinguish varies between the two data sets. (B) Taxa that are distinguishing in RF models and
have distinguishing differential abundance in S5 Table. The FDR corrected significance for
Kruskal–Wallis tests of differential abundance and the percent importance for the most distinguished ethnicity of each in RF models are shown. (C) Out-of-bag error percentages for the
final RF classifier that was built using the optimal model parameters obtained from cross-validation approach corresponding to each ethnicity and sampling procedure for both AGP and
HMP data sets. AGP, American Gut Project; FDR, false discovery rate; HMP, Human Microbiome Project; RF, random forest; SMOTE, synthetic minority oversampling technique

S3 Fig. Abundance correlation of microbial families. Spearman correlation cluster maps of
bacterial abundance for families in the AGP and HMP. Numbers within boxes depict the
spearman correlation value with heatmap coloration from blue negative correlation (−1),
white no correlation (0), to red positive correlation (1). Positions have been masked based on
Bonferroni significance <0.05 for the total cluster map of all microbial families. Taxa within
boxes were identified as a highly correlated cluster, and taxa outside the boxes share multiple
correlations with those within the cluster. Blue taxonomic names indicate overlap of taxa
within boxes of both the AGP and HMP, while black indicate multiple correlations with the
clusters in both data sets. The ethnic association column depicts FDR corrected p-values from
Kruskal–Wallis tests in S5 Table, which are bolded if <0.05. AGP, American Gut Project;
