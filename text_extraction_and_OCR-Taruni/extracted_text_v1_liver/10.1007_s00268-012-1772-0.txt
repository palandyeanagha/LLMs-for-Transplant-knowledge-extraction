Abstract
Background This review aims to present a consensus for
optimal perioperative care in colonic surgery and to provide graded recommendations for items for an evidencedbased enhanced perioperative protocol.
Methods Studies were selected with particular attention
paid to meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials and
large prospective cohorts. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English-language
literature was examined, reviewed and graded. A consensus
recommendation was reached after critical appraisal of the
literature by the group.
Results For most of the protocol items, recommendations
are based on good-quality trials or meta-analyses of goodquality trials (quality of evidence and recommendations
according to the GRADE system).
Conclusions Based on the evidence available for each
item of the multimodal perioperative care pathway, the
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society, International Association for Surgical Metabolism and Nutrition
(IASMEN) and European Society for Clinical Nutrition
and Metabolism (ESPEN) present a comprehensive evidence-based consensus review of perioperative care for
colonic surgery.

evidence-based treatments covering the entire perioperative period and formulated into a standardised protocol.
Compared with traditional management, Enhanced
Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) represents a fundamental shift in perioperative care [1–4]. The ERAS care pathways reduce surgical stress, maintain postoperative
physiological function, and enhance mobilisation after
surgery. This has resulted in reduced rates of morbidity,
faster recovery and shorter length of stay in hospital
(LOSH) in case series from dedicated centres [1–4] and in
randomised trials [5, 6].
Several versions of Enhanced Recovery Programmes
have been published over the years [7–9].
This article represents the joint efforts of the ERAS
Society (www.erassociety.org), International Association
for Surgical Metabolism and Nutrition (IASMEN;
www.iasmen.org) and the European Society for Clinical
Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) to present an updated
and expanded consensus review of perioperative care for
colonic surgery based on current evidence.
Methods
Literature search
The authors met in April 2011 and the topics for inclusion
were agreed and allocated. The principal literature search
utilised MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases to
identify relevant contributions published between January
1966 and January 2012. Medical Subject Headings terms
were used, as were accompanying entry terms for the
patient group, interventions and outcomes. Key words
included ‘‘colon’’, ‘‘enhanced recovery’’ and ‘‘fast track’’.
Reference lists of all eligible articles were checked for
other relevant studies. Conference proceedings were not
searched. Expert contributions came from within the ERAS
Society Working Party on Systematic Reviews.
Study selection
Titles and abstracts were screened by individual reviewers
to identify potentially relevant articles. Discrepancies in
judgement were resolved by the senior author and during
committee meetings of the ERAS Society Working Party
on Systematic Reviews. Reviews, case series, non-randomised studies, randomised control studies, meta-analyses
and systematic reviews were considered for each individual
topic.
Quality assessment and data analyses
The methodological quality of the included studies was
assessed using the Cochrane checklist [10]. The strength of
evidence and conclusions were assessed and agreed by all
authors in May 2012. Quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) system [11–13]. Quoting from the GRADE
guidelines [13], the recommendations are given as follows:
‘‘Strong recommendations indicate that the panel is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects’’. ‘‘Weak
recommendations indicate that the desirable effects of
adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the
undesirable effects, but the panel is less confident’’. Recommendations are based on quality of evidence (‘‘high’’,
‘‘moderate’’, ‘‘low’’ and ‘‘very low’’) but also on the balance
between desirable and undesirable effects; and on values and
preferences [13]. The latter implies that, in some cases,

strong recommendations may be reached from low-quality
data and vice versa.
Evidence base and recommendations
ERAS items
Preadmission information, education and counseling
Detailed information given to patients before the procedure
about surgical and anaesthetic procedures may diminish fear
and anxiety and enhance postoperative recovery and quicken
hospital discharge [14, 15]. A preoperative psychological
intervention, aimed at decreasing patient anxiety, may also
improve wound healing and recovery after laparoscopic
surgery [16, 17]. Personal counseling, leaflets or multimedia
information containing explanations of the procedure along
with tasks that the patient should be encouraged to fulfil may
improve perioperative feeding, early postoperative mobilisation, pain control, and respiratory physiotherapy; and
hence reduce the prevalence of complications [18–20]. Ideally, the patient and a relative/care provider should meet with
surgeon, anaesthetist and nurse.
Summary and recommendation:
Patients should routinely receive dedicated preoperative counseling (can only be beneficial and not
harmful)
Evidence level:
Low (study quality, uncertain endpoints)
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Preoperative optimisation
Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been
undertaken in various settings investigating the role of
preoperative physical conditioning (Prehab) on surgical
outcomes [21–27]. The surgical settings were general
abdominal surgery, cardiothoracic surgery and orthopaedic
surgery. Although there were varying degrees of
improvement in physiological function and surgical
recovery, only 1 study found improvement in physiological
function that correlated with improved surgical recovery
[25]. These results may have been influenced by: a lack of
appropriate physiological endpoints; studies being conducted within elderly cohorts; excessively intensive exercise regimens; and lack of adherence to the designated
programmes. Further research is needed by investigating
Prehab in younger patient populations. There is also a need
for further research into methods that can improve adherence to Prehab.
It is generally accepted that preoperative medical optimisation is necessary before surgery. Alcohol abusers have
a two-to-threefold increase in postoperative morbidity, the
most frequent complications being bleeding, wound and
cardiopulmonary complications. One month of preoperative abstinence reduces postoperative morbidity by
improving organ function [28, 29]. Smoking is another
patient factor that has a negative influence on recovery.
Current smokers have an increased risk for postoperative
pulmonary and wound complications [30]. One month of
abstinence from smoking is required to reduce the incidence of complications [30–33].
Summary and recommendation:
Increasing exercise preoperatively may be of benefit.
Smoking should be stopped 4 weeks before surgery
and alcohol abusers should stop all alcohol consumption 4 weeks before surgery (can only be beneficial
and not harmful).
Evidence level:
Prehab: Very low (inconsistency)
Alcohol: Low (only one high-quality RCT)
Smoking: High
Recommendation grade:
Prehab: No
Alcohol: Strong
Smoking: Strong
Preoperative bowel preparation
Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) has adverse physiologic effects attributed to dehydration [34], is distressing
for the patient, and is associated with prolonged ileus after
colonic surgery [35]. Moreover, it has been shown that
patients receiving MBP have a tendency towards a higher
incidence of spillage of bowel contents, which might
increase the rate of postoperative complications [36]. Thus,
the ‘‘dogma’’ of MBP before elective abdominal surgery
has been strongly challenged. The last Cochrane review of
2011 (which included 18 RCTs with 5,805 patients
undergoing elective colorectal surgery) could not find statistically significant differences between patients with
MBP versus no MBP, or with MBP versus rectal enema
alone, in terms of anastomotic leakage, mortality rates,
need for reoperation and wound infections [37].
Most of the RCTs on MBP have included patients
undergoing open colorectal surgery, and the extrapolation
World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284 261
123

to laparoscopic surgery might be questionable. Some surgeons argue that MBP makes laparoscopic surgery technically easier. It has been shown that laparoscopic
colectomy might be undertaken safely without preoperative
MBP [38]. Nonetheless, precisely localising small tumours
is more difficult by laparoscopy due to loss of palpation,
thus requiring intraoperative colonoscopy with preoperative MBP. However, preoperative tattoo would obviate
such a need.
Summary and recommendation:
MBP should not be used routinely in colonic surgery.
Evidence level:
High
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Preoperative fasting and carbohydrate treatment
Fasting from midnight has been standard practice in the
belief that this secures an empty stomach and thereby
reduces the risk of pulmonary aspiration in elective surgery. There has never been any scientific evidence behind
this dogma. A meta-analyses including a Cochrane review
of 22 RCTs showed that fasting from midnight does not
reduce gastric content nor raises the pH of gastric fluid
compared with patients allowed free intake of clear fluids
until 2 h before anaesthesia for surgery [39, 40]. Equally,
intake of clear fluids B2 h before surgery does not increase
the prevalence of complications. National and European
Anaesthesia Societies now recommend intake of clear
fluids until 2 h before the induction of anaesthesia as well
as a 6-h fast for solid food [41–44]. Obese (and even
morbidly obese) patients have been reported to have the
same gastric-emptying characteristics as lean patients [45,
46]. Diabetic patients with neuropathy may have delayed
gastric emptying for solids, thereby possibly increasing the
risk of regurgitation and aspiration [47]. There are no
conclusive data showing delayed emptying for fluids.
Patients with uncomplicated type-2 diabetes mellitus have
been reported to have normal gastric emptying [48]. When
given along with normal diabetic medication, gastric
emptying of a carbohydrate drink was shown to be normal
[49]. The clinical effectiveness of preoperative carbohydrate treatment has yet to be established in diabetic subjects. By providing a clear fluid containing a relatively high
concentration of complex carbohydrates 2–3 h before
anaesthesia, patients can undergo surgery in a metabolically fed state. Four-hundred millilitres of a 12.5 % drink
of mainly maltodextrins has been shown to reduce
preoperative thirst, hunger, and anxiety [40, 50] as well as
postoperative insulin resistance [51]. Carbohydrate treatment results in less postoperative losses of nitrogen and
protein [52, 53] as well as better-maintained lean body
mass [54] and muscle strength [55, 56]. Data from RCTs
indicate accelerated recovery, and preliminary data from a
meta-analysis show a one day-shorter stay in hospital for
patients receiving preoperative carbohydrate loading in
major abdominal surgery [57, 58].
Summary and recommendation:
Clear fluids should be allowed up to 2 h and solids up
to 6 hrs prior to induction of anaesthesia. In those
patients were gastric emptying may be delayed
(duodenal obstruction etc.) specific safety measures
should at the induction of anaesthesia. Preoperative
oral carbohydrate treatment should be used routinely.
In diabetic patients carbohydrate treatment can be
given along with the diabetic medication.
Evidence level:
Solids and fluids (overall); Moderate (study quality)
Diabetic patients: Low (inconsistency)
Carbohydrate loading (overall): Low (inconsistency,
study quality)
Diabetic patients: Very low (few studies, low quality)
Recommendation grade:
Fasting guidelines: Strong
Preoperative carbohydrate drinks: Strong
Preoperative carbohydrate drinks, diabetic patients:
Weak
Preanaesthetic medication
Preoperative education can reduce patient anxiety to an
acceptable level without the need for anxiolytic medication. Avoiding prolonged starvation times and adhering to
the ERAS guidance on carbohydrate loading is also beneficial [50]. Long-acting sedative premedication should be
avoided within 12 h of surgery because it affects immediate
postoperative recovery by impairing mobility and oral
intake. In 2009, a Cochrane review on premedication for
anxiolysis for adult day surgery concluded that patients
receiving oral anxiolytics were discharged from hospital
successfully but that some of the studies showed an
impairment in psychomotor function 4 h postoperatively,
which reduces the patient’s ability to mobilise, eat and
drink [59]. Administration of sedatives for anxiolysis
(particularly by the oral route) can be unpredictable, and is
difficult to facilitate effectively for patients being admitted
on the day of surgery, so is best avoided. If necessary,
262 World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284
123

short-acting anaesthetic drugs (e.g., fentanyl combined
with small incremental doses of midazolam or propofol)
can be administered under monitoring to facilitate regional
anaesthetic procedures such as spinal anaesthesia or thoracic epidural placement before the induction of anaesthesia with minimal residual effect at the end of surgery.
Summary and recommendation:
Patients should not routinely receive long- or shortacting sedative medication before surgery because it
delays immediate postoperative recovery. If necessary, short-acting intravenous drugs can be titrated
carefully by the anaesthetist to facilitate the safe
administration of epidural or spinal analgesia because
these do not significantly affect recovery.
Evidence level:
Sedative medication: High
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Prophylaxis against thromboembolism
The incidence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis
(DVT) in colorectal surgical patients without thromboprophylaxis is &30 %, with fatal pulmonary embolus (PE)
occurring in 1 % of subjects. Patients with malignant disease, previous pelvic surgery, taking corticosteroids preoperatively, extensive comorbidity and hypercoaguable
states are at increased risk [60]. All colorectal patients
should receive mechanical thromboprophylaxis with wellfitted compression stockings because these have been
shown to significantly reduce the prevalence of DVT in
hospitalised patients [61]. The addition of intermittent
pneumatic compression should also be considered, particularly in patients with malignant disease or who have
undergone pelvic surgery [62]. There is extensive evidence
supporting the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis
with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin. A recent study of 4,195 colorectal
patients demonstrated that pharmacological prophylaxis
reduced the prevalence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) from 1.8 to 1.1 % and also reduced
overall colorectal cancer mortality [63]. Once-daily
LMWH is as effective as twice-daily administration [64].
The risks of postoperative haemorrhage, heparin-induced
thrombocytopaenia and epidural haematoma with permanent injury are rare (best/worst case scenario, 1 in 54,000/1
in 24,000) [65]. It is recommended that epidural catheters
are not placed or removed within 12 h of heparin administration [66–68].
The use of VTE-prophylaxis for surgical inpatients is
well established, but the benefit of extended prophylaxis
for 28 days after discharge is controversial. A recent
Cochrane meta-analysis of four RCTs demonstrated a
significant reduction in the prevalence of symptomatic
DVT in patients with extended prophylaxis from 1.7 to
0.2 % (confidence interval (CI) 0.06–0.80; P = 0.02;
number needed to treat = 66) [69]. In an American audit of
52,555 patients entered into the National Surgical Quality
Improvement Database from 2005 to 2008, the prevalence
of early post-discharge symptomatic VTE was lower at
0.67 %. This would suggest that[200 patients would have
to receive thromboprophylaxis to prevent one symptomatic
VTE event [60]. A cost analysis of pronged prophylaxis
undertaken by the UK National Institute of Health and
Clinical Excellent demonstrated that it was cost-effective
for cancer surgery patients, but this evidence was based
only on 3 RCTs [62]. A universal policy of protracted
thromboprophylaxis may not be appropriate in all colorectal patients, particularly in patients having minimally
invasive or laparoscopic surgery, where the VTE risk may
be even lower [70]. Current international guidelines,
however, advocate its use in patients who have had major
cancer surgery in the abdomen or pelvis [62, 71].
Summary and recommendation:
Patients should wear well-fitting compression stockings, have intermittent pneumatic compression, and
receive pharmacological prophylaxis with LMWH.
Extended prophylaxis for 28 days should be given to
patients with colorectal cancer.
Evidence level:
Stockings, compression, LMVH, extended prophylaxis: High
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Antimicrobial prophylaxis and skin preparation
In a Cochrane review on antimicrobial prophylaxis in
colorectal surgery [72], the authors concluded that the use
of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing colorectal
surgery is imperative to reduce the risk of surgical-site
infections. For intravenous antibiotics, it is accepted that
the best time for administration is 30–60 min before the
incision is made [73]. Repeated doses during prolonged
procedures may be beneficial [74]. The timing of oral
administration of antibiotics is much less certain, especially in the light of current recommendations against
mechanical colon cleansing before surgery [75], because
World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284 263
123

oral antibiotics have not been studied in the uncleansed
colon. Antibiotics to be given should include cover against
aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
A study comparing different types of skin cleansing
showed that the overall prevalence of surgical-site infection was 40 % lower in a concentration chlorhexidinealcohol group than in a povidone-iodine group [76].
However, there is a risk of fire-based injuries and burn
injuries if diathermy is used in the presence of alcoholbased skin solutions [77]. Hair clipping is associated with
fewer surgical-site infections than shaving with razors if
hair removal is necessary before surgery, although the
timing of hair removal does not seem to affect the outcome
[78].
Summary and recommendation:
Routine prophylaxis with intravenous antibiotics
should be given 30–60 min before initiating colorectal
surgery. Additional doses should be given during
prolonged procedures according to the half-life of the
drug used.
Evidence level:
Antibiotic prophylaxis, chlorhexidine-alcohol preparation: High
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Standard anaesthetic protocol
There are no RCTs comparing general anaesthetic techniques for colorectal surgery. It makes good sense to use
short-acting induction agents such as propofol combined
with a short-acting opioid like fentanyl, alfentanil or a
remifentanil infusion. Short-acting muscle relaxants can be
titrated using neuromuscular monitoring. Maintaining a
deep neuromuscular block during surgery helps facilitate
vision and surgical access. Anaesthesia can be maintained
using short-acting inhalational anaesthetics such as sevoflurane or desflurane in oxygen-enriched air. Alternatively,
total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) using target-controlled infusion pumps can be utilised, and may be beneficial in patients with susceptibility to postoperative nausea
and vomiting (PONV).
In the elderly population, there is increasing evidence
that too deep an anaesthetic can be harmful and can
increase the risk of postoperative confusion. Using a bispectral index (BIS) monitor may help to titrate the depth
of anaesthesia to a minimum in this group of patients [79].
The anaesthetist is responsible for three key elements in
affecting outcome after surgery: stress reactions to the
surgery, fluid therapy, and analgesia. Recognition of the
importance of these ERAS components has led to the
description of a ‘‘trimodal approach’’ for optimising outcomes in laparoscopic surgery for anaesthetists [80]. A
regional anaesthetic block used in addition to general
anaesthesia during surgery can minimise the need for
postoperative intravenous opiates, thereby allowing rapid
awakening from anaesthesia which can facilitate early
enteral intake and mobilisation on the day of surgery. In
open surgery, the use of epidural analgesia has proven to be
superior to opioid-based alternatives for several important
outcomes [81], including pain [82], PONV [83] and complications [84]. In laparoscopic surgery, emerging data
indicate that alternative methods such as spinal anaesthesia, intravenous lidocain and patient-controlled anaesthesia
(PCA) may be equally effective [80]. A regional block can
also reduce the stress response [85]. This includes reducing
insulin resistance (the main mechanism behind hyperglycaemia). Glucose monitoring is important [86] because
hyperglycaemia can lead to an increased prevalence of
postoperative complications [87], although the use of an
intensive insulin regimen must be balanced against the risk
of hypoglycaemia [88]. During surgery, fluid delivery
should be targeted against physiological measures [89] and
mean arterial pressure maintained using vasopressors once
normovolaemia has been established so that overload of
salt and water is avoided [90]. This is particularly important if using epidural anaesthesia to maintain blood flow to
the gut [91]. Minimal invasive monitoring of cardiac output
is being increasingly used to target fluid therapy. Rockall
et al. have shown consistently low LOSH using oesophageal Doppler monitoring to direct fluid on an individual
basis in patients receiving morphine (2.8 days), epidural
(3.7 days) and spinal (2.7 days) anaesthesia [92]. Ultrashort LOSH (\23 h) was achieved by the same research
team by combining spinal analgesia and goal-directed fluids [93].
Attention to airway management and ventilation is
important to reduce the risk of postoperative chest infection
and lung injury (a major cause of morbidity after major
surgery). Micro-aspiration during anaesthesia may be a risk
factor and can be reduced by using correctly sized endotracheal tubes with cuff-pressure control. Levy et al.
showed that pulmonary function after laparoscopic surgery
was not significantly affected by the analgesic regimen
(thoracic epidural analgesia, spinal or morphine). Early
mobilisation has an important part to play in pulmonary
function [80].
Summary and recommendation:
A standard anaesthetic protocol allowing rapid awakening should be given. The anaesthetist should control
fluid therapy, analgesia and haemodynamic changes to
reduce the metabolic stress response. Mid-thoracic
264 World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284
123

epidural blocks using local anaesthetics and low-dose
opioids should be considered for open surgery. In
laparoscopic surgery, spinal analgesia or morphine
PCA is an alternative to epidural anaesthesia. If
intravenous opioids are to be used the dose should be
titrated to minimise the risk of unwanted effects.
Evidence level:
Rapid awakening: Low (lack of data),
Reduce stress response: Moderate (extrapolated data)
Open surgery: High
Laparoscopic surgery: Moderate (study quality)
Recommendation grade:
Strong
PONV
PONV affects 25–35 % of all surgical patients and is a
leading cause of patient dissatisfaction and delayed discharge from hospital. The aetiology of PONV is multifactorial and can be classified into three factors: patient,
anaesthetic and surgical. Female patients, non-smokers and
those with a history of motion sickness are at particular
risk. The use of volatile anaesthetic agents, nitrous oxide
and parenteral opiates increase the risk significantly. Major
abdominal surgery for colorectal disease is associated with
a high prevalence of PONV, reaching 70 % in some trials
[94]. There are numerous national and international
guidelines relating to the use of prophylactic antiemetics,
which can reduce PONV by B40 % [95]. Many of these
guidelines advocate the use of PONV scoring systems (e.g.,
Apfel score), which stratify patients into low-to-high risk
groups and dictates antiemetic prophylaxis based on the
perceived preoperative risk [96]. These scoring systems
have been proven to reduce PONV significantly in RCTs
but have not been widely implemented into routine clinical
practice. An alternative strategy not yet studied may be to
administer antiemetic prophylaxis to all patients who are
having inhalational anaesthesia, opiates or major abdominal surgery. This approach is gaining popularity among the
anaesthetists given that the cost and side-effect profile of
commonly used antiemetic drugs is small [97].
In recent years, the concept of a multimodal approach to
PONV has gained momentum. This combines non-pharmacological and pharmacological antiemetic techniques in
addition to ERAS programmes [98]. Non-pharmacological
techniques include the avoidance of emetogenic stimuli
such as inhalational anaesthetics, and the increased use of
propofol for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia.
Minimal preoperative fasting, carbohydrate loading and
adequate hydration of patients can also have a beneficial
effect. The use of high inspired oxygen concentrations
during anaesthesia has been implicated in a reduced prevalence of PONV, although a recent meta-analysis has cast
some doubt on its efficiency [99, 100]. Regional anaesthetic techniques such as epidurals and transversus
abdominal plane (TAP) blocks, have been proven to reduce
postoperative opiate use, which may in turn influence the
prevalence of PONV [101]. The use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) as an alternative to opiate
analgesia is well established.
Antiemetics can be classified into four main pharmacological subtypes depending on the receptor system they
act upon: cholinergic, dopaminergic (D2), serotonergic (5-
hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3)) and histaminergic
(H1). Each of the classes is superior to placebo in reducing
the risk of PONV [102]. There is also extensive evidence
for the use of dexamethasone, which is postulated to act via
central and peripheral mechanisms [103]. The potency of
the antiemetic effect is enhanced if C2 antiemetics are used
in combination: the serotonin analogues ondansetron or
droperidol [104]. Dexamethasone has also been shown to
have positive effects on reducing the prevalence of PONV,
but its immunosuppressive effects on long-term oncological outcomes are unknown. Newer antiemetic drugs such as
neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonists have been developed, and initial trial results have been encouraging [105].
If, despite prophylaxis, PONV is present postoperatively, the additional agents not used for prophylaxis can
be added to maximise the potency of the multimodal
approach.
Summary and recommendation:
A multimodal approach to PONV prophylaxis should
be adopted in all patients with C2 risk factors
undergoing major colorectal surgery. If PONV is
present, treatment should be given using a multimodal
approach.
Evidence level:
Low (multiple interventions)
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Laparoscopy and modifications of surgical access
Laparoscopy in colonic resection improves recovery if
judged by the prevalence of postoperative complications,
pain and hospital stay [106–111]. It may also reduce the
prevalence of postoperative immunosuppression [111]
while providing equivalence in cancer outcomes [112–
116]. The debate during the last 5 years has centred around
World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284 265
123

whether open surgery undertaken within an ERAS programme can match laparoscopic resection which is similarly optimised. Two small blinded randomised studies
reported conflicting results, with one showing no difference
in hospital stay between laparoscopic and open surgery
[117] whereas the other non-blinded study reported a 2.5-
day in hospital stay reduction after laparoscopic surgery
[118]. Readmission rates of[20 % were high in both arms
of the first trial and in the open group of the second trial,
but acceptable at 5 % in the laparoscopic arm of the latter
trial.
Recently, the Laparoscopy and/or Fast-track Multimodal
Management Versus Standard Care (LAFA) study reported
the results from its multicentre RCT which randomised
between laparoscopic and open segmental colectomy
within 9 Dutch centres [111]. The median primary and total
stay in hospital was 2-days shorter after laparoscopic
resection. Regression analysis showed that laparoscopic
surgery was the only predictive factor to reduce hospital
stay and morbidity. A detailed analysis has suggested that
laparoscopy has the potential to be used in [90 % of
patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer,
and that a conversion rate of\10 % is achievable [119].
Other methods that one might consider to add value in
colonic resection would include the use of robotic-assisted
surgery, single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and
hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS). The advantages of robotic surgery include seven degrees of movement,
three-dimensional (3D) views, tremor filtration, motion
scaling, and improved ergonomics. Whether this will
translate into substantial improvement in clinical outcomes
remains to be seen, and research is in progress in rectal
surgery [120]. The use of SILS has increased recently but
as yet there are no robust data to justify its advantage over
conventional laparoscopy [121]. HALS is more widespread
in certain parts of the world, but no clear evidence exists
demonstrating clinical improvements in recovery when
compared with conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery [122]. There are data demonstrating that recovery is
influenced by wound length [123] and that rates of incisional hernia are proportional to it [124]. Also, there is
debate regarding whether transverse incisions have an
advantage over longitudinal ones [8] but robust data are not
available.
Summary and recommendation:
Laparoscopic surgery for colonic resections is recommended if the expertise is available.
Evidence level:

Nasogastric intubation
A meta-analysis in 1995 showed that routine nasogastric
decompression should be avoided after colorectal surgery
because fever, atelectasis, and pneumonia are reduced in
patients without a nasogastric tube [125]. A meta-analysis
of 28 RCTs on the use of nasogastric decompression after
abdominal surgery included 4,195 patients [126]. Surgery
included colorectal resection (7 RCTs), gastroduodenal
sugery (7 RCTs), biliary and gynaecological surgery (2
(RCTs each), vascular and trauma surgery (1 RCTs each)
and mixed surgical populations (7 RCTs). Eight RCTs with
862 patients showed a reduction of the time interval from
surgery to the first passage of flatus by half a day if
nasogastric intubation was avoided. Pulmonary complications tended to be less common and, in a subgroup analysis
of only patients undergoing colorectal surgery, the incidence of pulmonary complications wound infection, ventral hernia or anastomotic leak was no different. LOSH and
gastric discomfort showed data in favour of no nasogastric
decompression in most of the RCTs. Similar results were
confirmed in a published meta-analysis in 2011 [127].
There is no rationale for routine insertion of a nasogastric
tube during elective colorectal surgery except to evacuate
air that may have entered the stomach during ventilation by
using a facial mask before endotracheal intubation.
Summary and recommendation:
Postoperative nasogastric tubes should not be used
routinely. Nasogastric tubes inserted during surgery
should be removed before reversal of anaesthesia.

Preventing intraoperative hypothermia
Maintaining normothermia is important to maintain normal
body homeostasis. Patients becoming hypothermic (definition: \36 C) have been shown to have higher rates of
wound infection [128, 129], and earlier studies reported
morbid cardiac events [130] and bleeding [131]. In
recovery, there is a higher risk of shivering in patients who
are hypothermic, which increases oxygen consumption at a
critical time [132]. Pain scores are also better in patients
266 World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284
123

who are not hypothermic. It is imperative to maintain the
patient’s temperature, rather than allowing it to drop and
then trying to restore it. Pre-warming patients with a warm
air blanket before coming to the operating theatre has been
shown to improve core temperature before surgery [133,
134]. This may be more important for patients who are
exposed while having prolonged anaesthetic procedures
(e.g., monitoring catheters and epidural insertion).
Maintaining temperature during the procedure can be
achieved by using forced-air warming blankets, heating
mattresses under the patient, or circulating-water garment
systems [135]. All have been shown to be effective at
maintaining normothermia during surgery. Active warming
should be continued into the postoperative period until the
patient’s temperature is C36 C [136]. In addition, intravenous fluids should be warmed from the start of administration [132]. The patient’s temperature should be
monitored to enable warming to be adjusted and to avoid
hyperpyrexia which otherwise may occur in prolonged
procedures if patients develop a systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS).
A Cochrane review in January 2011 reached the conclusion that heating or humidifying the carbon dioxide gas
used for insufflation does not improve the patient’s temperature or pain scores after surgery [137].
Summary and recommendation:
Intraoperative maintenance of normothermia with a
suitable warming device (such as forced-air heating
blankets, a warming mattress or circulating-water
garment systems) and warmed intravenous fluids
should be used routinely to keep body temperature
[36C. Temperature monitoring is essential to titrate
warming devices and to avoid hyperpyrexia.
Evidence level:
Maintenance of normothermia: High.
Temperature monitoring: Moderate (extrapolated
data).
Recommendation grade:

Perioperative fluid management
Fluid therapy plays a vital part in achieving optimal outcomes after surgery but continues to be one of the most
controversial aspects of perioperative care. Intravascular
volume is one of the key determinants of cardiac output
and therefore oxygen delivery to the tissues. Intravascular
hypovolaemia at a particular time can lead to hypoperfusion of vital organs and the bowel, which can lead to
complications. However, administering too much fluid can
lead to bowel oedema and increased interstitial lung water,
which can also lead to complications [138]. If the patient is
normovolaemic, blood pressure should be maintained using
vasopressors to avoid fluid overload.
It is apparent that fluid requirements in patients undergoing surgery by a laparotomy is different to laparoscopic
surgery due to increased fluid shifts, bowel handling and an
increased SIRS. The patient is also more likely to have
thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA), which also changes
vascular tone and venous capacitance, and further complicates fluid therapy. Laparoscopic surgery, therefore,
would appear to offer the potential to simplify the way fluid
is administered and reduce fluid requirements, but there is
evidence that cardiac output is reduced by the physiological consequences of the head-down position and pneumoperitoneum. Therefore, it is important to target fluid and
oxygen delivery appropriately in this group of patients
[139].
Fluid shifts should be minimised if possible. That is,
avoiding bowel preparation, maintaining hydration by
giving oral preload up to 2 h before surgery, as well as
minimising bowel handling and exteriorisation of the
bowel outside the abdominal cavity and avoiding blood
loss.
Studies have tried to determine whether a restrictive
fluid regimen is more beneficial than a liberal regimen.
However, the exact definitions of what is ‘‘liberal’’ and
‘‘restrictive’’ have varied between studies, as have patient
groups and endpoints, meaning comparison between the
studies is difficult. A review by Bundgaard-Nielson concluded that fluid excess was detrimental [140]. Varadhan
and Lobo examined the evidence in these earlier studies
and concluded that it is more important to reclassify
patients as being in a state of ‘‘fluid balance’’ or ‘‘fluid
imbalance’’: the former fared better [138].
Minimally invasive cardiac output monitors such as the
oesophageal Doppler (OD) device target fluid on an individualised basis by challenging the patient with a fluid
bolus (e.g., 200 ml colloid) and seeing if there is an
increase in stroke volume of C10 %. This fluid challenge is
repeated every 10–15 min until there is no further increase
in stroke volume. At this point, the stroke volume is
‘‘optimised’’. A meta-analysis of the use of OD to target
fluid therapy in major surgery has demonstrated LOSH,
fewer complications, faster return of bowel function,
reduced infection rates, less nausea and vomiting, a lower
incidence of acute kidney injury, and the possible
improvement of survival after surgery [89, 141]. There
have been few studies using OD within an ERAS protocol
for colorectal surgery, particularly in laparoscopic surgery.
In 2009, Senagore et al. [142] showed minimal benefit of
outcome when comparing goal-directed administration of
World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284 267
123

balanced salt solution or hetastarch using OD within an
ERAS protocol. They did conclude, however, that less
crystalloid was given when using OD.
Other minimally invasive cardiac output monitors that
use arterial waveform analysis or thoracic bioimpedance/
bioreactance are available but no RCTs in elective colorectal surgery using these devices have been carried out.
Dynamic variables using arterial waveform analysis such
as stroke volume variation (SVV) or pulse pressure variation (PPV) have been shown in ventilated patients to help
predict fluid responsiveness [143]. The advantage of arterial waveform analysis is that it can be used postoperatively
to target stroke volume and cardiac output.
Central venous catheters are not used routinely for
monitoring of central venous pressure as this is a poor
predictor of fluid responsiveness. Hence, they are inserted
only if there is a genuine need for central venous access for
drug infusions. The use of central venous saturation to
represent oxygen extraction in the early postoperative
period to guide fluid therapy has been validated by some
studies, and may be useful in high-risk patients [144, 145].
Postoperative intravenous fluids should be minimised to
maintain normovolaemia and avoid fluid excess. The enteral route should be used in preference and the drip taken
down at the earliest opportunity (preferably no later than
the morning after surgery). Traditionally, there has been a
reluctance to take the drip down in patients with TEA.
Hypotensive normovolaemic patients with TEA should be
treated with vasopressors and not an excess of fluid [146].
Balanced crystalloids have been shown to be superior to
0.9 % saline for the maintenance of electrolyte balance
[147].
Summary and recommendation:
Balanced crystalloids should be preferred to 0.9 %
saline. In open surgery, patients should receive
intraoperative fluids (colloids and crystalloids) guided
by flow measurements to optimise cardiac output.
Flow measurement should also be considered if: the
patient is at high risk with comorbidities; if blood loss
is[7 ml/kg; or in prolonged procedures. Vasopressors
should be considered for intra- and postoperative
management of epidural-induced hypotension provided the patient is normovolaemic. The enteral route
for fluid postoperatively should be used as early as
possible, and intravenous fluids should be discontinued as soon as is practicable.

Flow measurement in open surgery: High
Flow measurement in other patients: Moderate

Drainage of the peritoneal cavity after colonic anastomosis
Peritoneal drainage has traditionally been used to prevent
accumulation of fluid in the bed of dissection, infection,
and anastomotic breakdown. At least 8 RCTS of &1,390
participants have tested the efficacy of drainage in colorectal surgery; most trials evaluated closed-suction drainage for 3–7 days in elective colonic surgery. Meta-analyses
did not demonstrate effects on clinical or radiological
anastomotic dehiscence, wound infection, re-operation,
extra-abdominal complications or mortality [148, 149].
Subgroup analyses of trials in elective colon resection
replicated these findings [149].
Peri-anastomotic drainage has also been thought to
allow early detection and/or control of anastomotic dehiscence. However, pooled data show that enteric content or
pus is observed in only 1 in 20 drains in patients with
clinical leaks [150].
Thus, peritoneal drainage is not associated with any
advantage or disadvantage in the available literature.
Empirical observation suggests that many drainage systems
significantly impair independent mobilisation.
Summary and recommendation:
Routine drainage is discouraged because it is an
unsupported intervention that probably impairs
mobilisation.
Evidence level:
High
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Urinary drainage
Bladder drainage is used during and after major surgery to
monitor urine output and prevent urinary retention. Only
low-grade evidence is available regarding the clinical value
of perioperative monitoring of urine output; in observational studies in non-cardiac surgery, intraoperative urine
output was not a predictor of subsequent renal function
[151] or acute kidney injury [152].
A brief duration of transurethral drainage is desirable
because increasing duration is associated with increasing
risk of urinary tract infection (UTI). In a recent randomised
trial of early (day 1, n = 105) versus standard
268 World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284
123

(approximately day 4, n = 110) removal of the transurethral
catheter in patients having major abdominal and thoracic
surgery, the prevalence of UTI significantly reduced with
early removal (2 % versus 14 %) [153].
It has been proposed that urinary drainage is necessary
for the duration of epidural analgesia. However, all patients
in the quoted trial had TEA for C3 days, and the rate of
urinary retention was not significantly different between
the 1-day and the 4-day group (8 % versus 2 % single in–
out catheterisation; 3 % versus 0 % 24-h catheterisation)
[153]. This confirms findings from an uncontrolled prospective study of 100 patients treated with 48-h TEA after
open colonic resection who had their transurethral catheter
removed in the morning after surgery. Some 9 % had urinary retention and 4 % had a UTI [154].
A meta-analysis has shown that suprapubic bladder
catheterisation in abdominal surgery is associated with
lower rates of bacteriuria and lower patient discomfort than
transurethral drainage [155]. However, these data are relevant for urinary drainage of 4–7 days’ duration; benefit
from suprapubic catheterisation in short-term transurethral
drainage is uncertain.
Summary and recommendation:
Routine transurethral bladder drainage for 1–2 days is
recommended. The bladder catheter can be removed
regardless of the usage or duration of TEA.
Evidence level:
Low (few studies, extrapolated data)
Recommendation grade:
Routine bladder drainage: Strong
Early removal if epidural used: Weak
Prevention of postoperative ileus (including use
of postoperative laxatives)
Prevention of postoperative ileus is a major cause of delayed
discharge after abdominal surgery as well as a key objective
of enhanced-recovery protocols. No prokinetic agent has
been shown to be effective in attenuating or treating postoperative ileus, but several other types of interventions have
been successful. Mid-thoracic epidural analgesia [156] as
compared with intravenous opioid analgesia is highly
effective at preventing postoperative ileus [83, 157]. Fluid
overloading during [158] and after [159] surgery impairs
gastrointestinal function and should be avoided. Avoidance
of nasogastric decompression may reduce the duration of
postoperative ileus [126]. Laparoscopic-assisted colonic
resection also leads to faster return of bowel function, as well
as resumption of an oral diet, compared with open surgery
[109]. This effect of laparoscopy in comparison to open
surgery has been demonstrated in a recent RCT under traditional perioperative care as well as ERAS [111]. Oral
magnesium oxide was demonstrated to promote postoperative bowel function in a double-blinded RCT in abdominal
hysterectomy [160] and in reports from a well-established
enhanced recovery program in colonic resection [1, 161].
Another randomised trial in liver resection showed that oral
magnesium enhanced the return of bowel function [162] in
an ERAS setting, whereas a small RCT (49 patients) failed to
show any significant effect of oral magnesium on time to first
flatus or bowel movement (18.0 versus 14.0 and 42 versus
50 h; each p [0.15) nor on early intake of fluids, protein
drinks, solid food, nausea and vomiting, mobilisation or
LOSH [163] within a well established ERAS-protocol.
Bisacodyl (10 mg, p.o.) administered twice a day from the
day before surgery to the third postoperative day improved
postoperative intestinal function in a RCT with 189 patients
undergoing colorectal surgery [164]. There was no effect of
bisacodyl on tolerance to solid food or LOSH. Alvimopan (a
l-opioid receptor antagonist approved for clinical use in
postoperative ileus) given via the oral route accelerates
gastrointestinal recovery and reduces the LOSH in patients
undergoing open colonic resection having postoperative
opioid analgesia [165]. Perioperative use of chewing gum
has a positive effect on postoperative duration of ileus [166].
Summary and recommendation:
Mid-thoracic epidural analgesia and laparoscopic surgery should be utilised in colonic surgery if possible.
Fluid overload and nasogastric decompression should be
avoided. Chewing gum can be recommended, whereas
oral administration of magnesium and alvimopan (when
using opioid based analgesia) can be included.

Postoperative analgesia
The optimal analgesic regimen for major surgery should
give: good pain relief; allow early mobilisation, early

123

return of gut function and feeding; and not cause complications [167]. There has been increasing recognition that
different types of analgesic regimens are more suited to
particular types of surgery and incision. The cornerstone of
analgesia remains multimodal analgesia combining regional analgesia or local anaesthetic techniques and trying to
avoid parenteral opioids and their side effects.
Postoperative analgesia in open surgery
For open midline laparotomy, TEA is the optimal established analgesic technique. It offers superior analgesia in
the first 72 h after surgery [82] and earlier return of gut
function provided the patient is not fluid-overloaded. A
national audit by Cook et al. on behalf of the UK Royal
College of Anaesthetists has quantified the risks and
highlighted its safety provided good practice is adhered to
[65].
Using low-dose concentrations of local anaesthetic
combined with a short-acting opiate appears to offer the
best combination of analgesia while minimising the risk of
motor block and hypotension due to sympathetic blockade.
Several meta-analyses have shown improved outcomes
with TEA compared with opioid-based analgesia, including
pain, complications, PONV and insulin resistance [81–85].
Hypotension induced by sympathetic block should be
treated with vasopressors provided the patient is not hypovolaemic. The aim should be to remove the epidural
&48–72 h postoperatively by the time the patient has had a
bowel movement.
Postoperative analgesia in Laparoscopic surgery
Recent publications have shown that the duration of pain
after laparoscopic surgery requiring major analgesics is
much shorter than for open surgery, thereby allowing discharge from hospital as soon as 23 h after surgery [93].
Provided early feeding is tolerated in the laparoscopic
group, analgesic requirements at 24 h postoperatively are
often addressed with oral multimodal analgesia without the
need of regional blocks or strong opiates. However, even in
laparoscopic surgery there is the need for a small, low
transverse abdominal incision to deliver the specimen.
There is increasing interest in looking at alternatives to
TEA or morphine using spinal analgesia or TAP blocks.
A RCT by Levy et al. comparing spinal analgesia, morphine and low TEA in fluid-optimised patients provided
interesting results because patients with TEA had a longer
LOSH [92].
However, 3 RCTs reported contradictory effects on
gastrointestinal function depending on the level of block:
low-thoracic epidurals were not associated with benefits
[92, 168], whereas a trial using a mid-thoracic epidural
demonstrated significantly earlier return of flatus, stools
and tolerance of oral diet as compared with parenteral
opioid analgesia [169]. Other work has confirmed that,
although analgesia is superior in the early postoperative
period using TEA, LOSH is not reduced [170]. Work by
Virlos et al. confirmed that spinal analgesia allows earlier
mobilisation and hospital discharge compared with TEA
[171].
TAP blocks have been used in laparoscopic surgery to
cover the lower abdominal incision and combined with
intravenous paracetamol to reduce opioid administration
[172]. They are, however, short-acting and no significant
RCT has compared TAP with spinal or epidural analgesia
[101].
Postoperative multimodal analgesia
During the postoperative phase, a multimodal analgesic
regimen has been employed aiming to avoid the use of
opioids. Paracetamol is a vital part of multimodal analgesia. It is available in an intravenous preparation and can be
given as 1 g four times daily.
NSAIDs
NSAIDS are also an important part of multimodal analgesia. There have been clinical case series linking voltarol
(150 mg, p.o. once a day) and celecoxib (cyclo-oxygenase
(COX)-2 inhibitor) to an increased incidence of anastomotic dehiscence [173–176]. However, until more thorough studies addressing this question have been carried
out, there is not sufficient evidence to stop using NSAIDS
as a component of multimodal analgesia in the postoperative period. Tramadol is an alternative to NSAIDs
(although there are no recent studies relevant to colorectal
surgery).
Other drugs that can be used to reduce postoperative
opiate use
There are several ongoing studies on alternative drugs to
avoid the use of opioids, but no medication can be recommended for routine use.
Summary and recommendation:
TEA using low-dose local anaesthetic and opioids
should be used in open surgery. For breakthrough
pain, titration to minimise the dose of opioids may be
used. In laparoscopic surgery, an alternative to TEA is
a carefully administered spinal analgesia with a lowdose, long-acting opioid. In connection with TEA
withdrawal, NSAIDs and Paracetamol should be used.

Perioperative nutritional care
Most patients undergoing elective colonic resection can eat
normally before surgery, and many have a seemingly
normal nutritional status. In an ERAS setting, if the stress
of surgery is minimised, a low body mass index (BMI)
does not appear to be an independent risk factor for complications or prolonged LOSH, suggesting that, in this
setting, baseline nutritional status may not be as critical as
in more traditional perioperative-care situations [177]. The
epidemic of obesity in Western society means that the
average BMI of patients is often in the overweight or obese
range, and this may hide underlying muscle wasting. A
recent study has demonstrated that the presence of low
muscle mass is predictive of complications and LOSH after
colorectal surgery [178]. Whether such muscle wasting
relates to pre-existing comorbidity or is related to cancerassociated myopenia is not known.
Regardless of the BMI, consumption of energy and
protein is often low in the preoperative phase in patients
about to undergo colonic surgery. Therefore, careful history-taking directed towards recent unplanned weight loss
and reduced nutritional intake should be carried out. Normal food is the basis for nutrition before and after surgery
for most patients treated according to ERAS. In the context
of traditional perioperative care, addition of oral supplements can improve overall intake to reach nutritional goals
[179]. In enhanced-recovery programmes, oral nutritional
supplements (ONS) have been used on the day before
surgery and for at least the first 4 postoperative days to
achieve target intakes of energy and protein during the very
early postoperative phase [180, 181]. One study combining
preoperative oral treatment of carbohydrates, epidural
analgesia, and early enteral nutrition showed that these
three components of ERAS allowed nitrogen equilibrium
while keeping glucose levels normal without the need for
exogenous insulin by minimising insulin resistance [182].
If significant unplanned weight loss is present, oral supplements should be prescribed in the perioperative period,
and consideration should be given to continuing the
prescription once the patient returns home [179, 183]. For
significantly malnourished patients, nutritional supplementation (oral and/or parenteral) has the greatest effect if
started 7–10 days preoperatively, and is associated with a
reduction in the prevalence of infectious complications and
anastomotic leaks [184].
Special nutritional considerations should be taken for
elderly patients as well as those with chronic diseases and
alcohol problems who may also have micronutrient deficiencies or ingest vitamins and minerals below recommended doses and who may need supplementation before
and after surgery [185–188].
In the postoperative phase, patients undergoing ERAS
can drink immediately after recovery from anaesthesia and
then eat normal hospital food and, in doing so, spontaneously consume &1,200–1,500 kcal/day [189, 190]. This is
safe. RCTs of early enteral or oral feeding versus ‘nil by
mouth’ show that early feeding reduces the risk of infection
and LOSH, and is not associated with an increased risk of
anastomotic dehiscence [191–193]. However, with early
oral feeding, the risk of vomiting increases, especially in
the absence of multimodal anti-ileus therapy.
Different combinations of diets containing components
aimed to enhance immune function in surgical patients
have been studied. These diets, often called ‘immunonutrition’ (IN) usually contain combinations of arginine,
glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids, and nucleotides. Several
meta-analyses have been published on the clinical effectiveness of IN (two recent with references to most others)
[194, 195]. Overall, most studies show that there is clinical
benefit from this treatment due to a reduction in the prevalence of complications and shortened LOSH in the context
of traditional care, but results are heterogeneous. There is
evidence suggesting that the treatment is most effective in
malnourished patients, and there are no trials of the
effectiveness of these formulas in an ERAS setting if stress
is minimised.
Summary and recommendation:
Patients should be screened for nutritional status and,
if deemed to be at risk of under-nutrition, given active
nutritional support. For the standard ERAS patient,
preoperative fasting should be minimised and postoperatively patients should be encouraged to take normal
food as soon as possible after surgery. ONS can be
used to supplement total intake.

Postoperative control of glucose
Insulin resistance is the cause of postoperative hyperglycaemia. Increasing insulin resistance [196] and glucose
levels [87] have been shown to be associated with complications and mortality after major abdominal surgery, and
also when adjusted for key confounders. This risk increases
with higher insulin resistance and/or higher glucose levels.
These data are primarily from glucose values during the
day of surgery and postoperative day 1 with minimal food
intake (i.e., not typical ERAS settings).
There are very little data on glucose control in an ERAS
setting when patients are eating. However, available data
with patients undergoing colorectal surgery in an ERAS
protocol eating 1,500 kcal from day 1 after elective colorectal surgery show that, as expected, glucose levels are
higher after food intake compared with morning fasting
levels [189]. Patients with higher preoperative levels of
glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) remain &1 mmol/l higher
compared with patients with normal preoperative HbA1c
levels, and they also develop more complications. A small
study combining epidural, preoperative carbohydrate and
postoperative continuous complete enteral tube feeding
after major colorectal surgery showed that glucose levels
were maintained at normal levels without the need for
insulin in the first 3 postoperative days [182]. Several
treatments in the ERAS protocol affect insulin action/
resistance [197, 198] and hence glucose levels directly or
indirectly (bowel preparation prolonging preoperative
fasting; preoperative carbohydrate treatment instead of
overnight fasting). The prophylaxis and treatment of
PONV to support nutritional intake involves: avoiding
fasting; maintenance of fluid balance to support bowel
movements; epidural anaesthesia to reduce the endocrine
stress response from the adrenal glands; avoiding the use
of opioids disturbing bowel movements; avoiding antiinflammatory treatments to reduce stress; avoiding tubes
and drains; and active mobilisation. None of these treatments carry the risk of hypoglycaemia.
Treatment of hyperglycaemia in surgical patients in the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) consistently shows improved
results in that complications are avoided [199–202]. Any
reduction in hyperglycaemia, regardless of the degree or
level, improves outcomes. At levels [10–12 mmol/l, the
risk of osmotic diuresis increases and causes additional
disturbances in fluid balance [203]. However, using intravenous insulin carries the risk of hypoglycaemia [200],
especially in the ward setting.
Summary and recommendation:
Hyperglycaemia is a risk factor for complications and
should therefore be avoided. Several interventions in
the ERAS protocol affect insulin action/resistance,
thereby improving glycaemic control with no risk of
causing hypoglycaemia. For ward-based patients,
insulin should be used judiciously to maintain blood
glucose as low as feasible with the available
resources.
Evidence level:

Early mobilisation
Early mobilisation has been postulated to reduce chest
complications and may counteract insulin resistance from
immobilisation [9]. Combining forced mobilisation with
nutritional support results in improved muscle strength but
only during the early postoperative phase [204]. Another
RCT in 119 patients showed that postoperative muscle
training had little effect of long-term postoperative outcomes [205]. A recent review confirmed these earlier
results [206]. Conversely, prolonged bed rest has several
negative effects, including reduced work capacity [207].
Also, a multivariate linear regression analysis of data collected during the LAFA trial [111], supported the notion
that mobilisation on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3 is a
factor significantly associated with a successful outcome
of ERAS. Conversely, failure to mobilise on the first
272 World J Surg (2013) 37:259–284
123

postoperative day may be due to inadequate control of
pain, continued intravenous intake of fluids, indwelling
urinary catheter, patient motivation, and preexisting comorbidities. In a recent study in Yeovil, failure to mobilise
was one of the most common reasons for ERAS deviation
and was associated with prolonged LOSH [208].
Summary and recommendation:
Available RCTs do not support the direct beneficial
clinical effects of postoperative mobilisation. Prolonged immobilisation, however, increases the risk of
pneumonia, insulin resistance, and muscle weakness.
Patients should therefore be mobilised.

Audit
Measuring standards and auditing the quality of healthcare
drive continue to improve practice [209]. Auditing compliance is shown to be a key instrument to assist clinicians
implementing the ERAS programme [210].
Auditing ERAS can be discussed under three
domains:(i) measuring clinical outcomes of ERAS such as
LOSH, readmission rates and complications (as reviewed
above) (ii) determining functional recovery and patient
experience and (iii) measuring compliance with (or deviation from) the ERAS protocol.
The original clinical outcome of ERAS programmes as
described by Kehlet et al. resulting in a reduction of
median LOSH after open colonic resection to 2 days [1]
have not been reproduced widely. However, there is now
robust evidence to support the benefits of ERAS over traditional postoperative care. This has been demonstrated in
several meta-analyses in terms of shorter postoperative
LOSH, lower complication rates, and acceptable readmission rates [211–214]. Hence, these measures of clinical
outcome should be included in the clinical audit.
Measuring patients’ experiences with ERAS, however,
has not been investigated very thoroughly. This is mostly
due to the lack of reliable and valid tools that can be used
widely across many centres to report patients’ experiences.
Nevertheless, in the literature on this subject, ERAS does
not seem to adversely influence quality of life (QoL) or
psychomotor functions such as sleep quality, pain and
fatigue levels after surgery [215]. In a recent unpublished
Delphi consensus in the UK, measuring patient experience
has been highlighted as a fundamental element of ERAS.
Measuring compliance has proven to be an instrumental
factor in investigating the success of ERAS [210]. By
auditing the details of the key elements of the clinical
pathway, it is often easier to understand the occurrence of
certain failures that lead to complications. In addition,
measuring compliance helps to direct future education and
the modification of other interventions (if necessary).
ERAS-care outcomes were reported in relation to compliance to the ERAS-protocol in a large cohort study of nearly
1,000 consecutive patients [210]. This study concluded that
the proportion of patients with postoperative morbidity and
symptoms delaying discharge and readmission to hospital
were significantly reduced (38–69 %) with higher levels of
ERAS compliance. Nearly all of the pre- and perioperative
ERAS items influenced the different outcomes in a beneficial way. However, only intravenous fluid management
and intake of preoperative carbohydrate drink were identified as independent predictors of outcome.
In the LAFA study [111], overall compliance to ERAS
items of 60 % was reported in laparoscopic and open
colonic surgery. A follow-up study [216] showed that
enforced advancement of oral intake, early mobilisation,
laparoscopic surgery and female gender were independent
determinants of early recovery. However, two of the variables determining outcomes—postoperative oral intake and
mobilisation—could also be regarded as outcomes and
dependent on the pre- and postoperative care. A third study
investigating factors influencing outcomes in an ERAS
setting [6] reported that fluid overload and non-functioning
epidural analgesia were independent predictors of postoperative complications. It is difficult to compare the three
studies except that all show that compliance with certain
care elements known to improve outcomes also does so in
the ERAS setting. The importance of the individual elements is likely to be influenced by variation in compliance
in any given study situation.
There are several tools to audit compliance and ERAS
outcomes. Within the ERAS society, a systematic process
of audit has been built into the ERAS Interactive Audit
System and data collection system to facilitate implementation of ERAS (www.erassociety.org) [217]. The ERAS
database differs from other common audit tools in that it
collects data on patient demographics, treatment and outcomes. Additionally included in the ERAS system is the
recording of compliance using a series of evidence-based
treatment interventions that have been shown to influence
outcomes. A raft of measures which provide information
on different aspects of postoperative recovery (and potential factors delaying it) is incorporated into the dataset to
allow interrogation of the care process. The ERAS audit
system also provides relevant feedback on clinical outcomes that are important for patients, healthcare providers
and other decision-makers. Within England, there are

various local systems and one national toolkit to record
ERAS elements and outcomes. The Enhanced Recovery
Partnership Programme (ERPP) has designed a toolkit to
measure compliance in ERAS [www.natcansatmicrosite.
net/enhancedrecovery/].
Summary and recommendation:
A systematic audit is essential to determine clinical
outcome and measure compliance to establish successful implementation of the care protocol. The
system should also report patient experience and
functional recovery, but validated tools are required
for this aspect.
Evidence level:
Systematic audit: Moderate (extrapolation, study
quality)
Patient experience/functional recovery: Very low
(lack of valid tools)

Strong
Outcomes of ERAS
Eras versus traditional care in elective colonic surgery:
clinical outcomes
Several studies have demonstrated that the ERAS programmes compared with traditional perioperative care is
associated with earlier recovery and discharge after colonic
resection [1, 2, 218–223]. Recently, the effect of perioperative treatment with the ERAS protocol on four outcome
parameters (mortality, morbidity, LOSH, hospital readmissions) after mainly colonic surgery was reported in two
systematic reviews: Spanjersberg et al., Cochrane, 2011
[224] and Varadhan et al. [214]. Different variations of the
ERAS programme were compared with traditional perioperative care based on 4 and 6 RCTs, respectively ([4, 5,
222, 225] (n = 237) and [4–6, 222, 225, 226] (n = 452)).
The mortality in patients undergoing surgery within an
ERAS programme was 0.4 and 1.3 % in patients within
traditional perioperative care. The difference was not significant, RR, 0.53 (0.12–2.38) [224] and RR, 0.53
(0.09–2.15) [214]. However, there was a significant
reduction in RR for postoperative morbidity in patients
undergoing surgery within an ERAS programme of 48 %,
RR, 0.52 (0.38–0.71) [224] and 47 %, RR, 0.53
(0.41–0.69) [214], respectively. Furthermore, LOSH after
surgery was significantly shorter in patients within an
ERAS protocol compared with patients undergoing
surgery within traditional perioperative care, –2.94 days
(–3.92 to –2.19) [224], –2.51 days (–3.54 to –1.47) [214].
Finally, there was no difference in hospital readmissions
among patients within an ERAS programme (3.3–4.4 %
versus 4.2–5.7 %) in patients within traditional care (RR,
0.87 (0.08–9.39) [224], RR, 0.80 (0.32–1.98) [214]. In a
third meta-analysis (Adamina et al.) [227] investigating the
same 6 randomised studies as in the meta-analysis of
Varadhan et al. [214], these results were confirmed.
Summary and recommendation:
ERAS protocols should be used in elective colonic
surgery. Using more evidence-based elements of
perioperative care from an ERAS protocol is likely
to improve outcomes further.
Evidence level:
LOSH: High
Morbidity: Low (inconsistensy, study quality, low rate
of difference)
Hospital readmissions: Low (inconsistency)
Recommendation grade:
Strong
Effect of ERAS on health economics and QoL
The literature examining the impact of ERAS on health
economics and QoL after colonic surgery is sparse. Two
cohort studies collected data on the cost before and after
the introduction of ERAS. The first [228], analyzed cost
during the 3-months after intervention in 60 patients
undergoing surgery for colon cancer or rectal cancer within
an ERAS protocol. This was compared with a tight control
group of 86 individuals treated by the same surgeon and
who were recruited immediately before the introduction of
the ERAS protocol. There were non-significant reductions
in hospital, indirect, and total costs after the introduction of
ERAS. The second study [229] looked at cost savings
within a university hospital in New Zealand using a casematched comparison of 50 patients in each group. After the
introduction of enhanced recovery, 30-day costs were
reduced by a mean of €4,240 per patient, even taking into
account start-up costs. A review containing US cost analyses indicated a saving of &2,000 USD per patient [227].
Recently, the Dutch multicenter LAFA trial [111] examined in-hospital costs after colonic resection within and
outside an ERAS protocol, finding (surprisingly) that there
were no significant differences between groups. Despite the
limited evidence for ERAS reducing the cost of care within
the literature, the fact that it reduces the prevalence of
complications and postoperative stay in RCTs lends support to the notion that it imparts cost benefits.

QoL was assessed before 2006 by King and colleagues
[228], who reported only non-significant trends after
introduction of ERAS. Fatigue was measured by the New
Zealand group in a separate case-controlled prospective
study [230], which elicited similar results to those reported
by Jakobsen et al. [231]. Patients within an ERAS programme suffered less fatigue B30 days after surgery, and
there were reduced consequences of fatigue even at
60 days in the New Zealand study. The lack of blinding
and randomisation weakened the results of both studies, but
there are clear methodological problems blinding patients
to ERAS. More recently, the LAFA trial [111] randomised
between ERAS and standard perioperative care but did not
identify improvements in health-related QoL—one explanation for this having been discussed above. A recent
review [215] did not find consistent disadvantages to ERAS
care during colonic surgery if recovery was measured using
QoL instruments. This is possibly because the tools used
are not sufficiently sensitive to detect the improvements in
clinical recovery that clinicians perceive are present. Delaney et al. addressed this problem by designing a novel
postoperative scoring system [232], which may be of use in
this area.
Summary and recommendation:
ERAS can be recommended because it is likely to
reduce the cost of colorectal surgery and improve the
quality of recovery

Comment
The practice of surgery and anaesthesia is continuously
changing. This creates the need for regular updates of the
knowledge base and for continuous training of those
involved in the treatment of surgical patients. The ERAS
Society for Perioperative Care (www.erassociety.org) was
initiated by the former ERAS Study Group and was formed
in 2010 to support these processes. The Society participates
in the improvement of perioperative care by developing
new knowledge through research, education and also by
being involved in the implementation of best practice.
Current recommendations from the ERAS Society for
clinical perioperative care of patients undergoing elective
colonic surgery are based on evidence evaluated according
to the GRADE system. The evidence-based recommendations present the ERAS protocol interventions separately
and overall, and are intended to be used by units undertaking colonic surgery to implement and upgrade to what
the current literature shows to be best practice: the ERAS
protocol.
Current recommendations are a development of the
previous two versions published by the ERAS Study Group
[8, 9]. We used a more stringent system for the evaluation
of the evidence and recommendations. The currently used
grading of the evidence is very demanding, and it may
seem to the reader that some of the protocol items have
weak levels of evidence. Simultaneously, current review of
the evidence must be put into the perspective of the level of
evidence in general for common medical practices and
treatments. The evidence for components in the ERAS
protocol is at a level that is commonly in use throughout
medicine today. A summary of the guidelines is shown in
Table 1.
