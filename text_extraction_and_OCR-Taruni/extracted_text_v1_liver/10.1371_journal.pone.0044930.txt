Abstract
Background: Transient elastography (TE), a non-invasive tool that measures liver stiffness, has been evaluated in metaanalyses for effectiveness in assessing liver fibrosis in European populations with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, these
data cannot be extrapolated to populations in Asian countries, where chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is more prevalent. In this
study, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the overall performance of TE for assessing liver fibrosis in patients with CHB.
Methods: Studies from the literature and international conference abstracts which enrolled only patients with CHB or
performed a subgroup analysis of such patients were enrolled. Combined effects were calculated using area under the
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) and diagnostic accuracy values of each study.
Result: A total of 18 studies comprising 2,772 patients were analyzed. The mean AUROCs for the diagnosis of significant
fibrosis (F2), severe fibrosis (F3), and cirrhosis (F4) were 0.859 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.857–0.860), 0.887 (95% CI,
0.886–0.887), and 0.929 (95% CI, 0.928–0.929), respectively. The estimated cutoff for F2 was 7.9 (range, 6.1–11.8) kPa, with
a sensitivity of 74.3% and specificity of 78.3%. For F3, the cutoff value was determined to be 8.8 (range, 8.1–9.7) kPa, with
a sensitivity of 74.0% and specificity of 63.8%. The cutoff value for F4 was 11.7 (range, 7.3–17.5) kPa, with a sensitivity of
84.6% and specificity of 81.5%.
Conclusion: TE can be performed with good diagnostic accuracy for quantifying liver fibrosis in patients with CHB.

Introduction
Liver fibrosis occurs in response to almost all causes of chronic
liver insult, and its initiation is an important phase of chronic liver
disease. [1] Without appropriate intervention, liver fibrosis
progresses, leading to changes in liver morphology and deterioration of liver function and hemodynamics. Eventually,
progression of liver fibrosis increases the risk for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic decompensation, which are serious
complications in patients with end-stage liver disease. [2,3]
Therefore, estimating the precise degree of liver fibrosis is
important for predicting prognosis, surveillance, and optimizing
treatment strategies in patients with chronic liver disease.
Liver biopsy (LB) is currently the gold standard for assessing
liver fibrosis, but this invasive procedure may cause discomfort and
pain, and rarely causes serious complications such as bleeding or
biopsy-related mortality. [4] In addition, sampling errors and
inter- and intraobserver variability may impede diagnostic
accuracy. [5,6] Despite these pitfalls, LB remains the standard
diagnostic tool due to the absence of better alternatives. Therefore,
many investigators have focused on the development and
evaluation of noninvasive liver fibrosis assessment methods to
replace LB. [7–9] Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using
transient elastography (TE; FibroScanH; Echosens, Paris, France)
has been introduced as a promising noninvasive device for
assessing liver fibrosis, with considerable accuracy and reproducibility for predicting cirrhosis. [10,11].
Because TE was first developed in France, most studies of its
benefits have been performed in European countries where
chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is prevalent. Accordingly, extensive
data on the clinical roles of TE in assessing liver fibrosis in patients
with CHC have been gathered. [12–14] Furthermore, several
meta-analyses have recently reported that TE is a reliable
noninvasive tool to detect advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
[15–18] However, because most studies included in the metaanalyses investigated European populations with CHC, these data
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e44930

cannot be extrapolated to populations in Asian countries where
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is more prevalent than hepatitis
C virus (HCV).
In recent years, the performance of TE has been evaluated in
Asian patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB),[19,20] and the
experiences of TE in these populations have accumulated.
However, the overall performance of TE in patients with CHB
has not been reported. Hence, in this study, we performed a metaanalysis to assess the overall performance of TE for the diagnosis
of liver fibrosis in patients with CHB.
Materials and Methods
Transient Elastography
TE is a novel device for obtaining images using ultrasound. [21]
TE is performed on the right lobe of the liver through the
intercostal spaces on patients lying in the dorsal decubitus position
with the right arm in maximal abduction. The operator locates
a liver portion that is at least 6 cm thick and free of large vascular
structures, and presses the transducer probe button to start the
measurement. A vibration from the probe toward the tissue
induces an elastic shear wave that propagates through the tissue.
The velocity of the pulse-echo ultrasound following this propagation is measured; velocity increases with liver stiffness. The success
rate is calculated by dividing the number of valid measurements by
the total number of measurements. The interquartile range (IQR)
is an index of intrinsic variability of TE, expressed as the interval
of LSM results containing 50% of valid measurements between the
25th and 75th percentiles. The median value of successful
measurements is selected as a representative LSM result, expressed
in kilopascals (kPa).
Literature Search
We searched medical databases (PubMed [MEDLINE],
EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar) to identify
articles published between 2002 (when TE was first introduced)
and March 2011. The search terms used were ‘‘FibroScan,’’
‘‘transient elastography,’’ ‘‘elastography and liver,’’ ‘‘liver stiffness,’’ and ‘‘liver fibrosis.’’ In addition, we scanned the websites
and conference abstract books of the American Association for the
Study of the Liver, European Association for the Study of the
Liver, Digestive Disease Week, and Asian Pacific Association for
the Study of the Liver.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
For inclusion in this meta-analysis, studies needed to satisfy the
following criteria: 1) enrolled only patients with CHB or
performed a sub-group analysis of such patients; 2) evaluated the
performance of TE to establish liver fibrosis stages based on LB as
a reference standard; 3) used a comparable LB staging system,
such as METAVIR or the systems of Ishak, Brunt, Ludwig,
Knodell, Desmet, or Scheuer; and 4) evaluated the diagnostic
accuracy of TE in assessing liver fibrosis stages using area under
the receiver operating characteristic curves(AUROCs) and/or
expressed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPVs),
or negative predictive values (NPVs) for the diagnosis of fibrosis
stage based on certain cutoff TE values.
Studies were excluded from this analysis if they did not include
patients with CHB, did not use LB as a reference test, did not use
a fibrosis staging system comparable with METAVIR, and/or did
not report AUROC values or diagnostic indices such as sensitivity,
specificity, PPVs, or NPVs. Abstracts with data that were
subsequently published as full-length articles or that obviously
presented data from the same study at different meetings (same
study group and patient population, identical study design, and
same or increased number of patients) were evaluated, and only
the most recent abstracts were included in this analysis. Reports
not written in English were also excluded. Data extraction was
performed independently by two reviewers (Chon YE and Kim
SU), and when discrepancies surfaced, a final consensus opinion
was adopted after discussion.
Data Analysis
Data and results of the included studies are summarized in
Tables 1 and 2. For meta-analysis, AUROC values were
obtained from all included studies and the standard error of each
study was determined or approximated from the available data
using a 95% confidence interval (CI). To calculate the mean
AUROC, scores from various fibrosis staging systems were
standardized using a scale ranging from 0 to 4 points. For
example, Ishak scores (0–6) were transformed to METAVIR
scores, with Ishak $ F3 assigned to METAVIR $ F2, Ishak $ F4
assigned to METAVIR $ F3, and Ishak $ F5 assigned to
METAVIR F4, respectively.
Using AUROC and sensitivity values from each study, we
performed a homogeneity test for each effect. Heterogeneity
resulting from the effects of many different factors (different
staging systems, different LB skills and lengths of specimen, TE
skills and failure rates, and different patient demographics) existed
among the studies. Therefore, we evaluated the significance of the
estimated combined effects using a random effects model [22],
which addressed the heterogeneity of studies in analyzing the
efficacy of TE. The quality of the studies included in the metaanalysis was assessed by the Quality Assessment of Studies of
Diagnostic Accuracy Included in Systematic Review (QUADAS)
questionnaire (Table S1)and each item was rated as yes, no, or
unclear. [23].
Results
Selection of Candidate Studies
The literature search identified 52 primary studies (30 fulllength articles and 22 abstracts) that evaluated the performance of
TE. However, several studies were excluded because they did not
include patients with CHB (13 studies), did not provide data for
diagnostic accuracy (AUROC; 6 studies), did not provide
sensitivity or specificity values for any fibrosis stage (6 studies),
were not written in English (3 studies), did not used LB as
a reference (3 studies), and/or used a fibrosis staging system that
was not comparable with METAVIR (3 studies). Finally, 18
studies[19,24–40] were included in the meta-analysis after reading
each study in full and adopting inclusion and exclusion criteria. All
eighteen studies fulfilled .10/14 QUADAS items and successfully
passed the quality assessment.
Patient Characteristics and Study Results
The patient characteristics and results of studies chosen for
meta-analysis are summarized in Table 1. The median sample
size was 159 (range, 35–486) patients, and 18 studies comprising
2,772 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was
44.8 (range, 35.6–57.8) years, and 48.6% of the patients were men.
The fibrosis staging systems used to classify liver histology varied.
Fourteen studies (77.8%) used the METAVIR score, 2 (11.0%)
studies used the Batts and Ludwig scores, 1 (5.6%) study used the
Scheuer score, and 1 (5.6%) study used the Ishak score. Fourteen
(77.8%) of the 18 studies enrolled only patients with CHB, and 10
(55.6%) studies demonstrated all indices of diagnostic accuracy
(sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV) for all fibrosis stages.

Meta-analysis of TE for Staging Liver Fibrosis
Table 2 shows the AUROC, 95% CI, cutoff values, sensitivity,
and specificity of each study. Based on these data, the metaanalysis was performed to obtain TE cutoff values for each liver
fibrosis stage (Table 3).
Ten (55.6%) studies provided cutoff values for predicting
significant fibrosis ($F2). Five studies reported all diagnostic
accuracy parameters (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV), and
the other five studies reported only sensitivity and specificity. A
total of 1,625 patients were included in the meta-analysis and
7.9 kPa (range, 6.1–11.8 kPa; sensitivity, 74.3%; specificity,
78.3%) was determined as a cutoff value for predicting significant
fibrosis. Based on the AUROC values and corresponding 95% CIs
for predicting significant fibrosis of 10 (55.6%) studies, the
combined AUROC value considering random effects was
calculated as 0.859 (95% CI, 0.857–0.860) (Figure 1a).
Four (22.2%) studies provided cutoff values for predicting
advanced fibrosis ($F3). Two studies reported all diagnostic
indices, whereas two reported only sensitivity and specificity. The
cutoff value from 960 patients was determined as 8.8 kPa (range,
8.1–9.7 kPa; sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 63.8%). Based on the
AUROC values and corresponding 95% CIs for predicting
advanced fibrosis of six (33.3%) studies, the combined AUROC
value considering random effects was 0.887 (95% CI, 0.886–0.887)
(Figure 1b).
Thirteen (72.2%) studies were used to determine the cutoff
values for cirrhosis (F4). Seven studies reported all diagnostic
indices, whereas six reported only sensitivity and specificity. The
cutoff value from 2,051 patients was determined as 11.7 kPa
(range, 7.3–17.5 kPa; sensitivity, 84.6%; specificity, 81.5%). Based
on the AUROC values and corresponding 95% CIs for predicting
cirrhosis of 12 (66.7%) studies, the combined AUROC value
considering random effects was 0.929 (95% CI, 0.928–0.929)
(Figure 1c).
Publication Bias
No outlier study and possible publication bias was identified in
$F2, $F3, and F4, respectively (Figure 1a–c).
Discussion
To overcome the limitations of LB in assessing the severity of
liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, a great effort has
been made to develop and validate noninvasive methods for
detecting liver fibrosis. Among these noninvasive methods, TE has
been widely studied as a novel noninvasive method of quantifying
the degree of liver fibrosis, mainly in patients with CHC. [12,41]
Recently, the application of TE has also been extended to patients
with CHB, based on cumulated evidence indicating accuracy
comparable with that of CHC. [25,42] Because a systematic
approach is required for integrating the TE data from independent studies, we performed a meta-analysis to provide
a combined systematic review of the accuracy of TE diagnostics in
patients with CHB. In contrast to four previous meta-analyses that
included individual studies comprising mostly patients with
CHC,[15–18] our study tried to elevate the accuracy of the
meta-analysis by exclusively selecting patients with CHB, thereby
eliminating potential bias due to different viral etiologies.
The combined effect of AUROC values using a random-effect
model[22] for the diagnosis of $F2, $F3, and F4 were 0.859

(95% CI, 0.857–0.860), 0.887 (95% CI, 0.886–0.887),and 0.929
(95% CI, 0.928–0.929) respectively, which are not excellent, but
are acceptable and comparable to those from previous metaanalyses (Table 4). [43] Although the sensitivity and specificity of
our study for predicting $F2 (74.3% and 78.3%, respectively)
were similar to those from previous meta-analyses (70–79% and
78–84%, respectively), they were lower for predicting F4 (84.6%
and 81.5%, respectively) than those from previous studies (83–
87% and 89–91%, respectively; Table 4). This slightly lower
sensitivity and specificity in our study can be explained in part by
differences in the composition of the study population. In previous
meta-analyses, the predominant etiology of chronic liver disease
was chronic HCV infection. Indeed, the proportions of individual
studies focusing on patients with CHC were 85.7% (18/21) in the
study by Stebbing et al.,[16] 77.8% (7/9) in that by Talwalkar et
al.,[15] and 42.5% (17/40) in the study by Tsochatzis et al.,[18]
whereas our study included only patients with CHB. Compared
with CHC, CHB displays a more complex natural history and
frequent exacerbations accompanied by fluctuating alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) levels. [44,45] Therefore, overestimated
TE values due to high ALT levels at the time of measurement

might have produced false-positive results[27] and reduced the
overall sensitivity and specificity of TE in our study.
The optimal cutoff values in our study were 7.9 kPa for $F2,
8.8 kPa for $F3, and 11.7 kPa for F4. However, Stebbing et al. [16]
determined higher cutoff values (7.81 kPa for $F2 and 15.56 kPa
for F4), which increased further when calculated only for patients
with CHC (8.44 kPa for $F2 and 16.14 kPa for F4). Fredrich-rust
et al. [17] and Tsochatzis et al. [18] also adopted higher cutoff values
(13.01 and 15.0 kPa, respectively) for determining F4 compared
with that found in our study (11.7 kPa; Table 4). This tendency of
low cutoff TE values in our study may be explained by two unique
features of CHB. First, Sturm et al. [46] concluded recently that the
total amount of liver fibrosis reflected by the fibrosis area was
significantly lower in patients with CHB, because the fibrous septa
might be thinner in these patients than in those with CHC with
the same histological stage (F4). Second, because CHB tends to
progress to cirrhosis with larger nodules (macronodular cirrhosis)
than CHC, the TE pulse is more likely to pass through the normal
liver parenchyma between fibrotic bands in patients with CHB
than in those with CHC. [47] These two observations might have
resulted in a lower cutoff TE value for patients with CHB
compared with patients with CHC. Thus, physicians should be
aware of the pitfalls of TE, such as false negativity or lower cutoff
values resulting from macro nodular cirrhosis and thin fibrous
septa, and false positivity or lower performance resulting from high
ALT levels. [48] Accordingly, TE results should be interpreted
within the clinical context.
Based on the results of our meta-analysis, TE seems to be a good
tool for assessing liver fibrosis in patients with CHB, but it is not
excellent. However, because LB is not a perfect gold standard, it is
nearly impossible to achieve an AUROC close to 1 in an analysis
based on LB data, even with a hypothetically perfect noninvasive
liver fibrosis measurement tool. [49] Although TE is inferior to
histological evaluation in principle, TE is superior to clinical
diagnostic criteria in diagnosing compensated cirrhosis. [19,50]
Thus, the performance of TE in our study (AUROC = 0.93) for
predicting cirrhosis is sufficiently accurate. Accurate evaluation of
TE diagnostic performance will only be possible after establishing
an optimal reference standard, such as laparoscopic biopsy from
a designated liver location.

A Meta-Analysis on Performance of TE
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 September 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 9 | e44930

The presence of significant fibrosis ($F2) has been regarded as
an important indicator of chronic liver disease progression to grave
prognosis. Therefore, intervention with antiviral treatment to stop
or slow the disease progression is optimally performed at the time
of identification of significant fibrosis in patients with chronic liver
disease. [51,52] However, the diagnostic accuracy of TE in
predicting significant fibrosis seems imperfect in our study
(AUROC = 0.86), as proved in previous reports examining
patients with CHC. [15–17] Although the combined use of TE
and other serological markers has been investigated to improve the
diagnostic accuracy of distinguishing fibrosis stage $F2 from F0/
1,[12,53] this approach has been unsatisfactory, and histological
evaluation still has a significant role in this condition.
Although the optimal reference cutoff values were established
from our meta-analysis, a cross-sectional comparison between LB
and TE values might be unsatisfactory in providing more clinical
implications. Thus, recent studies have focused on the potential
role of TE as an independent parameter in predicting the future
clinical endpoint in longitudinal follow-up settings. Indeed, the TE
value was significantly associated with the risk of HCC development[50,54] or liver-related events. [55] In addition, TE has
shown superiority to other serological fibrosis prediction models in
predicting HCC or hepatic decompensation. [56] These data
converge into a conclusion that TE can be used as a novel tool to
help predict future prognosis in patients with chronic liver disease,
although cannot fully replace LB as a diagnostic tool.
In conclusion, using the meta-analysis method, this systematic
review focused on the performance of TE for detecting liver
fibrosis in patients with CHB.TE seems to be a good method for
quantifying hepatic fibrosis in these patients, and further
longitudinal studies are required to validate our data.
