Abstract
Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common herpesvirus linked to infectious mononucleosis and multiple cancers.
There are no national estimates of EBV seroprevalence in the United States. Our objective was to estimate the overall
prevalence and sociodemographic predictors of EBV among U.S. children and adolescents aged 6–19.
Methods: We calculated prevalence estimates and prevalence ratios for EBV seroprevalence using data from the 2003–2010
U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for children aged 6–19 (n = 8417). Poisson regression was
used to calculate multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratios across subgroup categories (sex, race/ethnicity, parental
education, household income, household size, foreign-born, BMI, and household smoking).
Findings: Overall EBV seroprevalence was 66.5% (95% CI 64.3%–68.7%.). Seroprevalence increased with age, ranging from
54.1% (95% CI 50.2%–57.9%) for 6–8 year olds to 82.9% (95% CI 80.0%–85.9%) for 18–19 year olds. Females had slightly
higher seroprevalence (68.9%, 95% CI 66.3%–71.6%) compared to males (64.2%, 95% CI 61.7%–66.8%). Seroprevalence was
substantially higher for Mexican-Americans (85.4%, 95% CI 83.1%–87.8%) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (83.1%, 95% CI 81.1%–
85.1%) than Non-Hispanic Whites (56.9%, 95% CI 54.1%–59.8%). Large differences were also seen by family income, with
children in the lowest income quartile having 81.0% (95% CI 77.6%–84.5%) seroprevalence compared to 53.9% (95% CI
50.5%–57.3%) in the highest income quartile, with similar results for parental education level. These results were not
explained by household size, BMI, or parental smoking. Among those who were seropositive, EBV antibody titers were
significantly higher for females, Non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican-Americans, with no association found for socioeconomic
factors.
Conclusions: In the first nationally representative U.S. estimates, we found substantial socioeconomic and race/ethnic
differences in the seroprevalence of EBV across all ages for U.S. children and adolescents. These estimates can help
researchers and clinicians identify groups most at risk, inform research on EBV-cancer etiology, and motivate potential
vaccine development.

Introduction
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is
one of the most common human viruses and once contracted
persists for the lifetime of the person. EBV is generally transferred
through saliva and can infect infants as soon as maternal antibody
protection subsides. Primary infection can occur throughout the
life course, with approximately 90% of the human population
estimated to be infected [1]. However, the age of onset is thought
to vary widely, with developed countries having higher ages at
primary infection, most likely due to better hygienic conditions
and other socioeconomic and demographic factors including
household size and population density [2]. If primary infection
occurs during early childhood, the virus generally causes no
symptoms or is indistinguishable from other common, but mild,
illnesses [2]. However, up to 50% of those who experience primary
infection in later childhood or adolescence may contract infectious
mononucleosis [3], and age at onset may be associated with EBVrelated malignancies [2,4]. Epstein-Barr was the first virus to be
linked to cancer, and has been linked to nearly all cases of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma and important subsets of Burkitt
lymphomas, other non-Hodgkins lymphoma and gastric cancer
[5,6,7,8]. EBV infection or reactivation has also been associated
with lupus [9], multiple sclerosis [10], and cardiovascular
disease[11].

Despite its potential medical and public health burden, to our
knowledge, no national population-based estimates of EBV
prevalence in the U.S. exist. Previous studies focused on special
populations, such as pregnant women [12], or were derived from
relatively small sample sizes in limited geographic areas [13,14,15]
that are therefore not generalizable to the country as a whole;
some still-cited studies are more than forty years old [13,16].
Reliable estimates of EBV prevalence are required to identify
groups most at risk, inform research on EBV-cancer etiology, and
motivate potential vaccine development. Given the previous
findings of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic differences in similar
infections[17], it is important to examine the prevalence of EBV
across diverse socioeconomic and racial groups.
We analyzed publicly-available data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years
2003–2010 to estimate EBV seroprevelance for ages 6–19 in the
U.S. and its association with sociodemographic variables, such as
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household education and income. We
also examined the association of risk factors such as household
size, smoking, and body mass index. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to estimate EBV seroprevalence among U.S. children
and adolescents with nationally representative data.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The current study was secondary analysis of de-identified public
data was determined to be exempt by the Institutional Review
Board of Hunter College.
Data
Data come from the 2003–2010 U.S. National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of the non-institutionalized U.S.
population with oversamples of the elderly, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans. NHANES is conducted annually and
data are publicly released in two-year waves (2003–2004, 2005–
2006, 2007–2008, 2009–2010), providing interview, examination,
and laboratory measures. Trained interviewers, using a computerassisted personal interview system, interviewed participants at
home. Participants were subsequently asked to attend a mobile
examination center, where they were asked to complete additional
questionnaires, undergo various examinations, and to provide
biological specimens, including blood and urine. For children
under 15 years of age, a proxy interview with a parent was
conducted. Additional details of the NHANES survey design have
been published elsewhere [18].
Measures
Serological Testing. EBV antibody testing was conducted
among children 6–19 years who participated in NHANES
between 2003–2010 and had stored serum samples available
(n = 9302). EBV VCA IgG antibody was measured using a
commercial enzyme immunoassay kit (Diamedix, Miami, FL).
Data were recorded as Positive (EIA$1.10), Negative (EIA
index#.90), or Equivocal (0.90,EIA$1.09). The sensitivity of
the assay was 96.6% and the specificity was 97.7%. All QA/QC
procedures recommended by the manufacturer were followed.
Documentation can be accessed at (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes/nhanes2009-2010/SSEBV_F.htm). Equicovals (n = 46)
were excluded from analysis. Six respondents did not have
sufficient serum quantity for the assay, and 833 were excluded for
missing values on covariates, leaving a final sample of 8417.
Covariates
Several sociodemographic variables were examined as predictors of EBV. Reported family income was adjusted for inflation to
the year 2000 using the Consumer Price Index then divided into
income quartiles for analysis. Race/ethnicity was self-reported and
classified as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, MexicanAmerican, and other race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white as the
reference category). Education was measured as the highest level
of education achieved by the head of household and coded as less
than high school, high school completion, or greater than high
school completion. Household size was coded as ,5, 5–6, or .6.
Additional factors that might impact immune function and
susceptibility to EBV were also considered. Since children who
are immigrants may have encountered a different pathogen
environment in utero and early life, we included a variable
indicating whether the child was born inside or outside of the U.S.
Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke may be deleterious to a
child’s immune system, therefore we included a variable indicating
whether the parent reported at least one household smoker. An
increase in adipose tissue has been shown to alter certain immune
parameters [19,20]. BMI was calculated as (kg/m2) from measured
height and weight during the exam and converted to age and sex
specific z-scores based on the 2000 CDC growth charts.[21]. BMI
was then coded as normal/under, overweight, and obese.
Statistical Analysis
Mean prevalence across age groups (6–8, 9–11, 12–14, 15–17,
18–19) was calculated and plotted by race/ethnicity and income
quartiles. Next, unadjusted prevalence ratios were calculated
directly from tabulation of prevalence rates across categories of
covariates. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to determine
whether the key sociodemographic variables (age, sex, and race/
ethnicity, household income, education, and household size) as
well as physical risk factors (BMI and household smoking) were
predictors of EBV seroprevalence in fully adjusted models. Results
are reported in prevalence estimates and prevalence ratios. As a
secondary analysis, we also examined the association of our
covariates with continuous (logged) EBV antibody titers among
those seropositive using linear regression. All analyses were
adjusted for sample weights and NHANES complex survey design
using Stata (11.2).
Results
Table 1 shows descriptive characteristics of the overall sample.
The overall seroprevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for
children aged 6–19 in the United States was 66.5% (95% CI
64.3%–68.7% (Table 2)). This ranged from 54.1% among 6–8
year-olds (95% CI 50.2%–57.9%) to 82.9% (80.0%–85.9%)
among 18-19-year-olds. Males were slightly less likely to be
infected than females (64.2% vs. 68.9%). Higher unadjusted
prevalence was seen for non-white children and those with lower
household income and education, children born outside the U.S.,
obese children, children with a smoker in the house, and children
living in a larger household. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate trends in
seroprevalence across age broken down by race/ethnicity (Figure
1) and income quartile (Figure 2).
Models in Table 3 were adjusted first for age, sex, and race
(Model 1) and then the full set of covariates (Model 2). In the fully
adjusted model, socioeconomic status and other risk factors
accounted for a portion but not all of the increased EBV
seroprevalence for non-white children and adolescents [PR for
blacks: 1.33 (95% CI: 1.26–1.41); PR for Mexican Americans:
1.37 (95% CI: 1.28–1.46); PR for ‘‘other’’ races: 1.22 (95% CI:

1.13–1.31)]. Parental socioeconomic status remained an important
predictor of EBV net of other factors: children with parents who
completed less than high school had higher levels of EBV
seroprevalence compared to those with parents who had
completed more than high school [PR: 1.10 (95% CI: 1.03–
1.17)] (Table 3), and the lowest quartile of household income was
associated with a striking 23% higher prevalence compared to
those in the highest income quartile [PR 1.23, CI: 1.15–1.31]
(Tables 2 and 3). While being obese compared to normal weight
was still associated with a 3% higher EBV prevalence, the
association was no longer statistically significant in the adjusted
models (PR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96–1.11). Larger family size and
having a smoker in the household remained significantly
associated with higher seroprevalence in fully-adjusted models,
suggesting that family size and smoking may have an independent
impact on acquiring EBV that is not accounted for by other
sociodemographic factors.
Higher EBV antibody titers have been associated with increased
risk of onset of EBV-related malignancies[22,23], therefore we also
examined the correlates of (logged) EBV antibody titers among
those who were seropositive as a secondary analysis. In fully
adjusted models, males had significantly lower EBV antibody titers

compared to women, and Blacks and Mexican-Americans had
higher antibody titers compared to whites. No differences in
antibody titer were seen by age, BMI, parental education or
household income.
Discussion
In the United States, Epstein-Barr virus seroprevalence was
estimated to be approximately 66.5% among children ages 6–19
(58.5% for children 6–12 and 73.4% for those 12–19) in the
United Sates for 2003–2010. National estimates of EBV
seroprevalence for any country are rare, and to our knowledge
these are the first nationally representative EBV prevalence
estimates for the United States. McDade, et al. found an EBV
prevalence of 80.1% in a group of 9–13 year olds participating in
the Great Smoky Mountains Study [15], while Matro, et al, found
a 67% seroprevalence among a sample of children aged 3–17
years seen in Georgia hospitals for illness or routine care[14]. This
seroprevalence is lower than that found in developing countries
worldwide, where it is estimated more than 90% of the population
is infected in early childhood [24,25,26,27]. The seroprevalence is
comparable to those found in non-representative samples in
Western, developed countries—in England, 45% of 5–9 year olds
[28] and Germany, 74% for 3–17 year olds[14]. Given the scarcity
of national estimates, our findings will provide a valuable baseline
for tracking trends in future EBV prevalence among U.S. children.
We observed large differences in EBV seroprevalance by race/
ethnicity, with Mexican American children having the highest
seroprevalence (85.4%) followed by non-Hispanic blacks (83.1%),
and whites (56.9%). The observed differences by race/ethnicity
were slightly reduced but not explained by household socioeconomic status, with both remaining strong independent predictors
of EBV risk. These differences were also not accounted for by risk
factors such as household size, BMI, or having a smoker in the
household. EBV seroprevelance differences by race/ethnicity have
previously been identified in several studies from the 1970s,
including between black and white U.S. military cadets [29] and
among different ethnic groups in Hawaii [13]. The significant
differences in EBV seroprevalence by household income and
education as well as race/ethnicity among U.S. children are
consistent with differences previously identified for cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus -1 (HSV-1), Helicobacter Pylori,
Hepatitis A, and Hepatitis B [17,30]. It is well known that
socioeconomic status (SES) is consistently associated with adult
health outcomes. The timing of primary infection with EBV may
be important for the etiology of EBV-related malignancies [31],
and thus differences in the timing of acquisition by social variables
could be important for understanding later links to cancer onset in
adulthood. Specifically, EBV-related Hodgkins lymphoma risk in
young adulthood is associated with infectious mononucleosis
indicative of delayed acquisition of EBV [32], while early-life
acquisition is believed to be associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma
and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [22,33,34]. The observed differences in EBV seroprevalence and antibody response by race/
ethnicity identified in this study may help shed light on different
prevalence and age patterns of EBV-related diseases by race/
ethnicity in the U.S [35].
Future work should examine the sources of differential rates of
seropositivity among U.S. children. With current NHANES data,
it is impossible to distinguish whether different rates are a result of
increased exposure, increased susceptibility, or both. EBV is believed
to be primarily transmitted through saliva, though may also be
transmitted via blood transfusions, sexual intercourse, or urine
[31]. While household size was associated with an increased
likelihood of infection, it did not alter the relationship between
SES or race/ethnicity and EBV seroprevalence. It is possible that
in groups with historically higher rates of infection who
predominantly live and work together, higher levels would persist
over time. Environmental factors associated with socioeconomic
status, such as household crowding or use of public transportation,
could contribute directly to exposure risk. Suppressed immune
function as a result of stress, poor nutrition, smoking, or other
environmental exposures could increase susceptibility to infections
given equal levels of exposure. Low social status as well as
indicators of psychosocial stress can impact risk of respiratory
infections in humans and other primates in experimental studies
[36,37,38,39,40]. Less is known about the links between social
status, stress, and susceptibility to infections in the broader U.S.
population. Low social class was associated with lower secretory
immunoglobulin (sIgA), cited as a first line of defense against
infection, in a large community sample in Scotland [41]. Taken

together, these studies suggest that psychological stress associated
with lower social status could down-regulate various aspects of the
cellular immune response, increasing susceptibility to infection.
Future work should aim to build evidence regarding the sources of
such early differences in infection rates.
EBV is the cause of infectious mononucleosis and has been
linked to certain types of cancers. The burden of EBV in the US
population ages 6–19 is substantial. Large racial/ethnic disparities
in EBV are not explained by socioeconomic status or other factors
that could impact transmission such as household size. Future
work should examine the factors associated with race/ethnic and
socioeconomic differences in EBV acquisition prevalence among
children in the US.
