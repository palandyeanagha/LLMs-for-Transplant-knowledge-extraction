Many second-line therapies are recently approved for patients with advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), in whom protein malnutrition is prevalent that would afect treatment outcomes. 
In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of pre-sarcopenia and muscle restoration in patients 
with sorafenib-failed advanced HCC. From August 2012 to March 2017, 385 patients who developed 
radiology-proven HCC progression after sorafenib treatment were enrolled in the study. Presarcopenia is defned as transverse psoas muscle thickness per body height< 16.8 mm/m, which was 
prevalent (64.7%) in our patients. Age > 60 years, female gender, and body mass index< 22 kg/m2
 were 
independent predictors to the development of pre-sarcopenia. Patients with muscle depletion had 
signifcantly worse post-progression survival (PPS) compared with their counterparts (median PPS: 
3.8 vs. 5.8 months, p = 0.003), particularly in those with intermediate liver reserves (Child–Pugh class 
B or Albumin-bilirubin grade 2). Besides, pre-sarcopenia independently predicted post-progression 
mortality in sorafenib-failed HCC (hazard ratio: 1.340, p = 0.012). In patients who developed presarcopenia before sorafenib treatment, muscle restoration was associated with a longer PPS 
compared with their counterparts (6.3 vs. 3.6 months, p = 0.043). In conclusion, pre-sarcopenia 
independently determined the outcomes of sorafenib-failed HCC. Nutrition support to restore muscle 
mass would prolong survival for higher-risk patients.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the sixth most common cancer and the fourth cause of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide, with increased incidence to nearly 750,000 new cases per year1,2
. In general, the prognosis 
of HCC is relatively dismal because only 46% of patients can be diagnosed at an early stage, and most patients 
require systemic therapy for the unresectable, advanced-staged disease2,3
. Sorafenib is the frst approved systemic 
treatment for advanced HCC; but its efects are still modest4,5
. Recently, several positive results from the frst and 
second-line phase 3 trials enable HCC patients to new treatment options6–8
. Maintenance of good liver reserve 
and performance status at disease progression, which are generally measured by Child–Pugh class, ALBI grade 
or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, are important for longer survival with second-line 
therapy2,6,9,10.
Depletion of muscle and decline of muscle strength are common in patients with advanced liver disease and 
malignancies, which are reported in association with cachexia and indicated as prognostic factors for them11–15. 
A signifcant proportion of patients with HCC were observed as malnourished or at a high risk of malnutrition, 
which remarkably afected clinical outcomes16. In parallel with liver dysfunction and enlargement of tumor 
size, skeletal muscle decreases profoundly in patients with advance HCC17. Presence of muscle depletion can 
lead to physical disability and is associated with poor prognosis in these patients18–20. According to previous 
studies, pre-sarcopenia, which is defned as low skeletal muscle mass assessed by computed tomography (CT) 
scan, can predict the prognosis of HCC in patients treated with sorafenib18–23. However, whether this objective, 
quantitative surrogate marker of performance status can predict post-progression prognosis in sorafenib-failed 
patients is still unclear. In addition, factors linked to pre-sarcopenia must be identifed. In this study, we aimed 
to investigate the role of muscle mass depletion in HCC patients who failed sorafenib treatment as well as the 
risk factors for the presence of pre-sarcopenia in these patients.
Results
Demographic characteristics of the study cohort. According to the value of transverse psoas muscle 
thickness per body height (TPMT/BH), which was measured from the CT scan image at the level of umbilicus, 
249 patients (64.7%) showed pre-sarcopenia at the time of sorafenib treatment failure. Compared with patients 
with normal muscle mass, patients with the presence of pre-sarcopenia at HCC progression were signifcantly 
older (patients with pre-sarcopenia vs. patients with normal muscle mass: 64.0±12.4 vs. 61.4±13.5 years old, 
p=0.029), predominantly female (25.7% vs. 14.0%, p=0.009), lower in body mass index (BMI) (23.0±3.8 vs. 
25.0±4.1, p<0.001), more prevalent in chronic hepatitis C infection (30.1% vs. 16.9%, p=0.005), with larger 
tumor size (6.6 vs. 5.5 cm, p=0.015), and associated with shorter duration of sorafenib treatment (median treatment duration: 67 vs. 80 days, p=0.026).
Regarding functional liver reserve, presence of pre-sarcopenia was signifcantly associated with prolonged 
prothrombin time (international normalized ratio [INR]: 1.15 vs. 1.09, p=0.001), lower serum albumin level (3.2 
vs. 3.4 g/dL, p=0.011), and a higher incidence of ascites formation (49.2% vs. 39.7%, p=0.018). Afer sorafenib 
treatment failure, most patients received the best supportive care from August 2012 to March 2017. No signifcant 
diference in post-progression treatment was identifed according to the patients’ muscle status. Detailed characteristics of patients with progressive disease (PD) of HCC afer sorafenib treatment are presented in Table 1.
Factors associated with pre‑sarcopenia in sorafenib‑failed HCC. In Table 2, age>60 years (odds 
ratio [OR]: 1.796; 95% CI 1.126–2.863, p=0.014), female gender (OR: 1.877; 95% CI 1.774–3.220, p=0.045), and 
BMI<22 kg/m2
 (OR: 4.116; 95% CI 2.216–7.646, p<0.001) were independent predictors of pre-sarcopenia in 
sorafenib-failed HCC by multivariate analysis.
According to the beta coefcient values in multivariate analysis, a scoring system was established to predict 
the presence of pre-sarcopenia in sorafenib-failed HCC by incorporating gender, age, and BMI at HCC progression. Patients with scores>0 had a signifcantly higher risk of pre-sarcopenia (p<0.001). In addition, the risk 
and prevalence of pre-sarcopenia increased in alignment with these scores (Fig. 1).
Post‑progression survival (PPS) Associated with Pre‑sarcopenia. Following progression of 
4.2 months (interquartile range: 1.9–9.6), 358 deaths occurred with the median PPS as 4.2 months (95% CI: 
3.6–4.9). Patients presented with pre-sarcopenia while HCC progression had signifcantly worse PPS than others without remarkable muscle depletion (median PPS: 3.8 vs. 5.8 months, p=0.003) (Fig. 2). Among patients 
who had normal muscle mass before sorafenib treatment (n=194), the presence of pre-sarcopenia at PD suggested a shorter PPS than muscle maintainers (4.1 vs. 5.6 months, p=0.112). In patients with the presence of 
pre-sarcopenia before sorafenib treatment (n=191), reversal of pre-sarcopenia while tumor progression was 
signifcantly associated with a longer PPS compared with their counterparts (6.3 vs. 3.6 months, p=0.043) (Supplementary Fig. 1).

As shown in Fig. 3A–C, the presence of pre-sarcopenia at PD signifcantly determined PPS in patients at 
Child–Pugh class B while HCC progression (3.4 vs. 2.2 months, p=0.016). However, PPS was not signifcantly 
diferent based on muscle status in patients at Child–Pugh A or C. Similar results were also noted by evaluating 
liver function according to the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade. Te PPS was signifcantly better in patients with 
ALBI grade 2 with normal muscle mass versus those with the presence of pre-sarcopenia (6.3 vs. 4.2 months, 
p=0.009). Nevertheless, the muscle-dependent survival diference was not observed in patients at ALBI grade 
1 or 3 while tumor progression (Fig. 3D–F).
Prognostic factors associated with PPS. Independent factors associated with PPS were determined by 
multivariate analysis. To avoid the efect of collinearity, Child–Pugh class and ALBI grade were not included in 
the same multivariate model. For the analysis of model 1 (Table 3), presence of pre-sarcopenia at PD (hazard 
ratio [HR]: 1.404; 95% CI 1.112–1.773, p=0.004), maximal tumor size>7 cm (HR: 1.722; 95% CI 1.356–2.186,

Discussion
Tis is the frst study to investigate the role of muscle wasting in sorafenib-failed HCC. Unlike a previous study 
that enrolled patients at diferent tumor stage19, our patients were homogenous in tumor status. Te results of 
this large cohort study indicated that the presence of pre-sarcopenia was associated with a poor outcome in 
patients with sorafenib-failed advanced HCC. In addition, we identifed older age (>60 years), female gender, 
and lower BMI value (<22 kg/m2
) while sorafenib failure were independent predictors for the presence of presarcopenia. Tese fndings implied nutrition replacement to maintain muscle mass could prolong survival for 
higher-risk patients.

Malnutrition is common in patients with cancer or advanced liver disease and could signifcantly afect their 
prognosis11,24. To evaluate nutrition status in patients with advanced liver disease or cancer, body composition 
is more important than body weight because the increased weight could be composed of additional water in 
the form of ascites or edema24. Muscle status is a reliable surrogate for nutrition status and physical activity. 
Unlike ECOG performance status and the subjective classifcation of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy in the 
Child–Pugh system, which are traditionally adopted in the assessment and management of HCC, muscle mass 
status is an objective and quantitative factor to evaluate the patients’ general condition. According to the clinical trials in France and Canada, 27.5–30% of HCC patients had muscle depletion25,26. In advanced HCC, the 
prevalence of muscle wasting was reported as 49% and 65.1% in the Italian and Japanese cohorts, respectively19,20. 
According to previous studies, skeletal muscle depletion did not infuence overall survival among patients with 
early or intermediate-staged HCC15. However, it was suggested as an independent predictor of mortality in 
patients with unresectable HCC, who were undergoing sorafenib therapy18–22. In our study with much more

patient numbers, the prevalence of pre-sarcopenia (muscle depletion) was 49.6% at the initiation of sorafenib 
treatment, and increased to 64.7% with the development of progressive disease. Presence of pre-sarcopenia also 
independently predicted a poor PPS in HCC patients who failed sorafenib treatment. In addition, the survivalpredictive role of pre-sarcopenia was more signifcant in patients with larger tumor size, early PD, extrahepatic 
metastasis, and progressive vascular invasion of advanced HCC. Tese fndings suggested that muscle depletion 
deteriorates in line with tumor stage and has to get more serious concern in patients with advanced tumors.
Similar to previous Japanese studies, in which unremarkable association between Child–Pugh class and 
muscle mass depletion was reported15,18, no signifcant diferences in liver function could be observed according 
to our patients’ muscle status. Muscle wasting was found to predict mortality in cirrhotic patients at Child–Pugh 
class A and B27. In our cohort, the presence of pre-sarcopenia was associated with a signifcantly worse PPS, 
particularly in patients at Child–Pugh B or ALBI grade 2 while sorafenib failure. Independent of liver reserves, 
we still identifed older age, female gender, and lower BMI as predictors of pre-sarcopenia in HCC patients who 
failed sorafenib treatment. Te prevalence of muscle depletion was similarly demonstrated to increase with older 
age and decreased BMI28,29. In our cohort, signifcant reduction of BMI and increased ascites formation were 
observed in pre-sarcopenic patients. Te presence of ascites could overestimate the value of BMI; but it did not 
afect the risk of muscle loss in patients with BMI≥22 kg/m2
. In contrast, a signifcant risk of pre-sarcopenia 
was identifed in patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2
, even along with the bias of ascites. On the other 
hand, muscle depletion was more prevalent in female HCC patients in our study. Tis fnding was similar to the 
results from previous studies15,20. Yet, we observed that the association between the presence of pre-sarcopenia 
and worse PPS was much more signifcant in the male patients. Female patients, usually with an abundance of 
adipose tissue, generate energy preferentially from fat that might account for the ostensible resistance to muscle 
loss compared to the male patients17,30.
In our cohort, patients who sustained normal muscle mass from the beginning of sorafenib treatment to 
treatment failure had better PPS than those who developed pre-sarcopenia. Impressively, the initially pre-sarcopenic patients who increased muscle mass during sorafenib treatment and relieved from pre-sarcopenia were 
observed to have signifcantly longer PPS compared with others who kept in muscle depletion. Tese fndings 
suggested the potential therapeutic strategy of nutrition intervention to prevent muscle wasting and improve 
clinical outcomes of advanced HCC. In addition to hand-foot syndrome, gastrointestinal adverse events, such 
as anorexia, vomiting and dyspepsia are also common in sorafenib-treated patients4,5
. Besides, sorafenib might 
inhibit carnitine absorption and also lead to pre-sarcopenia31. All of these adverse events could exacerbate protein energy malnutrition and associate with poorer survival of HCC patients16. Terefore, aggressive nutrition 
intervention and lifestyle modifcation are important in patients with sorafenib-treated HCC to improve their 
prognosis. Several studies have suggested that supplementation of branched-chain amino-acids may be useful 
in maintaining liver reserves and benefcial to patients treated with sorafenib32,33. Exercise therapy might be also 
promising in preventing skeletal muscle depletion34, but further investigations with large cohorts are still needed.
Imaging-based defnitions of muscle depletion were diverse and not yet standardized until now. Status of muscle mass could be measured by a cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle35, TPMT at the level of the umbilicus

normalized by body height36, and the third lumbar vertebra muscle index37,38. Among these indices, the psoas 
cross-sectional area and the third lumbar vertebral muscle index could only be measured by the commercialized 
sofware with limited accessibility. In contrast, measurement of TPMT is accessible on most CT scan images 
without special sofware. According to previous studies36,39, muscle depletion defned by the value of TPMT/
height less than 16.8 mm/m indicated a higher mortality rate in cirrhotic patients independent of the MELD and 
MELD-Na scores. Tis measurement was strongly correlated with the third lumbar vertebral muscle index. In 
addition to CT scan, measurement of muscle mass from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the level of 
the third vertebrae was recently reported to have good survival prediction in decompensated cirrhotic patients40. 
In our study, we measured TPMT/height on CT scan or MRI to evaluate muscle status of our patients. As this 
measurement could be obtained from radiological images regularly performed for staging purposes or followup, it could be promoted in clinical practice to overcome intrinsic limits of bioimpedance and anthropometric 
measurements, which were hampered by elevated BMI and ascites20.
Tere are several limitations in this study. First, this is a retrospective study that only enrolled patients treated 
in a single hospital. However, our hospital is the leading tertiary medical center in Taiwan with strict regulations. 
Te information bias would be ameliorated by regular tumor reassessment by radiological images and clinical 
evaluation. In addition, it is so far the largest real-life Asian cohort of patients with advanced HCC who failed 
frst-line sorafenib treatment. It is also the frst study to demonstrate the prognosis-predicting role of pre-sarcopenia in these patients. Second, the muscle strength evaluation, such as hand grip strength and walking speed12, 
which is usually regarded as a diagnostic criterion for sarcopenia was not assessed due to the retrospective design 
of our study. Tird, we could not obtain information about daily calorie intake or nutrition support from our 
patients. Even dietitian consulting would be applied for all patients at high risk of malnutrition, some of them 
could restore muscle mass during cancer treatment, but others kept muscle wasting. Tis fnding suggested the 
diverse implementation rate and efectiveness of nutrition support, and highlighted the unmet need of nutrition 
intervention in these patients. Fourth, most of our patients had chronic hepatitis B or C. Whether our results 
could be applied to other patients with underlying alcoholic liver disease is still undetermined.
In conclusion, pre-sarcopenia independently determined the prognosis of sorafenib-failed HCC particularly 
in patients with intermediate liver reserves. Building muscle mass would be important for patients at higher risk 
of pre-sarcopenia to improve survival.
Materials and methods
Selection of patients. From August 2012 to March 2017, 385 consecutive patients who experienced progressive disease afer sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC in Taipei Veterans General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were initially diagnosed according to the criteria of American Association for the 
Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) treatment guidelines for HCC41. According to the strict reimbursement regulations in Taiwan, patients at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C and Child–Pugh class A with portal 
vein invasion or extrahepatic metastasis were approved for sorafenib treatment9
. PD was defned according to 
the followed CT scan or MRI which was performed every two months afer the start of sorafenib treatment42. 
Patterns of PD were classifed as intrahepatic or extrahepatic tumor growth (>20% increase in tumor size of 
the preexisting lesions), and new intrahepatic or extrahepatic lesions43. Progressive macrovascular invasion was 
defned as PD in vascular tumor thrombus without newly developed intrahepatic or extrahepatic lesion or progression of existed tumor. Tis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and current 
ethical guidelines. It was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital 
(IRB No.: 2019-07-038BC). Informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital due to the retrospective design and most enrolled patients had died.
Defnition, clinical assessments and outcomes. Muscle mass status was assessed by measuring TPMT on CT 
scan or MRI at the level of the umbilicus36,44. Te value of TPMT/BH less than 16.8 mm/m was defned as presarcopenia36. In this study, we retrospectively calculated TPMT/BH at the beginning of sorafenib treatment and 
at tumor PD recognized by image studies. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory exams, including hemogram, serum chemistry, AFP level, as well as Child–Pugh class, ALBI grade, and ECOG performance status were 
evaluated when PD was confrmed. Te PPS was measured from the date of radiology-proven PD to the date of 
death.
Statistical analysis. Continuous variables were expressed as mean±standard deviation or median (interquartile ranges), while categorical variables were analyzed as frequency and percentages. Te Pearson chi-square 
analysis or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables, while the Student t-test or Mann–Whitney U test was applied for continuous variables. Te predictive power of a score to predict pre-sarcopenia was 
assessed using the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). Survival was estimated by the 
Kaplan–Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Additionally, Cox’s proportional-hazard model was 
used to identify prognostic factors of survival. For all analyses, p<0.05 was considered statistically signifcant. 
All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Statistics v. 17.0 for 
Windows, Armonk, NY, USA).
