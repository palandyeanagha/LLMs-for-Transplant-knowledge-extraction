A B S T R A C T Rats were made chronically hyperammonemic by portal-systemic shunting and, 8 wk
later, were subjected to acute ammonia intoxication
by the intraperitoneal injection of 5.2 mmol/kg of
ammonium acetate. In free-ranging animals, ammonia
treatment induced a brief period of precoma (10-15
min) that progressed into deep, anesthetic coma lasting for several hours and was associated with a high
mortality. In paralyzed, artificially ventilated animals
that were lightly anesthetized with nitrous oxide,
acute ammonia intoxication caused major disturbances
of cerebral carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy
metabolism that correlated in time with the change in
functional state. At 10 min after injection (precoma),
the concentrations of most glycolytic intermediates
were increased, as was the lactate/pyruvate ratio.
Citrate declined, despite a twofold rise in pyruvate,
suggesting that the conversion of pyruvate to citrate
had been impaired. Concentrations of phosphocreatine, and of the putative neurotransmitters, glutamate and aspartate, declined during precoma, but
the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides in the
cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain stem
remained within normal limits. At 60 min after injection (coma), ATP declined in all regions of brain;
the reduction in total high-energy phosphates was most
notable in the brain stem. The findings indicate that
cerebral dysfunction in chronic, relapsing ammonia
intoxication is not due to primary energy failure.
Rather, it is suggested that ammonia-induced depletion
of glutamic and aspartic acids, and inhibition of the

INTRODUCTION
Portal-systemic shunting is an important prerequisite
for cerebral dysfunction in chronic liver disease (2, 3).
The intestinal venous blood circumventing the liver
permits potential toxins generated in the gut to enter
the systemic circulation, thereby gaining access to the
brain. Among the many toxic factors that have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, ammonia continues to be the leading candidate
(4, 5). Randomly measured ammonia concentrations
in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)l of patients
with hepatic encephalopathy are almost always abnormally increased (6), and it is well documented
that the administration of ammonium salts to patients
with compromised liver function or extensive portalsystemic shunting may provoke episodic stupor and
coma (7, 8). Moreover, an elevated concentration of
ammonia in brain is a consistent finding in a variety
of metabolic encephalopathies including hypoxic
hypoxia (9), hypoglycemia (10, 11), hypercapnic
acidosis (12, 13), cerebral ischemia (14, 15), and fluoroacetate poisoning (16), leading several investigators
to suggest that the accumulation of ammonia in brain
may contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders
(10, 17). However, the mechanism by which ammonia
cauises brain dysfunction is unknown.
The effects of acute ammonia intoxication on
cerebral metabolism have been examined experimentally in several laboratories (18-21), but acute
hyperammonemia in normal animals may not be relevant to the pathophysiology of human hepatic encephalopathy since the brain in severe liver disease is
more susceptible to various kinds of metabolic disI Abbreviations used in this paper: CSF, cerebrospinal
fluid; PC, portacaval.

turbances (3). At present, there is no ideal experimental model of chronic hepatic encephalopathy.
Animals with a portacaval anastomosis allow one
important aspect of liver disease to be investigated,
i.e., the cerebral complications of chronic portalsystemic shunting. Accordingly, we studied the effects
of an acute ammonia challenge on cerebral carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism in rats
that had been subjected to portal-systemic shunting
for 8 wk. The experiments mimic the situation in
patients with liver by-pass who suffer from superimposed ammonia intoxication owing either to acute
gastrointestinal bleeding or a sudden increase in protein intake. The findings indicate that, similar to events
in man, degrees of ammonia loading that produce mild
cerebral dysfunction in normal animals induce behavioral encephalopathy and a high morbidity in portacaval animals. Concurrently, the brain undergoes
three major neurochemical abnormalities: the conversion of pyruvate to citrate is impaired; the putative
neurotransmitters, glutamate and aspartate, are depleted; and high energy phosphates decline, presumably secondary to inhibition ofthe malate-aspartate
hydrogen shuttle.
METHODS
Operative techniques. Adult male Wistar rats, weighing
250-350 g, were anesthetized with ether, and an end-to-side
portacaval (PC) anastomosis was constructed according to
the procedure described by Lee and Fisher (22). Shamoperated rats, matched for weight, were similarly anesthetized and a laparotomy was performed; the inferior vena
cava and portal vein were isolated, simultaneously occluded
for 20 min and then released, but no shunt was constructed.
No antibiotics were administered. Postoperatively, all
animals were housed in a germ-free, laminar air-flow room
and fed ordinary rat pellets and water ad lib. During the
1st-postoperative wk, shunted animals lost weight (approximately 8-10%o), but thereafter increased in body weight
over the ensuing 7 to 15 wk period. At the time of sacrifice,
there were no marked differences in weight gain between
the shunted and sham-operated groups, a finding in agreement with observations of Holmin and Siesjo (23). The overall
mortality in the shunted series was less than 10%.
Experimental design. All metabolic studies were carried
out on paralyzed, artificially ventilated animals that were
lightly anesthetized with nitrous oxide. The rats were
briefly anesthetized with ether, tracheotomized, and mechanically ventilated with oxygen-nitrous oxide (25-75%)
by a Harvard respirator. (Harvard Apparatus Co. Inc., Millis,
Mass.) Paralysis was achieved with d-tubocurarine chloride
(2 mg/kg, IM). The tail artery was cannulated for continuous
blood pressure monitoring and for anaerobic sampling of
blood. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0+0.50C
by a thermistor-controlled heating lamp. The skull and the
atlanto-occipital membrane were exposed through a midline
incision, and a small plastic funnel was sutured over the
exposed calvarium for subsequent freezing of the brain
in situ.
When the animals had achieved a normocapnic respiratory
steady state (PaO2> 80 mm Hg; PaCO2 38.5±+1.2 mm Hg;
pHa 7.39-7.41) and were normotensive (mean arterial blood
pressure > 100 mm Hg), some sham-operated controls and
animals with PC shunts of 3, 8, or 16 wk duration were
sacrificed by pouring liquid nitrogen into the cranial funnel
to freeze the brain in situ. Other animals that had been
shunted for 8 wk were injected intraperitoneally with either
ammonium acetate (5.2 mmol/kg dissolved in physiological
saline) or an equimolar amount of sodium acetate. Experimental animals were sacrificed at 10 and 60 min after
ammonium acetate injection by freezing their brains in situ
with liquid nitrogen; PC-shunted control rats were frozen
60 min after the injection of sodium acetate. Immediately
before sacrifice, samples of arterial blood and cisternal CSF
were withdrawn for chemical analysis and frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Frozen specimens of brain, blood, and CSF were
stored at -80°C until extracted and analyzed.
Spontaneous behavior after the intraperitoneal injection
of ammonium or sodium acetate (5.2 mmol/kg) was evaluated
in 17 unparalyzed, unanesthetized rats that had PC shunts
of 8 wk duration. No physiological monitoring was performed on this group.
Extractions and analytical procedures. The frozen brains
were dissected in a -20°C room under intermittent irrigation with liquid nitrogen. Three major regions were taken
for analysis: cerebral hemispheres (entire forebrain anterior
to a mid-collicular cut excluding the olfactory lobes),
cerebellum, and brain stem (portion extending from the caudal
medulla oblongata to the inferior colliculus). The tissues
were extracted by the procedure of Nelson et al. (24) as
modified by Folbergrova et al. (12). The frozen specimens
(100-200 mg) were weighed at -200C and transferred to
homogenization tubes containing 2 vol of 0.1 N HCI in
methanol. The mixtures were homogenized at -20°C, then
warmed to 0°C and diluted with 5 vol of ice-cold 0.3 M
HCI04 containing 1.0 mM EDTA. The mixtures were rehomogenized and centrifuged (8,000g) for 30 min at 0°C.
The supematant fluids were removed and the tissue pellets
were again suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.3 M HC104 containing
1.0 mM EDTA, and homogenized at 0°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant fluids from both extraction steps were
pooled and neutralized with a solution of 1.5 M KOH,
0.4 M imidazole (low-fluorescence grade), and 0.3 M KCI to a
final pH of 6.8-7.0. Precipitated KCG04 was removed by
centrifugation, and the neutralized extracts were stored
at -80°C until analyzed.
Frozen samples (about 100 mg) of whole blood and CSF
were deproteinized with 5 vol of 0.6 M HCl04 at 0°C.
Neutralized extracts of these samples were prepared and
stored as described for the brain specimens.
Methods of assay. Substrates were measured fluorometrically with 1 ml of reagent that contained a pyridine nucleotide and appropriate enzymes and cofactors. Ammonia was
determined with glutamic dehydrogenase according to the
procedure of Folbergrova et al. (25); lactate was determined
with lactic dehydrogenase as described by Vannucci and
Duffy (26). Aspartate and alanine were measured according
to the conditions reported by Duffy et al. (27). Glutamine
was assayed as glutamate after incubation (370C) of 4.1
,ul of extract (equivalent to 0.3 mg of brain) with 150 IlI
of 100 mM citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 20
Ag/ml of Escherichia coli glutaminase; other conditions
were as described by Vergara et al. (18). All other substances, except for asparagine and y-aminobutyrate, were
determined according to the methods of Lowry and Passonneau (29).
For asparagine, a two-step fluorometric modification of the
method of Bergmeyer et al. (30) was adopted. In the first
step, endogenous tissue aspartate was removed by incubation

of 20 ,ul of extract (equivalent to 1.5 mg of brain) with
125 ,ul of a reagent consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2),
3.0 mM a-ketoglutarate, 0.075 mM NADH, 0.005% (wtlvol)
bovine serum albumin, 10 ,g/ml of heart malic dehydrogenase, and 22 ,ug/ml of heart glutamic-oxalacetic aminotransferase. After 10 min at room temperature, the mixtures
were acidified with 3.16 ul of 6 N HCI and incubated
(37°C) an additional 10 min to destroy residual NADH.
(Asparagine is stable under these conditions; even in 1 N
HCI at 37°C, the rate of hydrolysis of asparagine does not
exceed 1%/h [31].) In the second step, the acid mixtures
were diluted with 1.0 ml of a reagent consisting of 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 0.75 ,uM NADH, 0.1 mM a-ketoglutarate,
and 9 ,ug/ml of malic dehydrogenase. After reading the
fluorescence, 0.1 Ag of E. coli asparaginase was added
and the decrease in fluorescence was measured when the
reaction was completed (30 min).
y-Aminobutyrate (GABA) was measured with a partially
purified, cell-free preparation from Pseudomonasfluorescens
that contained both y-aminobutyrate aminotransferase and
NADP-dependent succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase activities (32). The reagent consisted of 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.4), 0.04 mM NADP, 0.1 mM a-ketoglutarate, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Extract equivalent
to 2 mg of brain was added and the fluorescence change
induced by the addition of 0.13 mg of Gabase (in 50%
glycerol, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was determined.
Reagents. Enzymes were obtained from Boehringer
Mannheim Corp. (New York), except for beef heart lactic
dehydrogenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold,
N. J.) and Gabase (Sigma Chemical Co.). Substrates used
as standards were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. in
the highest purity available.
RESULTS
Ammonium ion and free amino acid levels after
PC-shunting. Sustained hyperammonemia is a wellknown effect of portal-systemic shunting in man
(8) and animals (33, 34). PC shunting in rats caused
a 2-2.5-fold increase in the ammonia content of brain,
blood, and cisternal CSF that persisted for 16 wk
(Fig. 1). Concentrations of ammonia were always
highest in brain, the single exception being at 16 wk
when the brain and blood values were similar. Concentrations of ammonia were lowest in CSF and
averaged approximately 65% of the blood ammonia
level.
PC shunting was also associated with changes in the
concentrations of several amino acids ofbrain (Table 1),

notably those involved in cerebral ammonia metabolism. Thus, glutamate declined and glutamine more
than doubled by 3 wk after shunting, and these differences persisted for 16 wk. Despite the decrease in
glutamate, no changes in brain y-aminobutyrate
could be demonstrated. Since the biochemical abnormalities of elevated ammonia and glutamine and
decreased glutamate in brain were maximal at 8 wk
after shunting, and because a comparable length of
time (i.e., more than 5 wk) is required to demonstrate
Alzheimer's glial changes in the brains of PC rats
(35, 36), animals shunted for 8 wk were chosen for
subsequent studies of the behavioral and metabolic
effects of an acute ammonia challenge.
Behavioral responses to ammonia loading. The
intraperitoneal injection of a small dose of ammonium
acetate (5.2 mmol/kg) into 10 rats with PC shunts of 8
wk duration produced in all animals toxic manifestations (decreased locomotion, multifocal myoclonus)
within 2-5 min. After 10 min, the animals became
drowsy although responsive to noxious stimuli (precomatose state), and by 15-30 min they lapsed into a
deep, anesthetic coma that lasted from 2 to 5 h. Electroencephalograms obtained from three animals
showed progressive slowing to a predominant frequency of 4-5 Hz accompanied by triphasic waves
similar to those observed in human beings with hepatic
coma. 4 of the 10 rats died, but none within 1 h after
injection. It is noteworthy that no animal exhibited
the tonic-clonic convulsions that characterize acute
ammonia intoxication in previously unexposed animals
(37). Thus, the behavioral response of PC rats to ammonia loading could be separated into two welldefined stages of cerebral dysfunction, i.e., precoma
and coma. Therefore, these functional states were
correlated with the metabolic status of the brain over
the same time period (10 and 60 min after ammonium
acetate injection; see below).
The toxic manifestations observed in sham-operated
rats injected with ammonium acetate (5.2 mmol/kg,
i.p.) were more benign and transient than those observed in rats with PC shunts. The initial reactions
were similar, i.e., drowsiness and myoclonus within
minutes after injection, but only four out of seven animals became unresponsive and all four of these regained consciousness after 45 min. All survived. Rats
with PC shunts that were injected with an equimolar
amount of sodium acetate showed no toxic symptoms.
Concentrations of aminoniurn iotn in braill, blood,
and CSF. The concentrations of ammonium ion in
arterial blood, cisternal CSF, and three brain regions
of rats with PC shunts for 8 wk are given in Table II.
In the shunted control group (injected with sodium
acetate), the concentrations of ammonium ion in the
cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres were similar,
whereas somewhat lower concentrations (-20%; P
< 0.05) were observed in the brain stem. A similar
regional variation in brain ammonia content has also
been observed in normal rats (38). Ammonia intoxication was associated with a marked rise in the arterial
blood ammonia level at 10 min (3.5-fold), whereas
ammonia concentrations in brain and CSF increased
even more (>fivefold); the relative increase was most
striking in the brain stem. At 60 min after injection,
concentrations of ammonia tended to be further increased in all regions of brain (although differences
from the 10-min values were significant only in
cerebellum) despite the fact that blood ammonia

may even have been decreased (P < 0.1).
Cerebral energy balance. The injection of ammonium acetate into PC animals produced a pattern
of change in the concentrations of high-energy phosphates and their degradation products that was similar
in all regions of brain (Tables III-V). After 10 min,
phosphocreatine was uniformly depressed, and there
were corresponding increases in the concentrations
of creatine and inorganic phosphate. Concentrations of
ATP, ADP, and AMP remained unchanged, as did the
ATP/ADP ratios. After 1 h, the situation was different.
Phosphocreatine was further decreased and inorganic
phosphate was further increased, but there were now
substantial reductions in the concentration of ATP
in all regions. The changes in ATP were partly
realized as increased AMP. Because the concentrations of ADP tended to be higher in all regions after
60 min, the resultant ATP/ADP ratios declined (P
< 0.01). These alterations in energy state were most
pronounced in the brain stem, a finding consistent
with the observation by Schenker et al. (19) that

acute ammonia intoxication in normal rats depletes ATP and phosphocreatine predominantly in
the basal parts of the brain.
Glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in cerebral hemispheres. Ammonia intoxication in PC rats produced substantial increases
in the concentrations of all measured intermediates
of the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway in the
cerebral hemispheres of comatose animals (60 min
postinjection), and of all but glucose-6-phosphate (unchanged) in the precomatose group (Fig. 2). These
changes are consistent with an ammonium ion-induced
increase in cerebral glycolytic activity, as has been
found to occur after acute ammonia intoxication in
normal animals (21, 39). At both 10 and 60 min after
ammiionium acetate injection the increases in lactate
were disproportionately greater than changes in
pyruvate; the calculated lactate/pyruvate ratios were
therefore consistently elevated (33.1±2.5 and 40.5
±2.8 at 10 and 60 min, respectively, vs. 15.8±1.9 in
controls; P < 0.01).
Among the measured tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, a-ketoglutarate and malate rose after ammonium acetate injection (60 min), whereas citrate
declined (Fig. 2). Oxalacetate was calculated to have
decreased. Changes in these intermediates were in
the same direction at 10 min after ammonia loading;
however, the malate rise was significant only in the
comiiatose animals.
Amitino acid concentrations in cerebral hemnispheres.
Ammonium ion-induced changes in amino acid concentrations of brain of shunted rats were more pronounced in the comatose animals, but some differences
were apparent even during the precomatose stage
(Table VI). Thus, aspartate declined and alanine rose
within 10 min after ammonium acetate injection,
whereas concentrations of glutamate, glutamine,
asparagine, and y-aminobutyrate were unaffected.
After 60 min, aspartate levels remained depressed and
asparagine increased by 20%; alanine concentrations
more than tripled. Glutamate fell (- 14%), despite
the fact that ammonia and a-ketoglutarate were both
elevated in brain after ammonia treatment (Table II,
Fig. 2). Since brain glutamine concentrations also
rose by 3.5 mmol/kg (29% above control) during this
same period, the decrease in glutamate implies an
accelerated conversion of glutamate into glutamine.
In fact, the average rate of glutamine synthesis (calculated from the rate of accumulation of excess
glutamine and, therefore, a minimal estimate) was 0.58
mmol/kg per min; this value is 75% higher than the
rate of brain glutamine synthesis obtained in unshunted rats that were acutely intoxicated with ammonium acetate (21).
Redox state of pyridine nucleotide couples. The
cytoplasmic ratio of [NAD+]/[NADH], calculated from
the components of the lactic dehydrogenase equilibrium, decreased by 50% at 10 min after ammonium
acetate injection (Table VII) and may have been
further decreased after 60 min (P < 0.1). This pattern
is opposite to the changes in the [NAD+]/[NADH]
ratio obtained from the components of the glutamic
dehydrogenase equilibrium. The increases in [NAD+]/
[NADH] at 10 and 60 min after ammonium acetate
injection indicate a shift toward increased oxidation
within the glutamic dehydrogenase-containing compartment, thought to be principally intramitochondrial
(41). The calculations indicate a dissociation between

The concentration of oxalacetate was calculated from
data for malate, pyruvate, and lactate on the assumption
that the malic dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase
systems are in equilibrium with the same NAD pool
(27, 40). The concentration of oxalacetate was obtained
from the formula: [Oxalacetate] = [Pyruvate] [Malate]/[Lactate] x KMDH/KLDH, where KMDH and KLDH are the equilibrium
constants of the malic dehydrogenase and lactic dehydrogenase reactions, respectively.

subjected to acute ammonia intoxication (19, 21, 42).
DISCUSSION
A unifying hypothesis to explain how ammonia affects brain function must take into account the variety
of toxic manifestations and metabolic abnormalities
caused by ammonia intoxication in normal and PC
animals. Ammonia-induced coma in rats with PC
shuints is associated vith a fall in the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (36) and is thus similar to comatose
conditions arising from other metabolic (hypoxia,
hypoglycemia) or toxic (uiremia, cirrhosis) factors (43).
A critical question is whether the decline in oxygeni
constumption prodtuces coma or is secondary to the decreased neuronal activity.
It seems unlikely that the early brain dysfunctioni
caused by ammonia in PC animals is due primarily
to interference with cerebral oxidative energy prodtuction. As early as 10 min after the ammonia challenge
when the animals were already behaviorally abnormal, the concentrations of the adenine nucleotides
in the brain were all within normal limits. Small
but significant decreases in phosphocreatine and in
the phosphocreatine/creatine ratio emerged during
this precomatose stage, but such differences, in themselves, do not indicate a cerebral energy deficit.
The creatine phosphokinase reaction is pH-dependent
(44), and an increase in the tissue hydrogen ion conicentration, secondary to the accumulation of lactic acid
(Fig. 2), could largely account for the decline in phosphocreatine (45). Admittedly, mild nitrous oxide anesthesia was employed during the biochemical stuidies,
buit this degree of anesthesia does not alter the rate
of energy utilization in rat brain (cf. 46 and 47) and is
unlikely to have damped the metabolic changes. In
contrast to the preserved energy balance accompanying
the initial stages of ammonia intoxication, PC animals
did develop an abnormal cerebral energy state once
superimposed ammonia intoxication produced coma.
Decreased concentrations of ATP and decreased ATP/
ADP ratios were found at 1 h in all regions of the brain
(Tables III-V). These changes occurred in the absence
of generalized seiztures, systemic hypoxia, or cerebral
ischemia, and therefore must be related to the metabolism of ammonia. The sequence observed at 10 and 60
min thus suggests that ammonia induces a biochemical
abnormality that eventually leads to a fall in ATP,
perhaps at that point precipitating the irreversible
brain damage that ultimately develops (35).
Cytoplasmic glycolysis provides the substrate for
mitochondrial respiration via the oxidative conversion
of pyruvate to citrate. The observation that pyruvate
increased progressively, whereas citrate declined after
ammonia loading, suggests a block at this linkage
point. Inhibition of citrate formation could be mediated
by low oxalacetate, concentrations of which were decreased by 50% (Fig. 2) and may have become inadequate for condensation with acetyl-coenzyme A.
McKhann and Tower (18) previously observed that 15
mM ammonium chloride inhibited oxygen consumption and pyruvate utilization by a brain mitochondrial
preparation incubated in vitro. Since added succinate
failed to reverse the inhibition (by metabolically
supplying oxalacetate), McKhann and Tower (18) con392 B. Hindfelt, F. Plum, and T. E. Duiffy

cluded that the effect was not simply the result of
decreased availability of oxalacetate. Whllether suclh a
block has physiological significance is not clear from
the present experiments. Despite decreased citrate,
other tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were not
depleted; in fact, mialate and a-ketoglutarate were
substantially elevated (Fig. 2). Nloreover, ammonia
treatment caused a net accumuiitilation of 3 mmnol/kg in
glutamine (Table VI; 60 min), presuma)bly arising
from a-ketogltutarate via the intermediate formation of
gltutamate. Since glutamate decreased by only 1
mmol/kg (Table VI), a suipplementary souirce of carbon
is needed. This is probably stupplied by ammoniastimulated carbon dioxide fixation (48).
The finding that the encephalopatlhy of amimonia
intoxication in portacaval animals precedes the development of a cerebral energy imbalance directs attention to other aspects of ammonia metabolismii in
searching for the biochemical lesion. In brain, the
metabolism of ammonia is intimately linked with the
formation and turnover of a ntumber of amino acids,
two of which, glutamic and aspartic acids, have
neuroexcitatory characteristics. In precoma, aspartate
was consistently decreased and with deepening coma
there was a progressive rise in alanine and fall in
glutamate (Table VI). Decreased gluitamate is associated with reversible comca duie to hypoxic hypoxia
(27), hypoglycemia (10, 11), and hypercapnia (12),

whereas aspartate falls in hypoxia (27) and hypercapnia
(12), but rises in hypoglycemia (10, 11). Thus, decreases in the predominantly excitatory amino acids
may play a role in the pathogenesis of ammoniainduced coma in PC animals. Rats with PC shunts
are more susceptible to ammonia intoxication than
sham-operated controls; the coma is prolonged and
recovery is much delayed. One notable difference
between normal and PC animals is that brain glutamate was 1.5 mmol/kg lower 8 wk after portal-systemic
shunting (Table I). In view of the likelihood that
glutamic acid is compartmented in brain (49), this
relatively small decrease in total brain glutamate
(10%) may be significant if confined to a small intracellular pool such as that involved in synaptic transmission.
Certain features of the early metabolic disturbances
of ammonia intoxication also may relate to alterations in brain amino acid concentrations which, in
turn, influence other major metabolic translocations in
the cell. The increase in alanine and malate and the
fall of aspartate and oxalacetate (Fig. 2, Table VI)
are believed to result from a concerted transamination
mechanism facilitated by increased pyruvate.
NADH NAD+
Pyruvate Glutamate Oxalacetate 2i. Malate
Alanine J a-Ketoglutarate Aspartate
The net effect of this reaction sequence is a transamination between pyruvate and aspartate giving rise
to alanine and oxalacetate. Excess pyruvate (Fig. 2),
secondary to inhibition of pyruvate oxidation (see
above), coupled with an elevated cytoplasmic [NADH I/
[NAD+] ratio (Table VII), would favor alanine and
malate formation, as was observed. A similar metabolic
response has also been found to occur in brain during
coma-producing, but reversible hypoxia (27). Moreover, an elevated [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio in brain cytoplasm and an apparently decreased [NADH]/[NAD+]
ratio within the mitochondria is common to both
hypoxic and ammonia-induced coma (9 and Table VII),
suggesting that abnormal brain function in the two
conditions may reflect a similar metabolic lesion, i.e.,
failure to transport reduced equivalents from cytoplasm
to mitochondria.
Although NADH does not readily cross the mitochondrial membrane, net transfer of NADH from cytoplasm to mitochondrion does occur, presumably via an
appropriate carrier system that transports reduced
equivalents in lieu of NADH. In rat liver, heart, and
probably, brain, reduced equivalents generated in the
cytoplasm (glycolysis) are thought to be transported
into the mitochondria by way of the "malate-aspartate
shuttle" (50, 51) as described by Borst (52) (Fig. 3).
The transported anions, malate, a-ketoglutarate, aspartate, glutamate, are all significantly altered in brain
by ammonia loading (Fig. 2, Table VI), glutamate,
and aspartate in particular. Studies by Williamson et al. (51) with isolated heart mitochondria indicate that the rate of entry of glutamate into mitochondria is an important regulator of the malateaspartate cycle but that the affinity of the carrier
system for glutamate transport is poor (Km -6 mM).
Because such a carrier would not be saturated at
normal glutamate concentrations in brain (about 11
mM, Table I), a fall in glutamate, owing to ammoniastimulated conversion of glutamate into glutamine,
and decreased aspartate after ammonia loading, may
inhibit the "shuttle" or reduce its efficiency in the
face of a high glycolytic flux. Such a mechanism
would lead to an accumulation of NADH in the cytoplasm and could account for the more reduced state
of the cytosol relative to that of the mitochondria
(Table VII). Interference with hydrogen transport
could also explain the delayed energy failure and reduced oxygen consumption. A deficiency of substrate
(NADH) for the mitochondrial electron transport
chain (the result both of failure to translocate cytoplasmically generated NADH and of the continuous
removal of intramitochondrial NADH via the glutamic
dehydrogenase reaction) would inhibit oxidative
energy coupling and ultimately lead to a fall in ATP.
