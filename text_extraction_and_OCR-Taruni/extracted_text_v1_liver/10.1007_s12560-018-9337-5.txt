Abstract
Shellfsh samples (n = 310) purchased from local supermarkets were analysed for the presence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
by nested RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR. Overall, 2.9% of samples tested positive for the presence of HEV. Phylogenetic 
analysis of HEV sequences revealed all as being genotype 3 HEV. This is the frst report of the detection of HEV in commercially sold shellfsh in Scotland. These fndings may encourage further research that will help address the gaps in the 
knowledge in respect to foodborne transmission of HEV in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.

Introduction
The Scottish aquaculture industry produces approximately 
7700 tonnes of mussels annually with the aim to increase this 
to 13,000 tonnes by 2020 (http://www.gov.scot/Topics/marin
e/Fish-Shellfsh), and is worth approximately £11.7 million 
at frst sale value (Munro & Wallace 2016). In the United 
Kingdom, a steady increase in the number of cases of nontravel-related hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been 
observed in recent years (Grierson et al. 2015; Crossan 
et al. 2015). A substantial increase in laboratory reports of 
non-travel-associated HEV infections in Scotland has been 
observed with the number of cases of HEV infection increasing from 13 in 2011 to 206 in 2016 (http://www.hps.scot.
nhs.uk/ewr/article.aspx). In Scotland, routes of transmission 
are not fully understood but a number of potential risk factors have been identifed. Foodborne transmission of HEV 
is a major route of infection in Europe with contaminated 
food products such as leafy green vegetables, sausages and 
soft fruits being potential sources of transmission (Donnelly et al. 2017). Demonstrated by a multivariate study, the 
consumption of processed pork products was found to be 
signifcantly associated with indigenous genotype 3 HEV 
infection (Said et al. 2014). Consumption of shellfsh has 
also been identifed as a possible risk factor of foodborne 
transmission of HEV to humans (Said et al. 2009). There 
are a number of studies from European countries documenting the presence of enteric viruses, including HEV, in both 
wild and commercially grown mussels (Chironna et al. 2002; 
Myrmel et al. 2004; Diez-Valcarce et al. 2012; Krog et al. 
2014; Sufredini et al. 2014; Mesquita et al. 2016; La Rosa 
et al. 2017). To date, only one Scottish study has reported the 
presence of HEV in wild Scottish mussels; however, these 
were grown in unregulated waters and were not destined for 
retail (Crossan et al. 2012). No studies in Scotland have been 
undertaken to assess the presence of HEV in commercially 
harvested Mytilus edulis and Crassostrea gigas at point of 
sale in retailers. Despite the increase in the number of cases 
of autochthonous hepatitis E infection in Scotland, there is a 
distinct lack of information regarding transmission routes. In 
the present study, Scottish-harvested M. edulis and C. gigas
were purchased from local supermarkets and analysed for 
the presence of HEV RNA.
Materials and Methods
Origin and Processing of Shellfsh Samples
310 live shellfsh samples (270 blue mussels and 40 Pacifc 
oysters) were purchased from 4 local supermarkets and 
a local fshmonger and processed in accordance to ISO/
TS15216-1 (ISO 2013). Shellfsh were purchased at diferent

time periods. Viral RNA was extracted from shellfsh supernatants using QIamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany). Eluted viral RNA was used immediately or stored 
at − 80 °C until further use.
Detection and Amplifcation of HEV RNA by Nested 
RT‑PCR and Real‑Time qRT‑PCR
Shellfsh samples were assayed for HEV RNA using a previously described nested RT-PCR with universal oligonucleotides targeting the ORF2 region of the HEV genome 
(Table 1) (Erker et al. 1999). The World Health Organization (WHO) hepatitis E virus 1st International genotype 3a 
standard (PEI code 6329/10) has been assigned a unitage of 
250,000 International Units per millilitre (IU/ml) and was 
utilised as the positive control for all RT-PCR reactions. The 
limit of detection for the assay is 2.5 IU/ml.
All samples positive for HEV RNA by nested RT-PCR 
were assayed for HEV RNA by real-time qRT-PCR with the 
hepatitisE@ceeramTools HEV detection kit (BioMérieux, 
France). The World Health Organization (WHO) hepatitis 
E virus 1st International genotype 3a standard (PEI code 
6329/10) was used to generate a standard curve for HEV 
RNA quantitation. The limit of detection of the hepatitis@
ceeramTools assay is 25 IU/ml (Mokhtari et al. 2013).
Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis
All samples positive for the presence of 145-bp PCR fragments were subject to Sanger sequencing (GATC, Cologne, 
Germany). Sequences were augmented with additional 
ORF2 sequences derived from wild mussels (n = 12) (Crossan et al. 2012). Proposed reference sequences for HEV 
genotypes and HEV subtypes were included in the analysis 
(Lu et al. 2006; Smith et al. 2016). Genotype 3 sequences 
from Scottish swine and human patients were incorporated 
into the analysis (Crossan et al. 2014). Nucleotide sequences 
were aligned using EMBL-EBI CLUSTAL omega (https
://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) and the alignment 
transformed into PAUP/NEXUS format with EMBL-EBI 
EMBOSS SEQRET (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/sfc/embos
s_seqret/). The sequences were used for Bayesian inference 
analysis with MrBayes v3.2.1 using the Markov chain Monte 
Carlo (MCMC) method (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). 
The majority rule consensus tree was rendered with FigTree 
v1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/fgtree/).
Results
Overall, 9 out of 310 (2.9%) of shellfsh samples were positive for HEV by nested RT-PCR. The presence of HEV was 
detected in 8 of the 270 (2.9%) M. edulis samples and 1 of 
the 40 (2.5%) Pacifc oysters by nested RT-PCR.
Of the 9 shellfsh samples positive for HEV by nested RTPCR, 8 had material available for assay by qRT-PCR. Two 
samples were positive for HEV RNA with the hepatitisE@
ceeramTools HEV detection assay. However, the virus titre 
could be quantitated for only 1 sample and was calculated 
at 62.4 IU/ml.
HEV sequences were successfully obtained from 3 out of 
the 9 samples that were positive for HEV by nested RT-PCR. 
The 3 sequences were derived from mussels, all of which 
were purchased from three diferent retailers but initially 
processed and dispatched from a central processing site. The 
inability to successfully clone and sequence samples with 
low virus levels has been described previously (Grierson 
et al. 2015).
Figure 1 shows phylogenetic analysis of ORF2 sequences 
obtained from mussels along with genotypes 1 to 8 and genotype 3 sequences derived from Scottish wild mussels, swine 
and patient sera. The mussel sequences are identifed in bold 
and by the codes SM1, SM2 and SM3 (Scottish Mussel 1, 
2 and 3).
Phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 sequences 
shown in Fig. 1 showed that all HEV sequences from the 
commercial mussels belonged to genotype 3. Moreover, the 
sequences clustered with the subtype 3c reference sequence 
from the wild boar strain, wbGER27 (accession number 
FJ705359). The sequences also clustered with two sequences 
from human patients, including one patient with a transfusion-transmitted HEV infection (SStxn). Both patients were 
Scottish and both infections were indigenously acquired. No 
newly identifed shellfsh sequences clustered with HEV 
sequences derived from wild mussels from the 2012 Crossan study (Crossan et al. 2012). Despite many of the wild

Discussion
Detection of HEV in bivalve mollusks has been reported 
previously (Li et al. 2007; Song et al. 2010; Donia et al. 
2012; Crossan et al. 2012).
The overall HEV prevalence in the Scottish shellfsh was 
2.9% and was much lower compared to the HEV detection 
rate in Scottish wild mussels (Crossan et al. 2012). The low 
prevalence rate reported in this study is very similar to the 
2.6% HEV detection rate in shellfsh harvested from commercial production sites in Southern Italy (La Rosa et al. 
2017). One European study reported that 3% of mussels 
at retail level from Spain were HEV RNA positive (DiezValcarce et al. 2012), whilst another reported 14.8% of 
mussels harvested from commercial production sites were

positive for genotype 3 HEV RNA (Mesquita et al. 2016). 
Both the former study and the latter study analysed mussels 
from the Galicia region in Spain but it is unknown whether 
samples were from the same production site. Another study 
reported 8.1% of mussels collected in the Tuscany region of 
Italy were positive for HEV RNA although these were not 
from approved production sites (Donia et al. 2012). The La 
Rosa study reported virus titres in mussels being below 102
genome copies/g shellfsh (La Rosa et al. 2017). We also 
report very low virus concentrations in commercial mussels; 
HEV RNA was quantifable in only 1 sample with the HEV 
RNA titre calculated at less than 102 IU/ml. In contrast to 
the fndings reported here and by in the La Rosa study, HEV 
RNA titres in Scottish wild mussels ranged between 3.73 
and 5.2 log10 IU/ml (Crossan et al. 2012). The diferences 
observed between the viral titres reported in these studies 
may refect that commercially grown shellfsh are subject 
to strict EU hygiene regulations such as those stipulated in 
(EU) Regulation 853/2004 and (EU) Regulation 854/2004, 
whilst the wild mussels analysed in the Crossan study were 
not.
Phylogenetic analysis, although confrming genotype 3, 
sequences did not cluster with or show any relationship with 
sequences previously detected in wild mussels or with Scottish pig strains (Crossan et al. 2012, 2014). The wild mussels reported in the 2012 Crossan et al. study were collected 
from unregulated wild mussel beds in diferent geographical locations to the shellfsh reported in this study. Wild 
mussels were collected from sites on the northeast coast 
of Scotland—a region renowned for its pig farming and 
home to the vast majority of the country’s sows. Furthermore, wild mussels from the west coast were also collected 
from a unique site; the mussel bed was situated downstream 
from a pig meat processing plant and in close proximity to 
a waste outfall pipe, possibly connected to the processing 
plant (Crossan et al. 2012). Commercial aquaculture sites in 
Scotland, however, are mainly located on the west coast and 
the Shetland Isles where pig production is uncommon. Genotype 3 HEV has been reported to fall in to two phylogenetic 
groups, clade 1 and clade 2 comprising subtypes 3a, 3b, 3c, 
3h, 3i and 3j (3abchij) and subtypes 3e, 3f and 3g (3efg), 
respectively (Smith et al. 2016). The sequences derived from 
commercial mussels all clustered with the reference subtype 3c sequence, wbGER27, isolated from a wild boar. The 
commercial shellfsh sequences also clustered with genotype 
3 HEV sequences obtained from 2 Scottish patients with 
indigenously acquired genotype 3c HEV infection. It could 
be posited that the HEV infections of the original blood 
donor to patient SStxn and WOSSVC_78 may have been 
acquired via the consumption of contaminated or infected 
food products such as shellfsh or meat products. However, 
this is speculation and there are currently very limited numbers of studies reporting hepatitis E virus infection following 
the consumption of contaminated bivalve mollusc shellfsh 
(Koizumi et al. 2004; Li et al. 2007; Said et al. 2009). The 
three newly obtained sequences described in this study were 
from shellfsh purchased from three separate commercial 
outlets but within the same time period and it is reasonable 
to assume that they have come from diferent aquaculture 
sites that are widely dispersed around the coast of Scotland, 
albeit processing is carried out centrally, which could potentially be an alternative source of contamination. It was not 
possible to draw any conclusions regarding diferences in 
HEV detection during diferent times of sampling as the 
study was not designed for this type of analysis (i.e. samples 
being collected at regular intervals throughout the year).
The presence of HEV in shellfsh is likely attributable 
to contamination of shellfsh harvesting waters by human 
sewage. Many rural dwellings on the west coast of Scotland and on the Shetland Isles do not have adequate sewage 
treatment systems in place, often resulting in the release of 
raw or partially treated sewage into the environment. This is 
surprisingly common according to Scottish Environmental 
Protection Agency (SEPA) (personal communication), and 
it is therefore very possible for shellfsh harvesting waters to 
be exposed to enteric viruses, including HEV.
Scotland is home to very large wild deer populations, 
including red deer and sika deer, and it is therefore possible 
that animal sewage, including from wild deer, may also be a 
potential source of contamination as previous studies have 
found HEV to be circulating amongst deer populations (Tei 
et al. 2003; Choi et al. 2013; Kukielka et al. 2016). In contrast to wild deer populations in Scotland, the number of 
wild boar roaming freely in Scotland is very low and widely 
dispersed, and therefore the risk of contamination of shellfsh harvesting sites is signifcantly lower. It should be noted, 
however, that studies have suggested that deer are in fact 
spillover hosts of HEV due to the accidental transmission of 
HEV from wild boar species, whilst other authors recognise 
deer as true reservoirs for HEV (Anheyer-Behmenburg et al. 
2017; Thiry et al. 2017; Van der Poel 2014). Despite the 
fact that Scotland produces approximately 3500 tonnes of 
venison annually and the estimated annual value of Scottish 
venison sales is £2 million, there are no data regarding the 
presence of HEV in the Scottish deer population to date or 
studies examining the risk of acquiring HEV via the consumption of venison meat and processed venison products 
(Edwards & Kenyon 2013).
The present study is the frst to demonstrate the occurrence of genotype 3 HEV in commercially harvested Scottish mussels sold at retail, albeit at extremely low levels 
(only quantifable in one sample). Until the dose–response 
relationship for HEV infection and disease are addressed, 
the risk to consumers regarding shellfsh consumption and 
the risk of infection is unknown. It is important to note that 
the detection of viral genomic material by RT-PCR does

not distinguish between infectious and non-infectious HEV 
particles. Until a robust, efective and validated cell-culture 
method is developed that can determine the infectious capacity of HEV in foodstufs, it was not possible to determine 
whether infectious particles were indeed present in the 
shellfsh. Unlike oysters, which are traditionally eaten raw, 
mussels are less likely to pose a risk of HEV infection to 
consumers, as they are normally cooked prior consumption. 
However, the optimum cooking temperatures and the minimum cooking times have yet to be established for complete 
HEV inactivation in shellfsh. Nevertheless, caution should 
be taken when consuming shellfsh, particularly by those 
deemed to be at higher risk of HEV infection. These fndings 
may encourage further research that will help address the 
gaps in the knowledge in respect to foodborne transmission 
of HEV in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
