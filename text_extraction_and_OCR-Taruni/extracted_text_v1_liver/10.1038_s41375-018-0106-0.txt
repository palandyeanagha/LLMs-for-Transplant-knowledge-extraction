Abstract
Viral vectors provide an efficient means for modification of eukaryotic cells, and their use is now commonplace in academic
laboratories and industry for both research and clinical gene therapy applications. Lentiviral vectors, derived from the human
immunodeficiency virus, have been extensively investigated and optimized over the past two decades. Third-generation, selfinactivating lentiviral vectors have recently been used in multiple clinical trials to introduce genes into hematopoietic stem cells
to correct primary immunodeficiencies and hemoglobinopathies. These vectors have also been used to introduce genes into
mature T cells to generate immunity to cancer through the delivery of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or cloned T-cell
receptors. CAR T-cell therapies engineered using lentiviral vectors have demonstrated noteworthy clinical success in patients
with B-cell malignancies leading to regulatory approval of the first genetically engineered cellular therapy using lentiviral
vectors. In this review, we discuss several aspects of lentiviral vectors that will be of interest to clinicians, including an overview
of lentiviral vector development, the current uses of viral vectors as therapy for primary immunodeficiencies and cancers, largescale manufacturing of lentiviral vectors, and long-term follow-up of patients treated with gene therapy products.
Introduction
The advent of molecular biology in the 1970s enabled the
development of a variety of tools to manipulate nucleic acids
and has transformed modern medicine. Molecular biology
forms the foundation of numerous biotherapeutics, such as
recombinant enzymes (e.g., factor IX in hemophilia), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab), and growth factors (e.g.,
erythropoietin). Gene therapy, which involves the delivery of
DNA encoding a gene of interest into a cell with the intention
of treating a disease, extends the power of molecular biology
to potentially correct diseases such as those caused by genetic
deficiencies (e.g., β-thalassemia due to a defect in the β-globin
gene). Beyond correcting genetic deficiencies, gene therapy
can also endow a cell or organism with capabilities not present in the natural state. Adoptive cellular therapy using
genetically engineered T cells is one of the most notable
examples. Using a synthetic gene, such as a chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) or cloned T-cell receptor (TCR), T cells can
be endowed with the ability to recognize antigens that are not
naturally recognized by their endogenous TCRs. This
approach is capable of generating robust clinical responses
even in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies that are
highly refractory to other existing therapies [1].
Gene therapy via gammaretroviruses, lentiviruses, adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses is attractive because of the
natural ability of viruses to enter into and deliver genetic
material to cells [2]. Gammaretroviruses and lentiviruses are
subtypes of retroviruses, which contain an RNA genome that is
converted to DNA in the transduced cell by a virally encoded
enzyme called reverse transcriptase. Although the use of gammaretroviral vectors is more common, especially in the research
setting, the number of clinical trials using lentiviral vectors for
gene therapy is increasing. This review discusses the development of lentiviral vectors and summarizes their current clinical
investigation, particularly from a safety perspective.

encodes structural proteins, pol encodes enzymes required
for reverse transcription and integration into the host cell
genome, and env encodes the viral envelope glycoprotein
[3]. All retroviruses have a similar life cycle. The life cycle
begins when the mature virus gains entry to the cell either
through direct membrane fusion or receptor-mediated
endocytosis facilitated through the binding of glycoproteins within the envelope to their cognate receptors on the
target cell’s surface. This initial fusion step is followed by a
process of uncoating; at this stage, several viral proteins
(including some Gag subunits) dissociate from the viral
core. The viral RNA is converted to proviral doublestranded DNA through a complicated multistep process of
reverse transcription. The proviral DNA then complexes
with viral proteins to facilitate nuclear import and integration into the host genome. The process of integration is
assisted by crucial viral proteins, such as integrase, and
endogenous host cell transcription factors such as LEDGF
[4]. The integrated proviral genome of wild-type lentivirus
relies on host machinery to initiate and complete transcription and translation of viral proteins necessary to
assemble infectious particles. The viral progeny then exit
the cell through a process called budding, in which virions
are released into the extracellular space from the plasma
membrane unlike other viruses that often bud. Like many
enveloped viruses, lentiviruses utilize the endosomal sorting
complexes required for transport pathway to execute the
complex budding process and release virions into the
extracellular space [5]. During the budding process, endogenous membrane proteins present within the host cell can
be incorporated into the envelope of the virion such as
MHC molecules, which may affect the subsequent disposition of the liberated viral particles. The processes of
viral egress and subsequent viral spreading are essential to
the life cycle of wild-type lentivirus, but are not germane to
the understanding of the fundamental features of
replication-incompetent recombinant lentiviral vectors.
Two unique steps of the retroviral life cycle, reverse
transcription and integration, are integral to how lentiviral
vectors function. Following uncoating, the remaining viral
nucleic acid and protein complex is often referred to as the
reverse transcription complex (RTC). This RTC is actively

Fig. 1 Steps of reverse transcription. This figure illustrates the steps
involved in the conversion of the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)
genome of HIV into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). RNA is shown
in red and DNA as yellow [1]. The transfer RNA (tRNA) primer (blue
ellipse) is base paired to the primer-binding site (PBS) [2]. Reverse
transcription is initiated using the reverse transcriptase (RT; purple
ellipse) enzyme, and minus-strand DNA synthesis starts from the
tRNA primer, copying the U5 and R sequences at the 5′ end of the
genome. At this stage, an RNA/DNA duplex is created, and ribonuclease (RNase) H activity of the RT enzyme degrades the viral RNA
that has been copied (dotted red line) [3, 4]. The minus-strand DNA
has been transferred, using the R sequence found at both ends of the
viral RNA, to the 3′ end of the viral RNA, and minus-strand DNA
synthesis continues. The HIV-1 genome has two RNase H-resistant
polypurine tracts (PPTs) [5]. The two PPTs serve as primers for plusstrand DNA synthesis. One plus-strand is initiated at U3, and one is
initiated at the central PPT (cPPT) [6]. Both the plus- and minus-strand
DNAs are then elongated, finally resulting in a complete copy of viral
RNA with additional sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends such that viral
DNA has an identical copy of U3RU5 at both ends. The plus-strand
that was initiated at U3 displaces a segment of the plus-strand that was
initiated from the cPPT, creating a small flap called the central flap
(cFLAP). LTR long terminal repeat

transported to the chromosomal DNA, where integration
may occur [6–9]. During this migration, the viral RNA is
converted within the RTC to double-stranded viral DNA by
the reverse transcription process. This process begins when
a transfer RNA binds to the primer-binding site at the 5′ end
of the viral RNA genome (Fig. 1). As the negative-strand of
the viral DNA is synthesized by the polymerase activity of
the reverse transcriptase enzyme, the viral RNA is degraded
by the RNAse H activity of this same enzyme. This process
creates a short fragment of negative-sense, single-strand
DNA, often referred to as strong-stop copy DNA (sscDNA).
This sscDNA fragment is subsequently transferred to the 3′
end of the viral RNA to serve as a primer for the synthesis
of the negative-strand viral DNA. In this process, the
U3RU5 sequence of the long terminal repeat (LTR) that is
essential for the viral life cycle is restored. Priming for the
synthesis of the positive-strand viral DNA is accomplished
through RNase H-resistant polypurine tracts, one close to
the 3′ LTR and the other a central polypurine tract. In
summary, the entire process uses multiple priming steps
resulting in a complete DNA copy of the viral RNA. This
viral DNA has an identical copy of the U3RU5 sequence
within the LTR at both ends. As reverse transcription nears
completion, the complex can be referred to as a preintegration complex (PIC). Because there are potentially
multiple priming events to synthesize the plus-strand, flaps
of overlapping positive-strand DNA can form. It is thought
that these flaps are likely repaired by host DNA repair
enzymes after the process of integration [10, 11]. Although
the central polypurine tracts (or the flaps of DNA they
generate) are not essential for the process of reverse transcription, studies with viral vectors suggest that their presence enhances the potency of viral vectors. This may be
due to the enhanced rate of second-strand synthesis, which
may also protect the RTC from innate restriction factors,
such as the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic
polypeptide-like enzyme (APOBEC). However, it has also
been suggested that this three-stranded DNA flap may also
enhance nuclear import [12, 13]. Whether reverse transcription is completed in the cytoplasm or nucleus is unclear
[10, 14].
The precise composition of the RTC may allow for moreeffective reverse transcription. The capsid appears to protect
the viral nucleic acid from innate sensors; simultaneously, it
provides a structure that allows for more-effective reverse
transcription with lower error rates. Reverse transcription is
more accurate in cell lines than in a cell-free system, but the
transcription rate is much slower (70 nt/min vs. 1000 nt/
min). This rate is even slower still in primary cells, such as
macrophages and resting T cells, which have lower
nucleotide pools. The process of transporting the RTC from
the cellular envelope to the chromatin of the cell is active,
requiring energy [15], and it remains under-investigated;
however, recent studies of the integration process have
uncovered several host-virus interactions that may facilitate
the process. One such model suggests that capsid protein
has a fundamental role in the early part of the viral life cycle
by utilizing cyclophilin A, cleavage and polyadenylation
specificity factor 6 (CPSF6), Nup358, and TNPO3 to
orchestrate a coordinated process of capsid uncoating, DNA
synthesis, and integration that promotes evasion of the
innate response and insertion into preferred areas of chromatin [16].
The steps of integration are (1) tethering (2), 3′ processing/cleavage of a precise number of terminal nucleotides
(3), strand transfer, and (4) DNA repair. Important differences between gammaretroviruses (murine leukemia virus
[MLV]) and lentiviruses (human immunodeficiency virus
[HIV]) have consequences that should be considered when
designing gene therapy vectors using retroviruses.
In the majority of retroviruses, the process of integration
is not random. Each class of retrovirus has its characteristic
preference [17, 18]. The gammaretrovirus MLV exhibits
preferential insertion near transcriptional start sites, while
the lentivirus HIV preferentially inserts within transcriptional units. The alpha retrovirus avian sarcoma leukosis
virus has a milder preference for transcription units. The
beta retrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus has no
apparent preference. Gammaretroviruses, such as MLV, can
gain access to the chromatin only after the nuclear envelope
is dissolved. The tethering mechanism of MLV results in
insertion sites within enhancers, and involves interactions
between the p12 MLV protein with BRD2,3,4 (bromodomain and external domain proteins 2, 3, and 4) [19]. It also
appears that DNA sequences that are highly bent due to
wrapping around nucleosomes are favored [20].
Lentiviruses have additional selection criteria for integration that relate to their unique ability to translocate
across the nuclear pore of an intact nuclear envelope.
Gammaretroviruses must access the host genome during
mitosis, when the nuclear envelope is disassembled,
whereas lentiviruses can access chromosomes by active
transport through the nuclear pore. Although the process of
nuclear import is still largely not understood, viral proteins
within the PIC, such as capsid, as well as elements of the
reverse transcribed host genome are thought to be necessary
for transport through the nuclear pore [19, 21]. Additionally, elegant studies by Yamashita et al. [21] demonstrated
that the capsid protein of HIV but not MLV enables HIV’s
translocation across the nuclear pore. In non-dividing cells,
proximity to the nuclear pore also plays a role in integration
site selection [22]. The heterochromatin tends to be associated with the nuclear envelope, while actively transcribed
genes are closer to the nuclear pore [23]. Several host
proteins within the nuclear pore (Nup153, Nup98, Nup358,
CPSF6, and TPR) appear to play a role in HIV’s import.
Clinical use of lentiviral vectors 1531

Host proteins LEDGF, BAF, and HMG are all associated
with the PIC of HIV-1. LEDGF interacts with the PIC and
with epigenetic (H3K36me3) marks, leading to the favored
integration within transcription units. These unique properties of lentiviruses may be advantageous as certain gene
therapy platforms target quiescent cell types, such as longterm hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
For many years, the consensus in the field was that
HIV did not infect quiescent CD4 + T cells in the G0 stage
of the life cycle but could infect activated CD4 + T cells
[24, 25]. Around the same time, studies of patient cells
demonstrated that quiescent CD4 + T cells contained
HIV DNA [26]. Thus, it was hypothesized that the
origin of infected resting CD4 + T cells was activated
T cells that were infected and returned to a resting state.
It was a bit puzzling that these quiescent CD4 + T cells,
which expressed the receptors necessary for HIV fusion
(CD4 and CXCR4, or CCR5), were resistant to HIV
infection; nonetheless, the level of reverse transcripts were
several logs lower in resting compared with activated
CD4 + T cells when viral intermediates were measured
shortly after inoculation (<24 h) [27]. Over time, it was
recognized that the low level of nucleotides and high
expression level of restriction factors in resting CD4 +
T cells slowed the rate of reverse transcription [28, 29] and
reduced the potential to infect resting CD4 + T cells directly
but did not prevent the final outcome of reverse transcripts
followed by integrated proviruses accumulating after 2 to
3 days in resting CD4 + T cells vs. 8 to 12 h in activated
T cells [30–32].
An additional challenge for infection of resting cells by
lentivectors was that quiescent CD4 + T cells fuse inefficiently with the commonly used G protein of the viral
envelope vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). VSV-G
receptor-mediated endocytosis does not result in efficient
infection of resting CD4 + T cells [33, 34] due to limited
endocytosis [34, 35]. Treatment with several cytokines,
such as interleukin 7, overcomes this limitation [36] and
enhances cell survival, as G0 T cells are also prone to die
soon after HIV infection [37].
It will be important to understand the effect of these
restriction factors as these nuances to lentiviral biology will
be important to consider during development of gene
therapies based upon these vectors [29].
Lentiviral vectors
First-generation lentiviral vectors contained a significant
portion of the HIV genome, including the gag and pol
genes, as well as several additional viral proteins [38]. The
envelope protein of another virus, most commonly VSV-G,
was included in the design of first-generation lentiviral
vectors. VSV-G recognizes a ubiquitously expressed
receptor that was most recently identified as the low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor [39, 40], allowing the lentiviral
vector to transduce a wide range of cells [41]. The VSV-G
gene was encoded on a separate plasmid from the other
lentiviral genes. The lentiviral accessory genes vif, vpr, vpu,
and nef, as well as the regulatory genes tat and rev, were
included in first-generation lentiviral vectors. vif, vpr, vpu,
and nef provide survival/fitness advantages for lentiviral
replication in vivo, but they are not essential for the growth
of the virus in vitro; tat and rev are required for viral
replication.
Safer, second-generation lentiviral vectors lacking the
accessory virulence factors vif, vpr, vpu, and nef were
subsequently developed [38]. Removal of the accessory
genes did not inhibit the transfer of genetic material to the
host cell.
Third-generation lentiviral vectors further improved
safety by splitting the viral genome into separate plasmids,
making recombinant virus generation even more unlikely
(Fig. 2) [42]. In the third-generation system, the gag and pol
genes were encoded on a different plasmid from that of the
Fig. 2 Third-generation lentiviral vector. Third-generation lentiviral
vectors are composed of two separate packaging plasmids, one
encoding gag and pol and another encoding rev. An additional plasmid
encodes the envelope protein, derived from the VSV-G. The plasmid
encoding the gene of interest contains lentiviral LTR sequences that
have been altered to be self-inactivating (SIN) to prevent recombination. LTR long terminal repeat, VSV vesicular stomatitis virus

rev or env genes, resulting in a vector made from three
separate plasmids containing the necessary viral sequences
for packaging. The tat gene was removed in thirdgeneration lentiviral vectors due to its unnecessary function when a constitutively active promoter was engineered
into the upstream LTRs of the construct containing the
transgene. The introduction of deletions into the 3'LTR of
the viral genome to create self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral
vectors disrupted the promoter/enhancer activity of the
LTR, further improving safety [42].
The choice of internal promoters used in third-generation
SIN lentiviral vectors is also important. Initial studies used
the cytomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter, which
showed robust expression in most cell lines that are actively
dividing. However, promoters vary substantially in their
activity in primary cells, such as CD34 + stem cells and
T cells [43], with the cytomegalovirus promoter showing
greater variation with T-cell activation than with constitutively active cellular promoters, such as elongation
factor 1-α [44].
Although most current gene therapy approaches activate
T cells to divide before transduction, the ability of HIV-1 to
transduce non-dividing T cells in the G0 state [30] dependent upon the importation of the PIC across an intact
nuclear envelope provides some hypothetical advantages for
use in gene therapy. When cells are transduced in their
resting, non-activated state, the cells may retain greater
functional potential. For example, naive T cells have a very
long intermitotic half-life, with estimates for humans of
approximately 3.5 years [45, 46]. Similarly, slow cycling is
also observed with HSCs, and long-term repopulating
potential is inversely correlated with cycling [47]. By
transducing non-dividing T or stem cells, the likelihood of
persistence of the genetically modified cells may be
increased.
Targeting non-dividing cells may also reduce oncogenic
potential. Given that most retroviral vectors target
transcriptional units, there is an increased chance of insertion into a transcriptional unit involved in cell division
when transducing a dividing cell. This is suggested by
clinical data in which the only cases of insertional mutagenesis were reported in genetically modified proliferative
HSCs rather than quiescent cell types [48]. However,
oncogenic potential is likely highly dependent on context,
particularly preexisting genetic aberrations in treated
patients [49]. Nonetheless, gammaretroviruses have
demonstrated a considerable risk of leukemogenesis due to
their integration patterns near proto-oncogenes. Lentiviral
vectors can also insert near oncogenes, and tumor formation
has been noted in at least one model that used a non-primate
lentivirus-derived vector to transduce embryonic cells [50].
However, available clinical data suggest that newer generation vectors strongly reduce the risks of insertional
mutagenesis as there are no reported cases to date of leukemogenesis in gene therapy trials that involve genetic
modification of either HSCs or non-dividing T cells.
Expansions of cells with a common integration site were
observed in a gene therapy trial using lentiviral vectors for
adrenoleukodystrophy [51]. Highly expanded CD4 + T-cell
clones have also been observed in patients infected with
HIV-1 [52, 53]. However, the clonal integration site
expansions do not appear to be related to oncogenic selection [54].
Long-range chromatin interactions have also been shown
to contribute to oncogenesis caused by retroviral vectors
[55]. Montini et al. [56] demonstrated that by swapping
regions of retroviral and lentiviral LTRs, lentiviral vectors
can induce insertional mutagenesis when bearing the strong
promoter/enhancer elements from retroviruses. SIN lentiviral vectors were shown to have a lower risk of insertional
oncogenesis than gammaretroviral vectors in side-by-side
comparisons of model systems [56, 57], and a mouse model
of clinically relevant SIN lentiviral vectors showed that the
genotoxic potential of lentiviral vectors can be diminished

by the inclusion of an engineered chromatin insulator cassette [58]. However, as already discussed, clonal expansions
can occur when lentiviral vectors integrate within known
oncogenes; therefore, the risk of mutagenesis may be lower
when using lentiviral vectors but is not eliminated [59]. An
assay developed to test the oncogenic potential of gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors may further improve
safety when designing vectors for clinical use [60].
Large-scale manufacturing of lentiviral
vectors for clinical use
The production of lentiviral vectors centers around the use
of a cell line, typically referred to as a packaging cell, to
produce the viral vector particles. Large-scale manufacturing of vectors begins with the growth of an adequate
number of these packaging cells, such as derivatives of the
HEK293T cell line (Fig. 3) [61]. An aliquot of packaging
cells is expanded over several days in culture before the
cells are then transiently transfected with plasmid DNA
encoding the necessary proteins for lentiviral vector production. These core packaging plasmids include envelope
protein (most commonly VSV-G), HIV-1 gag and pol gene
products, and HIV accessory proteins, such as Rev. Cotransfection of these plasmids with the lentiviral vector
genome containing the gene of interest provides all the
components necessary for the cell line to produce functional
vector particles. Over the course of several days, the
packaging cells produce the lentiviral vector particles,
which can be harvested from the culture medium. After flow
filtration, the clarified vector is treated to remove contaminating DNA products, and viral products are purified
using various methods such as gradient purification or
chromatography. Following purification, the eluted fractions undergo a series of filtration steps for sterilization
purposes and to remove any remaining cellular debris [62,
63]. The purity of the product is critical; debris from the
packaging cells can easily be collected along with the vector
product, and these impurities may cause inflammatory
responses in vitro and in vivo [64]. Once generated, vector
stocks have been reported to remain stable for up to 9 years
when cryopreserved at −80 °C [61].
Generation of vectors for use in the clinical setting
requires the use of current Good Manufacturing Practices
(cGMP) to ensure production of high-quality vectors of
verified identity, purity, and potency. The steps required for
vector production are not complex; however, producing
robust, cGMP-compliant production systems for lentiviral
vectors has proven a bit more challenging than for producing retroviral vectors. Although lentiviral vector manufacturing has many parallels to gammaretroviral vector
production, one of the key differences that significantly
affects the manufacturing process consistency and increases
costs of lentiviral vectors is the current lack of a packaging
cell line with stable transfection of the core packaging
plasmids. The need to transiently transfect three to four
different plasmids with each vector manufacturing batch
introduces opportunity for variation that is undesirable in a
large-scale, cGMP manufacturing process. Attempts to
produce stable lentiviral packaging cell lines comparable to
those used in gammaretroviral vector production have largely failed in the past and is a major area of research in
vector development. Recently, a method for generating
clinical-grade stable packaging cell lines that continuously
produce lentiviral vectors was reported [65]. This strategy

used Cre recombinase-mediated insertion of a codonoptimized HIV-1 gag-pol construct into a constitutively
expressed locus in 293FT cells. The remaining vector
components were then transfected into a clone that
expressed high levels of gag-pol. This approach solved a
key issue with lentiviral vector production found in previous studies, which was that plasmid transfection of the
gag-pol cassette did not induce continuous high-level
expression. The availability of stable packaging cell lines
could potentially expedite the development and manufacture of new lentiviral vector-based gene therapies as well
as reduce the costs of this critical component of gene
therapy. However, toxicity induced from expression of the
other viral proteins used for packaging (i.e., Rev or VSV-G)
also remains a challenge.
Clinical use of lentiviral vectors
Lentiviral and retroviral vectors are important technologies
that are currently in development for a number of clinical
applications requiring transfer of genetic material (Fig. 4).
Lentiviral vectors have become particularly attractive for
clinical applications due to their ability to more efficiently
transduce non-proliferating or slowly proliferating cells,
such as CD34 + stem cells. The first application of lentiviral
vectors in the clinical setting used a conditionally
replication-competent lentiviral vector encoding an antisense RNA targeting the HIV envelope gene. This vector
was used to transduce mature peripheral blood T cells for
the treatment of natural HIV infection. No adverse events
attributable to the lentiviral vector were reported in this trial,
which included up to 8 years of follow-up in some patients
[66]. In addition, integration site analysis demonstrated
preferential integration within transcribed genes as expected, with no significant change in the distribution of integration sites in the pre-infusion cellular product and
engrafted T cells. Lentiviral vector-based gene transfer into
CD34 + HSCs has subsequently been applied in the treatment of several genetic diseases, including β-thalassemia
[67], X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy [51], metachromatic
leukodystrophy [68, 69], and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
[70]. No adverse events related to the vector have been
reported in these trials. In the initial study of HSCs transduced with β-globin in patients with β-thalassemia, one
patient with βE/β0
-thalassemia achieved independence from
transfusion [67]. Interestingly, this response was associated
with a relative increase in a dominant myeloid clone bearing
a lentiviral vector insertion within the HMGA2 gene locus.
It is unknown whether the insertion within this dominant
clone was merely a coincidence or selected based on
enhanced proliferation resulting from dysregulation of the
HMGA2 gene. Several studies using lentiviral vectors to
modify HSCs continue (Table 1), and longer follow-up will
be necessary to fully establish the safety of lentiviral vectors
in this therapeutic setting.
The safety of lentiviral vectors in ex vivo gene transfer
into HSCs remains a somewhat open question; however, the
field has now gained over 10 years of experience with
lentiviral vectors for gene transfer into mature T cells. There
have been several recent advances in cancer immunotherapy
using genetically modified T cells. One approach involves
the generation of cytotoxic T cells through the transduction
of a tumor-specific TCR into a patient’s own T cells. Currently, ongoing phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials are using
autologous T cells that have been transduced to express the
tumor antigens NY-ESO-1, MART-1, WT-1, and others
[71]. In a trial using a lentiviral vector to transfer a TCR
specific for a peptide that was shared by NY-ESO-1 and
LAGE-1 as a therapy for patients with multiple myeloma,
clinical responses were observed in 16 of 20 patients, with
minimal safety concerns [72]. In addition, a lentiviral vector
exhibited better transduction efficiency than a gammaretroviral vector in transducing T cells with a TCR targeting
the Melan-A/MART-1 antigen [73], and a phase 2 trial of
T cells transduced with a lentivirus to express MART-1 in
patients with metastatic melanoma is ongoing. In some
trials using TCR-modified cells, adverse effects caused by
the transferred T cells have been observed; however, at
present, there are no reports of adverse effects attributable to
the use of lentiviral vectors in these studies.

Clinical use of lentiviral vectors 1535

T cells by both lentiviral and retroviral vectors have generated
noteworthy clinical responses in patients with B-cell
malignancies. Clinical trials using CD19-targeted CAR Tcell therapy for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia have
demonstrated high efficacy, with durable complete
response rates in >60% of patients with relapsed or
refractory disease [74, 75]. In addition, complete response
rates of approximately 40 to 70% were observed in
patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma [76–78]. Several
safety concerns with CAR T-cell therapies have been
raised; however, as with TCRs, the adverse effects of
CAR T-cell therapy appear to be mechanism based and
not a result of using viral vectors [74].
One important on-target side effect of CD19 CAR T-cell
therapy is B-cell aplasia, which is associated with long-term
CAR T-cell persistence [74]. Because of the integrating
nature of lentiviral vectors and the persistence of T-cell
clones following adoptive transfer, lentiviral vector-modified
T cells appear to be capable of persisting and inducing
continued B-cell aplasia for >5 years following treatment.
The half-life of these lentiviral vector-engineered T cells is
currently unknown, but it may be lifelong. It is important to
also recognize that individuals who have received lentiviral
vector-based gene therapies may also exhibit positive testing
on some HIV testing platforms, depending upon the vector
construction and detection reagents used. Differentiating
these from natural HIV-1 infection will, therefore, be
important, and require more extensive testing.
Beyond the ex vivo modification of cells for adoptive
transfer back into the patient, lentiviral vectors are also
being applied directly in vivo for therapeutic purposes. A
phase 1/2 study of a non-primate lentiviral vector based
upon the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) expressing three genes involved in dopamine metabolism
demonstrated the safety of local lentiviral gene delivery
into the central nervous system with some evidence of
clinical benefit [79]. In vivo gene delivery using a lentiviral vector has also been applied clinically to the eye
[80]. These approaches face a number of hurdles
including efficiency, need for tissue-restricted promoters,
and immunogenicity. The latter is particularly important
since immunogenicity can be related to both the delivered
gene as well as components of the vector. As discussed
earlier, the lentiviral vector envelope captures membrane
proteins from the packaging cell lines during the budding
process. Alloimmune reactivity towards HLA class I
proteins carried within the vector envelope have been
described and can limit vector survival. Gene editing of
packaging cells to generate lines that lack HLA class I can
enhance the stability of lentiviral vectors in serum [81].
Surface engineering in addition to vector genome engineering will likely be critical for successful application of
these vectors in vivo.
Regulatory aspects to the use of lentiviral
vectors
In therapies using either gammaretroviral or lentiviral vectors, there is a theoretical potential for recombination events
to occur during vector manufacturing that result in
replication-competent retroviruses or lentiviruses (RCRs/
RCLs) [82]. Incidence of insertional mutagenesis in patients
could be increased if RCRs/RCLs are present in the vector,
due to the potential for ongoing viral replication and
insertion into the host DNA. Therefore, the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines
Agency, and most regulatory agencies require extensive
testing for RCRs/RCLs in vector products as well as in
patients [82, 83]. Testing for RCRs/RCLs is performed on
the packaging cell lines, the purified vector product, and the
genetically modified cellular therapy product before infusion into the patient. An assay that is commonly used to test
the vector or cellular products is the S+L− assay, which
involves the incubation of the test sample with a cell line
that enables viral replication [84]. Patients can be monitored
for RCRs/RCLs through polymerase chain reaction or serological assays, and the FDA suggests that patients be
monitored for recombinant virus every 3 months for the first
year after receiving gene therapy. It has been suggested that
the vigorous testing requirements for RCRs/RCLs should be
revised due to the unlikely potential for generation of
recombinant virus, the high cost of testing, and the labor
involved [82]. The third-generation SIN lentiviral vector
system makes the generation of RCLs very unlikely because
the viral genome is split into separate plasmids.
Due to the theoretical possibility of RCRs/RCLs and
secondary malignancies, health authorities in the United
States and Europe require long-term follow-up for studies of
cell and gene therapies that use viral vectors. The requirements for follow-up vary depending on the country; in the
United States, monitoring of patients at least once a year for
15 years after receiving gene therapy is recommended. The
long-term post-marketing surveillance required for the
tisagenlecleucel (CTL019; Kymriah) that was recently
approved by the FDA was in part driven by these theoretical
concerns [85]. However, the optimal duration of patient
follow-up depends on several factors, including vector
persistence and transgene expression. In addition to monitoring patients for secondary malignancies and RCRs/
RCLs, patients should be examined for new incidence or
exacerbation of pre-existing neurological, rheumatologic, or
autoimmune disorders. The FDA also requires that patients
participating in clinical trials that use viral vectors receive
information about their mechanism of action and the possible effects of DNA integration, including the risk of
delayed malignancies [86]. To help establish follow-up
procedures and collect data from patients treated with gene

therapies, clinical trials for the follow-up of patients treated
with specific gene therapy products are ongoing.
Future directions and challenges
Several ongoing areas of research are aimed at further
improving gene therapy with novel viral vector designs.
Non-integrating lentiviral vectors (NILVs) have been
investigated as a means of avoiding insertional mutagenesis.
NILVs, which are deficient in the viral integrase protein,
can transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells, and the
viral genome remains present in the cell as an episome
rather than integrating into the host genomic DNA [87]. It is
expected from the non-integrating genome structure of
NILVs that gene expression might be short-lived in dividing
cells. Although this may be undesirable in some applications, this dilutional effect might be useful in some settings,
such as CAR T cells, where long-term expression of the
genetic payload may not be necessary.
NILVs have been used effectively as a vaccination
strategy in pre-clinical models, resulting in cellular and
humoral immunity as well as anti-tumor immunity [88].
NILVs can also be co-transduced into cells with zinc finger
nucleases, which facilitate recombination of DNA encoded
in the vector with a specific site in the host DNA [89]. In a
pre-clinical study, zinc finger nucleases were used in T cells
to replace the endogenous TCR with a tumor-specific TCR
introduced by an NILV [90]. Replacing the endogenous
TCR in this manner results in abrogation of off-target
activity mediated by the endogenous TCR, thereby enhancing safety. To allow for long-term expression in dividing
cells, a dual NILV vector system was developed to include
the integrase of phage phiC31 [91].
Two types of cancer vaccines using lentiviral vectors
have been investigated: dendritic cell vaccines and cancer
cell vaccines. Dendritic cells loaded with peptide from a
tumor antigen can be used as a vaccine against cancers
expressing that antigen. One such dendritic cell vaccine,
Sipuleucel-T, has been approved by the FDA as a prostate
cancer therapy. Lentiviral vectors have been investigated as
a method of expressing tumor antigens in or modifying costimulatory signals on dendritic cells to further enhance
their efficacy [92, 93]. Lentiviral vectors have also been
used to constitutively activate the MAP kinase pathway in
dendritic cells, which resulted in enhanced anti-tumor
responses in mice [94].
An alternative vaccine approach is the use of cancer
cells, which already express the tumor antigens of interest,
instead of dendritic cells, which must be loaded with peptide. A study of B-cell lymphoma cells lentivirally transduced with co-stimulatory proteins and interleukin-12
demonstrated that using these modified cells as a vaccine
can result in enhanced immunogenicity to the parental
lymphoma cell lines in murine models [95]. Lentiviral
vectors have also been used to convert the K562 erythroleukemic cell line into artificial antigen-presenting cells
that can be used for in vitro T-cell expansion and potentially
in vivo vaccination similar to the previously-reported
GVAX [96, 97]. Although more research is needed to
determine clinical efficacy and safety of cancer vaccines
developed using lentiviral vectors, these approaches may
lead to novel therapeutic options for patients.
Lentiviral vectors have also been used to deliver components of gene editing, such as guide RNAs for the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR)-Cas9 system. The CRISPR-Cas9 system uses an
RNA sequence to guide the Cas9 nuclease to create precise
double-strand breaks, which can then be followed by
homologous recombination to result in gene deletion or
point mutations [98]. One study used a lentiviral CRISPR
guide RNA library to introduce targeted mutations into
embryonic stem cells, and subsequent identification of
phenotypic mutants demonstrated the efficacy of this
approach as an alternative to genetic screening using RNA
interference [99]. There is some concern around the
amplification of off-target effects with gene editing as a
result of integrating viruses due to the persistent expression
of the gene editing machinery. In order to overcome these
potential limitations, Chen et al. [100] described an
approach to limit the duration of editing by co-expressing a
guide RNA that recognizes the CAS9 itself targeting the
expression cassette to be destroyed. This system may be
advantageous if it offers a shorter window of CRISPR
expression over NILVs or AAV vectors. Short-term delivery via NILVs might also circumvent some of these challenges. Lentiviral vectors are also frequently used in the
research setting to alter gene expression through the
expression of short hairpin RNA or antisense RNA. Most of
these approaches are still in early stages of development,
and much further research is needed to determine whether
lentiviral vectors can serve as a viable platform for delivering these gene editing tools for therapeutic purposes.
Conclusion
Gene therapy using lentiviral vectors has emerged as a
promising therapeutic option for several conditions. The
first lentivirally transduced cellular therapy, tisagenlecleucel
(CTL019, Kymriah), was approved in the United States in
August of 2017 for the treatment of pediatric and young
adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Several
additional cellular therapies based upon lentiviral vectorengineered cells are in late-phase development. Thirdgeneration SIN lentiviral vectors, in particular, have

demonstrated safety when used to transfer genes into both
stem cells and T cells. Although there is a theoretical
potential for insertional oncogenesis with lentiviral vectors,
no cases have been reported with a natural HIV or gene
therapy using lentiviral vectors. Continued follow-up of
patients who have already received lentiviral vector-based
gene therapies is still necessary to understand the long-term
safety and efficacy of these vectors. Additional basic and
clinical research to improve transduction efficiency and
manufacturing are also still needed.
