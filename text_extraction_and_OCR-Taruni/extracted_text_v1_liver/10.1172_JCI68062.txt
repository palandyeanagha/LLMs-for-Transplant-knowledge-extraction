the quest for mechanisms

Advances made during the last 35 years have improved our understanding 
of the mechanisms of steroid hormone action on bone and how physiologic, 
pathologic, or iatrogenic changes in hormone levels can lead to increased 
fracture risk. Estrogens, androgens, and glucocorticoids alter the cellular 
composition of bone by regulating the supply and lifespan of osteoclasts 
and osteoblasts. Additionally, they influence the survival of osteocytes, longlived cells that are entombed within the mineralized matrix and mediate the 
homeostatic adaptation of bone to mechanical forces. Altered redox balance 
is a proximal underlying mechanism of some of these effects, and sex steroid 
deficiency or glucocorticoid excess contributes to the aging of the skeleton.
Changes in steroid hormone levels are 
important factors in the development of 
osteoporosis, one of the most common 
metabolic disorders in the aging populations of the Western world. During the 
last 35 years, I had the privilege of partaking in the quest to elucidate the mechanisms of steroid hormone action on bone 
and the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. The 
following is a brief travelogue of some key 
discoveries that have shaped our thinking 
along the way.
Appreciation of the important role of 
gonads in the growth of the skeleton dates 
back to Aristotle (384–322 BCE), but it 
was Fuller Albright in the 1940s who first 
suggested a critical role of sex steroids in 
skeletal homeostasis during adulthood by 
pointing to an association between menopause and loss of bone mass (1). A decade 
earlier, Harvey Cushing had made the initial connection among the pituitary, the 
adrenals, and bone abnormalities (2). By 
the mid-1970s, when I started my thesis 
work on “Effect of Steroids on Bone,” it 
had been well documented that decline or 
loss of gonadal function after adulthood 
increases the rate of bone turnover in animals and humans of either sex and leads 
to loss of bone mass and increased fracture 
risk. Moreover, iatrogenic glucocorticoid 
excess had become the second-most recognizable cause of osteoporosis in women 
and men, both young and old.
The search for cellular and molecular 
mechanisms began in earnest with the 
detection in whole bone of high-affinity 
receptors for glucocorticoids and 1,25 
dihydroxyvitamin D, another steroid hormone with a profound role in mineral 
homeostasis (3). Identification of receptors for gonadal steroids in bone was more 
difficult, and it took another decade of 
intensive search before estrogen (and then 
androgen) receptors were detected in isolated bone cells (4, 5). The reason for the 
difficulty proved to be the much lower 
concentration of receptors for this class 
of steroid hormones in mature bone cells 
compared with reproductive organs. Unexpectedly, it was revealed 25 years later that 
estrogen receptor α (ERα) in osteoblasts 
and osteoclasts mediates the protective 
effects of estrogen in cortical and cancellous bone, respectively. More surprisingly, 
ERα in osteoblasts stimulates cortical bone 
accrual in response to mechanical strain, 
independently of estrogens (6).
The detection of receptors for steroid hormones in bone cells automatically led to the 
idea that steroid hormones must modulate 
their biosynthetic activity. Not long after, it 
was shown that steroid hormones do not 
merely alter the function of existing bone 
cells, but are in fact potent regulators of 
their generation and lifespan. The linchpin 
for this conceptual advance was the discovery of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D receptors 
in monocytes and activated T lymphocytes 
(7) and the effects of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D on monocyte differentiation and 
on cytokine production by T cells (8). The 
relevance of these findings to other steroid 
hormones soon became evident with the 
demonstration of potent effects of estrogens and androgens on osteoclastogenesis 
via cytokine-mediated mechanisms (9, 10).
In two papers published in JCI two 
months apart in 1998, we demonstrated 
that both estrogens and glucocorticoids 
restrain osteoblastogenesis and that glucocorticoids shorten the lifespan of mature 
osteoblasts and osteocytes by stimulating apoptosis (11, 12). Shortly after, it 
was found that estrogens and androgens 
prolong osteoblast and osteocyte survival by attenuating apoptosis (13, 14). 
On the other hand, estrogens and androgens shorten the lifespan of osteoclasts, 
whereas glucocorticoids prolong it (15). 
Bone cell apoptosis has since become an 
intense focus in the study of the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, as well as of the 
mechanism of action of anti-osteoporotic 
drugs (16). This body of work has clearly 
established that steroid hormones influence the cellular composition of bone as 
opposed to merely regulating existing cell 
function (17). Moreover, it directed us to 
think of osteocytes as important cellular 
targets of steroid hormone action. Parallel 
advances in osteocyte biology heightened 
the significance of this concept. It is now 
well appreciated that this third and most 
abundant bone cell type plays a central role 
in the choreography of bone remodeling 
by controlling rate-limiting steps of bone 
resorption and formation. Osteocytes are 
the major cellular source of RANKL for 
physiologic as well as pathologic bone 
remodeling (18), and mounting evidence 
suggests that osteocyte death by apoptosis 
and/or dysfunction, such as from compromised autophagy, plays a seminal role 
in the pathogenesis of involutional, postmenopausal, glucocorticoid- and immobilization-induced osteoporosis (19).

cells (Figure 1) opened a new chapter of 
the quest: the exploration of their role 
in redox homeostasis. During the last 
ten years, studies in animal models have 
revealed that advancing age progressively 
increases oxidative stress in the skeleton 
(20). ROS attenuate osteoblastogenesis 
and shorten the lifespan of osteoblasts 
and osteocytes. On the other hand, ROS 
are required for osteoclast generation, 
function, and survival. Increased ROS generation leads to the activation of FOXOs, 
a family of transcription factors that represent an important defense mechanism 
against oxidative stress. In osteoblasts, as 
in other cell lineages, FOXOs provide an 
optimal balance among the maintenance 
of self-renewing stem cells, the replication 
of lineage-committed progenitors, and 
the survival of their terminally differentiated progeny. On the other hand, FOXOs 
inhibit osteoclast generation by attenuating ROS. Estrogens or androgens decrease 
oxidative stress (20, 21), whereas glucocorticoids enhance it (22). Conversely, estrogen or androgen deficiency increases ROS 
generation and p53 activation in a manner 
similar to aging. Moreover, the adverse 
effects of estrogen or androgen loss on 
bone in the murine model are prevented 
by antioxidants. Thus, age-related changes 
in the production of steroids in the ovaries 
and the adrenals, (23) as well as iatrogenic 
hyperglucocorticoidism, contribute to the 
pathogenesis of osteoporosis by accentuating age-related mechanisms intrinsic to 
bone and oxidative stress.
I expect that in years to come, understanding of the mechanisms I discussed 
here will evolve, additional mechanisms 
will be elucidated, and the target genes 
of steroid hormone action on bone will 
become much clearer than they are now. 
What I believe will endure, however, are the 
overarching themes that for regenerating 
tissues, such as bone, cell number is more 
important than cell vigor; that different 
steroid hormones affect very similar cellular processes; and that age-related mechanisms are protagonists in the pathogenesis 
of osteoporosis, and changes in steroid 
hormones are contributory. The satisfaction and joy of sharing this journey with 
a synergistic research team has been an 
added personal bonus for this traveler.

Figure 1
Steroid hormones influence the birth and death of bone cells. Osteoclasts and osteoblasts are 
derived from hematopoietic and mesenchymal precursors, respectively. Osteoclast generation, 
function, and survival require RANKL signaling via its receptor, RANK, as well as mitochondrial 
biogenesis coupled with iron uptake through transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and iron supply to 
mitochondrial respiratory proteins; both cascades lead to increased H2O2 generation, which promotes osteoclastogenesis. Osteoblast generation is critically dependent on WNT/β-catenin/TCF 
signaling. ROS, which are primarily generated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, activate 
FOXO transcription factors that suppress H2O2 production and decrease osteoclastogenesis. 
ROS also decrease the proliferation/differentiation of committed osteoblast precursors, by a 
diversion of β-catenin from WNT/β-catenin/TCF– to FOXO-mediated transcription. During the 
process of bone remodeling, bone matrix excavated by osteoclasts is replaced with new matrix 
produced by osteoblasts. Glucocorticoids (at supraphysiologic levels) and estrogens or androgens influence the generation and lifespan of osteoclasts and osteoblasts and the lifespan of 
osteocytes, at least in part, by altering redox balance. Black and red lines pointing to mature 
osteoclasts and osteoblasts on the bone surface and osteocytes embedded in the matrix indicate prolongation and shortening effects, respectively, on lifespan.
