Abstract
Background Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)
in childhood is a rare disease with frequent progression to
end-stage renal disease and a high recurrence after kidney
transplantation. Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to complement protein C5, may be beneficial in the treatment of aHUS.
Case-diagnosis/treatment A 6-year-old girl developed
aHUS with only slightly elevated C3d (4.4%), no mutations
in complement factors, and no antibodies against factor H.
Plasma exchange treatment was successful initially, until
aHUS recurred. After reinitiating plasma exchange, normalization of the platelet count and improvement of
hemolysis occurred, but renal function worsened. Renal function then improved dramatically promptly after the switch to
eculizumab.
Conclusions This case demonstrates that platelet count is
not always a reliable marker for improvement of aHUS and
that eculizumab can prevent dialysis in plasma-resistant
aHUS patients.

Introduction
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a severe disease
characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney failure. In
children, over 90% of HUS is caused by a Shiga toxinproducing E. coli (STEC) infection [1]. The remaining
cases, termed atypical HUS (aHUS), concern a heterogeneous group of diseases, the majority having a dysregulation
of the complement system. Atypical HUS has a poor prognosis: It frequently progresses to end-stage renal disease,
often recurs after renal transplantation, and has a high mortality rate. Plasma therapy is the current treatment of choice.
However, the latest case reports show the possible benefit of
eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to
complement protein C5, thereby preventing activation of the
terminal complement pathway [2–5]. Two phase II eculizumab trials in adults and adolescents with aHUS resistant to,
or dependent on, plasmapheresis, showed promising results
[6–8]. Five of the seven plasmapheresis-resistant dialysis
patients became free of dialysis [6]. An open-label multicenter phase II eculizumab trial in children aged from
1 month to 18 years has recently started (NCT 01193348).
Here we describe the successful treatment with eculizumab of a 6-year-old girl with aHUS, partially resistant to
plasmapheresis.
Case report
A formerly healthy 6-year-old girl presented with fever,
vomiting, and lethargy without diarrhea. Laboratory tests
revealed hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and severe
renal insufficiency consistent with HUS. STEC and other
bacterial and viral infectious agents were not detected.

Analysis of the complement system revealed only a slightly
elevated C3d of 4.4% (reference value <3%). Although
platelet count initially spontaneously increased to 195×109
/l,
the girl’s kidney function progressively deteriorated and she
developed severe hypertension. Plasmapheresis with freshfrozen plasma (FFP) 80 ml/kg was initiated at the 7th day of
admission for 3 days consecutively, followed by every other
day for 3 weeks. Serum creatinine started to decline, platelet
count further increased, and signs of hemolysis disappeared.
After 3 weeks, plasmapheresis was replaced by plasma
infusions.
Genetic work-up showed no mutations in complement
factor H, I, B, complement C3, or MCP. Multiplex ligationdependant probe amplification (MLPA) to detect the presence of homozygous deletions in the complement factor Hrelated 1 (CFHR1) gene was not performed. No factor H
antibodies were detected. Lupus anticoagulins and antinuclear autoantibodies were negative and ADAMTS 13 activity was normal. In the 6th week after initial presentation, the
girl developed an upper respiratory infection with recurrence of aHUS. Plasmapheresis was immediately reinstituted for 3 days consecutively, followed by an alternate
day regimen. Although the platelet count promptly increased, renal function kept deteriorating and hypertension
was hard to control with a four antihypertensive drug regimen. After renal biopsy confirmed severe thrombotic microangiopathy without globally sclerosed glomeruli (Fig. 1),
plasma therapy was again intensified to daily exchanges.
This had no effect on renal function; the girl became oliguric
and needed dialysis. At that point, therapy was switched to
eculizumab (Soliris®, 600 mg intravenously once weekly,
followed by 600 mg every other week). Thereupon,
renal function started to improve within 48 h (Fig. 2), diuresis
increased and over weeks the four antihypertensive drugs could
be reduced to ACE-inhibition monotherapy. Prophylactic therapy with feneticilline was started and the girl was vaccinated
against Neisseria meningococcus with a quadrivalent vaccine
(Mencevax ACWY) and against Streptococcus pneumoniae
(Pneumovax®, a 23-valent vaccine). There were no adverse
events. Currently, 9 months after initiation of eculizumab
treatment, renal function is normal, proteinuria minimal
(urinary protein/creatinine 30 mg/mmol), and hypertension
has disappeared. Alternate-week eculizumab infusions are
continued.
Discussion
Here we describe a child with relapsing aHUS with normalized platelet count during intensive plasmapheresis, but
ongoing decline in renal function, whose renal function
remarkably ameliorated with eculizumab treatment, thereby
bypassing the need for renal replacement therapy.
Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
binds to complement protein C5, thereby preventing the
formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The
fact that renal function of our patient promptly improved
through blocking of the terminal pathway by eculizumab
confirms the central role of complement in aHUS, despite
almost normal complement analysis. Furthermore, we found
no mutations in the complement system, although MLPA
reaction of the CFHR1 gene was not performed, nor factor
H antibodies.
As platelet counts had normalized, our patient was not
eligible for the international study on effects of eculizumab
in children with aHUS (NCT 01193348). However, this case
clearly shows that a rise in platelet count is not always a
reliable marker of disease recovery and the search for other
biomarkers for disease activity management is still warranted. Fortunately, eculizumab treatment led to a recovery
of the acute renal failure, by not only normalizing renal
function but also hypertension and proteinuria. Eculizumab
even seems to be more effective than plasmapheresis considering the lower amount of proteinuria at 4 weeks after
plasma therapy compared to eculizumab treatment, shown

in Table 1. Eculizumab therapy is still being continued, at
600 mg IV every 2 weeks, with sustained remission. The
optimal dose, dosing interval, and duration of treatment are
unclear and need further study.
In conclusion, in this case, an adequate, intensive plasmapheresis schedule started immediately at relapse of aHUS
restored the hematological parameters, but not kidney function. However, the switch to eculizumab saved this patient
from dialysis treatment and even normalized the kidney
function. Treatment with complement inhibitors has a high
potential to become the standard therapy for aHUS, even in
patients with no complement mutations identified.
