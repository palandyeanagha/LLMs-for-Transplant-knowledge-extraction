Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents an important and growing public health problem, chronically infecting an estimated 70 million people worldwide. This blood-borne pathogen is
generating a new wave of infections in the United States, associated with increasing intravenous drug use over the last decade. In most cases, HCV establishes a chronic infection,
sometimes causing cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Although a curative therapy exists, it is extremely expensive and provides no barrier to
reinfection; therefore, a vaccine is urgently needed. The virion is asymmetric and heterogeneous with the buoyancy and protein content similar to low-density lipoparticles. Core
protein is unstructured, and of the two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2, the function of
E1 remains enigmatic. E2 is responsible for specifically binding host receptors CD81 and
scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). This review will focus on structural progress on HCV
virion, core protein, envelope glycoproteins, and specific host receptors.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated
70 million people globally, in a bimodal age
distribution (Moore et al. 2019). Baby boomers
had a higher exposure rate to HCV between the
1960s and the 1980s, mainly from blood transfusion prior to screening efforts (∼40%) or from
intravenous drug use (30%) (Williams 1999).
The fastest growing population, however, is
among young adults who have a history of intravenous drug use. For people ages 20–39, new
diagnoses tripled between 2005 and 2015 (Shiffman 2018). Direct-acting antiviral drugs
(DAAs) now present a means for curing HCV
infection, albeit an expensive one, costing between $26,500 and $94,500 depending on regimen. This cure now boasts a near-100% rate of
effectiveness on all HCV genotypes tested, but it
is limited in its impact on public health by cost.
Once cured, a person has no barrier to reinfection, which is of particular concern in the
context of addiction and intravenous drug use.
Furthermore, a person cured of HCV might have
a higher likelihood of developing hepatocellular
carcinoma than if they were treated with interferon (Cardoso et al. 2016; Conti et al. 2016; Reig
et al. 2016a); this is controversial because of sample size and cohort variability among studies
(Reig et al. 2016b; Guarino et al. 2018). For these

reasons, development of effective vaccine strategies remains the ultimate goal of HCV research.
An effective vaccine would elicit the production of antibodies that bind tightly and
specifically to epitopes that are common to all
genotypes of HCV and that efficiently neutralize
the viral particle. Broadly neutralizing antibodies directly implicate the viral epitopes that, if
correctly reconstituted in isolation, could form
the basis of safe and effective vaccine candidates.
For this reason, the structural characterization
of the surface-accessible epitopes remains a subject of significant interest.
As a chronic infection, HCV maintains its
reservoir in the liver as well as its transmissibility
circulating in the bloodstream for decades.
People living with these infections develop antibodies against HCV, but these are generally
genotype- or subgenotype-specific and nonneutralizing. The former indicates that epitopes
available for antibody binding are variable. The
latter suggests that antibody binding to these
epitopes does not interfere with the mechanics
of viral infection. The mechanisms of how HCV
tolerates these antibodies and evades immune
clearance over the course of a human lifetime
continues to be a mystery that warrants attention
and may provide insight into indirect methods
of controlling or limiting the impact of HCV
infection.
HCV was initially defined by what it was not.
Under the electron microscope, sera from viral
hepatitis patients are distinguishable by the viral
particles they contain, and identification affects
patient prognosis as well as precautions against
transmission. The regular, icosahedral shape of
naked hepatitis A virus capsids appear in striking contrast to the circulating viral products of
hepatitis B, where enveloped empty and full
capsids of two different sizes appear among
elongated particles of empty envelope material.
Neither these hallmarks, nor any others common to viruses in circulation, were observed in
sera from non-A/non-B hepatitis patients as
HCV was called before it was positively identified (Holland and Alter 1981). Eventually, HCV
was identified by serologic exclusion of both
hepatitis A and hepatitis B and was eventually
followed by positive immunological identification (Vitvitski et al. 1979; Holland and Alter
1981).
The low rate of HCV virus production (about
seven virions per hepatocyte per day) that befits a
chronic infection has also hindered the progress
of research on the structure of HCV viral particles. In the whole-liver context,∼1012 virions are
made per day (Neumann et al. 1998), but tissue
culture has a far lower capacity. Structural observations have either been made from systems designed to circumvent this limitation or inferred
by homology to more amenable relatives whose
fields have advanced more quickly than HCV
research. HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae
family, along with dengue, West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. HCV contains a 9.6-kbp
(+)ssRNA genome, expressing a single polyprotein that is cleaved into its 10 mature components by host and viral encoded proteases. In
HCV, core (C) protein is expressed first, followed
by the envelope (E) protein(s), an ion channel
( p7), and then the nonstructural (NS) proteins.
As they are produced, virions traffic through the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, acquiring glycosylation to generate the mature particle
for circulation in the bloodstream. Virions enter
cells through an endosomal triggering event that
launches the nucleocapsid into the host cytoplasm. Unlike other family members, HCV is
not transmitted via arthropod and so has no
need for a temperature-based switch, as was observed in dengue virus (Zhang et al. 2013). So,
although several inferences can be made based
on homology to better-studied systems, these
models need to be tested for relevance in HCV.
HCV circulates in the bloodstream for
blood-contact-based transmission; even minute
quantities of blood have resulted in transmission
(Hosoglu et al. 2003; Egro et al. 2017). HCV
targets the liver by binding to receptors in the
lipid metabolism pathway, including scavenger
receptor class B type I (SR-BI), claudin-1, and
occludin, and heavily remodels and utilizes the
lipoparticle biosynthetic pathway in its life cycle.
These mechanisms affect clinical presentation,
particularly regarding liver steatosis and nonhepatic symptoms including atherosclerosis
(Targher et al. 2007) and heart attack (Butt
et al. 2017). The mechanisms by which this virus

so efficiently targets the liver, evades immune
response, and proceeds to chronic infection warrant careful consideration.
With only 10 proteins, HCV manages to
perpetuate itself both chronically in the individual and persistently in the population. The
means by which these ends are achieved are
founded in the elegant and robust structural
mechanisms that HCV viral products use to survive and propagate in and among hosts. What
follows is an examination of those structures and
mechanisms that have been observed, although
much remains to be explored.
STRUCTURE OF THE VIRION
Once serological identification of HCV and subsequent validation of anti-HCV antibodies was
successful, immunogold-labeled HCV was positively identified under the electron microscope.
Its smooth lipid-like surface and variable size are
consistent with host apolipoparticles, leaving little wonder why initial attempts at visual identification failed (Catanese et al. 2013).
Co-expression of HCV structural proteins in
a baculovirus system generated a size- and
shape-heterogeneous population of purified
particles from which a small set of isometric,
50-nm diameter particles was used to calculate
an icosahedral reconstruction. Although limited
in resolution (30 Å), the smooth surface was
compared favorably to the icosahedrally ordered
layer of envelope protein that is tightly associated with a lipid bilayer in related flavivirus
structures that have been solved to near-atomic
resolution (Yu et al. 2007). In this model, E1 and
E2 together represent the discrete assembly unit,
whereas other flaviviruses utilize a single E protein (Kuhn et al. 2002; Modis et al. 2003). The
core protein was not observed as an icosahedrally ordered structure, suggesting that any nucleocapsid would be randomly oriented relative
to the envelope protein as schematically shown
in Figure 1A. This organization is inconsistent
with the size and shape heterogeneity observed
in that sample, so it might represent a special
case within a diverse population. Nonconforming particles may simply represent more random
packing of the envelope proteins (Fig. 1B).
HCV virions from primary liver cells or
Huh-7.5 cells were specifically concentrated onto coated EM grids via immunocapture (Catanese et al. 2013). Extensive size analysis under
both negative stain and cryo conditions indicate
a continuous distribution of diameters, mostly
between 50 and 85 nm, but ranging from 40 to
100 nm. If this size heterogeneity were a result of
polymorphism in an icosahedrally ordered system, then the diameter distribution would cluster into discrete modes, each correlated to a
T number of quasi-equivalent environments
for each assembly unit (Caspar 1980; Kellenberger 1990; Damle et al. 2012). As this is not
the case, a more flexible model is indicated.
The continuously variable size of HCV
virions may be a result of variable lipid content

(Fig. 1C). The density of HCV virions ranges
from 1.01 to 1.25 with infectivity associated
with particles that have specific gravity of
∼1.12 g/mL (Lindenbach et al. 2005). This is
consistent with the uniform exclusion of uranyl
acetate from most virion particles in negative
stain EM and with the lack of lipid bilayer structures in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
(Catanese et al. 2013).
Immunogold labeling identified apolipoproteins, ApoAI, ApoB, and ApoE, on the surface of HCV virions (Catanese et al. 2013), and
some biochemical evidence indicates that ApoB
and ApoE bind specifically to the ectodomain of
E1 (Mazumdar et al. 2011). This further contraindicates an icosahedral envelope lattice as these
host proteins would have to displace part of the
viral protein lattice and are generally associated
with lipoparticles rather than lipid bilayers. Immunocapture of HCV virions from Huh7.5 cells
and from patient serum followed by negative
stain showed similar internal structures not previously observed (Piver et al. 2017). Although
these particles exhibit a number of staining
and desiccation artifacts, absent in previous
studies, this desiccation appears to have fortuitously granted stain the access to internal structures. Although particle sizes were not systematically measured, diameters appear to range
from 50 to 200 nm in this sample, which may
be attributed to RNA and lipid regions (Fig. 1D).
The emerging model of the HCV virion suggests that HCV evades the immune system while
circulating in the blood by disguising itself as
lipoparticles of approximate size and density
of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs).
This model is consistent with the development
of antibodies against apolipoproteins by people
chronically infected with HCV (Bridge et al.
2018), the high rate of progression to chronic
infection (70%–80%) (Alter et al. 1999), blood
contact modes of transmission, and viral use of
lipoparticle receptors for hepatocyte targeting
(discussed below).
CORE
The viral core protein is a 191-amino-acid-long
protein (21 kDa) and the first protein in the viral
polyprotein. The amino-terminal domain, D1, is
∼120 residues long and condenses with the viral
RNA genome to form the nucleocapsid (Fig. 1,
green and magenta, respectively). Consistent
with its RNA-binding function, D1 is nearly
20% arginine, but it is also high in glycine and
proline (∼14% each) indicative of an intrinsically unstructured or elastomeric domain (Cheng
et al. 2010). This has been observed experimentally, where recombinant D1 alone is disordered
(Boulant et al. 2005). The carboxy-terminal domain, D2, is ∼50 residues long and associates
with lipid droplets and ER membranes. Leucine
and alanine account for 30% of the residues in
D2, consistent with a hydrophobic domain. The
last ∼20 residues serve as a signal sequence (SS)
for the next protein, E1, and are cleaved from the
core by an intramembrane-cleaving signal peptide peptidase after residue 177, yielding a mature size of ∼19 kDa (Fig. 2A; Kato et al. 2003;
Lussignol et al. 2016).
The classical model for trafficking a nascent
peptide to the ER involves an amino-terminal SS
that forms a hydrophobic transmembrane (TM)
helix. Briefly, the ribosome translates the SS,
which is recognized by the signal recognition
particle (SRP), temporarily pausing translation.
The SRP binds to its receptor on the ER membrane and threads the SS into the channel of the
Sec61 translocon. Translation continues and the
SS is proteolytically removed (Ellgaard et al.
2016). The SS for E1 is identified by its hydrophobicity and proximity to the cleavage site,
but it is also preceded by the hydrophobic D2
domain, which is predicted to contain another
SS between residues 129 and 149. The guided
entry of tail-anchored proteins (the GET pathway) was described in yeast (Wang et al. 2014).
The Get3 homolog in humans, TRC40, inserts
tail-anchored proteins in an ATP-dependent
manner, leaving the amino-terminal domain(s)
exposed to the cytosol (Stefanovic and Hegde
2007), and can deliver cargo to the Sec61 translocon (Johnson et al. 2012). Although this has
not yet been tested for HCV proteins, herpesviruses EBV and HSV-1 have both been shown to
exploit TRC40 for localization of their membrane-embedded proteins (Horst et al. 2011;
Ott et al. 2016).

E1 ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN
Viral envelope glycoprotein E1 (Figs. 1 and 2A,
purple) is 192 amino acids long (21 kDa) after it
has been proteolytically cleaved from the viral
polyprotein between residues 192 and 383. The
carboxy-terminal TM helix of the core protein,
residues 178–191, is sufficient to target E1 to the
lumen of the ER. The hairpin-helix-sheet of the
amino-terminal ectodomain, residues 192–276
(Fig. 2B), was crystallized as a heavily entwined
homohexamerwith two different dimer interfaces. The ectodomain has an amino-terminal hairpin that dimerizes to form one dimer interface,
and a helix and three-strandedβ-sheet thatforms
the other (Fig. 2A, pink/dark purple and purple/
dark purple, respectively; El Omari et al. 2014). A
carboxy-terminal TM helix serves as the SS for
the next protein E2 and then anchors E1 to the
membrane. The intervening half of the protein,
residues ∼271–363, is poorly characterized but
does contain an absolutely conserved sequence,

residues 313–327, which is targeted by a series of
broadly neutralizing antibodies (Meunier et al.
2008; Kong et al. 2015) and a putative fusion
loop, residues 265–296 (Banda et al. 2019).
E2 ENVELOPE GLYCOPROTEIN
The viral envelope glycoprotein E2 (Figs. 1 and
2A, orange) is a 363-amino-acid-long (40-kDa)
protein, residues 384–746, and is reported to
bind to receptors SR-BI and CD81 (discussed
below). Like E1, it has an amino-terminal ectodomain (residues 384–661) and a carboxy-terminal TM helix, although in E2 these features
are separated by an amphipathic stem helix,
residues 662 on. The ectodomain includes three
hypervariable regions (HVR1, HVR2, and
HVR3, corresponding to residues 385–411,
475–481, and 556–580, respectively) to facilitate
immune evasion, although HVR1 is disordered
in existing structures (Flyak et al. 2018). Several
crystal structures have been determined for most
of the E2 ectodomain (Kong et al. 2013; Khan
et al. 2014; Flyak et al. 2018), residues 422–591,
and all are in good agreement (Fig. 2A). This
portion of the protein adopts an Ig-like β sandwich, stabilized by disulfide bonds, and HVR2
and HVR3 are surface exposed (Fig. 2C).
DIMERIZATION MODELS OF E1 AND E2
The E1/E2 heterodimer was proposed on the
basis of familial ties to the better-studied flaviviruses such as dengue. Such viruses have a single,
53-kDa envelope protein (E) that is embedded in
an envelope bilayer forming a complete, icosahedrally ordered shell of uniform diameter
(Kuhn et al. 2002). The combined molecular
weights of E1 and E2 (∼61 kDa) is attractively
close to this size, and overexpression of these
proteins can occasionally form icosahedra; however, coexpressed E1/E2 tends to aggregate (Cocquerel et al. 2003).
DIVISION OF LABOR BETWEEN THE TWO
PROTEINS
Generally, an enveloped virus requires that its
outer surface provide three functions: evade the
immune system, identify an appropriate host
cell through receptor binding, and delivery of
the nucleocapsid to the cell through membrane
fusion. That immune evasion is aided by virus
association with host lipoparticles was discussed
above, and receptor binding will be discussed
below, but first will be a comment about membrane fusion.
E2 was assigned the role of type II fusion
protein modeled on the basis of disulfide links
(Krey et al. 2010) until the structures were determined (Kong et al. 2013; Khan et al. 2014;
Flyak et al. 2018). Then, by exclusion, E1 was
assigned this role. Again, the structure determined that the E1 ectodomain was inconsistent
with a type II fusion protein (El Omari et al.
2014). A significant part of the E1 protein was
absent in the structure solved, which includes a
putative fusion loop. However, perhaps additional mechanisms should be considered.
CD81
HCV requires multiple factors for productive
entry (Lindenbach and Rice 2013). However,
only CD81 and SR-BI have been shown to directly interact with E2 (Pileri et al. 1998; Scarselli
et al. 2002). CD81 is an integral membrane protein of the tetraspanin family that contains four
TM helices and two extracellular loops, designated as the small and large extracellular loop
(SEL and LEL, respectively). CD81 has been
shown to be important for HCV entry by
RNAi knockdown experiments as well as entry
inhibition by addition of exogenous CD81-LEL
or antibodies against CD81 (Zhang et al. 2004;
Flint et al. 2006). Given that CD81 is widely
expressed in a variety of cells, it does not explain
the liver tropism of HCV and may function after
initial recruitment of the virus on the host cell.
In the liver, CD81 is expressed on both the sinusoidal endothelium and the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes (Reynolds et al. 2008) The
CD81-binding site for E2 has been localized to
the LEL and specific residues essential for the
interaction have been identified (Higginbottom
et al. 2000; Drummer et al. 2002). Although the
LEL appears to be the major recognition site for
E2, regions outside of the LEL can influence

HCV susceptibility into hepatoma cells (Banse
et al. 2018).
Initial structural and biophysical studies
were focused on the CD81 LEL, owing to the
important role it has in HCV entry (Kitadokoro
et al. 2001, 2002). CD81 LEL forms a dimer in
solution and in several different crystal forms.
The CD81 LEL domain organization has been
likened to a mushroom-like structure formed by
five helices (labeled A–E) with helices A and E
forming the stalk, whereas helices B, C, and D
represent the cap. The LEL contains two disulfides that stabilize the fold. The absolutely conserved CCG motif (residues 156–158) of the LEL
located on the B–C loop forms two disulfides
with residue 190 of helix E and residue 175 on
the C–D loop. Mutating the disulfides destabilizes the CD81-LEL conformation and diminishes E2 binding (Petracca et al. 2000).
The E2-binding site has been localized to the
cap region consisting of the C and D helices as
well as the intervening loop. Comparison of several hCD81-LEL structures revealed that the C
and D helices can undergo conformational fluctuations, whereas the conformation of stalk
helices remains relatively fixed. Solution-based
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of
hCD81-LEL confirmed the existence of A, B,
C, and E helices, whereas the D helix was mostly
disordered (Rajesh et al. 2012). Furthermore,
analysis of 15 independent views of CD81 LEL
across several different structures determined by
X-ray crystallography have shown the C and D
helices in at least three distinct conformations:
open, closed, and intermediate (Cunha et al.
2017). Molecular dynamic simulations suggest
that the state of the head group was pH dependent with the open conformation being more
prevalent at low pH. This flexibility may be a
result of the orientation of the conserved
C157–C175 disulfide bond, which is found in
multiple conformations. The authors proposed
that the conformational flexibility of the head
region may be exploited by HCV during endosomal acidification in the entry process. The
current evidence suggests that CD81–E2 interaction is based upon flexible regions of both
molecules that adopt a more ordered structure
upon binding.
Recently, the structure of the full-length
CD81 was determined by X-ray crystallography
(Zimmerman et al. 2016). To assist in protein
production, the intracellular cysteine residues
that are sites of palmitoylation were mutated
and the resulting protein was produced and
crystallized in the presence of detergent and
cholesterol. The overall structure resembles a
waffle cone with the LEL covering the four TM
helices, which form a wedge shape. The TMs are
arranged as two separated pairs of antiparallel
helices: TM1/TM2 and the other TM3/TM4.
The organization of the TMs does not resemble
any known integral membrane protein structure. This arrangement of TMs results in the
formation of a large cavity containing additional
electron density, which was identified as a single,
bound cholesterol molecule.
The full-length CD81 structure consists of a
monomer in the asymmetric unit. Superposition of the CD81 LEL dimeric structure onto
the full-length structure results in a clash between the second LEL molecule and the TMs
of the full-length structure. This clash would
suggest that the dimeric LEL may be a biochemical artifact. However, molecular dynamics simulation of the full-length structure in the absence of cholesterol suggested that the LEL
would be in an extended open conformation,
which may expose the LEL dimer interface
(Fig. 3). However, because the LEL dimer is in
a head-to-tail orientation, the second CD81
molecule would need to be in an orientation
that would not be consistent with a flat membrane. Therefore, the membrane would need to
be curved or, alternatively, the second molecule
could come from another cell.
SR-BI
SR-BI is the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor whose primary role is to mediate uptake
of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the cell without internalization of the particle (Pittman et al.
1987). SR-BI has hepatocyte specific expression,
suggesting a possible role in primary attachment
to the target cells. HDL has been shown to
enhance infectivity of HCV pseudoparticles
(HCVpp) and HCV virions derived from cell

negative, blue for positive, and white for neutral). (C) Ribbon rendition of the full-length, human CD81 structure
(PDB ID 5TCX) modeled approximately on to an idealized lipid bilayer (stick representation) (a simulated
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer). The transmembrane (TM) helices are colored beige, whereas the
LEL is colored as a rainbow. The small extracellular loop (SEL) is located between TM helices 1 and 2, while
the LEL is located between TMs 3 and 4. The five helices in the LEL are labeled A–E. The SEL is present in the
crystallization construct, but disordered. Cholesterol from the crystallization solution is rendered as a space-filled
model (left). A single molecule of bound cholesterol is shown in a sphere representation between the four TMs.
(D) Superposition of the full-length CD81 structure (beige) with the LEL dimer colored blue and green for the
two molecules in the asymmetric unit. (E) The LEL of the full-length CD81 has been proposed to undergo an
open-to-closed transition upon cholesterol (green ligand) binding, the reverse of a closed-to-open transition
modeled using molecular dynamics (Zimmerman et al. 2016). The coloring used is similar to panel A.

culture (HCVcc) (Dreux et al. 2006; Voisset et al.
2006). Furthermore, antibodies against SR-BI,
siRNA-mediated knockdown, and mutations
to the intracellular and ectodomain of SR-BI
result in a significant inhibition of HCV infectivity (Bartosch et al. 2003; Dreux et al. 2009).
The region of E2 responsible for SR-BI binding
has been mapped to HVR1 of E2 (Bartosch et al.
2005). It has been hypothesized that binding of
SR-BI to E2 enhances CD81 binding (Bankwitz
et al. 2010). Therefore, HVR1 region has been
proposed to conceal the CD81-binding site and
to block conserved epitopes mediating virus
neutralization on E2 (Bankwitz et al. 2010).
SR-BI is a member of the class B scavenger
receptor family of proteins, which also includes
CD36 and the lysosomal integral membrane
protein-2 (LIMP-2) also referred to scavenger
receptor class B member 2 (SCARB2). SR-BI is
a type III membrane protein with amino- and
carboxy-terminal TM helices with both termini
located in the cytoplasm. The majority of the
protein is located between the TMs, forming a
large extracellular domain. Currently, structural
information on SR-BI is lacking; however, models can be predicted from several, published
structures of LIMP-2 and CD36 ectodomains
(Neculai et al. 2013; Dang et al. 2014; Zhao
et al. 2014; Hsieh et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2019).
LIMP-2 and CD36 have an overall globular
shape formed by a 13-stranded antiparallel βbarrel with several short α-helices on the periphery. The SR-BI ectodomain is heavily modified
post translation with 10 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites and two disulfide bonds (C321–
C323, C274–C329). The two disulfide bonds are
conserved in CD36 and LIMP-2, suggesting that
these are critical for the overall fold. However,
only one glycosylation site is conserved among
the three proteins, which may reflect their different biological functions.
A remarkable feature of the structures is the
presence of an internal tunnel that traverses the
entire length of the ectodomain from the lipid
bilayer to a solvent opening close on the apex
(Fig. 4A). The tunnel has been proposed to mediate selective lipid uptake from HDL and
efflux of cellular cholesterol to HDL transport
lipids. Block lipid transport 1 (BLT-1) is a
small-molecule inhibitor of lipid transport by
SR-BI that covalently modifies C384 (Nieland
et al. 2002; Yu et al. 2011). C384 is located in
the lumen of the tunnel and the addition of a
BLT-1 compound is expected to impede the
transit of cholesterol. Furthermore, several of
these structures contain various compounds in
the tunnel, including PEG, phospholipids, and
cholesterol.
In addition to HCV, other human pathogens
have exploited this class of proteins as attachment or entry factors. In this review, we will
focus specifically on recent structures of
LIMP-2/SCARB2 complexed with the enterovirus 71 (EV71) virion (Zhou et al. 2019) and
CD36 bound to the malarial protein Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
(PfEMP1) (Fig. 4B; Hsieh et al. 2016). LIMP-2 is
a receptor or entry factor for several enteroviruses. EV71 infection causes hand, foot, and mouth
disease. A structure of the LIMP-2 ectodomain
bound to a pH-adapted EV71 mutant virus
(N104S of VP1) and in the presence of a pocket
factor inhibitor was determined by high-resolution cryo-EM. The viral capsid proteins, VP1
and VP2, engage with two α helices (α5 α7) at
the apex of LIMP-2 distal from the membrane
(>50 Å distance). This helical bundle undergoes
pH-dependent conformational changes, which
have been proposed to trigger release of the
RNA genome (Dang et al. 2014). The model
proposes that EV71 binds to LIMP-2 and is
shuttled to the endosomal. Endosomal acidification activates the LIMP-2 lipid transport tunnel, causes the removal of the lipid pocket factor,
and triggers capsid uncoating. PfEMP1 is an
adhesive protein expressed on the surface on
an infected red blood cell, which will adhere to
blood vesicles and tissues. PfEMP1 are large
proteins (>200 kDa) with the extracellular portion contain one to two copies of cysteine-rich
interdomain region (CIDR) domains. Interestingly, PfEMP1 binds CD36 in an overlapping
region as EV71 to CD36 (Fig. 4B). Unlike
LIMP-2, CD36 is not known to undergo pHdependent conformational changes as the critical pH-sensing histidine residue is not conserved. It is interesting to place these results
in the context of HCV infection mediated by

SR-BI. The amino-terminal portion of HCV E2
would engage the apical region of SR-BI and
activate the lipid transfer tunnel to transfer cholesterol from the lipoviral particle to the cell
stimulated by endosomal acidification. This
could trigger fusion between the virion and cell
membranes causing the release of the HCV genome into the cytoplasm.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
HCV is a unique virus. It does not meet the
expectations established by comparison with
its better-studied relatives in the flavivirus family and so, perhaps, HCV employs a novel mechanism of entry. E2 has been shown to bind to
host cell receptors, CD81 and SR-BI, and pH is

important as p7 regulates it during egress (Bentham et al. 2013); but how pH is sensed after
endocytosis remains unknown. Other flaviviruses have a lipid bilayer, entirely covered by
viral envelope protein, and use a type II fusion
protein to join the host and viral membranes.
HCV might lack a type II fusion protein because
it may lack a well-defined lipid bilayer. Because
the virus particle is coated in a variable layer of
lipid and apolipoproteins, the mechanics of fusion would have to be different from a bilayer,
although that mechanism remains unknown.
Whether HCV has a fusion protein at all should
also be considered. Comparisons between viruses have long been a fruitful means of hypothesis
generation, but this is predicated on the viruses
actually having enough in common to draw parallels. Considering the greater similarity of HCV
to lipoparticles than to flaviviruses, perhaps the
mechanisms of lipid homeostasis hold the key to
how HCV accomplishes infection. If we learn
what to look for, perhaps we will find more viruses like HCV, hiding in plain sight.
