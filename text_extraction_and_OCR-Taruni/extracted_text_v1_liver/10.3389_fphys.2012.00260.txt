Changing demographics make it ever more important to understand the modifiable risk factors for disability and loss of independence with advancing age. For more than two decades
there has been increasing interest in the role of sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle
or lean mass, in curtailing active and healthy aging. There is now evidence to suggest that
lack of strength, or dynapenia, is a more constant factor in compromised wellbeing in old
age and it is apparent that the decline in muscle mass and the decline in strength can take
quite different trajectories.This demands recognition of the concept of muscle quality; that
is the force generating per capacity per unit cross-sectional area (CSA). An understanding
of the impact of aging on skeletal muscle will require attention to both the changes in
muscle size and the changes in muscle quality. The aim of this review is to present current
knowledge of the decline in human muscle mass and strength with advancing age and
the associated risk to health and survival and to review the underlying changes in muscle
characteristics and the etiology of sarcopenia. Cross-sectional studies comparing young
(18–45 years) and old (>65 years) samples show dramatic variation based on the technique
used and population studied. The median of values of rate of loss reported across studies
is 0.47% per year in men and 0.37% per year in women. Longitudinal studies show that
in people aged 75 years, muscle mass is lost at a rate of 0.64–0.70% per year in women
and 0.80–00.98% per year in men. Strength is lost more rapidly. Longitudinal studies show
that at age 75 years, strength is lost at a rate of 3–4% per year in men and 2.5–3% per
year in women. Studies that assessed changes in mass and strength in the same sample
report a loss of strength 2–5 times faster than loss of mass. Loss of strength is a more
consistent risk for disability and death than is loss of muscle mass.

INTRODUCTION
We rely upon skeletal muscle for every interaction with our environment and every activity of daily life. The physical challenges
of rising from a chair, dressing and walking, bringing food to
the open mouth, chewing and swallowing, clearing respiratory
secretions, and managing personal hygiene are taken for granted
by most, but these are the very activities which, when compromised due to weakness, necessitate institutional care for a significant proportion of the population. Whilst in some cases a
specific cause of weakness such as a neurological disease may
be identifiable, an almost inevitable contributing factor will be
old age. With old age we see at best compromised physical
prowess (Moore, 1975; Meltzer, 1994; Ojanen et al., 2007) and
at worse a disabling loss in independence and mobility with
approximately a quarter of those over 90 years of age requiring long term residential, nursing, or hospital care in the UK
(Office of Fair Trading, 2005; Bajekal et al., 2006). Compromised muscle function has been identified as an independent
predictor of hospitalization, disability, and death (Newman et al.,
2006).
In this review we outline current understanding of the changes
that occur in human skeletal muscles with age.We describe changes
in size and changes in function and structure and then describe
etiologies and potential interventions.
QUANTITATIVE CHANGES IN MUSCLE
SIZE
Historic observations of the loss of muscle bulk seen in old age,
from Aristotle to Shakespeare, have been quoted in recent scholarly
works on the topic (Evans, 1995; Narici and Maffulli, 2010). In the
last half-century a range of elaborate techniques have confirmed
a reduction in size of muscle mass with age. This is especially evident in the comparison of those aged 20–30 years to those over
70 years.
Sarcopenia as a concept
This phenomenon was given the name “sarcopenia,” derived from
the Greek“sarcos”referring to flesh and“penia,”a lack of, byRosenberg (1989). The purpose of giving it a title was to strengthen the
concept of loss of skeletal muscle with old age, independent of

disease process, as an entity, and to stimulate scientific and clinical
interest in the area. The term is now in widespread use with thousands of peer-reviewed articles identifying it as a keyword. Whilst
originally it referred just to the loss of lean mass, it has also been
used to refer to the loss of both strength and size, as discussed
below (Morley et al., 2001; Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010).
It has been suggested that sarcopenia should be considered a
“geriatric syndrome” (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010). The term “geriatric syndrome” is used to capture those complex but common
clinical situations seen in old age, which do not fit into discrete
disease categories. Examples include delirium, falls, incontinence,
and frailty. Dysfunctions in multiple systems, often at distant sites,
contribute synergistically to these syndromes; the relative contributions can be difficult to establish (Inouye et al., 2007). The
argument put forward for recognizing sarcopenia as a geriatric
syndrome is to promote its identification and treatment even when
the exact cause remains unknown.
Definition and classification of sarcopenia
No definition of sarcopenia has received universal acceptance.
The term was initially used to describe the loss of lean mass
with “healthy” aging (Rosenberg, 1989). One widely used definition of sarcopenia proposed in 1998 by Richard Baumgartner
was based on a measure of relative muscle mass obtained by
dividing absolute muscle mass, evaluated by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA), by height squared. In a fashion analogous to the approach used to define underweight, overweight, and
obese from BMI, sarcopenia was defined as relative muscle mass
lower than two standard deviations below the mean of a large
sex-specific reference population aged 18–40 years (Baumgartner
et al., 1998). Another definition with a classification of severity,
proposed by Ian Janssen in 2002, was based on a skeletal muscle index (SMI) calculated by dividing total muscle mass by total
body mass. Muscle mass was evaluated by bioelectrical impedance
analysis (BIA). Subjects were considered to have normal SMI if
it was within one standard deviation of the sex-specific mean for
young adults. Class I sarcopenia was considered present when a
subject’s SMI was between one and two standard deviations below
the young adult values and class II sarcopenia was present in those
subjects more than two standard deviations below the young adult
reference (Janssen et al.,2002). This approach was considered comparable to the use of bone mineral density of a young reference
group in the classification of normal bone density, osteopenia, and
osteoporosis (Kanis, 1994).
Subsequently it has been suggested that the term sarcopenia
should also encompass weakness and loss of function (Morley
et al., 2001). Rosenberg himself, at a symposium in 1996, declared
that the term actually describes important changes in body composition and function. The United States National Institutes of
Health now recognize this broader definition (National Institutes
of Health, 2004). In 2010 the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People published a consensus document which
proposed a diagnosis of sarcopenia to require “low muscle mass”
accompanied by either “low muscle strength” or “low physical
performance.” This group suggested that stages of sarcopenia be
recognized; presarcopenia with loss of muscle mass; sarcopenia
when this is accompanied by either loss of strength or physical
performance; and severe sarcopenia when all three aspects are
present (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010).
Some reject this use because it implies a proportionality
between loss of muscle bulk and loss of strength which, as discussed below, is not the case as with aging the decline in strength
exceeds that of muscle size (Narici and Maffulli, 2010). The term
dynapenia has been proposed to refer to the functional compromise of the entire neuromuscular apparatus (Clark and Manini,
2008) and although there is good evidence that this concept is of
clinical significance (Clark and Manini, 2010) the term is yet to
achieve widespread usage. Some writers argue against the separation of dynapenia and sarcopenia due to the risk of nomenclature
introducing confusion (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010).
It has also been proposed that the term sarcopenia need not
be reserved for muscle loss with old age and that the phenomenon may be seen, albeit less frequently, in the young; as is the case
with dementia or osteoporosis. Similarly, sometimes the term is
used to encompass any kind of muscle loss even that caused by
a single identifiable disease (“secondary sarcopenia” as opposed
to “primary sarcopenia” in an otherwise well individual; CruzJentoft et al., 2010). Other writers reserve the use of sarcopenia for
its origin use, considering secondary sarcopenia to be an aspect
of cachexia (Thomas, 2007). A global consensus on the use of the
term sarcopenia has not yet been achieved.
Clinical impact of sarcopenia
Two decades ago when the concept of sarcopenia entered vogue
it was envisaged that loss of muscle mass was the major determinant of the decline in physical function with age and a modifiable
risk factor in disease and disability (Frontera et al., 1991; Evans,
1995). Sarcopenia, as described above by Baumgartner, was independently associated with use of a frame or walker, with falls, and,
in both sexes, with physical disability even when adjusted for age,
obesity, and comorbidities (Baumgartner et al., 1998). Janssen’s
definition of sarcopenia was also used to associate low muscle mass
with functional impairment and disability (Janssen et al., 2002).
In the ilSIRENTE study, individuals in the low tertile of mid-arm
muscle circumference, a simple anthropometric index of muscle
mass, had a significantly greater mortality than individuals in the
high tertile (Landi et al., 2005).
However other data do not support the strong association
between low fat free or muscle mass and disability and death.
Low fat free mass failed to demonstrate association with selfreported physical disability in both the Cardiovascular Health
Study (Visser et al., 1998b) and the Framingham Heart Study
(Visser et al., 1998a). The HABC Study has collected prospective body composition, strength, function, and health and survival data for more than 3000 older people over several years.
It failed to demonstrate increased compromise in lower limb
function in sarcopenic men when sarcopenia was defined as low
appendicular lean mass/height2(Delmonico et al., 2007). In this
study the incidence of mobility limitation does increase with
low muscle size (mid-thigh muscle cross-sectional area; CSA by
CT) and low muscle strength (maximal isokinetic knee extension
strength) but after muscle strength was taken into account, muscle
area did not remain a significant factor associated with incident
mobility limitations. This suggests muscle strength mediates any

relationship between muscle mass and mobility limitation (Visser
et al., 2005). Moreover, this study did not show upper or lower
limb muscle mass to be associated with mortality (Newman et al.,
2006).
Lean mass,measured by DXA, and thigh muscle CSA,measured
by CT, in 3011 adults aged 70–80 years failed to show association
with hospitalization rates in the subsequent 4.7 years (Cawthon
et al., 2009).
Epidemiology of sarcopenia
Using the definition described above; muscle mass measure by
DXA/height2less than an index of two standard deviations below
the mean of a sex matched young reference population; the
NMEHS study showed that in a New Mexico population c. 15%
of males and c. 24% of females aged 65–70 years were sarcopenic.
This rose to >50% in both sexes among the over 80s. Sarcopenia was generally more prevalent in Hispanics than non-Hispanic
whites (Baumgartner et al., 1998). When similarly measured in
a Caucasian New England population 53% of men and 31% of
women aged over 80 years were sarcopenic (Iannuzzi-Sucich et al.,
2002). A much lower prevalence of sarcopenia was seen amongst
Danish women with sarcopenia diagnosed in 12% of >70-year
olds (Tanko et al., 2002) and in Taiwan, with 26% of men and 19%
of women over 80 sarcopenic (Chien et al., 2008).
According to the definition of Janssen et al. (2002) described
above, in a study using a nationally representative cohort of
Americans, 50% of men and 72% of women over 80 years were
sarcopenic; with 7 and 11% suffering Class II sarcopenia.
Quantifying age-related changes in muscle mass
Numerous studies have aimed at quantifying the decrement in
skeletal muscle bulk, either volume or mass. Attempts have been
made to mathematically describe the decline in function of the
musculoskeletal system seen with advancing years as if decline is a
uniform process that starts at completion of growth (Sehl, 2001).
However there is little consensus on the rate of decline. Estimates
of loss of muscle mass by age 18–80 years range from 8 to 49%
(Novak, 1972; Tzankoff and Norris, 1977). Studies done over the
last five decades are summarized in Tables 1–3. Table 1 summarizes those studies that compare cohorts in or near peak muscle
bulk to those in their seventh, eighth, or ninth decades (Lexell
et al., 1983; Young et al., 1985). An approximation of percentage
loss per decade has been calculated for each study. The median
value reported across studies for the rate of loss in men is 4.7% of
peak mass per decade and in women it is 3.7% per decade. Table 2
summarizes those studies that specifically look at rate of loss after
the seventh decade (Baumgartner et al., 1995). In many studies
a failure to report actual age characteristics of groups prevents
calculation of loss per decade.
Some studies demonstrate an ever-accelerating wastage with
the rate of loss expressed as a factor of age2(Kehayias et al., 1997;
Janssen et al., 2000). Others describe a linear loss in later years following a plateau or muscle gaining phase (Gallagher et al., 1997;
Kyle et al., 2001; Silva et al., 2009). A large study with a robust technique for measuring summed four-limb (appendicular) skeletal
muscle mass (DXA, see below) has shown it to be almost static
from ages 18 to 60 years, with a slight gain of muscle throughout
this period in men and a slight loss in women (Kyle et al., 2001).
The age at which decline starts has been reported as 27 years (Silva
et al., 2009), 45 years (Janssen et al., 2000), and 60 years (Kyle et al.,
2001).
Several reasons contribute to the differences between studies.
Diverse techniques are employed to provide estimate skeletal muscle mass. Fat free mass or fat free cell mass have been used as
indices of muscle mass (Novak, 1972; Cohn et al., 1980; Borkan
et al., 1983). Total body potassium (TBK) and nitrogen (TBN)
estimations of fat free mass may overestimate losses as K+/gram
skeletal muscle itself, a measure assumed constant in these studies, has been shown to decrease with age (Kehayias et al., 1997).
Similarly, creatinine excretion per gram of muscle has been shown
to be lower in old men compared to young yet the assumption of
lifelong constant excretion rates has been used in the calculation
of muscle mass estimates in non-agenarians (Tzankoff and Norris,
1977). Non-invasive imaging techniques (computed tomography;
CT and magnetic resonance; MRI) are now regarded as the gold
standard in measurement of whole body and limb specific muscle
mass and these modalities estimate a loss of peak muscle mass of
around 20% even in those aged 70–88 years (Janssen et al., 2000).
In the last two decades DXA has been widely used in assessing
body composition including measurement of lean tissue mass. It
can provide an estimate of appendicular and total skeletal muscle
mass which correlates closely to that measured by CT but at a much
lower cost and exposure to a fraction of the ionizing radiation
(Wang et al., 1996).
All cross-sectional studies make the assumptions that a contemporary young sample of the population is a fair proxy for their
aged sample at a time in the past. Such studies are influenced
by secular changes, i.e., intergenerational differences representing
changes in the population characteristics rather than age-related
changes that would be evident within a cohort over time.
It could be argued that some cross-sectional studies are particularly vulnerable to differences in selection criteria between young
and old. For example studies looking at cadavers of those who
died as a result of trauma assume that amount of muscle mass
per se does not influence the probability of a traumatic death. If,
indeed, larger muscle mass in young men was a risk factorfor traumatic death (for example, due to association with manual laboring
employment) whilst larger muscle mass reduced the chance of
traumatic death in old age (for example, protective against falls),
then a selection bias would contribute to the marked loss seen in
such studies (Lexell et al., 1988).
Whilst all cross-sectional studies are at risk of these systematic influences, large studies with robust techniques will provide a
good measure of variability between individuals in each age group
as well as giving an estimate of changes with age. Figure 1 demonstrates the subtlety of the downward trend in muscle mass with
aging when it is seen in the context of the high degree of variability between individuals. This concept has not previously been
highlighted in reviews of the subject.
Age-related changes are not uniform across the body
The rate of loss is not uniform across muscles. In an MRI-based
study of 200 women and 268 men, the rate of loss of lower
limb muscle was more than twice the rate of loss of upper limb

CT (Borkan et al., 1983) and DXA (Gallagher et al., 1997) based
measurements.
Sex, race, and menopausal status may impact on age-related
changes in muscle mass
At any given age males possess more muscle bulk than females,
even after correction for height and weight. Men exhibit larger agerelated decreases in muscle mass compared to women (Gallagher
et al., 1997). However this difference all but disappears when loss
is expressed as a proportion of peak muscle mass (Janssen et al.,
2000; Silva et al., 2009).
It has been proposed that menopausal status has a significant
impact upon the maintenance of muscle mass and that transition
into the menopause has been associated with a reduction in muscle
mass (Sirola and Kroger, 2011). However the evidence to support
this claim has been equivocal. The first study proposing an accelerated loss of muscle at menopause used TBK to measure cell mass
and demonstrated a negligible rate of loss in pre-menopause and a
significant inverse correlation with age amongst post-menopausal
women (Aloia et al., 1991). Another study used both the TBK
technique and also DXA to measure appendicular muscle mass in
both men and women and the data displayed very similar trends
in both sexes, with different regression models being requires to
describe the relationship between muscle mass and age before and
after age 60 years (Kyle et al., 2001). Thus it may be argued that the
increased loss of muscle seen after menopause is more age-related
than menopause related. This is supported by another study that
Frontiers in Physiology | Striated Muscle Physiology July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 260 | 6

Mitchell et al. Sarcopenia, dynapenia and aging muscle
shows leg lean mass to be inversely correlated with age but not
menopausal status (Douchi et al., 2002).
Although men loose more muscle with aging, in absolute and
relative terms, it seems that women suffer more from the consequences of lean tissue mass (Janssen et al., 2002), perhaps due to
their lower starting mass and their greater longevity.
Studies have attempted to quantify separately the age-related
changes in muscle bulk in different ethnic groups living in the
same area. African American men and women have been shown to
have higher peak muscle mass than Whites but experience greater
absolute and relative age-related losses (Gallagher et al., 1997; Silva
et al., 2009).
The rate of loss in high-level recreational athletes, who continue to train 4–5 times a week, was similar to subjects not selected
according to athletic activity, albeit happening against a different
baseline (Frontera et al., 1991; Wroblewski et al., 2011).
Limitations of cross-sectional observation
These cross-sectional studies provide a measure of muscle mass
across ages at a moment in time. They cannot support the assumption that individuals follow trajectories of change calculated from
arithmetic lines of best fit. Longitudinal studies, with all the associated difficulties in logistical aspects of execution, are the only
way to assess trends in individuals.
Table 3 summarizes the few longitudinal studies that assess
estimates of muscle mass over time. Given the huge size of the overlapping sample considered by both Koster et al.(2011),Delmonico
et al. (2009) who used data from the health, aging and body composition (HABC) study, it should be recognized that their findings;
an annual loss of 0.8–0.98 and 0.64–0.7% of leg lean mass per year
throughout the eight decade, in men and women, respectively; are
the most reliable to date for a population of initially well functioning community dwelling men and women. There is marked
discrepancy with the results of the previous largest longitudinal
study of Hughes et al. (2002), who considered total lean mass
measured by underwater weighing and reported an annual loss
of 0.2% in men and approximate stability in women throughout the seventh decade. Contributing to this discrepancy may be
the older age of the HABC subjects; the method of recruitment,
with HABC subjects being randomly selected Medicare beneficiaries whilst Hughes followed up patients responding to newspaper
advertisements; and the asymmetrical loss with lower limb muscle
atrophy exceeding upper limb. However these studies consistently
report losses of less than 1% per year. Despite this a figure of 1–2%
loss per year over 50 is widely quoted and misattributed to Hughes
et al. (Thomas, 2007; Rolland et al., 2008; Peake et al., 2010; Sirola
and Kroger, 2011).
Age-related loss of muscle is only a part of age-related change in
body composition
Against a period of almost-constant muscle mass lasting up to
four decades, most individuals gain total body weight due to an
increase in fat mass (Kyle et al., 2001). Thus a reduction in relative
muscle mass, expressed as a fraction of body weight, can be seen
to drop from the third decade of life (Janssen et al., 2000). Most
people continue to gain fat mass in the eighth decade when muscle
mass is decreasing (Goodpaster et al., 2006).
Muscle mass does decrease with advancing age. On average, in
every age group, men carry more muscle mass than women. Men
loose more muscle both in absolute terms and a proportion of
total. Historical methods of estimating changes in muscle mass
have tended to overestimate loss. Throughout much of adult life,
muscle mass remains fairly constant. Average rates of loss in those
aged over 70 years are in the region of 0.5–1% per year. Most individuals aged over 70 years will possess about 80% of the muscle
mass of those aged 20–30 years. There is great variability between
individuals at any given age. Sarcopenia is a term that is widely
used to describe the phenomenon of muscle loss with old age.
There is still much debate surrounding its exact definition. The
prevalence of sarcopenia varies with geography, ethnicity, and definition. It may affect half of octogenarians. Some studies show low
muscle mass to be a risk factor for disability and death. The health
impact of low muscle mass is not as consistent at the impact of
low strength.
FUNCTION
Most skeletal muscles act through tendons to move joints against
resistance. The force developed depends upon the number of sarcomeres acting in parallel and the force per sarcomere as well the
mechanical advantage at which the muscle works. The maximum
force that can be applied against an immovable object is the isometric strength. Isokinetic strength describes the peak torque that can
be developed against a load that moves through an arc at a fixed
angular velocity. Power describes the rate of energy transfer and
is therefore the product of velocity and force of contraction. The
velocity of shortening will depend upon the number of sarcomeres
in series as well as the speed of shortening of each sarcomere. Concentric contractions occur within a shortening muscle that acts
against a load which it overcomes; eccentric contractions occur
when the muscle is actively lengthened by external forces. Thus
intrinsic stiffness of a muscle will hinder force generation during
concentric contractions but contribute to force generation during
eccentric contractions. Fatigability describes the exercise-induced
reduction in the ability to exert muscle force or power. As most
muscles act across joints via tendons, changes in other connective tissue elements will indirectly affect the muscle’s mechanical
behavior (its length–force relation) and impact upon physical performance as will sensorimotor and cognitive processes such as
balance, attention, and motivation (Narici and Maganaris, 2007).
For these reasons assessing,interpreting, and describing changes in
muscle function with age is much more challenging than changes
in size of muscle mass, which can be expressed relatively easily as
an absolute or relative change in mass or as a simple index thereof,
such as muscle mass/height2 or % body mass.
Hand grip strength and upper limb isometric strength
The use of simple hand grip strength near-isometric dynamometers has been established for more than seven decades (Fischer and
Birren, 1946). These permitted an early quantification of changing
muscle function with age and also raised awareness of the tendency
for cross-sectional studies to underestimate each individual’s rate
of decline because of relatively fewer weak individuals surviving to
be represented in the older samples (Clement, 1974). The NORA
cohort of initially healthy, independent Scandinavian 75-year-old
www.frontiersin.org July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 260 | 7

Mitchell et al. Sarcopenia, dynapenia and aging muscle
men and women showed a drop in grip strength in 5 years of 20
and 15%, respectively. This was contrasted to a loss of fat free mass
as measured by BIA of 3.6 and 2.1% (Dey et al., 2009) suggesting
a dissociation between loss of muscle size and strength.
Hand grip dynamometers can be portable and inexpensive
and therefore can easily be introduced into clinical practice. Low
hand grip strength predicts disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Among a sample of circa 2500 independent living Mexican
Americans over 65 years followed up for 7 years, incident disability
was more common in the lowest quartile compared to the highest
hand grip strength quartile even after adjustment for confounding
factors (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.14–3.17 in men and 2.28, 95% CI 1.59–
3.27 in women; Al Snih et al., 2004). The Leiden 85-plus Study
looked at Dutch individuals over 85 years and showed low handgrip strength to be a predictor of accelerated decline in activities
of daily living (ADL)-ability and cognition (Taekema et al., 2010).
Hospitalization was more common in those aged 70–80 years and
in the lowest quartile of hand grip strength compared to the highest (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.3–1.78; Cawthon et al., 2009). Among 463
Finnish people aged 75–84 years participating in the EVERGREEN
project, the risk of death within 4 years was higher in those with
grip strength below the sample mean (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.13–
3.07; Laukkanen et al., 1995). Progressive increases in mortality
amongst men aged >60 years have been observed between quartiles when ranked by hand grip, an effect that remained significant
even after adjustment for total muscle mass as calculated by 24 h
creatinine excretion (Metter et al., 2002). The HABC Study showed
mortality to be associated with hand grip strength and this effect
remained significant even after adjustment for arm lean tissue
mass as measured by DXA (Newman et al., 2006). The Leiden
85-plus Study showed the increased mortality associated with low
hand grip strength persists as far as the end of the ninth decade
(Ling et al., 2010). These findings suggest that measurement of
hand grip strength may have a role in clinical assessment and risk
stratification in the elderly.
Knee extensor strength and lower limb isokinetic strength
Assessment of knee extensor isokinetic strength, or peak torque at
a fixed angular velocity, allows a dynamic measure of lower limb
function. Lower limb strength is lost more rapidly than upper limb
strength (Frontera et al., 2000), in line with the loss of lean mass
described above. However the loss in strength greatly exceeds the
loss of muscle mass. Among 1678 older people followed for 5 years,
men lost c. 16% of knee extensor strength but only 5% of thigh
muscle mass whilst women lost 13% of strength but only 3% of
mass. In those patients with stable body weight or who lost weight,
the loss of strength exceeded the loss of muscle mass two- to fivefold. Individuals who gained body weight still lost strength despite
an increase in muscle mass. Loss of muscle mass only accounted
for a small fraction of the between subject variability in the loss
of knee extensor strength (6 and 8% in men and women, respectively). This reinforces the notion of a clear dissociation between
loss of muscle and loss of strength (Hughes et al., 2002; Delmonico
et al., 2009).
Patients with low knee extension strength are at increased risk
of disability and death. The HABC Study shows an increase in
incident disability in the lowest compared to highest quartile by
quadriceps strength (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.39–2.94; Visser et al.,
2005). The same study shows increased mortality by quadriceps
strength per standard deviation of 48 Nm, with a crude hazard
ration of 1.51 (95% CI 1.28–1.79) in men and 1.65 (95% CI 1.19–
2.3) in women (Newman et al., 2006). The EVERGREEN project
showed the risk of death within 4 years was higher in those with
knee extension strength below the sample mean (OR = 2.52, 95%
CI 1.50–4.42), a higher mortality risk than that associated with low
hand grip strength in the same sample (Laukkanen et al., 1995).
The preservation of eccentric strength with aging
The evidence presented above shows compromise in strength of
isometric contractions, when the muscle is held at a fixed fiber
length during activity and in dynamic, concentric contractions
when the muscle shortens during the generation of force. When
peak torque is measure in eccentric contractions there is a relative preservation of strength in old age and other chronic disease
states associated with muscle loss and weakness (Porter et al., 1997;
Phillips et al., 1998; Klass et al., 2005). It has been proposed that
the accumulation of non-contractile material within the muscle
increasing passive stiffness and changes in the contractile properties of muscle fibers resulting in “active stiffness” both contribute
to this phenomenon (Roig et al., 2010).
Loss of peak torque depends upon angular velocity
During concentric contractions the peak torque developed
depends upon the angular velocity of the load. The loss of peak
torque with aging is greater at higher angular velocities (Yu et al.,
2007). In young men, the ratio of elbow flexion peak torque developed at 240 versus 60 s−1
is about 0.9. In elderly men this has been
shown to drop to c. 0.5 (Pousson et al., 2001).
Loss of power
Power describes a muscle’s ability to do work and is thus the rate
of transfer energy. It is equal to the product of the force developed
and the velocity of contraction. Power is lost faster than strength
(Skelton et al., 1994; Izquierdo et al., 1999). Measuring and comparing power is much more difficult than measuring strength. The
reasons for this are discussed in a review of the topic (Macaluso
and De Vito, 2004).
Fatigability
Anecdotal evidence may suggest fatigue constitutes an element of
normal aging. However the observation of increased rapidity of
tiring upon repeated performance of the same task reflects the
age-related decrease in strength, outlined above, more than fatigability of muscles. As maximum strength decreases, and body mass
increases or stays relatively constant, the fraction of maximum
force needed to perform the same physical task, e.g., stair-climb
or rise from chair, will increase. Fatigue occurs more rapidly
with increasing task intensity and the maximum endurance time
decreases in an non-linearly fashion as task intensity increase (Frey
Law and Avin, 2010).
However the physiological phenomenon of muscle fatigue,
which has been defined as “an exercise-induced reduction in
the ability to exert muscle force or power” (Bigland-Ritchie and
Woods, 1984) would require that comparisons between age groups
Frontiers in Physiology | Striated Muscle Physiology July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 260 | 8

Mitchell et al. Sarcopenia, dynapenia and aging muscle
be based upon performance at a constant task intensity (% of
maximal force). A recent meta-analysis included data from 46
publications which reported fatigue tasks (voluntary activation)
performed at relative intensity in both young (18–45 years) and
old (>55 years). This work demonstrated significant fatigue resistance in the aged. Subgroup analysis by task showed significant
fatigue resistance when tasks involved sustained or intermittent
isometric tasks but this effect was lost when tasks were dynamic
(Avin and Law, 2011). This is in keeping with studies that have
showed an accelerated loss in Type II fibers (Larsson and Karlsson,
1978; Lexell et al., 1988).
Individual fiber observations
The in vivo human observations described above will reflect not
only factors intrinsic to muscle fibers but will also be influenced
by differences in intramuscular fiber orientation, differences in the
mechanical leverage provided by the bony anatomy of joints, the
elasticity of tendons, the pattern of motor unit recruitment, and
the activation of antagonist muscles. Even multicellular muscle
preparations, independent of these variables, will depend upon
interpreting the contribution of different fiber types. The study of
chemically skinned, single fibers allows the examination of myofilament behavior in a near physiological environment yet without
the confounding effects of intercellular connective tissue.
It has thus been demonstrated that with aging, the maximum
shortening velocity of type I and IIA fibers decreases by c. 20–46
and 10–30%, respectively, and these changes are seen in both males
and females (Larsson et al., 1997; Yu et al., 2007). The small numbers of mixed type and type IIx fibers and the variability between
fibers make assessment of these types difficult but a trend toward
slowing is seen in all fiber types (D’Antona et al., 2003).
Consistent with a decrease in maximum shortening velocity of
each fiber type is a decrease in the actin sliding velocity on purified myosin isoforms prepared from aged muscle determined by
in vitro motility assays (Hook et al., 2001; D’Antona et al., 2003).
The specific tension, or force per unit CSA, has also been shown
to decrease with age in both sexes; by c. 16–33% in type I, 14–25%
in type IIA, and possibly up to 50% in type IIx (Larsson et al.,
1997; D’Antona et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2007).
Within fibers, myosin concentration falls with age. Within each
fiber type, the specific tension generated is almost proportional
to the myosin concentration observed suggesting that the loss of
specific tension is the result of dropping myosin concentrations
(D’Antona et al., 2003).
Strength decreases with advancing age. Average rates of loss
are 2–4% per year. This is 2–5 times faster than muscle mass is
lost. Low strength, both assessed by hand grip and knee extension, predicts disability and death. Factors other than loss of mass
account for much of the observed loss of strength. Age compromises the ability to generate torque more at high than low
angular velocities. Power is lost more quickly than strength. Relative preservation of eccentric strength and fatigue resistance and
is a feature of aged muscles. These phenomena are seen at a single
fiber level. Underlying the observed loss of whole muscle function
is a slowing of actin-myosin interaction and a reduction in myosin
concentration.
QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN MUSCLE WITH ADVANCING AGE
Human skeletal muscle consists of fibers or myofibers, individual
multinucleated terminally differentiated cells, usually 20–80µm
in diameter and up to many centimeters long. Fibers are sheathed
in insulating endomesium. Nuclei are fixed in a non-random
distribution throughout within each fiber, each nucleus regulating protein synthesis within a volume of cytoplasm, its myonuclear domain (MND). Muscle fibers may contain many thousand
nuclei; for example in human vastus lateralis each fiber contains about 100 nuclei per millimeter length (Cristea et al., 2010).
Arranged along the surface of each muscle fiber are satellite cells
which function as a stem cell population; satellite cell mitosis can
replenish myonuclear number and producing new satellite cells
throughout life.
Running along the length of each fiber are myofibrils; the ultastructural elements responsible for force generation. Each myofibril
is composed chiefly of interdigitating actin and myosin myofilaments. In a fiber from a large muscle like gastrocnemius, there
may be 1000 myofibrils each composed of c. 1500 myosin and
3000 actin myofilament.
The alignment of interdigitating actin and myosin gives skeletal muscle its striated appearance on microscopy. A sarcomere
describes an individual repeated unit of the myofilament and in
humans it is about 2µm long and so 5000 sarcomeres lie in series
along each centimeter of muscle fiber. Groups of a few to a few
hundred fibers are arranged into fascicles, each just visible to the
naked eye and bound together with a connective tissue sheath, the
perimesium.
The length of each fascicle will determine the number of sarcomeres in series and therefore the maximum velocity with which
it contracts. The CSA of fibers will dictate the number of sarcomeres contracting in parallel and therefore the maximum force
generated. Most muscles involved in locomotion are pennate; that
is to say the long axis of each fascicle lies at an angle to the axis of
traction. Pennation allows more fibers to act in parallel and with
hypertrophy, the angle of pennation increases. Thus a physiological CSA of a muscle, perpendicular to the long axis of the fibers,
can greatly exceed its anatomical CSA. The volume of a muscle will be the product of its physiological CSA and the fascicle
length.
Alpha-motoneurons are the large lower motor neurons that
form synapses on muscle fibers. Their cell bodies lie in the ventral
horn of spinal gray matter. Each innervates a variable number of
muscle fibers which, together with the nerve, constitute a motor
unit. Average motor unit size ranges from less than three fibers
in the case of the extraocular muscles, c. 180 in the case of soleus
to >2000 fibers in the gastrocnemius. The total number of motor
units making up some human muscles has also been quantified.
This is highly variable between people. In one young sample the
range in the number of motor units making up biceps brachi was
58–190 and in the median innervated thenar muscles was 102–
421. As described below this changes with age. Due to the security
of transmission at the neuromuscular junction between nerve and
muscle it is normal for all muscle fibers in a motor unit to fire
together making the motor unit the smallest increment of muscle
recruitment.

Mitchell et al. Sarcopenia, dynapenia and aging muscle
Muscle fibers can be classified according to their predominant
myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform expression. Type I fibers
express MyHC I and demonstrate slow contractile velocity with
numerous mitochondria and plentiful myoglobin and hence significant oxidative capacity. Type II fibers are subdivided type IIA
and IIx (previously called IIB). Fibers expressing MyHC IIA are
packed with more contractile elements each of which contracts
faster and generates more force than type I but have fewer mitochondria, less myoglobin, and so less oxidative capacity and therefore less capacity for sustained force generation. Fibers expressing
MyHC IIx contract more vigorously than type IIA fibers but with
even lower aerobic capacity and are therefore more reliant upon
glycolytic metabolism. Each motor unit is composed of fibers of
the same type. Type I motor units consist of fewer fibers than Type
IIx. Myosin isoform expression is dynamic and can change with
training, immobility, or disease (Goldspink, 1985; Guyton, 1991;
Purves et al., 2001;Narici et al., 2003;Davies Re and Gergely, 2012).
CHANGES IN MUSCLE ARCHITECTURE
The architecture of muscle describes the three-dimensional
arrangement of its component fibers and is a major determinant of
its force and excursion capability (Lieber and Friden, 2001). Muscle architecture is dynamic and changes with hypertrophy. Specific
age-related change have also been described using ultrasound to
measure fascicle length and pennation angle. For example, in the
pennate plantar flexor gastrocnemius medialis, it has been shown
that the decreases in volume comparing old to young men, measured at 24–31% by CT and MRI, were due not just to fewer,
thinner fibers but also in part due to shorter fibers; fascicle length
dropped by 10–20% (Narici et al., 2003; Thom et al., 2007). This
will contribute to an age-related loss of shortening velocity as well
as force generation. It also means physiological CSA will not drop
as dramatically as anatomical CSA and actually suggests that the
loss of specific torque in pinnate muscles, e.g., plantar flexors and
knee extensors, is greater than that calculated using anatomical
CSA as the divisor.
The decrease in fascicle length, and hence in number of sarcomeres in series, will reduce maximum shortening velocity. However,
the observed impact on shortening velocity with aging exceeds
that which could be explained by decreasing fascicle length. In one
study a 38% decrease in calculated maximum shortening velocity
of human gastrocnemius was reduced to a 16% decrease when
adjusted for fascicle length, suggesting further age-related factors
intrinsic to muscle play a role (Thom et al., 2007)
CHANGES IN FIBER MORPHOLOGY
Light microscopic investigation of whole-muscle slices of male
human cadaveric vastus lateralis showed that the decrease in CSA
with age was in part due to a loss in number of fibers; a 50% reduction in fiber numbers was seen between mean age 19 and 82 years
in this sample which did show a greater than normal loss of muscle bulk. No particular fiber type was lost preferentially. However
whilst type I fiber size remained constant with age, there was a
significant decrease in type II fiber diameter. With advanced age
there was also an accumulation of abnormal fibers; they tended
to be small and angular and were found individually or in groups
of similar such fibers. There were also some large hypertrophic
fibers (Lexell et al., 1983, 1988). As described below these shrunken
angular fibers are characteristic of denervated fibers.
There is further evidence supporting a selective decrease in size
of type II fibers (Larsson, 1978; Coggan et al., 1992; Larsson et al.,
1997; Cristea et al., 2010) though some also suggest a decrease in
diameter of type I fibers (D’Antona et al., 2003). Another histological study suggested that whilst type II fiber size reduce by c.
57%, type I fibers shrunk by 25% between the third and ninth
decades (Andersen, 2003). There is evidence that there may be
sexual dimorphism in this phenomenon; it has been observed that
type I fiber size remained constant with aging in both sexes with a
significant decrease in type II fiber size observed only in males (Yu
et al., 2007). Some small biopsy-based studies suggest a preferential loss of type II fibers and subsequent increase in proportion of
type I but these should be interpreted with caution given the lack
of fiber type homogeneity across muscle seen in old age (Larsson
et al., 1997). Discrepancies between studies observing the impact
of age on fiber size and type are discussed below.
CHANGES IN MYONUCLEI AND SATELLITE CELLS
A widely accepted paradigm in understanding myonuclear function proposes the constancy of the MND; with hypertrophy new
myonuclei arise from satellite cell turnover and with hypoplasia
myonuclei apoptose (Hall and Ralston, 1989). This has been called
into question by observations of increased density of nuclei and
hence reduced MND in disuse atrophy (Gundersen and Bruusgaard, 2008) and old age (Kadi et al., 2004) which has lead to the
suggestion of decreased nuclear efficiency with age. However the
most recent developments in assessing the spatial arrangement of
myonuclei have demonstrated little or no change in average MND
size with aging. Instead there is an apparent increase in the variability of size of MND and a clustering of myonuclei within grooves on
the periphery of the fiber which may itself have implications in the
efficiency of the myonuclear control of muscle protein synthesis
(MPS; Cristea et al., 2010).
The number of satellite cells per muscle fiber has been shown to
decrease by 24% in women and 37% in men when those aged 20–
32 years were compared to those 70–83 years. Due to the increase in
myonuclear density in this study there was an even larger decrease
in the ratio of satellite cells to myonuclei. It is proposed this may
lead to a loss of regenerative function (Kadi et al., 2004).
CHANGES IN FIBER BIOCHEMISTRY
In young humans most muscle fibers express a single MyHC isoform though different isoforms do coexist in some fibers,with type
I/IIA and IIA/IIx being recognized and having contractile properties intermediate between classical fiber types (Larsson et al.,
1997). In aged muscle there is a greater tendency for fibers to
express a mixed pattern of MyHC isoforms. Within aged vastus
lateralis, 20–28% of fibers were seen to express both type I and
type IIA and 22–33% expressed both type IIA and type IIx. Some
individual fibers expressing all three isoforms have been identified
in biopsies of aged biceps brachii and vastus lateralis, a phenomenon not seen in young muscle (Klitgaard et al., 1990; Andersen,
2003). Other unusual hybrids seen in old age include type I/IIx
and expression of neonatal myosin was unexpectedly observed
(D’Antona et al., 2003).
Frontiers in Physiology | Striated Muscle Physiology July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 260 | 10

Mitchell et al. Sarcopenia, dynapenia and aging muscle
A shift toward slow myosin isoform expression is seen in some
studies (Gelfi et al., 2006) but not others (Marx et al., 2002;
D’Antona et al., 2003). Some of the discrepancy between studies exploring the impact of age on fiber type and myosin isoform
expression has been explained by D’Antona et al. They demonstrated dramatically different biochemical and morphological features when comparing muscle from elderly and elderly immobile
patients. Immobility accelerated the observed reduction in fiber
CSA, in myosin concentration and in specific tension. However,
the elderly immobile had a shift toward fast isoform expression. MyHC 2X became the most plentiful isoform and fibers
co-expressing IIA/X outnumbered those expressing type I. Accompanying this was the paradoxical increase in maximum shortening
velocity of isolated skinned fibers from the old immobile even
when compared to young controls. These data are consistent with
observations made in “unloaded” muscle, e.g., during spaceflight
or limb immobilization, of muscle wasting accompanied by a
shift toward a fast twitch phenotype. Thus it is proposed that the
actual expression pattern of myosin isoforms in the elderly is complex because it depends upon conflicting influences of aging and
reduced activity tending to shift toward slow and fast isoforms,
respectively (D’Antona et al., 2003).
Muscle architecture changes with age. Fibers become shorter as
well as thinner and few in number. There is an accumulation of
abnormal shrunken angular fibers both individually and in groups
and there is clustering of fiber types. These changes suggest denervation and incomplete reinnervation. Type II fibers are more
vulnerable to hypoplasia than type I. Fiber classification by MyHC
isoform becomes less relevant as fiber increasingly expressed mixed
characteristics. Aging and activity levels influence the pattern of
MyHC isoform expression. Whist the average MND size changes
little with age, its variability increases with age due to clustering of
myonuclei.
UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF SARCOPENIA
GENETIC DETERMINANTS OF SACROPENIA
Sarcopenia is determined by peak muscle mass and the subsequent
rate of loss. The degree to which human skeletal muscle phenotypes are heritable has been widely explored. In young people,
muscle size and strength are strongly heritable characteristics with
h
2 of c. 90% in males in their 20s (Huygens et al., 2004) and in
girls and boys aged 10–14 years (Loos et al., 1997). In older people a
much smaller proportion of variance in muscle mass and strength
is attributable to genetics, with h
2
for leg lean mass as low as 5%
and hand grip strength 22%. Environmental factors explain most
of the variability (Carmelli and Reed, 2000; Prior et al., 2007). It
has been shown in a longitudinal study of male twins, baseline
age 63 years, that the proportion of variance in hand grip strength
due to genetics decreases from 35 to 22% over a 10 year period
(Carmelli and Reed, 2000).
It is therefore unsurprising that the study the molecular genetic
basis of sarcopenia remains an area of active research with results
of studies identifying “sarcopenia genes” being at best tentative
and occasionally inconsistent. The subject has recently been comprehensively reviewed (Garatachea and Lucia, 2011; Tan et al.,
2012), with only five genes being identified as having contributed
to variation in skeletal muscle mass or strength, in two or more
studies. These are angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 1 (ACE),
alpha actinin 3 (ACTN3),myostatin (MSTN), ciliary neurotrophic
factor (CNTF), and vitamin D receptor (VDR). Linkage and
association findings suggest insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),
androgen receptor (AR), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) genes may also
contribute to variation in muscle phenotypes.
It cannot be assumed that these genes will subsequently be
shown to play a direct role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia.
MSTN attracted early attention as a sarcopenia gene. It’s product
MSTN was suggested to contribute to sarcopenia after it was shown
that MSTN deficient mice did not experience the same age-related
muscle atrophy as wild-type controls (Siriett et al., 2006). AntiMSTN antibodies could even increase muscle mass and strength
in an adult mouse model (Whittemore et al.,2003). Further,MSTN
mRNA and protein expression levels appeared to increase in older
men (Leger et al., 2008). However the hypothesis that increasing
MSTN expression significantly contributes to sarcopenia has subsequently been refuted by a larger study comparing young and frail
old men that showed no association between serum MSTN levels
and knee extensor strength (r
2 = 0.0001, p = 0.97) or quadriceps
CSA (r
2 = 0.0121, p = 0.48; Ratkevicius et al., 2011).
No single “unfavorable” genotype, associated with accelerated
sarcopenia, is yet supported by solid data (Garatachea and Lucia,
2011). The strongest candidate to date is a Lys(K)153Arg(R) polymorphism in exon 2 of the MSTN gene. Studying large groups
with this polymorphism has been difficult as the frequency of
the mutant R allele is <5% in Caucasians and <20% in Africans.
However there is evidence that the KR and RR phenotypes confer weakness on aged women (Seibert et al., 2001; Gonzalez-Freire
et al., 2010).
ALTERATIONS IN PROTEIN SYNTHESIS
Protein balance
Muscles exist in a dynamic equilibrium with constant MPS and
breakdown (MPB). To achieve proteostasis the two are closely
matched, though diurnal fluctuations reflect normal intermittent
feeding. In the fasted state and at rest, about 0.05% of the myofibrilar mass of leg muscles is synthesized each hour and this rate has
not been shown to differ between young and old men. However
in young men this rate more than doubles upon either feeding or
exercise but in old men these responses are blunted (Cuthbertson
et al., 2005; Kumar et al., 2009). As the age-related loss of muscle mass must reflect a period when average MPB exceeds MPS,
a blunting of the anabolic response to these stimuli may be an
important contributor to sarcopenia.
Further, MPB is inhibited in the postprandial period, mainly
due to the availability of insulin. The ability of insulin to suppress
leg muscle proteolysis has been shown to be diminished in older
people. Thus there may a compromise in both the downregulation of MPB and the upregulation in MPS in response to feeding
(Wilkes et al., 2009).
Changes to the proteome
Whilst loss of muscle mass requires protein breakdown to exceed
synthesis, a loss of muscle quality of specific tension suggests
a change in the profile of protein synthesis, i.e., the proteome.
This has been explored using two-dimensional difference gel

electrophoresis as a quantitative differential analysis of protein
expression to comparing young and aged human skeletal muscle. Numerous proteins show differential expression dependent
upon age. Most are either components of the contractile system
or enzymes involved in cellular metabolism (Gelfi et al., 2006).
Myosin heavy chain isoform expression changed dramatically
with age. With aging there was an increase in the proportion of
MyHC 1 from 48 to 68%; a decrease in the proportion of MyHC
2A from 39 to 31% and a near total loss of MyHC 2X, from 13 to
1%. Myosin light chain (MLC) expression patterns were also different, with a shift away from expression of a fast isoform Q14843
toward P10916, associated with slower twitch velocity. MLC phosphorylation was also lower in the elderly. In vitro studies suggest MLC phosphorylation increases calcium sensitivity (Sweeney
et al.,1993). Further, troponin T and tropomyosis α-chain isoform,
both known to confer calcium sensitivity, are downregulated with
advancing age. Reduced calcium sensitivity and reduced calcium
release due to dihydropyridine-ryanodine receptor uncoupling
will result in excitation-contraction uncoupling (Delbono et al.,
1995).
Most of those enzymes that are downregulated with aging participate in anaerobic metabolism. These include creatine kinase as
well as several enzymes of the glycolysis pathway including glycogen phosphorylase, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
triosephosphate isomerizes, and δ-enolase. Conversely several
enzymes with roles in aerobic metabolism were upregulated in the
elderly. These included ATP synthase δ-chain, dihydrolipoamide
dehydrogenase, three isoforms of aconitase,malate dehydrogenase,
and ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase complex.
Together these proteomic observations back the in vivo observation of older muscles loosing strength and slowing in contraction velocity and are also consistent with the observed decreases
in fatigability. The observation of decreased MyHC IIA and IIx
expression has been described in some (Larsson et al., 1997) but
not all studies (Marx et al., 2002; D’Antona et al., 2003) is discussed
above.
CHANGES IN THE HORMONE AND CYTOKINE MILIEU
There are marked endocrine changes associated with advancing
age (Lamberts et al., 1997). At menopause, there is an abrupt
decrease in ovarian estrogen production. As described above, there
is little evidence that this has a dramatic effect upon maintenance
of muscle mass or strength.
A much more gradual but nonetheless significant decrease in
testosterone and adrenal androgens is seen in males; this has been
referred to as the andropause. Given the potent anabolic effects
of testosterone (Urban et al., 1995), its decreased production may
contribute to sarcopenia in males who do loose muscle mass and
strength faster than women as described above. Bioavailable testosterone levels have been shown to positively correlate with peak
knee extensor strength in older males (Haren et al., 2008).
Dehydoepiandrosterone (DHEA) is the most plentiful circulating steroid hormones and its levels also decrease with advancing
age (Ganong, 2005). Most is of adrenal origin; as DHEA itself is
weakly androgenic and its metabolites include active androgens,
there has been much interest in the potential significance of its
decline in later years and the role of therapeutic administration
(Casson et al., 1998; Flynn et al., 1999; Percheron et al., 2003). As
yet there is little evidence to supporting the hypothesis that DHEA
decreases directly contribute to sarcopenia.
Activity in the pituitary growth hormone (GH)/hepatic IGF1 axis also diminishes with age and this has been termed the
somatopause (Lamberts et al., 1997). The ability of subcutaneous
GH administration to increase lean mass and reduce fat mass in
older men suggests that its decrease with aging may contribute
to sarcopenia and the body composition changes seen in old age
(Rudman et al., 1990).
High parathyroid hormone levels (≥4 pmol/L) approximately
double the risk of sarcopenia (Visser et al., 2003).
Chronic inflammation and subsequent cytokine production
has received attention as a potential contributor to sarcopenia. There is an age-related increase in circulating levels of the
mildly catabolic IL-6 (Roubenoff et al., 1998; Pedersen et al.,
2003). Il-6 levels have been shown to negatively correlate with
quadriceps strength in healthy older people (Yende et al., 2006)
and muscle function in elderly hospitalized patients (Bautmans
et al., 2005). Some (Pedersen et al., 2003) but not all (Roubenoff
et al., 1998) studies observed age-related increases in the more
markedly catabolic, pro-apoptotic cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Consistent with an age-related increase in chronic
low grade inflammation within muscles and this playing a part
in the development of sarcopenia is the observation of increasing expression of genes such as compliment C1QA, galectin-1,
and FOXO3A which are involved in inflammatory signaling and
apoptosis (Giresi et al., 2005).
IL-6 has been shown to downregulate IGF-1 levels both in vivo
and in vitro (De Benedetti et al., 1997; Lelbach et al., 2001), suggesting a biological link between these factors. Further, the impact
of elevated IL-6 and low IGF-1 (both individually and combined)
on mobility, independence and survival among older women has
been examined. Women in the highest quartile of IL-6 or the lowest quartile of IGF-1 had significantly compromised mobility when
compared to those with neither risk factor and women with both
risk factors had more disability and higher mortality (Cappola
et al., 2003), suggesting a compounding impact of dysregulation
in immunological and endocrine systems.
It is widely acknowledged that changes in the endocrine milieu,
especially decreased androgens and GH/IGF-1 are contributing
factor to sarcopenia (Doherty, 2003; Volpi et al., 2004; Narici and
Maffulli, 2010). Increased catabolic cytokine signaling may also
contribute though it is likely that this plays a more major role
in those elderly patients with accelerated muscle loss associated
with chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic obstructive
airway disease or rheumatoid arthritis.
LOSS OF INNERVATIONS
It has long been recognized that the pattern of histological changes
seen in muscle, described above, suggested that denervation significantly contributed to wasting. The terms “disseminated neurogenic atrophy” and “grouped denervation atrophy” were used
to describe the progressive accumulation and clustering of small,
angular fibers with denervated appearance (Tomlinson et al.,
1969). Alongside this there is a progressive loss of α-motoneurons.
The total number of limb motoneurons in the human lumbosacral

Mitchell et al. Sarcopenia, dynapenia and aging muscle
region of the human spinal cord was found to average at 57–60,000
before 60 years dropping to 45,000 in octogenarians and 40,000 in
non-agenarians (Tomlinson and Irving, 1977).
Electrophysiological studies have confirmed a decrease in the
number of motor units with aging (Brown, 1972). Alongside a
reduction in number of motor units is some increase in size of
motor units (Doherty et al., 1993), suggesting some reinnervation effort. Studies suggest a compromised potential for terminal
sprouting and reinnervation of muscle fibers, at least in aged
rodentia (Einsiedel and Luff, 1992) Further evidence supporting
rounds of denervation and reinnervation is based on the observation that the spatial distribution of fibers in each motor unit in
rat muscle becomes more clustered with advancing age (Larsson,
1995). In young humans, fiber types appear randomly distributed across the muscle but they become increasingly grouped or
clustered together in age. This may reflect a similar process of denervation and reinnervation (Nygaard and Sanchez, 1982; Lexell
and Downham, 1991; Andersen, 2003).
Fewer, larger motor units have been observed in muscles in
human upper and lower limbs, especially in smaller distal muscles
though it may be a less pronounced phenomenon in more proximal muscles such as biceps brachii (Campbell et al., 1973; Galea,
1996).
It is therefore proposed that apoptosis of motoneurons with
subsequent incomplete reinnervation of fibers by surviving neurons is a major contributor to the loss of strength and muscle mass
with age (Luff, 1998).
NUTRITION AND ACTIVITY LEVELS
Despite the observed increases in body fat and obesity seen in old
age, there is a decrease in food intake across the adult lifespan.
The reasons for this anorexia of old age are complex and include
visceral, hormonal, neurological, pharmacological, and psychological factors (Morley, 1997). In a survey of 60 years+ people in
a developed country, over 50% had a usual intake of less than
1.0 g of high quality protein per kg body weight per day (Sayhoun, 1992). In another survey, 30% had less than 0.8 g/kg/day and
15% less than 0.6 g/kg/day (Roubenoff and Hughes, 2000). It has
been suggested that the usual recommended daily amount of protein, 0.8 g/kg/day, is an underestimate and in old age 1.25 g could
be considered an appropriate value (Evans and Cyr-Campbell,
1997).
An intake of 0.45 g/kg/day has shown to lead to dramatic and
rapid loss of lean tissue and muscle function in older ladies (Castaneda et al., 1995). Dietary supplementation with oral amino
acids, providing an additional 0.25 g/kg/day of protein has been
shown to increase lean mass in sarcopenic patients (Solerte et al.,
2008).
Caloric intake also decreases and this can contribute to sarcopenia as a negative energy balance will result in a negative nitrogen
balance regardless of actual nitrogen intake (Roberts, 1995).
Further, vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-OHD ≤ 25 nmol/L)
has been shown to more than double the risk of sarcopenia (Visser
et al., 2003).
Since sarcopenia was first conceived as a concept there has been
the realization that decreasing physical activity played a role in its
development and held potential as an intervention (Rosenberg,
1989; Evans and Campbell, 1993; Evans and Cyr-Campbell, 1997).
The role of exercise as an intervention is discussed below.
COMPROMISED VASCULARIZATION
Capillary density (/mm) has been seen to decrease with age in
sedentary individuals (Coggan et al., 1992) but not in masters
athletes (Coggan et al., 1990) but these findings are not consistent.
Other studies show that a decrease in capillaries per fiber seen with
aging is largely (Frontera et al., 1990) or entirely (Andersen, 2003)
due to fibers being smaller and the resulting capillary density is
unchanged. Despite the apparent preservation of capillary density
there is a reduction in the increase in leg bulk flow on exercise
(Proctor et al., 1998).
This may be due to compromised vasomotor responsiveness in
age rather than reduced capillary numbers. There is evidence of a
lower sensitivity of arteriolar tone to normal vasodilatory stimuli;
endothelium dependent and nitric-oxide mediated; in arterioles
from the mainly slow twitch, oxidative rat soleus. There may be
heterogeneity between muscle types as this phenomenon was not
observed in the fast twitch glycolytic gastrocnemius (Muller-Delp
et al., 2002).
Compromised vascular responsiveness would expose aged
muscles to potential hypoxia, free radical stress, and could
compromise nutrient delivery.
INCREASED OXIDATIVE STRESS
With aging a reduction in the cellular anti-oxidant buffering mechanisms and an increase in the generation of free radicals due
to dysfunction in the mitochondrial respiratory chain result in
an increase in the oxidative stress to which the cell is exposed
(Barreiro et al., 2006). This will result in damage to muscle components including DNA, myofibrilar, and mitochondrial proteins,
the neuromuscular junction, and those elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which are responsible for the Ca2+ release that
initiates contraction. It may contribute to α-motoneuron atrophy
and the reduced number and function of satellite cells seen in
old age. Levels of serum protein carbonyls, a measure of oxidative
stress, are a strong predictor of weak hand grip strength in elderly
women (Howard et al., 2007).
It has been proposed that damage to mitochondrial DNA may
play a significant part in muscle aging. This tightly packed DNA
resides close to the main generator of reactive oxygen species
and is therefore at risk of accumulating genetic lesions. These
genetic insults may lead to further mitochondrial dysfunction
and a vicious-cycle of increasing oxidative stress (Hiona and
Leeuwenburgh, 2008).
There is an important heritable element in aging skeletal muscle
phenotypes but data published to date on individual genes tends
to be tentative and controversial. These are likely polygenic traits
and thus not reducible to specific polymorphisms.With increasing
age the muscle phenotype is increasingly shaped by environment.
Older muscles demonstrate a blunted anabolic response to
feeding and exercise. Enzymes involved in anaerobic metabolism
are expressed less in old muscle whilst the aerobic pathways are
preserved or enhanced. In healthy active aging, myosin isoform
expression shifts away from fast type 2A and 2X and toward slower
type I.
www.frontiersin.org July 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 260 | 13

Mitchell et al. Sarcopenia, dynapenia and aging muscle
The production of anabolic hormones such as testosterone
and IGF-1 drop in old age. Levels of the catabolic cytokines IL-6
increase.
Spinal α-motoneurons are lost with age resulting in fewer
motor units. There is some increase in size of motor units but
there is still histological evidence of denervation. Older people
eat less protein and are less active than young people. Blood vessels are less able to respond to demand for changing blood flow.
Oxidative stress increases in aged muscle and free radical damage ensues. The mechanisms that contribute to sarcopenia are
complex, overlapping, and interdependent.
INTERVENTIONS IN SARCOPENIA
A wealth of literature supports the efficacy of resistive exercise for
combating sarcopenia (Meltzer, 1994). For instance, 12 months
resistive training in septuagenarian males was found to increase
calf muscle volume by 12% and torque by 20% (Morse et al.,
2005). Instead, older women (aged 80 years+) display a blunted
anabolic response, as no increase in muscle size was found after
12 weeks of resistive training (Raue et al., 2009). Nevertheless,
from a systematic review of 120 trials with 6700 older participants, it has been found that the gains in muscle mass and
strength afforded by resistive training are associated with a small
but significant improvement in physical performance (e.g., gait
and ability to raise from a chair; Liu and Latham, 2009). It is
noteworthy that lower intensity mechanical loading such as aerobic exercise, despite being considerably less effective for inducing
muscle hypertrophy, has been found to promote protein synthesis
and expression of growth-related genes and inhibit the expression
of muscle breakdown-related genes (Harber et al., 2009). Also,
exciting new research findings suggest that aerobic exercise (running) activity sustained for decades (as that performed by master
athletes) affords protection against the age-related loss of motor
unit number. These findings show that the number of motor units
in the tibialis anterior muscle of master runners was similar to
that of young runners and significantly higher than that of agematched older inactive controls. These neuro-protective benefits
of running seem restricted to the exercised muscles of the lower
limbs since they were absent in the upper limbs (Power et al.,
2012). Furthermore, since aerobic exercise training is a potent
and effective intervention for the prevention and treatment of
insulin resistance, it is likely also to provide protection against
the blunting of insulin inhibition of proteolysis in old age, contributing therefore to prevent age-related sarcopenia (Wilkes et al.,
2009).
The associated concepts of sarcopenia and dynapenia remain
exciting fields of research. We need to refine prediction models for disability, institutionalization and mortality, and translate
these into clinical practice. Through exercise based studies we
must explore the degree of reversibility of the sarcopenic and
dynapenic states. Successful interventions may allow us to infer
causality between loss of muscle and strength and the associated
health and survival impact. Evidence supporting the use of nutritional, pharmacological, hormonal, and anti-oxidant therapies
may revolutionize the approach to treating sarcopenia.
CONCLUSION
With old age skeletal muscles get weaker and they get smaller
but they get weaker much faster than they get smaller. The force
generated per unit CSA decreases as muscle quality changes with
age. Numerous underlying mechanisms contribute to sarcopenia.
Evidence supports a role for resistive exercise training in combating sarcopenia. Nutritional and pharmacological interventions
remain areas of active research.
