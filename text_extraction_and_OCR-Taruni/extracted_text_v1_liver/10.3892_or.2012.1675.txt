Abstract. Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that acts 
by inhibiting tumor growth and disrupting tumor microvasculature through antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic and 
proapoptotic effects. It exerts these effects via inhibition 
of multiple targets including Raf serine/threonine kinases, 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases; 
VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 and platelet-derived growth 
factor receptor β (PDGFR-β). Current literature shows that the 
deregulated signaling through these receptors is commonly 
seen in human tumors. In addition, sorafenib is also shown to 
induce apoptosis through downregulation of Mcl-1 in many 
cancer types. Hence, sorafenib as a single agent has shown 
promising activity in some cancers such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and thyroid 
cancers. Currently, the drug holds FDA approval for the 
treatment of advanced RCC and unresectable HCC. However, 
many clinical studies have indicated several limitations to 
the application of sorafenib as a single agent in various other 
cancers. Owing to these reasons and the potential of sorafenib 
to synergize with other anticancer therapies, its combination 
with other targeted agents and chemotherapy has been widely 
explored with promising results. In addition, it has also shown 
synergistic results when combined with radiation. This review 
summarizes the current basic and clinical studies on the effects 
and mechanisms of sorafenib either administered alone or in 
combination with other anticancer treatments.

1. Introduction
Since the 1980s, the field of cancer treatment has experienced 
a major paradigm shift from broad-spectrum cytotoxic 
chemotherapeutics to the development of targeted therapies 
tailored to inhibit cancer-specific pathways (1). This change 
was prompted by the limitations of the treatment mainstays in those days, which were surgery, chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy. Surgery was limited to early non-metastatic 
diseases, however, research demonstrates that solid tumors 
are frequently metastatic at presentation (2). Radiation and 
chemotherapy has limited capacity to discriminate between 
cancerous and normal cells and hence, results in severe side 
effects (3). Furthermore, solid tumors are inherently resistant 
to both radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, the rationale for 
development of molecular targeted therapies was to overcome 
drug resistance, to make malignant cells more susceptible to 
suppression and damage whilst avoiding substantial toxicity 
to the rest of the body tissues and also to provide a higher 
therapeutic index.
The molecular targeted therapies include monoclonal 
antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, rapamycin pathway 
inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and inhibitors of Raf kinase 
(4). Many of these drugs have shown therapeutic benefit in 
various cancers, however, several challenges are yet to be 
conquered by the developers. These include overcoming 
certain amount of acquired resistance in cancer cells, selecting 
suitable dosage schedules, determining the stage to start 
treatment and identifying relevant combination regimens. 
In addition, there appears to be a weakness in identifying 
the most important targets in cancer, as well as an inability 
to design drugs that would specifically confront the selected 
targets (4). Hence, the utility of successful targeted therapies is 
yet to be attained in many cancer patients.
Since the implication of deregulated Raf kinases in 
tumorigenesis and progression in many solid tumors, previous

studies aimed at identifying a drug that will interfere with these 
targets. This led to the discovery of sorafenib in the late 1990s 
(1). Sorafenib acts on both the tumor and its microvasculature 
via multiple targets (5). This explains its broad activity in many 
tumor types and also its clinical effect in renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In spite of this, 
sorafenib monotherapy was shown to be less successful in 
certain cancers such as sarcomas and melanomas due to reasons 
such as patient insensitivity and drug resistance. However, the 
multiple targets of sorafenib make it an attractive choice for 
combination therapy. Therefore, the combination of sorafenib 
with other drugs has been extensively investigated, indicating 
clinical benefits in many cancer types (6).
This review aims to explore: i) sorafenib targets and 
mechanisms of inhibition in several cancers, ii) sorafenib 
monotherapy and iii) combination therapy with chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy and other targeted agents.
2. Sorafenib targets
Sorafenib is a dual action multikinase inhibitor that targets 
both tumor cells and cells of the tumor vasculature. It inhibits 
tumor proliferation by potently inhibiting the Raf serine/
threonine kinases: Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf and oncogenic 
B-Raf V600E kinases in the MAPK pathway (7) (Fig. 1). 
These kinases are pivotal regulators of cellular proliferation 
and survival and in addition Raf-1 also interacts directly with 
anti-apoptotic and apoptotic regulatory proteins to prolong 
cell survival (1). Sorafenib has shown dose-dependent inhibition of tumor proliferation in various human cancer cell lines 
containing oncogenic K-Ras or B-Raf mutations, including 
breast, colon and pancreatic cancers (5).
Sorafenib also potently inhibits proangiogenic vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGFR-1, 
VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 and the platelet-derived growth factor 
receptor β (PDGFR-β) (5). These receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs) utilize the MAPK pathway to induce proliferation and 
prolong the survival of vascular endothelial cells, which gives 
rise to new blood vessels (2). Also they promote the proliferation, survival and recruitment of pericytes, which stabilize 
the newly formed blood vessels.
In addition, sorafenib has been shown to induce apoptosis 
in several tumor cell lines (5). Although this mechanism is 
not fully understood, it is commonly observed that sorafenib 
inhibits phosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF4E resulting 
in loss of the anti-apoptotic protein: myeloid cell leukemia-1 
(Mcl-1). The downregulation of Mcl-1 by sorafenib causes the 
release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. 
This activates caspase and induces apoptotic cell death.
3. Expression of sorafenib targets and mechanisms of 
action in cancers
Research has shown that in about 30% of human cancers, 
signaling through the Raf kinase isoforms is deregulated 
(1). Activating oncogenic mutations in B-Raf, such as B-Raf 
V600E is present in 63% of melanomas and up to 50% of 
papillary thyroid carcinomas. Wild-type Raf-1 is often hyperactivated in several human solid tumors due to constitutively 
active upstream oncogenic Ras mutants or overexpression of 
upstream growth factors or their RTKs. In addition, activated 
Ras oncogenes such as K-Ras are prevalent in human solid 
tumors. This includes 90% of pancreatic, 45% of colorectal, 
30% HCCs, 35% non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 15% 
of melanomas and 10% kidney tumors. Also Raf-1 hyperactivation in the absence of oncogenic mutations is commonly 
seen in RCC and HCC and it is associated with poor prognosis 
in ovarian and androgen-insensitive prostate cancer (1).
VEGF is expressed in ~30-60% of most solid tumors 
and in up to 100% of RCC (8). Overall different tumors have 
been shown to express different VEGF ligands. For instance 
VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are upregulated in intratumoral 
endothelial cells, circulating endothelial cells, endothelial 
progenitor cells and tumor cells.
As sorafenib acts via various targets, its mechanism of action 
in different cancers is different depending on the expression of 
targets. It may be impossible to determine the role of individual 
targets in cancers but the preclinical data can be used to understand the contribution of various mechanisms of sorafenib in 
different cancers (5). These mechanisms are summarized in 
Table I.
4. Sorafenib monotherapy
Clinical trials investigating the effect of sorafenib as a single 
agent have yielded encouraging results in some human solid 
tumors. Currently sorafenib is approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with 
advanced RCC and those with unresectable HCC (9). It is 
also approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) 
for the treatment of patients with HCC and advanced RCC in 
whom previous interferon (IFN)-α or interleukin (IL)-2-based 
therapy had failed or in those considered to be unsuitable for 
such therapy.
Renal cell carcinoma. Two randomized controlled clinical 
trials established the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in 
Figure 1. Multiple targets of sorafenib. Sorafenib inhibits auto-phosphorylation of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 and PDGFR-B, and also prevents 
Raf activation. The inhibition of Raf is associated with downregulation of 
downstream signaling and regulation of other pathways that lead to apoptosis.

patients with advanced RCC. The first one was a phase III 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled TARGET trial 
with 903 patients who had failed previous standard therapy 
(10). These patients were randomly assigned to either sorafenib 
400 mg twice daily orally or placebo. The primary end-point 
was overall survival. Crossover from placebo to sorafenib was 
permitted after a single planned analysis of progression-free 
survival (PFS), which showed statistically significant benefit 
over placebo. The median PFS for sorafenib group was 
5.5 months while that of placebo group was 2.8 [hazard ratio 
(HR)=0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.55; P<0.01]. 
The most common adverse effects were diarrhea, rash, 
fatigue and hand-foot skin reactions (HFSR). Hypertension 
and cardiac ischemia were rare serious adverse events, more 
common in the sorafenib group (10). The final overall survival 
data showed a statistically significant benefit in the sorafenib 
group after the post-crossover placebo survival data was 
censored (17.8 vs. 14.3 months; HR=0.78; P=0.029) (9).
The other study was a phase II randomized discontinuation 
trial, which evaluated the effect of sorafenib on 65 patients 
who had stable disease after 12 weeks on sorafenib (11). The 
primary end-point was the percentage of patients remaining 
progression-free at 24 weeks after sorafenib initiation. At 
24 weeks, 50% of sorafenib-treated patients were progressionfree compared to 18% of placebo-treated patients (P=0.0077). 
Median PFS was significantly longer with sorafenib (24 weeks)

than with placebo (6 weeks; P=0.087). After this sorafenib was 
restarted in patients who were on placebo with a median PFS of 
24 weeks. Common side effects were skin rash/desquamation, 
HFSR and fatigue. Although patients on sorafenib experienced 
more side effects, the overall rate of events was low and the 
toxic effects were moderate and easily manageable (10,12). 
Bukowski et al demonstrated that sorafenib shows clinical 
benefit without adversely impacting overall quality-of-life 
(QOL) and has a positive impact on some individual symptoms 
and concerns (13).
Hepatocellular carcinoma. HCC is a highly vascularized, 
VEGF-driven tumor. No therapeutically beneficial drug in 
advanced inoperable HCC was available until 2007 (9). It 
came as a breakthrough discovery in the field when sorafenib 
improved overall survival (OS) in advanced HCC patients 
in a phase II randomized placebo-controlled trial (14). 
Subsequently two phase III randomized double-blind placebocontrolled trials were conducted.
The SHARP trial evaluated 602 patients with advanced 
HCC who had not received prior systemic therapy, to receive 
either sorafenib or placebo with the primary endpoint being 
OS (14). The median OS was significantly longer in the 
sorafenib group than in the placebo group (10.7 vs. 7.9 months; 
P<0.001). The time to radiologic progression was also significantly longer in the sorafenib group compared to placebo

group (5.5 vs. 2.8 months; P<0.001) and the estimated PFS 
rate at 4 months was 62 and 42%, respectively. Moreover, the 
disease control was significantly better in the sorafenib group 
than in the placebo group (43 vs. 32%, P=0.002). However, 
the adverse events were also more frequent in the sorafenib 
group (80 vs. 52%). These effects were mainly of grade 1 or 2 
in severity and included diarrhea, weight loss, HFSR, anorexia 
and alopecia.
These results were affirmed by the results from the AsiaPacific trial, which enrolled patients with similar eligibility 
criteria. The median OS was 6.5 months in the sorafenib group 
compared with 4.2 months in the placebo group, while the 
median time to progression was also significantly prolonged 
in the sorafenib vs. the placebo group (2.8 vs. 1.4 months; 
P=0.0005) (15). The side effect profile was also similar to the 
SHARP trial.
Although both trials reported an increased adverse event 
frequency in sorafenib-treated patients, the drug was welltolerated and the side effects were manageable (15,16). The 
absolute risk of discontinuation or dose reductions was low 
and could be mitigated by more aggressive monitoring and 
management.
In order to predict the long-term prognosis after resection 
of tumors, a preclinical study was undertaken to investigate the 
effects of sorafenib on tumor growth, recurrence and metastasis after curative resection of HCC in mice (17). This study 
revealed that sorafenib inhibited the recurrence and metastasis 
of HCC after HCC resection, producing a maximum of 88% 
reduction in intrahepatic recurrent tumor volume and a 100% 
reduction in lung metastasis. It also showed a 10.7-fold reduction in tumor recurrence. A phase III study to evaluate the use 
of sorafenib to prevent recurrence and to improve survival 
after surgical resection or local ablation (STORM study) is 
currently underway.
Thyroid cancer. Three phase II studies have been conducted 
to determine the efficacy of sorafenib in advanced follicular 
thyroid cancer (18). These studies showed that sorafenib 
had significant activity with partial responses ranging from 
15-25% and stabilization of the disease occurring in an additional 34-56% of the patients. The median PFS ranged from 
13.5 to 19.6 months. Furthermore, the overall safety profile 
was acceptable and adverse events were consistent with other 
sorafenib trials (19). In light of these promising results, a 
phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sorafenib 
in advanced/metastatic iodine refractory thyroid cancer was 
initiated (18). Additionally, some guidelines have begun 
to recommend sorafenib in patients with iodine-refractory 
progressive metastatic disease who are not willing or able to 
enter previous clinical trials.
However, in some other cancers like melanoma, sorafenib 
monotherapy still continues to elude clinical benefit. As 
mentioned before there is a strong preclinical and clinical 
evidence supporting the role of B-Raf in driving melanoma 
progression. In spite of this, sorafenib, being a B-Raf inhibitor, 
did not demonstrate significant activity in advanced melanoma 
patients (20,21). Subsequent preclinical studies also showed 
that sorafenib treatment just led to minor inhibition of B-Raf 
with many off-target effects (21). Therefore, sorafenib alone 
did not offer much benefit in melanoma treatment. Similar 
results were observed in many other types of cancers, of which 
some are summarized in Table II.

5. Sorafenib combination therapy
Sorafenib has various characteristics that suggest it would 
be a useful combination treatment option for advanced 
malignancies. The targeting of multiple Raf isoforms and 
various tyrosine kinase inhibitors may help overcome multidrug resistant genes (2). Also its ability to induce apoptosis 
in various tumors could complement the cytotoxic effects 
of standard chemotherapies. Evidence also suggests that 
inhibition of Raf-1 by sorafenib can resensitize tumor cells to 
radiation and chemotherapy (2). Moreover, the use of sorafenib 
in combination with other drugs means that the doses can be 
reduced and hence it might help alleviate the side effects of the 
drugs. Owing to these reasons and the limitations of monotherapy, its role in combination with other agents has been 
widely explored. A figure summarizing the mode of action of 
combination agents used with sorafenib is shown in Fig. 2.
Sorafenib and other targeted agents. A phase I dose-escalation trial of sorafenib and bevacizumab was performed at 
below-recommended single-agent doses involving 39 patients 
with various cancers (22). This combination showed promising clinical activity especially in ovarian cancer. However, 
the rapidity and frequency of dose reductions indicated an 
intolerable long-term dosage and the need for alternative 
dosing schedules. Recently another phase I study reported that 
intermittent sorafenib dosing with bevacizumab has clinical 
activity, fewer patients require a sorafenib dose reduction and 
fewer side effects are observed (23).
The combination of sorafenib with erlotinib was investigated in a phase I trial which reported that the combination 
was well-tolerated and showed promising activity (24). In a 
phase II trial for the combination, a higher PFS and OS was 
seen in the EGFR wild-type and the EGFR FISH-negative 
patients compared to erlotinib alone (25). However, additional

studies are needed to confirm the benefit of this combination. 
Recently, a preclinical study of the combination of sorafenib 
with erlotinib or cetuximab showed synergistic antitumor 
activity in both colorectal cancer and NSCLC (26).
A phase I study that investigated sorafenib plus IFN-α-2a 
in advanced RCC and melanoma showed preliminary antitumor activity and the doses were well-tolerated (27). Another 
study investigating sorafenib with IFN-α-2b in advanced RCC 
patients showed substantial activity, but the toxicity exceeded 
that of either drug alone (28). However, dose reductions and 
breaks between cycles allowed for long term therapy. In 
contrast, a more recent phase II study that investigated the 
combination of sorafenib and pegylated IFN-α-2b in metastatic 
melanoma patients showed modest clinical activity and some 
serious side effects including fatal bleeding complications 
(29). This may have been due to a different dosing schedule 
or the use of Peg-IFN-α-2b instead of conventional IFN-α. 
Additional studies are summarized in Table III.
Sorafenib and chemotherapy. Sorafenib in combination with 
doxorubicin was studied in a phase I dose escalating study in 
patients with advanced solid tumors, which showed that the 
increasing dose did not result in significant toxicity and also 
promising efficacy results were observed (30). Subsequently, 
a phase II double-blind study was conducted in patients with 
advanced HCC (31). The median time to progression, OS and 
PFS were greater with sorafenib plus doxorubicin compared 
to doxorubicin alone. The degree to which this improvement 
represents synergism remains to be defined.
An alternative combination with sorafenib, docetaxel and 
cisplatin was studied as a phase II study in gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (32). This study showed 
encouraging efficacy with a tolerable toxicity and hence 
further investigations are warranted.
A phase I study with sorafenib, carboplatin and paclitaxel 
(CP) on advanced NSCLC showed encouraging antitumor 
activity and manageable adverse effects (33,34). However, in a 
phase III randomized, double blind trial, no clinical benefit was 
observed from adding sorafenib to CP as first-line treatment 
for NSCLC. Likewise in another phase III trial, the addition 
of sorafenib to CP did not improve PFS or OS over placebo 
plus CP and hence cannot be recommended in the second-line 
setting for patients with advanced melanoma (35).
A phase II study with sorafenib, gemcitabine and 
capecitabine (GC) in advanced RCC has also shown encouraging results (36). The PFS and response rates were greater 
than those observed with sorafenib monotherapy or GC and 
also the adverse events were manageable. Additional studies 
are summarized in Table III.
Sorafenib and radiotherapy. The spectrum of kinase inhibition and the toxicity profile of sorafenib increases its potential 
to synergize with radiation through various mechanisms, such 
as proliferation inhibition, vascular normalization and interference with intracellular signaling pathways (37). Evidence 
has suggested that Raf-1 caused radiation resistance through 
an increased radiation-induced potentially lethal damage 
repair capacity in HCC cell lines (38). Thus targeting these 
molecules via sorafenib will re-sensitize these cells to radiation.
Plastaras et al demonstrated that sorafenib did not affect 
cell survival in vitro, but altered the radiation response in a 
schedule-dependent manner in vivo, with radiation treatment 
followed sequentially by sorafenib being associated with the 
greatest antitumor activity (39).
Similar results were observed in another preclinical study, 
which investigated the effect of sorafenib plus radiation on 
colorectal cancer cell lines (37). Sorafenib had little effect on 
radiation response in vitro but was highly effective in vivo, 
suggesting that inhibition of proliferation and interference with 
angiogenesis may be the basis for the interaction. However, 
there was an interesting observation in the investigation of the 
timing of sorafenib and radiation through the inhibition assay. 
A significant growth inhibition was observed when sorafenib 
was given 2 h after radiation in the HT29 cell line. This 
correlates with the results of Plastaras et al, although their 
conclusion was derived from in vivo studies (39). Following 
these promising results, studies are currently underway investigating the efficacy in other tumor types as well (37).
6. Conclusions
The enhanced understanding of the etiology of cancer has led 
to an era of molecular targeted therapies that aim to achieve 
tumor selectivity and limit drug-related toxicities. Sorafenib 
has emerged as a promising means of addressing these issues 
with its multiple mechanisms of action and favorable safety 
and efficacy profile. This resulted in its FDA approval for the 
treatment of advanced RCC and HCC. However, in many other 
cancers, it is still limited in activity due to reasons not clearly 
understood. Fortunately the utility of sorafenib in cancer 
therapy does not end with this, because its unique and multiple 
mechanisms of action on tumor and tumor microvasculature 
has proven valuable when combined with other anticancer 
therapies, such as other molecular targeted agents, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A growing body of clinical research 
supports these combinations and expects that these novelties 
will soon make their way into cancer treatments. Therefore, 
sorafenib has not yet failed its original promise. Future issues 
include identifying optimal combinations, treatment schedules 
and dosage of sorafenib combinations for a variety of tumor 
types. In addition, the appropriate biomarkers for improved 
patient selection and response end-points need to be defined 
and validated in order to improve the benefits of sorafenib 
treatment.
