ABSTRACT
Background This study examines sickle cell trait 
(SCT) as a cause of sudden death in National Collegiate 
Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes and explores the 
cost-effectiveness of different screening models.
Methods The authors reviewed the cause of all 
cases of sudden death in NCAA student-athletes from 
January 2004 through December 2008. The authors 
also explored the cost-effectiveness of screening for 
this condition in selected populations assuming that 
identifying athletes with SCT would prevent death.
Results There were 273 deaths and a total of 
1 969 663 athlete-participant-years. Five (2%) deaths 
were associated with SCT. In football athletes, there 
were 72 (26%) deaths. Of these, 52 (72%) were due to 
trauma unrelated to sports activity and 20 (28%) were 
due to medical causes; nine deaths were cardiac (45%), 
fi ve were associated with SCT (25%). Thirteen of the 20 
deaths due to medical causes occurred during exertion; 
cardiac (6, 46%) SCT associated (5, 39%), and heat 
stroke unrelated to SCT (2, 15%). All deaths associated 
with SCT occurred in black Division I football athletes. 
The risk of exertional death in Division I football players 
with SCT was 1:827 which was 37 times higher than in 
athletes without SCT. The cost per case identifi ed varied 
widely depending on the population screened and the 
price of the screening test.
Conclusions Exertional death in athletes with SCT 
occurs at a higher rate than previously appreciated. 
More research is needed to (1) understand the 
pathophysiology of death in SCT-positive athletes and 
(2) determine whether screening high-risk populations 
reduces mortality.
INTRODUCTION
Sickle cell trait (SCT) has received signifi cant attention as a cause of death in American football athletes. It has been cited in the medical literature as 
a leading cause of death in military basic training 
and civilian organised sport,1–4 and the lay press 
has characterised death in football athletes with 
SCT as nearly epidemic. SCT is common, with 1 
in 14 (7%) of blacks having SCT and up to 1 in 625 
Caucasians carrying the gene.5 However, while 
SCT is common in the general population, the RR 
of exertional death related to SCT is unknown.
Normal haemoglobin (Hgb) is composed of two 
α and two β chains. Hgb S results from the substitution of a valine for glutamic acid at the sixth 
amino acid of the β globin chain. Hgb S produces a 
haemoglobin tetramer that is poorly soluble when 
deoxygenated which can cause the red blood cell to 
form a sickle shape. Sickle cell disease occurs when 
an individual is homozygous for Hgb S. Vasoocclusion and haemolysis leading to sickle cell crisis 
are the hallmark of sickle cell disease which is generally incompatible with strenuous exercise. SCT 
occurs when an individual has one normal Hgb 
gene and one for Hgb S and is usually considered 
benign. Although there is an increased incidence of 
exertional death in those with SCT, the underlying 
pathophysiological mechanism is unclear.
An association of SCT with sudden death was 
fi rst reported in 1970 when it was noted that a disproportionate number of deaths in military recruits 
training at moderate altitude were positive for 
SCT.6 Kark expanded on these fi ndings reporting 
that the risk of sudden death in black recruits with 
SCT was 28 times those without SCT in a review 
of medical records and autopsy data.7 Other studies in military basic training have confi rmed an 
association of sudden death with SCT.8 9 Concern 
of a similar association in athletes developed after 
the 1973 death of a college football player and was 
fi rst addressed by an National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA) guideline in 1975. Despite 
NCAA guidelines, there have continued to be intermittent deaths related to SCT in the NCAA. There 
is no published literature quantifying the risk of 
death in NCAA athletes with SCT; however, in 
2010 legislation was enacted requiring all Division 
I schools to screen athletes or have them sign a 
waiver declining the screen, if the athletes’ SCT 
status was not already known from neonatal birth 
screening. This study examines SCT associated 
sudden death in NCAA athletes and explores the 
cost-effectiveness of different screening models.
METHODS
All cases of sudden death in NCAA student-athletes from January 2004 through December 2008 
were examined for cause of death using a previously defi ned database of death in athletes.10 The 
database was developed using two different data 
sources:1 the NCAA Resolutions list and2 from 
the Parent Heart Watch (PHW) database. The 
NCAA Resolutions list is compiled annually in 
honorarium of NCAA student-athletes who have 
died of any cause and is voluntary. PHW is a notfor-profi t group dedicated to the prevention and 
awareness of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in young 
people. They keep an ongoing database of sudden

annually, and these reports are compiled periodically by the 
NCAA Department of Research. The number of athletes participating overall and in football in each division was recorded. 
The numbers of black athletes and non-black athletes were 
also noted, and the numbers of those with SCT were estimated as being 7% of black athletes and 0.16% of non-black 
athletes (the vast majority of who were Caucasian) according 
to prevalence rates reported by the Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC).5 Death in NCAA athletes was noted and death in football athletes was examined with particular attention to death 
in athletes with SCT.
The cost-effectiveness of screening athletes for SCT was 
explored to estimate the cost per life-year gained of different 
screening models assuming that identifi cation of an athlete 
with SCT would prevent their death. The cost of screening 
tests used to identify SCT varies according to the type of test 
as well as regional variations in cost. Three test costs were 
examined:1 $5,2 $30 and3 $150. The ‘simple $5 screening test’ 
was initially identifi ed by the NCAA as a viable test method. 
Beginning in October 2011, the NCAA has contracted with a 
laboratory to provide screening haemoglobin solubility tests 
to member institutions for about $10 and haemoglobin electrophoresis for ~$30. Haemoglobin electrophoresis can cost 
up to $150 at some institutions. Cost-effectiveness was calculated assuming an initial start-up year when all athletes 
were screened. Screening in subsequent years occurred only 
for incoming athletes and was calculated assuming no start-up 
year. For simplicity, it was assumed that testing for SCT was 
100% sensitive and specifi c and that identifi cation of an athlete with SCT would prevent their death representing a bestcase scenario. It was also assumed that prevention of death 
in a college-aged athlete would afford an additional 50-year 
life expectancy (approximating the average life expectancy). 
death and SCA in young people created from weekly internet searches. The PHW Database was reviewed, and deaths 
in NCAA athletes were identifi ed and cross-referenced with 
the NCAA Resolutions list, which was then combined into a 
single database.
Missing information regarding cause of death was acquired 
through internet searches and media reports, reports in the 
NCAA News as well as emails and telephone calls to sports 
information directors, head athletic trainers, athletic directors 
and coroners. When possible, the student-athlete’s parents or 
guardians were interviewed. The study was approved by the 
University of Washington Division of Human Subjects.
Demographic data in NCAA athletes were obtained from 
the NCAA Sport Sponsorship and Participation Rates Report11
and the NCAA Student Ethnicity Report.12 The gender and 
ethnic information is provided by institutions to the NCAA

black Division I football players with SCT the risk of exertional 
death was 22 times greater than exertional death in black players without SCT (table 1). The overall risk of exertional death 
from any cause was 5.2 times higher in black athletes with or 
without SCT compared with that in non-black athletes.
Cost-effectiveness of screening was dependent on the 
population screened, the price of the screening test and the 
assumption that identifi cation of athletes with SCT prevents 
death. Four subgroups were examined;1 black football athletes (all divisions),2 football athletes (all ethnicities, all divisions),3 black athletes (all sports, all divisions) and4 all athletes 
(all ethnicities, all sports and all divisions). The cost estimate 
included a fi rst year of screening all athletes at an institution 
followed by only screening incoming athletes over the 5 year 
study. The total cost of the programme ranged from $202 900 
(black football athletes) to $119 539 920 (all athletes). The cost 
to prevent one death over 5 years ranged from $40 580 (black 
football athletes) to $23 907 984 (all athletes). The cost per lifeyear saved ranged from $812 to $478 160 (table 2). Screening 
only incoming athletes was cost-effective in all groups if a $30 
test was used costing $2435 per year life saved (black football 
athletes) to $47 816 (all athletes) (table 3).
DISCUSSION
SCT is associated with exertional death in NCAA football players with a rate of 1:827 in Division I football athletes. The death 
rate is 37 times higher in football athletes with SCT than those 
without. Death in other athletes with SCT or those undergoing strenuous physical exertion has been reported although in 
this cohort no other sports were represented.1 3 4 8 9 13–15 The 
National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research has 
documented 12 deaths association with SCT, seven of which 
occurred between 2000 and 2008. Other experts have cited 
up to 19 deaths associated with SCT in NCAA athletes since 
1973 (Eichner, personal communication). All but 2 of these 19 
deaths have been in Division I football players. There has been 
one NCAA male basketball athlete playing pick-up basketball 
A cost per life year saved less than $50 000 was considered 
cost-effective.
RESULTS
During the 5-year period from 2004 to 2008, there were 273 
deaths and a total of 1 969 663 athlete-participant-years. Five 
(2%) of all deaths occurred in athletes with SCT(fi gure 1). 
Football represented 72 (26%) of all student-athlete deaths. Of 
these, 52 (72%) were due to trauma unrelated to sports activity 
and 20 (28%) were due to medical causes (fi gure 2). The leading medical cause of death in football athletes was cardiac (9, 
45%), followed by death associated with SCT (5, 25%), heat 
stroke unrelated to SCT (2, 10%), cancer (2, 10%), diabetes (1, 
5%) and sepsis (1, 5%). No deaths were related to head trauma 
or concussion. No deaths occurred during competition.
Deaths which occurred with exertion were analysed. These 
included deaths due to cardiac causes, heat illness and deaths 
associated with SCT. In football players, there were 12 exertional deaths. Of the exertional deaths, fi ve were related to cardiac causes (42%), fi ve were in athletes with SCT (42%) and two 
were from heat stroke in athletes without SCT (15%) (fi gure 3).
All deaths in athletes with SCT occurred in black Division 
I football athletes during practice or conditioning. Thus, the 
risk of death associated with SCT in non-football athletes or 
non-black athletes in this cohort was zero. For those identifi ed with SCT, the risk was quite high. Overall, the risk of 
exertional death associated with SCT was 1:4706 for all athletes (all sports, all divisions, all ethnicities) and 1:4171 for 
black athletes (all sports, all divisions). For Division I football 
players (all ethnicities) with SCT the risk of death was 1:827, 
and in black Division I football athletes with SCT the risk was 
1:805 (table 1).
The RR of exertional death in athletes with SCT (all divisions, all sports) was 15 times higher than exertional death in 
athletes without SCT. In Division I football athletes (all ethnicities) with SCT, the risk of exertional death was 37 times 
greater than exertional death in those without SCT, and in

Strategies to prevent death in those with SCT seem warranted. Restriction from play is not recommended, but 
instead screening and targeted interventions are needed in 
those with SCT.27 28 Determining the SCT status of athletes 
can be accomplished by reviewing previous medical history 
or repeat testing. All newborns are screened at birth for sickle 
cell disease where early interventions in those homozygous 
for Hgb S have shown to positively impact health. While 
SCT status is also identifi ed, this information may not be 
communicated and is often not recalled by the athlete or 
their parents. If SCT status is not known, testing can be 
accomplished by several methods. A haemoglobin solubility 
test is recommended by the NCAA at a minimum. In this 
test, a reagent is added to blood. Hgb S is insoluble compared 
with other haemoglobins and the blood will appear cloudy 
instead of clear. This test does not distinguish between sickle 
cell disease, SCT and other haemoglobin variants and false 
positives and false negatives occur. A positive test should be 
followed up with additional testing to confi rm and further 
defi ne any abnormalities. The NCAA has contracted with a 
national laboratory to provide this testing to NCAA institutions for less than $10.
and one male track athlete who have reportedly died from 
exertional collapse in athletes with SCT.
Although there is an association between exertional death 
and SCT, the pathophysiology of death is unknown. It has been 
proposed that a combination of high-intensity exercise, dehydration and thermal strain may induce suffi cient hyperthermia, 
hyperosmolality, acidosis and red cell dehydration to lead to 
signifi cant erythrocyte sickling, infl ammation and microvascular occlusion causing exertional collapse in some exercisers 
with SCT.2 15–18 Blood viscosity and adhesion properties are 
also altered in athletes with SCT.19–26 The proposed mechanism of death is arrhythmia caused by hyperkalaemia from 
muscle necrosis and altered ion channel permeability.1 2 16 18
However, others argue that this is unlikely citing the contrast 
between the proposed pathophysiology and the known problems seen in people with sickle cell disease who experience 
sickling episodes with splenic, pulmonary and bony infarcts. 
Environmental factors such as exercise intensity, altitude, 
hydration status and concurrent illness likely play a role in the 
development of exertional death in SCT. There may also be 
other genetic co-factors which make some athletes with SCT 
more likely to be affected than others.18

Haemoglobin electrophoresis is a more accurate method to 
determine haemoglobin type. With electrophoresis, the haemoglobin migrates through a gel at different rates when an 
electrical charge is applied. Hgb electrophoresis can differentiate between different Hgb subtypes and is considered the most 
accurate method for identifi cation of haemoglobinopathies. 
Isoelectric focusing has also been used to identify those with 
SCT. This test is similar to electrophoresis except the blood 
is run through a gel with a pH gradient. Electrophoresis and 
isoelectric focusing are considerably more expensive and more 
time-consuming to perform than Hgb solubility testing. Many 
institutions do not have the capacity to quickly perform multiple tests which can be problematic if athletic participation is 
restricted until SCT status is known.
From a public health perspective, screening should only be 
performed if there is an effective intervention. It is unclear if 
recommended interventions in athletes with SCT are effective. Recommended interventions include screening to identify athletes followed by education, targeted modifi cations 
of training and conditioning, an acclimatisation schedule, 
cessation of activity with any symptoms, and allowing SCT 
athletes to set their own pace. Athletes must also emphasise 
hydration, controlling asthma, oxygen availability at altitude 
and restricting workouts if he/she is ill.27 However, deaths 
do occur in athletes despite knowledge of sickle cell status. 
During the cohort studied, the status of one athlete with SCT 
who died (20%) was known. In the last decade, there have 
been 10 exertional deaths in NCAA football players with SCT. 
The SCT status was known in three athletes (30%) based on 
publicly available records.
The armed services have different approaches to prevention of exertional death related to SCT. The United States 
Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force all screen recruits for SCT. 
The Army does not screen for SCT status; however, in 1982 
in response to the increased number of basic training deaths 
in SCT recruits, the US Army implemented strict hydration 
policies including direct observation of recruit drinking and 
measurement of wet bulb globe temperature with modifi cation of training if a certain threshold was reached. During 
the 10 years of the study period (1982 to 1991), there were no 
deaths related to SCT in the intervention group (2.3 million 
recruits) compared with an unchanged rate of deaths in nonparticipating centres (1.2 million recruits).29 The conclusion of 
this study was that exertional heat illness is the predominant 
factor causing exercise-related deaths associated with SCT. 
It has also been demonstrated that exertional sickling can be 
prevented with adequate hydration.17 30 Recruit deaths in the 
Army have increased since the initial intervention prompting 
the military to re-examine its policies.
CONCLUSIONS
SCT is associated with an increased risk of death in NCAA 
football athletes. While the most common medical cause of 
death in football athletes is sudden cardiac death, most athletes dying during exertion in football are positive for SCT. 
NCAA football players identifi ed with SCT have an exceedingly high-risk of exertional death (1:827) that is 37 times 
higher than those without SCT. Screening for SCT status 
or signing a waiver is required of NCAA Division I athletes 
although the value of SCT athlete identifi cation and targeted 
training modifi cations to reduce mortality has not been 
proven. If identifi cation of athletes with SCT is effective in 
preventing mortality, then screening high-risk groups would 
be cost-effective.
Additional research is needed to understand the value of 
screening for SCT in NCAA athletes. Given all deaths in athletes 
with SCT in this cohort occurred in black Division I football 
athletes during practice or conditioning, it seems medically and 
ethically prudent to screen the highest risk group of athletes – 
at least black Division I football players, with consideration in 
all black athletes and/or all football players – and target educational interventions for the player, coaches and medical staff. 
The value of screening in other populations, for instance high 
school or recreational athletes, is unknown. Strict attention to 
heat and hydration has been demonstrated to prevent death in 
US military recruits and should be heavily emphasised in football practice and conditioning. Universal attention to adequate 
hydration, heat mitigation practices and not continuing to push 
a struggling athlete should be adopted in all sports.

What this study adds
▶ This study is the fi rst study to examine the incidence of 
death associated with sickle cell trait (SCT) in college 
athletes.
▶ Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in 
National Collegiate Athletic Association football athletes 
but SCT is an important and potentially preventable cause 
of death associated with exertion.
▶ The incidence of exertional death in athletes with SCT is 
1:827.
▶ It is unknown whether screening prevents death associated 
with SCT.
