INTRODUCTION 
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a form of functional renal impairment, is one of the most serious complications in patients with 
advanced liver cirrhosis or acute liver failure. The main pathophysiology of development of HRS is reno-vascular constriction.1
 In patients with advanced liver cirrhosis, the development of splanchnic 
vasodilatation causes a reduction in effective arterial blood volume, which leads to increased synthesis of several vasoactive mediators.2,3 Terlipressin is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, 
which causes vasoconstriction of splanchnic vessels and improves 
impaired renal function.2,4 Terlipressin is associated with a much 
lower incidence of ischemic complications compared with vasopressin, but it may still cause such problems. We report a case of 
severe ischemic bowel necrosis that developed after use of terlipressin for HRS in a patient with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.
CASE REPORT
A 46-year-old man with underlying liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) secondary to chronic hepatitis B presented with abdominal distension. The patient had undergone hepatic 
segmentectomy 1 year previously due to HCC. After HCC recurrence, he had been receiving transarterial chemoembolization 
(TACE), and fifth TACE was done 1 month previously. Abdominal 
computed tomography (CT) which was taken 2 weeks after the 
last TACE showed no viable tumor in the liver. But, increased size 
of lymph nodes in the portocaval space and newly developed ascites were noted. Portal vein was patent without thrombosis.
At admission, electrocardiography was normal and there was

Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that is widely used in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome or variceal bleeding. 
Because it acts mainly on splanchnic vessels, terlipressin has a lower incidence of severe ischemic complications than 
does vasopressin. However, it can still lead to serious complications such as myocardial infarction, skin necrosis, or 
bowel ischemia. Herein we report a case of severe ischemic bowel necrosis in a 46-year-old cirrhotic patient treated with 
terlipressin. Although the patient received bowel resection, death occurred due to ongoing hypotension and metabolic 
acidosis. Attention should be paid to patients complaining of abdominal pain during treatment with terlipressin. (Clin

no evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Initial serum creatinine was 1.2 
mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 12 mg/dL. Albumin level was 3.6 g/dL, aspartate transaminase 136 IU/L, alanine transaminase 137 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 215 IU/L and total bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL. Hemoglobin level was 14.3 g/dL and platelet count 
was 284,000/uL. Prothrombin time was 12.8 seconds. A moderate 
amount of ascites was noted, and urine output decreased. Diagnostic paracentesis and ascitic fluid analysis was done. Albumin 
was 2.2 g/dL, leukocyte count was 300/mm3 (neutrophil 61%, 
lymphocyte 10%, monocyte and macrophage 29%), lactate dehydrogenase was 541 IU/L, glucose was 101 mg/dL in ascites, and 
bacteria was not seen on gram stain and culture of ascites. Serumto-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 1.4, suggesting ascites 
from portal hypertension. There was no definite evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Twenty mg of furosemide combined 
with 50 mg of spironolactone, was administered for three days.
Three days after admission, serum creatinine had increased to 
3.31 mg/dL and BUN had increased to 37.6 mg/dL. The fractional 
excretion of sodium was 0.8%. The diuretics were stopped, and a 
total of 80 g of albumin was administered and hydration with 1.5 L 
of normal saline was done for two days to rule out the possibility 
of pre-renal acute kidney injury. Despite such a treatment, there 
was no improvement of serum creatinine. No nephrotoxic drug 
was used and the blood pressure was generally stable. There was 
no evidence of parenchymal kidney disease such as marked proteinuria or hematuria. Abdominal sonography showed normal 
echogenicity on both kidney, and urinary tract abnormality was 
not noted. According to the criteria of International Ascites Club in 
2007,5 we diagnosed the patient’s renal failure as type I HRS. One 
mg of terlipressin was intravenously administrated every 6 
hours. Because the patient complained of severe abdominal pain 
after 2 doses of terlipressin, it was stopped. Serum creatinine and 
BUN increased to 7.95 mg/dL and 84.4 mg/dL, respectively, and 
hourly urine volume became further decreased (Fig. 1). Continuous 
renal replace therapy was applied for supporting impaired renal 
function. But, the patient’s abdominal pain aggravated and whole 
abdominal tenderness appeared. Rebound tenderness was also 
noted. Abdominal CT revealed that the wall of mid-ileum appeared to be thin and not enhanced with contrast. There were 
multiple air bubbles in the mesenteric veins and in the bowel wall, 
suggesting pneumatosis intestinalis (Fig. 2). Otherwise, there was 
Figure 2. Abdominal CT revealed thinning of the small-intestine wall (arrowhead) and multiple air bubbles in mesenteric veins (arrow) (A). Air 
bubbles were also evident in the bowel wall (arrow) (B).

no thrombus within vessel or free air in peritoneal cavity. 
With these findings, the patient was diagnosed with bowel necrosis due to mesenteric ischemia induced by terlipressin. The patient received an emergency bowel resection.
Operative findings demonstrated the small bowel segment below the Treitz ligament to be in an ischemic state. The blood flow 
was improved after adjusting the direction of bowel mesentery 
but the infarction of ileum was severe, so approximately 30 cm of 
it was resected. Grossly, the resected bowel also had ischemic 
change on serosa and mesentery, and the mucosa was atrophied 
and black-pigmented on the opening of the bowel lumen (Fig. 
3A). Microscopically, there were necrosis and hemorrhages in the 
bowel wall (Fig. 3B).
There were no any immediate complications associated with 
surgery, but hypotension and metabolic acidosis persisted. Eventually, the patient died 2 days after operation.
DISCUSSION
Terlipressin, which is a synthetic long-acting analogue of vasopressin with intrinsic vasoconstrictor activity, is widely used in the 
treatment of cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding and it improves renal function and short-term survival in HRS.6-9
Terlipressin is a vasoconstrictor that acts preferentially on the 
splanchnic circulation, lowering portal venous pressure. However, 
all the vasoconstrictors influence the systemic circulation, which 
may result in ischemic complications. Although terlipressin is associated with a lower incidence of adverse events compared to vasopressin and other synthetic analogues as it is a selective vasoconstrictor, it also can produce systemic effects. An average incidence 
of adverse events is 12% of patients treated; most are cardiovascular or ischemic complications.3,7 Common adverse events including headache, paleness, abdominal pain and bradycardia are usually mild, but serious complications such as myocardial infarction,8
skin necrosis9 or ischemic colitis may occur.10-12
In this case, the patient complained of abdominal pain after 
treatment with terlipressin. Abdominal cramping is commonly reported as an adverse event of terlipressin, but most cases are mild 
and transient.13 However, in this case, pain was severe and continued after discontinuation of terlipressin. In this situation, there 
were possibilities of acute mesenteric ischemia and bowel perforation, so a CT scan was performed. On the basis of the CT findings, 
bowel necrosis with pneumatosis intestinalis was diagnosed, and 
mesenteric thromboembolism or bowel perforation were excluded. 
There are many conditions associated with pneumatosis intestinalis including pulmonary, autoimmune, infectious, iatrogenic, drug 
induced, compromised immune state, gastrointestinal, or vascular 
disease.14 In this case, the patient had no other systemic disease 
except recent administration of terlipressin. And, ascitic fluid analysis and culture showed no evidence of intra-abdominal infection. 
Therefore, we concluded that pneumatosis intestinalis developed 
due to mesenteric ischemia induced by terlipressin. The finding of 
bowel necrosis with pneumatosis intestinalis seemed to be irreversible. So, we decided to perform a bowel resection. 
There are three cases that have reported intestinal ischemia afFigure 3. Pathologic findings of the resected bowel. Grossly, the mesentery exhibited ischemic changes and the mucosa of the inner layer 
exhibited atrophy and black pigmentation (A), necrosis and hemorrhagic that were evident microscopically were compatible with ischemic colitis 
(B) (H&E stain).

ter treatment of terlipressin for variceal bleeding,10-12 but those 
cases were unrelated to HRS. Also, the Terlipressin and Albumin 
for Hepatorenal Syndrome Study (TAHRS) trial, which compared 
the efficacy of terlipressin plus albumin and albumin alone and 
administered 1-2 mg of terlipressin every 4 hours, reported three 
cases of suspicious intestinal ischemia during terlipressin therapy 
for HRS.15 However, those cases were only suspicious events and 
there was no explanation on outcomes. An important finding in 
this case is that bowel ischemia developed after administration of 
two doses of terlipressin (total of 2 mg) and progressed after its 
discontinuation: The patient received bowel resection eventually. 
Therefore, this is the first case of severe intestinal ischemia that 
presented with abdominal pain at regular dose of terlipressin in 
HRS and progressed to severe bowel necrosis confirmed by pathology after surgery.
Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is the result of splanchnic vasoconstriction occurring in response to a variety of systemic insults 
that diminishes mesenteric blood flow. These include decreased 
cardiac output (pump failure or arrhythmias), hypovolemia, hypotension (shock, sepsis), rapid digitalization or reaction to vasopressors. Early diagnosis by CT or angiography is the key to the successful management of such patients.16 Underlying causative 
factors should be corrected urgently, when mesenteric ischemia is 
diagnosed. Vasodilator therapy may be helpful, and papaverine 
and prostaglandin are the vasodilators most commonly used. 
However, referring patients for laparotomy and bowel resection 
should be considered when there is no response to medical therapy and bowel necrosis is suspected.17
In conclusion, although most of the abdominal pain due to use 
of terlipressin is mild and resolves after discontinuation of administration, it may develop as an irreversible bowel ischemic necrosis, 
as exemplified by the current case. Therefore, possible serious 
complications should be kept in mind and terlipressin needs to be 
used with caution.
