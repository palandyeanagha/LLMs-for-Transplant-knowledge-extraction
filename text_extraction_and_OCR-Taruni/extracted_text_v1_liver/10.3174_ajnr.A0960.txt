BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is known to
occur after solid organ transplantation (SOT), potentially associated with cyclosporine and tacrolimus.
In this study, we assess the frequency and clinical and imaging characteristics of PRES after SOT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 27 patients (13 men and 14 women; age range, 22–72
years) who developed PRES after SOT. Features noted included SOT subtype, incidence and timing of
PRES, infection and rejection, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and toxicity brain edema.
RESULTS: PRES developed in 21 (0.49%) of 4222 patients who underwent transplantation within the
study period (no significant difference among SOT subtypes). Transplantation was performed in 5
patients before the study period, and 1 patient underwent transplantation elsewhere. In consideration
of all 27 patients, PRES typically developed in the first 2 months in patients who had SOT of the liver
(9 of 10 patients) and was associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV), mild rejection, or systemic bacterial
infection. PRES also typically developed after 1 year in patients who had SOT of the kidney (8 of 9
patients) and was associated with moderate rejection or bacterial infection. Toxicity MAP was significantly lower (P  .001) in liver transplants (average MAP, 104.8  16 mm Hg) compared with that in
kidney transplants (average MAP, 143  20 mm Hg). Toxicity brain edema was significantly greater (P
 .001) in patients who had liver transplants and developed PRES compared with patients who had
undergone kidney transplants despite severe hypertension in those who had the kidney transplants.
CONCLUSION: Patients who had undergone SOTs have a similar low incidence of developing PRES.
Differences between those who have had liver and kidney transplants included time after transplant,
toxicity MAP, and PRES vasogenic edema noted at presentation. In patients who have undergone
kidney transplants, severely elevated MAP was associated with reduced, not greater, brain edema.
Neurotoxicity with the development of the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) imaging pattern is most typically noted in solid organ transplantation
(SOT), allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT),
and eclampsia.1-17 PRES is also seen in association with infection, sepsis, shock, autoimmune disease, and after chemotherapy.18-27 Patients develop headache, visual disturbance, or altered mentation, which often progress to seizure.28 Severe
hypertension is commonly present, but patients may be normotensive (20% to 30%).3,29,30
On CT or MR imaging, vasogenic edema is typically
present in the occipital and parietal regions but also in the
frontal lobes (in particular, along the superior frontal sulcus),
inferior temporo-occipital junction, and cerebellar hemispheres.1,3,18,19,31 Involvement of the deep white matter
(WM), basal ganglia, and brain stem is also seen, with areas of
restricted diffusion and focal hemorrhage occasionally
noted.4,6,31
Although many case reports have described PRES or cyclosporine and tacrolimus neurotoxicity in SOT, to our knowledge, a comprehensive assessment has not been performed.
The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the
incidence of PRES after SOT along with the clinical and imaging features of PRES neurotoxicity in a large population of
patients who have undergone SOT.
Methods
We searched the radiology report data base at our institution from
January 1, 1998, through August 31, 2006, for any patients in whom
PRES was demonstrated on brain CT and MR imaging reports associated with SOTs. In addition, the adult SOT data base cited 4222
SOTs performed during the same study period, and we assessed
records of any patients who developed neurologic dysfunction and
had either brain CT or MR imaging studies for evaluation. We obtained approval from our institutional review board for this retrospective study.
Brain CT and MR imaging studies were reviewed in the identified
patients for features consistent with the characteristics of cyclosporine and tacrolimus neurotoxicity or PRES, and cases were included by
consensus agreement between 2 experienced neuroradiologists. Criteria for confirmation of PRES included complete or partial expression of the typical PRES pattern, reversibility on follow-up imaging,
vasogenic edema as demonstrated by MR diffusion imaging, and a
presentation consistent with clinical neurotoxicity. Twenty-seven patients were identified who developed PRES after SOT, and these patients are the focus of this report.
The clinical inpatient and outpatient records of these 27 patients
were comprehensively reviewed. We paid specific attention to identify clinical features including cyclosporine and tacrolimus levels,
bacterial infection, evolving viral infection or reactivation (ie, cytomegalovirus [CMV]) and organ rejection. We sought baseline/toxicity blood pressures and calculated mean arterial pressure (MAP; 2/3
diastolic pressure 1/3 systolic pressure) at toxicity.

Imaging Evaluation
CT studies were obtained with 5-mm section thickness through the
posterior fossa along with 5 to 10-mm section thickness through the
supratentorial hemispheres. When used, contrast material consisted
of 150 mL of intravenous iothalamate meglumine (Conray 60;
Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, Mo) or iohexol 300 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis).
MR imaging, where obtained, was performed at 1.5T and included
sagittal and axial T1-weighted images (TR, 600 msec; TE, min; section
thickness, 5 mm; number of acquisitions, 1) and spin-echo or fast
spin-echo axial proton density (TR, 2000-2500 msec; TE, min; section
thickness, 5 mm; number of acquisitions, 1) and T2-weighted images
(TR, 2000-2500 msec; TE, 84-102 msec; section thickness, 5 mm;
number of acquisitions, 1). Contrast enhanced T1-weighted images
were obtained with 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium dimeglumine (Magnavist; Berlex Laboratories, Wayne, NJ) or gadopentatate (Prohance;
Braco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ) using typical T1-weighted parameters as described above. Fluid attenuation inversion-recovery
(FLAIR) images (TR, 9000-10000 msec; TE, 149 msec; TI, 2200 msec)
and diffusion weighted imaging (single shot echoplanar; TR, 10000
msec; TE, min; section thickness, 5 mm; matrix, 128) sequences were
also available in most patients.
Imaging Assessment and Edema Grading
The imaging features seen in cyclosporine and tacrolimus neurotoxicity,
eclampsia, and PRES have been described previously.2-7,16,18,19,31CT and
MR imaging studies were assessed by 2 experienced neuroradiologists
with locations of imaging abnormality (vasogenic edema, restricted
diffusion, enhancement) itemized and tabulated by consensus agreement. Specific regions of vasogenic edema were tabulated separately
including the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes; cerebellum; brain stem; basal ganglia; and deepWM (ie, external and internal
capsule, corona radiata).
Imaging studies were independently graded by 2 neuroradiologists for extent and severity of hemispheric cortex and WM edema
(grade summary: 1, limited cortex/WM edema; 2, WMcortex
edema with some deep WM extension; 3, WMcortex edema with
limited ventricle surface extension; 4, WMcortex edema, diffuse,
widely confluent, extensive ventricle contact; 5, severe WMcortex
edema, diffuse confluence, ventricle deformity) as previously
described.18
The depth of vasogenic edema and cortical scope in PRES are
generally observed to track in parallel, particularly as separate regions
become confluent. Vasogenic edema grade was based on the most
severely involved region of the visualized hemispheric PRES pattern.
This was most typically the parietal or occipital lobes, or both (“posterior” brain). Grade judgment was therefore primarily based on the
depth of edema in the maximum involved region and secondarily on
medial and lateral scope, confluence, or anterior extension. A singlegrade value was generated by each observer based on impression of
maximum edema extent. In asymmetric or aberrant PRES, the most
extensively involved region was used for grading. Graders were
blinded to the patient’s blood pressure and transplant subtype, and
differences in edema grade were resolved by consensus.
Transplantation Management
Graft rejection control was managed with tacrolimus and cyclosporine (historical maintenance morning trough blood levels of 20 and
400 ng/mL, respectively; currently 10 and 200 ng/mL). Patients
who had undergone liver transplantation typically received approximately 30% lower dosing because of their intrinsic disease-related
immune-suppressed status. All recipients received prophylactic antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral treatment for at least 6 months, and
all infections were treated aggressively.
Statistical Assessment
Statistical significance was evaluated with the software package SAS
release 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Parametric comparisons of
blood pressure and brain edema grade, respectively, between liver and
kidney transplant subsets was performed with the Student t test and
Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric comparisons. Comparison of
PRES incidence between SOT subtypes was performed with the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between toxicity blood pressures and edema grades. Statistical
significance was considered to exist for P  .05.
Results
Twenty-seven patients who developed PRES after SOT were
identified. The results are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and in the
on-line Table. Thirteen of 27 patients were men and 14 womene with an average age of 48 years (range, 22–72 years).
Twenty-one patients underwent transplantation during the
study period (January 1, 1998 to August 31, 2006) with 5 patients having a transplant before January 1, 1998. One additional patient developed PRES after having a second liver
transplant at another institution. A total of 4222 SOTs were
performed at our institution during the study period.
Clinical presentation at toxicity included isolated seizure (7
patients) or a combination of headache, confusion, altered
mentation, or vision change alone (8 patients) or with progression to generalized seizure (12 patients). Blood pressure at
toxicity was normal in 8 patients (MAP  105 mm Hg), mildly
elevated in 6 (MAP, 106 –115 mm Hg), and severely elevated
in 13 (MAP  116 mm Hg).
MR imaging was available in 25 of 27 patients, with CT
imaging only in 2. Lesion distribution included the parietal
lobe in 27 of 27, occipital lobe in 22 of 27, frontal lobe in 22 of
27, temporal lobe in 7 of 27, cerebellum in 11 of 27, basal
ganglia in 5 of 27 [thalamus in 5; caudate nucleus in 1], deep
WM in 6, corpus callosum in 1, and brain stem in 2.
Overall Neurotoxicity with PRES After SOT (Table 1)
Neurotoxicity with PRES was identified in 21 (0.49%) of the
4222 patients after SOT performed during the study period
(January 1, 1998 to August 31, 2006). Individual organ-specific incidence of PRES is summarized in Table 1. Minor variTable 1: Incidence of PRES developing after transplantation

ation in PRES incidence was noted between SOT subtypes
(range, 0.34% [Kidney/Kidney-Pancreas] to 0.84% [Small
Bowel]), but differences were not statistically significant.
Differences Among SOT Organ Groups (Table 2 and Online Table)
Although the incidence of PRES was similar among SOT subtypes, several particularly striking differences were present between liver and kidney transplants, with other SOT subtypes
being intermediate.
Time of PRES Occurrence
Time of PRES occurrence was markedly different between
liver and kidney transplants (Table 2 and on-line Table). After
liver transplantation, neurotoxicity and PRES occurred immediately after transplantation in 9 patients (11–68 days; average, 31 days) with 1 patient developing PRES at 173 days in
the face of significant and ongoing sepsis. In contrast, 8 patients with kidney transplants developed PRES many years after transplantation (14 –120 months; average, 53 months)
with only 1 patient developing PRES earlier (236 days) after
kidney-pancreas transplant in the face of severe sepsis and
rejection. Onset of neurotoxicity and PRES after transplant in
other SOTs was intermediate and variable.
Blood Pressure
Average blood pressure at neurotoxicity was lower in patients
with liver transplantation (average MAP, 104.8  16 mm Hg
[range, 86 –132 mm Hg]) but markedly elevated in patients
who had undergone kidney transplantation (average MAP,
143  20 mm Hg [range, 117–177 mm Hg]), and this difference was statistically significant (t test; P  .001; Mann-Whitney test; P  .002; if we exclude the 2 renal transplants with CT
scans only: t test; P  .002; Mann Whitney test; P  .005).
Vasogenic Edema Grade
Extent of brain edema graded at presentation was also markedly different between patients who had undergone liver
transplantation and those who had had a kidney transplant.
Brain edema was greater in patients who had undergone liver
transplantation (average edema grade, 3  .8; Fig 1) and lower
in those who had undergone kidney transplantation (average
edema grade, 1.55  .5; Fig 2) and developed PRES, and this
difference was statistically significant (t test; P  .001; MannWhitney test; P  .002; if we exclude the 2 renal transplants
with CT scans only: t test; P  .001; Mann-Whitney test; P 
.002).
Of particular interest, average edema grade in patients who
had kidney transplantation with PRES was significantly lower
despite the markedly elevated blood pressures encountered at
toxicity. The correlation (coefficient, P value) between toxicity
blood pressure and brain edema grade included 1) entire study
group (.35, P  .07), 2) liver only (.18, P  .63), and 3)
kidney only (.06, P  .87).
Clinical Features at Toxicity
Patients who had undergone liver transplantation typically developed PRES in the immediate or early period after transplantation with significant bacterial infection (7 patients,
blood culture results positive: 6 gram-positive Staphylococcus,
Enterococcus, 1 gram-negative Pseudomonas) and biopsy-positive organ rejection (4 patients) noted (on-line Table). Newonset CMV expression during or after neurotoxicity and PRES

orthotopic liver transplant for cholangitis and cirrhosis with blood pressure at toxicity of
140/76 mm Hg. Mild organ rejection was being treated with increased immune suppression
(trough tacrolimus level minimally elevated: 21 ng/mL), and intercurrent blood culture
results were positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. MR imaging (FLAIR sequence)
obtained at toxicity demonstrates cortex and deep WM vasogenic edema in the occipital
region bilaterally (open arrows) judged Edema grade 3. Follow-up MR imaging 1 month
later demonstrated complete resolution of the vasogenic edema.

was noted in 7 of 10 patients with liver transplants, representing reactivation (6 patients) or new-onset infection (1
patient).
In patients who had undergone kidney/kidney-pancreas
transplantation (8 cadaveric,1 living donor), PRES was typically seen in association with sporadic late but severe infection
(6 patients: kidney abscess/hemorrhage, lung abscess/empyema, pneumonia, sepsis [Streptococcus. Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Moraxella], and CMV colitis) and biopsy-positive organ rejection (6 patients) noted (on-line Table). PRES was also
seen in association with dialysis fistula inflammation and infection (1 patient) and narcotic or cocaine use (1 patient). One
patient developed PRES 8 months after transplantation in association with severe rejection and sepsis.
In a similar fashion, patients with other organ transplants
typically developed PRES in the setting of infection or organ
rejection (on-line Table).
At presentation, immunosuppression was within the normal range in 23 patients (tacrolimus) and minimally elevated
in 4 (3 liver transplants, tacrolimus; 1 heart transplant,
cyclosporine).
Discussion
Neurotoxicity with development of PRES occurs in association with transplantation (SOT and allo-BMT; cyclosporine
or tacrolimus toxicity), eclampsia, high-dose chemotherapy,
and autoimmune disease.3-6,9-17,19,22-27,32 Severe infection,
sepsis, and shock may also represent important associations.18
Although blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus tend not
to correlate with PRES, medication withdrawal often results in
alleviation of toxicity.33,34
The cause of neurotoxicity with PRES remains controversial. From a historical persective, hypertension with failed autoregulation and hyperperfusion has been suggested as the
cause of the developing vasogenic edema. Alternatively, vasospasm has been demonstrated (catheter or MR angiography:
delayed eclampsia, allo-BMT, chemotherapy, infection, sepsis, and shock), brain hypoperfusion has been demonstrated
(Tc99m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon
emission CT; MR perfusion), and the imaging appearance
likely reflects a watershed distribution of vasogenic edema.2,14,35-41 In addition, hypertension is not present in approximately 20% to 30% of patients who develop PRES with
eclampsia.3,29,30
Our data demonstrate several important features related to
PRES in SOT including 1) a low incidence of PRES in SOT in
particular when compared with allo-BMT; 2) a similar incidence of PRES among the different SOT subtypes; 3) marked
difference in several features of PRES between liver and kidney
transplants including time point of onset, extent of brain
edema, and blood pressure at presentation; 4) high frequency
of bacterial infection, CMV expression, and organ rejection in
the peripresentation period. These features may further expand our understanding of the causes of PRES.
Incidence of PRES in SOT
In our patients who had undergone SOT, the incidence of
PRES was 0.49% and appears similar among SOT subtypes.
This parallels several previous reports of neurotoxicity after
liver and kidney transplantation (PRES incidence, 0.4% to
0.5%).8,42,43 In our renal transplant population, PRES was primarily encountered 1 year or more after surgery, which suggests a delayed, time-dependent incidence (overall, 0.35%;
rate, 0.044% per year). Older reports or studies covering a
previous era of transplantation have suggested a higher incidence of PRES after SOT (2.7% to 4%) and an earlier occurrence of PRES after renal transplant.8,17,44-46 Our study covers
a more recent period, and current refined posttransplant management (minimized maintenance immunosuppression, bacterial and viral infection control, immunosuppression blood
levels and early toxicity recognition) may account for these
differences.
The incidence of PRES after SOT was significantly lower
than the reported incidence of cyclosporine neurotoxicity after allo-BMT (5% to 8%), with several important factors potentially accounting for the differences.32,47,48 In allo-BMT,
conditioning regimens (marrow ablative chemotherapy, total
body irradiation) are used to eliminate host marrow, which
may induce endothelial or tissue injury with production of
inflammatory cytokines.32,49,50 Graft versus host disease
(GVHD) is likely a more systemic and aggressive immunereactive process than organ rejection, and the dose of immunosuppression (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) is typically
greater in patients undergoing allo-BMT (GVHD control)
than in those undergoing SOT.51,52 In addition, the combined
result of marrow ablation and higher-dose immunosuppression renders the patient with allo-BMT significantly more susceptible to infection posttransplantation to the point of requiring isolation.53
Fig 2. Patient 21 is a 59-year-old woman who developed altered mental status, loss of
consciousness, and severe hypertension (220/100 mm Hg) 17 months after cadaveric renal
transplant for hypertension-related chronic renal failure. She was being managed for mild
organ rejection just before toxicity. MR imaging (FLAIR sequence) obtained at toxicity
demonstrates primarily cortical vasogenic edema in the occipital poles bilaterally (open
arrows) judged Edema grade 1. Follow-up MR imaging 3 days later demonstrated resolution
of the vasogenic edema.

Transplant Differences: Kidney Versus Liver Transplants
Although the incidence of PRES among SOT subtypes was
similar, striking clinical differences were present (ie, time of
onset, blood pressure at presentation, brain vasogenic edema)
in particular between patients who had undergone liver transplantation and those who had undergone kidney transplantation. Several factors related to the clinical and surgical challenges of transplantation may be responsible for these
differences.
Clinical Differences
Patients who have undergone kidney transplantation are generally healthier than those undergoing liver transplantation
(organ failure addressed with dialysis until appropriately
matched donor identified), and the transplant procedure is
technically easier (extraperitoneal iliac fossa approach; discharged within 3–7 days).54,55 Problems after transplantation
typically develop late after the actual kidney transplant procedure, and these problems are primarily related to episodes of
infection or rejection.56 Progressive organ rejection involves
CD4 T-cell activation to transplant endothelium (including
tumor necrosis factors- and , interferon-, and interleukin-1 cytokine expression) along with progressive cytotoxic
CD8 T-cell activation with direct endothelial or tissue injury.57
The inflammatory response to the graft leads to leukocyte trafficking (T-cells, macrophages, other leukocytes) and endothelial adhesion molecule activation promoting leukocyte interaction and organ hypoperfusion. B-cell activation or antibody
production can also occur. This chronic allograft nephropathy
inflammatory process results in the organ and stromal injury
that constitute the effects of rejection observed on histologic
examination.57
Long-standing host exposure to transplant endothelium
might “preactivate” T-cell populations (including memory Tcells) and host endothelium that may subsequently react more
vigorously in the face of an added immunologic challenge
(through antigen presenting cell costimulation) such as bacterial/viral infection or increasing transplant rejection.57-60
Liver transplantation is performed on the basis of clinical
need (sickest patients first).61 Patients are intrinsically immunocompromised with low albumin, hepatic failure, and an
underlying coagulopathy (intrinsic platelet dysfunction,
platelet consumption [splenomegaly], and inadequate coagulation factors).61-63 The surgical procedure is technically complex with a mandatory “no-turning-back” point (major vessels clamped, bypass established, recipient liver removed),
significant blood and fluid shifts, and intrinsic
coagulopathy.64
The immediate period after liver transplantation (0 –3
months) is challenging, with a high risk for infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) and cardiovascular instability (hypotension: exaggerated venous capacitance [varices], low albumin,
operative blood and fluid loss) and intrinsic immunosuppression.65 Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome is common.65 Of
interest, the native liver, through hepatic vagal afferents and
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, functions to detect
low levels of circulating bacteria (endotoxin).60,66,67 Resultant
production of cortisol and vagal efferent signal intensity diminish production of macrophage tumor necrosis factor (limiting the systemic inflammatory response to infection) and
attenuate endotoxin-induced hypotension.60,66,67 In the denervated orthotopic liver transplant, hepatic vagal afferents
are not present.
The transplanted liver also contains a significant number of
mobile immunologically active cells (T-cells, macrophages,
and stem cells) that exit the donor liver in the first 45 days after
transplantation, interacting with the recipient, similar to an
allo-BMT, or establishing permanent residence within the
host (potential “microchimerism”).68 Early development of
PRES after liver transplantation (first 2 months) parallels the
early development phase of PRES in the first month after alloBMT and could reflect similar mechanisms (GVHD,
infection).32
The development of neurotoxicity with PRES early after
liver transplant may be related to features of this complex and
unstable posttransplantation state. Expression of CMV (reactivation) likely reflects the immune-challenged condition or
effects of intercurrent sepsis. Once stable, patients with liver
transplants tend to remain so for long periods after transplantation, likely related to better overall immune adaptation.68
Brain Edema and Hypertension
In our study population, liver transplant recipients developed
substantial brain edema at presentation (average grade, 3  .8)
with, on average, normal blood pressures (average MAP,
104.6  16 mm Hg). In stark contrast, patients who had undergone kidney transplantation had significantly less brain
edema at presentation (average grade, 1.55  .5), despite
acute-onset severe hypertension (average MAP, 143  20 mm
Hg), and the differences between these 2 groups of patients are
statistically significant (P  .005). CT and MR imaging studies
were used to compute the vasogenic edema grade for renal
transplants because of the limited number of patients available, but results remain significant even when retabulated
without the CT studies included. The correlation between toxicity edema and blood pressure, though not statistically significant, was negative for the entire SOT dataset (.35), liver
transplants (.18), and kidney transplants (.06). If acute,
severe hypertension were the cause of PRES, one would expect
the opposite observation (ie, greater vasogenic edema in patients with renal transplants in whom severe hypertension develops—positive correlation). Reduced edema has been reported in patients with severe hypertension and infection,
sepsis, or shock who develop neurotoxicity or PRES.18 Our
observations between patients with liver transplants and those
with kidney transplants parallel this finding, but the relationship seems to be even more dramatic.
The observed differences in PRES neurotoxicity noted between our patients with liver transplants and those with kidney transplants (brain edema, toxicity blood pressure, and
timing of toxicity occurrence) are most likely related to the
substantial perioperative or posttransplant clinical differences, or both, between these 2 groups. Progressive rejection
in patients undergoing kidney transplantation is related to an
ongoing immune response to the organ (CD4/CD8 T-cell activation, tissue inflammation or injury, cytokines, B-cell activation) balanced by immunosuppression.57 Significant challenge to the immune system could lead to an augmented
response in the face of T-cell preactivation, in particular, if
challenged by a superantigen (ie, infection with gram-positive
928 Bartynski  AJNR 29  May 2008  www.ajnr.org

organisms), which can stimulate 5% to 20% of T-cells.59,60
The resulting systemic inflammatory response (endothelial
adhesion or white cell trafficking) could lead to organ hypoperfusion with vasospasm or hypertension as an intrinsic reactive response (platelets: thromboxane; cytokines: endothelin) or a reactive response designed to improve perfusion.57,60
The developing hypertension could therefore be protective
(Cushing-like) and responsible for the reduced brain edema,
as observed.
Why hypertension does not routinely accompany PRES or
neurotoxicity after liver transplantation is unclear, but this is
an important question. The clinical features surrounding or
following liver transplantation (hepatic failure, immune suppression, cardiovascular challenge, immune challenge from
the transplanted organ, opportunistic infection, low oncotic
pressure) may lead to a postoperative state similar to that of
multiorgan dysfunction syndrome or sepsis with resultant intravascular inflammatory changes, organ hypoperfusion, and
sustained hypotension with a compromised vasoconstrictive
response. Platelet dysfunction or consumption could reduce
thromboxane-mediated vasoconstriction. Altered hepatic vagal afferent response to infection could diminish the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal–mediated pressor response, sustaining lower systemic perfusion and facilitating the process that
leads to PRES or neurotoxicity.60,66,67
Given the above-described inverse relationship of toxicity
vasogenic edema and blood pressure between liver and kidney
SOTs, implications for patient care might include earlier identification of PRES in patients with normotensive blood pressure and confirmation of toxicity brain perfusion to guide
management.
Conclusion
The overall incidence of PRES after SOT is low, with a similar
incidence among SOT subtypes. Statistically significant differences between SOT groups at presentation included the following: 1) PRES developed early in patients who had undergone liver transplantation, and these patients had generally
normotensive blood pressure and greater brain vasogenic edema; and 2) PRES developed late in patients who had undergone kidney transplantation, and these patients had severe hypertension at presentation but had much less brain vasogenic
edema. These differences in PRES, with an inverse relationship
between toxicity blood pressure and observed vasogenic
edema, are likely related to the many clinical differences between liver and kidney transplantation.
