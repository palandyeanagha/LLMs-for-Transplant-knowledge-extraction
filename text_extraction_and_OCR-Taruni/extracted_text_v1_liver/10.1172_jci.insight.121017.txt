Introduction
Since its introduction in 1951, radiation exposure followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has 
become a key technique for both medical practice and biomedical research (1). Indeed, this procedure has 
been used in over 100,000 basic science papers, and stem cell transplantation has been used to treat over a 
million patients (2). Although it has greatly improved the survival rates for multiple malignancies, exposure 
to levels of radiation necessary to deplete the bone marrow have long-term side effects, including a profound 
increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, pediatric cancer patients, who are often treated with radiotherapy or BMT, are 7 times more likely to die from a cardiovascular complication, making CVD the leading 
cause of nonmalignant death in these patients (3). Further, women treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer 
have a dose-dependent increase in CVD risk, which was shown to be independent of traditional risk factors 
(4). This has motivated extensive research on the cardiovascular effects of radiation in mouse models of 
atherosclerosis. Consistent with the clinical data, multiple studies have shown that lethal irradiation results 
in decreased indices of atherosclerotic lesion stability, including reduced collagen content, increased macrophage marker staining, and increased intraplaque hemorrhage (5–7). However, there is a high level of unexplained variability in the literature as to the effect of radiation exposure on different vascular beds. For example, lesion size has been shown to increase in the aortic sinus yet decrease in the aortic arch (6). Although 
there are many possible causes for this heterogeneity, we hypothesize that it is due in part to differences in the 
sensitivity of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to radiation in different vascular beds.
A critical role for SMCs in atherosclerosis has become increasingly clear, due in large part to the development of rigorous SMC lineage tracing and simultaneous conditional gene knockout studies in long-term 
Western diet–fed (WD-fed) Apoe–/– mice (8–10). Briefly, studies have shown that lesion SMCs are derived 
from a subset of mature Myh11+ medial SMCs that clonally expand to populate the lesion (11–13). Further, >80% of the SMCs within atherosclerotic lesions lack expression of characteristic SMC markers, and, 
The long-term adverse effects of radiotherapy on cardiovascular disease are well documented. 
However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increased risk are poorly understood. 
Previous studies using rigorous smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage tracing have shown abundant 
SMC investment into atherosclerotic lesions, where SMCs contribute to the formation of a 
protective fibrous cap. Studies herein tested whether radiation impairs protective adaptive SMC 
responses during vascular disease. To do this, we exposed SMC lineage tracing (Myh11-ERT2Cre 
YFP+
) mice to lethal radiation (1,200 cGy) followed by bone marrow transplantation prior to 
atherosclerosis development or vessel injury. Surprisingly, following irradiation, we observed a 
complete loss of SMC investment in 100% of brachiocephalic artery (BCA), carotid artery, and aortic 
arch lesions. Importantly, this was associated with a decrease in multiple indices of atherosclerotic 
lesion stability within the BCA. Interestingly, we observed anatomic heterogeneity, as SMCs 
accumulated normally into lesions of the aortic root and abdominal aorta, suggesting that SMC 
sensitivity to lethal irradiation occurs in blood vessels of neural crest origin. Taken together, these 
results reveal an undefined and unintended variable in previous studies using lethal irradiation and 
may help explain why patients exposed to radiation have increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

of these, nearly 50% have activated markers of macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells, or myofibroblasts 
and, thus, would have been missed or misidentified in previous studies (9). Moreover, SMC-specific knockout studies have shown that SMCs can have key beneficial or detrimental effects on lesion pathogenesis, 
depending on the nature of their phenotypic transitions (8–10, 14). For example, Klf4-dependent transitions, including formation of SMC-derived macrophage marker+ foam cells (9) exacerbated lesion pathogenesis, while Oct4-dependent transitions (10) were protective, including being critical for investment of 
SMCs into the fibrous cap. The studies herein examine the effects of lethal irradiation on the contribution 
of SMCs to atherosclerosis lesion pathology and surgically induced neointima formation.
Results
To determine the effect of lethal gamma radiation on SMC during atherosclerosis, we injected SMC lineage tracing Myh11-ERT2Cre ROSA-STOP-eYFP Apoe–/– (SMC-YFP, Apoe–/–) mice with tamoxifen from 
6–8 weeks of age (Figure 1A). Mice were then exposed to whole-body lethal radiation (1,200 cGy) using 
a cesium-137 irradiator, with subsequent BMT at 9 weeks of age, followed by 6 weeks of rest to allow for 
bone marrow engraftment. Nonirradiated non-BMT littermates were used as controls. We placed mice on 
WD for 18 weeks to induce atherogenesis (Figure 1B). Flow cytometric analyses of blood at the time of 
harvest showed >95% bone marrow engraftment (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available 
online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.121017DS1). Vessels were harvested and analyzed for indices of lesion stability and cellular composition. Of major significance, we found that SMCs 
failed to accumulate in any of the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) lesions (Figure 1E) from lethally irradiated 
mice, as assessed by YFP staining at multiple locations along the length of the BCA (Figure 2, B and C). In 
contrast, in the control mice, >85% of the BCA lesions had YFP+ SMC accumulation, consistent with the 
hundreds of SMC-YFP, Apoe–/– mice previously analyzed in our lab and others (Figure 2, A and C) (8–10, 
12, 14). Furthermore, to assess the functional consequences of SMC loss in the BCA, we found that BCA 
lesions from irradiated mice exhibited decreases in multiple indices of lesion stability, including significant 
increases in intraplaque hemorrhage (P = 0.0003) and necrotic core area (P = 0.0082) and a significant 
reduction in collagen content (P = 0.0186, Figure 2, D–F). However, despite reductions in multiple indices 
of lesion stability, we found that vessel morphology, including external elastic lamina and lesion area, was 
not significantly changed (Figure 2, G and H). Importantly, these observations were consistent despite 
using multiple bone marrow donor lines including from CD45.1, tdTomato, or dsRed mice (see Methods, 
Figure 1B). Taken together, radiation induces loss of SMC accumulation and results in detrimental effects 
on multiple indices of lesion stability within BCA lesions, highlighting an unexpected and highly significant side effect of lethal irradiation.
To determine if other vascular beds exhibited a similar loss of SMC accumulation, we examined multiple vascular locations, including the aortic arch, aortic root (Figure 1E), and abdominal, renal, and iliac 
arteries. Similar to our observations in the BCA, lesions in the aortic arch of all irradiated animals lacked 
SMC accumulation (Figure 3, A, B, and G). However, all other vascular beds showed similar SMC accumulation in both the irradiated and control mice, including in the aortic root (Figure 3, C, D, and H) and 
the abdominal aorta (Figure 3, E, F, and I) and renal and iliac arteries, suggesting that the SMCs of aortic 
arch and BCA are uniquely sensitive to radiation. Of interest, SMCs from these two sites, unlike any of the 
other vascular sites tested, are derived from the neural crest (NC) (15).
To determine if ionizing radiation has a direct effect on the vascular SMCs that could explain their 
absence in BCA lesions, we harvested vessels from mice at 1, 4, and 7 days after irradiation and BMT and 
from age-matched nonirradiated controls (Figure 1C). Of major interest, lethal irradiation resulted in significantly increased YFP+TUNEL+ cells in the BCA vessel media at 1 and 4 days after irradiation, which 
decreased to the level of controls by 7 days (Figure 4, A and B). Surprisingly, increased YFP+TUNEL+ staining was not observed in the aortic root or coronary or pulmonary vessels (Figure 4, C–E), suggesting that the 
medial Myh11+ SMCs from various vascular beds have different susceptibilities to radiation-induced DNA 
double-strand breaks. In the BCA media, the increased YFP+TUNEL+ staining was not associated with a 
decrease in the number of YFP+ cells (Figure 4F). To determine if the double-strand DNA breaks were associated with increased SMC apoptosis, we assessed the percentage of YFP+ cleaved caspase-3+ cells in the BCA 
and found >1% apoptotic SMCs at day 1 and 4 (Figure 4G), suggesting that the vast majority of TUNEL+
SMCs did not undergo subsequent apoptosis. At the time of radiation exposure, we injected mice with a 
single pulse of BrdU to assess SMC proliferation directly after radiation. Consistent with the literature, we

RESEARCH ARTICLE
found that very few medial SMCs proliferate in the absence of vascular injury, and, even after irradiation, 
the maximum percentage of proliferating YFP+ cells was <2% (Figure 4H), which was confirmed by Ki67 
staining. Thus, SMCs within the BCA appear to be uniquely susceptible to γ radiation, as demonstrated by 
increased TUNEL staining, which suggests that part of the effect of lethal irradiation-induced loss of SMC 
accumulation in lesions is intrinsic to SMCs in this vascular bed.
To determine if the loss of YFP+ SMC accumulation was unique to atherosclerosis, we performed carotid 
ligation and femoral injury, two models of surgically induced vascular injury, on Myh11-ERT2Cre, ROSA26 
STOP-flox eYFP+/+ mice with and without Apoe knockout (SMC-YFP) following irradiation and BMT. 
Consistent with results in the BCA and aortic arch, we observed a profound reduction in SMC investment 
into neointimal lesions resulting from carotid ligation (Figure 1, D and E, and Figure 5). Indeed, none of 
the irradiated mice demonstrated SMC investment into the neointima (Figure 5, B and C), whereas 90% of 
the control mice had significant YFP+ SMC investment (Figure 5, A and C). However, SMC accumulation 
in the neointima induced by femoral injury showed SMC accumulation, regardless of radiation exposure. 
These data are consistent with our results in atherosclerosis, indicating that radiation has different effects on 
SMC accumulation in different vascular beds. Moreover, these additional models indicate that the observed 
results were not a function of the mouse age, diet, type of vascular insult, BMT donor, or hyperlipidemia.

Discussion
Taken together, the present study reveals that an unintended and highly unexpected consequence of lethal 
irradiation is a profound impairment of SMC accumulation in vascular lesions that form in the BCA, aortic arch, and carotid artery. It is interesting to speculate based on the vascular patterning of these effects 
that they are due to differences in the embryologic origin of the SMCs. Indeed, fate-mapping studies have 
revealed that SMCs develop from at least 8 unique embryologic origins and that this appears to affect the 
behavior of the mature SMCs (15). For example, TGF-β stimulation of NC-derived cultured SMCs results 
in increased DNA synthesis, while mesoderm-derived SMCs show the opposite response (16–18). Loss of 
SMC accumulation in vascular lesions is highly consistent with vessels where SMCs are derived from the 
NC. This is perhaps best illustrated by the profound effect of whole-body γ radiation in the aortic arch but 
lack of effect in the adjacent aortic root.
Although studies provide compelling evidence that investment of NC-derived SMCs within lesions is lost 
following lethal irradiation, results do not distinguish if this is driven by direct intrinsic effects of radiation on 
SMCs themselves or through secondary effects on other cell types, tissues, or the lesion microenvironment.

The fact that we only observed this phenotype in NC-derived vascular beds, despite using whole-body radiation, suggests that the local environment plays a critical role. However, the underlying mechanisms are likely 
to be highly complex. For example, radiation-induced damage to local endothelial cells could inhibit the 
expression of factors required to stimulate SMC investment or induce secretion of factors that inhibit investment into lesions (19). It is also possible that functional changes in the engrafted hematopoietic stem cells that 
seed the bone marrow niche following BMT selectively affect SMCs or that radiation may affect one or more 
of the other NC-derived cell populations shown to play a critical role in the remodeling of the branchial arch 
vessels during vascular development (20).
Our observations of increased YFP+TUNEL+ cells selectively in the BCA suggest that radiation is 
directly and/or selectively affecting the Myh11+ medial SMC population and preventing SMCs from 
accumulating within lesions. However, further study is required to determine if there are other contributing factors from circulating cells or the local environment. If radiation was directly targeting the 
NC-derived SMCs, this would appear to be inconsistent with the widely accepted dogma that radiation 
primarily affects highly proliferative and poorly differentiated cells (21). Indeed, SMCs are known to 
have a very low proliferation rate within mature blood vessels (~0.1%) (22, 23) and are therefore considered one of the most radioresistant cell types. However, several recent studies (12, 13), using multicolor 
SMC clonal analysis, have shown that SMCs in BCA and carotid lesions are derived from oligoclonal 
expansion of a small number of medial SMCs. Thus, it is possible that a subpopulation of medial 
Myh11+ SMCs in NC-derived vascular beds are poised to undergo clonal expansion, and perhaps these 
cells are susceptible to radiotherapy. Interestingly, SMCs located at the tip of muscularized pulmonary 
arterioles, which are also NC derived (24), have been shown to be primed to clonally expand following 
hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (25). Perhaps there is a similar subpopulation among the 
aortic SMCs. Consistent with this idea, a recent study (26) has shown that a subset of differentiated 
SMCs (using Myh11-ERT2Cre) express the mouse stem cell marker Sca1. It is interesting to speculate

that the subpopulation of primed Myh11-derived SMCs may be uniquely sensitive to radiation due to 
their increased plasticity, which would presumably be associated with a more open chromatin state that 
may increase their susceptibility to radiation-induced DNA damage independent of proliferation status. 
However, it will be extremely difficult to directly test this possibility, given that Sca1 is expressed by 
many cell types other than SMCs. As such, studies would require development of a sequential dual-recombinase lineage tracing mouse that allows selective lineage tracing of the subset of Myh11-expressing 
SMCs that subsequently activate Sca1.
An alternative possibility is that radiation may induce terminal differentiation of a proliferation-competent subset of medial SMCs exclusively in NC-derived vascular beds. This idea is supported 
by a previous study showing that radiation-induced coat graying, which is normally maintained by a 
NC-derived melanocyte stem cell population, was due to radiation-induced terminal differentiation of 
the stem cell population (27). To extrapolate from these studies, perhaps the SMC population primed 
to oligoclonally expand is terminally differentiated following radiation, impairing the ability of SMCs

to populate BCA, carotid, and aortic arch lesions. However, the appropriate dual-lineage tracing mouse 
model systems required to test this hypothesis are also not currently available.
We believe that the results of these studies are of great interest to multiple fields of basic and clinical biology. However, the preceding points make it clear that many intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms 
may be responsible for radiation selectively abrogating the ability of SMCs in the BCA, carotid artery, 
and aortic arch to invest into lesions. Thus, extensive further studies will be necessary to elucidate the 
underlying mechanisms for these effects, understand the possible implications of our results for clinical 
medicine, and interpret the findings of the more than 100,000 previous publications that have employed 
BMT as a primary experimental approach.
Methods
Animal handling and tissue processing
Bone marrow transplant studies. Studies were performed on male Myh11-CreERT2, ROSA26 STOP-flox 
eYFP+/+ littermates backcrossed 9 times to C57BL/6 (8). Males were used, as the Myh11-CreERT2 transgene is located on the Y chromosome. Mice used for atherosclerosis studies (Figure 1A) were crossed to an 
Apoe–/– background (SMC-YFP, Apoe–/–), whereas carotid ligation studies were performed on both Apoe–/–
and Apoe+/+ mice (SMC-YFP). Cre-lox–mediated recombination of eYFP was induced in 6- to 8-week-old 
mice after intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg tamoxifen (T-5648, MilliporeSigma) per mouse per day for 10 
days over 2 weeks. At 9 weeks of age, mice underwent lethal irradiation, receiving two 600-cGy doses, 3 
hours apart, using a cesium-137 irradiator (Mark 1-68a; JL Shepard and Associates) and bone marrow was 
reconstituted 30–60 minutes later with >1 × 106
 unfractionated bone marrow cells via tail vein injection, as 
previously described (28). 1,200 cGy was chosen as the dosage for lethal radiation in mice based on multiple previous reports. Bone marrow was harvested from the femurs and tibias from donors aged 4–7 weeks.
After BMT, mice were given antibiotics via drinking water (Sulfa water: 80 mg/ml sulfamethoxazole, 16 
mg/ml trimethoprim, Teva Pharmaceuticals) for 6–7 weeks during bone marrow reconstitution before either 
being placed on WD to induce atherosclerosis development (Harlan Teklad, 21% milk fat, 0.15% cholesterol)

or undergoing carotid ligation (Figure 1, B and D). Alternatively, mice were harvested 1, 4, or 7 days after irradiation and BMT and given a single BrdU pulse at the time of radiation (10 mg/ml; MilliporeSigma, B5002; 
lot HMBF4669V), as were their corresponding nonirradiated, non-BMT control littermates (Figure 1C). On 
the day of harvest, and 12 hours after fasting (atherosclerosis only), mice were euthanized by CO2
 asphyxiation. Blood was drawn for testing prior to perfusion fixation via the left ventricle with 4% paraformaldehyde 
(PFA; EMS 15710) as previously described (8). To test hyperlipidemia, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels were analyzed by the University of Virginia Clinical Pathology Laboratory.
Bone marrow donor mice. Bone marrow for atherosclerosis studies and the studies on the acute 
effects of radiation was as follows: CD45.1 Apoe–/–, tdTomato Apoe–/–, or dsRed Apoe–/– derived from 
Tg(CAG-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J (Jackson Laboratory, 005441). Bone marrow for mice in carotid ligation 
studies used marker tdTomato Apoe+/+ derived from B6.129(Cg)-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo/J (Jackson Laboratory, 007676) or CD45.1 Apoe–/– derived from B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ 
(Jackson Laboratory, 002014), when appropriate. Bone marrow was harvested from donors between 4 and 7 
weeks of age from the femur and tibia, and >1 × 106
 unfractionated bone marrow cells were injected via tail 
vein 30–60 minutes after radiation.
Validating bone marrow reconstitution. Blood samples were acquired by terminal cardiac puncture. Red 
blood cells and platelets were cleared using 1× RBC lysis buffer (BD PharmLyse, 555899) and 1× Hanks 
Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco, 14185). Prior to surface staining, Fc receptors were blocked with TruStain 
fcX anti-mouse CD16/32 antibody (Biolegend, 101320; 10 μg/ml). Dead cells were eliminated from the 
analysis using Live-Dead Fixable Yellow (Thermo Fisher, L34959; 0.55 μl/ml). Cells were stained with the 
following antibodies: CD45.1 (BD Pharmingen, clone A20; 2.5 μg/ml) and CD45.2 (eBiosciences, clone 
104; 2.5 μg/ml). OneComp ebeads (eBiosciences, 01-1111-42; 50 μl/sample) were used for single-stain 
controls, and all experiments used fluorescent minus one controls for each marker. All samples were run on 
a Beckman Coulter CyAn ADP LX flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo v10.
Atherosclerosis experimental design. SMC-YFP, Apoe–/– mice for atherosclerosis studies were irradiated 
at 9 weeks of age with Sulfa water/bone marrow reconstitution for 6 weeks. Experiments were repeated 3 times, with mice (n = 8; 1,200 cGy, n = 7 control) receiving bone marrow from dsRed Apoe–/–, 
tdTomato Apoe–/–, or CD45.1 Apoe–/– donors. Mice were then placed on WD for 18 weeks. Littermate 
controls either received Sulfa water or normal drinking water for the same duration as experimental 
animals prior to WD feeding. There were no significant differences in control animals that received 
normal drinking water or Sulfa water. Studies used various bone marrow donors to rule out donor- or 
trace-dependent effects on atherosclerosis.
Various locations along the aortic tree that reliably develop lesions, including the BCA, aortic arch, aortic root, abdominal aorta, renal artery, and iliac artery just below the iliac bifurcation, were then excised, 
post-fixed in 4% PFA, and embedded in paraffin or put in a sucrose gradient and embedded in OCT (9). 
Given the recent finding that the ascending aorta is derived from both NC and secondary heart field, the 
aortic arch sections were taken between the BCA bifurcation and the left subclavian (Figure 1E) (29). All 
vessels were sectioned at 10 μm. The BCA samples were sectioned as previously described, starting past the 
aortic arch, which allows for lesion analysis at regular intervals. All other samples were sectioned entirely 
to include areas with lesion deposition (8).
Carotid ligation and femoral injury experimental design. Two groups of SMC-YFP (Apoe+/+ or Apoe–/–) 
mice underwent carotid ligation or femoral injury surgery, adapted from methods previously described 
(30–32). Briefly, mice that had undergone irradiation and BMT reconstitution or controls were put 
under anesthesia using the Kent Scientific SomnoSuite Isofluorane delivery system (3% v/wt, 250 ml/
min). Once mice were anesthetized, 100 μl bupivacaine HCl (0.25% NDC 55150-167-10) was administered locally. Carotid ligations were performed by making a midline incision, and the left (n = 5 control, 
n = 5 irradiated) or right (n = 5 control, n = 5 irradiated) carotid artery was exposed. A 7-0 suture was 
placed immediately proximal to the internal/external carotid bifurcation. To induce femoral injury, a 
straight spring wire was inserted into the left femoral artery. The wire was advanced and retracted in a 
sawing motion 10 times to denude the endothelium and produce neointimal hyperplasia. The collateral 
artery immediately proximal to the deep femoral artery was also ligated to induce neointima formation 
of lesser severity. The contralateral carotid or femoral artery served as an uninjured control. Mice were 
euthanized 21 days after ligation, and the arteries were excised, post-fixed in 4% PFA, and embedded in 
paraffin. Vessels were sectioned at 10 μm from ligation through the first 1.5–2.5 mm for analysis.

Immunohistochemical analysis
Staining protocols. Paraffin-embedded samples were deparaffinized prior to antigen retrieval (Vector Laboratories, H-3300) and staining. Immunofluorescence staining of vessel sections was performed as previously described (8) to evaluate protein expression in single cells (based on DAPI+ nuclei) with primary 
antibodies specific for GFP (Abcam, ab6673; 1:250), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, 9661S; 1:75), 
MKi67 (Abcam, ab15580; 1:250), or IgG as an internal negative control. TUNEL staining was performed using the CF 640R TUNEL Assay Apoptosis Detection Kit (Biotium, 30074; lot 180417). Cells 
were counter stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, D3571). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence included the following: donkey anti-goat AF-488 (Invitrogen, A11055; 1:250), donkey 
anti-rabbit AF-555 (Invitrogen, A31572; 1:250), donkey anti-goat AF-647 (Invitrogen, A21447; 1:250).
Vessel and lesion morphometry analysis was performed using Modified Russel-Movat (Movat) staining at 3 locations along the BCA to assess vessel and lesion areas. To assess intraplaque hemorrhage at 3 
locations along the BCA, red blood cells were visualized with Ter119 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., 1:200), and biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector, BA-4001, 1:200) and visualized with 
3′,3-diaminobenzidine (Acros Organic) as previously described (10). To assess collagen at two locations 
along the BCA, Picrosirius red was used for visualization of mature collagen fibrils by birefringence under 
polarized light (10). Necrotic core analyses were assessed based on the bright-field images from Picrosirius 
red staining and were performed by two investigators independently.
Image acquisition and analysis. Immunofluorescence imaging of vessel sections was performed using a 
Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. Figure images were acquired at 2,048 × 2,048 resolution using a ×20 
magnification at 0.5 zoom. A series of 1 μm Z-stack images were acquired for single-cell detection within 
the lesion or media. Figure images are orthogonal projections of Z-stacks, with background fluorescence 
decreased (background fluorescence was considered if unassociated with DAPI+ nucleus) in both experimental and control animals and were performed using Zen Light Edition Software (Zeiss). Figure images 
were pseudo-colored and YFP signal was brightened with gamma expansion for visualization in print, and 
scale bars were added in Adobe Photoshop.
Movat- and Ter119-stained images were acquired with a Zeiss Axioskope2 fitted with an AxioCamMR3 camera, using AxioVision40 V4.6.3.0 software (Carl Zeiss Imaging Solution). Settings were standardized for each staining protocol and used for the entirety of image acquisition. Picrosirius red images were 
taken using an Olympus BX51 under a polarized lens. Vessel morphometry and areas of positive immunohistochemical or Picrosirius red staining within defined areas of interest were quantified using ImagePro 
Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.).
Genotyping primers
The following primers were used: eYFP, GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG, AAGTTCATCTGCACCACCG, TCCTTGAAGAAGATGGTGCG, and CGTGATCTGCAACTCCAGTC; Myh11-Cre, 
TGACCCCATCTCTTCACTCC, AACTCCACGACCACCTCATC, and AGTCCCTCACATCCTCAGGTT; Apoe, GCCTAGCCGAGGGAGAGCCG, TGTGACTTGGGAGCTCTGCAGC, and GCCGCCCCGACTGCATCT; tdTomato, AAGGGAGCTGCAGTGGAGTA, CGGGCCATTTACCGTAAGTTAT, and CCGAAAATCTGTGGGAAGTC; CD45.1, CTCACAGGCACATGAACGAT and 
CGCTTCAAGCATGTCTTCTG; and dsRed, CCCATGGTCTTCTTCTGCAT, AAGGTGTACGTGAAGCACCC, CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT, and GTAGGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC.
Statistics
Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism software v7. SMC investment into lesions and intraplaque 
hemorrhage were analyzed by 2-sided Baptista-Pike Fisher exact test, with odds ratio and 95% confidence 
interval. Vessel morphometry, necrotic core, and Picrosirius red images were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons and Bonferroni correction. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. All P values 
reflect significant differences between control and experimental groups, and numbers of animal are shown 
within figures. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval
Animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the 
University of Virginia.
