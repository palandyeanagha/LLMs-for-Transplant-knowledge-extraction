ABSTRACT
Introduction: Management of post-transplant
diabetes mellitus is challenging; there is a lack
of prospective randomized controlled trials for
safety and efficacy of antidiabetic medications
in solid organ recipients. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are a relatively new class of medications used to manage
type 2 diabetes in the general population. They
have several benefits besides glycemic control,
including weight loss and improved cardiovascular risk. However, they have not been studied
extensively in the post-transplant population
for safety and efficacy.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study
of patients who had received kidney, liver, or
heart transplant, had diabetes either pre- or
post-transplant, and were treated with GLP1RA. We identified seven kidney, seven liver,
and five heart transplant recipients who had
received GLP-1RA. We assessed changes in
immunosuppressant levels, rejection episodes,
changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight,
and body mass index (BMI) while on the GLP1RA. We also looked at changes in insulin dose,
other diabetes medications, heart rate, blood
pressure, and renal function.
Results: After a mean follow-up period of
12 months, there were no significant changes in
tacrolimus (FK506) levels and renal function for
the period of GLP-1RA use. At the end of
12 months, the mean drop in weight was
4.86 kg [95% CI - 7.79, - 1.93]. The BMI
decreased by a mean of 1.63 kg/m2 at the end of
12 months [95% CI - 2.53, - 0.73]. HbA1c
decreased from baseline by 1.08% [95% CI
- 1.65, - 0.51], 0.96% [95% CI - 1.68, - 0.25],
and 0.75% [95% CI - 1.55, 0.05] at 3, 6, and
12 months, respectively.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that GLP-1RA do
not affect tacrolimus levels or transplant outcomes in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients
in the short term. GLP-1RA also seem to be as
effective in SOT recipients for glycemic control
and weight loss as in the non-transplant population with diabetes.

INTRODUCTION
Diabetes is one of the most significant comorbid
conditions after solid organ transplantation. It
is associated with long-term adverse effects in
transplant recipients. Transplant patients may
have pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) or develop diabetes after transplantation. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM)
is associated with reduced graft survival and
increases cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality in kidney, heart, and liver
transplant recipients [1, 2]. Similarly, pre-existing diabetes increases the risk for graft loss and
decreases survival in solid organ transplant
(SOT) recipients [3, 4].
Management of diabetes after transplant
poses specific barriers, such as potential interactions of antidiabetic medications with
immunosuppressant medications as well as
reduced renal function. In addition, fluid
retention, weight gain, lactic acidosis, delayed
gastric emptying, and negative effects on bone
mass are all potential adverse effects that can
affect the health of the transplant recipient.
Insulin is commonly used for the management of diabetes in transplant recipients, starting immediately post-operation when patients
are usually on higher doses of steroids [5]. Later,
when the patients are on a more stable dose of
steroids, other medications that are commonly
used in the non-transplant population can be
potentially used. However, options for non-insulin medications are limited because of several
factors [1]. Metformin poses a risk of lactic acidosis and cannot be used if renal function is
reduced. Pioglitazone poses a risk of fluid
retention and can worsen bone mineral density.
Previous research has shown the safety and
efficacy of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors in this population [6]. However, the efficacy of DPP4 inhibitors in glycemic control is
limited and, in many situations, patients need a
second agent.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists
(GLP-1RA) are a relatively new class of diabetes
medication that are commonly used for the
management of T2DM in the non-transplant
population. Besides glycemic control, they also
have other potential advantages, such as weight
loss and improved cardiovascular risk [7]. GLP1RA also carry a lower risk of hypoglycemia
because they induce insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. They can be used in
patients with reduced renal function, and
because GLP-1RA have weight-lowering benefits, they may be particularly useful to counteract the weight gain that typically occurs posttransplant. Furthermore, the reduction in
HbA1c with GLP-1RA ranges from 0.8% to 2%
[8].
GLP-1RA are eliminated by proteolytic
degradation. Therefore, their metabolism does
not involve CYP- or transporter-mediated
drug–drug interactions [9]. Hence, they are
theoretically safe because the chances of
988 Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:987–994

interaction with immunosuppressant medications are low. GLP-1RA are an attractive option
for management of post-transplant diabetes,
although only a small number of studies evaluated GLP-1RA for this condition [10–13].
In a study with 12 kidney transplant recipients and 12 controls, GLP-1RA infusion lowered
fasting plasma glucose, reduced glucagon concentration, and increased first- and secondphase insulin secretion during a hyperglycemic
clamp [13]. In another small study, five patients
who were treated with liraglutide post kidney
transplant had improvement in glycemic control, weight, and had no adverse effects on graft
renal function after a mean follow-up of
19 months [10].
GLP-1RA delay gastric emptying and thus
can affect the absorption of immunosuppressant medications [14]. Data on the safety of
GLP-1RA in the post-transplant population is
also limited. In a small case series of five
patients, co-administration of liraglutide with
tacrolimus post kidney transplant did not clinically affect the trough tacrolimus levels [11].
We hypothesized that GLP-1RA are safe and
effective in the management of diabetes after
transplantation.
METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed kidney, heart, or
liver transplantation recipients at the University
of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) who had
either pre-existing T2DM or developed PTDM
and were subsequently treated with any of the
available GLP-1RA: exenatide, liraglutide,
dulaglutide, or semaglutide. Inclusion criteria
were previous heart, kidney, or liver transplant,
history of T2DM or PTDM, and use of any of the
aforementioned GLP-1RA post transplantation.
Exclusion criteria were age less than 19 years,
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and GLP-1RA
use for less than 3 months.
The providers started their patients on a
titrated GLP-1RA dose per the recommended
protocol. Some patients did not reach the
maximum dose. Baselines values were defined
as the last measured values at, or within
1 month prior to, the time of starting GLP-1RA.
Measurements taken included tacrolimus
(FK506) levels, estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR), weight, body mass index (BMI),
total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein
(LDL), heart rate (HR), and liver function tests
(LFT). The changes in these parameters were
evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months compared to
baseline values using a paired t test. We also
looked at all graft rejection episodes and mortality. Results are reported as mean difference
(e.g., 3-month value - baseline value) with a
95% confidence interval of the difference.
Descriptive statistics (counts, percentages,
means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges) were used to summarize the data.
Three patients had known thyroid nodules.
One patient had a previous thyroidectomy and
pathology was benign, another patient had a
benign biopsy, and the last patient had a biopsy
but the results of that biopsy were not available.
Two patients had ultrasounds without nodules
reported. All other patients had a normal thyroid on physical exam and had no history of
thyroid nodules/neoplasms.
The study was approved by UNMC Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol # 806-18-EP.
Exemption to consent was approved by the IRB,
since there was no or minimal risk to subjects
because of the retrospective nature of the study.
The study conformed with the Helsinki declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013, concerning
human and animal rights.
RESULTS
We identified 19 patients who fulfilled the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Sixteen
patients had T2DM pre-transplant and three
patients had PTDM. Baseline characteristics are
listed in Table 1.
The most common reason for kidney transplant was end-stage kidney disease due to
hypertensive nephrosclerosis followed by diabetic nephropathy. Four patients had received a
cadaveric transplant and three had received a
living donor kidney. The most common reason
for heart transplant was ischemic cardiomyopathy. Tacrolimus was used for immunosuppression in 18 out of 19 patients. Only one
Diabetes Ther (2020) 11:987–994 989

patient in our cohort was on cyclosporine. All
heart and kidney transplant recipients were on
mycophenolate, except for two kidney recipients because of BK viremia or BK virus-associated nephropathy. One of the liver transplant
patients was on sirolimus. Five out of seven
kidney transplant recipients were on maintenance steroids. One of the liver transplant
recipients was on 1 mg of prednisone for
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), otherwise
all other liver and heart transplant recipients
were not receiving steroids.
For management of diabetes, 17 patients
were on insulin, out of which 15 were on
basal–bolus regimen, one was on basal insulin
only, and one was on prandial insulin only.
Sixteen patients were on insulin analogues
(glargine, lispro, and aspart) and one patient
was on human insulin-U500 concentration.
Five patients were on insulin in combination
with oral medications. The mean total daily
dose (TDD) of insulin at baseline was
77.11 units. At baseline, two patients were on
oral medications only for diabetes management. Metformin and DPP4i were the most
commonly used oral medications, followed by
sulfonylurea and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). The most commonly used GLP-1RA was liraglutide (ten
patients), followed by dulaglutide (five
patients), and exenatide and semaglutide (two
patients each). GLP-1RA were started after a
median of 60 months after transplant.
FK506 levels did not show any significant
change from baseline throughout the study
period. There was no unexpected dose change
of immunosuppressant medications during the
study period. There was no significant change
in renal function measured as eGFR during the
12 months of follow-up. There were no significant changes in LFTs. All safety endpoints are
listed in Table 2. There was one episode of
rejection and mortality—a heart transplant
recipient had acute rejection at 3 months after
starting GLP-1RA, had multi-organ failure, and
died. The authors are not able to decide if the
rejection episode is related to GLP-1RA or not.
Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints
are listed in Table 3. There was a statistically
significant decrease in the mean weight and
BMI between baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months.
At the end of 12 months, there was mean drop
in weight by 4.86 kg [95% CI - 7.79, - 1.93]
and BMI decreased by a mean of 1.63 kg/m2
[95% CI - 2.53, - 0.73]. HbA1c decreased from
baseline by 1.08% [95% CI - 1.65, - 0.51],
0.96% [95% CI - 1.68, - 0.25], and 0.75% [95%
CI - 1.55, 0.05] at 3, 6, and 12 months,
respectively. The mean TDD of insulin

decreased from baseline by 12.06 units,
14.27 units, and 16.25 units at 3, 6, and
12 months, respectively. More than half the
patients (57%) were able to decrease insulin
requirements 1 year after starting GLP-1RA.
Figure 1 shows the spaghetti plot of individual
variables for all subjects at different time points.
Two patients who were on combination of
insulin and oral medications stopped oral
medications after starting GLP-1RA. The use of
oral medications decreased from 37% to 15%.
Overall, 57% of patients were able to decrease
the number of oral medications.
The most reported side effect was nausea in
five patients. Three patients stopped the medication because of gastrointestinal (GI)-related
adverse effects and two stopped because of cost
(not covered by insurance or high co-pay).
There were no reported incidents of severe
hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, or malignancy,
including thyroid cancers, during the follow-up
period. There was a tendency towards an
increase in heart rate, which was only statistically significant at 3 months. Heart rate
increased by 6.6 bpm at 3 months and increased
by 3.6 bpm at 12 months, but the increase at
12 months was not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
In SOT recipients, the choice of medication to
treat comorbid conditions is significantly
dependent on the interactions of drugs with
immunosuppressants and other potential
adverse effects that compromise the graft function. GLP-1RA can potentially slow gastric
emptying and delay absorption. All subjects in
our study were followed by our renal, cardiac,
and liver transplant teams and had complete
data on safety measures of FK506 levels, rejection episodes, medication changes, renal function, transaminases, and adverse effects. There
were no differences in FK506 levels while on

GLP-1RA in our cohort. Our results are similar
to those of Pinelli et al. [11], who reported a
small case series of five patients that received
co-administration of liraglutide with tacrolimus
post kidney transplant; liraglutide did not clinically affect the trough tacrolimus levels. Singh
et al. [12] also reported in their study of
dulaglutide in SOT recipients that the
immunosuppressant regimen remained
stable without any increased dose adjustment.
This is in contrast to the Liou et al. [10] study of
five patients on liraglutide after kidney transplant, who reported that three patients could
reduce the dose of tacrolimus and maintain
optimal therapeutic levels. Renal function was
also not affected in our cohort during the GLP1RA use. The most common side effect to GLP1RA reported in our study was nausea, which is
commonly reported in the population of nontransplant patients who also take this class of
medication. There were no other serious adverse
effects noted in our study.
Our data shows that GLP-1RA improved
glycemic control, with improvements in HbA1c
(- 0.75%) and decreases in total daily dose of
insulin (16.25 units) 12 months from baseline
in SOT recipients. The number of oral medications decreased with GLP-1RA initiation, similar
to results reported by Singh et al. [12]. We saw
reductions in weight and BMI in our cohort by a
mean of 4.86 kg and 1.63 kg/m2
, respectively, at
the end of 12 months. Our results in weight and
BMI reduction are higher than what has been
previously reported by Singh et al.; however,
this may be because the baseline BMI in our
cohort was higher than the cohort in Singh
et al.

The important difference in our study compared to earlier studies mentioned is that our
cohort was on different GLP-1RA and not a
particular agent, e.g., either dulaglutide or
liraglutide. Our cohort also included an almost
equal number of kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients.
The current study was retrospective and thus
there was no control group. In addition, the
baseline values are single measurements prior to
start of GLP-1RA, which may not reflect the true
status prior to GLP-1RA start. Our cohort size is
small and included three different organ transplant recipients and consequently different
immunosuppressive regimens. This could have
resulted in different effects on glucose metabolism. However, our cohort was on a stable immunosuppressive regimen and GLP-1RA was
started after a mean of 60 months after the
transplant. Therefore, these effects would have
stayed the same or changed only minimally
from before to after starting the GLP-1RA. Our
study is unique as it is the first study to report
on the use of multiple GLP-1RA in the transplant population.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study adds to the growing body of literature
that the currently available GLP-1RA can be
used for the management of post-transplant
diabetes without affecting tacrolimus levels or
transplant outcomes. Furthermore, SOT recipients taking GLP-1RA can expect similar glycemic and weight reduction effects as in the
non-transplant population with diabetes.
