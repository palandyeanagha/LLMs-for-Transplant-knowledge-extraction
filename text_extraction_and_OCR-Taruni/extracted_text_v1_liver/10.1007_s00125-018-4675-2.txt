Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The EFFECT-II study aimed to investigate the effects of dapagliflozin and omega-3 (n-3) carboxylic acids (OM3CA), individually or combined, on liver fat content in individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
Methods This randomised placebo-controlled double-blind parallel-group study was performed at five clinical research centres at
university hospitals in Sweden. 84 participants with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four treatments
by a centralised randomisation system, and all participants as well as investigators and staff involved in the study conduct and
analyses were blinded to treatments. Each group received oral doses of one of the following: 10 mg dapagliflozin (n = 21), 4 g OM3CA (n = 20), a combination of both (n = 22) or placebo (n = 21). The primary endpoint was liver fat content assessed by MRI
(proton density fat fraction [PDFF]) and, in addition, total liver volume and markers of glucose and lipid metabolism as well as of
hepatocyte injury and oxidative stress were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment (completion of the trial).
Results Participants had a mean age of 65.5 years (SD 5.9), BMI 31.2 kg/m2 (3.5) and liver PDFF 18% (9.3). All active treatments
significantly reduced liver PDFF from baseline, relative changes: OM-3CA, −15%; dapagliflozin, −13%; OM-3CA +
dapagliflozin, −21%. Only the combination treatment reduced liver PDFF (p = 0.046) and total liver fat volume (relative change,
−24%, p = 0.037) in comparison with placebo. There was an interaction between the PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism and change in
liver PDFF in the active treatment groups (p = 0.03). Dapagliflozin monotherapy, but not the combination with OM-3CA, reduced
the levels of hepatocyte injury biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase
(γ-GT), cytokeratin (CK) 18-M30 and CK 18-M65 and plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Changes in γ-GT correlated
with changes in liver PDFF (ρ = 0.53, p = 0.02). Dapagliflozin alone and in combination with OM-3CA improved glucose control
and reduced body weight and abdominal fat volumes. Fatty acid oxidative stress biomarkers were not affected by treatments. There
were no new or unexpected adverse events compared with previous studies with these treatments.
Conclusions/interpretation Combined treatment with dapagliflozin and OM-3CA significantly reduced liver fat content.
Dapagliflozin monotherapy reduced all measured hepatocyte injury biomarkers and FGF21, suggesting a disease-modifying
effect in NAFLD.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as increased liver fat levels >5.5% and is associated with obesity,
type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular
disease [1, 2]. The prevalence of NAFLD in individuals with
type 2 diabetes is approximately 75% [1, 2]. Based on histological classification from liver biopsies, NAFLD can be
classified as either non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the more aggressive form. Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk
of developing NASH, and the disease has a more severe prognosis [1, 2]. The mechanisms responsible for progression from
NAFL to NASH may involve lipotoxicity, oxidative stress,
endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
[3, 4]. Moreover, there are common genetic variants predisposing to both NAFL and NASH, including the well-documented
I148M variant of the patatin-like phospholipase domaincontaining protein 3 (PNPLA3) gene [5]. Currently, there are
no approved drugs for treatment of NASH, and the recommended treatment consists of weight loss and exercise [2, 3].
Dapagliflozin is a sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
SGLT2is increase urinary glucose excretion and reduce
HbA1c, body weight, body fat and blood pressure [6, 7].
SGLT2is can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular events
and death when added to standard of care [8–10]. To date,
there are no completed placebo-controlled studies of the effects of SGLT2is on liver fat and hepatocyte injury biomarkers
in individuals with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, but some
results suggest positive effects [11–13].
Omega-3 (n-3) carboxylic acids (OM-3CA) are a complex
mixture of NEFA, a new chemical entity based on the premise
that n-3 fatty acids in the free acid form have comparatively
1924 Diabetologia (2018) 61:1923–1934

greater bioavailability than the prodrug ethyl ester or triacylglycerol forms [14]. A meta-analysis has shown that n-3 fatty
acid treatment of NAFLD can lead to a reduction in liver fat
content in the absence of weight loss [15]. In most studies, n-3
fatty acid supplementation had no significant effects on NASH
histology [16–18], but high doses of n-3 fatty acids in combination with weight reduction improved liver histology compared with weight loss alone [19]. Overall, no effects of n-3
fatty acid treatment on glucose control in individuals with type
2 diabetes have been found [20]. Fatty acid oxidation and basal
metabolic rate are increased by n-3 fatty acids, which could
explain the reduced liver fat content without associated weight
reduction [21]. In addition, n-3 fatty acid treatment has been
shown to reduce total fat mass and adipocyte diameter [22],
which is associated with reduced fatty acid release and inflammation, as well as improved insulin sensitivity [23].
The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with a combination of OM-3CA and
dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, on liver proton density fat fraction (PDFF) measured by MRI of the whole
liver in individuals with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. The
secondary aim was to evaluate the relative efficacy of treatment with the combination of OM-3CA and dapagliflozin
vs monotherapy with OM-3CA or dapagliflozin on reduction in liver PDFF. The effects of these treatments on glucose control, fatty acid metabolism, oxidative stress and
hepatocyte injury biomarkers were also studied.
Methods
Study design
The EFFECT-II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02279407) was a 12 week multicentre randomised
placebo-controlled double-blind double-dummy four-armed
parallel-group trial performed at five clinical research centres
at university hospitals in Sweden. The first participant was
enrolled on 20 January 2015, and the last patient visit was
on 11 December 2015. The study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Review Board in Uppsala, registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov and conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on
Harmonisation of Good Clinical Practice. All participants
provided written informed consent before participating.
Participants
Individuals with type 2 diabetes, aged 40–75 years, were eligible if they had been treated with a stable dose of metformin
or sulfonylurea alone or in combination for at least 3 months,
and if they had a PDFF >5.5% (as measured by MRI), which
is commonly used as a cut-off for NAFLD [2], and a BMI of
25–40 kg/m2
. Exclusion criteria included the use of SGLT2is,
n-3 fatty acids, insulin or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor
agonists, a history of hepatic disease, creatinine clearance
<60 ml/min (Cockcroft–Gault), inability to undergo MRI
scanning and a significant alcohol intake (>14 drinks per
week). Complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed
in the electronic supplementary material (ESM) Methods.
Intervention
Participants who were eligible according to the inclusion
and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to
treatments by a centralised system, which provided a
randomisation code delivered by an external call centre.
They received either once-daily dapagliflozin 10 mg (Tablet
Forxiga 10 mg, AstraZeneca, Södertälje, Sweden), OM-3CA
4 g (Capsule Epanova 1 g, AstraZeneca), a combination of
dapagliflozin 10 mg and OM-3CA 4 g, or matching placebos.
All participants as well as investigators and staff involved in
the study conduct or analyses were blinded to treatments. The
NEFA content of OM-3CA capsules is given in the ESM
Methods. The study flow chart is shown in ESM Fig. 1. The
randomisation schedule was stratified by baseline liver PDFF
at two levels: ≤8% or > 8%.
Outcome measures
Blood analyses Detailed descriptions of examinations and
analyses are available in the ESM Methods. Analyses were
performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. In
brief, glucose, NEFA, cholesterol, triacylglycerols, βhydroxybutyrate and uric acid were determined with enzymatic colorimetric assays. HbA1c was determined with ionexchange high-performance liquid chromatography. Insulin,
C-peptide, apolipoprotein C3, C-reactive protein, cytokeratin
(CK) 18 fragments, adiponectin, fibroblast growth factor 21
(FGF21), leptin, TNF-α and osteopontin were analysed using
immunoassays.
Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity indices Plasma samples for measurement of glucose, NEFA and insulin were taken at −15, 0, 30, 60 and 120 min during a 75 g OGTT. Adipose
tissue insulin sensitivity index was based on NEFA and insulin levels during the OGTT (ESM Methods).
Fatty acid composition of phospholipids and cholesteryl esters and total plasma levels of docosahexaenoic acid and
eicosapentaenoic acid The percentage composition of fatty
acids in phospholipids and cholesteryl esters was determined
by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection.
Desaturase activities were estimated by calculating fatty acid
product to precursor ratios in plasma cholesteryl esters and
phospholipids. Total eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
Diabetologia (2018) 61:1923–1934 1925

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (esterified and free) were measured by Covance Laboratories (Madison, WI, USA), on behalf
of AstraZeneca, using LC-MS/MS (see ESM Methods).
PNPLA3 genotyping The single nucleotide polymorphism in
the PNPLA3 gene rs738409 was determined in n = 80 participants (n = 20 in each group) who gave informed consent for
genetic testing. DNA was extracted from baseline samples of
whole blood and genotypes were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (see ESM Methods).
MRI MRI was used to quantify PDFF content, determined by
the median of the fat fraction values inside the delineated total
liver volume, and abdominal adipose tissue volumes (see
ESM Methods for details).
Oxidative stress biomarkers in plasma and urine Acylcarnitines,
4-hydroxyhexenal and 4-hydroxynonenal were analysed in
plasma and non-esterified F2 isoprostanes were measured in
urine samples using LC-MS. Creatinine was also measured in
urine using an enzymatic colorimetric assay and used for normalisation of non-esterified F2 isoprostane levels (as
described in ESM Methods).
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 20 participants per treatment group was estimated to provide ≥90% power for the primary endpoint, accounting for a dropout rate of ≤10% and assuming a relative
reduction of 30% liver PDFF for the combination of OM-3CA
and dapagliflozin compared with placebo. The SDs used in the
sample size estimates are based on the variations in change
from baseline of PDFF on the natural log scale observed with
in-house PDFF results, which are similar to the reported pooled
SD of 0.24 (log scale) [24]. For the power calculation, a common SD of 0.17 (log scale) for the active treatment groups and
0.34 (log scale) for the placebo group were used. The study was
also powered for the secondary objective involving three comparisons between the active treatment groups for liver PDFF.
With 20 participants randomised per group, and under the same
assumptions as above, the study had 80% power to reject the
two null hypotheses of equal treatment effect of the combination of dapagliflozin and OM-3CA vs dapagliflozin alone and
vs OM-3CA alone, assuming 15% relative difference.
Treatment effects were assessed using a mixed linear model
with the change from baseline on a log scale as response
variable, the logarithm of the baseline value as covariate, treatment as fixed effect and centre as random effect [log(POST) −
log(BASE) ~ log(BASE) + TRT + centre (random)], where
TRT is treatment. The resulting least-squares mean (LSM)
treatment effects on a log scale were then back-transformed
to the original scale. Herein, the results are described as the
descriptive geometric mean ratio (GMR; back-transformed
LSM estimates). The primary hypotheses were tested using
three pairwise comparisons against placebo with respect to
liver PDFF reduction using Dunnett’s multiple testing procedure. On conditional rejection of at least one of the primary
hypotheses, all remaining pairwise comparisons between the
active groups were carried out using Tukey’s method with a
familywise error rate of 5%, adjusted for three pairwise comparisons. Results are presented as change (SD) from baseline
as well as descriptive GMR with 95% CIs. Pairwise correlation analyses of changes from baseline to end of study were
undertaken using the non-parametric Spearman’s rank correlation test. Interactions between baseline variables, including
the effect of PNPLA3 genotype, baseline PDFF and treatment
on changes in liver PDFF in the active treatment groups, as
well as the effect of baseline variables on changes in hepatocyte injury biomarkers in the dapagliflozin-treated group,
were investigated using a mixed model on the log scale.
Changes in liver PDFF or in hepatocyte injury biomarkers
were used as responses. Baseline levels of these variables
and others as specified were used as explanatory covariates
and study site as a random effect covariate.
Results
Participants
Of 204 screened individuals, 114 were not eligible and six
withdrew for other reasons. The remaining 84 participants
were randomised (ESM Fig. 1) and constituted the safety
and full analysis set (Table 1). At baseline, mean liver PDFF
in all participants was 18%, HbA1c 58 mmol/mol (7.4%), Cpeptide level 0.98 nmol/l and fasting plasma glucose
9.4 mmol/l. Fewer than 10% of participants reported
diabetes-related complications. Most individuals were treated
with metformin or a sulfonylurea (82% and 18%, respectively)
alone or in combination, and 14% were drug naive. No change
in this medication occurred during the study. Participants were
randomised to four groups: placebo (n = 21), OM-3CA monotherapy (n = 20), dapagliflozin monotherapy (n = 21) and combined OM-3CA and dapagliflozin therapy (n = 22).
Compliance was high (97%) and similar in each treatment
group. In total, 75 participants (89%) completed the study
(ESM Fig. 1).
Liver fat content
Dapagliflozin and OM-3CA, on their own or in combination,
significantly reduced liver PDFF from baseline to 12 weeks
(Table 2 and Fig. 1). The combination treatment (relative
change, −21%, adjusted p < 0.05), but not dapagliflozin
(−13%) or OM-3CA (−15%) as monotherapies, significantly
lowered liver PDFF compared with placebo (−3%). Total liver
1926 Diabetologia (2018) 61:1923–1934

fat volume calculated from total liver volume and PDFF
changed similarly to liver PDFF (Table 2 and Fig. 1), suggesting that the change in PDFF was not secondary to changes in
hepatic fat-free volume.
The baseline NAFLD fibrosis score was calculated [25].
Eight participants (n = 2 in OM-3CA group, n = 4 in the
dapagliflozin group and n = 2 in the combination group)
had an NAFLD fibrosis score >0.675, indicating significant
fibrosis. The NAFLD fibrosis score did not interact significantly with the effect of treatment on liver PDFF.
The I148M genetic variant of PNPLA3 (rs738409 C>G) has
been reported to increase liver fat content and risk of developing NASH [5]. Therefore, the participants with the most common genotype C/C (n = 47) were compared with those with the
C/G (n = 30) and G/G genotypes (n = 3). The proportions of
the C/C and C/G + G/G genotypes did not differ significantly
between the treatment groups. Baseline liver PDFF was numerically lower in the C/C group (median [range]: 17.4% [8.3–
34.7%]) than in the C/G + G/G group (20.0% [6.1–48.5%];
p = 0.19). There was a significant interaction between
PNPLA3 genotype (C/C vs C/G + G/G) and treatment response
on liver PDFF across the active treatment arms (p = 0.03). In
the combination treatment group, the relative reduction in liver
PDFF was numerically larger for the C/G + G/G genotype
(relative change: −25.4% [−27.3 to −19.0%]) than for the C/
C genotype (−16.1% [−20.5 to −11.6%]), and this was significantly different (p < 0.01) from that seen with dapagliflozin
alone (C/G + G/G: 7.0% [−2.2 to 11.3%]; C/C: −22.0%
[−26.8 to −19.2%]; p < 0.01). In the OM-3CA treatment group,
the change in liver PDFF was numerically smaller for the C/G
+ G/G genotype (−12.6% [−15.9 to −4.3%]) than for the C/C
genotype (−18.6% [−20.2 to −15.6%]), but this was not significantly different from other treatment groups.
Anthropometrics and abdominal adipose tissue
volumes
Participants using dapagliflozin alone and in combination
with OM-3CA showed reduced body weight and waist
circumference, whereas those using OM-3CA alone showed
no change compared with the placebo group (Table 2).
Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue volumes
decreased in the two groups treated with dapagliflozin. There
was a significant interaction between the baseline subcutaneous
fat volume and treatment response in the active treatment arms
on liver PDFF (p = 0.017), which reached statistical significance in the group treated with both dapagliflozin and OM3CA vs the group treated with dapagliflozin alone (p = 0.006).
Glucose metabolism
In participants using dapagliflozin, HbA1c decreased from
baseline, but this effect was significant only in individuals
using dapagliflozin monotherapy when compared with the placebo group (Table 3). In participants using dapagliflozin,
fasting and 2 h plasma glucose concentrations decreased, while
OM-3CA treatment had no effect (Table 3). Fasting insulin
levels were reduced from baseline in all participants using
dapagliflozin, but the effect was not significant vs the placebo
group. Dapagliflozin treatment significantly improved the insulin sensitivity index measured using HOMA-IR, while OM3CA treatment had no effect. Plasma levels of NEFA and the
insulin sensitivity index for NEFA/lipolysis [26] were not affected by any treatment. The changes in 2 h plasma glucose and
insulin levels in the dapagliflozin monotherapy group correlated with the changes found in liver PDFF (ρ = 0.55, p = 0.02
and ρ = 0.62, p = 0.005, respectively; ESM Fig. 2).
Plasma fatty acid composition and lipoprotein levels
Concentrations of the fatty acids DHA and EPA were measured in total plasma and in the cholesteryl ester and phospholipid fractions (Table 4 and ESM Tables 1–4). DHA levels
increased by 20–40%, while EPA levels increased about threefold in the different lipid fractions in participants using OM3CA. Baseline levels of DHA or EPA did not interact significantly with the effect of treatment on liver PDFF, and there

were no significant correlations between changes in DHA or
EPA and changes in liver PDFF.
Changes in fatty acid composition in the cholesteryl ester
and phospholipid fractions are shown in ESM Tables 2 and 3.
OM-3CA treatment resulted in small and inconsistent changes
in saturated fatty acids in the cholesteryl ester and phospholipid fractions. Levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1 n7, 18:1 n-9) and several n-6 fatty acids (18:2, 18:3, 20:3)
decreased after OM-3CA treatment, while 18:3 n-3 and 20:4
n-6 levels did not change. Dapagliflozin treatment had no or
inconsistent effects on fatty acid composition in the
cholesteryl ester and phospholipid fractions (ESM Tables 2
and 3).
OM-3CA treatment increased estimated δ-5 desaturase activity and decreased δ-6 desaturase and stearoyl-CoA
desaturase-1 (SCD-1) activity indices, while dapagliflozin
treatment had no significant effect on these activities (Table 4
and ESM Table 4). The change in liver PDFF was significantly
associated with change in SCD-1 index in the dapagliflozin
group (ρ = 0.54, p = 0.02; ESM Fig. 2), but not in the other

groups. Elongase activity index (cholesteryl ester 18:0
cholesteryl ester 16:0) was not significantly influenced by treatment (data not shown). Total, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol as
well as triacylglycerol levels were not significantly changed by
any treatment vs placebo (ESM Table 5). Apolipoprotein C3
levels increased following treatment with dapagliflozin, while
no effect was seen in the OM-3CA groups.
Both dapagliflozin groups had increased β-hydroxybutyrate
levels numerically, but not significantly vs the placebo group
(ESM Table 5). No significant correlation between changes in
β-hydroxybutyrate and liver PDFF was observed. Dapagliflozin
treatment increased butyrylcarnitine levels, while there was no
effect of the combination treatment on plasma levels of the
acylcarnitines vs placebo (ESM Table 5).
Hepatocyte injury, oxidative stress and inflammation
biomarkers and adipokines
Dapagliflozin monotherapy reduced levels of all measured hepatocyte injury biomarkers, including aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT), CK 18-M30 and CK 18-M65 (Fig. 2, ESM
Table 6). There was no significant effect of the OM-3CA
monotherapy or the combination therapy on any of the hepatocyte injury biomarkers. Changes in liver PDFF correlated
significantly with changes in γ-GT (ρ = 0.53, p = 0.02), but
not with the other hepatocyte injury biomarkers in the
dapagliflozin group. Uric acid levels were significantly reduced in the dapagliflozin and combination groups, but not
with OM-3CA, compared with placebo (ESM Table 6).
Oxidative stress biomarkers related to non-enzymatic oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids were measured in plasma and
urine (ESM Table 6). The n-3 fatty acid-derived oxidative
stress biomarker 2-hydroxyhexenal was significantly increased by the OM-3CA and combination treatments. Levels
of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2-α (8-iso-PGF2-α) were numerically
lower in the OM-3CA group.
Plasma osteopontin levels increased significantly following OM-3CA + dapagliflozin, but not monotherapies, vs placebo. OM-3CA + dapagliflozin dual therapy had no significant effects on C-reactive protein, adiponectin and leptin
levels (ESM Table 7). FGF21 levels decreased significantly
in the dapagliflozin compared with the placebo group, but
OM-3CA or combination treatments had no significant effect
(ESM Table 7 and ESM Fig. 2). There was no significant
association between changes in FGF21 and changes in liver
PDFF, acylcarnitines or β-hydroxybutyrate in active treatment
groups.
Adverse events and safety
All active treatment groups had similar total percentages of
adverse event reporting (70.0–77.3%), which were higher
than in the placebo group (47.6%). There were no new or
unexpected adverse events compared with previous studies
with these treatments. More participants reported adverse
events when using dapagliflozin and OM-3CA (n = 15,
68.2%) than when using dapagliflozin monotherapy (n = 7,
33.3%), OM-3CA monotherapy (n = 8, 40%) or placebo
(n = 6, 28.6%). All adverse events were mild or moderate in
intensity, except two serious adverse events judged by investigators as unlikely to be caused by study treatments. There
were no significant changes in serum creatinine levels in any
of the treatment groups.
Discussion
This randomised controlled trial provides evidence for the
effect of SGLT2is and n-3 fatty acids on liver fat content in
individuals with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD measured as
PDFF derived from the whole liver volume. The combined

significantly reduced liver fat content in individuals with type
2 diabetes and NAFLD. Thus, the study met its primary objective and provides proof of concept for this dual therapy to
reduce liver fat in individuals with type 2 diabetes and
NAFLD. Additionally, each of the treatments as monotherapy
led to a significant liver fat reduction from baseline.
Interestingly, dapagliflozin alone reduced all hepatocyte
injury biomarkers as well as plasma levels of FGF21, suggesting reduced cell damage and improved mitochondrial function
or reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver [4, 27].
However, these effects of dapagliflozin were not seen when
combined with OM-3CA, indicating a complex relationship
between the two drugs and their effects on liver metabolism.
Dapagliflozin treatment was followed by the expected reductions in HbA1c, body weight, abdominal adipose volumes
and uric acid. These are well-established effects that are in
accordance with the mechanism of action [6, 7]. As expected,
OM-3CA had no effects on these measures [20, 21].

In this study, we measured the PDFF from the entire liver
volume excluding bile ducts and veins by semi-automated
segmentation, instead of the common region-of-interest
(ROI)-based analysis that typically uses 3–9 ROIs.
Measurement of PDFF from the entire liver volume is a novel
method expected to result in more accurate results and reduced variability. An effect of dapagliflozin on liver fat content may be explained by a negative energy balance via energy
loss in the urine together with an increase in fatty acid oxidation [28] that might be promoted by an increased glucagon/
insulin ratio [29]. Combining dapagliflozin with OM-3CA
resulted in a numerically larger reduction in PDFF, which
may be dependent on increased fatty acid oxidation and reduced fatty acid synthesis, effects of OM-3CA that are independent of weight reduction [21, 30]. We did not observe any
change in adipose insulin sensitivity index, suggesting no
change in fatty acid flux to the liver.
We found a significant interaction between the PNPLA3
I148M polymorphism and treatment effects on liver PDFF.
The influence of the C/C vs C/G + G/G genotypes appeared
to differ between the treatment groups, in particular
dapagliflozin alone vs combination therapy. Our results suggested that G allele carriers had a greater treatment response
only in the combined OM3-CA and dapagliflozin group. In
participants with the metabolic syndrome and NAFLD, the G/
G genotype was previously reported to be associated with the
largest reduction of liver fat following lifestyle intervention
[31], whereas the response to treatment with n-3 fatty acids
was lowest with this genotype [32]. Thus, future studies on
effects of SGLT2is and n-3 fatty acids on NAFLD and NASH
should include assessment of PNPLA3 genetics.
Notably, dapagliflozin monotherapy led to reduced signs of
hepatocellular injury as indicated by several biochemical
markers. It is unclear why the addition of OM-3CA prevented
this effect of dapagliflozin. One possibility is that OM-3CA
increased the transcription of transaminases via peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor α as previously shown [33].
This, however, would not explain why OM-3CA prevented
the dapagliflozin-induced reductions in γ-GT, CK 18-M30
and CK 18-M65 levels. Treatment with dapagliflozin reduced
plasma levels of FGF21, while the combination with OM3CA did not. High FGF21 levels are associated with NASH
and mitochondrial dysfunction [4, 27, 34, 35]. It is therefore
possible that reduced levels of FGF21 and hepatocyte injury
biomarkers following dapagliflozin treatment reflect reduced
metabolic stress and that OM-3CA treatment opposed these
effects.
A significant percentage of the participants in this study are
likely to have undiagnosed NASH based on their risk profile
[2], and eight participants had signs of severe fibrosis indicated by their NAFLD fibrosis score. Reduced hepatocyte injury
biomarkers suggest NASH resolution, as found in previous
intervention studies such as the FLINT study [36]. The consistent reduction in hepatocyte injury biomarkers therefore

suggests that dapagliflozin has a beneficial effect on NASH,
which may be mediated via reduced lipotoxicity and oxidative
stress, as supported by the lower liver fat content associated
with reduced γ-GT levels.
Overall, there were no obvious effects of dapagliflozin on
plasma fatty acid composition. However, changes in liver
PDFF in the dapagliflozin group were correlated with changes
in the SCD-1 index (16:1 n-7/16:0), which mostly reflects
hepatic fatty acid metabolism [24] and is associated with liver
fat content [24], NAFLD [37] and lobular inflammation [38].
Therefore, the association between changes in SCD-1 index
and liver PDFF suggests that dapagliflozin may influence
SCD-1 activity. Interestingly, OM-3CA decreased SCD-1
and δ-6 desaturase indices, but increased δ-5 desaturase index,
an apparent enzyme activity pattern that has been associated
with reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes [39]. Levels of
the major n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were decreased after
OM-3CA treatments, probably reflecting substrate competition for desaturases among n-6 and n-3 fatty acids [39].
In a situation of incomplete fatty acid oxidation, acyl
groups are exported from the mitochondria as acylcarnitines,
which can be found in the circulation [40, 41]. Notably,
butyrylcarnitine levels increased in the dapagliflozin treatment group. The mechanisms are unclear but may reflect
an increased mitochondrial flux of 4-carbon molecules and
fatty acids, as reflected by increased β-hydroxybutyrate
levels [29].
The primary objective was to compare the effect of the
combination of dapagliflozin and OM-3CA with that of placebo on liver PDFF, and the study was powered accordingly.
However, the sample size was not sufficient to evaluate each
monotherapy optimally vs other treatments.
Taken together, the results suggest that dapagliflozin or
OM-3CA alone or in combination reduce liver fat content in
overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. In
addition, the novel effects of dapagliflozin on hepatocyte injury biomarkers are promising for the prevention and treatment of NASH, but they should be considered as
hypothesis-generating findings. Future studies would ideally
include histological examination of repeated liver biopsies in
individuals with NASH, as well as long-term follow-up on
liver outcomes.
