Infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality early after liver transplantation. The 
aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to evaluate clinical utility of c-reactive protein (CRP), 
procalcitonin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in surveillance of infections early after liver 
transplantation in intensive care setting. A total of 60 liver transplant recipients were included. CRP, 
procalcitonin, and NLR assessed at 12-hour intervals were primary variables of interest. Infections and 
severe complications during postoperative intensive care unit stay were the primary and secondary 
end-points, respectively. Infections and severe complications were diagnosed in 9 and 17 patients, 
respectively. Only peak CRP beyond frst 48hours was associated with infections (p=0.038) with AUC, 
positive and negative predictive value of 0.728, 42.9% and 92.2%, respectively (cut-of: 142.7mg/L). 
Peak procalcitonin over frst 60hours was the earliest predictor (p=0.050) of severe complications 
with AUC, positive and negative predictive value of 0.640, 53.3% and 80.0%, respectively (cut-of: 
42.8ng/mL). In conclusion, while CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR cannot be used for accurate diagnosis of 
infections immediately after liver transplantation, peak CRP beyond 48hours and peak procalcitonin 
over frst 60hours may be used for initial exclusion of infections and prediction of severe complications, 
respectively.
Despite remarkable improvement of outcomes of patients afer liver transplantation over past decades, infections 
remain one of the most important threats and most common causes of death in a population of liver transplant 
recipients1–3
. In the early post-transplant period, they are the most common cause of morbidity4. Even 70% of liver 
transplant recipients develop bacterial infections, with vast majority occurring during the frst post-transplant 
month5,6
. Tese complications remain an important cause of death in the early post-transplant period with 
overall infection-related mortality rates varying between 0–30% depending on etiology, timing, and site7–10. 
Particularly high mortality rates, in the range of approximately 35–70%, are reported for patients developing 
infections with multiple drug resistant microorganisms, such as extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing 
or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae11–13. Improvements in prevention, early diagnosis and management 
of infections in the early period afer liver transplantation are thus undoubtedly necessary to further improve 
patient outcomes. Several preventive measures, such as perioperative use of probiotics or implementation of 
bundled strategies, were recently proven efective in major reduction of post-transplant burden of infections14–16. 
However, early diagnosis of infectious complications afer liver transplantation, a prerequisite for timely initiation 
of antimicrobial therapy, remains a major clinical challenge, particularly in the immediate postoperative period17.
Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) are well-established markers of systemic infammation utilized for diagnosing postoperative infectious 
episodes in a non-transplant setting, particularly afer colorectal operations18–25. Te results of these common

laboratory tests in the early period afer liver transplantation may be subject to the overlapping efects of patient 
pre-transplant status, operative injury, allograf function, post-transplant immunosuppression and occurrence of 
non-infectious complications. Although several reports focused on clinical utility of these infammatory markers 
in liver transplant setting, data on their diagnostic accuracy, optimal cut-ofs and factors infuencing their changes 
in the frst days afer liver transplantation in an intensive care unit are scarce26,27. As these information are crucial 
for appropriate interpretation of their results, the aim of this study was (i) to evaluate the clinical applicability of 
procalcitonin, CRP, and NLR in diagnosis of postoperative infections in the frst days afer liver transplantation in 
the intensive care unit and (ii) to assess factors infuencing their changes.
Methods
Tis was a prospective longitudinal study including 60 consecutive patients afer frst deceased donor liver transplantation in the Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery at the Medical University of Warsaw 
between November 2015 and April 2016. Inclusion criteria comprised age over 18 years and provision of 
informed consent. Patients with a history of previous liver transplantation were excluded. All participants provided informed consent prior to enrollment to the study. Te study protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board of the Medical University of Warsaw (KB/193/2015). All methods were performed in accordance 
with the relevant guidelines and regulations. No organs were procured from prisoners. All organs were procured 
by the transplant team of the Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery of the Medical University of 
Warsaw.
Bacterial and fungal infections occurring during patient postoperative stay in intensive surgical care unit were 
the primary end-point. Tey were defned and classifed according to Centers for Disease Control guidelines 
for diagnosing healthcare-associated infections in the acute care setting28. Causative microorganisms, clinical 
management and outcome were recorded. Severe postoperative complications, defned as grade ≥3 according 
to Clavien-Dindo classifcation, were set as a secondary end-point29. Early allograf dysfunction was diagnosed 
using criteria proposed by Olthof et al.
30. Follow-up for the occurrence of clinical end-points was limited to 
patient stay in the intensive care unit.
Procalcitonin, CRP, and NLR assessed at 12-hour intervals during patient postoperative stay in the intensive 
surgical care unit were recorded as primary factors of interest. Postoperative changes of these parameters over the 
frst 5 postoperative days were compared between patients with and without infectious complications, with and 
without severe postoperative complications, and with and without early allograf dysfunction. Regarding these 
comparisons, only infections and severe complications occurring during frst 5 postoperative days were considered. Irrespective of the presence of signifcant diferences between particular subgroups, a series of additional 
variables representing CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR changes were created in an exploratory fashion basing on 
evaluation of their fve-day kinetics and assessed as predictors of infections and severe morbidity. Pre-transplant, 
intraoperative, donor, and postoperative factors were subsequently evaluated for signifcant infuence on postoperative changes of the three infammation markers. Postoperative laboratory results other than CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR were included in these analyses basing on correlations with these infammation markers and 
following transformation to single variables.
Te protocol of standard antimicrobial prophylaxis included intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam for three 
days and fuconazole for seven days. In patients colonized with gram-negative extended-spectrum beta-lactamase 
producing pathogens, perioperative prophylaxis was based on imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin. Immediately 
afer the operation patients were transferred to intensive surgical care unit. Immunosuppression protocol was 
based on combinations of steroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil. Basiliximab was applied for induction 
immunosuppression in selected patients basing on clinical indications. Te choice over use of induction immunosuppression was made at the discretion of the consulting hepatologist, yet generally, at the time of study basiliximab was not preferred in patients with alcoholic liver disease or autoimmune-related liver disease. Peripheral 
and central catheter blood cultures were routinely performed 24 and 48 hours post transplantation. All grafs 
were procured from donors afer brain death. Transplantations were performed either with piggyback technique 
and side-to-side caval anastomosis or with conventional technique and two end-to-end caval anastomoses. 
Temporary extracorporeal veno-venous circulation was used during conventional procedures. Other details on 
perioperative care and surgical technique were provided elsewhere31,32.
Data were presented as medians with interquartile ranges or frequencies with percentages for quantitative 
and qualitative variables, respectively. General linear models for repeated measurements were used to evaluate 
postoperative changes of infammatory markers. Multivariable analyses included only factors with signifcant 
intergroup efects on univariable analyses with fnal model created using backward elimination method (p > 0.05 
applied for exclusion of variables). Missing variables were imputed with median values. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between single factors representing CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR changes 
and occurrence of infections and severe postoperative complications. Receiver operating characteristics analyses 
were applied for establishment of optimal cut-ofs based on Youden index. Sensitivity, specifcity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Correlations between laboratory values in 
the postoperative period were assessed using Spearman correlation coefcient. Bonferroni correction was applied 
to manage multiple comparisons in these analyses. Changes of infammation markers in the postoperative period 
were presented as least squares means with 95% confdence intervals (95% CIs). Odds ratios (ORs) and areas 
under the curves (AUCs) were presented with 95% CIs. Te level of signifcance was set to two-sided p < 0.05. All 
analyses were computed using STATISTICA 13 (Dell Inc., OK, USA) sofware.

Results
Basic characteristics of the study cohort are presented in Table 1. Overall, nine patients (15.0%) developed infections during early post-operative intensive care unit stay, including: pneumonia in seven patients (11.7%, two 
with concomitant secondary bloodstream infection) and other lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract 
infection, and surgical site infection, each in one patient. Eight of those nine patients developed infections within 
the frst fve postoperative days. Severe postoperative complications occurred in 17 patients (28.3%) and early 
allograf dysfunction occurred also in 17 patients (28.3%). All severe complications occurred over the frst 5 
postoperative days and included renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (n=5; 8.0%), respiratory 
failure requiring mechanical ventilation (n=5; 8.0%), pharyngeal bleeding managed with tamponade (n=4; 
6.6%), intraabdominal bleeding managed surgically (n=3; 5.0%), circulatory failure (n=3; 5.0%), hepatic artery 
thrombosis managed with retransplantation (n=2; 3.3%), pneumothorax managed with thoracic drainage (n=1;

Tere was a sharp rise of CRP in the frst 24hours post-transplantation with subsequent decline and plateau 
phase afer 48hours (p < 0.001; Fig. 1A). Procalcitonin changes were characterized by a sharp rise over the frst 
36 hours and subsequent decline (p < 0.001; Fig. 1B). NLR increased immediately following transplantation, 
remained stable for 36–48hours and then gradually declined (p < 0.001; Fig. 1C). Tere were no signifcant differences in CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR over 5 post-transplant days depending on the occurrence of infections 
(Fig. 2A–C). Patients with severe postoperative complications exhibited second increase of CRP beyond 48 hours 
(interaction efect: p=0.043; Fig. 2D), higher procalcitonin with more dynamic changes in the entire analyzed 
period (group efect: p=0.028; interaction efect: p=0.012; Fig. 2E), and a lack of NLR decline (interaction efect: 
p=0.018; Fig. 2F). No signifcant diferences in these infammation markers were observed depending on the 
occurrence of EAD (Fig. 3).
A series of additional variables representing CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR values was created. Of those representing CRP changes, only peak CRP concentration beyond frst 48 postoperative hours was signifcantly

procalcitonin- or NLR-based variables was signifcantly associated with the occurrence of infections.
Occurrence of severe postoperative complications was signifcantly associated with peak CRP beyond frst 
48 hours (p=0.016), diference between peak CRP beyond and within frst 48hours (p=0.007), and peak procalcitonin over frst 60hours (p=0.050; Table 3). As peak procalcitonin in general was identical to peak procalcitonin within frst 60hours, it was disregarded in further analyses. Te optimal cut-of for peak CRP beyond frst 
48 hours was 71.6 mg/L with an AUC of 0.677 (95% CI 0.507–0.847), sensitivity of 62.5%, specifcity of 76.2%,

Te only factor associated with CRP changes was the presence of alcoholic liver disease (p=0.038; Table 4). 
Factors independently associated with procalcitonin changes comprised recipient body mass index (p=0.049), 
intraoperative packed red blood cells transfusions (p=0.002), peak creatinine concentration on post-transplant

Discussion
Early diagnosis of infections afer liver transplantation is a necessary prerequisite for timely initiation of antimicrobial therapy, which increases the odds for favorable outcomes. Both CRP and procalcitonin are used for 
surveillance of postoperative infections afer non-transplant operations. NLR, a well-established marker of systemic infammatory response, currently being investigated for that purpose. Te present study indicates that CRP, 
procalcitonin, and NLR are not reliable markers for diagnosis of infectious complications in the immediate period 
afer liver transplantation in an intensive care setting, yet CRP may be used for initially excluding the diagnosis 
of infectious complications.
Of the analyzed infammatory markers, only peak CRP beyond frst 48 postoperative hours was found to be 
signifcantly associated with infections. However, sensitivity and PPV rates below 50% indicate that it cannot 
be used for accurate diagnosis and its role is rather limited to identifcation of high risk patients. Tis seems to 
be its universal shortcoming, given that low PPVs are commonly reported for CRP in surveillance of infections 
also following non-transplant operations18,21,23. Due to relatively high NPV, it seems that CRP beyond frst 
48 hours may be applied for initial exclusion of the diagnosis of infection. Tis fndings partly correspond to 
the results of studies on patients undergoing non-transplant abdominal operations, in which CRP on postoperative days three, four, and fve were all associated with the development of infectious complications. In 
meta-analysis by Adamina et al. involving nearly two thousand patients undergoing various abdominal procedures, the highest AUC for CRP on days 3–5 was 0.76 with the highest specifcity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV 
rates of 76%, 83%, 53% and 86%, respectively21. More recent meta-analysis focused on colorectal procedures 
revealed even higher AUCs for CRP on these days, ranging from 0.79 to 0.87 with the highest specifcity, sensitivity, PPV and NPV rates of 81%, 75%, 24%, and 98%, respectively18. Present study indicates that the use of 
CRP for surveillance of infections in the very early period afer liver transplantation is characterized by similar 
AUC, similar specifcity and NPV, similar or slightly higher PPV, but remarkably lower sensitivity. Terefore, 
an increased number of infectious complications may be missed using peak CRP beyond frst 48 hours for 
excluding infections afer liver transplantation than afer non-transplant abdominal operations. Tis points 
towards a rather adjunct role of CRP in excluding the diagnosis of infectious complications early afer liver

Interestingly, procalcitonin was not found useful for surveillance of infections immediately afer liver transplantation in an intensive care unit. Further, procalcitonin was remarkably, yet non-signifcantly lower in patients 
experiencing infectious episodes than in those without infections, particularly in the frst two post-transplant 
days. Tis is contrary to the fndings of studies performed in patients undergoing non-transplant operations, in 
whom peak procalcitonin in the early postoperative period was signifcantly associated with the development of 
infectious complications18–20,23. One of the potential reasons for a lack of clinical utility of procalcitonin for infection surveillance early afer liver transplantation includes the multifactorial genesis of its post-transplant course. 
Factors infuencing postoperative procalcitonin changes comprised those related to the preoperative recipient 
status (body mass index), intraoperative course (transfusions, the need for intraoperative dialysis), post-operative 
course (creatinine), and donor microbiological status. Procalcitonin may, however, be used to predict development of severe postoperative complications considering remarkable diferences observed as early as on the 
frst postoperative measurement, performed within frst 12 postoperative hours. Tis confrms previous fndings 
from non-transplant setting for the feld of liver transplantation33–35. Nevertheless, these diferences also seem 
to derive from perioperative factors infuencing its postoperative changes, such as the need for intraoperative 
dialysis or transfusion requirement, as they indicate altered course of the transplantation or more severely ill 
recipient. While both peak CRP beyond frst 48hours and diference between peak CRP beyond and within frst 
48hours were also signifcantly associated with severe morbidity with higher specifcity and PPV of the latter, earlier timing of peak concentration seems to be the most clinically important advantage of procalcitonin. Notably, 
the postoperative course of infammation markers was not dependent on liver function.
Te present study provides no evidence for clinical utility of NLR for surveillance of post-transplant infections. Although analysis of postoperative changes of NLR in patients with and without severe complications 
revealed a lack of decreasing slope in the former, the results of further analyses did not prove its clinical applicability and thus, this observation seems only of scientifc importance. As the factors independently associated with 
NLR changes comprised both duration of anhepatic phase and transaminase activity, it seems to be largely driven 
by ischemia-reperfusion injury. Tis novel fnding is partly consistent with recent reports on the corresponding association between increased NLR and small-for-size syndrome in living donor liver transplantations36,37. 
Signifcant infuence of the presence of autoimmune disease on NLR was reported previously38.
Few studies on the relevance of infammation markers in the early postoperative period were performed in 
a population of liver transplant recipients. In a study by Perrakis et al., fst peak of procalcitonin was not predictive of complicated postoperative course and occurrence of second peak was signifcantly associated both with 
infectious and non-infectious complications39. Conversely, van den Broek et al. revealed signifcant association 
between frst peak procalcitonin and development of clinically signifcant infections in an intensive care unit in 
a timeframe similar to that utilized in the present study, yet it was not an independent predictor of infections, 
in contrast to peak CRP26. According to a report by Eyraud et al., post-transplant procalcitonin was remarkably 
infuenced by presence of infection in the donor and was not predictive of infections in the recipients, similar to 
the present study40. No diferences in procalcitonin were also reported in the frst week following pediatric liver 
transplantations depending on development of infections41. Occurrence of bacteriemia was found by Kaido et al. 
to be associated with diferences in procalcitonin afer liver transplantation, yet only beyond ffh postoperative 
day27. CRP cut-of of 52mg/L at 72 hours post-transplantation was proposed for initiation of antibiotic therapy 
and supported by a PPV of more than 70% with respect to infections42. However, despite nearly three-fold higher 
threshold for peak CRP established in the present study, PPV was only slightly above 40% thus indicating its far 
lower predictive ability than that reported previously.
Te present study has several limitations. First, it is limited by the number of patients which increases the 
odds for type II error. However, multiple clinically and statistically signifcant associations of infections, severe 
morbidity and other variables with the course of infammation markers were identifed. Notably, the observation

period was limited to the earliest time afer liver transplantation, which is refected by predominant occurrence 
of respiratory tract infections and relatively low overall infection rate. Terefore, the results of this study may be 
interpreted only with respect to the period of frst days afer transplantation, which is consistent with the aims. 
Further, the follow-up period was also limited to patient stay in the intensive care unit, which is dependent on 
departments practice pattern. In this study, patients were discharged from the intensive care unit only in case of 
uneventful clinical course and consistent improvement of organ function. As the analyses were limited to immediate postoperative period and performed on a limited number of patients, we were unable to provide information on the association between the type of immunosuppression and the course of infammatory markers in the 
postoperative period. However, such analyses would be subject to bias related to potential changes in immunosuppression in patients with suspected occurrence of infectious complications. Finally, peak procalcitonin and 
peak CRP concentrations beyond 48 hours did not always precede actual occurrence of severe complications 
and infections. However, this does not seem to preclude their use as additional markers in the decision-making 
process in doubtful cases.
In conclusion, CRP beyond frst 48 postoperative hours may be used for initial exclusion of the presence of 
infectious complications afer deceased donor liver transplantation. Both procalcitonin and NLR do not seem 
clinically useful for infection surveillance immediately afer the procedure. Peak procalcitonin may be used for 
prediction of severe morbidity. CRP, procalcitonin, and NLR are not related to allograf function.
