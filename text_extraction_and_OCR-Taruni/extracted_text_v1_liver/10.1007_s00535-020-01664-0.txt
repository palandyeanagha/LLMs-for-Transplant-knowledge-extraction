Abstract Primary biliary cholangitis is an uncommon
cholestatic liver disease predominantly affecting middleaged women. Left untreated, there is a high risk of progression to end-stage liver disease. Few treatment options
exist. To date, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA) are the only medical therapies approved
for use, other than symptomatic treatments and liver
transplantation, the latter of which is reserved for those
developing complications of cirrhosis or with
intractable pruritus. UDCA improves outcomes, but many
patients do not adequately respond. OCA therapy may
improve response, but long-term data are limited. New
therapies are desperately needed, but evaluation has been
limited by the fact that the disease is heterogeneous, hard
end points take years to develop, and there are different
criteria in use for determining therapeutic response based
on surrogate biomarkers. Fibrates appear to be the most
promising new therapy and have beneficially affected
surrogate end points and are beginning to show improvement in clinical end points.

Background
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an uncommon cholestatic liver disease predominantly affecting women with an
overall prevalence of 6–402 per million persons; incidence
may be on the rise [1–5]. The age of onset is typically in
the fourth or fifth decade of life [6–8]. The exact pathophysiologic basis for the development of PBC is yet to be
fully elucidated; however, evidence supports an autoimmune-induced mechanism. This is supported by the presence of a hallmark autoantibody: anti-mitochondrial
antibody (AMA), in nearly all PBC patients. Genetic risk
and environmental exposures have also been implicated
[6–14].
Diagnosis of PBC
Diagnosis of PBC relies on fulfillment of two of three
hallmark criteria [15–18]. These include a persistently
elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the absence of
other hepatobiliary pathology, detection of a positive antimitochondrial antibody (AMA), and/or a liver biopsy with
characteristic findings [17].
After identification of an elevated ALP, assessment
should be made to detect the presence or absence of an
elevated AMA. AMA is the hallmark antibody of PBC, and
is found in over 95% of patients with the disease
[12, 19–27]. Approximately, 5% of PBC patients will lack
a detectable AMA. Biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis
and may be reserved for patients with high clinical suspicion but negative AMA, or to exclude coexistent liver
disease such as autoimmune hepatitis.

Histologically, PBC is characterized by non-suppurative
inflammation of the small intrahepatic bile ducts. An
inflammatory infiltrate is seen around the small intrahepatic
bile ducts. The classic histologic finding is a florid duct
lesion (Fig. 1), but it is only present in a minority of histologic samples [26, 28]. There is a spectrum of histologic
changes. Over time, however, there is relatively slow
progression from inflammatory to fibrotic change with the
development of cirrhosis typically occurring within
approximately 1 to 2 decades from diagnosis. However,
there is wide variation in clinical presentation and course.
Left untreated, there is variable progression to end-stage
liver disease. While there is no cure, current treatments
have been shown to delay or reduce the risk of end-stage
liver disease and its complications [29].
Need for additional treatment options
PBC carries increased risk of morbidity and mortality as
well as reduced indicators of quality of life. Medical
treatments for PBC are relatively new, having become
available in the last 30 years. Until recently, 2016,
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a synthetic bile acid, the
efficacy of which will be described in full detail later in this
manuscript, was the only approved medical therapy for
PBC. The identification of UDCA as PBC treatment was a
monumental breakthrough in medical science, but unfortunately approximately one-third of PBC patients lack an
adequate biochemical response defined as a reduction in
the surrogate biomarker ALP to less than 40% of baseline
or less than 1.67–2 times the upper limit of normal [16].
Obeticholic acid (OCA) is the newest approved treatment,
which will also be discussed later, but lacks long-term
follow up on safety and efficacy. Liver transplantation has
been used for the treatment of PBC-related cirrhosis, disease refractory to control by UDCA or OCA and when
symptomatic treatments fail to control pruritus, but carries
the real risk of transplant-related morbidity and mortality
and is thus reserved only for those patients who have
progressed to cirrhosis with significant liver dysfunction to
warrant the surgical risk and long-term risks inherent to
organ transplantation or for those patients who have
developed liver-related malignancy attributed to cirrhosis
or with refractory pruritus. Interestingly, even liver transplant does not appear to ‘‘cure’’ PBC. A small study
showed that as many as 75% of patients may develop
recurrent disease after transplant, though the severity of the
recurrence is usually of little clinical significance [30].
Pitfalls in developing clinical trials for PBC
There is a clear need for the development of new agents to
treat PBC, but progress has been overall slow. One of the
likely explanations for the difficulty in developing new and
effective agents is the lack of a clear understanding of what
drives the pathology of PBC. PBC is thought to progress
through three phases [31]. The first is an autoimmune phase
with resultant immune-mediated inflammation and damage
to bile ducts. This chronic persistent damage leads to
cholestasis. Bile acids are toxic to the hepatobiliary cells
over time. This further drives hepatocellular inflammation.
Hepatocellular and cholangio-cellular death leads to ductopenia and irreversible biliary fibrosis and cirrhosis. The
difficulty in finding treatments is that many potential targets have been identified, but bile acid metabolism is
complex and necessary for normal hepatic function.
Fig. 1 Histologic features of PBC with overlap. The image demonstrates a classic ‘‘florid duct lesion’’ of PBC. Typically, a biopsy is not
required to make the diagnosis of PBC. In this particular case, a
70-year-old woman presented with a long-standing alkaline phosphatase elevation 2–3 times the upper limit of normal. AMA testing
was negative, but ANA was markedly positive at 4.6 units.
Abdominal ultrasound was pursued showing findings suspicious for
cirrhosis, but no bile duct anomaly. Diagnostic liver biopsy was
pursued. Interestingly, the case demonstrates an overlap syndrome as
well, given the presence of interface hepatitis. This highlights the
need for diagnostic liver biopsy in cases of AMA-negative but
suspected PBC, and when there is concern for an overlap syndrome. It
further highlights the utility of ANA assessment in patients suspected
of PBC

Complete blockage of function is not possible, as normal
bile acid metabolism and homeostasis are necessary for
life.
Furthermore, from a clinical standpoint, PBC represents
a heterogeneous disease. While predominantly affecting
middle-aged Caucasian females who possess a positive
AMA, it can present in other populations and with differences in clinical severity. It is debatable whether AMAnegative and AMA-positive biliary cholangitis even represent the same disease entity, though there appears to be a
genetic association. Younger age of onset and male gender
as well as African and Hispanic descent portend a poorer
prognosis and it is not clear why [32–35]. Biomarkers of
disease severity are otherwise lacking, or in their infancy of
development, though autotaxins and the microbiome are
being studied as well as other potential markers [36, 37].
Additionally, the efficacy of investigational agents was
limited by lack of clearly defined treatment end points.
Furthermore, the development of fibrosis and the associated comorbidities of advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis-related portal hypertensive complications of
portosystemic encephalopathy, development and progression of esophageal varices, and variceal bleeding, ascites
formation, and hepatocellular carcinoma risk take years if
not decades to occur [38, 39]. Studies require years of
careful data collection and large numbers of patients,
which is lacking given the rarity of PBC, to determine
treatment efficacies. Consensus guidelines have been
developed to help reduce the heterogeneity of therapeutic
trial outcomes and to allow for standardized assessment of
treatment efficacy.
In 2010, the AASLD published guidelines to set a
standard for PBC trials [39]. It was realized that traditionally developed hard end points such as death or delay in
the progression to liver transplant may not be the most
reasonable way to evaluate drug efficacy in this condition
which lacks many treatment options and takes years to
decades to develop complications or lead to death or
transplant. Biochemical parameters such as ALP and
bilirubin, while not providing 100% correlation with histologic progression, have been considered to be reasonable
indicators of clinical disease progression in PBC patients
[40]. Given this recognition that biochemical end points do
have the ability to predict long-term outcomes at least in
the setting of UDCA response, there is the ability to design
comparative clinical trials using surrogate biomarkers such
as ALP and bilirubin. To date, there are several such criteria including: the Barcelona, Mayo I and Mayo II, Paris I
and II, Rotterdam and Toronto criteria for response to
UDCA (Table 1) [40–48]. Each has variations in the
acceptable biochemical response, with all but the Rotterdam using a reduction or normalization in ALP as an
essential criterion. Additionally, the development of
functional scores that predict outcomes such as the GLOBE
score and UK-PBC score are now also available. There are
several PBC histologic scoring systems. However, given
the patchy nature of the disease and the invasiveness of
liver biopsy, histology is felt to be an unfavorable means to
assess treatment response for any emerging therapy.
Currently, a search for primary biliary cholangitis or
primary biliary cirrhosis in the National Clinical Trials
Registry reveals slightly more than 100 clinical trials
relating to the disease. Many have been completed or are
not actively recruiting. Less than 20 appear actively
assessing novel therapies.
Aim of this article
The aim of this current article is to highlight the fact that
PBC has few treatment options to date. Currently available
treatment options while effective in some patients may lack
efficacy or lead to intolerable side effects in up to one-third
of patients. The main goal is to review the currently
available treatment options, review those that have been
shown to be less effective, and highlight the newest possible agents which may be used to treat the disease.
The current state of PBC treatment
As it currently stands, there are three potential treatments
for PBC. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the mainstay of treatment
and typically considered the foundation of any PBC treatment. Failure of UDCA therapy leads to add-on therapy
such as the addition of OCA which is also approved for use
as monotherapy in UDCA-intolerant patients. The last
currently available treatment is liver transplantation which
is reserved for patients who have developed end-stage liver
disease.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
UDCA is a synthetic bile acid which exerts its beneficial
effects through ill-defined mechanisms. It is believed to
have impact on the immune system with anti-inflammatory
properties, promote bile excretion, and reduce the severity
of cell injury [49]. There are many formulations and
dosages of UDCA available on the market without clear
benefit of one over another [50, 51]. Given the possibility
of gastrointestinal side effects, expert opinion recommends
slow up-titration and preferably divided dosing of UDCA,
though once daily dosing could be considered if compliance may otherwise be an issue. The therapeutic dose of
UDCA is narrow and evidence suggests that 13–15 mg/
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:261–272 263
123

kg/day in divided doses is beneficial. Lower doses of
UDCA 5–7 mg/kg per day were found to be inferior to the
13–15 mg/kg/day dosing [52]. Higher doses of UDCA
23–25 mg/kg/day have not been shown to offer any clinical
benefit [52]. While UDCA is generally thought of as a
benign medication, still higher doses of UDCA 28–30 mg/
kg/day have been shown to be harmful in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) with an increase in hepatic
decompensation [53]. An actively recruiting phase IV trial
(NCT03345589) aims to assess the efficacy of an intermediate dose of UDCA 18–22 mg/kg/day compared with
standard dose over 6 months of therapy with a trial end
point of biochemical remission or response based on surrogate markers of liver biochemistries including ALP.
UDCA treatment is recommended in all PBC patients
with abnormal biochemistries regardless of the presence of
advanced liver disease, as it appears most effective in
earlier stages of disease, though patients with all stages of
liver disease may benefit to some degree [17, 54]. UDCA is
unique as it is the one treatment for PBC with a long
enough history to show an improvement in hard clinical
end points such as need for liver transplant or death
[55–61]. Strikingly, life expectancy of UDCA-treated
patients early in the disease course may portend a lifeexpectancy close to the unaffected population.
While effective, up to 34% of UDCA-treated PBC
patients fail to respond to treatment as defined as lack of
normalization or reduction in ALP by greater than or equal
to 40% at 1 year of treatment [62]. There are no clear
biochemical markers to date which reliably predict
response to UDCA. As such, the need for additional
treatment options was recognized.
When thinking about the next steps in therapy, the
emerging treatments for PBC will likely be drug regimen
combinations. This is suspected because UDCA has the
largest data to support its efficacy and it will be difficult to
design ethical clinical trials without its use, because while
only 30% of patients may fully respond to UDCA, even
incomplete response has been shown to improve transplantfree survival [63]. Thus for the foreseeable future, UDCA
will likely remain the backbone of any PBC regimen, until
such an effective treatment is found that it will allow for
trials of UDCA withdrawal to be developed.
Obeticholic acid (OCA)
OCA became the second approved treatment for PBC in
2016. Given the urgent need for additional treatments, it
was given a fast-track approval through a pathway for
orphan drugs. It is approved for use in combination with
UDCA, in those UDCA-treated individuals failing to
achieve biochemical response after 1 year of appropriately
dosed therapy. It may also be used as monotherapy for
those rare patients who develop intolerable side effects to
UDCA.
OCA is a potent farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist.
FXR is responsible for modulating bile acid synthesis. FXR
activation of CYP7A1 causes inhibition of bile acid synthesis [64]. In addition to inhibition of bile acid formation,
OCA may also have a choleretic effect as shown by
Kjaergaard et al. in vivo with 11C-Csar PET (AASLD 2019
#1269).
A series of clinical trials have established OCA’s efficacy as an adjunctive treatment for UDCA-refractory or
intolerant PBC. The initial study of OCA was performed in
59 patients where it was used as a monotherapy in patients
who had not been exposed to UDCA in the preceding

The various proposed criteria for scoring a response to UDCA-treated patients are above presented. All but Rotterdam incorporates improvement
in alkaline phosphatase typically as a function of upper limit of normal (ULN). Albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and albumin may
also be used. The UK-PBC score also predicts outcomes in a mathematical formula derived from baseline platelet count, albumin, and 1 year
total bilirubin, transaminases, and alkaline phosphatase

6 months prior to study enrollment. Randomized patients
underwent 12 weeks of treatment with placebo, 10 mg, or
50 mg of OCA. Marked significant reductions in ALP were
noted in the 10 mg and 50 mg group compared with placebo. There was no difference in biochemical outcome
between the doses. However, it should be noted that
approximately 40% of patients in the 50 mg OCA group
discontinued therapy due to pruritus which is now a wellestablished side effect. A subsequent phase II study of 165
patients which did allow for the continued use of UDCA
assessed outcomes of 10 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg dosages over
a 3 month period [65]. Approximately 70% of patients had
a treatment response, with up to a 25% decrease in ALP
seen in the treatment groups, whereas less than 5% were
seen in the placebo group. Pruritus remained a source of
significant dropout. The POISE trial was a phase III study
which established the current dosing guidelines for OCA.
Patients were randomized to placebo, OCA 5 mg/day
titrated to 10 mg after 6 months if lacking clinical benefit,
or OCA 10 mg [66]. 210 patients were included in the trial
and treated for a year. Nearly 50% of participants achieved
the primary end point of reduction in ALP to less than 1.67
times ULN, reduction in ALP by greater than 15% and
normal bilirubin level. Pruritus again remained the most
common side effect. Patients had the option to continue in
an open label extension.
Results from the open label extension of POISE trial
have recently been reported. A remarkable 98% of patients
were enrolled in the open label extension. In the recently
published 3 year interim analysis, data from 193 patients
were available [67]. At 48 months, there was sustained
improvement in ALP and bilirubin compared with baseline.
Pruritus continued to afflict 77% of patients, and 7 patients
(4%) ultimately withdrew from the study due to pruritus.
There was one death not attributable to OCA. While 8% of
patients had serious adverse events, none were considered
to be directly attributable to OCA. The results of 116
patients, of whom 52 had received OCA throughout the
5 years of study duration, were recently presented (AASLD
2019 #LO6). Over half of the patients continued to meet the
primary end point of ALP reduction by 15% or more, with
the total ALP below 1.67xULN and normal bilirubin. Mean
liver stiffness scores as measured by transient elastography
also remained stable. Of two deaths, neither a septic episode
nor jaundice due to alcohol-related hepatitis was attributed
to OCA use. Overall, 4% (8 patients) dropped out due to
pruritus, with the vast majority having mild pruritus.
The safety and efficacy of OCA continue to be assessed
in two phase IV clinical trials. NCT02308111, also known
as COBALT, is looking to assess hard primary end points
including death, transplant, and hepatic decompensation.
NCT03633227 is assessing the pharmacokinetics and
safety of OCA titrated to a maximum dose of 10 mg twice
weekly in patients with Child B and C confirmed cirrhosis
as measured by liver biopsy, transient elastography with a
score greater than or equal to 16.9 kPa, or clinically
apparent portal hypertension or cirrhosis based on clinical
and biochemical parameters. It should be noted that there is
growing evidence OCA may cause hepatic decompensation
or acute liver failure requiring transplantation possibly in a
dose-dependent fashion [68].
Targets of emerging treatments and possible
therapeutic agents
When approaching therapeutic targets, it is useful to review
the phases of PBC. Again, there is autoimmune-mediated
inflammation which leads to cholestasis, ductopenia and
biliary fibrosis. Thus, these three phases represent the focus
of treatment targets (Table 2).
Immune system modulation
While the first mechanism of liver injury in PBC is immunemediated inflammation of hepatobiliary cells, immunosuppressive treatments have largely been shown to be ineffective in isolation or as adjunctive therapies in PBC.
Immunosuppressive treatments often lack specific targets
and thus may have unfavorable systemic side effects such as
osteoporosis [69]. However, Leuschner et al. showed a
significant improvement in liver histology and ALP in their
randomized trial of 39 patients, of whom 20 were randomized to receive budesonide at a dose of 3 mg three times
daily over a 2 year period [70]. Rautiainen in 2005 published the results of a 3 year randomized, but open label
study of patients receiving combination budesonide at a
dose of 6 mg/day in combination with UDCA [71]. Liver
fibrosis regressed in 25% of treated patients. The open label
study which confirmed worsening of osteoporosis in treated
patients showed little improvement in 22 biochemical nonresponders to UDCA as evidenced by persistent elevations
in ALP [2 ULN [69]. Hirschfeld et al. presented their
interim data (NCT00746486) on 62 PBC UDCA non-responders with confirmed histologic inflammation. 40
patients received budesonide administered in a 3 mg dose
three times daily. There was no improvement in liver histology after a mean of 25 months of treatment. ALP dropped by 94 points, and ALP normalized in 35 versus 9%
which was significant. The primary end point of ALP
reduction\1.67ULN, 15% overall reduction and normal
bilirubin were achieved in over 40% of patients by
12 months, with significant difference from placebo over
3 years of treatment. There was no worsening of osteoporosis or other adverse events. Combination therapy with
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:261–272 265
123

UDCA, prednisolone and azathioprine did improve albumin
and ALP in patients with high baseline transaminases [72].
Other immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate,
a folic acid reductase inhibitor and mycophenolate, an
inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor, have
been studied with conflicting results. A study by Coombes
and colleagues, the PUMPS trial, examined the addition of
weekly MTX to UDCA standard treatment versus addition
of placebo [73]. In 132 patients who were exposed to MTX
over a median of 7.6 years, and were continued until the
trial was stopped as futility was documented or they
underwent transplant, dosage adjustment or cessation due
to MTX toxicity or development of cancer, no differences
were seen in hard end points such as transplantation or
decompensation. Lindor et al. and Gonzalez-Koch et al.
also failed to show significant benefits of add-on MTX
[74]. Kaplan and colleagues showed in a 10 year study and
then a 20 year follow-up study that colchicine and
methotrexate may indeed be effective in a subset of
patients in improving biochemical and histologic end
points, but improved mortality has not been seen [75, 76].
However, it should be noted in the initial PUMPS trial,
30% of patients stopped therapy due to adverse events [73].
A recent abstract (AASLD 2019 #1260) presented by
Krampitz and colleagues showed that in a study of suboptimal UDCA-responders with an average of 7.4 years of
follow-up, MTX did improve biochemical end points with
a significant 21% drop in ALP in the treated group compared with 2% in placebo, but had no effect on clinical end
points. Mycophenolate has had mixed results with some
studies showing improvement in histology, but another
study showing no meaningful change in biochemical
surrogates, but with a significant number of patient side
effects [77, 78].
E6011 (NCT03092765), an anti-human fractalkine/
CX3CL1 (FKN) monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in
UDCA-incomplete responders. The FKN–CX3CL1 interaction appears to be overexpressed in PBC-damaged bile
duct epithelial cells. In the abstract presented by Tanaka
(AASLD 2019 #1266) and colleagues, 29 Japanese UDCA
non-responders with elevated ALP were treated in a double
blind fashion. However, this study was discontinued due to
lack of efficacy after 12 week interim analysis. Other
CXCL chemokine modulators have likewise failed to show
significant benefit in clinical trials.
Multiple studies have looked at modulation of various
components of the immune system and otherwise failed to
show significant benefit. Modulators of T-cell function and
of T-cell recruitment have been studied with negative
results. Limited data have shown improvement in ALP
with significant improvement in pruritus with rituximab but
with no improvement in fatigue [79, 80]. The risks of stem
cell transplantation, which has been evaluated in several
studies, has failed to show clinically significant benefit and
does not appear to be worth the risks of such an invasive
procedure.
Agents that reduce oxidative stress
and inflammation
S-Adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is an antioxidant which
increases glutathione levels. In 24 PBC patients treated

Several agents are presented with their intended target in the pathogenesis of PBC including immune system modulation, bile acid regulation and
reduction of inflammation or oxidative stress. The table represents some selected treatments discussed in the text arranged by target. Agents in
bold are either approved for use or have at least modest evidence to support use. Many agents and targets are still in developmental stages.
Immunomodulation has largely been shown to be ineffective, though budesonide is helpful in overlap syndromes. The largest pool of agents
targets bile acid regulation. Fibrates should be considered for use given growing evidence
a
Seladelpar appears promising, but trials are currently on hold given concerns over inducing liver disease

1200 mg/day showed significant improvement in ALP in
non-cirrhotic patients as compared to age-matched controls
[81]. Withdrawal of SAMe led to insignificant increases in
biochemistries. In cirrhotic patients, a significant decline in
bilirubin was noted. There was significant improvement
with regard to pruritus and fatigue.
Setanaxib (GKT831) a NOX1/4 inhibitor which inhibits
NADPH oxidases 1 and 4, involved in the development of
hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, was shown to improve
fibrosis and cholestasis. In a study (AASLD 2019 #1283) of
111 patients randomized to placebo, GKT831 400 mg once
daily or twice daily for 24 weeks, a significant drop in
fibrosis scores of about 2 and 3 kilopascals, respectively, in
the 400 mg and 400 mg twice daily treatment groups
compared with placebo was observed in those with a
baseline liver stiffness in excess of 9.6 kPa. Overall, there
were 2 adverse events in each of the treatment groups
which led to drug discontinuation. Mean decreases in ALP
were also significant in both treatment groups compared
with placebo.
Regulators of bile acid homeostasis
There are several important mediators of bile acid metabolism including: farnesoid X receptor (FXR), plasma
membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5),
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) [82-84]. FXR
agonism downregulates cytochrome 7A1, which is a major
regulator of bile acid homeostasis. OCA, as previously
discussed, is the best known FXR agonist. FXR functions
in the hepatocyte to decrease bile acid synthesis, increase
secretion and conjugation. In the stellate, or scar forming
cells, FXR has been shown to decrease fibrosis. TGR5 is a
membrane receptor for bile acids located on macrophages.
In the Kupffer cell, agonism of the TGR5 receptor results
in reduced cytokine production. In cholangiocytes, there is
increased cell proliferation. The receptor is not however
present in the hepatocyte. Sphinogsine1PR2 is also
expressed in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and cholangiocytes.
In hepatoctyes, activation results in decreased bile acid
synthesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. In cholangiocytes, there is an increase in cell production. Again,
seen in Kupffer cells, there is a reduction in cytokine
production. While these targets are exciting and there have
been hundreds to a few thousand papers on these targets
published in the last two decades, overall clinical utility is
limited as evidenced by the relative paucity of clinical
treatment trials currently ongoing.
Other possible targets are modulators of bile acid
transport. The clinical reasoning here is that modulation of
the concentration and composition of the bile acid pool
could have positive effects at reducing the disease burden
in cholestatic liver disease. Apical sodium-dependent bile
acid transporter (ASBT) and ileal bile acid transporter
(IBAT) inhibitors were shown to reduce plasma cholesterol
levels and increase bile acid secretion [85]. Unfortunately,
this led to significant side effects including choleretic
diarrhea. However, some of these agents have subsequently
been proven useful in chronic idiopathic constipation.
Maralixibat was shown to reduce bile acid levels and
improve pruritus in greater than 50% of patients; however,
this did not differ from placebo [86].
Targets of FXR
In addition to OCA, which is currently used in clinical
practice, there are two other FXR agonists, cilofexor and
tropifexor, which show potential promise. The results of
NCT02516605 evaluating differing doses of tropifexor
compared with placebo and with the notable exclusion that
patients may not be on OCA have been submitted, and the
results are anticipated. Additionally, EDP-305 has shown
benefit in reducing liver injury and fibrosis in mouse
models (AASLD 2019 #2202), and an active yet currently
not recruiting phase II trial NCT03394924 seeks to assess
its safety and efficacy in PBC.
PPAR agonists
PPARs affect bile acid homeostasis, including the regulation of bile acid synthesis and detoxification. There are
three isoforms, all of which have been used as therapeutic
targets. Fibrates, including fenofibrate and bezafibrate,
which are among some of the most promising emerging
therapies for PBC are PPAR agonists. elafibranor and
seladelpar also target the PPAR pathway.
Fibrates
A pilot study of 20 patients with PBC was conducted in
2011 [87]. Patients received fenofibrate 160 mg daily in
addition to standard dose UDCA for 48 weeks. ALP levels
significantly dropped from a baseline mean of 351U/L to
177U/L. Cessation of treatment resulted in rebound ALP
elevations. In this study, heartburn was the most common
side effect. Furthermore, Ghonem and colleagues (AASLD
2019 #1263) showed that in 30 PBC patients, the addition
of 160 mg/day of fenofibrate to a standard dose UDCA
regimen significantly reduced ALP levels to normal ranges
and improved ALT levels. Bilirubin was relatively
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:261–272 267
123

unchanged. There was also significant alteration in the bile
acid pool with reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines.
In 2016, a large retrospective study showed improvement in hard end points of decompensation-free and
transplant-free survival in addition to improved surrogate
end points [62]. Of 120 patients, 46 were exposed to
fenofibrate. Using the Toronto criteria for response, 41% of
the fenofibrate group versus 7% in the UDCA group met
criteria for a clinical response. Regardless of clinical
response, exposure to fenofibrate was associated with
improved transplant-free and overall survival. When
comparing non-cirrhotic groups, bilirubin trended toward
significantly higher in the UDCA alone group, and
remained lowest in the combo group. Notably, withdrawal
due to side effects was quite high, in excess of 20%, and
cirrhotic patients developed more rapid increase in serum
bilirubin suggesting a propensity of fenofibrate to precipitate hepatic decompensation in patients with advanced
fibrosis.
In 2018, the BEZURSO study (NCT01654731) conducted by Corpechot and colleagues reported outcomes of
their phase III trial of 100 UDCA-inadequate responders
based on Paris II, 50 of whom were randomized to receive
bezafibrate 400 mg daily plus standard dose UDCA versus
standard UDCA and placebo [88]. The 24 month study
showed that 31% in the bezafibrate group compared with
0% in the placebo group achieved complete biochemical
response as defined by surrogate markers including
bilirubin, ALP, albumin and prothrombin index time (PT).
ALP normalized completely in 67% of the treated group.
Pruritus also improved. Myalgias were present in 20% of
treated patients, including a patient with rhabdomyolysis
who was on statin therapy at the time. While liver stiffness
improved in 15% of patients as measured by non-invasive
means, of 28 patients with available biopsies there was no
change in histology. Portal hypertension and a high alkaline phosphatase level greater than 2.53ULN at baseline
were identified as independent predictors of treatment
failure. Bezafibrate was associated with a 5% increase in
serum creatinine, which is a known complication of PPARa agonists. The authors concluded that advanced cirrhosis
and severe cholestasis could limit therapy with bezafibrate.
Other PPAR agonists
Seladelpar, a PPAR delta agonist, has shown promise [89].
In a trial of 41 randomized non-UDCA responders there
was a significant drop in ALP of 12 weeks in both groups
on seladelpar 50 mg and seladelpar 200 mg. Pruritus was
the main side effect. While all patients who completed
12 weeks of therapy had normalization of ALP, there were
instances of grade 3 increases in liver injury tests to 5–20
times the upper limit of normal. Future studies are expected
to evaluate seladelpar at lower doses. However, enthusiasm
for this medication has very recently been tempered, as
CymaBay therapeutics has announced as of November 25,
2019 a halt to all studies using seladelpar, after liver
biopsies in study patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
and PSC revealed unexpected interface hepatitis of unclear
precipitant.
Elafibranor, a PPAR-alpha/delta dual agonist, was
studied in UDCA non-responders (NCT03124108). Randomized patients received 80 mg or 120 mg daily for
12 weeks. 73.3% of patients in the 80 mg group and 42.9%
in the 120 mg group versus 0% in the placebo group
achieved the primary end point of reduction in ALP by
40% from baseline, less than 2 9 ULN, and normalization
of bilirubin.
Other agents
Several other agents have been tried and have not shown a
clear benefit, or results have not been published. These
include dietary and herbal supplements including mare’s
milk and milk thistle. Tetrathiomolybdate, a copper
chelator, appeared to reduce AST and ALT, but had no
effect on ALP [38, 90]. CTLA-4 gene polymorphism in
Asians, but not Caucasians may be a risk for disease
development [91]. CTLA-4 inhibition has not been found
to be beneficial [92]. Interleukin modulation with ustekinumab has also been found ineffective. B-cell depletion
with rituximab lacks long-term efficacy and is not beneficial for the treatment of fatigue, but may improve pruritus
[79, 80]. Other biologic therapies including invasive measures such as stem cell transplantation have also lacked
significant enough benefit to be worth the potential side
effects. Growing bodies of data suggest that liver disease
may either be caused by or result in alterations in the
microbiome. An ongoing study NCT03521297 will assess
the efficacy of probiotics in addition to UDCA.
NCT03590886 will assess other microbiome targets. Antifibrotic agents are being studied in several liver diseases,
but insufficient data are yet available to determine their use
in PBC.
Practical treatment considerations
The treatment landscape for PBC has been relatively
stable for the last 30 years. However, within the last
3–5 years research appears to be advancing. The mainstay
of treatment is UDCA dosed at 13–15 mg/kg/day preferably in divided doses (Fig. 2). For those patients failing to
achieve adequate biochemical response based on any one
268 J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:261–272
123

of several available criteria which include reductions in
ALP and normalization of bilirubin in most cases, other
agents should be added. In patients intolerant to or failing
to adequately respond to UDCA, OCA should be considered. The initial starting dose is 5 mg/day and assessment
should be made after 6 months to determine whether a dose
increase is necessary. A very important caveat is that OCA
needs to be markedly dose reduced in the setting of cirrhosis due to concerns over safety. Instead of daily dosing,
the dose should be 5 mg once weekly, with careful uptitration to no more than 10 mg twice weekly. Pruritus
remains a common side effect. Outside an overlap condition, it is not currently clear that immunosuppressive agents
have a defined role in pure PBC and are not currently
recommended.
While not approved in the USA, fibrates appear to be a
very promising option, with both fenofibrate 160 mg/day
and bezafibrate 400 mg/day showing beneficial effects on
surrogate end points and symptoms including pruritus.
Emerging data suggest that combination therapy with triple
therapy with UDCA, OCA and fibrates may be even more
beneficial in improving surrogate end points (AASLD 2019
#LB06). However, it should be noted that current guidelines recommend against the combination use of OCA and
fibrates in advanced cirrhosis given the real risk of precipitating further decompensation [17]. Additionally,
patients on fibrates need careful assessment of renal function, and for rhabdomyolysis. These agents should not be
combined with statins. Clinical trials remain an option for
patients failing or with intolerance to the aforementioned
therapies.
Treatment of symptoms and metabolic complications in
patients with PBC is also very important. Given the
autoimmune nature of the condition, assessment should be
made for other autoimmune conditions such as monitoring
of thyroid function, and for sicca symptoms including dry
mouth.
Pruritus and fatigue are the most common and severe
complications of PBC. So far, no specific pharmacotherapy
has proven beneficial in treating fatigue in PBC. Likewise,
liver transplant has not been shown to improve fatigue
either. Currently, a stepwise approach is recommended for
pruritus (Fig. 3). Anion-exchange resins are considered the
first-line treatment. Caution in proper timing of the dosage
is advised, given that in addition to binding bile acids, they
may also bind medications limiting their absorption. A
stepwise approach thereafter with rifampicin, opiate
antagonists or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
sertraline may also be used. Antihistamines are one of the
most commonly prescribed medications and may be beneficial to help patients sleep given that sedation is a side
effect. The recently reported results of the FITCH trial,
which have shown bezafibrate to cause a greater than 50%
reduction in pruritus symptoms in about 50% of patients,
may ultimately result in fibrates being added to this algorithm (AASLD 2019 #13).

Fig. 2 Proposed treatment algorithm for patients with primary biliary
cholangitis (PBC). Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) dosed at
13–15 mg/kg/day in divided doses is the standard treatment for all
patients with PBC and should be initiated in all patients regardless of
disease stage. In patients with incomplete response to UDCA therapy
after one year, obeticholic acid (OCA) may be initiated at a dose of
5 mg/day and up-titrated to 10 mg/day after 6 months if there is
incomplete response. It may also be used as monotherapy in UDCAintolerant individuals. Extreme care should be taken when initiating
this therapy in cirrhotic patients. The maximum dosage is limited to
no more than 10 mg twice weekly in cirrhosis. Bezafibrate is an
acceptable adjunctive therapy in Europe. It is not available in the
USA. Fenofibrate (*) may be considered in an off-label use. Fibrates
should not be combined with statins or used in advanced liver disease.
Renal function should be monitored. Immunosuppression (^) specifically budesonide may be considered in patients with overlap PBC
and autoimmune hepatitis. Other agents such as methotrexate,
mycophenolate and calcineurin inhibitors have less robust evidence
to support use. For patients intolerant or failing the above regimens,
clinical trials may be considered

Conclusion
The treatment landscape for PBC is changing as newer
treatment targets are investigated. Currently, UDCA
remains the mainstay of treatment with adjunctive therapies added when incomplete response is achieved. Despite
three phases of PBC, immune, cholestasis-induced injury
and fibrosis, the cholestasis-induced injury seems to be the
most promising physiologic target given the lack of data to
support immune-system modulation and lack of studies
evaluating anti-fibrotic therapies.
