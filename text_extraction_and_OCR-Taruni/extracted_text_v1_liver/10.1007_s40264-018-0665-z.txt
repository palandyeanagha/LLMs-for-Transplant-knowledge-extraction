Abstract
Introduction Patients with HIV infection may have a
higher prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia, as well
as an increased risk of bone fracture compared with nonHIV-infected individuals. Antiretroviral therapy is thought
to be one of factors associated to osteoporosis-related bone
fractures.
Objective The aim of this study was to assess the effects of
long-term exposure to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)
on the cumulative risk of osteoporosis-related bone fractures in Japanese patients with HIV infection.
Design This observational cohort study comprised a joint
HIV-related drug survey of patients treated with TDF
between April 2004 and March 2013.
Methods Thirty-five healthcare facilities in Japan participated in the survey. The incidence of osteoporosis-related
fractures was extracted from all adverse events (AEs) using
standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
queries, and used to calculate the fracture rate per 10,000
patient-years (PY). Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to
estimate the cumulative probability of fracture during the
study period.
Results A total of 3251 patients who received TDF or
TDF/emtricitabine between April 2004 and March 2013
were analyzed in this study; 93.5% of patients were male.
The fracture rate was 13.5 per 10,000 PY in males and 42.2
per 10,000 PY in females. The mean age for male patients
with osteoporosis-related fracture was 43.2 years, whereas
it was 65.7 years in female patients. The cumulative
probability of osteoporosis-related fracture increased
after C 5 years of TDF exposure. The rate of hip fracture
(95% confidence interval) was 7.2 (3.1–14.2) per 10,000
PY.
Conclusions Among HIV-infected patients in Japan,
treatment with TDF for C 5 years increases the risk of
bone fractures in younger men, in addition to that seen in
older post-menopausal women.
Key Points
Long-term use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(TDF) in HIV-infected patients increases the risk of
fractures.
All patients who had hip fracture were men with a
mean age of 42.5 years.
Experts are encouraged to consider the long-term
effects of TDF therapy in patients with HIV before
initiating treatment.

individuals [1, 2]. Multiple factors are thought to cause
decreases in bone mineral density (BMD), including the
effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART), inflammatory
cytokines, and HIV-1 proteins on osteoblasts and bone
turnover [3, 4]. A 2013 meta-analysis indicated that HIV
infection is associated with a modest increase in the risk of
all fractures and fragility fractures [1]. Most of the studies
included in this analysis did not show an independent effect
of the ART drug class or exposure on the risk of fractures,
which suggests that the role of ART in incident fractures is
not clearly established.
Studies in rhesus monkeys and humans have indicated
that bone fractures associated with ART are due to losses in
BMD [5–7]. In particular, the antiretroviral drug tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with decreased
BMD and increased bone turnover markers, which leads to
osteoporosis-related bone fractures [6, 8].
TDF and a TDF/emtricitabine (FTC) combination were
approved in Japan for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in
2004 and 2005, respectively. In a global post-marketing
study of the safety of TDF over 4 years, the incidence of
bone abnormalities and fractures was low [9]. However, a
registry study has indicated that cumulative exposure to
TDF was an independent risk factor for osteoporosis-related fractures [10].
As the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in Japan is relatively low, with a total of 16,903 cases of HIV infection
and 7658 cases of AIDS being reported by the end of 2014
according to the Annual Report on AIDS Trends [11], joint
HIV-related drug (HRD) surveys are often used for postmarketing surveillance in Japan [12, 13]. We conducted a
post-marketing observational cohort study using a joint
HRD survey of TDF safety data in Japanese patients with
HIV infection over 8 years to assess the effects of longterm exposure on the cumulative risk of osteoporosis-related bone fractures.
2 Methods
2.1 Data Source
The joint HRD survey was approved by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan in conjunction
with drug manufacturers to collect safety data. The HRD
survey has been conducted since Aug 1997. Thirty-five
healthcare facilities from different regions of Japan participated in the survey, and collected data were anonymized at a data center (CMIC-PMS Co., Ltd). Patients
who had initiated treatment with an HRD were registered
by physicians on the first business day of the next fiscal
year (Japanese fiscal year starts from April). Data collection continued until the medication was stopped. The
survey was conducted in accordance with the Good PostMarketing Study Practice regulations issued by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.
2.2 Observational data
The following patient information was recorded: age,
gender, race, ART drugs, general complications, concomitant drugs, hepatitis C status, baseline CD4? count
and HIV viral load, duration of TDF therapy, and adverse
events (AEs), including the seriousness, outcome, and
causality of AEs as determined by the treating physician.
An AE was defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign,
symptom, or disease that occurred during treatment.
2.3 Assessments and Definitions
Osteoporosis-related fractures were extracted from all AEs
reported between April 2004 and March 2013 using standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
queries. All kidney-related AEs were included in concomitant renal dysfunction to assess the influence of druginduced renal dysfunction on fractures.
2.4 Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA). Patient-years (PY)
of follow-up were calculated from the date of first TDF
administration to the first occurrence of osteoporosis-related fracture, the end of administration, or the end of
follow-up (whichever happened first). The fracture rate was
calculated as the number of fractures per 10,000 PY, with
95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the Poisson distribution. The cumulative probability of osteoporosis-related fracture during the study period was estimated by a
Kaplan–Meier analysis. Multivariate logistic regression
analysis was used to evaluate the effects of opioid use,
comorbid diabetes mellitus and co-infection with hepatitis
C virus (HCV) on the risk of osteoporosis-related fracture.
Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated.
3 Results
3.1 Study Population
A total of 3251 patients treated with TDF or TDF/FTC
between April 2004 and March 2013 were analyzed in this
study; 987 patients received TDF between April 2004 and
March 2012, and 2645 patients received TDF/FTC between
April 2005 and March 2013; 381 patients were switched
844 A. Komatsu et al.

from TDF to TDF/FTC or vice versa during the study
period.
Most of the patient population (3040 of 3251; 93.5%)
was male. The mean age was 40.0 years for male patients
and 41.2 years for female patients, and the mean duration
of TDF treatment was 1246.3 days.
3.2 Osteoporosis-Related Fractures
Overall, 17 (0.52%) patients were diagnosed with osteoporosis-related fractures during the study period. Of these
patients, 14 (82.4%) were male. The fracture rate was 42.2
per 10,000 PY in female patients and 13.5 per 10,000 PY
in males (Table1). Among the female patients with
osteoporosis-related fractures (n = 3), the mean age was
65.7 years and the mean duration of TDF before fracture
onset was 123 days. In male patients, the mean age was
43.2 years and the mean duration of TDF was 1437.7 days.
Among patients with osteoporosis-related fractures, the
TDF treatment duration prior to fracture onset ranged from
61 to 2965 days, the baseline CD4
? count ranged from 7 to
749 cells/lL (mean 277.9 cells/lL), and all patients had
received concomitant ART; protease inhibitor (PI) use was
recorded in 11 (64.7%) patients.
The cumulative probability of osteoporosis-related
fractures, as estimated by Kaplan–Meier analysis (Fig.1),
indicated that the cumulative probability of osteoporosisrelated fracture increased after C 5 years of TDF
exposure.
3.3 Prevalence of Hip Fracture
Overall, hip fracture occurred in eight patients (0.25%)
(Table1), all of whom were male with a mean age of
42.5 years. The hip fracture rate (95% CI) was 7.2
(3.1–14.2) per 10,000 PY, and the age distributions were
37.5% (n = 3) aged\40 years, 37.5% (n = 3) aged
40–49 years, and 25.0% (n = 2) aged 50–59 years. No hip
fractures were reported in female patients.
3.4 Risk Factor Analysis
In the entire study cohort (n = 3251), 16 patients were
reported to use opioids as concomitant medications.
However, none of these patients experienced osteoporosisrelated bone fractures, therefore, multivariate logistic
regression analysis of the effects of opioid use on the risk
of osteoporosis-related bone fractures could not be
performed.
Nevertheless, multivariate analyses of the effects of
comorbid diabetes and co-infection with HCV were carried
out. Co-infection with HCV was associated with a statistically significant increase in the risk of osteoporosisTable 1 Incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures and hip fractures between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2013 in HIV-infected patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

whereas no significant association was found with the
presence of comorbid diabetes (OR 2.130; 95% CI
0.452–10.046).
None of the patients who experienced osteoporosis-related bone fractures had concomitant renal dysfunction,
whereas it was present in 1.2% of patients who did not
experience such fractures (38/3234).
4 Discussion
This study was conducted to assess the effects of long-term
exposure to TDF on the cumulative risk of osteoporosisrelated bone fractures in Japanese patients with HIV
infection. To our knowledge, this is the first long-term,
observational cohort study to assess the effect of TDF
exposure on the cumulative risk of osteoporosis-related
fractures in Japanese patients with HIV infection. The
results of this study indicated that the overall incidence of
osteoporosis-related fractures in this patient population was
low, and the rate of fractures was three-fold higher in
females than in males, with female patients being
approximately 20 years older than males at fracture onset.
These findings are consistent with the corresponding
statistics for the general population, where osteoporosis is
strongly associated with older age and female gender [14].
In a previous cohort study conducted in Japanese patients,
the risk for osteoporosis of the lumbar spine was significantly increased in women of advanced age (p \0.001),
while the prevalence of osteoporosis in men was low
(0–7.4%) regardless of age [15]. Of note, there were no
cases of osteoporosis in men aged \ 49 years [15].
In the present study, the risk of fractures was increased
in relatively young Japanese men with HIV infection. This
finding is different from what is known about fractures in
the general population, especially with regard to the mean
age of hip fracture, which in the present study was
42.5 years. A previous study reported that in the general
population in Japan, the incidence of hip fracture was
markedly higher in older men and women [16].
In addition to ART, several other factors are known to
affect the risk of fractures, such as tobacco and alcohol
consumption, opioid use, malnutrition, comorbid diabetes,
and co-infection with HCV. However, in the present study
it was difficult to estimate their effect due to the low
number of patients who experienced fractures. It should be
noted that there were few cases of HIV infection via the
intravenous route in Japan [17], and therefore, the impact
of drug addiction on the risk of fractures should be negligible [17]. In addition, none of the patients who experienced osteoporosis-related bone fractures reported use of
an opioid as concomitant medication; therefore, analysis of
the effects of opioid use also could not be performed.
Analysis of the effects of tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as of body mass index, on the risk of osteoporosis-related bone fractures could not be performed
because the necessary data were not included in the HRD
survey. In the present study, co-infection with HCV was
found to be associated with a statistically significant
increase in the risk of osteoporosis-related fracture. Infection with HCV is a known risk factor for osteoporosis [18].
It should be noted, however, that patients who experienced
a fracture and had concomitant HCV infection in the present study (n = 5) were all men with a mean age of
38.2 years. Therefore, this is the same demographic that
was identified as being at an increased risk of osteoporosisrelated fracture (relatively young men).
The results of this study indicate that, among females,
older women have the highest incidence of osteoporosisrelated bone fractures, while among males, relatively
young men are most affected. The major difference
between the two groups was found in the mean duration of
TDF exposure at the onset of fracture, which was 123 days
in women and 1437.7 days in men. Therefore, the duration
of TDF exposure is likely to be one of the main risk factors
for osteoporosis-related bone fracture in patients with HIV
infection.
Current guidelines for the management of patients with
HIV infection recommend BMD screening for osteoporosis
in postmenopausal women and men over 50 years old
[19, 20]. A multicenter cohort study in HIV-infected men
highlighted the importance of screening for osteoporosis in
HIV-positive men over the age of 50 [21]. Contrary to
guideline recommendations, the results of the present study
suggested that relatively young men may also be at risk of
bone fracture if they have been exposed to TDF for longer
than 5 years. As men between the ages of 20 and 40 constitute the majority of new HIV cases in Japan [17], clinicians should consider the risk of osteoporosis-related bone
fracture in HIV-infected patients who have been receiving
treatment for extended periods of time, even if those
patients are relatively young men. The number of patients
on TDF or one of its combination drugs has dramatically
increased in low- and middle-income countries over the
past decade. Special attention should be paid to the risk of
osteoporosis in young men with HIV infection in those
countries, as bone fractures can have a serious impact on
their families and communities.
An ART combination containing tenofovir alafenamide
(TAF) was approved in the US and Japan in 2016, and TAF
has shown less renal and bone toxicity than the equivalent
TDF-containing combination product in the US [22]. It will
be interesting to compare the incidence of osteoporosisrelated bone fracture between the two treatments. However, if the duration of exposure to TDF is a major factor
846 A. Komatsu et al.

affecting the incidence of fractures, then patients who had
taken TDF for a long time before switching to TAF should
continue to be monitored.
This study was limited by a lack of comparison between
the incidences of osteoporosis-related fractures in TDFand non-TDF-treated patients. Lack of information on
other risk factors, such as BMI or alcohol and tobacco use,
is another limitation of this study. These limitations were
because the HRD survey only permitted collection of TDFrelated data. Our study also enrolled a limited number of
patients aged [ 65 years, making it difficult to reach a
clear conclusion regarding the risk of bone fractures in
older patients. In addition, the incidence of bone fractures
after 2011 may be affected by reporting bias, as the
potential relationship between TDF and bone fractures has
been more widely known since then and physician
knowledge of this association may cause an increase in the
reporting of fractures.
5 Conclusions
This longitudinal study of 3251 HIV-infected patients in
Japan suggests an association between osteoporosis-related
fractures and the duration of TDF administration. Patients
with a longer duration of TDF exposure have an increased
risk of bone fracture, particularly in men aged \ 60 years.
If the duration of TDF administration is C 5 years, the
possibility of bone fracture must be considered, regardless
of patient age and gender. When making decisions
regarding HIV infection-related issues, experts need to
consider the risk of osteoporosis-related fracture with
longer-term administration of TDF.
