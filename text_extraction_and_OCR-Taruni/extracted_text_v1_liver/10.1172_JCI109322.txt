A B S T R A C T The cyclotron-produced radionuclide,
13N, was used to label ammonia and to study its metabolism in a group of 5 normal subjects and 17 patients
with liver disease, including 5 with portacaval shunts
and 11 with encephalopathy. Arterial ammonia levels
were 52-264 ,AM. The rate of ammonia clearance from
the vascular compartment (metabolism) was a linear
function of its arterial concentration: Amol/min = 4.71
[NH3Ia + 3.76, r = +0.85, P < 0.005. Quantitative body
scans showed that 7.4+±0.3% of the isotope was metabolized by the brain. The brain ammonia utilization
rate, calculated from brain and blood activities, was a
function of the arterial ammonia concentration: ,umol/
min per whole brain = 0.375 [NH3]a - 3.6, r = +0.93,
P < 0.005. Assuming that cerebral blood flow and brain
weights were normal, 47 + 3% of the ammonia was extracted from arterial blood during a single pass through
the normal brains. Ammonia uptake was greatest in
gray matter. The ammonia utilization reaction(s) appears to take place in a compartment, perhaps in astrocytes, that includes <20% of all brain ammonia. In the
11 nonencephalopathic subjects the [NH3Ia was 100±8

,umol/min per whole brain; in the 11 encephalopathic
subjects these were respectively elevated to 149±18

(P <0.01). In normal subjects, -50% of the arterial
ammonia was metabolized by skeletal muscle. In

velopment of hyperammonemic encephalopathy with

INTRODUCTION
Ammonia,1 one of the principal products of nitrogen
metabolism, is normally converted to urea, in the liver,
by a series of enzymatic reactions. Liver disease and
congenital or acquired defects in the urea cycle may
cause elevations in the blood ammonia concentration
(1-4). Ammonia is highly neurotoxic and, along with
other factors, undoubtedly contributes to the development of encephalopathy and coma that is often a terminal event in patients with severe liver disease (1, 2).
Because the concentration of ammonia in hepatic
portal vein blood is normally 5-10 times greater than in
mixed venous blood, the gastrointestinal tract is presumed to be the site of most ammonia production (5).
Although much of the ammonia in the hepatic portal
system is metabolized by the liver, little direct information is available concerning the metabolism of ammonia in the systemic circulatory system (5-10). Accordingly, we have studied the metabolic fate of intravenously injected 13N-ammonia, in 5 normal subjects
and 17 patients with liver disease. '3N is a positronemitting isotope (tl/2 = 10.0 min) that gives rise to annihilation gamma ray photons with an energy of511 Kiloelectron volts; its rate of clearance from blood (metabolism), rate of utilization by the brain, and equilibrium
distribution in the body can be studied with appropriate external imaging and counting equipment with
little invasiveness.
1 Throughout this report the term "ammonia" will be used
to refer to the sum of the ammonia gas and ammonium ion
content of an aqueous solution at a given pH. The gas or the
ion will be referred to specifically.

METHODS
Subject selection antd evaluation. All procedures described in this report and the methods for obtaining consent
from the patients and their families were reviewed and
approved by the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center
Human Rights in Research Committee and by the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Clinical Investigation Committee and Committee on Radioactive Materials, New York.
On the basis of a history, review of clinical records, and
physical and neurological examinations, all subjects were
placed in one of four groups: (a) normal controls were free of
liver and central nervous system disease; (b) subjects with
mild liver disease had hepatomegaly or abnormal liver function tests, but did not have evidence of cirrhosis and had
never required hospitalization for the diagnosis or treatment
of liver disease; (c) subjects with severe liver disease had
cirrhosis of the liver, portal hypertension, and had required
hospitalization for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy,
ascites, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage because of ruptured
esophageal varices; (d) subjects with malignant neoplasms
had metastases in the liver, without evidence of metastases in
the central nervous system. The degree of encephalopathy was
graded in all subjects with liver disease using the following
criteria: 0, no evidence ofencephalopathy; 1, mild encephalopathy, with slight confusion, lethargy, and slurred speech; 2,
moderate encephalopathy, with lethargy, disorientation,
asterixis, hyper-reflexia, and hyperventilation; 3, severe encephalopathy, with no meaningful response to verbal stimuli
but appropriate responses to noxious stimuli. No deeply unresponsive patients were included in the study.
Subjects were studied when they were available and no
dietary restrictions were imposed before the investigation.
Several subjects with liver disease were on low protein diets
and were being treated with oral neomycin. Those recovering
from an episode of hepatic encephalopathy were usually receiving intravenous fluids, oral antibiotics, and enemas.
Isotope production and assay mnethods. '3N-Ammonia was
produced by the 160(p,a)13N nuclear reaction, using a water
target and a proton beam from a cyclotron, as described by
Gelbard et al. (11). The 13N-ammonia, produced by this
method, is essentially radiochemically pture and carrier-free.2
The isotope was collected in phosphate-buffered, 0.9% sodium
chloride, pH 7.2, and passed through a Millipore filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.). A portion of the dose was diluted
to 10.0 ml with 0.9% sodium chloride, and the activity was
measured, using constant geometry, in an ion chamber. The
dose was injected intravenously when it decayed to 10.0 mCi
or less.
The arterial ammonia concentration was measured in two to
three blood samples that were collected at intervals during
1 h required to complete the study. Blood samples were immediately deproteinized with 1.2 M perchloric acid. The
supernatant solution was neutralized with 2.0 M KHCO3,
stored at -80°C, and assayed for the ammonia content using
the enzymatic fluorometric method of Folbergrova et al. (12).
The mean arterial ammonia concentration was used in all calculations for each study.
The total blood volume was measured in 14 subjects, using
'25I-radioiodinated serum albumin, by the New York Hospital
Nuclear Medicine Laboratory, New York.

supine position on a scanner table, and after the adequacy of

the ulnar arterial blood supply to the hand had been established with an Allen test, a 20-gauge, nontapered Teflon
Longdwell catheter (Becton, Dickinson & Co., Rutherford,
N. J.) was percutanieously inserted into the left radial
artery, using a local anesthetic and an aseptic techlni(quie.
The catheter was irrigated frequently with 0.9% sodium
chloride containing 100 U. S. Pharmacopeia U of heparin/ml. A
scalp vein needle was inserted into a large peripheral vein
in the right arm and was used for the 13N-ammonia injection.
At the beginning of the study, the subject's head was placed
under an Anger-type gamma camera (13), in the left lateral
position. The gamma camera was activated at the same instant
that the isotope (10.0 mCi) was injected into the peripheral
vein. Serial arterial blood samples (0.2 g) were collected from
the radial artery catheter beginning -0.20 min after the injection. 25 blood samples were collected in tared tubes in the first
2.5 min after the injection; additional samples (0.5-1.0 g) were
collected 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 min after the injection. All
sample collections were timed to the nearest 0.01 min. Blood
activity was measured with a Packard gamma spectrometer
(Packard Instrument Co., Inc., Downers Grove, Ill.) and corrected for isotope decav to the time of injection. The sample
weight was determined and blood activity was calculated as
counts per time per volume, using the nomogram of Vani Slyke
et al. (14) to convert blood weight to volume.
Head imaging was completed 10 min after the injection of
the isotope, and the subject was moved to the Sloan Kettering
Institute High Energy Gamma (HEG)3 rectilinear scanner. A
body scan covering the area from the head to the lower thigh
was obtained, using appropriate collimators and a 2.0 x 2.0-
cm scan element size (15, 16). The body scan was started
15-20 min after the injection of the isotope and required
30-40 min to complete, depending on the size of the
subject.
Head and body images were generated on a storage oscilloscope, using increasing dot densities (16 levels were available) to show increasing levels of 13N activity. When more than
16 levels of activity were required for an image, the dot
density was "recycled" and the 17th level of activity had the
same dot density as the first.
Calculation of ammoniai clearance rate. In the steady
state, the rate of removal of a compound from the vascular
compartment, or clearance, can be calculated by dividing the
tracer dose by the integral of the specific activity curve for the
tracer (17). The specific activity of arterial '3N-ammonia
was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity due to metabolized 13N-ammonia from the measurement of the total radioactivity of arterial blood. Nonammonia activity was defined as
13N activity that was not volatile in a strong potassium carbonate solution. Heparinized arterial blood samples (1.0 ml)
were collected 3, 5, 7, and 10 min after the injection of the
isotope from subjects Nos. 5, 7, 8, 21, and 22B, and added to
an equal volume of a saturated aqueous potassium carbonate
solution in the outer ring of a Conway diffulsion chamber
(Fisher Scienitific Co., Pittsburgh, Pa.). After 20 mmi of
conistant agitation at room temperature, the radioactivity
of 1.0 ml of the alkalinize10 blood soluitioni was measuired.
Under these conditions, 85% of the 13N-ammonia adlded
to heparinized blood in vitro was volatilized. This measuirement was repeatecl andl uised as the conitrol for each
volatilization yield.
The nonvolatile 13N activity in blood was assumed to be
zero when the intravenously injected 13N activity was first detectable in arterial blood. When metabolized '3N activity was

expressed as a percent of the total activity, a linear relationship was found up to the 10th min after the injection:
percent metabolized = 10.13 (minutes after injection) - 0.88,
r = +0.85, P < 0.005. The integral of the metabolized 13N activity accounted for 21-24% of the value of the integral of the
total 13N activity between 0 and 10 min after the injection of
the isotope. For the investigations in which the metabolized
13N activity was not measured directly, this linear relationship
was evaluated at 3, 5, 7, and 10 min, integrated from 0-10
min, and subtracted from the integral of the total arterial
13N activity. Because the specific activity of 13N-ammonia approached zero 10 min after the injection ofthe isotope (see Fig.
1), the integral of the specific activity of ammonia from 0 to
10 min is a valid approximation of the value of the integral of
the total specific activity curve. Accordingly, this time frame
was used in all clearance measurements and calculations.
Measurement of organ-specific 13N content. The data obtained from the body scans were used to calculate organspecific 13N contents. Both absolute and relative quantitation
methods were employed. In the absolute quantitation studies,
the summed count rate in the brain was compared to the
summed count rate of a human skull filled with aqueous '8F.
The validity of this approach has been proven in the case of
splenic sequestration of 51Cr (15, 16). In the relative quantitation studies, the summed count rate in the organ of interest is
expressed as a percent of the summed count rate in the
whole scan.
The collimators used in this study were designed to have a
uniform sensitivity and resolution, regardless of the position
of a source between the detectors. To evaluate the uniformity of the system, the sensitivity (integral of the linespread function) and the resolution (full width at half
maximum) were measured as the detector pair was moved

across a line source filled with 18F. The position of the source
was varied within a 16-cm block of tissue-equivalent material
(Mix D [18]). Although the resolution was best when the
source was closest to either detector, the difference between
the maximum and minimum values (2.1 vs. 1.8 cm) was 14%.
There were similar variations in the sensitivity. This degree of
variation is comparable to that reported by Kuhl et al. (19)
for head images obtained with the Mark IV tomographic
system.
The method of absolute quantitation was used to measure
the total brain activity at equilibrium in 5 subjects (Nos. 5, 7,
8, 14, and 22A). For these measurements the head only was
scanned. Care was taken to place the skull phantom and the
test subjects in exactly the same position to avoid errors resulting from differences in geometry. With the exception of the
absent skin and muscle that surround the brain, the photon
attenuation by the phantom should be very similar to that in a
subject. This factor and the constancy of geometric variables
that affect the depth-dependent variations in the sensitivity
and resolution, should permit a measurement of the total
amount of 13N in the brain with an error -10%.
A method of relative quantitation was used to calculate the
brain activity for each of the same five subjects. The summed
count rate over the brain was divided by the summed count
rate in the complete scan. This quotient should equal the
fraction of the dose in the brain. The relative constancy of
brain size, skull configuration, and density should have produced only small variations in attenuation of the highenergy y-ray photons in the head. Morphological differences
between subjects (short vs. tall, cachexia vs. massive ascites)
could cause much larger variations in photon attenuation and,
secondarily, errors in the determination of the summed couint
rate in the complete scan. To determine the importance of this
problem, the summed count rate in the scan was plotted as a
function of the injected 13N-ammonia activity, decaycorrected to the time of the scan. There was a linear relationship between these two variables with a high correlation coefficient, r = +0.98. The high degree of correlation implied
that the total summed count rate in the scan was a valid
measure of the total amount of'3N in each subject. However, it
was recognized that the ratio of the brain region count rate and
the total body count rate would not necessarily equal the fraction of the injected dose actually present in the brain. An
independent measure of brain 13N content that does not depend on external scanning is not available; however, the absolute quantitation method outlined previously is valid on
theoretical grounds and was used to help determine the relationship between the relative activity and the true activity.
When the results of the relative and absolute methods vere
compared for these five subjects via a paired t test, there was
no significant difference between the methods. Accordingly,
the method of relative quantitation was used for all organ
activity calculations.
The favorable conditions that permitted the application of
the relative method for the determination of brain 13N content
do not hold for axial body organs, because of the greater
variability in the positioning of these organs and in the
amount of attenuiating tissue. Phantom studies indlicated that the
errors in the measurement of liver and urinary bladder activity
are =20%.

severe liver disease had end-to-side portacaval shunts
constructed 1 wk to 5 yr before this investigation.
13N-Ammonia clearance from the vascutlar comnpartment. After an intravenous bolus injection of 13Nammonia, the tracer was rapidly cleared from the vascular compartment. Labeled metabolites of ammonia
were detectable in arterial blood within 3 min of the injection, and by the 10th min after the injection, all of
the '3N activity in arterial blood wvas present as an
ammonia metabolite (Fig. 1). The 13N content of arterial
blood remained nearly constant between the 10th and
20th min after the injection. In the 14 subjects where
the blood volume was measured, 6.3+0.3% of the injected dose was present in the vascular compartment
20 min after the injection. When the ammonia clearance
rate was calculated and plotted as a function of the
arterial amimoniia concentration, a linear relationship
was present (P < 0.001) in the concentration range
encountered in these subjects (Fig. 2). These results
indicate that ammonia clearance is a first order process
at normal and moderately elevated arterial amtnonia
concentrations.

subject (No. 3), and the radioactivity of the brain, liver,
thigh, and urinary bladder was monitored for the next
50 min with stationary NaI(T1) probes (Fig. 3). The
data showed that the distribution of 13N activity in these
regions was reasonably constant (±5% for brain)
during the period of time required to complete the
HEG body scan (i.e., from approximately the 15th to
50th min after injection).
Technically satisfactory body scans were obtained in
22 of the 23 studies. The brain, liver, and urinary bladder all contained substantial amounts of 13N activity,
and the outline of these organs was seen without difficulty (Fig. 4). Other structures, known to accumulate
13N-ammonia, such as the heart and the kidneys (11),
were not well visualized because of methodologic
limitations.
The results of the organ 13N activity distribution calculations are shown in Table II. When all of the subjects were considered as a group, the brain contained
7.4±0.3% of the 13N activity. The brains of the normal
subjects contained 6.9±0.5%, and the brains ofthe subjects with severe liver disease contained 7.7±0.3%.
The brains of the subjects with severe liver disease and
a history of hepatic encephalopathy contained 8.1
±0.3% (P < 0.1, compared to normals by a two-tailed
t test). The trend toward an increase in the brain activity with severe liver disease may be the result of
cachexia and a secondary redistribution of 13Nammonia.
The bladder and urine of the normal subjects contained 6.4±0.1% of the scan activity. This was de-

associated with cirrhosis (20). The fraction of the dose
taken up by the liver, excluding the two subjects with
metastatic cancer, appeared to be a function of liver size:
uptake (%) = 0.07 (liver area in Cm2) - 1.2, r = +0.85,
P < 0.005.
The 13N activity in the brain, liver, blood, and bladder
with its contents accounted for 29±+4% of the total
amount of the isotope in the scans. Because animal
studies have shown that skeletal muscle traps significant amounts of ammonia (21), an attempt was made to
measure muscle uptake in some subjects. The distribution of radioactivity in the thigh, a region that is predominantly muscle, most closely resembled the
expected distribution of muscle radioactivity in a twodimensional projection (i.e., uniformly distributed over
the thigh, and not concentrated in the center or at the
margins as would be expected if the activity were
localized in bone or skin, respectively). Accordingly,
the 13N activity was measured in an 8 x 8-cm area
in the middle of the thigh. In the normal subjects, thigh
measurements indicated that this area corresponded to
about 1 kg or -3.3% of the total muscle mass of a normal
subject (22). Because this area was found to contain
1.7+±0.1% ofthe scan 13N activity (Table II),-=50% of all
of the 13N-ammonia must have been trapped by skeletal
muscle in the normal subjects. Cachexia probably
caused the reduction in uptake observed in this area in
the patients with severe liver disease (1.2+0.1% of the
scan 13N activity).

the head were recorded in 21 studies and included
images of 4 normal subjects. Fig. 5a -d shows a schematic drawing of the major organs in the head, a scintigraph of a normal subject, and the scintigraphs of a patient (No. 22) that were studied during mild and severe
encephalopathy. The areas with the highest 13N activity
were those that corresponded to the projections of the
regions where gray matter content was maximal (Fig.
5b). The four normal subjects were consistent in regard
to this distribution of radioactivity. However, the
images of patients with liver disease were more variable and often showed a striking redistribution of the
activity, as exemplified by the patterns obtained with
patient No. 22 (Figs. 5c and d). The reduction in
the "3N-ammonia uptake into the parietal region of this
subject was seen in association with an exacerbation of
her encephalopathy. Similar, but less marked differences were observed in subjects Nos. 11 and 14 who
had chronic, grade 1-2 encephalopathy and were
receiving optimum medical treatment.
The rate at which blood-borne ammoniia is trapped by
the brain can be calculated if the rate of irreversible
removal of 13N-ammonia from the blood and the fraction of the total 13N-ammonia dose trapped by the brain
are both known (17). This calculation requires two assumptions: (a) The body is a closed system for 13N
metabolism during the time required to complete the
study; (b) '3N-Ammonia is irreversibly lost from the
vascular compartment and is trapped by the various
body organs. The finding that organ radioactivity remained essentially constant after 15 min (Fig. 3) supports
the first assumption; activity measurements of the brain
after the administration of '3N-ammonia (Fig. 3; 23)
indicate that the ammonia taken up by brain remains essentially irreversibly trapped. The rate of removal of
13N-ammonia from the vascular compartment is the
clearance rate (micromoles per minute); this has been
measured as described. The fraction of the isotope that
was trapped by the brain was determined from the
HEG scan data (percent activity per brain). The product
of these two variables yields the brain ammonia
utilization rate (BAUR) and has the units of micromoles
per minute per whole brain. It should be noted that this
approach does not require a knowledge of the specific

activity of ammonia in the brain or of the factors that
affect the transfer of ammonia across the blood-brain
barrier.
The calculated BAUR values for blood-borne ammonia, obtained for the 22 body scans, are plotted in
Fig. 6 as a function of each individual's plasma ammonia concentration. The demonstration of a linear
relationship between these two variables indicates that
the BAUR is a first order process, at least in the range
of plasma ammonia concentrations encountered in this
study: BAUR (,umol/min per whole brain) = 0.38
([NH4+]a) - 3.6, r = +0.93, P < 0.001. The findings
provide additional support for the hypothesis that
ammonia is an important neurotoxin that contributes to
the production of hepatic encephalopathy. Subjects
without encephalopathy (n = 11) had a mean arterial
ammonia concentration of 100+8 uM and a BAUR of
32+3 ,umol/min per whole brain. The encephalopathic
subjects (n = 11) had significantly higher arterial ammonia levels (149± 18 ,tM; P < 0.01) and higher brain
ammonia utilization rates (53+7 ,tmol/min per whole
brain; P < 0.01).
Potenttial sources of error. There are two potential
sources of error in the present calculations of organ
uptakes in addition to those already discussed. (a)
The measured brain activity includes contributions
from blood, scalp, and superficial muscle activity as
well as brain. (b) The omission of the lower legs from
the body scans tends to increase the apparent uptake of
13N activity by the various organs, because these are expressed as percent of body uptake. On the basis of
measurements of cerebral blood volume (24), measurements of the incorporation of 13N-ammonia into muscle
(Table II) and into scalp and bone of rats,4 and measurements of muscle mass made on leg amputation
specimens,5 these sources of error have been estimated
and are all <5%. Consequently, they have been
ignored.
DISCUSSION
Brain ammoniia nmetabolism. In humans, direct
measturemiients of' the arterial andcl cerebral venous
concentration differences for ammonia have failed to
show a consistent pattern for brain ammonia metabolism. Although most data indicate that the brain extracts a small fraction of the ammonia present in arterial
blood (25, 26), other data show no extraction or ammonia production (27). The failure to demonstrate that
ammonia enters the brain has been cited as a weakness
in the hypothesis that hyperammonemia produces
hepatic encephalopathy (2). The present findings show
that arterial ammonia is taken up and used by the
brains of all subjects, and that the rate of utilization increases as a linear function of the arterial

ammonia concentration. This information, along with
the fact that subjects with hepatic encephalopathy had
higher arterial ammonia concentrations and BAUR
compared to nonencephalopathic subjects, strengthens
the hypothesis that hyperammonemia is important in
the production of hepatic encephalopathy.
Although the brain contains enzymes that are capable
of using and releasing ammonia (6, 28), there is little
direct information concerning the relative activity of
these metabolic pathways. The data of Fazekas et al.
(25), obtained by direct measurement of the arterial (a)
and cerebral venous (v) ammonia concentrations, show
that the brains of alert patients extract 11±+-2% of the
ammonia in arterial blood, ([a-v]/a). On the assumption
that normal adults have a cerebral blood flow of 55 ml/
100 g per min (26) and a brain weight of 1,400 g (men) or
1,260 g (women) (29), it is possible to calculate the
cerebral venous ammonia concentration by equating
the BAUR with the product of blood flow and the
cerebral arterio-venous concentration difference for
ammiioinia (BAUR = cerebral blood flow x [a-vlammonia).
The fraction of the ammonia extracted by the brain can
then be calculated. In the five normal subjects, 47+±3%
of the ammonia was extracted, a value similar to that
measured in rhesus monkeys (23). The apparent
conflict between the chemical data, a measure ofthe net
extraction, and the tracer data, a measure of the forward
flux across the blood-barrier, can be explained by
assuming that the brain produces and consumes
ammonia under normal conditions. If the rate of
production is 80% of the rate of utilization, extractions
of 11 and 47%, respectively, would be measured by
these two methods.
The rapidity with which ammonia irreversibly enters
the brain, combined with the measurements of the
BAUR, suggests that ammonia metabolism, like that of
glutamate and glutamine (28, 30), is compartmented in
the brain. If one assumes that ammonia is as free to
diffuse out of the brain as it is to diffuse in, persistence
of the label in the brain (see Fig. 3) as the blood 13NAmmonia Metabolism in Man 457

ammonia specific activity falls rapidly (90% in 1 min;
see Fig. 1) indicates that the brain has trapped the
ammonia. The size of the pool that is labeled by bloodborne ammoniia can b)e estimlated from the BAUR data.
A hypothetical normal male with an arterial ammonia
concentration of 100 ,uM should have 175 g.mol of
ammonia in his brain (based on a 1.4 kg brain weight
[29] and a blood:brain ammonia ratio of 1.00:1.25
calculated from data obtained in rats [31]). Our data
predict a BAUR of 33.9 ,umol/min per whole brain for
such an individual. If the '3N-ammonia that entered the
brain equilibrated with the whole brain ammonia pool,
the brain 13N content would be expected to fall during
the period of the rapid decrease in the arterial 13Namnonioiia specific activity, because onlly 34/175 or 1/5 of
the 13N-tagged ammonia pool would be metabolically
trapped in that 1-min period. Because this was not
observed, the maximum size of this compartment must
be less than or approximately equal to the amount of
ammonia metabolized during the period of the most
rapid f;all in blood activity, i.e., -l min. Thus this
compartment should contain 33.9 /umol or less of
ammonia, or <20% of the total brain ammonia pool.
This small ammonia pool may be in the astrocytes,
because most of the ammonia that enters the brain
amidates glutamate to form glutamine (28, 32), and
glutamine synthetase is an astrocytic enzyme (33).
Phelps et al. (23) have suggested that variations in
local capillary density are largely responsible for differences in regional cerebral ammonia uptake. However, most of the ammonia taken up by the brain is
rapidly incorporated into the amide nitrogen of glutamine (28, 32), suggesting that metabolic factors also
influence cerebral ammonia uptake. Because altered
brain metabolism is a hallmark of hepatic encephalopathy (1, 2, 26, 34), the regional differences in
cerebral 13N-ammonia uptake observed in some
encephalopathic subjects (Fig. Sc and d) are likely to be
a result, in part, of metabolic abnormalities. Cerebral
ammonia uptake is thus probably controlled by a complex interaction of metabolic and anatomic factors.
Systemic ammonia metabolism. The quantitative
data from this study permit the expansion of previous
models of human ammonia metabolism (5) by including
the amount and rate of ammonia metabolism that proceeds via the systemic vascular pool, and by emphasizing the importance of skeletal muscle in the intermediary metabolism of ammonia. The systemic
vascular pool is the central point in this proposed
model (Fig. 7). The five normal subjects had a mean
arterial ammonia concentration of 98 + 7 ,uM and a mean
rate of clearance of ammonia from the vascular compartment of 460+60 ,umol/min or 0.66+0.09 mol/d.
These values do not include the ammonia metabolized
by the liver via the hepatic portal vein, and therefore
represent a minimum value for the total amount of
FIGURE 7 Human ammonia metabolism. Most ammonia is
formed in the colon by the action of bacterial urease and
amino acid oxidase; the brain, kidney, and skeletal musele
are also sites of ammonia production. Normal subjects detoxify
ammonia from the gastro-intestinal (G.I.) tract by conversion
to urea. Portacaval shunts direct ammonia into the systemic
circulation, causing hyperammonemia and an increase in the
BAUR. The rate of ammonia clearance from the blood is a
linear function of its arterial concentration; 50% of this
ammonia is taken up by skeletal muscle, the most important
organ in ammonia homeostasis in patients with portacaval
shunts.
ammonia metabolized by each subject. The five subjects with end-to-side portacaval shunts were all on
low protein diets (0-40 g/d), had a mean arterial
ammonia concentration of 135±7 ,umol/liter, and an
ammonia clearance rate of 680±55 ,umol/min, or 0.98
±+0.08 mol/d. Because the shunted patients did not have
a functioning hepatic portal system, these data more
nearly represent the net whole body ammonia
metabolic rate. Even with severe dietary protein
restrictions, -- mol of ammonia must be eliminated
from the body each day.
The importance of skeletal muscle in the maintenance of ammonia homeostasis is due to its
large mass, over 40% of the body weight in normal
humans (22). Although the liver is undoubtedly the
most important organ in the maintenance of physiological blood ammonia levels in normal humans, in
patients with advanced liver disease and portalsystemic shunting, ammonia-laden portal blood bypasses the liver and is diverted into the systemic
circulation. Under these circumstances, skeletal
muscle may become the most important organ in
ammonia homeostasis. The arterio-venous concentration difference for ammonia across normal resting
skeletal muscle is close to zero (35, 36), indicating
that there is no net production or utilization of
ammonia. Because there was metabolic trapping of 13N458 Lockwood, McDonald, Reiman, Gelbard, Laughlin, Duffy, and Plum

ammonia by muscle in every subject (Table II),
muscle, like brain, must continually use and produce
ammonia. In a further parallel with brain, skeletal
muscle contains glutamine synthetase (37), and data
obtained with rat skeletal muscle in vitro indicate that
the concentration of ammonia in the incubation
medium is the rate-limliting factor in muscle glutamiine
production (37). In patients with chronic liver disease
and hyperammonemia, the rates of ammonia uptake
from the plasma and of glutamine release by skeletal
muscle have been found to be increased (35, 36).
If ammonia entering the liver via the hepatic
artery was the only source of nitrogen for urea synthesis, the five patients with end-to-side portacaval shunts
would only be able to synthesize 0.05 mol of urea per
day (calculated from the data of Table II and Fig. 2).
Because this rate of urea formation is <10% of that
predicted in cirrhotic patients with shunts (20), other
nitrogenous compounds must be acting as precursors.
Glutamine, formed by skeletal muscle, brain, and other
organs during periods of hyperammonemia, is a likely
candidate in this regard. Gelbard et al. (11) have
shown that intravenously injected '3N-glutamine is
taken up by the liver in normal dogs. In experiments
in which 15N-glutamine was administered intravenously in rats, 15N-urea was recovered from the
liver within 10 min (7). Thus, in humans with hyperammonemia and portal-systemic shunting, skeletal
muscle and other organs may detoxify ammonia by converting it to glutamine. Glutamine, in turn, may be
carried to the liver and serve as a urea precursor,
possibly after deamidation.
Most of the effective treatments for acute or chronic
hepatic encephalopathy are directed toward reducing
the amount of ammonia that enters the systemic circulation from the gastrointestinal tract (1, 2). Our data suggest that the maintenance of a normal skeletal muscle
mass may also be important for reducing plasma ammonia. In an unselected series of patients who had
emergency portacaval shunts, severe muscle wasting
was associated with a worse prognosis for survival than
any of the other more usual indicators of severe
liver disease, including small liver size, presence of
ascites, and reversal of blood flow in the hepatic portal
vein (38). Fischer et al. (39) have recently suggested
infusing amino acids into patients with hepatic
encephalopathy to normalize the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. Garber et al. (37) have shown
that many of the amino acids in the infusion mixture
used by Fischer et al. (39), including isoleucine,
leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, valine, and
cysteine stimulate glutamine synthesis by skeletal
muscle. This may account for the reduction in blood
ammonia levels and the therapeutic effect of the amino
acid infusion that Fischer et al. (39) reported. Because
skeletal muscle metabolizes large amounts ofammonia,
reductions in its bulk may contribute to the development of hyperammonemia, particularly in the presence
of significant portal-systemic shunting.
