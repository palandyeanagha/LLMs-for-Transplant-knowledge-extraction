Abstract
In real-world clinical practice, the acceptance of anticoagulation therapy in the management of portal vein thrombosis
(PVT) in patients with cirrhosis is limited by the fear of an increased bleeding risk. Additionally, accumulating evidence
indicates that spontaneous recanalization of PVT may occur in the absence of antithrombotic treatment. Therefore, risk
stratification based on outcomes in such patients is crucial for determining a therapeutic strategy. In this paper, we
draw attention to the distinct clinical entity, “transient PVT” by introducing two cases with PVT that spontaneously
recanalized in the absence of antithrombotic treatment. We reviewed the available data regarding the probability of
and predictors for spontaneous recanalization of PVT. Available data suggest singling out transient thrombosis in the
natural history of PVT in patients with cirrhosis because of its prognostic and management implications.
Keywords: Portal vein thrombosis, Liver cirrhosis, Recanalization, Anticoagulation, Transient
Background
Anticoagulation therapy for portal vein thrombosis
(PVT) may be considered in patients with cirrhosis
based on the current practice guidelines and consensus
statements [1, 2]. Indeed, two recently reported
meta-analyses suggest that anticoagulation therapy improves the rate of portal vein recanalization and prevents
thrombus progression in such patients [3, 4]. Still, the
actual impact of recanalization on the clinical outcomes
remains to be clarified. In real-world clinical practice,
the acceptance of anticoagulation therapy for the management of PVT in patients with cirrhosis is limited by
the fear of an increased risk of bleeding [5]. Recently,
spontaneous recanalization of PVT has been reported by
several investigators in patients with cirrhosis who did
not receive any antithrombotic therapy [6–10]. Thus,
some patients who develop spontaneous portal vein
recanalization can avoid the exposure to anticoagulation
and its related risk of bleeding.
There is also evidence that occlusive PVT is associated
with a risk of bleeding from portal hypertension and
death in patients with liver cirrhosis [11, 12]. However,
available cross-sectional data do not allow clinicians to
determine whether the link is causal. In comparison with
occlusive thrombosis, the impact of partial PVT on the
prognosis of cirrhosis may be marginal. If this proves to
be true, the indication and timing for implementing
anticoagulation therapy should be discussed accordingly.
Therefore, stratification along the degree of PVT in patients with cirrhosis could become important for guiding
management, including a wait-and-see attitude, anticoagulation therapy, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt (TIPS) [13].
Key points
1. Risk stratification of portal vein thrombosis in liver
cirrhosis should be widely acknowledged.
2. Spontaneous recanalization of portal vein
thrombosis has been frequently observed in
liver cirrhosis.
3. Transient portal vein thrombosis should be
recognized as a distinct clinical entity in
liver cirrhosis.

4. A watchful waiting should be considered in
cirrhotic patients with recent portal vein
thrombosis unaccompanied by clinical progression.
5. Further research should actively explore the predictors
for transient portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis.
“Transient PVT” as a distinct entity
The term “clinically significant PVT” has been proposed
to identify the conditions in which the outcome of patients with cirrhosis is significantly compromised when
PVT is present and, therefore, would benefit from antithrombotic treatment [14]. At the opposite end of the
spectrum, some cases can develop spontaneous resolution of PVT in the absence of any antithrombotic
treatment (Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, such “transient PVT”
should be further singled out as a benign condition that
might not warrant immediate treatment.
Probability of transient PVT
Asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis has been well recognized. In about 1% of the healthy general population,
a venous thrombus in the leg, most cases of which occur
as an isolated calf vein thrombus, can be detected by
ultrasonography and has no clinical consequences during follow-up [15]. Also, asymptomatic pelvic vein
thrombosis following vaginal delivery does not appear to
have clinical consequences [16]. In addition, asymptomatic venous thrombi following orthopedic surgery [17]
and symptomatic distal venous thrombi [18, 19] may
resolve spontaneously without anticoagulation, which
suggests the probability of transient deep vein thrombosis. Such a phenomenon may also be observed in
cirrhotic patients where the fibrinolytic pathway is
deeply deranged (i.e., with increased tissue-type plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
levels and decreased plasminogen, alpha 2-antiplasmin,
and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor levels)
and a weak re-balance is established [20, 21].
Based on a previous systematic review of scientific
publications regarding PVT [22], an updated search
strategy of relevant items ([“portal vein thrombosis”]
AND [“recanalization” OR “resolution”]) in PubMed and
EMBASE databases, and the experiences of the current
authors, we summarized the data from three case
reports [23–25] and 14 cohort studies or randomized
controlled trials [6–10, 26–34] allowing evaluation of
“transient PVT” in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Because
we analyzed the natural history of PVT in cirrhosis, some
papers exploring the probability of portal vein recanalization after TIPS [35, 36] or partial splenic embolization
[37] were not considered in the current work.
Among the 14 cohort studies or randomized controlled trials, 0–70% of PVT events were transient. The
data were combined, and a proportion meta-analysis
demonstrated that the pooled incidence of transient
PVT was 39.8% (95% confidence interval 35.4–44.4%)
Fig. 1 Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans in a patient with transient PVT. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed in
February 2017 demonstrated mild ascites, patent intrahepatic portal vein branches and splenic vein, mild thrombosis within main portal vein and
superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and splenomegaly (panel a). Red arrows indicate mild thrombosis within the main portal vein and SMV. Notably,
thrombus occupied less than 10% of the vessel lumen. In the absence of antithrombotic therapy, repeated contrast-enhanced computed tomography
performed in April 2017 showed that intrahepatic portal vein branches, main portal vein, splenic vein, and SMV were patent (panel b). Red arrows
indicate patent main portal vein and SMV

(Fig. 3). There was a very remarkable heterogeneity
among studies (Cochran Q = 82.09, P < 0.0001; I
2 = 84.2%,
95% confidence interval 74.4–89.1%). The reasons why
the incidence of spontaneous recanalization was very heterogeneous among studies merited analyses.
First, a majority of studies (64.3%, 9/14) were retrospective
[9, 27–30, 32–34, 36]. Thus, the potential bias of patient
selection should be acknowledged. For example, in the
study by Chen et al. [27], 36 patients who did not receive
anticoagulation were selected from 257 patients with
cirrhosis and PVT. Furthermore, only 44.4% (16/36) of
patients underwent the second computed tomography
during follow-up to evaluate the portal vein recanalization.
In the study by Chung et al. [28], 14 patients who did not
receive anticoagulation were selected from 72 cirrhotic
patients with PVT. In the study by Luca et al. [36], 42 eligible patients were selected from 178 cirrhotic patients
with PVT. Maruyama et al. selected 150 patients with
virus-related cirrhosis from 1964 patients with cirrhosis
[9]. Notably, 341 patients were excluded due to insufficient
laboratory data. Furthermore, 4 of the 9 retrospective studies were published in abstract form [29, 30, 32, 34], in which
detailed information regarding patient characteristics, eligibility criteria, and extent/degree of PVT was unclear.
Second, two studies clearly included patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In a study by Chung et
al. [28], the proportion of HCC was up to 57%. The investigators stated that PVT should be non-malignant to
be taken into account. In another study by Hidaka et al.
[26], the proportion of HCC was 19.4%. The investigators stated that only patients with small HCC lesions
were included.
Third, three studies included only patients with
Child-Pugh class A and B [6, 30, 32] and reported a high
Fig. 2 Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans in a patient with transient PVT. Contrast-enhanced computed
tomography and magnetic resonance scans performed in 2016 demonstrated a partial thrombosis within the confluence of portal vein and
splenic vein (red arrows). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans performed in 2017 demonstrated that the
confluence of portal vein and splenic vein was patent (red arrows)

incidence of spontaneous portal vein recanalization. A
prospective cohort study by Nery et al. included mostly
Child-Pugh class A patients and reported a high
incidence of spontaneous portal vein recanalization in
partial PVT (70/101, 70%) [6]. Although the incidence of
spontaneous recanalization in occlusive PVT was not
explicitly reported in the text, it could be estimated to
58.8% (10/17) based on the supplementary material. Another two studies by Caracciolo [30] and Garcovich [32]
reported that the incidence of spontaneous portal vein
recanalization was 57.6% (8/14) and 33% (5/15), respectively. As previously shown, the severity of liver dysfunction was negatively associated with the portal vein flow
velocity [38], but positively associated with the risk of
PVT [39]. It is imaginable that spontaneous portal vein
recanalization may be easier in patients with relatively
well-preserved liver function.
Fourth, two non-randomized controlled studies reported a very low probability of transient PVT in patients who did not receive any antithrombotic treatment.
Francoz et al. conducted a retrospective comparative
study in patients listed for liver transplantation and did
not observe any events of spontaneous portal vein
recanalization (0/10, 0%) [33]. We noted that patients on
the waiting list for transplantation typically had more
advanced, decompensated cirrhosis or HCC than those
who were not listed for transplantation. Additionally,
thrombus progression developed in a high proportion of
patients (6/10, 60%). It should be noted that all patients
who did not receive any antithrombotic treatment had partial PVT, rather than occlusive PVT. Information regarding
follow-up duration and portal vein imaging plans was not
provided. Similarly, another prospective comparative study
by Senzolo et al. also observed a low incidence of spontaneous portal vein recanalization (1/21, 5%) and a high
incidence of thrombus progression (15/21, 71.4%) [31].
We note that a majority of patients who did not receive
any antithrombolytic treatment had partial PVT (67%).
Because both comparative studies aimed to explore the
efficacy of anticoagulation for PVT in liver cirrhosis,
the potential selection bias of control group should
not be ignored.
Therefore, the study design, patient characteristics, inclusion or exclusion of HCC, and severity of liver dysfunction
and PVT should be carefully considered in every individual
study when analyzing the probability of transient PVT.

Impact of transient PVT on clinical outcomes
Several studies evaluated the prognostic impact of de novo
PVT in liver cirrhosis [6, 8, 9]. Nearly all of them suggested no or marginal impact on the outcomes of liver
cirrhosis. Only one retrospective study by Luca et al.
analyzed the association of dynamic change of PVT with
clinical outcomes [10]. The investigators divided patients
into improved and stable/worsened PVT groups and
found that spontaneous improvement of PVT did not provide any benefit in terms of the development of liver
cirrhosis-related complications, liver transplantation, and
survival. Multivariate analysis showed that the severity of
cirrhosis as indicated by the Child-Pugh score at diagnosis
was the only independent predictor of survival and hepatic
decompensation. Therefore, current data suggested that
the management of liver cirrhosis and its major complications should be maintained regardless of change of PVT.
Predictors for transient PVT
The data regarding predictors for spontaneous recanalization or improvement of PVT are very scarce. Some
features from scattered case reports (Table 1) are summarized [23–25]. First, two patients had transient risk
factors for PVT, such as recent surgery (accidental gallbladder puncture during transjugular liver biopsy in the
case reported by Spahr et al. [23] and splenectomy in
the case reported by Lai et al. [24]). Unfortunately, the
presence of transient risk factors provoking PVT is not
specified in the cohort studies. Second, two patients had
non-occlusive PVT [24, 25], and one patient had no
information regarding the degree of PVT [23]. Thus,
PVT may be mild or moderate in patients who developed spontaneous recanalization of PVT. Third, two patients developed spontaneous recanalization of PVT
within 2 months after the diagnosis [23, 24] and one
patient within one year [25]. PVT may spontaneously
disappear during the short-term follow-up.
Furthermore, three cohort studies performed statistical
analyses regarding predictors for spontaneous portal
vein recanalization (Table 2). Their statistical results are
also summarized. Luca et al. analyzed the associations of
thrombus age (de novo vs. past PVT) and baseline clinical characteristics with regression of PVT [10]. No associated factors were found. Chen et al. also performed a
univariate analysis to explore the baseline predictors for
spontaneous recanalization of PVT [27]. Baseline predictors entered in the univariate analysis included age, sex,
severity of liver and renal function (i.e., bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, creatinine, and Child-Pugh and
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores),
esophageal varices, previous portal hypertension-related
bleeding, ascites and decompensation, location of
thrombosis (i.e., main portal vein, left portal vein, right
portal vein, splenic vein, and SMV), and portal
cavernoma. However, no significant predictors were
identified. Maruyama et al. evaluated the predictive role
of clinical and ultrasonic parameters in 42 patients with
de novo PVT [9]. Univariate analysis demonstrated that
the diameter and flow volume in the largest collateral
vessel at the time of diagnosis of PVT were negatively
associated with spontaneous improvement of PVT
(improved vs. stable/worsened: 3.6 mm vs. 7.7 mm;
141.1 ml/min vs. 451.6 ml/min).
In theory, the milder the severity of PVT, the higher
the likelihood of spontaneous portal vein recanalization.
Maruyama et al. provided raw data regarding association
of baseline degree (partial/non-occlusive vs. complete/
occlusive) and location (intrahepatic portal vein branch
vs. portal trunk vs. splenic vein vs. multiple vessels) of
PVT with follow-up evolution of PVT [9]. Neither degree
nor extension of PVT was significantly associated with
change of PVT. The proportion of partial thrombosis was
very similar between patients with improved and stable/
worsened PVT (80% [16/20] vs. 81.8% [18/22], P = 0.881).
The proportion of involvement of multiple vessels was
slightly lower in patients with improved PVT than in those
with stable/worsened PVT (25% [5/20] vs. 36.4% [8/22],
P = 0.426). Notably, no SMV involvement was observed
in the Maruyama study [9]. As recommended by the
European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)
Clinical Practice Guidelines [1], patients with SMV
involvement may be a specific group of patients who need
more aggressive antithrombotic treatment. Therefore,
Maruyama’s findings should be cautiously interpreted. In
addition, as mentioned above, two Italian studies by
Caracciolo [30] and Garcovich [32] from the same
affiliation provided data according to the degree of PVT.
Although the incidence of spontaneous portal vein
recanalization was higher in patients with a thrombus
occupation of < 50% than in those with a thrombus occupation of > 75% (57.6% [8/14] vs. 33% [5/15]), no statistically significant difference was observed (P = 0.198).
All in all, except for the ultrasonic parameters identified by Maruyama et al. that require prospective external
validation [9], no predictors for resolution of PVT have
been identified. In the future, the candidates for watchful
surveillance without anticoagulation therapy should be
actively explored.
Recurrence of PVT after spontaneous
recanalization
Two cohort studies reported close follow-up surveillance
data regarding thrombus recurrence after spontaneous
recanalization of PVT. In the retrospective cohort study
by Maruyama et al. [9], spontaneous portal vein recanalization was observed in 20 of 43 cirrhotic patients with
PVT. Among the 20 patients, 9 (45%) developed a
recurrence of PVT. The researchers did not identify any
Qi et al. BMC Medicine (2018) 16:83 Page 9 of 11

significant factors associated with the recurrence of
PVT. In the prospective cohort study by Nery et al. [6],
spontaneous portal vein recanalization after the diagnosis of PVT was observed in 89 of 101 patients with
non-occlusive PVT. Among the 89 patients, 70 (78.7%)
maintained the portal vein patency during the follow-up,
but 19 (21.3%) developed a recurrence of PVT. Considering the possibility of thrombus recurrence, the patients
should continue to monitor the portal vein patency after
spontaneous portal vein recanalization. Of note, an
international registry study suggested the lowest incidence of thrombotic recurrence in splanchnic vein
thrombosis patients with transient risk factors [40].
Conclusions
Based on the current data, a diagram depicting the natural
history of PVT in cirrhosis has been outlined to single out
transient PVT (Fig. 4). Transient PVT should be defined if
a thrombus within the portal vein spontaneously disappears during the short-term follow-up. According to the
available prospective and longitudinal data [6], a definition
for short-term follow-up may be less than 3 months. Preferably, the same (cross-sectional) imaging modality should
be used to scan these patients for progression of PVT. We
believe that the entity of transient PVT raises several
issues requiring specific studies before a management
scheme can be reasonably proposed: (1) the identification of accurate baseline predictors for spontaneous
short-term recanalization (including the extent/degree of
thrombosis); (2) the relationship of recanalization with
clinical outcomes; and (3) the efficacy of anticoagulation
therapy to prevent recurrent thrombosis and to impact
the outcomes. If the clinical situation favors watchful
waiting, patients with cirrhosis and recent PVT unaccompanied by clinical progression could be monitored
monthly for 3 months for extension/stability/regression of
thrombosis. Regarding candidates for liver transplantation,
anticoagulation should be considered at the first documentation of an extension of the thrombus. Additionally,
regardless of liver transplantation, anticoagulation might
be prompted in patients with extension of thrombosis to
SMV, with known thrombophilia, or with recurrent
thrombosis in the absence of contraindications [1].
Further clinical research in this area is clearly required.
