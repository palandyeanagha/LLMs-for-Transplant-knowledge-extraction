Abstract
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a systemic disorder with a complex multifactorial pathogenesis and heterogenous clinical manifestations. NAFLD, once believed to be an
innocuous condition, has now become the most common
cause of chronic liver disease in many countries worldwide.
NAFLD is already highly prevalent in the general population,
and owing to a rising incidence of obesity and diabetes
mellitus, the incidence of NAFLD and its impact on global
healthcare are expected to increase in the future. A subset of
patients with NAFLD develops progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure.
NAFLD has emerged as one of the leading causes of cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma in recent years. Moreover, HCC
can occur in NAFLD even in absence of cirrhosis. Compared
with the general population, NAFLD increases the risk of liverrelated, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. NAFLD is
bidirectionally associated with metabolic syndrome. NAFLD
increases the risk and contributes to aggravation of the
pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. In addition,
NAFLD is linked to colorectal polyps, polycystic ovarian
syndrome, osteoporosis, obstructive sleep apnea, stroke,
and various extrahepatic malignancies. Extended resection
of steatotic liver is associated with increased risk of liver
failure and mortality. There is an increasing trend of NAFLDrelated cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation, and the
recurrence of NAFLD in such patients is almost universal.
This review discusses the growing burden of NAFLD, its
outcomes, and adverse associations with various diseases.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by
accumulation of fat in $5% of hepatocytes in the absence of
significant alcohol consumption (<30 g/day for men and <20
g/day for women) or secondary causes of hepatic steatosis.1
Histologically, the spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple
steatosis (SS) that in some patients can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver failure.
NAFLD, once believed to be an innocuous condition, has
emerged as the leading cause of chronic liver disease in
many countries worldwide.2,3 NAFLD is now pandemic worldwide and its prevalence has increased considerably over the
last two decades.4–7
The changing epidemiology of NAFLD in Asia during the
past two decades is well-documented.4,6,7 NAFLD is strongly
associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), the components
of which include hypertension, hyperglycemia, abdominal
obesity, and dyslipidemia.8 However, NAFLD is not merely a
hepatic manifestation of MetS but rather both a consequence
as well a predecessor of MetS. Compared with the general
population, NAFLD patients are at increased risk of liverrelated, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. NAFLD has
been associated with a large number of extrahepatic conditions, such as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease
(CKD), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), obstructive
sleep apnea (OSA), extrahepatic malignancies, etc.9,10
Recent data suggest that NAFLD increases the susceptibility
and/or worsen outcome of acute pancreatitis (AP), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and osteoporosis.11–13
There is growing trend of patients with NASH-related
cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation (LT).14,15 The risk of
developing progressive liver disease and associated extrahepatic diseases presents a challenge to the healthcare system
to develop effective strategies in order to prevent an exponential increase in morbidity and mortality related to it. This
review will focus on the growing burden of NAFLD, its outcomes and adverse associations with various extrahepatic
diseases; of note, this review is not intended to discuss the
therapeutic aspects of NAFLD and its complications.
Global burden and rising prevalence
According to current estimate, the global prevalence
of NAFLD among the general population may be as high
as one billion.2 In a recent meta-analysis of 86 studies,

encompassing a sample size of 8,515,431 from 22 countries,
the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population was
25.24%, with the highest prevalence rates in the Middle
East and South America.5 That meta-analysis also demonstrated an increased prevalence of NAFLD, from 15% in
2005 to 25% in 2010, and comparable prevalence rates
between the West and the East.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) data collected from 1988 to 2008 show that the
prevalence of NAFLD has doubled in the USA during that time
period. From 1988 to 1994, NAFLD accounted for 46.8% of
chronic liver disease cases; from 1994 to 2004, its prevalence
further increased to 62.84%, and then to 75.1% from 2005 to
2008.16 NAFLD is no longer a disease confined to the Western
world, as studies from China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and India
have also found a high community prevalence of NAFLD,
ranging from 15–49.8%5,17 (Table 1). Current USA projections using a Markov model indicate a 21% increase in
NAFLD from 2015 to 2030, leading to a 33.5% overall prevalence by 2030. The projected increase in the prevalence of
NASH is 63%, which will cause a 168% increase in the
number of patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and a
137% increase in the numbers of patients developing HCC
by 2030.18 Thus, with growing prevalence rates of NAFLD
affecting both adults and children, it is likely to emerge as
the leading cause of end-stage liver disease in the years to
come.
Obesity and T2DM are important risk factors for NAFLD.
The prevalence of NAFLD is about 50–90% in obese subjects.19 The pooled prevalence of NAFLD in patients with
T2DM is 59.67% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.31–
64.92%) according to a meta-analysis of 24 studies.20 The
growing epidemic of obesity and T2DM have fueled an
increasing prevalence of NAFLD worldwide.19–23 Moreover,
obesity and T2DM also increase the risk of NAFLD progression
to NASH, cirrhosis, and HCC.22,23 In Asia, NAFLD can occur in
lean subjects with central obesity, which may be partly
because of a higher metabolic activity of visceral fat and
genetic predisposition, such as the patatin-like phospholipase
domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) polymorphism.24,25 It is worth
noting that a wide variation in clinical presentation and
sensitivity of diagnostic tools complicate diagnosis of NAFLD,
often leading to an underestimate of the actual disease
burden.
Progression of NAFLD
The natural course of liver disease progression in NAFLD is
still incompletely defined. A subset of such patients develops
progressive liver disease leading to NASH, cirrhosis, HCC, and
liver failure (Fig. 1). Though early studies in 1990’s suggested
that SS does not progress to NASH or cirrhosis, subsequent
studies with paired liver biopsies have shown that SS is more
progressive than originally believed.26–28 Apart from components of MetS, genetic polymorphisms, such as PNPLA3
I148M gene and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2
E167K gene variants, have a significant impact on NAFLD
susceptibility and progression.25 Identification of such variants may help to identify NAFLD patients at higher risk for
liver disease progression and HCC.
Progression from SS and NASH
Prospective studies have revealed progression from SS to
NASH in 23–44% of patients over a period of 26 months to
6.6 years.7,28 In a meta-analysis of 11 studies including 411
patients with paired liver biopsy performed at least 1 year
apart, liver fibrosis progression occurred not only in patients
with NASH but also in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver
(NAFL), defined as SS alone or associated with mild inflammation. One stage of fibrosis progression occurred over 14.3
years in patients with NAFL (95% CI: 9.1–50.0 years) and 7.1
years among patients with NASH (95% CI: 4.8–14.3
years).29 A very slow rate of progression of SS may partly
account for the discrepancy between clinical and histological
studies, as such patients may die from other causes before
developing advanced liver disease. In a systematic review of
10 studies, Argo et al. have found that 37.6% of 221 patients
with NASH had progressive fibrosis over a mean follow-up
interval of 5.3 years.30 A recent meta-analysis also revealed
occurrence of fibrosis progression in 41% of NASH patients,
with 20% of them identified as being rapid progressors.5 Yet

another study has revealed a rapid fibrosis progression in
one-third of NASH patients who had any-stage of fibrosis progression.31 To summarize, studies utilizing paired liver biopsies suggest that approximately 23–44% of patients with SS
progress to NASH and 37–41% of patients with NASH develop
progressive fibrosis.
NASH-cryptogenic cirrhosis
Clinical-histological study has revealed silent cirrhosis in 10%
(8/80) of NAFLD patients with normal liver enzymes.32
Around 9–25% of patients with NASH progress to cirrhosis
over a period of 10–20 years. In a recent study, French investigators identified 125,052 NAFLD/NASH patients from the
French National Database on Hospital Care, of whom 1.2%,
6.3%, and 0.9% were diagnosed with compensated cirrhosis,
decompensated cirrhosis, and HCC respectively. During 7
years of follow-up, 5.6% of the NAFLD/NASH patients progressed to cirrhosis and 27.5% of the compensated cirrhosis
patients developed decompensation.33 Powell et al.34 have
suggested that NASH should be recognized as a potential
cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC).
Many of the patients with CC have features of MetS in
varying proportions.35,36 However, needle biopsy studies
have failed to demonstrate histological features of NASH in
patients with CC. It seems that the features of NASH usually
regress concurrently with fibrosis progression.34,35 In contrast to studies based on needle biopsy samples, explants
from CC patients undergoing LT have revealed steatosis
(80%) and ballooning (70%) in a significant proportion.37 A
study from India that assessed explants from patients with CC
revealed NASH to be the etiology in 63% patients.38 Another
study of explants from CC revealed NASH to be the most
common etiology (33%).34 Moreover, the recurrence of steatosis in the allograft of CC patients is remarkably high (100%
in 5 years).39 Therefore, NASH-cirrhosis cases appear to constitute a significant proportion of patients previously labelled
as CC.
NAFLD and HCC
HCC is the second leading cause of cancer - related death
worldwide. NAFLD has emerged as one of the leading causes
of HCC in recent years. Multiple risk factors, such as components of MetS, ethnicity and hepatic siderosis, appear to have
an incremental effect on the risk of developing HCC among
NAFLD patients. The cumulative incidence of HCC in patients
with NASH-related cirrhosis is quite high, ranging from 2.4 %
over 7 years to 12.8 % over 3 years.40 However, alarmingly,
HCC can develop de novo in patients with NASH in the
absence of cirrhosis.41,42 Kawada et al.,
43 in a study of
1,168 HCC patients who underwent hepatic resection, found
NASH as an etiology of HCC in 8 patients, 6 of who (75 %) had
noncirrhotic NASH. Similarly, Takuma et al.44 reported 7 out
of their studied 11 (65%) patients with NASH-related HCC
had noncirrhotic liver. In a review of 94 published cases of
NASH-related HCC, the patients were found to be predominantly elderly males, with 26% having noncirrhotic liver and
the majority (69%) having large (mean size 3.5 cm) and multifocal HCC.44
Several reports have confirmed the increasing burden of
NAFLD - related HCC worldwide. A recent large population -
based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (known as
the SEER) study has demonstrated a 9% annual increase in
NAFLD-related HCC between 2004 and 2009.45 Dyson et al.46
noted a nearly 10 - fold increase in NAFLD - related HCC cases
in the UK from 2000 to 2010. Another study from a hepatitis B
- endemic area in Korea has also demonstrated an increasing
proportion of NAFLD - related HCC cases over time.47 Moreover, patients with NAFLD-related HCC had a shorter survival
time, more cardiovascular events, and more cancer-related
mortality than patients without NAFLD.48 In a study from
Germany, where 1119 patients with HCC treated in an 11
year period were retrospectively analyzed, the overall survival among the patients with NASH-related HCC (n = 45)
was lower compared to those with HCC of other etiologies.49
However, it appears that the worse natural history in such
patients is not related to a more aggressive behavior of
NAFLD - HCC, but mainly to detection at a later stage.
Long-term outcomes
Multiple studies have found that the overall mortality in
NAFLD patients is higher than that in matched individuals
from a healthy population.50–55 A community-based cohort

Kumar R. et al: NAFLD: a growing threat

study with mean follow-up duration of 7.6 years found that
mortality in NAFLD patients was significantly higher than in
the general population (standardized mortality ratio of 1.34;
95% CI: 1.003–1.76). Death was most commonly due to
malignancy and CVD.50 Using the third set of NHANES data,
Ong et al.51 found NAFLD to be associated with higher overall
(hazard ratio (HR): 1.038; 95% CI 1.036–1.041) and liverrelated (HR: 9.32; 95% CI 9.21–9.43) mortality compared
with the reference population. In both studies, liver disease
was the third leading cause of death among NAFLD subjects.
Two recent longitudinal studies have uniformly found that
stage of liver fibrosis irrespective of severity of hepatic necroinflammation is independently associated with overall and
disease-specific mortality in patients with NAFLD.50,53 In one
study involving 619 NAFLD patients with median follow-up
period of 12.6 years, the risk of death or LT (n = 193)
increased progressively with increasing stages of fibrosis
(HR for stage 1: 1.88, stage 2: 2.89, stage 3: 3.76, and
stage 4: 10.9). Patients with fibrosis, regardless of NASH,
had shorter survival times than patients without fibrosis.50
Another longitudinal study with mean follow-up of 26.4
years found that NAFLD patients (n = 229) had an increased
mortality compared with the reference population (HR: 1.29;
95% CI 1.04–1.59) and CVD constituted the most common
cause of death. Overall mortality was not increased in
patients with NASH and mild fibrosis, whereas patients with
fibrosis stage >2, irrespective of NASH, had increased mortality (HR: 3.3; 95% CI 2.27–4.76, p < 0.001).53
In a meta-analysis of seven studies with follow-up ranging
from 7.3–24 years, liver -elated mortality was higher in
patients with NASH compared to those with SS (OR: 5.71;
95% CI: 2.31–14.13).54 Kim et al.,
56 in a large prospective
cohort study of 11,154 USA adult participants from the
NHANES population found that NAFLD itself did not increase
the risk of mortality. However, advanced fibrosis, as determined by noninvasive fibrosis markers, significantly predicted
the mortality, mainly from CVD causes, independent of other
known factors. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of
five studies including 1,495 NAFLD patients with 17,452
patient years of follow-up, Dulai et al.57 found an increased
risk for all-cause mortality with increase in the stage of fibrosis, and such risk was more pronounced with regard to liverrelated mortality.
It appears that higher stages of liver fibrosis are a strong
determinant of all-cause mortality in NAFLD, most likely
because of the pronounced effect on liver-related mortality,
whereas CVD accounts for an increased proportion of mortality at lower stages of fibrosis. Thus, compared with the
general population, NAFLD increases the risk of liverrelated, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and the
impact of NAFLD on mortality appears to differ according to
its severity (Table 2). The disparity in estimates of risk across
studies might be attributed to variations in characteristics of
study populations or follow-up.
Extrahepatic association of NAFLD
NAFLD is closely associated with several extrahepatic diseases, such as T2DM, CVD, malignancy, CKD, OSA, and PCOS
(Fig. 2). These associations do not truly represent extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD. However, the implications of
such association may influence clinical evaluation and treatment decisions in NAFLD patients. Although these associations may result from common risk factors, there are lines
of evidence to suggest that NAFLD is associated with many
of these diagnoses, independent of traditional risk factors,
such as components of MetS. Also, for some of the diseases,
the association appears to be bidirectional. Therefore,
severity of NAFLD may influence the severity of associated
disease and vice versa. Similarly, management of one condition may influence management of the associated one.
T2DM
The association between NAFLD and T2DM is complex and
bidirectional. NAFLD is not only a consequence but also a
cause of T2DM. NAFLD is associated with increased risk of
developing DM after adjustment for several metabolic confounders.54,58,59 Two large meta-analyses have confirmed
the association between NAFLD and incident T2DM.54 In a
prospective study of 129 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients,
78% developed either T2DM (58%) or impaired glucose tolerance (20%) during the 13.7 years follow-up.58 Moreover,
the risk of incident T2DM was threefold higher among patients
with NASH compared to those with SS. Moreover, T2DM
increases the risk of NAFLD progression to NASH, cirrhosis,
and HCC.23
Because of systemic insulin resistance (IR), NAFLD
worsens the glycemic control in patients with T2DM. In
diabetic subjects, NAFLD increases risk of all-cause mortality
by 2.2-fold compared with those without NAFLD.60 NAFLD and
T2DM interact adversely to enhance the risk of atherosclerosis, CKD, and retinopathy.23 Substantial evidence links NAFLD
with an increased risk of developing CVD and arrhythmic
complications in patients with DM.61 Thus, the coexistence
of NAFLD and DM increases the risk of developing not only
the more severe forms of NAFLD but also the vascular complications of DM and all-cause mortality.
CVD
Several studies have unequivocally demonstrated a strong
association between NAFLD and increased risk of CVD. NAFLD
has been linked with increased biomarkers of endothelial
dysfunction,62 increased carotid artery intima-media thickness,63 increased arterial stiffness,64 coronary artery calcification,65 and impaired flow-mediated vasodilatation.66 A
recent meta-analysis of 27 studies supported the association
of NAFLD with markers of subclinical atherosclerosis independent of traditional CVD risk factors and MetS.67 Moreover,
persistent and progression of NAFLD is associated with
increased risk and progression of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis, in a study comparing to subjects without NAFLD and
those with regression of NAFLD.68
The widely prevalent dyslipidemia in NAFLD patients is
highly atherogenic, being characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and
low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol—all of which
are key risk factors for CVD.69 Studies in patients with NAFLD
have shown abnormal left ventricular morphology and diastolic dysfunction when compared with controls.70,71 Various
factors have been implicated in the causation of left ventricular dysfunction in NAFLD, including hyperinsulinemiainduced myocyte growth and interstitial fibrosis, alteration
in myocardial metabolism of fatty acids, upregulation of
angiotensin II (a neurohormone), decrease in myocardial
perfusion reserve, and increase in aortic stiffness.

Kumar R. et al: NAFLD: a growing threat

NAFLD is also associated with an increased risk of atrial
fibrillation.72 NAFLD has also been reported as independently
associated with QT prolongation.73 Notably, the duration of
the QT interval is a predictor for CVD death in the general
population, and a prolonged QT interval increases the risk of
cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.74
NAFLD contributes to the prothrombotic state by increasing plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, the

elevated levels of which are related to increased risk of
myocardial infarction.75 In a recent prospective study
among patients with clinical indication of coronary angiogram
(n = 612), the presence of NAFLD was associated with
severity of coronary artery stenosis and need for coronary
intervention.76 In a large meta-analysis of 164,494 participants from 21 cross-sectional and 13 cohort studies, NAFLD
was associated with an increased risk of incident (HR: 1.37;
95% CI: 1.10–1.72) and prevalent (OR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.23–
2.66) CVD but not with CVD mortality.77 However, there was
marked heterogeneity among studies and nonuniform definition of important variables, including DM, which could have
affected the results of mortality. Moreover, another metaanalysis of 40 studies assessing the natural history of
NAFLD revealed that patients with NAFLD, irrespective of SS
or NASH, had a considerably greater risk of CVD mortality
than the matched control population.54
Many prospective studies have demonstrated that CVDrelated death occurs in higher proportion than liver-related
death among patients with NAFLD.50,51 A meta-analysis of a
total 16 observational studies with 34,043 adult individuals,
including 36.3% NAFLD and approximately 2,600 CVD outcomes over a median period of 6.9 years, revealed that
NAFLD is significantly associated with an increased risk of
fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (OR: 1.64).
However, the observational design of the studies included
does not prove that NAFLD causes CVD.78 Thus, there
seems to be little doubt that NAFLD is associated with
increased incidence and prevalence of CVD, some controversies surround as to whether NAFLD by itself is associated with
increased CVD mortality. Also, whether the association
between NAFLD and CVD is because of the shared risk
factors or NAFLD itself confers an additional risk is the
subject of further extensive scrutiny.
Extrahepatic malignancy
NAFLD has been associated with several extrahepatic malignancies. Malignancy is among the leading cause of death in
NAFLD patients.50,51,54 In meta-analyses of seven longitudinal studies with follow-up ranging from 7.3 to 24 years,
malignancy was the most common (28%) cause of death in
NAFLD.54 In a recent longitudinal study comprising a community cohort of 4,722 NAFLD and 14,441 age- and sexmatched control subjects, 2,224 incident cancers occurred
during a median follow-up of 8 years and NAFLD was associated with 90% higher risk of developing cancers.79 The
highest increase in the risk was noted for HCC, followed by
uterine, gastric, pancreatic and colonic cancer. Moreover, the
association between obesity and cancer risk was small in the
absence of NAFLD, suggesting that NAFLD may potentiate
obesity-cancer relationship.79
In a cohort study of 129 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients,
5.6% of the patients with NASH died because of extrahepatic
malignancy during a mean follow-up of 13.7 years.58 Several
studies have found a higher prevalence of colorectal neoplasm in patients with NAFLD compared to patients without
NAFLD.80–82 A large cohort study (n = 5517) from Korea has
found a two-fold increase in the occurrence of colorectal
adenoma and a three-fold increase in the risk of colorectal
cancer in patients with NAFLD compared to controls.80
Another study revealed that among NAFLD, patients with
NASH have a higher prevalence of adenomas (51.0% vs.
25.6%) and advanced neoplasms (34.7% vs. 14.0%) than
those with SS. Moreover, NASH remained significantly associated with a risk of adenomas and advanced neoplasms after
adjusting for demographic and metabolic factors.81
In a retrospective cohort study on 1,522 subjects who
underwent two consecutive colonoscopies between 2003 and
2010, NAFLD was an independent risk factor (OR: 1.45; 95%
CI: 1.07–1.98) for adenoma formation after a negative
baseline colonoscopy.82 The adenoma group had a higher
prevalence of NAFLD than the non-adenoma group (55.6%
vs. 38.8%; p < 0.05). NAFLD patients are more likely to
have multiple polyps localized more often in the right hemicolon. In a case-control study, NAFLD was found to have a
significant association with breast cancer.83 NAFLD has also
been found to be associated with malignancy of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, kidney, and prostate.9,54,79
However, concurrent presence of features of MetS and too
little available data limit drawing definite conclusions about
a causal role of NAFLD in such association.

CKD
The link between NAFLD and CKD has drawn considerable
attention during recent times. Various studies have suggested that NAFLD can accelerate the development and
progression of CKD independent of traditional risk
factors.10,84,85 A recent meta-analysis, that included near
64,000 subjects, found that NAFLD was associated with an
approximately 2-fold increase in risk of both prevalent (OR:
2.12; 95% CI: 1.69–2.66) and incident CKD (HR: 1.79; 95%
CI: 1.65–1.95).84 Furthermore, histologically severe NAFLD
is more positively correlated with CKD. Both NASH and NAFLD
with advanced fibrosis are associated with a higher prevalence (OR: 2.53 for NASH, OR: 5.20 for advanced fibrosis)
and incidence of CKD (HR: 2.12 for NASH, HR: 3.29 for
advanced fibrosis), as compared to those with SS.84
In a large longitudinal study, NAFLD was found to be
associated with declining renal function in CKD patients
independent of traditional risk factors, and the association
was stronger in patients with advanced NAFLD.85 The pathophysiologic basis of the linkage between the two appear to be
multifactorial. The pro-inflammatory milieu in NAFLD along
with IR, dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, hypertension, and
the activated renin-angiotensin system may hasten the
development and progression of CKD. Compared to other etiologies of cirrhosis, the risk of CKD and requirement of simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation are greater in patients
with NASH-related cirrhosis.86 Furthermore, CKD may aggravate NAFLD through uremic toxins, intestinal dysbiosis,
altered gut-barrier function, and alterations in glucocorticoid
metabolism.87 Interestingly, there is evidence to suggest that
in patients with NASH, improvement in liver histology by lifestyle modification leads to improved kidney function.85
PCOS
PCOS is one of the most common endocrine disorders in
women during reproductive ages. It is associated with a
plethora of metabolic consequences, including glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and NAFLD. Several studies have consistently found that the prevalence and severity of NAFLD is
markedly increased in women with PCOS, independent of
coexisting features of MetS.88 A recent systematic review and
meta-analysis of 17 studies has revealed that PCOS patients
(n = 2,734) have increased prevalence of NAFLD (OR: 2.54,
95% CI 2.19–2.95) and the presence of NAFLD among them
is associated with hyperandrogenism, in addition to IR and
adiposity.89 The prevalence of NAFLD among women with
PCOS is estimated to vary from 15% to 55%, whereas
amongst the reproductive-aged women with NAFLD, the
prevalence of PCOS is as high as 71%.90
OSA
OSA is strongly associated with NAFLD independent of traditional risk factors. In a meta-analysis of over 2,000 subjects
from 18 studies, OSA was associated with an increased risk of
NAFLD (OR: 2.99), NASH (OR: 2.37), and advanced fibrosis
(OR: 2.30).91 This association is related to the degree of nocturnal hypoxemia caused by repetitive upper airway obstruction during sleep. Intermittent hypoxia can result in oxidative
stress, IR, abnormal lipid metabolism, overactivation of the
sympathetic nervous system, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, each of which plays important roles in
development and progression of NAFLD.92 Intermittent
hypoxia activates hypoxia-inducible factors, which leads to
increased synthesis of hepatic fat, upregulated hepatic
inflammation, and fibrosis. The chronic intermittent hypoxia
in morbidly obese subjects contributes to the severity of
hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis independent of
adiposity.93 Furthermore, NAFLD in patients with OSA is associated with higher CVD risks. Minville et al.94 have recently
demonstrated that in patients with OSA, hepatic steatosis was
independently associated with endothelial dysfunction after
adjustment for confounders. Therefore, among obese
patients with OSA, screening for the presence of underlying
NAFLD and subsequent monitoring for NAFLD progression
should be considered. In patients with NAFLD, treatment of
OSA with continuous positive airway pressure may impact
outcomes of future CVD.
Psoriasis
NAFLD is highly prevalent in patients with psoriasis. In a large
prospective population-based cohort study of 2,292 subjects
with 118 (5.1%) patients with psoriasis, NAFLD prevalence
was higher among those with psoriasis (46.2% vs. 33.3%)
even after adjustment for important risk factors.95 The prevalence of NASH in patients with psoriasis is much higher
(22%) than that in the general population (2–6%). Moreover,
data also suggest that the presence of NAFLD may increase
severity of psoriasis.96,97 Future studies are needed to assess
whether there is a causal relationship between NAFLD and
psoriasis.
Osteoporosis
Several studies have demonstrated that NAFLD patients have
lower bone mineral density compared to non-NAFLD subjects.98 In a study from China, NAFLD was independently
associated with a ;2.5-fold increased odds of osteoporotic
fractures among men.99 A recent meta-analysis of six
studies has revealed that obese children with NAFLD are
more susceptible to osteoporosis than children with only
obesity.13 The potential contribution of NAFLD to development of osteoporosis warrants further study. Chronic inflammatory processes, vitamin D deficiency, disturbances of
growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 axis are the proposed pathophysiological factors linking NAFLD with
decreased bone mass.
Sarcopenia
NAFLD has been recently associated with sarcopenia which is
defined as a generalized, and progressive and loss of skeletal
muscle mass, quality, and strength.100,101 Sarcopenia is
associated with increased risks and histological severity of
NAFLD, independent of obesity and metabolic risk
factors.100 In a longitudinal study, Kim et al.101 has demonstrated that increases in relative skeletal muscle mass over
time had significant beneficial association with incident
NAFLD (adjusted HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.59–0.82) and resolution of baseline NAFLD (adjusted HR: 4.17; 95% CI: 1.90–
6.17). The pathophysiological mechanisms linking sarcopenia
and NAFLD may include IR and chronic inflammation. IR promotes accumulation of triglycerides in muscles and exacerbates protein catabolism in association with the chronic
inflammatory milieu, leading to muscle depletion.

CVA
NAFLD appears to be associated with an increased risk and
severity of stroke as well as with a worse functional outcome
in stroke patients. In a prospective study including a total of
25,800 subjects, Hadda et al.102 found an increased frequency of CVA in NAFLD compared to the controls. A metaanalysis of seven studies with a total of 6,183 subjects
revealed a significant association of NAFLD with elevated
risk of CVA.12 Also, there are data to suggest a role of
NAFLD in subclinical ischemic stroke and cognitive impairments.102 These observations are clinically relevant because
strategies to prevent the progression of asymptomatic brain
lesions to overt CVA can be explored in patients with NAFLD.
Further studies are warranted to throw more light on these
aspects.
AP
NAFLD increases the severity of AP. A recent study demonstrated that the presence of NAFLD at admission portends a
higher risk of severe and moderately severe AP, as well as a
higher risk of organ failure.11 The mechanism by which NAFLD
exacerbates pancreatitis remains unclear. The potential
reasons could be imbalance of adipocytokines, increased
activity of hepatic Kupffer cells, and reduction of alpha-1-antitrypsin levels. Pancreatic steatosis, which is frequently associated with NAFLD, may lead to a higher incidence of AP and
may be an etiological factor in pancreatic cancer.
Surgical implications of NAFLD
Post-liver resection liver failure
A normal liver has remarkable capacity to regenerate, which
makes it possible for surgeons to do a large liver resection
without causing significant hepatic impairment. However,
extended liver resection may lead to the development of
progressive liver failure in the postoperative period which is
associated with very high mortality rate.103 Steatotic liver
have poor ability to regenerate and reduced tolerance
against ischemic injury. Therefore, patients with NAFLD are
at higher risk of post-liver resection liver failure. In a series of
135 patients who had undergone major hepatic resection at
the Mayo Clinic, acute liver failure occurred in 14% of patients
with fatty liver versus 4% in those with normal liver.104 In a
cohort of 478 liver resection patients, Belghiti et al.105 demonstrated that steatosis was an independent risk factor for
postoperative complications. Another study on outcome
after liver-resection for colorectal liver metastases in 406
patients has found that patients with steatohepatitis have a
significantly higher 90-day mortality than those without it
(14.7 vs. 1.6%; OR: 10.5).106 In conclusion, major hepatic
resection of steatotic liver, particularly in patients with NASH,
is associated with increased risk of liver failure and death.
Influence on LT
Transplantation of steatotic grafts is associated with an
increased risk of primary nonfunction, early allograft dysfunction, and posttransplant vascular and biliary complications in
cadaveric as well as living-donor LT.107 A study involving large
series of LT patients has demonstrated that patients receiving
up to 30% of fatty liver had a higher rate of primary nonfunction
(5.1% vs. 1.8%) and worse patient (77% vs. 91 %) and graft
(70% vs. 82%) survival at 2 years compared to patients
receiving a nonsteatotic graft.108 NAFLD is an independent
predictor of occurrence of post-LT MetS that increases the
risk of steatosis in the graft liver.109,110 Within a few months
of LT, steatosis developed in 60–100% of the patients and
NASH in 10–40% of the patients. Approximately 10% of the
patients progressed to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in a
decade.110
In conclusion, NAFLD is highly prevalent in the general
population, and its prevalence is expected to increase in the
coming years. It has emerged as one of the leading causes of
cirrhosis and HCC in recent years and is a growing indication
for LT. NAFLD is associated with various extrahepatic diseases
and increased risk of all-cause mortality. Increased awareness about consequences of NAFLD and development of
strategies to change the course of this disease are needed
to control its emerging global threat. The optimal treatment of
NAFLD remains a clinical challenge, as there is no approved
pharmacotherapies. While traditional pharmacological therapies, such as insulin sensitizer (pioglitazone) and antioxidative agent (vitamin E), significantly improve steatosis and
inflammation, they have no significant effect on liver fibrosis
and have long-term safety issues. Currently, the therapeutic
options for NAFLD include diet and lifestyle modification and
pharmacological interventions targeting the components of
MetS. Lifestyle changes, if sustained, can make significant
difference in the trajectory of liver disease and overall outcomes. Finally, morbidly obese NASH patients can benefit
from bariatric surgery, which may reduce liver fibrosis but
carries a risk of decompensation in patients with cirrhosis.
