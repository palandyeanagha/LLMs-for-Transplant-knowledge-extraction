Abstract
Though renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2% of global cancer 
diagnoses and deaths, it has more than doubled in incidence in the developed world over the past half-century, and today is the ninth most 
common neoplasm in the United States (US). While North America 
and Western Europe have the highest disease burden (with the Belarus 
highest in incidence), Latin America, Asia and Africa are projected 
to see an increase in incidence as nation’s transition to a Western 
lifestyle. Most cases of RCC are discovered incidentally on imaging, 
and survival is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, with the 
metastatic disease having only a 12% 5-year survival rate. Two-thirds 
of RCC diagnoses are made in men, and the average age of diagnosis in the US is 64. Those with genetic predispositions, namely von 
Hippel-Lindau disease, tend to be diagnosed 20 years earlier. RCC 
has a greater incidence among Hispanics and Native Americans, and 
a lower survival rate among African Americans in the US. Modifiable risk factors for RCC include smoking, obesity, poorly-controlled 
hypertension, diet and alcohol, and occupational exposures. Prevention strategies aimed at improving survival and reducing disparities 
include addressing lifestyle factors and access to regular healthcare 
among underserved populations and in developing nations, as well as 
more rigorous imaging guidelines to detect RCC at an earlier stage. 
A stronger understanding of global RCC epidemiology can facilitate 
prevention efforts, especially in developing nations and underserved 
communities where disease burden is predicted to rise in the coming 
decades.

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an insidious neoplasm, accounting for approximately 2% of global cancer diagnoses 
and deaths, and projected to increase in burden worldwide [1]. 
Cancers of the kidney and renal pelvis have rapidly become 
more common in the developed world over the past decades, 
more than doubling in incidence in the United States (US) 
since 1975 [2].
Most RCCs occur in the cortex of the kidney, which is 
composed of the glomerulus, tubular apparatus and collecting 
duct. Cancers of the renal pelvises resemble urothelial (bladder) cancer in histology and behavior [3].
Most RCC cases in the developed world are found incidentally on imaging, typically with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound. 
Only 10% of patients present with the “classic triad” of symptoms: hematuria, flank pain and palpable masses. Other common symptoms include fever, weight loss and leukocytosis. 
Approximately 20% of patients also suffer from a variety of 
paraneoplastic syndromes, including hypercalcemia due to 
parathyroid-related hormone peptide, polycythemia due to 
erythropoietin, Cushing’s syndrome due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and hypertension due to renin over-production. Rarely, RCC is suspected following the diagnosis of a 
left-sided varicocele due to tumor involvement and obstruction 
of the left renal vein [4].
Depending on patient characteristics and extent of the disease, the neoplasm is either surgically resected and ablated or 
percutaneously biopsied and immunohistochemically (IHC) 
stained to determine systemic therapy. The IHC stain for 
the immunosuppressive marker programmed death ligand-1 
(PDL1) has become especially predictive as PD-1 inhibitors 
like pembrolizumab and nivolumab have become the firstline standard of care in PDL1-positive metastatic disease [5]. 
PDL1-positive disease accounts for approximately 8.2% of 
cases and is associated with more advanced disease and lower 
survival [6]. Even PDL1-negative disease is highly resistant 
to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, other immunotherapies 
such as aldesleukin (IL-2) and targeted therapies (such as suManuscript submitted March 23, 2020, accepted May 4, 2020

nitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor) are typically employed in the treatment of the 
metastatic disease.
As more nations adopt the Western lifestyle, the global 
burden of RCC is projected to continue to rapidly increase. 
Incidental findings remain the primary form of RCC diagnosis, 
and despite new treatment options, late-stage diagnoses have 
abysmally low survival rates. A better understanding of RCC 
epidemiology and risk factors may help curb growing disease 
burden through prevention as well as facilitate earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatment options, thereby improving 
survival for a disease that claims 175,000 lives each year.
Epidemiology
Incidence
According to 2018 GLOBOCAN data, an estimated 403,000 
people a year are diagnosed with neoplasms of the kidney, constituting 2.2% of all cancer diagnoses [7]. Of these, approximately 254,500 cases are diagnosed in males and 148,800 in 
females, reflecting a relative risk (RR) of about 1.7 for men 
compared to women. The cumulative global risk of developing 
the disease is 0.69% among men and 0.35% among women, 
which results in an age-standardized rate (ASR) of 6.0 and 
3.1 among men and women, respectively (with a global average of 4.4). North America has the greatest incidence (ASR = 
10.9/100,000) with Western Europe (9.7) and Australia/New 
Zealand (9.6) not far behind (Fig. 1 [7]). Belarus is the nation 
with the highest incidence in the world (16.8/100,000), while 
many central African nations have an effective incidence near 
or equal to 0 [1].
RCC is the seventh most common form of neoplasm in the 
developed world. The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) statistics report that in the US, about 74,000 new 
cases of kidney cancer were diagnosed in 2019, accounting for 
4.2% of all cancer diagnoses (almost double the global average). The incidence was first reported in 1975 as 7.1/100,000. 
In 2016, this resulted in an incidence rate of 14.9/100,000. 
This steady rise has made kidney cancer one of the fastestgrowing cancer diagnoses in the US. However, since peaking 
at 16.0/100,000 in 2008, kidney cancer incidence has plateaued [2].
Mortality
The GLOBOCAN statistics report mortality of 175,000 people from kidney cancer in 2018. This figure constitutes 1.8% 
of global cancer deaths. With approximately 114,000 men and 
61,000 women perishing from the disease in 2018, the RR of 
mortality for men is 1.87, even greater than the relative incidence risk (1.71) (Fig. 2 [7]). The cumulative risk of death is 
0.28% among men worldwide and 0.12% among women, with 
ASRs of 2.6 and 1.1, respectively [1] (Fig. 3 [7]).
In the US, SEER program estimates that for the year 2020 
the number of new cases of kidney cancer is 73,750 and deaths 
is 14,830, accounting for 2.4% of all cancer-related deaths. 
Despite a doubling incidence, the age-standardized mortality 
in 2016 was the same as in 1975 when the statistic was first 
reported, 3.6/100,000. Mortality peaked at 4.3/100,000 in the 
years 1992 - 1994, and has since gradually declined to current 
levels, likely due to improving diagnostic modalities and treatments [2].
Survival
With a 76% 5-year relative survival rate in the US (2009 - 
2015), RCC is the deadliest urological cancer. This survival

rate has markedly improved since a low of 46.8% in 1977. 
Survival is highly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, with a 
5-year relative survival of 93% for stage I, localized disease, 
72.5% for stage II/III regional disease (local lymph node involvement) and only 12% for stage IV metastatic disease [2, 
8] (Fig. 4). About one-third of cases are diagnosed as metastatic, and a further 20-50% will progress to metastatic cancer 
despite surgical resection [9]. A large retrospective study of 
seven Latin American countries and Spain found the 5-year 
survival for resected RCC to be 86.1%. Age, nodal metastases, 
performance status (Karnofsky score < 80), fat invasion, tumor 
necrosis and tumor size (> 7 cm) were all significantly associated with worsened survival (in order of descending significance) [10]. Mangone et al have studied the trends in net survival from kidney cancer among six European Latin countries 
(SUDCAN population-based study) and found that, though 
there were some differences in survival, there were significant 
improvements in most countries [11].
Among those enrolled in clinical trials, a univariable 
analysis found those in the US/Canada with metastatic RCC 
had significantly higher survival than those in Western Europe 
(20.3 vs. 17.4 months), a difference which was not found in 
the multivariant analysis. Clinical trial participant survival was 
more variable in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe [12].

Etiology and Histology
Ninety percent of RCCs are of the clear cell, papillary and 
chromophobe histological subtypes, with the clear cell being 
the most common and aggressive. These subtypes have significant prognostic and treatment-predictive value [13]. Clear cell 
RCC, which accounts for 75% of diagnoses, is a tumor of renal stem cells commonly in the proximal nephron and tubular 
epithelium and is most likely to hematogenously metastasize 
to the lungs, liver and bones [14]. Inactivating somatic mutations or deletions in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene region (chromosome arm 3p) are implicated in as 
many as 45% of clear cell carcinoma cases. Those inheriting 
germline variants of this gene (VHL disease) and the tuberous 
sclerosis genes account for 5% of clear cell cases and are at an 
increased risk of younger-age, bilateral RCC [15]. While papillary RCC, which accounts for 10% of cases, has better survival 
than the clear cell, the prognosis is highly variable based on 
post-operative histological staining. Type 1 (basophilic) papillary carcinoma is typically higher-grade and more often associated with ganglial metastases and venous invasion than type 
2 (eosinophilic) tumors. Papillary RCC largely resembles renal 
cortical adenoma in architecture and genetic abnormalities (trisomy 7 and 17 and loss of the Y chromosome); however, renal 
cortical adenomas tend to be smaller (< 1.5 cm). Chromophobe 
RCC represents 5% of cases and carries the best prognosis, 
as metastases occur in only 7% of cases. Chromophobe RCC 
appears grossly, histologically and genetically similar to oncocytomas, with both being well-circumscribed, involving deletions of chromosomes Y and 1, arising from collecting duct 
intercalated cells (involved in acid-base regulation), and associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. Chromophobe RCC 
can be distinguished from oncocytomas with the absence of a 
central scar and a characteristic perinuclear halo. Medullary 
RCC is a rare form of RCC typically found in patients with 
sickle cell trait/disease or beta-thalassemia [16].
Risk Factors
Unmodifiable
Age
Sporadic RCC is a disease of older adults. The average of diagnosis in the US is 64, though most patients are diagnosed 
between ages 65 and 74 (cumulatively) [2]. Those with VHL 
disease develop RCC at an average age of 44 and are much 
more likely to be diagnosed with bilateral disease [17]. The 
largest increase in incidence in the US over the past decades 
has been among those 75 and older [2]. Papillary RCC diagnoses were also significantly more likely to be made among those 
> 60 than clear cell RCC, while chromophobe RCC diagnosis 
does not seem to be significantly associated with age, hinting 
at different mechanisms and timelines of pathogenesis among 
the histological subtypes [18].
Sex
Like most neoplasms, RCC is more common in men, with men

accounting for about two-thirds of global cases and deaths [1]. 
Part of this increased risk may be explained by greater rates of 
modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and obesity among men. Men also have lower survival rate [2]. By histological subtype, papillary RCC patients were the least likely 
to be women, while chromophobe RCC patients were far more 
commonly women than clear cell or papillary (but still not quite 
at a 1:1 ratio) [18]. The exact mechanism is not clear, but there 
is an increased risk of RCC with parity among women and also 
a possible correlation with hormonal factors [19-21].
Race
In the US, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native 
Americans have a greater risk of RCC than White Americans. 
One retrospective study found that Hispanic Americans had 
an almost three-fold increased odds of early RCC diagnosis, 
while Native Americans had an over six-fold increased odds, 
an effect that was especially pronounced for clear cell RCC. 
Interestingly, among Hispanics, speaking Spanish as one’s primary language was associating with an increased risk of advanced RCC diagnosis [22]. While African Americans are typically diagnosed at an earlier stage of RCC than whites [23], 
their survival rates tend to be worse [24, 25] (Fig. 5 [8]). One 
study found that among comparable T1 RCC patients, African 
Americans were more likely to have positive surgical margins 
following robotic nephrectomy [26]. Interestingly, the clear 
cell subtype of RCC is more common among Caucasian Americans (partially due to increased risk of VHL disease) while the 
papillary subtype is more common among those of African or 
Caribbean descent [27]. Suggested factors underlying the racial disparity in RCC diagnosis and survival among minorities 
include education and socioeconomic status, diet and physical 
inactivity, poor living conditions, access to healthcare and loss 
to follow-up [25].
Modifiable
Smoking
Tobacco smoking is one of few modifiable risk factors for RCC 
(and largely the most significant), similar to lung cancer and 
bladder cancer. Cigarette smoke contains many carcinogens 
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and beta-naphthylamine, as well as the highly addictive neurotransmitter-modulating substance nicotine. As they are filtered through the nephron, 
these particles are metabolized and promote inflammation and 
induce DNA damage, paving the way for carcinogenesis. One 
large retrospective analysis found current and former smokers 
had a 1.5- and 1.6-fold RR of RCC, respectively [28]. Increasing pack-years has been associated with increased risk (up to 
2.03 for those with 20+ pack-years), and RR was significantly 
reduced among those who had quit over 10 years ago [29]. Continued cigarette smoking after RCC diagnosis has also been associated with significantly worsened overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced disease [30].
Obesity
Meta-analyses have found a consistent association between 
increased body mass index (BMI) and risk of RCC, much 
like with breast cancer, colorectal cancer and many other neoFigure 5. Kidney cancer recent trends in United States mortality rates, 2000 - 2016 by race/ethnicity. Data source: US Mortality

plasms. While the precise pathogenesis remains unelucidated, 
obesity promotes resistance to insulin and insulin-like growth 
factor (facilitating uncontrolled tumor growth) [31], releases 
inflammatory cytokines, and disrupts metabolic homeostasis 
(such as stimulating the release of adiponectin) [32], leading 
to the over-production of DNA damaging free radicals. A study 
of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found that high BMI was associated with a 2.25 
RR of RCC [33]. Another study found that obesity was particularly associated with an increased risk of the clear cell (RR 
= 1.8) and chromophobe (RR = 2.2) subtypes of RCC, while 
papillary RCC did not seem to show an association (RR = 1.2) 
[34]. One study found that adding roughly 5 kg in body weight 
could increase RCC risk by 25% in men and 35% in women 
[35]. According to a meta-analysis, regular physical activity 
was shown to reduce RCC risk by 22% [36].
Diet and alcohol
Diets rich in cruciferous have been associated in some studies 
with a lower risk of RCC [37], while those heavy in meat-based 
protein and fat and dairy are associated with higher risk [38]. 
However, these associations were disputed by the EPIC study in 
Europe, which did not find any significant association between 
diet and RCC risk [39]. The correlation between diet and RCC 
seems to be not as strong as in other neoplasms like gastric and 
colorectal cancer. While moderate drinking seems to show a 
slight protective effect against RCC, heavy drinking is associated with increased risk among both men and women [40, 41].
Hypertension
Hypertension damages the renal glomerulus and tubular apparatus and has been associated with an increased risk of kidney 
cancer. A case-control study in the US found that hypertension 
doubled overall risk (OR) for RCC. White Americans with 
hypertension had an ORR of 1.9, while the OR was 2.8 for 
African Americans (possibly due to an increased prevalence 
of obesity). Time since hypertension diagnosis and poorly 
controlled hypertension both significantly further increased 
the risk of developing RCC. Both hypertension and obesity 
have been implicated in the racial disparity of RCC incidence 
and mortality in the US [42]. The aforementioned EPIC study 
found that among Europeans, high systolic (> 160 mm Hg) 
and diastolic (> 100 mm Hg) blood pressures were associated 
with a 2.48 and 2.34 RR of RCC, respectively [43]. The use of 
statins to control blood pressure among those with RCC could 
significantly improve survival; however, statin use was not 
shown to prevent RCC diagnosis [44].
Occupational exposure and drugs
While RCC is not classified as an occupational neoplasm (like 
bladder cancer or mesothelioma), several occupational exposures have been noted. Most prevalently, trichloroethylene, a 
solvent used in degreasing agents, spray fixatives for art, and 
public drinking water has been associated with RCC, liver cancer and lymphoma [45]. Specifically, the chemical seems to be 
activated by the pathway involved in glutathione transfer in the 
liver and kidney, causing DNA adducts, renal cell genotoxicity 
and cytotoxicity [46]. An estimated 10% of the US population 
has detectable levels of the toxic agent in their blood [45]. Other occupational chemicals associated with RCC include asbestos, benzene, vinyl chloride, herbicides and cadmium, as well 
as an overdose of the popular painkiller acetaminophen (US 
trade name Tylenol). Regular use of non-aspirin non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs has also been associated with an increased risk of RCC, likely because these agents inhibit prostaglandins which are necessary for proper kidney function [47].
Prevention and Screening
Smoking cessation, a healthy diet and regular exercise are 
the most evidence-backed means of prevention for RCC. The 
Mediterranean diet and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) designed Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, both of which consist of high levels of fruits, 
vegetables and plant products and low levels of red meat and 
fatty dairy, have been shown to decrease the risk of many cancers and have favorable effects on body weight, hypertension, 
glucose and lipids, all of which are implicated in RCC tumorigenesis [48]. Better control of hypertension through lifestyle 
modification, statins and other interventions is associated with 
a lower risk of RCC [41, 42]. Early interventions could be of 
particular benefit to minority populations in the US like African Americans and Hispanics, whose higher rates of early-age 
hypertension may predispose them to worse RCC outcomes 
[42]. Regular exercise helps to maintain healthy blood pressure and weight, but may also further reduce the risk of cancer 
independent of the aforementioned factors [49]. Smoking cessation gradually decreases the risk of RCC, with an over a twofold reduction in risk after 10 years of cessation [30].
Greater awareness of RCC risk factors and access to 
healthcare, especially among underserved populations in the 
developed world and developing nations, may help reduce disparities and improve outcomes. Populations at heightened risk 
of RCC due to genetic predispositions, high blood pressure, 
obesity or smoking and drinking status should be followed 
regularly and offered imaging (with ultrasound, MRI, or CT 
scan) when suspected as the prognosis is far more favorable 
when diagnosed early [25]. There are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to advocate for screening imaging studies 
in suspected RCC patients. Public health campaigns against 
smoking and obesity have likewise played a role in curbing 
the growing incidence of RCC in the developed world and 
could serve as examples for developing nations faced with an 
increasing disease burden.
Conclusion
While RCC accounts for 2% of global cancer diagnoses and

deaths, it has rapidly grown in incidence in the developed 
world, becoming the ninth most common cancer diagnosis 
in the US. RCC is the deadliest urological neoplasm and has 
a dismal late-stage, 5-year survival rate of 12%. Clear cell is 
the most common histological subtype, followed by papillary and chromophobe, and shows the strongest associations 
with many modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors. RCC is 
more common in older men and minorities in the US, where 
significant racial disparities persist in RCC survival. Modifiable risk factors such as smoking, obesity, uncontrolled hypertension, poor diet and occupational exposure are prime 
candidates for prevention efforts in the campaign against this 
aggressive cancer.
