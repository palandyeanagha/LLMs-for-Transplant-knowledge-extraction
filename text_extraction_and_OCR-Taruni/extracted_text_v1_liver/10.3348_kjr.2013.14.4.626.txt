Objective: To compare the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization 
(TACE) with surgical resection in patients with a single hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranging from 2 to 5 cm. 
Materials and Methods: The study participants were enrolled over a period of 29 months and were comprised of 37 
patients in a combined therapy group and 47 patients in a surgical resection group. RFA was performed the day after TACE, 
and surgical resection was performed by open laparotomy. The two groups were compared with respect to the length of 
hospital stay, rates of major complication, and rates of recurrence-free and overall survival.
Results: Major complications occurred more frequently in the surgical resection group (14.9%) than in the combined 
therapy group (2.7%). However, there was no statistical significance (p = 0.059). The rates of recurrence-free survival at 1, 2, 
3 and 4 years were similar between the combined therapy group (89.2%, 75.2%, 69.4% and 69.4%, respectively) and the 
surgical resection group (81.8%, 68.5%, 68.5% and 65%, respectively) (p = 0.7962, log-rank test). The overall survival rates 
at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were also similar between groups (97.3%, 86.5%, 78.4% and 78.4%, respectively, in the combined 
therapy group, and 95.7%, 89.4%, 84.3% and 80.3%, respectively, in the surgical resection group) (p = 0.6321, log-rank test).
Conclusion: When compared with surgical resection for the treatment of a single HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm, RFA combined 
with TACE shows similar results in terms of recurrence-free and overall survival rates.

INTRODUCTION
Although percutaneous radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA) is effective and safe for treating a small (≤ 3 cm) 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1-4), it could also be a 
minimally invasive treatment option in patients with larger 
HCCs (5-7). However, the rate of local tumor progression 
tends to increase considerably in proportion to the size of 
the HCC (8). Traditionally, the 3-cm and 5-cm cutoff points 
are considered important because previous studies showed 
RFA resulted in a lower complete ablation rate in HCCs 
larger than these two cutoff points (3, 5, 9, 10).

RF Ablation Combined with TACE for Treating Single HCC of 2-5 cm in Diameter
kjronline.org Korean J Radiol 14(4), Jul/Aug 2013
When compared with RFA alone, the combined therapy 
of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and 
RFA has been found more effective, especially for HCCs 
larger than 3 cm (8, 11-17). Owing to several synergistic 
effects, RFA combined with TACE could lead to lower local 
tumor progression rates and an improvement in both 
recurrence-free and overall survival rates in patients with 
HCCs. Regarding small HCCs less than 3 cm, RFA alone is 
similarly effective to the combined therapy (2). However, 
the combined therapy may be necessary to more effectively 
block local tumor progression in patients with HCC ranging 
from 2 cm to 3 cm in size (18).
Although RFA combined with TACE is increasingly used 
in treating patients with HCCs, there have been relatively 
few studies on the outcome of this combined treatment in 
patients with early stage HCC in comparison with surgical 
resection, in which the disease-free and overall survival 
rates after treatment with either a combination of RFA and 
TACE or surgical resection were comparable in patients with 
early stage HCC (11, 17, 19). Furthermore, in these studies, 
a considerable proportion of patients (up to 30%) had HCC 
with diameter less than 2 cm. 
Thus, the purpose of our study was to compare the 
effectiveness of RFA combined with TACE with surgical 
resection in patients with a single HCC ranging from 2 to 5 
cm. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Patient Population
The informed consent for medical procedures was signed 
by all the patients before treatment. Between August 2008 
and December 2010, among 257 consecutive patients 
who underwent combined treatment with TACE and RFA or 
surgical resection for the treatment of HCCs, 84 patients 
who met the following criteria were included in this study: 
1) a single HCC ranging between 2 cm and 5 cm in the 
largest dimension, 2) no history of prior treatment for 
HCC, 3) no major vascular invasion and 4) no evidence of 
extrahepatic tumor. All patients were confirmed to have HCC 
by a percutaneous biopsy (n = 15) or the typical imaging 
findings (n = 69) according to the American Association 
for the Study of Liver Disease (20). Any patient who met 
the following criteria became a potential candidate for the 
surgical resection: 1) appropriate hepatic functional reserve 
based on the ICG15 level suggested by Makuuchi et al. 
(21), 2) the volume of remnant liver after surgical resection 
should be more than 30% of the total liver volume, 3) 
bilirubin level less than 2 and 4) no uncontrolled ascites. 
The final decision between treatment options was made 
by an institutional hepatobiliary team with the views of 
patients being taken into account. As a result, among 84 
patients, 47 patients were treated with a surgical resection, 
whereas 37 patients were treated with a combined therapy 
due to the following reasons: 1) patients wanted to undergo 
nonsurgical treatment (n = 22), 2) inappropriate hepatic 
functional reserve (n = 9), 3) small volume of remnant liver 
after surgery (n = 6). HCCs were divided into two subgroups 
according to size (≤ 3 cm vs. > 3 cm) and morphology (noninfiltrating vs. infiltrating). Non-infiltrating HCCs were 
defined as tumor nodules with smooth and well-defined 
margins surrounded by a capsule (5). 
Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization
Digital subtraction angiography and subsequent 
chemoembolization were conducted by an interventional 
radiologist using a digital subtraction technique (Allura 
Xper FD20; Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands, 
or Advantx LCA/LP+; GE Healthcare, Paris, France). After 
identifying the feeding arteries with common hepatic artery 
angiography, which supply blood to the hypervascular 
mass, TACE of the feeding arteries was performed through 
further super-selective catheterization as close to the 
tumor as possible. A mixture of doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(Adriamycin; Ildong Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea) and an emulsion 
of iodized oil (Lipiodol; Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulnay Sous 
Bois, France) was used for chemoembolization. The amount 
of iodized oil was tailored to the size of the HCC (1 cc per 
1-cm diameter of the tumor) with an upper limit of 10 cc. 
The infusion of the mixture was continued until the flow of 
the feeding artery was static, and this was followed by the 
infusion of Gelfoam powder (Cutanplast; Mascia Brunelli, 
Milan, Italy).
Radiofrequency Ablation
Ultrasound-guided RFA was performed in all the patients 
one day after TACE. When patients had coagulopathy, 
considered to be present if the platelet count was less than 
50000 mm3
 (50 x 109/L) or the international normalized 
ratio was greater than 1.5, the procedure was performed 
after platelet transfusion. All patients underwent the 
procedures under sedation and local anesthesia, and their 
hemodynamic status was continuously monitored. When 
performing the insertion of electrodes under ultrasound 

628

guidance, intercostal or subcostal approaches were used, 
depending on the location of the tumor. In cases where the 
index tumor was located in the vicinity of the diaphragm or 
the colon, artificial ascites was routinely introduced using 
normal saline in advance of inserting electrodes under 
ultrasonographic guidance. Artificial ascites was induced in 
14 (38%) of 37 patients to improve the conspicuity of the 
index tumor or to minimize collateral thermal injury to the 
adjacent diaphragm or the colon. RFA was performed using 
a monopolar radiofrequency generator (CC-1, Valleylab, 
Boulder, CO, USA) with consecutive activation mode and 
a 17 G dual clustered internally cooled electrode with a 3 
cm exposed tip (STARmed Co. Ltd.; Goyang, Korea). When 
a multiple overlapping insertion of electrodes was required 
due to the geometry of the tumor, 17 G dual clustered, 17 
G single and/or 15 G single internally cooled electrode with 
3 cm exposed tip (STARmed Co. Ltd.; Goyang, Korea) were 
additionally used. The number of used applicators ranged 
between one and three (one, two and three electrodes 
in 15, 17 and 5 patients, respectively). That is, one 17 G 
dual clustered electrode was used in 15 patients, whereas 
two or three electrodes (a combination of dual clustered 
electrodes, 7 patients; a combination of dual clustered and 
single electrodes, 15 patients) were used in the remaining 
22 patients. In general, one 17 G dual clustered electrode 
approach was preferentially used for the index tumor less 
than 3.5 cm. Radiofrequency current was emitted with the 
generator set to deliver the maximal power in the automatic 
impedance control mode. To maintain the temperature 
of the electrode tip below 20ºC, iced physiologic saline 
was continuously circulated through the cooling catheter 
connected to the electrode by a peristaltic pump (Watson 
Marlow; Wilmington, MA, USA). Tumor ablation was 
continued for 8 to 12 minutes at each electrode placement. 
RFA was finished when the visible tumor was fully covered 
by a transient hyperechoic ablated zone on ultrasound 
images. To prevent bleeding or tumoral seeding, the 
electrode track was ablated while retracting the electrode. 
Surgery
All procedures were performed by open laparotomy. 
The type of hepatic resection was based on the size 
and location of the tumor (subsegmentectomy, n = 3; 
monosegmentectomy, n = 14; bisegmentectomy, n = 16; 
lobectomy, n = 14). All surgical resections were finished 
after negative resection margins were confirmed by 
histopathological evaluation. 
Follow-Up
A contrast-enhanced CT was performed within three 
hours of RFA. When tumoral enhancement around the 
RF ablation zone was detected, an additional session of 
RFA was performed for the residual tumor. The technical 
effectiveness of the combined therapy was defined by the 
absence of an enhanced tumor area, as assessed on onemonth follow-up CT (22). All the patients in both groups 
underwent follow-up CT every three months for two years 
and every six months after two years. Physical examination 
and blood tests, including a serum a-fetoprotein and liver 
function test, were also performed at each visit. Local 
tumor progression was defined as a newly appearing tumoral 
enhancement in or along the margin of the ablated zone 
in the combined therapy group and around the resection 
margin in the surgical resection group (17). In cases 
where extrahepatic metastases were suspected, PET/CT and 
bone scintigraphy were also performed. Once local tumor 
progression and/or new lesions in the liver were detected 
during follow-up, the patients were treated using various 
treatment options, including RFA, TACE and systemic 
chemotherapy. 
Assessment of Treatment Efficacy
The two groups were compared with respect to the 
length of hospital stay, rates of major complication, rates 
of recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates. Major 
complications were considered to be present if there was 
any event that resulted in permanent adverse sequelae 
(including substantial morbidity and disability), required 
additional treatment (including increased level of care), or 
led to increased hospital stay or hospital re-admission (22). 
Post-procedural pain and fever of unknown origin were not 
considered major complications. For rates of recurrencefree survival, the occurrence of local tumor progression, an 
intrahepatic new lesion or a distant metastasis during the 
time between the treatment and the last follow-up visit 
was used. For overall survival rates, the time between the 
treatment and death or the last follow-up visit was used.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc Version 
12.3 computer software (MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium). The 
two groups were compared on the independent continuous 
variables and categorical variables using Student’s t test 
and the chi-square test, respectively. Rates of recurrencefree survival and overall survival rates were estimated using 

629

the Kaplan-Meier method. The rates for the two groups 
were compared using the log-rank test. The prognostic 
significance of baseline characteristics was evaluated 
using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Null 
hypotheses of no difference were rejected if p-values were 
less than 0.05. 
RESULTS
The demographic and clinical characteristics of both 
groups are summarized in Table 1. There were no significant 
differences between groups of age, gender, etiology of 
cirrhosis, Child-Pugh class, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 
level, tumor size, morphology or location of the HCCs. 
In the combined therapy group, the index tumor was 
ablated completely in all 37 patients on immediate CT 
after ablation so that no additional sessions of RFA were 
required. Furthermore, the technical effectiveness was 
noted in all 37 patients on one-month follow-up CT (Fig. 
1). The mean ablation time was 27.3 ± 13.3 minutes. The 
mean number of ablations per each ablation session was 2.6 
± 1.5. Regarding the surgical resections, all procedures were 
curatively performed.
Hospitalization Length and Major Complications
The length of hospital stay after the procedure was 
significantly longer in the surgical resection group (19.8 
± 8.4 days) than in the combined therapy group (7.4 ± 
2.2 days) (p < 0.0001). Major complications occurred in 
one (2.7%) of the 37 patients in the combined therapy 
group and in 7 (14.9%) of the 47 patients in the surgical 
resection group (p = 0.059). In the combined therapy 
group, one patient showed segmental dilatation of the 
intrahepatic bile duct on a follow-up CT due to the injury 
of bile duct. The surgical resection group showed the 
following complications: pleural effusion (n = 2), which 
required chest tube drainage due to dyspnea, aspiration 
pneumonia (n = 2), hepatic failure (n = 1), hepatic abscess 
(n = 1) and mechanical ileus (n = 1). All of the patients 
recovered from complications with conservative treatment 
and/or percutaneous intervention, except one patient who 
died as a result of progression of hepatic failure after right 
hepatectomy. 
Recurrence-Free Survival
Patients were followed up for 1-49.8 months. The mean 
(± standard deviation) follow-up time for the combined 
therapy group was 29.9 months (± 7.8) and for the surgical 
resection group 31.7 months (± 10). During the followup period in the combined therapy group, local tumor 
progression was detected in 2, intrahepatic new lesions in 5, 
and distant metastasis in 4 patients (Table 2). One patient 
had both local tumor progression and distant metastasis to 
the lung. The rate of local tumor progression at 1 year was 
2.7%, at 2 years 5.4%, 3 years 5.4% and 4 years 5.4%. In 
the surgical resection group, local tumor progression was 
observed in three patients and an intrahepatic new lesion 
in 10 patients. Distant metastasis occurred in two patients 
(Table 2). One patient had both intrahepatic new lesion and 
distant metastasis to the lung. In each treatment group,

there were no significant differences between patients with 
small (2-3 cm) and medium (3.1-5 cm) HCC in terms of the 
incidence of local tumor progression and overall recurrence.
The rates of recurrence-free survival at 1, 2, 3 and 4 
years were 89.2%, 75.2%, 69.4% and 69.4%, respectively, 
in the combined therapy group and 81.8%, 68.5%, 68.5% 
and 65%, respectively, in the surgical resection group (Fig. 
2). There was no significant difference between the two 
groups (p = 0.7962, log-rank test). Also, there were no 
significant differences between the two groups for patients 
with small HCC (p = 0.9599, log-rank test) and medium 
HCC (p = 0.7783, log-rank test). Among various factors 
that included age, sex, location, size and morphology of 
HCC, liver cirrhosis (LC) cause, serum AFP level, Child-Pugh 
class, treatment allocation, multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards regression model revealed that serum AFP level was 
a significant independent factor associated with recurrence 
(odds ratio, 1.0002; 95% confidence interval, 1.0000-
1.0004; p = 0.0246).

hemoptysis (n = 2) or variceal bleeding (n = 1). In the 
surgical resection group, eight patients died due to hepatic 
failure (n = 7) or gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 1). The 
overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were 97.3%, 
86.5%, 78.4% and 78.4%, respectively, in the combined 
therapy group, and 95.7%, 89.4%, 84.3% and 80.3%, 
respectively, in the surgical resection group (Fig. 3). No 
significant difference was found between the two groups 
(p = 0.6321, log-rank test). Also, there were no significant 
differences between the two groups for patients with small 
HCC (p = 0.5618, log-rank test) and medium HCC (p = 
0.3216, log-rank test). Among various factors that included 
age, sex, location, size and morphology of HCC, LC cause, 
serum AFP level, Child-Pugh class, treatment allocation, 
there were no significant predictors affecting overall survival 
on multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. 
DISCUSSION
Local tumor progression after RFA is closely correlated 
with the occurrence of new HCCs in previously untreated 
liver through microscopic vascular invasion or satellite 
tumor nests (2, 13, 23). Successful local tumor control is 
therefore an important prognostic factor for good clinical 
outcomes in patients with HCCs treated by local ablation 
therapy (2, 24). 
There are a number of techniques for achieving a large 
ablated zone and complete necrosis of HCCs (2). Among 
these procedures, combined TACE and RFA, as opposed to 
RFA alone, has several advantages for attaining better local 
tumor control. The decreased arterial blood flow to an HCC 
induced by TACE may reduce the heat sink effect of large 
vessels adjacent to HCC, resulting in considerable increase 
in the volume of the ablation zone by RFA (2, 11, 15, 16, 
25). In addition, the effect of chemotherapy and hypoxic 
injury induced by TACE on cancer cells is enhanced by the 
high temperature during RF thermal ablation, making it

possible to extend the ablated zone (11, 26, 27). Given 
that the incomplete ablation and/or considerable local 
tumor progression limits the effectiveness of RFA alone, 
RFA combined with TACE was expected to be more effective 
especially for HCCs greater than 3 cm. Indeed, combined 
therapy is superior to RFA alone in providing a better local 
control of HCCs larger than 3 cm (5, 8, 13, 15, 17). 
Radiofrequency ablation alone achieves complete necrosis 
in more than 90% of small (≤ 3 cm) HCCs (3). Thus, RFA 
alone seems to be sufficiently effective for the treatment of 
HCCs smaller than 3 cm (2). However, residual viable tumor 
cells that could not be detected on contrast-enhanced CT 
might exist and eventually cause local tumor progression 
during the follow-up period after the procedure (2). In fact, 
Komorizono et al. (28) reported that a tumor size larger 
than 2 cm was one of the risk factors for local recurrence. 
Further, according to Mazzaferro et al. (29), viable 
microscopic tumor tissue was present after RFA treatment 
in 37% of patients with HCCs less than 3 cm and in 71% 
with HCCs larger than 3 cm. Combined therapy was recently 
found better than RFA alone with respect to local tumor 
control in the treatment of HCC (2-3 cm in diameter) (18). 
Thus, among small (≤ 3 cm) HCCs, HCCs ranging between 2 
cm and 3 cm were treated with the combined therapy in our 
study. 
Given that an insufficient ablative margin is associated 
with the occurrence of local tumor progression and that 
an ablative margin of at least 3 mm is required to reduce 
the rate of local tumor progression after RFA (30), a single 
needle-insertion session of RFA could be insufficient for 
the treatment of HCCs larger than 2 cm in the longest 
diameter. When the HCC is larger than 2 cm, a multiple 
overlapping ablation technique frequently needs to be 
performed in order to achieve the complete necrosis of 
an HCC surrounded by an optimal ablative margin. Even 
with multiple overlapping ablations for medium HCC, the 
complete ablation rate was lower compared to small HCC 
(31). In our study, when a multiple overlapping technique 
was needed, multiple electrodes including at least one 
cluster-type electrode were inserted in the index tumor 
and activated consecutively. This was because multiple 
electrode approach was considered to overcome the 
technical difficulty of repositioning of the single electrode 
under ultrasound guidance due to the gas bubbles (32). 
The use of multiple active electrodes was also expected 
to be superior to conventional overlapping technique 
with a single electrode (33). The technical effectiveness 
of ultrasound-guided RFA ranges from 92.9% to 100% in 
medium HCCs (32, 33). In addition, ultrasound-guided RFA 
with a cluster electrode and multiple electrode approach 
resulted in better local therapeutic efficacy than multiple 
overlapping ablations with the same electrode. In our 
study, technical effectiveness was achieved in all 37 (100%) 
patients, comparable with the results of previous studies 
(32, 33). This favorable result might be attributable to the 
use of combination therapy and multiple electrode approach 
including at least one cluster electrode.
When performing RFA under ultrasound guidance, precise 
targeting of the index tumor may be difficult due to the 
tumor location. For example, if the tumor is located in 
the liver dome and adjacent to the diaphragm, this tumor 
frequently has limited visibility due to overlapped lung or 
ribs (34). Artificial ascites method was effectively applied 
in this setting (35). Thus, in our study, artificial ascites 
method was used in 38% of the combined group to improve 
ultrasound-guided targeting of HCC on ultrasound images. 
Regarding the sequencing of TACE and RFA in the 
combined therapy, it seems reasonable to perform TACE first 
in order to take full advantage of the synergistic effects 
of TACE upon RFA (17). There might be concern that the 
efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents infused during TACE 
could be reduced if they were exposed to hyperthermia 
during RFA (36). However, when the degree and duration of 
the high temperature generated by a RF system are taken 
into consideration, the cytotoxic potency of anticancer 
drugs appears not to be appreciably affected (27). 
There has been no obvious consensus regarding the 
optimal interval between TACE and RFA with previous 
studies adopting different intervals, ranging from the 
same day to two months (2, 8, 11-13, 15). Theoretically, 
embolization effect that results from TACE may be maximal 
when the combined therapy is performed on the same day 
(15). However, an experimental study revealed that RFA 
performed within 6 days of TACE resulted in larger ablation 
volumes as compared to RFA alone (37). In our study, RFA 
was performed approximately 24 hours after TACE. This 
was because a one-day interval between modalities could 
strike a balance among the several concerns about the 
risk of complications, such as hepatic failure or hepatic 
infarction, the potential negative effect of hyperthermia 
on chemotherapy and a reduction in the effect of 
chemoembolization proportional to elapsed time from when 
TACE was performed (15).
In our study, there was no significant difference between

groups with regard to recurrence-free survival rates, 
agreeing with previous studies (11, 17). Several studies 
evaluating RFA combined with TACE for HCC smaller than 5 
cm demonstrated the rates of local tumor progression from 
2.9% to 40% (8, 13, 15, 17). In our study, local tumor 
progression was noted in two (5.4%) patients. Although 
our result was better than those of previous reports, it was 
difficult to directly compare our study result with those 
of previous studies due to the different basic values, such 
as method of combined therapy, type of electrode used, 
mean tumor size, follow-up duration. In our study, serum 
AFP level was found to be a significant independent factor 
associated with recurrence. Indeed, patients with high 
serum AFP level are expected to develop recurrence more 
frequently (31), resulting in a worse prognosis. Thus, based 
on our study, after complete resection or combined therapy 
of the primary tumor, close follow-up seems to be needed 
especially in patients with AFP level greater than 100 ng/mL. 
As compared with small HCC, medium HCC was reported 
to be significantly correlated with a higher local tumor 
progression after combined therapy (8). Further, during 
follow-up period after the combined therapy, local tumor 
progression was more frequently observed in patients 
with medium HCC (40%) than HCC between 2 and 3 cm in 
diameter (16%) (13, 18). Conversely, in our study, local 
tumor progression was observed in one (9.1%) and one 
(3.8%) of patients with medium HCC and HCC between 2 
and 3 cm in diameter, respectively. We assume that this 
discrepancy was partly due to small size of patients with 
HCC between 2 and 3 cm and different number of electrodes 
used in medium HCC and HCC between 2 and 3 cm. 
In terms of overall survival rates, surgical resection has 
been considered to be the best treatment for patients 
with resectable HCCs and reserved hepatic function, and 
is regarded as the first-line treatment, especially for HCCs 
larger than 3 cm (15, 38). In our study, the overall survival 
rates at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were similar between the 
combined therapy group and the surgical resection group, 
comparable with the results of previous studies (11, 17, 
19). However, the overall survival rates in our study were 
similar to or lower than others (11, 17). This discordance 
could be associated with a difference in the mean size of 
the HCCs (larger than 3 cm in our study vs. smaller than 3 
cm in those two studies). 
In comparison to liver resection, our study revealed 
that the combined therapy resulted in a shorter length of 
hospitalization. Further, although there was no significant 
difference, we observed fewer major complications and no 
procedure-related death in the combined therapy group. 
These findings are consistent with those of other studies 
(11, 17, 19). Thus, we believe that RFA combined with TACE 
was shown to be minimally invasive and safe in treating 
patients with early stage HCCs. 
This study has several limitations. First, histologic 
confirmation of HCCs was not obtained in every patient. 
Second, our study included a relatively small number of 
patients and a short follow-up period. Third, there may 
be an inherent selection bias because this study was 
retrospective and nonrandomized in design. Thus, both 
patient groups were not homogeneous for sample size. 
Although a randomized controlled study would be more 
desirable, it would be hard to conduct due to ethical 
considerations.
In conclusion, when compared with surgical resection 
for the treatment of a single HCC ranging from 2 to 5 cm, 
RFA combined with TACE showed similar results in terms of 
recurrence-free and overall survival rates.
