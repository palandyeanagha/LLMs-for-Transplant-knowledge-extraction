Abstract
Background: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) pose a great challenge for physicians in life-threatening bleeding
events. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of reversing the DOAC rivaroxaban using four-factor PCC
(prothrombin complex concentrate), a non-specific reversing agent.
Methods: Patients with life-threatening bleeding events during rivaroxaban treatment were included and
administered 25 U kg−1 of PCC. Blood samples were collected immediately prior to as well as after PCC treatment
at predefined time intervals. The primary endpoint was defined as the difference in thrombin generation (TG)
parameters ETP (endogenous thrombin potential) and Cmax (peak thrombin generation) prior to and ten minutes
subsequent to PCC treatment.
Results: Thirteen patients, of whom the majority suffered from intra-cranial haemorrhage (ICH) or subdural
haemorrhage (SDH), were included and administered PCC. The results show that the ETP (TG) significantly
(p = 0.001) improved by 68% and Cmax (TG) by 54% (p = 0.001) during PCC treatment. In addition, the Quick value
(prothrombin time: QuickPT) significantly improved by 28% and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was
decreased by 7% ten minutes after PCC administration. Cmax was reduced at baseline, but not ETP, aPTT or QuickPT.
Lag time until initiation (TG, tlag), thromboelastometry clotting time (CTEXTEM) and time to peak (TG, tmax) correlated
best with measured rivaroxaban levels and were out of normal ranges at baseline, but did not improve after PCC
administration. In 77% of the patients bleeding (ICH/SDH-progression) ceased following PCC administration. During
the study three participants passed away due to other complications not related to PCC treatment. The possibility
of thrombosis formation was also evaluated seven days after administering PCC and no thromboses were found.
Conclusions: This study shows that use of PCC improved ETP, Cmax, QuickPT and aPTT. However, of these parameters,
only Cmax was reduced at the defined baseline. It can be concluded that CTEXTEM, tlag and tmax correlated best with the
measured rivaroxaban levels. The study drug was found to be safe. Nonetheless, additional studies specifically targeting
assessment of clinical endpoints should be performed to further confirm these findings.

Background
Rivaroxaban (Xarelto®, Bayer, Germany) is used as
thrombosis prophylaxis and therapy instead of anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin, low molecular
weight heparin or vitamin K antagonists, because it is
considered to have a wider therapeutic range and a more
predictable dose-response [1–3]. Although bleeding and
bleeding complications in trauma and surgery are the
most common complications/side-effects [4], no
evidence-based reversal strategy is available for a bleeding patient taking rivaroxaban [5, 6]. A specific antidote
called Andexanet alfa is in development, but not yet
clinically available [7]. Therefore, the off-label use of
coagulation factor concentrates, particularly four-factor
prothrombin complex concentrate, in the management
of rivaroxaban-related, life-threatening bleeding is the
most recommended/used therapy [8, 9]: In healthy male
volunteers, PCC was seen to reverse the anticoagulant
effect of rivaroxaban [10, 11]. Especially for the
treatment of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), PCC
seems to be a promising potential reversing agent
[12–14]. However, managing life-threatening bleeding
events under DOAC remains a challenge for physicians since in vivo data regarding efficacy of anticoagulation reversal are still lacking.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PCC on coagulation status after life-threatening
bleeding events in patients treated with rivaroxaban.
Methods
Ethics committee approval
This study was approved by the Human Subjects Review
Board of the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria
(Ref.: UN2013–0048), as well as by the national competent authority (Bundesamt für Sicherheit im Gesundheitswesen, BASG, Vienna, Austria, Ref.: LCM-718199)
and registered with EudraCT (Ref.: 2013–004484-31).
Written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants. Patients, who for medical reasons (unconscious, shock, sedated, etc.) were not able to give their
consent to participate in this clinical trial, were enrolled
based on the principle of deferred consent according to
§ 43a (1), Austrian Medicinal Products Law (“Österreichisches Arzneimittelgesetz”).
The study was performed in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki guidelines regarding ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects
and followed Good Clinical Practice as defined by the
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH-GCP).
Study design and setting
The present study is a single-centre, analytic, observational,
prospective, open-labelled, single-armed, non-commercial
clinical pilot trial.
Selection of participants
Inclusion criteria were age over 18 years, patients receiving rivaroxaban and with life-threatening bleeding and
the need for reversal and/or patients needing acute reversal of the anticoagulation effects of rivaroxaban. Patients who had already been administered pro-coagulant
therapies including recombinant activated factor seven,
activated prothrombin complex concentrates or other
coagulation factor concentrates (except fibrinogen concentrate, DDAVP and tranexamic acid) were not included. Further exclusion criteria were: a greater risk for
thromboembolic events than for bleeding, pregnancy,
suspected or confirmed sepsis, recent history of
thromboembolic events, and active participation in another clinical trial or refusal to participate.
Interventions
The investigational medicinal product (four-factor PCC) was
generously provided by CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany
(Beriplex® P/N 500 IU). PCC was administered i.v. at a dosage of 25 IU/kg BW as bolus and/or continuous infusion. If
bleeding continued after the first dosage, a second dosage of
25 IU/kg BW had to be administered. However, for all of the
included patients only the first dosage of PCC was necessary.
The maximum total allowed dose was 5000 IU.
Study assessments were performed as follows: Visit 1
(V1, baseline) was performed immediately before administration of four-factor PCC (25 IU/kg BW). Ten
minutes after the end of PCC administration Visit 2 was
conducted (V2). Thereafter, Visits were calculated as V3:
+1 h, V4: +3 h, V5: +6 h, V6: +12 h, V7: +24 h, V8:
+2 days, V9: +4 days, V10: +7 days, V11 + 30 days. At
Visit 11 (30 days after V2) the patient was interviewed
to evaluate his health status. Between days 5 and 7 an
ultrasound examination of the leg arteries and veins was
performed to screen for thrombosis. At every visit bleeding and thrombosis status were assessed, laboratory
measurements performed and vital signs documented.
Blood coagulation assays were performed and blood
coagulation factor concentrations determined using
vacutainer tubes containing 1.106 mol l−1 trisodium citrate solution; blood samples for blood cell count were
taken using vacutainer tubes containing 1.6 mg ml−1 3 K
EDTA. All blood sampling tubes were purchased from
Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany.
All coagulation analyses were performed immediately
after blood draw, except thrombin generation. Plasma
for thrombin generation assays was immediately frozen
at −80 °C (or at −20 °C for a maximum of seven days)
and thawed immediately before being analysed.
Methods and measurements
ROTEM® parameters were determined using a ROTEM®
gamma analyser (TEM Innovations GmbH, Munich,
Schenk et al. Thrombosis Journal (2018) 16:1 Page 2 of 10

Germany). All tests were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions in whole blood immediately after
blood sampling and using the specific liquid reagents
provided by the manufacturer for EXTEM (extrinsically
activated assay with tissue factor) and INTEM (intrinsically activated test using kaolin) measurements.
Thrombin generation measurements were performed
using the Innovance ETP assay (Siemens, Marburg,
Germany) on an automated coagulation analyser (BCS XP,
Siemens, Marburg, Germany). Coagulation was activated by
adding phospholipids, human recombinant tissue factor (in a
concentration of 600–850 pmol l−1
) and calcium ions to
platelet-poor plasma. The generated thrombin cleaves a
chromogenic substrate (H-b-Ala-Gly-Arg-pNA) and the
turnover of the substrate is recorded over time. The final
substrate concentration is 733 nmol l−1 and 19 mmol l−1
CaCl. The original curve is corrected for the estimated α
macroglobulin-bound thrombin activity. From this curve the
following parameters can be obtained: total amount of generated thrombin present in the reaction from the point of initiation until return to baseline, which is measured by the
calculated increase in the extinction rate (measured in milliextinctions or mE), and also known as “endogenous thrombin potential” (ETP), sometimes referred to as “area under
the curve” (AUC), peak thrombin generation (Cmax) (the
maximum of the first derivation of the ETP), lag phase until
initiation (tlag), and time to peak thrombin activity (tmax).
PT, aPTT, d-dimers, vWF, plasminogen, single factor
levels (FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII and FXIII)
and antithrombin activity were determined with proper
reagents (PT: Thromborel® S; aPTT: Pathromtin® SL; DDimers: INNOVANCE® D-Dimer; vWF: vWF Ag®,
Innovance® VWF Ac, Plasminogen: Berichrom® Plasminogen; factor II, V, VII, X: Factor-deficient plasma via
Thromborel® S; factor VIII, IX, XI, XII: Factor-deficient
plasma via Pathromtin® SL; antithrombin III Berichrom®
Antithrombin III) on an automated coagulation analyser
(reagents and BCSxp, Siemens, Marburg, Germany). The
pondus Hydrogenii (pH) value was measured with proper
reagents on an automated blood gas analyser (ABL800,
Drott Medizintechnik GmbH, Austria). CRP was measured using an immunoturbidimetric assay (Tina-quant®
CRPLX, Roche Diagnostics). Rivaroxaban levels were also
measured on the BCSxp using a chromogenic assay
calibrated for rivaroxaban (BIOPHEN® DiXa-I, CoaChrom
Diagnostica, Neuville-sur-Oise, France). Reference ranges
were taken from the respective product specification files
of the test reagents used (compare above, all reagents and
machines with CE certification) or from the respective
standard references [15].
Outcomes
Primary objective was assessment of the coagulation status
after administration of PCC. Coagulation measurements
included PT, aPTT, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP),
thromboelastometry (ROTEM®), single factor concentrations, blood cell count and the rivaroxaban level.
Based on previous investigations [16–20], the primary
endpoint was defined as the difference in thrombin generation parameters ETP and Cmax between V1 and V2.
Secondary endpoints were the development of the following parameters from V1 to V10 and their correlation
with measured rivaroxaban levels: thrombin generation,
single factor profiles, standard coagulation tests PT, aPTT,
fibrinogen, AT, and thromboelastometry (ROTEM®).
Analysis
A descriptive analysis of all measured blood characteristics was performed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used to evaluate the primary endpoint and all other differences in coagulation measurements between baseline
and samples from the same patient at V2 to V10. To
evaluate correlations between rivaroxaban level and
blood coagulation assays and coagulation factor activities
Pearson’s correlation was used. P values ≤0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses
were performed using STATISTICA 10 software
(StatSoft Europe GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).
Results
Characteristics of study subjects
Fourteen patients (5 female, 9 male) aged between 47
and 96 years (median 80 years) were enrolled at the
Medical University of Innsbruck. One patient (male) had
to be excluded from analysis because he withdrew consent. Median weight was 76 kg (range 52 kg to 99 kg)
and median height 170 cm (range 156 cm to 183 cm).
Average body mass index was 25 (range 18 to 34).
The first visit to the first patient (FPFV) was in
August 2014, last patient last visit (LPLV) was in
October 2016. Underlying disease was mostly intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH, six patients), four
patients suffered from subdural hematoma (SDH), one
patient suffered from haemorrhage after removing the
urinary catheter, one during laparotomy, and one suffered from gastrointestinal bleeding.
Prior medication (within seven days before V1),
besides rivaroxaban (100%), was recorded if patients
received additional antiplatelet medication (2 patients),
procoagulatory medication (no patient) or anticoagulatory medication (no patient).
Median amount of administered PCC was 2000 IU
(range 1500 to 2400 IU).
Concomitant medication (from V1 to V7), with potential influence on coagulation, included anticoagulant
medication (12 patients), catecholamines (10 patients),
antibiotics (6 patients), procoagulant medication (1 patient), anti-fibrinolytics (1 patient) and blood products (1
Schenk et al. Thrombosis Journal (2018) 16:1 Page 3 of 10

patient): ten patients received noradrenaline, seven patients enoxaparin, two patients rivaroxaban, and one patient each received danaparoid, fibrinogen concentrate,
tranexamic acid and erythrocyte concentrate.
Safety
Three subjects died during study participation, one from
septic shock (multi-organ failure), one due to progressive
cancer and one from ICH. All deaths were considered to be
unrelated to the study medication. Of the thirteen study patients three showed signs of re-bleeding (progressive ICH)
after administration of PCC. Other serious adverse events
(SAEs) were an epileptic event, ischemia caused by
thromboembolic closure of the femoral artery bifurcation
(left), sepsis and embolic arteria cerebri anterior infarct
(one patient). Both thromboembolic SAEs occurred only
after day 7 (thrombotic screening via duplex ultrasound).
Main results
Baseline For baseline values of laboratory parameters
other than coagulation measurements, please refer to
Table 1.
Mean rivaroxaban level at V1 was 120 ng ml−1 (95%
confidential interval 48 to 192 ng ml−1
). The course of
measured rivaroxaban levels can be seen in Fig. 1. Standard laboratory parameters aPTT and PT (Quick value)
were in normal range. Thromboelastometry EXTEM
clotting time (CTEXTEM) was prolonged, Cmax (TG) was
reduced and ETP (TG) was in normal range. Moreover,
C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were increased, as were
d-dimers, FVIII levels and vWF levels, whereas erythrocyte and leukocyte counts were below reference ranges
for healthy subjects. Blood loss was 800 and 750 cm3 for
patients who were bleeding externally, whereas in the
case of ICH intracerebral blood volume was 0.02 cm3
,
8 cm3
, 12 cm3, 34 cm3, 43 cm3 and 99 cm3, respectively.
Regarding SDH, blood loss volume was 3 cm3
, 11 cm3,
33 cm3 and 116 cm3
, respectively. In the case of gastrointestinal bleeding blood loss was not measured. All
baseline coagulation laboratory measurements can be
seen from Table 2.
Primary endpoint
All included patients reached the primary endpoint
(difference in thrombin generation between V1 and V2).
The ETP significantly (p = 0.001) increased by 68% as a
result of administration of PCC (median amount of
administered PCC: 2000 IU [range 1500–2400 IU]) from
316 mE at V1 to 530 mE at V2. Cmax significantly (p =
0.001) improved by 54% from 80 mE min−1 (V1) to
123 mE min−1 (V2). tlag and tmax did not show a significant difference between V1 and V2 (Fig. 2a and b).
Secondary endpoints
Regarding thrombin generation in addition to reaching
the primary endpoint (compare above), the ETP
remained significantly elevated until 48 h after PCC administration (V8) and Cmax until 12 h after PCC administration (V6). Compare Table 1 and Fig. 2a/b.
None of the measured ROTEM® parameters significantly improved after administration of PCC. MCFINTEM
significantly decreased by 3% (p = 0.019) after PCC administration and remained significantly decreased until
one hour after PCC administration (V3, data not
shown). CTEXTEM was significantly decreased only after
V5 (compare Fig. 2c). Assessment of coagulation status
following the administration of PCC showed a significant increase in QuickPT (+28%) ten minutes after PCC
administration (V2). The Quick value remained significantly increased, as compared to baseline (V1), until V9
or four days after administration of PCC (compare Fig.
2d). Moreover, PCC caused a significant decrease of 7%
in aPTT. aPTT also remained significantly decreased
until V2 (compare Table 2).

The single factor profiles showed a significant
increase in activation of all coagulation factors
contained in PCC (factors II, VII, IX and X) until V3
(FVII), V4 (FII) and until V7 (FIX and FX) as compared to baseline V1. All other coagulation factors
showed no increase in activity following PCC administration (compare Additional file 1: Table S1).
Regarding correlation of rivaroxaban level with coagulation parameter, best correlation was found between tlag
and rivaroxaban level (single measurements for every patient from V1 to V10 correlated with the respective
rivaroxaban level) followed by CTEXTEM, CTINTEM,
Quick value, and Cmax, MCFEXTEM, and tlag. All other
coagulation parameters showed no significant correlation with rivaroxaban levels (compare Table 3).
When comparing mean values of rivaroxaban and the
mean values of all measured coagulation parameters at
every time point (V1 – V10), tlag, CTEXTEM, tmax, MaxVtFIBTEM, MaxV-tEXTEM, MCFFIBTEM, CTINTEM and
FIclauss showed a significant correlation with rivaroxaban
levels. All other coagulation parameters showed no significant correlations with rivaroxaban levels (compare

Discussion
The present study enrolled patients with the need for
acute reversal of the effects of rivaroxaban to investigate
the effects of PCC on the coagulation status. The majority of included patients (77%) suffered from lifethreatening bleeding events in the central nervous system (ICH or SDH). Administration of PCC resulted in
improved thrombin generation (Cmax, ETP), aPTT and
QuickPT, whereas ETP, aPTT and QuickPT were in normal range already before treatment. Therefore, Cmax was
the only parameter reduced at baseline (out of normal
range) that improved by PCC administration. Tlag, CTEXTEM and tmax correlated best with measured rivaroxaban
levels and were out of normal ranges at baseline, but did
not respond to PCC administration. Study design and
the small number of included patients do not allow a
profound safety evaluation to be conducted. However,
ultrasound examination seven days after administration
of four-factor PCC revealed no thrombotic events. The
occurrence of thrombosis found in the present study
was 14% during the observation period (30 days), which
is comparable to the frequency found in the ANNEXA-4
study with an incidence of 18% [21].
To date, no studies regarding the efficacy of PCC in
patients with life-threatening bleeding events, associated
with DOACs, are available. Yoshimura and colleagues
recently published data from an observational study
evaluating PCC in ten patients with bleeding complications associated with DOAC treatment: PT also significantly improved after PCC administration, but in
contrast to our study they found no significant changes
in aPTT [22]. This might be attributed to the lower dose
of PCC administered (median 1000 IU vs. 2000 IU in
the present study). A recent retrospective study by
Grandhi and colleagues investigated the effect of PCC
on ICH in 16 patients under rivaroxaban treatment.
They collected no data about coagulation status but
found PCC to be effective in reducing haemorrhagic
complications and hematoma expansion [12]. Erenberg
and colleagues conducted a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study with 12 healthy volunteers who

received rivaroxaban for two and a half days (2 × 20 mg)
and subsequently a PCC bolus (50 U kg−1
): effects of rivaroxaban and PCC were evaluated using the PT and
ETP. Both parameters were affected by rivaroxaban and
improved by PCC [10]. A similar study set up by Levi
and colleagues with 35 healthy volunteers, who were
randomized into a 4-factor PCC, a 3-factor PCC (50 U
kg−1 for both) and a placebo (saline) group after four
days of rivaroxaban (2 × 20 mg) treatment, also revealed
that 4-factor PCC improved PT, aPTT and ETP [18]. In
a recent study, we already demonstrated the effects of
PCC on CTEXTEM and TG ex vivo [16]: PCC was able to
improve both parameters ex vivo, and rivaroxaban levels
correlated with QuickPT, CTs, Cmax, aPTT and tlag.
The main difference between the present study and
previous investigations is the different study set-up (in
vivo). Consequently, rivaroxaban levels were more heterogeneous than in controlled ex vivo studies with
patient blood or in vitro studies with healthy volunteers.
For example, in the present study ETP was not reduced
(as compared to normal values) at baseline V1, but the
exact time of rivaroxaban intake was mostly not known.
Consequently, rivaroxaban levels were lower than in
comparable studies and ETP was not impaired.
The majority of patients were admitted with acute intracerebral haemorrhage. Early hematoma enlargement
occurs more frequently in patients on anticoagulant
treatment, and is associated with worsened long-term
outcome [23]. Therefore, immediate reversal of any anticoagulant is recommended. Although we did not include
a clinical or radiographic outcome parameter in the
current study, we were able to show that PCC can be
used to improve coagulation in these patients.
Interestingly, factor VIII and VWF levels were shown
to be strongly increased (>200%) at all investigated time
points. We already observed this phenomenon in previous investigations with patients who were not bleeding
under rivaroxaban [16]. A potential explanation is that
blood coagulation factor VIII and VWF levels significantly increase during an acute phase response [24].
Limitations of the present study are the lack of
randomization / a control group and the small number
of patients, resulting in insufficient data on mortality or
effective haemostasis. However, this is the first prospective clinical study investigating the effect of PCC on
rivaroxaban-related, life-threatening bleeding in vivo.
Previous investigations have focused on healthy volunteers receiving an oral Xa inhibitor followed by PCC. To
obtain these data at precise time points in emergency
patients is challenging and not possible in a large number of patients except in an industry-sponsored study
with research staff available around the clock. Especially
the measured laboratory parameters add valuable knowledge to this topic.
Nevertheless, great care has to be taken since patients
concomitantly took other medication, which probably
influenced the results. Moreover, the influence of rivaroxaban on PT, aPTT, coagulation factor levels and
thromboelastometry assays differs widely depending on
the reagents used and must be evaluated for each particular reagent. Consequently, effects of rivaroxaban on
the various assays can also be expected to differ from reagent to reagent.
Consequently, additional studies focusing on these
outcomes must be conducted. Even though a specific
antidote for the reversal of rivaroxaban is in development, there is still little knowledge about the real efficacy of Andexanet Alpha: preliminary analysis of the
ANNEXA-4 study showed 79% efficacy. However, four
hours after administration of the antidote rivaroxaban
levels returned almost to pre-treatment values [21].
Moreover, it is still unclear whether smaller hospitals

will be able to store these, presumably very expensive,
antidotes. Additionally, specific antidotes that directly
target and eliminate the anticoagulant activity of the
DOACs do not possess pro-coagulant properties, which
might be necessary in patients suffering from severe
haemorrhage. This indicates that coagulation factor concentrates should still be part of the management strategy
in bleeding patients.
Conclusions
No controlled clinical studies in humans involving potential reversing agents in bleeding situations are available yet, which illustrates a difficulty in evaluating the
potential reversing agents and proposing them for the
management of life-threatening bleeding in rivaroxabananticoagulated patients. Our data indicate that fourfactor PCC might be a valuable alternative to specific
antidotes for the reversal of rivaroxaban-induced and
life-threatening bleeding events. Further studies with
clinical endpoints will have to confirm these findings.

Fig. 3 Correlations between means of rivaroxaban plasma levels and various coagulation parameters from V1 to V10. Significantly (p < 0.05 for all)
correlated parameters were (a) thrombin generation lag time (tlag, linear approximation for tlag = 23.63 + 0.19*x, r = 0.924, p < 0.001); (b) thrombin
generation time to peak (tmax, linear approximation for tmax = 63.02 + 0.34*x, r = 0.903, p < 0.001); (c) EXTEM clotting time (CTEXTEM, linear
approximation for CT = 65.312 + 0.26*x, r = 0.926, p < 0.001) and (d) thromboelastometry FIBTEM time to maximum velocity (MaxV-tFIBTEM, linear
approximation for MaxV-tFIBTEM = 79.132 + 0.205*x, r = 0.887, p < 0.001). Strength of correlation was interpreted by evaluating the correlation coefficient: r 0.9–1.0, very strong correlation; r 0.7–0.89, strong correlation; r 0.5–0.69, moderate correlation; r 0.3–0.49, weak correlation
