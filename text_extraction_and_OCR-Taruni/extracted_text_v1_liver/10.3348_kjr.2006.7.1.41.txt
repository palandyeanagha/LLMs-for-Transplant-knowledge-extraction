The Balloon Dilatation and Large Profile
Catheter Maintenance Method for the
Management of the Bile Duct Stricture
Following Liver Transplantation
Objective: We wanted to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the percutaneous
balloon dilatation and large profile catheter maintenance method for the management of patients with anastomotic biliary strictures following liver transplant.
Materials and Methods: From May 1999 to June 2003, 12 patients with symptomatic benign biliary stricture complicated by liver transplantation were treated
with the percutaneous balloon dilatation and large profile catheter maintenance
method (1 6 months). The patients were eight males and four females, and their
ages ranged from 20 to 62 years (mean age: 44 years). Ten patients underwent
living donor liver transplantation and two underwent cadaveric liver transplantation. Postoperative biliary strictures occurred from two to 21 months (mean age:
18 months) after liver transplantation. 
Results: The initial technical success rate was 92%. Patency of the bile duct
was preserved for eight to 40 months (mean period: 19 months) in 10 of 12 (84%)
patients. When reviewing two patients (17%), secondary balloon dilatations were
needed for treating the delayed recurrence of biliary stricture. In one patient, no
recurrent stenosis was seen during the further 10 months follow-up after secondary balloon dilatation. Another patient did not response to secondary balloon
dilatation, and he was treated by surgery. Eleven of 12 patients (92%) showed
good biliary patency for 8 40 months (mean period: 19 months) of follow-up.
Conclusion: The percutaneous balloon dilatation and large profile catheter
maintenance method is an effective therapeutic alternative for the treatment of
most biliary strictures that complicate liver transplantation. It has a high success
rate and it should be considered before surgery.
iver transplantation is a widely accepted treatment for end-stage liver
disease. Despite the improvements that have been made in organ preservation technology, the refinement of surgical technique and the advances
in immunosuppressive strategies, postoperative biliary stricture is still a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation (1). According to the
recently published literature, biliary complications occur in approximately 10% to
50% of all cases of liver transplantation (2, 3). In particular, bile leakage and anastomotic stricture are the most common complications. End-to-end choledochocholedochostomy is a usual pattern of anastomosis between the donor’s and recipient’s
common bile ducts (CBD) during liver transplantation, and anastomotic site stricture
occurs in about 10% of these patients (4). Patients with benign postoperative biliary
strictures have a long average life expectancy. Therefore, the major goal of percutaneous treatment is to maintain the long-term patency of biliary strictures with balloon
dilatation and/or stent placement. Recurrent stenosis after balloon dilatation for

treating benign biliary stricture occurs in 29 58% of the
cases (5, 6). During the past few years, several reports
have advocated performing endoscopic or percutaneous
stenting as an effective method with high success rate for
treating anastomotic strictures (7, 8). This was not the case
in our series despite that all procedures were performed by
experienced interventional endoscopists and radiologists.
The overall success rate for treating anastomotic stricture
by performing dilatation or stent insertion was 27% and
none of the patients who required more than one stent
insertion displayed resolution of their problems. The 21%
failure rate for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was in keeping with the reported rates
(9 60%) (9). Acute pancreatitis (21%) and stent blockage
(30%) were the main complications. Accordingly, we
suggest performing percutaneous balloon dilatation with
temporary maintenance of a large profile catheter across
the benign biliary stricture as an alternative method to
treat resistant and refractory lesions. We report here on
the short-term results of using this technique for the
treatment of symptomatic benign postoperative biliary
strictures in 12 liver transplantation patients. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From May 1999 to June 2003, a total of 104 consecutive
patients suffering with hepatic failure underwent liver
transplantation at our institution. Of these, 12 patients who
experienced symptomatic benign postoperative biliary
stricture after liver transplantation were treated with the
balloon dilatation and large profile catheter-maintenance
method. The patients were eight males and four females,
and their ages ranged from 20 to 62 years (mean age: 44
years). The underlying causes of the native liver failure
that required liver transplantation included liver cirrhosis
due to hepatitis B (n = 10), fulminant hepatitis (n = 1), and
Wilson’s disease (n = 1). Ten patients underwent living
donor liver transplantation and two patients underwent
cadaveric liver transplantation. The postoperative biliary
strictures occurred from two to 21 months (mean period:
18 months) after liver transplantation. 
The types of biliary anastomosis were end-to-end
choledocho-choledochostomy in nine patients and choledocho-jejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y
in three patients. The sites of biliary strictures were all
anastomotic and two patients had complex biliary
strictures involving both the anterior and posterior
segmental ducts.
All the patients initially presented with laboratory and
clinical findings suggestive of biliary obstruction, and this
was initially diagnosed from routine surveillance by the
liver transplant service. The patients were given a broadspectrum antibiotic Cefotaxime (cefotaxime sodium;
Chong Kun Dang Pharmaceutical Corp., Seoul, Korea),
and then they were transferred to the interventional
radiology department for percutaneous transhepatic biliary
drainage (PTBD).
Balloon-Dilatation Procedure 
All the patients were given local anaesthesia before their
procedures, i.e., 10 mL of 2% lidocaine (lidocain; Kwang
Myung Pharmaceutical Corp., Seoul, Korea). Demerol (50
mg) (pethidine hydrochloride, Kuk Dong Pharmaceutical
Corp., Soo Won, Korea) was given intravenously to
relieve pain. A 8.5 Fr external or internal-external biliary
drainage catheter (Cook, Bloomington, IN) was inserted
into the biliary tree after cholangiography was done by
percutaneous transhepatic access. If a missing duct was
detected on the cholangiogram, then an additional
puncture was done (Figs. 1A D). Four to six weeks later,
the existing biliary drainage catheter was exchanged for a
vascular sheath; this was done over a standard 0.035-inch
guidewire (Radifocus M, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). The
cholangiography was performed through the sheath and
we evaluated the grade of biliary stricture. Different types
of 5 Fr catheters (Angled Taper or Cobra or Shepherd
Hook, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) were advanced along the
guidewire to cross the stricture site and the wire was
exchanged for a stiff one (Amplatz Super Stiff, Boston
Scientific Medi-Tech, Watertown, MA). The balloon dilatation catheter (Courier; Boston Scientific Medi-Tech,
Watertown, MA) was then placed across the stricture and
inflated during 10 30 second per session until the stenosis
disappeared (Fig. 1B). A 6 8 mm 40 mm balloon was
used for dilatation of the strictures that extended into the
second order branch intrahepatic ducts, and a 10 12 mm
40 mm balloon was used for the dilatation of the
extrahepatic stricture. The tracts were dilated in a stepwise fashion with dilators (Cook, Bloomington, IN) to
accept a biliary drainage catheter; these dialators ranged in
size from the 8 to 16 Fr. An internal-external biliary
drainage catheter (14 18F) (Flexima, Cook, Bloomington,
IN) or a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic
catheter (Akita Sumitomo Bakelite Corp., Tokyo, Japan)
was chosen to over-expand the normal duct diameter by
10 20% and it was inserted for internal-external biliary
drainage for a period ranging from 30 to 90 days (average
period: 60 days) after balloon dilatation (Figs. 2A D). The
dilation procedure was generally performed during a
period of 1 2 week with one to three sessions (mean
number of sessions: two sessions) for each treatment. The

numbers of dilation sessions were determined by the
subsequent cholangiographic findings that were obtained
before a repeated dilatation procedure. If cholangiography
showed no restenosis, the catheter was removed. If bile
duct narrowing was still present, balloon dilatation was
then repeated with a balloon sized up to 25 30% larger
than the estimated diameter of the duct being dilated. The
balloon was inflated to approximately 6 8 atmospheres
(Encore 26 Inflation Device; Boston Scientific Tullamore
Limited, Galway, Ireland). After percutaneous balloon
dilatation, the catheter was maintained for over two
month, and then cholangiography was performed. If the
follow-up cholangiogram showed a residual stenosis less
than 20% and drainage of the contrast material into the
small bowel within 30 seconds, then we considered the
procedure to be technically successful and we removed the
large profile catheter. When the residual stenosis was more
than 20% or drainage of the contrast material into small

balloon dilatation (Fig. 3). 
Mechanical lithotripsy were performed by using a 10

patients who displayed lithiasis and/or sludge in order to
clear the biliary tree. Balloon sphincteroplasty was
performed with a 10-mm balloon catheter prior to attempting the passage of sludge and stones into the duodenum.
To avoid pancreatitis, pharmacologic protection was
performed with 0.1 mg ocreotide, t.i.d (Sandostatin,
Norvatis Korea, Seoul, Korea) three days before and after
treatment for the patients with an intact sphincter of Oddi.

recorded on standard forms. The follow-up evaluation
included assessment of serum bilirubin and the liver
enzyme levels (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase); these assessments
were performed before percutaneous drainage and before
and after balloon dilatation. Clinical assessment and the
serum bilirubin and liver enzyme assays were also
performed at one, three, six and nine months after balloon
dilatation. Between these assessments, monthly control
examinations were also performed via telephone
interviews with the patients or their family. 
Complications such as cholangitis or pancreatitis were
diagnosed by the clinical sign and symptoms and by
laboratory test, and when indicated by the imaging studies.
When the patients had signs of jaundice, then ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) of the liver was
performed to determine whether the jaundice was caused
by dilated intrahepatic ducts and if repeated intervention
was indicated.
This study was approved by our institutional review
board. A written informed consent was obtained from all
patients after the nature of the procedures was fully
explained. 
Study Endpoints and Definition
The major study endpoints were the assessment of
technical success, the safety of balloon dilatation, the
biliary patency and patient survival. 
The intervention was considered technically successful
when we observed complete or essentially complete (<
20% residual stenosis) restoration of the anastomosis
and/or bile duct lumen diameter, and there was drainage of
contrast material into the small bowel within 30 second
after cholangiography. Safety was judged based on the
incidence of complications. Events directly related to
balloon dilatation that resulted in admission to the hospital
for therapy (if the patient had been discharged), an
unexpected increase in the level of care, prolonged
hospitalization, permanent adverse sequalae or death were
classified as major complications. Minor complications
were events that required nominal therapy or observation
and these events resulted in no sequalae. 
The definition of a balloon dilatation with lasting patency
and the clinical successful treatment during the follow-up
period was the absence of recurrent biliary obstruction.
Primary patency of the balloon dilatation was defined as
the time interval between the initial placement and
recurrence of obstruction. If there was no evidence of
obstruction during the patient’s life, the patency period
was considered equal to the survival period, but this was
censored. Survival of the patients was defined as the time
interval between the initial placement and the patient’s
death. 
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis for significance was performed using a
paired t-test. Significance was accepted if the p values were
< 0.05. All the patients’ radiology reports and cholangiograms were reviewed. An electronic chart review of all
the procedures was performed, and this included the
operative notes, discharge reports, pathology reports,
cultures and laboratory data. Additional follow-up was
directly obtained from the clinical service in all cases. 
RESULTS
We obtained follow-up for all the cases, and technical
success of balloon dilatation was achieved for 11 of 12
(92%) patients after percutaneous balloon dilatation with
the large profile catheter maintenance method. All the
patients showed clinical improvement and relief of
jaundice (the average bilirubin level was 7.5 mg/dL 3.2

before procedure and 0.9 mg/dL 0.4 a month after the
procedure). In the all patients at least one month after
catheter removal, the serum bilirubin levels decreased to
below 2.0 mg/dL in all cases (Table 1).
Clinical follow-up was completed in 12 patients from
eight to 40 months (mean period: 19 months) after catheter
removal (Table 2). Patency of the bile duct was preserved
for 8 40 months (mean period: 19 months) in 10 of 12
(84%) patients. In two patients, recurrence of biliary
strictures were seen at six and eight months, respectively,
after the last percutaneous balloon dilatation. Among these
two, one patient underwent additional balloon dilatation
and he showed no recurrence of stenosis on the 10-month
follow up. The other patient did not respond to balloon
dilatation and he was immediately treated by surgery. 
Doppler ultrasound scanning was performed in all
patients for evaluating the abnormalities in the hepatic
arteries. Three patients showed hepatic artery stenosis on
their Doppler study and two were treated with percutaneous angioplasty. The other patient did not have
angioplasty performed due to patient’s poor general
condition.
The presence of biliary stones had no influence on the
success of treatment. Two of 12 patients had biliary stones
associated with bile duct stenosis. However, these two
patients were disease-free after percutaneous balloon
dilatation and clearing of the biliary tract. 
There were no important complications; minor complications occurred in three patients and they presented with
acute cholangitis. This was immediately treated by antibiotics and these patients showed immediate improvement.
Two patients had hemobilia immediately after balloon
dilatation, but this spontaneously resolved after 3 7 days. 
DISCUSSION
Biliary tract complications are well-known causes of the
substantial morbidity and mortality that occur after hepatic
transplantation (10, 11). Biliary strictures in the liver
transplant population can be classified as anastomotic and
nonanastomotic (including hilar) (11). The anastomotic
strictures observed after transplantation tend to be tough
fibrotic strictures that are the result of scarring and retraction, and this may be related to peribiliary ischemia.

Nonanastomotic, or hilar and intrahepatic biliary strictures
can be multifactorial and they are usually related to
hepatic artery thrombosis, a prolonged donor cold ischemic
time, chronic rejection, ascending cholangitis and
recurrence of pre-transplantation liver disease (12, 13). 
Hepatic artery occlusion has been reported to be the
most frequent cause of biliary strictures (13, 14). The bile
duct is normally fed by the hepatic and gastroduodenal
arteries and their collateral vessels. During liver transplantation, the collateral vessels are excluded from the hepatic
artery anastomosis; this alone supplies the donor liver. In
this condition, a minimal decrease of the hepatic artery
flow may cause ischemic stricture of the bile duct that is
anastomotic and/or nonanastomotic. Greif et al. (15) have
reported that hepatic artery thrombosis was found in 83%
of the patients with nonanastomotic bile duct strictures. In
our study, the patients with intra-hepatic and nonanastomotic bile duct strictures showed decreased hepatic artery
flow on their color Doppler studies. In our total cases,
three patients had hepatic artery stenosis. Two patients
were treated with percutaneous angioplasty and they
showed a good response to subsequent biliary balloon
dilatation due to a restored blood supply to the biliary
tract. Another patient was not treated with percutaneous
angioplasty, and the bile duct stenosis did not response to
subsequent balloon dilatation. 
Although no clear therapeutic algorithm has currently
been reported, there have been many approaches to treat
biliary stenosis, including surgical, endoscopic or percutaneous techniques. With the development of the interventional radiological techniques, percutaneous balloon dilatation and stent placement have become more accepted
techniques for the initial management of the biliary
strictures seen in liver transplant patients. Most series have
reported disappointing results with less than a 50%
patency rate at 1 2 years (11, 16). However, some series
have reported better results with using percutaneous
balloon dilatation for the nonanastomotic stricture than for
the anastomotic strictures (17, 18). Zajko et al. (17)
reported an 89% initial success rate and 70% 6-year
success rate for percutaneous balloon dilatation, which was
comparable to that for surgery. To obtain these results,
Zajko et al. used multiple dilatations (up to six times per
patient; mean number of dilations: three) during a 1 2
week period. 
The clinical usefulness of performing metallic stenting for
treating biliary strictures after liver transplantation is not
well established. Culp et al. (19) and Diamond et al. (20)
have used metallic stents for patients in whom the initial
balloon dilatation failed. Culp et al. (19) have reported an
88% secondary patency rate for the metallic stents in liver
transplant patients at five years. Unfortunately, the repetitive procedures required to maintain patency have lead to
increased complications and even deaths (19). Several
early reports found expandable metallic stents to be a
useful adjunct for patients with refractory biliary strictures
(21, 22). The initial technical success rate and short-term
primary patency rate were nearly 85% at six months (22).
The major disadvantage of metallic stents compromises
any subsequent surgical approach as they become
embedded in the bile duct wall. However, if percutaneous
balloon dilatation fails, there is no influence on the
subsequent surgical revision. In some patients who suffered
with exceptionally refractory strictures, an expandable
metallic stent was found to be useful to alleviate their
biliary obstruction until death from other causes as long as
two years after stent placement (23). The primary patency
of the stents may decrease to less than 50% at 12 18
months, and this may decrease to as low as 0% at five
years (19). Therefore, metallic stents are not a long-term
solution for the biliary strictures in most liver transplant
patients. 
Petersen et al. (21) have reported on using temporary
covered stent placement for the treatment of benign biliary
stricture in liver transplant patients. But the use of covered
stents is limited to treating multiple strictures because it
occludes the side branch ducts. 
The principal advantage of our method is that repetitive
stepwise larger size balloon dilations over a 1 2 weeks
period can achieve adequate bile duct dilatation with a low
risk of ductal rupture and bleeding. The dilated ductal and
periductal tissue can be stabilized during the interval
between each session and the mechanical stress per session
can be divided up and diminished. The catheter placed
across the stricture does not get incorporated into bile duct
wall, and long-term maintenance (2 6 months) of the
larger profile catheter (18 Fr) has a same effect as stenting
as well as that the catheter can be easily removed when
the biliary patency is stable. 
Although some studies (10, 15, 17, 24) have reported
that there were no complications after percutaneous
procedures, the well-known complications of the percutaneous approach are hemobilia, bleeding, cholangitis,
pancreatitis, biliary fistula and bile duct perforation. The
overall complication rate was 42% in our series and such
complications as acute cholangitis were treated with antibiotics; this resolved spontaneously in all of cases. In our
study, the rate of cholangitis was high (25%), and this was
possibly due to ascending infection, and this ascending
infection was independent from the type of anastomosis.
In this series on patients treated with track dilation, there
was an overall lower complication rate, which was
Balloon Dilatation and Large Profile Catheter Maintenance for Bile Duct Stricture Management in Liver Transplantation
Korean J Radiol 7(1), March 2006 47

comparable to the 14.5 22% reported in the other
previous percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopy
(PTCS) series (25 29). As a result of progressive dilation
of the biliary track, the complication and mortality rates
were found to be significantly reduced (26, 29). We
encountered no massive bleeding or bile duct perforation,
the same as in the other series (27 29). This could be
related to the practice of waiting 4 6 weeks for the track
to fully mature before performing dilatation. 
This study has some limitations. First, we report only the
interim results of the balloon dilatation and large profile
catheter maintenance method. Therefore, long-term
follow-up after complete treatment is necessary. Second,
because no clear therapeutic algorithm has been reported
to date, we used our own criteria to assess the therapeutic
effect. Third, our study group was small, and additional
studies are needed to further assess the role of this method. 
In conclusion, repetitive gradual balloon dilatations and
the large profile catheter maintenance method were a
highly effective and successful therapeutic alternative for
the treatment of biliary complication after liver transplantation.We think this method should always be considered
before surgical intervention. A larger series with a longer
follow-up period is required to better determine the
therapeutic efficacy of this new technique for the
treatment of biliary strictures.
