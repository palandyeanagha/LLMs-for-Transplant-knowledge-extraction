Abstract
During the last decade the field of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed impressive progress. Highly effective
immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibition, and T-cell engaging therapies like bispecific T-cell
engaging (BiTE) single-chain antibody constructs and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown
remarkable efficacy in clinical trials and some of these agents have already received regulatory approval. However,
along with growing experience in the clinical application of these potent immunotherapeutic agents comes the
increasing awareness of their inherent and potentially fatal adverse effects, most notably the cytokine release
syndrome (CRS). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying CRS
pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, differential diagnoses, and prognostic factors. In addition, based
on the current evidence we give practical guidance to the management of the cytokine release syndrome.
Keywords: Cytokine release syndrome, Immunotherapy, CAR T cells, T cell-engaging therapies, Cytokine storm
Background
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and certain drugs. The term
“cytokine release syndrome” was first coined in the early
‘90s, when the anti-T-cell antibody muromonab-CD3
(OKT3) [1, 2] was introduced into the clinic as an immunosuppressive treatment for solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, CRS has been described after
infusion of several antibody-based therapies such as
anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) [3], the CD28 superagonist TGN1412 [4], rituximab [5], obinutuzumab [6],
alemtuzumab [7], brentuximab [8], dacetuzumab [9],
and nivolumab [10]. CRS has also been observed following administration of non-protein-based cancer drugs
such as oxaliplatin [11] and lenalidomide [12]. Furthermore, CRS was reported in the setting of haploidentical
donor stem cell transplantation, and graft-versus-host
disease [13, 14]. Cytokine storm due to massive T cell
stimulation is also a proposed pathomechanism of severe
viral infections such as influenza [15, 16].
Lately, with the success of the newer T cell-engaging
immunotherapeutic agents there has been a growing
interest in CRS since it represents one of the most frequent serious adverse effects of these therapies. T cellengaging immunotherapies include bispecific antibody
constructs and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell
therapies. Both these immunotherapeutic strategies have
recently been carried forward into clinical application
and have shown impressive therapeutic activity in several hematologic malignancies, such as acute lymphoblastic B cell leukemia (B-ALL), chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL), and diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL).
In 2014, the CD19-directed CD3 BiTE blinatumomab
was approved for Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL under the
FDA’s accelerated approval program [17]. Recently, the
first two CAR T cell therapies tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel received FDA approval for refractory CD19-positive B-ALL [18] and relapsed or
refractory large B-cell lymphoma [19]. Multiple other
bispecific antibody and CAR T cell constructs that target
a variety of antigens are currently in clinical development. Furthermore, there are a number of related T cellengaging immunotherapeutic approaches in earlier

clinical development. These include dual-affinity retargeting antibodies (DART), immune-mobilising monoclonal TCRs against cancer (ImmTAC), and other TCRbased strategies [20, 21].
Studies of the first T cell-engaging therapies, i.e. blinatumomab [22] and CD19-targeted CAR T cells [23–25]
revealed that CRS is the most important adverse event
of these therapies. Thus, most of the current CRS data is
derived from CAR T cell and blinatumomab studies in
hematologic malignancies where CRS has been reported
in frequencies of up to 100% in CD19-targeted CAR T
cell trials, sometimes with fatal outcome (Table 1). As in
the future, T cell-engaging immunotherapeutic agents
will increasingly be used outside of clinical studies and
academic cancer centers it becomes paramount that oncologists and intensive care specialists are familiar with
this complication and its clinical management.
Review
Clinical presentation
CRS can present with a variety of symptoms ranging
from mild, flu-like symptoms to severe life-threatening
manifestations of the overshooting inflammatory response (Fig. 1). Mild symptoms of CRS include fever, fatigue, headache, rash, arthralgia, and myalgia. More
severe cases are characterized by hypotension as well as
high fever and can progress to an uncontrolled systemic
inflammatory response with vasopressor-requiring circulatory shock, vascular leakage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multi-organ system failure.
Laboratory abnormalities that are common in patients
with CRS include cytopenias, elevated creatinine and
liver enzymes, deranged coagulation parameters, and a
high CRP.
Respiratory symptoms are common in patients with
CRS. Mild cases may display cough and tachypnea but
can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral opacities
on chest X-ray. ARDS may sometimes require mechanical ventilation. Of note, in patients with CRS the need
for mechanical ventilation is oftentimes not due to respiratory distress but instead a consequence of the inability to protect the airway secondary to neurotoxicity
[26]. Patients with severe CRS can also develop renal
failure or signs of cardiac dysfunction with reduced ejection fraction on ultrasound. In addition, patients with severe CRS frequently display vascular leakage with
peripheral and pulmonary edema.
In severe cases CRS can be accompanied by clinical
signs and laboratory abnormalities that resemble hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Patients with CRS-associated
HLH display the typical clinical and laboratory findings of
HLH/MAS such as high fevers, highly elevated ferritin
levels, and hypertriglyeridemia. In a phase III study of blinatumomab in B-ALL four out of 13 CRS patients showed
signs of HLH [27].
Some patients develop neurotoxicity after administration of T cell-engaging therapies. Neurologic symptoms
might span from mild confusion with word-finding difficulty, headaches and hallucinations to aphasia, hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, seizures and somnolence. In
the case of CAR T cell therapy, neurotoxicity represents
the second most common serious adverse event and
therefore the term “CAR T cell-related encephalopathy
syndrome” (CRES) has been introduced [28]. The neurotoxicity of CAR T cell therapy does not seem to be directly related to CRS since neurologic symptoms do not
always coincide with CRS onset and neurotoxicity can
occur prior to CRS or after CRS has resolved [29]. The
pathophysiology of the neurologic symptoms is poorly
understood, but the lack of a strict temporal association
with CRS indicates that it might, at least in part, be independent from CRS. In addition, experience from clinical trials suggests that treatment of the neurologic
symptoms is different from that of CRS.
Epidemiology
The incidence of CRS in patients receiving cancer immunotherapy varies widely depending on the type of
immunotherapeutic agent. The onset of CRS can
occur within a few days, and in the case of CAR T
cell therapy, up to several weeks after infusion of the
drug. With most conventional monoclonal antibodies
the incidence of CRS is relatively low, whereas T cellengaging cancer immunotherapies carry a particularly
high risk of CRS.
Although most responding patients experience at least
some degree of CRS there seems to be no direct association between the severity of CRS and clinical response.
CRS does not seem to be a prerequisite for response to
T cell-engaging therapies. Some patients show complete
remission without obvious signs of CRS, while other patients display severe symptoms and laboratory abnormalities but no clinical response.
Clinical studies identified a number of predictors of
CRS severity. The risk of CRS is influenced by factors related to the type of therapy, the underlying disease, and
characteristics of the patients. Several clinical factors are
associated with the severity of CRS following CAR T-cell
therapy. Many CRS-inducing agents display a “first-dose
effect”, i.e. the most severe symptoms only occur after
the first administered dose and do not recur after the
subsequent administrations [30]. This “first-dose effect” is thought to be due to the higher disease burden at initiation of treatment. Disease burden is
among the most important predictors of severe CRS
after CAR T cell therapy or bispecific T cell-engager

administration [5, 31–35]. For instance, in patients
with ALL the burden of disease was associated with
the severity of CRS [36]. Similar observations have
been made in a murine lymphoma model, were injection of CAR T cells into mice with high tumor burden resulted in lethal CRS, whereas mice with low
tumor burden did not show signs of CRS [37, 38].
The administered dose of the active agent is another
factor that affects the risk of CRS [33, 35, 39]. Furthermore, the strength of T cell activation and the degree of
T cell expansion seem to correlate with the severity of
CRS [40]. Children seem to be at a higher risk of developing CRS than adults. In pediatric patients with ALL
the incidence of CRS following infusion of CD19-
targeted CAR T cells was 30/30 (100%) and 16/21 (76%)
in two clinical trials testing distinct 19-targeted CAR
constructs [39, 41]. The causes of the higher incidence
of CRS in pediatric patients are unknown but may be
related to higher cell dose used or the more immature
immune system of children.
The type of T cell-engaging agent affects the overall
risk as well as the onset of CRS. Even though the activation of T cells is the common underlying trigger in all
types of T cell-engaging therapies, there are also important differences between the different therapeutic agents
that affect the incidence, time course, and clinical management of CRS. Since CAR T cells can persist in the
circulation for more than 1 year, the risk for CRS extends for a longer period of time but generally is highest
up to 2 weeks after infusion. In CAR T cell therapy the
nature of the CAR construct influences the likelihood,
severity and time to clinical manifestation of CRS.
Whereas CRS was rarely observed in studies of first generation CAR T cell constructs that lacked additional
costimulatory signaling domains, CRS is much more
commonly reported with second generation CAR

constructs [42]. Even among the different second generation CARs there are differences in the rate of CRS.
CARs with the CD28 costimulatory domain induce a
brisk but self-limited CAR T cell expansion whereas the
4-1BB costimulatory domain promotes longer persistence [43]. CARs that incorporate a CD28 costimulatory
domain seem to be associated with a higher risk of CRS.
In two randomized trials of CAR T cells in patients with
NHL the incidence of CRS was 93% with a CD28-
containing CAR and 57% with a 4-1BB-containing CAR
[44, 45]. However, due to differences in the patient populations and differences in the definition of CRS, no definitive conclusions can be drawn with regard to CAR
design and the associated risk of CRS. Finally, the type
of lymphodepletion that was used prior to CAR T cell
infusion affected the risk of CRS. A higher incidence of
CRS was observed after lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide or fludarabine [26]. This was most likely a
consequence of the higher expansion rates secondary to
the more pronounced lymphodepletion achieved by
combination therapy.
Differential diagnoses
Clinically, CRS patients present with unspecific syndromes making the diagnosis challenging. It is important
to distinguish CRS from other inflammatory disorders
that present with similar clinical signs and symptoms
but require different treatment.
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) can mimic CRS and presents with symptoms such as fever, acute renal failure,
cardiac arrhythmia, and seizures. Although tumor lysis
syndrome usually can be readily discriminated from CRS
on the basis of characteristic laboratory abnormalities
such as hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, it can sometimes be difficult to
determine if CRS and tumor lysis syndrome occur
concurrently [46].
It is important to distinguish patients with CRS from
those with sepsis since the treatment for CRS could be
detrimental if used in patients with sepsis. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to distinguish sepsis from
CRS. In fact, according to the most recent definition a
large percentage of patients with severe CRS will fulfill
the clinical criteria of sepsis, i.e. suspected infection with
organ dysfunction defined as an increase of 2 points or
more in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(SOFA) score [47]. Furthermore, a significant proportion
of these patients will also fulfill the criteria for septic
shock since they have an elevated lactate and require
vasopressors.
Patients with CRS are at a high risk of infection and
the immunosuppressive treatment that is administered
for the treatment of CRS can mask some of the signs of
infection thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment of
infection. In one study of 133 patients receiving CD19-
targeted CAR T cell therapy, 23% of patients developed
infection within the first 4 weeks after CAR T cell infusion [48]. The infections typically began after the onset
of CRS. Among the 93 patients with CRS, 28 (30%) developed an infection.
Infections that occur in patients with CRS are predominantly of bacterial origin, followed by viral infections that primarily involve the respiratory tract. Fungal
infections are rare and were primarily observed in patients that had previously undergone autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation and were suffering from
severe CRS [48]. The majority of infections occurred
early after CAR T cell infusion and CRS severity was the
most important risk factor for infection. It therefore is
crucial to maintain a high degree of vigilance for infection and appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy
should be rapidly initiated if infection is suspected. All
patients with CRS should receive an extensive diagnostic
work-up to exclude infections, including a chest X-ray
and blood cultures. Furthermore, before start of immunotherapy patients should be carefully checked for
any signs of infection [49]. The mechanism that is responsible for the increased incidence of infection in patients with CRS is unknown. The CRS-associated
propensity for infections resembles the severe immunosuppression in patients HLH/MAS, which also are at a
high risk of serious infectious complications. A plausible
explanation could be that the massive release of cytokines in CRS induces a form of immune paralysis, which
predisposes the patients to an increased risk of infection.
This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that
the incidence of infections is higher in patients with
more severe CRS [48].
As already mentioned, a HLH/MAS-like syndrome
can develop as part of the CRS and usually is a manifestation of severe CRS. CRS-related HLH is difficult to distinguish from primary HLH or other conditions that can
mimic HLH such as sepsis. Table 2 summarizes some of
the factors that help to distinguish CRS-related HLH
from other conditions that present similarly. Even
though in most cases HLH/MAS that develops concurrently with CRS is triggered by CRS, other causes of
HLH/MAS, such as genetic defects (in pediatric patients), autoimmune disease, infection, or the underlying
malignancy itself should be taken into account. Patients
with severe neurotoxicity require a thorough neurologic
work-up which should include a careful neurologic exam
and, if appropriate, brain imaging, a spinal tab and an
electroencephalogram.
Since most T cell-engaging agents contain non-human
protein sequences there is a risk of allergic drug reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions can also present with
rash and urticaria, fever, dyspnea, hypotension and

gastrointestinal symptoms culminating in cardiorespiratory failure. Unlike in CRS symptoms of true type I reactions occur after repeated exposure to the causative
agent [50, 51]. Physicians should consider allergic reactions as a cause for the patients’ symptoms, in particular,
after repeat infusion of the immunotherapeutic agent.
However, so far only few cases of severe allergic reactions or anaphylactic shock related to immunotherapeutics have been described in the literature [52]. If
anaphylactic shock is suspected epinephrine and antihistamines should be administered immediately [53].
Given that all these differential diagnoses have a clinical presentation that is very similar to CRS, making a
definitive diagnosis of CRS is very challenging. Since
some of the therapies given for conditions other than
CRS can mitigate the effectiveness of immunotherapy,
the development of reliable diagnostic test that help to
make the diagnosis of CRS are a high priority for future
research. Such tests could greatly improve the effectiveness and safety of CAR T cell therapy.
Pathophysiology of CRS
The pathophysiology of CRS is only incompletely understood. CRS is usually due to on-target effects induced by
binding of the bispecific antibody or CAR T cell receptor
to its antigen and subsequent activation of bystander immune cells and non-immune cells, such as endothelial
cells. Activation of the bystander cells results in the
massive release of a range of cytokines. We know little
about how the initial activation of CAR T cells results in
the distortion of the cytokine network that drives the inflammatory process in CRS. Depending on a number of
characteristics of the host, the tumor, and the therapeutic agent the administration of T cell-engaging therapies can set off an inflammatory circuit that
overwhelms counter-regulatory homeostatic mechanisms
and results in a cytokine storm that can have detrimental effects on the patient. Figure 2 summarizes our
current understanding of the pathophysiology of CRS.
IL-6, IL-10, and interferon (IFN)-Υ are among the core
cytokines that are consistently found to be elevated in
serum of patients with CRS. In the setting of T cellengaging therapies, CRS is triggered by the massive release of IFN-γ by activated T cells or the tumor cells
themselves. IFN-γ causes fever, chills, headache, dizziness, and fatigue. Secreted IFN-γ induces activation of
other immune cells, most importantly macrophages [54].
The activated macrophages produce excessive amounts
of additional cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10.
TNF-α elicits flu-like symptoms similar to IFN-γ with
fever, general malaise, and fatigue but furthermore is responsible for watery diarrhea, vascular leakage, cardiomyopathy, lung injury, and the synthesis of acute phase
proteins.
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) seems to hold a key role in CRS
pathophysiology since highly elevated IL-6 levels are
seen in patients with CRS [5, 55–57] and in murine
models of the disease [58]. IL-6 can signal via two different modes. Classical IL-6 signaling involves binding of
IL-6 to membrane-bound IL-6 receptor. Of note, the IL6 receptor does not possess intracellular signaling domains. Instead, upon binding of soluble IL-6 to
membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, the IL-6/IL-6 receptor
complex binds to membrane-bound gp130, which initiates signaling through its intracellular domain. In transsignaling, IL-6 binds to the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor, which has been cleaved from the cell surface by
metalloproteinases. This soluble IL-6/IL-6 receptor complex binds to gp130 and therefore can also induce signaling in cell types that do not express membrane
bound IL-6 receptors [59].
IL-6 contributes to many of the key symptoms of CRS.
Via trans-signaling IL-6 leads to characteristic symptoms
of severe CRS, i.e. vascular leakage, and activation of the
complement and coagulation cascade inducing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [57, 60]. In
addition, IL-6 likely contributes to cardiomyopathy that
is often observed in patients with CRS by promoting
myocardial dysfunction [61].
Recently, Teachey et al. performed a screen for biomarkers in patients after CAR T cell therapy for ALL
and found that peak levels of IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor,

IFN-γ, and sgp130 correlated with the risk of severe CRS
in a cohort of 35 pediatric and adult B-ALL patients receiving CD19-CAR T cell therapy. They subsequently
validated these findings in 12 pediatric patients [62].
While limited due to the relatively small number of patients experiencing sCRS and limited availability of onsite cytokine measurement these tools might help in
identifying patients that need a more intense monitoring
and treatment.
A hallmark of severe CRS seems to be the activation
of endothelial cells. Typical marker of endothelial activation
such as Ang-2 and von Willebrand factor are often elevated
in the serum of patients with CRS [26]. This indicates that
the endothelium plays an important role in the pathophysiology of CRS both by amplifying the inflammatory response
and as a target organ. The crucial contribution of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CRS provides an explanation for some of the hallmarks of severe CRS, i.e.

Fig. 2 Reported inducers of CRS. CRS can be induced by direct target cell lysis with consecutive release of cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or by activation of T cells due to therapeutic stimuli with subsequent cytokine release. These cytokines trigger a
chain reaction due to the activation of innate immune cells like macrophages and endothelial cells with further cytokine release. Abbreviations: Ang-2:

capillary leakage, hypotension, and coagulopathy [26]. As
shown by a recent post mortem study in a patient who died
of CRS after CD19-targeted CAR Tcell therapy, endothelial
cells seem to be an important source of IL-6 in severe CRS
[63]. Importantly, endothelial activation and the ensuing
vascular dysfunction might be the mechanistic factor linking CRS with neurotoxicity. A recent study found that
neurotoxicity after immunotherapy with CD19-targeted
CAR T cells was accompanied by findings consistent with
endothelial activation [64].
In patients with CRS who develop a HLH/MAS-like
syndrome additional cytokines such as IL-18, IL8, IP10,
MCP1, MIG, and MIP1β are also elevated [62]. These
cytokines also have been reported to be elevated in classical HLH and MAS. Why some patients develop HLH/
MAS and others do not is poorly understood. Some patients may harbor genetic variants that predispose them
to developing HLH/MAS. In addition, IL-6 may also
promote the development of HLH/MAS in the setting of
CRS by inducing dysfunction of cytotoxic activity in T and
NK cells, which is a hallmark of HLH and MAS [65].
However, a link to genetic aberrations involved in the release of cytotoxic molecules (perforin, syntaxin) related to
familial HLH (PRF1, STX11, STXBP2, and MUNC13–4)
could not be established in a recent CAR T cell trial [55].
Clinical management of CRS
The management of the toxicities of cancer immunotherapy is challenging clinical problem. Since T cell-engaging
therapies are a relatively recent development there are still
many unanswered questions regarding the optimal clinical
management of CRS. The recommendations for the management of CRS are thus still evolving constantly. Current
treatment algorithms for CRS are based on expert opinion
and represent the experience of the pioneers in the field of
T cell-engaging immunotherapies [28, 29]. The most widely
used grading scheme for the severity of CRS was developed
by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (Fig. 3) [29].
Fig. 3 Proposed pathomechanism of CRS. Activation of manly T cells or lysis of immune cells induces a release of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). This leads to the activation of macrophages, dendritic cells, other immune cells and endothelial cells. These
cells further release proinflammatory cytokines. Importantly, macrophages and endothelial cells produce large amounts of interleukin 6 (IL-6)
which in a positive feedback loop manner activates T cells and other immune cells leading to a cytokine storm. Abbreviations: CAR: chimeric
antigen receptor; FiO2: fraction of inspired oxygen; IL-6: interleukin 6; IFN-γ: interferon gamma; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha

Even though there are many commonalities regarding
the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of CRS in
patients receiving BiTE or CAR T cells, there are also
important differences. The most important difference
between BiTE and CAR T cells is that BiTE can be given
repeatedly while CAR T cells are usually manufactured
in limited amounts and thus are only administered once.
The current approaches to prevention and treatment of
CRS in patients receiving these two types of T cellengaging therapies therefore differ substantially.
Effective management of patients that become critically
ill following T cell-engaging therapy requires close collaboration between different specialties including
hematology/oncology, neurology, radiology, and critical
care. ICU referral should be considered in all patients with
CRS and early involvement of the critical care team is
paramount [66]. Since even severe CRS has a relatively
good prognosis when appropriately treated, patients with
CRS should be offered the full spectrum of modern critical
care including mechanical ventilation if necessary [67].
The management of CRS follows a grade- and riskadapted strategy for monitoring and therapy [28, 29].
Fever is an important clinical sign that should raise the
suspicion of impending CRS in patients receiving T cellengaging therapies. In the case of CAR T cell therapy,
fever precedes the onset of CRS by at least 1 day and on
average occurs 3 days prior to CRS. Therefore, patients
who develop fever should be frequently reassessed for
signs of CRS and outpatients should be admitted to hospital for closer observation [26]. Serum CRP has been
suggested as a valuable biomarker for determining the
severity of CRS [36]. However, by itself CRP seem insufficient to reliably predict the occurrence or severity of
CRS [62]. Until better predictive biomarkers have been
discovered, clinicians should therefore maintain a high
alertness for the development of CRS in any patient following treatment with T cell-engaging therapies.
Low grade CRS is treated symptomatically with antihistamines, antipyretics and fluids. Additional diagnostic
testing should be performed to rule out differential diagnoses. If an infection cannot be ruled out with certainty
start of an empiric antibiotic therapy should be considered. Furthermore, all patients with early signs of CRS
should be regularly evaluated for signs of further
deterioration.
Severe CRS represents a life-threatening situation that
requires prompt and aggressive treatment. With the
BiTE blinatumomab the focus has been to prevent the
occurrence of severe CRS. Based on the insight gained
from the first clinical trials of blinatumomab a prophylactic protocol consisting of cytoreduction, dose adjustment, and premedication with corticosteroids has been
devised, that resulted in a reduced incidence of severe
CRS [68].
Unlike BiTEs, which can be given repeatedly, and can
be interrupted if necessary, CAR T cell therapies are
often administered only once and their final effective
dose after in vivo expansion is unpredictable. Therefore,
the primary aim in the setting of CAR T cell therapies so
far has been to efficiently treat severe CRS once it develops while trying to avoid mitigation of the antitumoral immune response.
The observation that IL-6 is elevated in the serum of patients with CRS following CAR T cell therapy has led some
investigators to consider tocilizumab for the treatment of
severe CRS. IL-6 represents a particularly suitable target
since IL-6 is of relatively little importance for T cell function [69, 70] but, as already mentioned, is a central driver
of many symptoms of CRS. By binding to membranebound as well as soluble IL-6 receptor tocilizumab interferes with both classical and trans-signaling pathways. Subsequent studies confirmed that administration of
monoclonal antibodies against IL-6 (siltuximab) and its receptor (tocilizumab) led to rapid resolution of CRS symptoms [29, 31, 33, 71]. In an early stage clinical trial
tocilizumab demonstrated a 69% response rate in patients
with severe or life-threatening CRS. As a consequence,
tocilizumab has quickly become the gold standard for the
initial treatment of severe CRS in patients receiving CAR T
cells. In August 2017, concurrently with tisagenlecleucel
the FDA approved tocilizumab for the treatment of CRS in
patients 2 years of age or older. The recommended dose
for i.v. application is 8 mg/kg body weight for adults and
12 mg/kg body weight for patients < 30 kg body weight up
to a maximum of 800 mg per dose with an interval between consecutive doses of at least 8 h [72].
Patients that develop grade 3 or 4 CRS toxicity should
immediately receive treatment with tocilizumab. Usually
significant resolution of CRS related symptoms e.g. fever
and hypotension is achieved within a few hours up to
2 days after the first application of tocilizumab. If no
such effect is evident within 24 to 72 h a second administration is feasible. Of note, it should be taken into consideration that after administration of tocilizumab CRP
can no longer be used as an indicator of CRS severity as
blockade of IL-6 signaling results in a rapid decrease of
CRP. Currently, there are several other IL-6-targeting
monoclonal antibodies in late stage clinical development,
which could also potentially be used to treat CRS. Siltuximab, is a chimeric, IGκ monoclonal antibody that binds
human IL-6 and prevents it from interacting with both
the membrane-bound and soluble form of the IL-6 receptor. Clazakizumab is another monoclonal antibody
targeting IL-6.
Corticosteroids should generally be avoided as first
line treatment of CRS in patients receiving CAR T cells
and should be reserved for cases refractory to IL-6
blockade or patients with severe neurotoxicity. Since

tocilizumab does not cross the blood-brain-barrier it
does not seem to be very effective against CRES and corticosteroids are thought to be more effective than IL-6
targeting in this setting [29]. The current recommendations therefore prefer the use of corticosteroids for the
treatment of the neurologic adverse effects of T cellengaging therapies. Monoclonal antibodies that target
IL-6 directly, thereby eliminating it from the circulation,
might be advantageous in patients with severe CRS and
concurrent neurotoxicity, since tocilizumab does not
cross the blood brain barrier and therefore fails to inhibit IL-6 signaling in the CNS. Corticosteroids should
also be considered in patients who develop HLHI/MAS
as part of their CRS. If corticosteroids are used in patients receiving T cell-engaging immunotherapy, the duration of treatment should be kept as short as possible to
minimize the detrimental effects on the effectiveness of
immunotherapy.
In cases where neither tocilizumab nor glucocorticoids
are effective blockade of TNF-α signaling has also shown
effectiveness. However, a case of sCRS that was unresponsive to tocilizumab, etanercept, and glucocorticoids has
been published [35]. In those cases other immunosuppressants, such as the IL-6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab
[73], T cell-depleting antibody therapies such as alemtuzumab and ATG, IL-1R-based inhibitors (anakinra) or cyclophosphamide might be of benefit. Other experimental
therapies for CRS include ibrutinib [74]. Moreover, there
are several reports of successful use of cytokine adsorption
in the setting of severe HLH unresponsive to standard
treatment [75, 76] that might also be effective in sCRS.
The administration of tocilizumab does not appear not
to negatively affect response rates to T cell-engaging
therapies [39, 77–80]. Interestingly, in some studies even
glucocorticoids did not seem to impact response rates
[39, 78, 80]. However, in a study of 30 B-ALL patients
treated with CD19-CAR T cells (CTL019) 2 of 9 patients
treated with immunosuppression eventually relapsed
with 11 patients relapsing overall within a follow-up of 2
to 24 months [32]. Similarly, in another B-ALL study
high-dose steroids markedly reduced CAR T cell expansion in three cases with severe CRS and all patients experienced disease recurrence after CD19-targeted CAR
T cell therapy [33]. In addition, smaller studies implicated a negative effect of glucocorticoid administration
on patient outcome: In a case report of 3 patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia the only patient
not completely responding to CD19-CAR T cell therapy
received glucocorticoids for CRS treatment [40].
There are a variety of preventative measures that have
the potential to reduce the incidence of CRS after immunotherapy [81]. One approach for mitigation of CRS
risk is dose-reduction. Dose adaption of CAR T cells to
tumor burden and the type of malignancy was shown to
be effective in preventing severe CRS [35] and dosereduced readministration of blinatumumab after a grade
IV CRS was shown to be safe [82].
It can be expected that the treatment algorithms for
CRS will change in the future as we gain more and more
experience with managing the side effects of T cellengaging immunotherapeutics. The effective treatment
of CRS with greatly benefit from the ongoing efforts for
harmonization of the grading system and treatment protocols for CRS.
Future outlook
The CRS is among the most frequent serious adverse
events and a represents a major cause of morbidity following T cell-engaging immunotherapy. Insights gained
from studying the biological mechanisms of CRS and
the clinical use of corticosteroids and IL-6 blockade have
already improved the management of patients with CRS.
However, there remain many unanswered questions and
there still is amble room for improvement of the clinical
management of CRS.
With the growing use of T cell-engaging therapies
there is an urgent need for clinical trials that improve
the evidence base for the treatment of CRS. Our current
management strategies for CRS are predominantly based
on biologic reasoning, expert opinion, and retrospective
analyses. In order to further improve the safety and effectiveness of the clinical management of CRS, randomized controlled trials that evaluate different treatment
strategies for CRS are necessary.
Furthermore, a primary challenge in the future management of CRS will be to identify additional targets for specific therapeutic intervention in CRS. Given the apparent
central role of the endothelium in the pathophysiology of
CRS and neurotoxicity following T cell-engaging therapies
further studies on the role of endothelial dysregulation in
CRS appear particularly promising and should provide
valuable insight that could lead to novel therapeutic
approaches.
The clinical management of CRS could further be improved by the identification of biomarkers that reliably
predict the development of CRS [83]. We will need to
develop tools that guide treating physicians in finetuning the use of pharmacologic agents that interfere
with these targets in order to ameliorate the adverse effects of CRS while maintaining the therapeutic activity
of T cell-engaging therapy.
Another promising line of research that will certainly
help to improve the safety of T cell-engaging immunotherapy focuses on the optimization of the design of the
compounds themselves [84]. Several research groups are
focusing on the design of improved CAR constructs with
high antitumor activity but a lower risk of CRS. Next
generation CAR constructs will enable the conditional

activation of CAR T cells or will include suicide switches
that allow controlled depletion of CAR T cells [85, 86].
Such improvements in the construction of immunotherapies will likely result in a further reduction of serious
adverse effects in the future.
Conclusion
In the wake of the remarkable success of recently developed immunotherapies the field of immuno-oncology is
poised to continue its rapid growth. As a consequence
of the more widespread application of immunotherapeutic anticancer agents an increasing incidence of CRS
cases can be expected in the upcoming years. A thorough understanding of the clinical presentation, underlying pathophysiology, and available therapeutic options
as well as the most important differential diagnoses is
crucial for the effective management of this clinical syndrome. Basic research findings and investigations of patients with CRS will provide valuable insight into the
underlying mechanisms of CRS and could aid in the development of molecularly-targeted treatment strategies
to prevent and treat CRS. The case of IL-6 blockade in
CRS illustrates the potential of targeted immunological
interventions for the management of toxicities of cancer
immunotherapy. With improved understanding of the
pathophysiology and increasing clinical experience in
toxicity management more specific mitigation of the
CRS will hopefully make cancer immunotherapy safer
and more effective.
