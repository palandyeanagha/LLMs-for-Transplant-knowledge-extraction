Abstract
Background: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is one of the most effective treatments for patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria. However, for patients beyond these criteria, the
recurrence rate is higher and the prognosis is worse. Sorafenib is the only drug showing survival benefits in
advanced HCC patients; however, its role in patients beyond the Milan criteria after OLT remains unclear and
requires further investigation.
Methods: As a case-control study, we retrospectively analyzed 17 Chinese patients beyond Milan criteria
undergoing OLT for HCC. These patients were stratified into adjuvant (n = 5), palliative (n = 6), and control groups
(n = 6).
Results: Nine of 11 patients who received sorafenib after OLT needed dose reduction due to more than grade 2
side effects. The disease-free survival rates for patients with or without adjuvant sorafenib were 100% versus 37.5%
(p = 0.034) at 6 months, 66.7% versus 9.4% (p = 0.026) at 12 months, and 66.7% versus 0.0% (p = 0.011) at 18
months, respectively. The overall survival rates for patients in palliative and control groups were 66.7% versus 40.0%
(p = 0.248) at 6 months, 66.7% versus 40.0% (p = 0.248) at 12 months, and 50.0% versus 20.0% (p = 0.17) at 18
months, respectively. Patients in the adjuvant group had better overall survival rates than those in the palliative
and control groups (p = 0.031) at 24-month follow-up.
Conclusions: Adjuvant sorafenib could possibly extend both disease-free and overall survival for HCC patients
beyond Milan criteria after OLT.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent
malignancy, especially in Asia. Liver cirrhosis is the strongest predisposing factor for HCC, accounting for approximately 80% of patients with this disease [1]; therefore, the
risk factors for liver cirrhosis are generally also the risk
factors for HCC. In the United States, Europe, and Japan,
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the major etiology of
liver cirrhosis and HCC [2]. Hepatitis virus B (HBV) infection, however, is the leading cause of HCC development in
most Asian countries other than Japan [3]. In addition to
HBV and HCV infection, alcoholic cirrhosis and metabolic
disorders can also act as risk factors for HCC. With an
increased understanding of epidemiology and tumor biology of HCC, better surveillance strategies for high-risk
patients have been proposed, including the use of serum
alpha-fetoprotein and abdominal ultrasound at intervals of
6 months [4]. The goal of this surveillance program is to
detect HCC in the early stage so that curative interventions can be introduced. Unfortunately, the prognosis of
patients with HCC remains dismal because early HCC can
be detected in only 30% of cases [5]. Thus, developing
effective but tolerable therapeutic modalities for advanced
HCC is an important and urgent issue.
The current management of HCC is essentially based
on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging

system. Briefly, for patients with very early (stage 0) and
early-stage diseases (stage A), surgical resection, percutaneous ethanol injection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA),
and orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are the therapeutic options with intention to cure [5]. A high incidence of recurrence, which cannot be prevented after
resection and RFA, is the major obstacle for these treatments. However, OLT differs from local resection and
RFA, and has the potential to provide oncological and
cirrhotic liver clearance. A study by Mazzaferro et al. [6]
shows that the overall survival (OS) at 5 years can be
approximately 70% in patients fulfilling Milan criteria.
For patients with advanced or unresectable disease, however, treatment options, such as transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) and sorafenib, are only palliative [7].
Although being far from a curative drug, sorafenib
remains one of the most encouraging successes among
the treatments of HCC in the past decade.
Sorafenib is a multiple tyrosine kinases inhibitor. Raf,
vascular endothelium growth factor, platelet-derived
growth factor, and c-kit are its target molecules. It is
believed that clinical benefits from sorafenib are because
it has both anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic effects
[8], as shown by the SHARP study, wherein sorafenib
was demonstrated to increase the median OS from 7.9
to 10.7 months in advanced HCC patients with ChildPugh A cirrhosis [9].
Although a retrospective study conducted by Fan et al.
[10] shows that the long-term relapse-free survival for
HCC patients beyond Milan criteria receiving OLT is
61.5%, the role of OLT in the treatment of large or multifocal HCC remains controversial. A strategy for prolonging both disease-free and OS in patients in this scenario is
a challenging but critical issue. The role of sorafenib in
such patients remains unclear and needs further investigation. For this purpose, we have conducted a case-control
study and retrospectively reviewed 17 Chinese HCC
patients who were beyond the Milan criteria but underwent OLT in our institution, 11 of whom received sorafenib in either adjuvant or palliative settings. This study
aimed to evaluate the survival benefits provided by sorafenib in these patients.
Methods
Patients
As a case-control study, 17 consecutive Chinese patients
with diagnoses of HCC confirmed histologically undergoing OLT were enrolled in this study retrospectively
from December 2004 to February 2011. All the 17 patients
were beyond the Milan criteria. Milan criteria was defined
as having a single tumor ≤ 5 cm or up to 3 separate lesions
with none larger than 3 cm, no evidence of gross vascular
invasion, and no regional nodal or distant metastases
when they underwent OLT [6]. Our patients comprised 13
males and 4 females, with a median age of 55 years (range,
39-79 years). Patients were stratified into adjuvant (n = 5),
palliative (n = 6), and control groups (n = 6). Patients in
the adjuvant group were those who received adjuvant sorafenib therapy within 6 weeks after OLT until further disease progression. Patients in the palliative group were
those who received palliative sorafenib therapy when local
or distant recurrence occurred after OLT. Sorafenib would
not be discontinued for patients in palliative group until
unacceptable toxicity or patients’ death. Patients in the
control group were those who received neither adjuvant
nor palliative sorafenib. Patients in each group had previously received radiotherapy, TACE, chemotherapy, or
RFA before or after OLT when active lesions were present.
The average number of days for follow up was 438.3
(range, 67-1714 days). This project was approved by the
institution’s review board (Taichung Veterans General
Hospital, Taiwan).
Tumor staging classification, surveillance, and survival
analyses
According to the performance scale, tumor status, and
liver function, we used the BCLC [7] system for tumor staging in our study. Following OLT, all patients underwent
chest X-ray, abdominal computed tomography, and serum
alpha-fetoprotein assessment as regular surveillance at
intervals of 3 months. The treatment response was evaluated according to the RECIST criteria [11]. Local recurrence and distant metastases as detected by imaging were
used to confirm disease progression. Disease-free survival
(DFS), which was defined as the period between the day of
OLT and the day of local or distant recurrence, was evaluated to clarify whether adjuvant sorafenib therapy was
beneficial. The OS in this study was defined as the period
from OLT or HCC recurrence to patients’ death for any
reasons.
Immunosuppressants for rejection prevention and
treatment
For the 11 patients who underwent OLT, except case 7
who was administered sirolimus (4 mg/M2 per day) for
rejection prevention, the other 10 patients received
tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg per day). Rejection episodes were
treated by methylprednisolone at an initial dose of
10 mg/kg per day, and adjusted according to the clinical
response.
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA and chi-square tests were used for
the comparison of patient characteristics in each group.
We calculated the OS and DFS using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All
the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results
Patient characteristics
All the clinical characteristics of the enrolled patients are
summarized in Table 1. Briefly, all the HCC cases in our
cohort were HBV or HCV related, accounting for 64.7%
(11/17) and 35.3% (6/11), respectively. Liver cirrhosis stratification revealed that 58.8% (10/17), 23.5% (4/17), and
17.6% (3/17) of cases to be Child-Pugh A, B, and C categories. According to the BCLC staging system, only 1
patient was classified as stage A, 6 patients at stage B, 7
patients as stage C, and 3 patients as stage D before transplantation. Most patients had received various treatments
before OLT, including TACE in 11, RFA in 4, and surgery
in 2 patients. Except two patients who had living liver
donors, the other 15 patients received their livers from
cadaveric donors. The average time of sorafenib use for
patients in adjuvant and palliative groups was 284 (range:
6 to 630) and 291 (range: 59 to 544) days, respectively.
Comparisons of clinical characteristics among the patients
from the 3 groups are listed in Table 2.
Sorafenib dose adjustment and toxicity
The targeted daily dose of sorafenib was 800 mg. The
dose of sorafenib was adjusted by patients’ tolerability
and safety, according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria version 3.0. Dose reduction was required if the adverse effects were greater than
grade 2. Nine of 11 patients (81.8%) needed dose reduction in four weeks after initiation of sorafenib in our
cohort. Only one patient discontinued sorafenib due to
intolerable adverse effect (grade 4 fatigue). The average
dose in our study was 472.7 mg per day with a range of
200-800 mg.
Adjuvant sorafenib improved DFS in HCC patients who
received OLT
In our cohort, 5 of 17 patients received adjuvant sorafenib, while 12 did not. The results of this analysis are
shown in Figure 1. Briefly, the DFS rates for patients
with or without adjuvant sorafenib were 100% versus
37.5% (p = 0.034) at 6 months, 66.7% versus 9.4% (p =
0.026) at 12 months, and 66.7% versus 0.0% (p = 0.011)
at 18 months, respectively. Adjuvant sorafenib therapy
thus significantly improved DFS in patients beyond the
Milan criteria after OLT.
Palliative sorafenib could possibly provide survival
benefits after HCC recurrence
Subsequently, we evaluated whether palliative sorafenib
provided survival benefits in HCC patients with recurrent

disease. Because all the patients in the palliative group
showed active disease progression, the progression-free
survival was not calculated. Results for OS are shown in
Figure 2. The OS rates for patients in the palliative and
control groups were 66.7% versus 40.0% (p = 0.248) at 6
months, 66.7% versus 40.0% (p = 0.248) at 12 months,
and 50.0% versus 20.0% (p = 0.17) at 18 months, respectively. Except case 16 who died of HCV reactivation, all
the other mortalities in both the palliative and control
groups occurred due to HCC progression. Although
there was no statistical significance, patients receiving
palliative sorafenib tended toward superior OS according
to the Kaplan-Meier survival curve.
Adjuvant sorafenib improved OS
We further evaluated whether sorafenib could improve
OS for HCC patients after OLT. The results of this evaluation are shown in Figure 3. All the patients in the
adjuvant group (n = 5) were alive at 12, 18, and 24
months after OLT. For patients in the palliative group,
66.7% (4/6) patients were alive at 12 and 18 months.
Further, 50% (3/5) patients were alive at 24 months. For
patients in the control group, however, 33.3% (2/6) were
alive at 12 and 18 months. Only 1 patient in this group
remained alive at 24 months after OLT. Thus, patients in
the adjuvant group showed a better OS rate than those in
the palliative and control groups (p = 0.031) at 24-month
follow up. Considering these results together, we
assumed that better DFS by adjuvant sorafenib therapy
may contribute to better OS for HCC patients beyond
the Milan criteria after OLT.
Discussion
The Milan criteria are considered a universal standard for
the selection of HCC patients for OLT. The debate
regarding the feasibility of transplanting a patient beyond
the Milan criteria has not been resolved thus far.
Although the relapse rate is higher, OLT remains the
only possible curative treatment for these patients. The
prevention of disease recurrence is extremely important
in these patients. Zhang et al. [12] evaluated the efficacy
of post-OLT adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen to patients beyond the Milan criteria, and concluded
that adjuvant FOLFOX could not prevent tumor recurrence but may improve the survival. One of the major
concerns for this study, however, was the possibility that
the cytotoxic agents used could damage the transplanted
livers, rendering sorafenib as a potential solution for

reducing the possibility of tumor recurrence. However,
there are only a few studies that have examined this
issue. Similarly, a phase 3 placebo-controlled randomized
trial is currently ongoing for evaluating whether sorafenib
can be an effective adjuvant therapy for HCC patients
after tumor resection or local ablation (STORM trial).
The results of this study would be available in the near
future, which can possibly establish the rationale of adjuvant sorafenib therapy after OLT in HCC patients
beyond the Milan criteria.
Although prospective and randomized-control studies
regarding the role of adjuvant sorafenib on post-OLT
HCC patients beyond Milan criteria remain unavailable,
there is a retrospective study conducted by Saab et al.
[13] suggesting that sorafenib has the potential benefit to
extend both DSF and OS in high-risk HCC patients after
OLT. In this study, the DFS and OS at 1 year is 85.7%
and 87.5%, respectively. Although there is no significant
statistical analysis in Saab’s cohort, this study provides
initial but important evidence that adjuvant sorafenib
could be effective for patients receiving OLT for HCC for
better DFS and OS. Results from our study further
demonstrated that patients receiving adjuvant sorafenib
had significantly better DFS than those who did not. Our
preliminary data showed that DFS rates in patients with
or without adjuvant sorafenib were 100% and 37.5% (p =
0.034) at 6 months, 66.7% and 9.4% (p = 0.026) at 12
months, and 66.7% and 0.0% (p = 0.011) at 18 months,
respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report
Figure 1 The disease-free survival rate was analyzed by the
Kaplan-Meier method. In patients with or without adjuvant
sorafenib, it was 100% versus 37.5% (p = 0.034) at 6 months, 66.7%
versus 9.4% (p = 0.026) at 12 months, and 66.7% versus 0.0% (p =
0.011) at 18 months, respectively. Adjuvant sorafenib could
significantly improve disease-free survival in patients beyond the
Milan criteria after orthopedic liver transplantation.
Figure 2 Overall survival rates for patients in the palliative and
control groups were 66.7% versus 40.0% (p = 0.248) at 6
months, 66.7% versus 40.0% (p = 0.248) at 12 months, and
50.0% versus 20.0% (p = 0.17) at 18 months, respectively.
There were no statistical differences between these two groups.
Figure 3 At 24-month follow up, the overall survival rates for
patients in adjuvant, palliative, and control group were 100%
(5/5), 50% (3/6), and 16.7% (1/6), respectively. Patients in the
adjuvant group had better overall survival than those in the
palliative and control groups (p = 0.031).

showing statistical significance for survival benefits in
post OLT HCC patients who are beyond Milan criteria.
The second aim of our study was to investigate the role
of palliative sorafenib in post-OLT patients with relapsed
HCC. One of the first studies regarding this issue was
conducted by Kim et al. [14], involving 9 patients who
received sorafenib after OLT for HCC recurrence. Survival benefits were not discussed in this study because the
purpose of the study was to evaluate drug safety and feasibility, and 6 of the 9 patients required dose reduction
due to side effects. A study conducted by Yoon et al. [15]
further surveyed the survival benefits by sorafenib in this
setting. Thirteen patients within the Milan criteria were
retrospectively reviewed, showing that the median progression-free survival and OS was 2.9 months and 5.4
months, respectively. Yoon et al. therefore suggested that
sorafenib could be a feasible treatment for recurrence
HCC in patients with OLT. In our study, because all the
patients in the palliative group had their disease in progression at the first follow up after initiating the treatment, progression-free survival could not be obtained in
our analyses. Although no statistical significance was
observed, a trend toward superior OS was noted for the
patients in this group as compared to those in the control
group. Variations in tumor recurrence location in the
palliative and control groups could possibly explain why
OS did not reach statistical significance in this analysis.
It has been demonstrated that TACE can prolong survival in patients with unresectable HCC [16]. In our cohort,
only 33.3% (2/6) patients in the palliative group experienced recurrence over liver parenchyma, indicating that
TACE could not have improved survival in the remaining
4 patients. In the control group, however, except 1 patient
who died of HCV reactivation, recurrence over the liver
occurred in 3 of 5 patients (60%). All of these 3 patients
had received TACE for their liver recurrence. This variation suggested that a larger portion of the patients in the
control group could possibly benefit from TACE. Our
speculation can be partially supported by a study conducted by Tan et al. [17], who demonstrated that in
patients with HCC recurrence after OLT, the median OS
for patients undergoing TACE with sorafenib and TACE
alone was 14 and 6 months, respectively (p = 0.005).
Patients who receive TACE with sorafenib thus had a better median OS than those who received sorafenib alone.
Performing TACE in patients with recurrent HCC after
OLT would thus further enhance the treatment efficacy of
palliative sorafenib therapy.
Was superior DFS by adjuvant sorafenib able to result
in superior OS? Our results showed that the answer to
this question was positive. Our data showed that
patients in the adjuvant group had better OS than those
in the palliative and control groups at 24-month follow
up (p = 0.031). This result supported the study by Saab
et al., that adjuvant sorafenib could significantly improve
both DFS and OS in post-OLT HCC patients beyond
the Milan criteria.
However, the retrospective nature and the small size of
our cohort were the major limitations of our study. In
addition, all patients in the adjuvant group were at BCLC
stage A or B, while most of patients in the palliative and
control groups were at C and D (p = 0.011). These findings suggested that the low recurrence rate in the adjuvant group could be partially because of the better BCLC
stage, instead of sorafenib alone. Further, a heterogeneous dose of sorafenib raised a new issue: the most optimal dose, either in the adjuvant or palliative setting, for
HCC patients after OLT needs to be examined.
In summary, our preliminary data showed that adjuvant sorafenib improved both DFS and OS in HCC
patients beyond the Milan criteria after OLT. Palliative
sorafenib could possibly prolong OS in post-OLT
patients with disease progression. Performing TACE in
these patients for liver recurrence might further provide
survival benefits. Prospective and randomized control
studies with larger cohorts are urgently warranted to
answer these questions.
