hepatitis B patients experiencing severe acute
exacerbation: a prospective observational study

Abstract
Background: Severe acute exacerbation in chronic hepatitis B could lead to mortality in some patients unless
timely liver transplantation is performed. The baseline bilirubin level has been reported to be an important
prognostic factor for mortality. Here we conducted a prospective observational study to examine the clinical
performance of this predictor.
Method: Twenty-one consecutive chronic hepatitis B patients experiencing severe acute exacerbation were treated
with either telbivudine or entecavir. The clinical characteristics at baseline and week-2 were documented and
correlated with mortality.
Results: Of the 21 patients included, 9 had baseline bilirubin >10 mg/dL. Four of these 9 patients (44.4%)
eventually died, whereas all other patients survived. During the initial 2-week period, the change of bilirubin
was −1.2 mg/dl in the survivors, but was +8.05 mg/dl in the mortalities (P = 0.009). When this on-treatment factor
was combined, 5 of the 21 patients had baseline bilirubin > 10 mg/dL plus an increase of bilirubin level at week-2.
Of these 5 patients, 4 (80%) died. Thus, by combining the baseline and on-treatment bilirubin levels, a positive
predictive value of 80% and a negative predictive value of 100% could be achieved. Other significant on-treatment
mortality predictors (at week-2) included higher international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (2.75 vs. 1.3,
P = 0.004), higher model for end-stage liver disease score (30 vs. 17, P = 0.006), lower alpha-fetoprotein level
(36.3 vs. 459.6 ng/mL, P = 0.039), and more rapid deterioration of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
(P = 0.008). Interestingly, during the course, deterioration of eGFR was statistically significant in entecavir-treated
(P = 0.028), but not in telbivudine-treated patients. Additionally, the patients treated with telbivudine had significant
increase in serum alpha-fetoprotein (27.9 to 191.9 ng/ml, P = 0.046) in the first 2 weeks, whereas the corresponding
feature was not found in those treated with entecavir (P = 0.139).
Conclusions: In this prospective observational study, we discovered that the baseline and on-treatment bilirubin
levels should be combined to achieve a better predictive value. Telbivudine might have a renoprotective effect in
addition to its efficacy in viral suppression in patients with severe acute exacerbation.

Background
Severe acute exacerbation (SAE) is not uncommon in
the natural course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, characterized by high serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, jaundice, coagulopathy and hepatic
decompensation [1-4]. The prognosis is poor with a high
mortality of 65-93% once hepatic encephalopathy has
occurred [4-6]. Thus, timely liver transplantation is indicated. The prognostic factors for mortality include high
serum bilirubin level, thrombocytopenia or liver cirrhosis, prolonged prothrombin time or high international
normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time, low serum
albumin level at baseline and emergence of ascites or
encephalopathy during the course [3,7-9]. However,
because of the retrospective nature of these studies, our
knowledge regarding the clinical usefulness of ontreatment factors in predicting mortality is very limited.
Furthermore, more and more potent antiviral drugs are
now approved for clinical use. Conceivably, effective
antiviral therapy would improve the survival of patients
with SAE and thus change the predictivity of previously
identified factors.
Lamivudine, a nucleoside analogue with inhibitory
effects on HBV polymerase/reverse transcriptase activity,
has been used as a rescue therapy for SAE in chronic
hepatitis B patients. However, the mortality rate remains
high, which varies from 13.5 to 38% in studies from different populations [3,7-11]. Entecavir (ETV) is a potent
inhibitor of HBV DNA polymerase with a high resistance barrier and Telbivudine (LdT) is an orally bioavailable L-nucleoside with rapid HBV suppression activity.
Both have been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B and have superior antiviral activity to lamivudine
[12-15]. ETV has been used in decompensated chronic
hepatitis B in clinical trials [16,17] as well as in clinical
practices [18,19] with satisfactory safety profile and
tolerability. On the other hand, the results from a 2-year
randomized clinical trial in treatment of decompensated
HBV-related cirrhosis also showed that LdT was well
tolerated and the treatment led to stabilization of liver
function [20]. Despite the availability of these evidences,
the clinical data regarding LdT usage in chronic hepatitis
B patients with SAE remain scanty.
Since all prognostic predictors for mortality are obtained from retrospective studies, it is unclear whether
the performance of these predictors is satisfactory in real
world, especially when patients with SAE are now being
treated with potent antiviral drugs. Of the baseline prognostic predictors, bilirubin level has been repeatedly
reported to be an important factor for mortality. In this
prospective observational study, we treated the SAE
patients with either ETV or LdT and examined the performance of the baseline bilirubin level together with
other mortality predictors. Additionally, we explored the
early on-treatment factors as accessory predictive factors
for mortality.
Methods
This was an open label, prospective observational study
of patients with chronic hepatitis B, admitted for spontaneous SAE to Chang Gung Memorial Hospital since
July 2009. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Chang Gung Medical Center and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients
enrolled. The SAE of chronic hepatitis B was defined as
elevation of ALT to greater than five times of upper limit
of normal (ULN, 36 U/L) with serum total bilirubin level
greater than 2 mg/dL and INR ≥ 1.3. The antiviral
therapy with nucleoside analogue was given under the
coverage of the national health insurance in Taiwan, because of the clinical status of hepatic decompensation.
Patients with coinfection of hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D
virus or human immunodeficiency virus and alcoholic
liver disease were excluded.
Twenty-one consecutive patients fulfilling the definition of SAE, treated with LdT 600mg/day (n = 9) or
ETV 0.5mg/day (n = 12), were included in this study. All
antiviral treatments were initiated within 1 week of
symptom onset. No antiviral treatment had been given
prior to the onset of this SAE. The decision of antiviral
drug was made by each patient and physician after discussion. The factors under consideration included risk
of resistance, oncogenic potential in animal study, and
possible renal function preservation. All patients were
followed at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and then every 3
months for liver biochemistry, INR, alfa-fetoprotein
(AFP), creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR). Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) was
calculated as described in the literature [21] at the corresponding time points. The eGFR was calculated by
modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula [22]
and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
(CKD-EPI) creatinine equation [23]. Serum HBV DNA
was tested at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 12 and then every 3
months using a standardized automated quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (Roche COBAS TaqMan
HBV Test, Roche Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA) with a detection range of 69 to 6.402 × 106 copies/mL.
Statistical analyses were performed by Statistical
Package for Social Science Statistics (SPSS Statistics,
version 17.0, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables
were expressed as median (range) and were compared
by Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical variables were
compared by Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as
appropriate. HBV DNA level was logarithmic transformed for analysis. The paired comparison of two relative variables was performed by Wilcoxon signed rank
test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
The baseline and week-2 clinical parameters associated
with mortality
The median (range) age was 48 (28–71) years and 18
(86%) were males. The median (range) follow-up period
was 19.4 (0.8-28.2) months. All patients had a known
history of chronic hepatitis B with positive serum HBV
surface antigen (HBsAg) detected at least 1 year before
SAE. All patients were negative for IgM class anti-HBV
core antibody. Three patients had liver cirrhosis at the
time of SAE and three had ascites due to liver failure. Four
patients died at the time of 0.8, 1.0, 1.9 and 2.5 months
during follow-up with 1-month and 3-month mortality
rate of 9.5% and 19%, respectively. The overall mortality
rate was 19% (2 with LdT, 22.2%; 2 with ETV, 16.7%).
The median levels of serum total bilirubin, INR and
MELD scores at baseline in the mortalities were
20.6 mg/dL, 3.3 and 31.5, respectively. These were significantly higher than the corresponding figures in those
who survived (7.7 mg/dL, P = 0.007; 1.5, P = 0.002; and
19, P = 0.003, respectively). The difference was also
statistically significant in serum albumin (2.95 vs.
3.6 mg/dL, P = 0.020) and HBV DNA level (5.06 vs.
8.16 log10 copies/mL, P = 0.031) between patients with
mortality and survival, as shown in Table 1. The serum
ALT, creatinine, eGFR by MDRD and CKD-EPI, platelet
count and AFP were not statistically different in the
mortalities and survivals.
At week 2, patients with mortality had significantly
higher serum total bilirubin (29.1 vs. 4.8 mg/dL,
P = 0.003), INR (2.75 vs. 1.3, P = 0.004) and MELD
score (30 vs. 17, P = 0.006) than the corresponding
figures of those who survived. On the contrary, the
survival patients had significantly higher AFP (459.6 vs.
36.3 ng/mL, P = 0.039), as shown in Table 2. There
was no significant difference in serum ALT, creatinine,
eGFR (MDRD and CKD-EPI) and HBV DNA levels at
week 2 between the survivals and the mortalities.

Changes of clinical parameters between baseline and
week-2 for all patients
To understand the progressive changes of clinical parameters during the treatment course, comparison of clinical factors at baseline and week 2 for all patients was
performed (Table 2). The serum ALT and HBV DNA decreased significantly (1270 to 167 U/L, P < 0.001 and 8.04
to 4.19 log10 copies/mL, P < 0.001, respectively) in the first
2-week of antiviral treatment with paired comparison
(Table 2). The serum creatinine increased significantly
from baseline to week 2 (0.68 to 0.94 mg/dL, P = 0.002)
despite of treatment. Correspondingly, the eGFR calculated by MDRD (116 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2
, P = 0.005)
and CKD-EPI (111.1 to 98.3 mL/min/1.73m2
, P = 0.003)
decreased significantly during the 2-week period. The
AFP increased significantly (65.7 to 305.5 ng/mL,
P = 0.013) from baseline to week 2. There was no significant difference between baseline and week 2 in serum
total bilirubin, INR and MELD score.
Similar progressive changes for all the clinical parameters were found in the survival group, including the
declines in serum ALT and HBV DNA levels (1270 to
184 U/L, P < 0.001 and 8.16 to 4.2 log10 copies/mL,
P = 0.001, respectively), the increases of serum creatinine (0.71 to 1.0 mg/dL, P = 0.019) and decreases of
eGFR (MDRD, 113.5 to 76 mL/min/1.73m2
, P = 0.042;
CKD-EPI, 110.1 to 82.9 mL/min/1.73m2
, P = 0.028), and
the increases of AFP (49.4 to 459.6 ng/mL, P = 0.005)
(Table 2).
The changes (Δ) of parameters between baseline and the
week 2 time point in association with mortality
When comparing the parameters in terms of the
changes (Δ) from baseline to week 2, the mortalities had
significantly greater increase in serum total bilirubin
(Δ=+8.05 vs −1.2 mg/dL, P = 0.009) and creatinine
(Δ=0.49 vs 0.08 mg/dL, P = 0.049) levels, and more
rapid decrease in eGFR (MDRD, Δ=−85.5 vs −16 mL/
min/1.73m2
, P = 0.008; CKD-EPI, Δ=−35.5 vs −6.0 mL/
min/1.73m2
, P = 0.049) (Figure 1). The serum AFP
increased in the survivals (Δ=184.2 ng/ml) but decreased in the mortalities (Δ=−73.2 ng/ml) with marginal significance (P = 0.057). The survivals had HBV
DNA decline of 3.4 log IU/mL and only 1.4 log IU/mL
in the mortalities (P = 0.074) (Table 3).
Of the 17 survivors, 5 had bilirubin >10 mg/dL at
baseline, a feature predicting high mortality according to
previous studies [7-9]. As such, only 4 of 9 (44.4%) with
baseline bilirubin level > 10 mg/dL resulted in mortality.
The positive predictive value (PPV) using only baseline
bilirubin level was 44.4%.
However, of these 9 patients, 4 of them showed decrease
of bilirubin levels at week 2 and all these 4 patients survived (Figure 2). By using baseline bilirubin >10 mg/dL,
combined with increase of bilirubin levels during the first
2-week period, 5 patients meeting these two criteria were
identified. Four of these 5 patients resulted in mortality.
The positive predictive value (PPV) was 80% and the
negative predictive value (NPV) was 100% by use of the
combination criteria.
The efficacy of viral suppression and change of renal
function in LdT and ETV treated patients
Of these patients, 9 were treated with LdT and 12 received
ETV immediately after the diagnosis of chronic B hepatitis
with SAE. As shown in Table 1, the baseline clinical characteristics were similar in patients receiving LdT and
ETV. After 2 weeks of treatment, there was no statistical
difference in the clinical parameters between the two
treatment groups (Table 2). Two deaths occurred in each
group (by 1.9, 2.5 months in LdT group and 0.8, 1.0

Both LdT and ETV showed excellent effects on declines in
serum ALT (1523 to 184 U/L, P = 0.011 and 870 to
133.5 U/L, P = 0.002, respectively) and HBV DNA levels
(8.04 to 3.96 log10 copies/mL, P = 0.018 and 8.04 to
4.20 log10 copies/mL, P = 0.005, respectively) in the initial
2-week period of treatment. The patients treated with
LdT had significant increase in serum AFP (27.9 to 191.9
ng/ml, P = 0.046) in 2 weeks, whereas the corresponding
feature was not found in those with ETV treatment
(P = 0.139).
Although serum creatinine levels at week 2 were
higher than those at baseline in both LdT and ETV
groups, the difference was statistically significant in ETV

group (0.71 to 0.9 mg/dL, P = 0.051). The decrease of
eGFR using MDRD formula was significant in the LdT
group (116 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2
, P = 0.044) but not the
ETV group (127 to 79 mL/min/1.73m2
, P = 0.050). The
decrease of eGFR using CKD-EPI equation was also statistically significant in ETV group (110.6 to 86.9 mL/min/
1.73m2
, P = 0.028), but not in LdT group (112 to 98.3 mL/
min/1.73m2
, P = 0.066). The changes (Δ) from baseline to
week 2 in serum ALT, total bilirubin, creatinine, eGFR
(MDRD and CKD-EPI), INR, AFP, HBV DNA level and
MELD score were similar in LdT and ETV groups without
statistically significance (Table 3).
Until the last visits, all survived patients were uneventful during follow-up and no drug-resistance was found
in patients treated with LdT.
Discussion
This prospective observational study revealed not only the
baseline but also the on-treatment predictors for mortality
of chronic hepatitis B patients with hepatic decompensation secondary to SAE. In consistent with previous studies
[3,7-9], the patients with mortality had significantly lower
serum albumin, higher total bilirubin level and INR at
baseline. The present study also showed significantly
higher baseline MELD score in patients with mortality. At
the week 2 time point, the serum total bilirubin, INR and
MELD scores were significantly lower and AFP was significantly higher in the survivors (Table 2). The present results indicated that decreasing serum total bilirubin, INR
and MELD score and increasing serum AFP at week 2
were good indicators for survival in SAE of chronic hepatitis B. In the meanwhile, it was noted that an increase in

serum total bilirubin (baseline to week-2) in the patients
combined with baseline bilirubin >10 mg/dl had the
PPV of 80% for mortality, while the NPV was 100% for
decreasing serum total bilirubin in the 2-week period.
The overall mortality rate was 19% which was higher
than that of a recent study in Hong Kong [19], but was
lower when compared with the studies using lamivudine
or tenofovir treatment [3,7,8,24]. The different study
populations and timing to begin antiviral therapy may
lead to this discrepancy.
Previous studies have shown that the HBV DNA level
at the time of SAE had little correlation with short-term
mortality [3,7-9,19]. However, the baseline HBV DNA
level was significantly lower in patients with mortality in
the present study. It might be attributive to the enhanced immune response in SAE, which led to massive
hepatocellular necrosis and clearance of the majority of
HBV. The results of aggravated liver injury and decreased liver reservation could increase the chance of
mortality. At week 2, the HBV DNA levels were comparable between patients with survival and mortality, but
the decline from baseline to week 2 was marginally
greater in the survival patients (Table 3). Both LdT and
ETV had excellent efficacy in viral suppression to high
but not to low viral load at baseline. The virological decline was around 3 log10 IU/mL during 2-week period of
LdT and ETV treatment. The rate of viral suppression
was faster when compared with previous studies [12-15].
Serum AFP has been a marker of bridging hepatic necrosis in acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B when
it is greater than 100 ng/mL [25], and an increasing level
suggests the occurrence of hepatic regeneration in acute
hepatitis or after partial hepatectomy [26,27]. Previous
studies showed that decreasing serum AFP levels predicted poor prognosis of acute hepatic failure in patients
with chronic hepatitis B and an increase in AFP level
was strongly associated with a favorable outcome in patients with acetaminophen-induced liver injury [28,29].
The data in present study revealed that serum AFP
levels in survival patients at week 2 were significantly
greater than those in patients with mortality. It therefore
could be inferred that the patients with increasing AFP
levels likely had good hepatic regeneration and reservation and were able to survive in the SAE of chronic
hepatitis B. However, the reason for significantly greater
increase in AFP from baseline to week 2 in patients
treated with LdT was unknown. But this could suggest
that liver regeneration might be better under LdT
treatment.
The deterioration of renal function is a prognostic factor indicating poor prognosis in liver disease [30]. In the
present study, the serum creatinine was significantly
higher at week 2 than at baseline with correspondingly
significant decrease in eGFR by MDRD and CKD-EPI in
all patients (Table 2). It meant that renal dysfunction did
occur at the early stage of liver decompensation resulting
from SAE. In view of the change (Δ) from baseline to
week 2, the deterioration of renal function was greater in
those with mortality (Table 3). These results indicated that
follow-up of serum creatinine with accompanied eGFR
calculation is important in acute decompensated hepatitis
patients for prediction of short term mortality and early
preparation for liver transplantation. However, the serum
creatinine production could decrease secondary to decreased hepatic creatine synthesis in severe liver disease
and the eGFR can be overestimated [31]. Thus, the serum
creatinine and eGFR in decompensated liver disease
should be interpreted cautiously.
Since tenofovir was not available until 2011 June in
Taiwan and the renal function was concerned, two nucleoside analogues, LdT and ETV, were used in present
study. Both drugs are superior to lamivudine in viral
suppression and treatment efficacy [12-15] and both had
good safety profiles and tolerability in decompensated
liver disease [16-20]. Of note was that the serum creatinine was significantly higher at week 2 than at baseline
in ETV group, but not in LdT group. The same observation was noted in eGFR by CKD-EPI with statistically
significant decrease in ETV group but not in LdT group.
This observation correlated with the results of a recent
clinical study of LdT in decompensated liver cirrhosis
that the eGFR was significantly increased in LdT group
[20]. Although the reason is still unknown, the nucleoside analogue of LdT seemed to be able to slow down or
prevent the progression of renal impairment in acute decompensated hepatitis. This might be critical for these
patients to gain more time for hepatic recovery and thus
increase the chance of survival.
One of the limitations of this study is a small number
of cases. This is partly due to the prospective nature of
this observational study for validation purpose. Most
chronic hepatitis B patients are now under antiviral
treatment in Taiwan and thus the incidence of SAE is
decreasing. In the future, if more patients can be included, a better clinical correlation can be made.
Conclusions
In conclusion, increasing serum total bilirubin and
deterioration of renal function were important ontreatment predictors of mortality in SAE-related decompensated liver disease. Increasing AFP might indicate
good hepatic regeneration and thus constitute a favorable factor for survival. LdT treatment might preserve
the renal function in addition to its efficacy in viral
suppression.
