of non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease 
among patients with heart failure 
with preserved ejection fraction

Insulin resistance and altered energy metabolism is common in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) and appears to also be associated with myocardial dysfunction. We aimed to evaluate 
prevalence, staging and clinical features correlated with NAFLD among patients with heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Adults with HFpEF were prospectively enrolled. 
Demographic and clinical data were collected. NAFLD was defned based on liver biopsy, abdominal 
imaging or ICD-coding and the absence of other liver diseases. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariable 
analyses were performed. 181 patients were analyzed. The median age was 70 with 89% white, 59% 
female, median BMI 35.1, and 48% with diabetes. NAFLD was present in 27% of the full cohort and 
50% of those with imaging. In patients with imaging, multivariable analysis identifed diabetes (OR 
3.38, 95% CI 1.29–8.88) and BMI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.19) as independent correlates of NAFLD. 
54% of NAFLD patients had a NAFLD fbrosis score consistent with advanced fbrosis. Cirrhosis was 
present in 6.6% of patients overall and 11.5% with imaging. NAFLD patients had a higher frequency 
of advanced heart failure (75% vs 55%, p 0.01). NAFLD has a two-fold higher prevalence in HFpEF 
compared to the general population and is independently associated with BMI and diabetes. Patients 
with HFpEF and NAFLD also appeared to have more advanced fbrosis including cirrhosis suggesting 
a potential synergistic efect of cardiac dysfunction on fbrosis risk in NAFLD. This data supports 
consideration for evaluation of underlying liver disease in HFpEF patients.
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are two 
disease entities that have been growing in prevalence over the last decade. HFpEF is now more prevalent than 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and NAFLD is estimated to be present in 25–30% of the 
adult United States population1,2
. Tis high prevalence likely relates to the association of these entities with 
obesity-related conditions including hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia1,3
. While multiple studies have linked NAFLD with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality, particularly in 
terms of coronary artery disease, the relationship between NAFLD and heart failure is less clear. Emerging data 
has outlined an association between NAFLD and changes in myocardial structure and diastolic dysfunction2,4,5
. 
Te relationship between NAFLD and HFpEF remains unclear and requires further investigation in order to 
inform clinical management of this population.
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence and correlates of NAFLD among a cohort of patients with 
HFpEF. In addition, we aimed to evaluate disease stage among this unique patient population. We hypothesized 
that NAFLD is prevalent at higher rates in HFpEF than in the general population, and that individuals with both 
HFpEF and NAFLD may have more advanced disease stage due to synergistic efects of metabolic risk factors 
on progression of disease.

Methods
Patient population. Patients who met diagnostic criteria for HFpEF and who were followed as part of 
the University of Michigan HFpEF outpatient clinic were prospectively enrolled into a research database. Te 
diagnosis of HFpEF was ascertained by board certifed cardiologists with expertise in this disease entity (S.L.H. 
or M.C.K.). HFpEF was defned according to the criteria established by the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines6
. In brief, this defnition requires symptoms and signs of heart failure (elevated natriuretic peptide and either relevant structural heart disease or diastolic dysfunction) among patients with ejection fraction 
≥50%. Te database encompasses patients presenting from February 2014 to February 2018.
Data collection. At the time of enrollment, demographics, vital signs, medications, and comorbid conditions were recorded. New York Heart Association (NYHA) classifcation was documented as an assessment of 
heart failure severity. Dyslipidemia was defned based on use of statin or cholesterol lowering medications or 
ICD-9 or 10 codes. Additional data not entered at time of initial enrollment were abstracted retrospectively via 
electronic chart review. Laboratory data including complete blood cell counts, lipids, kidney function, hepatic 
panel, international normalized ratio (INR), hemoglobin A1c, and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were 
abstracted if obtained during routine clinical care within two years of the initial clinic encounter. Echocardiograms (ECHO) obtained within 2 years of the clinic encounter were reviewed and measurements of chamber 
size, wall thickness, diastolic function, and right ventricular function were recorded. Te study was approved by 
the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB). Given use of de-identifed patient data, the IRB 
granted exception for need of individual patient consent for the retrospective analysis. All patients provided 
informed consent to initially be included in the HFpEF registry. All methods were performed in accordance with 
the relevant guidelines and regulations.
Assessment of liver disease. Te diagnosis of NAFLD was ascertained using a combination of natural 
language processing program (University of Michigan EMERSE7
) and manual chart review by a board certifed hepatologist (M.A.T.) with specifc expertise in NAFLD7
. A patient was classifed as meeting criteria for 
NAFLD if they had any of the following in the absence of other causes of liver disease: evidence of steatosis or 
steatohepatitis on liver biopsy; imaging [including ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] noting hepatic steatosis; a clinical diagnosis code (ICD-9 or 10) for NAFLD or 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); or a combination of the above. Given clinical practice patterns, very few 
patients had liver biopsy performed and thus it was not possible to defnitively distinguish NAFLD vs NASH 
among the entire cohort. Patients were also assessed for a history of signifcant alcohol use (defned as >21 
drinks per week in men and >14 drinks per week in women or clinical diagnosis of alcohol use disorder) based 
on chart review. In addition, charts were reviewed for other causes of chronic liver disease including viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease or hereditary forms of liver disease. Te presence of cirrhosis was determined 
based on results of imaging or ICD-9 or 10 codes. To assess stage of liver disease, a Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index and 
NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) were calculated for each patient, both of which have been used in heart failure 
patients8–10. Advanced fbrosis was defned using the validated cut-ofs of >0.675 for NFS and >3.25 for FIB411,12. For multivariable analysis of correlates of advanced fbrosis, we used results of NFS and those meeting 
criteria for cirrhosis based on imaging results or ICD-9 or 10 codes.
Statistical analysis. Given the sample size, data were evaluated for normality and summarized with 
median and interquartile range (IQR) values or percentages as appropriate. Te Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test, 
Chi-square and Fisher exact and t-testis were used to compare diferences in clinical variables between patients 
with and without NAFLD or advanced fbrosis. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to 
identify signifcant predictors of NAFLD and advanced fbrosis. Candidate covariates were assessed for inclusion into the multivariable model based on p values <0.10 in the univariate analysis and biologic plausibility. We 
performed a subanalysis among patients with abdominal imaging as this subset represents individuals in whom 
some sort of screening for NAFLD was performed and thus could more defnitely categorize patients for the 
presence or absence of NAFLD. p values <0.05 were considered statistically signifcant. All statistical analyses 
were performed in SAS (Version 9.4, Copyright 2016 by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Patient population. All 181 patients enrolled in the HFpEF clinical database were analyzed. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Te cohort consisted primarily of advanced age, white females with obesity. Te 
vast majority had hypertension and dyslipidemia. Regarding heart failure severity, 61% had severe heart failure 
symptoms (NYHA classifcation III–IV). Diastolic dysfunction of grade ≥2 diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography was noted in over 40% of patients.
Prevalence and correlates of NAFLD. Overall, 49 patients (27%) met criteria for NAFLD and 12 had 
imaging consistent with cirrhosis. Patients with NAFLD had higher BMI (p=0.004) and more frequently had 
diabetes (p=0.03) and NYHA class III–IV heart failure (p=0.01). Of note, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was lower in the patients with NAFLD (p=0.02) though a greater percentage of NAFLD patients were 
receiving statin therapy (p=0.18). On multivariable analysis, only LDL was associated with risk of NAFLD 
within the overall cohort (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99, p=0.04, Supplemental Table 1).
Analysis of only patients with prior abdominal imaging (N=96) noted a higher prevalence of NAFLD (50%) 
and cirrhosis (11.5%) (Table 2). Among patients with imaging, NAFLD patients again had higher BMI, rates of

diabetes and more severe heart failure. Tey also had higher median septal thickness (11 vs. 10 mm, p=0.01). 
On multivariable analysis, BMI (OR 1.11 per unit kg/m2
, 95% CI 1.04–1.18, p=0.001) and diabetes (OR 3.38, 
95% CI 1.29–8.88, p=0.01) were associated with an increased risk of NAFLD (Table 3). Of note, patients who 
underwent imaging were less likely to have anemia and had lower measures of right ventricular systolic pressure, 
B-type natriuretic peptide, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (Supplemental Table 2).

Prevalence and risk factors for advanced fbrosis or cirrhosis. A total of 88 patients (48.6%) had 
advanced fbrosis or cirrhosis by imaging or NFS (Table 4). Among individuals with NAFLD, 54% had NFS 
consistent with at least advanced fbrosis. Cirrhosis was present in 6.6% of patients overall and 11.5% of patients 
with imaging. In the overall cohort, patients with advanced fbrosis or cirrhosis were older, had higher BMI, 
and more likely to have diabetes, atrial fbrillation and chronic kidney disease. On echocardiography, those with 
advanced fbrosis or cirrhosis also had larger lef atrial diameter (47 vs 43) and more commonly had ≥grade 2 
diastolic dysfunction. As expected, these patients also had higher INR and total bilirubin levels. On multivariable analysis, older age, higher BMI and presence of diabetes were all independently associated with advanced 
fbrosis or cirrhosis. (Table 5; Fig. 1).

Discussion
Te clinical and public health implications of obesity and metabolic syndrome are continuing to expand with 
increasing prevalence of chronic conditions stemming from these processes. While individual obesity related 
conditions have been investigated in detail, there has been less data evaluating concomitant disease processes and 
how these comorbid conditions interact to impact disease severity and progression. In this study, we highlight the 
signifcantly higher prevalence of NAFLD in a well-defned cohort of HFpEF patients and note the more advanced 
disease stages (both heart failure class and hepatic fbrosis stage) present in this unique patient population.
Prior literature has shown a clear association between NAFLD and overall cardiac dysfunction4,13–16. However, there is conficting data in terms of the relationship between NAFLD and specifc patterns of cardiac 
dysfunction17–19. To date, there has been most focus on the relationship between NAFLD and diastolic dysfunction. HFpEF has become a prominent condition in our aging population with high rates of comorbid chronic 
conditions. Given the nuances in making an accurate diagnosis of HFpEF, evaluation for these concomitant 
disorders can be challenging. In this well characterized cohort of HFpEF patients, we found that NAFLD was 
present in 27% of the full cohort and 50% of individuals with prior imaging, and thus prior evaluation for possible 
NAFLD. Tis 50% prevalence is twofold higher than the general population. As would be expected, diabetes (OR 
3.38) and BMI (OR 1.11) were independently associated with NAFLD among patients with HFpEF. Interestingly, 
while heart failure severity was associated with higher prevalence of NAFLD on univariate analysis, this did 
not remain signifcant on multivariable analysis. No other cardiac parameters on echocardiography, including 
evidence of diastolic dysfunction or right-sided heart failure, were found to be independently associated with 
NAFLD either. Tis high disease prevalence is clinically signifcant as patients with NAFLD have been shown to 
have increased mortality compared to matched controls without NAFLD, and given that the presence of NAFLD 
is associated with a 26% higher health care cost20,21. NAFLD patients have also been shown to have more severe 
metabolic derangements compared to individuals with obesity without NAFLD, making their clinical management more challenging22.
In addition to high disease prevalence, in this cohort we also noted an important association between more 
advanced heart failure and hepatic fbrosis stage among individuals with both HFpEF and NAFLD. In this patient 
population, 49% of the patients had advanced fbrosis or cirrhosis by imaging or NFS. Among individuals with 
NAFLD, 54% had NFS consistent with at least advanced fbrosis. Cirrhosis was present in 6.6% of patients overall 
and 11.5% of patients with imaging. Tis prevalence of cirrhosis is markedly higher than the cited prevalence of 
cirrhosis for adults in the United States (0.27%)23. Older age (OR 1.07), higher BMI (OR 1.07) and diabetes (OR 
3.93) were independently associated with advanced fbrosis or cirrhosis among patients with HFpEF. Again of

note, no specifc cardiac parameters on echocardiography appeared to be independently associated with more 
advanced hepatic fbrosis. Prior studies have noted an association between NAFLD and indices of impaired 
relaxation and increased lef-sided chamber pressures on echocardiography14,17,18,24. Tis fnding is important 
given that prior data that has shown that liver disease stage is strongly linked with outcomes among patients with 
heart failure9,25. More advanced liver fbrosis has been associated with volume overload, diastolic dysfunction, 
impaired exercise capacity, and higher mortality in patients with HFpEF5,8,9
. NAFLD may be linked to HFpEF 
progression through its association with increased epicardial fat, particularly in patients with more advanced 
liver fbrosis19,24,26. Epicardial adipose tissue is associated with the secretion of proinfammatory adipokines that 
can cause atrial and ventricular fbrosis27. In addition, epicardial fat and hepatic triglyceride content in NAFLD 
patients are associated with myocardial insulin resistance and reduced myocardial perfusion. It is well known 
that patients with heart failure can develop “cardiac cirrhosis” due to chronic hepatic congestion with resultant 
fbrosis28. As such, there is likely a synergistic efect of heart failure with potential for hepatic congestion and 
injury and primary hepatic insult from NAFLD.
Given these high rates of comorbid conditions, it is relevant that current therapeutic interventions used as 
frst line therapy for these diseases have shown beneft from both a cardiac and hepatic perspective. Caloric 
restriction and aerobic exercise training additively improve exercise capacity in HFpEF, representing two of the 
only evidence-based therapies for the condition29. Similarly, structured nutrition and exercise interventions in 
NAFLD patients have successfully achieved weight loss is associated with improvements in degree of hepatic 
steatosis, infammation and fbrosis30. Terefore, metabolic ftness programs could be designed to target both 
HFpEF and NAFLD concurrently31. As new treatments for NAFLD become available, the efect of these treatments on myocardial metabolism, structure and function should be investigated given the possibility of shared 
pathophysiologic mechanisms.
Tere are several limitations to our study that are important to highlight. First, the small sample size limits 
our ability to evaluate in detail parameters that might impact disease severity. Future studies with larger cohorts 
would have more power to evaluate correlations between more detailed ECHO parameters with prevalence and 
severity of NAFLD. Second, while patients were enrolled prospectively, NAFLD data were reviewed retrospectively. Such chart review has inherent limitations in terms of misclassifcation bias and missing data. However, 
we used previously validated methods to determine the presence of NAFLD and its severity. Both HFpEF and 
NAFLD disease classifcations were made by experts in these disease states which represents a strength of the 
study as these entities can be difcult to assess. A combination of diferent diagnostic approaches is currently 
used in clinical practice for both NAFLD and HFpEF. Te methods used in this paper refect current clinical 
practice and society guidelines for making these diagnoses, though we acknowledge the limitation these place in 
terms of reproducibility of our study. Data capture in our electronic health system is also quite robust which is 
another strength of this study given the extent of characterization available for this cohort of patients. Tere is 
potential concern that patients with more advanced disease are those who underwent imaging, but analysis of 
patient characteristics by imaging status only noted diferences in baseline anemia, lower RVSP, lower BNP and 
lower total cholesterol compared to those without imaging. As such, if anything this suggests that the imaging 
group may be lower risk for more advanced disease.
In conclusion, in this study of well characterized HFpEF patients, we noted a signifcantly higher prevalence 
of NAFLD (50%) compared to the general population and found that the majority of patients with NAFLD 
had evidence of advanced hepatic fbrosis. Presence of diabetes and obesity were most strongly correlated with 
NAFLD, whereas older individuals with these metabolic risk factors appeared to have highest rates of more 
advanced liver disease. Interestingly, no specifc echocardiography parameters including right ventricular function or diastolic dysfunction were independently associated with more advanced liver disease. Tis questions 
the common assumption that cirrhosis in the setting of heart failure is from hepatic congestion alone28. Taken 
together, our data further adds to the discussion in terms of role for evaluation for underlying liver disease in 
patients with multiple cardio-metabolic risk factors as many of these patients already have advanced liver disease 
and liver disease stage has been shown to be linked with higher risk of adverse cardiac outcomes. As cost-efective 
screening and risk stratifcation methods for NAFLD continue to be refned, clinicians will be better able to tailor 
evaluation to at risk patients including those with HFpEF. In the interim, continued optimization of obesity and 
metabolic conditions remain a mainstay of therapy for both NAFLD and HFpEF.
