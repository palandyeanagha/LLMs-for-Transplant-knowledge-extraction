Currently, immunotherapy has shown great efficacy in clinical trials, and monoclonal
antibodies directed against immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 have shown encouraging
results in first-line or second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients.
Meanwhile, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint drugs combined with other treatments,
such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy as well as anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint therapy, are
considered an attractive treatment with higher efficacy. However, toxicity associated with
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is worth attention. Understanding the adverse effects caused by
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppressive agents is vital to guide the clinical rational use of
drug. In this review, we summarized the adverse effects that occurred during the clinical
use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and
discussed how to effectively manage and respond to these adverse reactions.

INTRODUCTION
Currently, cancer is still a key threat to human health (1). Among them, lung cancer is the leading
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and about 80% of lung cancer is non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), with poor prognosis (2, 3). Encouragingly, the blockade of immune checkpoints
against PD-1/PD-L1 has dramatically changed the treatment prospects for patients with NSCLC
(4–6). The traditional treatments of cancer are mainly target at the cancer cells themselves, while
the main goal of tumor immunotherapy is to enhance or restore the monitoring and killing effect of
the body’s immune system on tumors (7–9). There are many immune checkpoint molecules in the
body, which are involved in maintaining the body’s immune balance and its own immune tolerance
(10). Among them, PD-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) are classic
co-inhibitory molecules that suppress the immune response (11–13). Tumor cells overexpress the
immunosuppressive surface ligand PD-L1, which interacts with T cell molecules, leading to T cell
failure (14, 15). Knowledge based on the immune escape mechanism of cancer cells has led to the
development of immunological checkpoint inhibitors (16, 17).
In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been widely used in tumor
immunotherapy (18, 19). ICIs based on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been proved to exhibit
promising therapeutic effects in a variety of advanced cancers (20–22). For example, the anti-PD-1

Su et al. Adverse Effects of Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy
ICIs nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown exciting results
in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and NSCLC (23,
24). Moreover, anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab, atezolizumab
as well as avelumab have also shown anti-tumor activity in
a number of tumor types. However, it is worth noting that
as the immune system is reactivated, the body’s immune
tolerance imbalance occurs (10). Immunotherapy leads to the
emergence of novel toxic features, known as immune-related
adverse events (irAEs), by reactivating the immune system (14).
Although severe irAEs are rare, they can be life-threatening
without intervention and proper management (25, 26). In
addition, it has also been reported that the combined use of
PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs with chemotherapeutics or other targeted
therapies leads to the emergence of new toxic reactions (14).
Therefore, raising our awareness of these adverse events (AEs)
is critical to optimize the clinical efficacy and safety of these
new immunotherapeutic.
In this review, we summarized the adverse reactions of the
five FDA-approved targeted PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint
drugs currently used in the clinic when used alone or
in combination with other treatments in NSCLC patients.
We aim to raise awareness of the clinical manifestations,
diagnosis, and management of these toxic reactions through
our summary.
MECHANISM OVERVIEW OF PD-1/PD-L1
BLOCKADE
PD-1, also known as CD279, is a type I transmembrane protein
of the immunoglobulin superfamily (27). As a transmembrane
protein, PD-1 inducibly expressed on the surface of activated
T cells, B cells, NKT cells and antigen presenting cells (APC)
(15, 28). PD-1 interacts with two major ligands, PD-L1 and
PD-L2, resulting in disruption of intracellular signaling and
down-regulation of effector T cell function (18, 29). The
binding affinity of PD-1 and PD-L1 is three times than of
PD-1 and PD-L2 (30). Studies showed that PD-1 is expressed
in multiple type of cells, including T cells, B cells, dendritic
cells, monocytes as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs), while PD-L1 is expressed in cancer cells and APC
(31, 32). PD-L1 expression is mainly affected by Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) (33, 34). TLR-mediated PD-L1 regulation is
dependent on activation of MEK/ERK kinase, which enhances
PD-L1 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription by nuclear
factor kappa B (35). PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 expressed
on T cells, leading to the negative regulation of effector T
cell activation, thereby causing cancer cells to secrete the
proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-2, and IFNγ, and become more aggressive (30). IFN-γ receptors 1 and
2 are also involved in the regulation of PD-L1 expression,
primarily through JAK/STAT-mediated IRF-1 activation (35).
In addition, other immunosuppressive cells in the tumor
microenvironment (TME), such as regulatory T cells, tumorassociated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells,
also express PD-1 to maintain a highly immunosuppressive
microenvironment (Figure 1) (36, 37).
ADVERSE EFFECTS BASED ON
PD-1/PD-L1 BLOCKADE FOR NSCLC
THERAPY
To date, several anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint agents
have been approved for the treatment of NSCLC, including
two anti-PD-1 drugs pembrolizumab and nivolumab, as well as
three anti-PD-L1 drugs atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab
(38, 39). Blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint leads
to the development of new toxicities by reactivation of the
immune system, also known as irAEs (26). These irAEs
may affect multiple organ systems and tissues, with clinical
manifestations of autoimmune-like/inflammatory side effect that
may cause damage to the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver,
endocrine glands, and skeletal muscle (12). In addition, the
most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) include
fatigue, fever/chillness and infusion reactions (9). Furthermore,
rare and serious TRAEs have been reported, including immunerelated encephalitis (40), myasthenia gravis (41), acute renal
failure/interstitial nephritis (42), and myocarditis (43). Here,
we list the TRAEs caused by PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in
the treatment of NSCLC in Tables 1, 2, respectively, both
monotherapy and combination therapy are included.
COMPARISON OF THE TOXICITY
SPECTRUM BETWEEN PD-1 AND PD-L1
INHIBITORS IN THE TREATMENT OF
NSCLC
At present, although various PD-1 and PD-L1 ICIs have shown
activity in NSCLC, it is meaningful to analyze and compare
the differences in their toxicity profiles (69). According to the
results of a systematic meta-analysis by Pillai et al., there was
no significant difference in the overall incidence of AEs between
the PD-1 treatment group (n = 3284) and the PD-L1 treatment
group (n = 2460) (69–71). However, any grade of irAEs in
the PD-1 treatment group was slightly higher than the PD-L1
treatment group (16 vs. 11%; p = 0.07) (69). The most common
AE of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors is fatigue (19 vs. 21%, p = 0.4),
while the most common irAE is hypothyroidism (6.7 vs. 4.2%;
p = 0.07) (69). It was worth noting that in patients receiving
PD-1 inhibitors, the incidence of pneumonitis was significantly
higher than in the PD-L1 agents treatment group (4 vs. 2%; P
= 0.01) (69, 70). Therefore, clinicians should be more alert to
lung inflammation in NSCLC patients receiving PD-1 blockade
therapy (69).
At present, there is no systematic study to analyze the
differences in the toxic and side effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
alone or in combination with other therapies for NSCLC.
However, the current clinical trial data seems to indicate that the
overall incidence of AEs of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor monotherapy
is lower than that of combination therapy. For example, any grade
of TRAEs that occurred with pembrolizumab monotherapy was
70.9% (24), while pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy
showed a higher incidence of TRAEs (98.2%) (50). Several other

Su et al. Adverse Effects of Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy
FIGURE 1 | Mechanisms of cancer cell mediated immune escape. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) absorb antigens released by cancer cells and present them to T
cells to promote T cells activation and high expression of PD-1. Upon T cell activation, the PD-1 receptor binds to PD-L1/PD-L2 expressed on the surface of cancer
cells and suppresses the immune response. In addition, tumor cells can also present antigens directly to activated T cells in the context of MHC. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1
antibodies can block the above process and enhance the body’s immune response.
clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors that have been approved
for the treatment of NSCLC also showed the same trend (54, 56).
MANAGEMENT OF ORGAN-SPECIFIC
TOXICITIES CAUSED BY ANTI-PD-1/PD-L1
TREATMENT
Skin-Related Adverse Events
Rash and pruritus are the most common skin irAEs that occur in
NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint
treatment (12). Skin-related irAEs usually occur after the second
cycle of the patient’s clinical course (72, 73). Other dermatological
lesions include vitiligo, skin capillary hyperplasia (CCEP),
lichenoid and bullous pemphigoid (74). Despite frequent reports
of immune-related skin AEs, the incidence of skin AEs of grade
III or higher is low, and life-threatening AEs are only occasionally
reported, but still deserve attention (74). For PD-1/PD-L1
monotherapy, the incidence of treatment-related skin AEs of any
grade is ∼7–31%, and the incidence of grade III or higher AEs
is lower. Existing clinical trial data showed that the incidence of
skin-related AEs of anti-PD-1 monotherapy was slightly higher
than that of anti-PD-L1 monotherapy (11–31 vs. 7–19%) (24, 53,
67, 75). In addition, the emergence of skin toxicity caused by
pembrolizumab seems to be more frequent than other anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents (24, 67, 75). However, there was no significant
difference in the incidence of skin-related AEs between anti-PD1/PD-L1 monotherapy and combination therapy (24, 47). Recent
studies have shown that patients with complete/partial remission
have a higher incidence of skin adverse reactions than patients
with stable/progressive disease, suggesting that skin AEs may be
a positive prognostic factor for patients, but more prospective
studies are still needed to further verify this kind of association
(76, 77). However, a basic skin examination is necessary for
patients using ICIs, especially those with previous inflammatory
skin diseases. Standard dermatological assessments include skin
biopsies, kidney and liver function tests, serum tryptase as well as
immunoglobulin E levels (74).
For mild (grade I–II) maculopapular patients, it may be
managed successfully with moderate potency topical steroids
to affected areas and/or oral prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day
(78). For grade III–IV maculopapular, immunotherapy may
be temporarily held and patients should be treated with
high potency topical steroids to affected areas and oral
prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day (increase dose up to 2 mg/kg/day
if no improvement) (79). In addition, topical emollients,
oral antihistamines and lidocaine patches are effective
for pruritus. For patients with severe pruritus, the GABA
agonists (gabapentin, pregabalin) are useful, and aprepitant or
omalizumab can be used in refractory cases (79).
Respiratory System Related Adverse
Events
Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy also frequently occurs
respiratory system-related AEs, especially for patients with
lung cancer, the incidence of such AEs seems to be higher (69).
Among them, immune-related pneumonia is the most common.
Pneumonia is defined as focal or diffuse inflammation of the lung
parenchyma, including pulmonary sarcoidosis and organizing

Su et al. Adverse Effects of Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy
FIGURE 2 | Main adverse events of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Adverse events associated with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of
NSCLC involve multiple tissues and organs, including endocrine system, respiratory system, digestive system, cardiovascular system, skeletal muscle system, liver,
and skin-related adverse reactions.
inflammatory pneumonitis (80). Once pneumonia occurs, it may
endanger the life of the patient, so active interventions should
be taken (12, 80). The incidence of pneumonia is generally
7.4–24.3 months after the start of treatment. The clinical
symptoms are mainly dry cough, dyspnea, fever, and chest pain
(12, 81). It is worth noting that the combination of ICIs and
other drugs at risk of pneumonia will increase the incidence
of pneumonia (82). Chen et al. (83) reported an unpredictable
but relatively severe radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP), which
was induced by anti-PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab 2 years
after radiotherapy. This indicated that previous radiotherapy
combined with subsequent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy may
result in overlapping damage to lung (83). Moreover, patients
with other underlying lung diseases, such as COPD and
pulmonary fibrosis, should be more alert to the occurrence of
pneumonia (84, 85).
Chest CT is a key method for diagnosing pneumonia. The
imaging features are ground-glass lesions and/or disseminated
nodular infiltrates (12, 86). According to the management
of the latest NCCN guidelines, any level of immune-related
pneumonia should hold immunotherapy, and patients
with severe pneumonia should permanently discontinue
immunotherapy. Patients with mild (grade I) pneumonia need
to re-evaluate arterial oxygen saturation (both resting and active)
and repeat chest CT in 4 weeks or as clinically indicated for
worsening symptoms (78, 87). For grade II or higher pneumonia
should first rule out bacterial infections, such as nasal swab
for potential viral pathogens, sputum culture, blood culture,
and urine antigen test to detect pneumococcus and legionella
(87). Additionally, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage
are necessary. If the infection cannot be completely ruled out,
empiric antibiotics can be used. Management is guided by
clinical symptoms, such that grade II pneumonia patients can
be taken orally or intravenously prednisone/methylprednisolone
1–2 mg/kg/day (86, 87). Severe cases require hospitalization and
intravenous methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day. Other forms
of immunosuppression may be considered, such as infliximab,
mycophenolate mofetil or intravenous immunoglobulin,
if corticosteroids remain ineffective after 48 h of
treatment (86, 87).

Digestive System Related Adverse Events
Colitis and diarrhea are the most common gastrointestinal
toxicity during the treatment of anti-PD-1/PD-L1
immunotherapy (24). Other gastrointestinal adverse reactions
include decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation
(24). Colitis clinically involves clinical or imaging evidence
of abdominal pain symptoms and colon inflammation, while
diarrhea refers to an increase in stool frequency (72). In immune
checkpoint blocking therapy, the incidence of gastrointestinal
AEs with anti-CTLA-4 treatment is higher than that with
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (72). Moreover, anti-PD-1/PD-L1
agents combined with chemotherapy drugs will increase the
incidence of gastrointestinal AEs (any grade) (23, 56). In general,
the incidence of grade III–IV colitis/diarrhea is about 5%
and life-threatening cases are rarely reported (12). In clinical
management of immune-related colitis and diarrhea AEs, stool
evaluation should be performed to rule out any possible bacterial,
viral pathogen, and parasitic infections (88). For mild diarrhea or
colitis, it is useful to oral loperamide or diphenoxylate/atropine
for 2–3 days and hydration (78, 88). Moderate or severe
colitis/diarrhea should hold immunotherapy. Patients with grade
3 may consider re-use of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy after toxicity
has been relieved, but patients with grade IV should permanently
discontinue immunotherapy (78). Patients with grade IV may be
successfully managed by using prednisone/methylprednisolone
(1–2 mg/kg/day). If the symptoms do not improve,
consider adding infliximab or vedolizumab within 2 weeks.
Severe cases should be hospitalized to provide supportive
treatment (78).
Hepatic Toxicities
Among NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1
immunotherapy, the incidence of immune-related hepatitis
is approximately 5%, while the incidence of severe hepatitis
(grade III-IV) is <2% (89). The median time to onset is usually
6–14 weeks from the first taking of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 drugs,
but may occur within a few months after starting treatment or
even stopping treatment (89). Any asymptomatic elevations in
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) enzymes levels should consider immune-related hepatitis
(78, 90). Some patients occasionally observe elevated levels of
bilirubin, usually without obvious symptoms. In addition, liver
biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing and evaluating the
degree of autoimmune hepatitis and liver injury (90). The clinical
symptoms of immune-mediated hepatitis include hepatomegaly,
portal and periportal inflammation, lymphadenomegaly,
and infiltrating eosinophils, lymphocytes as well as plasma
cells (90). Before treatment of immune-related hepatitis,
viral etiology (hepatitis A, hepatitis B or C, and emergency
hepatitis E virus), disease-related liver dysfunction, and other
drug-induced transaminase elevations should be excluded.
Ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
can be considered to rule out liver metastases or gallstones
of cancer (78). For mild to moderate hepatitis (grade I–II),
immunotherapy can be continued or suspended according
to the patient’s condition, and liver function tests (LFTs)
are closely monitored. Patients with grade III–IV hepatitis
should permanently discontinue immunotherapy and use
prednisone/methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day. If the steroid

treatment does not improve after 3 days, consider adding an
additional immunosuppressant mycophenolates, but should not
use infliximab as its potential hepatotoxicity (78).
Endocrine System Related Adverse Events
The endocrine system contains many important organs of the
human body, such as hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal
glands, and pancreas. The endocrine toxicity caused by PD1/PD-L1 ICIs may affect any axis (12). Hypophysitis, thyroiditis,
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency
are common immune-related endocrine diseases (44). Among
patients with NSCLC, hypothyroidism is the most common
endocrine toxicity, with an incidence of 5–15% (44). Since
the clinical symptoms of immune endocrine disease are
non-specific, such as fatigue, headache, and nausea. Cancer
patients are often accompanied by such symptoms. Therefore,
the diagnosis of immune-mediated endocrine toxicity is
clinically challenging (12). Clinically, endocrine diseases such
as central hypothyroidism and pituitary inflammation are
diagnosed by evaluating biochemical indicators such as morning
cortisol, ACTH (adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone), FSH (folliclestimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), TSH (thyroid
stimulating hormone), free T4, and DHEA-S (91). For patients
with hypothyroidism, the thyroid hormone replacement therapy
may be useful, and closely monitor the level of TSH is
necessary (every 4–6 weeks) (78). If TSH > 10, levothyroxine
should be used to make TSH reach the reference range or
age-appropriate range. Patients with hyperthyroidism can be
treated with standard antithyroid drugs. In addition, pituitary
inflammation with obvious symptoms can be considered with
prednisone/methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for treatment
(78). Primary adrenal insufficiency occurs less frequently in
irAEs related to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, but in rare
cases an adrenal crisis may occur (91). It should hold the
immunotherapy and perform intravenous corticosteroid as well
as supplement aggressive fluid and electrolyte when such AEs
occur (91). Most endocrine-related toxicity is effective through
hormone replacement therapy, without holding PD-1/PD-L1
immune checkpoint treatment.
Skeletal Muscle System Related Adverse
Events
Some tumor patients receiving anti-immunity checkpoint
treatment will also have skeletal muscle system-related AEs,
but musculoskeletal symptoms are also present in the tumor
patients themselves, therefore more attention should be paid
to distinguishing (81). Overall, the majority of immune-related
muscle AEs in patients with NSCLC are mild (grade I-II). The
diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis is mainly by evaluating the
degree of joint involvement, X-ray and joint ultrasound (78).
Moreover, it is necessary to check the creation kinase/aldolase
and troponin levels. NSCLC patients have the most reported
immune-related muscle adverse reaction is myalgia (43). Patients
with mild pain can continue immunotherapy and continuously
monitor serial aldolase/creatine kinase levels, but moderate or
severe pain should hold immunotherapy, using prednisone 1–2
mg/kg/day for treatment and considering muscle biopsy (72).

Su et al. Adverse Effects of Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy
MANAGEMENT OF OTHER COMMON
ADVERSE EVENTS
Fatigue
Fatigue widely occurs in patients with NSCLC who are treated
with PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (12). Overall,
for NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy or
combination therapy, ∼6–71% of patients reported treatmentrelated fatigue (any grade), but the incidence of grade
III/IV is low (<5%) (24, 45, 56). Compared with antiPD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 ICIs combined with
other therapies (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, anti-CTLA4 therapy) significantly increased the incidence of fatigue side
effects (6–33 vs. 13–71%) (47, 54, 75). However, it is worth
noting that fatigue symptoms are sometimes caused by immunerelated endocrine toxicity. For example, early symptoms of
hypothyroidism can also cause fatigue (81). Therefore, the
treatment of fatigue should consultation based on abnormalities,
and the use of low-dose steroids is allowed (78). In addition,
moderate physical activity and psychosocial intervention can
also help relieve fatigue symptoms (72). For severe fatigue,
consideration should be given to whether tumor disease
progression or other medical diseases occur (78).
Pyrexia/Chills and Infusion Reactions
Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapy may cause
cytokine release and non-specific over-activation of the immune
system, which may lead to symptoms of pyrexia, chill and
infusion reactions in patients (81). Approximately 5–18% of
patients with NSCLC develop immune-related pyrexia during
treatment. It can be managed by using antipyretics, such as
acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (78).
For grade I–II infusion reactions, it can resume infusion
or reduce the infusion rate after the symptoms disappear,
and consider premedication with acetaminophen, famotidine,
and diphenhydramine with future infusions. For grade III
infusion reactions, the immunotherapy should be permanently
discontinued, and intravenous antihistamine or corticosteroid
drugs are required (74, 78).
MANAGEMENT OF RARE BUT SERIOUS
ADVERSE EVENTS
Immune-Related Encephalitis
Immune-related encephalitis is a rare and poorly understood
irAE, with an incidence of <1% in cancer patients undergoing
immune checkpoint blockade therapy, but it may be fatal (92).
Therefore, it is necessary to increase its awareness for effective
management. A multicenter cohort retrospectively analyzed
the clinical, biological, and radiological characteristics of nine
immune-related encephalitis in NSCLC patients undergoing
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment (40). The most common clinical
symptoms of these patients include fever, confusion, and
cerebellar ataxia (40). In addition, it was found that the levels
of white blood cell increased, without any bacterial and viral
infection. One patient’s brain MRI examination showed that the
limbic system is involved, which is fatal (40). The most important
management of immune-related encephalitis is early treatment
with corticosteroids (prednisone 1–2 mg/kg/day). Severe cases
should permanently discontinue immunotherapy (78).
Myasthenia Gravis
The immune-related myasthenia gravis is also a rare but
serious neurotoxicity caused by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment
(43, 91). The average onset time of the patient’s symptoms
appeared within 6 weeks of starting treatment (range 2–12
weeks) (93). Treatment-related reports of myasthenia gravis
in NSCLC patients receiving PD-1 monoclonal antibodies
seem to be more common than those receiving PD-L1 agents
(41, 94, 95). A 63-year-old female patient with stage IV
NSCLC adenocarcinoma, who failed conventional chemotherapy
(disease progression) and subsequently used pembrolizumab,
was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis after two cycles of
treatment (41). The clinical symptoms are bilateral eyelid
drooping, extraocular muscle paralysis, shortness of breath, and
fatigue (41). Moreover, two patients with NSCLC who received
nivolumab reported myasthenia gravis, and the onset time was
within 2–3 cycles after the start of treatment (94, 95). Moderate
and severe autoimmune myasthenia gravis should permanently
discontinued immunotherapy, as well as oral pyridostigmine
30 mg TID and gradually increase to maximum of 120 mg four
times a day as tolerated and based on symptoms (93). In addition,
considering low-dose oral prednisone 20 mg daily and gradually
increase the dose (not more than 100 mg/day) if necessary.
Severe cases should use methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day and
consider adding rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 treatments
or 500 mg/m2every 2 weeks for 2 doses) if refractory to
plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (93).
Acute Renal Failure/Interstitial Nephritis
The main manifestation of kidney injury is elevated serum
creatinine levels, and patients usually develop acute renal
failure and interstitial nephritis (96). According to reports, the
possible mechanism of kidney damage induced by ICIs is that
drugs or drug metabolites activate circulating T cells, which
binding to carrier proteins and form drug-carrier immune
complexes to obtain immunogenicity (97). When these immune
complexes are presented as a local antigen to the kidney,
they trigger a hypersensitivity reaction through the release of
cytokines, leading to the occurrence of kidney damage (97). In
NSCLC patients, a phase I study (NCT01454102) of nivolumab
combined with platinum-based dual chemotherapy reported 3
cases of grade 3 acute renal failure. In addition, Koda et al.
(42) reported a 67-year-old stage IV acute tubulointerstitial
nephritis caused by nivolumab monotherapy in patients with
NSCLC. For the management of acute renal failure/interstitial
nephritis, creatinine, and urine protein levels should be closely
monitored (once every 3–7 days), and prednisone 0.5–1
mg/kg/day may be useful (42). Patients with severe kidney
injury should permanently discontinue immunotherapy and use
prednisone/methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day. Conduct renal
biopsy and nephrology consultation if necessary. Moreover, add
one of the following drugs, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,
cyclosporine, infliximab, and mycophenolate, if the symptoms

Su et al. Adverse Effects of Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy
still not improve after treated with steroids for more than 1
week (42).
Myocarditis
Immune-mediated cardiotoxicity, myocarditis, is a rare but
serious side effect in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1/PDL1 immune checkpoint treatment, which needs to be recognized
as soon as possible for better management (98–100). A case
report showed that a 75-year-old NSCLC patient suffered a
drug-induced AE of myocarditis during the ninth cycle of
nivolumab treatment, and its clinical symptoms were dyspnea
and acute chest pain (98). After treatment with ACE-inhibitors,
β-blockers and diuretics as well as prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day),
the cardiac function of patient was significantly improved (98).
Similarly, Gibson et al. (101) reported that a 68-year-old female
NSCLC patient receiving nivolumab developed autoimmune
myocarditis. The patient’s electrocardiogram showed sustained
ventricular tachycardia and ectopic ventricular beats (101). In
addition to the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of
myocarditis, other immunosuppressive agents such as antithymocyte globulin, infliximab and mycophenolate can also be
added if necessary (Figure 2).
PREVENT OR REDUCE THE FREQUENCY
OF ADVERSE EVENTS
Potential Predictive Biomarkers Related to
Adverse Effects
The effective management strategy for irAEs is early detection
and early intervention. Therefore, it is crucial to find biomarkers
that can predict the occurrence of AEs during immunotherapy
(102). Recently, a study performed by Kurimoto and his colleague
found that serum thyroglobulin, thyroid autoantibodies and early
changes in the levels of certain cytokines (increased levels of IL1β, IL-2, and GM-CSF and decreased levels of IL-8, G-CSF, MCP1) may indicate the development of autoimmune thyroiditis AEs
(103). Similarly, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin
antibody levels are associated with hypothyroidism in NSCLC
patients receiving nivolumab treatment (104). Oyanagi et al.
(105) reported that the increase in serum protein RANTES is a
potential predictive biomarkers of the onset of irAEs in NSCLC
patients who treated with nivolumab. In addition, the increase
levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with a
higher incidence of irAEs, but not with the severity of irAEs and
the affected organ (106). For rare but severe immune-mediated
myocarditis, several potential predictive biomarkers have also
been found, such as serial troponin, miR-30c (107, 108).
Baseline Examination Before
Immunotherapy Initiation
By comparing the changes of certain biochemical indicators
and imaging features of tissues and organs before and after
immunotherapy, it can help clinicians to quickly judge any
irAEs that may occur (109). Routine baseline assessments
include physical examination (height, weight, heart rate, blood
pressure, and other general symptoms), imaging examination
(chest CT, brain MRI) as well as laboratory tests (blood routine,
blood biochemistry, blood glucose, total bilirubin, TSH, free
T4, LH, FSH, testosterone, cortisol, ACTH, infectious disease
screening, etc.) (109). In addition, carefully ask patient and
family the history of autoimmune disease, infectious disease and
organ specific diseases are necessary. Clinicians also need to
inform patients of potential side effects of immune checkpoint
blockade therapy, whether during or after treatment (73).
Patients should also promptly feedback any new symptoms
of discomfort.
PERSONALIZED MANAGEMENT
Tumor patients of different races, genders, and ages experience
different irAEs profiles and severity, therefore precise care
according to the patient’s personal situation is conducive to
reduce the incidence of AEs (110). Elderly people with lung
cancer usually have comorbidities and polypharmacy, therefore
adequate clinical monitoring is required (110). However,
Hakozaki et al. (111) showed that polypharmacy was not
associated with irAEs but was associated with higher rate of
unexpected hospitalizations during anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment
in early NSCLC patients (aged ≥ 65 years) in Japanese. Studies
have also shown that immune-related fatigue is more common
in elderly patients with lung cancer (aged ≥75 years) (49.1
vs. 40.2%), but no other differences in irAEs are observed,
and it is not recommended to adjust the dosage of elderly
patients (109, 110). Given the small number of elderly patients
involved in most immune checkpoint blockade studies, the
toxicity data for this group is limited and further studies
are needed (112). PD-1/PD-L1 blockade may aggravate or
reactivate certain existing viral infectious diseases, therefore
patients with a history of chronic viral infections (such as
HBV, HCV or HIV) should be excluded from clinical trials
(109). Due to the ability of IgG to cross the placental barrier,
ICI is not recommended for pregnant and lactating women
unless the clinical benefit of the patient outweighs the potential
risk (109). Most initial clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking
therapy are conducted in Caucasians or mix races (113). In
recent years, more and more clinical trials of anti-PD-1/PDL1 agents have been conducted in Asian populations (113).
The analysis results of Yang et al. (113) showed that in cancer
patients with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy, the AEs of any
grade with different prevalences between Asian populations and
Western/international populations included fatigue, diarrhea,
nausea, rash, vomiting, and hypothyroidism. Overall, we still
need to develop more sophisticated medical tools in the
future to achieve the best management strategy for irAEs in
cancer patients.
CONCLUSION
The therapy based on PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade
show a better tolerated than traditional standard chemotherapy
in NSCLC patients, but the AEs of these drugs are different from
traditional cytotoxic therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to increase
Frontiers in Oncology | www.frontiersin.org 12 September 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 554313

Su et al. Adverse Effects of Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapy
awareness of these treatment-related toxic reactions for better
management. These adverse reactions involved different tissues
and organs in the human body, causing toxic reactions ranging
from mild fatigue to severe, life-threatening liver and lung
toxicity (115, 116). Compared with traditional chemotherapy,
AEs caused by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment were usually of
low grade, with relatively good patient tolerance and fewer
deaths. However, due to the rapid onset of AEs, so timely
medical care was crucial, especially for the elderly patients, these
toxic reactions should be more carefully monitored to prevent
possible complications.
In conclusion, our review summarizes common and rare
adverse reactions based on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in the
treatment of NSCLC. Overall, adverse reactions caused by
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy were usually low-grade and
most patients were better tolerated. However, there were still
some serious and even life-threatening adverse events related
to treatment. Therefore, healthcare workers should be alert to
the occurrence of such AEs to better monitor and manage these
adverse reactions.
