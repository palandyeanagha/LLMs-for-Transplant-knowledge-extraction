Abstract
Background: One of the national mortality databases in the U.S. is the Beneficiary Identification
and Record Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) Death File that contains death dates of those who have
received any benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The completeness of this
database was shown to vary widely from cohort to cohort in previous studies. Three other sources
of death dates are available in the VA that can complement the BIRLS Death File. The objective of
this study is to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of death dates in the four sources available
in the VA and to examine whether these four sources can be combined into a database with
improved completeness and accuracy.
Methods: A random sample of 3,000 was drawn from 8.3 million veterans who received benefits
from the VA between 1997 and 1999 and were alive on January 1, 1999 according to at least one
source. Death dates found in BIRLS Death File, Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets, Medicare Vital
Status, and Social Security Administration (SSA) Death Master File were compared with dates
obtained from the National Death Index. A combined dataset from these sources was also
compared with National Death Index dates.
Results: Compared with the National Death Index, sensitivity (or the percentage of death dates
correctly recorded in a source) was 77.4% for BIRLS Death File, 12.0% for Medical SAS Inpatient
Datasets, 83.2% for Medicare Vital Status, and 92.1% for SSA Death Master File. Over 95% of death
dates in these sources agreed exactly with dates from the National Death Index. Death dates in
the combined dataset demonstrated 98.3% sensitivity and 97.6% exact agreement with dates from
the National Death Index.
Conclusion: The BIRLS Death File is not an adequate source of mortality data for the VA
population due to incompleteness. When the four sources of mortality data are carefully combined,
the resulting dataset can provide more timely data for death ascertainment than the National Death
Index and has comparable accuracy and completeness.

Background
Accurate data for mortality ascertainment are of critical
importance for epidemiologic and health care outcomes
studies. One of the national mortality databases in the
U.S. is the Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator
Subsystem (BIRLS) Death File that contains death dates of
those who have received any benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) since the early 1970s. This
database has been widely used as the main source of death
dates for veterans who received health care from the VA
[1-5]. The completeness of this database has been shown
to vary widely from cohort to cohort, ranging between
70.0% and 96.5% [6-12] in sensitivity or the percentage of
death dates that are correctly recorded.
Three other databases for mortality ascertainment are
available in the VA that can supplement the BIRLS Death
File. One of them is the VA health care inpatient datasets.
Another is the Social Security Administration (SSA) Death
Master File which the VA acquires from the SSA. A third
source is a subset of the Medicare Vital Status file that contains death dates for all Medicare-enrolled veterans. It is
the newest source of mortality data for veterans which
became available in the VA in 1999.
This study had two main objectives. The first was to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of death dates in these
four sources of mortality data for a sample representative
of the VA population. The second objective was to examine whether these four sources could be combined into a
database with improved accuracy and completeness for
mortality ascertainment.
Methods
Study population
This study was approved by the Human Subjects Committee and the Research and Development Committee at the
Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital in Hines, Illinois. The study
population comprised all veterans who received any benefits from the VA between 1997 and 2002 and were alive
on January 1, 1999 according to at least one source of
mortality data available within the VA. Veterans who were
enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA),
received compensation or pension benefits, or utilized VA
health care were included. After excluding those with no
date of birth (20,049, 0.2%), those with invalid Social
Security Numbers (10,940, 0.1%), and those who were
Medicare beneficiaries but did not have an updated record
in the Medicare Vital Status file (53,943, 0.6%), 8.3 million veterans were in the sampling frame.
Mortality data available in the VA
The BIRLS is a VA database that contains information on
all VA beneficiaries, including veterans discharged from
military service since March 1973, Medal of Honor recipients, veterans who received education benefits from the
VA, and veterans whose survivors applied for burial benefits [11]. This database contains death dates reported by
family members applying for death benefits, VHA hospitals, or the VA National Cemetery Administration. The
BIRLS Death File is a subset of the BIRLS that contains
data on deceased veterans, including death dates.
The VA database called the Medical SAS Inpatient Datasets
(MSID) is another source of death dates for veterans and
contains information on patients who are discharged each
year from any of the VHA hospitals across the county [13].
This database has been compiled each year since 1970 and
includes dates of deaths that occurred in VHA hospitals or
shortly after discharge [11]. It has previously been referred
to as the Patient Treatment Files or PTF [14].
The Medicare Vital Status file is a dataset constructed by
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
and contains demographic and vital status information
for all Medicare beneficiaries. The VA has a data sharing
agreement with the CMS to receive annually all Medicare
data for VA-enrolled veterans [15]. The primary source for
dates of death in the Vital Status file is the Death Master
File compiled by the Social Security Administration (SSA),
but the CMS also updates the Vital Status file with dates of
death from other sources, including Medicare claims data
[16].
The Death Master File is produced by the SSA, contains
over 70 million deaths, and is updated monthly. This file
is populated with death dates which SSA obtains from
death reports by family members, funeral homes, state
and federal agencies, postal authorities and financial institutions. Previous studies reported sensitivity for the SSA
Death Master File ranging between 83% and 95% compared with the National Death Index [9,17-20]. The VA
regularly obtains the SSA Death Master File and its
monthly updates from the SSA, and makes them available
to the researchers.
The data from the fifth source, namely the National Death
Index, are considered the "gold standard" for mortality
ascertainment. The National Death Index was established
in 1981 by the National Center for Health Statistics to be
a central repository of computerized death records for the
entire U.S. population. It contains dates and causes of
death from actual death records filed in state vital statistics
offices since 1979 [21]. Deaths that occurred in a calendar
year are added to the National Death Index annually,
about 12 months after the end of the year. The lag time
between the occurrence and the reporting of a death in the
National Death Index may be anywhere between 12 to 24
months. The data in the National Death Index have been
evaluated against known deaths from sources such as

Population Health Metrics 2006, 4:2 http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/4/1/2

(page number not for citation purposes)
actual death certificates or direct contact with patients or
their families, and have consistently exceeded 95% sensitivity [6,7,22-25]. The National Death Index was used in
this study as the gold standard in evaluating completeness
and accuracy of death dates from the four sources.
National Death Index search
The study sample consisted of 3,000 veterans who were
randomly drawn from the sampling frame. It was submitted to the National Death Index for a death date search in
January, 2005. We provided Social Security Number
(SSN), last name, first name, middle name, date of birth,
date of death, sex, and state of residence.
The National Death Index search often returns multiple
records as possible matches. The National Death Index
uses nine different matching criteria to select possible
matches, some of which do not require a match on Social
Security Number [21]. A set of criteria must be developed
to determine if any of the possible matches are the correct
ones. A "true match" is established when the record
returned from the National Death Index and the submitted record both belong to the same individual according
to chosen criteria. A liberal criterion may increase sensitivity rates of death reporting, but can also increase the
number of false positives and thus decrease specificity
[6,7]. A careful choice of match criteria has important
implications for the comparison [11].
Three match criteria were used to establish "true matches"
in this study. The first criterion matched on SSN, sex, and
two parts of the date of birth (day, month, or year). The
probability that the match according to this criterion was
correct was estimated to be 95% or higher [26]. Two other
match criteria were: at least 7 digits of the SSN, date of
birth, last name, first name, middle initial if provided by
both sources, and sex; and, at least 7 digits of the SSN, date
of death, last name, first name, middle initial if provided
by both sources, and sex. These two criteria were used to
match those cases with SSNs whose two digits were transposed. We established 96.2% of all true matches using the
first criterion and only 3.8% using the other two.
Determining the best death dates by combining mortality 
data sources
We developed an algorithm to determine the best source
of death dates among our study sample. This algorithm
used other stratified samples drawn from the pool of veterans who had death dates recorded in any of the four
sources. These samples included veterans with death dates
(1) that appeared in only one source (4.4% of the study
population with a death date in any of the four sources),
(2) that appeared in more than one source and agreed
(88.1%), and (3) that appeared in more than one source
but did not all agree (7.5%). These samples were submitted to the National Death Index along with the study sample. The results from this process of combining data
sources are detailed elsewhere and are available upon
request [16]. Results for the study sample are described
below.
Statistical analysis
For each source, an individual was placed into one of the
four categories defined in Table 1, depending on how a
veteran's mortality status from the source agreed with that
from the National Death Index. False positives (B) are
"misreported" deaths in the sense that they are not found
in the National Death Index. True negatives (D) are "unreported" deaths; they are not reported in the source but are
in the National Death Index.
Using the number of individuals in each group in Table 1,
four comparison statistics were computed for each source
with the National Death Index data as the gold standard.
Sensitivity indicates the per cent of deaths that were correctly recorded in a source, and was computed as the ratio
of true positives to true positives plus false negatives [A/
(A+C)]. Specificity refers to the per cent of individuals
without a death date in the National Death Index who
were not recorded as deceased in a source. It is the ratio of
true negatives to true negatives plus false positives [D/
(B+D)]. Positive predictive value refers to the probability
that an individual who was identified as deceased in a
source was actually deceased, and is computed as the ratio
of true positives to true positives plus false positives [A/
(A+B)]. Negative predictive value refers to the probability
Table 1: Definitions and Identification Methods of Four Groups for Assessing Completeness and Accuracy of Mortality Data
Groups Definition and Identification Method
A. True Positives All deceased individuals who were identified as deceased in a source. A valid death date was found in both the source 
and the NDI.
B. False Positives All living individuals who were identified as deceased in a source. They have a death date in the source but not in the 
NDI.
C. False Negatives All deceased individuals who were identified as alive in a source. They have a death date in the NDI but not in the 
source.
D. True Negatives All living individuals who were identified as living in a source. They do not have a death date in the NDI nor in the 
source.

that an individual who was identified as not deceased in a
source was actually not deceased, and is computed as the
ratio of true negatives to true negatives plus false negatives
[D/(C+D)].
We then computed sensitivity by VA health care use
groups. Three groups were defined based on any VHA
health care use in 1999–2002: inpatient users, outpatient
users, and non-users. Inpatient and outpatient use groups
are not mutually exclusive. Almost all inpatient users
(99.2%) also used outpatient care during this period. The
sensitivity rates were lower for the users of outpatient care
only, but we chose to report these rates for all outpatient
users to make comparison with previous studies easier
[10,12].
Finally, we computed agreement rates at three different
levels of precision: an exact date match, a match within
two days, and a year and month match. The agreement
rate indicates the proportion of death dates in a source
that match at a given level of precision with dates in the
National Death Index.
We only used the death dates from the National Death
Index that fell between January 1, 1999 and December 31,
2002 to allow for at least 24-month time-lag in death
reporting in the National Death Index.
Results
Of the 3,000 records submitted, the National Death Index
rejected two records due to incomplete demographic data

and returned match results for 2,998 records. Of the veterans with returned possible match records, only 292
(9.7%) could be linked to the sample records as "true
matches" using the three match criteria discussed above.
After deleting two records rejected by the National Death
Index, we had the final sample with 2,998 veterans and
292 deaths confirmed by the National Death Index.
Table 2 describes the study population and the sample
used in this study. The study sample was similar to the
overall population in all measured characteristics.
Table 3 shows comparisons of VA mortality data with
National Death Index data by source. The SSA Death Master File identified the largest number of deaths of all four
sources, followed by the Medicare Vital Status and BIRLS
Death File with 272, 246, and 229 deaths, respectively.
The Inpatient Datasets identified only 35 deaths.
The sensitivity rates were 77.4% for BIRLS Death File,
12.0% for Inpatient Datasets, 83.2% for Medicare Vital
Status, and 92.1% for SSA Death Master File. The low rate
for the BIRLS Death File was mainly due to unreported
(66) rather than misreported (3) deaths. There were 49
and 23 unreported deaths in the Medicare Vital Status and
SSA Death Master File, respectively, and 3 misreported
deaths in both. When the sensitivity was computed only
for Medicare beneficiaries (N = 1,705), the Vital Status file
far exceeded any other single source with 99.2% sensitivity.
The vast majority of the veterans in the sample used VA
outpatient care (70.1%), while only 12.9% used inpatient
care, and 29.8% never used any health care from the VA
(Table 4). The inpatient users had the highest sensitivity
for both BIRLS Death File and SSA Death Master File with
86.3% and 94.5%, respectively. The sensitivity for outpatient users was 80.2% for the BIRLS Death File and 93.0%
for the SSA Death Master File. Compared with either
group of VHA users, non-users showed much worse sensitivity for both data sources: 72.1% for the BIRLS Death
File and 90.4% for the SSA Death Master File. The difference in sensitivities between inpatients and outpatients
was about 6% for the BIRLS Death File and 1.5% for the
SSA Death Master File, while the difference between inpatients and non-users was 14.2% for the BIRLS Death File
and 4.1% for the SSA Death Master File.
In contrast, death dates in these four sources agreed with
those in the National Death Index at extremely high rates
(Table 5). The death dates in the Inpatient Datasets all
agreed exactly with the dates from the National Death

Index. The BIRLS Death File had the second highest agreement (96.9%). Both the Medicare and SSA sources had
slightly lower agreement rates than the BIRLS Death File
with 95.5% and 95.6%, respectively.
There were 292 deaths identified in the combined data,
with five unreported and five misreported deaths. The
sensitivity of the combined data was 98.3%; the specificity, 99.8%; the positive predictive value, 98.3%; and the
negative predictive value, 99.8% (Table 3). For the inpatient and outpatient users, the sensitivities of the combined data were both 100%, indicating that the combined
data are as complete as the National Death Index for the
VHA users. The rates of agreement with the National
Death Index were 97.6%, 98.6%, and 99.7% for exact date
match, match within 2 days, and year and month match,
respectively.
Finally, we counted the number of death dates which each
source contributed to the combined data (Table 6). The
SSA Death Master File contributed the largest number of
deaths (265 deaths, 90.8%), followed by the Medicare
Vital Status with 241 (82.5%), and the BIRLS Death File
with 221 deaths (75.7%). Each source contributed to the
combined data dates that were found uniquely in that
source. The SSA Death Master File contributed the largest
number of unique dates with 13, accounting for about
4.5% of all dates in the combined data. 2.4% of all dates
in the combined data were uniquely contributed by the
BIRLS Death File, followed by the Medicare Vital Status
(1.7%), and the Inpatient Datasets (0.7%).
Discussion
This study shows that the BIRLS Death File was extremely
accurate but not complete. Of all 292 deaths reported in
the National Death Index, 22.6% (66) were not reported
and 1.3% (3) were incorrectly reported in the BIRLS Death
File. These results suggest that if used alone, the BIRLS
Death File is not an adequate source of mortality data for
the overall VA population.
Of all four sources available within the VA, the SSA Death
Master File was the most complete one for the VA population. If a researcher had to choose any one source for mortality ascertainment for veterans, we recommend the SSA
Death Master File. It identified considerably more deaths
with slightly more false positives than the BIRLS Death
File. However, this finding is not consistent with a study
by Page and colleagues [9] who reported lower sensitivity
for the SSA Death Master File than for the BIRLS Death
File. Previous studies found that the SSA Death Master File
had large variability in completeness of death reporting by
age [18,19], and we suspect that differences in age distributions may explain the inconsistency between the two
studies [19].
This study showed the Medicare Vital Status file to be an
important supplemental source of mortality information.
It contained death dates for veterans that were not found
in any other source available in the VA. For Medicareenrolled veterans, this file was the most accurate and complete of all the single sources considered in this study. The
high sensitivity and agreement rates suggest that it can be
used alone as a source of mortality data for Medicareenrolled veterans.
When available sources were combined, the resulting
mortality data proved to be highly comparable to the
National Death Index in both accuracy and completeness.
For the VHA users, the combined data were 100% complete and 97.9% accurate to the date compared with the
National Death Index.
There are some advantages in using the combined data
over the National Death Index. While the four data
sources described above are readily available free of
charge to researchers affiliated with the VA, the National
Death Index requires fees for data search that can be quite
substantial when data for a large number of subjects are
searched. Since both the BIRLS Death File and the SSA
Death Master File are updated monthly, they can be used

to obtain more recent death dates than the National
Death Index.
One limitation of this study is that we examined death
dates for a limited time frame (1999 – 2002), while death
dates in the BIRLS Death File precede the 1970s and those
in the SSA Death Master File precede the 1940s [11]. The
accuracy and completeness of the combined data
observed for this sample may not apply to deaths that
occurred before 1999 and especially to those that occurred
before the mid-1970s, since the completeness of both the
BIRLS Death File and the SSA Death Master File was poor
until mid-1970's [6,19]. These results may also not be
used in studies which follow mortality of veterans using
identifiers other than Social Security Numbers, since the
completeness of mortality data for those with and without
Social Security Numbers are known to be quite different
[6,9].
Conclusion
We found that a combined data set could provide highly
accurate and complete data for mortality ascertainment
and that hardly any improvement in accuracy or completeness could be achieved by acquiring death dates from
the National Death Index. The combined data set can also
provide more timely mortality data than the National
Death Index whose time-lag for death reporting can be up
to 24 months. Given the time- and resource-intensive
nature of combining these four sources, a centralized
database can be greatly beneficial to researchers by providing them with easy access to high-quality mortality
data and thus improving the quality of research involving
veteran mortality ascertainment.
