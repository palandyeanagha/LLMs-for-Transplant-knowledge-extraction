Abstract
A 59-year-old man with poor oral hygiene presented to our hospital because of fever and chills. Abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a liver abscess. The patient had no
history of immunodeficiency and we confirmed the patient had no immunologic abnormalities. Blood culture
revealed Fusobacterium nucleatum, a bacterium commonly found in the oral cavity. Even if a patient is immunocompetent, poor oral hygiene might be an independent risk factor for a pyogenic liver abscess. Professional mechanical tooth cleaning (PMTC) and appropriate self-care are recommended as a prophylaxis
against not only dental, but also systemic diseases.

Introduction
A pyogenic liver abscess is a potentially life-threatening
disease. Epidemiology, management, mortality rate have all
undergone significant changes over the past several decades
(1, 2). Among the intraabdominal processes leading to abscess formation, ruptured appendicitis has been the most
common route for formation of liver abscess. However, biliary tract pathology is now the most common cause of pyogenic liver abscesses, accounting for 43 to 60 percent of
cases (1, 2). Malignant biliary obstruction has become a
more frequent cause in the last several decades. By contrast,
hematogenous seeding is not the usual pathway for development of a liver abscess. We present an immunocompetent
patient with an anaerobic pyogenic liver abscess caused by
Fusobacterium nucleatum, a bacterium commonly found in
the oral cavity.
Case Report
A 59-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to our hospital because of fever and chills. He complained of malaise, but denied any pain, cough, sputum, or
diarrhea. He acknowledged consumption of “sake” (Japanese
alcohol -25% by volume) of 100 ml/day and smoking cigarettes, 1.5 pack/day, for 30 years. He gave no history of diabetes mellitus, surgery, or overseas travel. Physical examination revealed many dental caries with poor oral hygiene, the
remainder of the examination was unremarkable. On admission, the patient’s vital signs were as follows: temperature
38.9℃, blood pressure 119/64 mmHg, heart rate 119 beats/
min, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation
99% in room air. Laboratory results included a white blood
cell count of 12,400/mm3 (normal, 4,500-9,000/mm3
) with
normal differential, a C-reactive protein concentration of 6.9
mg/dl (normal, <0.3 mg/dl), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) of 25 U/L (normal, 15-40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 29 U/L (normal, 15-30 U/L), alkaline phosphatase of 420 U/L (normal, 130-324 U/L), fasting plasma
glucose of 97 mg/dl (normal, 70-109 mg/dl), and hemoglobin A1c of 5.7% (normal, 4.3-5.8%). Chest X-ray and urine
sedimentation tests on admission were unremarkable. Panculture was performed on admission and intravenous infu１Department of Internal Medicine, Kouseikai Uemura Hospital, Kagoshima, ２Kaname Dental Clinic, Kagoshima and ３Department of Cardiovascular, Respiratory and Metabolic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima

sion of imipenem/cilastatin (0.5 g × 2/day) was subsequently initiated. When examining for the cause of the fever,
an abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 1.9×2.7 cm hypoechoic lesion in S8 of the liver without dilatation of biliary tracts. Ascites and cholelithiasis were not detected. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed peripheral enhancement with central hypodense lesions forming small
clusters (Fig. 1A). Diagnosis of a liver abscess was made.
This was thought to be the focus of an infection. Because
the patient refused to have percutaneous drainage of abscess
performed, conservative antibiotic treatment was continued.
During the patient’s hospital stay, we examined for otolaryngeal, cardiac and anorectal lesions. No further significant abnormalities were detected. We also confirmed that the patient had no immunologic abnormalities:autoantibodies,
complements, serum immunoglobulins were all within normal ranges. Serologic tests were negative for hepatitis B, C
virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Serum
anti-amebic antibody was negative. The final report on the
blood culture confirmed colonies of Fusobacterium nucleatum, a bacterium commonly found in the oral cavity. From
day 4 after admission, the fever resolved to within a normal
range. In accord with the results of a drug sensitivity test,
the antibiotic was changed to clindamycin (600 mg×2/day)
(Fig. 2). One month after admission, abdominal ultrasonography and CT no longer detected the liver abscess
(Fig. 1B).
Discussion
In the past, ruptured appendicitis and the subsequent
spread of infection was the most common route for the development of liver abscesses. Currently, an associated disease of the biliary tract is the most often seen etiology (1,
2). However, hematogenous spread of infection is not common, especially that originating from the oral cavity. In the
present case, because the patient refused, we could not perform percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess. Diagnosis
was done based on ultrasonography, CT, and clinical symptoms, and the result was a complete recovery from just antibiotic treatment. Because we did not find the focus of sepsis
on admission, we selected imipenem/cilastatin as an empiric

antibiotic. The results of drug sensitivity test and abdominal
ultarasonography and CT findings facilitated selection of
clindamycin which penetrates liver tissue efficiently. The infection route was thought to be hematogenous spread from
the oral cavity, because the results of blood culture and
physical examinations revealed severe periodontal disease
and dental caries. The reason for abscess formation in the
liver but not in other organs is not clear. Fusobacterium nucleatum originating around a tooth enter the venous return
and are subsequently spread through the arterial circulation.
This would lead to spread through the hepatic artery. We
speculate that in the present case abscess formation was
found in early stage in sepsis. If the beginning of antibiotic
treatments was delayed, abscess formation would spread to
systemic organs.
Fusobacterium nucleatum, an anaerobic Gram-negative
non-sporeforming oral bacterium found in the normal flora
of the mouth, has a role in periodontal disease (3). It produces tissue irritants such as butyric acid, proteases and cytokines. It has strong adhesive properties because of the
presence of lectins, and these outer-membrane proteins mediate adhesion to epithelia and tooth surfaces, and coagglutination with other suspected pathogens (3). Fusobacterium
species are known to be a cause of Lemierre’s syndrome (4)
and aspiration pneumonia. However, an association between
Fusobacterium species and pyogenic liver abscesses has not
been confirmed. Our review of the literature revealed only
12 cases of liver abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum
reported (Table 1) (5-15). In eight, the authors described
whether or not the patient was immunocompetent. Five of
the 8 (63%), patients were immunocompromised hosts with
a history of transplantation, malignancy, long term steroid
use, or HIV infection. Only in 3 cases (37%), was the patient immunocompetent with no history of surgery. Two of
those patients (67%) had dental diseases (9), while the other
had a tonsil infection that was thought to be the entry point
for Fusobacterium nucleatum in the oral cavity (12).
Immunodeficient patients are likely to develop opportunistic or superimposed infection. Liver transplantation, diabetes, and a history of malignancy are risk factors for pyogenic liver abscess (16). However, poor oral hygiene might
also be an independent risk factor of the disease. Usually,
hematogenous spread of bacteria occurs after interventional
treatment of dental disease. The present case had no history
of dental treatment;however, under conditions of very poor
oral hygiene with severe periodontal disease, hematogenous
spread of common oral bacteria may occur. We suggest that
maintenance of adequate oral hygiene, especially professional mechanical tooth cleaning (PMTC) and appropriate
self care (17) are important not only for dental, but also for
systemic diseases.
Although the association of alcohol and amoebic liver abscess has been reported (18), the association between alcohol and pyogenic liver abscess has not been fully clarified.
The present case had a history of alcohol intake, however,
laboratory data and imaging studies did not show chronic
liver injury.
In conclusion, we presented an unusual case of a pyogenic liver abscess due to Fusobacterium nucleatum in an
immunocompetent host. In our review of the literature, most
cases of pyogenic liver abscesses were immunodeficient
states;however, poor oral hygiene appears to be an independent and under-recognized risk factor for this disease.
Appropriate oral care is clearly important not only for dental, but also for systemic diseases.
