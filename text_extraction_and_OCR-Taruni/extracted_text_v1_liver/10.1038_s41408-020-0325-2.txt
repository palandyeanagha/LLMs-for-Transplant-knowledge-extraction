Dear Editor,
Renal dysfunction is a common presenting feature of
AL amyloidosis and one-third of affected patients will
develop end-stage renal failure (ESRF)1
. Consequently, a
sizable proportion of patients will require either renal
replacement therapy (RRT) or renal transplantation.
In AL amyloidosis, achieving a deep haematological
response (HR) to therapy (at least a very good partial
response (VGPR)1 or a 90% reduction in the difference
between free light chains (dFLC)2
) improves renal outcomes and survival. Renal transplantation is associated
with lower mortality, less risk of cardiovascular events and
improved quality of life when compared to RRT3
. In 2010,
we reported a median overall survival (OS) of 6.5 years
and median graft survival of 5.8 years4 in patients with AL
amyloidosis who underwent renal transplantation, whilst
a recent report from the Boston group documented an
impressive 10.5 year OS and 8.3-year graft survival5
,
perhaps reflecting advances in patient selection and
available therapies over the last decade. Appropriate
patient selection is imperative from the perspective of
both fitness to undergo transplantation and depth of HR.
Assessment of HR in patients with ESRF provides a
challenge due to the polyclonal increase in serum-free
light chains (sFLC) that occurs in renal failure6
.
We report here fifty patients with AL amyloidosis who
underwent renal transplantation, identified from the
database of the UK National Amyloidosis Centre, over the
last 15 years. Patients transplanted prior to this were
excluded given the marked changes in treatments and
poorer outcomes in earlier years. Five patients had renal
transplants for reasons unrelated to amyloidosis, 4
patients were lost to follow up and 1 patient had a renal
allograft abroad prior to their first presentation to the
NAC. Forty patients were evaluable for outcomes. The
diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was confirmed by central
review of histological material inclusive of Congo red
staining of the renal biopsy. The amyloid subtype was
subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemistry with
specific antibodies, or by mass spectrometry.
Prior to renal transplantation, haematological responses
were defined as per the previous literature7
. In the setting
of ESRF, raised levels of free kappa and lambda light
chains may reflect slowed renal light chain clearance and
not the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy8 thus a
seemingly abnormal ratio using the standard reference
range (0.26–1.65 mg/L) may be seen in patients with a
fully suppressed plasma cell clone. A wider “normal”
range for sFLC has been suggested for use in renal failure
(0.37–3.1 mg/L)8,9 to better account for this polyclonal
sFLC increase. Responses were also assessed using this
wider renal sFLC range to define complete response (CR).
In the post-transplant setting, HR was assessed as per
international consensus criteria10. Organ involvement was
determined as per consensus guidelines11. Given that LV
mass increases and is prognostic in uraemic cardiomyopathy12, LV wall thickness of <12 mm, ≥12 mm or
≥13 mm were assessed. Due to the selected patient
population, the numbers of patients with an LV wall
thickness above 14 mm were too small for meaningful
analysis.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from
renal transplantation to haematological progression or

death whilst OS was calculated from the date of renal
transplantation to death from any cause. Renal graft
survival was calculated as time from renal transplantation
to recurrence of ESRF (death without graft failure was
censored).
Patient characteristics are summarised in Supplementary Table 1. At presentation, 12 (30%) patients were on
RRT. A further 24 (60%) progressed to ESRF and required
RRT prior to renal transplantation whilst 4 (10%) were
transplanted pre-emptively. Median time from diagnosis
to ESRF was 15 months (0–115 months) and from RRT to
renal allograft was 28 months (3–83 months). Twenty
patients (50%) received cadaveric transplants whilst the
remainder had a live donor.
Haematological responses at the time of renal transplantation and on re-assessment immediately posttransplant were: CR—24 (60.0%)/27 (67.5%), VGPR—6
(15.0%)/8 (20.0%), partial response (PR)—6 (15.0%)/2
(5.0%) and no response (NR)—3 (7.5%)/1 (2.5%), respectively. No patient received chemotherapy between the
pre- and post-renal transplantation sFLC measurements.
Prior to renal transplantation, one patient was excluded as
their light chains were not evaluable whilst post-transplantation, one patient died after renal transplantation
before these readings were taken. Based on post-renal
transplant sFLC measurements, 7 patients (17.5%) had
their HR re-classified, of which 6/7 (85.7%) were assigned
an improved response category including two patients
who had been classed as non-responders pre-transplantation. When the wider “renal” sFLC normal range9 was
applied to pre-transplant response assessment, there was
no change in the assigned depth of response following
renal transplantation. Outcomes were studied using dFLC
value (<10 mg/L), percentage reduction (>90%) and
involved free light chain (iFLC) absolute reduction
(<20 mg/L). There were no significant differences between
responders and non-responders using pre-transplantation
sFLC results. Using post-transplant clonal markers, OS
was significantly better in patients with a deeper response
assessed either as standard CR or dFLC <10 mg/L, iFLC
<20 mg/L or dFLC reduction of >90% compared to standard VGPR or less or a lesser depth of d/iFLC response,
respectively (Table 1).
The median follow up from renal transplantation was
8.9 years (2.2–19.3 years). During the period of follow up,
13 (32.5%) patients died. One patient died within a few
days of renal transplantation due to a post-operative
hypotensive event and was known to have Mayo Stage 3
cardiac amyloidosis. Of the remaining deaths, 5 patients
died in relapse, 5 died whilst in haematological remission
and 2 are unknown. From renal transplantation, haematological PFS was 6.9 years (95% CI 5.1–8.7 years) and
median OS was 9.0 years (95% CI 5.5–10.1 years). Patients
who achieved a CR, based on pre-transplant sFLCs,
achieved a markedly higher PFS (8.5 years; 95% CI
5.7–11.4 years) (p = 0.024) and OS (10.3 years; 95% CI
6.1–11.9 years) (p = 0.015) (Fig. 1). In contrast, patients
achieving a pre-transplant VGPR, did not have significantly different PFS (p = 0.293) or OS (p = 0.106)
compared with those patients who were given a renal
transplant in a lesser HR (PR/NR).
Prior autologous stem cell transplantation, number of
prior lines of therapy and source of renal transplant (live
vs. cadaveric) did not impact survival. Cardiac outcomes
were assessed using the usual amyloid definition (mLV
wall >12 mm) or a higher renal threshold (mLV wall
13 mm) given that increased LV wall thickness is both
common and prognostic in end-stage renal failure12. All
patients with thicker LV walls (>12 or >13 mm) had a
higher hazard ratio for poorer outcomes but it was

significantly worse for those with an LV wall >13 mm
(median OS 9.7 years [7.8–11.7 years] vs. 3.6 years
[0.7–6.6 years] for LV wall > or <13 mm respectively (p =
0.01; HR 9.60 [2.08–44.23]). This highlights the importance of patient selection and pre-transplant cardiac status. It is unclear whether this survival difference reflects a
higher cardiac amyloid burden, uraemic cardiomyopathy
or a combination. The only peri-operative death occurred
in a patient with Mayo stage 3 cardiac amyloidosis who
had achieved a good haematological and cardiac response.
Following this patient, our centre routinely undertakes
functional stress cardiac testing in all patients with
abnormal baseline echocardiograms being considered for
renal transplant.
On an intention-to-treat basis, median graft survival
was 12.4 years (95% CI 10.7–14.2 years). There were 2
acute graft failures within 4 weeks of implantation. On
long term follow up, only one patient lost their graft and
required initiation of RRT. Three patients had proven
amyloid recurrence in the renal graft on repeat biopsy
without graft loss. A further 2 patients had evidence of
amyloid recurrence on 123I-labelled serum amyloid P
component (SAP) scintigraphy without recurrence of
proteinuria or deterioration in renal function. Nine
(22.5%) patients required further chemotherapy for AL
amyloidosis due to post-transplant haematological
relapse, or a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
in one case, of which one patient (11.1%) had evidence of
increasing proteinuria. The remainder had evidence of
haematological relapse only without organ progression.
There was no difference in graft survival (p = 0.350) or OS
(p = 0.788) in patients who received chemotherapy following graft implantation.
In summary, the literature on renal transplant outcomes
in AL amyloidosis is relatively sparse. Whilst this study is
limited by its retrospective nature and relatively small
patient numbers, we demonstrate excellent long term
patient survival with renal transplantation and that renal
graft failure secondary to AL amyloidosis is uncommon.
Patient survival is dictated by HR and LV wall thickness as
opposed to graft failure; highlighting the importance of
careful assessment of both (HR and LV wall thickness)
when determining whether a patient is suitable for renal
transplantation. Use of the renal FLC threshold to assess
HR prior to transplantation shows promise but requires
further validation. Whilst FLC levels are important, a
more comprehensive clonal disease assessment including
serum/urine electrophoresis and immunofixation as well
as a bone marrow biopsy may be needed. Novel mass
spectrometric methods of identifying the monoclonal
component of the sFLC are likely to provide a solution but
are not yet routinely available13. Renal transplantation
should be considered more often in patients with AL
amyloidosis predominant renal involvement in ESRF.
