The blood–brain barrier (BBB) restricts free access of molecules between the blood and the brain and is essential
for regulating the neural microenvironment. Here, we
describe how the BBB was initially characterized and
how the current field evaluates barrier properties. We
next detail the cellular nature of the BBB and discuss
both the conservation and variation of BBB function
across taxa. Finally, we examine our current understanding of mouse and zebrafish model systems, as we expect
that comparison of the BBB across organisms will provide
insight into the human BBB under normal physiological
conditions and in neurological diseases.
History of the BBB
Concept of a barrier
The existence of a functional blood–brain barrier (BBB)
was initially characterized in the late 19th and early
20th centuries by a number of studies that used vital
dyes and central nervous system (CNS)-impermeable
compounds as tracers to assess brain blood vessel permeability. First, Ehrlich (1885) injected alizarin blue subcutaneously or intravenously in adult rats and noted that
while the blue tracer was generally detected in tissues
throughout the body, it was always excluded from the
CNS. Although Ehrlich (1885) was the first to describe
the phenomenon of CNS tracer exclusion, the term
“blood–brain barrier” was coined several decades later,
following the work of Lewandowsky (1900), Goldmann
(1909, 1913), and Stern and Gautier (1918, 1921). Lewandowsky (1900) showed that the poisons strychnine and
sodium ferrocyanide had higher lethal doses when injected subcutaneously or intravenously than when injected
intrathecally into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in dogs,
cats, rabbits, and sheep. These observations led him to
speculate that the brain vasculature limits the poisons’ access to the brain and thus toxicity when administered peripherally (Lewandowsky 1900). Goldmann (1909, 1913)
showed that trypan blue tracer was excluded from rodent
and rabbit brains when injected into the periphery (Goldmann 1909) but not when injected intrathecally (Goldmann 1913), providing further evidence for the existence
of a barrier between the brain and the blood. Finally, Stern
and Gautier (1918, 1921) performed studies in dogs, cats,
rabbits, and guinea pigs. They studied a number of compounds that could be detected after intravenous injection,
including antibodies and tracer dyes (e.g., India ink and eosin) or chemicals with known effect on the nervous system (e.g., morphine and curare). They tracked the
passage of these compounds from the blood into the brain
by measuring the concentration of each compound in
both blood and CSF after injection and found that while
some compounds were present in both the blood and the
CSF (such as morphine), others (such as India ink) were
only detected in the blood and not in the CSF (Stern and
Gautier 1918, 1921). Based on their findings, the investigators concluded that a barrier existed that separated the
blood from the brain. Stern and Gautier (1918, 1921)
were the first to use the term “barrier” to describe this observation (Stern and Gautier 1918) and later aptly proposed that this barrier be called the “blood–brain
barrier” (Stern and Gautier 1921).
Cellular nature of the barrier
Several decades later, the advent of electron microscopy
(EM) permitted the identification of the cell type responsible for the vertebrate BBB. Initial studies speculated that
astrocytes, a CNS-specific glial cell type in direct contact
with brain blood vessels, were the effective site of the BBB
(Gray 1961). Indeed, some organisms, such as the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster, have a glial barrier between the
neuropil and the circulatory system (Limmer et al. 2014).
However, Reese and Karnovsky (1967) found that the integrity of the mammalian BBB was attributable to key
characteristics of CNS capillary endothelial cells. By injecting the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into

the circulation of mice, they observed the confinement of
HRP within the blood vessel lumina in the brain, as evidenced by the appearance of an electron-dense product
of the peroxidase after incubation with the substrate
3,3′
-diaminobenzidine (DAB). These results were in accordance with earlier tracer studies such as those described
above. However, by using EM to examine the subcellular
localization of the electron-dense HRP reaction product,
they found that the passage of HRP from the circulation
into the neuropil was restricted at tight junction “kissing
points,” which are regions where two outer leaflets of adjacent endothelial cell membranes are closely apposed. In
contrast, HRP had been observed to pass through some endothelial cell tight junctions in the periphery (Karnovsky
1967). They also noted that there were negligible levels of
pinocytotic vesicles within brain endothelial cells (Reese
and Karnovsky 1967). Thus, Reese and Karnovsky (1967)
attributed barrier function to the presence of specialized
tight junctions in CNS endothelial cells. Evidence for an
endothelial cell barrier was further bolstered by the experiments of Brightman and Reese (1969). By perfusing HRP
in mouse brain ventricles, introducing HRP directly into
the brain parenchyma, they revealed that HRP went beyond the astrocytic end feet but was halted by the tight
junctions of brain endothelial cells at the abluminal
side, further demonstrating that astrocytic end feet do
not contribute physically to the barrier (Brightman and
Reese 1969).
Role of the CNS environment in BBB development
Transplantation experiments performed during avian embryogenesis have shown that the neural environment provides critical barrier-inducing signals. To address whether
barrier properties were innate to CNS endothelial cells or
induced by external cues, Stewart and Wiley (1981a) transplanted nonvascularized quail brain tissue into the gut
and nonvascularized quail somite tissue into the brains
of 3-d chick embryos. They examined endothelial cell barrier properties 15 d later, after the grafted tissue was vascularized by the surrounding blood vessels. Importantly,
after 15 d, the transplanted brain tissue developed into
mature neurons and glia, and the transplanted somites developed into a separate mesodermal mass containing cartilage, bone, feathers, and striated muscle. Injection of
trypan blue revealed that the transplanted brain tissue
in the gut contained blood vessels that restricted trypan
blue to the vascular lumina, suggesting that functional
barrier properties had been acquired, while the blood vessels penetrating nearby gut tissue readily leaked the trypan blue into the surrounding tissue. Conversely, the
vessels in the brain-transplanted somitic graft readily
leaked trypan blue, while the surrounding brain vasculature restricted the tracer within the blood vessels (Stewart
and Wiley 1981a). Furthermore, when Stewart and Wiley
(1981a) used EM to analyze the morphology of the cells
in the brain grafts transplanted into the gut, they noted
low levels of pinocytotic vesicles in the endothelial cells
that vascularized the grafts. In contrast, endothelial cells
of the somitic transplants in the brain contained numerous pinocytotic vesicles, an observation more characteristic of endothelial cells in peripheral tissues (Stewart and
Wiley 1981a). Thus, this work demonstrated that barrier
properties are not intrinsic to the endothelial cells but
rather are acquired from the neural microenvironment.
The brain microenvironment, which directly interacts
with CNS endothelial cells, is comprised of neurons; mural cells, which include pericytes and vascular smooth
muscle cells; and glial cells, such as astrocytes. All cell
types in close proximity with neurons and the CNS vasculature are collectively referred to as the neurovascular
unit (NVU), and the interactions between NVU cells influence barrier properties (Iadecola 2017; Kisler et al.
2017a).
Evolutionary conservation of the function of the BBB
Defining BBB permeability
To determine whether an organism has a functional BBB,
tracer leakage assays similar to those initially done as described above are the standard method to ascertain barrier
properties. Briefly, a tracer is injected into the circulation
of an organism, and leakage can be detected by analysis of
brain tissue. A functional BBB restricts the tracer to the
CNS blood vessels, excluding it from the brain parenchyma. However, if the barrier is not fully functional, the injected tracer will leak out of the blood vessels into the
brain parenchyma.
The embryonic acquisition of BBB properties was determined by tracer leakage assays, as immature brain endothelial cells allow tracers to pass into the neuropil,
while brain endothelial cells with barrier properties restrict tracers to the CNS vasculature (Saunders et al.
2012). In embryonic mouse brains, the spatio–temporal
development of a functional BBB occurs gradually in a caudal-to-rostral, ventral-to-dorsal pattern, and, by embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), the BBB is fully functional in the cortex
(Ben-Zvi et al. 2014). Studies in rats show that the BBB also
forms embryonically, with the tracer being confined within most of the brain vasculature at E15 (Daneman et al.
2010b). A similar spatio–temporal developmental pattern
has also been observed in the blood–retinal barrier (BRB),
which is a barrier physiologically analogous to the BBB.
The primary plexus of the mouse retina becomes vascularized at the optic nerve head beginning at postnatal
day 1, and the BRB gradually forms in a proximal-to-distal
fashion, with the BRB becoming fully functional throughout the retina at postnatal day 10 (Chow and Gu 2017). Beyond rodents, the development of the zebrafish BBB forms
between 3 and 10 d post-fertilization (dpf) (Jeong et al.
2008; Tam et al. 2012; Fleming et al. 2013); however, the
precise spatio–temporal profile for the development of
the functional BBB in zebrafish has yet to be clearly
elucidated.
There are several types of tracer leakage assays that are
used to evaluate functional BBB properties.
Exogenous chemical tracers Fluorescently conjugated
tracers are preferable tracers because they are nonreactive

with serum proteins and are retained within the BBB vasculature under normal physiological conditions. Lysinefixable fluorescently conjugated dextrans are available in
a wide range of molecular weights (from 3 kDa up to
2000 kDa), permitting the assessment of leakage of both
small and large tracers after perturbation of the BBB. In addition to dextrans, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is∼66 kDa
and can also be used as an exogenous tracer when fluorescently conjugated. Furthermore, the small molecules Nhydroxysulfosuccinimide (NHS) biotin and biocytin are
also suitable as tracers, as they are also normally retained
within the BBB vasculature. NHS-biotin is an effective
tracer because it is both small at 443 kDa and reactive
with amines. Previous work has demonstrated that deletion of the tight junction proteins Claudin-5 or Lsr leads
to increased BBB permeability specifically for small-molecular-weight substances, such as NHS-biotin (Nitta
et al. 2003; Sohet et al. 2015). Fluorescently labeled biocytin has a slightly higher molecular weight: between ∼800
and 1200 Da. Vital dyes such as Evans blue are less preferable for use as tracers due to their potential to bind directly
to tissues, lack of specific albumin binding, and in vivo toxicity (Saunders et al. 2015). The use of tracers in a range of
sizes is important when evaluating BBB permeability to
characterize leakage phenotypes. Use of these wide-ranging tracers has been instrumental in not only determining
the effects of genetic perturbations on barrier function
(Armulik et al. 2010; Bell et al. 2010; Daneman et al.
2010b; Wang et al. 2012; Siegenthaler et al. 2013; BenZvi et al. 2014; Sohet et al. 2015; Winkler et al. 2015;
Andreone et al. 2017; Cho et al. 2017; Chow and Gu
2017; Mazzoni et al. 2017) but also demarcating differences between disease pathophysiologies in murine models of
Alzheimer’s disease (Montagne et al. 2017) and stroke
(Knowland et al. 2014).
Endogenous tracers BBB permeability has also been assessed without exogenous tracer injections by using immunofluorescence staining against endogenous serum
proteins, which should normally be retained within the
BBB vasculature, or studying transgenic animals with
fluorescently tagged serum proteins. For example, immunostaining of endogenous plasma proteins such as IgG,
ApoB, and fibrinogen has been used to measure barrier
permeability in both mouse and human tissues (Adams
et al. 2007; Bell et al. 2010; Alvarez et al. 2011; Argaw
et al. 2012; Winkler et al. 2015). When immunofluorescence for IgG or fibrinogen is used in conjunction with injected dextran tracers, the observed leakage phenotypes
between dextrans and serum proteins are similar (Bell
et al. 2010; Alvarez et al. 2011), further suggesting that
both methods reliably reveal aberrant BBB permeability.
In addition to in situ assessment of endogenous leakage,
Western blots performed with the same serum antibodies
have been used to measure whole-brain levels of IgG and
fibrinogen in capillary-depleted brain homogenates (Bell
et al. 2010; Winkler et al. 2015). While obscuring localization information, this method provides a quantitative measure for detecting overall amounts of endogenous leakage
within the brain. In zebrafish, a transgenic line with a fluorescently labeled vitamin D-binding protein (∼78 kDa),
which is similar to the mammalian serum albumin, allows
for in vivo live imaging of barrier functionality throughout
development (Xie et al. 2010). Development of a mouse
strain that expresses a fluorescently labeled serum protein
could also facilitate in vivo examination of endogenous
leakage in the mammalian BBB in the future.
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) Recent advances in
the field of MSI now allow the identification of heme
and pharmacological compounds outside of the blood vessels in mouse brains without the addition of fluorescent
tracers, providing both localization and quantification of
the concentration of the analyzed target (Liu et al. 2013;
Parrish et al. 2015). With further advances in the technique, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
spectrometry imaging (MALDI)-MSI promises to reveal
low levels of leakage in even smaller sample areas, which
may make it a more approachable tool for analyzing BBB
mutant mice with subtle BBB phenotypes in the future.
HRP with EM EM analysis in conjunction with intravenous injection of the tracer HRP, which, with DAB, generates an electron-dense reaction product (the method that
was originally used to demonstrate the presence of a vertebrate endothelial barrier) (Reese and Karnovsky 1967),
remains the gold standard to reveal the subcellular mechanisms that lead to BBB dysfunction. Importantly, the
presence of tight junction proteins alone is insufficient
to determine whether intercellular junctions retain specialized BBB properties because peripheral endothelial
cells also have tight junctions and express the same tight
junction proteins. The function of specialized tight junctions can be assessed using small tracers or using EM
with HRP, which can determine whether the HRP tracer
is halted at the tight junctions between endothelial cells.
This method can also detect aberrant vesicular trafficking, such as the presence of HRP-filled vesicles, which indicates increased transcytosis (Daneman et al. 2010b; BenZvi et al. 2014; Reyahi et al. 2015; Andreone et al. 2017;
Chow and Gu 2017).
Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) As many of the tracer leakage assays described above cannot be performed in humans, MRI is
used to evaluate BBB permeability dynamics and leakage
patterns in disease. The use of gadolinium together with
MRI (DCE-MRI) enhances contrast and enables the measurement of regional vascular permeability dynamics at
the BBB (Sweeney et al. 2018). Studies performed in
mice have demonstrated that observations of leakage
with MRI using gadolinium reflect leakage patterns observed after injection with exogenous tracers (Nitta
et al. 2003; Navarathna et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014). DCEMRI has been used to show that BBB leakage is a characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases in humans,
including multiple sclerosis (Taheri et al. 2010; Gaitán
et al. 2011; Ingrisch et al. 2012; Cramer et al. 2015; Montagne et al. 2015) and Alzheimer’s disease (Montagne et al.
2015; van de Haar et al. 2016a, b).

Endothelial barriers are conserved across vertebrates
Combinations of these tracer injections and EM analyses
have been used to study functional barriers in a variety of
organisms, ranging from invertebrates to humans. While
the function of the barrier is conserved from organisms
such as flies (Limmer et al. 2014) and cartilaginous fish
(Bundgaard and Abbott 2008), the cellular nature of the
barrier and the NVU required for establishing the barrier
varies across taxa.
The fruit fly D. melanogaster has an open circulatory
system, unlike the closed circulatory system observed
in vertebrates; however, the fly brain is separated from
the blood-like hemolymph by the so-called “hemolymph–brain barrier” (Fig. 1A; Juang and Carlson 1992;
Bainton et al. 2005; Schwabe et al. 2005). This functional
barrier is formed by the subperineurial glial cells (SPGs)
(Schwabe et al. 2005; Limmer et al. 2014). These glial cells
undergo polyploidization during larval stages, greatly increasing their cell area to seal the brain as it develops
(Unhavaithaya and Orr-Weaver 2012). SPGs express nutrient transporters and have specialized septate junctions,
similar to the expression pattern of nutrient transporters
and specialized tight junction complexes in vertebrate
BBB endothelial cells (Limmer et al. 2014; Hindle et al.
2017). Interaction with other glial cell types, including
perineurial glial cells, has also been shown to be important in regulating size selectivity of the hemolymph–
brain barrier through fenestrations (cellular pores) (Stork
et al. 2008). Together, these glial cells regulate and restrict access of the hemolymph into the invertebrate
CNS.
Vertebrate brains can grossly be divided into two subtypes based on neuronal complexity. Type 1 brains exhibit
minimal neuronal migration away from the ventricular
surface and a relatively simple neuronal cytoarchitecture
(Butler 2009). Taxa that are classified as type 1 include
lampreys, several cartilaginous fish (such as sharks [Fig.
1B] and chimaeras), nonteleost ray-finned fish, lungfish,
and amphibians. Type 2 brains, on the other hand, not
only have increased their total neuronal abundance and
complexity but also display stereotypic neuronal migration away from the ventricular surface during development. Taxa with type 2 brains include hagfish, teleost
ray-finned fish, and amniotes (mammals, reptiles, and
birds) (Butler 2009). Interestingly, among the type 1
brains, there are two types of barriers between the blood
and the brain: endothelial and glial. While the vast majority of these species has an endothelial barrier similar to
that observed in all type 2 brains, the elasmobranchii
(sharks, skates, and rays) and sturgeon brains are protected
by a glial barrier similar to the more primitive hemolymph–brain barrier observed in the invertebrate fly D.
melanogaster (Bundgaard and Cserr 1981; Bundgaard
and Abbott 2008). EM analyses following HRP injection
have been performed in species spanning several different
taxa, and it appears that the endothelial barrier has
evolved several times throughout evolution (Bundgaard
and Abbott 2008). The BBB has remained in other vertebrates, likely due to strong selection for diversification

(D) The site of the mouse BBB is also the capillary endothelial cells (green) that vascularize the brain. As in zebrafish, these cells are connected by specialized tight junctions (orange). BBB
endothelial cells together with brain pericytes (purple) and the end feet of astrocytes (blue) comprise the NVU. (E) As in zebrafish and
mice, the site of the BBB in humans is also the capillary endothelial cells (green), which are connected by specialized tight junctions
(orange). The human NVU also includes pericytes (purple) and astrocytic end feet (blue), which are more prevalent in human brains
than in mouse brains.

of brain cell types and functions and thus for more complex neuronal tasks (Abbott 2005).
EM studies have revealed that the endothelial barrier
exists in a number of species, including newts (Bodenheimer and Brightman 1968), zebrafish (Fig. 1C; Fleming
et al. 2013), chickens and quails (Stewart and Wiley
1981b), opossums (Ek et al. 2006), wallabies (Dziegielewska et al. 1988), mice (Fig. 1D; Reese and Karnovsky
1967), rats (Olsson et al. 1968), rabbits (Sedlakova et al.
1999), cats (Waldron and Bryan 1975; Ellison et al. 1987),
dogs (Vick and Bigner 1972), and humans (Fig. 1E; Long
1970; Stewart et al. 1987). Of these, mice are the most
commonly used BBB model system (Fig. 1D). However,
zebrafish (Fig. 1C) are also emerging as a powerful system
to study the barrier. Study of both mouse and zebrafish
systems provides a complementary approach to uncover
the molecular and cellular regulators of barrier properties.
Comparing the role of BBB cellular constituents
in zebrafish and mice
Endothelial cells
As detailed above, both zebrafish and mice have an endothelial BBB. Throughout the body, the endothelium serves
as a site of transfer for substances between tissues and
the blood stream.Thus, endothelial cell properties in different tissues reflect differences in exchange properties
(Augustin and Koh 2017; Potente and Mäkinen 2017). For
example, in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, the endothelium is discontinuous, allowing substances to freely
pass between the tissue and the blood through gaps between endothelial cells. In the kidneys and endocrine
glands, endothelial cells are fenestrated, allowing passage
of specific substances through large pores in endothelial
cells (Drummond et al. 1998; Satchell and Braet 2009).
In most vessels in the body, such as those in the lungs
(Schneeberger-Keeley and Karnovsky 1968), endothelial
cells are continuous, meaning the cells are attached to one
another by cell–cell junctions. Substances pass through
continuous endothelium cell–cell junction complexes
or via vesicular trafficking across the cell membrane.
Brain endothelial cells are an especially restrictive form
of continuous endothelium. They have specialized tight
junction complexes that prevent paracellular passage of
water-soluble molecules (Nag et al. 2011; Daneman
2012; Andreone et al. 2015). They also express selective
transporters to provide nutrients to the brain (CamposBedolla et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2015). Additionally, CNS
endothelial cells express low levels of leukocyte adhesion
molecules when compared with peripheral endothelial
cells and thus help prevent immune cell entry into the
brain (Rössler et al. 1992). Finally, CNS endothelial cells
exhibit unusually low levels of vesicular transport (transcytosis), as described above (Reese and Karnovsky 1967).
Increased levels of vesicles and BBB leakage have been observed under pathologic conditions, such as ischemia
(Lossinsky and Shivers 2004), as well as in mice with decreased pericyte coverage (Armulik et al. 2010; Bell et al.
2010; Daneman et al. 2010b). Recently, work demonstrated that transcytosis is actively inhibited in CNS endothelial cells. Specifically, Mfsd2a, a multitransmembrane
lipid transporter (Nguyen et al. 2014), functions as a transcytosis inhibitor to regulate the BBB. Mice lacking Mfsd2a
have a leaky BBB and BRB, resulting from up-regulation of
transcytosis without apparent disruption of tight junctions (Ben-Zvi et al. 2014; Chow and Gu 2017). Recent
work has established the mechanism of action of Mfsd2a:
Lipids translocated by Mfsd2a establish a unique lipid
composition in the CNS endothelial cell plasma membrane that inhibits formation of caveolae (Andreone
et al. 2017), which are small “flask-shaped” plasma membrane invaginations (Palade 1953; Yamada 1955). Moreover, the suppression of transcytosis is also important
for the establishment of a functional barrier during development. In the developing retina, blood vessels are leaky
when they first enter the retina, and endothelial cells display a relatively high rate of bulk transcytosis (Chow and
Gu 2017). However, the specialized tight junctions are already functional as soon as blood vessels enter the retina.
An impermeable barrier is established later only after
transcytosis is gradually suppressed in the endothelial
cells. Therefore, the time course of transcytosis regulation
governs the development of an impermeable functional
BRB (Chow and Gu 2017).
Expression of several molecules is conserved between
mouse and zebrafish CNS endothelial cells. Briefly,
mouse CNS endothelial cells express both general endothelial genes, such as Pecam1, Kdr (Vegfr2), Cldn5, and
Tjp1 (ZO-1), and unique or highly enriched genes, such
as Slc2a1 (Glut1), Abcb1 (Pgp), Mfsd2a, and Lsr (Daneman
et al. 2010a; Ben-Zvi et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014). In
zebrafish, general endothelial cell markers are also expressed, including the tight junction molecules ZO-1
and Cldn5 (Jeong et al. 2008). Additionally, CNS-enriched
genes such as the glucose transporter Glut1 (Umans et al.
2017) and the efflux pump Pgp (Fleming et al. 2013) are
also expressed in zebrafish brain endothelial cells. Taken
together, the expression of similar molecular BBB regulators in both zebrafish and mice suggests that the brain
endothelium in zebrafish plays a role analogous to that
of the mouse brain endothelium at the BBB. For a more
detailed description of currently known key molecules
for BBB function in mouse endothelial cells, see Chow
and Gu (2015).
Pericytes
Pericytes are a subset of mural cells that are in close contact with capillary endothelial cells throughout the body
(Armulik et al. 2011). In the mammalian brain, pericytes
contact endothelial cells and astrocytic end feet through
the basal lamina, forming an integral part of the NVU
(Fig. 2; Hawkins 2005; Stanimirovic and Friedman 2012;
Najjar et al. 2013). The function and characteristics of
pericytes at the BBB in mice have been reviewed extensively (Armulik et al. 2011; Winkler et al. 2011; Sweeney
et al. 2016; Trost et al. 2016).
Briefly, these vascular support cells are present at the
time of embryonic brain vascularization in rodents and
O’Brown et al.

have been shown to be essential for the formation of the
BBB (Daneman et al. 2010b). The requirement of pericytes
during BBB formation was demonstrated using several
mouse models with genetic alterations that disrupt the
interaction of pericytes and brain endothelial cells—socalled “pericyte-deficient” mice. Studies with pericytedeficient mice also revealed that the degree of pericyte
coverage along the brain vasculature negatively correlates
with barrier permeability (Armulik et al. 2010; Bell et al.
2010; Daneman et al. 2010b). Further investigation of
adult Pdgfbret/ret pericyte-deficient mice revealed regional heterogeneity in barrier permeability, finding higher
levels of permeability in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus than in the interbrain and midbrain despite similar levels of pericyte coverage (Villaseñor et al. 2016).
Additional analysis with Pdgrfb+/− mice showed defects
in neurovascular coupling during adulthood (Kisler et al.
2017b). However, a recent study in the mouse retina
demonstrated that while pericytes are also necessary for
the development of the BRB, loss of pericytes after the
formation of the BRB during adulthood has no effect on
retinal barrier properties (Park et al. 2017). Similarly,
when the investigators analyzed Evans blue leakage in
the gross adult brain after acute loss of pericytes, they
did not observe increased tracer leakage into the brain,
suggesting that pericytes are not necessary for the maintenance of barrier properties during adulthood (Park et al.
2017).
Recent work suggests that the differentiation state of
pericytes may influence their effect on BBB permeability.
One study performed in mice deficient for the transcription factor Foxf2, a neural crest-derived mural cell marker,
found that Foxf2−/− pericytes had defective differentiation
patterns and observed increased pericyte coverage and BBB
leakage in both the embryonic brain in germline null animals and the adult brain in conditional null animals (Reyahi et al. 2015). Another recent study in mice found that
pericytes are present at the leaky angiogenic front before
retinal endothelial cells acquire the BRB, further suggesting that the differentiation state of pericytes is important
to promote the acquisition of barrier properties in retinal
endothelial cells (Chow and Gu 2017). Finally, recent studies have sought to determine the role of pericytes in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases (Bell et al. 2010,
2012; Kisler et al. 2017a), finding that pericyte dysfunction
typically precedes neurodegeneration in mouse models.
Given that some studies suggest that pericyte loss during
adulthood is not critical for maintaining barrier properties,
further work is needed to clearly evaluate the role of
pericytes in the adult BBB, specifically how pericyte differentiation state affects brain endothelial cell barrier properties and whether pericytes are critical for maintaining
barrier properties during adulthood.
The close physical interaction between brain pericytes
and endothelial cells is not unique to mammals, as zebrafish endothelial cells are also in close contact with pericytes throughout BBB formation. The first CNS Pdgfrb+
pericytes appear on the hindbrain channels ∼60 h post-fertilization (hpf) (Wang et al. 2013; Ando et al. 2016). Interestingly, at this age, some pericytes are associated with
the angiogenic sprouting front of capillaries penetrating
the brain (Wang et al. 2013) even though the barrier is
not fully functional, similar to observations in the mammalian retina described above (Chow and Gu 2017). Live
imaging in developing zebrafish embryos enables imaging
of the brain in toto, a key advantage to using zebrafish for
the study of barrier development. Such studies have revealed that pericytes stop migrating and proliferating at
5 dpf, after covering the entire cranial vasculature (Ando
et al. 2016). While these Pdgfrb+ pericytes also express
Notch3, they do not express other canonical mammalian
pericyte markers (e.g., Rgs5a, Desmin a/b, or Cspg4)
(Wang et al. 2013), suggesting that there are some molecular differences between mammalian and zebrafish pericytes. Interestingly, using a combination of morpholino
gene knockdown and lineage tracing experiments, it has
been determined that these zebrafish cranial pericytes
are of mixed developmental origin from both the neural
crest and mesenchyme (Ando et al. 2016), while, in the
mammalian system, these cells are only of neural crest
origin (Bergwerff et al. 1998; Etchevers et al. 2001; Korn
et al. 2002; Wilm et al. 2005; Que et al. 2008; Asahina
et al. 2011; Yamanishi et al. 2012). Thus, while zebrafish
pericytes share several features with mouse pericytes,
the precise role of pericytes in the zebrafish BBB is not currently known.
Figure 2. Expanded view of the NVU. While the canonical view
of the NVU includes neurons (black), endothelial cells (green),
pericytes (purple), and astrocytes (blue), recent evidence suggests
that this view may be too limited. Recent work has identified a
role for fluorescent granular perithelial cells (FGPs; lime green)
in regulating arteriole permeability, marked here by the presence
of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs; pink). At the capillary
level, there may also be an underappreciated role for cells such
as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs; orange) and microglia
(yellow) in regulating the BBB, given their proximity to brain
capillaries.

Astrocytes
Due to their proximity to CNS endothelial cells, astrocytes have been thought to play a role in BBB function
(Fig. 2). Unlike pericytes, astrocytes are unique to the
CNS and perform a wide array of processes to maintain
proper neuronal function (Kimelberg and Nedergaard
2010). Much work has been done to investigate the effect
of astrocyte-secreted factors using in vitro BBB endothelial
cell models with mouse or human cells (Haseloff et al.
2005; Abbott et al. 2006). However, gliogenesis occurs
after functional BBB formation during embryonic development in mice (Kwan et al. 2012), excluding their possible
role in the establishment of the BBB in vivo. In adults, astrocytes interact with brain endothelial cells through
their end feet (Abbott et al. 2006), which suggests that
they are likely to be involved in the maintenance of BBB
endothelial cell properties. To date, the role of astrocytes
in the BBB has been implicated mostly through astrocyte
dysfunction in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases where it is known that BBB function is compromised (Abbott et al. 2006; Carvey et al. 2009; Daneman
2012; Obermeier et al. 2013; Phatnani and Maniatis 2015).
However, whether astrocyte dysfunction contributes to or
results from compromised BBB function during neurodegenerative disease is not yet clear. Nonetheless, as much
of our understanding of astrocyte regulation of the BBB
has been gained from disease models in which BBB function is compromised, more research is needed to better
understand how astrocytes regulate BBB function under
normal physiological conditions.
While the in vivo role of astrocytes in the BBB is not yet
known, several studies from rodents indicate that astrocytes selectively regulate BBB permeability. For example,
studies where adult rat brain astrocytes were transplanted
into rat iris tissue indicated that the presence of astrocytes
is sufficient to confer barrier function to endothelial cells
that vascularized the astrocytic grafts (Janzer and Raff
1987). Additionally, other studies have indicated that astrocytes restrict immune access into the brain. For example, one study implicated Hedgehog pathway signaling
between astrocytes and brain endothelial cells in regulating immune cell entry into the brain (Alvarez et al. 2011),
while another found that Vegfa secretion in astrocytes increased immune infiltration into the brain in a multiple
sclerosis mouse model (Argaw et al. 2012).
In mice, astrocytes are identified by their expression of
several markers, including the intermediate filament
Gfap, the water channel Aqp4, and the enzyme Aldh1l1
(Zhang et al. 2014). While zebrafish do not possess the
classic stellate astrocytes, they do contain a population
of radial glia, which express several key astrocytic molecular markers. However, whether these astrocyte-like cells
play a role in BBB function remains unclear. Zebrafish radial glia express Gfap in long extending processes (Jeong
et al. 2008) and react to CNS (retina and spinal cord) damage in ways similar to those of reactive astrocytes in mice
(Neve et al. 2012). While zebrafish radial glia also express
glutamine synthetase (GS), Aqp4 (Grupp et al. 2010),
and several tight junction markers, as seen in mouse astrocytic end feet (Corbo et al. 2012), these markers do
not necessarily share the same cellular distribution as
mammalian astrocytes. For example, in mammals,
Aqp4 is highly polarized in astrocytic end feet in direct
contact with blood vessels, but, in zebrafish, Aqp4 is
localized throughout entire radial glial processes, indicating a lack of polarization, and Aqp4+ radial glial processes
rarely contact the vasculature (Grupp et al. 2010). Similarly, Gfap+ radial glia rarely appear in close proximity
to blood vessels. Taken together, these observations
suggest that while radial glia may play several key roles
for ion homeostasis in zebrafish brains, their role in
the BBB may not be the same as that of astrocytes in
mammals. This differential role for radial glia in the
zebrafish BBB may be related to their evolutionary standing, as zebrafish have a more ancestral endothelial BBB
than mammals, with a less complex NVU, and this
should be remembered when using zebrafish as a model
system to draw larger comparisons with human barrier
physiology.
Other cell types
Pericytes and astrocytes are considered the key cell types
involved in BBB regulation through their interactions
with brain endothelial cells. However, several other cell
types, including fluorescent granular perithelial cells
(FGPs), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and microglia (Fig. 2), also lie in close proximity to CNS blood
vessels. Recent work has suggested that these other cell
types may regulate BBB permeability, arguing for an expansion of the classical view of the NVU.
For example, FGPs are a class of brain cells that are
found along the meningeal vasculature and in the perivascular space lining brain arteries. They were discovered in
rats (Mato et al. 1981) and recently were also characterized
in zebrafish (Bower et al. 2017; Venero Galanternik et al.
2017). These cells—known as FGPs (Mato et al. 1981;
Venero Galanternik et al. 2017), perivascular microglial
(PVM) cells (Hickey and Kimura 1988), ED2-positive perivascular cells (Graeber et al. 1989), or mural lymphatic endothelial cells (Bower et al. 2017)—have been implicated
in regulating barrier properties and maintaining CNS homeostasis (Mato et al. 1996; Jais et al. 2016; Bower et al.
2017; Venero Galanternik et al. 2017). Lineage tracing
studies in zebrafish demonstrate that these cell types are
derived from the optic choroidal vascular plexus endothelium (a blood vessel). Cells sprout from this structure and
then migrate to the pial surface to form a lymphatic endothelium (lymphatic vessels) that comprises the lymphatic
loop. From this stage, these cells spread over the brain surface, associating next to the blood vessels and adopting a
morphology characteristic of macrophages, becoming
the so-called “mural lymphatic endothelial cells” (Bower
et al. 2017; Venero Galanternik et al. 2017). However,
studies performed in rats using irradiation followed by
bone marrow transplantation indicated that these cells
are bone marrow-derived (Hickey and Kimura 1988). Further work is needed to determine whether there are species-specific differences in the origin of these cells or
O’Brown et al.
472 GENES & DEVELOPMENT

whether the embryonic and adult forms of these cells are
derived from different cellular pools.
Additionally, a recent study found a role for OPCs in
BBB permeability in mice (Seo et al. 2014). This work provided evidence that OPCs contact BBB endothelial cells in
the mouse brain. Additionally, cerebral hemorrhage was
observed in a dose-dependent manner in adult mouse
brains when Pdgfra-Cre was used to knock out Tgfb1 expression in OPCs, indicating that Tgfb1 signaling from
OPCs regulates barrier permeability. A second localization study provided further evidence that OPCs physically
interact with the pericytes of the BBB NVU (Maki et al.
2015). However, elucidating the role of OPCs in BBB
maintenance and determining whether these cells influence BBB permeability in zebrafish require further study.
Finally, microglia are present in the brain during the
time of BBB development in humans, mice, and zebrafish
(Hutchins et al. 1990; Herbomel et al. 1999, 2001; Ginhoux et al. 2010; Schulz et al. 2012). They play a role in
brain angiogenesis and CNS vascularization during development in mice and zebrafish (Fantin et al. 2010; Rymo
et al. 2011) and are found perivascularly in the adult brain
(Dudvarski Stankovic et al. 2016). Interestingly, recent
work suggests that microglia may play an integral role
in BBB repair after brain vascular injury (Lou et al. 2016).
However, their role in BBB development and maintenance
has been largely unexplored.
Much work has been done to profile the molecular signatures of each BBB cell type by microarray or RNA sequencing (Bondjers et al. 2006; Armulik et al. 2010;
Daneman et al. 2010a; Ben-Zvi et al. 2014; Zhang et al.
2014; He et al. 2016). Some of these transcriptional studies
have begun to reveal commonalities and differences not
only between cell types within species but also within
cell types between species (Zhang et al. 2014; Bennett
et al. 2016). Comparative proteomics have also revealed
that rodent and primate brain endothelial cells have similar proteomes but that levels of specific proteins (notably
several transporters, including the multidrug resistance
transporter p-glycoprotein) may vary across species
(Uchida et al. 2011; Hoshi et al. 2013). Thus, the differences between animal models and humans should be taken
into consideration when translating research findings observed in model organisms to therapeutic strategies in humans. Furthermore, with the advent of new sequencing
technologies, single-cell sequencing provides an opportunity to further characterize the cellular roles of all NVU
components in the BBB using an unbiased approach. Recent single-cell data suggest that there are nuanced differences within these general cell populations and provide a
new opportunity to discover novel cellular players at the
BBB (Darmanis et al. 2015; Zeisel et al. 2015).
From model organism to the human BBB
While it has been established by EM that humans have an
endothelial BBB with structural similarities to those found
in model organisms, such as tight junction complexes between endothelial cells, low levels of transcytosis within
endothelial cells, and close contact with pericytes and astrocytes (Allsopp and Gamble 1979), the precise functional
properties of the human barrier remain elusive, as it is
challenging to perform the standard BBB assays in humans.
However, several studies performed in humans provide
hints as to how the human BBBmay form and function. Importantly, Grontoft (1954) performed trypan blue leakage
assays in aborted human fetuses and demonstrated that,
as in mice and zebrafish, the functional human BBB is acquired during embryonic development.
Several studies have sought to assess leakage in human
disease states using endogenous plasma protein leakage in
post-mortem human tissue. Using immunostaining
against endogenous serum proteins, such as fibrinogen
and IgG as in mice, several groups have seen an increase
in barrier permeability, as evidenced by an increased number of perivascular cells with positive staining associated
with disease states such as malaria (Brown et al. 1999)
and Alzheimer’s disease (Ryu and McLarnon 2009). While
these studies observed plasma protein staining in both
aged and diseased brain states, with stronger leakage observed in diseased brains, an additional study by Bridges
et al. (2014) found that leakage of fibrinogen and IgG is a
general feature of aged brains rather than being specifically associated with disease.
Recently, a study performed with DCE-MRI in human
patients with mild cognitive impairment helped to clarify
these findings. This work demonstrated that study participants showed an age-dependent increase in BBB leakage
only in the hippocampus that was accelerated by the onset
of mild cognitive impairment, a disease state associated
with early stage Alzheimer’s disease (Montagne et al.
2015). The investigators supported their MRI findings by
measuring increased levels of albumin in the CSF of patients with mild cognitive impairment. They further correlated this increased BBB leakage and the associated
cognitive dysfunction with markers of pericyte damage
in the CSF, suggesting that age-dependent BBB leakage
could cause pericyte dysfunction, which could further
promote the increased BBB leakage observed in Alzheimer’s disease brains. Taken together, these studies
suggest that the human brain likely exhibits increased
BBB leakage with age. However, further work is needed
to clarify regional leakage patterns and determine the permeability of specific endogenous leakage substrates in
both normal and disease states.
From tracer assays of BBB function, analyses of BBB evolutionary conservation, and dissection of NVU cell type
functions, we are beginning to uncover how the BBB functions in model organisms. However, there is a relative
dearth of information directly analyzing these features
and functions in the human BBB. While human brains
are relatively similar to those of other mammals and
fish, human brains have several species-specific adaptations. Whether these differences in brain composition
and cellular subtypes alter BBB properties remains to be
seen. For example, human brains are known to have a higher proportion and increased complexity of neocortical astrocytes than rodent brains (Oberheim et al. 2006). As
astrocytes are a central component of the NVU, it will be
BBB across organisms

important to determine whether the higher astrocyte to
neuron ratio affects BBB properties in human brains. In addition to the increased astrocytic abundance, humans have
also expanded their neurogenic proliferative zone beyond
the ventricular zone and subventricular zone to include a
totally unique stem cell niche in the outer subventricular
zone (Lui et al. 2011), and how these differences in neurogenesis might affect BBB properties remains to be seen.
Recent work has sought to use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Lippmann et al. 2014; Lim et al.
2017; Vatine et al. 2017) to model human BBB function
in vitro. Use of such in vitro systems has the potential
to provide insight into how genetic alterations that lead
to neurological diseases may affect brain endothelial cell
properties, especially in diseases where mouse models
fail to recapitulate critical disease phenotypes. For example, a recent study generated iPSCs from human patients
with MCT8 deficiency (Vatine et al. 2017). Patients
with this genetic mutation have altered thyroid hormone
levels and exhibit severe neuropsychomotor impairments.
Mouse models mimic some aspects of this disease but
fail to display key neurological phenotypes after alteration
of Slc16a2 (the gene encoding Mct8) alone because mouse
brain endothelial cells express high levels of another
thyroid transporter that is not expressed in human brain
endothelial cells. Use of patient-derived iPSCs that were
differentiated to brain endothelial cells permitted molecular characterization of how SLC16A2 mutation likely affects MCT8-mediated thyroid transport into the brain in
this disease (Vatine et al. 2017). Thus, work using such human in vitro systems together with comparative BBB studies on differences in BBB composition and function across
species can elucidate how the human BBB functions. Due
to limited samples and information on the human BBB, it
is crucial to use a multipronged approach when studying
the BBB. While research performed with model organisms,
in vitro human cell culture, and MRI-DCE imaging in humans each has strengths and weaknesses, together they
are complementary approaches for testing hypotheses
about how the human barrier may be regulated in order
to guide therapeutic avenues.
Conclusion
While we have made much progress during the last century in defining barrier properties and characterizing the cellular nature of the BBB, the molecular underpinnings of
these properties require further examination. We are just
beginning to understand how BBB properties are established in brain endothelial cells on a molecular level.
While the developmental acquisition of BBB properties
has been characterized, future work aims to also elucidate
how BBB properties are maintained during adulthood both
under normal physiological conditions and in disease
states. In addition to studying brain endothelial cells and
pericytes, how other cell types comprising the NVU regulate BBB properties should also be investigated in vivo. Finally, the nature and properties of the human BBB remain
largely unknown. With future technological advances and
ongoing comparative studies, better understanding of the
human BBB can be gained to improve therapeutic efficacy
for clinical treatment of brain malignancies and neurodegenerative diseases.
