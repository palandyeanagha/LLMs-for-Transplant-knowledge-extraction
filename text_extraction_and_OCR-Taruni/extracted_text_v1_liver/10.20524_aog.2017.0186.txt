Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive, chronic liver disease characterized by unresolving 
hepatocellular inflammation of autoimmune origin. The clinical spectrum may vary from 
asymptomatic presentation, to non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, arthralgias, nausea and 
abdominal pain, to acute severe liver disease. AIH is characterized by the presence of interface 
hepatitis and portal plasma cell infiltration on histological examination, hypergammaglobulinemia, 
and positive autoantibodies. AIH is associated with other autoimmune diseases and its course is 
often accompanied by various non-specific hematological disorders. However, the coexistence of 
autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is infrequent. We present a case of a female patient diagnosed 
with type 1 AIH and agranulocytosis on presentation. A diagnosis of AIN was established, based 
on the patient’s sex, the underlying liver disease, the absence of alternative causes, the presence 
of atypical anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in patient’s serum and the favorable and dosedependent treatment of both pathologic entities with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil.

Introduction
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic relapsing liver 
disease characterized by hepatocellular inflammation caused 
by a combination of genetic failure of immune tolerance and 
environmental triggers. AIH is associated with the presence 
of interface hepatitis and portal plasma cell infiltration on 
histological examination, hypergammaglobulinemia and 
positive autoantibodies. A strong association of AIH with 
other autoimmune diseases has been reported. Concomitant 
hematological disorders, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, 
autoimmune thrombocytopenia and moderate leucopenia, 
are well documented. Nevertheless, the coexistence of severe 
neutropenia is very rare [5-7]. We present a patient with severe 
isolated agranulocytosis at the time of AIH diagnosis, with 
antineutrophil autoantibodies detected in the blood.
Case report
A 59-year-old female presented with non-specific right 
upper quadrant abdominal pain and intermittent fever with 
axillary temperature up to 37.9°C for a week, accompanied by 
mild arthralgias and general fatigue. She did not mention any 
history of prescription, herbal or over-the-counter medication, 
or consumption of alcohol or illicit drugs. Her medical history 
included a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 7  years previously 
because of acute calculous cholecystitis. She had no previous 
history of tattoos, no noteworthy allergies and no family 
history of liver, autoimmune or hematological disease. The 
results of the physical examination were unremarkable, except 
for mild icteric sclera and mild tenderness upon palpation of 
right upper quadrant of the abdomen without muscle tension.
Laboratory tests indicated acute hepatocellular liver injury 
with intrahepatic cholestasis. Specific values included aspartate 
aminotransferase 467 U/L (upper limits of normal [ULN]

total protein 8.8  g/dL (normal values: 6.6-8.3  g/dL), albumin 
3.6 g/dL (normal values: 3.5-5.2 g/dL), prothrombin time 11.6 sec, 
international normalized ratio 0.98. On presentation, the patient’s 
hemogram revealed mild leucopenia (3.30 × 109/μL) with severe 
isolated neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 554/L), 
with normal hematocrit (40.6%) and platelet count (208 × 109/L). 
A peripheral smear showed decreased neutrophils. The patient 
was admitted and further investigation ensued.
Abdominal ultrasound showed marginal splenomegaly 
(13 cm) without hepatomegaly. Abdominal magnetic resonance 
imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography 
revealed neither abnormal dilation of bile ducts nor filling 
defects. Serological markers for hepatitis A, B and C, 
cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex viruses, 
parvovirus B19, human herpes virus 6, HIV, toxoplasma, 
brucella, leishmania and mycoplasma were all negative. Mildly 
elevated ceruloplasmin levels and normal copper levels ruled 
out Wilson’s disease, while normal transferrin saturation and 
serum ferritin levels discarded hemochromatosis.
Serum protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal 
hypergammaglobulinemia with elevated IgG levels 
(3440  mg/dL). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA 1/320), antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA 1/640) and atypical 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (atypical pANCA 
– pANNA 1/320) were detected. The patient’s serum was 
negative for rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated 
peptide antibody, antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens, 
lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin and antiphospholipid 
autoantibodies. Serum levels of complement components and 
anti-β2GPI antibodies were normal. The patient was positive for 
anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies (199 U/mL). Given

characteristic extrahepatic manifestations, neither SLE nor 
other rheumatologic disease could be diagnosed definitively.
Since the patient refused any invasive diagnostic techniques, 
neither a liver biopsy nor a bone marrow biopsy was performed. 
No further investigation to evaluate the patient’s neutropenia, 
including flow cytometry with peripheral blood, was pursued. 
Using both the revised original scoring system of the 
International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAHG) [4] and 
the simplified criteria for the diagnosis of AIH [5] we ended 
with scores (10 for the former system and 6 for the simplified 
score) indicative of probable AIH. A diagnosis of type 1 AIH 
(AIH-1) and concomitant autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) 
was established [6-8].
Having presented with a severe neutropenia, the patient 
showed no improvement, with the lowest value (ANC 102/L) 
recorded during her 10th day of hospitalization. She was started 
on prednisone (60 mg/day) and a daily dose of granulocytecolony stimulating factor for two successive days until 
neutrophils were properly raised. A progressive normalization 
of serum transaminases and a gradual stabilization of 
neutrophil count were noted (Fig. 1A,B).
Upon discharge, she was on a regimen of oral prednisone 
(50 mg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (initial dose 
1500  mg/day). Because of the patient’s neutropenia, with 
the possibility of azathioprine-induced pancytopenia, MMF 
was chosen over azathioprine. During follow up, tapering of 
prednisone was initiated. The patient is currently on her eighth 
month of follow up and has exhibited a normal neutrophil 
count and transaminases for three months. She is under a 
regimen of 10 mg prednisone and 2 g MMF without side effects.
Discussion
AIN is classified as primary (no underlying pathology) 
and secondary [8]. In primary AIN, autoantibodies act 
against neutrophils that express human neutrophil antigens 
(HNAs)  [8]. Secondary AIN occurs within the context of 
systemic diseases. It is usually associated with autoimmune 
diseases, infections or malignancies (Table  1). In secondary 
AIN, the correlation between neutropenia and the presence of

HNAs is less well established and the target of the autoantibodies 
remains unknown [8]. These cases often present with other 
accompanying cytopenias [8].
Many cases of AIH, specifically those with AIH-1, present 
with atypical pANCA [7,9]. ANCA are antibodies against 
proteins of cytoplasmic granules or other constituents of 
neutrophil cytoplasm. Regarding their staining patterns, they 
have been described as c-ANCA when they label the whole 
neutrophilic cytoplasm and p-ANCA when they only label the 
perinuclear cytoplasm [9]. Despite efforts, a predominant target 
for ANCA in AIH has yet to be identified. These autoantibodies 
are usually described as “atypical pANCA” [10] and may target 
an antigen in the nuclear periphery of neutrophils. Therefore, 
the term “perinuclear antineutrophil nuclear antibodies” 
(pANNA) might be more suitable [10]. The detection of high 
titers of ANCA (prevalence rate 40-96%) [9] solidifies the 
diagnosis of AIH-1, although their role remains obscure [7].
AIN associated with autoimmune liver diseases at the time 
of diagnosis is very rare. We located only three cases of AIN 
in the context of AIH [1-3] with positive atypical pANCA. 
Our case represents a female patient with a flare of AIH-1 on 
a backdrop of possible chronic unresolved liver inflammation, 
complicated by severe AIN. In concordance with the existing 
literature, she was also positive for atypical pANCA [1-3]. The 
autoimmune origin of her secondary agranulocytosis can be 
advocated by the absence of alternative causes, the association 
with the AIH flare and the sustained response to treatment 
with corticosteroids and MMF [3,9]. It is not yet clear whether 
the detection of atypical pANCA plays an active pathogenic 
role in the development of AIN, or whether their presence is a 
signifier of autoimmune activity [3,7,9].
In conclusion, in our case of severe AIN at presentation 
of AIH-1, the presence of atypical pANCA implied a 
strong association with an autoimmune cause of secondary 
agranulocytosis. Therapy focused on treating the underlying 
disease could lead to resolution of both pathological 
processes. AIH-related agranulocytosis remains a very rare 
occurrence  [1-3], though AIH should be considered as a 
probable cause of AIN.
