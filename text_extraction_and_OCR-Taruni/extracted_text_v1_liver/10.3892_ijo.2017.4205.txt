Abstract. Nanocarriers, such as liposomes, have the potential 
to increase the payload of chemotherapeutic drugs while 
decreasing toxicity to non-target tissues; such advantageous properties can be further enhanced through surface 
conjugation of nanocarriers with targeting moieties. We 
previously reported that SP94 peptides, identified by phage 
display, exhibited higher binding affinity to human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) than to hepatocytes and other 
normal cells. Here, we confirm the tumor-targeting properties of SP94 peptide by near-infrared fluorescence imaging. 
Non-targeted PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (LD) 
and SP94-conjugated PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin 
(SP94-LD) were compared by assessing pharmacokinetics, 
tissue distribution, and antitumor efficacy in xenograftbearing mice, in order to investigate the effectiveness of 
SP94-mediated targeting for cancer therapy. SP94-LD 
demonstrated a significant increase in drug accumulation in 
tumors, while its plasma residence time was the same as its 
non-targeted equivalent. Consistent with this result, conjugation of targeting peptide SP94 enhances the therapeutic 
efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin in mouse models with 
hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts. Furthermore, combination targeted therapy exhibited a significant enhancement 
against orthotopic tumor growth, and markedly extended 
the survival of mice compared with all other treatments. 
Our study shows that SP94-mediated targeting enhances 
antitumor efficacy by improving tumor pharmacokinetics 
and tissue distribution, allowing large amounts of antitumor 
drugs to accumulate in tumors.
Introduction
Lipid nanoparticles have been widely used as pharmaceutical 
carriers to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutics (1). 
These drug carriers are expected to passively accumulate in 
tumors with leaky vasculature, via the enhanced permeability 
and retention (EPR) effect (2). One successful example is the 
reformulation of doxorubicin encapsulated into PEGylated 
liposomes. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline widely used in 
the treatment of various cancers, including metastatic breast 
cancer, ovarian cancer, and AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma; 
however, its efficacy is limited by its toxicity. Liposomal 
formulation enhances the therapeutic index of anticancer 
drugs, either by improving the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, or by decreasing the exposure of normal 
host tissues.
In order to improve the specificity of nanocarriers, targeting 
ligands may be attached to their surface via a PEG spacer arm. 
The targeting ligands, which are attached to the distal end of 
the spacer arm on the surface of nanocarriers, facilitate access 
of the carrier to the targeted site of interaction (3). Delivery 
of nanoparticle involving the use of peripherally-conjugated 
targeting moieties is known as active targeting. Active targeting 
is a promising tool for the treatment of cancer due to its ability 
to increase therapeutic effectiveness and reduce potential side 
effects. Active tumor targeting has been achieved using various 
targeting ligands, including antibodies (4) and their molecular 
fragments (5), nucleic acids aptamers (6), and small molecules: 
vitamins (7,8), peptides (9-12), and carbohydrates (13). The 
targeted form of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin is expected 
to become a major part of the next generation of this therapeutic modality.
The SP94 peptide (SFSIIHTPILPL), a targeting ligand 
isolated from phage-displayed selections (10,14), was reported 
to possess high and specific affinity for various human 
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and exhibit minimal 
interaction with healthy hepatocytes and other tissues (10,14). 
At the present time, the antigen recognized by SP94 has 
not been identified, but it has been immunohistochemically 
characterized. SP94 can bind to tumor cells in surgical 
specimens of hepatocellular carcinoma, but not to their normal

390 Wu et al: hepatocellular carcinoma-targeted nanoparticles for cancer therapy
counterparts. The unknown target molecule recognized by 
SP94 was reported to be expressed in ~60% of patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma (10).
In recent years, additional tumor-targeted delivery platforms modified with SP94 peptide are also being developed, 
including mesoporous silica nanoparticle-supported lipid 
bilayers (protocells) (14,15), bacteriophage MS2 virus-like 
particles (VLPs) (16) and HCC targeting probe (99mTc/188ReHYNIC-SP94) for imaging and therapy (17). Multivalent 
binding of SP94 peptide results in a 10,000-fold greater 
avidity for human hepatocellular carcinoma than for hepatocytes, endothelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 
B-lymphocytes, or T-lymphocytes (14). Exquisite targeting 
specificity of SP94 peptide combined with enhanced tumor 
delivery of multicomponent cargos permits sensitive discrimination between target and normal tissue. Thus, SP94 peptide 
is an ideal model with which to investigate the mechanism of 
active tumor targeting.
The potential of SP94 in drug delivery was subsequently 
evaluated using SP94-conjugated, doxorubicin-encapsulated 
liposomes. It was previously shown that SP94-LD is more 
effective than non-targeted LD in treating mice with xenografts of human hepatocellular carcinoma (10). SP94-targeted 
PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (SP94-LD) is believed to 
accumulate around cancerous tissue (via the EPR effect) and 
bind to the cancer cell surface, then being internalized by 
ligand-mediated endocytosis (via active targeting effect) (18). 
However, the role of active targeting in nanoparticle delivery 
is controversial, and it is difficult to predict how a targeted 
nanoparticle drug will behave in vivo. Herein, we confirm 
the mechanisms underlying the enhanced cellular uptake of 
SP94‑modified nanoparticles, and moreover, investigate the 
contribution of SP94 peptide during the cellular internalization of SP94-targeted nanoparticles.
To date, the only chemotherapeutic agent to exert a 
survival benefit in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
is sorafenib (19,20). In order to evaluate the feasibility of 
introducing SP94-targeted nanomedicine into clinical trials 
against liver cancer, we examined the pharmacokinetic 
profile, biodistribution, and in vivo antitumor activity of 
SP94-targted nanomedicine against hepatocellular carcinoma, and compared these properties to those of free drugs 
and non-targeted liposomal drugs. Furthermore, we found 
synergistic/additive growth inhibition by combination of 
doxorubicin and vinorelbine in HCC cell lines in vitro and 
in vivo. For in vivo evaluation, we developed an orthotopic 
hepatocellular carcinoma model to recapitulate the tumor 
growth pattern observed in liver cancer patients, and used this 
model to study the influence of the liver microenvironment on 
response to the combination therapy.
Materials and methods
Cell lines and cell culture. The Mahlavu and SK-HEP-1 human 
hepatocellular carcinoma lines were used in this study. The 
cell lines were maintained in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine 
serum at 37˚C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in air.
Peptide synthesis and labeling. Targeting SP94 (SFSIIHTPILPL) 
peptides were synthesized and purified by reverse-phase 
high-performance liquid chromatography to >95% purity by 
the Peptide Synthesis Core Facility, Institute of Cellular and 
Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica. The predicted mass 
was confirmed by mass spectrometry.
Synthesis of peptide‑PEG-DSPE conjugates. A total of 8.5 mg 
of NHS-PEG-DSPE [N-hydroxysuccinimido-carboxylpolyethyleneglycol (MW, 3400)-derived distearoylphosphatidyl 
ethanolamine] (NOF Corp.) dissolved in 0.25 ml of dichloromethane (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 0.25 ml of DMSO 
(Sigma-Aldrich) containing 3.1 mg of peptide. This was then 
mixed with 0.011 ml of triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) to 
catalyze the reaction. The stoichiometric molar ratio of 
peptide and NHS-PEG-DSPE was 1.1:1. The reaction was 
carried out for 72 h at room temperature. The peptide-PEGDSPE conjugates were purified by dialysis with a 2-kDa 
cut-off membrane (Spectrum), and were then dried through 
lyophilization.
Preparation of peptide-liposomal drugs. A lipid film hydration method was used to prepare PEGylated liposomes 
composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and 
mPEG2000-DSPE, which were then used to encapsulate 
doxorubicin (3:2:0.3 molar ratio) or vinorelbine (3:2:0.15 molar 
ratio). The lipid films were hydrated at 60˚C in 250 mM 
ammonium sulfate or 300 mM ammonium salts of 5-sulfosalicylic acid solution, and were extruded through polycarbonate 
membrane filters with a pore size of 0.1 µm using high-pressure 
extrusion equipment (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC, 
Canada) at 55˚C. Doxorubicin or vinorelbine were encapsulated by a remote loading method, at concentrations of 1 mg 
or 3.5 mg per 10 µmol of phospholipid, respectively. The final 
concentration of liposome was estimated by phosphate assay. 
The peptide-PEG-DSPE was subsequently incorporated into 
pre-formed liposomes by co-incubation at 60˚C, the transition 
temperature of the lipid bilayer, for 0.5 h with gentle shaking. 
Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) gel filtration chromatography 
was used to remove released free drug, unconjugated peptides, 
and unincorporated conjugates. Doxorubicin concentrations 
in the fractions of eluent were determined by measuring fluorescence at λEx/Em = 485/590 nm using a spectrofluorometer 
(Spectra Max M5, Molecular Devices). Vinorelbine concentrations were determined using the HPLC method.
Bacteriophage preparation and labeling. M13 bacteriophages 
were amplified in Escherichia coli, and phage titers were 
determined according to published procedures. Following titer 
determination, the bacteriophages were simultaneously labeled 
with succinimidyl esters of HiLyte Fluor™ 750 using a modified procedure (21,22). Briefly, HiLyte Fluor 750 succinimidyl 
ester was added to M13 bacteriophage in 100 µM bicarbonate 
buffer, pH 8.3. The resulting solution was incubated for 
1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following incubation, 
the labeled bacteriophage was precipitated by addition of a 
PEG-8000/2.5 M NaCl solution, and then left to stand on ice 
for 30 min. The bacteriophage was pelleted by centrifugation 
at 10,000 x g for 15 min. After removal of the supernatant, the 
pellet was resuspended in DPBS buffer. Typical dye labeling 
using this procedure resulted in 400-500 copies of each dye 
per bacteriophage particle.

In vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging. A total of 
4x1011 pfu of HiLyte Fluor 750-labeled PC94 phage was diluted 
in 100 µl saline solution. The saline solution was injected i.v. 
into mice bearing subcutaneous Mahlavu tumors. A control 
solution of 4x1011 pfu of the HiLyte Fluor 750-labeled control 
phage was injected into NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice bearing 
subcutaneous Mahlavu tumors. In vivo imaging was performed 
using a Xenogen IVIS® Imaging System 200. The animal 
was imaged at 0.1, 0.5, 6, 24, and 48 h post-injection using 
a Indocyanine Green (ICG) Filter set (excitation 710-760 nm, 
emission 810-875 nm). Organs were dissected and imaged 
48 h after injection of conjugate.
Animal model for in vivo targeting assay. The dorsolateral 
flanks of severe combined immunodeficient mice, NOD.
CB17-Prkdcscid/J (4-6 weeks old), were injected s.c. with 
5x106 Mahlavu or SK-HEP-1 cells. Tumors were measured 
with calipers, and mice were weighed twice weekly. The 
tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: 
length x (width)2 x 0.52. All animals were cared for in a 
specific pathogen-free room and treated in accordance with 
the animal care protocol approved by the Academia Sinica 
Animal Committee (approval no. 11-06-190).
Quantitative analysis. Plasma, brain, heart, lung, liver, 
kidney, or tumor samples were processed using the extraction 
procedure, and then analyzed using the method described by 
Laginha et al (23). Result concentrations were determined 
relative to the respective calibration curves.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP 
nick end labeling (TUNEL). Frozen tumor tissue sections 
were incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture (Roche 
Diagnostics) at 37˚C for 1 h. The slides were counterstained 
with Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) and mounted with 
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The slides were then 
visualized under a fluorescent microscope. The sections were 
analyzed using automated cell acquisition (TissueGnostics), 
and TUNEL-positive areas were quantified using MetaMorph 
software (Molecular Devices).
CD31 staining. The frozen tumor tissue sections were fixed 
with methanol/acetone (1:1), washed with PBS, and immersed 
in blocking buffer (1 % bovine serum albumin in PBS), followed 
by incubation with rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen). The 
sections were washed with PBST0.1 (0.1 % Tween-20 in PBS), 
and then incubated with rabbit anti-rat antibody (Stressgen) 
and immersed in rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody 
solution (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The slides were counterstained with Hoechst 33258, mounted with mounting medium, 
and visualized under a fluorescent microscope.
Complete blood count. Blood was collected by venipuncture 
of the right submandibular vein of unanesthetized mice with 
a lancet. Samples were drawn into plastic K2 EDTA blooddrawing tubes. Complete blood counts were performed using 
the Abbott CELL-DYN 3700 Hematology Analyzer (Abbott 
Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA). The parameters assessed 
were as follows: white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil 
absolute count (NEU), lymphocyte absolute count (LYM), red 
blood cell/erythrocyte count (RBC), hemoglobin concentration 
(HGB), hematocrit (HCT), red cell distribution width (RDW), 
platelet/thrombocyte (PLT), mean platelet volume count 
(MPV), plateletcrit (PCT), neutrophil percentage (NEU %), 
lymphocyte percentage (LYM %), monocyte percentage 
(MONO %), monocyte absolute count (MONO), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and 
platelet distribution width (PDW).
Drug combination study. Mahlavu cells were seeded in 
96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were 
treated in 96-well format in triplicate for each drug concentration combination, and viability was assessed after 3 days of 
treatment using the MTT-based assay. The cytotoxicity of each 
drug and of their combinations was assessed by drug response 
matrix using the Combenefit software (24). Loewe synergy 
score and HSA synergy score were calculated and plotting by 
SynergyFinder software (25).
Orthotopic implantation of human hepatocellular carcinoma 
in mice. NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice were used for HCC 
implantation. SK-HEP-1 cells were infected with Lenti-luc 
virus (lentivirus containing the luciferase gene). The mice 
were anesthetized via i.p. injection of Avertin, 2,2,2-Tribromoethanol (Sigma Chemical Co.) at a dose of 250 mg/kg. Prior to 
orthotopic implantation, a 1-cm laparotomy was performed, 
and orthotopic human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 
established by intrahepatic injection of 105 SK-HEP-1-Luc 
cells (luciferase-expressing cells) suspended in 30 µl DMEM 
into the left liver lobe. Post-injection bleeding and tumor cell 
escape were avoided by short-term local compression. The 
abdomen was closed using an absorbable 5-0 vicryl suture, and 
the skin was closed with a 5-0 proline suture. For orthotopic 
therapeutic studies, implanted mice were treated with different 
formulations of anticancer drugs. Tumor progression was 
monitored by bioluminescence quantification. Mouse body 
weight and survival rate were measured. Animal care was 
carried out in accordance with the guidelines of Academia 
Sinica, Taiwan. The experimental protocols were approved by 
the Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care and Utilization 
Committee (approval no. 11-06-190).
Data analysis. All data were expressed as the mean ± standard 
error (SEM) of at least 3 independent experiments. Statistical 
significance was assessed using a two-tailed Student's 
t-test with P<0.05 considered to be statistically significant. 
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma 
concentrations versus time was performed with pharmacokinetic parameters using WinNonlin software version 5.2 
(Pharsight, Mountain View, CA, USA).
Results
Ultrastructural analysis of in vitro trafficking of lipid 
nanoparticles. Intracellular trafficking is a determining 
factor in the therapeutic efficiency of nanoparticle-based drug 
delivery. In the present study, transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the mechanism of cellular uptake 
of SP94‑modified liposomes. TEM images of SK-HEP‑1 cells 

392 Wu et al: hepatocellular carcinoma-targeted nanoparticles for cancer therapy
incubated with SP94-LD or LD revealed that liposomes were 
internalized by vesicular transport, and partially escaped to 
the cytosol at the perinuclear region at 37˚C (Fig. 1A and B). 
After SP94-LD exposure, SK-HEP-1 cells exhibited numerous 
coated pit structures (Fig. 1C and D) and endocytotic vesicles 
in the cell membrane and cytoplasm (Fig. 1E-I). In contrast, 
few endocytotic vesicles were observed at the same magnification in cells incubated with LD (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the TEM 
images revealed that cells incubated with SP94-LD showed 
a high amount of internalized vesicles (Fig. 1J-M). The total 
vesicle area per SK-HEP-1 cell for SP94-LD was ~8.8-fold 
greater than that for LD (Fig. 1M).
Tumor accumulation and retention of near-infrared, fluoro‑
chrome-labeled, HCC‑targeted phage. Molecular imaging 
plays a critical role in oncological drug development, as stated 
in the FDA's Critical Path Initiative documents (26). To date, 
no molecular imaging method has been shown to accurately 
detect, characterize, or monitor the response of HCC to treatment. Labeling of phages with a near-infrared fluorescence tag 
enables the distribution of the phages to be efficiently tracked 
in vivo. We evaluated the in vivo distribution of PC94 phage 
using a previously described optical imaging method (22). 
Mice bearing subcutaneous Mahlavu tumors were intravenously injected with HiLyte Fluor 750-labeled PC94 phage or 
control phage, and phages were monitored at 0.1 and 0.5 h at 
the initial stages, and again at 6, 24, and 48 h post-injection. 
Fig. 2A shows representative near-infrared images taken at 
0.1, 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h post-injection from two subjects. Mice 
injected with HiLyte Fluor 750-labeled PC94 phage exhibited 
higher fluorescent signals in tumors, as compared to tumors in 
animals injected with control phage (Fig. 2A and B).
We proceeded to further evaluate the distribution profiles 
of PC94 phage in mice. The accumulation of phages in 
Mahlavu tumor peaked at ~24 h and then decreased gradually, but >80% of the peak level was retained in the tumor by 
48 h (Fig. 2B). The organ accumulation of phages in Mahlavu 
tumors was evaluated by near-infrared fluorescence imaging 
after sacrifice at 48 h post-injection, revealing that the SP94 
peptide enhanced accumulation in tumor sites, but not healthy 
organs including brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas, 
spleen and intestine (Fig. 2C and D).
Comparison of the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution 
profiles of SP94‑LD and LD. For pharmacokinetic analysis, 
SP94-LD and LD were administered to NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J 
mice at matched 2 mg doxorubicin/kg by tail vein injection. 
Blood samples were withdrawn at selected time-points, and 
were examined for doxorubicin content using a validated 
fluorescent quantitative method. The blood profiles of both

SP94-LD and LD were similar throughout the study, declining 
progressively over time (Fig. 3A). The time course of SP94-LD 
and LD accumulation in tumor and various organs are shown 
in Fig. 3B and C. The maximum total doxorubicin concentration in tumor was 1.53±0.47 µg doxorubicin/g tumor, which 
occurred at 24 h after SP94‑LD administration; 1.01±0.18 µg/g 
remained at 72 h (Fig. 3B). Maximum tumor accumulation of 
LD at 2 mg/kg (1.03±0.69 µg/g) occurred at 48 h post-injection, and gradually decreased with time to 0.89±0.69 µg/g at 
72 h post-treatment. At 24 h, tumor accumulation of SP94-LD 
was 1.6-fold higher than that of LD. In contrast, distribution 
of SP94-LD in all non-malignant tissues was similar to that 
of LD at all time-points (Fig. 3C). The tumor doxorubicin 
AUC0-72 for SP94‑LD was 81.75 µg h/g and the LD AUC0-72
was 58.23 µg h/g, representing a 1.4‑fold increase in doxorubicin AUC0-72 for mice treated with the targeted drug.
Intracellular distribution and accumulation of doxorubicin. 
To determine the amount of bioavailable drug in tumor cells, 
we performed whole body perfusion through the left ventricle 
of the heart with DPBS before analyzing biodistribution. This 
operation can eliminate blood and liposomes remaining in 
vessels and the interstitial space of tumors. After whole body 
perfusion, the tumor mass, brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidneys 
were harvested, and doxorubicin was quantified. We used 
intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin as an indicator of 
bioavailability of the liposomal drug. SP94-LD and LD were 
administered to tumor (SK-HEP-1)-bearing mice at matched 
1 mg doxorubicin/kg by i.v. injection. The doxorubicin levels 
were measured in the blood at different time-points using a 
fluorescent quantitative method. The blood profiles of both 
SP94-LD and LD were similar (Fig. 4A). Tumor uptake of 
SP94-LD at 1 mg/kg gradually increased, before peaking at 
0.99±0.24 µg/g at 24 h post-injection, while 0.70±0.13 µg/g 
remained at 48 h (Fig. 4B). Maximum tumor uptake of LD 
at 1 mg/kg (0.55±0.11 µg/g) occurred 24 h post-injection, 
and experienced almost no change over time, remaining at 
0.55±0.19 µg/g at 48 h post-injection. At 24 h, a 1.79-fold 
higher uptake of SP94-LD was observed as compared to LD. 
The tumor doxorubicin AUC0-48 for SP94‑LD was 34.45 µg h/g 
and the LD AUC0-48 was 21.27 µg h/g, representing a 1.62-fold 
increase in doxorubicin AUC0-48 when conjugated to SP94. 
The uptake of both drugs in most non-malignant tissues was 
low at 1 h post-injection; uptake of both drugs by liver and 
kidney gradually increased by 24 h, and then slowly declined 
thereafter (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the retention of SP94-LD 
in liver and kidney were lower than that of LD at 24 h postinjection, although these differences were not statistically 
significant (P=0.14 and P=0.06 respectively).
Efficacy of SP94‑targeted liposomal doxorubicin in hepatocel‑
lular carcinoma xenograft models. To evaluate the antitumor 
efficacy of systemically-administered SP94‑LD as compared to 
LD, NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J were inoculated s.c. with SK-HEP-1 
tumors. Mice bearing hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts 
(~100 mm3) were assigned into four groups for different treatments: A, SP94-LD; B, free doxorubicin (FD); C, LD; and 
D,PBS. Treatments were administered through tail vein injection,

NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice bearing SK-HEP-1 tumors (four mice per time-point) received tail vein injections of either LD or SP94-LD at 2 mg/kg. At 
selected time‑points post injection, mice were euthanized, and whole blood and various organs were excised and analyzed for doxorubicin auto-fluorescence 
signals. The levels of doxorubicin were quantified with a standard curve generated from the fluorescence emission of known amounts of doxorubicin (N=4).

1 mg/kg every 3.5 days, for eight doses with a total cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg. By day 28, administration of SP94-LD 
had significantly inhibited tumor growth by 74.6% (P<0.01), 
whereas treatment with LD and FD inhibited tumor growth by 
56.1 (P<0.01) and 11.6% (P>0.05), respectively (Fig. 5A and B), 
as compared to untreated controls. SP94-LD-mediated inhibition of growth was more significant than that mediated by 
LD (P=0.013). The SP94-LD and LD groups did not exhibit 
significant changes in body weight (Fig. 5C) or complete blood 
counts (Table I) during the treatment period.
Histological analysis of the SK-HEP-1 tumors revealed 
that FD, LD, and SP94-LD induced apoptosis (Fig. 5D and E), 
with SP94-LD treatment resulting in the greatest proportion of apoptotic cells (Fig. 5E). The CD31 (angiogenesis) 
index (Fig. 5F and G) of SP94-LD treated tumors was lower 
compared to that of tumors treated with FD, LD, or saline.
We have previously observed that SP94-peptide-targeted 
liposomal doxorubicin (SP94-LD) inhibits the proliferation of small tumors. Nevertheless, in many cancer cases in 
humans, the tumors are detected when they are large. Thus,

here we examined the activities of FD, LD, and SP94-LD 
against large tumors. Luciferase activity in live cells of mice 
bearing hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts was measured 
after i.v. injection with FD, LD, or SP94-LD (Fig. 6A). We 
observed a statistically significant reduction of tumor growth 
after i.v. treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with SP94-LD, 
as compared with tumors in untreated and FD or LD-treated 
mice (Fig. 6A and B). SP94‑LD significantly inhibited tumor 
growth as evidenced by a 91.47% reduction in luminescence 
(P<0.01), whereas treatment with LD reduced luminescence by 
96.01% (P<0.01) compared with untreated controls. SP94-LD 
inhibition of growth was more significant than that by LD 
(P=0.011). Neither SP94‑LD nor LD had a significant effect on 
body weight during the treatment period (Fig. 6C).
Effect of combination treatment with doxorubicin and 
vinorelbine in HCC cells. Previous study has shown that 
doxorubicin can inhibit HCC growth, but the clinical response 
was low. Combinations of anticancer agents with different 
mechanisms of action may be effective treatment regimens.

device. After the total flux of bioluminescence reached 9.5x109 p/s, mice were treated with 1 mg/kg SP94-LD, 1 mg/kg LD, 2 mg/kg FD, or PBS. All compounds were injected twice weekly via tail vein.

For this reason, we attempted to develop an effective treatment for HCC patients by combining two or more anticancer 
drugs. In this study, HCC cells were treated with doxorubicin 
or vinorelbine alone, or in combination using a dose-matrix 
approach to evaluate the drug combination effects at various 
drug ratios. To determine the combination response (additivity, 
synergy, or antagonism), the Loewe Additivity score (27) and 
the Highest Single Agent (HAS) score (28) were calculated for 
the drug combination using the software Combenefit (24) and 
SynergyFinder (25). Fig. 7A presents a dose-response matrix

between 6 concentrations of doxorubicin and 6 concentrations 
of vinorelbine in a 4-fold dilution scheme. The cytotoxicity of 
doxorubicin or/and vinorelbine over a wide range of molar ratios 
for HCC cells is shown in Fig. 7B. Vinorelbine significantly 
enhanced the effect of doxorubicin on the viability of HCC 
cells. Similarly, doxorubicin also enhanced the cytotoxicity of 
vinorelbine on HCC cells. The drug combination responses at 
various dose levels were quantified by computational methods. 
The dose-matrix combination showed the combination 
modeling between doxorubicin and vinorelbine by using the 
Loewe Additivity model (Fig. 7C) and HAS model (Fig. 7D). 
The synergy heatmaps showed that doxorubicin and vinorelbine have additive/synergistic effects (red areas in the model 
graph) on inhibiting cell proliferation at a wide range of drug 
combination ratio. These results suggest that the combined use 
of doxorubicin and vinorelbine may add an advantage to the 
current therapeutic regimens in liver cancer.
Therapeutic potential of combination therapy in an ortho‑
topic hepatocellular carcinoma model. Models based on the 
subcutaneous injection of cancer cell lines may not accurately 
reproduce the biology of human HCC. To study the influence 
of the liver microenvironment upon response to therapy, we 
developed an orthotopic liver cancer model to recapitulate 
the tumor growth pattern seen in liver cancer patients. We 
investigated the antitumor potential of i.v. administration of 
both SP94-targeted liposomal doxorubicin and liposomal 
vinorelbine to SK-HEP‑1‑Luc tumors stably expressing firefly 
luciferase. Orthotopic tumor growth was non-invasively 
monitored by bioluminescence imaging. Prior to the first 
therapeutic injection (4 days after tumor cell implantation), 
growing orthotopic tumors were found to be localized mainly 
at the liver (Fig. 8A).
Mice were treated with either vehicle alone (PBS), 
FD (1 mg/kg) + free vinorelbine 11 (FV) (2 mg/kg), 
LD (1 mg/kg) + stable liposomal vinorelbine (sLV) (2 mg/kg), 
SP94-LD (1 mg/kg) + SP94-sLV (2 mg/kg), or sorafenib alone 
(30 mg/kg) every other day for sixteen days. Bioluminescence 
was examined weekly to monitor tumor burden. 
Bioluminescence images revealed significant inhibition of 
tumor growth in the SP94-LD (1mg/kg)+SP94-sLV (2mg/kg)-
treated group compared with the vehicle control group, the FD 
(1 mg/kg) + FV (2 mg/kg) group, or the sorafenib (30 mg/kg) 
group (Fig. 8A and B). Body weight was not affected by any 
treatment regimen (Fig. 8C). Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
of all groups are shown in Fig. 8D. At the end of the study, 
the median survival times for the PBS, FD + FV, LD + sLV, 
SP94-LD + SP94-sLV, and sorafenib treatment groups were 
39.5, 20, 69, 75 and 41.5 days, respectively (Fig. 8D and E). A 
survival analysis with a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test revealed 
that SP94‑LD + SP94‑sLV treatment significantly extended 
animal survival as compared with PBS, FD + FV, LD + sLV, 
or sorafenib treatment (Fig. 8F).
Discussion
Lipid nanocarriers have been widely used to increase the 
efficacy of chemotherapeutics, largely through passive accumulation achieved by the enhanced permeability and retention 
effect (29). Additionally, their specificity and internalization 
by target tissues can be further enhanced by surface conjugation with targeting moieties (29-31). Nevertheless, insufficient 
differential affinity of targeting moieties between tumor 
and normal tissues remains a critical challenge for clinical 
application. This problem may arise because the molecules 
recognized by targeting moieties are not only expressed by 
tumor cells, but also by normal tissue. Therefore, it is of great 
importance to study the biodistribution and targeting potential 
of targeted nanocarriers.
Difficulties in developing specific imaging methods for 
HCC are caused by the lack of specific molecular targets, 
problems with drug delivery, and poor signal-to-noise ratios. 
It was previously reported that near-infrared, fluorochromelabeled phage probes allow for cancer targeting and imaging 
in vivo (22,32). In this study, we used near-infrared fluorochrome-labeled PC94 phage and in vivo fluorescence imaging 
techniques, which enabled us to study in vivo tumor targeting 
and tissue distribution of SP94 peptide over time in the living 
animal. The HiLyte Fluor 750-labeled PC94 phage was able to 
bind to HCC and exhibited more rapid tumor localization than 
the control, as evidenced by fluorescence images of the tumor 
ex vivo and in living mice. Both HiLyte Fluor 750-labeled 
PC94 phage and control phage accumulated rapidly at high 
concentrations in liver, spleen, and bone marrow, indicating 
that the mononuclear phagocytes of the reticuloendothelial 
system (RES) are involved in the clearance of some of the 
circulating phages in mice. Although the tumor-to-background 
ratio was satisfactory in this study, the uptake of near-infrared 
fluorochrome-labeled phages by the RES is, nonetheless, quite 
obvious.
To investigate the potential of SP94 peptide as a target 
ligand for the delivery of therapeutics to tumors, we used 
this peptide to modify a clinically-used PEGylated liposomal 
drug through post-insertion technology, and examined the 
resulting pharmacokinetic profile and biodistribution in vivo. 
This post-insertion technique facilitates efficient insertion 
of ligand-PEG-DSPE conjugates into preformed liposomes 
under the right conditions (33). The plasma pharmacokinetics 
of SP94-LD was found to be indistinguishable from that of 
LD, indicating that the SP94 peptide conjugation did not 
compromise circulation time or stability. Comparison of the 
biodistribution of SP94-LD versus LD at 24 h post-treatment 
showed that doxorubicin accumulation was greater in the tumor, 
and that accumulation was 1.6-fold greater for SP94-LDtreated as compared with LD-treated mice. The bioavailable 
drug concentrations of SP94-LD reached maximum levels by 
24 h after injection, and SP94 targeting increased drug delivery 
to intracellular tumors by 1.8-fold. While SP94-LD and LD 
have similar plasma circulation profiles, the presence of the 
SP94-targeting moiety enhances drug delivery to tumors and 
the bioavailability of drug in tumors. However, SP94 targeting 
did not affect doxorubicin accumulation in the brain, heart, 
lung, liver, or kidneys. These results indicate that SP94-LD 
may improve the therapeutic index by increasing drug accumulation in the tumor, but not in normal tissue.
The use of peptides as targeting ligands offers several 
advantages, including low immunogenicity, small size, 
ready diffusion, ease of manufacturing, and simple targeted 
formulation assembly, when compared to larger biomolecules, such as antibodies. Previous studies showed that 

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY 52: 389-401, 2018 399
using larger biomolecules as targeting ligands may increase 
the clearance of antibody-modified nanoparticles from the 
blood (34‑36). This may be due to non-specific binding and 
uptake of nanoparticles by the RES (35). Our results showed 
that the modification of liposomes with SP94 peptide does 
not enhance immunogenicity, and has identical plasma 
pharmacokinetics as the original formulation. In addition, SP94-mediated targeting enhanced tumor delivery by 
increasing overall tumor accumulation and cellular uptake, 
without affecting delivery to noncancerous host tissues or 
enhancing host toxicity. These findings were confirmed by 
in vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging and biodistribution analysis. Previous studies with other targeted delivery 
systems have also suggested that targeting moieties increase 
Figure 8. Establishment of orthotopic models of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the therapeutic potential of combination therapy. NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice 
were orthotopically implanted with SK-HEP-1-luc cells, and treated with vehicle (PBS), FD (1 mg/kg) + FV (2 mg/kg), LD (1 mg/kg) + sLV (2 mg/kg), 
SP94-LD (1 mg/kg) + SP94-sLV (2 mg/kg), or sorafenib (30 mg/kg), at 4 days after tumor inoculation. All compounds were injected every other day via

drug accumulation in tumor tissues (37,38). However, targeted 
nanoparticles have not always caused a significant increase in 
overall tumor accumulation as compared to the non-targeted 
drugs. Previous studies showed that the use of macromolecule 
targeting ligands, such as antibodies (39) or transferrin (40), 
have a negligible impact on tumor accumulation and biodistribution. The differential effects of nanoparticles modified with 
macromolecules and those modified with small molecules 
may be due to differences in molecular size, affinity, and 
penetrability of the targeting ligand (41). It is possible that 
targeting moieties with high affinity would be subject to 
greater internalization and degradation by perivascular 
tumor cells, thereby limiting their penetration of tumors and 
reducing their tumor retention (42,43).
At the time of writing, only sorafenib has been shown to 
exert a survival benefit in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (19,20). In our orthotopic liver cancer model, we found 
that sorafenib had no effect on tumor growth. FD + FV showed 
antitumor growth effects compared with PBS control group at 
day 8, 12 and 16 (Fig. 8A). However, the combination drugs 
induced the toxicity by markedly decreasing their body weights, 
leading to the death of the mice (Fig. 8C). LD + LV showed 
significant antitumor growth effects and reduced drug toxicity. 
SP94‑LD + SP94‑LV exhibited even higher therapeutic efficacy than LD + LV in an orthotopic model of human HCC, by 
reducing tumor size and prolonging the overall survival rate of 
the mice (Fig. 8). SP94-LD + SP94-sLV combination therapy 
shows strong clinical potential for treatment of HCC.
In conclusion, SP94‑modification of liposomal doxorubicin significantly improves therapeutic efficacy in human 
SK-HEP-1 tumor-bearing NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mice, and 
significantly inhibits tumor cell viability, resulting in reduced 
tumor volumes and final average tumor weights compared 
with control nonspecific treatments. The rapid, massive, and 
specific accumulation of SP94-LD in tumor cells results 
in prominent tumor growth regression. These therapeutic 
outcomes confirm the key role of the tumor-specific binding 
and internalization of SP94-LD in achieving elevated local 
concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents inside tumors. 
These findings suggest a potential clinical benefit from 
SP94-targeted liposomal doxorubicin and liposomal vinorelbine combination therapy.
In conclusion, we have evaluated whether it is worth 
considering SP94-LD for use in clinical trials against liver 
cancer. SP94‑LD caused significantly greater inhibition of 
human hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft tumor growth 
when compared with LD, without increasing toxicity. 
SP94-LD has similar plasma pharmacokinetics as LD. 
Moreover, SP94‑mediated targeting enhances therapeutic efficacy in the hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft mouse model 
by improving tumor pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution, 
allowing large amounts of antitumor drug to accumulate in 
tumors. These results indicate that SP94-mediated targeting 
for cancer therapy has distinct advantages over standard LD. 
Furthermore, it provides a promising opportunity to further 
improve the therapeutic index of the original formulation, 
which can be rapidly translated into the clinic given the 
availability of LD. Our results should also encourage further 
research to expand the application of this targeting ligand to 
various other drug-delivery nanoparticles.
