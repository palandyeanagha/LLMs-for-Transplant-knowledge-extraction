The Spanish Society of Liver Transplantation held a consensus seminar to ensure continuous 
improvement of quality and results in liver transplantation. The seminar was divided into 2
workings groups made up of professionals. One group was in charge of developing a set of 
quality indicators that can be monitored to provide periodic measurement and evaluation of 
pertinent aspects of the service provided. This consisted of developing a set of relative 
indicators for the units, defining them and standardizing them. A second seminar was used by 
professionals to select indicators with the desired degree of reliability, validity and precision. 
Indicators were subjected to a pilot study and critical analysis by an improvement task force.

Quality indicators were selected from the set of quality indicators for cirrhosis care developed 
by Kanwal et al. in 2010.76 Methods used by Kanwal et al.: 1) Review existing clinical 
guidelines to establish a taxonomy of candidate quality indicators. 2) Review the literature 
linking the quality indicators to clinically important outcomes; grading of the evidence. 3) 
Selection of expert panel (11 gastroenterologists) to review the quality indicators. 4) Modified 
RAND/UCLA process to rate the appropriateness of each quality indicator. 5)Face-to-face 
meeting to focus on disagreements, identifying additional quality indicators, modifying 
definitions, and deleting problematic or irrelevant metrics; followed by re-rating the metrics. 6) 
Post-hoc analysis: panelists re-rate the importance of the metrics, where importance was 
defined as the magnitude of health benefit derived from the performing the indicated process.

Working Group was established to develop key performance indicators that would enable each 
unit to determine its performance against best practice parameters. The working group met six 
times in 2011, and after extensive consultation and discussion, six indicators were selected (2
transplant specific indicators), which were endorsed by the Renal Health Clinical Network 
leadership group. Indicator targets were initially adopted using established criteria or agreed 
performance levels, but required numerous revisions and iterations in response to problems 
with interpretations by renal health services. After 12 months of data collection and multiple 
changes to/ clarification of definitions, the data appeared accurate and auditable. The indicator 
working group continued to meet regularly and was responsible for quarterly analysis, ensuring 
the indicators remained accurate, meaningful and relevant.

Aim of the study was to determine the association between perioperative quality metrics and 
patient/graft outcomes with the goal of developing a composite kidney transplantation quality 
index. No rationale provided for the selection of their initial set of quality metrics, which were 
compared to rates of inadequate center performance reported by the SRTR. The means of the 
quality measures that revealed significant associations (p<0.05) (ICU days, EHR, and inhospital complications or safety events) were used to develop the composite quality metric.

mortality, inpatient complications, safety events,

The Southeastern Kidney Transplant Coalition was formed with a mission of improving equity 
in access to kidney transplantation for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. This group 
consists of voluntary stakeholders in the ESRD community: ESRD patients, dialysis facilities, 
Time to transplant referral
New patient referrals
Referrals by race

transplant centers, social workers, organ procurement organizations, healthcare providers, 
academic researchers, patient advocacy groups, and ESRD Network 6 staff.
A population needs assessment was performed by coalition members, the results of which 
helped the members develop a multicomponent, quality improvement intervention to deliver 
among dialysis facilities in order to reduce racial disparities in access to kidney transplantation.

Transplantation Community Study.)

Figure S2. Bubble chart demonstrating the use of the different domains of quality 
metrics over time. The area of the bubble is proportionate to the number of articles 
reporting a metric within that domain of quality in that year. If a metric was reported by 
multiple articles spanning multiple years, then each reference/year was counted as 1
article reporting that domain of quality. If 2 or more articles in 1 year reported a specific 
metric, then each reference would contribute 1 data point. For example, in-hospital 
mortality was cited by four articles and was counted as a safety metric in all four years 
(2011, 2014x2, and 2016).
