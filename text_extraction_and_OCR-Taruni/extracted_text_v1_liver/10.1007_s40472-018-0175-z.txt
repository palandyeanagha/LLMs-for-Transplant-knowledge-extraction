Abstract
Purpose The number of simultaneous liver-kidney transplants (SLKT) performed in the USA has been rising. The Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network implemented a new policy governing SLKT that specifies eligibility criteria for
candidates to receive a kidney with a liver, and creates a kidney waitlist “safety net” for liver recipients with persistent renal
failure after transplant. This review explores potential impacts for liver patients and the kidney waitlist.
Recent Findings Factors that have contributed to the rise in SLKT including Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)-based
allocation, regional sharing for high MELD candidates, and the rising incidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis will continue to
increase the number of liver transplant candidates with concurrent renal insufficiency. The effect of center behavior based on the
new policy is harder to predict, given wide historic variability in SLKT practice.
Summary Continued increase in combined liver/kidney failure is likely, and SLKT and kidney after liver transplant may both
increase. Impact of the new policy should be carefully monitored, but influences beyond the policy need to be accounted for.

Introduction
Renal failure after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is
an important risk factor for poor overall survival [1].
Moreover, pre-OLT renal dysfunction is predictive of
post-OLT renal failure [2, 3]. Simultaneous liver-kidney
transplantation (SLKT) has thus been employed as a treatment
modality for individuals with end-stage liver disease (ESLD)
and renal dysfunction, as a means to abrogate this risk. Since
the introduction of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score for purposes of deceased-donor liver
allocation, which is heavily influenced by serum creatinine,
there has been a substantial increase in the number of SLKT
performed in the USA [4].
Concern has arisen surrounding the practice of SLKT, at
least in part due to the absence of any specific policy addressing the allocation of the deceased-donor kidneys in the context
of simultaneous renal-non-renal organ transplantation. Prior to
August 2017, there were no existing formal SLKT criteria,
such that centers could indicate the “need” for a kidney to be
transplanted with a liver at their own discretion, including in
situations where actual survival benefit from SLKT versus an
isolated liver transplant was unclear [5], or when native renal
recovery was likely. Organ procurement organizations (OPO)
historically allocated the liver according to the liver match run,
and if so indicated, the kidney would accompany the liver,
presuming the candidate was listed in the same donor service
area as the OPO. Note that this remains true for other combinations, such as heart-kidney and lung-kidney—the kidney
“follows” the primary organ according to that organ’s match
run. As has been reviewed previously, this practice is counter
to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
(OPTN) Final Rule, primarily as it occurs in the absence of
standardized medical criteria and is based largely on geographic proximity between donor and recipient [6•].

Simultaneous Liver-Kidney Transplantation: Impact on Liver Transplant
Patients and the Kidney Transplant Waiting List

In response to the above concerns with SLKT, the OPTN
organized a Working Group in 2014 to resume development
of policy language to address the allocation of organs to
individuals with ESLD and renal dysfunction. This
Working Group was comprised of members of multiple
OPTN committees, including Kidney Transplantation,
Liver and Intestinal Transplantation, OPO, Ethics,
Minority Affairs, and Operations and Safety, and built on
a well-documented basis of work in this realm [4, 7, 8].
The policy language developed through data review, discussion, deliberation, and compromise was ultimately ratified by the OPTN Board of Directors in June 2016, and
was implemented August 10, 2017. The details of the
SLKT allocation development have been extensively
reviewed elsewhere [6, 9, 10], and the policy itself can
be found online on the OPTN’s website [11]. In brief,
the new policy outlines medical eligibility criteria for
adult candidates to receive a kidney transplant concurrent
with a liver transplant, delineated by the presence of
chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury
(AKI), or select metabolic diseases (Table 1). The SLKT
policy also includes a “safety net” for all recipients of
OLT who do not recover renal function after OLT, or subsequently develop advanced, persistent renal dysfunction
within 60–365 days of transplant. Safety net candidates
are assigned significant allocation priority in the kidney
allocation system in order to receive an expedited kidney
after liver transplant, appearing ahead of other local adult
candidates [12]. Now that the meetings, debates, negotiations, and voting have all been completed, what can be the
anticipated effect of this new policy on liver patients, and
on the kidney transplant waiting list?
Frequency of SLKT
One realm in which impact of the new SLKT policy is anticipated concerns the absolute number of SLKT that occur. As
indicated in Fig. 1, the number of SLKT performed in the USA
has been increasing, and exceeded 700 in the year 2016. In
addition, the relative proportion of liver transplants performed
as part of an SLKT has increased steadily, from 2.7% in 2000 to
9.3% in 2016. As serum creatinine is a prominent variable in
the MELD equation, patients receiving liver offers have had an
increasing burden of renal dysfunction since the adoption of
MELD-based allocation policy. This was demonstrated early
after MELD adoption, with an increase in proportion of liver
transplant recipients having serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl from
7.9% in April 1999 to 10% in December 2004 [5]. Additional
policy change has prioritized sicker patients for broader regional sharing: “Share 35,” implemented in June 2013, dictated
regional sharing of liver grafts to candidates with a MELD
score of 35 or higher, as data analysis had indicated waitlist
mortality in this subgroup of patients was comparable to that of
status 1 patients [13]. The overall median MELD scores at
transplant increased from 27 to 28, with scores in the postimplementation era ranging from 25 to 35 across OPTN regions [14]. In the pre-implementation era, 18.5% of OLTs were
performed in candidates with MELD > 35, which increased
to 26.5% post-implementation of “Share 35.” Since adoption of this expanded regional sharing for higher MELD
candidates, there has been continued increase in the percentage of SLKT, from 7.7 to 9.3% of total OLT. Thus,
MELD-based allocation and “Share 35,” with the continued
increase in number of candidates on the liver waitlist, have
contributed to a rising absolute number and proportion of
SLKT.
The newly adopted SLKT allocation policy represents another influence on this process, though it is difficult to predict
whether the net influence of the policy itself will be upward or
downward on the number of SLKT performed. Indeed, as
reviewed by Nadim et al., there has existed considerable regional variability in listing practices for SLKT. In their survey
of US transplant centers, 25% used a CKD GFR cutoff of
40 ml/min as an indication for SLKT, and one third of programs used an AKI dialysis duration of 4 weeks [15•]. Going
forward, some centers, particularly those with aggressive
SLKT utilization, will clearly have fewer candidates eligible
than they historically listed, while other programs who had
been more restrictive may actually expand their listing. It
has been estimated that 19% of SLKT recipients over a recent
10-year period would not have met the new eligibility criteria
[10], but the literature lacks an estimate of how many more
OLT recipients could potentially have been eligible, yet received an isolated liver transplant. Important to predicting
the number of SLKTs that may occur going forward is the fact
that the new policy sets minimum medical eligibility criteria,
Table 1 Medical eligibility criteria for simultaneous liver-kidney
transplantation. A transplant nephrologist must confirm that candidates
meet one of the below criteria in order for them to receive SLKT organ
offers
Chronic kidney disease (defined by having a glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) ≤ 60 ml/min for at least 90 days), and at least one of the
following:
• The most recent GFR ≤ 30 ml/min
• Has initiated chronic dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
Acute kidney injury, as evidenced by having a combination of either
of the following for 6 consecutive weeks (must be documented
every 7 days):
• Requiring acute dialysis treatment
• GFR ≤ 25 ml/min
Metabolic disease:
• Hyperoxaluria
• Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) due to mutation
of either factor H or factor I
• Familial non-neuropathic systemic amyloidosis
• Methylmalonic aciduria
2 Curr Transpl Rep (2018) 5:1–6

but does not require that candidates who meet them be listed
for or receive an SLKT. It is conceivable that some centers will
reflexively list and transplant all eligible candidates for SLKT,
while others will continue to use more discretion, particularly
with the availability of the safety net for those with renal nonrecovery. Furthermore, the policy requires that a transplant
nephrologist verify that candidates meet the eligibility criteria.
Operationally mandating involvement of nephrology will
likely have an impact on listing practices, and may tend to
drive downward the proportion of candidates approved by
centers for SLKT.
Changes in the ESLD population will also play a significant role in the frequency of SLKT. In 2015, Wong et al.
reported that the number of adults with non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) awaiting liver transplant had almost
tripled from that in 2004 and that NASH had become the
second-leading disease among liver transplant waitlist registrants [16•]. More recently, Cholankeril et al. confirmed that
NASH is the most rapidly growing indication for OLT in the
USA [17]. Furthermore, the presence and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were associated with
an increased risk and severity of CKD in a recent meta-analysis, and thus there is an anticipated increase in the burden of
CKD in liver transplant candidates [18]. In fact, Singal et al.
reported that over a decade, NAFLD accounted for a significant increase in SLKT, rising from 8.2% in 2002 to 22% in
2011, while the proportion of transplants performed for hepatitis C (HCV) or alcohol-related liver disease dropped from 52
to 40% [19]. With advances being made in direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV, and the majority of treated patients now
achieving sustained virologic response, the frequency of
HCV-related ESLD and renal failure is expected to decrease.
While HCV does cause renal dysfunction in some patients, the
growth in number of liver transplant candidates with NASH
and concurrent CKD will outpace any decline related to
control of HCV.
On the whole, there will likely be a continued increase in
the absolute number of SLKTs performed in the USA following enactment of the new OPTN SLKT allocation policy
based upon the changing demographics of ESLD. However,
caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions about
causality based on the sheer number. The policy will likely
reduce the proportion of liver transplant candidates listed for
SLKT—in part due to the fact that some candidates who historically would have been listed for SLKT will simply not be
eligible. The trend toward transplanting at higher MELD
scores, though, is unlikely to change, and these patients by
definition are more likely to have renal dysfunction. Also,
the relative proportion and absolute number of liver transplant
candidates with NASH as the etiology of cirrhosis are likely to
continue their climb. The burden of CKD in this growing
population will likely be the dominant force, and will drive
the number of SLKT upward. Thus, in coming years, if the
current trend is not attenuated, there may be as many as
800–1000 deceased-donor kidneys annually allocated to
SLKT candidates, representing 6–7% of deceased-donor
kidneys effectively removed from the pool available to
the kidney-alone waitlist.

Fig. 1 The number of SLKT performed in the USA has grown from fewer than 150 per year to more than 700 over the past 15 years. The percent of total
liver transplants performed as SLKT has also risen four-fold over this time
Curr Transpl Rep (2018) 5:1–6 3

In addition to the sheer number of SLKTs occurring, the
kidney community is affected by which deceased-donor
organs are allocated as such. Historically, kidneys allocated for SLKT have generally been “higher-quality” organs
than those transplanted as kidney alone. For example,
Reese et al. showed that the mean Kidney Donor Profile
Index (KDPI) for kidneys transplanted as SLKT was 36%,
compared to 46% for kidney alone [20]. In other words,
roughly half of the kidneys allocated “above” the kidneyalone match run to SLKT recipients are those that the
Kidney Allocation System (KAS) is designed to preferentially allocate to pediatric kidney candidates—projected to
number 400–500 per year. Similarly, Cheng et al. noted
that 33% of the donor kidneys in their paired analysis
had a KDPI < 20%, a subset of kidneys that KAS intends
to allocate preferentially to kidney candidates with the longest expected post-transplant survival [21]. Thus, SLKT, as
well as other renal-non-renal multi-organ transplants, will
continue to concentrate donated kidneys with poorer expected performance in the remainder pool allocated to
kidney-alone candidates. The organ transplant community
will need to consider whether allocation priority schemes
should take such issues into consideration.
Safety Net Implications
The implementation of a safety net to allow accelerated access
to kidney transplantation for OLT patients with persistent renal failure is an important component of the new SLKT policy.
Liver transplant recipients who require chronic renal replacement therapy, or develop persistent CKD with a glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) ≤ 20 ml/min, are eligible for safety
net allocation priority when registered for a kidney transplant
between 60 and 365 days after liver transplant. Safety net
eligible patients will be prioritized above the local adult kidney waiting list population for donor kidneys with a KDPI >
20%, although safety net priority will remain below other
prioritized groups including highly sensitized patients, 0-
ABDR mismatches, prior living donors, and pediatric patients
[12]. Additionally, safety net allocation priority does not apply
to the highest quality deceased-donor kidneys (KDPI ≤ 20%).
Justification for the adoption of a safety net includes its aim to
improve the survival of early post-OLT recipients with renal
failure via expedited kidney transplantation. Since OLT recipients with severe renal dysfunction or dialysis dependence
have significantly impaired survival [22] and high waitlist
mortality on the kidney transplant waiting list [23], physicians
may have erred on the side of caution and listed patients for
SLKT when there was uncertainty regarding native renal recovery prior to the existence of the safety net. However, past
analyses have shown that patients who receive a timely kidney
after liver transplant (KALT), within 1 year after liver
transplant, achieve similar overall survival rates compared to
SLKT recipients [8]. On the other hand, rejection-free kidney
graft survival may be higher in SLKT recipients, suggesting a
possible immunoprotective effect observed only when receiving a liver from the same donor as the kidney [24]. The safety
net is intended to alleviate the burden of “guessing incorrectly,” and incentivize isolated OLT when there remains potential
for renal recovery. It remains uncertain to what degree the
safety net will contribute to transplant center behavior modification and SLKT listing practices for patients who may meet
the minimum eligibility criteria, yet have reasonable potential
for renal recovery.
Historically, a small minority of patients have been listed
and transplanted within 1 year of OLT, as the majority of
KALTs occurred several years later [25•]. According to
OPTN data, from 2005 to 2013, 361 patients were registered
for KALT within 1 year of OLT, an average of 40 per year
[26]. During that same time period, only 93 patients actually
received a KALT within the first post-OLT year, and of these,
only 57 came from deceased donors (average 6.3 per year)
with the remaining coming from living donors [26]. While
the use of early deceased-donor kidney transplantation has
previously been infrequent following OLT, with negligible
impact on the total deceased-donor kidney pool, predicting
the expected utilization of early KALT under the new safety
net is challenging. The priority given via the safety net translates into shorter waiting times until kidney transplant for
those candidates. Thus, it is likely that a higher percent of
patients who are listed under the safety net will survive to
kidney transplant. Further, while persistent renal failure following OLT is a relatively uncommon event overall [3, 27],
there will likely be an increase in patients with post-OLT renal
failure following the adoption of the medical eligibility
criteria, as the number of ESLD patients with renal dysfunction that receive an isolated OLT increases. As with the total
SLKT volumes, the number of candidates eligible for kidney
priority via the safety will be reflective of continued increase
in OLTs done for patients with NASH, obesity, diabetes, and
other comorbidities that increase the risk of post-OLT renal
failure [28•, 29]. As such, if the safety net leads to a substantial
increase in early deceased-donor KALT, it is conceivable that
any decrement in the number of SLKT due to the new eligibility criteria may be offset by rising numbers of KALT. It
seems nearly certain that between SLKT and safety net prioritization for KALT, we will see a net overall increase in
deceased-donor kidneys being allocated to liver transplant
patients.
Role of Living Donor Kidney Transplantation
It is important to consider the role that living kidney donation
could play in this arena. In many ways, living kidney donation
4 Curr Transpl Rep (2018) 5:1–6

has always provided a “safety net” to liver transplant
recipients with renal failure and an available donor.
Knowledge of a willing and acceptable living kidney
donor can and should inform the decision of whether a
liver transplant candidate with renal dysfunction should
be considered for SLKT. From an organ-shortage vantage
point, centers should be reluctant to list candidates for
SLKT in the presence of a viable living donor. For safety
net situations, candidates should be encouraged to pursue living donation despite the relative list priority afforded them by
the new policy. There will likely exist some impetus to await a
deceased donor because the expected waiting time will be
“short,” but in reality, it is difficult to predict how long a given
candidate will wait once they have met safety net priority
listing criteria. The waiting time will undoubtedly be affected
by geography, sensitization, and blood type, among other
things. Such candidates should be counseled about the relative
survival benefit of receiving a living donor kidney transplant
compared to a deceased donor [30]. A discussion of the
relative benefits should include the fact that the safety net
provision does not include priority for kidneys with KDPI
≤ 20% (“Sequence A”), and that candidates are unlikely to
receive a deceased-donor kidney that exceeds the quality
of a living donor kidney. Further, living donor kidney
transplantation could be done at any time deemed appropriate
by the transplant team, not being bound to the time constraints
of the policy.
Conclusion
In addition to the likelihood of having more kidneys removed
from the pool that is allocated to “kidney-alone” recipients,
those transplanted as either SLKT or via the safety net will be
disproportionately higher-quality organs (lower KDPI). Thus,
some degree of decline in outcomes for this non-liver-kidney
transplant population should be anticipated. This policy also
does not alter the fact that multi-organ transplant candidates,
including SLKT, continue to receive priority above all kidneyalone transplant candidates, even those groups prioritized by
KAS, such as pediatric patients, prior living donors, and those
that are highly sensitized. The performance of this policy will
be scrutinized by many, and that scrutiny will clearly include
numeric counts of donor kidneys that are transplanted as
SLKT and as safety net transplants to prior OLT recipients,
and the incidence of living donor KALT. Additionally, it is
important to ensure that the relative donor quality is reported
across the spectrum of SLKT, safety net, and kidney-alone
transplants. Waitlist, graft, and patient outcomes should be
compared for the affected groups (SLKT, isolated OLT, safety
net, and kidney-alone recipients). This policy and practice lie
at a complicated intersection of a medical urgency-based allocation system (liver) and a largely utility-based system
(kidney). Inferences, conclusions, and further policy revisions
will necessarily be difficult to come by, but all should be
informed by meticulous collection and analysis of data.
Beyond SLKT, refinements need to be made to other multiorgan allocation situations, such as heart-kidney, lung-kidney,
and heart-liver. The transplant community is watching carefully as this important step is taken into codification of
multi-organ transplantation.
