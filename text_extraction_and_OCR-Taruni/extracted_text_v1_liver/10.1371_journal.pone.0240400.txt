Abstract
Background & aims
Although metabolic risk factors are associated with more severe COVID-19, there is little
evidence on outcomes in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We here
describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of NAFLD patients in a cohort hospitalised for COVID-19.
Methods
This study included all consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 between February and
April 2020 at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, with either imaging of the liver available dated within one year from the admission or a known diagnosis of NAFLD. Clinical data
and early weaning score (EWS) were recorded. NAFLD diagnosis was based on imaging or
past medical history and patients were stratified for Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index. Clinical endpoints were admission to intensive care unit (ICU)and in-hospital mortality.
Results
561 patients were admitted. Overall, 193 patients were included in the study. Fifty nine
patients (30%) died, 9 (5%) were still in hospital, and 125 (65%) were discharged. The
NAFLD cohort (n = 61) was significantly younger (60 vs 70.5 years, p = 0.046) at presentation compared to the non-NAFLD (n = 132). NAFLD diagnosis was not associated with
adverse outcomes. However, the NAFLD group had higher C reactive protein (CRP) (107
vs 91.2 mg/L, p = 0.05) compared to non-NAFLD(n = 132). Among NAFLD patients, male
gender (p = 0.01), ferritin (p = 0.003) and EWS (p = 0.047) were associated with in-hospital
mortality, while the presence of intermediate/high risk FIB-4 or liver cirrhosis was not.

Conclusion
The presence of NAFLD per se was not associated with worse outcomes in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Though NAFLD patients were younger on admission, disease stage
was not associated with clinical outcomes. Yet, mortality was associated with gender and a
pronounced inflammatory response in the NAFLD group.
1. Introduction
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus -2
(SARS-CoV-2), a newly discovered member of the coronavirus family which includes also the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [1]. The SARS-CoV-2 causes predominant respiratory disease and may
lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but may also affect other organ systems and
cause intestinal, hepatic and neuronal disease, with multiple organ failure (MOF), and death, potentially occurring in severe cases [2, 3]. Interestingly, increasing evidence suggest that a cytokine
release syndrome-like (CRS) is responsible for adverse outcomes in the subset of critically ill patients
[4]. By March 2020, the number of cases and countries affected increased dramatically to the extent
that the World Health Organisation characterised the COVID-19 situation as a pandemic [5].
According to preliminary results, an older age and/or the presence of pre-existing metabolic
conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease define a category of patients
at high risk for severe COVID-19 [6]. Interestingly, these risk factors also identify a group of
patients at higher risk for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) [7]. NAFLD encompasses
a wide spectrum of liver disease, from simple steatosis to Non-Alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
with a variable degree of fibrosis to cirrhosis [7]. Overall, NAFLD is considered the leading cause
of chronic liver disease worldwide with an estimated global prevalence of 25.4%, which becomes
even higher among those with metabolic risk factors [8]. However, as there is currently no established screening, a large number of cases with significant liver disease remain undetected [9].
Patients with NAFLD might be particularly susceptible to severe disease from COVID-19
as they carry a particular combination of risk factors. Firstly, the presence of type-2 diabetes,
which is highly prevalent in this group, confers an additional susceptibility to infection per se,
regardless of long-term glycaemic control [10]. Secondly, considering a higher prevalence of
cardiovascular disease, patients with NAFLD may show a decreased cardiac reserve and
impaired response in a critical care setting [11, 12]. Finally, given the high rates of obesity,
patients with NAFLD may frequently present with co-existing chronic lung disease (i.e.
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, restrictive lung disease), characterised by difficult intubation and reduced response to ventilation [13]. Nevertheless, at present, there is still little
knowledge on how the NAFLD population is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 15].
In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients
with NAFLD admitted and diagnosed with COVID-19 compared with non NAFLD COVID19 positive admissions. Furthermore, we explored the association between risk factors and
clinical outcomes in this group.

(either ultrasound or computerised tomography) dated within 1 year from the admission for
COVID-19 or a known diagnosis of NAFLD were included in the analysis.
The NAFLD group was compared with all patients with available imaging within one year
before the admission. At the time of presentation, a full range of clinical, demographic and laboratory parameters were recorded. As part of the COVID-19 risk-stratification pro-forma set up in
our Trust, all patients were specifically interrogated for alcohol consumption, drug history and
medications. NAFLD was diagnosed based on imaging or past medical history, while patients
with excessive alcohol consumption and other causes of liver disease [16] were excluded. For
those with NAFLD, Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) was calculated based on the published formula [17]
derived from blood tests dated within 1 year before the admission for COVID-19.
As per standard of care, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in naso-pharyngeal swabs using a realtime reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Chest radiographs or
CT scans were also performed according to clinicians’ evaluation and were interpreted in line
with hospital and professional guidelines [18]. Heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), blood
pressure (BP) and temperature (TC) were recorded at the time of the hospital admission. The
early warning score (EWS) was also calculated based upon physical observations and neurological status at the time of the admission [19]. Details regarding the time interval between the
onset of symptoms and hospital admission as well as clinical evolution (such as oxygen requirement, invasive and non-invasive ventilation rates) were recorded. Comorbidities were included
as per patients’ medical history. Clinical outcomes were defined as rates of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality and were monitored until the 10th June 2020.
As per hospital guidelines, patients were stratified according to the CRS grading system
which is based on the presence of fever, levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and oxygen requirements at presentation [20]. In our Trust, the CRS grading system is used to identify patients at
higher risk of clinical deterioration.
2.2 Statistical analysis
The distribution of variables was explored using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since the data were
non-normally distributed, continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile
range (IQR), while categorical variables were expressed as relative frequencies and percentages
(%). The difference between the groups was explored using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis for continuous variables and Chi square for categorical variables. Significant variables were
carried forward to regression analysis to identify the odds ratio (OR) of the variables independently associated with outcomes. OR were reported with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
Multivariate analysis was carried out to adjust crude OR for confounding factors.
All tests were two-sided and a p value = 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS© (version 23.0; SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).
2.3 Ethics
This study was retrospective and included only fully-anonymised data from investigations and
assessment performed as standard of care. As such, no ethical approval was required as confirmed by the Joint Compliance Office at Imperial College London.
3. Results
3.1 Study population
A total of 561 adult patients were admitted at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust with a
diagnosis of COVID-19 up to the date of data collection. Overall, 193 patients had imaging of

the liver dated within 1 year from the COVID-19 admission. Specifically, 61 (31%) had fat
infiltration on imaging (CT scan or US), while 132 (66%) had no evidence of liver disease.
Those with other causes of liver disease (n = 5, 3%) were excluded. Specifically, 4 patients were
excluded as they reported excessive alcohol consumption, and 1 patient had autoimmune hepatitis: all 5 patients were discharged.
At the time of outcomes update collection (10th June), 9(5%) patients were still in hospital,
125(65%) were discharged and 59 (30%) died. In those with a complete outcome (i.e. discharged from hospital or death), the median length of stay was 7 days (4–12). The cause of
death was respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia in54 (91%) cases, respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary embolism in 2 (3%), stroke in 2 (3%) and acute kidney
failure in 1 (2%) case. The rate of ICU admission was 19% (n = 38).
In the NAFLD group, median age was 60 (53–75) years, median BMI was 30.6 (27–33.8) kg
and60% (n = 37) were male. As per medical records, only 20% (n = 13) of the NAFLD patients
was already being followed-up by a liver service. At the time of the data collection, 1 (2%)
patient was still in hospital, 42 (68%) were discharged and 18 (29%) did not survive. In those
with a complete outcome, the median length of stay was 7 days (3–14). The overall rate of ICU
admission was 18% (n = 11). The prevalence of comorbidities is displayed in Table 1, while
the distribution deaths per age range in Table 2. Finally, the two groups were homogeneous in
terms of comorbidities.
3.2 NAFLD vs non-NAFLD population
3.2.1 Differences between NAFLD and non-NAFLD population. When the NAFLD
cohort was compared to the non-NAFLD cohort, those with NAFLD were significantly younger
(60 vs 70.5 years, p = 0.046) and had a higher BMI (30.6 vs 27.1 kg/m2
, p = 0.003). At presentation,
the NAFLD group had significantly higher CRP levels (107 vs 91.2 mg/L, p = 0.05) compared to
the non NAFLD group. However, the distribution of patients across the CRS categories was not
significantly different between the two groups. In terms of outcomes, there was no difference in
rates of admission to ICU and in-hospital mortality. Notably, those with NAFLD tended to present to the hospital earlier than those without NAFLD (5 vs 7 days, p = 0.035) (Table 2).
In the study population, male gender (OR 2.4, 95%CI: 1.2–5.1, p = 0.013), age (OR 1.03,
95%CI: 1.01–1.06, p = 0.001), lymphocyte count (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.23–0.89, p = 0.02) and
CRS category (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 1.08–1.7, p = 0.01) were predictive factors of in-hospital mortality (S1 Table). Of note, the presence of NAFLD was not associated with admission to ICU
(OR1.14, 95% CI: 0.53–2.5, p = 0.69) or with in-hospital mortality (OR0.86, 95% CI: 0.44–1.69,
p = 0.67), after adjusting for confounding factors (age, male gender, type-2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia).
3.2.2 Difference between NAFLD and non-NAFLD stratified for metabolic factors.
The whole population was then stratified for the components of metabolic syndrome based on
the presence of type-2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. The presence of overweight/
obesity was not included in the analysis as BMI values were incomplete in 58 (30%) patients.
Overall, 23 (12%) patients had 3 metabolic risk factors. In this sub-analysis, there was no
difference between NAFLD (n = 9, 4%) and non-NAFLD (n = 148) group in terms of clinical
parameters and observations at admission. Also, there was no difference in terms of admission
to ICU (p = 0.66) and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.37).
Sixty-one (31%) patients were clustered for the presence of 2 metabolic risk factors. There
was no difference between NAFLD (n = 39, 19%) and non-NAFLD (n = 3612%) presence in
terms of clinical parameters and observations. Moreover, there was no difference in terms of
admission to ICU (p = 0.43) and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.16).

A total of 51 (26%) patients had only one metabolic risk factor. Again, there was no difference between NAFLD (n = 20, 10%) and non-NAFLD (n = 31, 16%) subgroup in terms of clinical observations, including admissions to ICU (p = 0.55) and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.43).
Finally, 58 (30%) patients did not present any metabolic risk factor. In this subgroup, there
was no difference between NAFLD (n = 7) and non NAFLD (N = 51) patients in terms of clinical parameters, admission to ICU (p = 0.27) and in-hospital mortality (p = 0.07).
3.3 Factors associated with mortality in the NAFLD population
In the sub-group of patients with NAFLD, we analysed the difference between those who died
(n = 18) and those who were discharged (n = 42) from the hospital (Table 3). The cause of
death was respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia in 16 (89%) and stroke in 2
(11%) cases. One patient still hospitalised (1%) at the time of data collection was excluded
from this sub-analysis of outcomes.
More male patients died in the NAFLD group (71% vs 50%, p = 0.04). Also deceased
patients in the NAFLD group had significantly higher levels of ferritin (2076 vs 688 μg/L,
p = 0.003), PT (14.4 vs 13 s, p = 0.04), LDH (498 vs 314 U/L, p = 0.025), lactate (1.7 vs 1.2
mmol/L, p = 0.002) and troponin (34 vs 10 ng/L, p = 0.02). Also, those who died presented
with significantly higher RR (28 vs 20 br/min, p = 0.01) and EWS (7 vs 3, p = 0.009) compared
to those who survived (Table 3).

On multivariate analysis, only male gender (OR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2–5.7, p = 0.01) ferritin levels
(OR 1.002, 95% CI: 1.000–1.002, p = 0.043) and EWS (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 1.05–1.6, p = 0.049)
were independently associated with in-hospital mortality, after adjusting for confounding factors (Table 4). Notably, ferritin (p = 0.06) and EWS (p = 0.21) were not associated with in-hospital mortality in the non-NAFLD group.
3.4 Severity of liver disease and outcomes
In the NAFLD group, 6 (9%) patients had a diagnosis of cirrhosis: 3 with Child-Pugh A, 2 with
Child-Pugh B and 1 with Child-Pugh C. Fibrosis index-4 (FIB-4) was available in 38 (62%)
patients (calculated on blood tests dated within 1 year but before the admission for COVID19). According to FIB-4 values, the NAFLD group was stratified into 3 categories: 20 (33%)

with in-hospital mortality (Table 5). Similarly, they were not associated with ICU admission.
4. Discussion
The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a public health emergency worldwide [21]. The
increasing number of cases has led to unprecedented efforts at containment, given the rapid
spread in the community, the high mortality among critically ill patients and the lack of treatment. So far, studies have suggested that older age, the presence of comorbidities and the
development of acute respiratory distress syndrome are associated with increased mortality
[22]. As such, there is much interest in phenotyping those who may be at risk for severe
COVID-19 in order to develop specific surveillance or containment measures.
NAFLD represents an increasing cause of liver disease and is expected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation worldwide, as a consequence of the epidemic of metabolic
risk factors [8]. Overall, NAFLD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from
both liver and non-liver related events (i.e cardiovascular disease (CVD)) with fibrosis stage
representing the main prognostic factor [11]. As patients with NAFLD carry a particular combination of comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, obesity and CVD), it has been argued that
this group may also be at high risk for severe COVID-19 infection [15].
In this cohort of 193 patients with liver imaging available, admitted for COVID-19 in central London, we found that the overall prevalence of NAFLD was 30%. When compared to the
non-NAFLD cohort, there was no difference in terms of overall mortality or age-stratified
mortality (Table 2). Similarly, there was no difference in terms of ICU admission rates. However, given the strong age-dependent effect on outcomes in COVID-19, it is worthy to mention
that patients with NAFLD were significantly younger than those without NAFLD (60 vs 70.5
years, p = 0.046) (Table 1). In terms of prognostic factors, the presence of NAFLD per se was
not associated with adverse outcomes in the whole study population.

Increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection can be bi-phasic [23]. An early
phase is directly related to the virus pathogenic effect (flu-like phase) and may be followed by a
relatively late phase (cytokine release syndrome (CRS)-like phase) in a subset of patients [6].
The cytokine storm appears to be the main reason for clinical deterioration and high mortality
[4]. In this study, we found that the NAFLD group showed higher CRP (107 vs 91.2 mg/L,
p = 0.05) levels compared to the non-NAFLD, although they were distributed equally among
CRS categories (Table 2). These results suggest a more pronounced inflammatory status at
presentation in patients with NAFLD. Interestingly, these results were unlikely due to a
delayed admission, as those with NAFLD also tended to present to the hospital earlier since
the onset of symptoms (5 vs 7 days, p = 0.035).
Another interesting finding was that the inflammatory status did not differ when the whole
population was stratified for other metabolic risk factors. Notably, given the high numbers of

missing BMI values, the presence of overweight/obesity was not included in this sub-analysis.
As such, it might be argued whether obesity could have a major impact on CRP values, as
those with NAFLD were heavier than those without NAFLD (BMI 30.6 vs 27.1, p = 0.003). In
line with this, recent evidence has suggested that higher BMI is associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 [24]. Further studies are required to assess the impact of body weight
among patients with NAFLD and COVID-19 infection.
An enhanced inflammatory response was particularly evident among the NAFLD patients
who died during the admission. In particular, the NAFLD patients who died were more frequently men and presented with higher inflammatory markers (ferritin, PT and LDH) compared to NAFLD patients who survived. Moreover, the NAFLD patients who died had higher
troponin levels (34 vs 10 ng/L, p = 0.034) in the context of normal BNP, suggesting the presence of a lower cardiac reserve in response to stress. Furthermore, the Early Weaning score
(EWS), an algorithm which is usually applied for triaging patients at risk for acute deterioration [19], was also significantly higher (7 vs 3, p = 0.001) at presentation among those with
NAFLD who did not survive. Of note, there was no difference in terms of liver function tests
between the two groups, suggesting that liver injury was not a discriminant factor in this population. On regression analysis, ferritin and EWS at presentation were independently associated
with mortality in the NAFLD group, highlighting the importance of the inflammatory storm
on outcomes. Of note, male gender was also independently associated with mortality in the
NAFLD group, confirming a well-known gender-based difference in terms of clinical outcomes from this infection [25]. Further studies will need to explore the role of gender, ferritin
and EWS as predictors of outcome in NAFLD patients hospitalised with COVID-19.
When the NAFLD cohort was stratified according to FIB-4 risk categories, only age and
BNP increased significantly with FIB-4 (Table 5). Moreover, the presence of intermediate/high
risk FIB-4 as well as the presence of liver cirrhosis were not associated with adverse outcomes
in the NAFLD cohort. These results suggest that the severity of COVID-19 in patients with
NAFLD is not attributable to the severity of underlying liver disease, but rather other factors,
which could include the host inflammatory response in view of the correlation with surrogates
of inflammation. Another important finding of this study was that only 20% of patients with
NAFLD admitted for COVID-19 were followed-up by a liver service, emphasizing the undiagnosed cases of NAFLD in the general population.
Our study presents some limitations. Firstly, the authors acknowledge that the study population was relatively small; however, we included consecutive patients with imaging of the liver
available or known diagnosis of NAFLD, providing a more reliable selection of the study
cohort: NAFLD vs non-NAFLD patients. Moreover, some of the data collected were incomplete, as shown in Tables 1 and 3. However, for the essence of this retrospective data collection, we relied on information recorded as part of the clinical assessment. Secondly, as the
NAFLD patients were not followed-up in a specialist setting, results from other non-invasive
markers of fibrosis (i.e. liver stiffness measurements) and/or liver histology scores were not
available, reducing the accuracy in stratifying for severity of liver disease. Nevertheless, we
opted for the calculation of FIB-4, currently recommended as a screening tool in the general
population [26]. Thirdly, the number of patients with established NAFLD associated cirrhosis
was probably insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. Finally, a follow-up and outcomes
after discharge were not included in the analysis.
In conclusion, in this study, we report that the presence of NAFLD per se was not associated
with adverse outcomes in our cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 positive patients, and the presence of advanced liver disease was not associated with adverse outcomes in the NAFLD population. Nevertheless, NAFLD patients were significantly younger at presentation, although
there was no difference in terms of age-stratified mortality. Mortality in the NAFLD group was

associated with male gender and with a particularly-pronounced host inflammatory response,
with ferritin and EWS at presentation as main predictors. Further studies are needed to ascertain the role of the host inflammatory response in influencing mortality in this group.
