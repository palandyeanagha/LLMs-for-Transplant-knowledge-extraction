Abstract
Background: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a well-known complication of ulcerative colitis (UC), but it is rare 
to encounter patients requiring both living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and proctocolectomy. We report a case 
of elective two-stage surgery involving proctocolectomy performed after LDLT for a patient with early colon cancer 
concurrent with PSC-related UC. To our knowledge, this is the frst report of concurrent cancer successfully treated 
with both LDLT and proctocolectomy.
Case presentation: A 32-year-old Japanese man with colon cancer associated with UC underwent restorative proctocolectomy at 3 months after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for PSC. He was diagnosed with PSC and UC 
when he was a teenager. Conservative therapy was initiated to treat both PSC and UC. He had experienced recurrent 
cholangitis for years; therefore, a biliary stent was placed endoscopically. However, his liver function progressively 
deteriorated. Colonoscopic surveillance revealed early colon cancer; hence, surgical treatment was considered. PSC 
progressed to cirrhosis and portal hypertension; hence, LDLT was performed before restorative proctocolectomy. 
Three months after LDLT, we performed restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was well, with good liver and bowel functions and without tumor recurrence, more than 1 year after proctocolectomy.
Conclusions: With strict patient selection and careful patient management and follow-up, elective proctocolectomy 
may be performed safely and efectively after LDLT for concurrent early colon cancer with PSC-related UC. There are 
no previous reports of the use of both LDLT and proctocolectomy for the successful treatment of PSC-related UC and 
concurrent cancer.

Background
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is one of the most 
common indications for liver transplantation (LT) and 
is a well-known complication of ulcerative colitis (UC) 
because of the associated autoimmune characteristics 
[1–4]. UC is a well-recognized risk factor for colon cancer [5–8]; therefore, we occasionally encounter a complicated situation in which a patient with PSC develops

concurrent UC-related colon cancer. When the liver 
function is adequate, isolated proctocolectomy might be 
reasonable. However, if liver failure becomes deteriorated 
enough to require LDLT, then it is difcult to decide 
which treatment procedure to use because of the difculty in performing isolated proctocolectomy. We report 
a case of elective two-stage surgery involving proctocolectomy after LDLT for concurrent early colon cancer 
with PSC-related UC.
Case presentation
A 32-year-old man was admitted to our hospital to 
undergo surgery for colon cancer associated with pancolitis-type UC that had been diagnosed 20 years previously. He was simultaneously diagnosed with PSC 
(Fig. 1); therefore, his UC was considered PSC-related. 
PSC and UC had been well-controlled until the development of severe colitis, diagnosed as toxic megacolon 
5  years previously and treated using aminosalicylates, 
azathioprine, and adalimumab; cholangitis was also 
present, which was treated with endoscopic biliary 
stenting. After colitis and cholangitis were treated, the 
patient had been well, and his liver function remained 
acceptable. However, his total bilirubin level gradually increased to approximately 5–8  mg/dl and colon 
cancer developed. Surveillance colonoscopy revealed 
two superfcial neoplastic lesions. Slightly elevated 
lesions were detected in the ascending and transverse 
colon (Fig.  2). Pathological biopsy fndings indicated 
well-diferentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the 
ascending colon and an adenoma in the transverse 
colon. Because mucosal reddening was observed in the 
colon (Mayo endoscopic subscore 1–2), we diagnosed 
UC-related colon cancer. Isolated proctocolectomy 
was initially considered, but the patient’s liver function 
progressively deteriorated with severe concurrent portal hypertension. Te Child–Pugh classifcation was C 
(score 11), and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
score was 15. Because his UC-related colon cancer was 
diagnosed as T1bN0M0 stage I, we expected a postoperative outcome similar to that of sporadic colon cancer [9–11], which has an estimated 5-year survival rate 
of > 90% according to the Japanese Society for Cancer 
of the Colon and Rectum sporadic cancer data [12].

Terefore, we eventually decided to perform LDLT 
before restorative proctocolectomy.
LDLT for PSC was performed using a relatively smallfor-size (463 g; ratio of the graft volume to the recipient 
standard liver volume, 38.9%) right liver graft from his 
27-year-old wife. Because their blood types were incompatible, rituximab was administered for 2  weeks before 
surgery. During surgery, severe adhesion was observed 
between the right lobe and diaphragm with multiple collateral veins that contributed to a large amount of bleeding; however, LDLT was successfully performed without 
any other signifcant complications. Biliary reconstruction using Roux-Y hepaticojejunostomy (instead of 
duct-to-duct reconstruction) was performed, as generally adopted for LT for PSC. Te operative time was 
619  min and the estimated blood loss was 16,761  g. 
Te postoperative course was uneventful except for the 
development of small-for-size syndrome with massive 
ascites (1120 ml/day). Te peak total bilirubin level was 
20  mg/dl at 10  days after surgery. Te patient was discharged on postoperative day 20 after his liver function 
had normalized. Basic immunosuppression medication 
consisted of tacrolimus, steroids, and mycophenolate 
mofetil. Tere were no signs of rejection. Follow-up colonoscopy was performed at 1 month after LDLT, and no 
exacerbation of colon cancer was detected. Tree months 
after LDLT, we performed restorative proctocolectomy 
with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis. Severe adhesion 
was observed in the upper abdomen. After resection of 
the colon, a J-pouch was constructed and returned to 
the abdomen. A hand-sewn ileal pouch–anal anastomosis was created and a temporary diverting ileostomy 
was constructed. Te operative time was 572  min and 
the estimated blood loss was 1445  g. Te postoperative 
course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on 
postoperative day 16. Severe infammation was observed 
in the whole resected colonic mucosa, and the right colon 
was brown because of mucosal hemorrhages (Fig.  3a). 
Two superfcial neoplastic lesions were detected in the 
ascending and transverse colon. Pathological examination revealed well-diferentiated to moderately diferentiated adenocarcinoma in the mucosa of the ascending

colon without lymph node metastasis (Fig.  3b, d). A 
low-grade tubular adenoma was observed in the transverse colon (Fig. 3c). Infltration of infammatory cells to 
the submucosa was observed in the colon. After surgical 
dilatation of the anastomosis stricture, ileostomy reversal was performed 10 months after proctocolectomy. Te 
patient was well thereafter, with good liver and bowel 
functions and without tumor recurrence, at>1 year after 
proctocolectomy. Te entire clinical course of this case is 
shown in Fig. 4
Discussion
UC is a well-recognized complication of PSC. Te current comorbidity rate of UC for patients with PSC in 
Japan ranges from approximately 20% to 55%, which is 
lower than the range of 30% to 80% for Western cohorts 
[1–4]. Although UC is also recognized as a risk factor for 
the development of dysplasia or cancer [5–8], we rarely 
encounter a patient with PSC-related UC and concurrent colon cancer requiring both LT and colectomy, as 
in the current case. Fukuhara et  al. reported a case of 
proctocolectomy for colon cancer with PSC-related UC 
that was detected after LDLT [13]. However, there are no 
reports of concurrent cancer successfully treated with 
both LDLT and proctocolectomy.
Te treatment of this case presented several challenges. 
Te frst involved the timing of proctocolectomy. Proctocolectomy could not be independently performed without 
LT because of severe liver failure. Simultaneous proctocolectomy with LDLT without a stoma could have resulted 
in anastomotic leakage as a potentially fatal complication. 
Even with the stoma, we were concerned that it might 
be difcult to control the fuid balance due to the possible massive fuid loss, not only from the ascites, but also 
from the intestine. Poritz et al. reported that patients with 
PSC who require colectomy can undergo simultaneous 
orthotopic LT and total abdominal colectomy; thereafter, 
they can be candidates for subsequent ileal pouch–anal 
anastomosis reconstruction when the liver function has 
improved [14]. However, unlike whole LT, small-for-size 
syndrome with massive ascites is a specifc and signifcant complication of LDLT [15]. Te patient developed 
small-for-size syndrome with a peak total bilirubin level 
of 20 mg/dl and massive ascites. However, if we had performed LDLT frst without proctocolectomy, then bacterial translocation might have been a concern, especially

with immunosuppression, because infammatory bowel 
diseases, including UC, are known to cause a high risk of 
bacterial translocation [16–19]. Eventually, we planned to 
perform two-stage surgery with LDLT frst because UC 
was expected to be controlled with immunosuppression. 
Fortunately, the posttransplant course was uneventful, and 
we were able to safely perform proctocolectomy after the 
patient had fully recovered at 3 months after LDLT.
Te second challenge was the indication of LT with 
concurrent nonhepatic malignancy. Kosai-Fujimoto et  al. 
reported that there was no signifcant diference in survival 
after LDLT for patients with and without nonhepatic malignancy, including nine concurrent cases [20]. Tey concluded that elective resection was successful if the tumors 
were at an exceedingly early stage. Te UC-associated colorectal cancer patients had a prognosis that was similar to 
that of sporadic colorectal cancer at an early stage [9–11]. 
In our case, colon cancer was pathologically diagnosed as 
TisN0M0 stage 0; therefore, the prognosis was expected 
to be similar to that of sporadic colon cancer, which has a 
chance of recurrence-free survival without additional treatment of>90% according to the Japanese Society for Cancer 
of the Colon and Rectum [12]. With UC, the incidence of 
poorly diferentiated cancer with multiple developments 
is reportedly higher than that of cases without UC; this is 
one of the reasons why proctocolectomy is recommended 
[9–11, 13]. In the current case, because we did not fnd any 
evidence of poor diferentiation characteristics in the colon 
tumor, we performed careful patient follow-up with minimal immunosuppression and planned to perform proctocolectomy as soon as possible after LDLT. We selected ileal 
pouch–anal anastomosis, which has been proven to be a 
safe approach after LT, as the bowel resection procedure 
[14].
PSC recurrence after LT, which contributes to poor 
patient and graft survival, especially after LDLT, has been 
well-recognized. Egawa et  al. showed that the risk of retransplantation for graft loss due to recurrence of PSC 
after LDLT is high, and that the risk factors for recurrence 
are high MELD scores (>24), frst-degree relative donors, 
postoperative cytomegalovirus infection, and early biliary 
anastomotic complications [21]. Tese did not occur in 
this case. Concomitant IBD was not associated with recurrence in their study [21]. We have not observed any signs of 
PSC recurrence in this case; however, regular liver biopsies 
and careful follow-up must be performed to monitor for 
recurrence.
Conclusions
With strict patient selection and careful patient management and follow-up, elective proctocolectomy may be a 
safe and efective procedure after LDLT for concurrent 
early colon cancer with PSC-related UC.
