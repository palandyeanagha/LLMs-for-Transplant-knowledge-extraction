Tenofovir treatment of the severe acute
hepatitis B
Key words: Acute hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus. Jaundice.
Dear Editor,
The pharmacological treatment of the acute hepatitis B has
become increasingly important over the last 10 years due to the
fact that the infection is still an important public health problem
and one of the main causes of acute liver failure in our environment. However, there are only a few studies about this subject
and most of them are conducted with lamivudine with a low
methodological quality (1-5). This is the reason why we submit
this clinical case of severe acute hepatitis B treated with tenofovir
which presented a good clinical evolution. The major clinical
practice guidelines (6,7) currently recommend the antiviral treatment of severe acute hepatitis B, as it may reduce the mortality
and the risk of acute liver failure in this kind of patients (5).
Case report
A fifty-five-year-old male, with no medical history, seeks medical consultation after five days of asthenia, hyporexia, jaundice
of the skin and eyes, choleretic urine and hypocolic stools. In the
urgent analysis, there is a strong presence of cytolisis (AST 1720
UI/dL, ALT 2660 UI/dL), hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin
20.94 mg/dL) and coagulopathy (prothrombin activity, 45%; INR,
1.79). HBV serologies turned out to be positive (HBsAg +, antiHBc IgM + and AgHBe +). The serologies of the HCV, HDV
and HIV turned out to be negative.
In the presence of severe acute liver failure, it is decided to
use a specific treatment for the acute hepatitis B with tenofovir
245 mg/24 hours from the first day of the hospital admission.
The patient remained hospitalized for a period of 14 days,
without having hepatic encephalopathy or any external signs of
bleeding at any moment. The analytical figures started to
improve from the day number 7 of the antiviral treatment. Subsequently, the patient continued the treatment with tenofovir as
an outpatient, the anti-HBe seroconversion occurred one month
after the treatment was started and the HBsAg loss 8 weeks after
the treatment was started. After two consecutive serologies
HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive, the antiviral treatment
was suspended.
Discussion
The existing bibliography related to the treatment of the acute
hepatitis B is sparse and relatively recent. The first prospective
document dates from the year 2004, when Schmilowitz-Weiss et
al. (1) treated 15 patients with severe acute hepatitis (INR > 1.6,
bilirubin > 10 mg/dL or hepatic encephalopathy), achieving a
response rate of 86% (Table I). Subsequently, in the year 2007,
we can find the first randomised clinical trial (3), which included
a total of 71 patients with acute hepatitis B, from which 31 randomised to lamivudine for 3 months and 40 of them to placebo.
The study did not show any statistically significant differences
in any clinical or analytical parameter, not even in the subset of
47 patients with the diagnosis of severe hepatitis which the trial
included.
Finally, the most recent randomised clinical trial, conducted
by Yu et al. (5) in the year 2010, included 80 patients, who were
randomised to lamivudine and placebo, and that showed very
promising results. The group who received lamivudine presented
a lower mortality (7.5 vs. 25%) and a lower incidence of acute
liver failure (20 vs. 42.5%). The study also showed that the sooner
the treatment is initiated (the first 7 days), the better the clinical
and analytical response rate of these patients.
Despite the mixed results of the literature, it is currently
recommended the pharmacological treatment of the severe acute

hepatitis B (6,7), as it is observed the increase of patient survival
rates and the decrease ofthe risk of acute liverfailure in these patients.
It is also recommended to start the treatment assoon as possible (5).
As for the drug of choice, despite the absence of studies with
tenofovir or entecavir, the major clinical practice guidelines (6,7)
recommend the use of the new antiviral drugs because of their
high power and the absence of resistances. The duration of the
treatment is not established, but the european guideline recommends the treatment for a period of at least 3 months after the
seroconversion to anti-HBs (7).
