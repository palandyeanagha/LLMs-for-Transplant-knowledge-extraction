ABSTRACT 
Vitamin E improves liver histology in non-diabetic adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH), but its impact on long-term patient outcomes is unknown. We evaluated whether vitamin E treatment improves clinical outcomes of NASH patients with bridging fibrosis or 
cirrhosis. Two hundred and thirty-six patients with biopsy-proven NASH and bridging 
fibrosis or cirrhosis seen at Indiana University Medical Center between October 2004, and 
January 2016 were included. Ninety of them took 800 IU/day of vitamin E for ≥ 2 years 
(vitamin E users) and were propensity matched to 90 adults who did not take vitamin E 
(controls) after adjusting for fibrosis severity, age, gender, body mass index, comorbidities 
and their treatment, LDL cholesterol, liver biochemistries and length of follow-up on vitamin 
E. Covariate-adjusted cox and competing risk regression models were assessed to evaluate
association between vitamin E treatment and patient outcomes. The median follow-up was
5.62 (IQR: 4.3-7.5) and 5.6 (IQR: 4-6.9) years for vitamin E users and controls respectively.

Vitamin E users had higher adjusted transplant-free survival (78% vs. 49%, P<.01) and lower 
rates of hepatic decompensation (37% vs. 62%, P=.04) than controls. After controlling for 
severity of fibrosis, calendar year of patient enrollment and other potential confounders, 
vitamin E treatment decreased the risk of death or transplant (adj. HR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.12-
0.74, P<.01) and hepatic decompensation (adj. sHR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28-0.96, P=.036). 
These benefits were evident in both diabetics as well as non-diabetics. Adjusted 10-year 
cumulative probability of HCC, vascular events and non-hepatic cancers were not different 
between vitamin E exposed and controls. Conclusion, vitamin E use was associated with 
improved clinical outcomes in patients with NASH and bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease 
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and recently has become a leading indication for liver 
transplantation in the industrialized countries.(1) The prevalence of NAFLD varies across the 
different countries, being from 20-30% in Europe and as high as 46% in the United States 
(U.S).(2, 3) The prevalence of NAFLD can also be higher in obese subjects and among 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Approximately 25% patients with NAFLD may progress 
to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 11% of NASH patients may developed cirrhosis 
within 15 years.(4) The prognosis of NAFLD is determined by the severity of hepatic 
fibrosis; patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis carry a higher risk of hepatic 
decompensation secondary to portal hypertension, HCC and death as compared with patients 
with lower stages of fibrosis.(5, 6) Currently, there are no approved pharmacological 
interventions for NASH.(7) Lifestyle measures, including dietary changes and exercise have 
important benefits on NASH, however, significant body weight reduction (>7%) is required 
to improve NASH and fibrosis, (8) which is difficult to achieve and harder to sustain over 
time.(8) Thus, there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective therapeutic options for 
patients with NASH, particularly targeting those with advanced liver fibrosis. Several drugs 
with different mechanism of actions and targets have been evaluated and/or are currently 
being tested for NASH, including vitamin E (9-12), pioglitazone (13) obeticholic acid (14), 
elafibranor (15), cenicriviroc (16), liraglutide (17) and selonsertib (18). Although most of 
them have shown clear beneficial effects on liver histology, including NASH resolution and 
fibrosis regression (surrogate markers of clinical outcomes), no efficacy data exist on longterm survival and clinical outcomes.

Oxidative stress is suspected to play an important role in the progression to NASH 
and advanced fibrosis in NAFLD patients. Previous studies have confirmed a strong 
relationship between the severity of NAFLD and degree of oxidative stress.(19) 
Epidemiological studies have reported that low plasma levels of vitamin E are not only 
associated with presence of NASH(20) but also with increased all-cause mortality among 
NAFLD patients.(21) Vitamin E (α-tocopherol) is a well-known antioxidant that can protect 
cellular structure integrity against injury from lipid peroxidation and oxygen-free radicals. 
Several randomized controlled trials (RCT) have explored the efficacy of the 
supplementation of vitamin E 800 I/U/day on liver histology and aminotransferase levels of 
patients with NASH.(9-12) In two well-designed RCT conducted in adult and pediatric 
biopsy-proven NASH, vitamin E was associated with significant improvement in NASH 
histology, although there was no significant regression in liver fibrosis as compared with the 
placebo group.(9, 11) These results prompted the American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases (AASLD) to recommend vitamin E 800 I/U/day in nondiabetic and noncirrhotic patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH.(22) We conducted a study to investigate the 
impact of the vitamin E administration on long-term clinical outcomes in patients with 
biopsy-proven NASH and advanced fibrosis followed for up to 10 years in an academic 
tertiary referral center in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study cohort 
This analysis consists of a retrospective study of all patients with biopsy-confirmed 
NASH and advanced fibrosis from October 2004 to January 2016 captured from the 
outpatient electronical medical record systems at Indiana University Medical Center, an 
academic tertiary referral center located in Indianapolis, Indiana. Patients were identified as 
having histologically-confirmed NASH with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis according to an 
algorithm of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10) 
codes (571.8, K76.0, K75.81, 571.5, K76.0, K74.0, K74.60 and K74.69) along Current 
Procedural Terminology-4 codes (50.1, 50.11, 50.12, 50.13, 50.14, 0F903ZX, 0F904ZX, 
0FB03ZX, 0F900Z, 0FB00ZX, 0FB03ZX, 0FB04ZX, 0FJ03ZZ, 47000, 47001, 47100, 
75970, 75891, 75970, 75831, 76003). Subsequent individual chart reviews confirmed their 
clinical and histological diagnosis. All patients were seen by experienced hepatologists at the 
Indiana University Hospital following referral from community physicians. At our institution, 
the liver biopsies are generally performed in patients with suspected NAFLD for persistently

increased ALT levels or high index of suspicion for NASH or advanced fibrosis. The 
decision to obtain a liver biopsy was part of standard clinical care and was made on a case by 
case basis by individual treating hepatologists. For this study, eligible patients were ≥ 18 years old with biopsy-confirmed NASH and 
bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. The exclusion criteria were: history of decompensated cirrhosis 
(ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding or a Child-Turcotte-Pugh score ≥7) or 
presence of any event of hepatic decompensation prior to biopsy, MELD score ≥ 15 
(excluding values influenced by creatinine levels in the context of CKD), other causes of 
chronic liver diseases or secondary causes of NAFLD, known sero-positivity for HIV, type 1 
diabetes, history of significant alcohol consumption (> 20 g/day for men and > 10 g/day for 
women during the last two years), concomitant diseases with reduced life expectancy (≤ 6 
months), platelet count < 40 x 10
9
L, total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl and INR > 1.7 and 
history of bariatric surgery before study entry or during follow-up. We only included patients 
with at least one year of follow-up after their study entry to ensure adequate exposure to 
vitamin E and also for assessing any safety signals. We also excluded patients who developed 
HCC or hepatic decompensation within the first 6 months of study enrollment in order to 
reduce potential lead time and length biases
(Supplemental Table 1). 
The institutional review board at Indiana University School of Medicine granted the 
study an exemption because the data were reviewed retrospectively, and analyses were deidentified. 
Patient data
Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory and concomitant medications data were 
collected at the time of liver biopsy for both vitamin E exposed and non-exposed patients after an extensive review of all medical and laboratory records. The extracted demographic 
and clinical data included age, gender, race, body weight in kg, height, body mass index 
(kg/m

), history of comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, non-hepatic cancers) and its concurrent 
medications, self-reported alcohol consumption in the two years preceding the enrollment and 
tobacco use. Laboratory parameters, including aminotransferases, total bilirubin, serum 
albumin and creatinine, INR, platelets, fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin, serum

total and HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and alpha-fetoprotein were also 
recorded. 
Histopathologic data were extracted by two trained hepatologist investigators from the 
original liver histology reports signed by 2 experienced hepatopathologists (OC, RS) who 
were primarily involved in scoring the liver biopsies which were obtained as part of standard clinical care. Only original reports were considered in our study. The NAFLD activity score 
(NAS) and their individual components (steatosis, 0-3; lobular inflammation, 0-3 and 
ballooning, 0-2) were calculated. The severity of fibrosis was staged from 0 to 4, but only 
bridging fibrosis (stage 3) and cirrhosis (stage 4) were considered in the current analysis.(23, 
24) 
Data for 
vitamin E treatment was extracted from Medication Hub Service, which 
includes the medication issue date, dosage form, and days of supply for all medications 
dispensed by our affiliated pharmacies. Additionally, as vitamin E may be purchased overthe-counter outside our pharmacies, we captured such information through extensive review 
of each medical record. Vitamin E users were patients who consumed vitamin E (800 IU/day) 
for at least 2 years between October 2004 and January 2016. Non-vitamin E users (controls) 
were patients who did not receive a vitamin E treatment at any time throughout the study 
from October 2004, to January 2016. We identified all vitamin E prescriptions dispensed 
during follow-up to determine individuals’ treatment status. For this study purposes, vitamin 
E users were defined as those who took vitamin E for at least two years between the date of 
their first and last documented use. From our data extraction, we did not find any patients in 
the control group who received vitamin E prior to the liver biopsy or during their follow-up. 
Follow-up
The follow-up period began on the date of biopsy for both controls and vitamin E 
users. After enrolled, all patients were systematically evaluated at 6 -12 intervals up to the 
study closure date (March 31, 2018), death, liver transplantation or lost to follow-up. Patients 
lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last known follow-up. 
All patients underwent medical history along with physical examinations and laboratory tests 
at each follow-up visit. Follow-up data for outcomes were gathered from the ICD 9 and 10 
codes and medical history, and confirmed through chart review of imaging, laboratory and/or

pathological records based on the type of major event developed. All patients were regularly 
screened for HCC with cross-sectional abdominal imaging (liver ultrasound every 6 months, 
or CT or MRI every 9-12 months and alpha-fetoprotein every 6 months) and 
gastroesophageal varices according to the recommended guidelines.(25, 26) Treatment of 
liver and non-liver complications were provided according to our institutional standard of 
care and in general accordance with the practice guidelines.(25-28) 
Outcome measures 
All-cause mortality (including liver- and non-liver related) or liver transplantation was 
considered the primary outcome. Mortality ascribed to liver-related causes was defined as 
death with immediate cause from a complication of liver disease (i.e., variceal bleeding, 
hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome) or liver disease listed as a major 
contributing cause in medical chart review. Similarly, non-liver related causes were defined 
as those occurring as a direct complication of major vascular events (cardiovascular or 
cerebrovascular disease), cancers or other causes (i.e., sepsis). Secondary outcomes were defined as follows: (1) hepatic decompensation: 
development of ascites (clinically- and/or US-detected), clinically overt hepatic 
encephalopathy and gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (verified by endoscopy); (2) vascular 
events- new episode of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), myocardial infarction, stable or 
unstable angina, congestive heart failure, aneurysm dissection or cardiac arrest; (3) HCC, 
confirmed by imaging methods or liver biopsy; (4) non-hepatic malignancies other than 
HCC. Malignancies were defined as definite if a malignancy was reported on a biopsy or 
from an oncologist, radiation oncologist or hepatologist (specifically for HCC). Diagnoses of 
non-hepatic malignancies were verified using histopathology and/or cytology findings. 
Incident major vascular events were ascertained by self-report and documented by medical 
record review. 
Each initial event was recorded when first seen during follow-up, and recurrence of 
the same event or occurrence of a new event belonging to the same category was not 
considered for the analyses. Likewise, outcomes occurring after liver transplantation were not 
accounted. All study outcomes were sequentially verified by two investigators by manual 
review of the medical records, including discharge summary and results of relevant

diagnostic and laboratory tests. The second reviewer who verified the outcome events was 
blind to vitamin E exposure status during data extraction. 
Assembly of the propensity-matched cohort 
We used a 1:1 matching algorithm to match patients exposed and non-exposed to 
vitamin E.(29) A propensity-matched cohort was created using variables that were expected 
to increase the likelihood of receive vitamin E or increase the risk of overall mortality. To 
create the propensity-matched cohorts, we used logistic regression analysis, and the balance 
of covariates in our models was checked by Becker and Ichino strategies and then performed 
a nearest-number matching with a caliper of 0.01 using Leuven and Sianesi methodology.(30) 
The variables used to create the propensity score (PS) were: vitamin E as dependent variable 
and age, gender, tobacco use (current vs. former/nonsmoker), history of cardiovascular 
disease and malignancies, BMI, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, INR, total bilirubin, albumin, 
platelet count, LDL cholesterol, severity of fibrosis (bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis), use of 
antidiabetic medications, statins and aspirin, and length of follow-up after vitamin E firsttime prescription (<4, 4-6 and > 6 years) as independent covariates or predictors. Further 
details are included in the supplemental material. 
Statistical analysis 
Quantitative variables were displayed as median and its interquartile ranges, and 
categorical as number and percentage. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests 
for continuous covariates. Chi-square and McNemar’s tests for binary variables. Standardized 
differences for categorical and continuous variables were also checked in the unmatched and 
matched cohorts. Because vitamin E starting date was different among patients, vitamin E use was 
considered as a time-dependent covariate in order to avoid immortal-time bias.(31) Patients 
were coded as nonusers between liver biopsy and vitamin E initiation dates, and they were 
recoded to users on the date when vitamin E was initiated. In other words, for users, the code 
of the time-dependent covariate was 0 between the date of the liver biopsy and vitamin E 
prescription date and changed to 1 after vitamin E was started. Among patients who never 
used vitamin E, coding as nonuser was applied throughout. This method is more accurate for 
defining vitamin E exposure status since classifies the person-time of the users before their 
first prescription as the unexposed follow-up time. Time-dependent cox and competing risk

regression models were computed to calculate unadjusted and adjusted hazard and subhazard 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). 
Given that outcomes probabilities may be influenced by the severity of fibrosis 
(bridging fibrosis vs. cirrhosis) and calendar year of patient recruitment, the cumulative 
probabilities for transplant-free survival and major clinical events were always adjusted for 
these two variables. For adjusted curves, time-dependent cox regression-based tests were 
implemented to compare difference between transplant-free survival distributions, whereas 
time-dependent competing risk regression-based tests were used to compare difference 
between major clinical outcomes sub-distributions. 
The primary analysis was based on PS-matched groups. Additional sensitivity 
analyses were undertaken to corroborate the findings from our PS analyses in the unmatched 
cohort. Thus, we estimated differences in outcomes based on vitamin E use in both the PSmatched as well as the unmatched cohorts. Time-dependent cox regression models were used 
to assess association of vitamin E with transplant-free survival, whereas time-dependent 
competing risk regression models were implemented based on the method of Fine and Gray 
to evaluate association of vitamin E with major clinical outcomes (hepatic decompensation, 
HCC, vascular events and nonhepatic cancers) (see supplemental material for more 
details). To provide an optimal control for risk factors and confounders, three covariateadjusted analyses were performed, including vitamin E use as a time varying covariate, as 
described previously. Adjusted analyses were conducted including the following potential 
risk factors or confounders: age, gender, tobacco use, history of cardiovascular or 
cerebrovascular disease, LDL cholesterol, BMI, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, fibrosis 
severity, presence of esophageal varices at baseline, calendar year of patient enrollment and 
use of antidiabetic medications, statins and aspirin (model 1) or adding MELD score (model 2) or liver function tests (total bilirubin, INR, albumin and platelet count) (model 3) to the
same variables included in the model 1. Covariates were selected for the adjusted analyses
based on their biologically plausible potential to act as confounders, well-known predictors of
outcomes and variables that were significant (P<0.15) in the univariate analyses. Presence of
cirrhosis, MELD score and specific liver function tests were highly predictive of mortality
and hepatic decompensation, thereby, multivariable models were adjusted by these covariates (Supplemental Table 2).

Covariates with missing values were imputed to avoid case deletion in our PS and 
multivariable analyses. We did not find covariates with more than 10% of missing values. We 
applied a method of multiple imputations by chained equation (MICE) in which missing data 
are imputed or replaced with a set of plausible values using regression-based models. We did 
20 imputations for each missing information. A log-log survival curves and Schoenfeld 
residuals were used to check proportional hazard assumptions. The assumptions of 
proportionality were met both globally (the overall models) and individually for each 
predictor covariate. 
All testing was 2-sided, and P ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All 
analyses were conducted using Stata (version 15.0, Stata Cop, College Station, Texas, USA). 
RESULTS 
Study Cohort 
A total of 307 patients with biopsy-proven NASH with bridging fibrosis and 
compensated cirrhosis were identified during the study period, but 71 not meet our eligibility criteria were excluded from the study. Thus, a total of 236 individuals with NASH and 
bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis constituted our study cohort (Figure 1)
. Of them, 
90 were vitamin E users whereas 146 individuals did not receive vitamin E during the study 
period. The median follow-up was 6.5 (IQR: 4.6.8) years in unmatched controls. The selected 
clinical characteristics of vitamin E users and vitamin E non-users in this cohort of 236 
patients are shown in Supplemental Table 3. Propensity scoring (PS) matching resulted in well-balanced cohorts of patients on 
vitamin E (n=90) and non-exposed controls (n=90), which were comparable in all baseline 
features except for ALT, AST and LDL cholesterol median levels (Table 1). Patients were 
predominantly cirrhotic on biopsy (68% vitamin E users and 73% controls) and the majority 
had active necroinflammation on their biopsy (NAFLD Activity Score ≥4 in 68% in vitamin E 
users and 57% in controls). Since liver biopsy date, the median follow-up was 7.1 (5.4-9.5) 
years among vitamin E users and 5.62 (IQR, 4.3-7.5) years in controls. From vitamin E 
prescription date, the median follow-up was 5.6 (IQR, 4-6.9). Table 1 summarizes other 
selected baseline characteristics of vitamin E users and their PS matched controls.

Association between vitamin E use and study outcomes 
(a) All-cause mortality or transplant and hepatic decompensation rates 
The overall mortality and transplant rates were significantly lower among vitamin E 
users (10%) than their PS matched controls (33%, P<.001) (Table 2). Ten-year time-
dependent cox-model adjusted transplant-free survival rate was significantly higher among 
vitamin E users (78%) than their matched controls (49%, P<.01) (Figure 2A). In time-
dependent covariate-adjusted cox regression models, vitamin E use remained a significant 
protector against overall mortality or transplant after controlling by fibrosis severity (HR: 
0.30, 95% CI: 0.12-0.74, 
P<.01), MELD score (HR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14-0.85, P=.02) and 
liver function tests (HR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.18-0.94, P=.036) (Table 3). Vitamin E exposed 
patients showed a significant reduction of relative (70%, 95% CI: 40-85) and absolute (23%, 
95% CI: 12-35) risks of overall mortality or transplant, yielding a number needed to treat 
(NNT) of 4.28 (95% CI: 8.48-2.87). Most of vitamin E beneficial effects were observed on 
liver-related mortality or transplant (absolute risk reduction, 16%), Supplemental Table 4. 
The proportion of patients who developed an initial event of hepatic decompensation during 
follow-up was significantly lower in the vitamin E group than controls (37% vs. 62%, P=.044), while adjusting by fibrosis severity and calendar year of patient enrollment (Figure 
2B). Vitamin E treated patients had reduced risk of hepatic decompensation than controls 
after competing risk adjusted analysis by fibrosis severity (sHR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28-0.96, P.036), MELD score (sHR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29-0.98, P=.042) and liver function tests (sHR: 
0.55, 95% CI: 0.30-0.98, P=.048) (Table 3). 
 
In the entire study cohort consisting of 90 vitamin E user and 146 unmatched vitamin 
E non-users, vitamin E use was significantly associated with lower overall mortality or 
transplantation, even after adjusting for fibrosis severity, MELD score, liver function tests, and other baseline co-variates (Supplemental Table 5 and 6 and Supplemental Figure 1A). 
Similarly, vitamin E use was associated with significantly lower frequency of an initial event 
of hepatic decompensation as well as significantly lower cumulative incidence of hepatic 
decompensation, even in the competing risk analyses after adjusting for fibrosis severity, 
MELD score, liver function tests, and other baseline co-variates (Supplemental Table 5 and 6 and Supplemental Figure 1B).

(b) Development of HCC, major vascular events and non-hepatic cancers
After competing risk model adjustments by severity of fibrosis and calendar year of
patient recruitment, 10-year cumulative incidences of HCC (vitamin E users: 19% vs. 
matched controls: 20%, adj. P=.95), major vascular events (vitamin E users: 14% vs. matched 
controls: 17%, adj. P=.70) and non-hepatic cancers (vitamin E users: 8% vs. matched 
controls: 6%, adj. 
P=.74) were not different between the vitamin E users and their matched 
controls (Figures 2A-C). Likewise, in the entire study cohort consisting of 90 vitamin E user 
and 146 unmatched vitamin E non-users, the 10-year cumulative rates of HCC, major 
vascular events and non-hepatic cancers were similar between vitamin E users and their 
unmatched controls (Supplemental Figures 2A-C). 
(c) Benefits of vitamin E use and type 2 diabetes in the propensity score adjusted analyses
The significant beneficial effects of vitamin E treatment were evident among patients 
with or without type 2 diabetes. The risk of all-cause mortality or transplant was significantly 
reduced in nondiabetic (adj. HR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.74, P=.01) and diabetic (adj. HR: 0.29, 
95% CI: 0.11-0.76, 
P=.01) patients after adjustments by fibrosis severity and calendar year of 
patient recruitment (Figure 4). Similar observation was made in the unmatched cohort where 
vitamin E use was independently associated with lower overall mortality or transplant in 
diabetics (adj. HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.22-0.97, 
P=.048) as well as in nondiabetics (adj. HR: 
0.29, 95% CI: 0.08-0.89, P=.041), Supplemental Figure 3. 
(d) Change from baseline in selected laboratory tests in PS-matched groups
Table 4 summarizes change from baseline in selected baseline characteristics. 
Vitamin E users showed a marked reduction from the baseline in their mean ALT (-30.7 vs. -
11 U/L) and AST (-22.9 vs. -7.5 U/L) levels as compared with nonusers (all P<.01). Among 
unexposed patients, there was significant worsening from baseline of mean INR (0.31 vs. 
0.14), total bilirubin (0.71 vs. 0.42 mg/dl), albumin (-0.42 vs. -0.18 mg/dl) and Fib-4 (1.48 vs. 
1.12) levels as compared with vitamin E exposed patients (all P<.05). 
DISCUSSION 
In the current study, long-term vitamin E use was associated with lower rates of allcause mortality or liver transplantation and development of hepatic decompensation in 
unmatched and propensity-matched analyses after adjusting for potential confounders. Long-

term treatment with vitamin E was associated with 70% risk reduction of all-cause mortality 
or transplant, and the risk was particularly reduced for liver-related mortality or transplant 
(68%), yielding NNT of 4.18 and 6.16, respectively. Likewise, a 35% reduction in relative 
risk of hepatic decompensation rates was observed in vitamin E exposed groups compared 
with the control group, yielding a NNT of 6.43 (Supplemental Table 4). Despite of benefits 
on survival and hepatic decompensation, vitamin E was not associated with a reduced risk of 
HCC. Our data also suggest that benefits of taking vitamin E can be extended to diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NASH and advanced fibrosis. The risk of death or transplant was 
markedly reduced up to 71% and 81% in diabetic and nondiabetic vitamin E users as 
compared with nonusers, even after controlling by severity of fibrosis and calendar year of 
patient recruitment. 
 The risk of non-liver related outcomes, including development of cardiovascular or 
cerebrovascular disease and non-hepatic cancers was not higher in vitamin E users versus 
nonusers, although the number of such events was significantly lower as compared with the 
development of decompensation secondary to portal hypertension. Concerns have been raised 
about long-term safety of vitamin E exposure, particularly in high doses. It has been 
suggested that long-term exposure to vitamin E especially at doses ≥400 IU/d is associated 
with slightly increased risks of overall mortality (32), incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (33) 
and prostate cancer (34). However, the meta-analyses combining RCT designed to evaluate 
the vitamin E efficacy for prevention or treatment of CVD, did not find evidence that vitamin 
E in daily doses up to 800 I/U either increased or decreased all-cause or cardiovascularspecific mortality.(35) It is comforting that in our study we did not observe a safety signal for 
vitamin E use, but our sample size is vastly underpowered for detecting very rare safety 
signals. 
The effects of vitamin E has been extensively investigated in experimental models of 
NAFLD. In mice fed with methionine-choline-deficient diet, vitamin E supplementation 
reduced steatosis, necroinflammation and fibrosis as compared with mice controls, and these 
effects were associated with significant reduction in malondialdehyde, increase in superoxide 
dismutase activity and hepatic glutathione repletion, reduction in hepatic stellate cell 
activation, and downregulation of genes expression related to inflammation and fibrosis, such 
as TNF-α and TGF-β1.(36, 37) Beyond of antioxidant effects, vitamin E has also been 
implicated in the regulation of inflammatory response via several enzymes involved in signal

transduction as well as expression of specific genes closely related to inflammatory 
pathways, cellular trafficking and proliferation.(38, 39) The inhibition of protein kinase C by 
α-tocopherol has been associated with reduced proliferation of vascular smooth cells, 
macrophages and fibroblast as well as decreased secretion of endothelin by endothelial 
cells.(40, 41) Vitamin E is also able to downregulate genes expressions encoding for proteins 
with active participation in inflammatory response pathways (E-selectin, VCAM-1, integrin, 
IL-1b, transforming growth factor) and extracellular matrix formation and degradation 
(MMP-1 and MMP-19).(39) The above-mentioned favorable effects of vitamin E on 
inflammation, fibrosis and endothelial dysfunction may potentially explain the improvement 
in survival or hepatic decompensation rates seen in the current study. 
Our study showed that vitamin E supplementation had no effect on the primary 
prevention of HCC development, although the number of events (only 13 HCC) observed in 
our study was low. Although experimental and epidemiological studies have shown 
preventive effect of antioxidant supplements on cancer,(42) previous randomized controlled 
trials and meta-analyses have not consistently shown cancer prevention by antioxidants.(43) 
Our study has several important limitations. First of all, its retrospective and nonrandomized design is invariably less rigorous than a double blind randomized controlled trial. 
By propensity matching and controlling extensively for potential confounders, we attempted 
to minimize imbalance between two groups, but it is possible that there are unrecognized 
confounders responsible for the results we observed in this analysis. Second, in a nonrandomized study, an important question comes up to why some patients received vitamin E 
while others did not. Although there is no evidence to support treating patients with NASH 
cirrhosis or diabetics with NASH and bridging fibrosis, three busy hepatologists (out of more 
than 10) who practiced at our institution during the study period routinely offered vitamin E 
to a broad spectrum of NAFLD patients very soon after initial reports supporting vitamin E 
use have appeared in the literature. Third, as our cohort consisted of predominantly cirrhotics, 
our results may not generalize to populations with bridging fibrosis. It is possible that vitamin 
E treatment reduces mortality and hepatic outcomes for cirrhotic patients and not for bridging 
fibrosis, but we did not have sufficient sample size to examine whether the association varied 
across subgroups. Fourth, using pharmacy data to identify vitamin use is another limitation 
because it captures prescriptions and not necessarily consumption. However, most vitamin E 
users received prescriptions for prolonged periods, which may suggest actual compliance

with such prescriptions. We additionally ascertained vitamin E intake by reviewing the list of 
current medications at each visit. Since vitamin E can be also obtained over-the-counter, 
vitamin E exposure in the controls cannot be completely excluded. Fourth, as 
aforementioned, our sample size is too small to detect rare adverse effects which previously 
have been attributed to long-term use of vitamin E. Fifth, as our cohort is entirely comprised 
of Caucasians, our results may not be generalizable to other racial and ethnic groups. Finally, 
vitamin E treatment effects on study outcomes represent an association and not necessarily a 
causal effect between vitamin E exposure and survival or hepatic decompensation. Therefore, 
further RCT are necessary to confirm vitamin E treatment effects in patients with NASH and 
advanced fibrosis. Our data should provide important insights for designing goals and 
planning an adequate sample size for a future RCT. Despite these important limitations, our 
study is an important contribution to the literature because of critical dearth of data evaluating 
the utility of vitamin E or any other intervention in improving clinical outcomes of patients 
with NAFLD. In conclusion, in this non-randomized propensity-score adjusted study we observed that 800 IU/day 
vitamin E was associated with significant reduction in overall mortality and hepatic decompensation 
in both diabetics and non-diabetics patients with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis due to NASH. 
Although it is reassuring that we did not observe any safety signals associated with long term high 
dose vitamin E use, our study is very underpowered for detecting rare adverse events. These data 
urgently call for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to confirm these preliminary and 
yet very promising results.
