Abstract
The comorbidity of Crohn’s disease (CD) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is uncommon. Diagnosing such patients can be difficult, as illustrated by the following case. The combination of CD and PSC
should be considered in patients with CD who have abnormal liver function. Because patients with PSC often
present asymptomatically, all patients with CD should be screened for PSC by checking serum liver tests. Review of the literature suggests that there is an increased potential in these patients for the development of
malignancy and long-term prognosis is poor. We conclude that patients diagnosed with a combination of CD
and PSC should be managed with periodic colonoscopy, CA 19-9 investigation, early liver and bowel imaging, and liver biopsy. The treatment of CD associated with PSC remains unsatisfactory and the possibility of
liver transplantation should be considered.

Introduction
The comorbidity of Crohn’s disease (CD) and primary
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is rare, and properly diagnosing
the two together is rather difficult. The following is a case
of a 33-year-old patient diagnosed with CD associated with
PSC, and a review of the literature on this topic.
Case Report
A 33-year-old man was referred to West China Hospital
of Sichuan University for experiencing abdominal pain,
bloody diarrhea and jaundice for one year. He had been diagnosed with CD 12 years previously by colonoscopy with
multiple biopsies in local hospitals 3 times. The patient’s
colitis was managed well with sulfasalazine, steroids and
metronidazole treatment.
One year earlier, however, the patient had a relatively severe exacerbation despite maintenance with mesalamine. For
several months, he experienced intermittent fever, rectal
hemorrhage, painless jaundice, and prutitus, and weight loss
of 5 kg. He also experienced pain in his knees and elbows
for a week.
Physical examination revealed a pale, thin patient. Spider
naevi and palmar erythema were absent. There was moderate hepatomegaly with tenderness and stiffness on palpation.
Otherwise, the abdominal examination was normal. There
were no other abnormal physical findings.
Laboratory tests showed a Hgb of 56 g/dL, MCV 89 fl,
HCT 24.5%, AST 94 IU/mL, ALT 72 IUm/L, ALP 958 U/
mL, total bilirubin (TB) 117.1 μmol/L, direct bilirubin
(DBIL) 101.2 μmol/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
113 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP) 32.7 mg/dL.
Screening for the various markers of viral hepatitis (A, B,
C, CMV, EB, HS and VZ) was all negative. Non-organ specific auto-antibodies (ANAs, AMAs, AML, and anti-LKM1)
were also negative. Laboratory studies showed the presence
of the anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) (+)
and p-ANCA (+) (both 1:320). Stool cultures for pathogens
shigella, salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, halophilic bacteria, and proteus were negative.
Ulcers and inflammatory polyps were noted from the
transverse colon to the terminal ileum with a segmental pat１Department of Gastroenterology, Hainan Provincial People’s Hospital, China and ２Department of Gastroenterology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China

tern, via colonoscopy (Fig. 1). Colonic histopathology of biopsies demonstrated the inflammation involved the mucosa
and submucosa, with granulomas found supporting the diagnosis of CD (Fig. 2).
A computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan of the abdomen revealed intrahepatic biliary dilatation and moderate
hepatomegaly. A liver biopsy revealed the presence of a
moderate portal and lobular plasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate with slight porto-portal and periductular fibrosis, along
with an onion skin appearance and moderate ductular proliferation (Fig. 3). The suspected diagnosis of PSC was also
confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP revealed stenosis of the intrahepatic bile
ducts and multiple cystic expansions leading to an irregular
string of beads appearance, considering cholangitis (Fig. 4).
The patient was treated with ursodeoxycholic acid
(UDCA) and mesalamine with good response. He was discharged one month later without symptoms. After three
months, his serum liver tests were normal.
Discussion
PSC is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by
both intrahepatic and extrahepatic inflammation and fibrosis,
frequently leading to biliary cirrhosis and hepatic failure.
Based on the findings of a high frequency of HLA-B8 and
HLA-DR3, along with common immune alterations in these
patients, PSC is believed to be caused by genetic and immunologic factors (1, 2). Although PSC is also considered to
be one of the hepatobiliary complications of CD, this entity
is very uncommon. To the best of our knowledge, only 15
other cases of CD associated with PSC have been reported
in the English language literature since the first case report
completed by Atkinson and Carroll in 1964 (3) (Table). The
percentage of CD patients with PSC has recently been estimated to be as high as 3.4%, and may be more prevalent
than once thought (4).
CD associated with PSC occurs predominantly in middleaged males, with a mean age of 39 years (range 20-40). The
ratio of male to female patients is 2:1. The age of the onset
of symptoms is younger than it is in general PSC patients (5). It is generally seen in patients who have extensive
colonic disease (6). Although the pathogenesis remains unknown, a possible association between CD associated with
PSC and immunological abnormalities has been suggested in
earlier reports. In fact, 8 of 16 patients, including the current
patient, displayed some immunological complications such
as alopecia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, glomerulonephritis, autoimmune pancreatitis, granulomatous pneumonitis, and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (7-12, 16, 20) (Table). The present patient also complained of a bout of transient arthritis. One case of PSC has been reported in association with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (18), indicating that HCV may trigger PSC. Possible mechanisms for the
association of PSC with CD include mucosal T cells that are
recruited to the liver in response to aberrantly expressed
endothelial-cell adhesion molecules and chemokines that are
normally restricted to the gut. This mechanism might also
explain why this disease is associated with site-specific liver

damage (21). The initiation of the immune response may be
from bacteria or other toxic metabolites entering through the
diseased bowel wall. A recent study showed that genetic risk
factors may not be involved in this association (22).
Symptoms of CD associated with PSC are vague and
nonspecific, and usually are of little value in making the diagnosis. Symptoms can vary with the stage of PSC from
none at all, to complaints of jaundice, prutitus, abdominal
pain, fever, and weight loss. Some have symptoms of portal
hypertension. About 15% to 40% of these patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Most of these patients
do not appear to have features suggestive of CD, such as
fistulas, deep ulcers, or granulomas (23). The course of PSC
is independent of CD. Bowel symptoms usually develop
several years before PSC. This independent progression is
exemplified by the development of liver disease in patients
with IBD whose colons had been surgically removed many
years previously, and also by reports of IBD developing for
the first time in patients who have undergone liver transplantation for PSC (24, 25). Histological findings from
liver biopsies were also found to be unrelated to the activity
and extent of colitis (26).
The diagnosis of PSC in patients with CD is challenging
and often delayed. Many of the symptoms related to PSC in
patients with CD are similar to other hepatobiliary manifestations of IBD. AIH and PSC may also occur within the
same individual. Such a case has been reported by Sander et
al. in 2007 (20). It remains unclear if this represents the independent occurrence of both diseases, either sequentially or
concurrently, the presence of a distinct overlap syndrome, or
different stages in the evolution of a single disease entity.
Diagnostic difficulties occur mainly in children and adults
with normal cholangiograms. Alkaline phosphatase is the
most commonly elevated serum liver enzyme, and usually
elevated significantly (3 to 5 fold). Aminotransferases (AST
and ALT) are rarely more than 5 times normal. MRCP and
endoscopic cholangiography are diagnostic, demonstrating
the diffuse multifocal strictures and dilatation giving rise to
a characteristic ‘beaded’ appearance (27).
The medical management of CD associated with PSC
treatment remains inadequate. Methotrexate (28), corticosteroids (29), cyclosporine (30), azathioprine, and 6-
mercaptopurine (31) have not been proven beneficial.
UDCA has been shown to improve liver biochemistry and
histology, but has not been shown to alter the progression
(32, 33). Infliximab therapy may be efficacious. Siemanowski and Regueiro (34) reported using infliximab in two patients with CD and PSC. Their serum liver tests improved
one month after the first infusion of infliximab. However, its
effect has not been proved by histopathology, and more evidence is required to support its routine use.
Endoscopic dilation with sphincterotomy or stenting can
improve the symptoms and liver biochemistry levels for a
small numbers of patients. However, the disease can lead to
cirrhosis and ultimately liver failure. Liver transplantation
may be considered at that time. For patients with end-stage
PSC, liver transplantation remains the only effective treatment. One report described a CD patient with PSC who had
an active terminal ileal ulcer that improved after liver transplantation (12). However, there are other reports of increased rates of colon cancer after liver transplantation (15).
It remains unclear if this is due to longstanding immunosuppressant use or confounding variables such as long duration
of disease.
The prognosis of CD associated with PSC is poor. The
median survival rate, after diagnosis and without liver transplantation is approximately 12 years with a worse survival
rate for those who were symptomatic at presentation
(24, 35). The major cause of increased mortality is the occurrence of colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatic
failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent studies have
found an increased prevalence of colonic dysplasia and cancer in patients with PSC and CD compared with those with
only CD. It is possible that there was some contribution
from the immunosuppressive therapy (10). This risk for cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma is higher in

patients with PSC associated with CD than those with PSC
alone with an estimated annual incidence of 0.5%-
1% (17, 36). Two cases with diagnosed PSC associated with
CD have been reported to have been complicated by the appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma (12, 17). Some practice guidelines have recommended that patients with PSC
and CD should have periodic CA 19-9 testing, abdominal
ultrasound examinations and annual surveillance colonoscopies with multiple random biopsies for the detection of dysplasia (37, 38).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the combination of CD and PSC is rare.
The diagnosis of PSC should be considered in patients with
CD who have abnormal serum liver tests of unknown etiology after the exclusion of common causes of hepatic damage such as viral and drug-induced hepatitis. Screening
should be done with serum liver tests on all patients with
CD, as patients with PSC often present asymptomatically.
We conclude that serum biochemical assessment of liver
damage should be performed on all patients with CD, and if
the results are abnormal, PSC should be suspected. The latter diagnosis can be confirmed by liver biopsy and cholangiography. Considering that the course of PSC is independent
of CD, both liver biopsies and cholangiograms are needed in
every patient with CD and PSC to evaluate the extent of the
disease. In cases where clinical deterioration and weight loss
are seen, early liver and bowel imaging along with liver biopsy should be performed. The long-term prognosis is poor,
making it all the more important to be vigilant. Once the diagnosis is established, periodic colonoscopic surveillance
and CA 19-9 should be completed, and possible inclusion in
a transplantation program should be considered.
The authors state that they have no Conflict of Interest (COI).
