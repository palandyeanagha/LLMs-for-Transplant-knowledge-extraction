Orthotopic liver transplantation for
Management of a Giant Liver Hemangioma:
a case report and review of literature
Hesameddin Eghlimi, Peyman Arasteh and Nazanin Azade*
Abstract
Background: Hepatic hemangioma (HH) is the most common benign tumor of the liver. In special conditions such
as rapidly growing tumors, persistent pain, hemorrhage and when pressure effect on adjacent organs exist
treatment is indicated. Surgical management is the most common treatment for HH.
Case presentation: A 38-year-old male patient was diagnosed with HH for 7 years. The initial presentation of the
mass was progressive abdominal distention causing early satiety, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, vomiting,
dysphagia and weight loss. Later, the patient developed bilateral lower extremity edema. Imaging with computed
tomography (CT scan) showed a large mass measuring 32.4*26*3.1 cm which was considered unresectable. The
patient underwent a deceased donor liver transplantation. The excised mass was 9 kg. After nine days of hospitalization
the patient was discharged in good condition. Three months later, the patient was admitted due to fever and
cytomegalovirus infection for which he received intravenous ganciclovir and was discharged. In the latest follow-up
the patient had no liver or kidney dysfunction eight months after the transplantation.
Conclusion: With appropriate patient selection, liver transplantation can be considered as a treatment option for
patients with huge HHs which are life-threatening and surgically unresectable.

Background
Hepatic Hemangioma (HH) is the most common benign
tumor of the liver. The tumor has a vascular nature and
is usually solitary and small in size. The majority of HHs
originate from the right hepatic lobe. Classically HHs
are not clinically symptomatic and are incidental findings in imaging studies [1]. No definite genetic background has been suggested for the occurrence of HH;
however few cases of familial hepatic hemangiomas have
been described in literature [2]. A well-established gender disparity with female to male ration of 5:1 is reported for the tumor [3]. Estrogen therapy and
pregnancy are the major causes promoting tumor
growth in HHs, highlighting the role of female sex hormones in the pathogenesis of the tumor [4]. Adulthood
is the usual period of presentation, with the average age
of diagnosis varying from 30 to 50 years old [5]. HH tumors are mostly asymptomatic; however larger tumors
present with abdominal discomfort and rarely cause
jaundice, high cardiac output heart failure, hemorrhage
and consumptive coagulopathy, a syndrome known as
Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (KMS). Treatment of HH is
only indicated in special cases [1, 6]. Herein, we present
a case of a 9 kg giant HH that underwent liver transplantation and evaluate existing literature.

Case presentation
A 38-year-old patient was under conservative follow-up
for a huge HH for 7 years. At the time of presentation,
the patient had noticed gradual abdominal distention
and epigastric discomfort for which he sought medical
consultation. He was previously healthy and had no significant past medical or family history of any significant
disease. Imaging with ultrasonography and abdominal 4-
phase CT scan were in favor of a hemangioma probably
originating from the fifth and eighth right liver lobe, initially measuring 12*10*1.5 cm.
At the time of diagnosis, his management plan included a biannual follow-up of the mass via imaging
studies including abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During the next 7 years
the mass was growing in size and the patient complained
of exacerbation of abdominal discomfort, early satiety,
vomiting and bilateral lower extremity edema. Due to
mass effect of the HH, he developed disturbing gastroesophageal reflux disease causing significant weight loss
and dysphagia to solid foods, for which an upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy was performed. The study revealed severe esophagitis and stricture of the lower
portion of the esophagus with hiatal hernia. The last abdominal MRI showed a heterogeneous solid mass measuring 32.4*26*3.1 cm in size originating from the right
liver lobe. The mass had displaced the right kidney
downwards and the right diaphragm upwards, however
it had not caused any pressure effect on the intra or
extra hepatic bile ducts. The IVC was also compressed,
causing venous stasis in the lower extremities (Fig. 1).
Ultrasonography of the portal system showed pressure
effect of the mass causing deviation of the portal vein
and hepatic artery to the left sub-diaphragmatic aspect
of the abdomen with mild portal hypertension and small
amount of ascitic fluid. However, he had no esophageal
varices reported in esophagoscopy. Despite the huge
mass size, the patient did not develop KMS and had a
relatively normal liver function test until the transplantation, which was as followed: AST = 45 IU/L (normal
range: 5–42 IU/L), ALT = 34 IU/L (normal range: 5–37
IU/L), ALP = 256 IU/L (normal range: 50–275 IU/L) with
total and direct bilirubin of 0.9 mg/DL (normal range 0–1
mg/DL) and 0.3 mg/DL (normal range: 0–0.35 mg/DL);
respectively. He also had a platelet count of 256.000 (normal range: 141.000–356.000) and prothrombin time of
15.6 (normal range: 11–12.5) seconds. His echocardiography was also normal with an ejection fraction of 55%.
Later, due to patient’s extreme discomfort and risk of
rupture and hemorrhage, a multi-disciplinary team decided to put the patient on the liver transplant waiting
list. After 12 months, the patient underwent whole organ
liver transplantation using a cadaver graft. During laparotomy, numerous collateral abdominal veins and approximately 400 cc of ascitic fluid were observed.
The native liver was dissected using a traditional hepatectomy technique and the estimated bleeding during
hepatectomy was 1000 cc. Duct to duct anastomosis was
done with 1000 cc bleeding after reperfusion. Fluid
transfusion during surgery included 2500 cc of crystalloid fluid and 20 mg of albumin before and after
declamping. He also received a transfusion of 4 units of
packed red blood cells during the operation. The surgery
lasted for 330 min and the patient was transferred to the
intensive care unit with no acute complication. The
explanted liver weighed 9 kg (Fig. 2).
During pathologic examination, serial sections showed
multiple infiltrative masses with spongy microcystic surface occupying the whole liver (Fig. 3a).
Microscopic examination revealed dilated vascular
spaces, located between hepatocytes, lined by endothelial
cells and containing red blood vessels. There was no significant atypia (Fig. 3b).
Patient was discharged after 9 days with an immunosuppressive regimen of Tacrolimus (Prograf® 2 mg
Q12H) and Mycophenolate (Myfortic® 360 mg Q12H).

Three months post-surgery, the patient was admitted
with fever and had a positive PCR for cytomegalovirus.
During admission the patient was given intravenous gancyclovir (Valcyte® 350 mg Q24H, 10 days) and was discharged after a 7 day admission period with good
conditions.
Discussion and conclusion
Hepatic hemangioma (HH) is a common benign liver
neoplasm. Due to different prognosis and complications
of liver masses, HH should be differentiated from other
benign or malignant lesions using various imaging modalities and other diagnostic methods [7]. Most HHs remain asymptomatic during a persons’ lifetime and
usually do not have the potential for malignant transformation. Considering these, most HHs do not require
medical intervention and annual or biannual imaging
follow-up is sufficient in the majority of cases. Treatment is only indicated for rapidly growing tumors,
persistent pain, hemorrhage and when pressure effect on
adjacent organs and vessels exists, which may results in
symptoms such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, jaundice and
lower extremity edema. KMS is also an indication to
seek treatment, the syndrome is characterized by
thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy and microangiopathic
hemolytic anemia [1]. Spontaneous or trauma induced
bleeding from the tumor, is a rare but potentially fatal
complication of HH which needs emergent laparotomy
[6].
Up to this date, no medication has been proposed as a
definite choice for medical treatment of HH. Some previous studies have reported promising results with medical management of HHs using bevacizumab, sorafenib,
interferon and combination of sirulimus with high dose
propranolol, however more studies are needed to support these findings [8–11].
In rare cases, patients with huge HH undergo liver
transplantation. Indications for liver transplantation include huge masses compromising liver function, KMS
and inoperable life threatening huge masses [12]. Up to
this date and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, 20
liver transplantation for huge HH have been reported in
15 studies, using both living and deceased donor liver
transplantation [13–27]. The youngest patient was a 4
week old infant [15] and the oldest to have liver transplantation was 51 years old [27]. Most transplants have
been done due to KMS (n = 9) [13–16, 20–22, 24, 25].
Other causes included diffuse mass or rapid growth with
imminent rupture (n = 4) [19, 21, 23, 26], respiratory distress (n = 4) [14, 21, 25, 26], rupture (n = 2) [16, 24],
pain/discomfort (n = 3) [16, 17] and bleeding (n = 1)
[17]. A summary of existing literature is presented in
Table 1.
Currently the most common treatment approach, especially with huge HHs is surgical intervention. Treatment options for huge cavernous HHs include surgical
resection, transcatheter angiographic embolization

(TAE), radiofrequency ablation, radiotherapy and in
some cases orthotopic liver transplantation, as discussed
earlier [1]. Minimally invasive techniques have been
more frequently applied in recent years. The TAE
method is done via catheterization of femoral artery and
getting access to the hepatic artery to discover the tumor’s feeding arteries. The feeding arteries are then
embolized by using an embolic agent. Arterial
embolization is usually left for tumors with a definite arterial supply and is usually indicated prior to surgical resection of inoperable lesions to reduce the tumor’s size,
facilitating the surgery [28]. Successful treatment of HH
with TAE without surgery has also been reported [29].
Radiofrequency ablation uses high frequency current
passing through an electrode which creates a small area
of heat targeting the lesion. This method is either
applied percutaneously or via laparoscopy and laparotomy. For most cases, significant symptom relief is
achieved by RF-ablation. Due to difficult application of
radiofrequency ablation technique for lesions larger than
10 cm, patients with larger HH tumors do not efficiently
benefit from this method [30, 31]. Radiotherapy is a less
frequently applied method for management of HH [32].
Surgical treatment of HH is considered for patients
with severe symptoms affecting lifestyle, those suspicious
of malignancy and huge tumors as they have an increased risk of rupture and bleeding [6]. Yet the optimal
surgical approach still remains to be controversial. Surgeons may consider either segmental resection or enucleation of the tumor based on the location of the lesion.
One meta-analysis conducted in 2016 reported that
tumor tissue removal by both techniques can be safe

and efficient; however due to decreased amount of intraoperative bleeding and a better preservation of normal
hepatic tissue the enucleation method is the preferred
surgical procedure [33].
