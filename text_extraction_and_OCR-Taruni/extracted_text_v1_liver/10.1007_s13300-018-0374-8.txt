ABSTRACT
Post-liver transplantation diabetes mellitus (PLTDM) develops in up to 30% of liver
transplant recipients and is associated with
increased risk of mortality and multiple morbid
outcomes. PLTDM is a multicausal disorder, but
the main risk factor is the use of immunosuppressive agents of the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)
family (tacrolimus and cyclosporine). Additional
factors, such as pre-transplant overweight,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatitis C virus
infection, may further increase risk of developing
PLTDM. A diagnosis of PLTDM should be established only after doses of CNI and steroids are
stable and the post-operative stress has been
overcome. The predominant defect induced by
CNI is insulin secretory dysfunction. Plasma glucose control must start immediately after the
transplant procedure in order to improve longterm results for both patient and transplant.
Among the better known antidiabetics, metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors have a particularly
benign profile in the PLTDM context and are the
preferred oral agents for long-term management.
Insulin therapy is also an effective approach that
addresses the prevailing pathophysiological
defect of the disorder. There is still insufficient
evidence about the impact of newer families of
antidiabetics (GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors)
on PLTDM. In this review, we summarize current
knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis,
course of disease and medical management of
PLTDM.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of transplantation as a treatment for many types of organ failure is on the
rise. In the USA alone, 33,610 transplant procedures were performed in 2016 and 28,748
were reported to the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) from January to November
2017 [1]. Liver is the second most commonly
transplanted organ, representing 23.3% of all
transplant procedures [1].
According to the European Liver Transplant
Registry, which included more than 93,000 liver

transplants (LT) between 1968 and 2009, the
most frequent indication for LT is cirrhosis
secondary to viral hepatitis or alcohol abuse.
After cirrhosis, the most frequent indications
are primary liver tumors and cholestatic disease
(primary biliary cirrhosis or extra hepatic biliary
atresia) [2]. The survival rate of LT patients has
improved drastically in recent years, reaching
nearly 85% at 1 year and 73% at 5 years in the
European registry. The respective rates in the
USA are 88% and 70% [3]. The rate of 1-year
graft survival currently reaches 80–90% in the
USA and Europe and is close to 70% in Brazil
and other Latin American countries [4, 5]. Still,
nearly 30% of deaths in LT patients are caused
by cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases
[2].
While there has been a great improvement in
the survival of LT patients, the world is experiencing a sharp increase in the prevalence of
diabetes mellitus (DM). DM is a chronic disease
characterized by high levels of plasma glucose
secondary to a deficit of insulin activity that
results in multiple metabolic disturbances.
Approximately 422 million people are known to
be affected by DM up to 2014 [6], and this figure is expected to rise worldwide as societies
become older, more obese and more sedentary
[7]. In 2012, DM caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths, most of them due to cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) [8]. DM also leads to significant
morbidity associated to chronic complications,
such as blindness, kidney failure, lower limb
amputation, stroke and non-fatal cardiovascular
events [9].
One of the most frequent complications
after liver transplantation is the development
of post-liver transplantation diabetes mellitus
(PLTDM). In addition to all the well-known
complications of DM, PLTDM is associated
with reduced graft function, increased risk of
transplant loss and worsened patient survival
[10].
PLTDM can be defined as a degree of hyperglycemia that is consistent with current definitions of DM in a patient who has received a LT.
A reliable diagnosis of PLTDM must be made
after the patient has been discharged and doses
of immunosuppressive agents have been
tapered and are stable [11].
The aim of this review is to summarize the
essential aspects of the definition, risk factors,
pathophysiology and medical management of
PLTDM. We therefore performed literature
searches in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar
and Scielo using the following terms alone, in
combination or as part of Boolean operators:
‘‘Liver transplant,’’ ‘‘hepatic transplant,’’ ‘‘transplantation,’’ ‘‘liver graft,’’ ‘‘calcineurin inhibitors,’’ ‘‘tacrolimus,’’ ‘‘cyclosporine,’’ ‘‘steroids,’’
‘‘rejection,’’ ‘‘diabetes,’’ ‘‘diabetes mellitus,’’
‘‘hyperglycemia,’’ ‘‘diabetes treatment,’’ ‘‘antidiabetic’’ and ‘‘insulin.’’ We also consulted the
references of prior reviews, consensus reports
and meta-analyses on post-transplant DM. We
did not have any a priori exclusion criteria
based on language or publication date.

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PLTDM
There is wide variation in the reported incidence of PLTDM in the literature. This stems
partially from a lack of consensus over the past
decades regarding an operational definition and
from the use of different criteria by different
research groups. International Consensus
Guidelines developed in 2014 [11] recommend
the use of either the World Health Organization
[12] or American Diabetes Association [13] criteria (see section Diagnosis of PLTDM). However, discrepancies in the definition of PLTDM
still persist among studies. Additionally, since
some cases of PLTDM may be transient, the
length of the follow-up and time to diagnosis
influence the overall reported incidence
[14–17]. When the incidence of PTLDM is normalized by year, studies of shorter duration
tend to report higher incidences, while longer
follow-up periods yield lower estimates
(Table 1). This difference reflects the self-resolving nature of PLTDM in a fraction of
patients. The cumulative incidence of PLTDM
522 Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543

during the first year after transplantation ranges
from 10.8 to 33%, which represents a remarkable burden to any health system, given all the
consequences detailed further in this review.
The reported average yearly incidence of
PLTDM ranges from 3.3 to 30.8% (Table 1).

Risk Factors for PLTDM
Risk factors for PLTDM can be classified into
two groups: those associated with the development of DM in the general population and
those specifically associated with increased DM
risk among LT recipients (Fig. 1).
In the first group, ‘‘classical’’ risk factors for
PLTDM with robust evidence support include
older age [16–25], male sex [17, 19, 24, 25], high
body-mass index (BMI) [19, 20, 24, 25], pretransplant impaired fasting glucose [26–28],
family history of DM [26] and African American
or Hispanic ethnicity [20, 29].
Conditions that predispose particularly to
development of DM after a LV include hepatitis
C virus (HCV) [15–20, 24, 26, 28, 30–33] or
cytomegalovirus [22, 25] infection and
immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose
corticosteroids [14, 15, 20, 24, 25, 34] or calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs; tacrolimus or cyclosporine) [16, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 35, 36].
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a strong
risk factor for the development of type 2
diabetes (T2DM) in the general population [37],
and there is no reason to believe that this
association would be any different in patients
who have received a LT.
Some less well-established determinants of
PLTDM in the recipient are statin therapy [27],
central body fat distribution prior to transplantation [32], low magnesium levels before
and 1 month after surgery [22], hyperglycemia
in the first post-transplant month [25, 36] and
stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) [ 15 days
[25].
Donor characteristics also play a key role in
predisposing or protecting from PLTDM. Factors associated with increased risk are age [
60 years [19, 20], male gender [25], computed
tomography scan- or biopsy-diagnosed liver
steatosis [14, 35] and deceased liver donor
[15, 25]. In a study of Japanese recipients of
living donor liver transplants, cholinesterase
plasma levels of \185 IU/L (as a measure of
liver function in the donor) were an independent risk factor [21].

Among the variables related to the transplant procedure itself, a cold ischemia time of[
9h [25] is detrimental. The use of induction
therapy with agents other than corticosteroids
as part of the immunosuppressive regime has
been found to be a protective factor against
PLTDM in several studies, two of which used
basiliximab, a monoclonal antibody directed to
the interleukin-2 receptor [20, 24]. Acute graft
rejection also predisposes to PLTDM
[19, 22, 24, 38], but a causal link is hard to
establish given that acute rejections are usually
treated with high doses of corticosteroids,
which induce hyperglycemia [30].
PATHOGENESIS OF PLTDM
CNIs and PLTDM
Calcineurin inhibitors are a family of highly
effective immunosuppressive drugs that have
revolutionized transplantation medicine over
the last 40 years. Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus were developed by multidisciplinary
research teams working at pharmaceutical
companies and searching for immunosuppressants with a mild profile of cytotoxic adverse
effects [39]. Cyclosporine is a hydrophobic
cyclic undecapeptide with N-methylated amino
acids that render it resistant to digestion by
gastrointestinal system proteases [40, 41].
Tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic with a
slightly better water solubility than cyclosporine. After intestinal absorption and entry into
cells, both of these CNIs bind a cytoplasmic
protein belonging to the immunophilin family:
cyclophilins in the case of cyclosporine and FKbinding protein (FKBP) in the case of tacrolimus
[41].
The cyclosporine–cyclophilin or tacrolimus–FKBP complex inhibits calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase involved in T-cell
activation and regulation via dephosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T-lymphocytes (NFAT) [42, 43]. However, calcineurin and
NFAT are relevant not only in immune cells but
also in many other tissues, including kidney,
heart, spleen, liver, testes, brain and pancreas
[44, 45]. In pancreatic beta-cells, calcineurin
promotes the transcription of survival factors
and stimulates the growth and expansion of the
beta-cell mass [46]. Calcineurin is also involved
in metabolic signaling pathways in adipose [47]
and skeletal muscle tissue [48]. Widespread
inhibition of calcineurin by CNIs during
immunosuppressive therapy [45] may therefore
interfere with its action in all these tissues and
lead to potential metabolic side effects (Fig. 2).
The mechanistic factors by which CNIs
contribute to the development of PLTDM are
diverse and include deregulation of insulin
secretion, apoptosis of insulin-producing beta
cells and induction of peripheral insulin resistance. Studies in cultured beta-cells have
reported a reduction of basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after exposure to
cyclosporine, an effect less consistently found
with tacrolimus [49, 50]. In addition to the
inhibition of calcineurin [51], other targets have
been implicated in CNI-induced insulin secretory dysfunction. Of note, tacrolimus treatment
has been observed to reduce the number and
oxygen consumption of beta-cell mitochondria
in vitro, limiting the availability of ATP and
other metabolites essential for secretory pathways [52]. Similarly, studies in isolated murine
islets revealed cyclosporine-mediated inhibition
of the permeability transition pore, a mitochondrial protein important for the regulation
of cytoplasmic calcium oscillations and therefore vesicle-mediated exocytosis [53]. Tacrolimus also affects the normal closure of ATPsensitive potassium channels [54] and reduces
glucokinase (but not hexokinase) activity [55].
Experiments with reporter genes in hamster
beta cells found that CNIs suppress the transcription of genes whose promoters contain
cAMP-responsive elements [56], many of which
are essential to the survival, replication and
function of beta-cells [57, 58]. In fact, the
administration of tacrolimus to Sprague–Dawley rats negatively impacts their beta cell mass
[59]. The impact of CNIs on peripheral insulin
action does not seem to be as crucial as their
impact on beta-cells, but calcineurin inhibition
does have an effect on insulin sensitivity. When
primary human adipocytes were incubated with
high concentrations of a CNI (100 nM), the
amount and phosphorylation of key
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543 525

intermediaries of the insulin signaling pathway
(IRS1/2, p85-PI3 K, PKB, AS160, and mTORC1)
did not change [60], but the membrane content
of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) transporters
and the uptake of C14-labeled glucose did
diminish. This effect was apparently due to a
slower vesicle-to-plasma membrane recycling of
GLUT4. Finally, calcineurin inhibition seems to
promote transformation of type I skeletal muscle fibers to less insulin-sensitive type II fibers
[61] (Fig. 2).
Clinical data suggest that the impact of
specific CNIs on glucose metabolism may not be
the same. A meta-analysis of 16 studies
Fig. 2 Pathogenesis of PLTDM/diabetogenic mechanisms
of immunosuppressive drugs frequently employed in liver
transplant (LT) patients. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs)
bind to one of the immunophilins (cyclophylins in the case
of cyclosporine and FK506-binding proteins [FKBPs] in
the case of tacrolimus), which in turn inhibit calcineurin
and prevent the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated
T-cells (NFAT). As a consequence, expression of key
transcription factors involved in beta-cell survival is
reduced, including pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1
(Pdx-1), neurogenic differentiation 1 (neuroD1), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4-a) and hepatocyte
nuclear factor 1 beta (Hnf1-b). Lack of NFAT nuclear
translocation also causes a reduction in the expression of
the glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and glucokinase
(GCK) genes and in mitochondrial oxygen consumption
(VO2). In adipose tissue, less NFAT activity reduces
recycling of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and subsequently glucose uptake. In muscle tissue, blockage of
NFAT induces a phenotype switch from type I (slowtwitch) to type II (fast-twitch) fibers. Corticosteroids
(dexamethasone is used here as an example) bind to their
receptor in the cytoplasm, inducing the release of the
chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and nuclear
translocation of the glucocorticoid–receptor complex
(GRC). This complex acts as a master regulator of the
expression of multiple genes. The ultimate effects of this
transcriptional response in beta-cells entail deficient exocytosis of insulin granules and eventually apoptosis. In liver
and muscle cells, the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids impairs insulin action, resulting in less glucose
uptake, reduced glycogen synthesis and increased
gluconeogenesis
526 Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543

involving 3813 patients found a greater degree
of glucose impairment with tacrolimus than
with cyclosporine [62]. A more recent metaanalysis estimated a PTDLM risk ratio of 0.60
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47–0.77) for
cyclosporine relative to tacrolimus [63].
Corticosteroids and PLTDM
Corticosteroids continue to be part of the standard treatment for immunosuppression during
the early post-transplant period, and they are
known to promote hyperglycemia through a
host of different mechanisms. The corticosteroid dexamethasone exhibits cytotoxic [64]
and anti-proliferative [65] effects on beta-cell
lines in vitro. Also, in vitro exposure to corticosteroids impairs insulin secretion, an effect
mediated via the upregulation of serum-andglucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 and deterioration of membrane depolarization necessary
for glucose-mediated vesicle exocytosis [66].
Corticosteroids interfere with the insulin signaling pathway, thereby reducing insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis [67], GLUT4
translocation and glucose uptake in muscle
[68]. Lastly, corticosteroids increase hepatic
glucose output, further contributing to fasting
hyperglycemia [69] (Fig. 2).
Mammalian Target of Rapamycin
Inhibitors and PLTDM
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors exert their immunosuppressive action by
forming a complex with FKBP (the target of
tacrolimus) and inactivating the protein mTOR.
Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway leads
to a decrease of cytokine-mediated T-cell activation and proliferation [70]. Only everolimus is
approved by both Federal Drug Administration
(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA)
for use in LT recipients. However, sirolimus is
still used in certain LT patients [71]. The metabolic effects reported for these agents are mainly
hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia
[72, 73]. The impact of sirolimus on glucose
regulation seems to be less pronounced than
that of CNIs. A study in 23 LT patients evaluated
the impact of conversion to sirolimus after
4 weeks of CNI therapy. Three patients had
developed PLTDM after the use of CNI and had
insulin requirements between 80 and 130 IU per
day. After conversion to sirolimus, daily insulin
requirements dropped to 24–32 IU while blood
glucose levels remained stable [74]. A review of
data from 227 patients with hepatocarcinoma as
an indication for liver transplantation showed a
significantly higher incidence of PLTDM in
patients treated with tacrolimus ? mycophenolate (12.3%) versus those treated with sirolimus
(0%; p\0.001) [75].
Common Origins for Serious Liver Disease
and PLTDM
Another hypothesis to explain the high coincidence of DM and LT is that liver diseases for
which a transplant is required and DM have a
common origin. HCV is both the most common
cause of LT in the USA (affecting almost 50% of
the recipients) and a risk factor for DM: a metaanalysis showed that HCV infection increased
DM by a factor of 1.7 in both retrospective and
prospective studies [76]. HCV infection is positively associated with the homeostasis model
assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)
index in humans [77], probably due to impairment of insulin signaling in hepatocytes [78, 79].
Mice transgenic for the HCV core gene exhibit
overexpression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-a), and TNF-a-dependent insulin resistance
[80]. Similarly, alcoholic liver disease is the second-most common indication for LT [81] and a
DM risk factor: a recent dose–response metaanalysis with over 1.9 million individuals concluded that alcohol intakes of [ 120 g/day significantly increase the risk of DM [82].
NASH is another common cause of LT, and
the percentage of LT secondary to this condition
is estimated to have increased 35-fold between
2000 and 2005 in the USA [81]. NASH is strongly
associated with metabolic disturbances known to
be risk factors for DM, among which are overweight and abdominal obesity [83]. However,
NASH in and of itself is a risk factor for DM and
CVD [84], and many patients develop liver
steatosis de novo after LT [85]. Thus, there is a
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543 527

bidirectional relationship between NASH and
DM, also in the post-LT patient.
COURSE OF PLTDM
Persistence of PLTDM
Not all cases of PLTDM persist over time; some
resolve spontaneously. There is substantial disparity in the reported persistence of PLTDM
across studies, probably due to the heterogeneity
of diagnostic criteria and differences in follow-up
length [10, 14, 86, 87]. In a study of 17,184 adult
LT recipients followed for 5 years, 29.2% developed at least one episode compatible with
PLTDM, but persistence for [ 1 year was only
4.9% of the initially transplanted patients (7.6%
for recipients with NASH) [88]. Characteristics
associated with persistent PLTDM include African American race, HCV infection, NASH in the
recipient, higher MELD score and acute cellular
rejection [87, 89]. The authors of a long-term
study of renal transplantation proposed a classification according to the temporal pattern of
presentation, as follows: early-onset persistent
DM (present in the first year of transplantation
and during the next 7 years), late-onset DM
(occurring after the first year) or transient DM
(diagnosed within the first year but eventually
recovering to normal glycemia) [90]. The implications of this temporal classification on the
management, prognosis and survival of LT
recipients have not yet been established [91].
Influence of PLTDM on Clinical Outcomes
after LT
Overall Survival
In an analysis of 798 LT patients from the U.S.
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases registry, pre-LT diabetes (hazard
ratio [HR] 1.94, CI 1.40–2.68) and post-LT diabetes (HR 1.87, CI 1.41–2.48) were predictors of
death after 1 year [92]. Furthermore, in a 5-year
follow-up study of deceased-donor liver transplant recipients, total mortality in patients with
persistent PLTDM was 36.5% compared to 13.9%
in those with transient PLTDM [93]. A Chinese
study of 438 LT patients free of DM before
receiving the transplant found a mean survival
of 4.2 years in recipients who developed PLTDM,
compared to 6.1 years in those without PLTDM
(p\0.001) [10]. Likewise, a study of 35,870 LT
patients from the U.S. Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients found a significant independent association between both pre-LT DM
and PLTDM and total mortality in the period
between 1994 and 2013 (p\0.001 and
p = 0.004, respectively) [94]. Nonetheless, not all
studies have found an increased mortality rate
among PLTDM patients. Data from a national
registry of LT in Taiwan revealed comparable
11-year survival rates in patients with PLTDM
and those without DM [95]. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the evidence, most studies
have documented a significant increase in total
mortality associated with PLTDM.
Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular complications are a major cause
of non-liver-related mortality after LT, representing 13–28% of all deaths [96–98]. PLTDM
has been identified as an independent predictor
of post-transplantation CVD events. The CVD
rates of patients after a LT were evaluated in a
retrospective analysis of the Organ Procurement
and Transplantation Network/UNOS database.
A comparison of patients with persistent
PLTDM, transient PLTDM, pre-LT DM or LT
without DM, respectively, revealed that those
with persistent PLTDM exhibited the highest
risk (HR 1.95 vs. non-DM; p\0.01) [87]. DM at
1 year after LT is much more frequent among
recipients who develop CVD events than
among those who do not (64 vs. 38%; p\0.001)
[99]. Therefore, the occurrence of PLTDM in LT
recipients puts this group in a special condition
of cardiovascular vulnerability.
Acute Rejection and Graft Failure
In a small single-center matched case–control
study, PLTDM was associated with higher rates
of acute rejection, but not with long-term graft
failure [100]. Yet in a larger, multicenter
prospective study, patients with PLTDM showed
528 Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543

increased risk for graft failure [93]. PLTDM is
also linked to a higher number of rejection
episodes [101]. Data from a large U.S. cohort
showed that pre-transplant DM, PLTDM and
acute rejection were significantly associated
with increased risks for graft failure. However,
after multivariate Cox regression adjustment,
the association between PLTDM and adverse
outcomes did not persist [102]. An important
consideration is that the impact of PLTDM on
survival of the transplanted organ may be
underestimated: patients with PLTDM may
develop rejection, graft failure and subsequent
death. In these patients, however, the only
recorded outcome is mortality. Due to these
complexities, it is not possible based on current
evidence to ascertain whether or not PLTDM
has an independent effect on the risk of graft
rejection or failure.
Infections and Other Complications
In addition to the above-mentioned adverse
outcomes, PLTDM patients also have a significantly higher incidence of renal insufficiency
and post-operative bacterial infection [10]. In a
study of adults who required LT due to HCV
infection in the USA, patients with PLTDM
developed more HCV recurrences (59%) and
stage 2 fibrosis than both patients with pre-LT
DM and normal patients [103]. A similar study
in the UK found PLTDM to be a strong independent risk factor for the development of a
fibrosis score of C 4 over a 6-year follow-up (HR
3.28; p = 0.004) [104]. In summary, infections
and infection-related complications [26] seem
to be higher in patients with PLTDM.
DIAGNOSIS OF PLTDM
In general, diagnostic criteria for PLTDM are the
same as those for diabetes in the general population. Because postprandial hyperglycemia is
much more prevalent than fasting hyperglycemia among LT patients [105], the ideal
screening test for PLTDM is the oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) [106]. Due to blood losses
associated with the transplant, to preexisting
anemia due to impaired renal function, and
especially to a lack of evidence concerning its
use in the early post-transplant period, HbA1c is
not recommended as a first-line diagnostic test
for PLTDM [100]. A fasting plasma glucose level
of\100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L) is considered to be
normal, 100–125 mg/dL (5.5–6.9 mmol/L) is
considered to be impaired fasting glucose (IFG)
and C 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) constitutes diabetes. A 2-h post-OGTT plasma glucose level of
\ 140 mg/dL (7.7 mmol/L) is considered to be
normal, 140–199 mg/dL (7.7–11.1 mmol/L) is
considered to be impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT) and C 200 mg/dL (11.2 mmol/L) constitutes diabetes. The importance of diagnosing
the pre-diabetic states (IFG and IGT) in the postLT context lies in their relevance as predictors of
future PLTDM risk.
PREVENTION OF PLTDM
As in the general population, lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of PLTDM prevention in LT recipients. The positive association
between post-transplant BMI increment and
risk of subsequent DM [107] justifies advising
weight loss to LT recipients, although this
should not be encouraged immediately after
surgery to avoid a negative effect on wound
healing [106]. Exercise or an increase in daily
life physical activity should also be recommended [106]. These measures should be stressed in patients in whom risk factors for PLTDM
are identified [11].
An international consensus recommended
screening for post-transplant DM using postprandial glycemia and HbA1c, especially in
patients at high risk [11]. The consensus also
established that there is insufficient evidence to
recommend oral antidiabetic agents for prevention in patients with impaired glucose tolerance [11].
MANAGEMENT OF PLTDM
Importance of Early Glycemic Control
A retrospective review of 184 LT recipients
showed that strict intraoperative glycemic
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543 529

control (\150 mg/dL; actual mean glucose
135 mg/dL) results in a remarkably lower 1-year
mortality compared with less strict control
(C 150 mg/dL; actual mean glucose 184 mg/dL)
(8.8 vs 21.9%; p = 0.05) [108]. In the same
report, patients in the less strict group experienced a cumulative infection rate of 48%,
compared to 30% to those in the tighter control
group (p = 0.02) [108]. In a separate study in a
tertiary care transplantation center, the attainment of a perioperative blood glucose level that
was lower by 31 mg/dL was accompanied by a
significant reduction in infection rates in LT
patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.22, 95% CI
0.06–0.86) [109]. In a large case series, severe
intraoperative hyperglycemia (C 200 mg/dL)
during liver transplantation was an independent risk factor for postoperative surgical site
infection (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.26–4.03;
p = 0.006) [110].
Poor glycemic control has also been related
with longer stays the ICU on the first admission
(5.6 vs. 3.2 days; p = 0.039) [109] and prolonged
ventilation (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.28–14.4) [104].
Lastly, a retrospective review of 144 liver and
liver–kidney transplants found lower rejection
rates in patients with in-hospital average glucose levels of \200 mg/dL (35.1 vs 76.7%,
p\0.001) [111].
Immediate Post-Transplant Period
Several factors increase whole-body insulin
requirements during the early post-transplant
period, among them immunosuppression with
steroids, acute pain and surgical stress [112].
Consequently, intravenous or intensive (three
or more injections a day) insulin therapy is the
standard of care during the immediate posttransplant phase. The safety of bedside glucosebased, sliding-scale intravenous insulin
schemes in hospitalized LT recipients has been
documented [113]. Nonetheless, it should be
stressed that such schemes demand careful and
frequent glucose monitoring by nursing personnel. Once patients have returned to a regular eating pattern, they can be transitioned
into a subcutaneous basal/bolus regimen. For
patients not receiving total parenteral
nutrition, an initial total daily dose of between
0.2 and 0.4 U/Kg is reasonable, of which 50%
should be administered as basal insulin and
50% as prandial insulin. Prandial (fast or ultrafast acting insulin) is used at each meal, usually
in a fixed ratio of dietary carbohydrate to
insulin. A good initial ballpark is 1–2 U per
each 15 g carbohydrate. Supplemental doses of
fast-acting insulin should be administered
when blood glucose measurements are outside
treatment goals [114]. A practical initial
approach is to measure blood glucose every
4–6 h and to administer 1–2 U of fast-acting
insulin for every 40–50 mg/dL that the blood
glucose is above 140–150 mg/dL.
Treatment Goals
While the transplanted patient is still hospitalized, capillary glucose goals are the same as
those for other hospitalized patients:
140–180 mg/dL in the ICU, and \140 outside
the ICU for pre-meal and \180 mg/dL for 2-h
post-meal or random measurements [114]. For
the PLTDM outpatient, capillary glucose goals
are 70–110 mg/dL for pre-meal measurements
and 70–140 mg/dL for post-meal measurements. Ambulatory HbA1c goals can be defined
according to diabetes duration, presence of
comorbidities and risk of side effects associated
with antidiabetic therapy (i.e. hypoglycemia).
Thus, an HbA1c of \7% is a suitable goal for
most PLTDM patients. For patients with a short
disease duration, younger age and few comorbidities aside from their liver problems, an
HbA1c of\6.5% is both feasible and desirable.
For patients with advanced age, multiple
comorbidities, high risk of hypoglycemia and/
or limited life expectancy, an HbA1c of\8.0%
is a more realistic and potentially less iatrogenic objective. Despite a paucity of long-term
studies evaluating the impact of glycemic
control in patients with PLTDM, a study in LT
recipients with HCV infection found that
patients with tight glycemic control
(\138 mg/dL) had a lower rate of Stage 2
fibrosis development relative to patients with a
glycemic average above 138 mg/dL (78 vs. 60%;
p = 0.027) [103].
530 Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543

Other relevant treatment goals include CVD
risk factors other than glycemia, as CVD continues to be a major cause of mortality among
LT patients in general and PLTDM patients in
particular [115]. Smoking should be strongly
discouraged, and support for smoking cessation
should be provided when needed. The level of
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
should be kept at \ 100 mg/dL in PLTDM
patients without prior clinical CVD and at \
70 mg/dL in those with clinical CVD. For
patients with progressive CVD despite receiving
cholesterol-lowering therapy, an LDL cholesterol level of \55 mg/dL is recommended by
some guidelines [116]. The goal for plasma
triglycerides is \150 mg/dL. However, the
management of plasma triglycerides may be
particularly difficult in patients who receive the
mTOR inhibitors sirolimus or everolimus, as
these agents are clearly associated with marked
hypertriglyceridemia [117]. Since most PLTDM
patients will be receiving a statin for LDL
cholesterol management, it must be borne in
mind that fenofibrate is the fibrate of choice for
combined therapy with statins. Blood pressure
goals can be set according to the most recent
American Heart Association guidelines [118] to
\130/80 mmHg. Patients with PLTDM, like all
other patients with diabetes, must undergo
periodic evaluations of eye and foot care, as
they are not only at increased risk of the usual
complications of DM, but also are particularly
prone to cataracts (due to corticosteroid use)
and soft tissue infections (due to prolonged
immunosuppression).
Nonpharmacological Interventions
The 2014 international consensus guidelines on
post-transplantation DM recommend a stepwise
approach for the management of late posttransplantation DM that consists of lifestyle
modification followed by oral anti-diabetic
therapy and then insulin therapy [11]. Different
factors influence the decision of which oral antidiabetic drug should be the first choice, and
every patient should be evaluated individually.
Maintenance of caloric balance and control
of body weight are essential components of
diabetes management. In patients with kidney
transplants, weight gain during the months
following transplantation is proportional to the
risk of new-onset diabetes, independent of the
pre-transplant BMI [119]. Also in kidney transplant recipients, a 6-month intensive lifestyle
modification program that included referral to a
dietitian, a structured exercise program and
weight loss advice induced regression to normoglycemia in up to 44% of IGT patients [120].
Randomized trials are needed in which the
overall impact of structured diet and exercise
can be specifically assessed in the PLTDM
population.
Pharmacological Interventions
Metformin
Metformin controls hyperglycemia by reducing
hepatic glucose production and improving
peripheral insulin sensitivity without weight
gain or hypoglycemia [121]. Even though metformin is the first-line treatment for T2DM
[122], its use in PLTDM is still not widely
advised due to a relative scarcity of evidence
[11]. Part of the reluctance to recommend
metformin is based on a perceived increase in
the risk of lactic acidosis associated with renal
and hepatic disease. However, the translation of
this biological plausibility into clinical outcomes has been challenged by several studies. In
a retrospective study of T2DM patients treated
with metformin, 36 patients developed liver
disease and continued to receive the medication, yet not a single one of them developed
lactic acidosis [123]. It has actually been shown
that continuation of metformin after a diagnosis of cirrhosis is a predictor of better survival
compared to discontinuation on the grounds of
hepatic disease [124]. Despite the lack of clinical
trials in LT patients, in one study there were no
cases of lactic acidosis and no decrease in
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with metformin
use in kidney transplant recipients [125].
Sulfonylureas
There are very few studies evaluating sulfonylureas (SUs) in patients with post-transplant diabetes, but their use has continued empirically
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543 531

for many years. SUs directly stimulate insulin
release by closing the ATP-dependent K? channel in pancreatic beta-cells, irrespective of concurrent plasma glucose. This mechanism may
result in hypoglycemia, weight gain [126], betacell death [127] and progressive loss of efficacy
[128]. Another significant pitfall to the use of
SUs in PLTDM is the potential for drug–drug
interactions due to shared hepatic metabolism
pathways with other medications commonly
used in this type of patient [129]. Nonetheless,
one study showed that glipizide did not alter
cyclosporine concentration in renal transplant
recipients [130]. Altogether, there is insufficient
evidence to recommend SUs as a rational treatment choice in PLTDM.
Meglitinides
Repaglinide and nateglinide induce insulin
secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Their
rapid onset and short duration of action reduces
the risk of hypoglycemia compared to the SUs
[131]. Meglitinides undergo extensive hepatic
metabolism, which may be an indication that
caution is warranted in patients with PLTDM
[129]. Nevertheless, their overall efficacy and
safety have been documented in renal transplant patients [132, 133]. In five patients with
chronic viral hepatitis, repaglinide did not
increase transaminase levels [132].
Thiazolidinediones
Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are agonists of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma (PPAR-c), a transcription factor mostly
expressed in adipose tissue. Thiazolidinediones
(TZDs) improve insulin sensitivity and lower
plasma triglycerides [134]. Two small studies in
solid organ recipients with pre- or post-transplant diabetes evaluated the efficacy and safety
of TZD [135, 136]. Both studies added a TZD to
insulin, glyburide or repaglinide treatment and
found a sizable reduction in HbA1c level
(1.2–1.3%) and insulin dose (10–40 U/day) over
8–12 months, with no changes in plasma creatinine or CNI levels. A larger study was performed with rosiglitazone in 32 liver and eight
kidney recipients with post-transplant diabetes.
Body weight and plasma creatinine and
transaminases were stable over the 26-week
follow-up. Of the 33 patients initially on insulin, 30 no longer required it at the end of the
study period. The percentage goal (HbA1c\7%)
achievement was 30% with rosiglitazone
monotherapy and 62.5% with combined
rosiglitazone ? SU therapy [137]. Despite these
encouraging results, the adverse cardiovascular
profile of rosiglitazone has prompted its withdrawal from several markets in the world [138].
Meanwhile, pioglitazone has been reported to
reduce all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial
infarction and stroke in patients with DM [139],
and it is available in many countries.
DPP-4 Inhibitors
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors prolong
the half-life of endogenous incretins (glucagonlike peptide-1 [GLP-1] and glucose-dependent
insulinotropic peptide [GIP]), resulting in an
antihyperglycemic effect [140]. Interest in DPP-4
inhibitors for the management of PTLDM has
surged in recent years, as incretins counteract the
diabetogenic actions of immunosuppressant
drugs [141]. Notably, increased levels of DPP-4
have been reported in LT patients with HCV but
not other etiologies [142].
Evidence supporting the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in post-transplant diabetes comes mainly
from kidney recipients. Linagliptin [143], vildagliptin [144] and sitagliptin [145] lower
HbA1c levels to 0.3–0.6% without significant
alterations in the GFR, immunosuppressant
levels or liver function tests. A descriptive study
of 65 kidney recipients on different DPP-4
inhibitors found linagliptin to have the greatest
effect on HbA1c and the smallest effect on
cyclosporine levels [146]. DPP-4 inhibitors have
also been used in combination with other
agents. In one study 45 kidney recipients with
diabetes on metformin were randomized to
sitagliptin or insulin glargine. After 12-weeks,
safety and efficacy were comparable between
groups, but sitagliptin was associated with
weight reduction [147].
GLP-1 Analogues
Glucagon-like peptide-1, a gastrointestinal hormone of the incretin family, possesses not only
532 Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543

antidiabetic but potentially antihypertensive,
anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and
immunomodulatory actions as well [148]. GLP1 analogues bind the GLP-1 receptor but are
resistant to DPP-4 degradation. These agents
lack hepatic metabolism and hence have limited drug–drug interactions, but they do slow
gastric emptying, potentially impairing
immunosuppressant absorption [129]. No clinical trials of GLP-1 in patients with PLTDM have
been reported. One case series of five kidney
transplant recipients with post-transplant diabetes reported the safety of liraglutide administered for 21 days, without changes in
tacrolimus levels [149]. In the same study, glucose levels at 60 and 120 min after an OGTT
were lower with liraglutide at day 21 compared
to baseline.
SGLT2 Inhibitors
The sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2
(SGLT2) mediates the reabsorption of glucose in
the proximal tubule of the nephron. SGLT2
inhibitors (‘‘gliflozins’’) induce glycosuria and
thereby reduce glycemia, body weight and
blood pressure; they also reduce cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality and slow the progression of kidney disease over the long term in
patients with T2DM [150–153]. Their use in
PLTDM is limited, as evidence of their safety in
this context is scarce. Treatment with empagliflozin in rats with tacrolimus-induced diabetes
reduced hyperglycemia and increased plasma
insulin levels and islet size; it also enhanced
glucose-induced insulin secretion in isolated
pancreatic tissue [154]. In a case series of
patients with diabetes after a heart transplant,
empagliflozin reduced weight, furosemide dose
and blood pressure, albeit changes in HbA1c
were non-significant [155]. In a group of ten
kidney recipients, canagliflozin improved glycemic control, weight and blood pressure [156].
Despite concurrent immunosuppression and
glycosuria, there were no reports of urinary tract
infections in either study.
Ambulatory Insulin Therapy
Due to the above-mentioned effects of CNI on
insulin production and secretion by beta-cells,
many patients with PLTDM require some sort of
ambulatory insulin therapy to reach glycemic
control [103, 157]. There are no randomized
trials evaluating the use of insulin for the longterm management of PLTDM compared to
other antidiabetic therapies, but a rational
conduct is to continue insulin therapy in
patients who are discharged with good glycemic
control and no hypoglycemia. Nevertheless, it is
crucial to make prompt adjustments in insulin
dose and/or timing in the early post-discharge
days, as many factors that increase insulin
requirements during hospitalization will rapidly
subside. For adjustments in basal insulin dose,
the so called 3-0-3 scheme is a safe approach
previously employed in several clinical trials
[158, 159]. If fasting capillary blood glucose
(CBG) is between 80 and 110 mg/dL, basal
insulin is kept at the current dose. If fasting
CBG is above 110 mg/dL, basal insulin dose is
increased by 3 units, if fasting CBG is below
80 mg/dL, basal insulin is reduced by 3 units. In
a patient with regular eating habits, adjustments in prandial insulin doses can be guided
by 2-h postprandial CBG measurements: if values are above 140 mg/dL, the prandial insulin
dose of the preceding meal can be increased by
1–2 units, while if values are below 70 mg/dL
the dose should be reduced by 1–2 units [160].
Impact of Immunosuppressive Regime
on PTLDM Management
Despite the advent of safer and more effective
immunosuppressive agents, steroids remain the
most commonly used therapy for the induction
and treatment of rejections, based on their
efficacy and low cost. However, steroids have a
well-recognized diabetogenic effect [161]. The
tapering or withdrawal of steroids in order to
diminish their metabolic effects is a controversial issue. In one clinical trial, 502 LT recipients
with HBV infection were randomized to one of
four steroid-minimization protocols (steroid
withdrawal after 6 months, 3 months or
14 days, or complete avoidance of steroid therapy). After 3 years of follow-up, hyperglycemia
and diabetes were significantly more frequent in
patients on the two longer protocols, without
Diabetes Ther (2018) 9:521–543 533

any difference in patient survival, graft survival
or chronic rejection among the four groups
[162]. Another randomized trial of 82 adult LT
patients found that ‘‘almost avoidance’’ of steroids (withdrawal within 24 h of receiving the
transplant) was associated with much lower
Table 2 Key concepts about post-liver transplant diabetes mellitus
Key concepts about PLTDM
What is PLTDM?
-PLTDM is any diabetes detected for the first time after a
LT, once doses of immunosuppressants are tapered and
stable
How should PLTDM be managed?
- Optimal glycemic control during the early post-operative
period is best achieved with carefully supervised, in-hospital
intensive insulin regimes. Early control has a great impact
on the long-term prognosis of transplant and patient
-Patients with PLTDM, like any patient with diabetes,
should be counseled on therapeutic lifestyle changes
-For long-term PLTDM outpatient management, there is
scarce evidence to support the choice of one antidiabetic
agent over another
-Metformin has a desirable mechanism of action in the
context of PLTDM. Risk of lactic acidosis does not seem to
be increased in LT patients
-The potential risk for drug–drug interactions and risk of
hypoglycemia make sulfonylureas not the optimal choice
for PLTDM
-Small studies have reported benefits with the use of
thiazolidinediones in PLTDM, but the availability of these
medications is limited in many parts of the world
-DPP-4 inhibitors have limited efficacy, but a good safety
record in PLTDM
-Newer families of antidiabetics (GLP-1 analogues and
SGLT2 inhibitors) have been assessed for PLTDM only in
small case series so far.
-Ambulatory insulin therapy is a feasible and effective way
of controlling PLTDM, but dose adjustments must be
done carefully and following clear, pre-established glycemic
goals.
-When adjusting immunosuppressive regimes, prevention of
rejection should take preeminence over potentially adverse
glycemic effects, which may be managed with a variety of
strategies
Why is PLTDM important?
-The number of LTs is rapidly increasing, and so is the
frequency of PLTDM.
-PLTDM impairs the survival of both graft and patient, and
increases the risk of multiple undesirable outcomes in the
short and long term
What causes PLTDM?
-Many patients develop PLTDM as a side effect of
immunosuppressive therapy. Some others develop PLTDM
because they bear the usual risk factors for type 2 diabetes.
-The main mechanism by which CNIs cause PLTDM is by
harming insulin-producing beta-cells. Glucocorticoids
precipitate PLTDM mostly by inducing insulin resistance
in target tissues

insulin requirements 1 week post-transplant
compared to a more conventional regime (20.5
vs. 39.6 Units; p\0.05) [163]. Other studies
suggest that patients with older age or HCV as a
cause for LT would specially benefit from an
early steroid withdrawal protocol [164, 165].
Further, a retrospective analysis of 330 patients
found no difference in PLTDM, hyperlipidemia
or cardiovascular events at 4 years after the LT
between patients with steroid withdrawal by
3 months or those with steroid withdrawal by
3–12 months post-procedure [166].
Of note, a recent meta-analysis of 16 clinical
trials reported that steroid avoidance or withdrawal was accompanied by increased acute
rejection (relative risk [RR] 1.33, 95% CI
1.08–1.64) and steroid-resistant rejection (RR
2.14, 95% CI 1.13–4.02), while achieving only a
modest reduction in the risk of PLTDM (RR
0.81, 95% CI 0.66–0.99). These results clearly
illustrate that glycemic control should not
jeopardize patient and graft survival [167]. That
does not mean, however, that steroids should
be used liberally: one study assessed the impact
of reducing the methylprednisolone dose from
10–15 mg per day to 5 mg per day during the
first year in renal transplant recipients and
found positive effects on insulin sensitivity
[168]. Unfortunately, the optimal steroid dose
needed to achieve a balance between prevention of LT rejection episodes and avoidance of
glycemic impairment is still unknown.
Concerning CNIs, tapering of tacrolimus
may have a positive effect on glucose tolerance
[169, 170], but there are no trials directly aimed
at assessing the influence of different CNI dosing regimens on glycemic control in PLTDM. A
few trials have assessed metabolic outcomes
after the change in treatment regimen from
tacrolimus to cyclosporine, reporting
notable benefits [171, 172]. Whether persistence
of PLTDM is a sufficient indication for a change
of immunosuppressant is still not well
established.
CONCLUSION
Post-liver transplant diabetes mellitus is a frequent condition with potentially disastrous
consequences. PLTDM should be screened for,
timely diagnosed and intensively managed.
Clinicians in charge of caring for LT recipients
should bear in mind key concepts about PLTDM
(Table 2).
