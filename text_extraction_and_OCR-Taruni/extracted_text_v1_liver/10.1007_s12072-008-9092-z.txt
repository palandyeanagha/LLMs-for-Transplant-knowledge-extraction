Abstract Biliary complications of living donor liver
transplantation remain common. The complications of
biliary leakage and stricture result in substantial recipient
morbidity. A major focus of liver transplantation research
is the prevention and reduction of these complications
through identification of the multiple factors that are conducive to them. Such factors include the donor bile duct
anatomy and quality, and the techniques of donor hepatectomy, recipient hepatectomy, and ductal reconstruction.
A low threshold for re-exploration for possible bile leakage
prevents development of uncontrolled sepsis. Return of
good graft function can usually be expected after successful early endoscopic treatment. Contingent measures of
percutaneous transhepatic dilatation and stenting, and
revision hepaticojejunostomy have to be exercised with
utmost care to avoid hepatic artery injury which may
results in graft loss.

Living donor liver transplantation
Introduction
A successful liver transplantation entails a thousand operative steps performed precisely in the correct sequence.
Last and not the least is biliary reconstruction. Biliary
complications, namely leakage and stricture, result in
substantial morbidity and potential mortality of the recipient. In deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT),
biliary anastomosis is technically easier and could usually
be accomplished in a duct-to-duct manner of the graft and
recipient common ducts. Even so, a 15–25% biliary stricture rate has been reported [1, 2]. Strictures of duct-to-duct
anastomosis are often amenable to endoscopic therapy [2–
4]. A distinct entity that results from prolonged warm
ischemia in non-heart beating donors causes diffuse
ischemic biliary injury and manifests as multiple intrahepatic ductal strictures and abscesses [5]. This condition is
not only prevalent (40%) in recipients of non-heart beating
donors, half of them are not amenable to endoscopic
treatments [6, 7].
Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has a higher
incidence of biliary complications than DDLT. The
reported complication rate is up to 30% [8–11] and does
not seem to improve significantly with experience [12].
Thus, it remains a major focus of research aiming to
minimize long-term morbidity. In this synopsis on biliary
complications of LDLT, we focus on the technical issues of
biliary anastomosis, underlying surgical anatomy and
biology. Technical faults that lead to biliary complications
are discussed.
Standard techniques
Donor hepatectomy
The goal of donor hepatectomy is to obtain a large enough
liver graft of good quality for successful implantation in the
recipient and to leave behind a remnant liver of adequate
size for uneventful recovery of the donor. The recipient will
require a liver graft of more than 35% [13] of the estimated

standard liver volume [14], whereas the donor needs to have
a remnant liver of at least 30% of the total liver volume [15].
Unless the donor has a body size substantially larger than
the recipient, the left liver, which is usually only 33% of the
total liver volume, is inadequate in size for the recipient.
Therefore, the right liver graft is often required and has
become the workhorse of adult LDLT.
Although donor right hepatectomy including the middle
hepatic vein has been described elsewhere [16], in the
context of biliary complications, the approach to the right
hepatic duct (RHD) deserves a more detailed description.
An operative cholangiogram (OC) is obtained by instillation of undiluted contrast agent via an Fr3.5 Argyle catheter
in the common bile duct inserted through the cystic duct. To
avoid damaging aberrant sectoral branches of the RHD, the
cystic duct is not cannulated before the entire gallbladder is
detached from the gallbladder fossa. The peritoneum on the
right side of the common hepatic duct is released by sharp
dissection. The lower border of the RHD often then comes
into view. The planned division line of the RHD 3–4 mm
away from the ductal bifurcation is marked with a large
Liga clip (Ethicon Ltd, Edinburgh, UK). The first OC is then
performed (Fig. 1a). A marking is made with diathermy on
the liver surface with reference to the Liga clip as appeared
on the OC. The portion of right hepatic artery on entering
the liver should not be denuded to preserve small twigs
supplying the RHD. Liver transection is then executed using
the Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) (Valley
Lab, Boulder, CO) along the Cantlie line and onto the left of
the middle hepatic vein. At the liver hilum, it is headed
toward the marking on the liver of the RHD planned division line.
The arterial [17] and venous [18] vascular plexus around
the right and left hepatic ducts and common hepatic duct
should not be disrupted by overzealous application of the
CUSA. After minimal exposure of the right pedicle, a large
Liga clip is applied again at the planned line of division and
OC is performed for the second time. In the situation when
the right posterior hepatic duct arises from the left hepatic
duct, the posterior duct is also marked by another large Liga
clip (Fig. 1b). The true anteroposterior view of the liver and
bile ducts is made with the C-arm rotated to the right
(counterclockwise). Thus, the best view is made with the
ductal bifurcation close to but not yet overlapping the vertebral column. This is the true anteroposterior view of the
biliary system. With such maneuver, the right posterior
hepatic duct will move ‘‘with’’ the direction of the duct and
become more lateral, hence the parallax technique.
After confirming that the planned line of division is
optimal, the RHD within the pedicle is then severed with
scissors. This is made in a plane tangential to the liver
transection surface, which is much horizontal. Bleedings
from arterial branches on both severed ends of the RHD are
plicated with 6-0 Prolene. The right hepatic duct stump is
plicated with 6-0 PDS (polydioxanone) in a continuous
manner. The third OC is performed to ascertain the patency
and integrity of the main and left ductal systems (Fig. 1c).
Dilute methylene blue is also instilled gently through the
Argyle catheter to identify any site of bile leakage.
Alternative techniques for isolation and division of the
RHD have been described by other centers. Encircling of
the right pedicle prior to division may injure the right
posterior hepatic duct and caudate branches [19]. Probing
of the RHD is also practiced [20]. This additional invasive
maneuver may result in late complication of the donor from
main bile duct ischemia [21, 22]. After all, these techniques
cannot replace demonstration of the biliary anatomy by
OC.

The right liver graft once delivered from the donor is
immediately flushed with histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution (HTK) on the back table via the right portal
vein, right hepatic artery, and the RHD [23]. Utmost care is
taken in flushing the right hepatic artery because intimal
tear of the right hepatic artery results in unsalvageable
damage to the liver graft. HTK, which has lower viscosity
than University of Wisconsin solution, has the potential
advantage of more thorough flushing of the arterial supply
of the biliary system. It has been shown that the biliary
stricture rate was lower in DDLT recipients in whom the
grafts were flushed with HTK instead of University of
Wisconsin solution (17% vs. 30%, P\0.05) [24].
Recipient hepatectomy
For LDLT, total hepatectomy of the native liver requires
preservation of the inferior vena cava. There is always a
tendency to preserve a long length of the common hepatic
duct for worry of inadequate length for duct-to-duct anastomosis with the right liver graft devoid of the common
hepatic duct. However, ischemia of the recipient common
hepatic duct is a main factor for development of ischemic
biliary strictures. Since blood supply of the common hepatic
duct is from an arcade supplied from the right hepatic artery,
right and left gastric arteries, and gastroduodenal artery [25,
26], such branches ought to be preserved during recipient
hepatectomy. A group has even introduced the intrahepatic
Glissonian approach for recipient hepatectomy to maintain
vascular supply and drainage and length of the native bile
ducts [27]. However, should the right hepatic artery be
located in a very cephalic position, it becomes unpractical for
preservation of such tributaries. Blood supply is therefore
from the branches of the gastroduodenal and right gastric
arteries. While too long a common hepatic duct could only
result in relative ischemia jeopardizing anastomosis with
subsequent ischemic stricture, a short common hepatic duct
of the recipient should not prohibit duct-to-duct anastomosis.
The presence of gallstones in the recipient and a dilated
common bile duct should raise the suspicion of common
ductal stones. Choledochoscopy should be performed prior
to ductal anastomosis.
Duct-to-duct anastomosis
Duct-to-duct anastomosis is an attractive method for biliary
reconstruction because fashioning of a Roux-en-Y loop for
hepaticojejunostomy, an additional operative procedure, is
avoided, and endoscopic treatment of ductal anastomotic
stricture in the future is made feasible. In the event of bile
leakage through the anastomosis, severe sepsis from contamination of peritoneal cavity by bowel contents [10] is
also avoided.
A single RHD is most favorable for duct-to-duct anastomosis. Usually, the recipient common hepatic duct orifice is
larger than the graft RHD. Should the ratio be more than two,
reduction of the former by plication to a size slightly larger
than the RHD orifice is necessary. Matching is of the ductal
lumen instead of the outer circumference because the recipient bile duct is usually thicker and has developed varices
from portal hypertension. In the case when the right anterior
and posterior ducts are separated but not more than 3 mm
apart, duct-to-duct anastomosis is still possible. The hilar
plate tissue is incorporated into the anastomosis, otherwise
biliary leakage will occur. Conversion of two openings into
one by ductoplasty is not always advisable because suturing
results in ductal ischemia and fibrosis, resulting in stricture
formation [28]. When the distance between the two openings
is more than 3 mm, two separate hepaticojejunostomies
using the Roux-en-Y loop are advisable.
Continuous suture in principle is more prone to strangulation and ischemia of the ductal structure. However, on
the posterior wall, insertion of interrupted sutures with
knots outside the lumen is difficult. Using 6-0 PDS, the
posterior wall is reconstructed with continuous sutures
(Fig. 2a). Overzealous knot tying will either strangulate the
ductal tissue or break the suture. The anterior wall including
the corners is reconstructed with interrupted sutures
(Fig. 2b). An important factor leading to stricture is subclinical leakage of bile resulting in infection and scarring of
the anastomosis. Thus, gentle handling of the ductal tissue
and smooth passage of needle and suture is mandatory.
Stenting is not practiced as the stent itself is a foreign
body and will induce inflammation and subsequent stricture formation. Biliary stent and T-tube are independent
factors for biliary complications [29]. Only in the case
when the ductal orifice is small (e.g. 2 mm) stenting may
be the best compromise to reduce the chance of leakage
and maintain the duct anastomosis patency. An Fr3.5
Argyle tube is used and exits through the native cystic duct
if possible [24, 30]. It provides a subhepatic course and is
connected to a bag in the early postoperative period.
Subsequent cholangiogram is performed to ensure no
leakage and free flow of contrast into the duodenum. The
catheter is not removed until 10 weeks after the operation.
Hepaticojejunostomy
A lower biliary anastomotic stricture was suggested in a
study, but this is offset by many other advantages of ductto-duct anastomosis mentioned earlier [31]. Another study
in fact showed no difference in the stricture rate between
the two [28]. Indeed, there is to date no randomized study
comparing the two methods. For the single duct, duct-toduct anastomosis is preferred except in special situations,
for example, primary sclerosing cholangitis [32] and

123

Caroli’s disease [33]. When there are more than two
hepatic ducts in the graft or the distance between them is
more than 3 mm, hepaticojejunostomy becomes necessary.
The Roux-en-Y loop should have a length of 40 cm to
minimize bile reflux into the stomach causing gastritis. The
enterotomies are made by diathermy using the cutting
mode to reduce necrosis. The size of the enterotomies
should be of the same size because the ductal opening as
there is always a tendency for the jejunum to contract as a
reaction to the diathermy. The Roux-en-Y loop is brought
to the graft via a retrocolic and retrograstric route, which is
most direct. Entero-biliary anastomosis is started with the
bile duct of more difficult access. The posterior wall is
done with continuous suture and anterior wall interrupted
6-0 PDS. Mesocolic and mesenteric windows are closed
carefully with non-absorbable sutures to prevent internal
herniation of the bowel [34].
Management of biliary stricture
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
and dilatation with catheters are useful for recipients with

duct-to-duct reconstruction. The success rate of ERCP in
treating biliary stricture is high (75%) [35]. Short biliary
anastomotic strictures (Fig. 3a) are usually amenable to
dilatation by ERCP (Fig. 3b), followed by temporary
stenting. After two or more sessions of ERCP and dilatation, the stricture could be eliminated (Fig. 3c). However,
it is more difficult if the stricture is long and extends into
the graft and segregates the right anterior and posterior
hepatic ducts. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
(PTBD) becomes the alternative measure and is usually
successful [36, 37]. In the situation when the intrahepatic
ducts are not dilated and cannulation under ultrasound
guidance is difficult, the risk of injury to the hepatic artery
and portal veins is increased. Hemobilia, pseudoaneurysm
of the hepatic artery, arterioportal fistula, and portal vein
thrombosis are known complications of PTBD [38].
Therefore, the policy of a low-threshold for exploration
and revision hepaticojejunostomy is adopted. Revision
hepaticojejunostomy is a major undertaking, but it is necessary when biliary stricture is too long to improve by
repeated dilatation. In the procedure, meticulous care is
needed to avoid damage to the hepatic artery near the
biliary anastomosis. Prior PTBD that remains in situ can
guide localization of the bile duct either by fluoroscopy or
instillation of methylene blue. The bile duct may not have a
well-formed ductal mucosa but may be lined by connective
tissues. Nevertheless, the already dilated bile duct proximal
to the stricture allows a new anastomosis with the Roux-enY loop of good patency. A stent is placed across the
anastomosis and exits via a Witzel tunnel. Cholangiogram
is done through the biliary tract 6 weeks after the operation
and before removal of the stent.
Conclusion
Biliary complications remain common in both DDLT and
LDLT. Solutions to technical issues start with methodical
donor hepatectomy by precise and clean division of the
RHD while not damaging the donor main duct. Recipient
hepatectomy should not compromise the blood supply of
the common hepatic duct. Multiple ducts of the donor not
only increase the technical difficulty of biliary reconstruction, but it is also a factor for development of biliary
complications. Preoperative demonstration of the donor
biliary anatomy by imaging is feasible [39, 40]. This may
assist the surgeon in appraising the anatomy. Rarely,
multiple right hepatic ducts prohibit the use of the right
liver as a graft [41]. Whether this should be brought up as a
factor for donor evaluation is considered controversial.
Perhaps, it is only relevant when all other factors, particularly the degree of enthusiasm of the donor to donate, are
equal among multiple potential donors of a recipient.
