Abstract. Background: Invasive mucormycosis is a very aggressive fungal disease among 
immunocompromised pediatric patients caused by saprophytic fungi that belong to the order of 
the Mucorales. 
Case Report: We describe a case of of Lichtheimia corymbifera infection in a 15-year-old child 
with B-cell-Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) involving lung, kidney and thyroid that initially 
was diagnosed as probable aspergillosis delaying the effective therapy for mucormycosis. 
Conclusions: This case showed that also the intensive chemotherapy for B-NHL may represent a 
risk factor for mucormycosis infection. Liposomal amphotericin B and surgery remain the key 
tools for the successful treatment of this aggressive disease.

Introduction. Invasive mucormycosis is a very 
aggressive fungal disease among immunocompromised 
patients caused by saprophytic fungi ubiquitous in 
nature. They belong to the order of the Mucorales 
including Rhizopus species, Mucor, Lichtheimia
(previously Absidia), Cunninghamella, Rhizomucor,
Apophysomyces and Saksenaea.
1,2
In pediatric patients, the risk factors include 
hematologic malignancy, hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant (HSCT), solid organ transplant, neutropenia, 
poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, use of 
corticosteroids, prematurity and trauma.3-5
The clinical presentations are rhino cerebral, 
pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and 
disseminated disease. All clinical manifestations 
progress rapidly because of tissue angioinvasion 
leading to thrombosis and tissue necrosis.6,7 Mortality 
ranges between 22% and 59% in different reports.1,2
We describe a case of Lichtheimia corymbifera
infection in an adolescent with B-cell-Non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (B-NHL) involving lung, kidney and 
thyroid that initially was diagnosed as probable 
aspergillosis, delaying the effective therapy for 
mucormycosis. 
Case Report. A 15-year-old Caucasian boy was 
diagnosed with B-NHL involving lymph nodes, 
mediastinum and bones. The patient was treated

according to B-NHL-BFM (Berlin–Frankfurt–Munster) 
1997 protocol combined with Rituximab.8
Seven days after the fifth chemotherapy course, the 
patient was hospitalized for fever (37.9°C), severe 
cytopenia (white blood cell count 0.15 x 109/L, 
neutrophils 0 x 109/L, platelet count 23 x 109/L, Hb 96 
g/L), elevated C-reactive protein [C-RP] (92 mg/l), but 
normal procalcitonin [PCT] (0.33 ng/ml) and vital 
signs (blood pressure 124/69 mmHg, heart rate 79 
beats per minute [bpm], peripheral oxygen saturation 
[Sp02] 97%). After drawing blood cultures from 
central line and peripheral vein, an empiric antibiotic 
treatment with ceftazidime, amikacin and teicoplanin 
was promptly initiated together with granulocyte 
colony stimulating factor (GCSF), while prophylaxis 
with cotrimoxazole and fluconazole was continued. 
On day 4 tachypnea, dyspnea, hypoxemia (Sp02 80%), 
tachycardia (heart rate 150 bpm) and left hemithorax 
acute pain appeared together with an increase of CRP 
(440 mg/l) and PCT (3.13 ng/ml). On physical 
examination, lung auscultation revealed diminished 
breath sounds and rales over the left lung. The first set 
of blood cultures was negative as well as the second 
one and the blood samples for galactomannan (GM) 
and β-d-glucan (BDG) antigens. Lung computerized 
tomography (CT) showed a left extensive consolidation 
associated with pleural effusion (Figure 1). 
Considering a possible fungal origin of pneumonia 
and the profound B-lymphocytopenia, micafungin (100 
mg/day) was started and, in order to enhance the innate 
immunity, a 3-day course of intravenous IgM-enriched 
immunoglobulins was administered. On day 6 the fever 
disappeared while the neutrophils recovered over 0.5 x 
109/L. On day 7, BDG was markedly positive (> 523 
pg/ml) while GM remained negative. On day 9, high 
fever reappeared associated with edema and hyperemia 
on the left neck. A second lung CT revealed a slight 
increment of the left lung consolidation (Figure 2). A 
neck ultrasound detected a swelling lesion in left 
thyroid lobe (19 x 19 mm) and an abdomen ultrasound 
found a nodule in the middle-superior part of the right 
kidney (25 x 22 mm). This nodular lesions, as well as 
the lung one, were intensely hypermetabolic on 
positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan proving 
to have probably the same infectious origin. We 
performed a needle aspiration of the thyroid lesion 
showing only the presence of a suppurative process. 
Blood cultures and serum GM were again negative 
whereas serum BDG value returned into normal range.
The antifungal therapy was enhanced adding 
voriconazole to micafungin, while the antibiotic 
therapy was modified introducing metronidazole and 
replacing ceftazidime and amikacin with meropenem. 
Despite this, the fever persisted with a CRP rising to 
425.8 mg/L on day 11. On day 17 the patient 
underwent a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) that 
resulted negative for bacteria, fungi, Mycobacterium

61 mm) at the lower lobe of the left lung associated with pleural 
effusion.

tuberculosis, GM and BDG antigen.
The patient continued to experience evening fever 
peaks and cough. On day 32 we repeated a CT scan 
showing unaltered the left lung consolidations and the 
left thyroid lobe lesion and an increase of the multiple 
nodules at the right kidney. These radiological findings
were discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting with 
radiologists, infectivologists and pediatric 
hematologists discovering that the main lung lesion 
was presenting the reverse halo sign from the 
beginning. Given the lack of improvement and the 
severe clinical conditions, on day 36 the patient 
underwent left superior lung lobectomy. No 
postoperative complications were observed and the 
patient was discharged home 13 days later. The 
histopathological examination was consistent with a 
fungal pneumonia for the presence of hyphae. The 
identification of fungal DNA was performed by 
sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 
domain of the rDNA gene and D1-D2 region of 
ribosomal sub-unites, according to the method 
described by White et al.9that revealed the presence of 
Lichtheimia corymbifera (Figure 3). Therefore, the 
patient

suspended voriconazole and received antifungal 
therapy with liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg three 
times a week) and posaconazole (3 x 200 mg/d) for 7 
weeks. 
Six days after discharge home the patient developed 
low grade fever (37.5°C), painful increase and 
hyperemia of the left emithyroid (60 x 50 mm), 
increased of CRP 125 mg/l and PCT 0.13 ng/ml) with 
normal blood count. The patient underwent an urgent 
hemithyroidectomy with surgical drainage with rapid 
clinical improvement. The cultural search for bacteria, 
fungi and Mycobacteria resulted negative. 
The patient continued a secondary prophylaxis with 
posaconazole (3 x 200 mg/day) for 18 months. A lung 
CT, performed 6 months after surgery, showed only 
postoperative changes whereas the renal lesion 
disappeared after 12 months of posaconazole treatment. 
Discussion. This case of pulmonary mucormycosis 
presents two important characteristics for the clinicians. 
First, it shows that mucormycosis may occur also in a 
patient with a low risk profile. In fact, mucormycosis is 
a rare complication in patients with non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma.10 Single cases of mucormycosis have been 
reported in patients that received immunosuppressive 
drug or high dose of steroids and rituximab for 
autoimmune disease or renal transplant.11 This patient 
received 5 courses of immunochemotherapy where 
rituximab (375 mg/m2) was combined with high-dose 
chemotherapy containing dexamethasone (5 x 20 
mg/m2/day) and anti-cancer drugs that cause often a 
profound neutropenia, severe mucositis, and/or 
enteritis. 
Second, the radiological investigation showed from 
the beginning, when the patient was neutropenic, the 
presence of the reverse halo sign that was not pointed 
out initially by the radiologist and described instead 
only as lung consolidation. In fact, recent guidelines 
recommended strongly the search of halo sign in 
patients who are neutropenic or underwent 
hematopoietic or solid organ transplantations, together 
with the number of nodular lesions and the presence of 
pleural effusion, to make the differential diagnosis with 
other fungal infections.12,13 The reverse halo sign can 
be found in several type of infectious pneumonia 
(bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, and Pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia) and in different non-infectious 
lung diseases (lymphomatoid granulomatosis, radiation 
pneumonitis). 
A recent study on 70 patients found that the reverse 
halo sign was secondary to an infectious bacterial or 
fungal cause in 66% of patients with hematological 
malignancy or who underwent stem cell transplantation 
while it was associated with a non-infectious cause in 
70% of patients who underwent a solid organ 
transplantation. Interestingly, the reverse halo sign was 
not so specific for mucormycosis because it was 
described in 20% of patients with aspergillosis and 
19% of patients with mucormycosis. The 
characteristics of halo sign, significantly associated 
with an infectious cause, are the presence of 
neutropenia, the rim thickness, the central glass 
attenuation and the pleural effusions.14 All these 
radiological characteristics were present in the case 
described but they were initially misinterpreted as 
possible aspergillosis. The initial clinical response and 
the positivity of the BDG antigen assay contributed to 
address the clinical suspicion toward aspergillosis 
instead of another type of fungal infection. BDG assay 
can be found positive in different fungal or bacterial 
infections, whereas it is usually absent in 
cryptococcosis and mucormycosis. On the other hand, 
in mucormycosis by Rhizopus spp, BDG antigen assay 
can be positive.15 BDG antigen assay has been added 
to the EORTC/MSG criteria for the diagnosis of 
invasive fungal infections but the data in pediatric 
populations are limited.16 In our case, the transient high 
positivity for serum BDG antigen was interpreted as a 
false-positive, secondary to the administration of 
polyvalent IgM-enriched immunoglobulins. 
In the first days of infection, the treatment was 
based on empirical antibiotic and antifungal treatment. 
The addition of micafungin was directed to cover the 
patient for Candida and Aspergillus and the high value 
of BDG antigen reinforced this therapeutic choice. 
Considering that BDG antigen assay cannot indicate 
the etiology of the infection and the presence of the 
reverse halo sign, we agreed retrospectively that the 
addition of liposomal amphotericin B would have been 
more indicated. Biopsy should be pursued as soon as 
possible, because the identification by histopathology, 
culture, and molecular tests lead to earlier initiation of 
antifungal therapy.6,13
The first-line medical treatment of mucormycosis is 
liposomal Amphotericin B (L-AmB) at the daily dose 
of 5-7.5 mg/kg or the combination of L-AmB with 
triazoles.6,7,17

Surgery is essential in the treatment of 
mucormycosis, and the highest levels of therapeutic 
success have been achieved when surgery was 
combined with medical management especially in 
pulmonary lesions.13
Conclusions. In conclusion, this case showed that also 
intensive chemotherapy for B-NHL may represent a 
risk factor for mucormycosis infection. Liposomal 
amphotericin B and surgery are key tools for a 
successful treatment of mucormycosis.
