Abstract
Purpose To investigate whether the World Health Organization Safety Surgical Checklist (SSC) is an efective tool to reduce 
complications in spinal surgery.
Methods We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and radiological charts prospectively collected from patients who underwent a spinal surgery procedure from January 2010 to December 2012. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence 
of complications between two periods, from January to December 2010 (without checklist) and from January 2011 and 
December 2012 (with checklist), in order to assess the checklist’s efectiveness.
Results The sample size was 917 patients with an average of 30-month follow-up. The mean age was 52.88 years. The 
majority of procedures were performed for oncological diseases (54.4%) and degenerative diseases (39.8%). In total, 159 
complications were detected (17.3%). The overall incidence of complications for trauma, infectious pathology, oncology, 
and degenerative disease was 22.2%, 19.2%, 18.4%, and 15.3%, respectively. No correlation was observed between the type 
of pathology and the complication incidence. We observed a reduction in the overall incidence of complications following 
the introduction of the SSC: In 2010 without checklist, the incidence of complications was 24.2%, while in 2011 and 2012, 
following the checklist introduction, the incidence of complications was 16.7% and 11.7%, respectively (mean 14.2%).
Conclusions The SSC seems to be an efective tool to reduce complications in spinal surgery. We propose to extend the use of 
checklist system also to the preoperative and postoperative phases in order to further reduce the incidence of complications.

period from January 2010 to December 2012. The study 
was approved by the local ethics committee. All patients at 
the time of admission were asked to sign an informed consent to prospectively collect demographic, surgical, clinical, and quality-of-life information for research purposes.
Patient selection
The inclusion criteria were surgical patients with degenerative, traumatic, infectious (hematogenous spondylodiscitis), and oncological spinal diseases, consented to participate in the study by signing the consent form. Patients 
with surgical site infections secondary to previous surgery 
were excluded from the study.
Classifcation by disease and categories 
of complications
Patients were classifed according to the spine pathology 
and the diferent presentation of the complication.
According to the pathology treated, there were oncological, degenerative, traumatic, and infectious groups.
Complications were divided into seven categories:
1. postsurgical hematoma
2. surgical site infection
3. cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) leakage or fstula
4. mechanical complications (misplaced instrumentation 
and/or failure)
5. neurological complications
6. systemic complications
7. Surgery-related death
The complications’ classifcation and the patients’ inclusion into the categories were performed by independent 
investigators, i.e., non-MD clinical researchers (1 research 
nurse and 1 clinical research assistant) not directly 
involved in the care of the patients. This was done to avoid 
the bias to which surgeons could be exposed in assessing 
the patients they had themselves operated on.
Intervention: intraoperative checklist
An intraoperative checklist (Safety Surgical Checklist), 
elaborated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 
Introduction
The defnition of complication in spinal surgery is currently 
not clear. It varies greatly both in diferent literature reports 
and between diferent surgical specialties [1–6]. Dindo and 
Clavien [4] defned a surgical complication as “any deviation from the ideal postoperative course that is not inherent 
to the procedure and does not comprise a failure to cure.” 
Unfortunately, this defnition is not universally adopted. The 
literature has diferent defnitions, classifcations, severity 
scales, and methods of identifcations and reporting of surgical complications, making their comparison difcult [3].
In general, the complication rate after spinal surgery 
ranges between 7 and 20% [1, 2, 7–11], while orthopedic 
surgery generally has a mean rate of complications of 5% 
[12].
Prospective studies reported a higher incidence of complications compared with that in retrospective studies, due 
to more accurate record-keeping, the absence of recall 
bias, and clear defnitions of complications [2, 7]. The rate 
of complications in spinal surgery does not appear to be 
lowered within the last 10 years, despite the well-known 
risk factors reported in the literature [9, 10, 12–17].
To face the problem of surgical complications, which is 
generally relevant in the surgical felds, an intraoperative 
checklist (Safety Surgical Checklist) was elaborated and 
released by the World Health Organization in 2008, and its 
use has been described in 2009 [18]. In our institution, the 
WHO Surgical Checklist was introduced in 2011.
In spinal surgery, many preventive measures were 
investigated to reduce complications [19–24], but there 
is no report on the efectiveness of the WHO checklist in 
reducing complications.
The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of 
the complications between the two periods, from January to December 2010 (without checklist) and from January 2011 and December 2012 (with checklist), in order to 
assess the checklist’s efectiveness.
Methods
Study design
A retrospective and single center study was carried out of 
patients who underwent spinal surgery during the 3-year

2008, was introduced for the frst time in our center in 
2011.
The intraoperative checklist starts 1 h before the skin incision and fnishes at the end of the surgery. It is composed of 
19 items, performed before induction of anesthesia, before 
skin incision, and before the patient leaves the operating 
room (Fig. 1). These items allow the surgeons and the medical staf to be aware of diferent critical points.
We registered the complications arising from 2010 to 
2012, assessing the possible diferences before and after 
the checklist’s introduction.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS v21.0 (SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Mean values and standard deviations 
(SD) were calculated for continuous variables, which were 
compared between groups by using heteroscedastic twotailed Student’s t tests. Categorical variables were analyzed 
using a Pearson’s two-tailed Chi-squared test. A p value 
<0.05 was considered statistically signifcant.
Results
Sample size and demography
The sample size studied was 917 patients with a mean follow-up time of 30 months, ranging from 12 to 48 months. 
The mean age was 52.9  years old, ranging from 3 to 
93 years, with similar distribution by gender. The majority of procedures were performed for oncological pathologies (499; 54.5%) and degenerative diseases (363; 39.7%). 
Table 1 summarizes patients’ demographic data. Patients 
treated in 2010 without the use of the WHO checklist were 
285, while patients treated in 2011 and 2012 with the use of 
WHO checklist were 632.
Incidence of complications
There were complications in 107 patients (11.6%) over 917 
spinal surgery procedures performed, with 159 (17.3%) complications overall. The incidence of overall complications 
for trauma, infectious pathology, oncology, and degenerative 
disease was 22.2%, 19.2, 18.4%, and 15.3%, respectively.

No correlation was observed between the type of pathology and the incidence of complications (p = 0.48). The 
most frequent complications were wound infection (5.5%), 
mechanical complications (4.4%), and neurological injury 
(3.2%). Considering that almost 95% of the patients analyzed 
were afected by oncologic and degenerative diseases [864 
patients (94.22%) vs. 53 patients (5.78%) afected by traumatic and infectious diseases], we compared the incidence 
of complications in these two groups, observing a trend to a 
higher wound infection complications (7.4%) in oncologic 
patients, while a trend to a higher rate of mechanical complications (5.8%) was observed in patients with degenerative diseases, even in the absence of statistical diference 
(p=0.12). The incidence of complications according to 
diagnosis and operation period is summarized in Table 2 and 
represented in Figs. 2 and 3. In the period analyzed, early 
complications (arising within 1 month after surgery) were 
43.3% globally of all complications (Fig. 4). Moreover, 7.6% 
of 917 interventions required a surgical revision due to postoperative complications and 2.4% of 917 interventions had 
neurological sequelae involving permanent damage (Fig. 5).
Efcacy of the intervention
We observed a reduction in the overall incidence of complications following the introduction of the WHO Safety 
Surgical Checklist: In 2010, the incidence of complications 
was 24.2% without the checklist, while in 2011 and 2012, 
following the introduction of the checklist, the incidence 
of complications was 16.7% and 11.7%, respectively (mean 
14.2%) (p<0.0005).
Discussion
Spinal surgery complications are still a relevant and 
unsolved problem. The incidence of complications in spinal 
surgery literature ranges between 7 and 20% [1, 2, 7–11]. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the World 
Health Organization (WHO) Safety Surgical Checklist is an 
efective tool to reduce complications in spine surgery. In 
our study population, a reduction in the overall incidence 
of complications has been observed following the introduction of the WHO Safety Surgical Checklist: In 2010, without the use of the checklist, the incidence of complications

was 24.2%, while in 2011 and 2012, following the checklist 
introduction, the incidence of complications was 16.7% and 
11.7%, respectively (mean 14.2%) (p<0.0005).
We faced two aspects of spinal surgery complications: (1) 
the collection and classifcation; (2) the use of preventive 
measures to improve safety.
Collection and classifcation of spinal surgery 
complications
Nasser et al. [7] performed a systematic evidence-based 
review of 105 published studies concerning spinal surgery 
(84 retrospective, 21 prospective) and found a higher incidence of complications (19.9%) in prospective studies compared with retrospective studies (16.1%). This is secondary to the greater accuracy of record-keeping, the absence 
of recall bias, and clear defnition of complication [2, 7, 
17]. The incidence of complications varied widely in spinal 
surgery literature, even in prospective studies. Rampersaud 
et al. [3] reported an overall incidence of intraoperative 
adverse events of 14% (98 adverse events in 700 patients), 
but only 23 adverse events led to postoperative clinical 
sequelae for an overall intraoperative complication incidence 
of 3.2%, while Yadla et al. [2] reported a very high rate 
of early complications (those occurring within 30 days of 
surgery): global incidence of 53.2%, with a minor complication incidence of 46.4% and a major complication incidence 
of 21.3%.
There is no standard defnition of complications in spine 
surgery literature [3]. Diferent defnitions and classifcations 
of complications by diferent investigators make difcult to 
compare studies. The Clavien–Dindo and SAVES capture 
and grading systems [25–27] divide the severity of surgical 
complications into levels based on the grade of treatment 
required to face the complication. Complications were categorized as major or minor by Glassman et al. Signifcant 
complications requiring reoperation or leading to permanent 
defcit were considered major complications. Other general 
medical adverse events or perioperative events with timelimited efect were considered minor complications [28].
To date, few studies have evaluated the efect of complication severity on clinical outcomes [28–30]. Glassman 
et al. analyzed a prospective multicenter database for adult 
spinal deformity to explore the efects of major and minor 
complications on 1-year disability, pain, postoperative quality of life and found that major complications, although rare, 
evidently deteriorated the quality of life [28]. Fritzell et al. 
[29] found no signifcant diferences of efects of major 
and minor complications on 2-years outcomes in three different types of fusion surgery. Grainger et al. explored the

relationship between severity of complications and outcomes 
in a larger sample of patients following Clavien–Dindo classifcation of complications and found that the severity of 
perioperative surgical complications does not appear to 
infuence 1- or 2-year pain and disability outcomes [30]. 
Lambat et al. confrmed, through a large retrospective study, 
that Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at 2-year follow-up 
was not statistically diferent between patients having no 
complications, minor complications, or major complications. However, if the minimum clinically important diference (MCID) for ODI was analyzed, it resulted statistically 
signifcantly smaller in the major complication group (31%) 
than in the minor complication (51%) and no complication 
groups (65%; p<0.001) [10], demonstrating an impact of 
complications on outcome.
Chen et al. recently conducted an interesting experiment. 
They compared the complications rate among groups of 
patients undergoing spine, hip, knee, and shoulder surgery; 
the study was a 10-week prospective study where SAVES 
V2 and OrthoSAVES were used by six orthopedic surgeons 
and two independent, non-MD clinical reviewers to record 
adverse events after all elective procedures. For a spine surgeon, the frst important result of this study was the highest 
rate of complications in the spinal surgery group compared 
to the other surgeries, but the most important observation of 
this study was that overall, 99 adverse events were captured 
by the reviewers, compared with 14 captured by the surgeons

(p<0.001); surgeons adequately captured major adverse 
events, but failed to record minor events that were captured 
by the reviewers; in the spinal surgery group, reviewers captured 45 adverse events versus 8 captured by surgeons [31].
The study by Chen et al. [31] confrmed the rate of complications as a problem to be urgently faced in spinal surgery 
and highlighted the inadequate fgure of the surgeon as an 
evaluator of complications. It seems that spinal surgeons 
underestimate the complications impact on the patients 
and health system. As in a football game, the winning team 
usually maintains the best balance between the ofense and 
defense units; in comparison, surgeons probably represent a 
really good ofense unit (mission), but they lack in defense, 
where Chen’s reviewers demonstrated to be the better unit 
in that area (safety). The question to be addressed is what 
should be the frst, mission or safety? We need an independent reviewer team (defense unit) to reduce complications and 
improve safety, and in doing so, we will probably improve 
clinical outcomes as well.
In this retrospective study, we observed that the overall incidence of complications in our spine surgery center 
during 3 years was 17.3%. We divided the complications 
into seven categories: hematoma, infection, cerebrospinal 
fuid (CSF) leakage or fstula, mechanical complications, 
neurological damages, systemic complications, and surgeryrelated death. This is probably the main weakness of the 
study: As the collection of complications started using a 
non-standardized system inserted in the hospital medical 
charts, any known classifcation system (as Glassman’s, 
Clavien–Dindo’s or SAVES systems) was used [25–28]; 
this probably caused an underestimation of the number of 
complications captured.
The most frequent complications observed in the current 
study were wound infections (5.5%), mechanical complications (4.4%), and neurological damages (3.2%). In our 
study population, almost 95% of the patients were afected 
by oncologic and degenerative diseases; we observed a trend 
to a higher wound infection complications (7.4%) in oncologic patients, while a trend to a higher rate of mechanical 
complications (5.8%) was observed in patients with degenerative diseases, even in the absence of statistical diference 
(p=0.12).
This study found no correlation between diagnosis and 
overall complications’ incidence (p=0.48). This was different from other large-scale studies which report a higher 
incidence of complications in patients undergoing surgery 
for oncological pathologies [8, 9, 32, 33]. This could be 
mainly due to the long experience of the authors in tumor 
spinal surgery [34–36].
This study found a rate of early complications (arising 
within 1 month after surgery) of 43.3%, a rate of complications requiring surgical revision of 7.6%, and a rate of 
neurological sequelae causing permanent damage of 2.4%. 
These types of complications have a relevant impact on the 
health system and, especially, the last two categories on the 
patients’ quality of life and clinical outcomes.

attention on the risk factors related to the onset of complications and on predictive models of complications after spine 
surgery [12–16].
Moreover, several preventive measures have been studied and recently described in order to reduce complications 
in spine surgery, concerning intraoperative neuromonitoring, blood loss reduction, and infections and thrombosis 
prophylaxis [19–23]. Sethi et al. [24] reported their experience concerning the application of Lean methodology in 
orthopedic surgery and specifcally in spine surgery. Lean 
methodology was developed in the manufacturing industry 
to increase output and decrease costs, and then, it was implemented in many areas of health care. The authors described 
a step-by-step process designed specifcally to optimize and 
standardize preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative 
care for patients undergoing complex spine surgery, and they 
reported a signifcant reduction in overall complication rate 
[24].
In 2009, Haynes et al. [18] developed a 19-item Surgical 
Safety Checklist (SSC) to improve intraoperative outcomes 
and minimize preventable complications, thus making the 
culture of the operating theater safer, more communicative, and more collaborative. This checklist derived from an 
implementation of the Surgical Safety Checklist elaborated 
by WHO in 2008.
Although several investigators have challenged the efcacy of the SSC, it has shown repeated success in reducing 
preventable postoperative complications, length of hospital 
stay, and overall mortality [18, 37–39]. In addition, multiple 
investigators have concluded that the implementation of the 
SSC in multiple institutions has improved communication, 
efciency, and attention to routine details in the operating 
room.
In the present study, we investigated, as preventive measure to reduce complications in spinal surgery, the introduction of the WHO Safety Surgical Checklist. Results showed 
a reduction in the overall incidence of complications following the introduction of the WHO Safety Surgical Checklist: 
In 2010, without the use of the checklist, the incidence of 
complications was 24.2%, while in 2011 and 2012, following the checklist introduction, the incidence of complications was 16.7% and 11.7%, respectively (mean 14.2%) 
(p<0.0005). From our knowledge, this is the frst report 
about the application of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist 
in spinal surgery.
The only other reason that may have cooperated in the 
reduction in postoperative infections rate was the introduction in our institute of a new internal guideline for the prevention of infections in spine surgery (dated 07/20/2010) 
which has slightly changed the type of antibiotic drugs 
used for prophylaxis (one modifed drug among fve drugs 
used). However, the trend to the reduction in overall 
complications can be attributed to the introduction of the 
WHO checklist. In our experience, most of the alerts highlighted by the WHO checklist were really useful to do the 
right action in the right moment to avoid complication; in 
particular the questions contained in the Time Out section: 
Surgeon reviews: “What are the critical or unexpected 
steps, operative duration, anticipated blood loss?” and 
Anaesthesia team reviews: “Are there any patient-specifc 
concerns?”improved the surgical team interactions and 
led to changes in surgical and anesthesiological procedures during the intervention that really allowed to avoid 
complications. The other question contained in Time Out 
section “Nursing team reviews: has sterility (including 
indicator results) been confrmed? Are there equipment 
issues or any concerns?” allowed to discover, before the 
beginning of the intervention, contaminated implants or 
surgical devices, skipped from the previous control, and 
led to avoidance of postoperative infections and other 
mechanical complications.
This study presents some limitations. First, it is a retrospective study where a non-standardized system was used 
for capturing the complications; therefore, complications 
can be incorrectly estimated. Second, our department performed spinal surgery mainly for oncological and degenerative diseases. Infection and trauma surgery occupied 
only a small proportion. Hence, the current study population cannot represent the generally common spinal surgery population, and this could lead to a certain degree of 
bias in the results of the present study. In particular, the 
incidence of late complications (i.e., mechanical complications and wound infections) could be underestimated 
in the group of oncologic patients due to their shorter 
survival compared to the other groups of spine diseases. 
However, the baseline distribution of the preoperative 
diagnosis categories had about the same proportion over 
time, and late complications normally impact on the nononcologic group of patients, who represent the 45.58% of 
the study population. Third, the two groups compared were 
non-homogeneous in terms of patients’ number; patients 
treated in 2010 without the use of the WHO checklist were 
only 285, while patients treated in 2011 and 2012 with the 
use of the WHO checklist were 632.
Despite the aforementioned limitations, the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist resulted to be efective in reducing 
complications in our center. We think that a system, based 
on the Surgical Safety Checklist, should be introduced also 
during the preoperative and postoperative phases, in order 
to highlight all the specifc moments where complication 
risk factors arise also in these phases. The checklist should 
be adapted for the specifc spinal surgery characteristics. 
Finally, the introduction and validation of this checklist, 
implemented for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases, should be followed by the identifcation
