INTRODUCTION
Albendazole (Su Do Albendazole 400 mg�, Su Do Pharm,
Ind. Seoul, Korea) binds to parasite’s tubulin inhibiting its
glucose absorption. Its common adverse effects are nausea,
vomiting, constipation, thirst, dizziness, headache, hair loss
and pruritus (1). Although mainly metabolized in the liver,
abnormal liver function test is known to be a rare adverse
effect, and after prolonged administration, a mild increase
of the liver function tests has been reported. But we found
no previous reports about drug-induced hepatitis caused by
albendazole requiring admission. 
We experienced a case with a marked increase of aminotransferase levels due to albendazole ingestion. So we report
this case with a review of the literature.
CASE REPORT
A 47-yr-old male patient came to our emergency center
due to fever, chill, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and skin rash
on both forearms for 6 hr after antiparasitic drug ingestion
2 days before. He received medication for common cold at
local clinic for 2 days but showed no improvement of the
symptoms. There was no history of specific medication. He
was a social alcohol drinker and had a previous history of
admission due to unknown origin hepatitis 3 yr before at
our hospital, which the patient correlated with albendazole
ingestion. The initial vital signs were blood pressure 150/70
mmHg, heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 20/min and body
temperature 38.3℃. He had no recent history compatible
with acute hypotension or having underlying heart disease.
In the physical examination liver was not palpable, liver
percussion span was normal and there was no remarkable
finding except icteric sclerae. In laboratorial analysis WBC
was 6,790/μL (eosinophil 8.2%), hemoglobin 15.7 g/dL,
and platelet 147,000/μL showing mild increase of eosinophil
count. Prothrombin time 17.4 sec (INR 1.44), AST 5,402
IU/L, ALT 4,622 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 40 IU/L, total
bilirubin 2.8 mg/dL, r-GTP 101 IU/L, LDH 8,799 IU/L,
total protein 6.9 g/dL, albumin 4.0 g/dL, serum glucose 115
mg/dL, and BUN/Cr, 19/1.1 mg/dL. IgM anti-HAV, HBsAg,
IgM anti-HBc and anti-HCV Antibodies were negatives.
Anti-CMV, anti-EBV, and anti-HSV were also negatives.
Antinuclear antibody was weakly positive with homogeneous
pattern and anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody were negative. The level of copper (urine) was
48.40 g/day, ceruloplasmin 26.1 mg/dL, IgG 1,313.2 mg/
dL, and IgM 56.2 mg/dL showing normal values. Liver sonography showed no significant abnormality except increased
liver echogenicity. Sonography-guided liver biopsy showed
periportal invasion of inflammatory cells, cytotoxic necrosis
and different sizes of steatosis (Fig. 1, 2). We suspected druginduced hepatitis due to albendazole. And after a new interrogation of his past medical history, we knew that he had a
previous history of albendazole ingestion before hospital admission due to unknown origin toxic hepatitis 3 yr previously.
We diagnosed the patient as toxic acute hepatitis due to the

Acute Drug-Induced Hepatitis Caused by Albendazole 
Albendazole binds to parasite’s tubulin inhibiting its glucose absorption. Its common
adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, constipation, thirst, dizziness, headache, hair
loss and pruritus. Although mainly metabolized in the liver, abnormal liver function
tests were a rare adverse effect during clinical trials and we found no literature about
albendazole-induced hepatitis requiring admission. This patient had a previous
history of albendazole ingestion in 2002 resulting in increase of liver function tests.
And in 2005, the episode repeated. We evaluated the patient for viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis, but no other cause of hepatic injury
could be found. Liver biopsy showed periportal steatosis and periportal necrosis.
The initial abnormal liver function test improved only with supportive care. These
findings and the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method of the Council for
International Organizations of Medical Sciences (RUCAM/CIOMS) score of 9 are
compatible with drug-induced hepatitis so we report the case of this patient with a
review of the literature.

(CIOMS) score of 9 and performed conservative medical treatment. The patient showed rapid improvement of liver function test with AST 35 IU/L, ALT 301 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 45 IU/L and total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL on 8th day of
admission. The patient was discharged and on follow-up at the
outpatient department without significant symptoms.
DISCUSSION
Drug-induced liver injuries are reported with differences
depending of methods of analysis and diagnosis, ranging from
1 of 600 to 3,500 of all admitted patients, and 2 to 3% of
patients admitted due to drug-induced toxicity (2). Also even
some approved drugs cause hepatitis by particular reactions
with a frequency of 1 from 100,000 (3). In present days there
is an unfounded belief that alternative medicine should cause
less damage than usual medications, leading to its abuse (4).
Also in the case of antiparasitic drugs the general population frequently ingests them for prophylactic purposes. Druginduced hepatitis is defined as hepatitis caused by some medication with or without prescription. Toxic hepatitits also
includes traditional, alternative or natural medications (5).
Usually toxic and drug-induced hepatitis are classified in
direct toxic agents and idiosyncratic agents. Direct toxic
agents are those which liver injury can be predicted by its
use, has a dose-dependant nature and in most cases the time
between exposure and latent period is short. With the use of
idiosyncratic agents liver injury usually cannot be predicted
and it is not dose-dependant. But extrahepatic hypersensitivity symptoms like skin eruptions, arthralgia, fever, leukocytosis and eosinophilia appear (2). In clinical trials, treatment with albendazole has been associated with mild to
moderate elevations of hepatic enzymes in approximately
16% of patients. Although generally returned to normal
upon discontinuation of therapy, there have been case reports
of hepatitis (5). In the case of our patient the diagnosis of
drug-induced hepatitis could be established due to the history of antiparasitic agent ingestion, fever, eosinophilia, and
development of the symptoms within 12 hr since the ingestion moment.
Liver injuries are classified in 3 types: hepatocellular injury,
cholestatic and combined (6). In the present case ALT was
increased to 4,622 IU/L and ALP within normal limit being
classified as hepatocellular injury type.
For the diagnosis of toxic hepatitis there are not absolute
criteria or specific diagnosis methods. So scales with diagnostic points are utilized. The most commonly used is the
semi-qualitative Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method
of the Council for International Organizations of Medical
Sciences (RUCAM/CIOMS) scale, which correlates a causing agent and toxic liver injury and the possible results are:
‘highly probable’, ‘probable’, ‘possible’, ‘unlikely’ or ‘excluded’ based on the total score obtained (7, 8).
In this case, a rechallenge test with albendazole was not
performed because of the potential risk of severe liver injury.
Nevertheless, as symptoms appeared 6 hr after albendazole
administration, the time course and the absence of other
probable causes of acute liver damage both are suggestive of
a causative role for this drug. Also the local medication for
common cold was administered after the symptoms began
and even considering its possibility, a RUCAM/CIOMS score
9 was applied which indicated that a diagnosis of albendazole induced liver injury was ‘‘highly probable’’. Also clinical feature and laboratorial analysis improved rapidly during the past and present admission only with conservative
manages. Hepatitis A, B, and C were negatives with serum
analysis and sonography-guided liver biopsy excluded the
possibilities of autoimmune and biliary hepatitis, showing
features of acute hepatocellular hepatitis. Also hemoglobinopathy or Wilson’s disease were excluded. The past history of
the patient with previous ingestion of antiparasitic drug, the
same symptoms (fever, myalgia, and right upper abdominal

pain) and the laboratorial analysis values were similar. The
possibility of immunologic liver injury could be considered
because of fever, eosinophilia, liver biopsy and the development of the symptoms within 12 hr since the ingestion of
the drug.
Previously Morris and Smith have reported abnormalities
of liver function tests in seven patients during treatment of
40 patients for Echinococcus granulosus with oral albendazole. Six of these patients had the hepatocellular type of abnormality and one developed an obstructive jaundice (9). Jagota also reported a case of jaundice due to albendazole in a
patient with hydatid disease of the liver, who was confirmed
in a rechallenge with recurrence of hepatitis (10). In a letter
by the same author recommends an albendazole dose of 400
mg twice daily, taken with meals, for a total of 28 days. Three
such 28 days cycles may be given at 14 days intervals (11).
The actual recommended dose of albendazole for hydatid
disease patients with less than 60 kg by GlaxoSmithKline
is 15 mg/kg/day (5).
Limitations in our case are the lack of exact medical record
about antiparasitic drug ingestion 3 yr before, so we had to
depend on the patient’s memory. But, based on the previously mentioned criteria we think that the diagnosis of albendazole-induced hepatitis could be established.
We found literatures about the possible trial of steroids in
drug induced hepatitis patients with allergic symptoms.
Also in cholestatic drug induced hepatitis, ursodiol could
be of use (12, 13). Our patient presented with symptoms of
allergic reactions such as mild eosinophilia and skin rash,
but improved rapidly only with conservative manages. Also
in patients with history of previous liver disease, including
hepatic echinococcosis, appear to be more susceptible to bone
marrow suppression leading to pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and leucopenia, but our patient did
not present those signs. Albendazole should not be used in
pregnant women except in clinical circumstances where no
alternative management is appropriate (5). Long-term carcinogenicity and infertility studies in mice and rats showed
no evidence of their increased incidence but albendazole has
shown to be teratogenic in pregnant rats and rabbits (Pregnancy Category C) (5).
It’s frequent that the general population ingests antiparasitic drugs every year for prophylactic purposes which can
be bought without prescription and exact knowledge about
the drug. As presented in our case albendazole can cause
severe liver injury, so physicians must have in mind its possibilities despite of its rareness. The use of these easily accessible antiparasitic drugs for prophylactic purposes must be
contraindicated and must be consulted with a physician
about its indication. Based on this case we conclude that
during the history taking of a hepatitis patient the possible
ingestion of antiparasitic drug must be asked and further
studies and reports about albendazole induced liver injuries
are required.
