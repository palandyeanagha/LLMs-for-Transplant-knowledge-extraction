INTRODUCTION
According to global health estimates 2015 of the World Health 
Organization (WHO), approximately 1.2 million people worldwide 
die each year from cirrhosis and subsequent complications and 
800,000 die of hepatocellular carcinoma, comprising 3.5% of all 
deaths worldwide.1,2 Especially, the Asia-Pacific region accounts 
for 45% of the world’s deaths due to liver disease. As chronic liver 
disease (CLD) may develop due to a variety of etiologies including 
chronic viral infection, alcohol, and metabolic causes, the implement of population-based interventions that screen for the underlying cause and the use of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions to prevent or delay the progression to life-threatening 
cirrhosis complications and liver cancer is imperative.
The WHO recently proposed a strategic plan consisting of global 
efforts to eradicate hepatitis virus, the main cause of liver disease.3
 Despite ongoing efforts, the global burden of CLD is anticipated to increase in a generation.2
 More than 5% of all deaths 
worldwide are attributed to the harmful use of alcohol, and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) accounts for one quarter of all alcohol-related deaths.4
 Considering the increase in per capita alcohol consumption in the Asia-Pacific region,5
 the prevalence of 
ALD and its complications is expected to increase further in the 
near future. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most 
notable liver disease, has emerged as a new management subject 
as viral liver disease enters a genuine phase.6
 NAFLD is also expected to increase as the incidence of obesity increase due to 
westernized eating habits, a lack of exercise, and lifestyle changes.7
Over the past three decades, there have been great successes in 
CLD management, particularly in viral hepatitis, as well as epidemiological changes. However, data on trends in the prevalence of 
CLD in Korea are sparse. Recently, NAFLD modeling is being actively attempted to forecast the disease burden using currently 
available data.7
 A nationwide prevalence investigation would provide more accurate rates in entire population and specific subpopulations8
 for use as basic data for CLD modeling.
Accordingly, we sought to determine the current prevalence of 
CLD in Korean adults aged 19 and older and whether the prevalence changed between 1998–2001 and 2016–2017 in a representative Korean adult population data from the Korea National 
Background/Aims: Data on the trends in the prevalence of chronic liver disease (CLD) in Korea are scarce. This study 
aimed to evaluate whether the CLD prevalence changed between 1998–2001 and 2016–2017. 
Methods: Data were extracted from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1998–2001 to 2016–
2017; n=25,893). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was defined as a hepatic steatosis index >36 in the absence of 
any other evidence of CLD. The definition of alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) was excessive alcohol consumption (≥210 
g/week for men and ≥140 g/week for women) and an ALD/NAFLD index >0. 
Results: The prevalence of NAFLD increased from 18.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8–19.5%) in 1998–2001 to 
21.5% (95% CI, 20.6–22.6%) in 2016–2017. During the same time period, increases were observed in the prevalence of 
obesity (27.0 vs. 35.1%), central obesity (29.4 vs. 36.0%), diabetes (7.5 vs. 10.6%), and excessive drinking (7.3 vs. 10.5%). 
ALD prevalence also increased from 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4–4.2%) to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.4–7.6%). In contrast, chronic hepatitis 
B decreased from 5.1% (95% CI, 4.6–5.5%) to 3.4% (95% CI, 3.0–3.8%). The prevalence of chronic hepatitis C was 
approximately 0.3% in 2016–2017. 
Conclusions: The prevalence of NAFLD and ALD increase among Korean adults. Our results suggest potential targets for 
interventions to reduce the future burden of CLD. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2020;26:209-215)

Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample population
The KNHANES is a series of cross-sectional national health and 
nutrition surveys designed to provide representative prevalence 
estimates for a variety of health measures and conditions. The 
KNHANES is conducted by the Korean Centers for Disease Control. The survey design is a complex, stratified, multi-stage probability sampling of the civilian, non-institutionalized Korean population. The procedures used to select the sample as well as to 
conduct the interviews and examinations have been specified 
elsewhere.9
 This survey included an interview to obtain information concerning an individual’s health history, health behaviors, 
and risk factors. A subsequent health examination was performed 
at a mobile examination center.
Our analyses included data from 1998–2001 (KNHANES I and II) 
and 2016–2017 (KNHANES VII-1 and VII-2). We included a total of 
14,801 participants aged 19 years and older from KNHANES 
1998–2001 and 12,900 participants from KNHANES 2016–2017, 
respectively in this study. Of that number, 1,808 subjects who had 
incomplete data on NAFLD prediction model or biochemical/clinical parameters were excluded. Finally, 25,893 (14,438 in KNHANES 
1998–2001 and 11,455 in KNHANES 2016–2017) participants 
were included in the analyses. Informed consent was obtained 
from all participants, and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korean Centers for Disease Control.
Definition of CLD etiology
NAFLD was defined using the validated hepatic steatosis index 
which was calculate as 8 × alanine aminotransferase / aspartate 
aminotransferase (ALT / AST) ratio + body mass index (BMI) (+2, 
if diabetes; +2, if female)10 in the absence of any other evidence 
of CLD, such as excessive alcohol intake or a positive hepatitis B 
or hepatitis C test. From 1998–2001, since anti-hepatitis C virus 
(anti-HCV) tests were not performed in KNHANES, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) cannot be ruled out in defining NAFLD during that 
period. The optimal cut-off value for NAFLD was set at >36. In 
the subpopulation with NAFLD, the AST-to-platelet ratio index 
(APRI)11 and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4)12 were used to evaluate liver fibrosis. Their formula were as follows: APRI = [(AST / upper limit of 
normal) / platelet count (109
/L)] × 100, where the upper limits of 
normal AST levels were set at 37 IU/L for men and 29 IU/L for 
women;13 FIB-4 = age × AST / [platelets in 109
/L × (ALT)1/2]. Cutoff values for advanced fibrosis (≥F3) were set at 1 of APRI and 
2.67 of FIB-4. APRI and FIB-4 were calculated only in KNHANES 
2016–2017 due to a lack of data in the KNHANES 1998–2001. 
Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was defined as HBsAg seropositivity. 
An anti-HCV test was done only in the KNHANES 2016–2017, but 
an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was not performed. We assumed that CHC affected approximately 30% of 
those with anti-HCV positivity based on an observation in 
KNHANES 2013–2015, in which an HCV RNA PCR test showed 
that 37 individuals were HCV RNA positive among 119 subjects 
with anti-HCV positivity. The study definition of ALD was a comTable 1. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample

which was calculated as –58.5 + 0.637 (mean corpuscular volume) + 3.91 (AST/ALT) – 0.406 (BMI) + 6.35 for male gender.14
Definition of clinical parameters
Diabetes mellitus was defined based on use insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents or fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL. Participants were diagnosed as hypertensive if the systolic pressure was 
≥140 mmHg, diastolic pressure was ≥90 mmHg, or antihypertensive medication was used. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a 
cholesterol level ≥240 mg/dL. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 
≥25,15 while central obesity was defined using the thresholds for 
waist circumference (≥90 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women).16
Insulin resistance was calculated using the triglycerides and glucose index as follows: Ln [fasting glucose (mg/dL) × triglycerides 
(mg/dL) / 2).17
Data analyses
Sample weights were included in the estimation process for all 
of the analyses to reflect the differential probabilities for selection, non-response, and non-coverage.9
 All analyses were performed using Complex Samples in SPSS statistics (version 25.0; 
IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), which provides the specialized statistics for complex sample designs, such as stratified, clustered or

multistage sampling. When merging KNHANES survey cycles, appropriate selection of sampling weights and adjustment coefficients were applied according to the KNHANES guidelines.18 The 
data were presented as weighted means or weighted proportions 
with standard errors for continuous or categorical variables, respectively. Differences between the two study cycles were examined with Wald F test statistics in a general linear model for continuous variables and the Rao-Scott adjusted chi-square test for 
categorical variables.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the weighted distribution of the KNHANES 
1998–2001 and 2016–2017 samples. With the exception of 
smoking status and CHB, all clinical parameters disadvantageously changed during two decades. Compared with 1998–2001, the 
prevalence in 2016–2017 increased for obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. These unfavorable changes represented with an increased NAFLD prevalence in 2016–2017 from 18.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.8–19.5%) in 1998–2001 to 21.5% (95% 
CI, 20.6–22.6%). Along with increase in excessive drinking, the 
prevalence of ALD also increased from 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4–4.2%) 
in 1998–2001 to 7.0% (95% CI, 6.4–7.6%) in 2016–2017. In contrast, the prevalence of CHB in 2016–2017 decreased from 5.1% 
(95% CI, 4.6–5.5%) in 1998–2001 to 3.4% (95% CI, 3.0–3.8%) 
in 2016–2017. The prevalence of CHC was approximately 0.3% in 
2016–2017. Gender-specific trends in the prevalence of CLD are 
presented in Table 2. Changes in the prevalence of NAFLD, ALD, 
and CHB during the study period were evident in both genders.
Figure 1 shows the changes in the prevalence of NAFLD, ALD, 
and CHB. The increase in the prevalence of NAFLD was led by the 
20s, 30s, and 60s age groups. With the exception of the 60s 
group, increases in ALD prevalence were seen in all age strata. 
There was a sharp increase in ALD prevalence in 20s from 1.6% 
(95% CI, 1.1–2.3%) in 1998–2001 to 6.4% (95% CI, 4.9–8.3%) 
in 2016–2017. The prevalence of CHB was decreased in all age 
groups except in the 60s. In particular, the prevalence decreased 
dramatically in the 20s from 5.0% (95% CI, 4.1–6.2%) in 1998–
2001 to 1.2% (95% CI, 0.7–2.0%) in 2016–2017. A similar trend 
was observed in the 30s from 5.8% (95% CI, 5.1–6.7%) in 
1998–2001 to 3.6% (95% CI, 2.7–4.8%) in 2016–2017.
When the study sample was stratified by selected characteristics, the prevalence of NAFLD was approximately 50% among 
participants with obesity and diabetes and 30% among those 
with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in both survey cycles 
(Table 3). Among the 2,440 participants with NAFLD in 2016–
2017, the prevalence of advanced fibrosis, defined by an APRI >1 
and an FIB-4 >2.67, were 1.4% (95% CI, 0.9–2.1%) and 1.2% 
(95% CI, 0.8–1.8%), respectively. 
DISCUSSION 
The current study provides an estimate of the current and past 
prevalence of CLD in Korean adult population and demonstrates 
how the prevalence has changed over two decades using 
KNHANES surveys. The KNHANES is the only population-based 
survey that provides nationally representative estimates of the 
prevalence -and, therefore, the lifetime risk- of CLD. Consequently, 
relatively accurate, clinically relevant population estimates can be 
generated, and time trends can be identified. The two surveys described here indicated that the prevalence of NAFLD and ALD increased by 16% and 84%, respectively, in persons aged 19 years 
or older over the 19-year interval. In contrary, we found encouraging results with regard to the prevalence of CHB which decreased by 33%.
From our analyses, we estimate that the prevalence of NAFLD 
increased from 18.6% in 1998–2001 to 21.5% in 2016–2017.

This increase was evident in age groups of 20s, 30s, and 60s as 
well as in both genders. This increase may be large due to the increasing population of obesity and diabetes in which the prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 50%. It also could be attributable to the aging Korean population (42 years in 1998–2001 vs. 
47 years in 2016–2017). This increasing trend of NAFLD prevalence reported here is similar to that of a recent systematic review 
of an Asian population.19 Another study predicted that NAFLD 
prevalence in Asia will increase from ~18% in 2016 to 22% by 
2030 and that obesity will increase from ~27% in 2016 to 28.5% 
by 2030.8
 Taken together, our results demonstrate that unless 
there is apparent attenuation in the trend of well-established risk 
factors, the prevalence of NAFLD is expected to continually increase. We also found that 1.2–1.5% of the participants with 
NAFLD had advanced fibrosis (≥F3). Its prevalence is similar to 
previously reported estimates in US population,20 representing a 
major disease burden in now and near future.
As expected by the observed increase in excessive alcohol consumption, the estimated prevalence of ALD increased approximately 85% over this same period. This sharp increasing trend in 
ALD was primarily driven by increasing ALD levels in young adults. 
Our analysis identified a strong and upward trend in ALD prevalence among person younger than 40 years. Considering that the 
early initiation of alcohol abuse in early adulthood is associated 
with unhealthy drinking patterns and adverse psychosocial, behavioral, and other long-term health outcomes,21 this unfavorable 
trend of excessive consumption corresponding with ALD in young 
adults is a concern from a public health perspective.
Our results shed some light on encouraging trends in CHB. We 
observed a downward trend in CHB across all age groups, with 
the exception of the 60s. In the 20s age group, we revealed that 
the prevalence of CHB fell from 5% in 1998–201 to 1.2% in 
2016–2017. Because CHB is a lifetime infectious disease, any increases or decreases in CHB are expected to be first evident in 
younger persons. This finding is in agreement with a previous 
study, which reported that the incidence and prevalence of CHB 
decreased over the last two decades due to the successful implementation of a vaccination program.22,23 Despite the substantial 
progress in preventing CHB in young adults, this study confirms 
the ongoing high prevalence of CHB among Korean adults. The 
consequent burden of CHB remains high and is consistent with 
findings from a recent modelling study.24
Our findings of the prevalence of anti-HCV positivity (0.8%; 
95% CI, 0.6–1.0%) are consistent with a prior analysis of Korean 
data in 2009 that reported 0.8% of about 300,000 health-check 
examinees.25 Our study extended the temporal trend analysis 
through 2017 to demonstrate continued stability of anti-HCV positivity. Based on a finding that one third resulted in HCV RNA 
positivity among those with anti-HCV positivity, the extrapolation 
of KNHANES data suggests a 0.3% CHC prevalence in 2016–
2017. The estimated prevalence of CHC reported here is much 
lower than previous estimates (approximately 1%) in Korea or a 
recent global estimate,26,27 which was based on anti-HCV positivity.
The main strength of the current study is that the data were 
representative of the Korean population and collected using standardized measurements. Although this study makes important 
contributions to the literature, it also has a number of limitations. 
First, because of the absence of imaging or histological diagnosis 
of NAFLD and ALD, we adopted operational criteria for defining 
NAFLD and ALD based on a predictive model that has been validated. Therefore, interpretation of our results should be made 
with caution. Second, the data on alcohol measurement were 
based on self-reports; thus, they may be influenced by recall and 
social desirability bias. Third, rather than tracing the changes that 
occurred over decades, our study simply compared the prevalence 
at two time points. Although we can confirm an increase in 
NAFLD and ALD during the study period, it is unclear whether the 
prevalence of the two diseases was continuously increasing. Finally, the survey participants were sampled only from the non-institutionalized Korean population. The following persons were excluded from the analysis: incarcerated persons, homeless persons, 
and person who were physically unable to undergo the survey. 
Therefore, the overall CLD prevalence might be underestimated.
In conclusion, our study found that the prevalence of NAFLD 
and ALD, particularly in young adults, increased in the Korean 
adult population from 18.6% to 21.5% and from 3.8% to 7.0%, 
respectively, between 1998–2001 and 2016–2017. However, 
there is a downward trend in CHB with a current overall prevalence near 3.4%. The CHC prevalence appears to have plateaued 
0.3%. Our results demonstrate potential targets for interventions 
to reduce the future burden of CLD. Public health efforts are required to prevent and improve modifiable risk factors of CLD.
