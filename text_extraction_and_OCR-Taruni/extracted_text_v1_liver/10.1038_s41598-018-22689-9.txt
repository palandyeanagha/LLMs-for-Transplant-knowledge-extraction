Hepatic and renal energy status prior to transplantation correlates with graft survival. However, efects 
of brain death (BD) on organ-specifc energy status are largely unknown. We studied metabolism, 
perfusion, oxygen consumption, and mitochondrial function in the liver and kidneys following BD. BD 
was induced in mechanically-ventilated rats, infating an epidurally-placed Fogarty-catheter, with shamoperated rats as controls. A 9.4T-preclinical MRI system measured hourly oxygen availability (BOLDrelated R2*) and perfusion (T1-weighted). After 4 hrs, tissue was collected, mitochondria isolated 
and assessed with high-resolution respirometry. Quantitative proteomics, qPCR, and biochemistry 
was performed on stored tissue/plasma. Following BD, the liver increased glycolytic gene expression 
(Pf-1) with decreased glycogen stores, while the kidneys increased anaerobic- (Ldha) and decreased 
gluconeogenic-related gene expression (Pck-1). Hepatic oxygen consumption increased, while renal 
perfusion decreased. ATP levels dropped in both organs while mitochondrial respiration and complex 
I/ATP synthase activity were unafected. In conclusion, the liver responds to increased metabolic 
demands during BD, enhancing aerobic metabolism with functional mitochondria. The kidneys shift 
towards anaerobic energy production while renal perfusion decreases. Our fndings highlight the need 
for an organ-specifc approach to assess and optimise graft quality prior to transplantation, to optimise 
hepatic metabolic conditions and improve renal perfusion while supporting cellular detoxifcation.
Te shortage of donor organs suitable for transplantation remains a major healthcare challenge. Despite various 
strategies to expand the donor pool, such as the increased use of non-heart beating, or living donor grafs1,2
, most 
organs transplanted worldwide are still obtained from brain-dead donors3
. However, compared to living donor 
transplantation, transplantation of brain-dead organ grafs leads to higher rejection rates and inferior long-term 
outcomes4–6
. Tus, the current challenge is to use all available organs including the suboptimal and concurrently 
improve transplantation outcomes.

Brain death (BD) causes complex disturbances in body homeostasis4,6–8. BD is the result of increased 
intracranial pressure (ICP), which leads to progressive ischemia of the cerebrum, brain stem, and spinal cord. 
Consequently, this triggers a sympathetic response with catecholamine release, which causes systemic vasoconstriction and decreased fow through peripheral organs including the liver and kidneys9–11. Furthermore, impairment of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland results in hormonal disturbances, including reduced levels of 
circulating triiodothyronine, vasopressin, and cortisol10. Eventually, ischemia of the spinal cord results in the 
loss of sympathetic tone in the peripheral vascular bed, potentially impacting future organ grafs11,12. Regarding 
the liver and kidneys, this results in increased injury biomarkers pertaining to apoptosis, immune activation, 
infammation, and oxidative stress4,6–8,13. Treatments administered to brain-dead donors aimed at improvement 
of post-transplantation graf and recipient survival may be of beneft. However, systematic reviews show no consistent evidence for the efectiveness of any such treatments14,15. Hence, new strategies are needed to assess and 
optimise organ quality prior to transplantation.
We initiated the present study to investigate metabolic alterations during BD in the liver and kidneys. Under 
normal circumstances, both organs are metabolically active, i.e. the liver primarily fulfls a synthesis and detoxifcation function and the kidneys an excretory task. Te liver is considered the predominant site for carbohydrate, 
lipid, and amino acid metabolism16. Nevertheless, the kidneys are responsible for supplying up to half of the total 
blood glucose levels during prolonged fasting or starvation16,17. Tese metabolic processes are tightly regulated 
as perturbances in cellular metabolic checkpoints e.g. changes in nutrient or oxygen supply can initiate both 
apoptosis and necrosis18. Considering the neuro-endocrine dysregulation, as well as haemodynamic impairment 
and infammation during BD, it is conceivable that metabolism is altered during BD and that this infuences the 
quality of transplantable organs.
Few studies have explored metabolic changes in the brain-dead donor. Novitzky et al. reported decreased 
metabolite utilization and accumulation of fatty acids and lactate in plasma, suggesting a shif from aerobic to 
anaerobic metabolism19. Similar results in the myocardium of brain-dead pigs point towards increased anaerobic metabolism in combination with decreased ATP levels20. Tese studies suggest that the observed metabolic changes are caused either by impaired oxygen utilization due to a primary metabolic (i.e. mitochondrial) 
impairment or alternatively, by impaired oxygen delivery due to changes in tissue perfusion21. Mitochondrial 
impairment can cause increased anaerobic ATP production as well as oxidative stress22,23 and has previously 
been observed in the hearts of brain-dead pigs24 and the muscle fbres of brain-dead, human subjects21. A previous study by our group showed decreased ATP levels in the kidney following BD when compared to living 
donation24. However, mitochondrial function following BD in the liver and kidneys has not been examined. 
Alternatively, anaerobic alterations could result from changes in peripheral perfusion in the hemodynamically 
unstable brain-dead donor. Animal studies have shown decreased perfusion of the liver and kidneys immediately 
following the sympathetic storm during BD25 as well as afer traumatic brain injury26. However, perfusion of the 
liver and kidneys during BD has not yet been explored. Interestingly, a recent publication shows that mitochondrial and metabolic pathways are most pre-dominantly afected following BD27. Together, this suggests that exploration of metabolic changes during BD and possible underlying causes, will provide insights into organ-specifc 
metabolic alterations prior to preservation and might justify (pre)conditioning of grafs prior to transplantation.
Te purpose of this study was to investigate the infuence of BD on systemic and specifcally hepatic and renal 
metabolism in a rodent BD model. We hypothesised that previously observed anaerobic changes during BD originated at least in part from either mitochondrial dysfunction or impaired peripheral perfusion in the liver and 
kidneys. To test this hypothesis, we used repetitive in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualise tissue 
perfusion and oxygenation. Furthermore, we assessed mitochondrial function by measuring in vitro mitochondrial respiration as well as mitochondrial proteomics afer 4 hrs of BD.
Results
Brain death parameters. Adult, male rats were randomly assigned to the BD (n=8) or sham-operated 
(sham) group (n=8). Intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and oxygen saturation were 
measured continuously throughout the experiment. As an internal control for the BD model, declaration of BD 
was confrmed when the ICP superseded the MAP and consequently cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was lower 
than 0mmHg (Fig. S1A). Induction of BD showed a uniform MAP pattern consistent with previous studies8,28, 
with a mean time of 29.3± 6.0 min to declare BD (Fig. S1B). Te MAP of all animals was maintained above 
80mmHg throughout the experiment without the use of vasopressors or colloids. One out of eight experimental 
brain-dead animals had a CCP higher than 0mmHg due to an obstruction of the ICP catheter, but as it showed 
a characteristic MAP profle and absent corneal and pupillary refexes, the animal was included in the study 
(Fig. S1).
Plasma and tissue functional and injury markers, metabolites, and pH following brain death.
We performed plasma, urine, and blood gas analyses of several injury markers and plasma metabolites to validate our model and to ensure that our results were in line with previous human and animal studies, showing 
the negative impact of BD on renal and hepatic function as well as carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. 
Furthermore, we assessed renal mRNA expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), which is an early 
biomarker for BD-induced injury in the kidney prior to transplantation29. In plasma of brain-dead animals, 
increased levels of hepatic injury marker aspartate transaminase (AST, 94.14±9.25 vs. 69.0±8.04, p=0.001) 
but not alanine transaminase (ALT, 53.14±5.61 vs. 56.67±11.86 vs. p=0.829) was found compared to sham 
animals (Fig. 1A,B). Renal functional markers urea (13.14±1.94 vs. 9.61±1.75, p=0.006) and plasma creatinine 
(59.67±13.95 vs. 24.25±4.59, p=0.001) were also increased following BD (Fig. 1C,E), whereas urine creatinine 
was decreased (4.90±0.58 vs. 10.64±2.42, p<0.001, Fig. 1D). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were higher

in the brain-dead group (157.4±43.50 vs. 103.0±39.54, p=0.053, Fig. 1F). mRNA expression of Kim-1 was 
increased in the kidney of brain-dead versus sham animals (0.165±0.071 vs. 0.013±0.007, p<0.001, Fig. 1J).
Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly reduced following BD (8.74 ± 0.88 vs. 11.10 ± 1.76, 
p= 0.005, Fig. 1G), yet lactate levels (2.31 ± 0.85 vs. 2.10 ± 0.84, p= 0.450, Fig. 1H) and pH (7.48 ± 0.04 vs. 
7.37±0.13, p=0.073, Fig. 1I) were not diferent between the two groups. Results from one sham animal indicated supraphysiological values of these plasma markers, which was confrmed statistically with an outlier test. As 
a result, this animal was removed from the analyses.
Several types of fatty acid metabolites were assessed to determine how BD afects fatty acid oxidation (FAO) 
and specifcally which types of fatty acids were altered. Firstly, concentrations of free carnitine (C0), which serves 
as a shuttle for long-chain (C14–C18) acylcarnitines (LCAC) into the mitochondria, were higher in brain-dead 
versus sham animals (C0: 56.50±10.20 vs. 44.75±5.23, p<0.05). LCAC concentrations were slightly elevated in 
the plasma of brain-dead animals (C14: 0.04±0.01 vs. 0.03±0.01, all p<0.05; C18: 0.06±0.01 vs. 0.04±0.01, 
p < 0.05, Fig. 2). Short-chain (C3–C4) acylcarnitines (SCAC) and medium-chain (C6–C12) acylcarnitines 
(MCAC) can permeate the mitochondrial membrane without a carnitine shuttle and serve as additional fuel for 
FAO and the TCA cycle. SCAC concentrations were signifcantly increased in the plasma of brain-dead animals 
(C2: 14.52±2.93 vs. 11.70±2.14, C5: 0.09±0.03 vs. 0.06±0.01, both p<0.05; C3: 0.50±0.16 vs. 0.32±0.07, 
C4: 0.20±0.04 vs. 0.18±0.04, both p<0.01, Fig. 2), whereas minimal changes in MCAC concentrations were 
observed (C6: 0.04±0.03 vs. 0.02±0.0, C12:1: 0.01±0.01 vs. 0.00±0.00, Fig. 2).
Glucose metabolism and glycogen storage in the liver and kidneys following brain death. We 
assessed mRNA expression of several glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes to evaluate hepatic and renal glucose metabolism. Expression of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (Pf-1) was increased in the liver 
(1.98±0.40 vs. 0.61±0.11, p<0.001), but not the kidney (1.48±0.11 vs. 1.60±0.14, p=0.319) of brain-dead 
versus sham animals (Fig. 3A). mRNA levels of glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (Pk) did not difer between 
groups in the liver (39.8± 17.0 vs. 43.8± 9.89, p= 0.336) and kidney (2.39± 0.30 vs. 2.86± 0.77, p= 0.130) 
(Fig. 3B). Te gluconeogenic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (Pc) was similarly expressed in both groups in the 
liver (2.28±0.34 vs. 1.96±0.29, p=0.093) and kidney (1.81±0.25 vs. 1.68±0.13, p=0.293), whereas PEP 
carboxykinase-1 (Pck-1) expression was signifcantly lower in the kidneys of brain-dead than in sham animals 
(14.0±3.28 vs. 24.2±3.13, p<0.001) yet not diferent between groups in the liver (4.23±1.41 vs. 6.26±4.83, 
p=0.694, Fig. 3E). Expression of the fermentation-related enzyme lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha) was not diferent between groups in the liver (9.19±1.81 vs. 7.89±1.31, p=0.190), whereas increased expression was observed 
in the kidney of brain-dead versus sham groups (1.19±0.21 vs. 0.98±0.12, p=0.038) (Fig. 3C). Liver glycogen 
levels estimated with Periodic Acid–Schif (PAS) staining showed a decrease in positively stained areas in the 
liver (7.04×104±1.02×105
 vs. 1.60×105±7.20×104, p=0.026), but not the kidney (2.35×105±1.39×104 vs. 
1.16×105±5.75×104 p=0.151) of brain-dead versus sham animals (Figs 3F, S2).
No changes in mitochondrial respiration in the liver and kidneys following brain death.
Immediately afer organ retrieval, mitochondrial function was assessed in isolated hepatic and renal mitochondria

by measuring O2 consumption rates using four diferent substrate combinations in diferent metabolic states 
(TCA cycle, glutamate transaminase, complex II-dependent respiration, and FAO) (Fig. 4A–D). We found no signifcant changes in the maximal ADP-stimulated O2 consumption rate (state 3) in either the liver or kidney, indicating that the capacity to produce ATP through the oxidative phosphorylation pathway was not afected by BD. 
Mitochondrial quality control was assessed with the respiratory control ratio (RCR), to detect any changes in oxidative phosphorylation capacity related to tightness of mitochondrial coupling. Te RCRs were not signifcantly 
diferent in brain-dead and sham animals when tested with any of the four substrate combinations (Fig. 4E–H).
Increased hepatic oxygen consumption (BOLD) and decreased renal perfusion (ASL) following 
brain death. Troughout the 4 hr BD period, hourly MRI data was obtained to determine Blood Oxygen 
Level Dependent (BOLD)-related oxygenation and Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL)-related perfusion of the liver 
and kidneys. BOLD MRI relies on diferences in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin concentrations in 
blood vessels and surrounding tissue, which in turn causes contrast in the spin-spin relaxation rate (R2*)30,31. 
Diferences in the BOLD-related R2* signal can then be correlated to oxygen availability in the tissue of interest, 
where low R2* values indicate low oxygen consumption yet high oxygenation, and vice versa. R2* baseline values were not diferent between sham and brain-dead animals in the liver and kidneys (Fig. 5A,C,E). We used a 
linear mixed model to determine whether MRI signals were signifcantly diferent between groups over time. For 
R2* BOLD values in the liver, we found a signifcant interaction between time and treatment group (p<0.001), 
indicating a signifcant increase in oxygen consumption in brain-dead versus sham animals over time (Fig. 5A). 
Estimated efects in the liver were: BOLD BD=0.157+0.009 * time; BOLD sham=0.168–0.011 * time. In the 
kidneys, there was no signifcant efect of treatment and time nor a signifcant interaction efect between groups 
(Fig. 5C,E).
Arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI relies on a diference in the T1-weighted signal of infowing blood compared 
to that of the tissue of interest. Tis signal diference can be used to estimate relative changes in tissue perfusion 
and microcirculation32. In the liver, we found no signifcant efect of treatment and time nor any signifcant 
interaction efect between groups (Fig. 5B). In contrast, in each of the kidneys, the linear mixed model for relative 
T1-weighted perfusion found signifcant interactions between time and treatment group (p<0.05) in both kidneys (Fig. 5D,F). Tese signifcant diferences in ASL signal between the two treatment groups over time indicate 
a decline in perfusion of the kidneys throughout the course of BD. Estimated efects for the lef kidney were: ASL 
BD=0.429–1.356 * time; ASL sham=−0.638+1.193 * time. Estimated efects for the right kidney were: ASL 
BD=−1.113–1.160 * time; ASL sham=−0.524+0.305 * time.
Increased metabolism-related protein expression in the liver and decreased expression in the 
kidney. Using a targeted, quantitative proteomics approach, we quantifed 50 proteins involved in oxidative 
phosphorylation, TCA, FAO, and substrate transport, as well as several antioxidant enzymes, in isolated hepatic 
and renal mitochondria. In the liver of brain-dead animals, we observed increased concentrations of peptides 
involved in substrate transport (Ucp2), the connection between glycolysis and TCA cycle (Dld and Dlat), and FAO 
(Acadm and Acadvl) (p<0.05, Fig. 6). Interestingly, most signifcant changes in the kidney showed decreased 
peptide concentrations. Tese proteins were related to complex I (Ndufs1), TCA cycle (Aco2, Fh, and Suclg2) 
and the connection between FAO and electron transport chain (Etfdh), and FAO (Hadhb) (p<0.05, Fig. 6). Te 
expression of two renal proteins, involved in substrate transport (Ucp2) and the TCA cycle (Dlat), was signifcantly higher in brain-dead compared to sham animals (p<0.05, Fig. 6).
Figure 2. Brain death increased fatty acid β oxidation. Afer 4 hrs of experimental time, plasma concentrations 
of saturated and unsaturated acylcarnitines were measured in sham and brain-dead rats with diferent carbon 
(C) chain lengths: short (C0–C5), medium (C6–C12), and long (C14–C18) chain acylcarnitines. Data are 
represented as mean±SD, n=8 per group (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, compared to sham).

To estimate how these changes in protein expression could infuence the metabolic status of the potential 
grafs, cellular ATP content was measured. We showed reduced ATP levels in both the liver (35.56 ±15.7 vs. 
66.2±19.0) and kidney (8.54±3.13±18.5±3.87) of brain-dead animals (both p<0.001, Fig. S3A), suggesting a 
decreased bio-energetic efciency of both organs following BD.

Te signifcantly diferent renal expression of a peptide belonging to complex I, as well as reduced ATP levels in both liver and kidney, led us to investigate the activities of complex I and ATP synthase individually. We 
observed no diferences in complex I and ATP synthase activity comparing brain-dead versus sham animals 
(Fig. S3B,C).
Hepatic and renal oxidative stress markers. Tissue oxidative stress markers were assessed to evaluate 
how the observed changes in perfusion and oxygenation afected the liver and kidneys. Malondialdehyde (MDA), 
which relates to the amount of lipid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), was increased in the kidney (2.78±0.62 vs. 1.83±0.35, p=0.003), but not the liver (1.87±0.57, p=0.442), of brain-dead compared to 
sham animals (Fig. S4A). Furthermore, expression of the stress-response protein Heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1) was 
increased in the liver (1.15±0.34 vs. 0.68±0.23, p=0.017), while no signifcant changes were observed in the 
kidney (0.76±0.90 vs. 0.31±0.50, p=0.068) in brain-dead versus sham animals (Fig. S4B).
Discussion
The energy status of brain-dead donors is a determining factor in renal and hepatic graft survival. In 
cadaveric donors, a positive correlation exists between pre-transplantation renal high-energy phosphates and 
post-transplantation graf viability33,34. Furthermore, delayed graf function (DGF) in renal transplantation is 
preceded by a failure to recover aerobic respiration35. In the liver of brain-dead donors, blood ketone body ratio 
(KBR), refective of hepatic energy production36,37, correlates with post-transplant graf function38. Furthermore, 
the ability to increase and maintain KBR was a better predictor of graf survival than conventional liver function 
tests39. Tese studies strongly suggest that pre-transplant energy status of the liver and kidney is tightly linked 
to post-transplant graf survival and positive transplantation outcomes. Importantly, our data shows that the 
energetic and metabolic status of both the liver and kidney are afected already before organ procurement, that is 
within the brain-dead donor.
Tis study indicates that the liver increases metabolic activity to meet the metabolic demands imposed by BD 
pathophysiology. We not only observed lower levels of carbohydrate metabolites, but also increased expression of 
Pf1, the key enzyme regulating the fux through glycolysis, and increased oxygen consumption as suggested by 
BOLD-MRI, together indicative of increased aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, these changes appear to be related 
to increased glucose catabolism in response to higher energy demands and not the result of impaired cellular 
respiration (i.e. mitochondrial dysfunction) or perfusion. Te altered glucose metabolism is most probably a 
direct consequence of the catecholamine storm elicited by BD, as catecholamines stimulate aerobic glycolysis 
and glucose release via either glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis40. Additionally, ATP depletion can result in Pf1
activation, producing TCA cycle-substrates such as pyruvate16. As glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are reciprocally regulated, it is not surprising that we did not observe any changes in gluconeogenic enzyme expression1,2,16. 
Altogether, our fndings seem to refect increased metabolic utilization of carbohydrate energy sources in the liver 
because of increased energy demands.
When carbohydrate levels are low, as is seen during periods of fasting and starvation, metabolic pathways shif 
to facilitate catabolism of fatty acids or amino acids3,16,17,41. In line with prior studies in brain-dead patients4–6,10,19, 
we indeed observed increased plasma levels of free fatty acids and amino acids following BD. More specifcally, 
both free carnitine (C0) and several LCAC were increased following BD, suggestive of increased FAO as C0 
shuttles LCAC to the mitochondria. Furthermore, we observed increased plasma SCAC, which can penetrate 
the mitochondrial membrane without a carnitine shuttle and serve as additional fuel for FAO and the TCA 
cycle4,6–8,42. Tis shif towards fatty acid metabolism might also explain that oxygen consumption was increased, 
as both SCFA and MCFA can efectuate increased oxygen consumption and supply of NADH or FADH2 to 
Figure 6. Mitochondrial proteomics profle. Data are represented as mean fold induction of average protein 
concentration (fmol/µg total protein) in BD versus sham groups in the liver and kidney. Diferences in protein 
concentrations are considered signifcant when p<0.05 in BD versus sham groups per individual organ, n=8 
per group.

the mitochondria9–11,42. Additionally, mitochondrial proteomic-analysis showed a tendency towards increased 
expression of proteins involved in FAO and substrate transport, as well as proteins connecting glycolysis, TCA 
cycle, FAO, and the electron transport chain. Altogether our fndings suggest that the liver increases metabolic 
activity and more importantly, that these diferences already take place in the brain-dead donor, before subsequent preservation and transplantation-related ischemia-and reperfusion injury which is known to further 
deplete ATP stores10,43.
Te adaptive hepatic response is in sharp contrast to the metabolic changes observed in the kidneys. Our 
data suggest that anaerobic glycolysis is enhanced in concert with ATP depletion, increased levels of oxidative 
stress and decreased renal perfusion. Since oxygen consumption, mitochondrial oxygen utilization, and oxygen saturation levels were not afected, altered renal perfusion and thereby hypoxia likely underlie the observed 
efects, as opposed to mitochondrial dysfunction. Tis is supported by a recent study by our group that shows 
that several markers of hypoxia signalling pathways are increased following 4 hours of BD11,12,27. As decreased 
ASL signals were observed despite normal blood pressure levels, we propose that microcirculatory changes as 
seen in acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis models, underlie this efect. In these models, initial hypoxic damage 
leads to microcirculatory changes and subsequently decreased renal perfusion, function, and ATP levels, hours 
later4,6–8,13,44,45. Translating this to the BD setting, initial hypoxia is likely caused by the catecholamine storm, 
which leads to severe hypertension and decreased renal perfusion immediately afer BD onset14,15,25,46. Tis immediate decrease in renal perfusion was not refected in our ASL data, probably because it could, at the earliest, 
be measured approximately 10 minutes afer BD onset, when the efects of the catecholamine storm on renal 
perfusion have already subsided16,47. In AKI, secondary microcirculatory failure is mediated by increased superoxide levels and results in increased lactate/pyruvate ratios, suggesting increased anaerobic metabolism16,17,48. 
Since superoxide levels increase7,18 and renal perfusion decreases as BD progresses, these changes could mediate 
the anaerobic efects we observed as BD progressed. In line with this, increased LDH mRNA expression and 
plasma levels could be explained by higher lactate-to-bicarbonate and lower NAD+/NADH ratios as a consequence of hypoxic changes19,49. Surprisingly, whereas AKI and IRI result in increased gluconeogenic activity in 
the kidney20,50,51, renal gluconeogenesis-related Pck-1 expression was decreased following BD. Even though the 
mechanism behind this change is unclear, the protein expression of another rate-limiting gluconeogenic enzyme, 
glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase, is also decreased following BD21,27, suggesting that the gluconeogenic 
capacity of the kidney is impaired.
Several studies suggest that the changes we observed are of clinical importance. Firstly, ASL-related changes in 
perfusion correlate positively with plasma biomarkers in renal allograf recipients during acute rejection22,23,52,53. 
Furthermore, the occurrence of DGF following renal transplantation is preceded by failure to recover aerobic 
metabolism or improve ATP levels21,35. Additionally, we observed not only metabolic anaerobic changes but also 
increased oxidative stress markers including MDA, which correlate to both DGF and one-year graf function 
following transplantation24,54,55. Altogether, our results suggest that BD impairs renal perfusion and that hypoxic 
changes are likely responsible for the metabolic changes observed in the brain-dead donor.
Our results highlight the need for an organ-specifc approach to facilitate optimal function of the liver and 
kidneys following BD. Even though ethical and logistical constraints make treatment of brain-dead donors a 
challenging endeavour, our data suggests that optimisation of donor homeostasis should include haemodynamic 
stabilisation and metabolic support. Whether in the donor or during machine perfused organ preservation, we 
suggest that treatment of the liver should include nutrient supplementation to restore energy supplies, for example by supplying carbohydrate metabolites. In brain-dead pigs, glucose infusion efciently increased hepatic glycogen content and, concomitantly with insulin administration, increased glucose uptake in other tissues as well, 
thereby decreasing the hepatic energy demand25,56. On the other hand, kidney function should be ameliorated by 
improvement of renal perfusion while supporting cellular detoxifcation, reverting back to aerobic metabolism 
and replenishing energy stores. Tis could encompass haemodynamic stabilisation of donors with dopamine, 
which reduced levels of DGF following kidney transplantation26,57. Other strategies might behold improving renal 
(micro)circulation by administering vascular dilators or reducing oxidative stress with anti-oxidant treatments, 
the latter being of interest as oxidative stress markers in brain-dead donors correlate with DGF27,55. Furthermore, 
the implementation of machine perfusion lends itself well to target the liver and kidney individually, and to 
monitor their metabolic and energetic status as well as resistance to perfusion to evaluate graf quality prior to 
transplantation.
We acknowledge that several limitations apply to our study. Due to the experimental setup, sham animals 
were exposed to a longer anaesthetic duration than brain-dead animals, which introduced anaesthetic duration 
as a possible confounder. However, studies on the efects of sevofurane administration in mice have shown that 
sevofurane does not alter histopathology or function of the liver and kidneys8,28,58,59, suggesting that possible 
short-term efects of this anaesthetic are negligible. Furthermore, we acknowledge that changes in mRNA expression do not take (post)-translational modifcations into account, hence these results should be interpreted with 
caution. Finally, we wish to point out that due to multiple testing we have increased the probability of type I 
statistical errors, particularly in our proteomics analysis. However, we have chosen to accept this risk as these 
statistical tests were performed for secondary outcome parameters, which were used to explore patterns that were 
in support of our primary outcomes parameters (i.e. MRI and mitochondrial respiration).
In conclusion, we show that BD pathophysiology influences systemic metabolic processes, along with 
organ-specifc metabolic changes with noticeable diferences between the liver and kidneys. Te liver responds to 
increased metabolic demands by enhancing aerobic metabolism in normally functioning mitochondria, whilst 
facilitating the use of alternative energy sources. In contrast, the kidneys shut down metabolically and sufer from 
oxidative stress, shifing towards anaerobic energy production while renal perfusion decreases. An organ-specifc, 
dual approach focusing on metabolic changes and graf perfusion should be part of novel strategies to assess and

treat organ grafs in the brain-dead donor or during preservation, and could be the key to improving transplantation outcomes.
Methods
Brain death model. Sixteen male, adult Fisher F344 (Harlan, UK) rats (250–300 g) were randomly assigned 
to the BD (n=8) or sham-operated (sham) group (n=8). Te experimental protocol was approved by the Danish 
Animal Experimentation Inspectorate, under Te Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Fisheries (Approval no. 
2014-15-2934-01007). All animals received care in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for 
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals 
Used for Experimental and Other Scientifc Purposes. Rats were kept in cages in a 12:12 hour light-dark cycle, 
with a temperature of 21 °C±2 °C, and humidity levels of 55%±5%. Animals had ad libitum access to a standard 
rodent diet (Altromin, Lage, Germany) and tap water.
Te BD model used was previously described by Kolkert et al.
28,30,31, with the following adaptations to ensure 
MRI compatibility. Animals were anaesthetised using sevofurane with and FIO2 of 100%, intubated via a tracheostomy, and ventilated (MR-compatible Small Animal Ventilator. SA Instrument, Inc. NY. USA.) with the 
following ventilation parameters: tidal volume of 7ml/kg of body weight (kg) per stroke, positive end expiratory 
pressure of 3 cm of H2O with an initial respiratory rate of 120 per min, and corrected based on end-tidal CO2
(ETCO2). Continuous MAP monitoring and volume replacement was performed via cannulas that were inserted 
in the femoral artery and vein, respectively. Besides a frontolateral hole, drilled for the epidural placement of a no. 
4 Fogarty catheter used to induce BD (Edwards Lifesciences Co, Irvine, CA), a second hole was drilled contralaterally for ICP monitoring with a 24G cannula. BD was induced by infation of the Fogarty catheter; this infation 
was ended once the MAP rose above 80 mmHg. BD was confrmed when the ICP superseded the MAP. Afer 
30 mins of BD, the FiO2 was lowered to 50%. Possible reasons for exclusion of animals from the study was the 
inability to confrm BD or maintain a normotensive MAP. Rocuronium (0.1 mg/ml at 0.3ml/h) was administered 
to avoid movements during MR scanning. Sham animals underwent an identical surgical procedure, without 
insertion of the Fogarty catheter, while anaesthesia lasted the entire 4 hrs of experimental time.
Afer 4 hrs, the experiment was terminated as previously described28,32 and the liver, kidneys, plasma and 
urine were harvested. Tissue from the liver and one kidney were used for mitochondrial isolation. Additional 
tissue, plasma and urine were stored.
Plasma and urine injury markers, blood gas analysis, and metabolites. Plasma levels of AST, ALT, 
creatinine, urea, LDH, glucose, and lactate, and urine creatinine were determined at the clinical chemistry laboratory of the University Medical Centre Groningen according to standard procedures. Results from one sham 
animal resulted in supraphysiological values of plasma markers, which was confrmed statistically with an outlier 
test. As a result, this animal was removed from the analyses. Blood gas analyses were performed immediately 
afer aortic puncturing using ABL725 analysers (Radiometer Medical Aps, Brønshøj, Copenhagen, Denmark) to 
determine the pH, partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon-dioxide, haemoglobin and SaO2. Samples 
containing blood clots were excluded from analyses.
Acylcarnitine analysis was performed using a method previously described33,34,60. Supernatant acylcarnitine 
concentrations were measured with an API 3000 LC-MS/MS, equipped with a Turbo ion spray source (Applied 
Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Ontario, Canada).
Glucose metabolism, glycogen storage, and renal injury marker KIM-1. Periodic acid–Schif staining. To determine glycogen tissue concentrations, a PAS staining was performed in parafn embedded tissue 
samples. Next, all slices were scanned and ten pictures per slice at 4× (in the case of the liver) or 20× (in the case 
of the kidney) magnifcation used to estimate the positive PAS area with ImageJ script35,61. Te fnal value per slice 
was recorded as the mean of positive areas.
RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and Real-Time quantitative PCR. From whole liver and kidney sections, we isolated total RNA using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), with a method previously described8,36,37. 
Amplifcation of several genes fragments was done with the primer sets outlined in Table 1. Pooled cDNA from 
brain-dead rats was used as an internal reference. Gene expression was normalised with the mean of β-actin

mRNA content. Real-Time PCR was carried out according to standard procedures as previously described11. 
Results were expressed as 2−ΔΔCT (CT - Treshold Cycle).
Mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial isolation. Afer 4 hrs of BD, organs were removed and placed 
into ice-cold 0.9% KCl solution. A diferential centrifugation procedure38,62 was used to isolate either mitochondria from 1.5 g of liver tissue or a whole kidney. Te total volume of working reagent required was determined by 
calculation of the protein concentration in the mitochondrial suspension with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, 
Termo Fisher Scientifc Inc., Rockford, IL, USA).
High resolution respirometry. The rates of oxygen consumption in isolated mitochondria (0.4 mg/ml of 
mitochondrial protein) were measured at 37 °C using a two-channel high-resolution Oroboros oxygraph-2k 
(Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria). The assay medium contained: EGTA (0.5 mM), MgCl2 (3 mM), KH2PO4
(10 mM), Lactobionic acid (60 mM), Taurine (20 mM), HEPES (20 mM), D-Sucrose (110 mM), and bovine 
serum albumin (BSA, 1 mg/ml, pH 7.2). The substrates for oxidation were: (i) pyruvate (5 mM) + malate 
(2 mM): TCA cycle function; (ii) succinate (5mM)+rotenone (1 μM): complex II-dependent respiration; (iii) 
glutamate (5 mM)+ malate (5 mM: glutamate transaminase and TCA cycle function; and (iv) palmitoyl-CoAa 
(25 μM)+L-carnitine (2 mM)+ malate (2 mM): FAO. To reach maximal ADP-stimulated oxygen consumption (state 3), hexokinase (4.8 U/ml), glucose (12.5 mM), and ADP (1 mM) were added. Resting state oxygen 
consumption rate (state 4) was measured afer we blocked ADP phosphorylation with carboxyatractyloside 
(1.25 μM). Te oxygen consumption rate in the uncoupled state (state U) was determined afer addition of carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifuoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 2 μM). Te respiratory control ratio (RCR) was 
calculated by dividing oxygen consumption rate in state 3 by that of state 4. Data acquisition (4Hz sampling frequency) and analysis were performed using DatLab sofware version 5 (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria).
MRI assessment of oxygen consumption (BOLD) and perfusion (ASL). Animals were placed in a 
MRI compatible animal-bed (Rapid Biomedical, Würzburg, Germany) and the following parameters controlled: 
rectal temperature, blood and intracranial pressure, ETCO2, and pulse oximetry. MRI data was collected with an 
Agilent 9.4T preclinical MRI system (Agilent Technologies, Yarnton, UK), containing a 72-mm quadrature 1H 
transmit/receive volume coil (Rapid Biomedical, Würzburg, Germany).
A high-resolution coronal spin-echo sequence was employed for anatomical description, acquired using the 
following sequence parameters: matrix 256×192, feld of view (FOV) of 107×90mm2, repetition time (TR) of 
3000ms, echo time (TE) of 22.8ms, and 1mm thickness.
BOLD MRI relies on diferences in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin concentrations in blood vessels and surrounding tissue. Tese diferences cause contrast in MRI infuencing the so-called spin-spin relaxation rate (R2*), allowing R2* values to be correlated to oxygen consumption (when external factors such as 
regional perfusion are accounted for) and inversely correlated to oxygen availability of a specifc region of interest 
(i.e. low R2* values indicate low oxygen consumption yet high oxygenation)39,63,64. R2* can be calculated using 
an oxygenation-dependent sequence (T2*-weighted) and obtained using an axial 1H-multi-echo gradient-echo 
sequence, covering the entire abdomen with 32 slices using the following sequence parameters: matrix of 
128×128, FOV of 80×80 mm2, fip angle of 90°, TR of 800ms, TE of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16ms, number of 
transients of 2, and 2mm thickness. R2* levels calculated at baseline (time 0h) served as an internal control to 
calculate relative changes in oxygenation, a measure superior to absolute values40,64.
ASL MRI relies on a diference in the T1-weighted signal of infowing blood compared to that of the tissue 
of interest, allowing estimation of relative changes in tissue perfusion. For T1-measurements a single-slice segmented Look–Locker sequence with a gradient-echo readout was used to acquire T1-weighted data. Te following sequence parameters were used: matrix of 128×128, FOV of 80×80mm2, fip angle of 8°, TR of 3ms, TE of 
2ms, inversion times (TI) of 150, 250, 400, 600, 900, 1200, 2500, 4000ms, and 2mm thickness.
VnmrJ (Agilent Technologies) was used for image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Manually drawn 
regions of interest were encompassed around the liver and kidneys. Quantitative T2* maps were calculated from 
pixel-by-pixel analysis using a nonlinear least-squares ft to the logarithmic magnitude vs. TE. Quantitative T1 
maps were calculated from a three-parameter ft applied to the inversion recovery Look-Locker sequence, using 
the mathematical approach given by Ramasawmy et al.
16,65.
Mitochondrial proteomics, complex I and ATP synthase activity, and tissue ATP levels.
Targeted, quantitative mitochondrial proteomics. In isolated mitochondria, we quantifed a selection of mitochondrial proteins involved in the substrate transport, FAO and TCA cycle, using isotopically-labelled standards (13C-labeled lysines and arginines). Tese were derived from synthetic protein concatamers (QconCAT) 
(PolyQuant GmbH, Bad Abbach, Germany), using a method previously described66.
Hepatic and renal ATP concentrations. Frozen liver and kidney tissue was cut into 20mm slices; 650mg of these 
slices were used to determine ATP content according to standard procedures67.
Complex I and ATP synthase enzyme activity measurements. Mitochondria were isolated as previously 
described62, then diluted in PBS, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 600 g for 10min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined in the supernatant using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Termo Fisher Scientifc Inc., 
Rockford, IL, USA).
Activity of complex I was monitored spectrophotometrically at 600nm and 37 °C, as previously described68. 
Rotenone-sensitive complex I activity was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of DCIP, equal 
to 21000 M−1
cm−1 and expressed as nmol/min/mg protein68. The activity of ATP synthase was measured 

www.nature.com/scientificreports/

spectrophotometrically at 340nm and 37 °C, as previously described64. Oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthase activity was calculated using the molar extinction coefcient of NADH, equal to 6220 M−1
cm−1 and expressed as 
nmol/min/mg mitochondrial protein69.
Oxidative stress markers. Determination of oxidative damage through quantifcation of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation product MDA was quantifed in liver and kidney homogenates (20 µl) by measuring 
the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances with a method previously described7
.
Gene expression of protective protein Heme oxygenase-1. Gene expression of Ho-1 was determined with 
Real-time PCR as described previously8
 with the primer set outlined in Table 1.
Statistical Analyses. For *R2 BOLD and T1 data, we estimated that we would need a total of 8 animals 
per group to detect a clinically signifcant diference with an α of 0.05, power of 80%, using a two-tailed test. 
Descriptive statistics were done to confrm that the data met the assumption of equal distributions of residuals. 
A linear mixed model was used with repeated measures over time to analyse the impact of the treatment (BD 
or sham) on BOLD and ASL in the liver and kidney, with fxed efects of time, treatment group, and the interaction of treatment and time (IBM SPSS Statistics 23). Tis model was chosen because it takes the dependency 
of the measurements across time into consideration, and prevented list-wise deletion caused by missing data 
points. Te model selection for covariance parameters was chosen based on the best ft according to the Bayesian 
Information Criterion. When comparing two independent groups at a single time point, the non-parametric 
Mann-Whitney test was used to identify signifcant diferences between the groups (n=8 in each group) with 
Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Sofware Inc, CA, USA). To confrm abnormal results, a boxplot was performed to identify 
extreme outliers and considered signifcant when they scored >3× IQR compared to the other values with IBM 
SPSS Statistics 23. All statistical tests were 2-tailed and p<0.05 was regarded as signifcant. Results are presented 
as mean±SD (standard deviation).
