Abstract
Background: Transarterial chemoembolisation is the standard of care for intermediate stage (BCLC B)
hepatocellular carcinoma, but it is challenging to decide when to repeat or stop treatment. Here we performed the
first external validation of the SNACOR (tumour Size and Number, baseline Alpha-fetoprotein, Child-Pugh and
Objective radiological Response) risk prediction model.
Methods: A total of 1030 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent transarterial chemoembolisation at our
tertiary referral centre from January 2000 to December 2016. We determined the following variables that were
needed to calculate the SNACOR at baseline: tumour size and number, alpha-fetoprotein level, Child-Pugh
class, and objective radiological response after the first transarterial chemoembolisation. Overall survival, timedependent area under receiver-operating characteristic curves, Harrell’s C-index, and the integrated Brier score
were calculated to assess predictive ability. Finally, multivariate analysis was performed to identify
independent predictors of survival.
Results: The study included 268 patients. Low, intermediate, and high SNACOR scores predicted a median
survival of 31.5, 19.9, and 9.2 months, respectively. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve
for overall survival were 0.641, 0.633, and 0.609 at 1, 3, and 6 years, respectively. Harrell’s C-index was 0.59, and
the integrated Brier Score was 0.175. Independent predictors of survival included tumour size (P < 0.001), baseline
alpha-fetoprotein level (P < 0.001) and Child-Pugh class (P < 0.004). Objective radiological response (P = 0.821) and
tumour number (P = 0.127) were not additional independent predictors of survival.
Conclusions: The SNACOR risk prediction model can be used to identify patients with a dismal prognosis after the first
transarterial chemoembolisation who are unlikely to benefit from further transarterial chemoembolisation. However,
Harrell’s C-index showed only moderate performance. Accordingly, this risk prediction model can only serve
as one of several components used to make the decision about whether to repeat treatment.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common cancers worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths [1, 2]. According to
the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification,
transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is the recommended treatment for intermediate-stage HCC (BCLCB) [3]. However, the BCLC-B subgroup is quite heterogeneous, and not all patients benefit equally from TACE
[4]. The question of when to stop TACE and possibly
change to systemic treatment or even to best supportive
care remains a challenge. In recent years, several scoring
systems have been developed to support decision making
after the first TACE, including the ART score (Assessment for Retreatment with TACE) and the ABCR score
(Alpha-fetoprotein, BCLC, Child-Pugh, and Response)
[5, 6]. However, none of these scoring systems are currently used in clinical practice.
To provide decision support regarding the issue of
TACE retreatment, Kim et al. recently introduced the
SNACOR (tumour Size, tumour Number, baseline
Alpha-fetoprotein level, Child-Pugh class, and Objective
radiological Response) clinical scoring system [7]. This
system uses baseline liver function, baseline tumour parameters, and tumour response after the first TACE to
evaluate the suitability of retreatment. However, the use
of such clinical scoring systems in clinical routine has
been controversial, and further external validation has
been recommended [8, 9]. A few studies have been conducted to validate the ART score [10–14] and the ABCR
score [13], but, to the best of our knowledge, no attempt
has been made to validate the SNACOR score. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform the first
external validation of the SNACOR score.
Methods
Patients
The study was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) for the retrospective analysis of clinical data.
Patient records and clinical information were deidentified prior to analysis. Primary data collection was carried
out using specially developed clinical registry software
for the characterisation of patients with HCC [15].
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same
as in the original SNACOR publication. The study included treatment-naïve patients who received TACE
as first-line therapy and who had HCC diagnosed by
histological or radiological evaluation according to the
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
(AASLD) or the European Association for the Study of
the Liver (EASL) guidelines [7, 16, 17]. The study excluded patients with an inadequate target lesion (infiltrative pattern, non-arterial enhancement, or largest lesion <
1 cm); patients with an additional primary malignancy in
another organ or with extrahepatic lesions; Child-Pugh
class C patients; and patients with uncontrolled functional
or metabolic disease [7].
As recommended by the authors of the original SNACOR publication, who only included patients who
underwent conventional TACE, patients in this study received conventional, Lipiodol-based TACE (cTACE), or
TACE using drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) [7]. Treatment was performed in a standardised manner that is
extensively described elsewhere [18, 19].
Imaging and tumour response
Each patient underwent contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
prior to the first TACE treatment. Six weeks after the
first TACE treatment, restaging with CT or MRI was
performed prior to the second TACE. This examination
was the basis for the radiological assessment of the
tumour response, which was evaluated by applying the
unidimensional EASL criteria [20]. The objective tumour
response was defined as a partial response (PR) before
the second TACE treatment. Stable disease (SD) and
progressive disease (PD) were assessed as a lack of radiological response.
Calculation of the SNACOR score
The SNACOR score consists of the summed scores of
the following variables: tumour size (< 5 cm, 0 points;
≥5 cm, 1 point), tumour number (< 4, 0 points; ≥4, 2
points), baseline alpha-fetoprotein level (< 400 ng/ml, 0
points; ≥400 ng/ml, 3 points), Child-Pugh class (A, 0
points; B, 1 point), and the objective radiological response (CR + PR, 0 points; SD + PD, 3 points). Hence,
the SNACOR score ranges from 0 to 10 points. According to the original SNACOR paper, three risk groups can
be differentiated using the SNACOR score: 0–2 points,
low risk; 3–6 points, intermediate risk; and 7–10 points,
high risk [7].
Statistical analysis
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the period from the
day before the first TACE until death or last follow-up.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were drawn using R 3.4.2
(A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, https://
www.R-project.org; accessed 2017). Survival between
strata was compared using the log-rank test. Kernel
probability densities were obtained using the R package
survPresmooth, which calculates presmoothed probability
density estimates for censored data [21]. Cumulative/dynamic receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were
obtained using the R package timeROC. Areas under the
curve (AUROCs) were derived at specified time points for
comparison with those in the original SNACOR paper.
Mähringer-Kunz et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:489 Page 2 of 8

R 3.4.2 and SAS 9.4 were used for descriptive statistics and to perform multivariate analyses of all variables used in the SNACOR system in order to
identify independent predictors of survival and to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). As this analysis was intended to be
exploratory, the P-values should be interpreted in a descriptive manner.
Validation was performed using Harrell’s C-index, and
prediction error curves were based on the Brier score
[22, 23]. Both Harrell’s C-index and AUROC can range
from 0 to 1, where 0.5 indicates no predictive ability and
1 indicates perfect predictive ability. A value below 0.5
indicates “anti-prediction”. The Brier score at time t is
the mean squared difference between the observed outcome (1 for event and 0 otherwise) and the predicted
outcome probability at time t. The integrated Brier score
(IBS) over the interval [0 m, 72 m] was calculated as a
summary measure of prediction error.
Results
Patient recruitment
A total of 1030 patients with HCC underwent TACE between January 2000 and December 2016 at our tertiary
referral centre, and 762 patients were excluded for the
reasons shown in the CONSORT flowchart (Fig. 1).
Thus, the SNACOR score was calculated for 268
patients.
Baseline patient characteristics and treatment
In our cohort, the mean patient age prior to the first
TACE was 66.5 years (median, 66.9 years; range, 36.
1–87.3 years; SD ± 9.4). A total of 227 (84.7%) patients were men, and 41 (15.3%) were women. The
main aetiology of HCC was alcohol abuse. Table 1
shows the baseline patient characteristics of our cohort and those of the original SNACOR cohort. cTACE
was performed in 190 patients, and DEB-TACE was performed in 78 patients. Overall, the mean number of TACE
sessions was 5.6 (median, 5; min, 1; max, 21).
SNACOR score
All variables that were needed to calculate the SNACOR score (both at baseline and prior to the second
TACE) were determined (Table 1). Of the 268 patients, 94 (35.1%) were in the low-risk SNACOR score
group (score 0–2), 144 patients (53.7%) were in the
intermediate-risk group (score 3–6), and 30 patients
(11.2%) were in the high-risk group (score 7–10). The
median OS was 31.5 months (95% CI 23.1–46.0) in the
low-risk group, 19.9 months (95% CI 17.1–26.2) in the
intermediate-risk group, and 9.2 months in the high-risk
group (95% CI 6.2–21.7). The Kaplan-Meier survival
curves are shown in Fig. 2. Table 2 compares the survival
rates in our study with those in the original SNACOR
study [7].
The AUROC for overall survival was 0.641 at 1 year, 0.
633 at 3 years, and 0.609 at 6 years. Harrell’s C-index was
0.59. The prediction error curves are shown in Fig. 3. The
IBS for the first 6 years was 0.175. In comparison, the IBS
was 0.184 using the Kaplan-Meier estimates for the unstratified sample. The probability density estimates (Fig. 4)
show a high degree of overlap.
The Cox regression analysis used tumour size, tumour
number, baseline alpha-fetoprotein level, the Child-Pugh
class, and objective radiological response as covariates
(Table 3). Only tumour size, baseline alpha-fetoprotein
level, and the Child-Pugh class had significant prognostic
value (HR = 2.51, P < 0.001; HR = 1.76, P < 0.001; HR = 1.
56, P = 0.004). Objective radiological response (HR = 0.
97, P = 0.821) and tumour number (HR = 1.28, P = 0.
127) were not additional independent predictors of
survival.

Discussion
In this study, the SNACOR score was able to differentiate between low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients,
who respectively showed a median OS of 31.5 months,
19.9 months, and 9.2 months. However, the original
SNACOR publication reported respective median OS
values of 49.8 months, 30.7 months, and 12.4 months
for these groups. Hence, the discriminative ability of the
SNACOR score between the three risk groups with respect to OS was inferior in our study compared to the
original one. We observed considerable overlap in the
survival time distribution. Accordingly, the Harrell’s Cindex was 0.59 and the IBS was 0.175. AUROCs for
overall survival were 0.641 at 1 year, 0.633 at 3 years,
and 0.609 at 6 years; in the original SNACOR study, the
comparable AUROC values were 0.756, 0.754, and 0.742,
respectively. In summary, SNACOR does not perform
well enough to be used alone to make clear-cut clinical
decisions.
In the multivariate analysis, and in contrast to the original SNACOR study, we were only able to confirm the
predictive value of tumour size, baseline alphafetoprotein level, and Child-Pugh class. Thus, two of the
five parameters for calculating the SNACOR score were

not predictive in our analysis, which may at least in part
be due to the moderate sample size. The objective radiological response and tumour number at baseline failed
to show a significant impact on survival. Notably,
tumour size and tumour number reflect a patient’s
tumour burden, and tumour size correlates with a higher
risk of vascular invasion and distant metastasis [24, 25].
As tumour size is a known independent risk factor of
survival [26, 27], it is part of several risk prediction
models that have been published in recent years. We
confirmed that tumour size is an independent predictor
of survival. However, as noted above, tumour number
was not an additional independent predictor of survival
in our analysis. Whether or not tumour number is a significant prognostic factor is unclear in the literature;
some series found it to have predictive value [27–30],
while others did not [5, 26]. The fact that tumour number was not an independent predictor of survival in our
study collective might be attributable to the moderate
size of the final patient group of 268 patients. However,
this validation group was considerably bigger than the
validation cohort in the original SNACOR publication,
which comprised 145 patients. Furthermore, it might be
explained at least in part by the phenomenon of collinearity; we observed some positive correlation between
tumour size and tumour number (Spearman r = 0.165).
Alpha-fetoprotein level (AFP) was an independent predictor of survival in our analysis, which is in accordance
with the majority of publications [27–29, 31], since AFP
may be a surrogate marker for tumour burden and
tumour aggressiveness [32, 33]. Therefore, AFP is part of
several prediction scores [6, 26, 30]. The Child-Pugh
score describes liver function and has shown significant
prognostic value in several studies [28, 34–36]. Objective
radiological response was not an additional independent
predictor of survival in our analysis. Although it was not
predictive in several other studies as well [10, 37], most
authors regard objective radiological response as an important predictor [5, 6, 31, 38]. The fact that objective
radiological response was not an independent predictor
in our study might also be attributable to the moderate
sample size and the phenomenon of collinearity, at least
in part. We observed a weak negative correlation between tumour size and the objective radiological response (Spearman r = − 0.172). One important reason
why the SNACOR score did not show the same predictive power in our study as in the original publication
might be the so-called “overfitting” effect. This has been
described as “a phenomenon occurring when a model

maximizes its performance on some set of data but its
predictive performance is not confirmed elsewhere due
to random fluctuations of patients’ characteristics in different clinical and demographical backgrounds [8]”. Our
patients differed significantly from the patients in the
original SNACOR study in terms of tumour number,
Child-Pugh class, and aetiology [7]. For example, alcoholic cirrhosis was the main reason for hepatocellular
carcinoma in our study, whereas in the study by Kim et
al., 71.2% of patients had hepatitis-B-related hepatocellular carcinoma, and 12.9% of patients had hepatitis-Crelated hepatocellular carcinoma [7].
Our analysis has several limitations. The most important ones are that our validation was conducted in a
retrospective manner and that the final sample size (n =
268) was only moderate. Ideally, prospective validation
would be performed with a sufficiently large patient cohort using a multicentre approach. As recommended by
the authors of the original SNACOR publication, which
only included patients who underwent cTACE, in this
study TACE was performed as cTACE or using DEBTACE. Differences in TACE techniques might influence
the applicability of the SNACOR system. cTACE and
DEB-TACE have been compared multiple times in the
last decade, but these comparisons have never shown a
significant influence on survival [18, 39, 40]. Indeed, we
drew the same conclusion when we analysed our own
data [41]. Patients who underwent liver transplantation
or surgery after TACE were excluded in the present analysis in order to ensure comparability with the original
SNACOR data. However, from a statistical point of view,
such patients should not be excluded; rather, they should
be censored at the time of treatment change in order to
eliminate immortal time bias.
Conclusions
Even though the SNACOR system showed some ability to discriminate between patients with a favourable
outcome after TACE versus patients with an impaired
prognosis, SNACOR alone was not sufficient to reliably distinguish different prognostic groups. Therefore, SNACOR alone is not sufficient to support
clear-cut clinical decision making, and further efforts are
needed to determine appropriate criteria for making valid
clinical predictions. Other approaches, such as machine
learning, could be helpful for making future clinical predictions with increased validity.
