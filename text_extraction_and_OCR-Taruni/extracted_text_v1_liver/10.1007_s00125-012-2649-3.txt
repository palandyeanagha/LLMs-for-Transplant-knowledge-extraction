Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Plasma ceramide concentrations correlate
with insulin sensitivity, inflammation and atherosclerotic
risk. We hypothesised that plasma ceramide concentrations
are increased in the presence of elevated fatty acid levels
and are regulated by increased liver serine C-palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity.
Methods Lean humans and rats underwent an acute lipid
infusion and plasma ceramide levels were determined. One
group of lipid-infused rats was administered myriocin to
inhibit SPT activity. Liver SPT activity was determined in
lipid-infused rats, and obese, insulin resistant mice. The
time and palmitate dose-dependent synthesis of intracellular
and secreted ceramide was determined in HepG2 liver cells.
Results Plasma ceramide levels were increased during lipid
infusion in humans and rats, and in obese, insulin-resistant
mice. The increase in plasma ceramide was not associated
with changes in liver SPT activity, and inhibiting SPT activity by ∼50% did not alter plasma ceramide levels in lipidinfused rats. In HepG2 liver cells, palmitate incorporation
into extracellular ceramide was both dose- and timedependent, suggesting the liver cells rapidly secreted the
newly synthesised ceramide.
Conclusions/interpretation Elevated systemic fatty acid
availability increased plasma ceramide but this was not
associated with changes in hepatic SPT activity, suggesting
that liver ceramide synthesis is driven by substrate availability rather than increased SPT activity. This report also provides evidence that the liver is sensitive to the intracellular
ceramide concentration, and an increase in liver ceramide
secretion may help protect the liver from the deleterious
effects of intracellular ceramide accumulation.

insulin-sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and liver
to inhibit insulin signal transduction [1]. Recent observations have expanded on this paradigm and report increases
in plasma ceramide in obesity that correlate with the
severity of insulin resistance, inflammation and atherosclerotic risk [2–4].
The liver is considered a primary source of plasma
ceramides, as evidenced by the close overlap in the
ceramide species profiles of the liver and plasma [2],
the fact that 75% of ceramides are contained in VLDL
or LDL [5] and that ceramides secreted by isolated
hepatocytes are largely contained in VLDL [6]. Ceramide is generated through a number of pathways, including de novo synthesis from long-chain fatty acids, from
the hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid sphingomyelin and via the salvage pathway (for a review, see
[1]). The major pathway for ceramide synthesis from
fatty acids is the de novo synthesis pathway, and the
regulation of flux through this pathway is thought to
link ceramide accumulation and insulin resistance arising from excess fatty acids [7]. The first committed step
of the de novo pathway is the condensation of L-serine
and palmitoyl-CoA by the rate-limiting enzyme, serine
C-palmitoyltransferase (SPT; EC 2.3.1.50). Pharmacological inhibition of SPT prevents ceramide accumulation and restores insulin action, placing SPT at the
centre of potential therapies to treat insulin resistance
[7, 8]. However, most studies to date have not actually
measured SPT activity, but rather have determined the
expression of the genes encoding the SPT subunits and
inferred changes in transferase activity [9, 10].
The aims of this study were to establish whether increased availability of plasma fatty acids is sufficient to
increase plasma ceramide levels and to determine whether
liver SPT activity mediates changes in plasma ceramides.
Methods
Acute fatty acid oversupply in vivo
Human lipid infusion The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved all experimental procedures
and participants provided written informed consent. Seven
healthy young women (mean±SEM: age 27±4 years; BMI
23±1 kg/m2
) participated in two experimental trials that were
randomised and separated by at least 7 days. Participants were
infused overnight (16 h) with saline (control; 0.55 ml kg–1 h–1
)
or lipid (Liposyn; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL;
0.55 ml kg–1 h–1
) and heparin (5 U kg–1 h–1) to increase
plasma NEFA concentrations to a high physiological level
(∼1.0 mmol/l). Further details of this experiment are described
in the electronic supplementary material (ESM) Methods.
Rat lipid infusion The Monash University School of Biomedical Sciences Animal Ethics Committee approved all procedures, and the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care were
followed. Adult male Wistar rats (Animal Resources Centre,
Perth, WA, Australia) with indwelling catheters placed into
the right and left jugular veins were deprived of food for 5 h
overnight. The lipid-infused group received 7% (vol./vol.)
Intralipid (Baxter Healthcare, Sydney, NSW, Australia;
1.7 ml/h) with heparin infusion (40 U/h) and control animals
were infused with 2.5% glycerol. The ceramide content in the
Intralipid emulsion was 88 nmol/l, thus the ceramide infusion
rate was 52 pmol/h. Both groups were infused for 5 h and rats
killed (Lethabarb; Virbac Animal Health, Sydney, Australia)
at the end of the infusion (5 h group) or 2 h (7 h) or 7 h (12 h)
after the cessation of the infusion. In a separate experiment,
rats were administered 100 μg/kg i.v. of myriocin (Sigma,
Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) 5 min prior to the infusion
protocol. Tissue and plasma samples were collected at the
end of the 5 h infusion. Further details are provided in the
ESM Methods.
In vitro ceramide synthesis and secretion
HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with
5 mmol/l glucose, 10% (vol./vol.) fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin/streptomycin. Assay medium was prepared from
stock fatty acid solutions (100 mmol/l palmitate dissolved in
100% ethanol) conjugated to 2% (wt/vol.) fatty acid-free BSA
in DMEM with 5 mmol/l glucose, 0.4 mmol/l L-serine and no
antibiotics. The duration and concentration of palmitate treatment are detailed in the related figure legend. For assessment
of radiolabelled L-serine incorporation into ceramide, the assay
media contained 0.5 mmol/l palmitate, 0.4 mmol/l L-serine,
and 1.11 MBq/ml L-[3
H]serine (Perkin Elmer, Glen Waverley,
VIC, Australia) and cells were incubated for 4 or 8 h. Further
details of this experiment can be found in the ESM Methods.
Analytical methods
Whole blood was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 90 s, and plasma
was analysed to determine free fatty acids (NEFA-C, Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Plasma (150 μl) and
tissue (10 mg) total ceramide were extracted and quantified
based on published methods [11] with minor modifications
[12]. Plasma ceramide species were determined as previously
described [13]. Serine C-palmitoyltransferase activity was
assessed as previously described [14] and further details can
be found in the ESM Methods.
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was extracted from whole liver using Qiazol and 1 μg
RNA was reverse transcribed (iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit,
2742 Diabetologia (2012) 55:2741–2746

BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed on a realplex Mastercycler
(Eppendorf, North Ryde, NSW, Australia) using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (ESM Table 1; Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). The relative quantification was calculated
using the ΔΔCt method, normalising values to the appropriate
control group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of a
statistics package (Graphpad Prism5; Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Differences among relevant groups were assessed using unpaired Student’s t
test, linear regression analysis, one-way ANOVA or
two-way ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer post hoc tests
as appropriate and noted in figure legends. A p value
≤0.05 was considered significant. Data are reported as
mean±SEM.
Results
Increasing fatty acid availability increases plasma ceramide
levels in humans and rats
Lipid infusion in humans increased plasma NEFA
(Fig. 1a) and plasma ceramide levels (Fig. 1b). Plasma
NEFA and ceramide concentrations were tightly correlated during the lipid infusion (Fig. 1c). A concomitant
increase in plasma NEFA (Fig. 1d) and plasma ceramide
(Fig. 1e) levels also occurred during the 5 h lipid
infusion in rats. The timing of the transient elevation
in plasma ceramide closely matched that of liver ceramide levels (Fig. 1f), which returned to pre-infusion levels within 2 h after cessation of the lipid infusion.
There was no change in liver SPT activity in lipidinfused rats (ESM Fig. 1). As mentioned in the Methods, the ceramide infusion rate was 52 pmol/h, which
cannot explain the increase in plasma ceramide levels of
15 μmol/l. Taken together, these results suggest that

plasma NEFAs increase liver ceramide levels and plasma ceramide secretion, independently of SPT.
Reducing SPT activity does not alter plasma ceramide level
in lipid-infused rats
We examined the role of SPT in modulating NEFA-induced
plasma ceramide production by blocking its activity with
myriocin. While myriocin reduced liver SPT activity by 28–
46% in rats (Fig. 1g), this did not affect circulating NEFA or
ceramide levels (Fig. 1h,i). These data argue that reducing
SPT activity by up to 50% does not affect NEFA-mediated
increases in plasma ceramides.
SPT activity is not altered in models of chronically elevated
fatty acid availability
In mice, high-fat feeding increased plasma ceramide levels
(ESM Fig. 2a) but did not affect liver ceramide content
(ESM Fig. 2b). Targeted analysis of ceramide metabolism
genes showed increased Sptlc2 expression with high-fat
feeding (ESM Fig. 2c), yet SPT activity was unaffected
(ESM Fig. 2d). Similarly, plasma NEFA levels (ESM
Fig. 3a) and liver and plasma ceramide levels (ESM
Fig. 3b,c) were increased in obese, hyperinsulinaemic
ob/ob mice compared with lean controls. These changes
were accompanied by increased expression of the genes
for the liver SPT subunits (ESM Fig. 3d), but no increase
in SPT activity (ESM Fig. 3e). These data reinforce the
hypothesis that plasma ceramide and liver SPT activity are
disconnected in murine models of obesity-associated fatty
acid oversupply.
Intracellular de novo ceramide synthesis increases ceramide
secretion in HepG2 liver cells
Palmitate incorporation into intracellular ceramide in HepG2
cells increased markedly above control levels across a broad
range of concentrations (Fig. 2a). According to 1-way
ANOVA, concentrations above 0.125 mmol/l did not further
augment the incorporation of palmitate into the intracellular
ceramide pool (Fig. 2a). This was attributed to an increase in
ceramide secretion, which increased linearly as a function of
palmitate concentration (Fig. 2b). In time course experiments,
the amount of palmitate incorporated into intracellular ceramide plateaued after 1 h of incubation and remained elevated
thereafter (Fig. 2c). By contrast, palmitate incorporation into

extracellular ceramide increased linearly with time (Fig. 2d),
suggesting that the newly synthesised ceramide was secreted
from liver cells. Similar patterns of de novo ceramide production and secretion were apparent when radiolabelled L-serine
was used as the SPT substrate (Fig. 2e,f). Collectively, these
data suggest that HepG2 liver cells secrete ceramide in a doseand time-dependent manner that is sensitive to intracellular de
novo ceramide synthesis.
Discussion
Ceramide accumulation in ectopic tissues promotes insulin
resistance, and recent studies have proposed that plasma
ceramides cause insulin resistance and inflammation and
increase atherosclerotic risk [2–4, 9]. The factors mediating the increase in plasma ceramides in obesity are not
well described and we sought to determine whether increasing fatty acid flux, which is a characteristic of obesity
and type 2 diabetes, modulates plasma ceramide levels.
We provide evidence that increasing fatty acid availability
is accompanied by an increase in plasma ceramide levels
in several independent experimental models, including
lipid and heparin infusion in humans and rats, high-fat
fed mice and ob/ob mice and cultured liver cells. We
showed in vivo that an increase in fatty acid availability
not only increased liver ceramide content, but also increased plasma ceramide concentrations over a similar
time course, indicating that ceramide secretion was
upregulated with ceramide production. In line with
this interpretation, our cell-based studies showed a close
relationship between intracellular de novo ceramide production and ceramide secretion. On the basis of these
complementary observations, we propose that the liver
detects intracellular ceramide levels with precision, and
increases ceramide secretion, which may protect the liver
from the pathogenic effects of intracellular ceramide accumulation (Fig. 2g). Thus, further investigations examining liver ceramide synthesis and packaging into
lipoproteins are warranted, as are further studies that delineate the potential role of plasma ceramides in metabolic
diseases.
We unexpectedly found that SPT enzyme activity was
not elevated in obese, insulin-resistant mice that have
increased plasma ceramide levels, and that reducing
liver SPT activity by ∼50% did not alter these levels.
These observations question the role of SPT as a ratelimiting factor for acutely regulating flux through the de
novo ceramide synthesis pathway in patho/physiological
settings and highlight that interventions modulating hepatic SPT activity may be unlikely to reduce plasma
ceramide concentrations in common chronic diseases
associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
