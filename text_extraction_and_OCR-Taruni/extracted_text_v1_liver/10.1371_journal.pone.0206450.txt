Abstract
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was shown to also occur in lean and underweight
patients. So far, the prevalence of NAFLD in underweight individuals with and without
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is insufficiently enlightened. In this cross-sectional age,
gender and disease-matched case-control study, underweight patients (BMI<18.5 kg/m2)
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5 T/3 T with fatsaturated fast-spin-echo imaging from 10/2005-07/2018 were analysed (control-to-caseratio 1:1, n = 130). All patients were additionally investigated for duration, history of surgery,
medical treatment, laboratory values, liver and spleen diameters. On MRI, liver fat was
quantified by two observers based on the relative signal loss on T2-weighted fast spin-echo
MR images with fat saturation compared to images without fat saturation. The prevalence of
NAFLD/liver steatosis, defined as a measured intrahepatic fat content of at least 5%, was
significantly higher in underweight IBD patients than in normal weight patients (87.6% versus 21.5%, p<0.001). Compared to the cases, the liver fat content of the controls was
reduced by -0.19 units on average (-19%; 95%Cl: -0.20; -0.14). Similar results were
obtained for the subgroup of non-IBD individuals (n = 12; -0.25 units on average (-25%);
95%Cl: -0.35; -0.14). Patients with extremely low body weight (BMI <17.5 kg/m2
) showed
the highest liver fat content (+0.15 units on average (+15%) compared to underweight
patients with a BMI of 17.5–18.5 kg/m2 (p<0.05)). Furthermore, underweight patients
showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters. There were no indications of
significant differences in disease duration, type of medications or surgery between cases
and controls and also, there were no significant differences between observers or field
strengths (p>0.05). The prevalence of liver steatosis was higher among underweight IBD
and non-IBD patients compared to normal weight controls. Also, underweight patients
showed slightly increased liver enzymes and liver diameters, hinting at initial metabolic
disturbances.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has increased over the past decades to become one
of the most common causes of chronic liver disease in Western countries [1, 2]. It is generally
considered a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and associated with obesity or central
adiposity [3]. Although metabolic risk factors are undoubtedly major causes for hepatic steatosis, it is known that it can also occur in normal weight and underweight patients [4]. With
regard to malnutrition, it was observed in the context of the refeeding process, but also as a
potential result from starvation-induced autophagy and metabolic dysfunction in the human
liver [5–7]. However, so far, the prevalence of NAFLD in underweight individuals is insufficiently enlightened.
Malnutrition with significantly low weight has long been recognized as showing detrimental effects on health and different organ functions, generally being defined by a body mass
index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 [8, 9]. While malnutrition is often associated with cancer, AIDS,
congestive heart failure or anorexia, it is also common in patients suffering from inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBDs). IBDs are characterized by a chronic remitting inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, encompassing Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [10]. Malnutrition and cachexia are particularly common in patients with active Crohn’s disease, but
nutritional deficiencies can also develop in patients with active ulcerative colitis [11]. The frequency reported for undernutrition in active IBD patients ranges from 25% to 69.9% and
severe undernutrition was previously found in up to 31.6% of the patients [12]. Furthermore,
IBD are frequently associated with extraintestinal manifestations, including the liver. For
patients with IBD, the prevalence of NAFLD has been estimated between 8–40%, showing no
difference between CD and UC [13–15]. So far, apart from bowel surgery and medication,
especially metabolic risk factors and obesity were suggested to affect the presence of NAFLD
[14, 15]. However, a recent study described NAFLD in nearly 40% of the IBD patients with a
mean body mass index (BMI) of 21 kg/m2
, but without examining the influence body weight
[13].
The aim of this study was to test whether low weight is associated with steatosis on magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a cross-sectional age-, genderand disease-matched retrospective case-control study, comparing the presence of NAFLD in
IBD patients with significantly low weight to IBD patients with normal weight. In a smaller
cohort, patients without systemic disease, but significantly low underweight, were compared
to healthy patients with normal weight. To exclude potential confounders, we also assessed
previously acknowledged risk factors for NAFLD, such as medical treatment or bowel surgery.
Methods
This retrospective study was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and declarations and approved by the Institutional Review Board (Charite´’s Ethics Commission, EA4/
054/18), including a formal waiver of informed consent. For confidentiality and ethical considerations, the retrospective data used encrypted identification of the individuals, with the identification numbers of the individuals being transformed using random number strings.
Medical records of underweight patients, who underwent diagnostic evaluation at our institution between October, 2005 and July, 2018, were reviewed. Indication for MRI were mainly
evaluation and follow-up of inflammatory bowel disease, including e.g. detection of potential
fistula and perianal inflammation or assessment of treatment response. In the twelve underweight patients without IBD and the corresponding controls, MRI was performed to exclude
tumor disease or IBD (in view of a previous weight loss) or because of abdominal pain. In
five cases, the primary indication for MRI was the detection of a possible liver disease.

For each of the included patients (n = 61), an age-, gender- and disease-matched control
with normal weight was obtained (n = 61). The primary outcomes were the frequency of
NAFLD/ degree of hepatic steatosis detected by MRI in patients with significantly low weight,
compared to an age-, gender- and disease-matched group of patients with normal weight.
Inclusion / Exclusion criteria and study groups
For the cases, inclusion criteria were all patients with (1) underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2),
who had received (2) abdominal MRI (including T2 HASTE sequences with and without fat
saturation) at our institution. For the controls, inclusion criteria were patients with (1) normal
weight (BMI of 20–24.9 kg/m2
, according to the normal weight definition of the World Health
Organization) and (2) MRI performed at our institution (same imaging criteria as for case
groups). Exclusion criteria were patients with known viral hepatitis B and/or C infection,
drug-abuse, alcohol-related liver disease and hereditary/metabolic liver diseases, such as
hemochromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson’s disease, autoimmune hepatitis,
familial hypercholesterolemia, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis or
celiac disease [16, 17]. Patients receiving parental nutrition were also excluded. The assessment
of alcohol consumption relied on prior clinical evaluation (history taking) and was considered
significant, if at any time there was an indication of alcoholism, alcohol abuse or treatment of
an alcohol-related diagnosis in the electronic medical records. In addition, medical files were
searched for alcohol-associated diagnoses in the 5 years prior to the MRI examination.
The cases were divided into a first group who had received MRI at 1.5 T and a second
group who had received MRI at 3 T. The 1.5 T group consisted of 25 patients (19 women, 6
men, average age 31.8 ± 9.8 years, average BMI 17.3 ± 1.5 kg/m2
). Out of these, 24 patients
were diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and 1 patient with ulcerative colitis. The 3 T group consisted of 36 patients (21 women, 15 men, average age 30 ± 8.1 years, average BMI was
17.1 ± 1.2 kg/m2
), with 23 patients being diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, 5 patients with ulcerative colitis and 8 patients suffering from indistinct stomach pains without diagnosis of physical disorders.
The age-, gender- and disease-matched controls (control-to-case ratio 1:1) consisted of
patients with normal weight, who were examined at 1.5 T (matched to first case group) or at 3
T (matched to second case group). For each patient in the two case groups, a control with normal BMI and matched age (± 2 years), gender and disease was obtained. For the 1.5 T control
group. the average age was 32.0 ± 9.7 years and average BMI was 22.1 ± 1.5 kg/m2
. For the 3T
control group, the average age was 22.6 ± 9.1 years and average BMI was 22.6 ± 1.7 kg/m2
.
Diagnoses of CD or UC were given after a combined evaluation of symptoms, abdominal
imaging, endoscopy and histology. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made based on MRI of the
liver, which included a T1 weighted sequence and T2-weighted sequences with and without fat
saturation.
Clinical study variables
Demographic and clinical data were collected and all of the included patients were examined
by nutrition or IBD specialists. In patients with IBD, variables such as the type of IBD (CD/
UC), surgical therapies (type of bowel loss) were considered. Furthermore, prior and current
medical treatments were assessed, including systemic therapies with corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic agents (5 ASA) or immunomodulators (e.g. azathioprine. 6-mercaptopurine), which
might promote the development of NAFLD, but also therapies with biological agents (TNF-αinhibitors) or immunosuppressant medications such as cyclosporine without known effects on
hepatic steatosis. In addition, laboratory values acquired around the date of the MRI (< 6

albumin (Alb) (g/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
(U/L), alkaline phosphatase (AP) (U/L) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (U/L).
MRI technique
MRI was performed on a 3 T scanner with 64 channels (Magnetom Skyra™, Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and on 1.5 T scanners with 16/48 channels (Magnetom Avanto/Aera, Siemens
Healthcare, Germany). The patients in this study underwent a routine abdominal imaging
protocol, including: axial T1 FLASH, axial/coronal T2 HASTE and axial/coronal T2 HASTE
fatsat (see Table 1 for tabulated imaging parameters).
Image interpretation
All images were analysed by use of Amira 5.3.2 (Visage Imaging, San Diego, USA). The programme was also used to assess the volumetric data, allowing to select any plane of view. The
signal intensity values of regions of interest (ROI) in the liver and spleen were visually assessed
on T1-weighted images and recorded on T2-weighted MR-images with and without fat saturation.[18] The ROIs were drawn to be around 1 cm with a circular tool. Three ROIs were
obtained in the liver (one in the left lobe, two in the right lobe) in three sections and selected to
include levels above, at, and below the portal vein. Regions of vessels and artefacts were
avoided and the standard deviation of the signal intensity measurement within the ROIs was
kept below 10%. To account for signal heterogeneity, the signal intensity of the liver was
recorded as the average measurement of two readers from the nine respective ROIs placed in
the liver. The signal intensity of the spleen was measured with a 1 cm ROI, placed in three different sections of the spleen. The mean signal intensity was calculated from three ROIs in different sections as an average measurement of the two readers.
The liver fat was quantified on the T2-weighted images as the relative loss of signal intensity
on fat-saturated MRI images with the following formula: (SInonfat—SIfat/SInonfat) � 100, with SI

being the mean liver signal intensity divided by the mean spleen signal intensity [18]. SInonfat
refers to images without fat-saturation and SIfat to images with fat saturation [18].
Due to the acknowledged effects of liver fat on the signal intensity of fat-saturated MR
images, we considered the measurement of relative signal intensity loss to be an adequate
approximation of the actual difference in the amount of liver fat in underweight and normal
weight patients.
Liver fat content was graded on a 0–3 scale, whereby grade 0 (normal) referred to absence
of steatosis with a measured liver fat content of less than 5%, grade 1 (mild) was associated
with a liver fat content of 5–33%, grade 2 (moderate) referred to a liver fat content of 34% to
66% and grade 3 (severe) showed a liver fat content of 67% or greater [19].
Liver and spleen size measurements
Diameters were measured in straight lines using axial and coronal MR images. They were measured in maximum extension in craniocaudal, anteroposterior and transverse distances and
also as a craniocaudal distance in the mid-clavicular line [20].
To estimate the volume of the spleen, the splenic index was calculated, based on the maximum craniocaudal diameter, the maximum dimension on the axial scan and the maximum
thickness on the axial scan. The upper limit for splenomegaly was set at 480 [21].
Calculation of NAFLD and FIB-4-scores
Both the NAFLD (NFS) and the FIB-4 score are indicators of liver fibrosis. The NFS aims to
differentiate between NAFLS patients without (F0-F2) and with (F3-F4) advanced liver fibrosis, selecting two cut-off points for the presence (> 0.676) and absence (< -1.455) of significant
fibrosis [22]. A higher NFS was found to be a surrogate marker for the progression of liver
fibrosis, being significantly predictive of death in patients with NAFLD [23]. The FIB-4 score
is alternative scoring system for ruling out advanced stages of fibrosis, with a score below 1.45
having a negative predictive value of over 90% for advanced liver fibrosis and a score of over
3.25 having a positive predictive value of 65% for advanced fibrosis with a specificity of 97%
[24].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with “R” Statistical Software (Version 3.4.0. R Development
Core Team. 2017). Data were expressed as means ± standard deviations. The distribution of
continuous variables, such as years of disease or laboratory values, were visualized by violin
plots. Student t-tests were used for continuous variables and chi-squared (χ2
) test was used for
dichotomous variables. Univariable and descriptive analyses were performed to assess the distribution of study variables and the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Regression models were used to assess if underweight as the tested influencing factor for

NAFLD (age-, gender- and disease-matched controls) was potentially confounded by covariates such as prior or present medication or history of surgery. Therefore, the regression model
for each covariate used the dichotomized covariate as a target and the identification of patient
groups (cases/controls) as an influencing factor. In a sub-analysis, a regression model, adjusted
for age, gender and field strength, was used to assess if the degree of steatosis was higher in
patients with severe underweight (<17.5). If necessary, logarithmic transformation was used
to reduce skewness prior to regression analysis. Interobserver reproducibility and possible differences were analyzed using linear regression analyses. In addition, Bland-Altman plots with
prediction intervals were computed for the measured data to display the distribution of measurements as well as the limits of agreement. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Study population
A total of 61 age-, gender- and disease-matched underweight patients and 61 normal weight
controls received abdominal MRI with fat saturated T2-weighted sequences at our institution
(25 patients at 1.5 T, 36 patients at 3T) and were used for analysis. Out of these, 47 patients suffered from Crohn’s disease, 6 patients had a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had
symptoms of abdominal pain, but no physical diagnosis. Characteristics of study patients are
shown in Table 2. 29 patients were severely underweight (n = 10 for 1.5 T, n = 19 for 3T). The
mean age was 30.9 ± 8.9 and there were 41 females (67.2%) and 20 males (32.8%).
Comparison of characteristics of underweight and normal weight patients
The bottom part of Table 2 summarizes the prevalence of NAFLD/steatosis in the underweight
cases and the normal weight age-, gender and diseased-matched controls. The prevalence of
NAFLD/steatosis, which is defined as a measured intrahepatic fat content of at least 5%, is
shown to be significantly higher in underweight patients compared to normal weight patients
(88.5% versus 23%, p < 0.001). While 11 underweight patients (18%) showed moderate steatosis with a liver fat content of more than 33%, there was only 1 (1.6%) normal weight control
with a liver fat content of more than 25%. None of the patients were associated with severe
steatosis and a fat liver content above 66%. See Fig 1 for with visualization of steatosis in
underweight study patients compared to normal weight controls. It presents case examples of

moderate and mild steatosis in a severely underweight patient compared to normal weight
controls, examined with T1 weighted images at 3T and 1.5T, providing the corresponding T2
weighted images with and without fat saturation for the two underweight patients with
steatosis.
Evaluation of differences of T2-based liver fat quantification
Lower BMI values in underweight patients were significantly associated with higher liver fat
content (refer to Fig 2). Patients from the underweight study population showed significantly
higher liver fat percentages. By comparison, the liver fat content of the controls was reduced
by -0.18 units on average (18%) (95% Cl: -0.21; -0.14). There were no significant differences
between the observers or at different field strengths (p > 0.05).
If the analysis of liver fat content was repeated for the small subgroup of underweight individuals without IBD (n = 8), similar results were obtained. Compared to the underweight
cases, the liver fat content of the controls was reduced by -0.23 units on average (23%) (95%
Cl: -0.33; -0.13]). Consequently, underweight patients without diagnosis showed significantly
higher liver fat percentages (p < 0.05). Refer to Fig 3 for visualization of the differences in percentage relative liver fat content between cases and controls.
Sub-analysis for patients with extremely low body weight
Patients with extremely low body weight (BMI <17.5 kg/m2, n = 29) showed significantly
increased liver fat percentages compared to underweight patients with a BMI of 15-5-18.5 kg/
m2 (p < 0.05). A linear regression model, which was adjusted for age, gender and field
strength, demonstrated that the liver fat content of patients with extremely low body weight
was increased by 0.14 units (14%) on average (95% CI: 0.08; 0.19).
Comparison of medical treatments and surgical therapies
To investigate whether the type of medical treatments and surgical therapies would differ
between the case group and the control group, a logistic regression model was used. There
were no indications of significant differences in the type of medications between cases and
controls (all p-values > 0.05). With regard to surgery, underweight cases had prior colon
resections more frequently compared to normal weight controls (22.0% versus 10.2%, refer to
Table 3). However, the difference was not significant (χ2 = 7.97, p = 0.08), which was confirmed by the multinomial logistic regression model applied. In addition, disease duration,
(steroid) medication, extent of bowel surgery and c-reactive protein (CRP) showed no significant association with hepatic steatosis for both cases and controls (p > 0.05).
Comparison of years of disease
The mean difference in the distribution of disease years for cases and controls was 0.39 years
(95% confidence interval (CI): -3.22; 2.44). If it was additionally adjusted for age and gender
using a linear model, there was a mean difference of 0.2 years (95% uncertainty interval:-2.28;
2.69). Among patients with steatosis/NAFLD the mean age at the time of diagnosis of IBD was
25.7 ± 6.8 years compared to 26.1 ± 6.0 years for the controls. As a consequence, no significant

image. The left part of the figure shows the corresponding T2 images without (1a, 3a) and with (1b, 3b) fat saturation,
revealing a relative signal loss of 36% (1b) or 23% (1b).

difference could be observed with regard to the mean years of disease between the cases and
controls (p > 0.05).
Comparison of laboratory values
Fig 4 displays the distribution of laboratory values between the cases and controls. Both the ttest and the linear model measured significant differences in the distributions of AST, AP and
GGT, with the cases showing increased average values (refer to Table 4). For the normal weight
controls, the risk of finding laboratory parameters above the upper limit is significantly
reduced (interval of odds ratios below one), while the risk of observing laboratory values above
the limit is significantly increased for the underweight study patients. The logistic regression
analysis also recognizes a similar correlation for the laboratory value ALT, with a higher number of patients with NAFLD showing an elevated ALT (25.5% vs. 10.2%; p � 0.05). Fig 5 displays laboratory values as mean percentages of the upper limit of normal with the
corresponding standard deviations.

The maximum craniocaudal and transversal diameters were also slightly higher for the cases
compared to the controls (maximum craniocaudal: 20.4 ± 2.6 cm vs. 19.5 ± 2.3 cm, transversal:
14.8 ± 2.3 cm vs. 15.7 ± 1.6 cm), but these differences did not reach significance level
(p > 0.05). Taking diameter measurements as an estimate for liver size, it can be assumed that
study patients showed marginally enlarged livers at most, however, with higher diameters
compared to controls.
Comparison of spleen size measurements
For 1.5T, the splenic index was 501.3 ± 205.5 for cases and 409 ± 134.2 for controls and for 3T,
the splenic index was 491.3 ± 216.3 for cases and 398.0 ± 111.1 for controls. For both 1.5 T and
3T, no significant differences in spleen size could be observed between cases and controls,
although the spleen index in the case groups tended to be higher with a trend for statistical significance (1.5 T: p = 0.06; 3 T: p = 0.12).
Assessment of NAFLD and FIB-4-scores
While the NFS and the FIB-4 score were slightly higher for the cases compared to the controls
(NFS—1.5T: -24.8 versus -26.6; 3T: -26.9 versus -27.6) (FIB-4–1.5T: 0.043 versus 0.039; 3T:
0.040 versus 0.037, these differences did not reach significance. Furthermore, based on the
scores we found no cases suspicious of advanced liver fibrosis. This is in accordance with our
MRI results, where we observed multiple cases of mild to moderate steatosis in underweight
(IBD) patients, but could not find any signs of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.
Interobserver agreement
The visual illustration of interobserver agreement for the measurement of the liver fat percentages, adjusted by field strengths as well as cases/controls, is provided by the Bland-Altmanplots in Fig 6, displaying the distribution of measurements and the limits of agreement.
Discussion
This case-control study assessed the frequency of NAFLD in patients with significantly low
body weight compared to patients with normal weight. Underweight patients demonstrated
significantly higher liver fat percentages compared to the normal weight patients, corresponding to mild to moderate liver steatosis. Also, underweight patients showed slightly increased
liver enzymes and liver diameters, hinting at initial metabolic disturbances.
NAFLD is a global public health problem and one of the most common causes of chronic
liver disease. Although simple fatty liver is a benign condition, 10–20% can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which dramatically increases the risk for cirrhosis and endstage liver disease [25]. Currently, NAFLD is widely considered a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome in close relation to obesity. In patients with IBD, NAFLD was previously
reported in approximately 10% of the cases [26], whereby, apart from medication and bowel
surgery, it was similarly linked to increasing metabolic risk factors and overweight. However,
NAFLD was also found to occur in lean as well as severely underweight subjects [7, 27].
To our knowledge, in the context of IBD, the presence of NAFLD has not been examined in
underweight patients so far. It is possible, that it may frequently be unnoticed in this collective.
Previous studies on NAFLD might have underestimated the prevalence of mild to moderate
hepatic steatosis in lean to underweight patients due to most of them being ultrasound-based
with poor accuracy for hepatic steatosis < 30% [28]. Especially mild steatosis might constitute
an important proportion among underweight patients with IBD.

Although the phenotype of IBD is changing with the prevalence of obesity and overweight
patients gradually rising [29], approximately one in six patients still suffer from significant
malnutrition, often related to more severe forms of disease and accompanied by self-imposed
food restriction behaviour [30]. Apart from the acknowledged influence of medication and
bowel surgery, presence of NAFLD in underweight IBD patients could, furthermore, be an
indicator of and independent and different pathophysiology, which is not associated with obesity or insulin resistance [31, 32].
While compared to the general population, IBD patients usually have a lower BMI and a
lower prevalence of metabolic risk factors [14], within IBD populations, IBD patients with
NAFLD have been found to be older, more often with a higher average BMI and more often

diabetics [32]. Taking into account the severity of IBD, Sartini et al. suggested the prevalence
of different IBD phenotype, with less aggressive forms of IBD being associated with mild-tomoderate steatosis, and more severe forms of IBD with frequent relapses being related to
severe steatosis at ultrasound [31]. As in the current study, regarding IBD activity assessment,
there were no data available on endoscopic severity or clinical activity indices, it cannot be
excluded, that lower weight IBD patients suffered from higher disease activity compared to
normal weight IBD patients, even though showing a similar distribution of disease duration,
(steroid) medication and bowel surgery [33]. But to this end, our results would be in contrast
to Sartini et al., as in the present study, underweight patients with possibly higher disease activity had mild-to-moderate instead of severe steatosis. With a subgroup of twelve underweight
patients without IBD showing a 25% higher liver fat content compared to the corresponding
normal weight non-IBD controls, the results of the present study may hint at a synergistic
effect of IBD and malnutrition in the pathogenesis of IBD, with underweight NAFLD representing a distinct entity. However, larger numbers of underweight non-IBD patients with normal weight controls are needed to support this hypothesis.
To date, evidence for the relationship between underweight and NAFLD remains scarce. A
previous study, developing a malnutrition animal model, suggested that severe malnutrition
might lead to an impaired function of liver mitochondria and a loss of peroxisomes, which are
important to maintain the normal liver function [7]. Another example is the widely-used
methionine and choline-deficient diet (MCD) mouse model, in which mice submitted to the
MCD diet lose weight, but show fat accumulation in the liver due to beta-oxidation of fatty
acids and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) with resulting triglycerides export from the
cell [34, 35]. Furthermore, in some cases NAFLD can also by driven by single-nucleotide polymorphisms, such as in the gene for phospholipase A3 (PNPLA43). PNPLA43 was strongly
associated with increased triglycerides in the hepatic content due to increased lipogenesis, but
at the same time shown to be independent of overweight or diabetes, so that it might not have
any influence on metabolic syndrome components and may also be present in lean individuals
[36]. A recent longitudinal study by Hagstro¨m et al. found that lean patients with NAFLD,
while showing lower stages of fibrosis and not having an increased risk of overall mortality,
were at a higher risk of severe liver disease, independent of available confounders [37]. This
highlights the fact that NAFLD in lean or underweight patients is not a simple benign condition. Studies focusing on severely malnourished patients with anorexia found elevated liver
enzymes as indicating NAFLD to be common, especially in patients with very low body weight
(BMI < 12 kg/m2
) [6, 38, 39]. Anorexia-induced lipolysis was discovered to promote late triglyceride and free fatty acid accumulation in the liver and kidney [40]. A previous study suggested an increase in intrahepatic lipid content, following 36 hours of fasting, with a direct
association to plasma levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate, which might also serve as an explanation for
exacerbations of NAFLD with steatohepatitis seen in patients with anorexia nervosa [41].
At our institution, we observed that patients with significant underweight often showed
fatty liver on MRI scans, which was confirmed by the results of the present analysis. Comparing the cases and controls, no significant difference could be found with regard to the general
use of medical therapies, especially including potentially hepatotoxic medications such as corticosteroids, immunomodulators or 5-amino-salicylic acids. Regarding a possible association
between IBD disease activity and fatty liver, Carr et al. previously reported an absent association between IBD severity and degree of NAFLD [42]. Even though in the present study IBD
disease activity was not assessed with regard to endoscopic severity or clinical activity indices,
activity-related parameters such as disease duration, (steroid) medication, extent of bowel surgery and c-reactive protein (CRP) showed no significant association with hepatic steatosis for
both cases and controls. While prior studies on NAFLD in IBD patients reported mean ages of
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in underweight patients with inflammatory bowel disease
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206450 November 14, 2018 15 / 21

approximately 45 years [15, 43, 44], the present population has a strikingly lower average age
of approximately 30 years. Initial steatosis in young underweight IBD patients may thus have
been underestimated previously.
NAFLD includes different forms of liver disease, such as simple steatosis, non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma [45]. The
transition from steatosis to steatohepatitis, so far, remains insufficiently enlightened. The role
played by the gut in NAFLD is still controversial, even though animal and human studies supported the relevance of a gut derived endotoxin [46]. In the gut-liver-axis the main players are
the microbiota of the gut, gut-derived bacterial components and the intestinal barrier. Changes
in microbiology and intestinal permeability can promote the translocation of bacterial components into the portal vein, the activation of inflammation by signalling in hepatocytes and
finally the transition from simple steatosis to NASH [47]. A previous study by Miele et al.
found intestinal permeability to be increased in patients with NAFLD and to correlate with
severity of steatosis, suggesting it to be important in the pathogenesis of hepatic fat deposition
[48]. However, further advances in the understanding of the gut-liver-axis are warranted, as
this may improve management of liver diseases in the future. Currently, it remains questionable, if NASH will be treated as an infectious disease [49].
In our study population, there was no suspicion of NASH in any of the patients. Regarding
fibrosis serum markers, AST, ALT, platelet count, GGT, bilirubin and albumin were available
for the majority of patients. However, non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis, such as the NAFLD
score or FIB-4-score did not identify any cases suspicious of advanced liver fibrosis. As NASH
was previously described to be more common and potentially more progressive in the setting
of diabetes mellitus, overweight and older age[50], a possible explanation for the apparent
absence of NASH in the present NAFLD population could be the lack of diabetes disease,
lower weight and young age. But even low-to-moderate steatosis without signs of NASH, as
was found in the present study, carries a clinical burden and was previously linked to severe
liver disease and cardiovascular risk [51].
As NAFLD is mostly silent, it is often discovered accidentally through clinical examination
in form of hepatomegaly, imaging or elevated liver enzymes at a later stage. In the clinical setting, NAFLD is usually diagnosed via abdominal ultrasound (US), as liver biopsies are not
practically feasible for assessing NAFLD, while they are essential for diagnosis of NASH and
differentiation of NAFLD from NASH, despite being limited by sampling variability [52]. Previous research on NAFLD included liver biopsy data, which are recognized as the key test for
chronic liver disease, but, given their invasiveness, carry the risk for procedural complications,
such as bleedings [53]. One study included 108 NAFLD patients with serial liver biopsies more
than a year apart, finding progression of steatosis to NASH in 44% of the patients with baseline
NAFLD [54]. Dela Cruz et al. presented more than 1,000 patients with biopsy-confirmed
NAFLD and BMI values < 25 kg/m2
, finding NAFLD patients with normal BMI to have a
higher mortality compared to NAFLD patients with overweight [55]. There are far less biopsies
in the literature for IBD patients. McGowan et al. recently reported a series of seven patients
with Crohn’s Disease and biopsy proven NAFLD [14] and Sourianarayanane et al. reported six
NAFLD patients with liver biopsies. [15] A prospective analysis of 200 ulcerative colitis
patients found biopsy-proven NAFLD in 11.2% of the patients [56].
While US, due to its cost-effectiveness, is the most frequently used imaging tool for diagnosis of NAFLD, it has a low accuracy for detecting mild steatosis [57]. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), by contrast, is regarded as the most accurate practical method for measuring
fatty liver in clinical practice and—other than US and computed tomography (CT), which
evaluate hepatic steatosis through parameters such as echogenicity and attenuation, enables
direct measurement of the quantity of hepatic fat [57]. At this, MRI achieves sensitivities and

specificities of 76.7–91% and 80–87% in detecting histologic steatosis � 5%.[58, 59] Also, MRI
is the modality of choice for non-invasive quantification of steatosis. Qayyum et al. previously
developed a simple method for liver fat quantification, based on T2 weighted imaging with fat
saturation, and compared it to out-of-phase-gradient-echo-imaging, indicating that it was
more robust for fat quantification [18]. Therefore, we made use of this proposed method in
the present study. The fact that the measured liver fat quantity did not significantly differ
between 1.5 T and 3 T supports the clinical applicability of this approach.
With regard to clinical practice, we would recommend not only the monitoring of conventional NAFLD risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes or BMI/waist circumference,
but also the non-invasive monitoring of liver steatosis in significantly underweight (IBD)
patients. Especially patients with IBD, who often undergo frequent MRI in clinical routine,
could benefit from the additional evaluation of MRI scans with regard to steatosis to recognize
early changes in the liver tissue.
Further investigations are needed in NAFLD patients to identify possible factors other than
metabolic pathogenic IBD-related causes and also, specifically in a set of underweight patients
without diagnosis of physical disorders, to better understand the association between relevant
underweight and liver disease.
The present study has several limitations, which need to be acknowledged in the interpretation of the outcomes: Firstly, this cross-sectional case-control study is retrospective. Secondly,
diagnosis of NAFLD was based on MRI and no liver biopsy was performed. However, due to
its invasiveness and the possibility of false negative results due to sampling a relatively small
area, liver biopsies are not practically feasible for diagnosis of NAFLD in general [60]. As a
consequence, MRI is regarded as the most accurate practical method for measuring fatty liver
in clinical practice, with a higher diagnostic performance compared to US and CT. However,
fat suppression may be imperfect, e.g. due to inhomogeneities in the magnetic field. Furthermore, spectral complexity of fat and T2 decay may result in discrepancies between the true fat
fraction and the apparent fraction, measured with MRI. Another aspect is, that two different
field strengths (1.5T/3T) were used. However, we could not find any significant differences
regarding the results of liver fat quantification with similar liver fat content measurements for
1.5T and 3T. The reproducibility of MR-based liver fat quantification across different field
strength is also supported by previous research [61, 62]. Furthermore, due to the assessment of
alcohol consumption relying on prior clinical evaluation in the medical records, it cannot be
ruled out that individual patients may have exceeded cut-off limits for alcohol consumption
(20 g/d for women and 30 g/d for men) [63]. Finally, the effect of weight gain on NAFLD
could not be considered, which would have been interesting, as a previous study suggested,
that in patients suffering from anorexia with severe malnutrition, steatosis especially occurred
in the process of refeeding [39].
Conclusions
Underweight patients showed a higher risk for mild to moderate NAFLD compared to the
matched controls with normal weight. Presence of fatty liver in underweight patients should
not be neglected, as it could indicate a higher risk for metabolic disorders or even hint at a different entity of non-metabolic NAFLD. Further investigations, specifically in a set of underweight patients without diagnosis of physical disorders are needed to better understand the
association between relevant underweight and liver disease.
