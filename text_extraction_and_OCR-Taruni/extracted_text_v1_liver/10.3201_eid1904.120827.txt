The recent discovery of hepatitis E virus (HEV) strains 
in rabbits in the People’s Republic of China and the United 
States revealed that rabbits are another noteworthy 
reservoir of HEV. However, whether HEV from rabbits can 
infect humans is unclear. To study the zoonotic potential for 
and pathogenesis of rabbit HEV, we infected 2 cynomolgus 
macaques and 2 rabbits with an HEV strain from rabbits in 
China. Typical hepatitis developed in both monkeys; they 
exhibited elevated liver enzymes, viremia, virus shedding 
in fecal specimens, and seroconversion. Comparison of the 
complete genome sequence of HEV passed in the macaques 
with that of the inoculum showed 99.8% nucleotide identity. 
Rabbit HEV RNA (positive- and negative-stranded) was 
detectable in various tissues from the experimentally 
infected rabbits, indicating that extrahepatic replication may 
be common. Thus, HEV is transmissible from rabbits to 
cynomolgus macaques, which suggests that rabbits may be 
a new source of human HEV infection.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent of acute hepatitis E, which is endemic to many developing 
countries and occurs sporadically in some industrialized 
countries. HEV is a small nonenveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of ≈7.2 kb; it is 
currently classified as the sole member of the genus Hepevirus, family Hepeviridae (1). Thus far, at least 4 genotypes, which comprise a single serotype, of HEV have been 
identified in mammals: genotypes 1 and 2 are restricted to 
strains that infect humans, and genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic (2). More recently, a putative fifth HEV genotype was 
identified in wild boars in Japan (3). HEV from chickens, 
which is phylogenetically distinct from HEV from mammals, is likely to be classified as a new genus within the 
family Hepeviridae (4).
The zoonotic nature of HEV was first confirmed 
in 1997 with the identification of HEV isolates in swine 
in the United States, which were most closely related to 
an isolate of HEV from a person in the United States, 
and this isolate could experimentally infect nonhuman 
primates (5,6). Zoonotic transmission of HEV was further 
substantiated with the demonstration of HEV infection in 
persons after they ate undercooked infected meat from wild 
boars and wild deer (7,8). Antibodies against HEV have 
been detected in numerous animal species, including dogs, 
cats, sheep, goats, horses, cattle, bison, and rats; and HEV 
strains have been genetically identified from domestic and 
wild pigs, chickens, deer, mongooses, and rabbits (4,9). 
The recent discoveries of HEV-like viruses in rats and fish 
have further broadened understanding of the host range and 
diversity of HEV (10–12).
The first strain of rabbit HEV was isolated from Rex 
Rabbits on 2 rabbit farms in Gansu, People’s Republic of 
China (13). Additional studies indicated that rabbit HEV 
was prevalent among various breeds of farmed rabbits 
throughout much of China, and the prevalence of antibodies 
against HEV was 57.0% in Lanzhou and 54.6% in Beijing 
(13–15). Rabbit HEV has also been isolated from rabbits 
in Virginia, USA, which showed a high prevalence of 
antibodies against HEV (36%) and HEV RNA (16.5%) 
(16). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that rabbit HEV was 
most closely related to genotype 3 HEV, which has been 
confirmed to infect humans. Furthermore, a recent study 
indicated that rabbit HEV is antigenically related to the 
other known animal strains of HEV and is experimentally 
transmissible to swine (17). However, to our knowledge, 
no study had determined the zoonotic potential of rabbit 
HEV. Therefore, in this study, we endeavored to ascertain 
whether rabbit HEV can cross species barriers and infect 
nonhuman primates and to further clarify the pathogenesis 
and replication of rabbit HEV in its natural host.

RESEARCH
Materials and Methods
Virus Inocula
The rabbit HEV strain (CHN-BJ-R14) used in this 
study was originally recovered from the feces of a farmed 
Rex Rabbit in the suburbs of Beijing in 2011. The fecal 
sample was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 
(pH 7.4) containing 1% bovine serum albumin to make 
a 10% (wt/vol) suspension. The clarified suspension was 
subsequently filtered through 0.45-μm and 0.22-μm filters. 
Titers of the rabbit HEV inoculum were determined by a 
semiquantitative nested reverse transcription PCR (RTnPCR) (18), and the titer was 104
 genome equivalents (GE) 
per milliliter (mL).
Animals
Two juvenile male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca 
fascicularis), weighing 2.0–2.5 kg, designated as Cy1 and 
Cy2, were obtained from the Beijing Xierxing Institute of 
Biologic Resources (Beijing, China) for the cross-species 
infection study. For the rabbit infection study, four 7-weekold specific-pathogen free (SPF) New Zealand white rabbits, 
weighing 750–1,000 g, were obtained from the Department 
of Laboratory Animal Science of Peking University Health 
Science Center. Preinoculation serum and feces specimens 
were collected once a week for 3 weeks, and all animals 
were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to establish 
a baseline, and were confirmed as negative for antibodies 
against HEV by an ELISA and negative for HEV RNA 
by RT-nPCR. The animal experiments were approved by 
the Committee of Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics, 
Peking University Health Science Center. The regulations 
of the review committee of Laboratory Animal Welfare 
and Ethics and the protocol for the review on Laboratory 
Animal Welfare and Ethics, Peking University Health 
Science Center, were followed.
Experimental Inoculation of Nonhuman Primates 
To determine whether rabbit HEV strains are 
transmissible to nonhuman primates, we inoculated 
intravenously 2 cynomolgus monkeys, housed separately, 
with 2 mL of the rabbit HEV inoculum. After inoculation, 
serial serum and fecal samples were collected 2×/week for 
16 weeks.
Serum samples were tested for ALT levels and for IgM 
and IgG against HEV. All samples were also assayed for 
HEV RNA by RT-nPCR (15).
Experimental Infection of Rabbits 
To clarify the extrahepatic replication sites of HEV, 
rabbits were experimentally infected with rabbit HEV as 
described (19). In brief, 4 SPF rabbits, which were housed 
in separate cages, were divided randomly into 2 groups 
(2 rabbits per group) and inoculated intravenously with 
either 1 mL of PBS (negative control) or 1 mL of rabbit 
HEV inoculum. Serum and fecal specimens were collected 
weekly after inoculation. Serum samples were tested for 
ALT activity and HEV RNA. Fecal specimens were also 
assayed for HEV RNA. If serum and fecal specimens 
became simultaneously positive for HEV RNA, a complete 
necropsy was performed of each rabbit. Bile and various 
different types of tissues and organs, including liver, 
kidney, small intestine, spleen, stomach, heart, brain, 
bladder, and lung, were collected and stored at -80°C. 
To prevent cross-contamination during necropsy, we used 
individually wrapped, sterile disposable materials and new 
sterile scalpel blades for each sample.
Approximately 100 mg of each tissue and organ was 
homogenized in 1 mL of sterile PBS (pH 7.4) to make 
10% (wt/vol) suspensions and clarified by centrifugation 
at 4,500 g for 10 min at 4°C. Thereafter, 100 µL 
of the clarified supernatants was used for total viral 
RNA extraction, and positive-stranded and negativestranded HEV RNA were detected by RT-nPCR as 
described below.
Determination of ALT Levels
All serum samples were tested immediately for 
ALT levels with a Hitachi Automatic Clinical Analyzer 
7180 (Hitachi High-Technologies, Tokyo, Japan), by 
using chemical reagents purchased from Roche (Basel, 
Switzerland), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Biochemical evidence of hepatitis was recorded when the 
serum ALT level exceeded the baseline ALT level by >2-
fold, as defined by a peak ALT value that was equal to or 
greater than double the prechallenge values (19,20).
ELISA to Detect Antibodies against HEV 
The serum specimens collected from monkeys were 
tested for IgM and IgG against HEV by using an ELISA 
based on the virus E2 protein (amino acids 394–606 of 
HEV open reading frame [ORF] 2) (20), according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Wantai, Beijing, China). The 
serum samples collected from rabbits were also examined 
for antibodies by using the same assay. Signal-to-cutoff 
values were calculated, and values >1 were considered 
positive. Preinoculation baseline serum specimens were 
used as negative controls for each monkey.
RT-nPCR to Detect Positive-stranded and 
Negative-stranded HEV RNA
RNA was extracted from 100 μL of serum, bile, tissue 
suspension, or 10% fecal suspension by using TRIzol 
reagent (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), and purified 
RNA was resuspended in 11 μL of RNase-free water. To 
detect positive-stranded HEV RNA, 11 μL of purified

Transmission of HEV from Rabbits to Macaques
RNA was reverse transcribed at 42°C for 60 min with 
SuperScript II reverse transcription (Invitrogen) and the 
external reverse primer P4 or S4 in a reaction mixture of 
20 mL. Then, nested PCRs were carried out to amplify the 
partial fragments of ORF1 (129–373 nt) and ORF2 (5,983–
6,349 nt) of the HEV genome by using the 2 sets of specific 
external and internal primer pairs listed in online Technical 
Appendix Table 1 (wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/19/4/12-
0827-Techapp1.pdf). The PCR parameters for both sets of 
primers and both rounds of PCR were the same, with an 
initial incubation at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles 
of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 50°C for 30 
s, and extension at 72°C for 40 s, with a final incubation at 
72°C for 10 min.
Tissues with detectable positive-stranded HEV RNA 
were then assayed for negative-sense HEV RNA by RTnPCR with the same 2 sets of universal primers (online 
Technical Appendix Table 1). The extracted RNA was 
subjected to cDNA synthesis with the external forward 
primer P1 or S1. Then parental RNAs were degraded 
by RNaseH, and this was followed by nested PCR. The 
amplification conditions for negative-stranded HEV RNA 
detection were essentially the same as those used in the 
detection of positive-sense HEV RNA.
The PCR protocol used in this study could detect as 
few as 10 GE copies of HEV plasmid DNA. Negative and 
positive controls were included in each assay to exclude the 
possibility of contamination and failure of amplification. 
A recombinant plasmid containing HEV ORF1 and ORF2 
fragments at a concentration of 102
 copies per mL and 
serum or fecal specimens or tissues from naive rabbits 
were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. 
Samples showing a band of the expected size on a 1.5% 
(w/v) agarose gel were considered positive, and the positive 
products were directly sequenced.
Amplification of the Full-Length Genome 
of Rabbit HEV
To compare the complete genome sequence of the 
HEV passed in the macaques to that of the inoculum, 
the fecal sample (rHEV-Cy1) of 1 monkey at 3 weeks’ 
postinoculation (wpi) and the inoculum (CHN-BJ-R14) 
were sequenced to determine the full-length genome as 
reported (21). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from 120 
μL of the rabbit HEV inoculum and a 10% monkey fecal 
suspension in PBS by using the Total RNA Isolation System 
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). cDNA was synthesized 
from 12 μL of purified RNA by using 1 μL (200 U) of 
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription 
(Promega) and 2 μL (10 pmol/L) of OligodT primer. With 
6 sets of specific external and internal primer pairs (online 
Technical Appendix Table 2), a set of nested PCRs were 
performed by using the first-strand cDNA to amplify the 
entire viral genome. The nested PCR was done as described 
(21). The nucleotide sequences at the 5′ and 3′ termini of 
the genome were determined by using a rapid amplification 
of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (Invitrogen), according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequence Analyses
The expected PCR products amplified from the 
inoculum and monkey fecal sample at 3 weeks wpi were 
purified and ligated into a pGEM-T vector (Promega). At 
least 3 positive clones for each region of the viral genome 
were sequenced commercially in both directions by using 
an automated DNA sequencer (ABI model 3730 sequencer; 
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Nucleotide sequences were assembled and analyzed 
with the MEGA 4.0 and ALIGNX software (Vector NTI 
package version 9.0; Invitrogen). ORFs were identified 
by using the EMBOSS software (version 5.0.0; emboss.
sourceforge.net). The full-length genomic sequences of 
CHN-BJ-R14 and rHEV-Cy1 reported in this study have 
been deposited in GenBank under accession nos. JX109834 
and JX121233, respectively.
Results
Cross-Species Transmission of Rabbit HEV 
to Nonhuman Primates
In both of the macaques inoculated with rabbit 
HEV, hepatitis developed, as determined on the basis of 
ALT elevation, viremia, fecal shedding of viruses, and 
seroconversion (Figure). Dramatic elevations in serum 
ALT were observed 5 and 10 wpi for both monkeys, with a 
peak value of 135 U/L at 9 wpi for monkey Cy1 and 97 U/L 
at 5.5 wpi for monkey Cy2.
Before inoculation, both monkeys were seronegative 
for HEV and became seropositive for antibodies against 
HEV at 6–7 wpi. IgM against HEV was detectable from 
7 to 12 wpi for Cy1 and from 6 to 8 wpi for Cy2. The rise 
in IgM against HEV was followed closely by a strong 
response of IgG against HEV for Cy1, whereas both 
responses occurred at about the same time for Cy2. The 
IgG level against HEV remained markedly elevated at the 
end of the 16-week experiment.
Serum and fecal samples taken before inoculation 
from both monkeys were negative for HEV RNA. Viremia 
and fecal shedding of viruses were detected in both 
monkeys after intravenous inoculation. Fecal excretion of 
rabbit HEV, indicative of replication, was first detected 
at 1 wpi and persisted for 5–9 weeks. HEV viremia was 
first detected at 5.5 wpi for Cy1 and at 2 wpi for Cy2 and 
lasted for 2.5–3.5 weeks. The partial sequences of the PCR 
products from both monkeys shared 99%–100% nucleotide 
identity with the original inoculum.

RESEARCH
Sequence Analyses of Rabbit HEV during 
Cross-Species Transmission
To analyze mutations in the rabbit HEV genome that 
appeared during a single passage between the 2 different 
host species, we sequenced rabbit HEV strains recovered 
from the inoculum (CHN-BJ-R14) and from experimentally 
infected cynomolgus monkeys (rHEV-Cy1) over the entire 
genome. The CHN-BJ-R14 and rHEV-Cy1 isolates had the 
same genomic length of 7,284 nt, excluding the 3′ poly (A) 
tail, and contained 3 ORFs—ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3—
which encoded proteins of 1,722 aa (nt 26–5194), 660 aa (nt 
5232–7214), and 113 aa (nt 5221–5562), respectively. The 5′ 
untranslated region (UTR) and 3′ UTR comprise 25 nt and 
71 nt, respectively. Sequence analyses showed that CHNBJ-R14 and rHEV-Cy1 shared 99.8% nucleotide identity with 
each other. Comparison of the complete genome sequence of 
rabbit HEV passed in the macaques (rHEV-Cy1) with that of 
the inoculum (CHN-BJ-R14) revealed 18 nt mutations over 
the entire genome, resulting in 9 nonsynonymous amino acid 
changes. ORF1 harbored 16 of the 18 nt mutations; 11 were 
in the helicase domain and in the RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase domain (Table).
Nucleotide BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi) analysis showed that CHN-BJ-R14 and rHEVCy1 were most closely related to genotype 3 HEV with a 
maximum nucleotide identity of 81%, with the exception 
of 3 other rabbit HEV strains isolated in Gansu (13) and 
Beijing (21). However, several unique features possessed 
only by rabbit HEVs, but not genotype 3 or other HEV 
strains, were observed in the 2 rabbit HEV isolates of 
this study. These features, discovered in a previous study 
(21), were characterized by an insertion of 31 aa in ORF1 
(929–959 aa) and a unique A residue at nt 13 (sites based 
on CHN-BJ-R14) in the 5′ UTR (data not shown).

Transmission of HEV from Rabbits to Macaques
Extrahepatic Replication of HEV in Experimentally 
Infected Rabbits
Both control rabbits remained negative for HEV RNA 
throughout the study. Viremia and fecal shedding of HEV 
were detected in rabbits inoculated with the rabbit HEV 
inoculum. Both rabbits were necropsied, at 5.5 wpi and 
12 wpi, respectively, when ALT elevation was observed, 
and HEV RNA was detected simultaneously in serum 
and feces. Bile and 9 different types of tissues and organs 
were collected and tested for positive-stranded HEV RNA. 
Positive-stranded HEV RNA was detected in bile and in 5 
of the tissues—liver, kidney, small intestine, spleen, and 
stomach. Detection of positive-stranded HEV RNA from 
various tissues and organs did not indicate that the virus 
was replicating in these tissues because contamination of 
the tissue samples by virus circulating in the blood could 
not be ruled out. To further identify the replicating sites of 
HEV, we screened for negative-stranded RNA, which is an 
intermediate product during HEV replication, in all tissues 
that were positive for the positive-stranded HEV RNA. 
Negative-stranded RNA was also detectable in the 5 types 
of tissues. The positive products were sequenced and found 
to be identical to the original inoculum.
Discussion
Since the first animal strain of HEV, swine HEV, was 
identified from a pig in the United States in 1997 (5), the 
increasing identification of HEV infection among a wide 
range of animals, including pigs, chickens, wild boar, and 
deer (4), has raised public health concern for zoonoses and 
food safety (22,23). The recent discovery of rabbit strains 
of HEV in China (13) and the United States (16) showed 
that farmed rabbits are another key reservoir of HEV. In 
our previous study, phylogenetic analysis of the genome 
of rabbit HEV suggested the potential for cross-species 
transmission of rabbit HEV (21). A recent study also 
demonstrated that rabbit HEV can cross species barriers 
and infect SPF pigs (17). In the study described here, we 
showed that under experimental conditions, rabbit HEV is 
transmissible to cynomolgus macaques, which can serve 
as surrogates for humans. This finding suggests that rabbit 
HEV may be a new source of human HEV infection.
In both cynomolgus monkeys infected in this study 
with 104
 GEs of rabbit HEV, typical acute hepatitis E 
developed. The patterns of HEV infection in cynomolgus 
monkeys infected with rabbit HEV were similar to those 
of animals inoculated with HEV strains of genotypes 1–4, 
that is, characterized by fecal excretion of virus, followed 
by viremia and liver enzyme elevation and finally by 
seroconversion (24–27). Although the same viral doses 
were inoculated into both monkeys, the overall course of 
disease varied somewhat, findings in accord with those 
of previous studies (28). In an earlier study, cross-species 
infection of pigs infected with rabbit HEV showed a delayed 
onset and short duration of viremia and fecal virus shedding 
and an absence of seroconversion (17), which differed from 
findings observed in infected monkeys of this study. The 
differences might suggest that pigs are less susceptible than 
nonhuman primates to rabbit HEV. However, because the 
inocula in both the current study and in other studies (17,19)

RESEARCH
have not yet been titrated for infectivity and because HEV 
infections are virus dose dependent (18), additional studies 
should be performed to determine the infectivity titer of 
rabbit HEV and to demonstrate whether the rate of inducing 
hepatitis increases with virus dose of infection.
In the current study, although comparison of the fulllength sequences of rHEV-Cy1 and CHN-BJ-R14 showed 
99.8% nucleotide identity, 18 nt changes, resulting in 9 
nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, were found in 
the genome of HEV. These results suggest that adaptation 
of rabbit HEV to growth in cynomolgus monkeys may 
be associated with a certain number of mutations. Eleven 
of the 16 mutations fell within ORF1, accompanied by 
4 nonsynonymous substitutions, mapped to the helicase 
region and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region, 
which are essential for efficient replication of the genomes 
of HEV (29). Moreover, although most mutations are 
expected to be in the third codon position, of the 16 
substitutions in ORF1, 7 occur at the first codon position 
and 3 at the second codon position. These facts may 
indicate that positive selection is operating in the infection 
of the cynomologus monkeys with the rabbit HEV 
inoculum. A recent study revealed that high-throughput 
sequencing of isolates from bile and feces from 2 pigs 
experimentally infected with human HEV of genotype 3f 
shared the same full-length consensus sequence as in the 
human sample, although a limited spectrum of mutations 
were observed during the interspecies transmission (30). 
The genomic sequences in this study were determined by 
sequencing several randomly selected positive clones, 
which is much less extensive than high-throughput 
sequencing; consequently, additional studies will be 
needed to verify whether the sequence changes that 
occurred after cross-species transmission of rabbit HEV 
to cynomolgus monkeys are adaptive mutations or result 
from the quasispecies structure of HEV.
Previous data from studies performed with pigs 
infected with human and swine HEV indicated that HEV 
can replicate in tissues and organs other than the liver (31). 
Recently, extrahepatic manifestations associated with HEV 
infection, including neurologic disorders (32) and acute 
pancreatitis (33), also suggested that HEV could replicate 
in extrahepatic tissues. The discovery of rabbit HEV 
opened a new avenue for the study of HEV replication 
and pathogenesis. Rabbits were used as an animal model 
to study the extrahepatic replication of HEV in this study. 
Positive-stranded HEV RNA was detected in the liver, 
bile, kidney, small intestine, spleen, stomach, serum, and 
feces from experimentally infected rabbits. Furthermore, 
negative-stranded HEV RNA, indicative of replication, 
was also discovered in the same tissues, which provided 
additional evidence for extrahepatic replication of HEV in 
its natural host. Considering the extrahepatic replication of 
HEV found in this study and the other reports of extrahepatic 
manifestations of HEV infection in humans (34), clinicians 
should consider the possibility of HEV infection in patients 
with nonhepatic diseases, especially patients with acute 
pancreatitis, neurologic syndromes, thrombocytopenia, 
hemolysis, and autoimmune manifestations.
In conclusion, the successful infection of cynomolgus 
macaques with rabbit HEV suggests that humans might 
be at risk for infection with rabbit HEV. Further, rabbit 
HEV was detectable in multiple rabbit tissues and organs, 
indicating extrahepatic replication may be a common 
feature of rabbit HEV. These findings raise additional 
concern for zoonotic transmission of HEV infection among 
persons who have occupational exposure to rabbits or 
persons who eat undercooked rabbit meat. Future studies 
should be conducted to investigate rabbit HEV infection in 
human populations and assess whether close contact with 
rabbits is a risk factor for HEV infection.
