Abstract
Background: The widespread use of abdominal ultrasonography in children documented increased detection rate
of gallstones. The aim of this study was to assess the possible risk factors of gallstones and to detect the
complication rate and outcome of the disease in Egyptian infants and children from a hepatologist perspective.
This prospective study included 35 cases, with ultrasound-detected gallstones, who presented to the Pediatric
Hepatology Unit from July 2015 to October 2017. All patients were initially evaluated by full history, general and
abdominal examination, laboratory assessment, and ultrasound findings to detect possible risk factors of gallstones.
Management approach was individualized for each patient according to his/her condition, and the patients were
followed up at 3 months interval.
Results: The patients’ ages ranged from 3.5 months up to 17 years. The median age of gallstone detection was 2
years. Gallstones were symptomatic in 62.9% with abdominal pain in 51.4%. Complications in the form of
choledocholithiasis were detected in 7 patients (20%). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done for 7 patients while
conservative management was applied for 24 patients. Complete resolution occurred in 8.3% and partial resolution
in 33.3%. Chronic hemolytic anemia was the most commonly identified risk factor for gallstones. Patients needed
surgical intervention had significant higher serum cholesterol and LDL levels (P = 0.006 and P = 0.002 respectively).
Conclusion: Risk factors for gallstones could be identified in most of pediatric cases. Symptomatic presentation is
common among the pediatric population. Conservative management is recommended for asymptomatic cases of
gallstones in children. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and recommended procedure for complicated and
symptomatic cases of gallstones.

Background
The prevalence of gallstones in the pediatric population
has been reported to be uncommon with estimated overall prevalence of 0.13 to 1.9%. However, the increased
use of abdominal ultrasonography (US) in recent years
has led to increased rate of detection of gallstones [1].
Many etiological factors have been associated with
gallstones in children. Chronic hemolytic diseases are
considered the most common cause. Other risk factors
include liver cirrhosis, chronic cholestasis, total parenteral nutrition, and ileal diseases such as ileal resection,
ileal Crohn’s disease, cystic fibrosis, prolonged use of
high-dose ceftriaxone, cancer therapy, family history,
obesity, and congenital anomalies in the GB [2].
Little information is available about the management
of this disorder in childhood as diagnostic approach, and
therapeutic strategies are extremely heterogeneous. For
symptomatic cases, cholecystectomy is curative, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been proven to be safe
and efficient [3]. Asymptomatic patients show a more
difficult management dilemma. Considering the low rate

of complications detected by many studies, expectant
management with periodical clinical and US follow-up is
recommended. Spontaneous resolution of gallstones was
observed in many cases [4]. Elective cholecystectomy is
recommended for children with chronic hemolytic
anemia at the time of gallstone diagnosis, before symptoms, or complications develop [5].
The aim of this study was to assess the possible risk
factors of gallstones and to detect the complication rate
and outcome of the disease in infants and children.
Methods
This prospective study was conducted at the Pediatric
Hepatology Unit during the time period from July 2015
to October 2017. All cases below 18 years of age of both
sexes with US detected gallstones were enrolled in this
study. The study was approved by the institutional ethical committee of the Pediatrics Department. A written
informed consent was taken from patients’ guardians.
Patient evaluation
Initial diagnosis
All patients were evaluated in terms of age, sex, presenting symptoms (typical biliary colic, nonspecific abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or fatty food intolerance, and
symptoms of complications as fever or jaundice), precipitating risk factor for gallstone, and other accompanying diseases.
Laboratory assessment
Complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests,
hemolytic profile (reticulocytes, osmotic fragility, quantitative glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) measurement, hemoglobin electrophoresis, direct coombs
test), lipid profile (serum cholesterol (LDL-HDL-VLDL)
and serum triglycerides), and sweat chloride test if cystic
fibrosis was suspected (multisystem presentations: pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and others as dehydration and
metabolic alkalosis), and serum amylase and lipase if
pancreatitis is suspected.
Radiological assessment
Abdominal US, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in cases of choledocholithiasis,
magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
is done when choledocholithiasis is suspected, and ERCP
cannot be done for technical consideration as young age
(age less than 2 years) and in cases with US documented
CBD dilatation.
Management approach
Conservative management
For asymptomatic patients with no complications, it involved periodic clinical and US follow up at 3-month intervals for at least 1 year.
Medical dissolution of gallstones by Ursodeoxycholic Acid
(UDCA)
A trial of oral UDCA dissolution of stones was applied
at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day for those patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones with periodic clinical
and ultrasound follow-up for symptoms’ improvement
and/or stone dissolution every 3 months. Symptomatic
uncomplicated gallstones were defined as the presence
of biliary colic in the form of significant abdominal pain
in the absence of complications as acute or chronic
cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis, common bile duct
stones, or pancreatitis.
ERCP
ERCP is for patients with choledocholithiasis.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is for (1) patients
with complicated gallstones as cases with choledocholithiasis, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis, (2) patients with
symptomatic gallstones not improving on UDCA, and
(3) patients with chronic hemolytic anemia.
Patient follow-up
Patients who were not indicated for surgery were
followed every 3 months with clinical, laboratory and
ultrasound assessments. Resolution of gallstones was
based on ultrasonographic evidence of absence of gallbladder and bile duct stones.
Statistical analysis
Data was analyzed by the Statistical Package of Social
Science Software program, version 23. Data was presented using mean, standard deviation (SD) for
homogenous quantitative variables, median and interquartile range (IQR) for quantitative variables with nonhomogenous distribution, and frequency and percentage
for qualitative ones. Comparison between groups was
performed using Mann-Whitney test for quantitative
variables and chi-square and Fisher’s exact test for qualitative ones. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Thirty-five children with gallstones were included; 54.3%
were males. Their age ranged from 3.5 months to 17
years. Out of these 35 patients, 18 patients (51.4%) were
below 2 years of age at the time of discovery of gallstones (infantile group), while 17 (48.6%) had their discovery onset beyond 2 years.

They were referred to hepatology clinic because of accidently detected gallstones in US done for other purposes in 25 cases (71.4%), jaundice in 7 (20%), and
elevated liver enzymes in 3 (8.6%). Patients with US detected gallstones were referred from everywhere including general outpatient clinics as well as hematology and
neonatology units. US was repeated in hepatology clinic
for confirmation and for detailed sonographic examination. Twenty-two (62.9%) patients had symptomatic
gallstones: abdominal pain as the most common presentation (51.4%), jaundice (28.6%), vomiting, nausea, and
fatty food intolerance in 25.7%, 11.4%, and 14.3% respectively. Eight patients (22.9%) showed elevated total
bilirubin; all with elevated direct fraction except one
who had β-thalassemia major, in whom indirect bilirubin
was elevated. The seven patients with direct hyperbilirubinemia included 6 patients with choledocholithiasis,
and one patient had cholestasis with normal GGT.
Lipid profile showed abnormal results in 7 cases.
Three patients (8.6%) had hypercholesterolemia, and 4
patients had elevated triglycerides level.
Abdominal US done by 2 operators revealed single
gallstones in 17 cases (48.6%) and multiple gallstones in
18 cases (51.4%). Size of stones ranged from 0.3 to 1.6
cm with median 0.6 cm with IQR (0.4–0.8). Biliary
sludge with gallstones was evident in 9 cases (25.7%)
while common bile duct (CBD) stones were detected in
6 cases (17.1%); 5 (14.3%) of them showed CBD and biliary radicles dilatation.
Possible etiology could be reached in 25 patients
where hemolytic anemia was the most common identified diagnosis (Fig. 1). History of dehydration and neonatal intensive care admission were more prevalent
among the infantile group but with no statistical significance. Duration of NICU admission was significantly
longer among patients with multiple stones (P = 0.044)
compared to those with single stone.
The management plan was individualized for each
patient (Fig. 2). For cases with complicated gallstones
in the form of choledocholithiasis, cholecystectomy
was performed while conservative management was
planned for the other 28 cases (80%). The medical
treatment was offered to non-hemolytic cases with
patent cystic, and common bile duct with stone size
was less than 2 cm. LC was offered for patients with
hemolytic anemia, before symptoms or complications
developed, but unfortunately, it was not performed
except in complicated cases.
LC was done for 7 patients (20%): 6 of them had choledocholithiasis while one of the patients with choledocholithiasis dropped out of the study. A patient was
indicated for LC because of attacks of agonizing abdominal pain after 3 months of conservative management
with no improvement (Fig. 2).
For the 7 patients with choledocholithiasis, MRCP was
done for 5 patients, and ERCP was done for 2 patients.
For the 2 patients who have done ERCP, one patient was
9 years old, and ERCP showed mild dilated intrahepatic

biliary radicles (IHBR) and CBD, sphincterotomy with
dormia basket was done, and multiple gravels were removed. The other patient was 5 years old; ERCP revealed
normal CBD and IHBR with multiple stones, sphincterotomy was done, and stones were removed. Regarding
the other 5 patients, one patient was dropped out, while
the other 4 patients had spontaneous relief of obstructive jaundice. LC was then performed for the 6 cases.
Histopathological analysis of the removed gall bladder in
this study was available in 6 cases and revealed chronic
cholecystitis in all of them (100%): none had papillomatosis or adenoma of the gall bladder.
For the 28 patients (80%) who were subjected to conservative management, 3 patients dropped out of followup, and one (an infant with cerebral palsy) died 1 month
after enrollment due to septicemia. The other 24 patients were followed up for 8 to 34 months with a median of 14 months.
Twelve patients (34.3%) with symptomatic gallstones
were managed conservatively with UDCA for a period
ranging from 3 to 24 months and a median of 4.5
months. Follow-up showed complete resolution of gallstones in 2 patients (8.3%). One of them was a 3-yearold boy with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who showed
decrease in number of stones from 2 stones to a single
stone after 6 months of therapy; however, this patient
showed spontaneous resolution of this remaining gallstone after another 6 months without UDCA administration. Five patients (20.8%) showed partial improvement,
evident with disappearance of symptoms; one patient
(4.2%) showed partial sonographic improvement while 2
patients (8.3%) showed partial clinical and sonographic
improvement (Fig. 2). Sonographic improvement was
based on decreased number of stones and/or disappearance of biliary sludge.
Based on their management strategy, patients were
classified into two groups: medical and surgical. Those
who needed LC were significantly older at the onset of
stones (P = 0.005). In addition, their serum cholesterol
and LDL levels were significantly higher than those who
subjected to medical management (Table 1).
Patients were also divided based on symptomatology
at the time of initial diagnosis into two groups: symptomatic and asymptomatic. G6PD deficiency was significantly higher in the asymptomatic group. Symptomatic
cases had significant lower RBC count, hemoglobin, and
hematocrit than asymptomatic cases (Table 2).
Discussion
Pediatric cholelithiasis is known to be uncommon. However, recent series documented increased detection rate
of gallstones in the pediatric age group [1]. Many risk
factors have been described for the development of gallstones in children as hemolytic disorders, prematurity,
parenteral nutrition, chronic hepatobiliary diseases, cystic fibrosis, genetic factors, sepsis, ileal diseases, obesity,
ceftriaxone use, and abdominal or cardiac surgeries [6].
Idiopathic gallstones, with no identifiable risk factors,
have been reported in the literature in the range of
23.2–52.5% [2, 7, 8]. This is close to the current study
where no risk factors were identified in 28.6%of cases.
Twenty to 40% of all pediatric gallstone disease can be
attributed to hemolytic diseases [9]. Recent studies demonstrated hemolytic diseases in 21.6% and in 11.8% of
Fig. 2 The management plan of the 35 children with gallstones

cases [10, 11]. In the current study, hemolytic anemia
was identified as a risk factor in 34.3%. G6PD deficiency
was identified as a risk factor in 9 cases (25.7%); this
high percentage may be explained by the high prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Egypt as reported by Abo
Elella et al. in 2017 who estimated an overall prevalence
of G6PD deficiency of 4.3% among Egyptian neonates [12].
Therapy with ceftriaxone was identified as a risk factor
in 17.1% of cases, in agreement with literature where
ceftriaxone use was responsible for 6% and 27.3% of
cases of gallstones [2, 13].
Chronic biliary disease in the form of cholestasis was
present in 8.6% of our cases, which is close to the results
of Dooki and Norouzi (2013) and Della Corte et al
(2008) studies (7.5% and 5% respectively) [2, 13]. It is
known that patients with chronic cholestasis especially
those with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis
(PFIC) are prone to cholelithiasis. This is attributed to
impaired bile acid secretory function and supersaturation of bile with cholesterol [14]. The three cholestatic
patients in this study had normal GGT cholestasis; however, the unavailable genetic analysis in Egypt limited
the ability to finally diagnose their specific conditions.
These patients might have had PFIC 1 or 2.
Unlike adults, children are likely to be symptomatic
[8]. Our cases showed symptomatic presentation in
62.9%, which is comparable to other studies [2, 9, 10].
On the other hand, the study of Kirsaclioglu et al. [11]
showed that symptomatic patients were significantly
older than asymptomatic patients, and abdominal pain
was the most frequent symptom [11]. Our cases also
showed abdominal pain to be the most common symptom in 51.4%.
Complications were documented in 20% of our cases,
which is close to the literature, where they were reported in
about 7–20% of cases [6]. While some older studies reported
pancreatitis as the most common complication [15, 16], recent studies reported cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis to
be more common [1, 11, 17]. Our study showed choledocholithiasis to be more common; meanwhile, none of our

cases showed pancreatitis or acute cholecystitis. The relatively high complication rate seen in our study group could
be explained by the nature of our hospital being a tertiary
referral hospital. Severe and complicated cases are commonly referred to our institution, while uncomplicated cases
can be managed conservatively in secondary referral centers.
In children, cholecystectomy is recommended for
symptomatic and complicated gallstones. It is also recommended for asymptomatic gallstones with chronic
hemolytic anemia and asymptomatic large sized gallstones (> 2 cm) for the risk of gallbladder carcinoma [4].
Otherwise, expectant management with periodic clinical
and sonographic assessment appears more appropriate
[4]. LC was done for 7 of our patients: 6 of them because
of choledocholithiasis and one for symptomatic gallstone
with agonizing typical right upper quadrant pain. Hajong
et al. in 2013 reported 15 non-hemolytic cases of gallstones managed by LC; 80% were symptomatic, and
13.3% were asymptomatic while 6.7% had complicated
gallstone in the form of pancreatitis [18]. Another study
showed that primary indications for surgery in pediatric
population were symptomatic cholelithiasis (53%), choledocholithiasis (28%), and biliary dyskinesia (16%) [9].
Histopathological analysis of the removed gall bladder
(GB) in this study was available in 6 cases and revealed
chronic cholecystitis in all of them (100%); none had
papillomatosis or adenoma of GB. This is comparable to
the results of Kim et al. study, who showed that, in 24
cases for whom cholecystectomy was performed, histopathology of most cases revealed chronic cholecystitis
[19]. On the other side, the removed gallbladders in
Della Corte et al. study revealed chronic cholecystitis in
84.6%, papillomatosis in 5.1%, adenoma in 2.6%, and
normal GB in 7.7% [2].
Eighty percent of our cases were managed conservatively, with periodic clinical, laboratory and US followup for 8 to 34 months. None of them developed complications, while 2 cases showed complete spontaneous
resolution of gallstones, and 8 cases showed resolution
of symptoms and/or sonographic improvement. This
may justify the conservative management for uncomplicated cases of gallstones in pediatric population, especially in infants. Jeanty et al., who performed their study
on infantile cholelithiasis, observed complete resolution
of stones in 25% of the cases [20], while Gokce et al.
[21] reported spontaneous complete resolution in 50%

of infantile cases and 19.8% in older children [1]. This
was higher than the resolution rate observed in the
current study.
Limitations of this study include the small sample size
and the short duration of follow-up in some patients.
Moreover, as the study was conducted in a tertiary care
unit, many uncomplicated cases may be diagnosed and
managed in other centers without referral to our unit,
which may explain the higher rate of complications at
presentation of our cases.
The strength of this study is that it is the first study to
evaluate gallstones among infants and children in Egypt.
The absence of a national screening program for G6PD
deficiency and other hemolytic anemias, together with
high incidence of consanguineous marriages, raises the
risk of childhood gallstones in Egypt.
Conclusion
Risk factors for gallstones could be identified in most of
pediatric cases. Symptomatic presentation is common
among the pediatric population. Conservative management is supported for asymptomatic cases. Laparoscopic
cholecystectomy is a safe and recommended procedure
for complicated and symptomatic cases.
