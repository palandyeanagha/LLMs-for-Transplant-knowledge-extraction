A B S T R A C T In the search for the mechanism by
which hyperammonemia complicates propionic and
methylmalonic acidemia the effects of a series of acylcoenzyme A (CoA) derivatives were studied on the
activity of N-acetylglutamate synthetase in rat liver
mitochondria using acetyl-CoA as substrate. PropionylCoA was found to be a competitive inhibitor. The inhibition constant of 0.71 mM is in the range of concentrations ofpropionate found in the serum of patients
with propionic and methylmalonic acidemia. PropionylCoA was also found to be a substrate for N-acetylglutamate synthetase, forming N-propionylglutamate.
This compound was a weak activator of rat liver
carbamoylphosphate synthetase; the activation constant was 1.1 mM as compared with 0.12 mM for Nacetylglutamate. A decreased level of N-acetylglutamate in liver mitochondria that would follow inhibition
of N-acetylglutamate synthetase by propionyl-CoA
would be expected to lead to hyperammonemia.
Methylmalonyl-CoA, tiglyl-CoA, and isovaleryl-CoA
at a concentration of 3 mM caused 30-70% inhibition
of N-acetylglutamate synthetase. The latter two compounds are readily detoxified by the formation of Nacylglycine conjugates in liver, which may prevent
large accumulations and could explain why hyperammonemia is not characteristic of patients with fketothiolase deficiency or isovaleric acidemia in whom
these compounds would be expected to be elevated.

which there are specific deficiencies of the activity
of propionyl-coenzyme A (CoA)l carboxylase and
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, respectively. These enzymes are in the pathway by which four amino acids,
L-valine, L-isoleucine, L-methionine, and L-threonine
are catabolized. Patients with these abnormalities
present clinically with the ketotic hyperglycinemia
syndrome with elevated concentrations of propionate
in the blood (1-7). Two other disorders, isovaleric
acidemia (8) and a-methyl-,j-hydroxybutyric aciduria
(9) may also present with the ketotic hyperglycinemia
syndrome. Involved patients have recurrent ketoacidosis, hyperglycinemia, neutropenia, thrombopenia,
osteoporosis, and protein intolerance. This syndrome
may be distinguished from a nonketotic hyperglycinemia (10).
Severe hyperammonemia has often been encountered
in infants with propionic acidemia (11, 12) and
methylmalonic acidemia (13, 14). A high degree of
correlation has been obtained between the blood
concentrations of ammonia and of propionate (15).
Hyperammonemia has also been reported in one patient with a-methyl-,8-hydroxybutyric aciduria (9).
Enzymes of the urea cycle have been studied in
patients with propionic and methylmalonic acidemia
and have generally been found to be normal (11, 14)
although carbamoylphosphate synthetase activity has
been observed to be low (15).
The pathway of mammalian urea biosynthesis, which
serves for the removal of ammonia, is shown in
Fig. 1. The synthesis of N-acetylglutamate provides
the natural allosteric activator of the ammonia-dependent mitochondrial carbamoylphosphate synthetase
(16-18). N-Acetylglutamate synthetase is a mitochondrial enzyme activated by L-arginine (19, 20). Our

hypothesis has been that the accumulation of propionyl-CoA in the liver mitochondria of patients with
propionic and methylmalonic acidemia might lead to
hyperammonemia through an inhibition of the biosynthesis of N-acetylglutamate (21). It was the purpose
of this study to assess the effects of propionyl-CoA
and methylmalonyl-CoA on N-acetylglutamate synthetase in rat liver mitochondria. It was found that
propionyl-CoA was a significant inhibitor.
METHODS
Acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA were prepared by the method
of Simon and Shemin (22). Tiglyl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA, and
methylmalonyl-CoA were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). N-Propionylglutamate was synthesized according to a modification of the method of
Marshall et al. (23); 60 mmol of glutamic acid suspended in
0.15 ml of H20 were shaken at room temperature with 2 ml
of propionic anhydride and then with 2 ml of water until
only one phase was present; the solution was dried under
nitrogen to remove propionic acid and anhydride; and then
the residue was dissolved in water and adjusted to pH 6 with
NaOH. A portion was analyzed by liquid-partition chromatography (24). [1-'4C]L-glutamic acid was purchased from
Amersham Corp. (Arlington Heights, Ill.) and purified by
anion-exchange chromatography on Aminex-A 25 with 0.1 N
acetic acid (25).
Wistar rats weighing 200-300 g were kept on a laboratory
diet that contained 24% protein. They were killed by decapitation, and the livers were rapidly removed and kept at
4°C during the preparation of mitochondria according to
the method of Myers and Slater (26). Mitochondria was
suspended in 0.25 M sucrose and subjected to sonic disintegration at 30 kcycles for 30 s.
Measurement ofN-acetylglutamate synthetase. N-Acetylglutamate synthetase was assayed by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity from [1-'4C]L-glutamic acid into Nacetylglutamate. The standard assay system of 0.1 ml contained these final concentrations: mitochondrial extract (0.25
mg of protein), 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mM [1_14C]Lglutamic acid (2.25 mCi/mM), 4 mM L-arginine, and acetylCoA and propionyl-CoA at different concentrations. After
incubation for 15 min at 37°C the reaction was stopped by
the addition of 0.025 ml of 0.5 N H2SO4. Acetyl-CoA was
omitted in the blank. The reaction was linear for 20 min and
gave a concave upward curve with increasing protein as
reported by Tatibana and Shigesada (27). For the study of
N-propionylglutamate synthesis, the blank contained propionyl-CoA but not the mitochondrial extract, because Npropionylglutamate was formed nonenzymatically at high
concentrations of propionyl-CoA.
Isolation of N-acetyl-[l -14C] or N-propionyl-[l -'4C]L-glutamate. The labeled product was separated from free [1-
'4C]glutamic acid with 0.9 x 4-cm cation exchange columns
of BIORAD AG 50 W-X4, H+ form, 200-400 mesh (BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). The acyl-['4C]glutamates
were eluted with 6 ml of water and were measured in
routine assays by counting a portion in a liquid scintillation
spectrometer. The unreacted [1-_4C]L-glutamate was retained
on the columns. A small amount of [1-_4C]a-ketoglutarate
formed and eluted with the acylglutamates and was corrected for by the blanks. N-Acetylglutamate and N-propionylglutamate were separated from each other and from
a-ketoglutarate by liquid-partition chromatography of a sample of the water eluate on silicic acid columns eluted with
30% t-amyl alcohol in chloroform. With gradient elution in
this system (24) N-acetyl-[1-_4C]L-glutamate coeluted with
authentic standard at Rf 79.3 relative to citrate at 100, and
N-propionyl-[1-_4C]L-glutamate coeluted with authentic Npropionylglutamate at Rf 61.5.
Identity of the product of the reaction of acetyl-CoA and
[1_-4C]L-glutamate isolated by liquid-partition chromatography with N-acetylglutamate was confirmed by measuring its
ability to activate rat liver carbamoylphosphate synthetase in
an enzymatic assay (28), modified to increase the sensitivity
to 2.5-40 nmol of N-acetylglutamate. The system contained
the following in a final vol of 1 ml: acetylglutamate extract,
sonicated rat liver homogenate (2 mg of protein), 5 mM ATP,
20 mM NH4Cl, 15 M MgCl, 10 mM KC1, 20 mM L-ornithine,
50 mM Tris HCI (pH 7.2), and 0.2 mM NaH'4CO3 (10 mCi/
mM). Incubation was carried out at 37°C for 15 min and
stopped by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of
5%. The sample was dried overnight under a heat lamp to
remove free G4CO2, and its radioactivity was determined.
The labeled product cochromatographed on ion-exchange
column chromatography with authentic nonlabeled citrulline.
The sensitivity of the assay was in the range of 2,500 dpm/
nmol of N-acetylglutamate.
Measurement of carbamoylphosphate synthetase activity
and its activation by N-acetyl- and N-propionylglutamate.

L-ornithine, 50 mM Tris HCI (pH 7.2), 10 mM NaH'4CO3
(0.2 mCi/mM), and N-acetyl- or N-propionylglutamate at varying concentrations. Incubation was carried out at 37°C for 15
min and stopped by the addition of TCA to a final concentration of 5%. The sample was dried overnight under a
heat lamp to remove free '4CO2, and its radioactivity was
determined by liquid scintillation counting.
Protein was determined by a modification of the procedure of Lowry et al. (29). All kinetic data were calculated from double reciprocal plots weighted by V4 according to Wilkinson (30). Apparent Km values for each subPropionyl-Coenzyme A Inhibition of N-Acetylglutamate Synthetase

strate of N-acetylglutamate synthetase were calculated as the
mean of the Km values obtained at the various concentrations of the alternate substrate. The patterns of the kinetic
plots and the apparent Km and K, values are not precise
because of problems inherent in kinetic studies with crude
enzyme preparations.
RESULTS
N-Acetylglutamate synthetase in rat liver mitochondria
was found to have an absolute requirement for Larginine with an apparent activation constant (Ka) of
1 mM and, therefore, 4 mM of L-arginine was employed in all incubations. With acetyl-CoA and [1-14C]Lglutamate as substrates the radioactive product was
shown to be N-acetylglutamate by elution from a
cation-exchange column with water, cochromatography
with authentic N-acetylglutamate on liquid-partition
chromatography, and the ability of the product isolated
by liquid-partition chromatography to activate rat
liver carbamoylphosphate synthetase. The kinetic
properties of N-acetylglutamate synthetase are shown
in Figs. 2A and B. The apparent mean Km for Lglutamate was 5.0 mM and that for acetyl-CoA was
0.6 mM. The maximum velocity (Vnax) was 5.7 nmnol/
min per mg protein.
Propionyl-CoA was also a substrate for N-acetylglutamate synthetase. The radioactive product formed
when propionyl-CoA and [1-'4C]L-glutamate were used
as substrates cochromatographed with authentic Npropionylglutamate on liquid-partition chromatography.
The kinetics of the synthetase in the presence of
propionyl-CoA and L-glutamate are shown in Figs.
3A and B. The Km for propionyl-CoA was 2.1 mM. This
value was somewhat higher than the Km for acetylCoA. The Km for L-glutamate was 1.5 mM. The Vmax
was 0.23 nmol/min per mg protein when propionylCoA was used as substrate, which was only onetwenty-fifth of the Vmax obtained with acetyl-CoA as
substrate.
The synthesis of N-acetylglutamate from acetylCoA was competitively inhibited by propionyl-CoA
(Fig. 4A).
The replot of the slopes from the double reciprocal
plot against the concentration of propionyl-CoA showed
that the inhibition was hyperbolic (Fig. 4B). The replot
of the reciprocal of the slopes in the presence of
propionyl-CoA minus the slope in the absence of
propionyl-CoA vs. the reciprocal of the concentration of propionyl-CoA is shown in Fig. 4B (31). This
gives a straight line with a Ki of 0.71 mM calculated
from the negative reciprocal of the intercept on the
abcissa (Fig. 4B). The Ki was somewhat lower than
the Km for propionyl-CoA as a substrate. Other acyl

acetylglutamate (Fig. 5). The average Vmax with Npropionylglutamate was 68% of that with N-acetylglutamate, and significantly lower by Student's t test
(P < 0.005). Activation of carbamoylphosphate synthetase by N-acetylglutamate and N-propionylglutamate was approximately additive when both were
present simultaneously (Figs. 5A and B).
DISCUSSION
N-Acetylglutamate synthetase in rat liver mitochondria
preparations was found to have a Km of 0.6 mM for
acetyl-CoA and a Km of 5.0 mM for L-glutamate, which
were similar to the Km values of 0.7 mM for acetylCoA and 3.0 mM for L-glutamate reported for the
purified enzyme from rat liver (20, 32). PropionylCoA was shown to be a substrate with an affinity approximately three times less than that for acetyl-CoA.
The Vmax when propionyl-CoA was the substrate was
one-twenty-fifth of the Vmax for acetyl-CoA. Shigesada
and Tatibana (19) reported that propionyl-CoA was a
substrate for N-acetylglutamate synthetase with an
activity 6% of that with acetyl-CoA at 0.5 mM. We
have shown that propionyl-CoA is a competitive inhibitor of N-acetylglutamate synthetase with a k
value similar to its Km value.
These results suggest that elevated concentrations
of propionyl-CoA in mitochondria of the liver of
patients with propionic acidemia and methylmalonic
acidemia may significantly inhibit the synthesis of Nacetylglutamate. Evidence for elevated propionylCoA is provided by the fact that these patients have
plasma propionate levels as high as 5-8 mM (1, 7)
and excrete propionylglycine (33). The synthesis of
propionylglycine in the liver is catalyzed by glycineN-acylase with a Km for propionyl-CoA of 0.18 mM for
the bovine enzyme (34). In vitamin B52-deficient rats,
which provide a model for methylmalonic acidemia,
levels of propionyl-CoA were elevated 15-fold to 81.5
nmol/g liver. This was similar to the levels of acetylCoA of 79.6 nmol/g and higher than those of methylmalonyl-CoA of 57 nmol/g (35). In isolated rat livers
perfused with 10 mM propionate, the concentrations
of propionyl-CoA rose 10-fold to 62.15 nmol/g (36).
These data suggest that concentrations of propionylCoA may be elevated in the liver of patients with
propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia to
levels higher than acetyl-CoA. Because the Ki for
propionyl-CoA is similar to the Km for acetyl-CoA,
significant inhibition of N-acetylglutamate synthetase
could result. A decreased level of N-acetylglutamate
would decrease the activation of carbamoylphosphate
synthetase and, hence, clearance of ammonia by the
urea cycle (27). Some N-propionylglutamate may be
synthesized in the liver of the patients but with an
Ka for carbamoylphosphate synthetase ten times higher
than N-acetylglutamate would not be expected to
stimulate ureagenesis.
In vitro studies have suggested that a metabolite of
propionate inhibits ureagenesis. Propionate did not
directly inhibit carbamoylphosphate synthetase or
ornithine transcarbamylase, but 5 mM of propionate

inhibited ureagenesis from ammonia and ornithine by
40% in rat liver slices (37). Propionate also inhibited the synthesis of citrulline in isolated rat liver
mitochondria (38). It was reported in a recent abstract
that propionyl-CoA, and to a lesser extent tiglyl-CoA
and methylmalonyl-CoA, produced time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of carbamoylphosphate
synthetase activity in homogenates of human and rat
liver (39). This was apparently a result of a direct
inhibition of carbamoylphosphate synthetase and not
of inhibition of N-acetylglutamate synthetase because
10 mM of N-acetylglutamate was added as an activator.
Thus, there may be more than one site for inhibition
of ureagenesis by propionyl-CoA.
In our study, methylmalonyl-CoA was only slightly
inhibitory of N-acetylglutamate synthetase activity,
and, therefore, the hyperammonemia in methylmalonic
acidemia is probably caused by increased levels of
propionyl-CoA. Isovaleryl-CoA and tiglyl-CoA at high
concentrations were shown to inhibit N-acetylglutamate synthetase almost as much as did propionyl-CoA.
The fact that hyperammonemia has not been described
in patients with isovaleric acidemia and in only one
patient with f-ketothiolase deficiency (9) may be
explained by the finding that isovaleryl-CoA and
tiglyl-CoA are more rapidly metabolized by glycine
N-acylase than propionyl-CoA (34). Large amounts of
isovalerylglycine are excreted by patients with isovaleric acidemia (40) and tiglylglycine by patients with
f3-ketothiolase deficiency (9), whereas only small
amounts of propionylglycine and tiglylglycine are
excreted by patients with propionic acidemia (31, 41).
It may be possible to prevent acute episodes of
hyperammonemia in patients with propionic and
methylmalonic acidemia by administering an activator
of carbamoylphosphate synthetase to compensate for
decreased levels of N-acetylglutamate. Analogues
of N-acetylglutamate such as N-carbamoyl-L-glutamate
have been shown to activate carbamoylphosphate synthetase (42). Kim et al. (43) demonstrated that Nacetylglutamate given intraperitoneally was ineffective
in protecting against lethal doses of ammonium
acetate in rats but that N-carbamoylglutamate along
with L-arginine was effective. N-carbamoylglutamate
might provide effective therapy in patients with
propionic and methylmalonic acidemia when acute
episodes of hyperammonemia first occur.
