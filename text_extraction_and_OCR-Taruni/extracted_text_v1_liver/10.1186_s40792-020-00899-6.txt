Abstract
Background: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is an abnormal accumulation of Langerhans cells in various organs
that sometimes induces organ dysfunction. LCH can affect the liver, resulting in sclerosing cholangitis and biliary
cirrhosis. However, liver and bile duct involvement is usually observed in the disseminated form of LCH. We herein
report a rare case of LCH localized only in the extrahepatic bile duct that resulted in severe liver cirrhosis.
Case presentation: A 3-year-old boy with elevated liver enzymes, obstructive jaundice, and dilation of the
common bile duct was referred to our institution. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed atrophy of
the right hepatic lobe, relative hypertrophy of the left hepatic lobe, choledocholiths, and biliary debris extensively
with biliary duct dilation. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed dilation of the intrahepatic and
extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple choleliths in the gallbladder and common bile duct. Laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography, liver biopsy, and gastrointestinal fiberscopy were performed. A
liver specimen showed severe biliary cirrhosis due to sclerosing cholangitis. The patient then underwent livingdonor liver transplantation because of severe liver cirrhosis 3 months after the first surgery. The common bile duct
was not suitable for duct-to-duct anastomosis and was resected because of severe inflammation. Histologic
sections of the common bile duct showed histiocytic cell proliferation. Immunohistochemistry revealed
histiocytoses that were positive for Langerin, S-100 protein, and CD1a. However, no histiocytic cell proliferation was
noted in the liver tissue. The definitive diagnosis was LCH localized to the extrahepatic bile duct. LCH in the
extrahepatic bile duct seemed to cause sclerosing cholangitis. The patient was discharged uneventfully 2 months
after living-donor liver transplantation.
Conclusions: LCH localized to the extrahepatic bile duct is extremely rare; however, LCH can still affect the
extrahepatic bile ducts on occasion. LCH should be considered as a differential diagnosis if pediatric patients show
the presence of sclerosing cholangitis.

Background
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a wide spectrum
of clinical disorders involving the abnormal accumulation of Langerhans cells in various organs [1]. Proliferation of abnormal Langerhans cells can result in organ
dysfunction. LCH ranges from a self-healing solitary lesion to fetal multi-organ involvement [2]. It occasionally
develops in the liver and is well known as a cause of
sclerosing cholangitis and biliary cirrhosis in pediatric
patients [3]. In such situations, LCH cells are usually detected in both the liver and intrahepatic bile duct [4].
We herein report a rare case of primary LCH localized
to the extrahepatic bile duct inducing liver cirrhosis.
Case presentation
A 3-year-old boy was referred to our institution for a definitive diagnostic workup because of elevated liver enzymes, obstructive jaundice, and dilation of the common
bile duct. These findings were noted during the treatment of cholangitis at previous hospitals, and congenital
biliary dilatation induced by pancreaticobiliary maljunction was suspected.
Laboratory data showed elevation of liver and biliary
enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 104 U/L, alanine
aminotransferase 39 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 2206 U/L,
γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 133 U/L, total bilirubin 1.7
mg/dL, and direct bilirubin 0.6 mg/dL). Contrastenhanced computed tomography (CT) showed atrophic
changes of the right hepatic lobe, enlargement of the left
hepatic lobe, choledocholiths, and biliary debris with
common bile duct dilation (Fig. 1). Enhanced CT also
revealed splenomegaly and esophageal varix. Liver
cirrhosis and portal hypertension were suspected based
on these findings. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple choleliths in
the gallbladder and common bile duct (Fig. 2).
To obtain a definitive diagnosis, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, intraoperative cholangiography, liver biopsy,
and gastrointestinal fiberscopy (GIF) were performed.
Typical liver cirrhosis findings, such as atrophy of the
right lobe and enlargement of the left lobe, were recognized by laparoscopic exploration. Intraoperative cholangiography revealed the normal junction of the main
pancreatic duct and common bile duct, indicating no
pancreaticobiliary maljunction. The intrahepatic bile
duct of the right lobe was not visualized, and that of the
left lobe was visualized irregularly. In addition, GIF revealed esophageal varices (Lm, F2, Cw, RC+). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy and liver biopsy were performed.
The pathological findings of the liver showed the disappearance of interlobular ductules, cholangiole proliferation, cholestasis, and extensive fibrosis. These findings
were compatible with end-stage liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis seemed to have been induced by sclerosing cholangitis, but the etiology of sclerosing cholangitis was
unknown.
The postoperative course was uneventful, but the liver
cirrhosis was progressive and in an end-stage condition.
We concluded that the patient would require livingdonor liver transplantation soon, so we referred him to
another institution for living-donor liver transplantation.
The patient underwent living-donor liver transplantation from his father 3 months after the first surgery in

our institution. The common bile duct had severe inflammation and was not suitable for duct-to-duct anastomosis. The hypertrophic common bile duct was
resected, and the specimen was examined pathologically
to confirm the definitive diagnosis. Microscopically, the
wall of the common bile duct was thickened with fibrosis and was diffusely infiltrated by a mixture of eosinophils and medium to large histiocytoid cells with pale
eosinophilic cytoplasm and grooved and convoluted nuclei showing scattered chromatin texture (Fig. 3). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that these
histiocytoid cells were positive for Langerin (CD207)
(Fig. 4a), S-100 protein (Fig. 4b), and CD1a (Fig. 4c), indicating the phenotype of Langerhans cells. This particular population of cells was not identified in the sections
of the liver parenchyma. Based on these findings, the
diagnosis of LCH, localized to the extrahepatic bile duct,
was established. The preexisting liver tissue showed expansion of the portal tract with bridging fibrosis and
cholangiolar proliferation as well as degeneration and regeneration of epithelium lining bile ducts, suggesting
secondary sclerosing cholangitis due to obstructive
process.
The postoperative course following living-donor liver
transplantation was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 62. The patient has been
followed for about 4 years after living-donor liver transplantation, and there is no sign of recurrence of LCH.
Discussion
LCH is a rare disease marked by the proliferation of
Langerhans cells. The incidence of LCH in children
under 20 years of age is 2.9 cases per million per year,
and LCH mainly occurs in children ≤ 4 years old [5]. A
pathological examination is essential to confirm the definitive diagnosis of LCH. According to the WHO classification of tumors, if the histiocytes are positive for
CD1a or Langerin on immunohistochemistry, a definitive diagnosis can be obtained [6].
The clinical manifestations of LCH vary from selfhealing solitary lesions to fetal multi-organ involvement.
LCH has shown an extremely excellent 2-year overall
survival of 98.7% [5]. The mortality rate in patients with
single-site LCH or without risk-organ involvement is estimated to be < 5% [3]. However, the mortality rate in
children with multi-site LCH and risk-organ involvement, such as hematopoietic organ, liver, spleen, or lung,
is reported to be 10–50% [3]. Although our case was one
of single-site LCH, it caused severe liver cirrhosis. As a
result, LCH localized to the common bile duct is considered to be risk-organ involvement.
It is suggested that LCH arises from bone marrowderived immature myeloid dendritic cells rather than
from epidermal Langerhans cells [1]. In pediatric patients with single-site LCH, the most common site is the
bone (82%), followed by the skin (12%) [7]. Liver and
bile duct involvement is usually observed in the disseminated form of LCH [4]. It is unclear why LCH was localized to the extrahepatic bile duct in our case. Primary
LCH localized to the extrahepatic bile duct in children is
rare, and only one case has been described. Finn and
Jaffe reported a female patient with neonatal jaundice.
The patient was diagnosed with primary LCH localized
to the extrahepatic bile duct at 2.5 years old [8]. As in
our case, the patient showed progressive destruction of
the extrahepatic bile duct, leading to sclerosing cholangitis and eventually to secondary liver cirrhosis. The
exact reason for the sclerosing change of the whole
intrahepatic bile duct and liver cirrhosis is unknown. Regarding the possible reason for these specific findings,

some inflammatory effect for the liver or ischemic influence for the bile duct might be considered.
Treatment of LCH should be planned according to
the clinical presentation and the extent of organ involvement. Treatment can range from no treatment
(observation) to surgical intervention and radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The standard optimal treatment of primary LCH of the extrahepatic bile duct
has not been determined because of the limited
number of cases. Eight reports have described performing living-donor liver transplantation in children
with end-stage liver cirrhosis secondary to LCHrelated sclerosing cholangitis, and the overall survival
rate was 87% after living-donor liver transplantation
with a mean follow-up of 3.4 years [9]. Living-donor
liver transplantation was successfully performed in
the patient described in a previous report [8] as well
as in our case. Immunosuppressive agents after
living-donor liver transplantation may be helpful in
preventing recurrence of LCH [8]. In our case, LCH
was a single lesion localized to the extrahepatic bile
duct and was resected completely, and the patient
had taken immunosuppressive agents after livingdonor liver transplantation. Therefore, it is considered that recurrence is unlikely, and there is no indication of chemotherapy for preventing recurrence.
In our case, if an early definitive diagnosis of LCH
had been obtained before the progression of sclerosing cholangitis, less invasive treatment, such as
chemotherapy or hepatico-jejunostomy with common
bile duct resection, may have been attempted. Because pathological examination is essential for the
diagnosis of LCH, in infants with LCH localized to
the extrahepatic bile duct, the resection of the extrahepatic bile duct is thought to be necessary for diagnosis. In our case, CT, MRCP, and intraoperative

cholangiography could not suspect a neoplastic lesion of the extrahepatic bile duct; therefore, the resection of the extrahepatic bile duct for the
diagnosis could not be performed. Diagnosis of LCH
localized to the extrahepatic bile duct is considered
challenging unless imaging examinations show a
clear neoplastic lesion.
In children, secondary sclerosing cholangitis accounts
for 30% of overall cases of sclerosing cholangitis, and
secondary sclerosing cholangitis may be caused by LCH,
congenital immunodeficiency, and cystic fibrosis [10].
LCH localized only to the extrahepatic bile duct is a rare
phenomenon and challenging to diagnose. However, the
presence of sclerosing cholangitis in children should
raise suspicion of LCH [11].
Conclusions
LCH localized to the extrahepatic bile duct is a rare
condition. LCH should be considered as a differential
diagnosis if pediatric patients show the presence of sclerosing cholangitis.
