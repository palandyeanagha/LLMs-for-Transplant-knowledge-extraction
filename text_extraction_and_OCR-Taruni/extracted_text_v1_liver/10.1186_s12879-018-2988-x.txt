Abstract
Background: In 2016, the World Health Organisation set a goal to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030. Robust
epidemiological information underpins all efforts to achieve elimination and this systematic review provides
estimates of HBsAg and anti-HCV prevalence in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) among
three at-risk populations: people in prison, men who have sex with men (MSM), and people who inject drugs
(PWID).
Methods: Estimates of the prevalence among the three risk groups included in our study were derived from multiple
sources. A systematic search of literature published during 2005–2015 was conducted without linguistic restrictions to
identify studies among people in prison and HIV negative/HIV sero-status unknown MSM. National surveillance focal
points were contacted to validate the search results. Studies were assessed for risk of bias and high quality estimates
were pooled at country level. PWID data were extracted from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction (EMCDDA) repository.
Results: Despite gaps, we report 68 single study/pooled HBsAg/anti-HCV prevalence estimates covering 23/31 EU/EEA
countries, 42 of which were of intermediate/high prevalence using the WHO endemicity threshold (of ≥2%). This
includes 20 of the 23 estimates among PWID, 20 of the 28 high quality estimates among people in prison, and four of
the 17 estimates among MSM. In general terms, the highest HBsAg prevalence was found among people in prison
(range of 0.3% - 25.2%) followed by PWID (0.5% - 6.1%) and MSM (0.0% - 1.4%). The highest prevalence of anti-HCV was
also found among people in prison (4.3% - 86.3%) and PWID (13.8% - 84.3%) followed by MSM (0.0% - 4.7%).
Conclusions: Our results suggest prioritisation of PWID and the prison population as the key populations for HBV/HCV
screening and treatment given their dynamic interaction and high prevalence. The findings of this study do not seem
to strongly support the continued classification of MSM as a high risk group for chronic hepatitis B infection. However,
we still consider MSM a key population for targeted action given the emerging evidence of viral hepatitis transmission
within this risk group together with the complex interaction of HBV/HCV and HIV.

Background
Chronic infection with the hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis
C virus (HCV) is a significant cause of liver diseaserelated morbidity and mortality in the European Union/
European Economic Area (EU/EEA) [1]. Both viruses are
transmitted through contact with infected blood, blood
products and other bodily fluids. HBV is vaccine preventable which, along with other primary prevention
measures including health care infection control and
antenatal screening, have led to a decrease in acute and
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) incidence in many EU/EEA
countries [2]. Health care infection control together with
harm reduction programmes among people who inject
drugs (PWID) have also led to some decrease in the
HCV incidence in many countries [3]. Many EU/EEA
countries now face a dichotomy: a declining incidence of
new HBV/HCV infections in the general population due
to the success of primary prevention [2, 4] alongside a
projected increase in liver disease-related morbidity and
mortality due to ageing of the chronically infected population [5, 6]. With the availability of antiviral treatment
that can effectively halt disease progression in CHB, including progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and new direct acting antivirals for chronic
hepatitis C (CHC) that report cure rates in more than
90% of cases [7, 8], elimination of chronic viral hepatitis
is a possibility. Elimination requires expanded access to
screening, efficient linkage to care and retention in treatment among risk populations. Timely, reliable prevalence data are needed to understand which populations
are most affected to better target screening and treatment programmes, and to monitor the performance and
impact of these activities at a strategic level. Indeed, for
screening to have a more favourable cost-effectiveness
ratio and lead to an overall net gain in population health,
current evidence indicates that it should be targeted to
higher prevalence populations including PWID and
other risk populations, where the expected case yield
would be highest. [9, 10] However, the prevalence
threshold above which a favourable cost effectiveness ratio varies considerably between EU/EEA countries.
In terms of key at-risk populations, men who have sex
with men (MSM) are considered a high risk population
for viral hepatitis due to the efficacy of sexual contact in
transmitting HBV and the high prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections especially Human ImmunoDeficiency Virus (HIV). Whilst sexual contact was historically considered an ineffective route of HCV transmission, an increased HCV incidence among MSM who
have not/do not inject drugs has been reported since the
early 2000s. There is increasing evidence of permucosal
transmission of HCV, especially among HIV positive
MSM, although sexually acquired HCV infection remains rare in HIV negative, non-injecting MSM. [11, 12]
Hahné et al. reported Hepatitis B surface Antigen
(HBsAg) and anti-HCV (measures of evidence of
chronic HBV and chronic or resolved HCV infection respectively) prevalence among MSM in the EU/EEA ranging from < 1% to 4% and from > 1% to 2.9%,
respectively [13].
People detained in prison settings are considered a
high risk population for blood-borne virus infection due
the criminalisation of high transmission risk behaviour
such as injecting drug use and sex work, coupled with
pre-detention social vulnerability (such as experience of
domestic abuse, poverty and homelessness) among many
people detained and convicted. Prison-acquired bloodborne virus infections may also occur due to the continuation of transmission risk behaviour, the limited
availability of harm reduction services and the lack of
adequate infection control practices [14, 15]. Dolan et al.
meta-analysed data in Global Burden of Disease regions:
in Western Europe, HBsAg and anti-HCV prevalence
among people in prison was reported to be 2.4% and
15.5%, respectively, while in Eastern Europe it was 10.4%
for HBsAg and 20.2% for anti-HCV [16]. HBsAg and
anti-HCV estimates are also available for nine and 13
EU/EEA countries, respectively, although no study quality assessment nor country-level meta-analysis/pooling
were performed.
Of the three at-risk populations included in this study,
PWID are considered at highest risk due to the efficacy
of unsafe injecting behaviour in transmitting HBV and
HCV. This together with clustering of social and environmental risk factors in this marginalised population
such as a history of incarceration, poverty, homelessness
and multi-morbidity compound their vulnerability [17].
Nelson et al. conducted a global review of HBsAg and
anti-HCV prevalence among PWID in 2010, and reported prevalence data for 30 EU/EEA countries for
anti-HCV and for 26 EU/EEA countries for HBsAg. The
prevalence of anti-HCV ranged from 21.1% in Finland to
90.5% in Latvia, whereas HBsAg prevalence ranged from
0.0% in Ireland and Cyprus to 21.3% in Estonia [17].
Wiessing et al. performed a systematic review of various
epidemiological measures of the HCV epidemic among
PWID in Europe [18]. Although anti-HCV prevalence
was not an included outcome, their findings across the
cascade of care show that 72% of anti-HCV infected
PWID are viraemic; that 49% are unaware of their infection; and that 9.5% of diagnosed cases are reported to be
on treatment. A review focused on the EU/EEA in 2009,
Hahné et al. reported HBsAg prevalence among PWID
to be between 0.0% and 21.3% and anti-HCV prevalence
to be between 5.3% and 90% [13]. An updated synthesis
of the prevalence in this priority population is required.
Our study is part of a larger project funded by the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
Falla et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2018) 18:79 Page 2 of 12

(ECDC) that seeks to provide a timely update on available estimates across a number of low risk populations
(the general population, pregnant women and first-time
blood donors) and as a comparator/contrast to collate
prevalence estimates in high risk populations. We describe the results of the study into chronic viral hepatitis
low risk populations and among migrants elsewhere [19,
20]. In the study reported here, we seek to update and
expand the work of the previous ECDC systematic review (from 2009) by Hahné et al. [21] of prevalence estimates for markers of hepatitis B (HBsAg) and C (antiHCV) in three key risk groups: MSM, people who inject
drugs and people incarcerated in prison. Our study seeks
to contribute to the elimination of viral hepatitis in Europe by providing information to support the design and
management of primary and secondary prevention
strategies.
Methods
Data sources
Estimates of the prevalence among the three risk groups
included in our study were derived from multiple
sources. A systematic literature search was conducted
according to PRISMA guidelines [22] to retrieve, assess
and synthesize available data published in the period
2005–2015 on the prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HCV
infection in MSM and people in prison. Data on the
prevalence among PWID were retrieved from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
(EMCDDA) [23, 24].
Definitions
The key outcome was prevalence, which was defined as
the proportion of study subjects with a positive finding
of HBsAg or anti-HCV in serum, saliva or dry blood
spot samples. MSM were not formally defined beyond
the search term/inclusion criterion of ‘MSM’ and in
practice this conceptualisation included men participating in studies in MSM-specific venues (e.g. saunas).
People in prison were defined as people incarcerated in
prison settings including prisons, remand centres, youth
detention centres and psychiatric prison hospitals but
excluding formerly incarcerated populations and other
non-custodial secure institutions (such as secure psychiatric hospitals). PWID were defined by the EMCDDA as
any person who has ever in their lifetime injected a drug
for non-medical purposes [25].
The prevalence in MSM and people in prison: Systematic
review
Search strategy
A systematic search to retrieve original research articles
was conducted in PubMed®, Embase® and Cochrane Library bibliographic databases in March 2015. The search
strategy (described in the Additional file 1) combined
controlled (i.e. MeSH/Emtree terms) and natural vocabulary (i.e. keywords) to define disease-related (HBV
or HCV infection), outcome-related (prevalence), and
geographic-related search parameters (EU/EEA). To
maximise the yield of the search, no population-specific
search terms were included. Population relevancy was
instead assessed at the title/abstract and full text assessment stages, as described below. The search was limited
to records published from 1 January 2005 to 12 March
2015. Articles in all EU/EEA languages were included.
The results of the search were shared with ECDC National Focal Points [26] for viral hepatitis in all EU/EEA
Member States in May 2015 to review and validate the
list of included references for their country. The data extraction, risk of bias assessment and data analysis described below were all performed in Microsoft Excel.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Inclusion/exclusion criteria included publication and
data collection date ranges, geographical relevancy,
the reporting of specific markers of hepatitis B/C infection, population relevancy (as outlined in the definitions section above) and study design. Criteria
related to study design included the actual measured
presence of viral markers in bodily fluid/dried blood
spot samples (and thus the exclusion of self-reported
infection) in human subjects, prevalence as an outcome measure, the exclusion of modelled data only,
and the exclusion of guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and commentary/opinion pieces.
These criteria were twice piloted and refined by two
reviewers (AF/SHIH) on a random sample of 5% of
articles in order to reach > 95% concordance. Following this, the title/abstract screening continued separately using Endnote. The full text of all publications
included during title/abstract screening were individually assessed for relevance by members of the research team (for articles in Dutch, English, French,
German and Italian) or by ECDC reviewers (for any
other EU/EEA languages). Reviewers consulted each
other in cases of uncertainty about in- or exclusion,
and with a third team member (IV) to resolve further
disagreement. The full search strategy, the in- and
exclusion criteria and the PRISMA checklist are available in the Additional file 1 accompanying this article.
See Fig. 1 for the PRISMA flowchart (reasons for full
text exclusion are detailed in the Additional file 1).
Data extraction
Data extraction using a pre-defined set of variables was
performed simultaneously with full text screening. The
unit for data extraction was study, not article. A study
Falla et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2018) 18:79 Page 3 of 12

was defined as the report of prevalence data on HBsAg
or anti-HCV for a defined population group, in a defined
country, over a discrete period of time and one article
may therefore include more than one study. Studies
published in more than one article were extracted only
once and the article with the most detail about the study
used as reference. For studies retrieved reporting the
prevalence in MSM, only data on HIV negative or unknown/unmeasured HIV sero-status MSM were extracted. All results reported in the study relating to
MSM are therefore among HIV negative or unknown
HIV sero-status MSM.
Risk of bias assessment
For MSM and the prison population each study was
evaluated for the risk of selection bias using a specifically developed assessment framework. To account
for differences in sources of selection bias, separate
assessment frameworks were developed for MSM and
people in prison to determine the representativeness
of sample for that specific target population and the
robustness of the estimates in each study. For studies
in MSM, just one domain was included, ‘sampling
venue coverage’, where the risk of bias was considered
smaller for studies in multiple venues or multiple
venue types. For studies in the prison population, the
domains of age, gender, proportion of PWID, sampling method and geographical coverage were considered as possible sources of selection bias. Points were
awarded in each domain for representativeness or a
lower risk of bias, and a total score calculated by
summing the values in each domain. This resulted in
a score of between zero and two for MSM and between zero and six for the prison population. We
refer to the total score as study quality score, since a
higher score indicates a lower risk of bias.
Data analysis
We recalculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all
crude and pooled estimates using the Fisher’s Exact
method. All prevalence estimates retrieved for MSM, irrespective of the study quality score, are presented in
separate (one for hepatitis B and one for hepatitis C) forest plots prepared using Microsoft Excel. HBsAg and
anti-HCV prevalence estimates obtained from studies
among adults in prison with a high study quality score
(≥3) were pooled, when possible, by summing cases and
sample size. Pooled or single study-derived high quality
estimates retrieved for people in prison are presented in
a forest plot, unless a study reported data over time
whereby the most recent estimate was selected. Adult

and juvenile (as defined by the included studies) estimates for the prison population are shown separately.
The prevalence in PWID: Extraction from the EMCDDA
data repository
The EMCDDA systematically retrieves, synthesizes and
publishes comprehensive (and often unpublished) data
on the prevalence of viral infections among PWID [23,
24]. We opted to draw on this repository due to its extensive scope as well as the potential to retrieve unpublished data that would be unavailable in scientific
literature. The full data set retrieved for use in this study
included country, year of study, geographical coverage,
sample size and prevalence as well as limited information about study design and recruitment method/setting.
We included only national level estimates, and where
multiple national estimates were available for a country,
the most recent estimate was selected. We did not assess
the quality of the study beyond these parameters of geographical coverage and recency. Number positive was
back calculated using prevalence and sample size, and a
95% CI re-calculated using the Fisher Exact method.
Samples in fewer than 10 subjects were excluded and
multiple national-level estimates (if available from a specific year for an EU/EEA country) were pooled by summing cases and sample size.
Results
Literature/database search retrievals
The literature search retrieved 9379 citations, from
which 17 citations were included for MSM and 57 for
people in prison based on title/abstract. Seventeen MS
validated our search results or provided additional references. For people in prison, seven publications were
added either through a manual search of retrieved studies or through the national viral hepatitis ECDC focal
points. An additional three citations were added for
MSM. Whilst all 20 full texts were retrieved for MSM,
three of the 64 included for people in prison were unavailable. Following full text screening, 13 articles were
included for MSM and 32 for people in prison. The
database search of the EMCDDA data repository retrieved seven national level HBsAg and 16 national level
anti-HCV prevalence estimates.
The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HCV among HIV negative/unknown HIV sero-status MSM
A total of 17 prevalence estimates, six for HBsAg and
11 for anti-HCV, were extracted from the 13 included
studies about HIV negative/unknown HIV sero-status
MSM. Key study details, including the risk of bias assessment, for all reported estimates among MSM are
available in Annex 8 (HBV) and 9 (HCV) in the
Additional file 1 for this article.
The six HBsAg prevalence estimates covered four countries: one each from Croatia and France and two each
from Estonia and the United Kingdom (UK). HBsAg
prevalence ranged from 0.0% - 0.1% in Estonia [27, 28]
and the UK to 1.4% in France (Fig. 2). The prevalence in
the UK was derived from STI clinics in Scotland in 2001–
2003 and ranged from 0.0% [29] to 1.0% [30], with the
sample size of the study for the latter estimate considerably larger than the former study (N = 575 vs N = 81). The
estimate from France is based on a large (N = 876), multicentre, multi venue type study from 2009 [31].
The 11 anti-HCV estimates covered seven countries
and the prevalence ranged from 0.0% in Italy [32] to
4.7% in Estonia (Fig. 3), with eight of the 11 data
points ≥ 1%. Single estimates were available for France
[31], Italy [32] and Sweden [33] whereas multiple estimates were available for Croatia, Estonia, the
Netherlands and the UK. For Estonia, the two anti-HCV
estimates range from 4.7% (in 2013) to 1.8% (in 2014–
15). [27, 28] The two estimates for Croatia range from
2.5% [34] to 2.9% [35] and cover broadly the same time
period (2003–2006) although the former sampled the
population of Zagreb only while the latter covered seven
cities. The two estimates from the Netherlands range
from 0.7% to 1.3% and were derived using different
study designs among the MSM population in
Amsterdam; men attending a STI clinic opting out of
HIV testing in 2007 [36] and a cohort study over the
period 1984–2003, respectively [37]. The two estimates
for the UK were: 2.2%, found in a multi-centre study between 2008/9 (N = 1121) in London gay bars, clubs and
saunas; and 1.6% found among STI clinic attendees in
Sheffield in 2009–2011 (N = 3395) [38, 39]. In summary,
prevalence among MSM ranged from 0.0% to 1.4% for
HBsAg and from 0.0% to 4.7% for anti-HCV.
The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HCV among people in
prison
Fifteen HBsAg prevalence estimates for 12 countries
were extracted from the 32 included articles, only one of
which (in Romania) scored < 3 in the study quality assessment. Single estimates of HBsAg prevalence were retrieved for Bulgaria, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Multiple (and
therefore pooled) estimates were found for Croatia and
the UK (Fig. 4). These data show considerable heterogeneity in HBsAg prevalence in the prison population in
the EU/EEA from < 1% in the UK, Ireland [40], Finland
[41] and France [42] to 6.7% in Italy [43], 7.0% in
Luxembourg [44], 10.7% in Portugal [45] and 25.2% in
Bulgaria [46]. Two estimates for Croatia obtained over
2004–2006 and 2005–2007 both report a HBsAg prevalence of 1.3% in adult inmates, with a third study from
2005 to 2007 reporting 1.4% among juvenile inmates.
Falla et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2018) 18:79 Page 5 of 12

Two estimates obtained in the UK, one in a maximum
security psychiatric hospital prison (reporting 0.0%) and
the other in a general prison in London (reporting 2.0%),
were pooled into an estimate of 1.6% (95% CI 0.8–2.9).
Whilst diversity in sampling design was seen across the
14 high quality HBsAg prevalence estimates, just one
study [44] was biased towards exclusive recruitment of
PWID or use of injecting drug use as a sampling criterion. Key study details, including the risk of bias assessment, for all reported estimates among people in prison
are available in Annex 10 (HBV) and 11 (HCV) in the
Additional file 1 for this article.
Forty-five estimates of anti-HCV prevalence were retrieved from the included studies of which 37 estimates
for 11 countries were considered high quality (i.e. a
study quality score of ≥3). In 17 of the 45 anti-HCV estimates, injecting drug use was a study inclusion criterion
or current/former PWID formed the majority of subjects. Figure 5 shows the final 16 single study/pooled
high quality estimates included. There is considerable
heterogeneity in the (mostly high i.e. ≥8%) prevalence
among people in prison across the EU/EEA; all but four
estimates (from Croatia (juvenile), France, Germany (juvenile) and Hungary) were above 10%, with an estimate
from Luxembourg as high as > 80% prevalence [44].
Multiple high quality (and therefore pooled) estimates
were available for Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Spain and
the UK. Alongside a pooled estimate of 20.3% [47, 48],
consecutive annual estimates report a decrease in antiHCV prevalence in Spain from 44.9% in 2000 to 25.3%
in 2009 [49]. Two multi-centre study-derived estimates
from Bulgaria were pooled into an estimate of 26.3%
(95% CI 23.5–29.3) [50, 51]. Four estimates from the UK
were pooled into an overall prevalence of 17.4% (95% CI
16.4–18.4) [52–55]. The pooled prevalence of 6.3% for
France is derived from seven studies screening more
than 68,000 people in prison. The three estimates among
juvenile inmates show considerable heterogeneity, from
20.5% prevalence in Bulgaria [46] to 8.6% in Germany
[56] and 4.3% in Croatia [57]. To summarise, prevalence

extracted (and pooled where possible) from the high
quality studies ranged from 0.3% to 25.2% (for HBsAg)
and from 4.3% to 86.3% (for anti-HCV).
The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HCV among PWID
The most recent, national level estimates of HBsAg and
anti-HCV prevalence among PWID are presented in
Table 1. National estimates of HBsAg prevalence were
available for seven countries (Croatia, Cyprus, Greece,
Hungary, Ireland, Latvia and Portugal), four of which
were from studies conducted in 2013. The reported national prevalence ranges from 0.5% in Croatia, Hungary
and Ireland, to more than 6% in Hungary and Portugal.
National estimates of anti-HCV prevalence in the PWID
population were available for 16 countries: Austria,
Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,

Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Norway,
Portugal, Slovenia and the UK. Anti-HCV prevalence
was ≥30% in 13 of these countries and ≥50% in seven. In
sum, the prevalence among PWID ranged from 0.5% to
6.1% (for HBsAg) and from 13.8% to 84.3% (for antiHCV).
Discussion
This is the first review to collate, assess and compare
prevalence estimates across these three key at-risk
groups in the EU/EEA. Although gaps in evidence exist,
this study reports 68 HBsAg/anti-HCV single study/
pooled prevalence estimates from 23 of 31 EU/EEA
countries, 42 of which are considered as intermediate/
high prevalence using the WHO endemicity threshold
for HBV/HCV (≥2%) [58]. This includes 20 of the 23 estimates among PWID, 20 of the 28 high quality estimates among people in prison, and four of the 17
estimates among HIV negative/unknown HIV sero-status
MSM. Geographical trends are difficult to determine
due to heterogeneity of, and gaps in, evidence, although
the reported data here are suggestive of higher prevalence among MSM (for anti-HCV) and among PWID
(for both viruses) among countries in eastern and southern Europe.
Limitations in the estimates reported for people in
prison and MSM relate to geographical and population
coverage, study quality and heterogeneity of the included
estimates. To retrieve estimates for people in prison and
for MSM, we conducted a very broad search of the published literature with no language or population restrictions, and validated retrievals directly with countries, yet
found many geographical gaps in the data. Indeed, only
a third of EU/EEA countries are represented among the
studies that met the inclusion criteria for people in
prison and only seven countries reported estimates
among MSM. It is unlikely we failed to identify and include all existing high quality data, and consider it most
likely that the data just do not exist or are not published.
In the absence of larger, more robust studies from which
prevalence can be derived, we consider the data reported
here are the best available although there may have been
more recent estimates published since the date of our
search (March 2015). Significant heterogeneity in study
design within and between risk groups hamper the statistical comparison and pooling of prevalence across

countries and populations. To control for strong sources
of bias in studies among people in prison when pooling
data, we developed and applied a study quality assessment. The five domains were considered equally important sources of bias and it is possible that estimates
included in the analysis have residual selection biases.
Further, our study quality assessment did not consider
sample size and there is clearly more uncertainty in the
estimates derived from smaller studies.
For pragmatic reasons, we extracted prevalence estimates for PWID from the data repository coordinated
by EMCDDA. With limited methodological information
accompanying the EMCDDA data sets, it is possible that
this data set is not exhaustive. However, EMCDDA were
recently identified by another wide-ranging systematic
review as the source of the most routinely collected,
European-level data on the viral hepatitis prevalence
among PWID [18]. We adopted an algorithmic approach
favouring the most recent national level data to select
estimates, and found estimates meeting this criteria for
just seven MS for HBsAg and 16 MS for anti-HCV. As
with the retrievals from the systematic search, there is
considerable heterogeneity in study design (interventionrelated and observational), sampling method (single and
multi-centre sampling methods) and sample size (from
< 50 to > 6000 participants) across these 23 estimates.
Beyond favouring the geographical and time-frame parameters, we did not systematically assess the quality of
these studies and selection biases relating to study setting, population and sample size are likely to exist.
Using 2% prevalence as the endemicity threshold set
out in the 2017 WHO HBV and HCV testing guidelines,
[58] by comparing risk group prevalence with the general population prevalence (from previously published
reviews of the literature [59–64]) and by comparing
across risk groups, our findings generally support the
continued classification of PWID and people in prison
as the key populations for both chronic hepatitis B and
C infection. Whilst this study does not seem to support
the continued classification of HIV negative/unknown
HIV sero-status MSM as a high (> 2%) prevalence population for chronic hepatitis B infection, we are cautious
in this conclusion given the wide confidence interval
(that sometimes includes the 2% threshold) around the
MSM-derived HBV estimates. We therefore still consider MSM a key population for targeted action, given
that anti-HCV prevalence in MSM is higher than in the
general population, the evidence of the ongoing transmission of viral hepatitis among MSM populations and
the complex interaction of viral hepatitis and HIV [11,
12]. Both infection with, and antiretroviral treatment for,
HIV are suspected to increase progression to chronicity
as well as to accelerate fibrosis [11, 12]. Global antiHCV prevalence among HIV positive MSM has been
estimated as high as 6.4% [65], and end-stage liver disease is a leading key cause of death among co-infected
HIV positive patients in some high income countries
[66]. A cohort study found an unexpectedly high proportion of MSM (23% compared to the 5–10% chronicity
rate expected in the general adult population [67]) develop a chronic hepatitis B infection following HBV exposure regardless of HIV status, with a younger (adult)
age at infection significantly associated with an increased
risk of developing CHB [68]. It would therefore seem an
effective use of health resources to (continue to) offer
HCV screening to HIV positive men in addition to
MSM-wide HBV vaccination [69]. Specific costeffectiveness analyses of offering individual or combined
blood-borne virus screening in MSM would also greatly
aid public health decision making and be a useful
addition to the evidence.
Differences in the prevalence among people in prison
between countries are related to the differential distribution of risk factors among the prison population together
with differences in prison conditions, such as the availability of harm reduction interventions and infection
control practices and infrastructure across the EU/EEA
countries represented in this study [16]. The high prevalence of HBsAg in the prison population in some countries could be attributable to the incarceration of people
born in intermediate or high prevalence countries and
consequent over-representation of migrants in the incarcerated population. Recent estimates suggest that the
proportion of the prison population that is foreign-born
ranges from < 5% in Bulgaria and Hungary, to more than
15% in France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, and
up to 72% in Luxembourg [70]. It is possible that the incarceration of foreign-born migrants is a driver of the
high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and C infection in
prisons although as there is no systematic EU-wide data
collection on the demographic profile of the incarcerated
population, our understanding of the dynamics of migration, incarceration and chronic infection is limited [70].
Our study seeks to contribute to the elimination of
viral hepatitis in Europe by providing information to
support the design and management of primary and secondary prevention strategies. However, expected prevalence is just one of a number of factors that affects the
cost-effectiveness of testing strategies. Programmerelated factors such as ease of reaching the target population, uptake of screening, actual (viraemic) prevalence,
linkage to care and treatment initiation also playing a
key role [9, 10, 3].
We see four key public health implications emerging
from our experience in this study. The first is the indication for systematic screening and linkage to care of
people in prison given the high prevalence, the overlap
with the PWID population, and the possible
Falla et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2018) 18:79 Page 9 of 12

continuation of risk behaviour. Secondly, we see significant public health benefits of providing treatment as
prevention, especially for CHC, among populations that
share risk behaviour, in line with national and international clinical and public health guidelines [58]. Analyses have shown that treatment among high-risk
dynamically interactive populations such as PWIDs, is
cost-effective, especially given the shorter and more tolerable treatment regimens [8]. Thirdly, the need for
diagnostic testing and treatment is particularly important for PWID where the prevalence, and therefore risk
of intra-population transmission, of hepatitis C is very
high. Targeted PWID screening in accessible locations as
part of broader harm reduction measures may help
break down barriers of stigma and among this vulnerable and high risk population [16, 71]. The criminalisation of drug use has been suggested to be as the single
most important determinant of the high blood-borne
virus prevalence among people in prison [16]. Finally,
the lower prevalence of CHB we found among some risk
populations in some countries is likely a direct result of
the adoption and implementation of primary prevention
measures, especially childhood immunisation, in the
general population [72]. This highlights the importance
of adequately resourcing primary prevention measures
as well as continuing to offer HBV vaccination to risk
groups to protect public health.
The limitations of this study also provide ideas for future research, specifically the improvement in the design
of studies and greater geographical representation to fill
the gaps in evidence. The development and consistent
application of an EU/EEA or international standard for
the design and quality assessment of seroprevalence
studies to inform pooling and/or statistical comparison
of data across studies and populations would also greatly
improve understanding of prevalence across countries
and populations. Finally, and probably most importantly,
there is clear and urgent need for more implementation
studies to determine the features of screening programmes and strategies among risk populations that effectively reach, diagnose and link to care people infected
with chronic viral hepatitis.
Conclusion
Our study highlights the heterogeneity in prevalence
across risk groups across Europe. Prevalence generally
increases in an Eastern and Southern direction. There
are also many countries, especially in the Eastern and
Southern part of Europe, that are not represented in our
results, highlighting the need to build capacity for and
resource the development of robust epidemiological
studies among key risk groups. Step One of elimination
action planning is to know your epidemic, the ‘who’ and
the ‘where’, [73] and both the evidence and the data gaps
contained in this review should contribute to this strategic aim.
