Abstract
During the past decade an increasing number of countries have adopted policies that emphasize donation after
cardiocirculatory death (DCD) in an attempt to address the widening gap between the demand for transplantable organs
and the availability of organs from donation after brain death (DBD) donors. In order to examine how these policy shifts
have affected overall deceased organ donor (DD) and DBD rates, we analyzed deceased donation rates from 82 countries
from 2000–2010. On average, overall DD, DBD and DCD rates have increased over time, with the proportion of DCD
increasing 0.3% per year (p = 0.01). Countries with higher DCD rates have, on average, lower DBD rates. For every one-per
million population (pmp) increase in the DCD rate, the average DBD rate decreased by 1.02 pmp (95% CI: 0.73, 1.32;
p,0.0001). We also found that the number of organs transplanted per donor was significantly lower in DCD when
compared to DBD donors with 1.51 less transplants per DCD compared to DBD (95% CI: 1.23, 1.79; p,0.001). Whilst the
results do not infer a causal relationship between increased DCD and decreased DBD rates, the significant correlation
between higher DCD and lower DBD rates coupled with the reduced number of organs transplanted per DCD donor
suggests that a national policy focus on DCD may lead to an overall reduction in the number of transplants performed.

Introduction
Since the first successful kidney transplant at Harvard University more than a half century ago [1], organ transplantation has
become the preferred modality for the treatment of organ failure
and has led to improved survival, decreased morbidity, significantly improvement to quality of life and reduced healthcare costs.
Improvements in both clinical outcomes and availability of organs
for transplant worldwide now enable more than 100,000 patients
annually to receive an organ that will either save, or dramatically
improve their lives [2]. Unfortunately, in all countries that have
organ transplant programs, the demand for transplanted organs
far exceeds the number of organs available with current estimates
showing that there are approximately 1.7 million people in need of
a solid organ transplant worldwide [3].
Throughout the past 30 years, a broad range of organ donation
policies have been adopted worldwide in an effort to address the
ever-widening gap between organ supply and demand. These have
included public outreach and education campaigns, pecuniary
incentives to encourage donation, paired kidney exchange
programs, utilization of organs from expanded criteria donors
(ECD), and enactment of presumed consent (opt-out) legislation.
In recent years, the policy change that has attracted the most
attention and the most professional and bureaucratic support has
been the shift to the adoption of policies that promote donation
after cardiocirculatory death.
In most countries (especially those with a common law tradition)
death is defined by reference either to irreversible cessation of the
circulatory system (asystole) or irreversible cessation of brain
function (brain death) [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Following the
definition of irreversible cessation of brain function as death by
the Harvard Ad Hoc Committee in 1968 and the dissemination of
clinical criteria and tests for the diagnosis of brain death, donation
after brain death (DBD) became the established mechanism of
organ donation–dramatically increasing the number of donor
organs, increasing the number of viable organs that could be
recovered from donors, improving transplant outcomes and
extending the indications for transplantation.

While most countries rely upon DBD for the vast majority of
organs retrieved from deceased donors, in certain situations, some
organs can be recovered from patients whose hearts have recently
stopped beating. This procedure, which is known as donation after
cardiocirculatory death (DCD), involves careful coordination of
the time of asystole with the commencement of organ retrieval.
And while transplant outcomes for DCD livers are generally
poorer than those recovered from DBD donors [9], DCD kidneys
show similar graft survival rates to DBD [10] and DCD lung graft
survival rates may eclipse those of DBD [11]. Although complex,
and at times controversial [12], [13], [14], DCD provides an
additional pathway for obtaining much needed donor organs.
In an attempt to define standardized methodologies appropriate
for DCDs, the First International Workshop on DCD held in
Maastricht in 1995 defined four categories of DCD [15]. These
are:
Category I: Dead on Arrival (Uncontrolled (uDCD))
Category II: Unsuccessful Resuscitation (Uncontrolled (uDCD))
Category III: Awaiting Cardiac Arrest (Controlled (cDCD))
Category IV: Cardiac Arrest While Brain Dead (Controlled
(cDCD))
While suggestions have been made that many Category III
DCD donors might become brain dead were they allowed to
progress [16], [17], Category III DCD is, by far, the most widely
practiced [18].
In the last 10 years there has been a marked worldwide increase
in the number of countries that have adopted policies promoting
DCD. A recent study, prepared on behalf of European Committee
on Organ Transplantation, identified 10 countries in Europe that
have adopted or are in the process of adopting policies to promote
the use of DCD [18]. The United States and Canada have both
vigorously pursued DCD policies [19], [20], [21], and in Latin
America, DCD donation has also been reported in Bolivia, Brazil
and Colombia. In Australia, the Commonwealth Government
recently allocated large amounts of funding [22] to support
strategies aimed at improving its consistently low deceased organ
donation rates, including the adoption of policies that promote
DCD [23].
While it has generally been assumed that DCD provides an
effective pathway toward increasing donation rates, the impact
that DCD has had on deceased organ transplantation rates and
DBD rates worldwide has generally not been quantified. In this
study, we analyzed deceased donation (DD) rates from 2000–2010
for 82 countries that have reported results to international organ
donation bodies to determine what effect policy shifts to increase
DCD rates have had on deceased organ transplantation and DBD
rates.
Methods
Rates for deceased solid organ donation and transplantation,
DBD and DCD (both uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) and controlled
(cDCD)) were collected from: the Agence de la Biome´decine, the
Council of Europe, Eurotransplant, the International Registry of
Donation and Transplantation (IRODaT), Nederlandse Transplantatie Stichting, the NHS Blood and Transplant Organisation,
the Organizacio´n Nacional de Trasplantes (ONT) and the United
Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS)/US Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network (OPTN), for countries that reported
organ transplantation activity for the period of 2000–2010
(Appendix S1).
Countries were categorized into three groups, according to the
number of deceased donations recorded annually. Group One
were defined as those countries where the DD rate was at least 20
per million population (pmp) per year for at least five years
between 2000 and 2010 inclusive. Group Two countries were
those countries with a DD rate greater than or equal to 10 but less
than 20 pmp per year for at least five years and Group Three were
all other countries with less than 10 DD pmp per year for at least
five years. Countries that reported deceased donation rates which
never exceeded 0.1 DD pmp were excluded from analysis.
Linear mixed models were fitted to:
1) DBD rate pmp, with (a) DCD rate pmp as an explanatory
variable; (b) cDCD rate pmp as an explanatory variable; (c)
uDCD rate pmp an explanatory variable;
2) Organ Transplant rate pmp, with DBD and DCD rate as an
explanatory variables;
3) Number of transplanted organs, with donor type (DBD or
DCD) as an explanatory variable.
To account for the repeated measurements each model
included year as a covariate with a random intercept and slope
for each country [24]. The country Group was included as a
categorical variable in all the models, with an interaction with
year, to allow for different trends over time.
Results were considered statistically significant if p,0.05.
Model checking was conducted by examining predicted values
with observed and residual plots. For plots, a line of the predicted
values was generated using Lowess smoothing [25]. All analyses
and plots were conducted in StataTM 12 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX USA).
Results
Eighty-two (82) countries were identified as reporting any organ
transplantation activity for the period of 2000–2010 and were
included in our study. These countries, by geographic region,
were:
Africa –5 countries (Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, South
Africa); Asia –10 countries (Bangladesh, Brunei, Hong Kong
SARC, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South
Korea, Taiwan); Europe –35 countries (Austria, Belgium,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,
Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova,
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia,
Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United
Kingdom); Latin America –18 countries (Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic,
Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay,
Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela); Middle East –
10 countries (Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey); North America –2
countries (Canada, USA); and, Oceania –2 countries (Australia
and New Zealand).
Of the 82 countries, 10 reported DD rates less than 0.1 pmp
(Algeria, Bangladesh, Brunei, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Libya,
Morocco, Pakistan and Philippines) and were excluded from
analysis. Thirty-one (31) of these 82 countries reported DCD
donations (Table 1).
Observed Trends in Group One Countries ($20 DD pmp
Per Year)
Group One included the following seven countries (listed in
order of highest to lowest DD rates): Spain, Portugal, USA,
Belgium, Austria, France and Italy. Of the countries that reported
DCD donations in this group, Italy reported the lowest DCD rates

at ,1% of total DD, and Belgium reported the highest (21.71% of
total DD in 2009). Portugal had no reported DCD donations.
Spain and France utilized only uDCD.
The subset of these eight Group One countries that reported the
highest sustained DD rates ($25 DD pmp) consisted of three
countries: Spain, Portugal and the USA. Of these three highest
performing countries, only the USA had a DCD rate of more than
10% of overall DD (11.84% in 2010).
Of the entire Group One ($20 DD pmp) cohort, only Belgium
had a DCD rate above 12%. Much of the growth in Belgium’s
DCD rate that occurred in the past 5 years correlated with a
decrease in its DBD rates (Appendix S2).
With the exception of Belgium and Austria, all Group One
countries maintained or showed a trend to increasing overall DD
rates 2000–2010. In all cases, the increases in DD were due to
sustained or increased donation after brain death, not donation
after cardiocirculatory death (Appendix S2). Overall, there was a
very strong relationship between high rates of DD and high rates
of DBD.
Observed Trends in Group Two Countries (,20 but $10
DD pmp Per Year)
Group Two included the following 26 countries (listed in
order of highest to lowest DD rates): Norway, Croatia, Malta,
Ireland, Estonia, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary,
Uruguay, Latvia, Cuba, UK, Germany, Argentina, Slovak
Republic, Australia, Netherlands, Canada, Denmark, Sweden,
Switzerland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland and Costa Rica.
Of these, the Czech Republic, Latvia, UK, Switzerland,
Australia, Netherlands, and Canada reported DCD activity of
$1 DCD pmp during one or more years of the time period
studied. Norway, Croatia, Malta, Ireland, Estonia and Slovenia
showed the highest overall DD rates, with sustained rates of
$18 DD pmp. None of these countries reported DCD rates
during the time period analyzed.
Amongst Group Two countries, as a percentage of total DD,
Latvia reported the highest DCD percentage rate (53.8% in 2002)
with the Netherlands reporting the highest sustained percentage
with 37% during the time period 2000–2010 (Appendix S3).
During this same period, the overall DD rate in the Netherlands
remained largely stable between 12–13 DD pmp. The stasis of the
Netherland’s DD rate was associated with a decline in DBD and
an increase in DCD. The UK, Australia and (most recently)
Canada all demonstrated increasing DCD growth rates coupled
with static (Australia) or declining DBD rates (UK and Canada)
during this period (Appendix S3).
Of the countries in Group Two that reported DCD donations,
in both proportional and absolute terms, the Czech Republic
reported the lowest DCD rates, with DCD rates never surpassing
0.3 pmp (or 1.5% of its total DD).
With the exception of Latvia (between 2004–2007), none of the
countries in Group Two that reported DCD activity of $2% of
total donors achieved sustained DD total rates .17 DD pmp.
Other than Australia, all Group Two countries that reported DCD
rates of $2% of total DD showed reductions in overall DD rates
over the time period studied (Appendix S3).

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e62010

Observed Trends in Group Three Countries (,10 DD
pmp Per Year)
Group Three included the following 39 countries (listed in order
of highest to lowest DD rates): Iceland, Cyprus, Colombia, Israel,
New Zealand, Chile, Brazil, Greece, Taiwan, Hong Kong SARC,
Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Panama, Turkey, South
Africa, Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, Bahrain, Romania, Peru, South
Korea, Russia, Bulgaria, Bolivia, Ecuador, Lebanon, Paraguay,
Tunisia, Japan, Moldova, Malaysia, Dominican Republic, Ukraine, Guatemala, Trinidad & Tobago and Jordan. Of these,
Colombia, Hong Kong, Israel, New Zealand, Singapore, Saudi
Arabia, South Korea, Russia and Japan reported DCD activity.
With a peak of 1.40 DCD pmp, Russia showed the highest level of
DCD in all Group Three countries with Japan showing the second
highest level at 0.80 DCD pmp. Despite maintaining relatively low
DD rates that never exceeded 1.0 DD pmp, as a percentage of
total DD donors, Japan showed the highest percentage rate of
DCD donors of any country in our study with a DCD rate of
between 66–100% of DD during the study period (Appendix S4).
Trends Over Time (All Countries)
There was a very wide range and high degree of variability
between the DD, DCD, DBD and transplantation rates between
the 82 countries. Figure 1 shows the overall average DD, DBD
and DCD rates over time. By definition, the overall DD rate is
equal to the DBD rate plus the DCD rate. DCD makes a relatively
small contribution to the DD rate, but the proportion is increasing
over time, on average 0.3% increase per year (p = 0.01). The
average DD, DBD and DCD rates all increased over time by
Group (Figure 2), but with differing slopes. Over the period, the
average DD, DBD and DCD rates increased most for Group One
countries and the least for Group Three.
DBD versus DCD Rates
Figure 3 shows the DBD rates versus (a) overall DCD rates
and by (b) cDCD and (c) uDCD rates respectively. For every unit
pmp increase in the DCD rate, the average DBD rate decreased
by 1.02 pmp (95% CI: 0.73, 1.32; p,0.0001). Similarly, for every
unit pmp increase in the cDCD rate, the average DBD rate
decreased by 0.84 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.24; p = 0.0014). And for every
unit pmp increase in the uDCD rate, the average DBD rate
decreased by 0.50 (95% CI: 21.62, 0.62; p = 0.438).

Number of Organs Transplanted
Figure 4 shows the transplant rates versus DBD (Figure 4a)
and DCD rates (Figure 4b). The estimated increase in the
average number of transplants pmp is 1.30 for every unit pmp
increase in the DBD rate (95% CI: 0.56, 2.05; p,0.001). The
estimated increase in the average number of transplants pmp for
every unit pmp increase in DCD rate pmp is 1.15, (95% CI: 0.32,
1.98; p = 0.007). Figure 5 shows the mean difference between
number of transplants by DBD and DCD donor type is 1.51 (95%
CI: 1.23, 1.79; p,0.001).
Discussion
Policies that emphasize DCD may be adopted for many
reasons–principally to capture the increased number of people
surviving initial trauma (that previously may have led to BD) and
as a political strategy to increase the donor pool. While our data
does not allow us to distinguish the reasons behind increasing
DCD rates, our results reveal that higher rates of donation after
cardiocirculatory death are associated with lower DBD rates,
reduced organ transplantation rates and that high DCD rates are
most frequently linked with the lower-middle range deceased
donation rates of Group Two countries. High DBD rates and not
high DCD rates appear to be the determining factor of the high
DD rates (.20 pmp) observed in Group One countries. As this is
an ecological study, we cannot say that the adoption of DCD
policies are the cause of lower DBD rates as reasons for the lower
DBD rates cannot be linked directly to DCD rates. Nevertheless,

while there may be a number of factors contributing to reductions
in DBD rates in countries that increasingly focus on DCD [26],
our study provides support for the contention that DCD donors
are, at least in part, being sourced from potential DBD donors
[27].
Other factors, including increasing levels of public safety,
improvements in resuscitation technology, and improved neurological treatment protocols for acute brain injury may also explain
reductions in DBD rates [28]. It is worth noting, however, that
recent global analysis of national stroke and traffic fatality rates
(the most frequent causes of deaths that lead to organ donation)
demonstrates clearly that the rapidly declining rates for these types
of death in Group One ($20 DD pmp) countries over the past two
decades, has not negatively impacted upon these countries’ high
DBD rates [29]. It is also noteworthy that several of the countries
with the highest DBD rates had amongst the lowest stroke and
traffic fatality rates [29].
Our results also show a significant differential between the
number of organs transplanted from each donor type. While we
did not examine potential reasons for the reduced number of
organs transplanted in DCD, recent research has shown that the
number of liver retrievals is particularly affected by DCD [30].
This, in itself, does not suggest that DCD policies should be
curtailed or abandoned. It does, however, illustrate a potential
limitation of DCD upon organ transplantation and the need for
ongoing research to improve organ and patient outcomes
following DCD.
There are a number of potential limitations to this study, due
primarily to two factors. First, as mentioned previously, because
this is an ecological study, causal relationships cannot be inferred
from our results. Second, completing the data set for such a large
number of countries required us to draw from multiple data
sources (Appendix S1). Because different organizations and
registries rely upon different metrics, standards and personnel for
data collection and reporting, this may have introduced variation
into the data set. Nevertheless, this study represents the most
comprehensive international analysis of DCD yet undertaken.
While improvements in organ and patient outcomes – both
from DCD and DBD donors – will undoubtedly continue, our
results show that, per donor, DCD reduces the number of
transplants performed when compared to DBD. The risk,
therefore, is that if policies that promote DCD come at the
expense of DBD, they may come at a high cost and may not be the
most appropriate long-term strategy for improving organ transplantation rates. While DCD policies undoubtedly have an
important role to play in comprehensive national frameworks for
organ donation, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that efforts
aimed at significantly increasing transplantation rates ultimately
require the implementation of policies that increase the identification of more DBD donors [31] and a serious reconsideration of
approaches to the ‘‘active management’’ of dying and the use of
technology at the end of life.
