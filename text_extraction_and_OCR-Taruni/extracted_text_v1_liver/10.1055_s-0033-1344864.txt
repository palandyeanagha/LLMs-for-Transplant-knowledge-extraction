Bile leak from the duct of Luschka treated
with double-balloon enteroscopy ERCP
in a patient with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
Bile leaks after laparoscopic cholecystectomy are usually treated using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The presence of complex, surgically altered gastrointestinal anatomy
poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the endoscopic treatment of these
lesions. Herein, we present a patient with
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who developed
a bile leak after cholecystectomy and underwent endoscopic therapy using double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) ERCP.
A 59-year-old patient with Roux-en-Y
anatomy underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with removal of a large and
inflamed gallbladder. The patient developed abdominal pain and fever postoperatively. A computed tomography
scan was performed and revealed a fluid
collection near the gallbladder fossa,
which measured 5.2 × 2.8 cm. A percutaneous drain was placed and the patient
was sent to our hospital for further surgical treatment. We performed a DBE ERCP,
and cholangiogram through the native
papilla revealed a bile leak from the right
hepatic duct, consistent with a leak from
the duct of Luschka (●" Fig. 1 a, b). A double pigtail plastic stent was placed
(●" Fig. 1 c). The bile drainage from the
percutaneous leak resolved over the subsequent 72 hours.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first case report of successful endoscopic
treatment of a bile leak from the duct of
Luschka in a patient with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass using DBE ERCP. This case also
highlights the possibility of bile leaks
occurring distal to the cystic duct stump.
The duct of Luschka is an anomaly that
directly connects the hepatic ducts to the
gallbladder, draining a portion of the right
lobe of the liver [1, 2]. When accidentally
severed, it may cause a bile leak leading to
biloma formation [1–3]. In patients with
normal upper gastrointestinal anatomy,
ERCP with stent placement and/or sphincterotomy is an effective therapy [2, 3].
Although successful biliary cannulation
rates in Roux-en-Y situations are lower,
we believe that ERCP using DBE should be
attempted first, as shown in this case.
In summary, we have shown that an endoscopic approach using advanced ERCP
with a double-balloon enteroscope was
effective in treating a postoperative leak
in a patient with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, thus sparing the patient from having
to undergo a more invasive surgical intervention.
