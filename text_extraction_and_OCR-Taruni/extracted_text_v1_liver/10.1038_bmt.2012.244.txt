TECHNICAL REPORT
Investigation of the freely available easy-to-use software
‘EZR’ for medical statistics
Y Kanda
Although there are many commercially available statistical software packages, only a few implement a competing risk analysis or a
proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates, which are necessary in studies on hematopoietic SCT. In
addition, most packages are not clinician friendly, as they require that commands be written based on statistical languages. This
report describes the statistical software ‘EZR’ (Easy R), which is based on R and R commander. EZR enables the application of
statistical functions that are frequently used in clinical studies, such as survival analyses, including competing risk analyses and the
use of time-dependent covariates, receiver operating characteristics analyses, meta-analyses, sample size calculation and so on, by
point-and-click access. EZR is freely available on our website (http://www.jichi.ac.jp/saitama-sct/SaitamaHP.files/statmed.html) and
runs on both Windows (Microsoft Corporation, USA) and Mac OS X (Apple, USA). This report provides instructions for the installation
and operation of EZR.

INTRODUCTION
There are many commercially available statistical software
packages, including SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA), SPSS
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Stata (Stata Corporation,
College Station, TX, USA). These packages are widely used in
the area of medical statistics.1 However, some of these
packages do not implement a competing risk analysis or
proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent
(TD) covariates, which are necessary in studies on hematopoietic SCT.2–4 In addition, most packages are not clinician
friendly, as they require that commands be written based on
statistical languages. R is an open-source freely available
software environment for statistical computing and graphics.5
R supports many functions for statistical analyses, but also
requires that the user write commands based on the S
statistical language. R commander provides an easy-to-use
basic-statistics graphical user interface for R.6 However, the
statistical functions of R commander are limited, especially
those in the field of medical statistics. Therefore, I added
statistical functions, such as survival analyses, including
competing risk analyses and the use of TD covariates, receiver
operating characteristics analyses, meta-analyses, sample size
calculation and so on, to R commander (version 1.6–3) based on
R (version 2.13.0). The result, called ‘EZR’ (Easy R), is available on
our website (http://www.jichi.ac.jp/saitama-sct/SaitamaHP.files/
statmed.html).7 EZR runs on both Windows (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) and Mac OS X (Apple,
Cupertino, CA, USA). A complete manual for EZR is currently
available only in Japanese.8 EZR comes with ‘absolutely no
warranty’, just like R itself, and the conditions for redistribution
are the same as those for R and R commander (under the GNU
General Public License).
INSTALLATION OF EZR
For Windows users, the only required file for installation is
EZRsetupENG.exe, which can be downloaded from our
website.7 EZR is installed along with R and R commander just
by running this installer on Windows XP, VISTA, 7 or 8 (both
32- and 64-bit versions). The default folder for EZR installation
is ‘C:\ProgramFiles\EZR’, which is different from the default
installation folder for R, and therefore the installation of EZR
does not interfere with R, which may already be installed. After
installation is complete, a shortcut to launch EZR will appear on
the desktop. The default data folder is ‘C:\EZRDATA’, but the data
folder can be changed by right-clicking on this shortcut, selecting
‘Properties’, and replacing the folder name in the ‘Start in:’ column
on the ‘Shortcut’ tab.
The installation of EZR on Mac OS X is more complicated, but
instructions for installation can be found on our website. The
following instructions are based on EZR on Windows, but can be
applied to EZR on OS X, with some exceptions, such as importing
Excel files and creating a new data set on EZR, which are not
available in EZR on OS X.
BASIC OPERATIONS IN EZR
EZR can be started by double-clicking on the shortcut on the
desktop or selecting EZR from the ‘Start menu’, which causes two
windows to appear on the desktop. The window entitled ‘R
Console’ on the title bar is the main window for R. This window is
not used for usual operation in EZR, but should not be closed, as EZR
runs on R. The other window entitled ‘EZR on R Commander’ is the
main operating window for EZR (Figure 1). Functions of EZR can be
selected from the menu bar just below the title bar. This menu bar

includes the following items: ‘File’, ‘Edit’, ‘Active data set’,
‘Statistical analysis’, ‘Graphs’, ‘Original menu’, ‘Tools’ and ‘Help’.
The user can tell EZR what they would like to do by two
methods. First, they can type R commands in the ‘Script window’
and click on the ‘Submit’ button. The alternative method is easier
for beginners. EZR functions can be started by point-and-click
access using the items on the menu bar. EZR automatically creates
and executes corresponding R commands that appear in the
‘Script window’. Results are shown in the ‘Output window’. If
any errors or warnings are noted, messages will appear in the
‘Message window’. The created commands can be saved by
selecting ‘File’4‘Save script as’ on the menu bar. The output can
be saved by selecting ‘File’4‘Save output as’. By saving the
commands, users can reproduce the analyses and can also share
the procedure with the other investigators.
CREATING, MODIFYING AND SAVING AN R DATA SET
Windows users can create a new data set directly on EZR by
selecting ‘File’4‘New data set’. However, it is more convenient
to create a data set using spreadsheet applications such as
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation). Data sets saved as Excel
files (.xls or.xlsx) or comma-separated value (CSV) files (.csv) can be
imported to EZR by selecting ‘File’4‘Import data’4‘From Excel,
Access or dBase data set’ or ‘File’4‘Import data’4‘Read Text
Data From File, Clipboard or URL’, respectively, except that Excel
files cannot be imported in EZR on OS X. Alternatively, users can
import data by a copy-and-paste approach. Data of interest,
copied from a spreadsheet, text file, web site and so on, can be
imported into EZR by selecting ‘File’4‘Import data’4‘Read Text
Data From File, Clipboard or URL’. Authors should choose
‘Clipboard’ for ‘Location of Data file’ and ‘Tabs’ for ‘Field Separator’
on the dialog to paste from a spreadsheet. EZR can also import
SPSS data and Stata data.
In the following instructions, a sample data set that includes 93
fictional patients who received Allo-SCT for acute leukemia will be
used. The data set file, ‘sample.csv’, is available at the http://
www.jichi.ac.jp/saitama-sct/SaitamaHP.files/sample.csv. Users can
directly import the file into EZR by choosing ‘Internet URL’ for
‘Location of Data file’ after selecting ‘File’4‘Import data’4‘Read
Text Data From File, Clipboard, or URL’. Imported data can be
viewed by clicking on the ‘View’ button and directly edited by
clicking on the ‘Edit’ button. The list of variables in the data set
can be shown by selecting ‘Active data set’4‘Variables’4‘Show
variables in active data set’. In addition, users can create new
variables or modify existing variables using the functions under
‘Active data set’ on the menu bar. For example, this sample data
set has a continuous variable called ‘Age’ that represents the
patient’s age. If a user wants to create a categorical variable,
‘Age40’, which has a value of 0 for patients less than 40 years
old and 1 for those at least 40 years old, they can select ‘Active
data set’4‘Variables’4‘Bin numeric variable with specified

threshold’. In the dialog, users can select ‘Age’ from the list of
numeric variables, input ‘Age40’ in the ‘New variable name’
column and input ‘40’ in the ‘Threshold to bin a numeric variable’
column. Alternatively, a new variable can be created by selecting
‘Active data set’4‘Variables’4‘Create new variable’. This
function enables more complex computing. For example, if a
user wants to create a categorical variable ‘ElderlyMale’,
which would have a value of 1 for male patients aged at least
60 years old and 0 for other patients, they would input
‘ifelse(Age4¼ 60 & Sex ¼ ‘Male’, 1, 0)’ in the ‘Expression to
compute’ column in the dialog.
When a categorical variable with more than two categories is to
be analyzed in Fine and Gray regression modeling, ‘dummy’
variables should be created before analysis, although such
‘dummy’ variables are automatically created in multiple regression, logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression
in R. For example, if a user wants to evaluate the effect of the type
of stem cell graft, information for which is included in the
categorical variable ‘Source’ as ‘BM’, peripheral blood ‘PB’ and
cord blood ‘CB’, they would select ‘Active data set’4
‘Variables’4‘Create dummy variables’ to make three categorical variables named ‘Source.Dummy.BM’, ‘Source.Dummy.PB’ and
‘Source.Dummy.CB’. ‘Source.Dummy.BM’ has a value of 1 for
patients who received BM graft and 0 for others. Users should
choose one of the three categories as a reference and input
dummy variables for the other two categories into the regression
model. The effect size, 95% confidence interval and P-value for
each category with respect to the reference category will then be
shown. If a user directly inputs a categorical variable into multiple
regression, logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards
regression, the automatically created dummy variables are shown
as ‘Source [T.CB]’ or ‘Source [T.PB]’, for example. The stepwise
selection function of explanatory variables based on Akaike
information criterion and Bayesian information criterion only
accepts these automatically created dummy variables, whereas
stepwise selection based on P-value also accepts dummy variables
created by a user using EZR. If the option for a ‘Wald test for
overall P-value for factors with 42 levels’ is selected in the dialog
of the regression analyses, the overall P-value for the categorical
variable will be calculated.
The modified data set can be saved as an R file (.rda) by clicking
the ‘Save’ button or selecting ‘File’4‘Active data set’4‘Save
active data set’. Only the active data set, as indicated in the
column just to the right of ‘Data set:’ is saved. The saved data set
can be reloaded to EZR by selecting ‘File’4‘Load data set’.
SUMMARIZING DATA
Descriptive statistics enable the user to glance over features of the
data, such as the distribution of or outliers among continuous
variables. The proportion of categorical variables is shown
by selecting ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Discrete variables’4
‘Frequency distributions’. The mean value with the s.d. along
with the minimum, median and maximum values of continuous
variables are shown by selecting ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Continuous variables’4‘Numerical summaries’, but plotting a histogram or a dot chart by selecting ‘Graphs’4‘Histogram’ or ‘Dot
chart’ may be more useful for evaluating the distribution of
continuous variables.
A table that shows patient characteristics can be easily created
by selecting ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Discrete variables’4‘Create
two-way table and compare two proportions’. A grouping
variable, ‘Source’ for example, should be specified in the ‘Column
variable’ list and categorical variables that are to be compared
among groups should be specified in the ‘Row variable’ list. More
than one variable can be selected by clicking variables while
pressing the ‘Ctrl’ key. A summary table will then be shown in the
‘Output window’ following the results of statistical tests (Fisher’s
exact test by default) to compare the proportions of each variable
among the groups. A formatted table for presentation can be
created by inputting ‘w.twoway()’ in the ‘Script window’ and
clicking on the ‘Submit’ button. The table will be copied to the
clipboard and can be pasted into a spreadsheet.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES FOR CATEGORICAL AND
CONTINUOUS VARIABLES
Statistical analysis functions for categorical variables, including
Fisher’s exact test, w2 test, McNemar test, Cochran Q test, Cochran–
Armitage test and logistic regression, can be accessed in the
‘Statistical analysis’4‘Discrete variables’ menu. Statistical
analysis functions for continuous variables, including the
Smirnov–Grubbs test, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, t-test, paired
t-test, F-test, Bartlett’s test, one-way analysis of variance, multi-way
analysis of variance, repeated-measures analysis of variance,
analysis of covariance, Pearson’s correlation test and linear
regression, can be accessed in the ‘Statistical analysis’4
‘Continuous variables’ menu. Nonparametric tests, including
the Mann–Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon’s signed rank test,
Kruskal–Wallis test, Friedman test, Jonckheere–Terpstra test and
Spearman’s rank correlation test, are available in the ‘Statistical
analysis’4‘Nonparametric tests’ menu.
SURVIVAL ANALYSIS
A survival analysis, which is often the primary end point of
studies on hematopoietic SCT, can be performed by
selecting statistical functions in the ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Survival analysis’ menu. For example, users can plot Kaplan–Meier
curves and compare survival curves among groups with a
log-rank test by selecting ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Survival analysis’4‘Kaplan-Meier survival curve and logrank test’. At least
two variables are required: a time-to-event variable, which
indicates the time to the occurrence of an event (death in
survival analysis) or time to the last evaluation for patients
without an event, and a status variable, which has a value
of 1 for event and 0 for no event. Users can choose many options
in the dialog that mainly involve plotting survival curves (Figures
2a and b). In the ‘Output window’, the results of log-rank test can
be found following the point estimations with 95% confidence
intervals of survival rates (Figures 3a and b). If more than 1
grouping variable is specified, a summary table will be shown,
which can be copied to the clipboard by the w.survival()
command (Figure 3c).
A Cox proportional hazards regression can be performed by
selecting ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Survival analysis’4‘Cox proportional hazard regression’. Users have to specify a time-toevent variable, a status variable (1 for event and 0 for no event)
and explanatory variables (Figure 4a). In addition, users can
choose the following options in the dialog; Wald test for overall
P-value for factors with 2 or more levels, test the proportional
hazards assumption, show the baseline survival curve and
stepwise selection of explanatory variables based on Akaike
information criterion, Bayesian information criterion and P-value.
In the ‘Output window’, the main result of Cox proportional
hazard regression can be found that includes the hazard ratios,
their 95% confidence intervals and P-values for each explanatory
variable, followed by the results of three tests for the global null
hypothesis (none of the explanatory variables is associated with
the response) (Figure 5a). A summary of proportional hazards
regression analysis, the results of Wald test and the results of
testing the proportional hazards assumption are shown below the
main result (Figure 5b), followed by the results of stepwise
selection of explanatory variables (Figure 5c), if requested. The
results of a proportional hazards regression analysis can be copied
to the clipboard by the w.multi() command. The output of this

command reflects the full model and not the model after stepwise
selection of explanatory variables. Survival curves adjusted for
other factors by the mean of covariates method, in which
average values of covariates are entered into the Cox proportional
hazards model, can be drawn by selecting ‘Graphs’4‘Adjusted
survival curve’.
A TD covariate can be incorporated in the Cox proportional
hazards regression in EZR. However, the function is limited to a
simple TD covariate. EZR can handle only one TD covariate, which
is initially 0 and may change to a value of 1 thereafter. For
example, if a user wants to evaluate the impact of grade II–IV
acute GVHD on survival, it is not appropriate to treat the
development of acute GVHD as if it were known before
transplantation, as patients who died or relapsed before the
development of GVHD would be included in the ‘no GVHD group’.
A variable whose value may change after transplantation should
be treated as a TD covariate, and this can be performed in EZR by
selecting ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Survival analysis’4‘Cox proportional hazard regression with time-dependent covariate’.
In this case, ‘AGVHD24’, which has a value of 1 for patients who
developed grade II–IV acute GVHD, should be selected in the ‘TD
covariate’ list. ‘DaysToAGVHD24’, which is the time from
transplantation to the development of grade II–IV acute
GVHD for patients who developed grade II–IV acute GVHD or
the time to the last evaluation for patients who did not develop
grade II–IV acute GVHD, should be specified in the ‘Time when TD
covariate changes from 0 to 1’ list. Other explanatory variables
should be specified in the same manner with Cox proportional
hazard regression, as described above. In the ‘Output window’,
the effect of grade II–IV acute GVHD will be shown in the row
‘covariate_td’.
COMPETING RISK ANALYSIS
A competing risk analysis is an important statistical function in
studies on hematopoietic SCT. For example, if an investigator
wants to analyze the cumulative incidence of relapse after
transplantation, death without relapse (non-relapse mortality)
precludes the occurrence of relapse. Previously, one minus
the Kaplan–Meier (1  KM) method of relapse while treating
deaths without relapse as censored observations has been
used to estimate the incidence of relapse. However, this
analysis overestimates the incidence of relapse, as it attempts to
predict the incidence of relapse when patients who actually die
would have relapsed. As a result, the sum of the incidence of
relapse, the incidence of non-relapse mortality and the probability
of relapse-free survival exceeds 100%. A more appropriate
estimate can be obtained using the cumulative incidence
function. This method subdivides the probability of failure
into the probability corresponding to each competing
event and provides an accurate incidence for each event. The
statistical significance of the difference in the cumulative
incidences of competing events among groups can be assessed
by Gray’s test.9 In addition, regression models for competing
risks data have been proposed by Fine and Gray,10 and by Klein
and Anderson.11
These competing risk analyses can be provided by adding the
‘cmprsk’ package to R.6 Excellent instructions for the use of this
package have been provided in this journal by Scrucca et al. in
2007 and 2010.12,13 EZR makes it possible to access these analyses
in a point-and-click manner. For example, the cumulative
incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality can be plotted
and compared among groups by selecting ‘Statistical
analysis’4‘Survival analysis’4‘Cumulative incidence of
competing events and Gray test’ (Figure 4b). Users have to
specify a time-to-event variable (‘DaysToDFS’ in this case, which
indicates the time to the earliest event or time to the last
evaluation for patients without any events), a status indicator
(‘CompRisk’, which has a value of 1 for relapse, 2 for non-relapse
mortality and 0 for no event), and grouping variables, if required
(‘Source’ in this case). The ‘Output window’ shows the results of
Gray’s test following the point estimations with 95% confidence
intervals of the cumulative incidences of each event. If a user
wants to plot cumulative incidence curves for only one of the

competing events, the number of event that corresponds to the
event of interest should be specified in the ‘Code of event to show
cumulative incidence rate’ column in the dialog. If more than 1
grouping variable is specified and only one of the events is
specified in the ‘Code of event to show cumulative incidence rate’
column, a summary table will be shown, which can be copied to
the clipboard by the w.ci() command (Figure 6b). A graph that
shows the cumulative incidences in a stacked manner can be
plotted by selecting ‘Graphs’4‘Stacked cumulative incidences’
(Figure 6c).
Fine and Gray regression modeling can be performed from the
menu, ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Survival analysis’4‘Fine-Gray
proportional hazard regression for competing events’. Users
have to specify a time-to-event variable, a status variable, the
number of event corresponding to the event of interest and
explanatory variables. The results of a regression analysis can be
copied to the clipboard by the w.multi(crr.table) command. When
we consider the sample file, if the effect of the use of PB or CB
compared with BM on the incidence of relapse is evaluated by
adjusting for age, disease risk and conditioning regimen, the use
of PB as stem cell graft is significantly associated with an increased
incidence of relapse with a subdistribution hazard ratio of 2.37
(95% confidence interval: 1.11–5.04; P ¼ 0.025). However, this
result should be considered with caution, as the overall P-value for
stem cell graft was 0.070 by the Wald test, which can be calculated
by checking this option in the dialog.
I should note that the log-rank test and Cox proportional
hazards regression are also valid analyses of competing risks data.
In these analyses, cause-specific hazard function is evaluated
instead of the cumulative incidence function, censoring
events other than the event of interest. Therefore, the time-toevent variable should indicate the time to the earliest event or
time to the last evaluation for patients without any events, and the
status variable should have a value of 1 for event of interest and 0
for other events or no event. The choice and interpretation of
these statistical tests for competing risks data are discussed
elsewhere.14
FINAL REMARKS
In addition to the functions introduced above, EZR enables
the analysis of diagnostic tests in the ‘Statistical analysis’4
‘Accuracy of diagnostic test’ menu, matched-pair analysis
in the ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Matched-pair analysis’ menu,
meta-analysis in the ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Metaanalysis
and metaregression’ menu and a sample size calculation
in the ‘Statistical analysis’4‘Calculate sample size’ menu. A
variety of graphs can be accessed in the ‘Graphs’ menu and the
statistical functions that were included in the original R
commander can be found in the ‘Original menu’. Created
graphs can be copied to the clipboard from the menu of the
graph window, ‘File’4‘Copy to the clipboard’, either as a
bitmap or as a metafile. I hope that EZR will help researchers to
perform statistical analyses, especially in clinical studies on
hematopoietic SCT.
