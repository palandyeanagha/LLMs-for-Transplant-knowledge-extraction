INTRODUCTION
Historically, hepatitis C has 
been a disease with an enormous 
impact on populations at a 
worldwide level. It is a pathology 
that develops over many years and 
sometimes over decades, which 
obliges a strong mobilization 
of health services in terms of 
human resources, technologies 
and capital. According to the 
natural history of the disease [1], 
it has a predictable evolution. In 
some advanced situations, it may

ABSTRACT
Background & Aims: To combat hepatitis C virus (HCV) and achieve its elimination by 2030, the emphasis 
should be on public health policies. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of epidemiology of HCV in 
Romanian risk groups that are characterized by higher occurrence densities with the aid of The Let’s End 
HepC (LEHC) project.
Methods: The LEHC project addressed the modelling of HCV epidemiology, being applied in several countries, 
one of which is Romania. The model comprised an integrated solution of public health policies focused on 
the disease, using Adaptive Conjoint Analysis and Markov chains systems. This tool allowed the quantitative 
evaluation of public health policies‘ impact, for every year until 2030, in five population groups: people who 
inject drugs (PWID), prisoners, individuals who have received blood products, children at risk for vertical 
transmission, and the remnant population. 
Results: It appears that Romania was already making great efforts in the context of public policies, allowing 
the achievement of HCV elimination by 2028 if current policies were maintained. Through additional work 
and greater efforts in further implementing public policies, the LEHC model estimated the possibility of 
anticipating this outcome to 2026.
Conclusion: The LEHC model estimated an anticipation of the HCV elimination year in Romania to be 2026 
if the twenty-four health policies in the study are fully implemented and consistently maintained over the years.
Key words: hepatitis C − modeling − public policies − public health.

lead to liver hepatocellular carcinoma, representing the seventh 
cause of hepatic mortality worldwide [2]. There are significant 
costs associated with this pathology, such as liver transplants 
and indirect costs caused by the transmissibility of the disease.
Around ten population groups are considered at risk for 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection: aboriginal and indigenous 
communities, children at risk for vertical transmission, specific 
birth cohorts, hemodialysis patients, individuals coinfected 
with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), people 
who inject drugs (PWID) [3-5], migrants from countries with 
high HCV prevalence rates, prisoners [6-8], people who have 
received blood products [9-10], war veterans, baby boomers 
and others [11-13]. 
Over the past thirty years, the epidemiological forecast has 
set HCV prevalence rates between 0.5% and 3.5% in European

countries [14, 15], and in some countries outside Europe it 
is possible to find values between 7% to 8% [16]. However, 
successive epidemiological revisions have found lower HCV 
prevalence rates [17], whose values are between 0.2% and 1.5% 
in European countries [18]. 
Traditionally, Romania is identified as one of the countries 
where high prevalence values of HCV were historically 
predicted [19, 20]. Therefore, it was chosen to integrate the 
country pool of the Let’s End HepC (LEHC) project’s first 
phase, which was developed by the Unit of Public Healthcare 
of Healthcare Sciences Institute/Catholic University of Portugal 
(ICS/UCP). In addition to Romania, other countries have also 
participated in the first phase of the LEHC project (“htttp://
www.letsendhepc.com/”). 
In this study, we investigated the dynamics of the 
epidemiology in risk groups that are characterized by higher 
occurrence densities: PWID, prisoners, people who received 
at least one blood transfusion or other blood-derived 
products, children who contracted the HCV infection from 
their mothers during pregnancy (vertical transmission) 
and the remnant population (the general population from 
which the aforementioned risk groups were excluded). This 
analysis was the foundation for an impact study related to the 
epidemiological dynamics of twenty-four public health policies 
in order to estimate annual results up to 2030, knowing that one 
of the Sustainable Development Goals [21] aims at eradicating 
HCV until that year. 
METHODS
The modeling of epidemiological evolution was achieved 
by using Markov chains, allocating the aforementioned risk 
groups in a total of 1100 active branches. This method also 
integrated each of the health states that the patient might 
assume, over the various stages of the Cure Cascade, as well 
as the associated annual probability of transition from health 
status according to the article published by Salomon et al. [1] 
in 2003. 
The model organised public health policies under a Cure 
Cascade reading, with each policy having different impact 
degrees according to data collected from Key Opinion Leaders 
(KOL) in the country, by resorting to a reading with an 
Adaptive Conjoint Analysis (ACA) inquiry system. Therefore, 
each policy impacted specific zones of the Markov chain, 
differentiating the forecasting results of the epidemiological 
model (further details in “Public Health Policies impact in 
HCV epidemiological modeling: a tool towards a microelimination path”).
Remnant population and vertical transmission
The remnant population’s demography was obtained by 
assessing the country’s total resident population and live births, 
according to the Romanian National Institute of Statistics (NIS) 
and projections from Eurostat. The annual probability of death 
for both genders was estimated according to a life table reported 
by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) [22]. 
HCV incidence values were aligned with modeling studies 
[19, 23, 24] that reported new cases of HCV infections in the 
country. For the years that were not possible to extract inputs, 
values were adjusted to follow the identified trend. As a result, 
low rates were considered since 1950, registering a gradual 
increase until 1999 and decreasing for the following years. 
HCV incidence rates related to vertical transmission were 
also accounted for in the remnant population, representing 
the number of live births infected with HCV. Until 1998 no 
data were found regarding this epidemiological indicator in 
Romania. However, for the period 1999-2007, there is data 
related to non-A, non-B Hepatitis cases reported by the 
Public Health Directorates. For the following years, data were 
extracted from hospital reports.
Regarding the HCV prevalence, it was estimated that in 
2008 this rate was close to 2.6% [19]. Likewise, since 1950, low 
rates were considered along with a gradual increase until 1999 
and a decrease for the following years. 
Up until 1998, it was assumed that the diagnose of 
hepatitis C was still not conducted, therefore it is considered 
0%. For the period 1999-2018, a cumulative diagnose rate of 
approximately 16% [20, 25-27] was considered, regardless of 
gender, age group and disease stage (as for blood products and 
prisoners’ populations). Acknowledging that the remaining 
epidemiological indicators corresponded to the ones identified 
in an initial diagnosis phase, the year 1999 was assumed as the 
year in which data should be set. 
To estimate the rate of people who were retained in care 
(RIC), a report by the Romanian Public Health Institute was 
consulted. According to this document, the number of patients 
who have been hospitalized was divided by the estimated 
number of people having hepatitis C in 2008, which resulted 
in a RIC rate of 9% [25], assumed as constant for the period 
1999-2018.
In Romania, hepatitis C treatments were only made 
available in 2002. Despite treatments were only reimbursed 
for naive patients, all the diagnosed individuals were included 
in the first treatment for chronic hepatitis C (Tx1). This rate 
was initially assumed as 5%, slightly increasing each year until 
14.9% in 2009 [25], remaining constant until 2016. Since that 
year, this rate was considered to be close to 27.65% [28], for 
both genders and all the age groups.
The commercialization of direct antiviral agents (DAAs) 
treatments in Romania began by the end of 2015, with 2016 
being the year at which data should be considered for Tx2 
(probability of an infected individual being retreated against 
HCV if already RIC and previously treated). The rate of patients 
being retreated if RIC and who have been previously treated 
was determined by consulting the number of individuals 
declared as being treated with DAA therapies by the National 
Health Insurance House. Therefore, the Tx2 rate for the period 
2016-2018 was determined to be around 10.1%, regardless of 
gender and age groups, only accounting for patients in the F4 
disease stage (according to Metavir score).
Two studies [29, 30] were used to determine sustained 
virologic response (SVR) rates for patients who followed Tx1. 
A study that included a patient’s cohort for the period between 
2004-2008, mentioned that the SVR for naive patients was 
59.56%. Therefore, this value was assumed for the period 2002-
2015 for these patients. Since 2016, SVR rates were assumed as 
98%. As for patients who presented a “compensated cirrhotic” 
or “decompensated cirrhotic” state, an SVR rate of 41.8% was 

Modeling hepatitis C in Romania 379
J Gastrointestin Liver Dis, September 2020 Vol. 29 No 3: 377-384
assumed for the period 2006-2016 [31]. For the following years, 
the SVR rate was around 98,07%, regardless of age group.
The SVR rate for patients in Tx2 was assumed as 98% for 
“non-cirrhotic”, 99.25% [28] for “compensated cirrhotic” and 
0% for “decompensated cirrhotic”, values that were considered 
to be constant for all the years in the period 2017-2030 
regardless of the age group.
People who inject drugs 
Until 1989 no data were found regarding the total number 
of PWIDs in Romania. However, during the referred period 
it was considered that there were 100 PWIDs each year, with 
a gender distribution of 74% for male individuals and 26% 
for females, according to the Romanian Anti-Drug Agency 
[32]. The demography of this population was calculated by 
using an indirect estimation, more specifically, a treatment 
multiplier [33] that was applied to the annual number of 
drug users admitted for treatment. For the period 1999-2007, 
the bibliographical source was a report by the Romanian 
Antidrug Agency [32, 34] and for the following years a report 
from the Romanian National Institute of Public Health was 
also considered. For this period, the population distribution 
was estimated by applying the PWIDs population gender 
distribution observed in 2008. In order to calculate the 
demography projection of this population, the PWIDs 
prevalence observed in 2017 was used for the period 2018-
2030. The annual number of male and female PWIDs was 
aligned according to estimates. As for background mortality, 
a constant standardized mortality ratio was considered for 
the PWIDs population [35]. The annual probability of death 
was estimated to be 6.3 and 16.7 times higher than the annual 
probability of death in the remnant population, for males and 
females respectively. 
The annual number of newly infected PWID was estimated 
by considering the same HCV incidence rate that was found in 
Turkey and Hungary. These studies were conducted between 
2013 and 2014, aiming to find the anti-HCV prevalence among 
PWIDs for less than two years [36].
HCV prevalence values for the period 2003-2017 were 
extracted from the National Antidrug Agency data [37]. 
Equal prevalence rates for both genders were assumed, with 
the exception of the period 2008-2012, in which the reported 
data were stratified by gender, with the same prevalence being 
applied to all age groups. For previous years to 2003, the 
prevalence was assumed to be the same as in that year, as well 
as to the years after 2017, in which prevalence values were also 
assumed to be the same as in that year.
The annual probability of diagnosis was assumed to be 0% 
before 1999. For the following years, the diagnosis rate was 
calculated by dividing the number of new PWIDs entering 
Opiate Substitution Therapy (OST) programs by the total 
number of estimated undiagnosed PWID. According to 
the National Antidrug Agency Report from 2017 [37], the 
probability of a PWIDs to be treated for HCV is very low, 
being a consequence of treatments only being available since 
the F2 Metavir.
The annual probability of an infected individual being 
retreated for HCV if already retained in care and previously 
treated is considered to be 0% for all the years, due to the fact 
that DAAs therapies were only available by the end of 2015 
and access to treatment was also difficult for the Remnant 
Population, according to data from the Romanian National 
Health Insurance House. 
Regarding the success rate of the patient’s first and second 
treatments, no data was found regarding the number of PWIDs 
that have benefited from HCV treatments.
Prisoners
No data were found regarding the number of prisoners 
population before 1990, as a result, the values of that year were 
assumed to be the same as the ones for the period 1950-1989. 
Values for the period 2018-2030 were assumed to be equal to 
the ones from 2017, due to no projection reports having been 
found. The National Prison Administration (NPA) provided 
data for the period 2007-2017, with the average age structure 
being applied to the remaining years. In order to align the 
data provided by the NPA with the available data from the 
Romanian National Institute of Statistics (NIS) and published 
data from international databases, it was decided that reports 
from the NIS should be used while applying the age structure 
provided by the NPA. No data regarding deaths in prisons were 
found, as a result, the same probabilities of death used for the 
remnant population were applied in this population. Also, no 
available data regarding the number of new chronic cases of 
hepatitis C were found. Therefore, the results found in a study 
from Larney et al. [8] were applied for the prisoners population 
HCV Incidence with the same increasing and decreasing rate 
as for HCV prevalence. The NPA provided data regarding the 
number of existing cases per age group, for 2017. Applying the 
same age structure, prevalence values for the remaining years 
were estimated by applying a slight increase/decrease rate. The 
number of patients within prison hospitals was used to estimate 
RIC values, considering the cases of HCV infection applied to 
the estimated number of diagnosed individuals. No data were 
found regarding the number of prisoners who benefit from 
HCV treatments, but due to the lack of funds it is unlikely that 
prisoners have been included in the access conditions.
Blood products population 
The blood products population consists of the total 
number of individuals that have received a blood transfusion 
at least once in their lifetime. No data were found regarding 
the frequency of piercing, tattoos or other circumstances. The 
demography of this population is based on data provided by 
the NIPH for the period 1990-2017, being represented as the 
total number of individuals, distributed by the age group. It 
was assumed that the population size for the years before 1990 
and after 2017 was the same as in the structure represented in 
the referred years. The number of individuals that entered this 
population, in each year, was considered by accessing data from 
the NIPH being based on hospital reports. Moreover, no official 
statistical data were found regarding new patients receiving 
blood products. Therefore, it was assumed that most cases 
occurred in hospitals. Entries in the blood product population 
considered patients that appeared in one year and did not 
appear in the year before that. Values for the background 
mortality were assumed to be the same as the ones used for 
the remnant population.

380 Lopes et al.
J Gastrointestin Liver Dis, September 2020 Vol. 29 No 3: 377-384
No data were found regarding HCV incidence in Romania’s 
blood products population. However, a study about HCV 
incidence in hemodialysis patients reported a rate of 2.6% 
[38, 39]. This value was as assumed as valid and applied to the 
new individuals entering this population, per year, regardless 
of gender and age groups. A decrease rate from 2006 per year, 
was assumed for the previous period until 1950 and for the 
period 2006-2018, given that HCV testing measures were 
implemented in blood products screening. 
Similarly, no data was found regarding HCV prevalence in 
Romania’s blood products population. It was assumed that after 
introducing HCV screening in blood products, individuals in 
this population had the same risk of infection as the ones in 
the remnant population [19], which was estimated according 
to a study [40] with blood donors in one county of Romania. In 
this study, HCV prevalence is reported as the proportion (%) of 
new blood donors (first-time blood donors) who are infected 
with HCV, for the period between 2006 and 2011 [40]. Since 
HCV was only discovered in 1989, HCV prevalence rates for 
the period 1990-2005, and the period 2012-2018 is considered 
to be the ones mentioned in the literature regarding the firsttime donators in Romania [41], applicable to both male and 
female, regardless of the age group.
In order to obtain RIC rates in Romania for the period 
between 1999 and 2018, the number of patients that received 
a blood transfusion at least once in their lifetime, within 
hospital facilities, were considered along with the application 
of infection rates to the estimated number of diagnosed 
individuals.
Having ever received a blood transfusion was not a criterion 
for inclusion or exclusion from treatment, but as no data was 
found on the background of patients regarding transfusion acts, 
the probability of treatments (Tx1 and Tx2) [28] and SVR were 
assumed to be the same as in the remnant population [29-31].
RESULTS
In Romania, model results for 2019 forecasted a total 
population of 20,382,443 individuals, with 284,395 being 
infected with HCV and an occurrence of 3,875 new cases. 
In 2019 forecasts showed that 164,659 individuals would be 
diagnosed, with 87,325 being linked to care, from which 41,705 
would be under treatment and 2,083 cured cases were expected. 
As for the different liver disease stages, model results for this 
year showed that there would be 49,130 cases of compensated 
cirrhosis, 4,587 decompensated cirrhosis and 2,582 cases of 
hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, 184 liver transplant 
cases were expected, as well as 2,608 liver-related deaths.
The LEHC model forecasted the HCV elimination year 
as being 2028, considering a total population of 19,406,784 
individuals in that year, from which 28,080 would be infected 
with HCV and 3,654 would be new cases. Considering the 
pool of HCV infected individuals, around 21,051 were 
predicted to be diagnosed and 16,351 being linked to care. 
In 2028, 6,686 individuals would be on treatment and 7,962 
individuals should be cured. Concerning the different 
liver disease stages, the model forecasted 43,749 cases of 
compensated cirrhosis, 1,474 cases of decompensated 
cirrhosis and 959 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to 
the burden of disease, 43 liver transplants would be expected 
to be conducted and it was estimated 1,114 cases of liverrelated deaths.
Nonetheless, if health policies remain unchanged 
until 2030, the model estimates that there will be further 
improvements on most epidemiological indicators that were 
considered in the LEHC project. 
According to the model, the estimates would be that HCV 
prevalence values would steeply decrease until 2026 and slightly 
decrease until 2030. Assuming the elimination line as 10% of 
the modeled HCV prevalence value in 2015, the WHO target 
would be achieved by 2028 (Fig. 1). The below-presented 
values considered the forecast of current policies in Romania 
remaining unchanged until 2030.
Modeled HCV prevalence values for the remnant 
population and vertical transmission would be expected to 
steeply drop until 2024-2025 and slightly decreasing until 2030 
(Fig. 2). As for the blood products population HCV prevalence 
would also be expected to steeply drop until 2024-2025 and 
continue decreasing until 2030 (Fig. 3). HCV prevalence for the 
prisoners, population would be expected to decrease until 2030 
but with no significant differences from year to year (Fig. 4). 
The forecast for the HCV prevalence evolution for the PWIDs 
population showed a gradual decrease until 2024, with minor 
differences from year to year until 2030 (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
Historically, research on hepatitis C progression has been 
conducted by using Markov chains over the natural history 
of the disease [42], published by Salomon et. al [1, 43], with

estimates on the disease progression, associated costs and the 
number of patients infected with HCV, by age and gender 
[44-46]. 
In May 2019 the National Framework Plan for viral 
hepatitis C control in Romania between 2019-2030 was 
formally released [47]. Specifically, this plan features different

targets to be achieved in order to eliminate HCV in the country 
by 2030 in the following dimensions: vaccination; coverage 
for pregnancy testing for hepatitis B and C; coverage of the 
first dose of hepatitis B vaccin; post-exposure prophylaxis in 
infants born to infected mothers; all blood donations should be 
PCR tested for HBV and HCV infection; the continuity of risk 
reduction programs for people using injectable drugs (harm 
reduction), opioid substitute treatment; people living with 
chronic infection with HBV, VHD and HCV to be diagnosed 
and informed about their disease; people to be screened for 
HBV and HCV infection; people positive and eligible for 
treatment to be enrolled in antiviral treatment programs. 
With all the aforementioned policies and measures in place, 
it is estimated that hepatitis C will be eradicated in Romania 
by 2030. 
The other estimations for hepatitis C elimination year in 
high-income countries provide data ranging between 2024 in 
Spain, 2025 in France and 2049 in The Netherlands and Ireland 
[48]. Romania was not included in this analysis. The modelling 
in these countries do not integrate the impact of public health 
policies focused on hepatitis C, thus it is not possible for direct 
comparison with data from the LEHC model. However, as soon 
as LEHC modelled results are available for the aforementioned 
countries, data will be published. 
The LEHC project results appoint for the HCV elimination 
goal to be achieved by 2028, according to data received by 
the 31st of December, 2018. These results consider the great 
efforts declared regarding the implemented public health 
policies focusing on hepatitis C, its integral fulfilment and 
uninterrupted application until 2030.
However, it must be noted that the Let’s End HepC 
epidemiological modeling tool integrates hepatitis C modeling 
with public health policies, in a unique solution. As there is no 
other estimating or modeling tool for hepatitis C that is able to 
integrate the effect of public health policies, it is not possible to 
establish a concurrent validity reading for Romania estimates. 
From a policy development perspective, the LEHC tool is a 
good measurement for calibration and the future will validate 
these predictions in the field. 
This tool enabled the forecast of each policies impact, 
of the twenty-four considered in the LEHC project, on the 
epidemiological dynamics of hepatitis C. Through quantitative 
analysis of the model results, it is now possible to test different 
applications of public health policies, anticipating possible 
results, supporting decision-making when applying them in 
a country’s reality. The LEHC tool also allows information to 
citizens regarding the hepatitis C epidemiological traits in 
relation to public health policies, thus fostering hepatitis C 
advocating. 
In the modelling process it is of the utmost importance to 
note that the rigor of any model will depend, first and foremost, 
on the quality of the underlying data, its analysis and field 
knowledge regarding the impact of public health policies in 
a given country.
CONCLUSIONS
According to the forecasted prevalence rates, if the current 
policies in Romania remain unchanged, the target of HCV 
infection elimination established by WHO is possible to be 
achieved by 2028.
In Romania, it was established that twelve of the twentyfour policies have already been implemented according to 
the highest degree of our scale. This reading conveys the idea 
that there is an equal ratio of public health policies that can 
be further implemented, having the potential to achieve the 
WHO elimination goal by 2026.
