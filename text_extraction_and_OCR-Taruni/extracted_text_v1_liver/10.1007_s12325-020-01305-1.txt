ABSTRACT
Introduction: Liver transplantation is recognised as a treatment option for patients with
propionic acidemia (PA) and those with
methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) without renal
impairment. In patients with MMA and moderate-to-severe renal impairment, combined
liver–kidney transplantation is indicated. However, clinical experience of these transplantation options in patients with PA and MMA
remains limited and fragmented. We undertook
an overview of post-transplantation outcomes
in patients with PA and MMA using the current
available evidence.
Methods: A literature search identified publications on the use of transplantation in patients
with PA and MMA. Publications were considered if they presented adequate demographic
and outcome data from patients with PA or
MMA. Publications that did not report any
specific outcomes for patients or provided
insufficient data were excluded.
Results: Seventy publications were identified of
which 38 were full papers. A total of 373
patients underwent liver/kidney/combined
liver–kidney transplantation for PA or MMA.
The most typical reason for transplantation was
recurrent metabolic decompensation. A total of
27 post-transplant deaths were reported in
patients with PA [14.0% (27/194)]. For patients
with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were
reported [11% (18/167)]. A total of 62 complications were reported in 115 patients with PA
(54%) with cardiomyopathy (n = 12), hepatic
arterial thrombosis (HAT; n = 14) and viral
infections (n = 12) being the most commonly
reported. A total of 52 complications were
reported in 106 patients with MMA (49%) with
viral infections (n = 14) and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) being the most commonly
reported.
Conclusions: Liver transplantation and combined liver–kidney transplantation appears to
benefit some patients with PA or MMA, respectively, but this approach does not provide
complete correction of the metabolic defect and
some patients remain at risk from disease-related and transplantation-related complications, including death. Thus, all treatment
avenues should be exhausted before consideration of organ transplantation and the benefits
of this approach must be weighed against the

Key Summary Points
A literature review was performed to
ascertain the outcomes associated with
liver and or kidney transplantation in
patients with propionic acidemia (PA) or
methylmalonic acidemia (MMA).
Thirty-eight papers and 32 abstracts were
identified, totalling 373 patients.
Transplantation improved outcome in
some patients with PA and MMA, but was
also associated with appreciable mortality
(14% PA, 11% MMA) and complications
including cardiomyopathy, hepatic
arterial thrombosis, renal failure/
impairment, and viral infections.
While transplantation appears to be of
some benefit in a subset of patients with
PA/MMA, this approach does not provide
a metabolic cure and patients remain at
risk from disease-related and
transplantation-related complications.
All treatment avenues should ideally be
exhausted for PA/MMA before selecting
transplantation.
INTRODUCTION
Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic
acidemia (MMA) are rare inborn errors of
metabolism presenting in infancy with episodes
of metabolic acidosis that can lead to early
mortality and significant morbidity [1–3]. Both
PA and MMA are characterised by the accumulation of propionic acid and/or methylmalonic
acid in plasma, urine, and other body fluids, due
to defects in the enzymes propionyl-CoA carboxylase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase,
respectively.
Patients with PA and/or MMA typically present shortly after birth with acute deterioration,
metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonaemia
leading to either severe intellectual disabilities
or death [1]. For these patients with ‘classical’
PA and MMA, dietary restriction (a low-protein,
high-energy diet) together with oral medication
(typically carnitine) has remained the core
therapy for decades. However, despite intensive
medical efforts, frequent episodes of metabolic
decompensation occur with inevitable complications [1].
Solid-organ transplantation, such as single
liver or kidney transplantation, or combined
liver–kidney transplantation, has become an
effective alternative treatment for metabolic
disease in recent decades [1]. The role of liver,
kidney, or combined liver–kidney transplantation in patients with PA/MMA is currently
evolving and, while not considered ‘curative’, is
typically undertaken as an ‘enzyme replacement therapy’ [4]. However, any decision to
carry out a transplantation is a complicated one
which requires a comprehensive understanding
of the underlying disease, the risks and benefits
of transplantation, and current therapeutic
alternatives [5]. Furthermore, clinical experience of transplantation in PA and MMA remains
both limited and fragmented due to the low
prevalence of these diseases [4, 6].
The purpose of this review is to provide an
overview of post-transplantation outcomes in
patients with PA and MMA.
METHODS
A literature search was undertaken on 10 April
2019 to identify suitable papers for inclusion in
the present review. The literature search tools
used were PubMed, Embase and Biosys. The
search string was [(propionic OR methylmalonic) AND acidemia*] AND [(transplant OR
transplantation) AND aciduria*]. No date limitations were applied. Suitable references for
inclusion included abstracts and full papers,
clinical studies, case studies, and retrospective
Adv Ther (2020) 37:1866–1896 1867

analyses of patients with PA and/or MMA. Any
references which included patients with PA or
MMA as part of a pooled population of patients
with inherited metabolic disorders but did not
report any specific outcomes for these patients
were excluded, as were abstracts providing
insufficient data. Given the methodology used,
this review was undertaken to assess any trends
arising from the use of liver/kidney/combined
liver–kidney transplantation in patients with
PA/MMA.
This article is based on previously conducted
studies and does not contain any studies with
human participants or animals performed by
any of the authors.
RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Follow-up
Seventy suitable references (retrospective analyses and case studies) were identified, 32 of
which were meeting abstracts. A summary of
transplantation type and median patient age
taken from these references is shown in Table 1.
A total of 195 and 167 patients underwent liver/
kidney/combined liver–kidney transplantation
for PA and MMA, respectively (a total of 373
transplantations). In addition, a total of nine
and two retransplantations were required in
patients with PA and MMA, respectively. Single
organ liver transplantation was performed more
commonly in both PA and MMA (total n = 307,
PA n = 193; MMA n = 114), when compared
with kidney (PA n = 2; MMA n = 21) or combined liver–kidney transplantation (PA n = 0;
MMA n = 32) (retransplantations not included).
Median age at transplantation ranged from 0.25
to 42 years in patients with PA and from 0.4 to
28.0 years in patients with MMA. The most
typical reason for any type of transplantation in
patients with PA and MMA was recurrent
metabolic decompensation. Follow-up data to
show outcomes by type of transplantation were
available for all PA (n = 195; available follow-up
range 0–22 years) and MMA (n = 167; range
0.04–16 years) patients, although specific timings of follow-up were not always provided.
Of the 70 references identified, 38 were full
papers which contained sufficient patient
information, both pre-operatively and posttransplantation, along with a suitable follow-up
duration to enable a more detailed overview. A
summary of key findings from these references
is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Available data from
the identified abstracts were limited and are
summarised in the ‘‘Appendix’’.

Mortality
A total of 27 post-transplant deaths were
reported in patients with PA, which equated to
a mortality rate of 14.0% (27/194). For patients
with MMA, 18 post-transplant deaths were
reported, which equated to a mortality rate of
11% (18/167). Causes of death for PA and MMA
are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
PA
A retrospective analysis of 12 patients with PA
who underwent liver transplantation reported
that while the graft survival rate was 60% at
5 years, seven of the 12 patients (58%) died
within the first year after transplantation (multi-organ failure, n = 4; hepatic failure, n = 3)
[10]. Infection is reported as a major cause of
post-transplant deaths in patients with PA:
Kasahara et al. [13] reported that liver transplantation in nine patients with PA resulted in
four sepsis-related deaths, equating to a mortality rate of 44%. However, some studies suggest that transplantation appears to be less of a
risk in some patients with PA. For example, a
recent retrospective analysis of liver transplantation by Shanmugam et al. [24] reported survival in patients with PA to be 100% at a median
follow-up of 32 months. It appears that survival
following transplantation in patients with PA
seems to be improving with greater experience
of the procedure. Indeed, the expertise and
experience of the surgical team is an important
prognostic factor for general paediatric liver
transplantation [43–46].
MMA
Patient mortality following transplantation was
less frequently reported in patients with MMA
compared with patients with PA, with most
studies reporting 100% patient survival. However, three studies identified a post-transplantation mortality risk in patients with MMA. For
kidney transplantation, Brassier et al. [27]
reported four patients with MMA [median
transplantation age 7.9 years (range 5–
10.2 years)] who received a kidney graft following repeated metabolic decompensations,
with progression to chronic kidney disease
(CKD) in three of these patients (end-stage
kidney disease in two patients and CKD stage III
in one patient; normal renal function in one
patient) prior to transplantation. One patient
developed a hepatoblastoma at the age of 11
(less than 2 years post-surgery), followed by
neurological complications and death. The
three other patients remained alive, with two
achieving neurological stability. Morioka et al.
[17] reported on two patients with MMA who
both died after receiving a liver transplantation,
equating to a 100% mortality rate; these deaths
were caused by metabolic stroke and
aspergillosis. One death caused by a metabolic
crisis was identified in a patient with MMA
following combined liver–kidney transplantation [47].
Complications
A total of 62 complications (various types) were
reported in 115 patients with PA. This equates
to an approximate complication rate of 54%
given that some patients experienced more
than one complication. Cardiomyopathy
(n = 12), hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT;
n = 14) and viral infections (n = 12) were most
commonly reported complications among
patients with PA. A total of 52 complications
were reported in 106 patients with MMA. This
equates to an approximate complication rate of
49% given that some patients experienced more
than one complication. Viral infections (n = 14)
and renal failure/impairment (n = 10) were
most commonly reported complications among
patients with MMA. Of note, the definition of
what constituted a ‘complication’ varied widely
between publications. Post-transplant complications for patients with PA and MMA are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
PA
Complications related to the transplant procedure along with subsequent post-surgery infection appeared to be most commonly reported in
1878 Adv Ther (2020) 37:1866–1896

patients with PA (Table 2). A retrospective study
reported that out of 17 liver transplantation
procedures in 12 patients with PA, HAT was
reported in a total of six transplants (equating
to a 35% risk of HAT), and occurred in successive grafts in two patients [10]. Similarly, Critelli
et al. [11] reported that two of three patients
with PA who received a liver transplant developed a recurrent left HAT (equating to a 66%
chance of HAT), one that required Fogarty
catheter thrombectomy and one that did not
resolve despite placement of an aortic conduit
graft, resulting in an associated hepatic allograft
infarction. The same study noted that one
patient developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, while a similar retrospective review of
children with PA noted that two of three
patients developed CMV infection following
liver transplantation [12]; all episodes of CMV
infection were successfully treated with intravenously administered ganciclovir.
MMA
Post-transplantation complications varied
amongst patients with MMA, although most
studies reported at least one complication
(Table 3). Complications following combined
liver/kidney transplantation included renal
artery thrombosis (Duclaux-Loras et al. [30])
and cerebellar stroke [35]. For liver transplantation, complications such as infection (sepsis,
CMV and Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) [36] and
HAT [11, 38] were reported. Complications following kidney transplantation included hepatoblastoma [27] and chronic allograft
nephropathy [33].
Post-transplant Metabolic Episodes
PA
In the literature available for patients with PA,
reports of metabolic episodes ranged from 0% to
100% following liver transplantation (Table 2).
A retrospective analysis of 12 patients with PA
reported no further episodes of acute metabolic
decompensation following liver transplantation
even with a less restricted dietary protein intake
[10]. Similarly, Shanmugam et al. [24] reported
that of five children with PA and a median of
eight episodes of decompensation per year prior
to transplantation, no episodes of metabolic
decompensation occurred either intraoperatively or immediately after transplantation
when receiving a protein-unrestricted diet. In
contrast, Kasahara et al. [13] reported that following liver transplantation in Japanese
patients with PA/MMA, recurrent metabolic
decompensation was observed in 100% of
patients despite the administration of protein
restriction with medications (cobalamin, carnitine supplementation, and antibiotics to
eradicate gut flora). Thus, post-transplant medication for the original liver disease had to be
continued in all patients.
MMA
In the literature available for patients with
MMA, episodes of metabolic decompensation
varied by transplantation type (Table 3). For
patients with MMA, the risk of further episodes
of metabolic decompensation appeared to be
higher following liver transplantation compared with kidney or combined kidney/liver
transplantation. Kasahara et al. [13] reported
recurrent metabolic decompensation in 100%
of patients with MMA following liver transplantation despite the administration of protein
restriction with medications, leading to the
continuation of pre-surgery medication. Sakamoto et al. [40] reported that while the number
of acidosis attacks significantly decreased following liver transplantation in Japanese
patients with MMA, this was not deemed to be a
‘curative’ approach as most patients remained
on a protein-restricted diet. Morioka et al.
reported episodes of metabolic stroke [17] and
metabolic episodes [36] following liver transplantation. In contrast, Niemi et al. [38] reported no further episodes of metabolic
decompensation following liver transplantation
in patients with MMA. patients with MMA who
received kidney transplantation or combined
liver/kidney transplantation typically reported
no further metabolic decompensations.
McGuire et al. [35] reported the case study of a
Adv Ther (2020) 37:1866–1896 1879

patient who received a combined liver/kidney
transplant at 5 years, with subsequent metabolic decompensation at 10 months post-surgery; however, no further episodes of metabolic
decompensation were reported.
Can Transplantation Reverse
Cardiomyopathy in Patients with PA?
Overall, liver transplantation was shown to
effectively reverse baseline cardiomyopathy in
approximately 50% of patients at post-transplant follow-up. Romano et al. [22] reported
that of patients with PA who survived their first
year of life, a dilated cardiomyopathy developed
in six patients at a median age of 7 years (range
5–11 years), although this was reversed in two
patients within 1 year following liver transplantation. Charbit-Henrion et al. [10] similarly
reported reversal of cardiomyopathy in three
patients with PA following liver transplantation, although three patients with normal heart
ultrasound prior to transplantation subsequently developed unexpected heart failure and
died at 1–4 weeks following surgery. Of note,
transplantation is typically contraindicated in
patients with severe heart disease.
DISCUSSION
This review has shown that liver, kidney, or
combined liver–kidney transplantation can significantly improve metabolic outcomes for
patients with PA or MMA. However, data from
retrospective and case studies suggest that this
approach cannot be considered to be a cure, and
all three types of transplantation are associated
with significant risks of subsequent complications or death.
A number of factors influence the choice of
therapy (liver or kidney transplant alone or
combined liver–kidney transplantation) in
patients with PA or MMA. In general, liver
transplantation is deemed to be a suitable treatment option for patients with PA and those
patients with MMA but without renal impairment. In contrast, combined liver–kidney
transplantation is considered more suitable in
those patients with MMA and renal impairment. In addition, it is important to recognise
the indications and contraindications for the
use of transplantation in PA/MMA. Traditionally, transplants have been reserved for the most
‘brittle’ patient, in whom it is difficult to
achieve reasonable metabolic control or that
their dietary restriction is very severe and still
not achieving metabolic control. More recently,
there has been a tendency to transplant at an
earlier stage, regardless of the level of metabolic
control. One reason behind this approach is the
increased availability of transplant units. However, to support the optimal outcome of
patients with PA/MMA, it is important that
these transplant units have relevant and suitable experience in transplanting patients with
metabolic disorders rather than patients with
organ failure alone.
The use of transplantation in patients with
PA/MMA typically occurs at a young age,
although transplantation at adult age has been
reported when other management approaches
have proven to be unsuccessful. Frequent
metabolic decompensations tend to be the most
common indication for transplantation in PA/
MMA, although other reasons include suboptimal metabolic outcomes despite medical therapy, elective transplantation in view of the
natural history of the disease, and the prevention of ongoing long-term complications of the
disease. Current Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines for the management of PA and MMA recommend that liver
and/or kidney transplantation should be considered in patients with frequent metabolic
decompensations where the clinical condition
is difficult to stabilise with dietary/pharmacological treatment [1]. A catabolic state or active
metabolic decompensation would be a potential
contraindication to transplantation; thus clinicians need to carefully consider related risks and
benefits prior to surgery.
The success of transplantation in PA/MMA
remains varied, with substantial rates of associated complications and deaths being reported.
While the risk of episodes of metabolic decom1880 Adv Ther (2020) 37:1866–1896

pensation are reduced, a proportion of transplanted patients continue to have episodes
(approx. 15%). Martinelli et al. [48] note that
while transplanted organs (liver and/or kidney)
are an enzyme source, they only partially correct the biochemical defect. However, the small
amount of enzyme activity gained by kidney
transplantation appears sufficient to improve
the metabolic balance in patients with MMA
[1]. This could explain why metabolic acidosis
was more commonly reported after liver transplantation compared with kidney or combined
liver–kidney transplantation. In addition, the
risk of subsequent episodes of metabolic acidosis following transplantation may be higher in
those patients offered a less restricted dietary
protein intake, in contrast with those who
remain on a protein-restricted diet and/or
receive appropriate pharmacotherapy to support metabolic stabilisation.
As transplantation is not curative in PA/
MMA, it is important to recognise that any
improvement in metabolic control has to be
balanced with the possibility of complications
during surgery and following transplant, along
with the need for prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. A number of factors may influence
the occurrence of post-operative mortality and/
or complications. For example, high-level
expertise of the transplant team and transplant
centre has the potential to reduce post-operative mortality and an experienced team would
also recognise that patients with PA/MMA
undergoing transplantation would need careful
and prolonged management following surgery.
As such, the transplant team should aim to
work closely with the metabolic team to support the optimal peri- and post-operative management of the patient’s primary metabolic
disorder, be it PA or MMA. The use of
immunosuppressive therapy, along with the
management of any associated tolerability
issues, also remains important following transplantation. Extra-hepatic risks remain following
surgery in patients with PA and MMA, with
transplantation simply aiming to provide a
milder and more manageable phenotype of the
disease. Patients will therefore be required to
remain on a protein-restricted diet, albeit a less
stringent one. Of note, patients with PA or
MMA should avoid prolonged fasting and dextrose infusions following transplantation in
order to promote anabolism and prevent metabolic decompensation perioperatively. In addition, regular renal surveillance is also advised
post-transplant in the long term.
Preoperative conditions associated with PA
and MMA, such as intellectual disability, preexisting neurological impairment, and cardiomyopathy, may influence the lifespan of a
patient following transplantation. However, the
optimal management of metabolic status both
perioperatively and following transplantation
would serve to minimise any further deterioration of these preoperative conditions. In addition, existing cardiac complications in patients
with PA have the potential to improve following liver transplantation. It should be noted
that liver and/or kidney transplantation does
not reverse any neurologic injury that has
accumulated prior to surgery. Of note, SIGN
guidelines suggest that transplantation should
ideally occur prior to any severe neurological
deterioration and under stable metabolic conditions [1]. Thus, residual neurologic injury
remains a persistent disease complication suggesting that postponing a transplant to a later
stage may lead to additional neurologic insults
and possibly inferior neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, post-transplant neurological
deterioration in organic acidurias has also been
reported (e.g. [39, 49]. De novo MMA production in the central nervous system may contribute to neurological dysfunction given that
organ transplantation does not affect the concentration of MMA in the cerebrospinal fluid
[48].
Worsening renal function was reported in
some patients with PA following liver transplantation, although combined liver–kidney
transplantation appeared more likely to result
in stable renal function. In addition, significant
recovery of cardiac function/reversal of severe
cardiomyopathy was reported in some patients
Adv Ther (2020) 37:1866–1896 1881

with PA following transplantation, although
heart failure was reported as the cause of death
in other patients. Thus, cardiac and renal
function should be assessed before transplantation and monitored closely afterward, with
consideration given to the use of renal-sparing
immunosuppression following surgery.
This review identified that the transplantation process itself was associated with several
surgical complications, with liver transplantation associated with a higher level of mortality
compared with kidney and combined
liver–kidney transplantation. HAT remains a
serious life-threatening complication in liver
transplantation as noted in our findings. The
overall incidence of HAT following liver transplantation varies from 2% to 9% and represents
one of the main causes of graft loss and transplant recipient mortality [50]. The mechanism
of HAT development is not fully understood,
although young donor age and small liver graft
are reported as risk factors in paediatric
deceased-liver transplantation [51]. Infection,
particularly CMV and EBV viremia, was also
commonly reported, particularly in liver transplantation patients. Infection was a predominant cause of post-transplantation death,
particularly in patients with MMA, and graft
rejection/dysfunction leading to death was also
reported. The most common reason reported for
retransplantation in both patients with PA and
MMA was HAT. Other complications which
limited post-transplantation survival included
cardiac failure and metabolic stroke. Of note,
children with organic acidemias appear to be at
higher risk of complications from transplantation than other metabolic disorders [52].
When considering the type of liver transplantation, SIGN guidelines recommended OLT,
as this appears to be associated with fewer
complications compared with auxiliary liver
transplantation [1, 36]. However, any benefits of
transplantation must always be weighed against
the risks associated with organ transplantation
along with the need for long-term immunosuppression [1, 36]. Toxicity associated with the
use of post-transplantation immunosuppressive
agents does occur, e.g. cyclosporine A and
tacrolimus-induced leukoencephalopathy is a
significant complication which may occur at
therapeutic levels [53].
The findings from the current narrative
review are in line with preliminary findings
from a recent systematic review of the use of
transplantation in patients with PA and MMA.
This also demonstrated that while liver and/or
kidney transplantation can improve patient
outcome, the potential for increased mortality
risk and a high risk of complications also need
to be considered [54].
This review has a number of limitations.
The search strategy used for this review identified 70 suitable references comprising both
abstracts and full papers, although the available level of patient information, assessed
clinical parameters, and clinical outcomes varied between them. All references were crosschecked to avoid any possible duplication of
data between abstracts and full papers,
although this was limited by the lack of patient
information and clinical data provided in some
of the abstracts meaning that the total number
of transplants performed was actually lower
than that reported. A number of these references were pooled studies of metabolic disease
wherein only a few patients had PA or MMA.
In addition, duration of follow-up varied substantially between studies, with some studies
not providing timings of follow-up or complications, and some clinical outcomes of baseline
parameters were not reported. For deaths related to transplantation, some references, particularly abstracts, failed to provide full details
of the cause of these deaths, which was typically compounded by a lack of specific patient
information. Likewise, for complications of
transplantation surgery, some studies specifically defined and assessed complications, while
others failed to do so, or failed to provide
specific patient details, leaving the reader to
subjectively interpret any issues related to the
transplantation procedure. For this reason, the
overall data included in this review should
simply be used as a guide to the current issues
related to transplantation in patients with PA
and MMA.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, while the use of liver transplantation and combined liver–kidney transplantation appears to benefit some patients with PA or
MMA, respectively, this approach does not
provide a metabolic cure and patients remain at
risk from disease-related and transplantationrelated complications. Any transplantation
procedure also has an associated mortality risk.
Thus, all treatment avenues should ideally be
exhausted for PA/MMA before selecting transplantation. If liver and/or kidney transplantation remains a viable option, the benefits of this
approach must be individually and meticulously weighed against the risk of perioperative
complications, including renal and neurological
progressive impairment in the post-transplant
period.
