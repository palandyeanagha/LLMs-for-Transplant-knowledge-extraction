ABSTRACT
Heart transplantation (HTx) has become standard treatment for selected patients with endstage heart failure. Improvements in immunosuppressant, donor procurement, surgical 
techniques, and post-HTx care have resulted in a substantial decrease in acute allograft 
rejection, which had previously significantly limited survival of HTx recipients. However, 
limitations to long-term allograft survival exist, including rejection, infection, coronary 
allograft vasculopathy, and malignancy. Careful balance of immunosuppressive therapy 
and vigilant surveillance for complications can further improve long-term outcomes of HTx 
recipients.

HISTORY OF HEART TRANSPLANTATION
Overall history of heart transplantation
The first human heart transplantation (HTx) was performed by Christian Barnard from 
South Africa in December 1967.1) Right after the event, the first HTx in the United States 
(US) was performed by Dr. Shumway and colleagues at Stanford University in January 1968. 
However, initial outcomes of HTx were poor because of the complex postoperative problems, 
such as graft rejection and infection. As a result, the total number of HTx cases dropped 
after the initial surgeries. The introduction of cyclosporine-based immunosuppression in 
1980 brought an improvement in survival rates2) and HTx subsequently became a standard 
treatment for end-stage heart failure (HF). Currently, the number of HTx performed 
worldwide is estimated to be nearly 5,500 procedures annually.3)
History of heart transplantation in Asia and Korea
The first HTx in Asia was performed in 1968 by Dr. Juro Wada at Sapporo Medical University 
in Japan.4) Similar to the experience in the US, the initial surgeries yielded poor outcomes 
until the introduction of cyclosporine in 1980. Cultural taboos regarding organ donation 
along with incomplete legislation regarding brain death delayed the widespread performance 
of HTx in Asia. Eventually, HTx began to be performed again on the Asian continent in 
Taiwan5) and Thailand in 19876), in Korea7)8) and Hong Kong in 19929), and in Japan in 1999.10)
Currently, most number of HTxs performed in Asia are done in Taiwan and Korea. In

CURRENT STATUS OF HEART TRANSPLANTATION
The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry
The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) and International 
Thoracic Transplant Registry reported a continued increase in the annual number of HTxs 
performed worldwide over the last decade (Figure 1).3) After the initial increase in cases during 
the 1980s and early 1990s, the numbers of HTxs stabilized because of a limited number of 
donors. Therefore, the number of candidates on waiting lists exceeds that of available donor 
organs. In the absence of a reliable prognostic score for stage D HF along with the evolution 
of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) options, it has been difficult to design an organ 
allocation system that would reliably prioritize transplantation among patients in need of HTx. 
Continued efforts are underway to develop ideal allocation systems.13)14)
Current challenges of HTx can be characterized by the following parameters: 1) older age 
of both recipients and donors; 2) increased number of HTx performed with MCS; 3) the 
growing use of combined organ transplants (comprising more than 4% of the total number 
of HTx); and 4) a high proportion of sensitized candidates.3)15) The complex HTx candidates 
are at higher risk of poor outcomes, including primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and antibodymediated rejection (AMR).3)16)17) To minimize this risk, the following strategies should be 
considered: 1) proposing changes in the current HTx allocation policy to provide a more

candidates.21)22) Developments in these areas could result in a more equitable distribution 
of organs, expansion of the donor pool, and improved quality of life and survival for heart 
transplant recipients (Figure 2).
The Korean Organ Transplant Registry data
After the first HTx in 1992, the annual number of surgeries performed in Korea has been 
increasing. The number has increased to more than 50 cases between 2000 and 2007 and 
reached to 184 cases in 2017 (Figure 3). Recently, Lee et al.23) reported data from the Korean 
Organ Transplant Registry (KOTRY) on HTx surgery. This registry was established by the 
Korean Society for Transplantation and the Korean Center for Disease Control in 2013. Data 
from a total of 183 HTxs were collected from 4 nationally representative hospitals from April 
2014 to December 2015.

The characteristics of the current state of HTx in Korea compared with ISHLT and the Japan 
HTx registry were described recently (Table 1). In Korea, HTx data for patients with long-term 
durable MCS were unavailable because of the current reimbursement system. In contrast, 
HTx with concurrent inotropic support is the most common strategy in Korea. The 1-year 
survival rate in Korea (91.6%) was higher than that reported in the ISHLT registry (85.0%).24)
RECIPIENT SELECTION AND MANAGEMENT
General principles (listing criteria)
End-stage HF patients who are truly refractory to maximal medical therapy and who could 
be benefitted by HTx surgery must be listed. The commonly accepted indications for HTx are 
presented in Table 2. Generally, the 3 major indications for HTx are severe functional limitations, 
refractory angina, and ventricular arrhythmias refractory to maximal medical therapy.25)
Optimization of medical therapy is a crucial factor for determining whether a patient would 
benefit from HTx. Patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (EF) should be prescribed the 
following medications, when feasible, to improve symptoms and survival: angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin 
inhibitor, β-receptor antagonist, sinoatrial node modulator (ivabradine), and mineralocorticoid 
antagonists.8)26-29) In addition to optimal medical therapy, cardiac implantable electronic devices 
including cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without implantable defibrillators should be

considered to increase survival.30-33) For patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), surgical 
revascularization may be indicated to improve long-term survival.32)
HTx evaluation aims to determine whether patients meet the following conditions: 1) “sick 
enough,” such that their his/her cardiac status is sufficiently limited on optimal medical 
therapy in order to benefit from HTx; 2) are patients “well enough,” such that they do not 
have comorbidities that would preclude HTx; and 3) “can adapt to new transplant lifestyle,” 
such that the patient demonstrates compliance with therapy and possesses adequate social 
support. Although these indications are generally well accepted, it is challenging to list 
optimal patients who can benefit from HTx (Figure 4).
Contraindications
Contraindications for HTx should be considered prior to listing patients to provide the best 
chance for achieving an optimal outcome (Table 3). Many of these factors are not absolute 
and must be considered in the context of the severity of the patient's heart disease and

Table 3. Contraindications to HTx34)
Age Over 70 is a relative contraindication depending on associated comorbidities
Obesity BMI <30 kg/m2 is recommended; most centers will tolerate BMI <35 kg/m2*
Malignancy Active neoplasm, except nonmelanoma skin cancer, is an absolute contraindication; cancers that are low grade or in remission may be 
acceptable in consultation with an oncologist
Pulmonary 
hypertension
The inability to achieve PVR <2.5 wood units with vasodilator or inotropic therapy is a contraindication; such patients may benefit from 
unloading with a VAD
Diabetes Uncontrolled diabetes or that associated with significant end-organ damage is an absolute contraindication
Renal dysfunction If caused by diabetes, may be an absolute contraindication (unless combined heart-kidney transplantation is considered)
Cirrhosis May be secondary to cardiac disease and is an absolute contraindication in most centers (unless combined heart/liver transplant is considered)
Peripheral vascular 
disease
Severe disease not amenable to revascularization is an absolute contraindication, especially if associated with ischemic ulcers
Infection HIV and hepatitis C are absolute contraindications at most centers; with novel hepatitis C therapy, some centers may consider such patients
Substance use 6 months of abstinence from smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs are required; in critically ill patients, consultation with psychiatry and social 
work is essential
Psychosocial issues Noncompliance, lack of caregiver support (either by family or agencies), and dementia are absolute contraindications; mental retardation may 
be a relative contraindication

associated comorbidities. The degree to which they are interpreted and applied may vary 
considerably among transplant programs.
Korean situation
Although similar listing criteria and contraindications are also widely accepted in Korea, 
patients on waiting lists seem rather different because of the difference in medical situations 
and the reimbursement system. According to the recent KOTRY report, 93% of HTx was 
performed with concomitant inotropic support; this value is much higher than that reported 
in ISHLT (40%) and Japanese (5%) data. Notably, a relatively high proportion of patients 
undergo HTx surgery with the concomitant use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenator 
(ECMO) in Korea (19%) than that reported in ISHLT data (only 1%) (Table 1).24) Recently, 
Korean Network for Organ Sharing status codes for medical urgency were modified to a 
version similar to that of the United Network for Organ Sharing strategies, which put higher 
priority on durable ventricular assist device (VAD)-related problems (Table 4).

course. Basic laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, ABO 
blood typing, and viral serologies (hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 
human T-cell leukemia virus, Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], and cytomegalovirus [CMV]), 
are ordered. Additional studies include chest X-ray, 12-lead electrocardiography, and 
echocardiography.
Brain-dead individuals must meet certain minimum criteria to be considered an HTx 
donor (Table 5). Most cardiac donors are younger than 55 years, although older donors 
may be selectively considered in critically ill or older recipients. An initial echocardiogram 
is obtained to identify significant structural heart disease, such as left ventricular (LV) 
hypertrophy or dysfunction, occlusive coronary artery disease, valvular dysfunction, 
and congenital lesions. Generally, echocardiographically normal hearts are considered; 
however, selected marginal organs may be allocated to higher risk recipients. Angiography is 
performed in several countries to exclude significant coronary artery disease in male donors 
older than 45 years and female donors older than 50 years; however, it may also be performed 
in younger patients with multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease. Patients with active 
malignancy (excluding nonmelanocytic skin cancers and certain isolated brain tumors) or 
severe systemic infections are typically excluded. HIV and hepatitis B and C infections would 
preclude organ donation. However, hepatitis B donors might be carefully allocated in antiHBs Ab (+) recipients with perioperative hepatitis B immunoglobulin (Ig) prophylaxis,35)36)
hepatitis C-positive donors could be considered with the advent of new nucleotide 
polymerase inhibitors that offer a potential for cure.37)
Expanding the donor pool (extended criteria donor)
Currently, fewer than 50% of potential organ donors in the US become actual donors and 
efforts have been undertaken to place to increase the usage rate.38)39) Transplantation centers 
now use extended criteria donor (ECD) hearts with acceptable outcomes, which matches 
higher risk recipients with higher risk donors. The criteria for higher risk recipients are as 
follows: age >65 years, renal insufficiency, peripheral arterial disease, or poorly controlled 
diabetes. Considerable evidence shows that ECD hearts that may result in favorable post-HTx

survival continue to be discarded. A retrospective review of 1,872 potential organ donors in 
California from 2001 to 2008 showed predictors of non-usage to be as follows: age >50 years, 
female sex, death attributable to cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
a positive troponin assay result, LV dysfunction (LVEF of <50%), regional wall motion 
abnormalities, and LV hypertrophy. These characteristics of ECD hearts, however, seemed to 
have little effect on recipient outcomes they were transplanted.40) Other ongoing efforts to 
expand the donor pool include an increase in identification of donors, increase in the consent 
rate, expansion of donor selection criteria, maximization of donor organ function, and use 
of mechanical support devices as an adjunctive approach to organ donation. Overcoming 
cultural issues should be considered to expand the donor pool in Asian countries as well.12)
Donation after circulatory death and the organ care system
Recently, the concept of donation after circulatory death (DCD) has been successfully utilized 
for HTx in line with an effort to expand the donor pool.41) In DCD, retrieval of organs for the 
purpose of transplantation occurs from patients whose death is diagnosed and confirmed 
using cardiorespiratory criteria. Asystole must be confirmed for at least 5 minutes to declare 
death, but this standoff time varies in different countries. To minimize ischemic injury for 
DCD organs, efforts are drawn to limit cold ischemic time through the use of an ex vivo 
heart perfusion platform that maintains the donor heart in a warm, beating state prior 
to transplantation. In a trial to assess the safety of ex vivo perfusions, 130 patients were 
randomized to receive donor hearts preserved with either the ex vivo perfusion or standard cold 
storage. There was no difference in 30-day patient and graft survival rates or serious adverse 
events.42) An ongoing phase III clinical trial, the International Trial to Evaluate the Safety and 
Effectiveness of the Portable Organ Care System (OCS™, TransMedics, Andover, MA, USA) 
Heart for Preserving and Assessing Expanded Criteria Donor Hearts for Transplantation 
(EXPAND trial; NCT02323321), will offer further insight into the utility of this platform.
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AFTER HEART 
TRANSPLANTATION
Physiology of the transplanted heart
Surgical excision of the heart from the donor results in immediate denervation of both 
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous fibers (Figure 5). Cardiac denervation after HTx 
is clinically important because it explains why recipients are unable to experience angina due 
to ischemia, but may have bradycardia and hypotension related to inferior wall infarction 
post-HTx.34)43)44) Cardiac denervation is also responsible for diminished exercise capacity early 
post-HTx, and is related to a slower increase in heart rate during exercise because the heart 
relies on non-cardiac circulating catecholamines. Cardiac denervation also explains loss of the 
nocturnal decline in blood pressure, and the higher resting heart rate early post-HTx. Because 
cardiac denervation depletes the catecholamine stores in the cardiac muscle, HTx recipients 
may experience more arrhythmias because of dependence on circulating catecholamines. 
This can also cause an abnormal response to adrenergic agonist or antagonist medications. 
To compensate for chronotropic incompetence, the denervated heart must increase its stroke 
volume to increase cardiac output, even during mild exercise. Heart transplant recipients have a 
much lower peak VO2 compared with age-adjusted, non-transplant cardiac patients. Peripheral 
factors, such as damage to the pulmonary capillary bed, play significant roles in reducing the 
exercise tolerance of transplant patients. Exercise training improves the exercise capacity of 
heart transplant recipients by improving peripheral factors and the chronotropic response. 
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 572
The Past, Present and Future of HTx

Beta blockers markedly reduce the exercise tolerance of heart transplant recipients and should 
be avoided where possible. Atropine and digoxin have no effect on the denervated heart and 
should not be used to treat arrhythmias in heart transplant patients.34)43)44)
Immediate postoperative management after heart transplantation
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography to assess systolic function is typically 
recommended. Invasive monitoring of arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary 
artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, and oxygen saturation 
should also be performed immediately following transplantation. Continuous inotropic 
infusions of isoproterenol, dobutamine, dopamine, and/or milrinone are warranted to avoid 
early ventricular dysfunction. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and epinephrine) 
may also be used to treat persistent systemic hypotension. MCS including intra-aortic balloon 
pumps (IABPs) or temporary assist devices should be considered if there is a failure to wean 
from cardiopulmonary bypass or if there is persistent hemodynamic instability despite 
multiple high-dose inotrope administrations. ECMO is an option in severe graft dysfunction 
with cardiogenic shock that is unresponsive to pharmacological treatment. Causes of 
early hemodynamic instability include hyperacute rejection, cardiac tamponade, PGD, 
and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (causing right ventricular [RV] dysfunction). 
RV dysfunction may be treated with pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide, 
sildenafil, and prostacyclin analogues, to lower pulmonary vascular resistance. Sinus node 
dysfunction is common post-transplant, resulting in post-transplantation bradycardia that 
may be treated with chronotropic agents or temporary pacing. Rarely, permanent pacing may 
be required. Tachyarrhythmias would need prompt investigation for rejection and may be 
treated with rate-controlling agents, such as diltiazem or amiodarone. Digoxin is not effective 
for the rate control of atrial fibrillation in the denervated heart as it requires an intact vagus 
nerve to lower the heart rate. Renal dysfunction is common in the first 24–48 hours posttransplant. Therefore, continuous assessment of urine output in the early postoperative 
period is crucial. Immunosuppression and anti-microbial prophylaxis should be initiated

perioperatively. Early ambulation and physical therapy is important, and subsequent cardiac 
rehabilitation has been demonstrated to be beneficial.34)43)
Primary graft dysfunction
Early allograft dysfunction can be apparent in the intraoperative period or can develop within 
24 hours of transplantation. It can manifest as LV dysfunction, isolated RV dysfunction, or 
biventricular dysfunction, and is associated with significantly increased 30-day and 1-year 
mortality.20) Early graft dysfunction is classified as primary or secondary graft dysfunction 
according to the suspected etiology. Secondary graft dysfunction can occur as a result of 
recipient and procedural factors. The causes include hyperacute rejection and excessive 
volume or pressure load on the right ventricle. Unrecognized pulmonary hypertension in 
the recipient can result in RV failure immediately after allograft implantation. Extensive 
intraoperative bleeding can result in massive blood product transfusion requirements and 
can result in RV volume overload and dysfunction.
PGD is currently defined as LV, RV, or biventricular dysfunction that occurs within 24 hours 
after surgery and is not associated with a discernible cause, such as hyperacute rejection, 
pulmonary hypertension, or uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding requiring massive blood 
product transfusions and prolonged graft ischemic time.20)34)43) A survey of 47 international 
heart transplant centers found that the incidence of PGD was 7.4%. Mortality among patients 
reported in this survey was 30% at 30 days and 35% at 1 year. The most common causes 
of 30-day mortality were multiorgan failure in 70% of patients, graft failure in 20%, and 
sepsis in 10%. Although the etiology of PGD is poorly understood, it is felt that preexisting 
donor heart disease, injury to the donor heart during brain death, ischemia during the organ 
recovery process, preservation, and re-implantation, and reperfusion injury immediately 
after re-implantation of the allograft and release of the aortic cross-clamp may contribute 
to the development of PGD. Total ischemic time greater than 4 hours has been associated 
with an increased risk of PGD45) and hearts from older donors are more susceptible to 
ischemic injury.46) Injury to the allograft may be transient (myocardial stunning), lasting 
for 12 to 24 hours after transplantation in some cases. However, contraction band necrosis 
and other evidence of ischemic injury can be seen in biopsy specimens from persistently 
dysfunctional hearts as well as in those experiencing functional recovery. Treatment options 
for PGD include the use of high-dose inotropic agents to support LV and RV function and 
the use of nitric oxide for RV dysfunction. If medical management does not improve the 
patient's hemodynamics, early initiation of MCS with an IABP, ECMO, or a temporary VAD is 
recommended before the development of severe end-organ dysfunction. Graft function will 
recover in many patients after a few weeks, but re-transplantation is an option for selected 
patients with persistent graft dysfunction and reasonable end-organ function.20)34)43)
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION STRATEGIES IN HEART 
TRANSPLANTATION
Current immunosuppression strategies in HTx follow several general principles.34)43) The 
first is that immune reactions leading to graft rejection are the highest early (within the 
first 3–6 months) after graft implantation and gradually decrease thereafter. Thus, most 
regimens use the highest levels of immunosuppression immediately after surgery and 
decrease those levels over the first year, eventually settling on the lowest maintenance levels 
of immune suppression that are compatible with preventing graft rejection and minimizing 
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 574
The Past, Present and Future of HTx

drug toxicities. The second general principle is to use low doses of several drugs without 
overlapping toxicities over the use of higher doses of fewer drugs whenever feasible. The 
third principle is that excessive immunosuppression is undesirable because it leads to a 
myriad of undesirable effects, such as susceptibility to infection and malignancy. Finding the 
right balance between over- and under-immunosuppression in an individual patient is truly 
an art that uses science.34) Immunosuppressive regimens can be classified as induction and 
maintenance. Induction regimens provide intense early postoperative immune suppression 
while maintenance regimens are used throughout the patient's life to prevent rejection.
Induction therapy
Approximately 50 percent of heart transplant programs currently employ a strategy of 
augmented immunosuppression, or induction therapy, during the early postoperative period.3)
The goal of induction therapy is to provide intense immunosuppression when the risk of 
allograft rejection is highest. From a clinical perspective, the main advantages of induction 
therapy are to allow delayed initiation of nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drugs in patients 
with compromised renal function prior to or following surgery. This also provides some 
flexibility with respect to early glucocorticoid weaning or the administration of glucocorticoidsparing maintenance regimens after transplantation.34)43) However, the overall utility of 
induction is uncertain and data comparing induction protocols are limited. Patients at 
highest risk for fatal rejection include patients with panel reactive antibodies (PRA) >10% 
or a high number of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches. Younger patients with 
‘memory’ feature (prior history of pregnancy, multiple transfusion, and MCS) may derive a 
benefit from induction therapy. Agents used for induction therapy include polyclonal antithymocyte antibodies derived from the immunization of horses (ATGAM®; Pfizer Inc., New 
York, USA) or rabbits (Thymoglobulin; Genzyme Corporation Indication, Cambridge, MA, 
USA) with human thymocytes (antithymocyte globulin [ATG]). These agents may reduce 
the risk of early rejection, but have also been associated with an increased risk of infection.34)
Anti-interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL2RA) result in reduced rates of moderate or severe 
cellular rejection among heart transplant patients treated with standard immunosuppression, 
without increasing the incidence of opportunistic infections or cancer at 1 year. However, 
among patients receiving IL2RA induction, there was an increased risk of fatal infections 
when cytolytic therapy was concomitantly used. Although induction therapy is commonly 
used, there have been no large randomized trials demonstrating the benefit of induction 
therapy versus no induction therapy.34) Recent systemic reviews and meta-analyses revealed 
that the use of induction therapy was not associated with improved survival or rejection rates 
compared with no induction therapy. Moderate-to-severe rejection may be reduced by the 
administration of ATG compared to IL2RA, especially in patients at higher risk of rejection.47)
Maintenance immunosuppressive regimens
Most maintenance immunosuppressive protocols employ a three-drug regimen consisting 
of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI, cyclosporine or tacrolimus), an antimetabolite agent 
(mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] or less commonly azathioprine), and tapering doses of 
glucocorticoids over the first year post-transplantation.34)43) The commonly used drugs in HTx 
and their toxicities are outlined in Table 6.
Calcineurin inhibitors
Since the introduction of cyclosporine in the early 1980s, CNIs have remained the 
cornerstone of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy in heart and other solid organ 
transplantation.34)43) These drugs exert their immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting 
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 575
The Past, Present and Future of HTx

calcineurin, which is normally responsible for the transcription of interleukin-2 and several 
other cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor, and interferon-gamma. The end result is a blunting of T-lymphocyte 
activation and proliferation in response to alloantigens. The 2 available CNIs, cyclosporine 
and tacrolimus, form complexes with different intracellular binding proteins. These drugprotein complexes subsequently bind to and inhibit calcineurin. Generally, tacrolimus is 
favored over cyclosporine based on evidence from clinical trials suggesting that tacrolimusbased immunosuppression is associated with decreased rates of acute rejection.48)49) Although 
both agents can result in nephrotoxicity, more cases of hypertension and dyslipidemia were 
reported after cyclosporine use, and a higher incidence of new-onset insulin-requiring 
diabetes was observed after tacrolimus use.50)51)
Antimetabolite agents
Antimetabolites, or antiproliferative agents, interfere with the synthesis of nucleic acids 
and exert their immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the proliferation of both T and B 
lymphocytes.34) MMF has replaced azathioprine as the preferred antimetabolite agent in 
recent years on the basis of a clinical trial demonstrating a significant reduction in both 
mortality and the incidence of treatable rejection at 1 year with MMF versus azathioprine.52)
Mycophenolate sodium is an enteric-coated, delayed-release formulation developed to 
improve upper gastrointestinal tolerability of MMF. Because of this coating, the tablet 
should not be crushed. It is therapeutically similar to MMF with respect to the prevention 
of biopsy-proven and treated acute rejection episodes, graft loss, or death.53) The following 
conversions between MMF and mycophenolate sodium should provide equimolar amounts 
of mycophenolic acid (MPA) (1,000 mg MMF = 720 mg mycophenolate sodium and 1,500 mg 
MMF = 1,080 mg mycophenolate sodium, respectively).

Proliferation signal inhibitors
A new class of drugs known as proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs), or mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, has been used in selected patients with renal insufficiency, 
cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), or malignancies in an attempt to reverse or slow 
progression of these conditions. The 2 agents in this class, sirolimus and everolimus, inhibit 
the proliferation of T cells, B cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells in response to growth 
factor and cytokine signals.34) Compared to azathioprine, both sirolimus and everolimus 
reduce the incidence of acute rejection and slow the development of CAV when used in 
conjunction with cyclosporine and prednisone in de novo heart transplant recipients.54)55)
The main difference between sirolimus and everolimus is that the half-life of everolimus (30 
hours) is approximately half that of sirolimus (60 hours). Compared to MMF, everolimus 
is not inferior with respect to the combined end point of rejection, graft loss, and death.56)
MMF demonstrates less CAV progression as measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) 
at 1 year.57) Other benefits of sirolimus include slowing of CAV progression and reduction in 
the incidence of clinically significant cardiac events.58) Also, when used in heart transplant 
recipients with significant renal impairment, sirolimus permits the minimization or 
complete withdrawal of the CNIs, resulting in notable improvements in renal function 
without an associated increased risk of rejection.59)60) Sirolimus is generally not initiated 
de novo after transplantation because of an increased risk of sternal wound dehiscence.61)
However, on the basis of the benefits observed in clinical trials, sirolimus can be initiated 
later after transplantation for specific indications. The PSIs are often used in place of MMF 
in patients with rejection, allograft vasculopathy, malignancy, and viral infections such 
as CMV62) to prevent recurrence or progression. When used in place of CNI, the PSIs may 
prevent progression of renal dysfunction. In the Scandinavian Heart Transplant Everolimus 
De Novo Study with Early Calcineurin Inhibitor Avoidance (SCHEDULE) trial, everolimus 
was associated with significant improvement in renal function for de novo heart transplant 
recipients compared to cyclosporine. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in CAV 
progression and its incidence at 12 months post-transplant. However, there was significantly 
more acute rejection which could potentially counteract the aforementioned observed 
benefits.63)
Glucocorticoids
Glucocorticoids are non-specific anti-inflammatory agents that interrupt multiple steps 
in immune system activation, including antigen presentation, cytokine production, and 
proliferation of lymphocytes. Although steroids are highly effective for the prevention and 
treatment of acute rejection, their long-term use is associated with a number of adverse 
effects, including new-onset or worsening diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, 
fluid retention, myopathy, osteoporosis, and a predisposition toward opportunistic 
infections.34)43) While most programs employ glucocorticoids as one of the three maintenance 
immunosuppressive agents, they are used in relatively high doses in the early postoperative 
period but then tapered to low doses or discontinued altogether after the first 6 to 12 months.34)
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF REJECTION
Diagnosis
Transplant rejection remains one of the major causes of death after HTx3) and is classified as 
hyperacute rejection, acute cellular rejection (ACR), or AMR. Because symptoms are often 
vague, routine testing for rejection is standard practice. Unlike renal or liver transplantation, 
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 577
The Past, Present and Future of HTx

there are no laboratory markers for rejection in HTx, and the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) 
remains the cornerstone of rejection surveillance. Despite its limitations (sampling error, 
interobserver interpretation variability among pathologists, and invasiveness64)), EMB has 
remained the gold standard for the diagnosis of acute allograft rejection. It is performed 
via the right internal jugular vein or femoral vein by introducing a bioptome into the right 
ventricle and obtaining three to five pieces of endomyocardium, typically from the RV 
septum.34)
A new frontier in cardiac allograft rejection screening includes gene expression profiling 
(GEP).65) The AlloMap (CareDx, Brisbane, CA, USA) is a gene expression profile of peripheral 
blood that has been incorporated into the ISHLT guidelines.66) The test screens for a 20-gene 
panel with 11 rejection-related genes and 9 genes for normalization and quality control. 
The result is reported as a single score on a scale of 0 to 40, and indicates the probability 
of moderate or severe ACR based on findings from the Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene 
Expression Observational (CARGO) study. The 11 genes were identified based on the highest 
and most statistically significant expression differences.67) In a randomized trial, GEP was 
shown to be non-inferior to biopsy in the diagnosis of ACR,68) and it was also useful early 
after transplantation.69) One role of GEP is to screen low-risk patients at predetermined 
intervals, with biopsies performed only if the GEP score is abnormal. However, patients with 
a history of, or risk factors for, AMR are not candidates for GEP screening, as the test has 
only been validated for ACR.34)
Hyperacute rejection
Although now uncommon, the development of hyperacute rejection was the most 
feared complication prior to the advent of prospective cross-matching and effective 
immunosuppressive therapy.43) Hyperacute rejection is mediated by preformed antibodies 
to the allograft in the recipient. It typically presents following surgical engraftment and 
restoration of native circulation as an almost immediate, aggressive and inevitably lethal 
immune attack on the organ. Hyperacute rejection manifests as severe graft failure within 
the first few minutes to hours after transplantation. Without inotropic agents and MCS, 
plasmapheresis, and intense immunosuppression, the recipient usually does not survive.34)
Acute cellular rejection
ACR, the most common form of rejection in heart transplant, is characterized by a 
predominantly T-cell mediated response with infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes, 
which in turn can lead to myocyte necrosis. Histologically, ACR is defined by inflammatory 
infiltrates, which are typically lymphocyte-predominant with associated evidence of myocyte 
injury (Table 7).43)66)70)
The diagnosis of ACR is made from EMB. The most recent ACR grading scale, which 
classifies rejection into mild (1R), moderate (2R) or severe (3R) grades has allowed 
standardization of reporting, although variability of interpretation and discordance 
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 578

between pathologists remains, particularly at higher grades of rejection. The main benefit 
of the new grading scale is that it allows improved guidance toward appropriate therapy, 
in conjunction with clinical assessments. Generally speaking, mild grades of rejection 
(ISHLT grade 1R) do not require augmentation of immunosuppressive therapy as the vast 
majority of these episodes resolve spontaneously, without any increased risk of subsequent 
poor outcomes. However, higher grades (≥2R) invariably require aggressive supplemental 
immunosuppression. ACR may occur at any time after HTx, but is most frequently seen 
in the first 6 months post-transplant. The initial risk of allograft rejection increases in the 
first 1–3 months after transplantation, and then rapidly decreases thereafter, merging with 
a low constant risk of rejection after 1 year. A number of risk factors have been identified 
for ACR: younger age of recipients, female sex (donors and recipients), higher number of 
HLA mismatches, black recipients, and use of induction therapy. The development of acute 
rejection requiring augmentation of immunosuppression leads to a higher incidence of CAV 
and mortality.3)43)66)
Antibody-mediated rejection
AMR develops when recipient antibodies are directed against donor-HLA antigens (and less 
so non-HLA antigens) on allograft endothelium, which initiates the complement cascade and 
causes tissue injury via inflammatory pathways. Complement and are deposited within the 
allograft microvasculature, resulting in an inflammatory process characterized by endothelial 
cell activation, macrophage infiltration, cytokine upregulation, increased vascular 
permeability, and microvascular thrombosis.43)71) The diagnosis of AMR remains technically 
challenging. A consensus on its definition and management has only recently been reached. 
AMR is divided into 3 grades of severity based on immunologic and histopathologic criteria: 
pAMR1(H+) or pAMR1(I+), pAMR2, and pAMR3 (Table 8).72)
Clinically, AMR most frequently presents during the first 1–2 months after transplantation, 
and is accompanied by a rise in donor-specific antibodies.43)73) In cases where AMR occurs 
within the first week post-transplant, the recipient usually has evidence of pre-sensitization 
to donor HLA antigens. In these early cases of AMR, the patient typically has accompanying 
graft dysfunction. When AMR occurs 1 year after transplantation, it is typically due to de novo
donor-specific antibodies and the prognosis is poor, with increased mortality and associated 
CAV in these cases.43)74) Risk factors associated with the development of AMR include elevated 
pre-transplant PRAs, positive donor-specific crossmatch, development of de novo donorspecific antibodies post-transplant, female sex, CMV seropositivity, prior implantation of a 
VAD, and/or re-transplantation.43)
Treatment
The management of rejection proceeds in a stepwise fashion based on the severity of 
rejection detected on biopsy and the patient's clinical presentation (Table 9).34)
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 579

These cases may be associated with profound hemodynamic dysfunction and poor clinical outcomes
AMR = antibody-medicated rejection; ISHLT = International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation.

Biopsies with grade 1R or AMR 1, in the absence of clinical or hemodynamic compromise, 
generally merit no intervention. More serious findings on biopsy, including grade 2R or higher 
and AMR 2 or higher warrant treatment. As shown in Table 9, the intensity of treatment 
depends on the patient's clinical presentation. If the patient is asymptomatic (no HF symptoms 
and normal LVEF), treatment options include: oral pulse steroids, targeting higher levels of 
immunosuppressive medications, switching from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or switching from 
MMF to a PSI. Given the equivalent success of intravenous (IV) and oral corticosteroid therapy 
for the treatment of asymptomatic ACR,75) an outpatient course of oral corticosteroids is often 
the first-line of treatment. For patients with HF symptoms or reduced EF, treatment is more 
aggressive, comprising IV corticosteroids and anti-thymocyte globulin cytolytic therapy. If there 
is evidence of grade AMR 2 or higher, patients will also often receive IV Ig. If donor-specific 
anti-HLA antibodies are present in the setting of AMR, patients may receive more intensive 
therapy with rituximab or bortezomib. Plasmapheresis may also be used in this setting. 
Finally, in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, empiric aggressive treatment includes 
IV corticosteroids, cytolytic therapy, plasmapheresis, IV Ig, heparin, and hemodynamic 
support with IABP or even ECMO.34) Any rejection episode should prompt an investigation 
for precipitating causes such as infection, noncompliance, or drug interactions resulting in 
subtherapeutic immunosuppressive drug levels. A biopsy should be repeated 2 weeks after 
completion of treatment to document improvement or resolution of the rejection episode.
OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT AND LONG-TERM 
COMPLICATIONS IN HEART TRANSPLANTATION
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy
CAV, best characterized as a diffuse immune-mediated pan-arteritis with concentric, 
longitudinal intimal thickening of the coronary arteries, remains a major cause of long-term 
morbidity and mortality after transplantation.43) The incidence of CAV varies widely as a result 
of differences in the definition of the disease and in patient populations. However, by various 
estimates, the CAV incidence ranges from 42% at 5 years to 50% at 10 years.34) CAV can occur 
as early as 1 year after transplantation, and this accelerated form of disease is more aggressive 
and associated with a worse prognosis. Even in patients without apparent angiographic 
epicardial disease, microvascular abnormalities may be present and are associated with 
adverse outcomes.76) Despite improvements in immunosuppression over the past three 
decades, the incidence of CAV has not significantly decreased, and its development continues 
to limit long-term survival in patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. Risk factors for

CAV include a history of rejection, older age of the donor, the presence of donor-specific 
anti-HLA antibodies, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and traditional risk factors for coronary 
atherosclerosis. CAV often remains asymptomatic due to denervation of the donor heart, 
which blunts anginal pain. Symptomatic CAV may present with dyspnea, LV dysfunction, 
restrictive physiology, or even sudden cardiac death. The gold standard for diagnosis of 
CAV is the coronary angiogram, which can be performed annually. The maximal intimal 
thickness measured by IVUS at 1-year compared to baseline is a predictor for subsequent 
angiographic development of CAV and other poor long-term outcomes. Clinically apparent 
CAV is associated with a poor prognosis and, therefore, prevention is an important strategy. 
Medical strategies to abrogate CAV include the administration of statins77) and targeted use of 
PSIs such as sirolimus/everolimus. Interventional options for CAV include the placement of 
drug-eluting stents, but these are usually temporary measures. The only definitive solution is 
re-transplantation.
Infection
Infections are the major cause of death during the first postoperative year and remain a 
threat throughout the life of a chronically immunosuppressed patient. Infections in the first 
postoperative month are commonly bacterial and typically related to indwelling catheters and 
wound infections.34) A significant source of these infections are nosocomial organisms such 
as Legionella, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Klebsiella, and Escherichia coli. These infections 
typically present in the form of pneumonias, urinary tract infections, sternal wound 
infections and mediastinitis, and bacteremia. Late infections (those that occur 2 months to 
1 year after transplantation) are more diverse. In addition to typical pathogens, transplant 
recipients are susceptible to viruses (particularly CMV78)), fungi79) (Aspergillus, Candida, and 
Pneumocystis spp.), and Mycobacterium, Nocardia, and Toxoplasma species. Effective therapy 
requires an extremely aggressive approach to obtaining a specific diagnosis. A background 
of experience in recognizing the more common clinical presentations of CMV, Aspergillus
species, and other opportunistic infectious agents is also important. Infection surveillance is 
mainly clinical, but routine chest radiography often detects infections, especially fungal and 
mycobacterial pulmonary infections, that may be at an early and asymptomatic stage.
Balancing the risks of infection and rejection with immunosuppression relies on an 
understanding of the patient's global immune state. An immune-monitoring assay 
(ImmuKnow®; Viracor-IBT, Lee's Summit, MO, USA) performed on peripheral blood, 
which measures adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from activated lymphocytes, may 
offer some guidance in profoundly immunosuppressed patients.80) Given the degree of 
immunosuppression, all transplant recipients receive antimicrobial prophylaxis for oral 
candidiasis, toxoplasmosis and pneumocystis, and CMV over the first post-transplant year. 
The use of vaccines in heart transplant recipients remains controversial. Live vaccines are 
definitely contraindicated because of the patients' immunosuppressed states. Even dead 
vaccines may pose a risk because they can promote activation of the immune system and 
cause rejection.81) At some centers, dead vaccines such as the influenza or pneumococcal 
vaccines are recommended only to patients more than 6 months after transplant and those 
with no history of rejection within the previous 6 months.
Post-heart transplantation malignancy
Malignancy is one of the most common causes of late mortality in heart transplant 
recipients.3) Malignancies are approximately 2- to 4-fold more common in heart transplant 
compared to renal transplant recipients. The enhanced risk of cancer among cardiac

The Past, Present and Future of HTx

transplant recipients is thought to reflect the greater degree of immunosuppression 
that heart transplant recipients receive, possibly because of inherent immunologic 
requirements.34)82) All immunosuppressive agents are believed to contribute to the cumulative 
risk of malignancy, with the possible exception of corticosteroids. However, the PSIs may be 
associated with a decreased incidence and progression of malignancy compared to CNIs and 
antimetabolites.83)84) Cancer in solid organ transplant recipients usually presents at least 3 
to 5 years after transplantation.34) Cutaneous malignancies are the most common type after 
HTx, and include mainly squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas. Risk factors common to 
the general population for the development of skin cancers include fair skin, previous history 
of skin cancer, and geographic location (in areas of high sun exposure). Specifically, in heart 
transplant recipients, more than 10% of adult heart transplant recipients developed a de 
novo malignancy between years 1 and 5 after transplantation, which was associated with an 
increase in mortality.85) The incidence of post-transplant de novo solid malignancy increased 
temporally, with the largest increase seen in the skin cancers. Long-term voriconazole use 
for treatment of fungal infections such as aspergillosis is known to be associated with a more 
increased risk of developing skin cancer.86)
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), most commonly a B-cell lymphoma 
related to EBV infection, may occur after transplantation.87) More than 50% of patients 
with PTLD present with extranodal masses involving the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, skin, 
liver, central nervous system, and the allograft itself. Risk factors for the development of 
PTLD include the use of cytolytic therapy for induction88) and EBV serostatus (with EBVseronegative recipients of EBV-seropositive donors being at the highest risk). Neoplasms 
common in the general population also occur in heart transplant recipients, including breast, 
lung, and prostate. Lung cancer is more common in heart and lung transplant recipients 
than in recipients of other solid organs, likely because smoking, a strong risk factor for lung 
cancer, may also contribute to end-stage heart and lung disease requiring transplantation.34)
The most critical factor in the treatment of malignancies is prevention. Heart transplant 
recipients should undergo routine health maintenance screenings with their primary care 
physicians, including mammograms, pap smears, prostate exams, and colonoscopies 
as indicated for non-transplant patients. In addition, patients are instructed to use sun 
protection and to establish care with a dermatologist for routine skin exams. Individualized 
immunosuppression strategies and enhanced cancer screening should be studied to 
determine whether they can reduce the adverse outcomes of post-transplantation malignancy.
FUTURE OF HEART TRANSPLANTATION
Rejection diagnostic methods
Early detection of rejection is crucial for post-transplant care. Despite progress in 
immunosuppression, ACR and AMR remain serious complications during and after the first 
post-transplant year.65) The current gold standard for diagnosis is EMB, although this is not 
ideal due to its invasiveness and associated risk, sampling error, and inter-reader variability. 
Therefore, there is currently an unmet need to establish an objective diagnostic test for 
cardiac allograft rejection.65)
Recently, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has been investigated, and shows promise for 
the detection of allograft rejection with high sensitivity.89)90) CMR lacks ionizing radiation 
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 582
The Past, Present and Future of HTx

and can survey the entire myocardium, thus decreasing the possibility of false negatives due 
to sampling error as observed in EMB. In a study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of CMR 
versus EMB for acute rejection, CMR had a high sensitivity (93%) and high negative predictive 
value (98%), highlighting that CMR could be utilized as a screening test before routine 
EMB.90) The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has also been investigated in 
small cohorts,89) but its role in transplant screening is not clear in the absence of prospective 
data with larger sample sizes from multiple centers. Overall, CMR has the potential to detect 
early changes accompanying allograft rejection, and may be helpful in cases in which the 
biopsy is negative. However, much larger studies are needed for validation.43)
Another emerging technology in the noninvasive diagnosis of rejection involves cell-free DNA 
technology. Donor derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is detectable in both the urine and blood 
of transplant recipients.91) After transplantation and organ engraftment, dd-cfDNA will reach its 
highest value, up to >5% of total cfDNA, with a rapid decrease to <0.5% within 1 week. During 
an episode of rejection, dd-cfDNA are shed into the blood and can be accompanied by a 5-fold 
increase that can be measured by current assays.65) The release of dd-cfDNA occurs earlier than 
other clinical markers of rejection and could potentially be used to monitor transplant patients 
at regular intervals to allow early diagnosis and treatment.92) This dd-cfDNA may be a candidate 
marker for the noninvasive diagnosis of graft injury, because increased levels of donor-derived 
DNA correlate with ACR events, as determined by EMB in early studies.93)
Immune tolerance
Immune tolerance would lessen the need for immunosuppression, and thus reduce 
immunosuppressant-related complications. Chimerism, defined as the existence of 2 
allogeneic cell lines, remains the ultimate goal and would enable specific tolerance to 
donor antigens while simultaneously retaining the ability to fight infection and prevent 
malignancy.43) In recent years, researchers have attempted to establish central tolerance via 
transplantation of donor bone marrow. One study reported the findings of 6 human kidney 
transplant patients who were appropriately conditioned with non-myeloablative therapy 
including cyclophosphamide, ATG, and thymic irradiation. This study showed that bone 
marrow transplantation could induce tolerance without requiring immunosuppression. 
However, all reports of this method have resulted in a loss of mixed chimerism within 
months of transplantation,94) possibly due to the inflammatory response. A newer approach 
using bioengineered mobilized cellular products enriched for hematopoietic stem cells 
and tolerogenic graft facilitating cells combined with non-myeloablative conditioning, was 
employed in a recent study involving 19 kidney allograft recipients with highly mismatched 
donors.95) Thus far, 12 of the 19 patients have been effectively weaned off immunosuppression, 
with intact grafts and maintenance of stable mixed chimerism. In the future, this early 
success of induction of stable mixed chimerism across HLA barriers may be achievable in the 
regular clinical practice of HTx. Future tolerance induction research will depend on further 
investigation of the mechanism of tolerance, and further studies to increase safety and 
broaden the applicability of initial studies using enhanced stem cell transplantation.43)
Xenotransplantation
Xenotransplantation explores transplantation of organs between different species. Leonard 
Bailey at Loma Linda University performed the first cardiac xenotransplantation in 1984, 
transplanting a baboon's heart into an infant with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The baby 
survived only 12 days, and ultimately died of multi-organ failure. Initially, the function of 
the transplanted organs was limited to only days or weeks, due to the powerful response of 
https://e-kcj.org https://doi.org/10.4070/kcj.2018.0189 583
The Past, Present and Future of HTx

the human immune system against nonhuman donor antigens that could not be overcome 
by standard immunosuppression methods.96) However, with increasing numbers of patients 
in end-stage HF and the shortage of donors, there has been a renewed interest in the 
possibility of cardiac xenotransplantation. Advantages include an unlimited supply and 
elective availability of donor organs, expansion of the candidate pool, and avoidance of the 
detrimental effects of brain death on donor organ function.65)97)98) Although monkeys and 
baboons are most phylogenetically like humans, given the ecological and ethical restrictions, 
the pig is the only animal available to replace human tissues. The pig is physiologically 
similar to humans and its organ sizes are comparable. Pigs can be raised in controlled 
environments and, more importantly, can be genetically modified. The main limitations 
to xenotransplantation are rejection, including hyperacute, acute, and chronic vascular 
forms, and the risk of transmitting zoonoses. The development of genetically-modified 
pigs has allowed for the expression of human antigens that can reduce the risk of rejection 
and provide hope for future feasibility. With the introduction of galactose-α-1,3-galactose 
(Gal)-knockout pigs, prolonged survival especially in heart and kidney xenotransplantation, 
was recorded. However, remaining antibody barriers to non-Gal antigens continue to be 
the hurdle to overcome. The production of genetically engineered pigs was difficult and 
required a significant amount of time. However, advances in gene editing, such as zinc 
finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases, and most recently, clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology have made the 
production of genetically engineered pigs easier and available to more researchers. Today, 
the survival of pig-to-nonhuman primate heterotopic heart xenotransplantation has reached 
945 days.99) This required higher-than-standard immunosuppression therapy, including 
maintenance with anti-CD40 antibody. However, survival of orthotopic pig to nonhuman 
primate HTx grafts has so far been limited to less than 2 months, mostly as a result of 
perioperative cardiac xenograft dysfunction, which is believed to be distinct from acute 
rejection. Another concern in xenotransplantation is the risk of transmission of infection. 
Although numerous biological and logistical issues must be resolved before pig to human 
HTx can be undertaken, recent progress in the clinical testing of pig to human kidney and 
islet transplantation highlight future possibilities.96)
CONCLUSION
HTx has become the preferred standard therapy for patients with end-stage HF. 
Improvements in immunosuppressant therapy, donor procurement, surgical techniques, and 
post-HTx care have resulted in a substantial decrease in acute allograft rejection, which had 
previously significantly limited the survival of transplant recipients. However, limitations 
to long-term allograft survival exist, including rejection, infection, CAV, and malignancy. 
Nevertheless, with a careful balance of immunosuppressive therapy and vigilant surveillance 
for complications, we can expect further advances in the long-term outcomes of heart 
transplant recipients over the decades to come.
