Abstract
Background: Although transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been used extensively for advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), no consensus has been reached and an
evidence base for practice is lacking. This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of TACE for treatment of
HCC with PVTT.
Methods: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane library databases were searched up to August
2012 for controlled trials assessing TACE in patients with PVTT. Data concerning the study design, characteristics of
trials, and outcomes were extracted. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using
random effects models.
Results: Eight controlled trials involving 1601 HCC patients were included. TACE significantly improved the
6-month (HR, 0.41; 95% CI: 0.32–0.53; z, 6.28; p = 0.000) and 1-year (HR, 0.44; 95% CI: 0.34–0.57; z, 6.22; p = 0.000)
overall survival of patients with PVTT compared with conservative treatment. Subgroup analyses showed that TACE
was significantly effective in HCC patients whether with main portal vein (MPV) obstruction or with segmental PVTT.
Fatal complications were rare, even in patients with MPV obstruction. Temporary liver decompensation and
postembolization syndrome occurred frequently. However, they could be treated successfully with conservative
treatment.
Conclusions: TACE, as a safe treatment, has potential for incurring a survival benefit for advanced HCC with PVTT,
even with MPV obstruction. Further large randomized controlled trials may be needed to confirm this result.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has one of the highest
mortality rates for malignancies worldwide, particularly
in Asian countries [1]. Although preliminary screening
and diagnosis have allowed HCC patients to benefit from
radical resection, transplantation, or radiofrequency
ablation, tumors in some patients still progress rapidly
because of local spreading or metastases, particularly
in those with background cirrhosis. Therefore, overall
survival (OS) still can not be acquired the encouraged
improvement in most patients.
Portal vein invasion is an important survival prognostic
factor for HCC. To date, some treatments have been used
for portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), such as
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiation, and
systematic chemotherapy, none of which has strong
evidence-based support. According to Barcelona Clinic
Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging [2], HCC patients with
PVTT, or BCLC stage C, can only receive sorafenib target
therapy [3]. However, for patients with advanced HCC,
including vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastases,
the median survival time with sorafenib is short – only
6.5 months in Asia [4]. In developing countries, such as
China, economic conditions restrict the application of

sorafenib in some patients. Therefore, consecutive TACE
is still used to treat selective patients with PVTT.
As the therapeutic approach of choice for unresectable
HCC, effects of TACE have been confirmed by some
randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A meta-analysis of
prospective randomized trials has shown that survival is
improved after TACE for unresectable HCC with good
liver function preservation [5]. Nevertheless, it is generally
accepted that TACE is not recommended in cases of
macroscopic portal vein invasion because of the
potentially increased risk of liver failure. Therefore, most
designed and reported TACE-related clinical trials have
excluded patients with PVTT, particularly with main
portal vein (MPV) obstruction. Recently, however, some
prospective controlled trials have shown the survival
benefits of TACE treatment in advanced HCC with PVTT
[6,7]. Therefore, the clear effects and safety of TACE in
these patients remain controversial.
This meta-analysis of controlled trials was performed
to evaluate the effects of TACE treatment in patients
with HCC and PVTT, including MPV obstruction.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We performed a search of Ovid Medline (from 1945 to
“in press”), EMBASE, Web of Knowledge including SCIE
(Science Citation Index Expanded) and CPCI-S (Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science) from 1997
to date, and the Cochrane library up to August 2012. At
first, the terms “hepatocellular carcinoma,” “liver cancer,”
“hepatoma,” “transarterial chemoembolization,” “portal
vein,” “thrombus,” and “clinical trials” were used. Only a
few trials were available; therefore, the scope of the
search was expanded. The terms “chemoembolization”
and “portal vein” were mainly used. The references in the
articles retrieved were also searched for relevant titles.
Prospective controlled trials concerning HCC patients
with PVTT, including MPV obstruction, who received
TACE or conservative treatment, were the first choice
for inclusion. Retrospective controlled trials with arms
including TACE and conservative treatment were also
included. Each included study was approved by an ethics
committee or institutional review board. Exclusion criteria
were: (1) no access to full text for quality assessment
and data extraction; (2) lack of study controls; and (3)
case reports.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two investigators independently reviewed all potentially
eligible studies and collected data on patient and study
characteristics. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS)
was used to assess the study quality. The NOS uses
two different tools for case–control and cohort studies
and consists of three parameters of quality: selection
(0–4 points), comparability (0–2 points), and outcome
assessment (0–3 points). The maximum possible score is
9 points, representing the highest methodological study.
Data synthesis and analysis
The 6-month and 1-year OS were assessed as the primary
measures of treatment effect, using hazard ratio (HR)
with 95% confidence interval (CI). The methods for
incorporating summary time-to-event data into the
meta-analysis were performed as described previously [8].
In addition to the analysis of OS, we also assessed the
tumor response to TACE. Complete response was
defined as no evidence of neoplastic disease at computed
tomography at the end of the treatment. Partial response
was defined as a reduction in total tumor size by >50%.
Pooled analyses were calculated using random-effect
models. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine
the stability of the overall treatment effects. We excluded
each study at a time to ensure that no single study would
be solely responsible for the significance of any result.
Statistical heterogeneity was measured using I
2 statistics.
Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analyses were
conducted to explore and explain diversity (heterogeneity)
among the results of different studies. All p values
were two-tailed, and statistical significance was set at
0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA
version 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Eligible studies
The flow of selecting studies for the meta-analysis is
shown in Figure 1. Among the initial 1777 hits, 72 articles
were retrieved for detailed evaluation, and eight that
satisfied the inclusion criteria were finally analyzed
[6,7,9-14]. All eight trials were from Asia, including two
from mainland China, one from Hong Kong, and five
from South Korea. Four trials from Europe and another
from Asia were not included because there was no full
text. These excluded studies were reported before 1999.
According to the available abstracts, it was difficult to
recognize whether the specific designs comparing roles
between TACE and conservative treatment for advanced
HCC with PVTT were included. Quality assessment of
the trials is shown in Additional file 1. Four studies were
of high quality and another four had an NOS score of 6.
The main features of the eight studies included in the
meta-analysis are shown in Table 1. Three trials were prospective [6,7,9], whereas the other five were retrospective.
These trials included 1601 patients, 923 of whom received
TACE. Two trials only included patients with MPV
invasion [9,10]. In four trials, therapeutic regimens
were compared with conservative treatment [6,7,9,10],
and in the remaining four trials, treatment procedures
were compared with each other. Two of the trials had

more than three arms [11,12]. The percentage of male
patients ranged from 84% to 100%, and the mean age from
45 to 55 years. Most patients had background hepatitis B
virus (HBV). Patients who received TACE had higher
Child–Pugh A/B ratio (1:1 to 4:1) than patients who
received conservative treatment (1:2 to 1:1).
The main variables in the TACE protocol were dose
and type of chemotherapeutic agents. The mean number
of TACE sessions was 1.5–3, and the highest was 14.
TACE was repeated at fixed intervals of 1–3 months.
The maximum amount of iodized oil was no more than
25 ml. The embolizing agent administered was gelatin
sponge particles (Gelform) with or without mitomycin
in all included trials. Nearly all TACE was performed in
selective or super-selective style.
OS
We performed a meta-analysis of the six studies
[6,7,9-12] in which chemoembolization was compared with
conservative treatment for 6-month or 1-year OS. The
effect of TACE on 6-month OS is shown in Figure 2 (six
studies with nine comparisons: 731 patients). There was
moderate statistical heterogeneity (I
2 = 61.9%, p = 0.007).
The 95% CI for the results of individual trials ranged
widely. TACE had a favorable effect on survival in all six
trials (nine comparisons). The pooled estimate of the
TACE effect was significant (HR, 0.41; 95% CI: 0.32–0.53;
z, 6.28; p = 0.000). Similarly, meta-analysis for 1-year OS
confirmed the effect of TACE in patients with PVTT
(Additional file 2). The pooled estimate was significant
(HR, 0.44; 95% CI: 0.34–0.57; z, 6.22; p = 0.000).
Sensitivity analyses suggested that the favorable effect
of TACE on overall 6-month survival was not affected
following sequential exclusion of each study in turn
(Additional file 3). Also, no trial affected the pooled
effect of TACE on overall 1-year survival when it was
omitted (Additional file 4).
We explored further the potential causes of the
heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. First, we analyzed the
effect of TACE on patients with MPV or segmental
PVTT separately. Five trials (six comparisons) [6,7,9-11]
included a comparison between TACE and conservative
treatment. The effect of TACE on 6-month OS was
favored in all five trials, and the pooled estimate of the
TACE was significant (HR, 0.43; 95% CI: 0.32–0.59; z,
5.28; p = 0.000) (Figure 3). Statistical heterogeneity was
seen (I
2 = 59.4%, p = 0.031) in the subgroup with MPV
obstruction (Figure 3A), but not in the subgroup with
Figure 1 Search flow diagram for studies included in the meta-analysis.

segmental PVTT (I
2 = 0.0%, p = 0.530) (Figure 3B). The
effect of TACE on 1-year OS showed similar results
(Additional file 5). Therefore, the main cause of heterogeneity may lie in the subgroup with MPV obstruction.
The trials suggested that liver function was a significant prognostic factor; therefore, we further analyzed the
effect of TACE on patients with Child–Pugh A or B,
separately. Only two trials [10,11] yielded related survival
data. The pooled overall estimate favored TACE in
patients with PVTT including MPV obstruction (HR,
0.42; 95% CI: 0.30–0.58; z, 4.94; p = 0.000), and the results
suggested heterogeneity in the Child–Pugh A subgroup,
but not in the Child–Pugh B group (Figure 4A). Analyzing
the data from patients with MPV obstruction in two
trials suggested a favorable effect of TACE in the
Child–Pugh A subgroup (HR, 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22–0.84; z,
2.47; p = 0.014) and Child–Pugh B subgroup (HR, 0.57;
95% CI: 0.42–0.78; z, 3.56; p = 0.000) (Figure 4B). The I
2
statistics in the Child–Pugh A subgroup increased to
76.3% (p = 0.040), which suggested that the main cause of
heterogeneity was from patients with MPV obstruction
and Child–Pugh class A. The effect of TACE on 1-year
OS showed similar results (Additional file 6).
Meta-regression analysis was also used to explore the
heterogeneity in trials for 6-month or 1-year OS. A total
of seven trials (10 comparisons) were analyzed, which
included one new trial that compared the effect of TACE
and transarterial chemoinfusion (TACI). Year, trial type
(perspective or retrospective), and country were the
three features examined [6,7,9-13]. Mean age, proportion
of male patients, percentage of HBV and MPV were also
examined. Data about Child–Pugh class and diffuse
tumor could not be analyzed because of incomplete data.
Adjusted R2 values suggested that year and percentage

of HBV partly explained the heterogeneity (13.2% and
3.3%, respectively).
TACE and TACI or hepatic resection
We also evaluated whether there was evidence of different
treatment effects based on comparisons between TACE
and TACI or hepatic resection. Although the pooled
estimate seemed to favor TACE, there was no significant
treatment difference between TACE and hepatic resection
[11,14] for 1-year OS (HR, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.70–1.20;
z, 0.65; p = 0.519) (Figure 5A). Sensitivity analysis
suggested that this beneficial effect was concealed when
we omitted the MPV group in the study by Peng et al. [14]
(p = 0.035). Subgroup analyses showed that TACE seemed
to be more suitable for patients with MPV obstruction and
hepatic resection for patients without MPV obstruction
(Figure 5A). There was no evidence of statistical
heterogeneity (I
2 = 0.0%, p = 0.464). The difference
between TACE and HR for 1-year OS was not significant
(p = 0.519) (Additional file 7A). The pooled estimate of
the TACE effect was significant when compared with
TACI for 6-month OS (HR, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.25–0.80; z,

2.73; p = 0.006) (Figure 5B). Similarly, meta-analysis for
1-year OS also favored TACE in patients with PVTT
(Additional file 7B).
Tumor response
Most patients in the trials had diffuse HCC; therefore, the
ability to measure changes in tumor size after treatment
was limited. Data about tumor responses were reported in
only two studies [11,14], which involved 489 patients. In
the two trials, there were no complete responses. Between
17% [14] and 20% [11] of patients had a partial response.
Stable disease was observed in 47% of patients in both
trials. The rate of progressive disease ranged from 37%
[11] to 38% [14].
Two trials [9,10] evaluated iodized oil (Lipidol) uptake
by MPV. The presence of iodized oil uptake in the
tumor thrombi was about 80% in nodular-type HCC and
only 21% in diffuse-type [9]. Another study showed that
the presence of iodized oil uptake in the MPV after
TACE was a significant favorable prognostic factor [10].
Treatment safety
The most frequent complication was postembolization
syndrome, including fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal
pain, with a rate ranging from 35% [13] to 94% [6]. One
study [9] reported 65% fever and 65% abdominal pain, and
another [14] reported 52% fever, 56% abdominal pain, and
49% vomiting. Temporary liver decompensation was
observed in 26% [9] to 85% [6] of patients. However, <2%
of patients had acute liver failure [9,10,14]. The rate of
hyperbilirubinemia ranged from 2% [13] to 10% [9].
Inflammation was reported in three trials, including 2%
with cholecystitis [6,14] and 0.2% [14] to 1% [10] with
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Severe gastrointestinal
bleeding was observed in 0–6% of patients [6,10,14],
which was significantly less than the 17% [10] in patients
with conservative treatment. Paralytic ileus occurred in
3% [9] to 5% [10] of patients. TACE-related deaths ranged
from 0 [6] to 6% [13].
Discussion
This meta-analysis showed that TACE was potentially
suitable and safe for advanced HCC with PVTT, including
patients with MPV obstruction. The beneficial effects
were demonstrated by improved 6-month and 1-year OS
in the TACE group, and by the improved tumor response
when compared with conservative treatment. Moreover,
the potential inhibition of tumor growth and spread
by iodized oil uptake in the MPV after TACE may be
pertinent to the OS benefits. The rate of fatal complications was low, even in patients with MPV obstruction.
Although most patients had background cirrhosis, acute
liver failure and gastrointestinal bleeding were rare. In
contrast, patients who received conservative treatment
were more prone to gastrointestinal bleeding, which may
be related to rapid tumor progression. Temporary liver

decompensation and postembolization syndrome occurred
more frequently, which can be treated successfully with
conservative treatment.
HCC is distributed unevenly worldwide, and morbidity
and mortality are particularly high in Asia, including
China, Japan, and Korea. According to the American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
guidelines for HCC treatment, advanced HCC with PVTT
can only be treated with sorafenib-targeted therapy [3].
MPV obstruction is recognized as a complete contraindication. However, in most Asian countries, TACE is still
used routinely for patients with PVTT. Consensus has
been reached recently based on the guidelines from the
main Asian countries with high HCC morbidity [15].
However, a clear evidence base for TACE in patients with
PVTT is still lacking. The present meta-analysis indicated
that TACE was a safe choice for advanced HCC with
PVTT. Combination with improved super-selection
techniques and modified methods such as DEB-TACE
(doxorubicin-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization)
[16] may improve the effects and safety of TACE. For
selected patients with MPV obstruction, especially those
with established collateral circulation and good liver function preservation, TACE treatment may prolong survival.
Subgroup estimation indicated that TACE was effective
for improving survival in patients with MPV invasion or
segmental PVTT. The main cause of heterogeneity may
lie in the MPV subgroup, particularly in those with
Child–Pugh class A. This meta-regression analysis could
only find a minor cause of heterogeneity. We think that
part of the reason is the limited data, such as liver
function, and the number of available trials. The variables
in the TACE protocol such as dose and type of chemotherapeutic agents may have caused heterogeneity.
Also, type of tumor (diffuse or nodular) may be another
important reason, because diffuse-type HCC was more
prone to develop MPV obstruction than nodular-type.
Sorafenib is recognized as the standard therapy for
advanced HCC with PVTT or metastasis. In Asia, the
median survival of patients receiving sorafenib is 6.5 -
months. However, trials comparing TACE and sorafenib
for patients with PVTT have been rare. The latest study to
compare the efficacy of TACE and sorafenib in patients
with advanced-stage (BCLC stage C) HCC suggests a
promising outcome with TACE [17]. Combined treatment
with TACE and sorafenib also indicated the survival
benefits for selective patients [18,19]. In this meta-analysis,
our exploratory analyses indicated that TACE was better
than TACI for patients with PVTT. When compared with
hepatic resection, there was no significant difference for
improving survival. It seems that TACE was more suitable
for patients with MPV invasion, whereas hepatic resection
was more suitable for the PVTT group.
Study limitations
Drawbacks pertinent to this meta-analysis were mainly
the differences in study characteristics among the included
studies. The included trials were nonrandomized trials,
partly because of great concern about the potential risk of
hepatic failure after TACE. Also, the patient selection for

different treatments was biased. Patients with better liver
function tended to be selected into the TACE group,
whereas those with poorer liver function may have been
willing to receive conservative treatment. Therefore, truly
randomized trials are difficult to design and perform. As a
result of limited eligible trials, five retrospective trials
were also included in this meta-analysis. All the trials
included in this meta-analysis were from Asia, which is
the highest-risk area for HCC. Four studies from Europe
were excluded because of the unavailability of full text.
Therefore, it is worth performing more large RCTs, even
multicenter studies, to confirm the effect of TACE on
HCC with PVTT.
Conclusions
In spite of differences in study design and population
characteristics, the meta-analysis demonstrated that
TACE has potential to improve survival and is safe for
advanced HCC with PVTT, even with MPV obstruction.
Further well-designed controlled trials may be needed to
confirm this effect.
