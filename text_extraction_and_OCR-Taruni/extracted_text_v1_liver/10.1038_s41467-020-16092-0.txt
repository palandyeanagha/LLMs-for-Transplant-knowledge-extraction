Due to their bacterial ancestry, many components of mitochondria share structural similarities with bacteria. Release of molecular danger signals from injured cell mitochondria
(mitochondria-derived damage-associated molecular patterns, mito-DAMPs) triggers a
potent inflammatory response, but their role in fibrosis is unknown. Using liver fibrosis
resistant/susceptible mouse strain system, we demonstrate that mito-DAMPs released from
injured hepatocyte mitochondria (with mtDNA as major active component) directly activate
hepatic stellate cells, the fibrogenic cell in the liver, and drive liver scarring. The release of
mito-DAMPs is controlled by efferocytosis of dying hepatocytes by phagocytic resident liver
macrophages and infiltrating Gr-1(+) myeloid cells. Circulating mito-DAMPs are markedly
increased in human patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant liver
fibrosis. Our study identifies specific pathway driving liver fibrosis, with important diagnostic
and therapeutic implications. Targeting mito-DAMP release from hepatocytes and/or modulating the phagocytic function of macrophages represents a promising antifibrotic strategy.

I
t is well known that individual patients with virtually any
chronic liver disease demonstrate significant differences in the
rate of fibrosis progression, ranging widely from 10 to 50 years
until cirrhosis develops1. A similar phenomenon, the precise
mechanism of which is poorly understood, has been reported in
inbred mouse strains, where different genetic makeup determines
susceptibility to liver fibrosis. This ranges from fibrosis resistance
in A/J mice to high susceptibility in the BALB/c strain2,3.
Understanding the cellular and molecular basis for susceptibility
versus resistance to fibrosis/cirrhosis is critical to development of
effective antifibrotic therapies, identification of patients who are
likely to progress and most in need of antifibrotic treatment, and
for stratification of patients in clinical trials4.
Prior studies provide evidence that a complex interplay of
genetic factors, and possibly epigenetic and environmental factors, might determine the wide variation in susceptibility to
fibrosis among individuals. Using quantitative trait loci analysis,
Hillebrandt et al.2 identified complement 5 as one of the susceptibility genes in inbred mice, and confirmed that a polymorphism in this gene correlates with fibrosis in human patients
with chronic hepatitis C5. Another GWAS study in hepatitis C
patients identified polymorphisms in the TLR4 (Toll-like receptor
4) gene as a determinant of fibrosis progression6. However, the
precise cellular and molecular basis of varying individual susceptibility to fibrosis, as found in all chronic disease irrespective
of etiology, remains poorly understood.
Regardless of underlying etiology, the initiating event eventually leading to tissue fibrosis is cell injury and/or death. Sterile
cell death and injury (e.g., hepatocytes in the liver) may lead to
the release of intracellular molecules called damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs). These molecules are recognized
by the innate immune system by pattern recognition receptors,
often the same molecular sensors that detect pathogens.
DAMPs are derived from different subcellular compartments,
including mitochondria, which evolved from proteobacteria
(engulfed several billions years ago by a eukaryotic cell and
adapted as intracellular “endosymbionts”)7. Due to bacterial
origin, many structural components of mitochondria (including
its DNA) share significant similarities with bacteria and are
considered a major source of highly immunogenic “mitoDAMPs” exposed by injured or dying cells8. The liver is
extremely rich in mitochondria due to its critical metabolic
function in the body, with each hepatocyte containing
1000–2000 mitochondria9. Particularly in the liver, mitoDAMPs released from injured hepatocytes may represent one
of the most abundant and potent “danger signals” that trigger
or perpetuate the innate immune response. However, whether
hepatocyte-derived mito-DAMPs impact fibrogenesis in the
liver disease is not known.
The complexity of regulatory control of scarring is further
increased by the fact that multiple hepatic cell lineages participate
in the fibrotic response. While activated hepatic stellate cells/
myofibroblasts (HSCs/MFs) are the ultimate fibrogenic effector
cell directly responsible for laying down fibrillar collagens10, the
critical paracrine contribution of macrophages11, hepatic progenitor cells/reactive cholangiocytes12, and endothelial cells13 in
determining the pace of fibrosis progression is now increasingly
recognized. Macrophages in particular have a central but complex
role in regulating liver fibrosis14, exerting opposing roles during
progressive and regression stages of liver fibrosis15. The
mechanistic role of their phagocytic function of efferocytosis (the
process of engulfment and removal of dead/dying cells by
neighboring phagocytes), the main mechanism that limits
inflammatory response to the “danger signals” emanating from
damaged or dead cells, in regulating fibrotic outcomes remains
obscure.
In this study, we performed in-depth studies of recovery from
sub-lethal acute livery injury using an inbred-resistant/-susceptible mouse strain model system in order to characterize and
interrogate the pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for
susceptibility to tissue fibrosis. We show that efficient efferocytosis (phagocytosis of injured/dead hepatocytes) by resident
F4/80(+) liver macrophages and infiltrating Gr-1(+) myeloid
cells prevents the release of hepatocyte-derived mito-DAMPs and
is a critical determinant of resistance to hepatic fibrosis. Conversely, prolonged exposure to mito-DAMPs post injury due to
inefficient efferocytosis of dead hepatocytes, or exogenous mitoDAMPs administration, is sufficient to trigger fibrogenic activation of HSCs in vivo and in vitro. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
a major active component of mito-DAMPs, is elevated in the sera
of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients and particularly
those with significant fibrosis. These findings represent the discovery of a novel regulatory pathway in hepatic fibrosis with
important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
Results
Fibrosis-resistant/-susceptible inbred mouse strain model.
First, we characterized fibrosis susceptibility in three common
inbred mouse strains (FVB, C57Bl/6, and BALB/c) subjected to
chronic administration of hepatotoxin thioacetamide (TAA) for
6 weeks. FVB demonstrated resistance; BALB/c strain developed
the most significant fibrosis; and C57Bl/6 mice showed intermediate susceptibility to liver fibrosis (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Chronic hepatotoxin-induced fibrosis models are characterized
by repetitive liver injury, which leads to gradual fibrosis
progression over an extended period of time. We hypothesized
that such dramatically divergent strain phenotypes might be
determined by strain-specific differences in response to each
acute insult. To test this, we established a model of recovery from
a single sub-lethal dose of TAA, and compared the FVB, C57Bl/6,
and BALB/c strains’ responses 1, 3, 5, and 8 days thereafter
(Fig. 1a). Biochemical quantification of hepatic collagen revealed
readily detectable progressive collagen deposition into BALB/c
livers starting from day 3 and reaching maximum (142% above
control group levels, p < 0.001) on day 8 post TAA. In contrast,
both FVB and C57Bl/6 mice developed significantly less fibrosis,
with maximum collagen levels reaching 77% and 88%, respectively, above their healthy controls (Fig. 1b). Upon histological
examination, connective tissue deposits were readily detected
by Sirius Red staining starting on day 8 in pericentral areas of
BALB/c mice, but not of FVB or C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 1d). The
degree of hepatotoxin-induced injury was similar between all
three strains studied, as measured by cumulative serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) levels 12–96 h post TAA (“area under
curve” analysis, Fig. 1c). Overall, based on data in this single-dose
TAA injury model, we were able to recapitulate strain differences
in susceptibility to fibrosis observed in the chronic TAA injury
model (BALB/c > C57Bl6 > FVB, Supplementary Fig. 1). Importantly, similar results were obtained in FVB and BALB/c mice
after acute injury with another hepatotoxin, carbon tetrachloride
(CCl4), suggesting that these strain differences were not toxin
specific (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Delayed dead hepatocyte clearance precedes fibrotic response.
Further histological examination revealed that by 24 h, TAA
caused a similar degree of pericentral hepatocyte cell death in
~50% of hepatocytes in each strain. However, striking differences were observed in the speed with which the necrotic
masses were cleared. In the resistant FVB strain, necrotic
hepatocytes were rapidly cleared and disappeared completely by
day 3, while in BALB/c they persisted even after 5 days (Fig. 2a).

C57Bl/6 strain demonstrated necrotic masses clearance rate
similar to fibrosis-resistant FVB with a delay of about 24 h. All
subsequent experiments were performed in FVB and BALB/c
mice, which demonstrated the most divergent responses.
Macroscopically, at day 8 of recovery from TAA injury, BALB/c
livers demonstrated increased stiffness and patchy whitish
lesions throughout the liver parenchyma, while FVB livers
appeared healthy and virtually indistinguishable from untreated
controls (Fig. 2b). In both strains, recovery from TAA injury
was accompanied by a robust up-regulation of pro-fibrogenic
messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding for TGFβ1, pro-collagen α1
(I), TIMP-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), with
the peak at day 3, except for TIMP-1, which was induced after
1 day (Fig. 2c). Surprisingly, the degree of transcript upregulation was nearly identical between the two strains in the
early phase (0–3 days), but differed significantly only at the late
time-points (5 and 8 days). After day 5, most pro-fibrogenic
mRNAs normalized in FVB mice, but remained elevated in
BALB/c, with the strain differences most apparent at day 8 post
injury (Fig. 2c).

Fig. 1 Fibrotic responses to acute TAA-induced hepatocyte injury recapitulate strain differences in fibrosis susceptibility (BALB/c > C57Bl/6 > FVB) in
chronic liver fibrosis model. a Experimental design of acute TAA-induced incipient liver fibrosis model in mice. Injury and wound healing responses were
evaluated at 1, 3, 5, and 8 days after a single, acute sub-lethal dose of TAA (100 mg/kg, i.p.). b Significant collagen synthesis and deposition is readily
detected in fibrosis-susceptible BALB/c mice after 5 days post-TAA injection by total hepatic collagen content measurements, with 2.5-fold increase
in BALB/c strain, but not in FVB strain, after 5 days. For each strain at 0/1/3/5/8 days time-points, n = 7/6/5/4/8 (FVB), n = 5/6/4/4/11 (C57Bl/6),
n = 8/6/4/4/12 (BALB/c) of individual animals. *P < 0.05; **p < 0.01; and ***p < 0.001 compared to respective strain controls (one-way ANOVA, followed
by Tukey’s post test). c Extent of liver injury in response to TAA is comparable among studied strains and does not determine susceptibility to fibrosis.
Cumulative hepatotoxicity of a single TAA injection was determined by serum ALT levels at early time-points at 12, 24, 48, and 96 h, which were used to
calculate area under the curve (AUC). For each strain at 0.5/1/2/4 days time-points, n = 4/6/9/4/11 (FVB), n = 4/6/6/6/7 (C57Bl/6), n = 4/6/6/6/10
(BALB/c) of individual animals. AUC was similar between FVB and BALB/c strain (see total area under curve values in the table above the graph) and was
greater in C57Bl/6, demonstrating no direct relationship of TAA hepatotoxicity with fibrosis susceptibility. d Connective tissue staining demonstrates
scarless repair of pericentral areas in FVB, but pronounced pericentral fibrosis in BALB/c strain. C57Bl/6 mice show modest fresh fibers deposition.
Representative images of pericentral areas in livers 8 days post TAA is shown (Sirius Red, original magnification, ×200; bar, 50 μm). C57Bl/6 strain
demonstrates intermediate fibrotic response. Total HYP (mg/whole liver) was calculated from individual liver weights and respective relative HYP values

Impaired efferocytosis function in fibrosis-susceptible mice.
The major cells responsible for dead cell recognition and clearance in vivo are macrophages (“professional phagocytes”), which
prompted us to investigate temporo-spatial changes in macrophage infiltrate. Both strains demonstrated similar immune cell
recruitment in early injury (12–24 h post-TAA) stages, as assessed
via hepatic mRNA expression of pan-leukocyte marker CD45 and
key macrophage/monocyte markers F4/80, Clec4F, CD68, and
CD11b/c (Supplementary Fig. 3a). However, notable temporospatial differences became apparent in the intermediate (3 days)
and late (8 days) repair phase. In situ F4/80 staining showed that
MΦ infiltrated necrotic areas at day 3 in FVB mice, and these
infiltrates cleared completely by day 8. In contrast, in BALB/c
mice macrophages accumulated at the edge of necrotic areas at
day 3, and remained in large numbers even at day 8, suggesting
incomplete efferocytosis (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Immune cell
infiltrates in both strains also stained positive for myeloid cell
markers Gr-1 (monocytes and granulocytes) and CD11b

Fig. 2 Delayed clearance of dead hepatocytes after injury precedes amplified fibrotic response in fibrosis-susceptible BALB/c strain. a Histological
examination suggests that single-dose TAA causes similar cell death in livers of FVB and BALB/c mice, but that the subsequent clearance rate of necrotic
masses differs significantly. Necrotic masses (eosinophilic areas) are rapidly cleared in fibrosis-resistant FVB mice (by day 3), but persist in fibrosissusceptible BALB/c mice past day 5 (representative low-magnification images, hematoxylin/eosin, ×50; bar, 20 μm). b Macroscopic appearance of
representative livers from FVB and BALB/c mice 8 days post-TAA injury. FVB livers completely recovered by day 8 and appear virtually indistinguishable
from healthy uninjured liver, while BALB/c livers demonstrate increased turgor, stiff consistence, and strong whitish pattern indicative of incomplete repair.
c Pro-fibrogenic gene expression in post-TAA livers indicate that delayed normalization of multiple pro-fibrogenic mRNA expression is associated with
fibrosis susceptibility in BALB/c mice. No significant strain difference at peak of fibrogenic response was observed (day 3). Hepatic expression of profibrogenic (pro-collagen α1(I), TGFβ1, TIMP-1, and MMP-2) transcript levels was quantified by QRT-PCR during recovery (0–8 days) after single TAA
injury. Results are expressed as means ± SEM, fold to healthy wild-type controls relative to β2MG mRNA (for each strain at 0/1/3/5/8 days time-points,

staining for the HSC marker desmin (green) and macrophage cell marker F4/80 (red) in FVB (left column) and BALB/c mice (right column) in late stage
(8 days) of recovery. Normal peri-sinusoidal localization of desmin-positive stellate cells and F4/80-positive macrophages is restored in FVB mice, but not
in BALB/c mice. Note large clusters of desmin-positive stellate cells (arrow) accumulate within granuloma-like macrophage infiltrates persisting in
pericentral areas of BALB/c livers. Representative images at original magnification (×200; bar, 50 μm). b Total apoptotic cell counts (left panel) and % of
apoptotic thymocytes engulfed by hepatic F4/80+ macrophages (right panel) significantly increased in the livers of FVB versus BALB/c mice 48 h postTAA-induced liver injury. In vivo apoptotic thymocytes phagocytosis assay was performed as described in “Methods” and analyzed by cell scoring/
counting in 10 random HPF per mouse. n = 4 (FVB), n = 5 (BALB/c); p value as indicated (two-tailed, Mann–Whitney t test). c Representative images of

(monocytes) (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). Double immunostaining
for F4/80 and desmin revealed that active fibrogenesis likely
occurs within these persistent macrophage infiltrates in BALB/c
mice, as evidenced by marked accumulation of desmin+ HSCs/
MFs; in contrast, desmin+ HSCs/MFs retained normal perisinusoidal distribution in resistant FVB strain (Fig. 3a).
In order to directly assess whether function of dead cell
removal by phagocytes (efferocytosis) is indeed impaired in the
livers of the fibrosis-susceptible strain, we performed an in vivo
phagocytosis assay via administration of strain-matched fluorescently labeled apoptotic thymocytes into FVB and BALB/c mice
(both healthy and after TAA-induced liver injury). We then
measured their engulfment (localization within macrophages) 1 h
later. Analysis of apoptotic cell distribution in relation to
macrophage markers revealed that liver homing of apoptotic
cells, as well as their engulfment rate by F480+-resident
macrophages, was significantly lower in injured livers of BALB/
c mice compared to FVB (Fig. 3b, c). Apoptotic cell numbers were
similar in livers of healthy FVB and BALB/c, and demonstrated
similarly high co-localization with F4/80+ macrophages (>85%
engulfed). After liver injury, apoptotic cell homing and percent of
engulfed apoptotic cells were depressed in both strains; however,
the magnitude of change was remarkably more pronounced in
BALB/c compared to FVB. Thus, total apoptotic cell counts
decreased by 57% (BALB/c) versus 31% (FVB), whereas percent
of apoptotic cell engulfed by macrophages decreased by 43.5%
(BALB/c) versus 24.7% (FVB) compared to healthy strainmatched controls (Supplementary Table 3). Proportion of
apoptotic cells co-localized with infiltrating Gr-1+ myeloid cells
in injured livers was very low (>5%) compared to that of F4/80+
macrophages, and did not differ between strains (Supplementary
Table 3).
Finally, to identify phagocytic genes potentially responsible for
inefficient efferocytosis in the fibrosis-susceptible BALB/c strain,
we profiled hepatic expression of phagocytosis-related genes
using mini-array. Among the 84 relevant genes analyzed, only
four genes were differentially expressed between strains at
baseline (Fig. 3d). In contrast, 48 h after injury, 20 genes were
upregulated in response to injury in FVB mice compared to
BALB/c (Fig. 3e, p < 0.05, see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 for a
complete list of genes). Upon additional cross-validation using
TaqMan PCR for the top 10 differentially regulated genes, five
genes were confirmed as significantly different between strains
post injury (Supplementary Table 6). Among these were genes
encoding phagocytic receptors (Cd14, Marco); recognition and
engulfment molecules (Csf1); and phagosome maturation (Serpine1, Tgm2). Thus, delayed clearance of necrotic masses (Fig. 2a),
inefficient efferocytosis (Fig. 3b, c), and persistence of macrophage infiltrates (Supplementary Fig. 3) in the injured livers of
fibrosis-susceptible BALB/c mice associated with failure to
efficiently upregulate multiple genes involved in the phagocytic
pathway.
Phagocyte depletion abrogates resistance to fibrosis. To clarify
the mechanistic role of phagocytic liver macrophages and infiltrating myeloid cells in fibrosis susceptibility, we used both
injection of clodronate-loaded liposomes (CLO), which efficiently
eliminates tissue macrophages with high phagocytic activity
(Supplementary Fig. 4a), and antibody-mediated depletion of
myeloid cell subsets. First, we depleted the macrophages either
1 day before or 1 day after TAA-induced injury by a single
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of clodronate-containing liposomes, to eliminate (1) resident phagocytic macrophages or (2)
resident and recruited/infiltrating phagocytic macrophages,
respectively (Fig. 4a) and compared fibrotic responses at the late
(8 days post injury) time-point. Based on quantitative analysis of
collagen deposition in these animals, macrophage depletion in
resistant FVB mice rendered them completely susceptible to
fibrosis, and caused only minor changes in collagen deposition in
BALB/c mice (Fig. 4b). Histologic examination revealed that MΦdepleted FVB mice failed to clear necrotic masses of hepatocytes,
which persisted at day 8 post injury (Supplementary Fig. 4b) and
developed fibrotic lesions histologically similar to that observed in
fibrosis-susceptible BALB/c strain, regardless whether depletion
was performed before or after injury (Fig. 4c). This was accompanied by a dramatic increase in pro-fibrogenic gene expression:
TGFβ1, pro-collagen α1(I), and TIMP-1 were upregulated 2–6-
folds above controls in FVB mice and did not normalize by day 8
in both strains with MΦ depletion (Fig. 4d). Upon depletion of
phagocytes, there was virtually no difference in fibrotic response
between these two mouse strains upon assessment by histology or
quantitative fibrosis measures (Fig. 4). Importantly, we were able
to reproduce these results when chronic MΦ depletion was performed concurrently with chronic TAA administration for
6 weeks. Resistance to fibrosis was compromised in FVB mice
receiving weekly CLO injections, which developed significant
hepatic fibrosis, as evidenced by increase in collagen deposition,
histological signs of bridging fibrosis, and increase in HSC activation marker α-SMA, compared to controls treated with TAA
and vehicle [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]-loaded liposomes
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Since both resident macrophage and
infiltrating Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) myeloid cells appeared to accumulate within post-necrotic lesions (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3),
we also performed myeloid cell subset depletions using lineagespecific antibody during recovery of resistant FVB mice from
TAA injury (Fig. 4a). Cell depletion using Gr-1 (but not CD11b
or Ly-6G)-specific antibody resulted in persistence of dead
hepatocyte at day 8 post injury, and compromised fibrosis
resistance in FVB mice (Fig. 4e). Of note, administration of Gr-1
(but not CD11b or Ly-6G)-specific mAB led to HSC activation on
day 8 post TAA (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and increased hepatic
collagen deposition as determined biochemically via hydroxyproline (Supplementary Fig. 6b). These data collectively suggest
that both resident liver macrophages [Kupffer cells (KCs)] and
infiltrating Gr-1(+) myeloid cell subset are functionally required
for efficient clearance of dead hepatocytes, and appear to protect
from ensuing fibrotic responses.
Hepatocyte-derived mito-DAMPs compromise fibrosis resistance. The results described above suggested to us that prolonged
exposure to the certain DAMPs released from persisting dead
hepatocytes in fibrosis-susceptible strain (or when MΦ function is
compromised in resistant FVB mice) may be directly responsible
for triggering exaggerated fibrotic responses. One such group of
molecules leaking from damaged mitochondria (collectively
called mito-DAMPs) is particularly immunogenic and has been
implicated in various diseases8. Indeed, we detected transient
3-fold elevation in serum levels of mtDNA (a marker of mitoDAMPs release) 2 days post-TAA injury in fibrosis-susceptible
BALB/c mice, but not in resistant FVB mice (Fig. 5a). Importantly, this was not due to strain differences in mtDNA genome
copy number, which was similar in FVB and BALB/c livers
relative to nuclear genome (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e). To test if
mito-DAMPs were directly pro-fibrogenic, we purified liver
mitochondria, prepared mito-DAMPs from them, and injected
them into resistant FVB mice on the second and fourth day postTAA injury to mimic prolonged exposure to mito-DAMPs due to
inefficient efferocytosis of damaged hepatocyte in vivo (Fig. 5b).
The mito-DAMP dose chosen contained 9.5 μg of mtDNA, which
corresponds to 10% of the whole liver and in all likelihood reflects

pathophysiologic levels based on 40–50% hepatocyte death
observed in response to TAA in our system and kinetics of systemic exogenous mito-DAMPs exposure in vivo (Supplementary
Fig. 7c). While control FVB mice, as expected, were able to repair
the liver injury in a scarless manner by day 8 post injury, FVB
mice injected with mito-DAMPs developed significant liver
fibrosis, with readily detectable collagen deposits, morphologically
characterized as incomplete fibrotic septa (Fig. 5c). Quantitatively, the overall increase in collagen deposition in mice injected
with mito-DAMPs was significant, with a 2.5-fold increase as
determined via connective tissue square morphometry, and a
27.45% increase as determined via biochemical hydroxyproline
assay, respectively (p < 0.05, Fig. 5d, e). Areas of collagen
deposition in livers of mito-DAMP-treated mice overlapped with
a massive increase in immunopositivity for α-SMA, an HSC
activation marker. Moreover, pro-fibrogenic gene transcript levels
of TGFβ1, pro-collagen α1(I), and TIMP-1 in livers of mitoDAMP-treated mice remained elevated 3–4-folds at day 8 post
injury (Fig. 5f). In order to validate these findings in a second,
mechanistically different model of steatohepatitis, we injected
mice primed with short-term methionine- and choline-deficient
diet (MCD) feeding (2 weeks) with a single dose of purified mitoDAMPs (9.5 μg/mouse, i.p.) and examined the livers 24 h later;
in situ immunostaining for α-SMA revealed massive activation of

peri-sinusoidal HSCs throughout the liver lobule, with a 2.6-fold
increase in α-SMA area morphometrically (Fig. 5g).
Mito-DAMPs directly trigger pro-fibrogenic HSC activation. In
order to investigate whether pro-fibrotic action of mito-DAMPs
may be due to direct effect on HSCs, a main fibrogenic effector
cell in the liver, we freshly isolated HSCs and incubated them
with increasing concentrations of mito-DAMPs (0.25, 0.5, and
0.75 μg/ml) in vitro. Twenty four hours after the addition of mitoDAMPs, HSCs demonstrated dose-dependent changes in morphology characteristic of their activation, with the loss of lipid
droplets, assumption of an MF-like appearance, and robust
increases in immunopositivity for α-SMA (Fig. 6a). HSC proliferation, as assessed by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-
diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] assay, was dose-dependently
increased in the presence of exogenously added mito-DAMPs
(Fig. 6b). Concomitantly, primary HSCs upregulated profibrogenic gene expression of pro-collagen α1(I), TGFβ1, and
TIMP-1 (2–4-folds over controls, Fig. 6c). Pre-incubation of
mito-DAMPs with DNase I immediately prior to the addition to
HSC cultures efficiently depleted mtDNA and significantly attenuated its pro-fibrogenic activity by up to 50% compared to intact
mito-DAMP preparations, as assessed via cell proliferation, αSMA induction, and fibrogenic gene expression (Fig. 6d–h).
Interestingly, primary resident liver macrophages (Kupffer) cells
failed to respond to equivalent doses of mito-DAMPs in vitro,
both at baseline and upon activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
or interferon-γ (IFNγ), as measured by secretion of tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), or nitric oxide
(NO) (Supplementary Fig. 8). Taken together, these results
suggest that exposure to exogenous mito-DAMPs directly triggers
fibrogenic activation in HSCs, with mtDNA as a major active
component, as evidenced by characteristic changes in morphology, up-regulation of α-SMA, increased cell proliferation, and
pro-fibrogenic transcriptional activity.
Circulating mito-DAMPs are elevated in human NAFLD/
NASH. In order to test if circulating mito-DAMPs levels are
increased in human disease, we performed a survey of mtDNA
levels in the serum of 27 patients (cohort I) with biopsyconfirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via PCR
amplification of a short fragment in the D-loop region of
mtDNA. The majority of patients (20/27) in this cohort had
active NASH, defined histopathologically as NAFLD activity
score (NAS) ≥ 4, and various degrees of fibrosis ranging from F0
(no fibrosis) to F4 (cirrhosis). Twelve healthy controls of different
ages (24–63 years old) were analyzed for comparison (Table 1).
Serum mtDNA levels were increased 7-fold on average in NAFLD
patients with different stages of disease when compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.0001), with mtDNA levels reaching up to a 17-
fold increase above average normal values (Fig. 7a). Circulating
mtDNA values in healthy subjects did not appear to vary with age
or sex. Association with histological parameters of disease progression (NAS score and fibrosis stage on liver biopsy) was tested
in an additional 114 patients with NAFLD/NASH (cohort II).
Circulating mtDNA levels were further increased in patients with
active NASH (NAS score 4–8, versus minimal disease activity
NAS score 0–3, p = 0.0334, Fig. 7b) and particularly in those with
the significant histological signs of fibrosis [F2–4, 482.4 ± 62.66,
95% confidence interval (CI), 356.2–608.6] on biopsy, compared
to patients with minimal/no fibrosis (F0–1, 253.4 ± 26.45, 95% CI,
200.6–306.2, p = 0.0003, Fig. 7c).
Discussion
It is well recognized that individuals with chronic liver disease
exhibit profound differences in fibrosis progression rates. This
poorly understood clinical phenomenon can be replicated in
genetically divergent inbred mouse strains that demonstrate
various degrees of susceptibility to experimental liver fibrosis.
Studies in inbred mice may potentially provide valuable
mechanistic insights into fibrosis susceptibility in humans, and
help to devise new antifibrotic therapies or identify patients at
high risk of progression.

liver injury. a Scheme of phagocytic macrophage depletion experiment where single injection of clodronate liposomes was performed either (1) 24 h prior
(CLO-TAA) or (2) 24 h after (TAA-CLO) TAA administration, and (3) myeloid cell subsets depletion via administration of Gr-1, CD11b, or Ly-6G-specific
mAB on first, third, and fifth day post TAA. All mice were sacrificed and evaluated at day 8 post TAA. b Connective tissue staining demonstrates significant
pericentral deposition of collagen in FVB mice with macrophage depletion, virtually indistinguishable from lesions in BALB/c. No collagen deposition occurs
in FVB mice without macrophage depletion (×50; bar, 100 μm). c Collagen deposition in livers of FVB and BALB/c mice with macrophage depletion before
or after liver insult (for Ctrl/TAA/CLO + TAA/TAA + CLO groups, n = 4/11/4/7 (BALB/c), n = 4/7/7/8 (FVB) of individual animals). Macrophage
depletion (before or after injury) abrogates fibrosis resistance in FVB mice, while having a minor effect on collagen levels in fibrosis-susceptible BALB/c
mice. d Pro-fibrogenic gene expression in post-TAA livers demonstrates that fibrogenic responses are amplified and persist longer in FVB mice treated with
CLO, similarly to levels observed in fibrosis-susceptible BALB/c. Hepatic expression of pro-fibrogenic (TGFβ1, pro-collagen α1(I), and TIMP-1) transcript
levels was quantified by QRT-PCR 8 days after single TAA injury. Results are expressed as means ± SEM, and in arbitrary units (fold to healthy wild-type
controls) relative to β2MG mRNA as described in “Methods.” e Fibrosis-resistant FVB mice were administered cell subset-specific antibody to deplete
myeloid cells (Gr-1 mAB RB6-8C5, 200 μg/mouse), monocytes (CD11b mAB M1/70, 200 μg/mouse), isotype control (Iso, LTF-2 IgG2b, 200 μg/mouse),
or granulocytes/neutrophils (Ly-6G mAB 1A8, 500 μg/mouse) on first, third, and fifth day after TAA injections (for Ctrl/TAA/CLO + TAA/TAA + CLO
groups, n = 8/6/5/7 (BALB/c) and n = 9/6/5/8 (FVB) of individual animals). Representative low-magnification (×50; bar, 100 μm)) images show serial

Here, we investigated in detail the fibrotic response in inbred
strains in response to hepatotoxin TAA-induced liver injury.
Similar to previous chronic liver injury studies2,3,16, BALB/c was
most fibrosis-susceptible strain in our system, C57Bl/6 developed
intermediate degree of fibrosis, and FVB mice were fibrosisresistant (Supplementary Fig. 1). Careful analysis revealed that
such strain-specific fibrotic responses can be detected using
objective quantitative biochemical and histological methods
5–8 days after merely one sub-lethal TAA insult (Fig. 1). Strain
differences were not unique to TAA toxicity, because another
hepatotoxin, CCl4, resulted in essentially identical phenotype
(Supplementary Fig. 2). While results obtained in this experimental system, representing extreme fibrosis phenotypes in FVB
and BALB/c mice, cannot be directly extrapolated to human
population, we felt such robust and malleable model may allow
elucidation of fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms
that would otherwise be challenging to pinpoint in genetically and
environmentally complex human disease condition with frequent
co-morbidities.
Indeed, longitudinal analysis of responses to acute liver injury
in these strains has been revealing. TAA caused death in 40–50%
of pericentral hepatocytes, with very similar cumulative liver
injury in both resistant and susceptibly strains as assessed via area
under the curve (AUC) of serum ALT levels (Fig. 2). Likewise,
both strains were able to mount robust, but nearly identical early
transcriptional activation of fibrosis-related genes at day 3.
However, in late recovery stages (between days 5 and 8), strain
differences became apparent: key pro-fibrogenic mRNAs encoding TGFβ1, collagen α1(I), TIMP-1, and MMP-2 normalized in
FVB, but persisted at elevated levels in BALB/c (Fig. 2c). This was
preceded by remarkable delay in macrophage-mediated clearance
of necrotic hepatocytes due to impaired macrophage efferocytosis
function in susceptible BALB/c mice (Fig. 3), release of mitoDAMPs (Fig. 5a), and subsequent activation of HSCs adjacent to
the areas of incomplete efferocytosis (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, it is not
the magnitude of early fibrogenic response, but the rapidity and
completeness of repair that is a central characteristic of scarless
recovery, with efficient phagocytic clearance of dead hepatocytes
being the major determinant in our system.
Although phagocytic function of macrophages was not systematically studied in human liver disease, isolated reports have
found evidence of impaired macrophage phagocytosis in cirrhotic
patients with ascites17,18. Using an experimental model of surgical
recovery from bile duct ligation-induced fibrosis in rats, we have
previously observed that phagocytic macrophages promote (biliary) fibrosis reversal via the release of pro-fibrolytic MMPs upon
engulfment of apoptotic cholangiocytes19. Earlier in vitro studies
reported that HSC line LX-1 is able to engulf apoptotic bodies of
hepatocytes, which induced pro-fibrogenic activation in vitro via
a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase20 and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinasedependent manner21. Many cell types are indeed capable of
slowly engulfing the injured/dead cell in their close proximity22.
However, while apoptotic cell engulfment by stellate cells was
definitively demonstrated to occur in vivo20, macrophages are
dramatically more efficient at efferocytosis than any other stromal
cells. When considering their unique ability to actively sense and
find dead cells, it is likely that in the physiological in vivo setting,
resident and infiltrating monocyte/macrophages easily outcompete HSCs in clearing dead hepatocytes.
The central role of macrophages in regulating liver fibrosis is
now well recognized11,23. It is also complex and often paradoxical, since genetic depletion of the same CD11b(+) macrophage subset had opposite effects on fibrosis when performed
during chronic liver injury or the recovery phase15. Recent liver
fibrosis research focused mainly on infiltrating monocyte/macrophages recruited to the liver from bone marrow, with some of
specific subsets identified as functionally promoting fibrosis
progression (CD11b(+)F4/80(+)Gr-1(+))24 or reversal (CD11b
(hi)F4/80(int)Ly-6C(lo))25. Interestingly, pro-resolution infiltrating CD11b(hi)F4/80(int)Ly-6C(lo) MΦ subset demonstrate a
post-phagocytic phenotype, which was further enhanced by the
administration of non-loaded liposomes in vivo25. Although the
phagocytic function was not specifically assessed in these studies,
it can be speculated that divergent regulation of phagocytic ability
monocytes/macrophages during inflammation and repair may
explain opposite MΦ roles15. Here, via several experimental
approaches we demonstrate that efficient phagocytic function of
resident macrophages and Gr-1+ myeloid is critical to fibrosis
resistance in FVB mice, while defective efferocytosis macrophage
function in BALB/c (or when phagocytes are depleted in FVB)
leads to persistence of dead hepatocytes and exaggerated fibrotic
responses (Figs. 2–4). Remarkably, fibrosis-resistant FVB strain
that clears dead hepatocytes efficiently can be rendered equally
fibrosis-susceptible as BALB/c via selective depletion of resident
and infiltrating macrophages based on their phagocytic ability
using either CLOs, or by depletion of an infiltrating myeloid cells
using anti-Gr-1 antibody (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, and contrary to
prior report on genetic CD11b+ cell deletion in CCl4-induced
liver fibrosis in mice15, antibody depletion of CD11b(+) cells had

no direct effect on dead hepatocyte clearance and ensuing fibrotic
response in our system (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 6). This may
suggest that pro-fibrogenic role of infiltrating CD11b+ monocytes pool might be indirect and determined by their wellestablished pro-inflammatory function26. Because efferocytosis is
highly redundant both in terms of capable cell types and molecular machinery of engulfing dead cells27, another possible
explanation is that antibody recognizing more broadly expressed
Gr-1 (Ly-6G/Ly-6C, compared to CD11b) massively depleted
phagocytes, which could not be fully compensated by resident
macrophages or Gr-1(−) subsets. Alternative possibility, although
less likely, is the existence of minor Gr(+)CD11b(−)Ly-6G(−)
subset with critical phagocytic activity; detailed follow-up study is
warranted to address this question. Importantly, repeated CLOmediated phagocytes depletion performed concurrently with
chronic TAA administration resulted in significant fibrosis in
(normally resistant) FVB mice, suggesting that the same
mechanism applies in the clinically relevant settings of chronic
liver disease (Supplementary Fig. 5).
The striking association of fibrotic responses with delayed
clearance and thus persistence of dead hepatocytes (Figs. 1 and 2),
as well as HSC accumulation and collagen deposition within these
areas of “failed” efferocytosis (Fig. 3), led us to hypothesize that
intracellular contents leaking from hepatocytes are directly
responsible for triggering fibrotic response. Indeed, the role of
DAMPs released from damaged hepatocytes in initiating or
amplifying an inflammatory response, analogous to pathogenassociated molecular patterns of infectious pathogens in sterile
liver injury, is now well recognized28. Mitochondria-derived
DAMPs (mito-DAMPs), which are particularly immunogenic due
to structural similarities to bacteria, have attracted attention
recently8. In an extreme example such as massive trauma, mitoDAMPs, identified as mtDNA and formyl peptides, are acutely
released from damaged tissues and cause a sepsis-like systemic
inflammatory response syndrome by activating polymorphonuclear cells via TLR9 and formyl peptide receptor-129. In the
liver, where hepatocytes are extremely rich in the mitochondria,
mtDNA was shown to be released into circulation and to promote
inflammation in NASH through TLR9 ligation30 and exacerbate
ischemia–reperfusion injury31. However, whether mito-DAMPs
can directly trigger fibrotic response was not investigated until
now. In our system, mito-DAMPs release into circulation (measured via serum mtDNA levels) was evident on day 2 post injury
only in susceptible BALB/c strain (Fig. 5a), coinciding with failure
to upregulate several key phagocytosis molecules, diminished
efferocytosis (Fig. 3), and delayed dead hepatocyte removal
(Fig. 2). In order to test whether mito-DAMPs are indeed the
culprit, we purified crude soluble mito-DAMPs from liver mitochondria and administered mito-DAMPs into resistant FVB mice
during recovery from TAA to mimic prolonged exposure to dead
cell content/mito-DAMPs in BALB/c strain. This resulted in
remarkable activation of HSCs, up-regulation of pro-fibrotic
transcripts, and fibrotic scar formation by day 8 of recovery,
effectively abrogating fibrosis resistance in FVB mice (Fig. 5).
Importantly, we were able to confirm robust HSC activation in
response to a single administration of exogenous mito-DAMPs in
a mechanistically different model of early-stage MCD-induced
steatohepatitis in C57Bl/6 mice (Fig. 5g). Because mito-DAMPs
were able to dose-dependently activate freshly isolated HSCs
in vitro (Fig. 6), this appears to be a direct, primary effect on
fibrogenic effector cells (as opposed to secondary, e.g. due to
immune cells activation). Importantly, we identified mtDNA as a
major active moiety within mito-DAMPs, accounting for about
half of their fibrogenic activity (Fig. 6d–h). Future studies should
elucidate the molecular sensors mediating such effects of mtDNA,
as well as the contribution and potential synergies of other
components of the mitochondria. Resident liver macrophages
regulate fibrotic response and clear dead hepatocytes (Fig. 4), and
are presumably exposed to high levels of mito-DAMPs in liver
disease. However, our in vitro data show that unlike HSCs, primary KCs do not respond to equivalent doses of mito-DAMPs in
classical activation assays; moreover, their activation by IFNγ or
LPS was not modulated in the presence of mito-DAMPs (Supplementary Fig. 8). This is potentially due to naturally high
exposure (and relative tolerance) of resident liver macrophages to
gut-derived bacterial products, which bear structural resemblance
to mito-DAMPs. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that mito-DAMPs can directly activate myofibroblastic cells
and trigger pro-fibrogenic response independently of their wellcharacterized pro-inflammatory action.
Importantly, we demonstrate that in human chronic liver
disease, mito-DAMPs can escape from local hepatic microenvironment into circulation. mtDNA, a biologically active
component of mito-DAMPs (Fig. 6d–h), is detected at very low
levels in healthy subjects, but is dramatically elevated in the serum
of human NAFLD/NASH patients (Fig. 7a), supporting the
relevance of proposed mito-DAMPs pathway in driving human
hepatic fibrosis. Furthermore, mtDNA levels are further increased
in patients with active NASH (NAS 4–8 versus NAS 0–3, p =
0.0334) and demonstrate stronger association with significant
(F2–4) versus minimal/no fibrosis (F0–1, p = 0.0003) on liver
biopsy (Fig. 7b, c). These findings have immediate translational
implications as novel disease biomarker; the diagnostic potential
of circulating mtDNA species to identify patients at risk of rapid
progression to cirrhosis should be also evaluated in prospective
sequential liver biopsies studies.
Our results indicate that efferocytosis is a fundamental
mechanism guarding the liver from excessive fibrotic response to
toxic insults by limiting exposure to mito-DAMPs, with intriguing, previously unrecognized therapeutic implications. However, clearance of dying cells is a highly complex and orchestrated
process involving interactions between multiple ligands on dying
cells, bridging molecules, and receptors on phagocytes with a high
degree of redundancy32. Comprehensive profiling of 84 known
phagocytosis genes 48 h after liver injury (coinciding with systemic release of mito-DAMPs, Fig. 5a) revealed inefficient activation of specific set of genes governing multiple steps in the
phagocytic pathway (Fig. 3c, d). Some of these genes have been
previously implicated in liver fibrosis (Serpine133, Tgm234), while
role of others (Cd14, Marco, Csf1) have not been investigated to
date. Identification of such candidate genes is critical to begin
elucidation of underlying molecular phagocytosis pathways both
in mouse and human species. Demonstration of the crucial role of
efferocytosis, identification of effector cell subset(s), and phagocytic genes (Figs. 2–4) in our report pave the way for such studies.
Conceptually, results of our study support the idea that
excessive fibrotic response is a direct result of a “failed” resolution
of sterile inflammation35, with impaired phagocytosis of injured
hepatocytes enabling exposure of quiescent stellate cells to
fibrogenic mito-DAMPs. Robust phagocytic genes activation,
followed by rapid efferocytosis of injured hepatocytes and MΦ
departure (as observed in resistant FVB mouse) terminate fibrotic
response early and result in scarless repair. Conversely, activation
of multiple phagocytic genes is impaired in susceptible BALB/c
strain (or when phagocytes are depleted), which result in inefficient dead hepatocyte clearance, fibrogenic mito-DAMPs leak
into extracellular space, which trigger HSC activation and scar
formation (Supplementary Fig. 9). It is possible that alternative
mechanisms, such as epigenetic, microbiota, intestinal epithelial
integrity, or portal endotoxin levels may also contribute to susceptibility to liver fibrosis in mice and humans. However, the
extent to which fibrosis resistance is compromised either by

phagocyte depletion (Fig. 4) or circumventing phagocytic clearance by exogenous mito-DAMPs administration (Fig. 5), together
with increased mito-DAMPs levels in human fibrotic NASH
(Fig. 7), strongly suggests that mito-DAMPs released from
hepatocyte escaping phagocytic clearance play a major, previously
unrecognized role in liver fibrosis.
Together, these results provide a new mechanistic insight into
the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, and offer a conceptual framework for future studies into molecular mechanisms mediating
susceptibility to liver fibrosis. Based on our results, circulating
levels of mito-DAMPs species can be leveraged as biomarkers of
progressive disease in human NAFLD. Finally, therapeutic targeting of mito-DAMPs release or modulation of phagocytosis
may serve as a promising approach to treat liver fibrosis.
Methods
Animal experiments. Male 6–7-week-old FVB/NJ (stock #001800), C57BL/6J
(#000644) inbred mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME); male
6–7-week-old BALB/c (stock #028) mice were obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). All mice were acclimatized for 1 week before experiments and
housed on a 12 h dark and light cycle at 18–22 °C with 40–60% humidity, and fed a
standard rodent chow and tap water ad libitum. Animal experiments had been
reviewed and approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocols #158-2008, #004-2012, and
#010-2015).
Chronic model of TAA-induced liver fibrosis was induced in 7–8-week-old male
mice by repetitive injections of TAA. Briefly, fibrosis was induced by chronic i.p.
TAA injection for 6 weeks (first dose—100 mg/kg, all subsequent doses 200 mg/kg
three times a week). Mice were sacrificed always 3 days after the last TAA
administration, unless specified otherwise.
Model of recovery from a single sub-lethal dose of TAA was established in pilot
experiments in each strain. Half of the dose that caused ~50% mortality in FVB/NJ
(100 mg/kg of TAA in PBS) was chosen and injected i.p. once in all subsequent
experiments and recovering mice sacrificed 1–8 days post injury. In selected
experiments, sub-lethal liver injury was induced by a single injection of another
hepatotoxin, CCl4 (0.8 mg/kg, dissolved in mineral oil via oral gavage).
Steatohepatitis model was induced by feeding MCD for 2 weeks in male 8-weekold C57Bl6/J mice (Jackson Labs), which results in early steatohepatitis without
fibrosis or significant HSC activation36.
Macrophage and myeloid cell subsets depletion in vivo. Selective macrophage
depletion was achieved with a single i.p. injection of CLOs (10 μl/g of body weight,
https://clodronateliposomes.com/). This method of macrophage depletion was
chosen based on its unique ability to target macrophages based on their phagocytic
activity37, as opposed to their genetic “lineage” depletion15. Efficiency of liver
macrophage depletion was confirmed by almost complete disappearance of F4/80+
hepatic macrophages as assessed by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 4).
CLO-mediated depletion of phagocytic macrophages was performed in two regimens: to deplete resident hepatic macrophages (KCs), CLO was administered 24 h
prior to TAA injection; depletion of both resident and infiltrating monocytes/
macrophages was achieved by CLO injection 24 h after TAA injury. In selected
experiments, chronic macrophage depletion was performed by weekly injection of
CLO (10 μl/g of body weight) during progression of chronic TAA-induced fibrosis
(induced as described above). Liposomes loaded with PBS served as controls, unless
otherwise stated. Monoclonal antibody-mediated depletions of myeloid cell subsets
were performed according to published protocols using Gr-1 mAB (RB6-8C5,
200 μg/mouse), CD11b mAB (M1/70, 200 μg/mouse)38, Ly-6G mAB (1A8, 500 μg/
mouse)39, or isotype control (LTF-2 IgG2b, 200 μg/mouse) (all from BioXcell, Inc.)
administered intraperitoneally at 1, 3, and 5 days post TAA in FVB mice.
In vivo phagocytosis assay. Fluorescently labeled apoptotic thymocytes were
prepared as described40. Briefly, thymocytes were isolated by mechanical dissociation of thymi from 3- to 4-week-old, male recipient strain-matched mice,
labeled with Cell Tracker™ Green CMFDA Dye (Thermo Fisher, #C7025) according
to the manufacturer’s manual, washed, and apoptosis induced by incubation with
1 μM dexamethasone for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Apoptosis was confirmed by
annexin V binding and morphological changes (nuclear fragmentation/condensation, membrane blebbing) and was routinely observed in ∼50% cells (<30% viable
cells as assessed by propidium iodide exclusion). A total of 2 × 106 apoptotic
thymocytes were injected into the tail vein of strain-matched recipient mouse
(either healthy controls or 48 h post-TAA-induced liver injury), which were
euthanized 1 h later. Engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes (green) was analyzed in
snap-frozen, acetone-fixed liver sections immunofluorescence stained for F4/80 or
Gr-1 (red)41. Ten randomly chosen high-power fields at ×200 magnification per
animal were assessed.
Phagocytosis gene array. Total liver RNA was extracted using the RNEasy minicolumns (Qiagen). Complementary DNA was prepared from 0.5 mg of RNA using
the RT2 first-strand kit and quantitative PCR for 84 phagocytosis-related genes was
then performed using the RT2 Profiler mouse phagocytosis PCR array (PAMM173ZA-24, Qiagen) on ABI7000 qPCR instrument according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The data obtained were exported to the Qiagen’s GeneGlobe Data
Analysis Center software-based tool where it was normalized to β-2 microglobulin
(β2MG) gene and analyzed using the ΔΔCt method according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Mito-DAMPs preparation, characterization, and administration. Liver mitochondria were isolated and purified from 6- to 8-week-old FVB mice according to a
standard method of differential centrifugation in a sucrose gradient as described42.
To prepare soluble mito-DAMPs, mitochondrial pellets were re-suspended in
20 mM PBS (274 mM NaCl, 20 mM PO4
3−, 5.4 mM KCl; pH 7.4) and incubated
on ice for 15 min, followed by 10 cycles of freezing–thawing (freezing in liquid
nitrogen for 30 s/thawing at 20 °C for 1 min). Supernatant (mito-DAMPs) was
collected after centrifugation at 15000 × g for 10 min and characterized by mtDNA
content, purity and integrity, and total protein content. Purity and integrity of
mtDNA was assessed by the percent of total DNA found in 16 Kbp band via
automated microgel electrophoresis (Agilent 4200 TapeStation). Potential contamination with nuclear DNA was controlled by TaqMan RT-PCR quantification
of genomic (nuclear) reference region within β2MG in parallel with mitochondrial
12S and 16S regions, and was routinely found to be below 1%. Protein content was
determined by the Bradford assay (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). In all experiments,
mito-DAMP preparations were standardized by intact mtDNA concentration as
determined by automated DNA microgel densitometry on Agilent 2200 TapeStation system. Mito-DAMP preparations with mtDNA integrity of >95% were
diluted at 0.1 μg mtDNA/μl concentration and stored at −80 °C until the experiment. In vivo, mito-DAMPs (at the dose of 9.5 μg mtDNA/mouse, which corresponds to 10% of the liver) were injected intraperitoneally twice, on the second and
fourth day of recovery after acute TAA injury in mice. Dosage and i.p. route of
administration was chosen based on mito-DAMP’s stability and favorable systemic
exposure mimicking physiologic mito-DAMP levels (Supplementary Fig. 7) In
vitro, freshly isolated HSCs were treated on day 2 with mito-DAMPs at increasing
doses (corresponding to mtDNA content of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 μg/ml) and their
activation state analyzed 24 h later. mtDNA depletion was performed by preincubation of mito-DAMP preparations with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (1 U DNase/
1 μg mtDNA, Promega, cat. # M610A) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to addition to cells.
Primary non-parenchymal liver cell isolation. Primary HSCs were isolated from
fibrotic Mdr2−/− mice and cultured on plastic43. Briefly, after in situ perfusion of
the liver with pronase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), followed by collagenase (Roche),
dispersed cell suspensions were layered on a discontinuous density gradient of 29%
Nycodenz (Sigma). HSCs were collected from the gradient interface, and cell viability was verified by phase-contrast microscopy as well as the ability to exclude
trypan blue. The viability of all cell cultures used for the studies was >95%. Primary
KCs were isolated similarly to HSCs, except for gradient centrifugation, which was
performed as described44 with modifications. Briefly, non-parenchymal cell pellets
were re-suspended and centrifuged on a density cushion of Percoll (25 and 50%).
Cell fraction enriched in KCa located between 25% and 50% Percoll was collected
and seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 106/well. After 20 min incubation,
non-adherent cells were removed. Cell purity was assessed by latex bead uptake.
Cell preparations with purity and viability over 95% were used for further studies.
Activation assays were performed 24 h after isolation in the presence of 10 µg/ml
LPS (R&D), 100 U/ml IFNγ (R&D), or mito-DAMPs (corresponding to 2.5–7.5 μg
of mtDNA/ml) for 24 hs, using IL-1, TNF-α (ELISA, R&D) and NO secretion
(colorimetric assay, Thermo Fisher Scientific) into cell supernatant as read-outs.
Hepatic hydroxyproline determination. Hepatic collagen content was determined
as relative hydroxyproline (µg/g liver) in 250–300 mg liver samples from two
different lobes (representing >10% of whole liver) after hydrolysis in 6 N HCl
for 16 h at 110 °C using colorimetric Cholamine-T/p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde
method45. Total hydroxyproline (mg/whole liver) was calculated based on individual liver weights and the corresponding relative hydroxyproline content19,46.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Liver tissue (250–300 mg) from two lobes was
homogenized and total RNA was extracted using RNAPure (PeqLab, Erlangen,
Germany), and 1 µg of total RNA reverse transcribed46,47. Relative transcript levels
were quantified by real-time RT-PCR on a LightCycler 1.5 instrument (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) using the TaqMan methodology. TaqMan probes (duallabeled with 5′-FAM and 3′-TAMRA) and primers (summarized in Supplementary
Table 1) were designed using the commercial Primer Express software version 3.0
(Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, USA), synthesized at Eurofins (Louisville, KY), and
validated previously46,47. The housekeeping gene β2MG was amplified in parallel
reactions for normalization.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Indirect immunofluorescence
was performed in frozen acetone-fixed sections, and immunohistochemistry for αNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16092-0 ARTICLE

SMA on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver sections were performed according to routine protocols48. All primary antibodies used are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Hematoxylin–eosin and Sirius Red staining was performed
using standardized clinical pathology protocols at Histology Core (BIDMC).
Serum biochemistry. Serum levels of ALT were measured using Catalyst Dx®
Chemistry Analyzer (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations.
MTT proliferation assay. Cell proliferation was measured by a MTT assay
(ATCC). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well in 96-well culture
plates. After treatment, MTT solution was added to the culture medium (0.5 mmol/l)
and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Detergent solution was then added to
solubilize formazan crystals. Optical density was determined at 540 nm using a
Benchmark Plus microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA).
Human samples. De-identified serum samples from healthy subjects (n = 12) were
procured from human samples repository (Innovative Research, Novi, MI). Deidentified serum samples from adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with NAFLD were
obtained from a prospective NAFLD patient registry and BioBank at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). All patients had biopsy-proven NAFLD
without other chronic liver diseases or significant alcohol consumption (patients
with >20 g alcohol daily were excluded from the registry). The study was reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center and informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Serum
mtDNA levels were analyzed in total DNA isolated from 25 to 50 μl serum (Gentra
Puregene kit, Qiagen) by quantitative TaqMan PCR amplification of D-loop region
within mtDNA genome in pilot (cohort I, n = 27) and validation cohort (cohort II,
n = 114) in relation to histological disease activity and fibrosis. External intact
mtDNA standards isolated from human HepG2 hepatoma cells’ mitochondria
were used to calculate target’s copy number. All biopsies were scored according to
Kleiner and Brunt et al.49 and steatohepatitis activity was defined by NAS score as
no/minimal (NAS 0–3) or active NASH (NAS 4–8), whereas fibrosis was defined as
no/minimal (F0–1) or significant (F2–4). Demographic and clinical characteristics
are summarized in Table 1.
Statistical analyses. Data are expressed as means ± SEM, and statistical analyses
were performed using Microsoft Excel Office 365 and GraphPad Prism version
8.4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Student’s t test was performed for twogroup comparisons. Multiple comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA
(analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post test) and S. Two-tailed
p values < 0.05 were considered significant and are reported in the graphs.
