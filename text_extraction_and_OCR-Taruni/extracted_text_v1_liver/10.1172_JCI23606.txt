Diabetes mellitus is a major health concern, affecting more than 5% of the population. Here we describe a 
potential novel therapeutic agent for this disease, FGF-21, which was discovered to be a potent regulator of glucose uptake in mouse 3T3-L1 and primary human adipocytes. FGF-21–transgenic mice were viable and resistant to diet-induced obesity. Therapeutic administration of FGF-21 reduced plasma glucose and triglycerides 
to near normal levels in both ob/ob and db/db mice. These effects persisted for at least 24 hours following 
the cessation of FGF-21 administration. Importantly, FGF-21 did not induce mitogenicity, hypoglycemia, or 
weight gain at any dose tested in diabetic or healthy animals or when overexpressed in transgenic mice. Thus, 
we conclude that FGF-21, which we have identified as a novel metabolic factor, exhibits the therapeutic characteristics necessary for an effective treatment of diabetes.
Introduction
While the majority of the 22 known members of FGF family have 
been primarily associated with mitosis, development, transformation, angiogenesis, and survival (1–5), recent data shows that they 
may play important roles in defining and regulating functions of 
some endocrine-relevant tissues and organs, as well as modulating 
various metabolic processes. For example, FGF-10 is implicated in 
the differentiation processes in white adipose tissue (6) and pancreas 
(7, 8), while FGF-16 (9) is considered to be a specific factor for brown 
adipocytes. Another recently characterized molecule, FGF-19 (10, 11), 
has been shown to cause resistance to diet-induced obesity and 
insulin desensitization and to improve insulin, glucose, and lipid 
profiles in diabetic rodents. Since these effects, at least in part, are 
mediated through the observed changes in metabolic rates, FGF-19 
can be considered as a regulator of energy expenditure (12, 13).
FGFs modulate cellular activity via at least 5 distinct subfamilies of high-affinity FGF receptors (FGFRs): FGFR-1, -2, -3, and -4, 
all with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and, except for FGFR-4, 
multiple splice isoforms (1–3); and FGFR-5 (14, 15), which lacks an 
intracellular kinase domain. There is growing evidence that FGFRs 
can be important for regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis. 
The overexpression of a dominant negative form of FGFR-1 in β
cells leads to diabetes in mice, which thus implies that proper FGF 
signaling is required for normal β cell function and glycemia maintenance (16). FGFR-2 appears to be a key molecule during pancreatic development (17–19). Moreover, FGFR-4 has been implicated 
in cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis (20).
FGF-21 (21) is a novel member of FGF family. It is preferentially 
expressed in liver, but an exact knowledge of FGF-21 bioactivity 
and its mode of action have been lacking to date. Here we show 
that FGF-21 is a potent activator of glucose uptake on adipocytes, 
protects animals from diet-induced obesity when overexpressed in 
transgenic mice, and lowers blood glucose and triglyceride levels 
when therapeutically administered to diabetic rodents. Thus, we 
believe our report to be the first to document a clear biological 
function of this protein and its potential therapeutic application.
Results
Identification of FGF-21 in vitro bioactivity. Using a glucose uptake assay 
to search for novel proteins with therapeutic potential to treat diabetes mellitus, we found that human recombinant FGF-21 stimulated 
glucose incorporation in differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 
as well as in human primary adipocytes after 24-hour treatment 
of the cells with the protein (Figure 1, A and B). Since FGF-21 did 
not induce glucose uptake in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, 
human primary preadipocytes, muscle L6–glucose transporter–
4myc (L6-GLUT-4myc) myoblasts and myotubes (22), or liver clone 
9 cells, the FGF-21 effect appeared to be adipocyte specific.
The effects of FGF-21 on glucose uptake in adipocytes were insulin independent, additive to the activity of insulin upon cotreatment (Figure 1C), and not modulated by addition of exogenous 
heparin. In contrast to the rapid response elicited by insulin, the 
predominant effect of FGF-21 on glucose uptake required at least 4 
hours of cell treatment, and it was substantially diminished in the 
presence of cycloheximide (1 μg/ml), a protein synthesis inhibitor 
(23) (Figure 1D). These observations led us to hypothesize that the 
mode of action for FGF-21 requires transcriptional activation.
To identify a potential mechanism at the molecular level by which 
FGF-21 increases glucose uptake, we examined whether it modulates 
the expression levels of the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 
in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. FGF-21 treatment (1 μg/ml) led to a significant increase in GLUT1 mRNA and protein but not those of GLUT4 
(Figure 1, E and F). FGF-21–dependent GLUT1 upregulation was further demonstrated in vivo following a bolus injection in ob/ob mice. 
Four hours after s.c. administration of FGF-21 (500 μg/animal), an 
increase in GLUT1 mRNA was specifically detected in white adipose 
tissue but not in muscle, liver, kidney, and brain (Figure 1G).
Additional studies revealed that early FGF-21–induced signaling

phorylation of FGFR substrate–2 (FRS-2), a docking protein linking 
FGFRs to the Ras/MAPK pathway (24), and transient activation of 
MAPK (Figure 2A). All these in vitro activities are typically initiated 
upon activation of FGFR-mediated pathways (25).
FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 may represent FGF-21–corresponding receptors.
The sequence characteristics and signaling profile of FGF-21 
indicate that its receptor may belong to the FGFR superfamily. 
The expression of FGFR-1 and FGFR-2, including several splice 
variants of these receptors, was readily detected in 3T3-L1 cells 
by RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. While FGFR-5 was also 
detected by RT-PCR, significantly lower levels of FGFR-3 and no 
expression of FGFR-4 were observed. We immunoprecipitated 
FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 from 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific antibodies and detected in both cases 2 tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of approximately 120–150 kDa in FGF-21–stimulated cells 
(Figure 2B), while no phosphorylation was observed in FGFR-3 
immunoprecipitates under similar conditions (data not shown). 
These tyrosine-phosphorylated bands were later reprobed with 
anti–FGFR-1 and anti–FGFR-2 antibodies, respectively (Figure 2B), 
which indicates that they may represent activated forms of FGFR-1 
and FGFR-2. Importantly, the observed FGF-21–dependent phosphorylation was adipocyte specific, since it was not detected in 
3T3-L1 preadipocytes.
FGF-21 does not induce in vitro mitogenicity. As a class, FGFs are 
generally known to induce cell proliferation. Therefore, we examined the mitogenic potential of FGF-21 in cells typically sensitive 
to FGFs. FGF-21 did not induce proliferation of 3T3-L1, NIH 
3T3, or BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts, monkey epithelial 4MBr5 cells, 
primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), or human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), either in the absence 
or presence of exogenous heparin. In contrast, FGF-7, FGF-1, and 
FGF-2 stimulated the growth of these cells. Moreover, in costimFigure 1

then stimulated with FGF-21 or vehicle as indicated. Quantitative PCR and immunoblotting analyses were used to measure mRNA and protein 
levels, respectively. (G) GLUT1 mRNA is upregulated in adipose tissue of FGF-21–injected ob/ob mice. Two groups (5 animals each) of 8-week-old 
mice were injected s.c. with FGF-21 or vehicle. Quantitative PCR analysis was used to measure mRNA.

ulation experiments, FGF-21 did not antagonize the mitogenic 
activity induced by these FGF molecules (Figure 3).
Administration of FGF-21 to diabetic rodents. To test whether the 
observed in vitro bioactivity of FGF-21 translated into glucose-lowering effects in vivo, we administered the protein to ob/ob mice, a model 
of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Mice were injected s.c. once 
daily with 125 or 750 μg/kg/d of FGF-21 for 7 days. Fed glucose levels 
were determined 1 hour after administration on days 3 and 7. Both 
doses significantly lowered blood glucose compared with vehicle 
treatment after 3 days of administration. The effect was even more 
pronounced after 7 days, with fed glucose levels being normalized 
in both dose groups (Figure 4A). Moreover, the plasma triglyceride 
levels exhibited a dose-dependent reduction after 7 days of FGF-21 
injections (Figure 4B). Similar glucose-lowering effects were also 
observed upon FGF-21 administration in db/db mice (Figure 4C) and 
8-week-old obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats (Figure 4D).
Remarkably, FGF-21 administration to ob/ob mice for 7 days had a 
sustained blood glucose lowering effect. Fed glucose levels in treated 
animals were 25–35% lower than in the control group 24 hours after 
last dose (Figure 4F). This in vivo observation was unexpected, as 
pharmacokinetic studies in ob/ob mice determined the elimination 
half-life of FGF-21 to be only 0.7–1.1 hours and indicates a mechanism of FGF-21 action that did not require prolonged presence of 
the actual protein in circulation.
We also examined the effect of FGF-21 on glucose disposal during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In this study, FGF-21 
was administered twice daily for 4 days at 2.5 mg/kg/d. FGF-21–
treated ob/ob mice had significantly lower levels of insulin in the 
fasted state and during the test and improved glucose clearance 
(Figure 4, G and H) compared with vehicle-treated animals. Similar improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance were 
observed in db/db mice and 8-week-old obese ZDF rats upon FGF-21 
administration (data not shown).
To evaluate the potential for FGF-21 to induce hypoglycemia in 
rodents, we administered FGF-21 s.c. twice or once daily for 7 days 
to ob/ob, db/db, and C57BL/6 mice and 8-week-old obese and lean 
ZDF rats and measured blood glucose 1 hour after the last injection. At doses up to 4 mg/kg/d in mice and 8 mg/kg/d in rats, these 
diabetic or normal animals displayed no evidence of hypoglycemic 
effects in fed or even in the fasted state (Figure 4, A, C, F, and H).
FGF-21–transgenic mice. In order to evaluate the effect of enforced 
expression of FGF-21 in vivo, we generated FGF-21–transgenic 
mice that overexpressed the human protein from the liver using 
the apoE promoter. As measured by an FGF-21–specific ELISA, 
the plasma concentrations of FGF-21 in the transgenic animals 
ranged between 70 and 150 ng/ml.
These FGF-21–transgenic mice were viable and at 2 months of 
age had glucose levels similar to those of their wild-type littermates. 
However, at 9 months, differences between transgenic and wildtype mice became apparent. FGF-21–transgenic animals weighed 
significantly less, had lower fasted glucose levels (Table 1) and less 
fat in liver, retained more brown adipose tissue, had subcutaneous adipocytes of smaller size (Figure 5, A and B), and exhibited 
improved glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity relative to control littermates as measured during OGTT (data not shown).
Several members of FGF family have been shown to induce therapeutically undesirable in vivo proliferation of various cell types 
(1–5, 26). Therefore, we examined FGF-21–transgenic mice for their 
potential to develop tumors throughout their lifespan. As evidenced 
by histological analysis, transgenic mice overexpressing FGF-21 did 
not develop liver tumors or show evidence of any other tissue hyperplasia up to 10 months of age (Figure 5C).

We challenged FGF-21 transgenic animals by feeding them a 
high-fat/high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet for 15 weeks. Intriguingly, 
FGF-21–transgenic mice consumed almost twice as much food as 
wild-type littermates when the amounts were normalized to body 
weights and calculated as the actual amount of food eaten per animal per day (Table 1). Despite the significant increase in caloric 
intake, they did not gain as much weight as wild-type controls and 
were also resistant to diet-induced obesity (Figure 6, A and B).
Discussion
Several secreted polypeptides, including insulin, glucagon-like 
peptide–1 (GLP-1), adiponectin, and others are ultimately involved 
in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, which thus makes them 
clinically relevant pharmacological agents or attractive candidates 
for novel medicines for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (27). 
Recent reports on bone morphogenic protein–9 (BMP-9) (28) and 
FGF-19 (12, 13), and our findings with FGF-21, have shown that the 
other proteins also constitute this list of promising biomolecules.
FGF-21 bioactivity was discovered through a cell-based functional screen aimed at identifying novel secreted molecules that 
affect glucose uptake on mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes and was found 
to be very potent in this assay (EC50, ∼0.5 nM) (Figure 1A). With 
comparable potency, FGF-21 was active on differentiated human 
primary adipocytes (Figure 1B), which indicates that FGF-21 bioactivity is not limited to murine adipocytes.
The follow-up analysis on the initial observation in the glucose uptake assay revealed what we believe to be a novel and 
unique mechanism of the FGF-21 mode of action. FGF-21 effects 
appeared to be insulin independent and additive to insulin activity 
upon coadministration (Figure 1C). FGF-21 needed to be present 
on cells for several hours to produce a robust response in glucose 
uptake, and the effect was significantly diminished by the protein 
synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Figure 1D). While insulin is 
known to work in a rapid, hormone-like manner, we hypothesized 
that FGF-21 activity is likely to be mediated through changes in 
gene expression. Indeed, we showed that FGF-21 induced a signifiFigure 4

cant upregulation of the insulin-independent glucose transporter 
GLUT1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure 1, E and F) and further confirmed this finding in vivo when we administered FGF-21 to ob/ob
mice (Figure 1G). Thus, in contrast to insulin, which is known to 
function via GLUT4 translocation (29), FGF-21 may primarily act 
through upregulation of cellular GLUT1 in these cells.
In addition to the changes in GLUT1, we observed a modest 
reduction in GLUT4 levels after 48 and 72 hours of cell stimulation with FGF-21 (Figure 1F). While FGF-21 stimulation caused a 
decrease in GLUT4 levels in vitro, it did not appear to negatively 
impact glucose uptake (Figure 1C), which suggests either that the 
decrease is not sufficient to affect glucose transport or that other 
compensatory mechanisms are at work in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 
Moreover, we observed improved insulin sensitivity in FGF-21–
administered diabetic rodents even under enforced overexpression 
conditions in FGF-21–transgenic mice or after 8 weeks of chronic 
constant infusion of FGF-21 in db/db mice (Figure 4G and data 
not shown). Thus, the reduction observed in GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 
adipocytes does not appear to be functionally relevant.
FGF-21 is a typical FGF molecule with respect to its ability to 
stimulate MAPK activation and FRS-2 phosphorylation (25) 
(Figure 2A). In contrast, while heparin or heparin-like molecules 
are considered to be essential for the biological activity of proteins of the FGF family (30), none of the FGF-21–induced in vitro 
responses observed in 3T3-L1 or human adipocytes were heparin 
regulated. Importantly, FGF-21 appears to be mitogenically inactive in vitro when tested on several otherwise FGF-sensitive cell 
lines and primary cells (Figure 3). This further establishes FGF-21 
as a unique protein within the FGF family, as FGFs are well known 
to induce proliferation (1–5). Whereas the exact cause of the nonmitogenic character of the in vitro action of FGF-21 is currently 
unknown, these data help significantly in validating FGF-21 as a 
potential protein therapeutic.
The fact that FGF-21 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR-1 
and FGFR-2 (Figure 2B) suggests that these molecules may function as FGF-21 receptors. Although they carry readily detectable 
and functional FGFR-1 and/or FGFR-2 molecules, it is, however, 
currently unclear why several FGF-sensitive cells that were tested for 
FGF-21 bioactivity do not respond to FGF-21 stimulation. Moreover, in preliminary experiments with all commercially available 
FGFR extracellular domain–Fc fusion proteins (R&D Systems), we 
were unable to demonstrate direct interaction between any of these 
FGFR variants and FGF-21, despite the fact that we clearly observed 
binding for both FGF-1 and FGF-2 (data not shown). Thus, FGF-21 
may be physically interacting with different splice variants of 
FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 that are induced upon adipocyte differentiation. Alternatively, FGF-21–dependent activation of these receptors 
may require a fat cell–specific modification or additional cofactor.

FGF-21 did not stimulate glucose uptake on insulin-sensitive liver 
clone 9 and muscle L6-GLUT-4myc cells and on 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. 
Also, we were unable to detect FGF-21 activity in proliferation assays 
on several cell lines and primary cells of a different nature, which 
further indicates that FGF-21 effects might be adipocyte specific. 
Nevertheless, we recently observed a clear FGF-21 response on cells 
of nonfat origin. Unexpectedly, FGF-21 (1 μg/ml) showed efficacy 
in modulating glucagon secretion from isolated rat islets (Figure 7), 
while no effect on insulin secretion was observed. Thus, the specificity of FGF-21 bioactivity remains to be further studied.
The administration of FGF-21 to diabetic ob/ob and db/db mice 
and obese ZDF rats led to significant lowering of circulating glucose 
and triglycerides, as well as a reduction in fasted insulin levels and 
improved glucose clearance during an OGTT (Figure 4, A–H). All 
these effects were observed after at least 3 days of injections and were 
more pronounced after 7 days of administration. Since no changes in 
levels of fed and fasted glucose, circulating lipid levels, insulin levels, 
and glucose disposal during OGTT were observed after a single s.c. 
injection of FGF-21, it appears that beneficial FGF-21–dependent 
effects require that animals be exposed to the protein multiple times. 
However, once the reduction in circulating glucose was achieved, 
FGF-21–induced changes were sustained for at least 24 hours 
(Figure 4F). Thus, despite its short elimination half-life, FGF-21 
induced an extended pharmacodynamic effect in these diabetic 
animals. Taken together, these observations are remarkable in highlighting the difference in time action between FGF-21 and insulin.
Although potent in correcting elevated glucose levels in ob/ob and 
db/db mice, FGF-21 did not induce hypoglycemia in normal or diabetic rodents in either fasted or fed states (Figure 4, A, C–F, and H) at 
efficacious or significantly higher doses, and no hypoglycemia was 
seen in fasted FGF-21–transgenic mice (Table 1). This further distinguishes the effects of FGF-21 from those of insulin, which induced 
a significant reduction of blood glucose in lean animals (Figure 4E). 
Moreover, FGF-21 did not affect food intake or body weight/composition of diabetic or lean mice and rats over the course of 2 weeks of 
administration (doses ranging from 25 μg/kg/d to 8 mg/kg/d).
Further insights into the FGF-21 mechanism of action can be 
gleaned from the phenotype of FGF-21–transgenic mice. These 
animals are viable and are not metabolically distinguishable from 
wild-type littermates at 2 months of age. However, they appeared to 
be resistant to the age-related impairment of glucose metabolism 
since they had lower plasma glucose levels at 9 months (Table 1). 
Moreover, when challenged on HFHC diet for 15 weeks, FGF-21–
transgenic mice were resistant to diet-induced weight gain and fat 
accumulation (Figure 6, A and B), even though they consumed more 
food when the amounts were normalized to body weights (Table 1). 
We also observed lower levels of circulating leptin (Table 1). 
The reduction in leptin is consistent with lower adiposity in the 
transgenic animals and may be a primary cause of the increased 
food intake in the transgenic mice (31). However, these changes in 
feeding behavior are unlikely to have been induced by a direct effect 
of FGF-21, since no impact on food intake in rodents administered 
the protein was observed. There was also a decrease in circulating glucagon levels (Table 1), which is consistent with the in vitro 
observations made with rat pancreatic islets (Figure 7).
There was no evidence of poor nutrient absorption in FGF-21–
transgenic animals. Thus, another potential reason for the 
observed resistance to diet-induced obesity may be an effect of 
FGF-21 on energy expenditure. However, if this is true, it was not 
reflected in any changes in rectal body temperatures (Table 1). 
We speculate that FGF-21 overexpression may increase brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity, as we observed retention of BAT in the 
transgenic mice compared with wild-type controls (Figure 5A). 
Whether or not BAT activation may contribute to the effects of 
FGF-21 remains to be evaluated in future studies.

The FGF family member most closely related to FGF-21 is FGF-19, 
with 31% amino acid sequence identity between these 2 molecules (21). 
The phenotype of transgenic mice overexpressing FGF-19 (12, 13) 
is strikingly reminiscent of that of mice overexpressing FGF-21. 
However, we have uncovered a fundamental in vivo difference that 
clearly distinguishes these 2 molecules from each other. While transgenic mice overexpressing FGF-19 were resistant to high-fat diet–
induced obesity, they also developed histologically detectable liver 
tumors. Furthermore, wild-type mice that were injected with FGF-19 
for 6 days had an increase in hepatocellular proliferation (26). In 
contrast to FGF-19–overexpressing animals, FGF-21–transgenic 
mice did not form tumors in liver or show histological evidence of 
hyperplasia in any other tissue after 10 months of age (Figure 5C). 
Nevertheless, in order to further determine the potential of FGF-21 
to stimulate liver mitogenicity in vivo, we administered FGF-21 to 
db/db mice via ALZET pumps at an efficacious 11 μg/kg/h dose 
(Figure 4C) for 8 weeks. Again, no evidence of hepatocellular proliferation or tumor formation was seen in FGF-21–infused mice as 
determined by H&E staining or proliferative cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA) (32) immunohistochemistry (Figure 5D). Coupled with the 
lack of proliferation observed in vitro, the absence of tissue hyperplasia and activation of proliferative markers in FGF-21–treated and 
transgenic mice strongly suggests that FGF-21 is not mitogenic.
While our injection studies with FGF-21 in diabetic rodents 
clearly demonstrate that FGF-21 can lower glucose and lipids in circulation without inducing mitogenicity, hypoglycemia, or weight 
gain, the molecular mechanism by which FGF-21 functions is currently unclear. Despite the fact that FGF-21 and insulin induce 
similar functional outcomes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figures 1–3) 
and FGF-21 has a positive impact on insulin sensitivity when 
administered to diabetic rodents or transgenic mice (Figure 4G 
and data not shown), it is unlikely that FGF-21 directly affects 
insulin-dependent pathways. Signaling and mitogenic profiles 
for these 2 proteins are different in vitro; no FGF-21–dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor was observed 
in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown); and there is no apparent interference between FGF-21 and insulin actions in glucose 
uptake assay (Figure 1C). Moreover, the pharmacology observed 
in FGF-21–treated animals (absence of hypoglycemia and weight 
gain; extended time-action) further distinguishes this molecule 
from insulin, which thus rules out a possibility that FGF-21 functions as an insulin mimetic and/or sensitizer.
The beneficial in vivo effects of FGF-21 may be mediated 
through changes in circulating levels of endocrine-relevant hormones, in particular, adipokines, since adipocytes appear to be a 
target for FGF-21 bioactivity. To explore this possibility, we dosed 
ob/ob mice s.c. once daily with 125 μg/kg/day of FGF-21 for 7 days 
and measured the levels of several secreted polypeptides in circulation (Table 2). While we were able to achieve a clear glucose-lowering effect in the study (Figure 4A), only insulin and glucagon levels 
were changed in a statistically significant manner. The reduction 
of insulin levels is consistent with our observation in ob/ob mice 
during OGTT (Figure 4G) and is suggestive of improvements in 
insulin sensitivity in FGF-21–treated mice.
GLUT1 and glucagon potentially mediate the mode of action of 
FGF-21. We were able to detect FGF-21–dependent upregulation of 
GLUT1 message specifically in white fat upon bolus injection into 
ob/ob mice (Figure 1G), which thus confirms our in vitro observations on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The increase in GLUT1 may mechanistically be linked to FGF-21–dependent glucose lowering in diabetic 
rodents. Alternatively, or in concert, the glucose lowering effect of 
FGF-21 is likely to result from reduced glucagon secretion from 
pancreatic α cells, since FGF-21 inhibits glucagon release in vitro 
(Figure 7) and is lowered in FGF-21–transgenic mice (Table 1). 
The observation of glucagon lowering in FGF-21–injected ob/ob
mice (Table 2) further strengthens the hypothesis that this hormone is an important mediator of FGF-21 in vivo effects. There 
is accumulating evidence supporting a pathophysiological role of 
glucagon in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes. 
Basal glucagon is inappropriately elevated and its suppression is 
impaired following food consumption, which leads to increased 
hepatic glucose production and aggravation of the hyperglycemia 
associated with the disease (33, 34). Interestingly, attenuation of 
signaling through the glucagon receptor leads to normalization of 
plasma glucose and triglyceride levels in diabetic animals (35).
Despite substantial progress in understanding the pathophysiology 
of diabetes mellitus and the development of new drugs to treat diabetic patients, this disease remains a major health problem (36). New 
treatments are required that will allow an efficacious regulation of 
glycemia and reduce the risk of the side effects associated with current 
therapies (27, 37, 38). Here we demonstrate that FGF-21, as a single 
agent, can be used to provide efficient and durable glucose control 
and triglyceride lowering in diabetic animals, without apparent mitogenicity, hypoglycemia, or weight gain. FGF-21 thus holds promise as 
an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes.
Methods
Expression and purification of FGF-21. A pET30a vector was used to express 
human FGF-21 in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen; EMD 
Biosciences Inc.). FGF-21 product accumulated in the insoluble fraction. 
Inclusion bodies were prepared by standard centrifugation method. We 
solubilized inclusion bodies by bringing granule pellets to 10 times the 
original volume in 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 9.0, 7 M urea and homogenizing 
the material. The protein mixture was adjusted to pH 11, stirred for 1 hour, 
readjusted to pH 9.0, and loaded onto a Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham 
Biosciences). Anion-exchange (AEX) chromatography was done in 50 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 7 M urea, 1 mM DTT and with a 0–400 mM NaCl gradient 
elution. The eluted AEX pool was treated with 10 mM DTT for 2 hours at 
room temperature and diluted 10-fold with 10 mM cysteine/7 M urea. The 
protein was refolded by dialysis against 20 mM glycine, pH 9.0, for 48 hours,

at 4°C. Further purification was carried out with reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) performed with a Grace 
Vydac C18 column run in H20/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile mobile 
phase with a 0–50% acetonitrile gradient; size-exclusion chromatography 
on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS, pH 7.4; and AEX chromatography on MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 
0–300 mM NaCl gradient. The final FGF-21 pool was dialyzed into PBS, 
pH 7.4, sterile filtered, and stored at –80°C.
Cell culture, adipocyte differentiation, glucose uptake, and mitogenicity experiments. 
3T3-L1, NIH 3T3, BALB/c 3T3, 4MBr5, and clone 9 cells were from American Type Culture Collection; HMECs and HUVECs from Clonetics Corp.; 
and human primary preadipocytes from Zen-Bio Inc. A previously described 
3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation protocol (39) was adapted for Cytostar T 
96-well plates (Amersham Biosciences). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were seeded at 
25,000 cells/well density; the differentiation was induced 2 days later in 
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.25 μM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 
3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 5 μg/ml insulin (48 hours); and the medium was changed to DMEM/10% FBS/5μg/ml insulin (48 hours). Thereafter, 
the cells were incubated for an additional 9–20 days in DMEM/10% FBS 
(changed every other day). Primary human adipocytes were seeded in Cytostar T 96-well plates at 15,000 cells/well density; differentiated in Adipocyte 
Medium (AM; Zen-Bio Inc.) with 0.05 mM IBMX, 0.1 μM dexamethasone, 
10 nM insulin, and 1 μM rosiglitazone (14 days); and thereafter kept in AM 
(changed every other day). For glucose uptake, adipocytes were starved for 
3 hours in DMEM/0.1% BSA, stimulated with FGF-21 for 24 hours, and 
washed twice with KRP buffer (15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 118 mM NaCl, 
4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% BSA), 
and 100 μl of KRP buffer containing 2-deoxy-D-[14C]glucose (2-DOG) 
(0.1 μCi, 100 μM) was added to each well. Control wells contained 100 μl 
of KRP buffer with 2-DOG (0.1 μCi, 10 mM) to monitor for nonspecificity. 
The uptake reaction was carried out for 1 hour at 37°C, terminated by addition of cytochalasin B (20 μM), and measured using Wallac 1450 MicroBeta 
counter (Perkin Elmer). For mitogenicity experiments, cells were grown to 
confluence, starved for 24 hours in DMEM/0.5% FCS, stimulated for 18 
hours, and incubated with 0.25 μCi [3H]thymidine per well for 2 hours. Cell 
lysates were then harvested and counted.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, quantitative PCR. We used an RNeasy 
96 Kit (QIAGEN Inc.) to extract RNA from cells and TRIzol reagent 
(Invitrogen Corp.) to extract RNA from tissues. We performed reverse 
transcription using a SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen 
Corp.). The forward and reverse primer sequences for GLUT1 were 5′-
GCCCCCAGAAGGTTATTGA-3′ and 5′-CGTGGTGAGTGTGGTGGATG3′, respectively. The probe sequence was 5′-TTCTACAATCAAACATGGAACCACCGCA-3′. To normalize for differences in the amount of total 
RNA added to each reaction, we performed amplification of 18S ribosomal 
RNA as an endogenous control.
Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and multiplex assays. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were starved for 18 hours, stimulated with FGF-21 (1 μg/ml) for 10 
minutes or for the indicated times (Figures 1F and 2A), and lysed (40), and 
soluble fractions were analyzed. Antibodies were: anti–phospho-MAPK 
(Thr202/Tyr204), anti-MAPK, anti–phospho-FRS-2 (Y196) (Cell Signaling 
Technology); anti–FRS-2 (H-91) and anti–FGFR-2 (C-17) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate); rabbit polyclonal: 
anti-GLUT1 against the 29 C-terminal amino acids of the human sequence, 
anti-GLUT4 (41), and anti–FGFR-1 against the 15 C-terminal amino acids 
of the mouse sequence. For immunodetection, goat anti-mouse and antirabbit HRP conjugates (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and ECL detection system 
(Amersham Biosciences) were used. We measured hormone and adipokine 
levels in circulation of vehicle-treated and FGF-21–injected ob/ob mice 
using Multiplex assay kits from LINCO Research Inc.
Tissue preparation, histology analysis, and immunostaining. Tissues were fixed 
overnight in zinc-buffered formalin and then transferred to 70% ethanol prior to processing through paraffin. Five-micrometer sections were 
stained with H&E. Adjacent 5-micrometer sections were placed on positively charged slides. The slides were then baked overnight at 60°C in an 
oven and then deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded 
alcohols to water. Antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides 
in Target Retrieval Solution for 20 minutes at 90°C, cooling at 25°C for 
10 minutes, and washing in water; we then proceeded with immunostaining. 
All subsequent staining steps were performed on the Autoimmunostainer; 
incubations and all washes were done at 25°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 
containing 0.05% Tween-20. Slides were blocked with protein blocking 
solution for 25 minutes, and the PCNA antibody (PC10 clone) was incubated at a dilution of 1:10 for 1 hour. A biotinylated antibody plus streptavidin-HRP kit was then applied and followed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine 
(DAB) staining. The slides were briefly counterstained with hematoxylin. 
All immunoreagents and the Autoimmunostainer were from Dako Corp.
Pancreatic islet isolation and hormone release studies. Pancreatic islets from male 
Wistar rats (200 g; Harlan Winkelmann GmbH) were isolated and cultured as 
described previously (35). For measurements of glucagon and insulin release, 
islets were starved in Earle’s balanced salt solution medium containing 1 mM 
glucose for 30 minutes. Groups of 10 (glucagon) or 3 (insulin) islets were 
selected and transferred into 0.3 ml of EBSS medium with tested compounds. 
Islets were further incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C with vehicle or FGF-21 
(1 μg/ml), supernatants were collected, and hormone content was measured.
In vivo protocols. The protocols used in these studies were approved by the 
Eli Lilly Research Laboratories Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were maintained in a controlled environment (21 ± 2°C, 50–60% 
humidity, 12-hour light-dark cycle, lights on at 6 am). Male ob/ob and db/db
mice were from Harlan Teklad, fed Purina 5008 Chow, and had free access 
to food and water. FGF-21 was administered by s.c. injection in saline. For 
OGTT, the animals were fasted 16 hours and challenged by an oral glucose 
load (2.5 g/kg) 1 hour after the last injection. Blood samples were taken 
from conscious, fed animals by tail snip, and glucose and plasma triglyceride levels were determined using Precision G Blood Glucose Testing System 
(Abbott Laboratories) and Hitachi 912 Clinical Chemistry analyzer (Roche 
Diagnostics Corp.), respectively. Insulin and leptin levels were determined 
with murine ELISA kits (Crystal Chem Inc.).
Male obese or lean ZDF rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Inc. and housed singly in a humidity and temperature-controlled 
environment (21 ± 2°C, 50–60% humidity, 12-hour light-dark cycle, lights 
on at 6 am) with free access to food (Purina 5008 Chow) and water for 2 
weeks prior to start of the experiment. The day before the study, all animals 
were tail bled, and plasma glucose was analyzed on a Hitachi 912 Clinical 
Chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Rats were then randomized 
based on their glucose levels and body weights and placed into groups. Animals were dosed with vehicle (0.9% saline), insulin (Humulin; Eli Lilly and 
Company), or FGF-21 for 7 continuous days of twice-daily administration. 
On days 3 and 7, fed rats were bled (by tail snip) at 1-hour after administration of the last dose, and plasma glucose was assayed as described above.
The human apoE promoter including its hepatic control region (42) was 
used to express the human FGF-21 cDNA in transgenic mice. The transgenic vector was linearized and microinjected into C57BL/6NTac eggs by 
standard methods (43). We identified transgenic mice by PCR using transgene-specific primers and confirmed transgene expression by real-time 
quantitative PCR on RNA isolated from livers as well as by ELISA on plasma 
obtained from the transgenic mice using an FGF-21 polyclonal antibody.
For high-fat feeding, all mice were housed individually in Micro-Isolator cages (Lab Products Inc.) and maintained from age 24 days on high-fat 
TD95217 chow (40% fat; Harlan Teklad) with free access to food and water.

A wide-line nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument (Bruker BioSpin Corp.) was used to quantify tissue mass. Unanesthetized mice were 
placed into a 5-cm diameter glass cylinder that was lowered into the instrument. Data was obtained for 4.5 minutes (3 determinations at 1.5-minute 
intervals) and analyzed by the manufacturer’s software. The mean of triplicate determinations for apparent muscle mass, fat mass, and free water 
mass was calculated for each mouse. Coefficient of variation of all 3 masses 
determined for a live moving mouse was less than 3%.
