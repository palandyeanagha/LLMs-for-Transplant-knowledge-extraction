Pleural malakoplakia caused by Rhodoccocus
equi infection in a patient after stem cell
transplantation

Abstract
Malakoplakia is a disease especially of the urinary tract with typical plaques most frequently observed in the urinary
bladder’s mucosa. In the context of immunosuppression malakoplakia can also occur in other organs. Some of
these extravesical malakoplakias are associated with an infection by Rhodococcus equi, a rare human pathogen
well known from veterinary medicine. Here we present the first case of a pleural malakoplakia without lung
involvement caused by a proved Rhodococcus equi infection.
Keywords: Malakoplakia, Pleura, Rhodococcus equi, Michaelis-Gutmann-Bodies
Background
Malakoplakia as a disease of the urinary tract is characterized by typical plaques consisting of accumulated
macrophages [1] exhibiting an impaired lysosomal
degradation of bacteria, especially E. coli [2,3]. Particularly in immunosuppressed patients malakoplakia can
also appear in other organs such as prostate, lung or
skin [4]. In some cases of extravesical malakoplakia the
patients showed an infection with Rhodococcus equi, a
common germ from veterinary medicine, which causes
bronchopneumonia in foals [5-7]. Human infections
with Rhodococcus equi, however, are very rare and
mostly associated with immunosuppression [8]. To our
knowledge, affection of the pleura with malakoplakia
without lung involvement and simultaneous Rhodococcus equi infection has not been documented previously.
Case presentation
Clinical findings
A 60-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because
of generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly
and suspicion of pneumonia. Based on lymph node
biopsy the diagnosis of T-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia
was confirmed. Allogenic stem cell transplantation was
performed with a matched related donor with a HLA-Amismatch followed by immunosuppression with
tacrolimus.
Three months later the patient was admitted to the
hospital with retrosternal pain and a reduced general
condition. The clinical examinations revealed pneumonic rales over the right lung, slightly elevated temperature, and elevated infection parameters. Primarily the
diagnosis of pneumonia was made and the patient was
treated with antibiotics and antimycotics. The following
computertomography of the chest revealed a 12 cm in
diameter and well circumscribed round mass affecting
the right upper lobe of the lung (Figure 1). Differential
diagnosis included an organized pneumonia or a malignant tumor. The lesion seemed to repress but not to
infiltrate the lung and showed no signs of recovery
under therapy.
Surgery operation confirmed a tumor, which was
adherent to the parietal pleura as well as to the lung
and which was removed by lobectomy of the right
upper lobe. Microbiological examination of tumor tissue
revealed a positivity for Rhodococus equi.
Pathological findings
On macroscopical examination the right upper lobe of
the lung showed a 12 cm large tumor connected with
the visceral pleura and the lung without infiltration of * Correspondence: clbehnes@med.uni-goettingen.de

the lung. The tumor exhibited a gray-white cut surface
with central necrotic, disintegrated areas (Figure 1).
Microscopical examination revealed a tumor consisting of a monomorphic cell population, which was predominantly composed of macrophages. Granulomas,
multinucleated giant cells or significant cellular atypia
could not be observed. The immunohistochemical studies confirmed Ki-M1P/CD68 positive macrophages as
the major tumor component. An increased proliferation
was not detectable using the Ki67 staining. The macrophages showed intracellular deposits of concentric layers
with a bright rim. The latter structures displayed PAS
positivity and could be confirmed as calcifications by
Kossa staining thus representing Michaelis-GutmannBodies pathognomonic for malakoplakia (Figure 2).
Conclusion
We present the first case of a pleural malakoplakia
caused by a proved Rhodococcus equi infection. The
patient suffered from a rare T-cell-prolymphocytic-leukemia and was treated by stem cell transplantation. To
prevent rejection, the patient received an immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus. Retrospectively, the
patient confirmed a contact with horses most probably
causing the here described pleural malakoplakia.
Malakoplakia is a rare disease occuring particularly in
the area of the urinary tract. It is based on an E. coli
infection, usually followed by a macrophage-rich inflammation [1]. During the course of inflammation bacteria
can remain and survive within macrophages and form
the called Michaelis-Gutmann-Bodies [9]. The macrophages settle in the mucosa of the urinary bladder and
form typical plaques. In rare cases usually under suppressed immune status specific pathogens play a major
role for the development of malakoplakia [7]. One of
these specific pathogens is Rhodococcus equi, a grampositive rod that is especially known from veterinary
medicine [5-7].
The first human infection by Rhodococcis equi was
described in 1967 in a drug immunosuppressed patient
[10]. Since 1980 the reported cases in the literature of
infection with Rhodococcus equi in humans increased
up to more than 200 cases till today [11]. This could be
due to the increasing occurrence of HIV infection and
immunosuppressing therapies in oncology and transplantation medicine. In 30 of these cases a Rhodococcus
equi infection with development of malakoplakia could
be found, mainly affecting lung tissue without pleural
involvement [11,12].
