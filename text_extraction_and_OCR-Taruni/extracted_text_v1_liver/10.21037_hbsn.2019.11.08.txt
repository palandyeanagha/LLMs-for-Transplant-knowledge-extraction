Background: The end-stage liver disease causes a metabolic dysfunction whose most prominent clinical 
feature is the loss of skeletal muscle mass (SMM). In living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), liver 
graft regeneration (GR) represents a crucial process to normalize the portal hypertension and to meet the 
metabolic demand of the recipient. Limited data are available on the correlation between pre-LDLT low 
SMM and GR.
Methods: Retrospective study on a cohort of 106 LDLT patients receiving an extended left liver lobe graft. 
The skeletal muscle index (SMI) at L3 level was used for muscle mass measurement, and the recommended 
cut-off values of the Japanese Society of Hepatology guidelines were used as criteria for defining low 
muscularity. GR was evaluated as rate of volume increase at 1 month post-LT [graft regeneration rate (GRR)].
Results: The median GRR at 1 month post-LT was 91% (IQR, 65–128%) and a significant correlation 
with graft volume-to-recipient standard liver volume ratio (GV/SLV) (rho −0.467, P<0.001), graft-torecipient weight ratio (GRWR) (rho −0.414, P<0.001), donor age (rho −0.306, P=0.001), 1 month post-LT 
cholinesterase serum levels (rho 0.397, P=0.002) and pre-LT low muscularity [absent vs. present GRR 97.5% 
(73.1–130%) vs. 83.5% (45.2–110.9%), P=0.041] was noted. Moreover in male recipients, but not in women, 
it was shown a direct correlation with pre-LT SMI (rho 0.352, P=0.020) and inverse correlation with 1 month 
post-LT SMI variation (rho −0.301, P=0.049). A low GRR was identified as an independent prognostic factor 
for recipient overall survival (HR 6.045, P<0.001). 
Conclusions: Additionally to the hemodynamic factors of portal circulation and the quality of the graft, 
the metabolic status of the recipients has a significant role in the GR process. A pre-LT low SMM is 
associated with impaired GRR and this negative impact is more evident in male recipients.

Introduction
Sarcopenia, defined as a pathological reduction of skeletal 
muscle mass and strength, is one of the most clinically 
impactful features of the metabolic dysfunction related to 
end stage liver disease (ESLD) (1). It is associated with an 
increased morbidity and mortality, poor performance status 
and quality of life both before and after liver transplantation 
(LT) (1-3). Unfortunately, it has been verified that LT does 
not invariably guarantee a curative effect on sarcopenia with 
no recovery of the skeletal muscle mass (4,5). Moreover, 
the surgical stress and complications related to LT may 
even further compromise and worsen such metabolic 
dysfunction, particularly in the early postoperative period. 
In living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), liver graft 
regeneration represents a crucial process to normalize the 
portal hypertension associated with small-for-size syndrome 
and to meet the metabolic and biosynthetic demand of the 
recipient (6). In clinical setting, graft regeneration has been 
mainly correlated with hemodynamic factors and the quality 
of the graft (7-11). However, graft regeneration is surely an 
anabolic process which may also depend on the adequate 
availability of energy and metabolites. 
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate 
whether the recipient’s skeletal muscle mass measured at 
the pre-LT and early post-LT phase showed any association 
with the graft regeneration at 1 month post-LT, in left lobe 
graft LDLT.
Methods
Skeletal muscle mass measurement
To evaluate the presence and severity of low muscularity, 
the skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the lower end plate of the 
L3 body (L3-SMI) was used, as previously reported (12). 
CT images were analyzed with SYNAPSE VINCENT 
(FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan). The L3 SMI was expressed as 
cross-sectional muscle area/height2, and the cut-off for a 
diagnosis of low muscle mass was L3-SMI <42 cm2/m2 for 
men and L3-SMI <38 cm2/m2 for women, as determined by 
the Japanese Society of Hepatology guidelines (13). The 
SMI variation (SMIv%) was calculated using the following 
formula:
SMIv%= (SMI1month post-LT - SMIpre-LT)×100/SMIpre-LT
Body mass index (BMI) as anthropometric parameter 
was calculated the day before LT procedure. No weight 
correction was done in presence of ascites.
Liver regeneration
For 3-dimentional volumetry reconstruction, 0.5–3 mmthick images acquired during a 3 phase (arterial, portal, 
venous) dynamic multidetector computer tomography 
(CT) scan were analyzed with SYNAPSE VINCENT 
(FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan). In donors, after the 
reconstruction of the whole liver volume and vessels, the 
virtual liver partition was performed and the graft volume 
(GV) measured. In recipients, the whole GV was measured 
at 1 month post-LT with the same methodology. The graft 
regeneration rate (GRR) was calculated using the following 
formula (14):
GRR%= (GV1month post-LT - GVpre-LT)×100/GVpre-LT
Both SMI and GV were measured by a single researcher, 
specifically trained in SYNAPSE VINCENT use, under the 
direct supervision of the surgeons who actually managed the 
patients clinically. Only Pre-LT CT scans performed within 
3 months before LDLT were used in the analysis.
Patients characteristics
From January 2008 to October 2018, a total of 190 patients 
underwent primary LDLT at the Nagasaki University 
Hospital. Technical details about the surgical procedure 
applied for LDLT have already been described elsewhere (15). 
Right lobe grafts or right posterior sector grafts (n=66) 
were excluded from the analysis to remove the confounding 
effect of hepatic venous congestion which has a known 
negative impact on regeneration and is variably related to 
the middle hepatic vein management in the graft (middle 
hepatic vein inclusion or not, middle hepatic vein tributaries 
reconstruction or not). Pediatric cases were excluded (n=4). 
Recipients with an overall survival lower than 1 month, graft 
loss within the first post-LT month or unavailability of CT 
scan at 1 month post LT were excluded from the analysis as 
they could not be evaluated in terms of graft regeneration 
(n=14) (Figure 1). Aside from the skeletal muscle mass, early 
major postoperative complications were also investigated 
as potential determinants of graft regeneration. They were 
considered when occurring within the first post-LT month 
and were defined as follows:
• Re-laparotomy: any surgical complication requiring relaparotomy;
• Vascular complication: any arterial or venous (portal and 
hepatic veins) complication;
• Biliary complication: biliary leakage, stricture or

cholangitis;
• Blood stream infection: clinical and laboratory features 
of sepsis associated with positive hemocultures;
• Graft rejection: any case (antibody mediated rejection, 
cell mediated rejection) of histopathologically verified 
graft rejection.
All patients were managed with an early enteral feeding 
(EEF) protocol using a tube jejunostomy placed at the 
time of LT, as previously reported (12). Briefly, A tube 
jejunostomy was placed at the time of LT, and 24 hours 
postoperatively, enteral nutrition with Elental (Ajinomoto 
Pharmaceutical Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was introduced. The 
calories load was 1 kcal/mL and the initial infusion rate 
was 10 mL/h. If the patient tolerated the enteral load well, 
the rate was increased up to 60 mL/h and maintained 
until sufficient oral intake was possible. Extubation was 
usually performed on postoperative day (POD) 1–2 and 
oral intake was usually initiated at POD 4–5. Enteral 
nutrition was reduced progressively and discontinued 
when the oral intake exceeded 1,200 kcal/day. None of the 
patients required unplanned complete withdrawal of enteral 
feeding due to side effects, nor did any jejunostomy-related 
complications occur. The standard immunosuppression 
regimen comprised tacrolimus and steroids. The steroids 
were gradually tapered and discontinued by 3 months 
after LDLT. Mycophenolate mofetil was added for ABOincompatible LDLT patients and patients who were 
intentionally kept at lower trough levels of tacrolimus due 
to renal dysfunction. A detailed protocol has been described 
elsewhere (15).
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and 
percentage, while continuous variables were expressed as 
mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median [interquartile 
range (IQR)], as appropriate. For categorical variables, 
cross-tabulations were generated, and the chi-square or 
Fisher’s exact test was used to compare distributions.
Differences in terms of graft regeneration according 
to categorical variables were analysed by Student’s t or 
Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. Pearson or Spearman 
correlation coefficients were used to explore any correlation 
between graft regeneration and continuous variables. 
Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed 
including all variables significant at P<0.05 in the 
aforementioned analysis. 
Graft loss was defined as death due to graft failure 
or retransplantation. Death with functioning graft was 
considered as a competing risk event because death for 
causes unrelated to graft loss precludes the occurrence of 
graft loss. The cumulative incidence method was used to 
estimate graft loss accounting for the presence of competing 
risks. Based on the method of Fine and Gray, univariate and 
multivariate competing-risk regression were used to explore 
which factors were associated with graft loss. This model 
is based on the hazard of the subdistribution and provides 
a simple relationship between covariates and cumulative 
incidence. The risk of multicollinearity was evaluated 
by means of the variance inflation factor. Variables of P 
less than 0.05 during univariate analysis were included in 
multivariable analysis.
The OS was defined as the time (months) from LT to 
either death or last observation and was described using 
the Kaplan-Meier approach. Univariate and multivariate 
Cox regression were used to estimate prognostic variables 
associated with OS, after the assumption of the proportional 
hazard was verified. The proportional hazard assumption 
was tested using the Schoenfeld residual test.

categorical variable. Thus, low GR was defined as a GR 
lower than the 25th percentile of the whole population.
Results
The study population comprised 106 patients and was 
characterized by a male-to-female ratio of 43:63 with a 
median age of 57 [50–62] years (Table 1). The median model 
for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was 17 [13–23] and 
9.4% of patients had already been admitted to intensive care 
unit (ICU) before LT. The median BMI was 22.9 (20.8–26.5) 
and the mean pre-LT SMI value for men and women was 
47.2±9.1 and 39.1±7.1 respectively (P<0.001). A low muscle 
mass was diagnosed in 45 patients (42.5%). The median graft

volume-to-recipient standard liver volume percent (GV/
SLV%) and graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) were 
40% (36–47%) and 0.78 (0.66–0.92) respectively. The donors 
were characterized by a median age of 34 [27–42] years, and 
in all cases the BMI was lower than 25. 
At one month post-LT, male patients showed a mean 
SMI of 43.8±8.9 while women of 39.7±7.8, with a SMIv% 
of −8.00% (−12.28% to −3.67%) and +2.55% (−5.30% 
to +11.27%) respectively. The difference of SMIv% was 
statistically significant (P<0.001). The prevalence of low 
muscle mass diagnosis decreased to 38.7%, without a 
statistically significant difference compared to pre-LT 
prevalence (P=0.39). The median GRR at 1 month postLT was 90.90% (65.65–127.76%). GV/SLV%, GRWR 
and donor age showed a significant negative correlation 
with GRR (Tables 2-4). Conversely Pre-LT SMI showed 
a significant positive correlation in men (Spearman’s rho 
0.352, P=0.02) but not in women. Furthermore, in male 
recipients, GRR inversely correlated with the SMIv% 
(Spearman’s rho −0.30, P=0.05) at a statistically significant 
level. Using the gender-specific cut-off values for low 
muscle mass diagnosis recommended by the Japanese 
Society of Hepatology guidelines (13), patients with 
preoperative low muscle mass showed a significantly 
lower GRR compared to patients with normal skeletal 
muscularity (P=0.04). Conversely, no association with 1 
month post-LT low muscularity was noted. Multivariate 
linear regression analysis showed that GV/SLV% and 
donor age independently correlated with GRR in the whole 
study population as well as in gender specific subgroups 
(R-squared =0.44). Furthermore, in male recipients, pre-LT 
SMI and SMIv% also maintained a statistically significant 
correlation with GRR (R-squared =0.58) (Tables 2-4). No 
correlation was registered between GRR and 1 month 
post-LT ratio of prothrombin time (PT-INR), bilirubin 
or albumin plasma level while cholinesterase serum level 
showed a significant positive correlation (Spearman’s rho 
0.397, P=0.002).
Graft loss occurred in 8 (7.5%) patients: 4 patients 
died because of graft failure while 4 were submitted to 
retransplantation. The underlying causes comprised HCV 
recurrence (3 pts), acute artery thrombosis (1 pt), acute 
massive portal thrombosis (1 pt), graft absessualization 
(1 pt), chronic graft rejection (1 pt) and tumor recurrence 
(1 pt). Low GRR was not shown to be a significant risk 
factor for graft loss (Table 5). Excluding retransplantation 
cases, the patient OS at 1, 3 and 5 years was 90.1%, 86.6% 
and 78.6% respectively, and a low GRR was recorded in 
23.6% of cases. In univariate analysis, low GRR, donor 
age, post-LT ICU length of stay, early post-LT blood 
stream infection, 1month post-LT bilirubin serum level 
and 1month post-LT PT-INR were shown to be significant 
prognostic factors for OS (Table 6, Figure 2). In multivariate 
analysis, low GRR [HR 6.045; 95% confidence interval (CI),

Discussion
GR is a highly complex biological process which is 
activated and regulated by multiple inflammatory, growth 
and metabolic pathways (6,10,11,16). In partial grafts, the 
increased shear stress associated with portal hyperperfusion 
activates an inflammatory reaction with release of vascular 
endothelial growth factor, interleukin 6, and nitric oxide by 
Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (8,9). These 
mediators have been demonstrated to activate replication 
processes in the hepatocytes (8,9). Clinically, several 
parameters of splanchnic circulation and portal flow (8,9,17) 
as well as parameters of graft-to-recipient relative mass 
(GV/SLV and GRWR) have been demonstrated to strongly 
correlate with the GR. In the present study, GV/SLV and 
GRWR were the variables with the highest correlation 
coefficient. Regarding the graft quality, advanced donor age 
and graft steatosis have been also identified as significant 
risk factors for GR (10,11,18-20) The aging is associated 
with a progressive loss of hepatocytes regenerative capacity, 
characterized by a decrease of cell cycle and increase of 
autophagy and apoptosis (10,11,21,22), while steatotic 
grafts show a greater susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion 
injury (7,10,11). In the present study, the recipient age did 
have a significant and negative impact on GR. Such result 
may have also been determined by a 16% prevalence of 
donors older than 50 years, which is the most frequently 
reported cut-off for a higher risk of poor graft outcome (10). 
Nonetheless, the analyses of the outcomes in donorrecipient pairs has failed to demonstrate any correlation 
between the two parts of the same liver in terms of 
regenerative behavior, indicating that the host plays a 
significant role in driving the process (16). As a matter of 
fact, the clinical conditions of the recipients have emerged 
as a critical determinant of GR, although the available 
data on the underlying pathogenesis and mechanism are 
very limited. The ischemic stress and metabolic demands 
in recipients appear to provide a growth stimulus to 
activate priming cytokines for initiation of liver graft 
regeneration (6,11,16). However, when the severity of 
the recipient illness is too advanced, susceptible grafts

may fail to sustain the energy and metabolic burden or to 
recover from the ischemic-reperfusion injury and portal 
hyperperfusion injury, thus resulting in an impaired 
regeneration and functional decompensation (6,11,16,23). 
Therefore, the graft must balance the available resources 
between the recipient’s metabolic homeostasis and its 
regeneration. In the present study, low muscle mass as 
defined by the Japan Society of Hepatology (13) was 
associated with a significantly lower GRR in both sexes. 
However just in men it was possible to record a significant 
and positive correlation between GRR and pre-LT SMI. 
It has been verified that malnutrition in male patients 
with ESLD is mainly characterized by muscle mass loss, 
whereas that in women is characterized by fat loss (1). 
Furthermore, ESLD male patients frequently suffer of 
hypogonadism with low testosterone levels which further 
worsen muscle mass degeneration and loss (24). Identifying 
male LT candidates as having a higher risk of poor energy 
and proteins reserve may explain why pre-LT SMI did 
directly correlate with GR specifically in men. Furthermore, 
as we previously reported (12), male recipients tend to have 
a worsening of their skeletal muscle mass in the early postLT period, compared to a substantial stable trend in women. 
Demonstrating in the present study that in men the greater 
was the GRR, the lower was the SMIv%, may indicate that 
the graft and the skeletal muscles somehow competed for 
the same metabolic substrates. This result was surprising 
as it might be expected that the graft regeneration could 
sustain the muscle mass recovery rather than further 
compromise it. Conversely, it appeared that the probable 
limited availability of metabolic substrates made necessary 
to preferentially shunt the metabolism toward hepatocytes 
replication pathways, to the detriment of the skeletal muscle 
fibers. Further studies are needed anyway to clarify this 
potential adaptive mechanism.
EEF protocols after LDLT have been already 
demonstrated to control the negative impact of pre-LT 
low muscularity and sarcopenia on post-LT recipients 
survival but currently fail to significantly improve the 
skeletal muscle mass (12). These findings were confirmed 
even by the present investigation which also showed that 
EEF was apparently not sufficient to counteract the preLT metabolic dysfunction and supplement the recipients’ 
metabolic reserves.
A direct correlation between graft volume and laboratory 
markers of liver function has been verified mainly in 
the early post-LT period in LDLT (6) when small-forsize grafts or grafts with a low regenerative reactivity are 
associated with a higher risk of early dysfunction (6,11). 
However, in more advanced postoperative phases, it has 
been reported that the early allograft dysfunction acts as 
a trigger for a greater GR to compensate the metabolic 
deficit of the early post-LT period (6). Moreover, many 
therapeutic interventions, such as albumin supplementation, 
vitamin K administration or biliary drainage, as well as 
post-LT complications such as biliary complications may 
alter the direct correlation between graft regeneration and 
function. As a matter of fact, in the present study GRR 
did show a significant correlation, among all the examined 
laboratory liver function markers at 1 month post-LT, 
only with cholinesterase serum levels, which are not 
clinically modifiable. Nonetheless a low GRR as well as the 
laboratory markers of graft function (bilirubin serum level, 
PT-INR) were both found to be significant determinants 
of recipient survival. These results are in line with previous 
reports (25). No correlation was noted between GRR and 
graft survival, probably due to the underlying causes of graft 
loss which appeared not to be directly correlated with a 
poor GR.
Several limitations must be mentioned for this study: no 
data on insulin resistance during the early postoperative 
period; unavailability of specific values of Kcal/kg and 
protein/kg administered to the recipients during the 
post-LT course, despite none of the patients required a 
withdrawal of the EEF protocol and the calories intake was 
monitored and maintained over 1,200 kcal/day during all 
the hospital stay; a low-moderate statistical strength of the 
GRR correlation indices, although in line with previous

reports (8,11); the retrospective modality of the data analysis 
and limited number of patients in the study population.
Conclusions
GR is crucial in LDLT to normalize the portal hypertension 
and sustain the metabolic demand of the recipients, and 
a low GRR at 1 month post-LT is associated with a poor 
recipient overall survival. Additionally to the hemodynamic 
factors of portal circulation and the quality of the graft, 
even the metabolic status of the recipients seems to have a 
significant role in the GR process. A pre-LT low skeletal 
muscle mass is associated with impaired GR and this 
negative impact is more evident in men whose metabolic 
dysfunction tends to be more severe, despite the use of 
EEF protocols. New strategies or formulas of nutritional 
interventions may probably be warranted to treat sarcopenia 
and the related underlying metabolic dysfunction before 
and early after LDLT.
