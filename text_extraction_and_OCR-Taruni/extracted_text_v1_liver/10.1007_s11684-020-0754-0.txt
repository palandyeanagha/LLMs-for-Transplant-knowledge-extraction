Abstract It has been known that, the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, which is considered similar to SARS-CoV,
invades human cells via the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Moreover, lung cells that have
ACE2 expression may be the main target cells during 2019-nCoV infection. However, some patients also exhibit
non-respiratory symptoms, such as kidney failure, implying that 2019-nCoV could also invade other organs. To
construct a risk map of different human organs, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets
derived from major human physiological systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, and urinary
systems. Through scRNA-seq data analyses, we identified the organs at risk, such as lung, heart, esophagus,
kidney, bladder, and ileum, and located specific cell types (i.e., type II alveolar cells (AT2), myocardial cells,
proximal tubule cells of the kidney, ileum and esophagus epithelial cells, and bladder urothelial cells), which are
vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Based on the findings, we constructed a risk map indicating the vulnerability of
different organs to 2019-nCoV infection. This study may provide potential clues for further investigation of the
pathogenesis and route of 2019-nCoV infection.

Introduction
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreaks as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern [1]. Experts and scientists worldwide are working
rapidly to expand scientific knowledge on this new virus.
In addition to respiratory symptoms, such as cough and
shortness of breath, clinical manifestations including
multiple organ failure were also observed, which is
unusual with other coronavirus infections.
The initial step of 2019-nCoV infection is its entrance
into human cells. The analysis of Xu et al. [2] showed that
the 2019-nCoV and the SARS-CoV share a common
ancestor that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9-1.
These coronaviruses have very similar spike protein 3-D
structures that are considered to have strong binding
affinity to the human cell receptor, angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2). Therefore, the cells with ACE2
expression may act as target cells and thus are susceptible
to 2019-nCoV infection; such cells include type II alveolar
cells (AT2) of the lungs [3]. Hence, we believe that the
ACE2 expression pattern in different organs, tissues, and
cell types could uncover the potential risk to 2019-nCoV
infection because the target cells expressing ACE2 might
permit coronavirus entry, multiplication, spread, and
pathogenesis. Previously, the RNA and protein expressions
of ACE2 were investigated using bulk samples from the
heart, lung, kidney, and other organs. However, these bulk
data only consider average expression and utterly ignore

cell diversity and specificity.
In addition to AT2 cells, the cell types and organs that
express ACE2 as a potential receptor for 2019-nCoV are
still unclear. Therefore, this study explores the existence of
host cell receptor ACE2 in various cell types using
published single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to track
the potential 2019-nCoV infection in human organs. Based
on these data, we construct a map of ACE2 expression over
different cell types of different organs to predict the
potential risk for 2019-nCoV infection and injury. This
work can contribute to an improved understanding of how
2019-nCoV invades human body systems.
Materials and methods
Here, we explored the published scRNA-seq datasets from
various tissues and organs of different human body
systems, including the respiratory system [4,5] (nasal
mucosa, respiratory track, bronchus, and lung), the
cardiovascular system [6] (heart), the digestive system
[7–10] (esophagus, stomach, ileum, and liver), and the
urinary system [11,12] (kidney and bladder). The lung
scRNA-seq data were acquired from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database under the series number
GSE122960; the nasal mucosa, respiratory track, bronchus
scRNA-seq data were from GSE121600; the heart data
were from GSE106118; the esophagus data were
downloaded from https://www.tissuestabilitycellatlas.org/;
the ileum data were from GSE134809 sample
GSM3972018; the stomach data were from GSE134520
sample GSM3954949; the liver data were from
GSE115469; the kidney data were from GSE109564;
and the bladder data were from GSE129845 sample
GSM3723358.
The ACE2 expression distribution across distinct cell
types of different organs were evaluated, and then the cell
types with high ACE2 expression levels were identified in
accordance with the scRNA-seq datasets. A generally
accepted consensus suggests that the 2019-nCoV virus
tends to attack lung AT2 cells via host receptor ACE2, and
the expression level of ACE2 in AT2 cells were thus used
as a reference. We defined that any type of cells with a
proportion of ACE2 positive cells (UMI count > 0)
comparable to or larger than that of AT2 cells is highly
vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection, and the corresponding
organs should be listed as highly risky.
We used Seurat V3.0 to discriminate different cell types.
The data were first normalized using the LogNormalize
method, and the cell clustering performance were
conducted using the top 2000 most variable genes with
the resolution set to 0.5 for kidney and 0.1 for the others.
The cell scatter plots were obtained using the UMAP
method [13].
Results
Pulmonary AT2 cells and respiratory epithelial cells
exhibit high ACE2 expression
We analyzed scRNA-seq datasets from nasal mucosa,
respiratory track, bronchus, and lung of the respiratory
system. To construct the reference, we first calculated the
proportion of ACE2-positive lung AT2 cells from eight
individuals. For each individual, the clusters of lung AT2
cells were identified in accordance with the coexpression
of ACE2, SFTPB, and SFTPC genes (Fig. S1). The
average proportion of ACE2-positive AT2 cells among the
eight individuals was approximately 1% with 1% standard
derivation. We thus defined the cell types with a > 1%
proportion of ACE2 positive cells as high risk and those
with a < 1% proportion ACE2 positive cells as low risk.
Interestingly, the respiratory epithelial cells from the
respiratory track sample contained approximately 2%
ACE2 positive cells, and the respiratory track is thus
regarded as high risk (Fig. 1). However, almost no cell
obtained from the nasal and bronchial samples showed
high ACE2 expression (Figs. S2 and S3), and such samples
are therefore low risk.
Myocardial cells with high ACE2 expression
The scRNA-seq data from human heart showed that more
than 7.5% myocardial cells have positive ACE2 expression
(Fig. 2), thereby implying that heart could be in high risk of
2019-nCoV infection, especially in the presence of the
virus in blood or viremia.
Ileum and esophagus epithelial cells have high ACE2
expression
We explored the scRNA-seq data from the digestive
system, including esophagus, stomach, ileum, and liver.
Interestingly, extremely high ACE2 expression was found
in ileal epithelial cells (~30% ACE2-positive cells, Fig. 3);
thus, ileum could be at high risk. More than 1% ACE2
positive esophagus epithelial cells were found, and
esophagus can thus be regarded as high risk (Fig. 4). By
contrast, the cells from stomach and liver showed lower
ACE2 expression levels ( < 1% ACE2 positive cells, Figs.
S4 and S5).
Proximal tubule cells of kidney and bladder urothelial
cells express ACE2
We also analyzed the scRNA-seq data from the urinary
system, specifically kidney and bladder. Significantly high
ACE2 expression was found in kidney proximal tubule
(PT) cells with the proportion of ACE2-positive cells at
approximately 4% (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the proportion of

ACE2-positive cells in the bladder urothelial cells was
2.4% (Fig. 6). Therefore, kidney and bladder were
considered high risk, especially in viremia.
On the basis of the above findings, a 2019-nCoV
infection-related risk map of different organs can be
constructed (Fig. 7). As a clinical implication, lung should
be listed as having the highest risk. Interestingly, in
addition to lung AT2, more than 1% of the cell population
of some cell types from respiratory track, kidney,
esophagus, bladder, ileum, and heart also expressed
ACE2, and thus, those organs should be regarded as high
risk for potential 2019-nCoV infection. This finding may
explain the non-respiratory symptoms observed in 2019-
nCoV pneumonia patients.
Discussion
This study provides an overview of 2019-nCoV infectionrelated vulnerable organs using state-of-art single-cell
techniques. According to scRNA-seq datasets, we managed to stratify the organs into high and low risk on the basis
of their ACE2 expression levels in some cell types for the
first time. The reported clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV
infection (e.g., dyspnea, diarrhea, acute cardiac injury,
and kidney failure) might be related to the invasion of the
novel coronavirus in the lung, upper respiratory track,
ileum, heart, and kidney, especially in the presence of
viremia.
In this study, we identified the organs with high and low
vulnerability according to ACE2 expression. However, we
admit that the 2019-nCoV invasion is not just about ACE2,
and this observation means that our study may not have
exhausted all 2019-nCoV vulnerable organs. In addition,
given the gene expression variation between individuals,
further study is still required to exclude the susceptibility
of the organs categorized as low risk.
The mRNA expression of the receptor ACE2 indicates
the transcription of the gene in these tissues and relevant
cell types. To strengthen the expression pattern of ACE2,
we also analyzed the protein expression of ACE2 in the
stated human organs and cells by examining the Human
Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org), the UniProt
(https://www.uniprot.org) databases, and some literatures.
The resulting data showed that ACE2 protein is enriched in
the enterocytes of small intestine and the renal tubules,
as well as the lung alveolar epithelial cells, the heart cells,
the arterial smooth muscle cells, and the gastrointestinal

system, as confirmed by published reports [14–18].
Moreover, myocardial infarction may increase ACE2
expression in heart, thereby suggesting that ACE2
plays an important role in cardiac injury [19]. The
information on ACE2 protein expression is consistent
with our results and thus supports the predictive risk map
of different organs and tissues according to scRNA-seq
data.
