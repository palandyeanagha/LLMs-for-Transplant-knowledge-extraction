Abstract
Background and aims COVID-19 is a dominant pulmonary disease, with multisystem involvement, depending upon comorbidities. Its profle in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) is largely unknown. We studied the liver injury 
patterns of SARS-Cov-2 in CLD patients, with or without cirrhosis.
Methods Data was collected from 13 Asian countries on patients with CLD, known or newly diagnosed, with confrmed 
COVID-19.
Results Altogether, 228 patients [185 CLD without cirrhosis and 43 with cirrhosis] were enrolled, with comorbidities in 
nearly 80%. Metabolism associated fatty liver disease (113, 61%) and viral etiology (26, 60%) were common. In CLD without cirrhosis, diabetes [57.7% vs 39.7%, OR=2.1 (1.1–3.7), p=0.01] and in cirrhotics, obesity, [64.3% vs. 17.2%, OR=8.1 
(1.9–38.8), p=0.002] predisposed more to liver injury than those without these. Forty three percent of CLD without cirrhosis presented as acute liver injury and 20% cirrhotics presented with either acute-on-chronic liver failure [5 (11.6%)] or 
acute decompensation [4 (9%)]. Liver related complications increased (p<0.05) with stage of liver disease; a Child-Turcotte 
Pugh score of 9 or more at presentation predicted high mortality [AUROC 0.94, HR=19.2 (95 CI 2.3–163.3), p<0.001, 
sensitivity 85.7% and specifcity 94.4%). In decompensated cirrhotics, the liver injury was progressive in 57% patients, with 
43% mortality. Rising bilirubin and AST/ALT ratio predicted mortality among cirrhosis patients.
Conclusions SARS-Cov-2 infection causes signifcant liver injury in CLD patients, decompensating one ffth of cirrhosis, 
and worsening the clinical status of the already decompensated. The CLD patients with diabetes and obesity are more vulnerable and should be closely monitored.

Introduction
The pandemic of respiratory infection with Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
already infected 7 million people globally, leaving 4 lacs 
dead [1]. SARS-Cov-2 is an enveloped, non-segmented, 
positive-sense RNA virus belonging to β-coronavirus family [2] and causes fever, dry cough and breathing difculty, 
which can progress to respiratory distress due to interstitial 
pneumonia and multi-organ involvement [3, 4]. The latter 
is due to systemic infammation leading to a cytokine storm 
and immune dysfunction often with features of macrophage 
activation syndrome, as evidenced by hyperferritinaemia, 
hepatic dysfunction and difuse intravascular coagulation 
[5]. Viral entry is through the ACE-2 receptor; high expression of which is noted in type II alveolar cells, enterocytes, 
cholangiocytes, myocardial cells and proximal tubule cells 
of kidney, predisposing the concerned organs to the risk of 
developing complications [6, 7].
Deranged liver functions, mainly raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
have been reported in 14–53% patients without known liver 
disease [8, 9]. Patients with severe disease showed higher 
frequency and degree of liver dysfunction while in milder 
cases, the liver injury was transient [10]. The mechanisms 
of hepatic injury include immune-mediated infammation, 
hypoxic injury due to severe pneumonia and drug related 
[11]. It is also postulated that expression of ACE2 receptor 
on cholangiocytes may predispose to cholestatic injury [12]. 
Data on post-mortem liver biopsies is limited and demonstrates moderate microvascular steatosis and mild lobular 
and portal activity [13].
The acute insult in COVID-19 is systemic and it may progress to involve other systems. Comorbidities like diabetes, 
hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease and chronic 
liver disease (CLD) co-exist in general population, more so 
in middle aged and elderly [8, 14]. While the true burden 
of liver disease is not known; these accounted for 4.6% of 
all deaths [15]. In fact, liver diseases contribute global disease burden in the form of metabolism associated liver disease (MAFLD), alcohol-associated liver disease and viral 
hepatitis [16]. Hence, during COVID-19 pandemic, it is very 
likely that CLD patients would be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Moreover, many cirrhotic patients are required 
to attend hospitals regularly and thus become susceptible 
to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 
infection produces lymphocytopenia with or without leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and raised fbrinogen degradation 
products [5, 8, 17], which pre-exist in CLD patients due to 
bone marrow suppression and cirrhosis associated immune 
dysfunction syndrome (CAIDS) [18].
Acute liver injury in healthy individuals has been reported 
in a few studies. However, the impact of SARS-Cov-2 infection on pre-existing CLD, compensated and decompensated 
cirrhosis is largely unknown. While in the presence of normal liver synthetic function, rise in liver enzymes with or 
without jaundice may be transitory and recover spontaneously. However, whether SARS-Cov-2 infection can infict 
serious and prolonged liver injury in patients of CLD and 
may aggravate already compromised hepatic synthetic functions leading to development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), acute decompensation (AD) in a cirrhotic liver 
or, worsening of prior decompensated liver disease is not 
known [19]. The severity and incidence of kidney injury, 
secondary infections, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding and mortality, also needs to be known in a 
large-cohort. The Asia Pacifc Association for the Study of 
the Liver (APASL) launched a pan-Asia collaborative study 
“APASL COVID Liver Injury Spectrum (APCOLIS, clinical trial identifer NCT04345640). The aim is to study the 
spectrum of liver injury, complications of liver disease and 
COVID-19 related complications in relation to pre-existing 
liver disease and its spectrum with SARS CoV2 infection.
Patients and methods
Study design
Data was collected on a web-based performa of COVID-19 
patients, seen in Asia, between January to April 2020, under 
the APASL COVID-19 task force with the help of APASL 
ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) a multinational registry. Institutional ethics committee approval was obtained 
[NCT04345640]. All authors had access to the study data, 
and had the opportunity to review and approve the fnal 
manuscript.
Patients
Admitted patients with COVID-19, 18 years or above, 
were considered for data source. Patients with known 
or newly diagnosed CLD or cirrhosis and infected with 
SARS-Cov-2 were included in the analysis. The presenting

complaints, laboratory parameters, clinical events and 
survival outcome till day 28 were obtained. The primary 
objective was to determine the clinical presentation, biochemical alterations, complications and survival outcome 
of SARS-Cov-2 infection in the whole spectrum of CLD. 
The secondary objectives were to compare the pattern 
of liver injury in relation to existing synthetic functions, 
COVID-19 disease severity and infuence of comorbidities. We also analyzed the predictors of severity of liver 
injury and infuence of etiology on outcomes. The primary 
end point was death or complete recovery from COVID19. Secondary end points were severity of disease, liver 
injury profle, complications related to liver disease and 
in relation to COVID-19.
Diagnosis of COVID-19 Confrmation of SARS-CoV-2 
infection was achieved as per guidelines [20], with proper 
extraction of nucleic acids from the respiratory sample followed by RT-PCR assay for virus detection.
Treatment Individualized antiviral or drug therapy protocol given at respective centres was collected. Generally, 
isolation for asymptomatic cases, hydroxychloroquine with 
azithromycin and antiviral drugs (oseltamivir, remdesivir, 
favipravir, lopinavir+ritonavir) at admission in mild and 
moderate cases was practiced. The moderate and severe 
cases received antibiotics, convalescent plasma, steroid in 
form of intravenous methylprednisolone or IVIG, in case 
to case basis. Decisions included fuid management, vasopressors, high fow nasal cannula (HNFC) at 10L, and noninvasive or invasive ventilation as per standard protocols.
The liver specifc treatment was considered as per the 
complications. The nutrition, management of HE, acute 
variceal bleed and ascites was similar to that for cirrhotics. 
Acute kidney injury (AKI) was managed initially with terlipressin and albumin, upon failure of which renal replacement therapy was considered with SLED (Sustained Low 
Efciency Dialysis). Therapeutic plasmapheresis was done 
in a few cases with worsening jaundice, coagulopathy in 
absence of overt sepsis. The patients were declared cured 
as per the WHO test based defnition. Detailed clinical data 
was collected during hospitalization, at discharge and till a 
follow up of 28 days.
Severity of COVID-19 This was done based upon the triaging and treatment protocols [21]:
I. Asymptomatic the testing and confrmation was done 
only for those having contact, travel history but no 
symptoms.
II. Mild with fever, cough, fatigue, loose motions and 
other non-specifc complaints.
III. Severe with severe pneumonia (i.e.SpO2 < 93% 
despite high-fow nasal cannula O2 or respiratory 
rates>30 per minute), features of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney, heart or circulatory failure, altered sensorium or combination of 
above.
Acute liver injury (ALI) Defned as any one of the following (i) Jaundice with a total bilirubin level of≥3 mg/dl, 
(ii) Acute increase in ALT, AST, SAP, GGT≥2 times upper 
normal limit, (iii) PT-INR of≥1.5 with a previously normal 
liver parameters.
New onset acute liver injury Defned as those fulflling 
the above defnition of ALI which developed during hospital 
stay, but was not there at presentation.
Acute kidney injury increase in serum creatinine levels to 
1.5 times of baseline or greater, within 7 days; or absolute 
value of≥1.5 mg/dl or urine volume of<0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h.
Chronic liver disease without cirrhosis Case of chronic 
hepatitis B or C, MAFLD and Autoimmune Hepatitis diagnosed previously or during current admission with advanced 
fbrosis, by liver biopsy or transient elastography within last 
6 months.
Cirrhosis Patients with clinical features and imaging/
endoscopy suggestive of chronic liver disease and portal 
hypertension or a previously diagnosed case of cirrhosis.
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) Acute hepatic 
insult manifesting as jaundice and coagulopathy, complicated within 4 weeks by ascites and/or encephalopathy, in a 
patient with previously diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic 
liver disease associated with high 4 week mortality [19].
Acute decompensation (AD) Acute development of jaundice (bilirubin>3 mg/dl), large ascites (grade ii–iii), hepatic 
encephalopathy, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or sepsis, or 
any combination of these occurring in a period of 90 days 
before presentation.
Overall complications The presence of AKI with or without need of renal replacement therapy, hypotension or shock, 
altered sensorium, respiratory distress (as defned in severe 
ARDS) or need of mechanical ventilation and liver related 
complications.
Liver related complications Development of complications like worsening of jaundice (bilirubin>3 mg/dl), 
worsening or development of new ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, acute variceal bleed and spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis.
Data collection and statistical analysis
The retrospectively collected data was analysed as groups 
i.e. patients having CLD without cirrhosis, those having cirrhosis with or without decompensation, those with or without acute liver injury during COVID-19 infection. Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean±SD or median (IQR). 
The Student’s t-test for continuous data, Fisher’s exact 
test or Pearson’s Chi-square test for categorical data and 
Kaplan–Meier curve with long-rank test was considered for

survival outcomes. AUROC was used to derive the applicability and cut-of for CTP score to predict mortality. The 
proportional risk between the groups was calculated as odds 
ratio. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and a signifcance 
level (p) of 0.05 was used. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS.
Results
We present the data obtained from 13 Asian countries and 62 
investigators on the spectrum of liver injury and outcomes 
in CLD patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. Present study 
included 408 confrmed COVID-19 cases, of which 175 had 
no evidence of chronic liver disease and another 5 had inadequate data. (Fig. 1). Altogether, 228 CLD patients were 
therefore included; 43 (18.9%) with cirrhosis (including 18 
decompensated cirrhosis) and 185 (81.1%) without cirrhosis.
Profle of patients of CLD with or without cirrhosis 
exposed to SARS‑CoV‑2 infection
The patients were mostly in the ffth or sixth decade with 
high rates of comorbidities. CLD without cirrhosis had male 
preponderance (57.8% versus 41.9%, p=0.01) with MAFLD 
being more common (61.1% versus 32.5%, p=0.003). The 
symptoms, laboratory parameters including leukocyte and 
platelet count and the severity of COVID-19 (18.6% versus 
11.8%, p=0.14) were comparable (Table 1).
More patients of cirrhosis had acute liver injury at admission (32.6% vs 20%, p<0.001) and also developed new 
onset liver injury in-hospital (39.5% versus 7%, p<0.001) 
who had no ALI at presentation. The ALI occurred in 40% 
of those without cirrhosis, but without decompensation. The 
ALI caused decompensation in 20.7% of cirrhotics, 9.1% 
developed AD and 11.6% ACLF.
COVID-19 related complications, i.e. acute kidney injury 
(18.6% versus 5.4%, p<0.001), respiratory failure (23.2% 
versus 8.6%, p<0.001) and hypotension (14% versus 3.8%, 
p<0.001) were more common in cirrhotics than CLD without cirrhosis. Those with cirrhosis needed more ICU care 
Fig. 1 Flow diagram. Enrolment of patients and acute liver injury. 
Acute liver injury was seen at presentation in 20% of CLD without 
cirrhosis, 16% of compensated and 55.6% of decompensated cirrhosis. Further acute liver injury was noted in 32.4% of those without 
cirrhosis and in 48% of compensated cirrhosis. Where as among the 
decompensated cirrhotics 27% had new onset acute liver injury

(25.6% versus 12.4%, p<0.001), developed higher liver 
related complications (32.6% versus 14.1, p=0.007) leading 
to higher mortality (16.3% versus 2.7%, p=0.002).
Profle of Cirrhosis with or without decompensation 
exposed to SARS‑CoV‑2 infection
The present study had 43 cirrhosis patients; 18 (41.8%) with 
prior decompensation, 16 (37.2%) with Child B and 3 (9%) 
with Child C. Most common etiology was viral (26, 60.5%), 
followed by MAFLD (14, 32.6%), alcohol (2, 4.7%) and 
autoimmune hepatitis (1, 2.3%) [Table S1].
Severe COVID-19 was more common among decompensated [33.3% versus 8%, OR=5.5 (1.1–44.3), p=0.02] with 
higher complications, i.e. acute kidney injury (33.3% versus 
8%, p=0.02), respiratory failure (50% versus 4%, p<0.001) 
and circulatory failure (27.8% versus 4%, p=0.02). Decompensated cirrhotics had more liver injury [71.4% versus 
13.8%, OR=6.2 (1.55–29.13), p<0.001] at presentation. 
The liver related [44.4% versus 24%, OR=3.24 (0.88–12.5), 
p=0.08] and overall complications were more in decompensated cirrhosis with greater need for ICU care and higher 
mortality [OR=11.3 (1.5–288.1), p=0.008].
SARS‑CoV‑2 infection related liver injury 
and outcome in CLD without cirrhosis
The liver injury in CLD patients without cirrhosis was noted 
more in those with severe COVID-19 [18% versus 5.7%, 
OR=3.76 (1.38–11.8), p=0.004]. Patients of CLD with 
diabetes had higher risk [57.7% versus 39.7%, p =0.01, 
OR=2.061.14–3.73)] of liver injury. Patients with liver 
injury, needed more ICU admissions (20.6% versus 3.4%, 
p<0.001) with higher liver related (24.7% versus 2.3%, 
p<0.001) and overall complications [39.2% versus 6.8%, 
p<0.001). However, the recovery, hospital stay and associated mortality were comparable among those with or without liver injury (Table 2).
SARS‑CoV‑2 infection related liver injury 
and outcome in cirrhosis
The acute liver injury was seen in 14 (32.6%) patients 
(Table 3). The age, gender or presence of diabetes were comparable, but the risk of liver injury was more with diabetes 
(64.3% versus 17.2%, p=0.002). Those with liver injury had 
higher CTP, MELD score and were often decompensated 
(55.6% versus 8%, p<0.001) and had also contracted more 
severe COVID-19 disease [42.8% versus 6.9%, OR=9.5 
(1.7–79.5)]. The COVID-19 related complications, such 
as renal, respiratory or circulatory failure were higher 
among cirrhotics with liver injury and required more ICU

care (42.8% versus 3.4%, p=0.001) with higher mortality 
(42.8% versus 6.9%, p 0.03). The liver related complications, 
i.e. worsening of jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, 
variceal bleed and SBP happened more with COVID-19 
related liver injury irrespective of decompensation.
Degree of liver injury over time and predictors 
of mortality
The liver injury may be evident at presentation or develop 
and progress during the course of infection. The AST/ALT 
ratio, total bilirubin and R value (ALT/ALP ratio) were helpful in predicting survival in cirrhotics (Fig. S1). The nonsurvivors had higher AST, and an AST/ALT ratio of>1.4 
[AUROC 0.95, HR =1.4 (95 CI 2.5–5.4), p =0.02] predicted mortality among cirrhotics. The mean total bilirubin 
remained elevated to>9 mg/dl till death in non-survivors. 
They also had a low R value [p=0.02]. The liver injury 
occurred more towards the end of second week or early third 
week in non-cirrhotics (Fig. S2), but was evident at presentation or developed in the frst week in cirrhotic patients.
The mortality was comparable among non-cirrhotics 
and compensated cirrhosis, despite more complications, 
liver injury and liver related complications in the later. This 
underscores the concept of adequacy of available hepatic 
reserve for recovery. It was further substantiated by the fact 
that decompensated cirrhosis had nearly twice the mortality 
seen in compensated cirrhosis [33% vs. 16.3%, OR=2.5 (95 
CI 0.7–9.4) p=0.05]. The CTP score at presentation can 
predict survival in a cirrhosis [AUROC 0.94, sensitivity 86% 
and specifcity of 94%] and a score above 8 showed high 
mortality (85.7%, HR=19.2 (95 CI 2.3–163.3), p<0.001) 
(Fig. 2).
Discussion
The results of this large multinational study, including a 
cohort of 228 patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection produces 
acute liver injury in 43% of CLD patients without cirrhosis. 
Additionally, 20% of compensated cirrhosis patients develop 
either ACLF or acute decompensation. Liver related complications were seen in nearly half of the decompensated 
cirrhotics, which were of greater severity and with higher 
mortality.
The median age of presentation was sixth decade, but 
age above 60 years was not a poor prognostic factor in 
presence of liver disease. Comorbidities like MAFLD, 
obesity and diabetes were present in nearly 80% of the 
patients. Presence of obesity is known to increase the risk 
of liver injury [22]. We observed that obese cirrhotics had 
more acute liver injury than normal weight patients [OR 
8.9 (95 CI=1.9–38.8) p=0.02], with higher complication 
rates. Also, CLD patients with diabetes had more acute 
liver injury [OR 2.1 (95 CI=1.1–3.73), p=0.01]. Higher 
incidence of ALI has also been reported in diabetics without liver disease [23]. In the present study, MAFLD was 
the commonest cause for CLD without cirrhosis, whereas 
hepatitis B was common in cirrhotics [24]. Interestingly, 
alcohol was found to be a less frequent cause of CLD in 
Asian patients infected with SARS-Co-V2.
SARS-Co-V2 infection related injury is systemic and 
can be more common and severe in immunocompromised 
individuals [14]. Presence of CAIDS can predispose CLD 
patients to severe infection [18]. The acute liver injury 
was more common and severe in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, indicating correlation between the degree 
of CAIDS and synthetic functions of liver. Liver injury in 
COVID-19 is multifactorial. It could be due to the hypoxic 
injury in patients with severe pneumonia [25] or intense 
cytokine storm with severe infection [26], or due to the 
drugs used as therapeutic agents [27].
The pattern of liver injury in the CLD patients was suggestive of a dominant hepatocellular injury [28] as serum 
ALT levels were higher than the AST levels among noncirrhotics. Interestingly, the liver injury pattern was different in cirrhotic patients. A rapid and early worsening 
of jaundice and higher AST than ALT and low R value 
was seen in cirrhotic patients, more so in those who did 
not survive. This indicates that liver injury in cirrhosis is 
either drug induced or hypoxia related [12, 27, 29]. There 
was only an insignifcant rise in serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamyl transferase, indicating limited virus related injury to liver due to the over expression 
of ACE2 on cholangiocytes. However, more histological 
and experimental studies are required to ascertain this.
While mild derangements in the liver functions are 
expected in systemic infections, the term ALI is used to 
diferentiate more severe liver injury. We defned ALI with 
serum bilirubin of 3 mg/dl or above and liver enzymes 
raised at least 2 times upper limit of normal. Similar criteria for ALI were used in COVID-19 earlier [5, 27]. Our 
study supports the concept of ALI even in patients with 
CLD and compensated cirrhosis. However, its relevance 
for development of complications and mortality would 
require a larger cohort of patients with diferent etiologies.

A correlation between hepatic reserve and liver synthetic functions was observed in development of liver 
related complications from COVID-19. The liver injury 
occurred towards the third week in CLD patients without 
cirrhosis, but developed within the frst week in cirrhotics. 
The late trend of injury in CLD without cirrhosis has also 
been reported recently [28]. The fact that cirrhosis patients 
may have a more serious injury, one should be careful in the 
choice of antiviral agents. We could not ascertain the role 
of antivirals, azithromycin and hydroxycholorquine, used in 
nearly one third of the patients, due to multiple mechanisms 
of liver injuries in cirrhotics.
Signifcant liver failure in the form of ACLF or acute 
decompensation was seen in 20% of the cirrhotic patients. 
This observation adds a new dimension to the existing literature on COVID-19. The data indicates that non-hepatotropic 
infections, such as SARS CoV2, can directly precipitate a 
hepatic injury severe enough to cause liver failure in cirrhotic patients [30].
The present study has the limitation of non-availability of 
histological data for identifying those with mild or advanced 
fbrosis. The COVID-19 related complications leading to 
liver related complications is not well known in absence 
of biopsy, however in the era of pandemic and the recent 
worsening with SARS CoV2 infection suggest a temporal 
association. However, this was not possible in the current 
state of the spreading pandemic, especially in the absence of 
an efective antiviral or hepato-protective agent.
In summary, pre-existing liver disease is an added risk in 
severe COVID-19. Liver related complications, overall complications and outcomes correlate with the existing hepatic 
reserve. Acute liver injury is more severe and progressive 
in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and is associated 
with high mortality. Comorbidities like diabetes, obesity 
Fig. 2 COVID-19 and Spectrum of CLD. a The incidence of severe 
disease due to COVID-19 increases progressively among non-cirrhotics to compensated to decompensated cirrhosis (p=0.03) as 
the synthetic function decreased. b There is similar trend for acute 
liver injury (p=0.02). c The mortality increased with SARS CoV2 
infection signifcantly among cirrhotics than those without cirrhosis 
(p<0.001) and with decompensation. The mortality is highest (43%) 
in the spectrum with onset of liver injury. d Among cirrhosis those 
exposed to SARS CoV2 infection, the outcome is poor with CTP 
score 9 or more [AUROC 0.94, sensitivity 86% and specifcity of 
94%, HR=19.2 (95 CI 2.3–163.3), p<0.001]

and MAFLD do aggravate the risk of liver injury. Hence, 
patients with COVID-19 disease having chronic liver disease 
should be properly attended to, prioritized in management 
and duly prognosticated. These facts assume immediate relevance as at present, liver transplant services in most countries are either on hold or are available only for acute liver 
failure patients.
