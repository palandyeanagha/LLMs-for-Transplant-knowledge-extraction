Introduction
Sepsis is an infl ammatory condition arising from a dysregulated host response to infection [1]. It is clinically 
manifest in a highly heterogeneous manner ranging from 
relatively mild features of systemic infl ammation through 
to severe sepsis and shock where organ function is 
signifi cantly compromised. Th e extrapolated population 
incidence of severe sepsis from national epidemiological 
studies varies between 51 and 153 per 100,000 population 
and carries a hospital mortality of 20 to 52% [2]. Survival 
rates have improved yet the overall incidence and the 
total number of associated hospital deaths continue to 
rise, in part due to increased recognition but also due to 
increasingly aggressive healthcare interventions in an 
ageing population [3,4]. Many factors infl uence outcomes 
from sepsis, ranging from patient-intrinsic factors, such 
as genetic polymorphisms and co-morbidities, through 
to environmental factors, such as critical care resource 
availability [5]. Sepsis thus remains a challenging and 
impor tant condition to both diagnose and treat, especially as it carries a high risk of death, of short- and longterm morbidity, and a substantial healthcare burden [6].
Well-established clinical and biochemical criteria are 
used to defi ne sepsis and organ dysfunction [1], yet these 
fail to adequately diff erentiate the individual, multifaceted 
host response to infection and the complex interplay 
between neural, immune, hormonal, circulatory, coagulation, metabolic and bioenergetic systems [7,8]. While 
modulating the early host response to infection to protect 
organ function is a well-worn concept [9], so is the 
recognition that such therapies do not address the multisystem interactions that characterize the septic process 
[10]. Th e many clinical therapeutic failures witnessed to 
date relate to an over-extrapolation of fi ndings derived 
from laboratory models [11,12], and an ongoing inability 
to accurately delineate the host response in clinical 
practice and thus determine the optimal timing, dosing 
and duration of an intervention [13].
An eff ective intervention should reduce the burden of 
illness associated with sepsis. Th is may be achieved 
through boosting cellular protection, enhancing the 
Abstract
Sepsis represents a dysregulated host response to 
infection, the extent of which determines the severity 
of organ dysfunction and subsequent outcome. All 
trialled immunomodulatory strategies to date have 
resulted in either outright failure or inconsistent 
degrees of success. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) 
therapy falls into the latter category with opinion still 
divided as to its utility. This article provides a narrative 
review of the biological rationale for using IVIg in 
sepsis. A literature search was conducted using the 
PubMed database (1966 to February 2011). The strategy 
included the following text terms and combinations of 
these: IVIg, intravenous immune globulin, intravenous 
immunoglobulin, immunoglobulin, immunoglobulin 
therapy, pentaglobin, sepsis, infl ammation, immune 
modulation, apoptosis. Preclinical and extrapolated 
clinical data of IVIg therapy in sepsis suggests improved 
bacterial clearance, inhibitory eff ects upon upstream 
mediators of the host response (for example, the 
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor), 
scavenging of downstream infl ammatory mediators 
(for example, cytokines), direct anti-infl ammatory 
eff ects mediated via Fcγ receptors, and a potential 
ability to attenuate lymphocyte apoptosis and thus 
sepsis-related immunosuppression. Characterizing the 
trajectory of change in immunoglobulin levels during 
sepsis, understanding mechanisms contributing to 
these changes, and undertaking IVIg dose-fi nding 
studies should be performed prior to further largescale interventional trials to enhance the likelihood of a 
successful outcome.

reso lu tion of infl ammation, accelerating recovery processes or, if eff ected early enough, by primary targeting of 
‘upstream’ mediators (such as signalosomes and infl amma somes) that trigger the excessive activation or 
suppres sion of ‘downstream’ mediators and multi-system 
pathways such as cytokines and the complement system. 
Particularly with regard to the latter strategy, it is unlikely 
that the patient with severe sepsis will present early 
enough for successful therapeutic administration of a 
drug modulating a single upstream pathway. Far greater 
utility is likely to be gained through a cocktail approach, 
or by using agents with multiple modes of action. Prime 
examples of multi-modal stand-alone agents for severe 
sepsis and septic shock are corticosteroids and polyvalent 
intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg).
After a brief review of relevant sepsis biology, this 
article will focus upon immunoglobulins and their receptors, the potential benefi cial eff ects of IVIg therapy in 
modulating the host response to infection, and an 
overview of the possible reasons for the limited success 
to date of clinical trials.
Overview of sepsis pathobiology
Initiation of host response
Th e initial host response to infection involves over lapping, 
interlinked phases of innate pathogen and damage 
recognition. Microbial infection results in release of (i) 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), that is, 
conserved molecular structures expressed by the microbe 
species, and (ii) damage-associated molecular patterns 
(DAMPs), that is, extracellular matrix compo nents and 
intracellular constituents (for example, mito chondria, 
DNA, S100 proteins) released due to local tissue damage 
or immune cell activation [14]. PAMPs and DAMPs are 
recognised as danger signals by pattern recognition 
receptors on the surface of immune, epi thelial, endothelial 
and parenchymal cells. Th is early innate response aims to 
limit systemic dissemination of infection, allowing slower 
though immunologically more potent and focused 
adaptive immune pathways to develop [15].
Host responses to ‘danger signals’
Infection and/or tissue damage can trigger a dysregulated 
and systemic infl ammatory response through multi-point 
activation of genes transcribing for pro-infl ammatory 
mediators and receptors. Th ese act via infl ammasomes 
and signalosomes - ‘upstream’ mediators of the host 
response [16,17]. Infl ammasomes are multimeric protein 
complexes generated in response to distress signals from 
PAMPs and DAMPs that act as primary initiators of the 
innate host response (for example, NLR-NOD proteins) 
[17-19]. Signalosomes are molecular complexes that 
mediate phosphorylation and poly-ubiquitination of 
inhibitory kinase complexes (for example, IκB), thereby 
releasing activated transcription factors that enter the 
nucleus and increase transcription of target genes 
involved in the infl ammatory response. Th ese include 
genes encoding downstream mediators such as cytokines, 
chemokines, adhesion factors, nitric oxide synthase, 
tissue factor and cyclo-oxygenase pathways [17,20-22]. 
Th is complex ‘downstream’ response could be conceptualised as being generated and amplifi ed from an 
infl ammatory hub consisting of high mobility group B-1 
protein (HMGB-1), complement factors, macrophage 
migration inhibitory factor, IL-17 and other mediators. 
Both upstream and downstream mediators and networks 
are interlinked, impairing cellular bioenergetic and metabolic function at multiple levels, and resulting in organ 
dysfunction [7,23-25] (Figure  1). Th ese changes also 
aff ect innate immune cell function, thereby impairing 
bacterial clearance [26,27].
Th e host responses described above involve concomitant activation of pro- and anti-infl ammatory pathways. 
Th e balance of the host response shifts towards predominantly anti-infl ammatory pathways later on in 
critical illness. While this results in an overall immune 
anergy [28,29], some immune cell types remain hyperresponsive, underlying the complexity of the condition.
Emerging literature on viral reactivation following 
acute pro-infl ammatory critical illnesses provides further 
evidence that immunosuppression is a key sequela in 
sepsis and critical illness. Th is is likely related to T-cell 
defects, leading onto macrophage dysfunction [30,31]. 
Other causes for immune anergy include (but are not 
limited to) enhanced regulatory T-cell activity [32], activa tion of anti-infl ammatory phenotypes in infl ammatory 
cells [28,33], and activation of apoptotic pathways [34]. 
At present, anergy is considered primarily due to 
lymphocyte and dendritic cell loss.
Immunoglobulin physiology
Immunoglobulins (Ig) are glycoprotein molecules produced by plasma cells. B lymphocytes that are activated 
and propagated in a T-cell-dependent manner are the 
precursors of high-affi nity antibody-secreting plasma 
cells [35]. T-cell-independent pathways can also generate 
plasma cells, including those secreting naturally occurring antibodies.
Each Ig molecule monomer consists of identical heavy 
(50 to 70  kDa) and light chain pairs (23  kDa) held 
together by electrostatic forces and disulphide bonds. 
Each heavy chain consists of amino acid sequence regions 
(three to four constant, one variable) that fold into 
globular regions called domains. Within each variable 
region of heavy chains and light chains there are three 
hypervariable or complementarity-determining regions 
that determine antibody specifi city. Th e combined variable and constant regions of the heavy and light chains

form the antigen-binding region on the Fab. Amino acid 
sequences in the remainder of the two constant regions 
of the heavy chains, the Fc, determine the immunoglobulin class and subclass, and therefore its functional 
capability.
Th e large diversity of antigenic epitopes are recognised 
by the variable region of the Ig molecules. Th is is a 
function of the adaptive immune system. Binding of Ig 
results in many diverse antigens being signalled through 
a small number of Ig isotypes. Based on their heavy chain 
characteristic, Ig isotypes are classifi ed into G, A, M, D 
and E [36,37].
Fcγ receptors
Ig mediate their immunomodulatory and predominantly 
anti-infl ammatory eff ects through Fcγ receptors (FcγRs). 
Th ere are six human FcγRs encoded by genes on 
chromosome 1, FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, FcγRIIC, 
FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIIB [38]. FcγRs bind to Ig and to the 
pentraxin family of immune mediators that includes Creactive protein and serum amyloid P (SAP). Pentraxins 
activate the classical complement pathway and compete 
with Ig for FcγR binding, thereby activating immune 
cells. Pentraxin-opsonized pathogens are phagocytosed 
by immune cells via FcγR pathways [39].
Th e distribution of receptors on immune cells and their 
affi nity to IgG diff ers between FcγRs (Table 1) [38,40-43]. 
FcγRs can be either activating or inhibitory depending on 
their inclusion or association with either the activating 
(immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM)) 
or inhibitory (ITIM) motifs in their cytoplasmic domains. 
Bacterial infection increases FcγR expression on innate 
and adaptive immune cells. FcγRI is the only high-affi nity 
receptor that can bind to circulating monomeric IgG, 
while all low-affi nity receptors only interact with immune 
complexes for signal transduction [44,45].
Figure 1. Invading pathogens have pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and tissue injury generates damage-associated 
molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are recognised by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Interaction of PRRs with PAMPs/DAMPs initiates 
the cellular activation that characterises host response in sepsis syndromes. Infl ammasomes and signalosomes generated from these initiator 
pathways provide the feedback amplifi er loops perpetuating host response. This unregulated multi-system activation involves infl ammatory 
pathways, cytokines, coagulation, inducible nitric oxide pathways, the autonomic nervous system and the immune system. This is manifested 
biologically as microvascular failure, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic changes - surrogates of severity of organ dysfunction in sepsis.

All FcγRs except FcγRIIB are stimulatory (that is, 
associated with the ITAM cytoplasmic domain) and 
therefore activate immune cells following IgG- or pentraxinprotein or immune complex binding. Aggregation of 
ITAMs results in phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines and 
stimulates multiple downstream activation pathways 
[46]. By contrast, FcγRIIB is associated with the ITIM 
cytoplasmic domain with phosphorylation of tyrosines in 
ITIMs resulting in attenuation of activation pathway 
activity [46].
The level of FcγRIIB-related activity compared to 
other FcγR activity (that is, those associated with 
ITAM domains) plays a key role in balancing the proand anti-inflammatory humoral pathways in sepsis 
[47,48]. It is biologically plausible that Ig modulates 
innate and adaptive immune effector activity essential 
for bacterial clearance by altering the balance between 
ITAM and ITIM activity via FcγRs; this equilibrium 
may be potentially influenced favourably with IVIg 
therapy [40].
Other receptors
Another receptor involved in IgG pathways is the 
neonatal FcR (FcRn). Th is belongs to the family of major 
histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules but is not 
involved in antigen presentation. Its primary roles are to 
maintain constant IgG and albumin concentrations and 
to prolong the half-life of IgG and albumin through 
endosome-to-cell surface recycling. FcRn-mediated pathways are important in maintaining the serum retention of 
native and infused IgG preparations [42]. Other receptors 
for Ig molecules include the tripartite motif-containing 
(TRIM) protein family, some members of which appear 
to be particularly important in the response to viral 
infections [49].
Polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulins
IVIg is a blood product prepared from a pool of more 
than 1,000 donors (frequently more than 10,000 donors), 
thus providing a broad spectrum of opsonic and neutralizing IgG antibodies against a variety of microbial 
antigens and multiple epitopes. Opsonic and neutralizing 
IgG antibody content varies with each product batch, 
primarily due to diff erences in the local pathogen ecology 
of donor exposure. IgG and complement proteins are the 
principal classes of opsonins contributing to bacterial 
clear ance (amongst other opsonins such as C-reactive 
protein). Only one product, Pentaglobulin® (Biotest, 
Germany), is IgM-enriched. Th e principal manufacturing 
process in all current Ig preparations is cold ethanol 
fractionation with product-specifi c additional processes 
for manufacturing. Th e commonest processes for virus 
reduction include solvents/detergents, low pH (pH 4)

The biological rationale for administering IVIg in 
sepsis
Th e biological rationale for IVIg therapy in sepsis can be 
summarized into four main categories: (i) its role in 
pathogen recognition, clearance and toxin scavenging, (ii) 
scavenging and inhibition of ‘upstream mediator’ gene 
transcription, (iii) scavenging and inhibition of infl ammatory ‘downstream mediator’ gene transcription, and (iv) 
non-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic immune cell eff ects.
Role in pathogen recognition, clearance and toxin 
scavenging
PAMPs are recognised by naturally occurring antibodies 
that can also act as innate immune receptors. IgG and the 
complement proteins are the principal opsonins for 
bacterial clearance. Th e classical pathway is activated by 
C1 complex interaction with Ig, acute phase proteins and 
various non-specifi c activators [50]. Th e C1q mole cule 
within the C1 complex contains a multimeric globular 
ligand detection domain with the ability to bind IgG and 
IgM Fc regions, and hence detect a large spec trum of 
antigens. Binding of C1q to IgG1 or IgM leads to potent 
activation of the classical complement pathway, thereby 
generating C4b2a (recently renamed as C4b2b), the 
classical pathway C3 convertase [50,51]. IgG com bines 
with C3b and this opsonisation facilitates phago cytosis 
[52].
Human neutrophils express multiple cell surface Fcγ 
receptors that bind IgG. Th ese receptors are constitutive 
(for example, FcγRIIa (CD32), FcγRIIIb (CD16) [53]) or 
inducible (FcγR1 (CD64)). IgG binding to these receptors 
results in neutrophil activation via tyrosine kinase 
pathways. Activated neutrophils upregulate expression of 
adhesion, chemoattractant and phagocytic receptors that 
identify and phagocytose pathogens opsonised with 
complement proteins and IgG [54-57]. Neutrophil activation and phagocytosis signals may be suboptimal in IgGdefi cient patients with sepsis; this population may be an 
‘ideal’ cohort for IVIg supplementation to augment early 
bacterial clearance. IVIg also contains anti-siglec-9 
antibodies and their anti-idiotypes that reduce neutrophil 
loss in early sepsis [58-60].
Severe sepsis is associated with a decrease in circulating 
immunoglobulin levels [61-64]. Th ree-quarters of patients 
admitted with community-acquired pneumonia and 
shock had hypogammaglobulinaemia, of whom three 
quarters had low levels of IgG. Hypogammaglobulinaemic 
patients had a signifi cantly longer duration of shock and 
a higher incidence of severe lung injury [61]. Patients 
from the Score-Based Immunoglobulin G Th erapy of 
patients with sepsis (SBITs) study demonstrated a wide 
distribution in IgG levels, although in this study low 
levels did not carry any prognostic signifi cance [62,63]. 
Furthermore, in a recent observational study of patients 
enrolled within day 1 or 2 of presentation with septic 
shock, 61% had IgG levels below the lower limit for agematched reference values. Th is hypogammaglobulinaemia 
was transient and also had no prognostic signifi cance 
[64].
Role in scavenging toxins
Superantigen exotoxins released by staphylococci and 
streptococci activate T cells [65,66]. IVIg preparations 
contain inhibitory or neutralising IgG molecules against 
superantigens, and these inhibit superantigen-mediated 
T-cell and monocyte activation [67,68]. In addition, IVIg 
preparations have also been shown to inhibit superantigen-induced cytokine production and lymphocyte 
proliferation, that is, independent of the presence of 
neutralising antibodies [69]. Of note, toxin neutralisation 
is profoundly infl uenced not only by the antigen-binding 
activity of the antibodies within IVIg, but also by the Fc 
region of the IgG molecules, so the balance of IgG 
isotypes within the anti-toxin response is also critical 
[70]. IVIg therapy has been shown to be benefi cial in 
toxin-mediated bacterial diseases and shock syndromes 
[71,72], although the results are inconsistent [73]. IVIg 
preparations, in particular IgM-enriched preparations, 
contain antibodies against lipopolysaccharides of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. [74].
Acquired hypogammaglobulinaemia may prevent 
optimal pathogen clearance and pathogen toxin 
scavenging, thereby perpetuating the sepsis response. As 
immunoglobulin levels in health vary signifi cantly, 
interpretation of single-time point determinations of 
immunoglobulin concentration in the context of sepsis 
pathobiology is a key challenge. By relating the temporal 
profi le of Ig concentrations to the trajectory and severity 
of sepsis, a high-risk sepsis cohort may be potentially 
identifi ed for stratifi ed IVIg intervention. However, the 
reasons underlying these temporal changes are currently 
unclear. Altered distribution due to endothelial dysfunction and capillary leak [17], an iatrogenic fl uid resuscitation-related increase in extravascular volume with 
dilution of Ig [64,75], decreased production and/or 
increased consumption may be implicated, as could 
altera tions in FcRn activity resulting in impaired recycling [76]. All the above knowledge gaps need addressing, 
ideally prior to further clinical trials.
Scavenging of ‘upstream mediators’ and inhibition of 
‘upstream mediator’ gene transcription
NF-κB dependent signalling (signalosome) is a key mechanism for generating downstream host response mediators 
in sepsis and other infl ammatory diseases. Patients with 
hypogammaglobulinaemia [77], sepsis [17], and Kawasaki’s 
disease [78] have NF-κB-mediated up-regulation of IL-1 
and IL-1r activity. Th ese components of the IL-1 system

decrease following IVIg dosing of 0.4 g/kg, secondary to a 
reduction in IL-1-mediated peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation, and by induction of IL-1 receptor 
antagonist (IL-1ra) [77]. Th e presence of neutralising 
antibodies in IVIg preparations may also be contributory. 
IVIg inhibit TNF-alpha-induced NF-κB activation on 
neutrophils while IgG1 blocks FcγRIIIA receptors on 
peripheral blood mono nuclear cells, further impairing 
their activation [79]. IVIg can also inhibit endothelial cell 
activation as demon strated by a decrease in markers such 
as adhesion molecules, endothelins, pro-infl ammatory 
cytokines (for example, IL-6) and inducible nitric oxide 
pathways [80,81]. In addition, naturally occurring antiidiotypic antibodies, auto-antibodies and immune 
proteins in IVIg preparations also contribute to its 
immunomodulatory properties [82].
Th ere is little direct evidence of IVIg eff ects on caspase 
signalling in sepsis. Caspases and calpain activation may 
contribute to myocardial dysfunction [83], pulmonary 
microvascular endothelial damage [84], and skeletal 
muscle and protein wasting in sepsis [85,86]; thus, 
inhibition of these pathways may be potentially benefi cial. 
In pemphigus, IVIg upregulated endogenous caspase and 
calpain inhibitors (FLIP and calpastatin, respectively) 
[87]. Extrapolating this evidence will help determine 
whether IVIg therapy in sepsis could potentially attenuate 
myocardial and pulmonary dysfunction.
Scavenging of ‘downstream mediators’ and inhibition of 
‘downstream mediator’ gene transcription
Cytokine neutralisation is an important component of 
anti-infl ammatory IVIg activity. Autoantibodies to 
cytokines such as IFN-α, -β and -γ, IL-1α, -2, -4, -6, -8, 
and -10, TNF-α and -β and soluble TNF receptors have 
all been reported in normal individuals. Th us, IVIg 
preparations are likely to contain such antibodies, which 
contribute to cytokine neutralisation [88-90].
HMGB-1 released into the circulation in sepsis syndromes is considered a key signalling molecule in the 
infl ammatory hub concept of severe sepsis, activating 
cell-to-cell signalling, procoagulant activity and late 
phase responses [7]. In addition, HMGB-1 is considered 
to have prognostic signifi cance [91] and is a possible 
therapeutic target in sepsis syndromes and other 
infl ammatory disorders [92]. In septic rats, high-dose IgG 
pre-treatment reduced HMGB-1 activity [93]. As IgG 
and IgM HMGB-1 antibodies are found in the serum 
samples of healthy individuals, an IVIg preparation 
should be able to limit HMGB-1-related activation of 
infl ammatory and coagulation pathways [94].
IVIg also inhibit pro-infl ammatory cytokine production by bacterial superantigens or lipopolysaccharidestimulated mononuclear cells while increasing the produc tion of IL-1 receptor antagonist, an anti-infl am matory 
cytokine [77]. Cytokine-induced endo thelial activation 
and expression of adhesion factors are key events in 
sepsis [17,95]. IVIg inhibit endothelial cell proliferation 
and downregulate mRNA expression of adhesion molecules (for example, intercellular adhesion molecule 
(ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), growth 
factors (monocyte colony stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor), and proinfl ammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6) [96]. In 
addition, IVIg attenuated IL-1α-dependent leukocyte 
adhesion to endothelium, activation and tissue injury 
[81]. Th e endothelial eff ects of IVIg are thus potentially 
useful in reducing the severity, or possibly preventing the 
onset, of new organ dysfunction in sepsis.
Bacterial clearance is the primary innate immune function of the complement system. Th is occurs via detection 
of PAMPs followed by recruitment and activation of 
proteases. Complement pathway activation results in 
opsoni sation of bacteria with C3b to facilitate phagocytosis, generation of membrane attack complex for 
bacterial cell lysis, and generation of pro-infl ammatory 
chemokine anaphylotoxins such as C3a and C5a, which 
are central mediators of the infl ammatory hub in sepsis 
[7,50,97-99].
Notwithstanding its desired eff ect on bacterial clearance, there are numerous systemic and cellular adverse 
eff ects of unregulated complement system activation. In 
patients with severe sepsis this may cause impaired 
neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytic function secondary to down-regulation of C5a receptor type 1 (CD88) 
expression, leading to reduced bacterial clearance [27,98, 
100]. Complement activation can also impair cardio myocyte function in sepsis. In an animal model this was 
prevented by C5a-blocking antibodies [101]. Furthermore, C5a is a key perpetuator of coagulation cascade 
activation [102], accelerated lymphocyte apoptosis, 
immuno paresis and autonomic nervous system dysfunction [7,50,98].
IVIg have complement-scavenging properties that 
attenuate these undesired eff ects of anaphylotoxins. 
Crucially, the anti-complement activity of IVIg does not 
aff ect bacterial clearance [103]. Th e Fab2 region of the Ig 
molecule interacts with and scavenges C3a and C5a, 
thereby reducing complement-mediated cytotoxicity 
[104]. Scavenging of C5a also reverses C5a-mediated upregulation of FcγIIIa receptors and down-regulation of 
FcγIIb receptors. Th e resulting high ratio of inhibitory 
FcγIIb to FcγIIIa on immune activator cells such as 
monocytes and macrophages is responsible for IVIginduced immunomodulation and contributes to its antiinfl ammatory eff ects [105]. As deregulated excessive C5a 
activity is likely to be a key molecular mechanism in 
sepsis [7,106], C5a scavenging by IVIg therapy should

improve neutrophil [27] and myocardial function [101], 
as well as reducing coagulopathy [102], immune cell 
apoptosis [28,107-109] and autonomic nervous system 
dysfunction.
Immune cell eff ects
Non-apoptotic
Dysregulation in the nitric oxide pathway, glucose 
metabolism and infl ammatory networks contribute to 
impaired neutrophil function in severe sepsis [110]. As 
these represent downstream mediators scavenged by 
IVIg, IVIg therapy could restore neutrophil function and 
improve bacterial clearance.
Dendritic cells act as intermediaries transducing the 
anti-infl ammatory eff ects of IVIg. Th e DC-SIGN recep tor 
(dendritic cell-specifi c ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin) 
acts as a major regulatory pathway [111]. IVIg can downregulate class II MHC expression by dendritic cells, 
directly inhibiting the classical CD3-T cell receptor 
pathway of T-cell activation [112]. Th e resulting reduction in pro-infl ammatory cytokine production and 
increas ing anti-infl ammatory cytokine production further 
contributes to the anti-infl ammatory and immuno modulatory activity of IVIg [113]. IVIg also inhibited invariant 
natural killer T-cell activation mediated through FcγRIIIA 
receptor eff ects [114]. IgG can determine the CD1 
expression profi le of monocyte-derived dendritic cells as 
this is mediated, at least in part, by FCγIIA receptors. An 
Ig-rich milieu induced CD1d expression, whereas Ig 
depletion increased expression of CD1a, CD1b, and 
CD1c [115].
A relative IgG defi ciency in sepsis could potentially 
impair homeostatic T-cell regulation, with deleterious 
eff ects on host immune function [116-118]. Proliferation 
of activated T cells is regulated by suppressive 
CD4+CD25(hi) natural regulatory T cells, a pathway 
enhanced by IgG. In patients with common variable 
immunodefi ciency, low dose IVIg therapy directly 
activated B-cell proliferation independent of T-cell 
signalling. Th is eff ect could be benefi cial in sepsis by prevent ing late-onset immune anergy, potentially through 
reducing B cell loss [119]. Th us, IVIg therapy in Igdefi cient patients may potentially facilitate these benefi cial, lymphocyte-mediated immune responses orchestrated through dendritic cells.
Anti-apoptotic
Activation of the extrinsic death receptor pathway and 
intrinsic mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum pathways 
primarily result in immune cell apoptosis during sepsis 
[34,120]. Initiators of apoptosis include complement 
proteins (C5a, via C5aR over-expression in both immune 
and non-immune cells) [107], enhanced sialic acidbinding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-9 expression 
(mediating neutrophil death) [121], Toll-like receptor 
pathways (dendritic cell depletion) [122], the FcγRIIb 
pathway (lymphocyte apoptosis) [47], and impaired mitochondrial function.
Signifi cant B and T cell apoptosis reported in a humanised (innate and adaptive immune system) mouse model 
of severe sepsis has been replicated in patients with 
severe sepsis [123]. Excessive apoptosis in sepsis has been 
shown in both circulating and lymphoid organ lymphocytes [124-126]. In addition, lymphopenia has been 
associated with adverse outcomes in severe sepsis, 
although causality has yet to be shown [127].
Apoptotic pathways thus contribute signifi cantly to 
sepsis-induced immune ‘anergy’ via lymphocytes and 
dendritic cell loss. If IVIg can attenuate immune and 
non-immune cell apoptosis by inhibition of extrinsic 
pathway activity through its ability to target upstream 
and downstream mediators (for example, via NF-κB and 
C5a inhibition), this may prevent immune anergy and 
maintain the signifi cant role lymphocytes play in 
bacterial clearance. It may also moderate the organ dysfunction, including immune anergy [120,128,129].
Th e eff ects of IVIg on apoptotic pathways are inconsistent; some reports even suggest an increase in apoptosis 
[130,131]. Th is inconsistency probably relates to IVIg 
preparation, composition, disease state and dose. Further 
studies are needed before any claims of potential benefi t 
of IVIg therapy on immune cell apoptosis can be made.
Infl uence of IVIg preparations on effi cacy
Manufacturing processes have changed signifi cantly in 
the past two decades and will likely infl uence the 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of 
the fi nal preparations. Current processes aim to maintain 
the physiological balance of the four IgG subclasses, 
which is important for both bacterial clearance and 
immunomodulation in severe sepsis [132-134]. Th e 
glyco sylation status of IgG in IVIg preparations can 
profoundly infl uence its anti- and pro-infl ammatory 
eff ects [135]. Studies of the degree and type of IgG 
glycosylation of commercial IVIg products demonstrate 
signifi cant inter-product diff erences (S Khan, WA Sewell 
et al., submitted). IVIg preparations have variable proand anti-apoptotic properties depending on the pharmacological composi tion of the IVIg preparation as these 
have varying levels of stimulating and inhibiting antibodies to Fas and Siglec receptors [136,137]. Which 
preparation is optimal may well be patient- and/or IVIg 
preparation-dependent. Th is area clearly needs further 
investigation.
Clinical trials in sepsis syndromes
To date, 17 randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials 
in adult critical care patients with severe sepsis have been 
Shankar-Hari et al. Critical Care 2012, 16:206

published, evaluating the effi cacy of standard polyclonal 
IVIg or IgM-enriched polyclonal IVIg [63,71,138-152]. 
Meta-analyses on these trials [153-159] published to date 
highlight several limitations: a) non-uniform selection of 
study subjects due to variation in disease defi nition 
(severe sepsis); b)  the intervention itself (for example, 
relationship of timing of the intervention to illness 
trajectory, lack of use of biomarkers to stratify intervention and to target likely responders, no pharmacokinetic profi ling of the intervention, and an inability to 
achieve a defi nition for the adequacy of dosing); and 
c) shortcomings in trial design (for example, single-centre 
underpowered studies with limited external validity, 
intervention bias from lack of blinding of the control 
arm) [62,111,137-150]. Th e heterogeneity in sepsis defi nitions used for trial inclusion [9,10,13], and in interventions (dose, timing, placebo intervention) is highlighted in Table 2.
No less than seven recent systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses have summarized these interventional 
trials yet have yielded confl icting results [153-159]. IVIg 
therapy is reported by most meta-analyses to be 
associated with an overall survival benefi t when 
compared with placebo or no intervention in adult 
patients with severe sepsis. Two meta-analyses [155,158] 
separately estimated treatment eff ects for IVIg and 
IVIgAM and found a strong treatment eff ect for IgMenriched IVIg (risk ratio (RR)  = 0.66; 95% confi dence 
interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.85.) and a borderline signifi cant 
eff ect for IVIg (RR  = 0.81; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.93) [158]. 
When analyses were restricted to studies at low risk of 
bias, neither IVIg nor IgM-enriched IVIg showed 
signifi cant benefi t at the 5% level (RR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.81 
to 1.15; 5 trials, n  =  945) [158]. Likewise, the metaanalyses restricted to ‘high quality’ trials report nonsignifi cant results with IVIg treatment [154,156,158]. 
Th e reasons for heterogeneity in treatment eff ects 
include dosage regimen, duration of therapy, trial 
quality, publication date and whether patients had septic 
shock or other forms of severe sepsis [153]. In seven 
studies (560 patients) that used either a total dose ≥1 g 
IVIg per kilogram body weight (RR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.40 
to 0.94]), or provided IVIg therapy for ≥2 days (17 trials, 
n  =  1,847, RR  = 0.66; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.82) there was a 
strong association with survival benefi t [153].
It should also be stressed that IVIg therapy is not 
without side eff ects. Common complications reported 
include thromboembolic events, renal dysfunction, aseptic 
meningoencephalitis, and anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid 
reactions. IVIg are often dispensed as a 5% solution; the 
eff ects of inappropriate volume loading in critically ill 
patients could be detrimental. In addition, subclinical 
sepsis can be associated with IVIg infusion reactions in 
patients with antibody defi ciency [160].
Future research
Observational research is necessary (i) to characterize 
changes in Ig concentrations during the septic process 
and (ii) to delineate mechanisms contributing to any 
impact on outcome parameters (for example, duration, 
progression and severity of organ dysfunction, new organ 
dysfunctions during critical care stay, and fatality).
From the literature review presented, we feel the 
pleotropic eff ects of IVIg on the sepsis-induced host 
response are likely to be secondary to both suppression 
of synthesis and direct scavenging of upstream and 
downstream mediators of the host response, and complex 
yet unclarifi ed immunomodulatory eff ects mediated via 
Fcγ receptors. Th ese mechanisms require confi rmation 
with well-conducted pharmacodynamic studies to provide 
the rationale for use of a specifi ed dose and duration. 
Whether plasma Ig levels, or another variable, can be a 
useful theragnostic marker for identifying and optimally 
treating a septic cohort also requires delineation.
Pharmacokinetic studies of IVIg in sepsis are yet to be 
performed, and this is an important omission. Data for 
dosage selection in current practice are principally 
derived from studies in volunteers and in patients with 
primary immune defi ciencies and other indications for 
immunomodulation [161]. In severe sepsis, potential 
confounders include systemic infl ammation with fl uctuations in immune function, increased vascular permeability, massive trans-compartmental fl uid shifts and 
endothelial dysfunction. Existing pharmacokinetic studies 
[161] also do not address Ig clearance nor the serum Ig 
concentration to which dosing was targeted for modelling 
dosing calculations in sepsis.
Such observational studies will crucially underpin the 
design of an explanatory interventional trial by informing 
the hypothesis for justifying an IVIg intervention, that is, 
replacement of low Ig concentration to physiological levels 
versus immunomodulation. Th e dosing and frequency of 
IVIg administration may diff er signifi cantly depending on 
the underlying scientifi c rationale. A theragnostic 
marker(s) may identify a high-risk cohort and there may 
be a predefi ned value for an IgG cutoff . Th is explanatory 
trial should ideally precede any large, multicentre, 
interventional trial testing the effi cacy of IVIg in a welldefi ned critically ill population with sepsis.
Conclusion
Severe sepsis results in persistent excessive stimulation of 
multiple pro-infl ammatory cellular pathways leading to 
host tissue damage, amplifi cation and dysregulation of 
the immune response through further stimulation of the 
pattern recognition receptors. Th is destructive and selfamplifying response to infection is accompanied by a fall 
in serum Ig concentrations through mechanisms as yet 
unknown. Ig have many benefi cial eff ects, either as

predict that replacement of serum Ig through infusion of 
IVIg would restore important Ig functions as described

consequence of the diffi culty in providing meaningful
