Abstract The term thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)
encompasses a group of conditions that are defined by, or
result from, a similar histopathological lesion. Hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP), and several other conditions are associated
with TMA. Distinguishing HUS from TTP is not always
possible unless there are specific causes, such as Shiga
toxin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or a specific molecular
defect such as factor H or ADAMTS13 deficiency. This
review describes the forms of HUS/TTP that are not related
to Shiga toxin, pneumococcal infection, genetic causes, or
ADAMTS13 deficiency. Conditions include HUS/TTP
associated with autoimmune disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, transplantation, malignancy,
and medications.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
Introduction
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is defined as the triad
of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,
and acute renal injury. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP) is characterized by the pentad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever,
acute renal injury, and neurological abnormalities. Generally,
renal manifestations predominate in HUS, and neurological
features are important in TTP. It is also clear that there are
many types of HUS and TTP that can now be defined not only
by these classical criteria but, more precisely, by known
etiological factors [1]. It is accepted that there are clinicopathological entities called Shiga toxin HUS, pneumococcal
HUS (see the Teaching Article on this entity), and genetic
(inherited, familial) HUS with deficiencies of factors H, I, B
or membrane cofactor protein. There are also acquired and
constitutive deficiencies in the activities of von Willebrand
factor (vWF) cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) that result in
TTP.
However, there are other syndromes that do not fall
easily under the above rubrics. In 1952 Symmers introduced the all-encompassing term thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). This term helps us to address some of the
ambiguities that defy clinical classification [2]. TMA
describes a pattern of arteriolar thrombi, with intimal
swelling and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall [3].
TMA in its broadest definition is the histopathological
feature of HUS and TTP; however, the composition of the
thrombi differs markedly between well-defined types of
HUS and TTP. The thrombi in Shiga toxin HUS are rich in
fibrin, whereas those in TTP are mainly composed of vWF
and degranulated platelets [4]. TMA is also observed in
several other conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignancy, disseminating intravascular
coagulopathy (DIC), and pre-eclampsia (Fig. 1). TMA is a
final pathological endpoint that results from a disruption of
the normal platelet–endothelial interface [5]. This can occur
either through direct vascular endothelial wall damage by
Shiga toxin or Thomsen–Friedenreich antigen activation
(pneumococcal HUS), or from a defect in normal plasma
regulatory systems, such as factor H deficiency or
ADAMTS13 deficiency.

Our approach is to classify HUS as: 1. Shiga toxin HUS; 2.
Pneumococcal HUS; 3. Genetic HUS; 4. HUS and/or TTPlike forms of TMA not associated with decreased levels of
ADAMTS13. In this review we discuss the diverse group of
conditions that we refer to as the non-Shiga toxin, nonpneumococcal, non-genetic, non-ADAMTS13-deficient
forms of HUS or TTP. To get around this cumbersome
designation, we will use the term HUS/TTP to encompass
these cases that would be more accurately classified in the
broader category of TMA. These rare conditions include
HUS/TTP associated with autoimmune disorders, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, transplantation,
malignancy, and medications.
Rigorous classification of TMA is important, because of
the implications for treatment. Patients with genetic HUS
that result from congenital deficiencies of complement
pathway regulators, or congenital TTP that result from a
congenital deficiency of ADAMTS13, may benefit from the
replacement of these factors through plasma infusions.
Patients with acquired TTP may benefit from plasma
exchange by the removal of the vWF-cleaving protease
inhibitors, thereby restoring ADAMTS13 levels. There is
no proven benefit for plasma infusions or plasmapheresis in
Shiga toxin HUS or pneumococcal HUS. Furthermore, there
is no proven benefit for plasma infusions or plasmapheresis
in HUS/TTP associated with autoimmune disorders, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, transplantation,
malignancy, or medications.
Autoimmune disorders
TMA occasionally occurs in SLE [6–8] and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS) [9] and rarely in many
autoimmune disorders (Table 1).
Clinical features and diagnosis
Approximately 60 cases of TMA associated with SLE are
reported [6–8]. Mirroring the demography of SLE, the
majority of the patients are female adolescents or young
adults [6]. The onset of SLE often precedes HUS/TTP
(>60%); but HUS/TTP may occur simultaneously or
precede SLE [6]. From 1–4% of patients with SLE have
an episode of HUS/TTP during their illness [7, 10], but one
autopsy study found a prevalence of 14%, suggesting that
the diagnosis of HUS/TTP may be overlooked [11]. This
might occur because HUS/TTP and SLE have overlapping
clinical features, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurological dysfunction, and renal impairment. However, SLE, per se, is not associated with a
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia characterized by schistocytes. When hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia
occur in SLE in the absence of schistocytes, they are
usually accompanied by positive findings in a Coombs’ test
and by anti-platelet antibodies. A positive result for a
Coombs’ test does not exclude the diagnosis of HUS/TTP.
Pathogenesis
The exact pathogenesis of SLE associated TMA (SLETMA) remains unknown and may differ between patients.
Zheng et al. [10] reported a severe deficiency of
ADAMTS13 in 80% of patients with TTP and in none of
those with autoimmune-, transplantation-, malignancy-,
medication-, or pregnancy-associated (secondary forms) of
TTP. However, only one of the patients with secondary
TTP had SLE-TMA. In contrast, in a study of the
ADAMTS13 levels of 15 patients with autoimmune
disease-associated TMA (SLE, APLS, thyroiditis, psoriasis,
Crohn disease), seven had undetectable ADAMTS13
levels, five had normal levels, and three had intermediate
levels [12]. Furthermore, seven had inhibitors of the vWFcleaving protease. In addition, the development of SLETMA may be the result of a more generalized autoimmune
process that results in direct endothelial injury, with antiendothelial antibodies [12]. The direct endothelial damage
might lead to reduced prostacyclin synthesis, platelet
activation and vWF abnormalities, resulting in TMA [8].
APLS autoantibodies are also implicated in the development of SLE-TMA. Although some patients with SLETMA have a positive antiphospholipid antibody panel,

these antibodies may be found in up to 50% of all patients
with SLE [13]. Whether APLS contributes to disease
development in some SLE-TMA patients is unclear. Further
complicating matters, two patients with primary APLS
(without SLE) developed HUS/TTP in association with a
severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 and the presence of a
vWF-cleaving protease inhibitor [9]. The great difficulty in
unraveling the pathogenesis of these conditions is the result
of clinically overlapping picture of HUS/TTP, SLE, and
APLS, the possibility that these conditions might coexist,
and the possibility that ADAMTS13 levels might be
depressed in many conditions.
Treatment
There is no established guideline for the treatment of SLETMA. Plasma exchanges, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide
are the most frequent choices of therapy [7]. The overall
mortality rate among 56 patients with SLE-TMA was 33.9%
[6]. In this review the mortality rate of the subset of patients
treated with plasmapheresis or plasma exchange was 31.9%,
compared with 44.4% in a group not treated with plasmapheresis or plasma exchange. While plasmapheresis may
reduce the mortality rate in SLE-TMA, it is not as effective
as in TTP, where the mortality rate in treated patients is
<10%. Because of the limited number of reported cases of
APLS-TMA there is no standard of care [14].
Human immunodeficiency virus
Clinical features and diagnosis
HUS/TTP has been reported in several hundred HIV-infected
adults [15]. The confounding clinical spectrum of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with autoimmune
thrombocytopenia, myelodysplasia, central nervous system
dysfunction, HIV nephropathy, medication exposure, opportunistic infections, and secondary malignancies often makes
the diagnosis of HIV-associated TMA (HIV-TMA) confusing [16]. The prevalence of TMA in adult HIV patients is
7% to 35% [17, 18], but it is rare in childhood [19].
Pathogenesis
There are reports of HIV-TMA with ADAMTS13 deficiency and inhibitors of the vWF-cleaving protease [16], but the
ADAMTS13 levels were not measured in most cases. The
best evidence for the importance of ADAMTS13 deficiency
in HIV-TMA is in the possible response to plasma infusion
therapy [20]. Alternatively, the pathogenesis of HIV-TMA
may be the result of a primary endothelial injury. Whether
the endothelial damage is directly related to viral infection
of the microvasculature and renal cells or is indirectly
related to altered vasoactive factors, local coagulation
defects, inflammatory injury, or direct damage from HIV
subunit peptides (Tat, gp120), is unclear [15].
Treatment
There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of HIVTMA. Plasmapheresis/plasma exchange is the most widely
employed therapy, but the results are mixed [15, 20]. Some
clinicians feel that there is no compelling case for any
therapy above and beyond routine HIV treatment and
supportive care [15].
Transplantation
Clinical features and diagnosis
Post-transplantation TMA may be the result of recurrent
disease or a de novo event. Recurrent TMA is usually
associated with genetic forms of HUS. De novo TMA can
occur after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
or solid organ transplantation. The incidence of TMA after
allogenic HSCT (HSCT-TMA) is 0.5% to 76% [21]. The
estimated prevalence is 8.2%, with a median mortality of
75% [22]. The median onset is 44 days after HSCT (13 to
319 days) [23]. HSCT-TMA is classified into four overlapping subtypes: multifactorial fulminant TMA, conditioning-associated HUS, cyclosporine A-associated
nephrotoxicity with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
and cyclosporine A-associated neurotoxicity with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia [24]. Multifactorial fulminant TMA and cyclosporine A-associated neurotoxicity
with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia have poor prognoses, while the courses of condition-associated HUS and
cyclosporine A-associated nephrotoxicity with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are often milder.
Early identification of HSCT-TMA can be difficult.
There is clinical overlap with calcineurin inhibitor toxicity,
which can also cause red cell fragmentation, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction and neurological problems. Furthermore, many of the features of TMA may not be present
initially or may be attributed to other causes. In particular,
the platelet and red blood cell count may fall because
engraftment may not have occurred. Similarly, minor red
cell fragmentation is common after bone marrow transplantation, and a developing TMA may be overlooked. Finally,
the early renal or neurological manifestations of HUS/TTP
may be difficult to discern in ill patients on multiple
medications. The incidence of HSCT-TMA may be no
greater than in the general population [22], because of the
frequent uncertainty of diagnosis, the variability of reported
Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:1761–1767 1763

incidences, the potential for mimicry from other transplantation-related complications, and the absence of autopsy
findings in most reports.
TMA has been reported after transplantation of all types
of solid organs, although the majority of cases were after
renal transplantation [25]. The United States Renal Data
System has shown an incidence of 0.8% of de novo
transplantation-associated TMA in renal transplantation
[26], but single-center studies have reported incidences up
to 14% [27, 28]. The risk of TMA is highest during the first
3 months after transplantation [26], and 96% of cases occur
within 1 year [25]. TMA is usually associated with the use
of calcineurin inhibitors [29], but sirolimus [30], vascular
rejection [31], and multiple viral agents, including cytomegalovirus infection, have been implicated [32]. Of
particular interest, acute vascular rejection can have clinical
and histological features similar to those of TMA; therefore, accurate diagnosis is essential, as treatment varies
considerably. While TMA is a result of primary, nonantibody mediated, injury to endothelial cells, the specific
lesion for vascular rejection appears to be an antibodymediated endovasculitis. This acute humoral rejection
results in the binding of antibodies to donor endothelium,
which activate the classical complement pathway, causing
deposition of C4d in the peritubular capillaries. C4d
immunostaining of the renal biopsy tissue may be informative in cases where the diagnosis is unclear [33].
Pathogenesis
The risk factors for TMA after HSCT include allogenic
transplantation, an unrelated stem-cell donor, acute graftversus-host disease, calcineurin inhibitors, rapamycin,
hepatic veno-occlusive disease, cytomegalovirus, human
herpes virus-6, parvovirus B19, and adenovirus [27, 34].
The pathogenesis may relate to underlying endothelial
damage associated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, calcineurin inhibitors, infection and, possibly, graft-versus-host
disease. The pathophysiology of TMA after solid organ
transplantation is believed to be secondary to an endothelial
injury rather than an autoimmune process. ADAMTS13
levels are not markedly depressed in most cases of HSCTTMA [10, 35] or TMA associated with solid organ
transplantation [29]. Regardless, the most important risk
factors seem to be calcineurin inhibitors and anti-mTOR
agents [27, 30], and the risk is increased when those agents
are used together [27].
Treatment
There is no effective treatment for transplantation-associated TMA. The calcineurin inhibitor may be discontinued,
but this may not reverse the TMA and may result in acute
graft-versus-host disease [34]. Switching cyclosporine A to
tacrolimus, or vice versa, occasionally results in recovery.
Plasmapheresis and plasma exchange are currently not
considered standards of care [21, 22]. Furthermore, the
absence of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency provides no
rationale for these potentially harmful interventions.
Malignancy
Clinical features and diagnosis
Malignancy associated TMA is mainly seen in adults and is
associated with many different adenocarcinomas [34, 36].
Rarely, TMA may be associated with leukemia [37] or
lymphoma [38]. Malignancy associated TMA may be
manifested at any stage of the disease, from early in the
course to widely disseminated cancer. When TMA is the
first manifestation of an occult malignancy, patients present
with abrupt onset of hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia; renal dysfunction is less common than in other forms
of HUS/TTP [34].
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of malignancy associated TMA is
multifactorial. ADAMTS13 levels in malignancy range
from undetectable to normal [10, 36]. Microvascular tumor
emboli, tumor procoagulants, monocyte procoagulants, and
impaired fibrinolysis may also be implicated [34].
Malignancy associated TMA may be triggered by
chemotherapeutic agents (mitomycin C and gemcitabine).
However, the occurrence of HUS/TTP in the absence of
these agents suggests that some cases result from a
paraneoplastic phenomenon [37–39]. Radiation exposure
and opportunistic infections such as cytomegalovirus
infection [40] contribute to the difficulty of assigning a
cause. Furthermore, in disseminating malignancies, a
syndrome resembling HUS/TTP can be mimicked by DIC.
Treatment
Treatment of the underlying cancer is the mainstay of
therapy. When a chemotherapeutic agent is a suspected
cause, attempts to decrease or discontinue the drug are
considered. There is no role for plasmapheresis.
Medications
Many commonly prescribed medications, vaccines, illicit
drugs, and exogenous substances are reported to be
associated with TMA [41]. Most of the case reports are
1764 Pediatr Nephrol (2008) 23:1761–1767

difficult to evaluate because of the possibility of a chance
association, concomitant disease states, and exposure to
multiple medications [41, 42]. The five most commonly
reported TMA-associated agents are cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, mitomycin C, quinine, and ticlopidine.
The calcineurin inhibitors are associated with TMA after
solid organ or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.
They also cause TMA in Behçet disease [43] and systemic
sclerosis [44]. Healthy rhesus monkeys exposed to tacrolimus developed anemia with schistocytes, thrombocytopenia, and renal microangiopathy [45].
The incidence of transplant associated-TMA ascribed to
cyclosporine A is 13% [28], and to tacrolimus it is 1% to
4.7% [46]. The onset of TMA may be associated with
supra-therapeutic or therapeutic levels of cyclosporine A
[41]. Cyclosporine A-associated TMA is often confined to
the kidney but may be associated with hematological
derangements. Endothelial toxicity induced directly by
calcineurin inhibitors is mediated by thromboxane-induced
vasoconstriction, alterations in prostacyclin synthesis, increased renin activity, increased endothelin secretion, and
the reduced formation of activated protein C [42, 47] but
not ADAMTS13 deficiency [48]. Treatment is withdrawal
of the offending agent, although not all patients respond.
Many antineoplastic agents (bleomycin, cisplatin, gemcitabine) are associated with TMA, with mitomycin C most
frequently reported [41, 42]. It is likely that mitomycin C
causes direct endothelial damage [49]. Treatment with
plasma exchange is not effective, and overall prognosis is
extremely poor [42].
Quinine, as a medication or food additive, is associated
with TMA. In one series, 57% of cases of drug-associated
HUS/TTP were ascribed to quinine. Patients exposed to
quinine may develop autoantibodies against platelets,
granulocytes, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells [42] but
not against ADAMTS13 [35]. Quinine-associated TMA is
not dose related, and re-exposure to one dose after many
years can result in recurrence [42]. Treatment is withdrawal
of the quinine. Use of plasmapheresis is based on
uncontrolled trials.
The incidence of ticlopidine (an anti-platelet agent)
associated TMA is 0.02–0.06% [50, 51]. In one series
most patients had depressed ADAMTS13 activity and
vWF-cleaving protease inhibitors [52]. Furthermore, all
the patients completely recovered after discontinuation of
ticlopidine and treatment with plasmapheresis. In contrast, a
separate series of patients with ticlopidine-associated HUS/
TTP had normal to near normal ADAMTS13 levels [53]. In
addition, ticlopidine was shown to induce apoptosis directly
in cultured human microvascular endothelial cells by
disrupting the normal endothelial cell–extracellular matrix
interactions. These observations suggest that there are
several causal pathways in ticlopidine-associated TMA.
Clopidogrel, a related compound, has replaced ticlopidine
because of fewer side-effects. Clopidogrel less commonly
causes HUS/TTP [42]. Treatment of ticlopidine-associated
HUS/TTP involves cessation of the medication, and plasma
exchange [42, 51].
Unclassified
Many conditions are listed as possible causes of HUS:
infectious mononucleosis, Coxiella burnetii, group A beta
hemolytic streptococcus, Salmonella typhi, hepatitis A,
Kawasaki disease, and many others. Pregnancy has also
been proposed as a risk factor, but this is complicated by
pre-eclampsia, hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes
and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, idiopathic TTP,
factor H deficiency, and E. coli 0157:H7 infection during
or after pregnancy.
Conclusion
Considerable progress has been made in the understanding
of HUS, TTP, and TMA. The recognition of the importance
of the Shiga toxins, neuraminidase activity, abnormalities in
the vWF-cleaving protease, and regulatory elements of the
complement cascade, has elevated some of these conditions
from syndrome to the status of clinico-pathological diseases. The pathophysiology of many of the secondary
causes of TMA remains unknown. Whether the
ADAMTS13 activity will truly distinguish HUS from
TTP in many problematic cases remains to be seen.
