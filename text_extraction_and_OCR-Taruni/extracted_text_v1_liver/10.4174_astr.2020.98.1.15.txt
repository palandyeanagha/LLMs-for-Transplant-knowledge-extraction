INTRODUCTION
The major liver resection with caudate lobectomy and radical lymph node (LN) dissection has been accepted as a 
definite treatment of choice for hilar cholangiocarcinoma 
(HC) [1-8]. In terms of major liver resection procedures, right 
hemihepatectomy (RH) has usually been selected for twothirds of patients treated for HC [9-11]. Radical removal of the 
caudate lobe as well as relatively easy biliary reconstruction 
was the main reason to perform RH [9]. However, as more than 
60% of the total liver volume should be removed by RH, the 
patient might be confronted with a high risk of postoperative 
liver failure (PLF) [12,13]. Although left hemihepatectomy (LH) 
could be considered a treatment option for HC, LH might be

Purpose: Major liver resection and radical lymph node dissection has been accepted as a definite treatment of choice for 
hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC). However, the perioperative and survival outcomes of right hemihepatectomy (RH) and left 
hemihepatectomy (LH) still remain controversial. Thus, this study aimed to compare the surgical and oncological outcomes 
of RH and LH in HC patients.
Methods: From January 2000 to January 2018, a total of 326 patients underwent surgical resection for HC at Yonsei 
University College of Medicine in Seoul, Korea. Among the 326 patients, we excluded 130 patients and selected 196 
patients, who underwent hemihepatectomy with caudate lobectomy. Among these 196 patients, 114 patients underwent 
RH, and 82 patients underwent LH. We compared the clinicopathological features as well as the surgical and oncologic 
outcomes of the RH and LH groups.
Results: There were no significant differences in disease-free survival (P = 0.473) or overall survival (P = 0.946) in the RH 
and LH groups. The LH group had fewer complications compared with the RH group, including postoperative ascites (RH: 
15 [13.2%] vs. LH: 3 [3.7%], P = 0.023); however, the LH group had more bile leakage complications (RH: 5 [4.4%] vs. LH: 12 
[14.6%], P = 0.012). The average time lag from portal vein embolization to operation was 25.80 ± 12.06 days (n = 45). There 
was no difference in postoperative liver failure (P = 0.402), although there were significantly more frequent ascites after RH 
(P = 0.023).
Conclusion: LH might be a good alternative option for the surgical treatment of HC given appropriate tumor location and 
biliary anatomy indications.

technically demanding due to the difficult anastomosis from 
the multiple openings of the right hepatic ducts and posterior 
hepatic duct located posterior to the right portal vein (RPV) 
[14]. Moreover, the bifurcation of biliary confluences usually 
located in the right vascular structures and the relatively long 
left hepatic duct compared with the right hepatic duct may 
make it possible that RH has a greater chance of R0 resection 
[15]. However, perioperative outcomes and survival data for RH 
and LH still remain controversial. Thus, this study aimed to 
compare the surgical and oncological outcomes of RH and LH in 
HC patients.
METHODS
Patients and subgroup analysis
From January 2000 to December 2018, a total of 326 consecutive patients underwent surgical treatment for HC at 
Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul, Korea. Surgical 
treatment was defined as a surgical approach in patients 
diagnosed with HC, including not only liver resection, but 
also bile duct resection, palliative surgery, even opening and 
closure (n = 326). Among these 326 patients, 196 patients 
having RH or LH with caudate lobectomy and Roux-en-Y 
hepaticojejunostomy were included in the study, and we 
compared the clinicopathologic features, surgical outcomes, and 
oncologic outcomes between the RH and LH groups. In terms of 
Bismuth types II and IV, as surgeons might choose the operative 
option as RH or LH, we compared the RH (n = 35) and LH (n = 
34) groups of patients diagnosed as Bismuth type II or type IV 
HC. Portal vein embolization (PVE) could be the cause of a time 
lag between diagnosis and operation. Thus, we also compared 
the RH following PVE group (n = 45) and the LH group (n = 82) 
(Fig. 1).
This retrospective cohort study was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital, Yonsei 
University Health System (4-2018-0802) and exempted from the 
informed consent.
Analysis of patient characteristics, surgical 
outcomes, and oncologic outcomes
In determining right and LH, we considered margin, vessel 
invasion, and future remnant liver volume. If we could get 
the negative margin in bifurcation level of right anterior and 
posterior bile duct (U-point) based on preoperative radiology, 
we planned LH. On the contrary, if we could not get the 
negative margin of U-point in the presence of cancer invasion, 
we considered RH after confirming the negative margin of left 
trifurcation level of B2, B3, and B4. In case of possible obtaining 
negative margin in both bile ducts, we considered vessel 
invasion and future remnant liver volume. In presence of portal 
vein or hepatic artery invasion, we conducted hemihepatectomy 
of corresponding lobe. In case of Bismuth type 2 or type 4 
Klatskin tumor, we conducted LH when future remnant liver 
volume is considered not sufficient to maintain liver function.
In the comparison study of RH and LH, and 2 subgroup analyses, we analyzed patient characteristics, surgical outcomes, and 
oncologic outcomes. Patient characteristics included age, sex, 
preoperative lab findings (albumin, AST/ALT, gamma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase [GGT], CA 19-9, CEA, total bilirubin, and highest 
total bilirubin), preoperative procedures (biliary drainage and 
PVE), Bismuth type, and stage. Surgical outcomes included 
surgical complications (ascites, postoperative bleeding, bile 
leakage, sepsis, pleural effusion, abscess, wound infection, liver 
failure, and postoperative mortality) and operative findings

Fig. 1. Classification of patients for the study. Among 326 total patients diagnosed as hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC), 130 
patients were excluded; the remaining patients were then divided into 2 groups of right hemihepatectomy (RH) patients (n = 
114) and left hemihepatectomy (LH) patients (n = 82). In one subgroup analysis, we compared RH patients of Bismuth type II 
or type IV (n = 35) and LH patients, and in another subgroup analysis, we also compared patients who underwent portal vein 
embolization (PVE) followed by RH (n = 45) and LH (n = 82) patients.

operation time). Oncologic outcomes were also analyzed 
including local recurrence, systemic recurrence, overall survival 
(OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). PLF was defined as PT < 
50% and total bilirubin > 50 μmol/L (>2.92 mg/dL) according 
to the rule of “50-50 criteria,” which predicts the possibility of

Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in survival between 
groups were compared with the log-rank test. Perioperative 
mortalities were included in the OS analysis but excluded from 
the DFS analysis. Finally, we used the Kaplan-Meier method 
and Cox regression test for analyzing patients’ characteristics 
affecting recurrence and survival. Statistical analyses were 
performed with IBM SPSS Statistics ver. 23.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, 
NY, USA). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
Right versus left lobectomy
We compared preoperative characteristics as well as surgical 
and oncologic outcomes of 114 RH and 82 LH patients. In 
preoperative characteristics, we compared the mean values 
of age, preoperative albumin, AST/ALT, ALP, GGT, CA 19-9, 
CEA, preoperative total bilirubin, and preoperative highest 
total bilirubin and also compared the ratio of male/female, 
preoperative biliary drainage, PVE, and portal vein resection. 
There were no significant differences between the 2 groups 
in disease severity in preoperative lab findings, or in the 
proportions of preoperative biliary drainage and portal vein 
resection (Table 1). In surgical outcomes, the complications 
between the 2 groups had differences in ascites, with many 
more occurrences of ascites in RH patients (15 patients, 13.2%) 
compared with LH patients (3 patients, 3.7%) (P = 0.023), 
whereas LH patients had more bile leakage than RH patients, 
with 12 patients (14.6%) and 5 patients (4.4%), respectively (P = 
0.012). Intraoperative surgical outcomes had no significant 
differences between the 2 groups including intraoperative 
bleeding, transfusion rate, R0 resection rate, operation time, 
and postoperative mortality (Table 2). In oncologic outcomes, 
we analyzed the DFS and OS between the 2 groups. The 1-, 3-, 
and 5-year DFS rates of the RH group were 66.1%, 36.5%, and 
24.6%, and those of the LH group were 67.1%, 28.8%, and 20.9%, 
respectively. In OS, the 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of the RH 
group were 77.2%, 41.4%, and 26.8%, and those of the LH group 
were 87.3%, 38.2%, and 24.7%, respectively. In both DFS and OS, 
there were no significant differences between the 2 groups (P = 
0.473 and P = 0.946, respectively) (Fig. 2). In univariate analyses 
of patients’ characteristics affecting DFS and OVS, preoperative 
AST > 50 IU/L, preoperative CA 19-9 > 400 U/mL, and LN 
metastasis were negative prognostic factors for DFS (P = 0.014, 
P = 0.001, and P = 0.016, respectively), and preoperative serum 
albumin ≤ 3.5 g/dL and preoperative CA 19-9 > 400 U/mL were

negative prognostic factors for OS (P = 0.028, P = 0.044, and

that preoperative CA 19-9 > 400 U/mL and LN metastasis were 
independent prognostic factors for DFS (odds ratio, 2.043; P = 
0.001 and odds ratio, 1.621; P = 0.013, respectively), and for OS, 
CA 19-9 > 400 U/mL was an independent prognostic factor 
(odds ratio, 1.702; P = 0.009 and odds ratio, 1.918; P = 0.001, 
respectively) (Table 3).
Right versus left lobectomy in Bismuth types II 
and IV
Among 114 RH patients and 82 LH patients, we selected Bismuth type II or type IV patients diagnosed in preoperative 
evaluations (35 RH and 34 LH patients). For these patients, we 
also analyzed preoperative characteristics as well as surgical 
and oncologic outcomes. Between the 2 subgroups, there were 
no significant differences in disease severity or preoperative 
lab findings. The surgical outcomes of the 2 subgroups had a 
significant difference in the proportion of bile leakage. The LH 
subgroup had significantly more frequent occurrence of bile 
leakage (RH: 0 [0%] vs. LH: 6 [17.6%], P = 0.011). Although the 
P-value was not significant, the RH subgroup had a tendency 
toward more frequent occurrence of ascites and liver failure. 
In perioperative surgical outcomes, the LH subgroup had more 
transfusions (RH: 12 patients [34.3%] vs. LH: 22 patients [64.7%], 
P = 0.012), and required more operation time (RH: 490.91 ± 
127.07 minutes vs. LH: 564.00 ± 160.27 minutes, P = 0.039) 
(Table 4). Oncologic outcomes were not different between the 
2 subgroups; in a comparison of OS and DFS, the 2 subgroups 
were not different (OS, P = 0.759; DFS, P = 0.739) (Fig. 2).
Right lobectomy after PVE versus left lobectomy
We conducted another subgroup analysis to evaluate the 
effects of LH on survival compared to PVE followed by RH. 
Among 114 RH patients, we selected 45 patients who underwent 
PVE followed by RH and compared them with 82 patients who 
underwent LH alone. The methods of analysis were the same as 
above. Like the 2-subgroup analysis above, the PVE + RH and 
LH groups had no differences in patients’ characteristics. Also, 
the PVE + RH group had significantly more ascites (PVE + RH: 
11 patients [24.4%] vs. LH: 3 patients [3.7%], P = 0.001), whereas 
the LH group had more bile leakage (PVE + RH: 1 patient [2.2%] 
vs. LH: 12 patients [14.6%], P = 0.032). The 2 subgroups also had 
no significant differences in perioperative surgical outcomes 
(Table 5). Likewise, there were no significant differences 
between the 2 subgroups in oncologic outcomes, OS, or DFS (Fig. 
2). The average time lag from PVE to operation was 25.80 ± 
12.06 days (n = 45).
DISCUSSION
Major liver resection with radical LN dissection is the 
treatment of choice for HC curative treatment. However, 
anatomically, the distance from the primary biliary bifurcation 
to the sectional branch in the right liver is much shorter 
than that in the left, and right sectional bile ducts have many 
anatomical variations [17]. For these reasons, many surgeons 
have preferred the right-side hemihepatectomy to the left 
despite the lesser remnant liver volume [11]. Generally, it is 
known that two-thirds of liver volume is found in the right 
lobe and one-third is in the left lobe. Previous studies reported 
average proportions of right, left, and caudate lobes as 67%, 31%,

and 2%, respectively [12]. These anatomical issues have caused 
higher perioperative mortality and complications such as PLF 
or cholangitis in RH. PVE is generally used to secure sufficient 
right liver volume [18,19]; however, it could be the cause of time 
lag until the operation. The average time lag between PVE and 
operation was 25.80 ± 12.06 days (n = 45) in our data.
In this study, the LH group had significantly fewer ascites 
without significant differences in the bleeding rates, R0 
resectability, or recurrence patterns. Oncologically, LH was 
not inferior to RH in DFS and OS. In subgroup analysis of PVE 
followed by RH compared to LH, LH also had the advantages 
of fewer ascites and shorter time intervals between diagnosis 
and radical operation (Table 6). These results show that if the 
tumor’s location is such that it can be removed by LH, then 
LH can be a good alternative option for reducing perioperative 
morbidity and mortality by preserving remnant liver volume.
Some authors reported that right resections still cause 
significant morbidity related to extensive parenchymal sacrifice, 
but they are associated with better long-term survival due to 
better radicality compared with left resections [13]. However, 
conflicting results have been reported, in which there were no 
significant differences in outcomes by lesion side in patients 
receiving curative surgery for Bismuth type III HC [20-22]. Our 
data also showed no significant differences in DFS and OS, 
cancer staging, R0 resection rate, local recurrence, or systemic 
recurrence rate between RH and LH patients. However, the 
perioperative outcomes of LH showed more bile leakage and 
longer operation times. This might be due to the multiple 
bile duct openings of the right side of the liver. As Shimizu 
et al. [15] reported, the relationship of the right posterior 
sectional bile duct (RPSBD) and RPV is a crucial factor for bile 
duct anastomosis. If RPSBD runs cranially around the RPV 
(supraportal type), achieving a negative margin of the proximal 
bile duct and anastomosis can be difficult. So, if a surgeon 
selects LH for the treatment of HC, a preoperative radiologic 
evaluation for the anatomy of the bile duct and portal vein 
relationship is very important. Also, in multivariate analysis, 
the major risk factors for recurrence were CA 19-9 > 400 U/mL 
and LN metastasis, and the factor affecting OS was CA 19-9 > 
400 U/mL alone. So, in patients who have greater tumor burdens 
with higher CA 19-9 and the presence of LN metastasis, more 
precise preoperative evaluation is needed to achieve a negative 
margin of surgical resection.
Although this study included a relatively large sample 
size of 326 total operative HC cases, this study was based on 
retrospective data. Moreover, the subgroup populations were 
relatively small for the study. Thus, prospective randomized 
controlled trials should be conducted in the future.
In conclusion, LH had comparable oncologic outcomes to RH 
with lower occurrence of ascites and higher bile leakage rates. 
However, postoperative ascites was more notable complication 
than postoperative bile leakage, as ascites is correlated with 
postoperative liver function, and bile leakages were all minor 
complications and resolved spontaneously by conservative care 
in our study. Also, more operation time and transfusion in LH 
patients did not affect patient’s outcome. For these reasons, 
we concluded, LH can be an alternative surgical option to RH, 
considering bile duct anatomy and tumor location.
