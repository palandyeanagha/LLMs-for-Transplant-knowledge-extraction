Orthotopic liver transplantation: the first 6o patients

British Medical_Journal, 1977, 1, 471-476
Summary
Between May 1968 and 31 December 1976 60 orthotopic
liver allografts were transplanted by the CambridgeKing's College Hospital team. During this period there
were changes in the selection of patients and their
management. Initially some patients were operated on
when they were too ill, often because of a prolonged wait
for a donor. There was a high incidence of fatal complications of biliary drainage in patients who survived
longer than the first week after operation. Improved
results have been due to the development of a simple
method of preserving the liver, thereby increasing the
pool of potential donors, and by a new technique of
biliary drainage, which allows well-vascularised anastomoses without tension, retains the sphincter of Oddi, and
leaves access for radiological examination of the biliary
tree.
Uncontrollable rejection of the liver has occurred in
less than 10"0 of cases. This contrasts strongly with the
incidence of rejection among kidney transplants. Six
patients have lived for over a year, the longest surviving
for more than five years, and 13 patients were still alive
at the beginning of 1977.
Introduction
There have been many changes both in the management of
patients and in the selection of cases for orthotopic liver graft
since we began transplantation in May 1968. Initially, patients
often underwent operation when they were too ill for the
procedure, because of the prolonged period of waiting for a
suitable donor liver. There was also a high incidence of fatal

complications relating to the biliary tract.' During the past 18
months our results have steadily improved. This has been due
mainly to the development of a better technique for biliary
drainage. Greater confidence in the simple, short-term, hypothermic technique of liver preservation has also allowed more
transplants to be carried out. Since 1973 19 livers have been preserved in this way and transported to Cambridge or King's
College Hospital from hospitals 35 to 480 miles away. Ischaemia
times have ranged from 2 hours and 42 minutes to 8 hours and 10
minutes, and in all cases the grafts have functioned well after
transplantation.
The last detailed analysis of our results was based on the 26
patients operated on up to 12 December 1971,1 and in the five
years since then a further 34 patients have been treated. We
describe here our experience gained from these 60 patients and
compare our results with those obtained by Starzl in patients
with different conditions.
Overall results and long-term survivors
Malignant disease of the liver and cirrhosis constituted the two
major groups of conditions (table I). Of the 25 patients with a primary
liver tumour, five had an underlying cirrhosis and in one of these the
indication for transplantation was encephalopathy rather than
tumour, which was not detected until the liver was sectioned after

removal. The median age of the 60 patients was 43 years and the
oldest patient was 65 years. Only five patients were aged 17 or under,
and only one was aged under 11 years-an infant of 10 months with
biliary atresia.
EARLY POST-TRANSPLANT PERIOD
Of the 35 patients operated on before 1975 12 died within the first
week after operation, but there were no deaths within this period in
the 25 patients operated on in 1975 and 1976.
In most cases the function of the transplanted liver has been
strikingly good.3 Liver function test results in deeply jaundiced patients
have returned to normal over the first 10 days, and other signs of liver
failure, particularly hepatic encephalopathy, have been rapidly
reversed. This occurred even in patients with chronic encephalopathy
of several years' duration in whom the brain might have been considered to be irreversibly damaged.4 A striking example ofthis occurred
early in the series in a patient (case 10) who had developed severe
chronic encephalopathy after a portacaval anastomosis. After the
transplant all clinical and electrocencephalographic (EEG) signs of
encephalopathy receded and he could undertake normal daily activities
again, and even built a greenhouse. Another instance was in a woman
of 55 with cirrhosis (case 22) who had been in and out of coma for
some months and was areflexic at the time of transplantation. Yet by
the second day after operation she was fully conscious and her
subsequent clinical improvement was remarkable, with a return of
mentality and EEG tracing to normal. Similar improvement occurred
in a 37-year-old man with cirrhosis (case 45) who had had two
admissions for hepatic encephalopathy in 1975, during the last of
which he was in coma for seven days.
Various hormonal manifestations of primary hepatic tumours
disappeared even more rapidly. The blood sugar concentrations of a
patient with hypoglycaemia, massive secondary hepatic deposits, and
an insulinoma-like state, were normal from the time the anastomosis
was completed. In another patient, hypercalcaemia was found to be
due to secretion of a parathyroid hormone-like substance by the
primary hepatic tumour,5 and both serum calcium and raised parathyroid hormone concentrations fell to normal over 36 hours.
SURVIVAL FIGURES AND CASE HISTORIES
Fourteen of the 60 patients survived for over six months, and six of
these lived beyond a year. Of the 13 patients still alive at the time of
writing, one has survived nearly three years after operation. The
longest survivor in the series lived for 5 years and 3 months after
transplantation (table II).
The clinical course of four of the six patients who survived for more
than one year is described to give some indication of the quality of
life that can be enjoyed after a liver allograft.
Case 9-This patient was 45 years old in 1969, when transplantation was
carried out for a primary hepatocellular carcinoma without underlying
BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 19 FEBRUARY 1977
cirrhosis. The removed tumour weighed 4 kg. Apart from one minor episode
of rejection during the second week and an episode of cholangitis during the
third month, she remained well for over five years. She could work as
supervisor of domestic cleaners at a town hall and travel overseas. Liver
function test results were virtually normal until 10 days before her final
illness. She died in 1974 from cholangitis and septicaemia. Necropsy showed
inspissated sludge throughout the biliary tract with secondary infective
changes in the liver parenchyma, but there was no evidence of tumour
recurrence or rejection.
Case 29-This 44-year-old housewife underwent transplantation in March
1973 for a hepatocellular carcinoma arising in a non-cirrhotic liver. She
remained well, with only occasional episodes of cholangitis, until August
1974, when evidence of recurrent growth in the lungs and liver was detected
during a routine check-up. She was treated with cytotoxic drugs and
remained clinically well until February 1975. She died at home on 1 April
1975, 24 months after the transplant.
Case 34-In 1971, when she was 31, this patient underwent a hemihepatectomy for a primary hepatocellular carcinoma apparently confined to
the left lobe of the liver. She remained well until early 1974, when evidence
of tumour recurrence in the remaining right lobe was observed. Transplantation was carried out shortly afterwards (February), and during the three
years since transplantation she has led an active life, and regularly cycles up
Denmark Hill (fig 1). The biliary tract anastomosis had to be reconstructed
in June 1975 because of calculi within the biliary tract.
Case 40-This university lecturer presented in April 1975 at the age of 39
with a short history of obstructive jaundice, which was due to a small
carcinoma arising in the porta hepatis. Transplantation was carried out on
17 June 1975. Biliary obstruction and fistulae developed in July and continuity
was re-established using the new technique of anastomosis described below.
He then remained well, lectured round the country, and led an active life
until his condition deteriorated quite suddenly and he died on 10 July 1976.
Necropsy showed recurrent growth blocking the hepatic artery and portal
vein.

Recent improvements
FIRST WEEK AFTER TRANSPLANT
The sharp reduction in mortality in the first week after operation
since 1974 was due to less ischaemic damage to the donor livers, better
initial assessment of the recipient, greater anaesthetic and surgical
experience, and an appreciation of the potential hazards during the
operation.
Better donor organs-Removing a liver from a "heart-beating
cadaver" provides the most perfectly preserved organ for
transplantation. This technique has been standard practice for years
in Denver. Until recently in the United Kingdom, where the concept
of "brain death" has not yet been fully accepted, organ removal was
not started until after circulatory arrest following cessation of
mechanical ventilation.6 While the heart beat continued, the liver
almost certainly suffered ischaemic damage as a result of being
perfused with deoxygenated acidic blood. In the past year, however, it
has been possible to start liver removal either immediately after
cessation of mechanical ventilation or while ventilation continued.
Hazards during operation-Great care has to be taken when the vena
cava is clamped above the liver and more than half the blood return to
the heart is cut off. Some hypotension is inevitable at this stage and
cardiac arrest may occur. Another danger period is when the vena
cava is unclamped, probably because cold acidic blood containing a high
concentration of potassium ions is released from the donor liver and
floods suddenly into the right side of the heart. To minimise this, the
liver is flushed with 400 ml of plasma protein fraction without
additives at room temperature before the portal venous anastomosis is
completed. Cardiac arrests may, however, occur at all stages of the
operation.7 Even if the arrest is rapidly reversed the postoperative
course may be complicated by heart failure. One patient (case 46) who
suffered arrest during the operation continued to have an arrhythmia
after operation and died from left ventricular failure and pneumonia
after six weeks.
BILIARY TRACT COMPLICATIONS AND NEW TECHNIQUE OF
ANASTOMOSIS
Until recently biliary tract complications were distressingly frequent.
A detailed analysis of the first 33 patients8 showed that 14 of the 22
who survived the immediate operation developed biliary fistulae, and
masses of inspissated bile were found in the biliary tract in 12 of these
at laparatomy or necropsy. The next seven cases (cases 34 to 40) had
as the primary procedure a choledochodochostomy over a T-tube,
which was left in place as a permanent stent. Of the five who survived

the immediate postoperative period three had some leakage at the site
of anastomosis but died of other causes-two of tumour recurrence
and the third of a massive cardiac infarction. Another (case 34) was
still alive at the time of writing, and the fifth (case 40) developed an
obstruction at the site of the anastomosis with leakage of bile above
(see above). At reoperation biliary tract continuity was established
using a new technique in which the gall bladder of the donor serves as
a biliary conduit.9 This has been used in all subsequent cases (cases
41 onwards) as the primary procedure (fig 2).
FIG 3-T-tube cholangiogram of patient with orthotopic
allograft with gall bladder used as pedicle graft conduit.
Anastomosis-The gall bladder of the donor is mobilised, leaving its
blood supply intact, and the common duct is trimmed back and cut
obliquely so that the subsequent anastomosis carried out can be a wide
one with a good blood supply. At transplantation Hartmann's pouch
of the donor gall bladder is anastomosed to the donor common duct,
-and the fundus of the gall bladder is anastomosed to the obliquely cut
recipient common duct. The anastomoses are splinted with a specially
constructed T-tube with a narrow gauge irrigating arm, threaded
through the proximal anastomosis. Two litres of heparinised normal
saline are infused by a drip set through the irrigating tube each day
for the first two weeks after operation.
If cholangiography (fig 3) is satisfactory further flushing is stopped
and the T-tube is spigotted. The latter is then left in place without
disturbance provided there are no complications. One tube has been
in place for more than a year, but in two patients the tube fell out after
a few months. In each patient biliary drainage has been initially
satisfactory and the incidence of biliary leakage and anastomotic
stenosis has been considerably reduced, although formnation of biliary
sludge can still be a problem. In one patient whose common duct
could not be used (case 55) the technique was modified by anastomosing
the fundus of the gall bladder conduit to a long Roux loop of jejunum.
Rejection
In many patients serum bilirubin-concentrations rose at the fifth to
10th day after the operation. In most cases no other evidence of
rejection was obtained, and the jaundice subsided without change in
immunosuppressive treatment. Although this early rise in serum
bilirubin might have been related to ischaemic damage, it did not seem
to become more severe or frequent after we began to use livers removed
at other hospitals and transported over longer distances. There was no
evidence either that these episodes were related to azathioprine
toxicity. For the past two years we have routinely used cyclophosphamide instead of azathioprine during the first three days after operation,
when ischaemic damage is presumably at its greatest.
Further episodes of jaundice have occurred after a short interval or
-occasionally directly, when -immunological or histological evidence
of rejection has been obtained. Such episodes were observed in 10 of

474
the first 26 patients. Six patients responded rapidly to a temporary
increase in immunosuppressive treatment; In four patients, however,
the jaundice continued and severe rejection was considered to have
been the major cause of death. These included one patient in whom
immunosuppressive drugs were withheld because at the time (1968)
we thought that the hepatitis virus that was presumed to be the cause
of his subacute hepatic necrosis might be reactivated. The other three
patients became deeply jaundiced with a grossly raised serum alkaline
phosphatase concentration and a moderate increase in serum transaminase concentration. The final morphological changes in the allograft in two patients (cases 3 and 19), who survived for three and four
months respectively, were characteristic of chronic rejection with
intimal thickening of the hepatic arterioles by foamy lipid-laden
histiocytes. Among the more recent patients, we encountered one
further case of severe cholestatic jaundice due to chronic rejection
(case 50). This patient died at four months, and an additional feature
of the hepatic histological changes found at necropsy was the absence
of interlobular bile ducts.
Hepatitis B infection-One of the patients with a primary hepatoma
who underwent operation in 1975 (case 43) was known to be positive for
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). There was no underlying liver
disease, but two other brothers, one of whom had died two years
earlier from a primary hepatoma,"° had been found to have HBsAg in
the serum. Because of Starzl's experience with a patient in whom
serum HBsAg reappeared two months after the transplant, with the
subsequent reappearance of chronic active hepatitis," we used large
doses of specific immunoglobulin. The first dose was given during the
operation immediately after the diseased liver had been removed with
the aim of neutralising HBsAg circulating in the serum and so preventing reinfection of the transplanted liver. By the next day the antigen
titre, which was over 1/4000 initially, had decreased to 1/32. Further
immunoglobulin was given, and the patient remained antigen free.
One year after transplantation he was clinically well, back to work full
time, and with no evidence of tumour recurrence.
Recurrence of tumour and new malignancy
Eighteen of the 25 patients with a primary hepatoma died. Of the
five who died within two weeks of the operation, two had residual
tumour in the retroperitoneal or porta hepatis lymph nodes, and
residual or recurrent tumour was found at necropsy in eight of the 13
who survived for longer periods. The amount of tumour tissue was not
necessarily very great. In one patient who lived 11 months the single
metastasis in the right adrenal was only 2 cm. Five patients had
worthwhile palliation and survived for 5, 6, 6-, 7 , 11, and 23 months.
Each regained normal weight and was discharged from hospital for a
spell of normal activity before evidence of tumour became manifest
again. The seven patients currently alive who have shown no evidence
of tumour recurrence include one patient who has survived nearly
three years (case 34) and two patients (cases 42 and 43) who underwent
operation in December 1975. The eight patients in whom no tumour
was detectable at necropsy died of various causes. These include the
patient who lived for five years and three months (case 9) and the two
patients already referred to (cases 3 and 19), who died after some
months of chronic rejection and who had received very high doses of
immunosuppressive drugs.
Recurrent tumour was also observed in four of the five patients in
the earlier series who underwent transplantation for the characteristically small primary carcinoma arising at the junction of the
hepatic ducts. All had undergone a previous attempt to intubate the
growth, which probably disseminated tumour cells in the porta
hepatis. This also applied to two of the three cases in the recent series,
one of whom (case 40) did well for a year before showing evidence of
recurrent growth. The one survivor (case 47) of the eight cases with
this type of growth in the total series was transplanted at a much earlier
stage (within two months of the first symptom) and had not had
previous surgery. At the time of writing he was in his seventh month
and was well and back to work.
Of the four patients who received a transplant for hepatic metastatic
growths, three died between two and six months, one from sepsis
(case 18) and the other two from disseminated malignancy (cases 21
and 50).
Reticulum cell sarcoma-This occurred-in a woman with cirrhosis
and encephalopathy (case 22) who died of septicaemia and cholangitis
at six months after a very satisfactory initial course.'2 At necropsy small
discrete nodules of tumour were found within the graft and in the porta
hepatis. These showed the typical appearances of reticulum cell
sarcoma on histological examination.

Discussion
Our recent improved results are due not only to the quality of
the donor organs being transplanted but also to the progress
we have made in solving problems relating to the immediate
postoperative period and in reducing the frequency of the biliary
tract complications.
BILIARY TRACT COMPLICATIONS
These complications have for some time constituted the main
cause of morbidity and mortality with later transplantation.
Fistulae may develop after direct duct-to-duct drainage because
of a poor blood supply to the lower end of the donor duct and
tension on the anastomosis. But, whatever type of anastomosis
is used, breakdown is more likely if there is already infection at
the operation site, particularly as the immunosuppressive
regimen will further impair healing. Starzl, who has also reported
biliary obstruction by sludge developing some months after
transplantation, relies on a cholecystojejunostomy with a long
jejunal loop.'3 If complications develop his second-stage
operation is to detach the Roux loop, remove the gall bladder,
and remake the anastomosis to the then usually dilated common
bile duct.14 We think that the technique we use in our patients
fulfills the objectives of biliary drainage. Firstly, it preserves the
sphincter of Oddi to prevent ascending cholangitis. Secondly, it
provides a wide anastomosis with a good blood supply and no
sump such as the blind end of the common duct for the
accumulation of biliary sludge. Thirdly, it provides ready access
to the biliary ducts for both irrigation to prevent sludge blockage
and radiography for diagnostic purposes.
The possibility of an abnormality of bile secretion underlying
the formation of sludge was investigated in three of our
recipients.8 Supersaturation of bile with cholesterol was found
in two patients immediately after surgery and during episodes
of acute rejection. Bile was never lithogenic in the third, and a
more important factor is almost certainly a change in composition
consequent on infection. Chemical analysis of casts found at
necropsy showed that free bilirubin was the major component,
and in one recipient the Escherichia coli organisms grown in
cultures of the casts possessed glucuronidase activity.
Damage to bile duct mucosa will also favour precipitation of
calcified salts and bilirubin, and there was evidence of this in one
of our cases. Cytomegalovirus and monilial infections of the
bile duct mucosa, leading to sloughing of the mucosa with
subsequent precipitation of biliary constituents, have also been
described by Starzl et al.'4 Further evidence in favour of
mucosal sloughing'5 comes from analyses of sludge obtained
from our more recent patients in which collagen was shown to be
a major component. Another important factor underlying such
mucosal shedding, in addition to infection, almost certainly
includes ischaemic damage to the epithelium and subepithelial
collagenous tissue during the preservation procedure. Rejection
of the mucosa is another possibility, but of this little is known.
REJECTION
Liver allografts seem to be distinctly less severely rejected
than those of the kidney. In a collaborative study with the
Denver group we showed that the deposition of immunoglobulins
and complement was less common and less intense than in renal
or cardiac allografts protected by similar immunosuppressive
regimens.'6 Two of our patients were completely weaned from
prednisone, and we were never able to do this in a series of more
than 400 kidney grafts from unrelated cadaver donors. Neither
in our patients nor in those of Starzl has the degree of histocompatibility between donor and recipient seemed to be relevant
to the occurrence of rejection. One of our patients was found to
have cytotoxic antibody reacting with donor cells before
transplantation, yet there was no evidence of rejection over six
months. Starzl has had the same experience, and in three of his

patients transplantation was successful despite red blood group
incompatibility. Rejection of the liver accounted for less than
10" of the deaths in his series,' and our figure of five deaths
from this cause is similar.
In this respect the human experience is similar to the observations made in animals.' The most recent of these have shown
that in the pig liver cells possess less major histocompatibility
complex surface antigenic specificities than kidney cells, and
hepatocytes are more resistant to killing by allogeneic lymphocytes in tissue culture than kidney cells.' '9 The difference in
expression of surface antigens on liver cells might be an
important factor in the relatively privileged immunological
status of the liver. Hepatic metabolism and contributions of
Kupffer cells might also be relevant.
The importance of an accurate diagnosis of rejection cannot be
overemphasised, as many of our earlier patients were almost
certainly overtreated with immunosuppressive drugs and this
caused some of the infective complications. The jaundice of
rejection may have obstructive features due to intrahepatic
cholestasis. If there is no T tube in place, transhepatic cholangiography using the fine needle technique is useful in
excluding extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction. The leucocyte
migration test, carried out with donor antigen obtained from
white cells, has proved a reliable indicator of rejection,
particularly during the first few weeks after transplantation.20
SARCOMA
The development of a reticulum cell sarcoma in one of our
patients is the only case in a liver allograft so far reported,
although there are many described after renal transplantation.
Najarian et a12 have suggested that the pathogenesis of these
lymphoproliferative tumours entails the reactivation of latent
oncogenic viruses of the herpes group by the chronic antigenic
stimulation of the graft in the immunosuppressed patient.
Nuclear sex determination in our patient based on both X and
Y chromosome counts clearly showed that the tumour was of
host origin and had not been transplanted along with the donor
graft.'2
INDICATIONS
The indications for transplantation are becoming clearer. The
largest group of potential recipients are those with end-stage
cirrhosis, particularly when chronic encephalopathy is the main
clinical feature. Several will be found on investigation to have
developed a hepatoma. An assessment of pulmonary function is
also important, for interstitial fibrosis and disturbances of
ventilation-perfusion balance (with arteriovenous shunting in
some) are common. These patients are also likely to have electrolyte imbalance and they are highly susceptible to infection. The
timing of the operation in these patients is particularly difficult,
although with the progress being made in techniques of artificial
liver support this should become less of a problem.22
A small group of patients for whom transplantation should be
considered, and in whom the prognosis was previously very poor,
are those with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Two were included in our
series. One died with widespread thrombosis in portal and hepatic
venous systems, and because of this experience the second, who
was operated on only recently, was maintained on low dose
subcutaneous heparin. An excellent longer term result from
Starzl's series has also recently been reported.23
Only a small percentage of those with primary liver cancer will
finally prove suitable for grafting since metastases are so often
present by the time the lesion is diagnosed. Undoubtedly,
however, the tumour can be completely removed, as shown in one
patient who survived for five years and had no evidence of
tumour at necropsy (case 9) and in another who remains well
nearly three years after transplantation (case 34). Bone scanning
is essential in excluding metastases outside the liver, and both
inferior venacavography and lymphangiography are valuable in
detecting involvement of retroperitoneal abdominal lymph nodes.
It is, however, virtually impossible to exclude small metastases
in lymph nodes within the porta hepatis. In those patients with a
malignant hepatoma arising in a non-cirrhotic liver, it is essential
to eliminate the possibility of treatment by resection. Of all the
investigations available, hepatic arteriography is the most helpful
in determining whether one or both lobes are affected.
With respect to carcinoma of the hepatic ducts, tumour
recurrence has occurred in most of our cases despite the intrinsic
low malignancy of the growth. Terblanche et al12 have argued
that good palliation can be obtained with a T-tube cannulation
and x-irradiation. But cases such as case 48, where transplantation
was carried out at an earlier stage and where attempts to
cannulate the growth had been resisted, augur well for the future.
The results of liver grafting for metastatic tumour, both in the
present studies and in that of Starzl, have been poor due to early
tumour recurrence.
We have been reluctant to advise liver transplantation for
children or infants with biliary atresia or other forms of chronic
liver disease, partly because of the side effects of prolonged
immunosuppressive treatment, which include growth retardation, as well as the lack of donors in this age group. Nevertheless, these constitute the most successful group of cases in
Starzl's series. 325 He has also had encouraging results in
patients with certain inborn errors of metabolism, particularly
Wilson's disease, in which the primary defect may reside in the
liver.26 One patient lived for six years, and the other is doing
well at five and a half years. Neurological dysfunction gradually
improved after the transplant and liver biopsy specimens showed
no recurrence of copper overload. Starzl has also carried out
liver transplantation for x,-antitrypsin deficiency and tyrosinaemia27 and there was also one case of Niemann-Pick disease.28
DENVER SERIES
In Starzl's series there has been a steady improvement in
overall survival figures. Of 103 patients who were transplanted
a year or more ago, 30 (2900) have survived for at least one year.
One-year survival figures were as high as 450o in some groups.
Nevertheless, the early morbidity was high, although most of
the patients who reached the one year mark continued to do well
thereafter, as has been shown in our series. In the Denver series
half of those who survived for one year were still alive at the
time of writing. Fifteen survived for two years, eight for three
years, and four for five years. The longest survivor in Starzl's
series (and in the world) has lived for 6 years and 4 months since
transplantation. She is living at home, attending school, and has
normal liver function. Two other five-year survivors are also
completely well. 7
As confidence in liver transplantation increases, with earlier
operation and the diminished tendency of the recipient to
reject the grafted liver, both the overall and long-term results of
liver transplantation might be better than those of kidney
grafting. Indeed, during the past 12 months our immediate
results for liver grafting have been better than those obtained
with cadaveric renal transplantation.
Liver grafting is a complicated procedure involving a large team and
we are sincerely grateful to all the medical, nursing, and technical
colleagues in our liver transplantation programme. The work would
not have been possible without active and generous support from the
departments of anaesthetics, pathology, clinical biochemistry,
haematology, and bacteriology in our two hospitals. We also thank the
National Blood Transfusion Service, the National Organ Matching
Service, Eurotransplant, and our colleagues in hospitals where donor
livers have been removed. Generous grants from the Wellcome Trust
and the Medical Research Council are also gratefully acknowledged.

Incidence of post-abortion psychosis: a prospective study
COLIN BREWER
British Medical Journal, 1977, 1, 476-477
Summary
Twenty-one consultant psychiatrists participated in a
prospective study of post-abortion psychosis among a
population of 1 333 000 people. During the 15-month
study only a single case was reported, concerning a
woman who had a history of two previous attacks of
puerperal psychosis. The incidence of post-abortion
psychosis was 0 3 per 1000 legal abortions. The incidence
of puerperal psychosis, which was also studied as an
index of validity, was 17 per 1000 deliveries. This conforms with currently accepted figures and indicates that
the study population was representative. I suggest that
physiological changes, which are probably more profound after childbirth than after abortion, may be
responsible for the higher incidence of puerperal
psychosis.
Introduction
Although the incidence of serious mental disturbance after
legal abortion is generally held to be low, no British studies
provide any precise figures. Jansson' reported an incidence of
19 2 admissions per 1000 legal abortions and 2-7 admissions per
1000 illegal and spontaneous abortions within 12 months of
abortion, but this study related to a period (1952-6) when
abortion in Sweden was not freely available. A significant proportion of those aborted had a history of serious psychiatric
disorder. Jansson's findings are of doubtful relevance to conditions in Britain today since most aborted women have no such
history and changing attitudes to abortion may have made it a
less disturbing experience.

COLIN BREWER, MRCPSYCH, lecturer
This conclusion certainly may be drawn from a recent study
in the USA by Tietze and Lewit.2 In a follow-up of 73 000
legally aborted women they found that the incidence of "major
psychiatric complications" (virtually synonymous with admission to a psychiatric ward) was 0-2-0-4 per 1000 abortions.
Diagnostic concepts and admission procedures in the USA,
however, differ from those used here, and the follow-up period
was short.
Even if the incidence of post-abortion psychosis were similar
to that of puerperal psychosis-that is, between one and two per
1000 deliveries-it would be necessary to survey at least 3000
aborted women to obtain valid figures. No published British
study has entailed anything like such numbers. A different
approach is to find out how many women are admitted to particular psychiatric hospitals within a given period after a legal
abortion and to relate it to the number of abortions performed
in their catchment area populations during the study period.
This method was adopted by Jansson, and the existence of
reliable regional abortion statistics as a consequence of the 1967
Abortion Act enabled me to use a similar method in the present
study.
Method
Twenty consultants in adult general psychiatry practising in the
West Midlands Region, and the consultant in charge of the regional
unit for adolescents took part in a prospective survey that began on
1 July 1975 and ended on 30 September 1976. They recorded all
patients admitted under their care who had had a legal abortion during
the previous three months. Patients were divided into two categories,
namely-primary post-abortion psychosis (category A) or secondary
post-abortion psychosis (category B). Category A was defined as "a
serious disorder requiring admission, and manifesting delusions
and/or hallucinations, or gross overactivity, in the absence of a previous history of significant psychiatric disorder." Category B was
defined as category A but referred to women with a previous history
of psychiatric disorder requiring admission to hospital.
The record form made it clear that these categories were intended
to embrace "such diagnoses as mania, schizophrenia, delirium, and
the more serious cases of depression." The consultants were also asked
to record any patients who did not satisfy the rather narrow criteria
of the two categories, but who had been legally aborted during the
previous three months.
To calculate the approximate number of abortions occurring during
the study period in their catchment areas, each consultant was asked
to state the population for which he was responsible (excluding the
