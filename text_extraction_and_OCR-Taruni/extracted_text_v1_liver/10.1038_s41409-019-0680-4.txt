Abstract
This retrospective study explored the incidence of autoimmune cytopenia (AIC) in 530 paediatric and adult patients with
acquired aplastic anaemia (aAA) who underwent first allogeneic HSCT between 2002 and 2012. AIC was a rare
complication with a cumulative incidence of AIC at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years post HSCT of 2.5% (1.2–3.9 95% CI), 4.4%
(2.6–6.2 95% CI), 4.6% (2.8–6.5 95% CI) and 5.1% (3.1–7.2 95% CI). Overall survival at 5 years after diagnosis of AIC was
85.9% (71–100 95% CI). Twenty-five patients were diagnosed with AIC at a median of 10.6 (2.6–91.5) months post HSCT.
Eight (32%) patients were diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), seven (28%) with autoimmune haemolytic
anaemia (AIHA), seven (24%) with Evans syndrome and four (16%) with autoimmune neutropenia (AIN). Treatment
strategies were heterogeneous. Complete responses were seen in 12 of 25 patients, with death in three patients. In
multivariable Cox analysis of a subgroup of 475 patients, peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant was associated with
higher risk of AIC compared with bone marrow (BM) when conditioning regimens contained fludarabine and/or
alemtuzumab (2.81 [1.06–7.49 95% CI]; p = 0.038), or anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) (2.86 [1.11–7.37 95% CI]; p =
0.029). Myeloablative conditioning was associated with a lower risk of AIC compared with reduced intensity conditioning
(RIC) in fludarabine and/or alemtuzumab (0.34 [0.12–0.98 95% CI]; p = 0.046) and ATG containing regimens (0.34
[0.12–0.95 95% CI]; p = 0.04). These findings provide clinically useful information regarding the incidence of a rare and
potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic HSCT for aAA, and further support for BM as the preferred stem cell
source for transplant of patients with aAA.
Introduction
Graft versus host disease (GvHD) describes alloreactivity
between a transplanted donor immune system and host
major or minor histocompatibility antigen, and is the principal immune mediated complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The phenomenon of
post-HSCT autoimmune disease (AID) is also recognized,
and is the pathological autoreactivity towards nonhistocompatibility antigen common to donor and recipient.
Reported transmission of autoantibodies and AIDs from
donor to recipient, and a case of immune thrombocytopenia
(ITP) in the context of syngeneic HSCT suggest that this is
a pathological entity distinct from GvHD [1, 2]. Whether
autoreactivity develops exclusively in the graft, or also in
host immune cells that have survived conditioning has not
been determined. The most commonly encountered AIDs
post HSCT are autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) [3]. AICs
have previously been described in a number of HSCT
contexts, but large registry studies have not explored AIC
following HSCT for a single disease entity [4–9]. Acquired

aplastic anaemia (aAA) is thought to be an autoimmune
disorder in most cases [10] and we hypothesised that the
incidence of post HSCT AIC in this population may be
higher than described in other patient populations. We also
sought to explore AIC diagnostic strategies, treatment
approaches and patient outcomes across European Society
for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) centres.
Methods
This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the EBMT Autoimmune
Disease Working Party and Severe Aplastic Anaemia
Working Party. All EBMT centres performing allogeneic
HSCT for aAA were invited to participate in the study.
Centres agreeing to participate provided data on all consecutive paediatric and adult patients with aAA treated
between January 2002 and December 2012 with first allogeneic HSCT. Centres confirmed whether AIC was diagnosed post-HSCT. Patients diagnosed with AIC at any time
point prior to HSCT were excluded. Data for all patients
were extracted from the EBMT registry, and centres identifying cases of AIC provided additional data on diagnostic
criteria and investigations undertaken, therapies administered and patient outcome.
The primary study objective was to estimate the incidence of AIC diagnosed after allogeneic HSCT for aAA.
Secondary objectives were to identify patient, donor and
HSCT-related risk factors for development of AIC; to scope
diagnostic criteria for AIC used across EBMT centres; to
explore treatment strategies and response; and to estimate
overall survival (OS) following onset of AIC.
ITP, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) and
autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) were defined as a new or
worsening thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of
<100 × 109
/L, a new or worsening anaemia with a fall in
haemoglobin of ≥20 g/L and new or worsening neutropenia
<1.5 × 109
/L respectively. Centres were asked to indicate
further laboratory features that had established an AIC
diagnosis. Lines of treatment are presented as reported by
participating centres. Complete response was defined as a
normalisation of haemoglobin, platelet or neutrophil count
and normalisation of biochemical markers of haemolysis for
AIHA and Evans syndrome. Partial response was defined as
an improvement but not normalisation, and no response as
either no improvement or a decline in these parameters.
Pre-transplant patient characteristics were expressed as
the median and range for continuous variables and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. The
primary endpoint was the incidence of post-transplant AIC,
evaluated at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years after transplant. OS for the
study cohort was evaluated at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years after
transplant. OS after AIC diagnosis was analysed separately
and evaluated at 5 years after AIC diagnosis. Median
follow-up was determined using the reverse Kaplan–Meier
method. OS was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier product
limit estimation method, and differences in subgroups were
assessed by the log-rank test. Cumulative incidences of AIC
and death without AIC were analysed together in a competing risks framework. Subgroup differences were assessed
using Gray’s test. The effect of specific conditioning
regimens on the incidence of AIC and mortality without
AIC were investigated using multivariable Cox models,
providing cause specific hazards. The association between
chronic GvHD and AIC was explored using a time dependent Cox model. A landmark analysis was used to compare
incidence of AIC between those patients with and without
acute GvHD. All reported estimates include 95% confidence intervals. All p-values were two-sided and p < 0.05
was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and
R version 3.0.3.
Results
A total of 530 patients (37.2% paediatric, 62.8% adult) from
41 participating centres were eligible for inclusion in the
study. Median age at HSCT was 21.4 years (1.7–69.8).
Median follow-up time was 6.4 years (interquartile range
4.2–9.0), and 1, 5 and 10-year OS for the cohort was 85.3%
(82.3–88.4 95% CI), 80.8% (77.4–84.2 95% CI) and 78.8%
(75.0–82.6 95% CI).
Characteristics of patients, grafts and conditioning regimens are provided in Table 1. Twenty-five patients were
diagnosed with AIC at a median of 10.6 (2.6–91.5) months
post allogeneic HSCT. Specific diagnoses were: 32.0%
(n = 8) ITP, 28.0% (n = 7) AIHA, 24.0% (n = 6) Evans
syndrome (five cases with AIHA and ITP, one case with
AIHA and AIN) and 16.0% (n = 4) AIN (Table 2).
The cumulative incidence of AIC at 1, 3, 5 and 10 years
post HSCT was 2.5% (1.2–3.9 95% CI), 4.4% (2.6–6.2 95%
CI), 4.6% (2.8–6.5 95% CI) and 5.1% (3.1–7.2 95% CI),
respectively. OS at 5 years after diagnosis of AIC was
85.9% (71–100 95% CI), with all deaths occurring within
the first 12 months.
Diagnostic criteria
As the study was retrospective, central review of peripheral
blood smears and bone marrow examination (BME) samples was not possible. In addition to reporting diagnostic
criteria, centres were asked to report whether all differential
diagnoses had been excluded. It was decided a priori to
include all reported cases of AIC in study analysis, and

describe the diagnostic features employed by participating
centres in order to present real-world practice during the
study period. For ITP, all patients had a new or worsening
thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of <100 × 109
/L.
BME was performed in 6/8 patients, with four displaying
normo- or hyper-regenerative megakaryopoiesis, and two
other morphological or histological findings. Five centres
indicated that differential diagnoses (disease relapse, new
haematological malignancy, drug induced thrombocytopenia, infection, thrombotic microangiopathy and alloimmune
thrombocytopenia) had been excluded, two centres reported
that this was unknown and one that all differential diagnoses had not been excluded. All AIHA patients had a
new or worsening anaemia with a fall in haemoglobin
of ≥20 g/L. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) was performed in
6/7 cases with one IgG positive, and five IgG and C3d
positive (Table 2). All centres identified at least one biochemical marker of haemolysis (raised lactate dehydrogenase, unconjugated hyper-bilirubinaemia or reduced
haptoglobin) and three identified a peripheral blood reticulocytosis. Three centres indicated that differential diagnoses
had been excluded (disease relapse, new haematological
malignancy, drug induced haemolysis, infection, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and alloimmune haemolytic anaemia), three reported this information was
unknown and one that all differential diagnoses had not
been excluded. Paired donor–recipient ABO blood group
compatibility data were not complete for any of the patients
diagnosed with AIHA. All cases of Evans syndrome
were DAT positive (4 IgG, 2 IgG and C3d) and all cases
involving AIHA and ITP had BME with four displaying
normo- or hyper-regenerative megakaryopoiesis. Biochemical markers of haemolysis were present in 5/6 cases and
two patients had a peripheral blood reticulocytosis. Three
centres indicated that differential diagnoses (as for AIHA
and ITP or AIN accordingly) had been excluded, two that
this information was unknown and one that all differential
diagnoses had not been excluded. Anti-neutrophil antibodies (ANAb) were screened for by either direct or indirect
method in all AIN cases, and also in the Evans syndrome
case presenting with AIHA and AIN. Antibodies were only
detected in one patient. Three centres reported that differential diagnoses (disease relapse, new haematological
malignancy, infection and drug induced neutropenia) had
been excluded and one reported these data are unknown.
Treatment and response
Of 25 patients diagnosed with AIC, 21 (84%) were treated,
while 2 (8%) ITP (Cases 1 and 2) and 2 (8%) AIN patients
(Cases 22 and 23) received no AIC specific therapy
(Table 2). Treatment approach was heterogeneous regarding
both choice of therapeutic agents, and number of agents
used at each treatment line (Table 2). The mainstays of
therapy for ITP, AIHA and Evans syndrome were
corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).
Corticosteroids were administered to 50%, 100 and 83% of

treated ITP, AIHA and Evans syndrome patients, respectively. IVIg was administered concurrently with corticosteroids, or as first or second-line monotherapy, in 66.7, 42.9
and 83.3% of ITP, AIHA and Evans syndrome patients.
Rituximab was administered to 71.4% and 83.3% of
patients with AIHA and Evans syndrome, respectively, but
only 16.7% of ITP patients. Other immunomodulatory
therapies for this group of patients were mycophenolate
mofetil 15%, and cyclosporine A 15%. One patient with
Evans syndrome presenting with AIHA and AIN (Case 20)
received cyclophosphamide and underwent plasma
exchange. Four (19.0%) patients did not respond or relapsed
following immunomodulatory therapy and underwent
splenectomy, with two achieving CR (ITP Case 7, AIHA
Case 15), one PR (Evans syndrome Case 21) and one
patient dying without responding (AIHA and AIN Case 20).
Of the four patients with AIN, two (Cases 24 and 25) were
treated with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor to PR,
one of whom required second-line therapy and achieved CR
with rituximab (Case 25).
After excluding patients who did not require treatment,
10 out of this subgroup of 21 patients did not respond to
first-line therapy, with 7 of 17, and 4 of 7 not responding to
second or third-line therapy, respectively. Of the 11 of 21
treated patients who achieved either complete or partial
response to first-line therapy, nearly two-thirds (7/11)
relapsed and required further treatment. AIC status at last
treatment was 4/25 untreated, 12/25 CR, 6/25 in PR and 3/
25 NR. Six out of twenty one treated patients required ongoing maintenance therapy (Table 2). Highest CR rate at
last follow-up was seen in AIHA (6/7 patients) and lowest
in Evans syndrome (1/7). Incidence of mortality was 13%
(0–26% 95% CI) at 2 years, with one death in CR from a
non-AIC HSCT-related complication (Case 3, Table 2) and
two without responding to AIC therapy who both died from
infection (Cases 8 and 20, Table 2).
Risk factors for development of AIC
In univariable analysis, cumulative incidence of AIC at
10 years post HSCT did not vary with patient sex, patient
age group, interval from aAA diagnosis to HSCT,
patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) status, donor type,
patient-donor CMV match, patient-donor sex match or
conditioning with TBI (Table 1). Of 191 unrelated
donor–recipient pairs, 61 were reported as fully human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched, however HLA data
were unavailable for the remaining 110 and so further
analysis could not be performed. The overall incidence of
grade II–IV aGvHD was 13% (9–16 95% CI). There was
no difference in 10-year incidence of AIC between patients
with and without aGVHD (2% [0–5 95% CI] vs 5% [2–7
95% CI], p = 0.3). The incidence of limited and extensive
cGvHD was 20% (16–24 95% CI) at both 60 and
120 months. There was no association between cGvHD
and development of AIC (Hazard ratio 0.6 [0.14–7 95%
CI], p = 0.66). We did not evaluate the temporal relationship between withdrawal of immunosuppression and
onset of AIC. Ten-year cumulative incidence of AIC was
higher amongst patients treated with non-myeloablative
conditioning (MAC) compared with MAC (8.1% [4.2–12.1
95% CI] vs 2.9% [0.6–5.2 95% CI], p = 0.005), with
conditioning regimens containing fludarabine compared
with regimens not containing fludarabine (6.5% [3.7–9.4
95% CI] vs 3.0% [1.9–5.8 95% CI], p = 0.037) and with
alemtuzumab containing regimens compared with nonAlemtuzumab containing regimens (9.6% [4.2–15.1 95%
CI] vs 3.7% [1.6–5.7 95% CI], p = 0.007). Conditioning
with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was associated with a
lower incidence of AIC than conditioning without ATG
(3.4% [0.0–6.3 95% CI] vs 6.7% [3.7–9.6 95% CI], p =
0.04). Incidence of AIC was also significantly higher in
patients receiving peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) (9.7%
[4.7–14.8 95% CI]) compared with umbilical cord blood
(UCB) (5.0% [0.0–14.6 95% CI]) and bone marrow (BM)
(3.3% [1.2–5.6 95% CI]) (p = 0.01). Incidence of AIC was
not higher in regimens containing alemtuzumab and fludarabine compared with alemtuzumab alone (10.7%
[4.4–17.0 95% CI] vs 4.8% [0–13.9 95% CI]; p = 0.408),
nor in regimens containing ATG and fludarabine compared
with ATG alone (4.2% [0.0–9.6 95% CI] vs 2.7% [0.0–5.6
95% CI]; p = 0.969).
A subgroup of 475 patients who received either BM or
PBSC grafts and had complete information on conditioning
regimen were included in a multivariable analysis. Two
models explored the independent association of conditioning intensity, stem cell source, use of alemtuzumab and/or
fludarabine or use of ATG with risk of AIC (Table 3). In the
alemtuzumab and/or fludarabine model, these agents were
not associated with an increased risk of AIC (1.25
[0.37–4.19 95% CI]; p = 0.723). However, after adjustment
for alemtuzumab and/or fludarabine, transplant with PBSC
remained independently associated with a higher risk of
AIC (2.81 [1.06–7.49 95% CI]; p = 0.038), and MAC with
lower risk (0.34 [0.12–0.98 95% CI]; p = 0.046). Likewise,
in the multivariable ATG model, use of this serotherapy in
conditioning was not associated with higher risk of AIC
(0.55 [0.21–1.41 95% CI]; p = 0.212) but PBSC (2.86
[1.11–7.37 95% CI]; p = 0.029) and MAC (0.34 [0.12–0.95
95% CI]; p = 0.04) remained independently associated with
higher and lower risk, respectively. There was no increase
in the competing risk, death without AIC, associated with
any of these variables. Owing to small number of AIC cases
it was not possible to adjust for additional characteristics
and so these findings are not generalizable beyond the study
population.

Discussion
Ten-year cumulative incidence of AIC after allogeneic
HSCT for aAA was 5.1% (3.1–7.2 95% CI). ITP was the
most frequent AIC diagnosis, followed by AIHA, Evans
and AIN. BME was not performed in two patients diagnosed with ITP. In a further two patients BME did not
demonstrate normo- or hyper-regenerative megakaryopoiesis. It is possible that these patients were misdiagnosed
biasing our results. AIC complicated both the early and late
post-HSCT period, with time of diagnosis ranging from
2.6 months to 7.6 years. Incidence of AIC in our cohort is
similar to that reported in previous studies of HSCT
populations. In paediatric patients transplanted with a range
of allogeneic graft types for malignant and non-malignant
conditions, a 2.4–2.5% 10-year incidence of AIC, and a
2.4% incidence of AIHA are reported [6, 8]. Among adult
recipients of UCB HSCT for haematological malignancy,
3 year incidence of AIHA and ITP were 5.4% and 1.4%,
respectively [4]. Incidence of AIHA was similar at
4.1–4.4% amongst adult recipients transplanted with a
range of graft types [7, 11]. Median time of diagnosis in
these studies ranged from 0.8 months to 8.4 years.
Cases of AIC in our study were diagnosed in accordance
with recognized criteria [12–14]. In the absence of haematological or biochemical markers of platelet destruction, ITP
is a diagnosis of exclusion requiring thorough assessment.
However BME is recommended only in selected paediatric
and adult patients, generally those in whom secondary ITP
is suspected, or adults over 60 [15, 16]. In our present study,
most patients diagnosed with ITP and all with Evans syndrome underwent BME, which may reflect the need to
exclude HSCT specific differentials including disease
relapse and graft failure. While all cases of AIHA, and all
but one case of Evans syndrome presented with at least one
abnormal biochemical marker of haemolysis, reticulocytosis
was not a dominant feature present in one-third of AIHA
and Evans syndrome patients. Testing for ANAb is
recommended as part of neutropenia work-up, however
antibodies are typically of low titre and low avidity and
testing of rather limited sensitivity and specificity [14, 17];
thus a negative ANAb screen does not exclude a diagnosis
of AIN. In line with this, all cases of AIN were tested for
ANAb but the majority were negative.
Most ITP patients were treated with corticosteroid or
IVIg, while rituximab was infrequently used. Fifty percent
of ITP patients achieved either CR or PR with each line of
therapy. In the general population a response to first-line
steroids of up to 80% has been reported [16, 18], and the
combination of IVIg with corticosteroid therapy may hasten
platelet recovery [19]. In randomized studies, the combination of rituximab with dexamethasone compared with
dexamethasone alone has been shown to improve response
rates from 36–37 to 58–63% [20, 21]. Case reports and
series of patients with ITP post HSCT have reported
response rates of 30–50% following first and second-line
treatment, with the former largely consisting of corticosteroid with or without IVIg, and the latter IVIg, rituximab or

splenectomy [22–26]. In cases of post-HSCT ITP refractory
to standard therapy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists
(TPO-RAs) have proven effective [27–29]. In our cohort no
patients were treated with TPO-RAs, which may reflect
European Medicines Agency licensing of romiplostim in
2009 and eltrombopag in 2010, during the last 3 years of
our study eligibility period.
Although randomized data are lacking, corticosteroids
are an established first-line therapy for AIHA with retrospective studies reporting responses of ~75% [30]. Again,
there is limited evidence for second-line therapy, but
rituximab or splenectomy are the most commonly
described [31]. Similar strategies are reported in the
management of paediatric and adult Evans syndrome
[32, 33]. Patients in our study were largely treated
according to this paradigm: all patients with AIHA
received first-line corticosteroid with or without IVIg.
One patient requiring second-line therapy was re-treated
with corticosteroids; and all others received second-line
rituximab with all patients achieving a CR or PR. Evans
syndrome appeared the most challenging AIC to treat,
with the greatest proportion of non-responders. However,
there was no excess of deaths in this group compared with
other AIC diagnoses. In cases series of patients with
AIHA post-HSCT, 14–33% response rates are reported
with prednisolone alone and 40–45% with prednisolone in
combination with rituximab or IVIg [6–9, 26, 34]. In these
series, up to 33% of patients were reported refractory to
therapy, whereas all patients in our series were in CR or
PR at last follow-up.
Primary AIN is typically a disease of infancy, while
secondary AIN occurs mostly in adults in the context of
systemic AID [35]. Neutropenia may respond to treatment
of the underlying AID with GCSF administered cautiously
owing to concern about disease flare [14, 17]. Case reports
of AIN post HSCT have described disease ranging from
transient positive ANAb and neutropenia not requiring
treatment [36] to persistent neutropenia requiring GCSF
support alone [5] or in combination with additional immunomodulatory agents [6]. This pattern of disease is borne
out in our study with half of diagnosed patients requiring no
specific therapy. Two were treated with GCSF, one of
whom required additional therapy with rituximab. Both
treated patients achieved a PR.
The pathogenesis of AID remains poorly understood but
relates to breakdown in mechanisms of self-tolerance. First,
there may be a genetic role, with documented familial
aggregation of autoimmune conditions [37], the association
of certain HLA types with AIDs [38] and autoimmunity
manifesting in inherited primary immunodeficiency [39].
Secondly, environmental factors may contribute; in murine
models inflammatory states have been show to trigger and
promote autoreactive T-cell populations [40, 41], and
infection may be associated with lymphodepletion and
homeostatic expansion favouring autoreactive clones [42].
Finally, iatrogenic dysregulation of central and peripheral
immune tolerance through radio-, chemo- or immunotherapy may lead to impaired thymic function, lymphodepletion
and homeostatic expansion and failure of regulatory T-cell
control. Although the pathogenesis of secondary AIDs post
HSCT also remains unclear, these factors may play a role.
In univariable analysis we identified an increased incidence
of AIC amongst patients treated with alemtuzumab or fludarabine. These two drugs have been associated with
autoimmune phenomenon in a range of therapeutic settings
[43–51] and in a cohort of aAA HSCT patients conditioned
with fludarabine and alemtuzumab 14% of patients developed autoimmune complications [52]. In contrast with our
findings, conditioning with ATG has been associated with
an increased risk of secondary autoimmune phenomenon
following autologous HSCT for primary AID [45, 46], with
lymphocyte depletion the putative mechanism. These findings did not remain significant in multivariable analysis,
possibly due to small number of events in subgroup analysis, and further investigation is warranted. An association
between post-HSCT AID and cGvHD has been reported,
although inconsistently [4, 6–8, 26]. In this study an association between AIC and GvHD was not identified.
In allogeneic HSCT for aAA, BM conveys a lower risk of
GvHD and a survival advantage compared with PBSC, and is
the preferred stem cell source in all age groups
and in recipients of sibling and unrelated donor transplants
[53–56]. Nonetheless, approximately one-third of all patients
were transplanted with either PBSC or UCB in our study.
Incidence of AIC was significantly higher amongst recipients
of PBSC compared with UCB and BM. In multivariable
analysis, after adjustment for concurrent ATG, and fludarabine and/or alemtuzumab, transplant with PBSC and
reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) was independently
associated with a higher risk of AIC. A higher number of
immunocompetent cells are harvested and transplanted with
PBSC compared with BM [57], and immune recovery is
more rapid [58]. Early T-cell recovery occurs predominantly
through peripheral expansion, rather than de novo thymic
ontogenesis in both T replete and deplete grafts [59, 60]. In
RIC, host T cells that survive the conditioning regimen may
also expand through this mechanism [61]. Such homeostatic
expansion contributes to a narrow T-cell repertoire, qualitative immune deficiencies [61] and may favour autoreactive
clones [42], contributing to the emergence of AID [62]. It is
possible that the larger number of immunocompetent cells
and more rapid immune reconstitution in PBSC compared
with BM, and the potential for homeostatic expansion of host
lymphocytes in RIC promotes development of autoimmunity; immune reconstitution studies in patients with
AIC may provide further detail.
Autoimmune cytopenias (AIC) following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant for acquired. . . 447

This is the first study to explore AIC following allogeneic HSCT in a large cohort for a single disease indication, and provides clinically useful information on the
incidence of this rare and potentially life-threatening
complication in paediatric and adult patients. The retrospective study design may impact on our estimate of AIC
incidence: cases may not have been reported and we were
unable to confirm AIC diagnoses through central review
of pathology. For eight patients with AIC, centres reported that it was unknown whether all differential diagnoses
had been excluded, and for 3 that all differentials had not
been excluded. These cases were included in analysis to
reflect real-world practice and highlight the challenging
nature of establishing these diagnoses, but it remains
possible that these patients were misdiagnosed biasing our
results. As there were relatively few cases of AIC, we
were able to develop a multivariable model with a
small number of variables that limits generalisability
of our findings. We did not explore the role of pretransplantation therapy on risk of developing AIC.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the incidence of AIC post allogeneic
HSCT for aAA is similar to that reported among recipients
of HSCT for other primary diseases. Autoimmunity
should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
cytopenias occurring in both the early and late post
HSCT period. Our study highlights heterogeneity in the
approach to investigation and management of AIC
between EBMT centres. As such standardization of
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, along with
data registration (via the EBMT and other databases),
is warranted to inform harmonized recommendations
for investigation and management of suspected AIC.
Response rates in this cohort are similar to previous data
and OS in the AIC group was not shorter than in the
overall cohort. In multivariable analysis we identified an
increased risk of AIC following PBSC and RIC HSCT in
this cohort, which may contribute further to the evidence
that BM is the preferred stem cell source for transplant of
patients with aAA.
