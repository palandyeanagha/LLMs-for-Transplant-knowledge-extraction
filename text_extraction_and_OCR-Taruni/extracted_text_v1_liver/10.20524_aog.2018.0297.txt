Abstract Background Post-transplant anastomotic biliary strictures remain refractory to endoscopic 
therapy in a considerable number of cases. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare fullycovered self-expandable metal and plastic stents in the management of post-transplant biliary 
strictures.
Methods A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model; results were expressed as 
odds ratio (OR) and mean standardized difference. The primary outcome was stricture resolution, 
while recurrence rate after stent placement, treatment time, and safety of the procedure were the 
secondary outcomes.
Results Through a systematic literature review until October 2017, we identified 7 studies, of which 
4 were randomized controlled trials. Stricture resolution was slightly higher with metal stents, 
with no statistical difference between the two procedures (OR 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.60-3.15; P=0.45) and low heterogeneity (I2=6%). Stricture recurrence showed a non-significant 
trend in favor of plastic stents (OR 1.82, 95%CI 0.52-6.31, P=0.35). Endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography with placement of metal stents offered a significant improvement 
in terms of reduced treatment time (mean standardized difference: -3.58 months, 95%CI -6.23 
to -0.93; P=0.008), but with more frequent complications, although not significantly so (OR 2.34, 
95%CI 0.75-7.25; P=0.14). Sensitivity analysis confirmed all the findings.
Conclusion Metal stents appear to be a promising tool that can decrease treatment time, although 
there is still no clear evidence of their superiority over plastic stents in terms of efficacy.

Introduction
Biliary stricture represents one of the most frequently 
observed complications after orthotopic liver transplantation 
(OLT), occurring in 40% of patients who undergo OLT, 
particularly those receiving an organ from a living donor [1,2]. 
After OLT, anastomotic strictures (80%) are more common 
than non-anastomotic strictures, which result mainly from 
hepatic ischemia and are less responsive to endoscopic therapy, 
requiring a longer duration of endoscopic intervention and 
sometimes even re-transplantation [3,4].
While recent years have seen significant improvement 
in the management of anastomotic biliary strictures (ABSs) 
using balloon dilation and multiple plastic stents, ABSs 
remain refractory to endoscopic therapy in a non-negligible 
number of cases, with relatively high rates of recurrence, 
particularly in the case of late ABSs (presenting later than

1  month post-OLT) [5-10]. Balloon dilation with stent 
placement is more effective than balloon dilation alone, and 
progressively increasing the number of stents placed during 
subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 
(ERCP) procedures seems to be the most effective treatment 
approach [11,12]. However, although serial balloon dilation 
and plastic stent exchanges (usually 3  months apart over an 
extended period) have been used worldwide for several years, 
the optimal strategy for managing ABSs still needs to be 
defined [11,12].
Fully-covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) are 
already used in clinical practice to treat malignant strictures, 
and in recent years they have also demonstrated interesting 
results in the management of benign conditions, including 
post-OLT ABS [13]. The main potential benefit of FCSEMS 
is their large caliber and longer duration of patency, allowing 
them to be left in place longer than plastic stents, thus 
reducing the need for procedures for serial dilations and stent 
placement [12].
There is currently limited comparative evidence 
on the use of FCSEMS with respect to plastic stents in 
the management of post-OLT ABS. In this systematic 
review, we performed a pairwise meta-analysis of studies 
comparing the efficacy of FCSEMS and plastic stents in 
the resolution of post-transplant ABSs. In addition, we 
evaluated as secondary outcomes the ABS recurrence rate 
after stent placement, the treatment time and the safety of 
the procedure.
Materials and methods
This meta-analysis was performed in accordance with 
indications described in the Cochrane Handbook [14] 
and was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 
guidelines [15].
Search strategy and selection criteria
Fig.  1 presents the search strategy followed in the metaanalysis. A computerized bibliographic search was performed 
on PubMed/Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and Cochrane 
library databases, independently by two authors (AF, ECR),

using the following key words: “anastomotic biliary stricture”, 
“metal stent”, “plastic stent” and “ERCP”. A  complementary 
manual search was performed by checking the references of 
all the main review articles on this topic, to identify possible 
additional studies.
Eligible studies were randomized-controlled trials 
(RCTs) and retrospective studies published until October 
2017 that met the following inclusion criteria: (a) patients: 
adults undergoing ERCP and with radiologically confirmed 
diagnosis of post-OLT anastomotic biliary stricture; 
(b) intervention: ERCP with placement of FCSEMS; 
(c) comparator: ERCP with placement of multiple plastic 
stents; and (d) outcomes: stricture resolution as a primary 
outcome, stricture recurrence, treatment time (defined as 
time lapse between first and last therapeutic ERCP session), 
and complication rate as secondary outcomes.
We excluded narrative and systematic reviews [16], 
studies that did not report any of the main outcomes, 
and any studies not written in English. When incomplete 
information was available, attempts were made to contact the 
corresponding authors for additional data. Disagreements 
were resolved by discussion and following a third opinion 
(NM).
The quality of the included studies was assessed by two 
authors independently (AF, ECR), according to the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of bias [17] for RCTs 
and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale [18] for observational studies. 
Any disagreements were addressed by reevaluation and 
following a third opinion (NM).
Statistical analysis
Pairwise meta-analysis was performed using a randomeffects model to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 
95% confidence interval (CI) [19]. We assessed statistical 
heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, with values over 50% 
indicating substantial heterogeneity, while small study effects 
were assessed by examining funnel plot asymmetry. Multiple 
sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness 
of our findings. These were based on: (a) study design (RCT 
vs. retrospective), and (b) study quality (moderate vs. low). All 
calculations were performed using Review Manager 5.3 (the 
Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) and R 3.0.2 
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), 
“metafor” package.
Results
Included studies
From 258 unique studies identified using the search 
strategy, we included 7, 4 RCTs [20,22,24,25] and 3 
retrospective studies  [21,23,26], whose characteristics are 
summarized in Table  1. All the retrospective studies were 
published as congress abstracts [21,23,26], while RCTs 
were available as full-text papers. Overall, 379 patients were 
included, of whom 148 underwent ERCP with FCSEMS and 
231 were treated with plastic stents. The recruitment period 
ranged from 2006-2015.
In the FCSEMS studies, the stents were removed at 
4-6  months to reassess the stricture and were eventually 
replaced by new stents, whereas plastic stents were removed 
and replaced with a new stent at 3  months. The primary 
outcome, resolution of the stricture, was reported in all of the 
included studies.
In all the studies the two arms were well-balanced at 
baseline in terms of main demographic characteristics, as 
reported in Table  2. The number of procedures per patient 
and the need for balloon dilation were considerably higher in 
patients treated with plastic stents, whereas stent migration 
was usually more frequent in subjects undergoing ERCP with 
FCSEMS placement (Table 2). Notably, all strictures occurred 
>1 month after OLT and were thus classified as late strictures.
Quality assessment was performed in the context of the 
primary outcomes, and two retrospective studies [21,26] 
and 3 RCTs [22,24,25] were considered to be of moderate 
quality, mainly because of the high risk of performance bias. 
Overall and study-level quality assessments are summarized in 
Supplementary Table 1.
Stricture resolution
Data from six studies with 272  patients were pooled for 
the analysis of stricture resolution. The study by Morales et al
was excluded because it did not report the number of patients, 
but only the number of procedures [23]. As depicted in Fig. 2, 
pooled OR was 1.38  (95%CI 0.60-3.15), with no statistical 
difference between the two procedures (P=0.45). A low level 
of heterogeneity was found (χ2=5.34, d.f.=5 [P=0.38], I2=6%) 
and no evidence of publication bias was detected by visual 
examination of a funnel plot (Supplementary Fig. 1A) or with

Begg and Mazumdar’s test (P=0.34). A  sensitivity analysis 
based on both study design and quality confirmed the main 
summary estimate (Supplementary Table 2).
Stricture recurrence and treatment time
Stricture recurrence was reported in 4 
studies  [20,22,24,25] and showed a non-significant trend 
in favor of plastic stents (OR 1.82, 95%CI 0.52-6.31, 
P=0.35) with moderate heterogeneity (χ2=5.17, d.f.=3, 
I2=42%; P=0.16) (Fig.  3). No evidence of publication bias 
was found (Supplementary Fig.  1B). Sensitivity analysis 
confirmed these results across all the subgroups explored 
(Supplementary Table 2).
Six studies enrolling 272  patients reported data on the 
comparison of treatment time between FCSEMS and plastic 
stents (Fig.  4). ERCP with placement of FCSEMS involved 
a significantly shorter treatment time (mean standardized 
difference: -3.58 months, 95%CI -6.23 to -0.93; P=0.008). It should 
be noted, though, that the robustness of this finding was impaired 
by high heterogeneity (χ2=80.20, d.f.=5, I2=94%; P<0.001; Fig. 4).
A funnel plot did not show any evidence of publication bias 
(Supplementary Fig.  1C) and sensitivity analysis confirmed 
the above reported findings, except for the subgroup of 
retrospective studies (Supplementary Table 2).

P=0.13; Supplementary Fig.  2). No evidence of publication 
bias was found (Supplementary Fig.  1D). A  detailed list of 
the complications observed in the two groups is given in 
Supplementary Table  3. In particular, pancreatitis and postprocedural pain were observed more frequently after FCSEMS. 
Sensitivity analysis confirmed these results across all the 
subgroups explored (Supplementary Table 2).
Discussion
Balloon dilation and plastic stents have significantly 
improved the endoscopic management of post-OLT ABSs over 
the past decade, with successful stricture resolution in more 
than 60% of cases [16]. However, ABSs after living donor liver 
transplantation remain refractory to endoscopic therapy in most 
case series [5,8]. Therefore, to overcome the major drawbacks 
of serial balloon dilations with plastic stent exchanges (need to 
repeat the procedure over an extended period, considerable rate 
of recurrence), covered self-expandable metal stents already 
used for treating malignant strictures have been successfully 
introduced into clinical practice. In 2013, a systematic review 
of small case series showed promising results with metal 
stents [16], but a direct comparison between the two procedures 
was not feasible because of the lack of head-to-head RCTs.
Through a meta-analysis of 7 studies (including 4 RCTs), to 
the best of our knowledge the first ever published in this field, 
we made several key observations. First, the two procedures 
do not differ in terms of stricture resolution and recurrence, 
although FCSEMS showed more favorable results concerning 
ABS resolution and higher recurrence rates; the robustness of 
these findings is supported by the low level of heterogeneity 
and their stability in the sensitivity analysis. Second, ERCP with 
placement of FCSEMS is associated with significantly shorter 
treatment time, although this result should be interpreted 
with caution because of the high heterogeneity particularly in 
terms of pancreatitis and post-procedural pain, not reaching 
the significance threshold but sounding a note of caution for 
physicians using this device. Our findings confirm that the 
main potential benefit of FCSEMS is their large caliber and 
longer duration of patency, allowing them to be left in place 
longer than plastic stents and resulting in fewer procedures for 
serial dilations and placement of multiple plastic stents.
In the past, the use of SEMS (mainly uncovered) in 
benign biliary strictures was limited by the difficulty of their 
removal [27]. In recent years, small series have demonstrated 
the successful use of covered SEMS in the treatment of benign 
biliary and pancreatic strictures [27-29]. In all these studies, 
covered SEMS were successfully removed in the majority 
(>95%) of patients. Even in the absence of a clear benefit in

terms of higher efficacy with FCSEMS, the lower need for 
repeated procedures and reduced treatment time constitute 
important points of strength to be considered when defining 
the therapeutic strategy in these patients. In this aspect, our 
results are in keeping with the current literature in the field of 
either benign or malignant strictures [30].
Some concerns were raised in the past about the increased 
migration rate of FCSEMS compared with uncovered 
SEMS  [27]. Unfortunately, since this adverse event was 
inconsistently reported across the included studies, a reliable 
comparative assessment of the migration rate between the 
two procedures was not feasible. Nevertheless, as reported 
in Table  2, the occurrence of this adverse event was rather 
similar in the two treatment groups. Other adverse events were 
mostly mild and easily manageable, with pancreatitis and mild 
bleeding being the most frequently observed complications.
Our study had certain limitations. First, the relatively low 
number of studies, in particular RCTs, and the inclusion of 
both RCTs and retrospective studies necessitate particular 
caution when interpreting our results, especially in the case 
of sensitivity analyses, in which generally no more than 
three studies could be included. Second, there were also 
limitations in the individual studies, in particular regarding 
the limited sample size in most of the RCTs, the presence of 
low-quality studies, or publications in abstract form. Third, 
some of the main outcomes were unevenly reported across the 
included RCTs, mainly because of the different study design. 
Furthermore, there was significant heterogeneity among the 
studies with respect to the secondary outcomes.
On the other hand, our meta-analysis has several strengths. 
In fact, all the included studies presented a similar treatment 
strategy in terms of stents used and therapeutic schedule. 
Moreover, the absence of heterogeneity in the primary 
outcomes and the confirmation of our findings in the sensitivity 
analysis represent further strengths of our study. Finally, all the 
relevant outcomes were explored, including procedural time, 
which constitutes an important aspect in daily clinical practice.
In conclusion, despite the aforementioned weaknesses, 
our meta-analysis represents the first systematic review of 
the literature published in this field and describes an accurate 
comparison between the two techniques exploring the main 
clinical endpoints. Based on our results, FCSEMS appear to 
be a promising and reliable tool that can significantly decrease 
treatment time, although there is still no clear evidence of 
their superiority over plastic stents in terms of better stricture

Summary Box
What is already known:
•	 Biliary stricture represents one of the most
frequently observed complications after orthotopic 
liver transplantation
•	 While significant improvement in the management
of anastomotic biliary strictures (ABSs) has been 
achieved in the last years by using balloon dilation 
and multiple plastic stents, ABSs remain refractory 
to endoscopic therapy in a non-negligible number 
of cases
What the new findings are:
•	 Fully-covered self-expandable metal stents appear
to be a promising and reliable tool that can 
significantly decrease the treatment time, although 
there is still no clear evidence of their superiority 
over plastic stents in terms of better stricture 
resolution
•	 Further large prospective randomized trials are
warranted to confirm the results of our analysis
