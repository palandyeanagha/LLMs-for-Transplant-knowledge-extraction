The Clinical Course and Outcomes of Post-Transplantation 
Diabetes Mellitus after Heart Transplantation
The aim of this study was to describe in more detail the predisposition, natural course, and 
clinical impact of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) after heart transplantation 
(HT). The characteristics and clinical outcomes of 54 patients with PTDM were compared 
with those of 140 patients without PTDM. The mean age of PTDM patients was 
significantly higher than controls (48.9 ± 9.3 vs 38.6 ± 13.3 yr, respectively, P = 0.001), 
and ischemic heart disease was a more common indication of HT (20.4% [11/54] vs 7.1% 
[10/140], respectively, P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, only recipient age (odds ratio, 
1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-2.40; P = 0.001) was associated with PTDM 
development. In 18 patients (33%), PTDM was reversed during the follow-up period, and 
the reversal of PTDM was critically dependent on the time taken to develop PTDM 
(1.9 ± 1.0 months in the reversed group vs 14.5 ± 25.3 months in the maintained group, 
P = 0.005). The 5-yr incidence of late infection (after 6 months) was higher in the PTDM 
group than in the control group (30.4% ± 7.1% vs 15.4% ± 3.3%, respectively, 
P = 0.031). However, the 5-yr overall survival rate was not different (92.9% ± 4.1% vs 
85.8% ± 3.2%, respectively, P = 0.220). In conclusion, PTDM after HT is reversible in onethird of patients and is not a critical factor in patient survival after HT.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE 
Cell Therapy & Organ Transplantation
INTRODUCTION
From the early days of transplantation, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has been recognized as a major complications of solid organ transplantation. Although its incidence 
has decreased with efforts to lower the dose of steroid used, 
PTDM continues to be prevalent in solid organ transplantation 
(1, 2). As with pre-existing diabetes, PTDM was thought to have 
a potential impact in post-transplantation outcomes. PTDM 
has been shown to be an independent risk factor of graft failure, 
cardiovascular disease, and death in kidney (3-5) and liver transplantation (6, 7). However, only a small number of studies have 
investigated the predisposing factors of PTDM in heart transplantation (HT) (8-11). Regarding its impact on the natural 
course and prognosis of HT, only two previous studies were 
published and showed no differences in the incidence of coronary vasculopathy and mortality after HT (10, 12). However, 
these studies were limited by small patient numbers and were 
brief analyses incidental to the main research. Understanding 
of natural course and impact of PTDM is important for its proper screening and treatment. Indeed, since tacrolimus (TAC) has 
been used widely and shown to be more diabetogenic than cyclosporine (CSA) in kidney transplantation (4, 13), the clinical 
importance of PTDM has emerged. In this study, we sought to 
describe in more detail the predisposition, natural course, and 
clinical impact of PTDM after HT. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
From May 1997 to May 2010, 222 patients underwent HT in our 
institute. The main study cohorts consisted of 54 patients with 
PTDM (PTDM group) and 140 patients without PTDM (control 
group). All patients were followed at the same institute after HT. 
Those patients were followed up monthly for 12 months, and 
every three months thereafter. Complicated patients were followed more frequently based on the attending physician’s discretion. Follow-up data were collected by direct contact, telephone interview, or detailed medical record review. The mean 
follow-up duration was 64.3 ± 43.4 months for the PTDM group 
and 75.3 ± 50.2 months for the control group. Follow-up data of 
28 patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) was also 
collected for separate analysis (DM group, mean follow-up period 55.1 ± 48.5 months).

Diagnosis of PTDM
PTDM was diagnosed using the American Diabetes Association criteria (14). In our institute, fasting blood glucose (FBG) 
levels were tested during every outpatient visit after HT for surveillance and follow-up of PTDM. Patients were diagnosed with 
PTDM when the FBG level was 126 mg/dL or greater and confirmed by repeated tests during outpatient follow-up visits. Oral 
glucose tolerance tests were conducted in patients suspicious 
for diabetes despite a FBG level below 126 mg/dL. Episodes of 
induced transient hyperglycemia due to high-dose steroid use 
or steroid pulse therapy for rejection, immediate post operative 
period, intravenous dextrose or nutritional therapy and significant infectious disease were excluded from PTDM diagnosis. 
PTDM patients were prescribed insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents with a target HbA1C < 7.0 and target fasting glucose 
< 130 mg/dL (15). The term “reversed PTDM” was assigned to 
patients who no longer needed insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents and who had adequate glucose and HbA1C control. 
The time to PTDM development was defined as the time from 
HT to diagnosis at the outpatient clinic.
Immunosuppressive protocol
Interleukin-2 monoclonal antibody (Basliximab or Daclizumab) induction therapy has been used since 2000. Maintenance 
of an immunosuppressive protocol consisted of a triple combination of a steroid, calcineurin inhibitor (CSA or TAC), and anti-proliferative agent (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil). 
The steroid was given intravenously at an initial dose of 1 mg/kg 
methylprednisolone, tapered to 10 mg/day by the time of discharge, and adjusted to a maintenance dose of 5 mg/day within 
6 months after HT. Withdrawal or continuance of the steroid (at 
the maintenance dose) was based on the attending physician’s 
discretion and the patient’s clinical status. The calcineurin inhibitor was routinely prescribed to all patients. CSA was the major calcineurin inhibitor used until 2007, and TAC was predominantly used after 2007. The calcineurin inhibitor dose on the 
second day of HT and the initial target trough concentration 
were 200-350 ng/mL for CSA and 10-15 ng/mL for TAC. The 
target trough concentration was adjusted between 100 and 200 
ng/mL for CSA and between 5 and 10 ng/mL for TAC 6 months 
after HT. Azathioprine (AZA) was the major anti-proliferative 
agent used until 1999, and mycophenolate mofetil replaced 
AZA after 1999.
Surveillance and definition of Cardiac Allograft 
Vasculopathy (CAV)
We evaluated CAV using the standardized protocol of our institute. All patients underwent baseline coronary angiography 
(CAG) with intravascular ultrasound 1 month after HT. Baseline 
CAG data were available in 91.3% (177 of 194) of patients. Surveillance CAG was performed first 1 yr after HT and thereafter 
every other year. CAG was also performed whenever the clinical situation suggested CAV. We categorized the degree of CAV 
according to ISHLT criteria (16). The study outcome “occurrence 
of CAV” was defined as any angiographic abnormality. Newly 
developed CAG and progression from baseline CAG were noted on surveillance CAG.
Surveillance and definition of rejection
All patients underwent serial endomyocardial biopsies at regular intervals. The ISHLT grading system was used to define the 
degree of rejection and to make a decision regarding use of immunosuppressive therapy (17). A transient increase in the corticosteroid dose with or without steroid pulse therapy was prescribed in the event of acute rejection grade 2R or 3R. The study 
outcome “episode of rejection” was defined as pathologically 
confirmed rejection of ISHLT grade 2R or greater needing steroid dose-up or steroid pulse therapy. 
Surveillance and definition of infection
Serologic surveillance for Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus,
Varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Bar virus was performed before HT. After HT, surveillance via blood culture, urine, and sputum analysis was performed weekly for 1 month. The Cytomegalovirus antigenemia assay was performed weekly during hospitalization and during every visit at the outpatient clinic until 
1 yr after HT. Gancyclovir prophylaxis was prescribed for all patients. Trimethoprime/sulfomethoxazole prophylaxis was prescribed for all patients for 1 yr after HT. The study outcome “episode of infectious disease” was defined as any infectious disease needing hospitalization and therapeutic intervention. We 
divided episodes of infectious disease into three periods: immediate (before 1 month), early (1-6 months), and late (after 6 
months) infection after HT.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (version 18.0; 
SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD values. Statistical analysis of the differences between the groups was completed using unpaired Student’s t test. The chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used 
to compare the frequency of categorical variables. Multivariable 
logistic regression with backward elimination was used to determine predisposing factors of PTDM. Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis was used to compare survival function and clinical event 
incidence. All P values were two-sided, and a value of P < 0.05 
was considered significant.
Ethics statement 
This retrospective study was approved by institutional review 
board of Asan Medical Center (IRB No. 2012-0056). Informed 
consent was exempted by the board.

RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Patients with 
PTDM were significantly older than control patients (48.9 ± 9.3 
vs 38.6 ± 13.3 yr, respectively, P = 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) as an indication for 
transplantation (20.4% [11/54] vs 7.1% [10/140], respectively, 
P = 0.008). Donor age in the PTDM group was greater than in 
the control group (32.4 ± 8.9 vs 29.4 ± 9.8 yr, respectively, P = 
0.048). Body mass index (BMI), renal function, and lipid profile 
before HT did not differ significantly between the groups. During HT, ischemic time of heart was significantly longer in the 
PTDM group than in the control group (163.3 ± 61.0 vs 140.4 ± 
55.6 min, respectively, P = 0.015). After transplantation, there 
was a trend of more TAC-based immunosuppressant use in the 
PTDM group than in the control group (38.9% [21/54] vs 25.7% 
[36/140], respectively, P = 0.080), although statistical significance 
was not reached. The steroid tapering schedule and rate of steroid discontinuation were not different between the groups.
Predictor of PTDM
To determine the predictors of PTDM, we performed multivariate analysis using a logistic regression model (Table 2). In univariate analysis, recipient age (odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-2.43, P = 0.001), donor age (OR, 1.39; 
CI, 1.01-1.89, P = 0.039), ICMP as an indication of HT (OR, 3.33; 
CI, 1.32-8.37, P = 0.011), and ischemic time during HT (OR, 1.07; 
CI, 1.01-1.12, P = 0.019) were significantly associated with PTDM 
occurrence. Recipient sex, donor age, and TAC-based immunosuppression were marginally associated with PTDM, but not 
with statistical significance. In multivariate analysis, only recipient age (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.35-2.40, P = 0.001) was significantly 
associated with PTDM occurrence. 
The occurrence and reversal of PTDM
Most PTDM cases (72.2% [39/54]) were diagnosed during the 
first outpatient visit after HT (Fig. 1). PTDM patients were already prescribed insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent before 
this visit. The mean time to PTDM development was 10.3 ± 21.5 
months. During follow-up, 61.1% (33/54) of PTDM patients were 
treated by oral hypoglycemic agent and 38.9% (21/54) required 
insulin. The mean FBG level at the first outpatient visit was 143.9 
± 36.1 mg/dL. After treatment, mean FBG level was decreased 
to 113.9 ± 22.8 mg/dL at one year after HT and 112.9 ± 28.6 mg/
dL at their last follow-up. The mean HbA1C level at initial outTable 1. Baseline characteristics of patients

patient visit was 8.1% ± 1.8% and decreased to 6.9% ± 0.9% at 
one year and 7.0% ± 0.9% at their last follow-up. 
PTDM was reversed in 18 (33%) patients during the followup period, and the mean time to PTDM reversal was 21.3 ± 22.5 
months. Patient characteristics of reversed and non-reversed 
PTDM are summarized in Table 3. Reversed PTDM occurred 
significantly earlier than non-reversed PTDM (1.9 ± 1.0 vs 14.5 ± 
25.3 months, respectively, P = 0.005), whereas other factors were 
not statistically significant. Fig. 1 shows the temporal pattern of 
PTDM occurrence. PTDM reversal was critically dependent on 
the time to PTDM development. PTDM was not reversed in patients in whom PTDM occurred more than 6 months after HT.
The clinical impact of PTDM
The 5-yr overall survival rate was not significantly different between PTDM and control patients (Fig. 2A; 92.9% ± 4.1% vs 
85.8% ± 3.2%, respectively, P = 0.220). Non-cardiac death was 
more prevalent than cardiac death in both groups, and the cause

ble 4). The 5-yr CAV incidence rate (Fig. 2B; 21.9% ± 8.7% vs 
19.0% ± 4.8%, respectively, P = 0.420) and rejection episodes 
(Fig. 2C; 13.0% ± 4.6% vs 19.6% ± 3.4%, respectively, P = 0.302) 
were not different between the PTDM and the control groups. 
During the immediate postoperative period, infection episodes 
were more prevalent in the PTDM group than in the control 
group (Fig. 2D; 11.1% [6/54] vs 2.9% [4/140], respectively, P = 
0.030). The 5-yr incidence of late infection (after 6 months) was 
higher in the PTDM group than in the control group (30.4% ± 
7.1% vs 15.4% ± 3.3%, respectively, P = 0.031). There were more 
episodes of bacterial (25.9% [14/54] vs 10.7% [15/140], respectively, P = 0.008) and fungal (13% [7/54] vs 1.4% [2/140], respectively, P = 0.002) infections in the PTDM group than in the control group. Episodes of viral and mycobacterial infections were 
not significantly different between the groups (Table 5). In terms 
of the infection site, pneumonia was more prevalent in the PTDM 
group than in the control group (27.8% [15/54] vs 10.7 [15/140], 
respectively, P = 0.003), whereas no differences were found in 
other sites (Table 6). 
To determine the clinical impact of reversal of PTDM, further 
analysis for study outcomes was performed between reversed 
(n = 18) and non-reversed (n = 36) PTDM group. During 5 yr, 
there were no significant difference in terms of overall survival 
rate (94.4% ± 5.4% vs 91.1% ± 6.4%, respectively, P = 0.896), incidence of CAV (16.9% ± 10.9% vs 29.2% ± 14.8%, respectively, 
P = 0.775), incidence of rejection (5.6% ± 5.4% vs 16.7% ± 6.2%, 
respectively, P = 0.255), and incidence of infectious episodes 
during the immediate (16.7% [3/18] vs 8.3% [3/36], respectively, 
P = 0.358) and early (16.7% [3/18] vs 19.4% [7/36], respectively, 
P = 0.804) post-operative period. The incidence of late infection 
(13.7% ± 9.2% vs 38.0% ± 9.1%, respectively, P = 0.069) was 
slightly higher in non-reversed group than reversed group, although statistical significance was not reached.
Comparison between patients with PTDM and pre-existing 
DM
Among the patients with pre-existing DM, mean time interval 
between diagnosis of DM and HT was 8.0 ± 6.6 yr. Compared to 
the subjects of the PTDM group, those patients in pre-existing 
DM group were older (48.9 ± 9.3 vs 56.0 ± 6.1 yr old, respectively, P = 0.001) and lesser male patients were included in DM 
group (81.5% [44/54] vs 64.3% [18/28], respectively, P = 0.058). 
Frequency of ICMP (20.4% [11/54] vs 14.3% [4/28]), TAC based

(1.3 ± 0.6 vs 1.1 ± 0.4 mg/dL) were not significantly different. 
During 5 yr, there was no significant difference between PTDM 
and DM group in terms of overall survival (92.9% ± 4.1% vs 
88.6% ± 6.2%, respectively, P = 0.141), incidence of CAV (21.9% 
± 8.7% vs 35.7% ± 21.0, respectively, P = 0.924), and incidence 
of rejection (12.9% ± 4.6% vs 17.9% ± 7.2%, respectively, P = 
0.308). Also, incidence of infectious episode during immediate 
(11.1% [6/54] vs 17.9% [5/28], P = 0.299), early (18.5% [10/54] vs 
10.7% [3/28], respectively, P = 0.359), and late (30.4% ± 7.1% vs 
29.1% ± 11.6%, respectively, P = 0.818) period were not significantly different.
DISCUSSION
In this study of the HT registry of one Korean hospital, we found 
several important findings about PTDM after HT. The most important predisposing factor for PTDM development was recipient age. Most PTDM occurred during the early post-operative 
period, especially during the first 6 months. During follow-up, 
PTDM was reversed in one-third of patients, and its reversal 
was critically dependent on the time to PTDM development. 
PTDM had no significant impact on overall survival, incidence 
of CAV, and acute rejection. However, PTDM patients experienced more immediate post-operative and late infectious episodes.
The incidence of PTDM in our study was 27.8% during 6-yr 
follow-up, which was not very different than data of the largest 
ISHLT registry (-20% at 10 yr) (18). In previous studies focused 
on PTDM development, the incidence was 13.5%-39.7%, and 
the important predisposing factors for PTDM were age, BMI, 
post-operative steroid dose, glucose intolerance before HT, TAC 
treatment, and episodes of rejection (8-11). In our study, recipient age was the only significant predisposing factor for PTDM. 
It was not a surprising finding considering that age is one of the 
most important risk factors of DM (15). However, other risk factors of DM, especially the components of metabolic syndrome 
(BMI, triglyceride, and cholesterol) were not different between 
PTDM and control patients. The exact cause of this insignificance of metabolic components could not be understood using 
this registry data, but it could be partially explained by the difference in ethnicity. Although the exact mechanism has not 
been proven, the impairment of insulin secretion rather than 
insulin resistance is known to be the initial abnormality in the 
development of DM in Korean patients (19). Also, most Korean 
type 2 DM patients are not obese, and BMI and waist-to-hip ratio were not significant risk factors in Korean population-based 
studies (20, 21). Although this hypothesis is limited due to the 
lack of direct comparison data between Koreans and Caucasians, it has clinical implications for the management of oriental patients undergoing HT. 
TAC use was not an independent predictor in our study. However, we cannot state that TAC had no effect on PTDM, because 
the follow-up period of the TAC-based regimen was too short 
to compare to CSA. Also, the dose and tapering schedule of the 
prescribed steroid were not different between the groups, because the same steroid tapering protocol was applied to all patients. One interesting finding is that the ischemic time was marginally associated with PTDM, although statistical significance 
was not reached. The prolonged ischemic time of a cardiac allograft is known to be related to poor early graft performance, 
longer ICU stay, and other organ dysfunction (22, 23). Although 
it was not statistically significant, the relationship between pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and ischemic time could be a clinically possible scenario and efforts to reduce ischemic time may 
be of benefit to patients. 
One of the interesting findings of our study is that PTDM was 
reversed in one-third of patients. The reversal of PTDM was reported in previous liver or kidney transplantation studies (24-26), 
but there were limited data about the characteristics of reversed 
PTDM. In patients with reversed (versus non-reversed) PTDM, 
a trend for higher high density lipoprotein cholesterol level, lower ICMP, and lower TAC use was observed. However, the most 
distinguishing and only statistically significant characteristic 
was the time to PTDM development. Only early onset PTDM 
was reversed. This time course dependency may suggest a difference of pathogenesis between PTDM occurring before versus after 6 months. We thought the most important difference 
between PTDM occurring before versus after 6 months may 
be the dose of steroid used, which was tapered to or lower than 
the maintenance dose (5 mg of prednisolone) after 6 months. 
Therefore, we hypothesized that early PTDM occurring before 
6 months was triggered by high dose steroid use and had some 
potential for reversal. Conversely, PTDM occurring after 6 months may be a de novo type 2 DM, because the diabetogenicity of 
a lower than maintenance dose was minimal in a previous study 
(27). This finding may indicate that a different approach is needed for managing early PTDM versus late PTDM. The possibility 
of reversal of early DM warrants continuous monitoring of glucose status and caution again overzealous hypoglycemic treatment.
PTDM presence had no influence on the probability of patient survival, as was similarly shown by Klingenberg et al. (12). 
The lack of a difference in the survival rate could be supported 
by the large study of Russo et al. (28), which enrolled more than 
20,000 patients among whom were more than 3000 DM patients. 
In that study, patients with uncomplicated DM had a similar 
survival rate compared with patients without DM, whereas patients with complicated DM showed increased mortality as 
DM-related complications increased. Because PTDM is a newly 
diagnosed DM and usually treated intensively, patients with 
PTDM could have a similar natural course as those with wellcontrolled uncomplicated DM. Also, PTDM had no influence

on vasculopathy or rejection in our patients. However, PTDM 
increased the patient infection rate. The association of pre-transplant DM and infection has already been well studied by Marelli 
et al., who showed higher 90-day and 4-yr infection rates in DM 
patients (29). The impaired immune response in the diabetic 
state (30) and the baseline characteristics (more elders and 
ICMP) of PTDM patients may affect the increasing infection 
rate. This increased infection risk did not translate to differences in survival. Nevertheless, because PTDM patients showed 
more susceptibility to pneumonia in our study, more intensive 
surveying for infectious disease presence may be needed. 
Although we tried to include a large number of HT patients, 
it is difficult to generalize our findings because the study was a 
single center study of Asian patients. The numbers of PTDM and 
reversed PTDM patients were too small to determine the statistically significant predictors of reversal. Also, relatively small 
study population and short follow-up period could bring some 
selection bias and beta–errors. But, our study population is the 
largest HT registry in the Korea. Furthermore, follow-up duration of our study was longer than previous studies (10, 12) and 
outcome data were reliable because all the study participants 
were followed regularly in a single center without loss. Despite 
limitations described above, we believe that our data could represent the real-world clinical impact of PTDM in Korean HT patients. TAC was available to patients with HT only after 2007 in 
Korea. As a result, the follow-up period of TAC patients was significantly shorter than CSA patients, and it is difficult to assess 
its impact on PTDM occurrence and reversal. Although we enrolled patients undergoing HT before 2010, the incidence of 
PTDM could be underestimated because there were some patients who developed PTDM several years after HT. Also, the 
number of reversed PTDM patients could be increased if the 
follow-up period was extended.
In conclusion, PTDM is reversible in one-third of patients 
and not a critical factor of patient survival after HT. However, 
more intensive surveying for infectious diseases and optimal 
glucose control is warranted in these patients.
