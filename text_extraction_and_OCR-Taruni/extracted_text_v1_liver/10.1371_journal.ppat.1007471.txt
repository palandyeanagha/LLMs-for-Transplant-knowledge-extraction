Abstract
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-strand RNA virus encoding 3 open reading frames
(ORF). HEV ORF3 protein is a small, hitherto poorly characterized protein involved in viral
particle secretion and possibly other functions. Here, we show that HEV ORF3 protein
forms membrane-associated oligomers. Immunoblot analyses of ORF3 protein expressed
in cell-free vs. cellular systems suggested a posttranslational modification. Further analyses
revealed that HEV ORF3 protein is palmitoylated at cysteine residues in its N-terminal
region, as corroborated by 3
H-palmitate labeling, the investigation of cysteine-to-alanine
substitution mutants and treatment with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-
BP). Abrogation of palmitoylation by site-directed mutagenesis or 2-BP treatment altered
the subcellular localization of ORF3 protein, reduced the stability of the protein and strongly
impaired the secretion of infectious particles. Moreover, selective membrane permeabilization coupled with immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that HEV ORF3 protein is
entirely exposed to the cytosolic side of the membrane, allowing to propose a model for its
membrane topology and interactions required in the viral life cycle. In conclusion, palmitoylation determines the subcellular localization, membrane topology and function of HEV ORF3
protein in the HEV life cycle.

Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is believed to be the most common cause of acute hepatitis
and jaundice in the world [1, 2]. It is a positive-strand RNA virus classified in the Hepeviridae
family [3, 4]. Most human pathogenic strains can be assigned to genotypes 1–4 within the species Orthohepevirus A [5]. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are transmitted by the fecal-oral route and
can cause large, primarily waterborne outbreaks in low-income countries with poor sanitation,
infecting about 20 million people and claiming 70,000 lives every year [6]. On the other hand,
infection with HEV genotypes 3 and 4 has been recognized as a porcine zoonosis in highincome countries, with much higher than anticipated seroprevalence rates, reaching 86.4% in
the South of France [7]. HEV genotype 3 (and, to a lesser extent, genotypes 4 as well as 7) can
persist in immunocompromised patients and cause chronic hepatitis with potential rapid progression to cirrhosis [8, 9]. In addition, HEV genotype 3 is a cause of diverse neurological
manifestations, especially neuralgic amyotrophy (also known as Parsonage-Turner syndrome)
[10, 11]. Hence, HEV represents a growing global health concern [12–14].
HEV is a nonenveloped virus of 27–34 nm in diameter. The 7.2-kb RNA genome encodes
three open reading frames (ORF) which are translated into (i) the ORF1 polyprotein, representing the viral replicase, (ii) the ORF2 protein, corresponding to the viral capsid, and (iii) the
ORF3 protein, a small, hitherto poorly characterized protein [3]. Although HEV is found as a
nonenveloped virus in bile and feces, it circulates in the bloodstream, similar to hepatitis A
virus, as a ’quasi-enveloped’ particle wrapped in cellular membranes likely derived from exosomes [15–17].
HEV ORF3 protein plays an essential role in virion secretion [18, 19] but not in RNA replication or virion assembly [20]. More specifically, ORF3 protein supports HEV egress using the
exosomal pathway [16, 21] and has been shown to be associated with the quasi-enveloped viral
particle [22]. Interestingly, a recent study reported that HEV ORF3 protein possesses ion channel activity required for the release of infectious virus [23].
ORF3 encodes, depending on the genotype, a 112-, 113- or 114-amino-acid (aa) protein
with a predicted molecular weight (MW) of 12–13 kDa. It has been reported to be phosphorylated at Ser 71 in genotype 1 (corresponding to Ser 70 in genotype 3) by the cellular mitogenactivated protein kinase [24]. A yeast two-hybrid study suggested oligomerization of ORF3
protein through a proline-rich C-terminal region [25], and homotypic interaction of ORF3
protein was recently confirmed in mammalian cells [23]. Moreover, phosphorylated ORF3
protein was reported to interact with the ORF2 (capsid) protein [26].
Early reports indicated that ORF3 protein associates, via an N-terminal hydrophobic
domain, with the cytoskeleton and, more specifically, with microtubules [24, 27]. In addition,
the protein has also been observed at early and recycling endosomes [28] as well as multivesicular bodies (MVBs) [16]. Notably, a conserved PSAP motif may be necessary for its interaction with tumor susceptibility gene 101 (Tsg101), a component of the endosomal sorting
complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway [19, 21, 29].
In the present study, we describe the oligomerization as well as the association of HEV
ORF3 protein with intracellular and plasma membranes. We identified a determinant for

oligomerization at the N-terminal end of ORF3 protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate palmitoylation of ORF3 protein on cysteine residues in its N-terminal segment. Alanine substitution
of the cysteine residues or inhibition of palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) lowered
the MW of the viral protein and altered ORF3 protein subcellular localization. Importantly,
serine substitution of 5 cysteine residues in a full-length HEV clone strongly impaired the
secretion of infectious particles. Finally, selective membrane permeabilization coupled with
immunofluorescence analyses allowed to determine the membrane topology of HEV ORF3
protein.
Results
HEV ORF3 protein oligomerizes through N-terminal determinants
The N-terminal region of ORF3 protein has previously been reported to harbor two hydrophobic segments of which the second has been predicted as a transmembrane segment [23].
Sequence analysis of HEV ORF3 from all 8 genotypes revealed that the protein sequence is
highly conserved especially in the N-terminal part (aa 1–28) (Fig 1A). Of note, the predicted
transmembrane segment, boxed in grey in Fig 1A (segment aa 30–53 for gt 3), shows more variability in primary sequence, especially in gt 4 as compared to the other genotypes, and,
intriguingly, is not predicted to form an α-helix.
HEV ORF3 protein has been reported to oligomerize in a yeast two-hybrid study as well as
in mammalian cells [23, 25]. However, the determinants for oligomerization need to be further
delineated. As shown in Fig 1B, we confirmed oligomerization of ORF3 protein by coimmunoprecipitation of HA- and FLAG-tagged ORF3 constructs in transiently transfected U-2 OS
cells. On this basis, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay to further explore oligomerization of ORF3. A CFP-YFP fusion protein and cotransfection of CFP
and YFP served as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in Fig 1C, coexpression of CFP- and YFP-tagged full-length ORF3 protein (ORF31-113) constructs yielded a significant FRET signal as compared to the negative and positive controls. Moreover, analyses of Cand N-terminal deletion constructs revealed that the N-terminal 28 aa are essential for the oligomerization of HEV ORF3 protein.
HEV ORF3 protein associates with membranes
ORF3 expressed as a GFP fusion protein or as an untagged protein either individually or in
cells replicating full-length infectious HEV is consistently observed at intracellular membrane
compartments, likely corresponding to the previously described localization in endosomes
and in MVBs [16, 28], but also at the plasma membrane (Fig 2A). Membrane extraction with 1
M NaCl, sodium carbonate pH 11.5, or 1% Triton X-100, followed by flotation assay confirmed that ORF3 protein is tightly associated with cellular membranes (Fig 2B), as indicated
by a similar behaviour of ORF3 protein than as compared to the integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein CLIMP63.
The N-terminal region of HEV ORF3 protein determines its membrane
association and subcellular localization
To determine the domain responsible for membrane association of HEV ORF3 protein, we
analyzed GFP-fused deletion constructs by membrane flotation assay. The endoplasmic reticulum-resident integral membrane protein CLIMP63 and GFP alone were used as reference for
membrane-associated and soluble proteins, respectively (Fig 3A). First, we confirmed that
ORF31-113-GFP is associated with membranes, similarly to ORF3 protein alone (cf. Fig 2B). As

Fig 1. HEV ORF3 protein oligomerizes in mammalian cells. (A) Sequence analysis of ORF3 protein. Amino acid sequences of ORF3 from
HEV genotypes 1–8 (GenBank accession numbers AB740232, AF444002, M74506, AJ272108, AB573435, AB856243, KJ496144 and
KX387866) were aligned using ClustalW [52]. Segment aa 30–53 predicted as transmembrane passage by TMPred is boxed in grey [53]. A
consensus secondary structure was predicted using algorithms MLRC, DSC and PHD (available at https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr) and is shown
below the alignment (c, random coil; h, α-helix; e, extended strand; ?, discrepant prediction). The degree of aa physicochemical conservation
at each position is shown on the bottom line and can be inferred with the similarity index according to ClustalW convention (asterisk,
invariant; colon, highly similar; dot, similar) [52]. (B) ORF3 protein oligomerization was analyzed by FLAG immunoprecipitation. Lysates
(Input) of U-2 OS cells transfected with pCMVORF3-HA and/or pCMVORF3-FLAG as well as immunoprecipitates (IP: FLAG) were
subjected to immunoblot with either specific anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. The presence of a strong signal for ORF3-HA after pull-down
of ORF3-FLAG indicates oligomerization of ORF3 protein in cells. (C) FRET analyses reveal oligomerization of HEV ORF3. CFP (cyan
fluorescent protein) or YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) fused to the C-termini of HEV ORF3 segments aa 1–113, 1–94, 1–70, 1–53, 28–113 or
53–113 were co-expressed in U-2 OS cells. FRET analyses were performed by the acceptor photobleaching method as described in the
Materials and Methods section. The CFP-YFP fusion protein and cotransfection of unfused CFP and YFP served as positive and negative
controls, respectively. Box-and-whisker plots represent the median FRET efficiency (FRETeff) values of 20 measurements (middle line), the
values from the lower to the upper quartile (central box), and the minimum and maximum values (vertical line). The significance of the
observed differences was assessed as described in Materials and Methods (
�, P<0.0001).

transfected with pCMVORF3-GFP, pCMVORF3, or with full-length p6 HEV RNA (HEVcc). Cells were fixed 48 h or 6 d (HEVcc) posttransfection and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy either by direct visualization of GFP or after immunofluorescence staining of HEV ORF3
protein using anti-ORF3 rabbit pAb (α-ORF3). Scale bars indicate 10 μm. (B) Membrane flotation confirms the membrane association of HEV
ORF3 protein. S10-3 cells transiently transfected with pCMVORF3 were lysed in a hypotonic buffer and the membrane fraction was obtained by
ultracentrifugation as described in the Materials and Methods section. Membrane pellets were resuspended in physiological NTE buffer, 1 M
NaCl, 100 mM sodium carbonate (pH 11.5), or 1% Triton X-100 (Tx) and incubated for 20 min at 4˚C. Subsequently, membrane flotation
analyses were performed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Eight fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by
immunoblot using pAb against HEV ORF3. Detection of Hsp70 served as a control for a peripherally membrane-associated protein and
CLIMP63 as a control for an integral membrane protein.

shown in Fig 3A, the N-terminal 28 aa (ORF31-28-GFP) were sufficient to mediate membrane
association of ORF3 protein. Deletion of the N-terminal 27 aa (ORF328-113-GFP) or 52 aa
(ORF353-113-GFP) completely abolished membrane association. Hence, the N-terminal 28 aa
are required for proper membrane association of HEV ORF3 protein.
At the subcellular level, fluorescence microscopy showed that ORF31-28-GFP had a very
similar localization than ORF31-113-GFP (Fig 3B) while ORF328-113-GFP and ORF353-113-GFP
were displayed predominantly a diffuse pattern. These results show that in addition to the oligomerization of ORF3 protein, the N-terminal region and more particularly aa 1–28 determine
the membrane association and subcellular localization of ORF3 protein.
HEV ORF3 protein is posttranslationally modified on cysteine residues of
its N-terminal segment
The 113-aa ORF3 protein of HEV genotype 3 has a theoretical molecular weight (MW) of 11.3
kDa. However, separation of lysates from pCMVORF3-transfected mammalian cells by 17%
SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis revealed an apparent MW of about 15 kDa (Fig
4A). Interestingly, ORF3 protein produced in wheat germ-based cell-free expression system
migrated at the expected theoritical MW of about 11–12 kDa (Fig 4A). This observation suggests that ORF3 may undergo posttranslational modification when expressed in cells. As it has
been postulated that ORF3 may be phosphorylated, we prepared an alanine substitution
mutant (S70A) to determine whether phosphorylation reported at this particular serine residue
was involved in the observed MW change. However, as the pattern obtained for this mutant
was similar to that of wild-type (wt) ORF3 protein, phosphorylation on Ser 70 does not explain
the higher apparent MW observed in our experimental settings (Fig 4A).
Bands other than the one at 15 kDa were observed at lower MWs, including one with a similar migration as compared to cell-free expressed ORF3 protein, i.e. likely the non-modified
form. Hence, we validated our observations in lysates from cells replicating infectious HEV
from two different molecular clones, i.e 83–2 and p6. As shown in Fig 4B, a single band for
ORF3 protein similar to the higher MW signal obtained with the single ORF3 expression was
observed under these conditions. Altogether these data show that HEV ORF3 protein has a
higher apparent MW than the theoretical, which is likely the consequence of a posttranslational modification.
Because an ORF3 protein construct deleted from the first 18 aa displayed a MW which is
close to the expected theoretical MW (S1B Fig), we focused our attention on the N-terminal
region of ORF3. Interestingly, the first N-terminal 21 aa of the ORF3 protein comprise 8 cysteine residues at conserved positions in all HEV genotypes with the exception of HEV genotypes
4 and 6 which have only 7 cysteines (Fig 1A). Hence, we next substituted the cysteine residues
by alanines and analyzed the resulting constructs by immunoblot. Single alanine substitutions
resulted in a slight MW shift for all cysteine residues (S1E Fig). Mutants with grouped alanine
substitutions, i.e. C1-4, C5-8 and C1-8, showed a more pronounced effect on the MW of ORF3
protein (Fig 4C). Indeed, mutants C1-4 and C5-8 showed a lower apparent MW and also a
reduced protein amount for the latter. Strikingly, alanine substitution of all 8 cysteine residues
(mutant C1-8) destabilized the protein which could no longer be detected by immunoblot (Fig
4C). Stability of these mutant proteins could be increased by fusion with GFP, as shown in S1F
Fig. As shown in Fig 5D, the subcellular localization of ORF3 protein changed upon alanine
pCMVORF3-GFP, pCMVORF31-53-GFP, pCMVORF31-28-GFP or pCMVORF31-53-GFP as indicated. Nucleus was
stained with DAPI. Scale bars indicate 10 μm. Slides were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

substitution of the cysteines, i.e. mutants C1-4, C5-8 or C1-8 (Fig 4D), and showed a pattern similar to that of ORF328-113-GFP when all cysteines are mutated (Fig 3B). Furthermore, this
observation is correlated with a loss of membrane association of the mutants as assessed by
membrane flotation (Fig 4E).
Together, these findings indicate that the cysteine residues of ORF3 protein are likely
engaged in a posttranslational modification which plays an important role for the subcellular
localization, membrane association and stability of the protein.
HEV ORF3 protein is palmitoylated
Among common posttranslational modifications involving cysteine residues, palmitoylation
results in the covalent link of a palmitate, i.e. a C16 acyl chain. A consequence of the addition
of palmitate to cysteine residues is the association with cellular membranes. This modification
is mediated by host palmitoyltransferases. To assess whether ORF3 protein is palmitoylated,
cells replicating the infectious HEV clones p6 and 83–2 as well as cells transfected with wt, C1-4
and C5-8 ORF3 expression constructs were incubated for 3 h with 3H-palmitate before harvesting and immunoprecipitation with anti-ORF3 pAb. Immunoblot analysis revealed that comparable amounts of ORF3 protein were specifically immunoprecipitated in the different
conditions (Fig 5, top panel). Furthermore, the MW observed for the C1-4 and C5-8 mutants
was lower as compared to the wt ORF3 protein, as expected and previously observed (Fig 4C). 3
H-palmitate incorporation was then assessed by separation of protein lysates under the same
microscopy 48 h post-transfection. A representative image is shown for each construct. Scale bars indicate 10 μm. (E) Membrane flotation

analysis using mAb JL8 against GFP. Endogenous CLIMP63 was used as positive control for an integral membrane protein.

respectively, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-ORF3 pAb (+) or non-relevant rabbit serum (-). Afterimmunoprecipitation,
the elution samples were separated by 17% SDS-PAGE and subjected to either immunoblot with anti-ORF3 pAb followed by chemiluminescence
revelation or autoradiography (40 d of exposure).

conditions, followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig 5, ORF3 protein incorporated palmitate, as revealed by a strong signal for cells transfected with pCMVORF3 from both gt1 and
gt3. Importantly, palmitate incorporation into ORF3 protein is also observed in lysates from
cells harboring the infectious HEV clones, albeit at a much lower intensity, reflecting a low
activity of translation of ORF3 during the limited 3-h period of 3H-palmitate incubation (Fig
5, lower panel). Of note, a radioactive signal is also recorded for the for C1-4 and C5-8 mutants,
indicating that, although harboring 4 alanine substitutions each, they still incorporate palmitate, likely at the 4 remaining cysteine residues. Altogether, these observations demonstrate
that ORF3 protein is palmitoylated when expressed as a single protein as well as, more importantly, in the context of the replication of full-length infectious HEV.
Palmitoylation of ORF3 protein determines its subcellular localization
We next treated ORF3-expressing cells with increasing concentrations of the palmitoylation
inhibitor 2-BP and analyzed the protein lysates for ORF3 protein by immunoblot (S3 Fig).
Protein analysis of cells transfected with the pCMVORF3 construct and cultured with increasing concentrations of 2-BP (0.5, 5, 25 and 50 μM) revealed a dose-dependent accumulation of
the lower MW signal corresponding to the non-modified ORF3 protein while the higher MW
signal was decreasing in parallel (S3 Fig). To determine the role of ORF3 palmitoylation in its
subcellular localization, S10-3 cells transfected with GFP fusion constructs were treated with
25 μM 2-BP or DMSO as control for 24 h. As shown in Fig 6, treatment with the palmitoylation inhibitor induced a relocalization of ORF3-GFP within the cytoplasm as a diffuse signal
(Fig 6). Furthermore, cells expressing the minimal membrane-associated construct ORF31-28-
GFP showed a similar diffuse pattern of the GFP signal within the cytoplasm (Fig 6).
Palmitoylation of ORF3 protein is essential for secretion of infectious HEV
To investigate the role of palmitoylation in the function of HEV ORF3 protein, 5 cysteine residues were replaced by serine in the full-length HEV p6 infectious clone, yielding mutant
p6_C5S (Fig 7A). Because ORF2 and ORF3 are overlapping, the cysteine-rich coding region
tolerates minimal sequence changes. Therefore, aa at positions 11, 13, 16, 18 and 21 were
substituted by a serine residue. Similarly to what was observed for the C1-8 mutant, where the 8
cysteine residues have been substituted in a heterologous expression setting, the ORF3_C5S
protein was not detectable by immunoblot (Fig 7B) and the corresponding GFP fusion construct showed a diffuse subcellular distribution (Fig 7C). Transfection of S10-3 cells with either
p6 or p6_C5S RNA resulted in the immunofluorescence detection of similar amounts of ORF2
protein while ORF3 protein was detectable only for the wt (Fig 7D). This was also confirmed
by immunoblot analysis (S5B Fig). Functional consequences were assessed by the determination of the infectivity in the intracellular and extracellular compartments 5 d post-transfection
for the p6 wt and p6_C5S constructs. While a similar infectivity was observed intracellularly
for both constructs, infectious virus secretion was strongly impaired in the p6_C5S mutant
(Fig 7E). These results indicate that the cysteine residues of HEV ORF3 protein engaged in palmitoylation are essential for the secretion of infectious particles.
HEV ORF3 protein is cytosolically oriented
Palmitoylation occurs on the cytosolic side of the membrane at different subcellular sites
depending on the palmitoyltransferase(s) involved. Since the cysteine residues of HEV ORF3

at the C-terminal end with an HA epitope. The tags were detected by immunofluorescence by
double staining in the absence of cell permeabilization vs. after treatment with 0.5% saponin.
As shown in Fig 8A, both epitopes were detectable only after permeabilization of the plasma
membrane with saponin. Hence, as suggested by the presence of the palmitoylated cysteines,
the N-terminal region of ORF3 protein is exposed to the cytosolic side. Furthermore, these
results also suggest that the C-terminal end of the protein is present on the cytosolic side and
not exposed to the extracellular space, as it would be the case if HEV ORF3 possessed a transmembrane passage.
Given that the addition of epitope tags may perturb the membrane association of a small
protein like HEV ORF3, a similar experiment was performed with the expression of an
untagged ORF3 construct (Fig 8B). The detection of the cell surface-expressed tetraspanin
CD151 and of cytosolic mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) have been employed
as controls in both conditions, i.e non permeabilized and saponin 0.5% treated cells. Indeed, the
cytosolic protein, i.e. MAVS, could be detected only in permeabilized conditions while the surface exposed protein, i.e. CD151, is always accessible to antibody. Thus, we used monoclonal
antibody (mAb) MRB198 recognizing an epitope of ORF3 protein in the C-terminal region aa
62–113 to investigate the topology of the viral protein. The ORF3 protein was well detectable at
intracellular membranes and, to some extend, at the plasma membrane, by the anti-ORF3 mAb
following permeabilization. However, HEV ORF3 protein was not detectable in the absence of
permeabilization (Fig 8B). These results further demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal regions
of ORF3 protein are both present on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane.

To corroborate our findings, we also employed selective permeabilization combined with
immunofluorescence detection of HEV ORF3 using the specific mAb described above. As
described earlier [30], transfection of plasmids allowing the expression of the membrane-associated hepatitis C virus (HCV) proteins core and E1 followed by immunofluorescence detection was used to assess the quality of the selective permeabilization. Indeed, differential

digitonin-based permeabilization of cells allows to discriminate between epitopes exposed to
the cytosolic vs. luminal side of intracellular membranes. Accordingly, we observed the detection of the cytosolically-oriented HCV core protein under total and selective permeabilization
conditions, i.e. digitonin 0.2% and 0.01%, respectively (Fig 8C). However, the luminal HCV E1
glycoprotein was detectable only following total permeabilization. Detection of HEV ORF3
protein was carried out with recombinant mAb MRB198 under both permeabilization conditions with a similar pattern of subcellular localization, i.e. at the plasma and intracellular membranes (Fig 8C). The lack of difference between the detection of ORF3 protein under the two
permeabilization conditions indicates that the epitope recognized by the mAb is oriented
toward the cytosol. Importantly, given that these data were obtained under ORF3 single expression settings, we confirmed our findings using the same approach in S10-3 cells replicating
the full-length HEV infectious clone p6 for which fluorescence intensity was measured and
plotted for the different conditions (Fig 8C).
Altogether, our results indicate that HEV ORF3 protein is exposed to the cytosolic side of
the plasma membrane as well as of the intracellular membranes. Thus, our data indicate that
HEV ORF3 protein is membrane-associated via palmitoylation of the N-terminal segment and
does not traverse the membrane.
Discussion
In the present study, we identified the N-terminal region of HEV ORF3 protein as the determinant for membrane association and oligomerization. More precisely, we found that ORF3 protein is palmitoylated at the N-terminal cysteine-rich segment. Palmitoylation of HEV ORF3
protein determines its membrane association, subcellular localization and likely stabilizes the
viral protein. Moreover, the mutation of cysteine residues of ORF3 protein engaged in palmitoylation strongly impairs the secretion of infectious HEV. Additionally, investigation of the
membrane topology of HEV ORF3 protein by selective permeabilization coupled with immunofluorescence detection supports a model where the entire ORF3 protein is oriented toward
the cytosolic side of the membrane.
We have found that ORF3 protein is membrane-associated and localized to intracellular
membranes as well as the plasma membrane. While the latter localization is not predominant
in HEV-replicating S10-3 cells, ORF3 protein accumulates more importantly at this compartment when expressed alone in U-2 OS or Hep293TT (S1D Fig). Inhibition by 2-BP revealed
that subcellular localization of ORF3 protein is determined by palmitoylation. Similarly, it has
been shown that the NB glycoprotein of influenza B virus is palmitoylated and that this posttranslational modification determines the subcellular localization of the viral protein to the
plasma membrane [31]. Emerson and colleagues reported an accumulation of ORF3 protein at
the apical membrane of C25j cells, a subclone of the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 which
was associated with a preferential release of infectious virus at this apical membrane [19]. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that ORF3 protein is present at bile canaliculi of humanized
liver chimeric mice infected with HEV [32, 33]. Therefore, these observations are in agreement
with a plasma membrane and bile canalicular localization of the ORF3 protein.
Oligomerization of HEV ORF3 protein had been previously investigated in yeast 2-hybrid
system and revealed that determinants for self-interaction reside in aa segment 71–113 [25]. A
recent report showed oligomerization of ORF3 protein in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation [23]. In our study, we confirm oligomerization of ORF3 protein by co-immunoprecipitation as well as FRET and we map the interacting domain to the region spanning aa 1 to 53.
However, our results cannot exclude a possible interaction domain in segment aa 71–113 as
suggested by Tyagi and colleagues [25]. The N-terminal segment comprises the palmitoylated
Palmitoylation of HEV ORF3 protein

cysteine-rich domain as well as the following hydrophobic domain aa 28–53. Palmitoylation is
known to regulate protein-protein interactions [34]. Therefore, it is likely that the C16 acyl
chains linked to the cysteine residues are important contributors of ORF3 oligomerization, possibly together with the C-terminal region of the protein. Indeed, similarly to observations made
with the oligomeric HCV nonstructural protein 4B [35], protein oligomerization may depend
on several interacting domains.
While ORF3 is often referred to as a 13-kDa protein, reports in the literature showed ORF3
protein with higher apparent MW at about 15 kDa in infected cells [21, 22, 36] as well as in
vivo in liver chimeric mice infected with HEV [32]. Discrimination of the MW of HEV ORF3
protein required optimal separation by high percentage SDS-PAGE. Of note, we have included
the ORF3S70A mutant in our analyses to examine the potential contribution of the phosphorylation described previously [24]. However, our data shows that alanine substitution at aa position 70 does not change the migration pattern of ORF3 protein in SDS-PAGE. Thus, our
analyses did not allow to state whether HEV ORF3 protein is phosphorylated in addition to its
palmitoylation.
While the HEV ORF3 sequence of Orthohepeviruses A, including HEV gt 1 and gt 3, is not
well conserved as compared to the one of Orthohepeviruses B or C, i.e. avian or rat HEV, the
presence of cysteine residues in the N-terminal region is conserved. Interestingly, avian HEV
ORF3 protein, which possesses 10 cysteine residues among its N-terminal 30 aa (S4A Fig), displays a similar subcellular localization as compared to HEV genotype 3 ORF3 protein (S4B
Fig). Moreover, avian HEV ORF3 protein, which displays an apparent molecular weight above
the theoretical one (15 kDa vs. 11–12 kDa), can incorporate 3
H-palmitate (S4C Fig) when
expressed in human cells. These observations strongly suggest that palmitoylation of the HEV
ORF3 protein is a conserved feature among the Orthohepeviruses.
A recent report by Ding et al. suggested that ORF3 protein possesses an ion channel activity
required for virus secretion [23]. Such function implies that ORF3 protein has a transmembrane segment to form a pore upon oligomerization. As shown here, the protein sequence of
HEV ORF3 is highly conserved in the N-terminal region and more specifically in region aa
1–28. A transmembrane segment is predicted by some algorithms (i.e. PHDHTM, TMpred,
TMHMM) in region aa 31–52, however with less consistency for HEV ORF3 protein of genotype 4. In addition, secondary structure prediction for an alpha-helix is poor (Fig 1A). Furthermore, we experimentally observed that ORF3 expression constructs where the predicted
transmembrane segment (aa 28–53) alone or the C-terminal part (aa 28–113) is fused to GFP
were found to be mainly soluble in transfected cells (Fig 3). As it is difficult to prove the existence of an internal transmembrane segment when expressed out of its natural protein context,
we employed an antibody accessibility assay using selective membrane permeabilization and
immunofluorescence with a mAb against the C-terminal part (epitope aa 62–113) of ORF3
protein. Our data demonstrate that the epitope present in the C-terminal part of HEV ORF3
protein is detectable upon selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane, indicating its
presence on the cytosolic side of cellular membranes. Given the palmitoylation of ORF3 protein at N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (aa 5–21), our data reveal that ORF3 protein is
entirely oriented to the cytosolic side while associated with the membrane at least through palmitoylation. Supporting our findings, the well described PSAP motif of HEV ORF3 protein
(aa 95–99 for genotype 3) required for the interaction with Tsg101 [19, 21, 37] needs to be oriented toward the cytosol to allow association with the ESCRT-I protein. Furthermore, ORF3
protein is not only present in infected cells but is also believed to be part of the quasi-enveloped virus secreted into the bloodstream or in cell culture [15, 19, 22]. These reports demonstrated that ORF3 protein, more precisely epitope aa 90–113, is detectable only when quasienveloped virus is treated with a detergent to permeabilize the membrane. Hence, consistent
Palmitoylation of HEV ORF3 protein

with our findings, these reports indicate that ORF3 protein is present inside the exosomes constituting the quasi-enveloped HEV particle [16]. Thus, the membrane topology suggested by
Ding and colleagues, where ORF3 protein would possess a transmembrane segment comprising aa 30–52, is not fully supported by our observations as well as by others. However, viral
proteins are often multifunctional and may adopt different membrane topologies to exert different functions, as it is the case for the hepatitis B virus large surface protein [38], the fusion
protein of Newcastle disease virus [39] or HCV nonstructural protein 4B [30]. Therefore, it is
conceivable that a subset of ORF3 protein at a particular localization or at a defined stage of
the infection forms pores to exert ion channel activity.
Previous reports showed that HEV ORF3 protein is crucial for infectious virus secretion
[20] and is incorporated into the quasi-enveloped virion [15, 22]. Given the membrane association as well as the palmitoylation of ORF3 protein described here, one may hypothesize that
the posttranslational modification of ORF3 protein regulates its function in virus secretion.
Indeed, we demonstrated that the cysteine residues of HEV ORF3 protein, engaged in palmitoylation, are essential for the secretion of infectious particles. Interestingly, a recent report
demonstrated that palmitoylation of the small transframe protein of Sindbis virus, another
positive-strand RNA virus, determines its localization to the plasma membrane and regulates
its incorporation into the particle and thereby virus secretion [40]. Hence, future investigations
shall aim at identifying the host palmitoyltransferase(s) responsible for ORF3 protein modification to further explore the functional consequences of this posttranslational modification on
the virus life cycle but also the pathogenesis of HEV.
To conclude, our results point toward an important host-dependent posttranslational modification of HEV ORF3 protein, its palmitoylation, which has important functional implications for HEV biology.

(+) or pCMVKEB-GFP.
Immunoblot
Protein lysates were prepared and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by immunoblot analysis as described previously [50].
In vitro transcription, electroporation and infection assays
Capped full-length HEV RNA was produced by in vitro transcription using the mMACHINE
mMESSAGE Kit from Ambion (Thermo Fischer Scientific), followed by electroporation into
Hep293TT cells or transfection of S10-3 cells using TransIT-mRNA transfection kit (Mirus
Bio LLC, Madison, WI) [43]. Cells were cultured for 5 to 8 days before harvesting to prepare
protein lysates, to perform immunofluorescence or to collect intra- and extracellular compartments for infectivity determination.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
FRET analysis has been performed as previously described [35]. Briefly, U-2 OS cells cultured
on glass coverslips were transfected with constructs expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins
and fixed at 24 h posttransfection with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and the coverslips
were mounted on glass slides with SlowFade reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Acceptor
photobleaching FRET was performed using an SP5 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope
(Leica; Wetzlar, Germany).
Radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation
To detect palmitoylation, U-2 OS cells were transfected with pCMVORF3, pCMVORF3C1-4 or
pCMVORF3C5-8 plasmids and Hep293TT were electroporated with full-length HEV p6 or
83–2 RNAs prior to incubation with radiolabelled palmitate 24 h or 6 days post-transfection,
respectively. The cells were washed twice and incubated at 37˚C for 1 h in the respective
medium without FCS then followed by 3 h incubation in the same medium supplemented
with 200 μCi/mL 3
H-palmitate (9,10-3H(N)) (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St Louis,
MO). After three washes with cold PBS, cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 1 mM EDTA; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1X
cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Immunoprecipitation was
carried out by the incubation of each protein lysates overnight at 4˚C with 50 μL of Dynabeads
Protein G (Thermo Fischer Scientific) pre-adsorbed with 1 μl of rabbit anti-ORF3 pAb, gift
from Suzanne Emerson (NIH, Bethesda, MD), or unrelated rabbit serum as control, following
manufacturers’s recommendations. After three washes with 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS using a

magnetic device, elution was performed by incubation of the beads in 30 μL of 100 mM glycine
pH 3 for 5 min at RT. Samples were then incubated for 5 min at 90˚C in Laemmli buffer and
separated onto a 17% SDS-PAGE. Gel was either incubated 30 min at 20˚C in a fixative solution (25% isopropanol, 65% H2O, 10% acetic acid), followed by a 30 min incubation with signal enhancer Amplify NAMP100 (GE Healthcare) and subjected to autoradiography for 40
days or undergone immunoblot analysis with pAb anti-ORF3.
Confocal microscopy
S10-3 cells were grown onto 22-mm diameter glass coverslips before being assayed. Briefly,
cells were fixed 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde at 20˚C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS
and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin in PBS for 5 min, followed by a 20-min incubation in
10% goat serum blocking solution. Cells were successively incubated for 1 h with the first antibody and then with Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Additional incubation with DAPI (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) allowed staining of the nuclei. Slides were prepared using antifade mounting
medium ProLong (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM 710
quasar laser scanning fluorescence confocal microscope and images were treated with ImageJ
software.
Selective permeabilization
S10-3 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and transfected 24 h later with ORF3 expression
vectors or co-transfected with pUHD15-1 [51] and pUHD-Cp7 plasmids allowing the expression of HCV core-p7 region, as described previously [30]. Forty-eight h post-transfection cells
were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min and then permeabilized,
totally, with either 0.5% saponin or 0.2% digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich) or selectively with 0.01%
digitonin. Cells were then washed and incubated 15 min at 20˚C in blocking buffer containing
3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Indirect immunofluorescence was then performed by onehour incubation at 20˚C with primary antibody, followed by 3 PBS washes and incubation
with the secondary antibody as described above.
Statistical analyses
Significance values were calculated by using the unpaired t test with the GraphPad Prism 6
software package (GraphPad Software).
