Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a crucial molecule in
energy metabolism, is reported to play a potential role in gut epithelial differentiation and
barrier function recently; however, its performance and mechanisms in the pathological
process of inflammatory bowel diseases remain unidentified. In this study, we have
found that the phosphorylation of AMPK in colonic tissues is negatively correlated with
severity of disease during the initiation and development of experimental colitis induced
by dextran sulfate sodium. Activation of AMPK by metformin significantly controls
the progression of colitis, which is associated with the maintenance of tight junction
in colonic epithelium in mice. Moreover, our in vitro data in colonic epithelial Caco2
cells shows that metformin promotes expression and assembly of tight junctions via
an AMPK-dependent way. Overall, our results suggested that activating AMPK by a
clinically safe drug metformin could be a beneficial choice for colitis treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Pain relief, immunosuppression and anti-bacterial have been regarded as main strategies in the
treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD); however, the importance of intestinal barrier
maintenance in protection against colitis was somehow underestimated. Intestinal barrier is
composed of epithelial cells sealed by tight junctions, which prevent the permeation of pathogens,
toxins, and antigens from the luminal environment into the mucosal tissues. Tight junctions,
consist of multiple proteins such as transmembrane proteins: occludin, claudins, and junctional
adhesion molecules (JAM) and cytoplasmic adaptor proteins such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1),
are critical in the function of epithelial barrier. During the initiation of IBD, tight junction functions
are impaired and substantially precede the development of the disease. Therefore, elucidating the
changes of tight junctions and targeting their upstream regulators may be effective for the treatment
of IBD.
Adenosine monophosphate–activated kinase (AMPK) is an important energy sensor regulating
energy homeostasis and metabolic stress in many cells. The inactivation condition of AMPK
contributes to many pathologic processes, such as diabetes, tumor, aging, and inflammatory
diseases (Burkewitz et al., 2014; Burkle and Hanfling, 2015). AMPK phosphorylation is reported
to be involved in tight junction assembly and cell polarization in Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells (Zhang et al., 2006; Zheng and Cantley, 2007), but still remains elusive in many

other cells. Recently, it is shown that AMPK enhances intestinal
barrier function and epithelial differentiation via promoting
CDX2 expression (Silberg et al., 2000). However, characteristics
and functional implications of AMPK in the process of IBD are
under investigated in colonic epithelium, an essential and the first
station for processing inflammatory information. We examined
alterations of phosphorylation for AMPK subunits in the colons
after inflammation induction and further examined whether and
how administration of metformin, the most widely prescribed
oral AMPK activator, might restore tight junction function
and inhibit dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced experimental
colitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Six to eight-week male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the
Model Animal Genetics Research Center of Nanjing University
(Nanjing, China). Animal welfare and experimental procedures
were carried out strictly in accordance with the recommendation
of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Ministry
of Science and Technology of China, 2006), and the Nanjing
University Animal Care and Use Committee (NJU-ACUC). The
protocol was approved by the Nanjing University Animal Care
and Use Committee (NJU-ACUC) and to minimize suffering and
to reduce the number of mice used.
Reagents
Dextran sulfate sodium was purchased from MP Biomedicals
(Aurora, OH, United States). Compound C and AICAR were
purchased from MedChemExpress (MCE, United States).
Antibody for phosphorylated AMPK (Thr172) was purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, United States),
antibodies for AMPKα1/2, ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, Actin,
Tubulin were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA,
United States), IgG for rabbit and mouse were purchased
from (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). Human recombinant
interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was purchased from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN, United States). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
metformin, mesalazine and other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States). Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Life
Technology (Carlsbad, CA, United States)
Induction and Treatment of Colitis
2.5% (wt/vol) DSS was utilized to induce acute colitis in
mice. Mice administrated with DSS dissolved in drinking water
continuously from day 0 to day 7. Normal mice received the
same drinking water without DSS. Metformin, mesalazine and
AICAR were dissolved in normal saline, Compound C was
diluted in normal saline from stock solution, which was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Metformin (125, 250, 500 mg/kg,
p.o.), mesalazine (200 mg/kg, p.o.), AICAR (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and
Compound C (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered once a day from
day 0 to day 11 (n = 6–8 mice per group). Weight, morbidity
and the presence of gross blood in feces and at the anus were
observed daily. The disease activity index (DAI) was calculated
by assigning well-established and validated scores as previously
described (Wu et al., 2014). That is, the following parameters
were used for calculation: (a) diarrhea (0 points = normal,
2 points = loose stools, 4 points = watery diarrhea); (b)
hematochezia (0 points = no bleeding, 2 points = slight bleeding,
4 points = gross bleeding). At day 9 following induction with
DSS, the animals were sacrificed, the entire colon was quickly
removed for ex vivo study. Segments of the colon taken for
histopathological essay were fixed in 10% normal buffered
formalin, embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and histological score was evaluated
(blinded) as follows: 0, no signs of inflammation; 1, low leukocyte
infiltration; 2, moderate leukocyte infiltration; 3, high leukocyte
infiltration, moderate fibrosis, high vascular density thickening
of the colon wall, moderate goblet cell loss, and focal loss of
crypts; and 4, transmural infiltrations, massive loss of goblet cell,
extensive fibrosis, and diffuse loss of crypts.
Isolation of Colonic Epithelial Cells
Mice were sacrificed after anesthesia and a portion of the colons
close to the rectum were immediately removed. Epithelial cells
were obtained from freshly isolated colons and flushed from
both ends with sterile phosphate buffer (PBS). Colons were then
opened longitudinally and thoroughly washed in cold PBS. The
colon was then incubated in 10 ml 30 mM ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 1.5 mM dithiothretol (DTT) on
ice for 20 min and then removed and washed in cold PBS and
incubated in 10 ml PBS containing 30 mM EDTA at 37◦C at 200
RPM for 10 min. The cells were shaking vigorously for 30 s and
centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4◦C, washed in PBS containing
10% FBS and spun for a further 5 min at 4◦C at 1000 g. Cell pellets
constituted isolated colonic epithelial cell fractions.
Western Blot
Samples were collected and lysed in a lysis buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce). The proteins were
fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred
onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membrane was
blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Different
antibodies were incubated overnight at 4◦C. After washing with
PBST for 3 times, 10 min/time, membranes were incubated
with secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Finally,
membranes were washed by PBST for 3 times, 10 min/time, and
the software Quantity One (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
United States) was used for densitometric analysis.
Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Real-time PCR was performed as described previously
(Schmittgen and Livak, 2008). Total RNA of colon tissue was
reverse transcribed to cDNA and subjected to quantitative PCR,
which was performed with the BioRad CFX96 TouchTM RealTime PCR Detection System (BioRad, CA, United States) using
iQTM SYBRR Green Supermix (BioRad, CA, United States),
and threshold cycle numbers were obtained using BioRad CFX
Manager software. The program for amplification was 1 cycle
of 95◦C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95◦C for 10 s, 60◦C

Immunofluorescence Histochemistry
For paraffin-embedded colonic tissue, the sections (4–5 µm)
were deparaffinized, rehydrated and washed in 1% PBS-Tween
20 (PBST). Then they were blocked with 3% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and
incubated with anti-phosphorylated AMPK antibody (1: 100)
and IgG (1:100) overnight at 4 C. After washing with PBST
for 3 times, 10 min/time, slides were incubated with fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, at room
temperature for 2 h and then stained with 1 µg/mL DAPI (40,6-
diamidino-2-phenylin- dole) for 1 min. Likewise, for Caco2 cells,
after treated with 2.5% DSS for 48 h with or without metformin
(30 µM), cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol and were
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/PBST. After blocking with
3% BSA for 2 h, the Caco2 cells were incubated with the ZO-1,
claudin-1 and occludin antibody (1:100) overnight at 4◦C. After
washing with PBST for 3 times, 10 min/time, cells were exposed
to the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, at room
temperature for 2 h). Finally, the coverslips were stained with
DAPI for 1 min and washed with PBST for 3 times, 10 min/time.
Confocal microscopy analyses were carried out using Olympus
FV1000 confocal system (Olympus, Japan).
Immunohistochemical Analysis
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffinembedded colon tissue sections (4–5 µm) to evaluate the
expression of ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin. Slides were
deparaffinized, rehydrated and blocked as described above,
and incubated with ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin antibody
(1:100) overnight at 4◦C. After washing with PBST for 3
time, 10 min/time, slides were incubated with streptavidinHRP (Shanghai Gene Company, GK500705, Shanghai, China)
for 40 min, then stained with DAB (Shanghai Gene Company,
GK500705, Shanghai, China) substrate for 2–10 min and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Cell Culture
Caco2 cells were purchased from Shanghai Institute of Cell
Biology (Shanghai, China) and maintained in DMEM medium,
supplemented with 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 µg/ml of
streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum under a humidified 5%
(v/v) CO2 atmosphere at 37◦C.
Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. of three independent
experiments and each experiment included triplicate sets. Data
were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by
Dunnett’s test between control group and multiple dose groups.
The level of significance was set at a P-value of 0.05.
RESULTS
The Phosphorylation Level of AMPK Was
Downregulated During the Progression
of Colitis Induced by DSS in Mice
To investigate the potential role of AMPK during the progression
of colitis, the activation of AMPK, which is characterized
as phosphorylation on Thr172 in α subunit, was evaluated
during the development of colitis induced by DSS. As shown
in Figure 1A, mice were administrated with 2.5% DSS for 7
consecutive days, and then substituted with water for another
4 days. Colon length was substantially reduced during the
progression of colitis, indicating the worsened condition of
inflammation (Figure 1B). Meanwhile, epithelium was isolated
and collected from colons in mice after DSS administration on
Day 0, 5, 7 and water administration on Day 9, 11, respectively. It
was shown that the activation of AMPK was gradually decreased
during DSS administration and then slightly increased after
drinking water (Figures 1C,D). Consistent with this result, the
immunofluorescence of phosphorylated AMPK showed the same
tendency (Figures 1E,F).
Metformin Up-Regulated AMPK
Phosphorylation and Ameliorated
Experimental Colitis Induced by DSS in
Mice
According to the results in Figure 1, we found an inverse
correlation between AMPK phosphorylation level and colitis
severity. Therefore, we wonder whether promoting AMPK
activation could prevent the development of colitis. Since
metformin has previously been demonstrated to active AMPK
and is considered as a safe drug in clinical application,
we use metformin to further study the role of AMPK
in colitis. Mesalazine, a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is
widely used for IBD treatment (Frieri et al., 2017). In the
present study, we used mesalazine (200 mg/kg) as a positive
control. Mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 6–8 per
group): normal, DSS alone, DSS with metformin (125, 250,
and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) and DSS with mesalazine (200 mg/kg,
p.o.). Colonic epithelial cells were isolated for western blot.
As shown in Figures 2A,B, compared with DSS group,
metformin (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg) exhibited significant
effect on AMPK activation. Simultaneously, compared with
normal group, mice administrated with 2.5% DSS showed

typical symptoms of colitis, characterized as significant weight
loss, shortened colon length, and elevated disease activity
index (DAI) which reflected severity of colitis (including
diarrhea, intestinal bleeding). In contrast, these responses in
mice treated with metformin (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg) were
attenuated markedly in a dose-dependent manner. In addition,
mesalazine showed weaker effects than metformin (500 mg/kg)
(Figures 2C–F).
Metformin Attenuated Pathological
Damages Induced by DSS in Mice
To further confirm the inhibitory effect of metformin on colitis,
histological changes and cytokine profiles were examined.
As shown in Figures 3A,B, sections from colon tissue
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) showed a loss
of architecture and immune cell infiltration. However, the
inflammatory responses were obviously reduced following
metformin (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg) or mesalazine (200 mg/kg)
treatment. The blinded histological score also revealed that oral
administration of metformin was associated with a significant
down-regulation in the severity of colitis. Furthermore,
inflammation-associated factors such as interleukin-18 (IL-18),
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Cyclooxygenase2
(COX2), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1),
and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were examined
in mRNA level. As showed in Figure 3C, IL-18, IL-1β, IL6, COX2, ICAM1, iNOS were upregulated in DSS-induced

inflammation. By contrast, mRNA levels of these factors were
significantly decreased in mice treated with metformin or
mesalazine.
Metformin Prevented the Loss of Tight
Junction Induced by DSS in Mice
To further investigate the effect of metformin on tight
junctions (i.e., ZO-1, claudin-1 and occluding proteins) during
experimental colitis, colonic epithelium of mice from each
group was isolated and the expression of tight junction proteins
were examined by western blot and immunohistochemistry.
As shown in Figures 4A,B, there was a dramatic loss of
tight junction proteins staining in mice treated with DSS.
Interestingly, concomitant administration of metformin (125,
250, and 500 mg/kg) significantly prevented the loss of tight
junction proteins. The immunohistochemistrical results also
showed that substantial decrease of these three tight junction
proteins was regained in mice treated with metformin or
mesalazine (Figures 4C–F and Supplementary Figure S1).
The Effect of Metformin on DSS-Induced
Experimental Colitis Was Dependent on
AMPK Activation
Since metformin has been reported to have some other targets
(Kim et al., 2016), we further used Compound C, a specific
inhibitor of AMPK and another AMPK activator, AICAR, to
examine whether metformin functioned via AMPK activation.
Mice were divided into 5 groups (n = 6–8 per group): normal,
DSS with vehicle, DSS with metformin (500 mg/kg, p.o.), DSS
with metformin (500 mg/kg, p.o.) and Compound C (10 mg/kg,
i.p.), DSS with AICAR (100 mg/kg, i.p.). Intestinal epithelial
cells were isolated from colon tissue for western blot tests
(Figures 5A,B), we found that both metformin and AICAR
activated AMPK significantly, while Compound C could reverse

AMPK activation induced by metformin. Similarly, AICAR
could also attenuate DSS-induced colitis and promoted the
expression of tight junctions. However, the therapeutic effect
of metformin on experimental colitis and damaged integrity
of intestinal epithelium induced by DSS was almost reversed
by Compound C. These data suggested that regulation of tight
junctions by metformin occurs in an AMPK-dependent manner
(Figures 5C–H).
Metformin Increased the Expression of
Tight Junctions in an AMPK-Dependent
Way in Caco2 Cells in Vitro
To further study the mechanism underlying the effect of
metformin on tight junction proteins, we used Caco2 cells which
could form tight junctions when grew into monolayer. To mimic
the circumstance of epithelial cells during colitis, 2.5% DSS, IFNγ (1000 U) or LPS (500 ng/ml) were applied to mimic epithelial
cell damage in colitis in vitro respectively (Araki et al., 2006;
Cao et al., 2013; Satyam et al., 2017). As shown in Figures 6A–I
and Supplementary Figure S2, cells were incubated with 2.5%
DSS for 48 h, and with IFN-γ (1000 U) or LPS (500 ng/ml)
for 72 h respectively, a significant down-regulation of p-AMPK
with decreased expression of tight junction proteins (i.e., ZO-1,
claudin-1 and occludin) was observed by western blot. However,
protein level of p-AMPK, tight junction proteins was markedly
increased in the presence of metformin (10, 30, and 100 µM).
Next, we used Compound C and AICAR to test whether
the effect of metformin was dependent on AMPK. As shown in
Figures 7A–C, AICAR (0.3, 1 mM) significantly up-regulated the
decreased expression of tight junction proteins induced by 2.5%
DSS in Caco2 cells, which exhibited a similar effect of metformin.
Nevertheless, AMPK phosphorylation caused by metformin was
markedly inhibited by compound C (1 µM) in Caco2 cells,
with a consequent reverse on the increased expression of ZO-1,
claudin-1 and occludin mediated by metformin (Figures 7D–F).
Metformin Promoted Assembly of Tight
Junctions in Caco2 Cells in Vitro
It is shown in previous studies that AMPK facilitates the assembly
of tight junctions in epithelial cells (Calder et al., 2017; Prasad
et al., 2017; Rowart et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017). Here we
observed the distribution of ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin in
the presence or absence of metformin (30 µM) in Caco2 cells
after 2.5% DSS treatment for 48 h with immunofluorescence

staining and confocal microscopy. As shown in Figures 8A–D,
DSS treatment induced irregular morphology and distribution
of ZO-1, claudin-1 and occluding. However, the membranedistribution and assembly of these tight junction proteins were
significantly enhanced by metformin. These data demonstrated
that AMPK activation by metformin maintained the structure
of tight junctions in colonic epithelial cells and increased their
resistance to DSS damage.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that (Burkle and Hanfling, 2015) the active
form of AMPK (phosphorylation on Tyr172) was decreased
during the progression of colitis in colonic epithelial cells in
mice; (Burkewitz et al., 2014) administration of metformin,
a classic drug to activate AMPK, attenuated symptoms of
colitis significantly; (Zheng and Cantley, 2007) the underlying
mechanism of preventing colitis by metformin relied on its
regulation of tight junctions via AMPK activation. Collectively,
these results illustrated the relevance between colonic epithelium
damage and AMPK function. They may provide a beneficial
strategy for treating colitis using an AMPK-activator clinically.
AMPK, a serine/threonine kinase, is a highly conserved energy
sensor. It is activated by phosphorylation on Thr172 in the
catalytic subunit (α) by LKB1, CAMKK2, ATP-to-AMP ratio
and so on (Herzig and Shaw, 2017). Under conditions of low
energy, activated AMPK phosphorylates downstream substrates,
leading to ATP generation and decreases ATP consumption,
thus modulating energy metabolism (Hutber et al., 1997;
Hardie, 2007). Accumulating evidence has proved that there are
marked dysfunctions in metabolic regulation in immune cells in
many diseases, including inflammatory conditions. For example,
activated macrophages and T-helper 17 cell have increased
glucose uptake and glycolysis; conversely, anti-inflammatory
cells, such as M2 macrophages, regulatory T cells, have lower
glycolytic rates and higher levels of oxidative metabolism. AMPK
activation creates a pseudo-starving state that can promote
oxidative metabolism and inhibits inflammation through many
signaling networks, such as nuclear factor κB and mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway (O’Neill and
Hardie, 2013; Song et al., 2015; Peixoto et al., 2017; Di Fusco et al.,

2018). Hence, AMPK is a crucial regulator of these metabolic
dysfunction responses in immune cells.
However, during the progression of colitis, epithelial cells
also play important roles in keeping integrity of intestinal
barrier and the role of epithelial AMPK remains elusive.
Although a recent study has revealed that AMPK deletion
exacerbates DSS-induced colitis and AMPK could promote
gut epithelial differentiation and barrier function (Sun et al.,

Chen et al. Metformin Promotes Tight Junction Assembly
FIGURE 6 | Metformin up-regulated the loss expression of tight junctions induced by DSS, IFN-γ or LPS in Caco2 cells. (A–C) Caco2 cells were treated with 2.5%
DSS in the presence or absence of metformin (10, 30, and 100 µM) for 48 h. (D–I) Caco2 cells were incubated with IFN-γ (1000 U) or LPS (500 ng/ml) in the
presence or absence of metformin (10, 30, and 100 µM) for 72 h respectively. The expression of p-AMPK, AMPKα1/2 and tight junction proteins were determined by
western blot. Quantifications of immunoreactive signals were performed after normalization to total protein content of each lane. Data are presented as
mean ± SEM; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 vs. normal group, ∗P < 0.05, ∗∗P < 0.01 vs. DSS, IFN-γ or LPS-treated alone group.

2017), the changes of AMPK during colitis is still unclear.
In the present study, we found that during the initiation and
development of colitis, AMPK phosphorylation on Thr172, as
the activate form of AMPK, was gradually decreased while the
expression of total AMPK was unchanged, and reactivation of
AMPK by metformin could significantly reduce the severity
of DSS-induced colitis. Since AMPK is not the sole target
for metformin, we used Compound C, a specific inhibitor
of AMPK, to examine whether the effect of metformin on
colitis and the integrity of tight junction is dependent on
AMPK activation. As shown in Figures 5, 7D–F, Compound
C could reverse the effect of metformin in both in vivo
and in vitro experiments. Moreover, AICAR, another AMPK
activator exhibited a similar effect on tight junction as metformin
(Figures 5, 7A–C). These results indicated that the effect of
metformin on colitis and tight junction was dependent on AMPK
activation.
During the pathological process of IBD, the impaired
intestinal barrier function can increase permeability of intestinal
tract, triggering pathogen bacteria into lamina propria (Jenkins
et al., 1987; Buhner et al., 2006). The harmful production like
LPS, released by pathogen bacteria could induce immunological
disorders, such as infiltrating and activating macrophage,
inducing excessive effector T cells and recruiting neutrophils,
resulting in overproduction of many pro-inflammatory cytokines
(i.e., IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6), which exacerbate colitis to a
great extent(Bouma and Strober, 2003; Sartor, 2006). Hence,
in addition to DSS, we also used IFN-γ or LPS to mimic
the environment of colitis in Caco2 cells respectively (Araki
et al., 2006; Cao et al., 2013; Satyam et al., 2017), and we
found that metformin could up-regulate the decreased expression
of tight junction proteins upon these three stimulations
(Figure 6).
It is worth noting that, the effects of metformin on cytokine
profiles are not on dose dependent manner (Figure 3C), which
seems contradictory with the therapeutic effect of metformin in
colitis. As is widely accepted, colitis is a kind of complex disease,
including many pathological processes, such as intestinal barrier
dysfunction and inflammatory disorders, and they may play
different roles in the different time points during the progression
of colitis. We speculated that during different pathological
processes, metformin functions via different mechanisms. For
example, many signaling pathways are involved in inflammatory
responses in immune cells, and in addition to AMPK, metformin
could target to some other crucial points directly (Buldak et al.,
2014; Koh et al., 2014; Pandey et al., 2017), so the dosage of
metformin towards inflammation seems to be lower than that
towards epithelial tissue. In terms of intestinal epithelial cells,
amounting studies have proved that AMPK plays an important
role in regulation of tight junctions. These effects have been
mechanically implicated in some previous works that AMPK,
depending on the kinase activity of LKB1, might promote ZO-1

Chen et al. Metformin Promotes Tight Junction Assembly
assembly in MDCK cells (Zhang et al., 2006; Zheng and Cantley,
2007); and AMPK can promote gut epithelial differentiation
and barrier function through accelerating the expression of the
intestinal caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2), a key transcription
factor for intestinal differentiation via histone modifications
(Silberg et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2017). Collectively, AMPK is
the pivotal target for metformin in intestinal epithelial cells.
Hence, the dose of metformin on regulation of tight junction
was higher than the dose on anti-inflammatory in immune cells.
However, the different effect of metformin on inflammatory or
tight junction – remains to be intensively studied in future.
To date, metformin has been demonstrated to have varieties of
effects other than anti-diabetes. Its potential clinical applications
continue to be expanded, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammation
and anti-aging effects. Although the mechanisms of these
pharmacological effects still remain to be clearly elucidated, it
is widely accepted that AMPK is the most important target of
metformin. It can activate AMPK by inhibiting mitochondrial
complex I in respiratory chain to increase the AMP/ATP ratio
(Owen et al., 2000). In this study, we reported for the first time
that in addition to its anti-inflammation effect, metformin can
also improve the mucosal integrity via promoting expression
and assembly of tight junctions in an AMPK-dependent way.
More importantly, metformin exerts a greater effect than
mesalazine on attenuation of colitis induced by DSS, which
makes metformin more attractive in IBD treatment. Given to
the safety and effectiveness of metformin, there is an enticing
prospect of new therapeutic approaches for inflammatory
diseases.
