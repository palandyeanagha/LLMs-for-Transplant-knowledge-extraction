Abstract
Background: Portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a relatively rare but well-recognized complication of end-stage
liver disease. Moderate or severe PPH (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP] ≥ 35 mmHg) is usually a contraindication
for liver transplantation due to high operation-related mortality. Here, we report on a patient with moderate PPH whose
condition was successfully managed with a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor (tadalafil) and prostaglandin E1,
who experienced rapid improvement of PPH after living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT).
Case presentation: A 63-year-old woman with alcoholic decompensated cirrhosis was referred to our hospital for LDLT.
She had mild dyspnea on exertion as well as fatigue. Echocardiography and subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed
a high mPAP (35 mmHg), and she was diagnosed with moderate PPH. We commenced treatment with oral tadalafil for
the PPH. A second preoperative echocardiography demonstrated improved PPH, and she underwent LDLT. An intravenous
infusion of prostaglandin E1 was introduced instead of tadalafil during and after the operation.
The mPAP value showed a rapid decrease in mPAP value to 22 mmHg in 2 days. After discontinuation of the prostaglandin
E1, the mPAP value remained 23 mmHg. Postoperative catheterization 2 months after LDLT showed no exacerbation of
PPH. She was discharged on foot 70 days after LDLT in good condition and has shown a good clinical condition more
than 2 years after LDLT.
Conclusion: LDLT could be a radical treatment for PPH with careful management and adequate patient selection. PDE5
inhibitor and PGE1 is effective and feasible for perioperative management of the patient with moderate portopulmonary
hypertension in LDLT.

Background
Portopulmonary hypertension (PPH) is defined by the
coexistence of portal and pulmonary hypertension and is a
relatively rare but well-recognized complication of endstage liver disease. PPH is diagnosed in up to 12.5% of
patients for whom orthotopic liver transplantation is
planned [1]. PPH can be categorized into mild (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP] of 25–34 mmHg) or moderate to severe (mPAP ≥ 35 mmHg) [1, 2]. Without prior
attempts to reduce pulmonary pressure, moderate PPH
(mPAP 35–50 mmHg) causes an estimated 50% mortality
rate after liver transplantation and severe PPH (mPAP >
50 mmHg) may result in a 100% mortality rate [3, 4].
Based on these results, it has been recommended that
liver transplantation should not be considered if a patient’s
mPAP value is ≥ 45 mmHg; vasodilation treatment before
liver transplantation should be considered if the mPAP
value is 35–45 mmHg [5].
Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have recently
attracted attention as selective pulmonary vasodilators. Here,
we report a case of a patient with decompensated liver
cirrhosis complicated by moderate PPH who underwent
adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) with
successful perioperative management using the PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil in combination with prostaglandin E1, and
showed a rapid improvement of PPH after LDLT.
Case presentation
A 63-year-old woman diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis
was referred to our hospital for LDLT. The blood tests
and physical examination revealed that liver cirrhosis
was graded Child-Turcott-Pugh classification C and her
calculated model for end-stage liver disease (MELD)
score was 17. Preoperative CT scan and endoscopy
revealed that she had portosystemic collaterals, such as
right spleno-renal shunt and duodenal varix (Fig. 1a, b).
She had mild dyspnea on exertion as well as fatigue.
Chest radiographs and computed tomography showed
mild cardiomegaly (chest-thoracic ratio, 56%); however,
no abnormal findings were seen in the lung field. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed mild hypoxemia at
room air (pH, 7.468; partial pressure of carbon dioxide
[pCO2], 38.3 mmHg; partial pressure of oxygen [pO2],
83.0 mmHg), although a radiolabeled technetium
macroaggregated-albumin (99mTc-MAA) perfusion scan
showed an insignificant right-left shunt of 3.8%, indicating the absence of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS;
Fig. 1c). Echocardiography revealed tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with estimated mPAP of 54 mmHg, TR-peak
pressure gradient value of 62.2 mmHg, and pulmonary
vascular resistance (PVR) of 520 dynes s/cm5 suggesting
pulmonary hypertension (Fig. 2). Heart contractility was
normal with normal ejection fraction values of 65%. The
patient proceeded to cardiac catheterization, which
revealed a high mPAP value (36 mmHg), high pulmonary vascular resistance (476 dynes s/cm5
), and normal
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP; 9 mmHg).
The patient’s cardiac output (CO) was 4.20 L/min, and

cardiac index (CI) was 2.91 L/min/m2 (Table 1). Accordingly, she was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis accompanied by moderate-grade PPH. We commenced treatment
with oral tadalafil (20 mg/day), an oral once-daily PDE5
inhibitor, for moderate PPH. The patient tolerated the tadalafil therapy well. Twenty-five days after starting tadalafil, a
second preoperative echocardiography demonstrated good
response to tadalafil and improved PPH with an estimated
mPAP of 22 mmHg, TR-peak pressure gradient value of
26.3 mmHg, and PVR of 184 dynes s/cm5
.
Thirty-two days after the initiation of tadalafil, she
underwent LDLT with a left lobe graft from her daughter.
The graft-versus-recipient weight ratio was 0.76%. Dobutamine hydrochloride (3 μg/kg/min) was administered
temporally after graft reperfusion. The pre-explant portal
vein pressure was 25 mmHg during surgery and decreased
to 17 mmHg after reperfusion. The operation time was
9 h and 56 min, while the total blood loss was 1200 mL.
Immunosuppression consisted of methylprednisolone and
tacrolimus. An intravenous systemic infusion of prostaglandin E1 (7 ng/kg/min) was started after graft reperfusion and continued intra- and postoperatively instead of
tadalafil [6–9]. No hemodynamic events occurred during
the operation.
The mPAP values were continuously monitored using a
cardiac catheter intra- and postoperatively, and values rapidly decreased to 22 mmHg 2 days after the LDLT (Table 1).
After weaning and discontinuation of the prostaglandin E1,
the mPAP value remained 23 mmHg. After mPAP stability
was confirmed, the cardiac catheter was removed. Since the
mPAP value was effectively reduced, we decided to not subject the patient to a further course of tadalafil. She showed a
lot of ascites and hyperbilirubinemia several weeks after
LDLT, suggesting mild small-for-size syndrome. This

syndrome was gradually resolved by treatment with diuretics
and liver graft function gradually improved without rejection
(Fig. 3), while a surgical site infection by gram-positive bacillus occurred and she was treated with a course of antibiotics.
After LDLT on POD 60, Doppler echocardiography revealed
that the TR had disappeared with lowered estimated mPAP,
TR-PPG, and PVR value from 54 to 24 mmHg, 62.2 to
27.6 mmHg, and 520 to 234 dynes s/cm5
, respectively (Fig. 2
and Table 1), suggesting an effective retrieval of right heart
function. Right heart catheterization 62 days after the LDLT
showed that the mPAP value remained at 22 mmHg with a
CO of 4.56 L/min and CI of 3.5 L/min/m2
, suggesting that
the PPH had attenuated (Table 1). ABG analysis showed
improved oxygenation at room air (pH 7.393; pCO2,
30.8 mmHg; pO2, 111.0 mmHg). The patient was
discharged 70 days post-LDLT in good condition with no
signs of cardiac insufficiency and good liver graft function.
She has shown a good clinical course for over 2 years after
the LDLT without any evidence of PPH.
An association between portal hypertension and pulmonary hypertension was first reported by Mantz and
Craige [10]. PPH is defined as elevated PAP accompanied
by hepatic disease and portal hypertension, while the key
finding is clearly an elevated calculated PVR [11]. The criteria for the diagnosis of PPH include an elevated resting
mPAP value ≥ 25 mmHg, an elevated PVR of ≥
120 dynes s/cm5
, normal PCWP (≤ 15 mmHg), and evidence of portal hypertension [12]. However, more recent
studies have proposed that the PVR value for the diagnosis
of PPH should exceed 240 or 250 dynes s/cm5 [13, 14].
The most typical pulmonary symptoms include fatigue,
exertional dyspnea, syncope, and chest pain; however,

these symptoms are absent in about 60% of patients at the
time of diagnosis [15]. Mild hypoxemia at rest due to diffusion limitations and TR may be present on examination.
Our patient met the diagnostic criteria of PPH.
PPH is most commonly diagnosed 4–7 years after the
diagnosis of portal hypertension [16], and the longer the
portal hypertension persists, the greater the risk of PPH
exists [16, 17]. The prognosis of patients with PPH is poor,
with a mean survival of 15 month [15]. Death occurs due
to liver failure, infection, or right heart failure. As mentioned in the “Background” section, liver transplantation in
patients with moderate to severe PPH is associated with significantly higher mortality rate [3, 4]. Therefore, several reports have recommended that preoperative estimation of
PPH severity by using cardiac catheterization is necessary for
the patient selection and preoperative treatment of patients
with moderate PPH using vasodilators [1, 5, 18]. Following
these recommendations, there have been several reports of
successful liver transplantation for patients with moderate to
severe PPH using vasodilators in the perioperative period as
a bridging therapy, similar to the case reported herein.
Several agents have been used to treat PPH prior to liver
transplantation, including epoprostenol [19], bosentan
[20], sildenafil [21], iloprost [22], and a combination of
these agents [23]. Prostanoids including prostaglandin E1
(alprostadil) and prostacyclin (epoprostenol) are the most
widely used and most effective agents for bridging therapy
[6–9]. Another agent is the endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan. Its adverse effect of hepatic dysfunction has
limited its use for decompensated liver disease, although it
has been seen in only a few patients. Increasing evidence
of the efficacy of the PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, is emerging, and it has been used for patients with PPH. PDE5 inhibitors boost the effect of endogenous nitrous oxide by
inhibiting the breakdown of the messenger substance cyclic guanosine monophosphate, leading to pulmonary vasodilatation and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle
proliferation. Selective pulmonary vasodilators rather than
systemic vasodilators have demonstrated relatively few adverse effects [24]. Additionally, they are generally well tolerated and have been used successfully for the treatment
of pulmonary hypertension [25]. Tadalafil, another PDE5
inhibitor, is a once-daily oral medication that has shown
comparably significant pulmonary vasorelaxation in patients with pulmonary hypertension [26]. In our case, we
observed successful resolution of PPH using tadalafil without any complications or evidence of toxicity and with
good tolerability. Including the present case, only a few reports have described LDLT for adult patients with PPH
[27–29] and a few reports have described a combination
use of PDE5 inhibitor (sildenafil) and other drugs as bridging therapy in LDLT [30–33].
The patient in this case experienced a rapid improvement of PPH after LDLT. It is debatable whether PPH
is reversible after liver transplantation. Most patients
with PPH show improved or normalized PAP and can
be weaned from vasomodulating medication, which
usually takes months [3]. In our case, PPH was rapidly
resolved after LDLT. In fact, in our case, we had
planned switching back to tadalafil after LDLT; however, the resolution of PPH was more rapid than we
had expected. On the other hand, some of patients
require long-term treatment due to persistent and progressive pulmonary hypertension after liver transplantation [34]. One speculation for this contradiction is
that reversibility might depend on PPH stage. Pathoetiologically, in PPH, vasoactive substances initially
cause pulmonary constriction functionally, and subsequently cause endothelial proliferation, and vessel obliteration propagates PPH [35]. Progressive PPH may be
organic and irreversible, and its rapid resolution after
liver transplantation as seen in our case may be partly
attributed by earlier stage PPH. In addition, the responsibility to preoperative treatment with a vasodilator
may reflect the stage of PPH. Another speculation is
the coexistence of HPS. It has been reported that individual postoperative courses cannot be predicted by the
severity of PPH [22]. In some cases, concurrent or sequential onset of PPH with HPS is seen, although its
mechanisms are opposite [36]. HPS is a pulmonary vascular dilative process, while PPH is a pulmonary vascular constrictive/obliterative process resulting from
portal hypertension [37]. Therefore, PPH might be
masked by vasodilation of occult HPS and unmasked
by the resolution of HPS after liver transplantation. In
our case, occult HPS was absent. Although these are
only speculations, these points should be considered
and preoperative estimation of HPS and/or responsibility to vasodilator may be important for appropriate
selection of liver transplantation candidates.
Conclusions
Our case demonstrated that moderate PPH can be resolved
after adult-to-adult LDLT with appropriate preoperative
selection and management with bridging therapy with a
combination therapy of PDE5 inhibitor and PGE1. This
treatment is effective and feasible for a management of the
LDLT recipient with moderate PPH.
