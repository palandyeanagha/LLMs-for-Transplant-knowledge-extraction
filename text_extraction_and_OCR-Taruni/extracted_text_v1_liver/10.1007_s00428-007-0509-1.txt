Abstract The perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) is a cell
type constantly present in a group of tumors called PEComas.
PEC expresses myogenic and melanocytic markers, such as
HMB45 and actin. Recently, recurrent chromosomal alterations have been demonstrated in PEC. At present, PEComa is
a widely accepted entity. In the past 10 years, the use of this
term has allowed to report and describe numerous cases
permitting to start highlighting the biology of this group of
lesions. PEComas are related to the genetic alterations of
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant
genetic disease due to losses of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2
(16p13.3) genes which seem to have a role in the regulation of
the Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. There are some open
questions about PEComas regarding its histogenesis, the
definition of epithelioid angiomyolipoma and the identification of the histological criteria of malignancy. An innovative
therapeutic trial using rapamycin is under way for tumors
occurring in TSC such as renal angiomyolipoma and
lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Its success could provide the
rationale for the use of the same drug in other lesions
composed of PECs, especially in the malignant ones.

What is the perivascular epithelioid cell?
The perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) (Fig. 1) is a cell
type constantly present in a group of tumors including
angiomyolipoma (AML), clear-cell “sugar” tumor (CCST)
of the lung and extrapulmonary sites, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, clear-cell myomelanocytic tumor of the falciform
ligament/ligamentum teres and rare clear-cell tumors of
other anatomical sites.
It has morphologic, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural
and genetic distinctive features such as an epithelioid
appearance with a clear to granular cytoplasm, a round to
oval, centrally located nucleus and an inconspicuous nucleolus. PEC has mild to any atypia and a typical perivascular
location [13]. At present, PEC has not a known normal
counterpart.
Immunohistochemically, PEC expresses myogenic and
melanocytic markers, such as HMB45, HMSA-1, MelanA/
Mart1, microophtalmia transcription factor (Mitf), actin
and, less commonly, desmin [13, 55, 126]. Its immunoreactivity for vimentin is usually incospicuous.
At ultrastructural analysis, PEC contains microfilament
bundles with electron-dense condensation, numerous mithocondria and membrane-bound dense granules [11, 118].
It is thought that PEC can modulate its morphology and
immunophenotype: given all the characteristics described
above (Fig. 2), PEC can show muscular features with a
spindle shape and a stronger positivity for actin than for
HMB45 or it can have an epithelioid feature with a strong
positivity for HMB45 and a mild, if any, reaction for actin
(Fig. 3). PEC can also become vacuolized acquiring the
feature of an adipocyte. Progesterone receptor positivity has
been described in PEC with spindle morphology; this
suggests a possible role of progesterone in this morphologic
modulation [13, 107].

Recently, recurrent chromosomal alterations have been
demonstrated in PEC [87].
What is a PEComa?
The World Health Organization defines PEComa as “a
mesenchymal tumor composed of histologically and immunohistochemically distinctive perivascular epithelioid cells” [37].
At present, this neoplasm is a widely accepted entity.
However, some authors cast doubts on the existence of
PEComa as a distinctive tumor, particularly as regards the
uterine ones that they view as leiomyosarcoma with
aberrant expression of HMB45 [102–104]. Although we
understand their perplexity, we would like to underline
some points. First, it has been demonstrated that there are
different gene expression profiles among uterine smooth
muscle tumors, demonstrating their heterogeneity [105,
106, 119]. Second, we think that it is difficult to explain, in
uterine smooth muscle neoplasms, both HMB45 and Mitf
positivity as an aberrant expression or antibody crossreactivity involving both antigens [81]. Third, we think that
the absence of a recognized normal counterpart for PEC is
not a sufficient reason to reject the concept of PEComa; in
fact, there are other well-accepted soft-tissue neoplasms,
such as alveolar soft-part sarcoma and epithelioid sarcoma,
that still have not a known normal counterpart.
Some authors have questioned about the use of the term
“PEComa”. They consider it ambiguous because it is not
clear whether this term should be restricted to purely
epithelioid tumors as CCST or whether the term should be
more broadly applied to include AML and lymphangioleiomyomatosis [80, 111].
We believe that AML, CCST and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis are composed of PECs in different stages of
modulation, and these lesions, together with clear-cell
myomelanocytic tumor of the falciform ligament/ligamentum
teres, belong to the same family of tumors, the PEComas.
Nevertheless, we think that it is better to continue to
name some of them (i.e. AML and pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis) also with their established names
which identify their clinical and morphological aspects
and are well known by clinicians and pathologists [15].
Moreover, in the past 10 years, the use of the term
PEComa has permitted to report and describe numerous
cases with the morphological and immunohistochemical
features of this tumor permitting to start to understand the
biology of this group of lesions.

PEC and tuberous sclerosis
PEComas are related to the tuberous sclerosis complex
(TSC) or, better, to the genetic alterations of TSC, an
autosomal dominant genetic disease due to losses of TSC1
(9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes [112, 116] and characterized by mental retardation, seizures and cellular proliferations (AMLs, subependymal giant cell tumors, cutaneous
angiofibromas, cardiac rabdomyomas, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, pulmonary multifocal micronodular hyperplasia).
Similar alterations of the TSC genes have been demonstrated in a significant number of PEComas, both occurring
within the TSC and in sporadic cases.
In recent years, great advances have been made in our
knowledge of TSC and related lesions. In particular, TSC
genes seem to have an important role in the regulation of
the Rheb/mTOR/p70S6K pathway [62].
Kenerson et al. [59] have recently demonstrated increased levels of phospho-p70S6K, a marker of mTOR
activity, in sporadic AMLs. The associated reduced phospho-AKT expression is consistent with the disruption of
TSC1/2 function.
Similar findings were obtained analysing extrarenal
PEComas.
PEComa: the past
PEC was first described in 1943 by Apitz [5] as an “abnormal
myoblast” in renal AML, as reported by Masson [77] in his
famous book.
The idea of a possible link between AML and other two
lesions, CCST and lymphangioleiomyomatosis, came from
the fact that the same epithelioid cell was observed in them.
Moreover, this cell was HMB45-positive in all three lesions
[9, 93, 94].
Later, ultrastructural examination revealed the presence
of premelanosomes both in CCSTs of the lung and in
epithelioid clear-cell component of renal and hepatic AMLs
[9, 42, 43, 93, 94, 118].
In addition, the possibility of a relationship between
AML and lymphangioleiomyomatosis was suggested by the
fact that both occur in TSC [10].
We proposed that CCST should be also included in this
syndrome [10], and the first description of this tumor in a
patient with TSC confirmed this idea [35].
In 1996, we described the first case of pancreatic CCST
and suggested the name PEComa for neoplasms composed
of a pure proliferation of PECs [125].
Moreover, the fact that the same clear epithelioid cell
composing pulmonary “sugar” tumor was present in AML
and was the only component of some small renal microhamartoma (Fig. 4) suggested to us the idea of the existence
of a monotypic epithelioid AML of the kidney. We looked
for them, and we found them [96].
PEComa: the present
PEComas have been described in different organs and are
considered ubiquitous tumors.
Kidney
PEComas of the kidney include classic AML, microscopic
AML (so-called microhamartoma), intraglomerular lesions,
cystic AML, epithelioid AML, oncocytoma-like AML and
lymphangiomyomatosis of the renal sinus.
Classic angiomyolipoma is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the kidney. Being composed of a variable
mixture of adipose tissue and spindle and epithelioid
smooth muscle cells mixed together with abnormal thickwalled blood vessels, AML is the prototype of the capacity
of PEC to modulate its morphology [29, 76].
For a long time, AML has been considered a hamartoma
rather than a true neoplasm, but, at present, its clonal nature
has been demonstrated [19, 57, 101]. In patients with TSC,
renal AMLs are found in both sexes, in the third and fourth
decades of life, with a female predominance; they are
usually asymptomatic, bilateral, small and multifocal.
Sporadic AMLs occur in older patients, in the fourth to
sixth decades of life, with a female predominance; they are
single, unilateral and larger than those associated with TSC
[76]. Classic AML contains more than one cell type; if a
particular cell type predominates, AML is consequently
named (lipoma-like AML or leiomyoma-like AML) [6].

epithelioid cells; H&E ×20
Virchows Arch (2008) 452:119–132 121

Classic AML has a benign outcome. Multifocality and
regional lymph node involvement can occur, and this is
considered to represent a multifocal growth pattern rather
than a metastasis [1, 110]. Three cases of sarcoma
developing in sporadic AML have been reported. Similar
cases have not been described in TSC patients [22, 32, 73].
Both inherited and sporadic AML frequently demonstrates loss of heterozigosity of chromosome 16p (containing the TSC2 locus). The TSC1 gene occasionally shows
loss of heterozigosity [17, 50].
Microscopic angiomyolipomas (so-called microhamartomas) They
are small nodules often present in a kidney with an AML.
They are not homogeneous in appearance and display all
the heterogeneous morphologic aspects of AML; microscopic AMLs do not contain thick-walled blood vessels
[13, 20].
Intraglomerular lesions with similar features of AML have
been reported in patients with and without tuberous
sclerosis and in the TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome, a disease with a deletion disrupting both TSC2 and
PKD1 (autosomal dominant polycystic disease gene) [74].
Cystic angiomyolipoma is a recently described variant of
AML [25, 33]. It is a solid-cystic lesion that, microscopically, is composed of epithelial cysts lined by cuboidal to
hobnail cells, positive for cytokeratin; a compact subepithelial “cambium-like” layer of stromal cells positive for
HMB45, Melan-A, CD10, estrogen and progesterone
receptors and a solid extracystic component with the
morphology of a muscle-predominant (Fig. 5) AML, which
is positive for HMB45, estrogen and progesterone receptors, smooth muscle actin and desmin and which is
associated with irregular blood vessels. Some authors think
that the subepithelial “cambium-like” layer is a manifestation of a mullerian differentiation of PEC. If the epithelial
cysts represent entrapped renal tubular epithelium [33] or
are also related to PEC is unknown.
Only 1 of the 16 cases described to date had a history of
TSC [33].
Epithelioid angiomyolipoma is another recently described
variant of AML. It is composed of purely epithelioid cells
with melanogenesis markers immunoreactivity arranged in
sheets. Both adipocytes and abnormal blood vessels are not
present. The cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells varies from
faintly eosinophilic to clear. Tumor cells can display
considerable nuclear atypia, and necrosis can be present.
This tumor can recur locally and metastasise causing death.
On the basis of histology alone, it is not possible to predict
malignant behaviour in these neoplasms, and further data
are needed to better define it. However, at the present time,
all epithelioid AMLs should be closely followed clinically.
Epithelioid AMLs has been described in patient with or
without evidence of TSC and in the TSC2/PKD1 contiguous gene syndrome.
Loss of heterozigosity of TSC2 have been reported in
some cases of sporadic epithelioid AML [28, 72, 74, 84, 96].
Oncocytoma-like angiomyolipomas are tumors composed of a homogeneous population of HMB45-positive
polygonal cells with strongly eosinophilic cytoplasm. They
have been described in patients with and without TSC.
Recognition of this variant is important because oncocytomas in the same kidney with AMLs have been reported
repeatedly and in patients with TSC oncocytomas seem to
occur more frequently than in general population [75].
Lymphangiomyomatosis of the renal sinus is a plaque-like
mass in the wall of the renal pelvis. All three cases reported
to date also had renal AMLs, but in only one of them
careful postmortem examination of the lungs revealed
pulmonary lymphangiomyomatosis [74, 78].
Bladder and prostate
In 2003, Pan et al. [85, 86] have reported two PEComas of
the genitourinary tract in patients without TSC. Both
tumors were composed of a variable percentage of
epithelioid and spindle cells with clear to granular cytoplasm arranged in nests separated by a vascular stroma.
Neoplastic cells were positive for HMB45 but not for
epithelial markers, vimentin and S100 protein. The prostatic
tumor (Fig. 6) showed a low mitotic activity, coagulative
necrosis and a malignant behaviour, whereas the neoplasm

extracystic component; SM ACT ×10
122 Virchows Arch (2008) 452:119–132

of the bladder (Fig. 7), lacking these histologic findings,
behaved in a benign fashion. Another case of primary
PEComa of the bladder has recently been described; also in
this case, the patient is well and alive at 48 months after
surgery [90].
Finally, Weinreb et al. [120] have recently described a case
of PEComa of the urachal cyst composed of pleomorphic
cells and containing necrosis and a high mitotic activity. In
this case, they also found a peculiar aspect that they named
“pecosis”: remote from the tumor, there were isolated
capillaries surrounded by a single layer of clear cells.
Uterus
The first case of PEC tumor of the uterus was reported by
Pea et al. [95]: it was a polypoid neoplasm involving the
endometrium, which showed morphological features overlapping those of the CCST of the lung (Fig. 8).
Vang and Kempson [115] described eight cases of
uterine PEC tumor (“PEComa”). They distinguished a
morphologic spectrum of neoplasms varying from tumors
with a tongue-like growth pattern composed of sheets of
HMB45-positive clear epithelioid cells, which they called
group A, to circumscribed tumors composed of hyalinized
stroma and neoplastic cells focally positive for HMB45 and
extensively immunoreactive for actin and desmin, which
they refer to as group B. In two of these eight cases, pelvic
lymph nodes contained lymphangiomyomatosis.
Lesions considered to be uterine involvement of lymphangioleiomyomatosis are usually asymptomatic, and
some of them correspond to an incidental finding in
patients with TSC.
PEComas of the uterus have usually shown benign
behaviour, but 13 tumors, 2 of them associated with TSC,
were aggressive [16]. In two of six uterine PEComas
described by Folpe et al. [39], patients have metastases and
one of six patients died of PEComa.
Fadare et al. [31] described a case of uterine PEComa in
a patient with TSC in which there was intra-abdominal
“PEComatosis”: surgeon found small foci of epithelioid
cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine, myometrium and ovarian hilum.
Ovary, vulva and vagina
A tumor with a strong and diffuse HMB45 expression
morphologically corresponding to an epithelioid angiomyolipoma has been reported in the ovary [4].
Tazelaar et al. [111] reported a case described as primary
extrapulmonary clear-cell “sugar” tumor of the vulva.

Virchows Arch (2008) 452:119–132 123

Finally, cases of vaginal PEComa have also been
described [39, 83].
Lung
PEComas of the lung include lymphangioleiomyomatosis
and clear-cell “sugar” tumor.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) (Fig. 9) is a rare and
progressive disease that affects the lungs of women, usually
in premenopausal age; occasionally, it can be extrapulmonary (as described above). It consists of a nodular, often
widespread and bilateral interstitial proliferation of HMB45,
actin and desmin-positive smooth muscle cells which can
vary from small spindle-shaped cells to large epithelioid
cells, usually arranged around thin-walled, branching vascular channels; this proliferation is associated with dilated
lymphatics and cystic changes [9, 11, 18, 113].
LAM is usually sporadic; patients with TSC are
frequently afflicted.
In many cases of LAM, there is a slow progression to
pulmonary failure, and the only therapy is lung transplantation. In no-transplanted patient, there is a median survival
of 8–10 years [113].
CCST (Fig. 10) was originally described in the lung [68].
It is a rare and benign neoplasm composed of a uniform
population of round-to-polygonal epithelioid cells, with a
clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm and well-defined cell
borders. Tumor cells are surrounded by prominent and
thin-walled vascular channels. CCST has a nested or
alveolar appearance. We have also observed adipocytic
cells in a few cases of CCST [12]. Tumor cells are positive
for HMB45 (Fig. 11) [12, 41, 93].
Pulmonary CCST is rarely associated with TSC [35]; in
the vast majority of cases, it is a sporadic lesion.
Pancreas
PEComa of the pancreas was reported for the first time in
1996 by Zamboni et al. [125]. It was actually the first time
that the very term PEC was introduced (Fig. 12).
The paper reported a tumor with overlapping features of
the “benign clear-cell sugar tumor of the lung”. This
finding was in our opinion consistent with the hypothesis
that similar tumors could possibly arise in many if not all
locations.
Fig. 10 Pulmonary clear-cell “sugar” tumor composed of epithelioid
cells with a clear cytoplasm and well-defined cell borders. A
prominent vascular channel is present; H&E ×10

124 Virchows Arch (2008) 452:119–132

Thus the term PEComa was introduced to include all
similar lesions arising outside the lung. At the time, we
believed this to be a unique case. However, in the following
years we have observed other two cases of PEComa of the
pancreas with overlapping morphological, phenotypical and
clinical features.
Thus, while still a very rare disease of the pancreas,
PEComa is not an extraordinary finding in this location.
The clinical aspects of PEComa of the pancreas are
interesting because they are discovered incidentally during
echography of the abdomen and then investigated usually
with cyto-aspiration. The observation of clear epithelioid
cells can understandably lead to the wrong diagnosis of
clear-cell carcinoma of the pancreas and thus lead to
duodenocephalopancreasectomy.
A primary angiomyolipoma of the pancreas has also
been described. It was a cephalopancreatic nodule in a nonTSC woman [51].
Liver
Apart from kidney, liver is the most likely organ involved by
angiomyolipoma (Fig. 13), either classic or epithelioid [44,
114, 118]. Frequently, hepatic AML shows a prominent
component of large epithelioid cells [114]. There has also
been described a case of CCST of the common bile duct [98].
Other sites
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis has also been reported in
extrapulmonary sites including mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, soft tissue of the mesentery and the renal
sinus, as previously described. Usually, extrapulmonary
LAM presents as a localized well-circumscribed mass
called “lymphangiomyoma” [78].
Apart from kidney and liver, classic or even epithelioid
angiomyolipoma can occur in different visceral and somatic
sites as gastrointestinal tract, pelvis [14, 34, 47], nasal
cavity [7], soft tissues [49] retroperitoneum [63], bone [53]
and orbit [54].
Clear-cell “sugar” tumor has been described in a
variety of extrapulmonary sites, apart from uterus and
pancreas: skin [26], soft tissues [40], breast [45], skull base
[66], gastrointestinal tract [8, 111], inter-atrial cardiac
septum [111] and oral mucosa [61].
Clear-cell myomelanocytic tumour of the falciform
ligament/ligamentum teres (CCMMT) is a PEComa showing predominantly spindled cell morphology.
It has been first described in 2000 by Folpe et al. [36] who
presented seven cases of PEComa arising in the abdomen.
All patients but one were women ranging from 3 to 21years
of age. These neoplasms were composed of spindle cells
arranged in fascicles and nests, positive for HMB45 and, in
three cases, also for Melan-A, microophtalmia transcription
factor (Mitf) and actin. Also in these cases, premelanosomes were ultrastructurally detected. At follow-up, in one
patient presumed lung metastasis developed.
CCMMT has also been described in thigh [38] and in the
skin [79].
PEComa: the future
PEComas are a group of ubiquitous neoplasms sharing
morphological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and
genetic distinctive features.
There are some open questions about PEComas: the
histogenesis and the normal/physiological counterpart of

PEC, the definition of epithelioid AML and the identification of the histological criteria of malignancy.
The histogenesis and the normal/physiological counterpart of PEC are unknown, but some hypotheses have been
proposed. One hypothesis is that PEC derives from
undifferentiated cells of the neural crest that can express
dual smooth muscle and melanocytic phenotype; a second
hypothesis is that PEC has a myoblastic, smooth muscle
origin with a molecular alteration that brings to expression
of melanogenesis and melanocytic markers [107]; a third
hypothesis is that PEC has a pericytic origin. As regards
PEComa’s histogenesis, the involvement of TSC pathway
in these neoplasms can suggest some possibilities: it has
been previously proposed that B-raf activity in cells lacking
TSC2 may play a role in cell differentiation [56]. Moreover,
TSC pathway regulates negatively Wnt/beta-catenin pathway [71] and beta-catenin regulates transcription of genes
involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Nevertheless, more cases should be analysed to better understand
PEC origin and PEComa’s histogenesis.
The second issue regarding PEComas is which cases should
be classified as epithelioid AML particularly in the kidney and
liver, where AML occurs with higher frequency. We defined
epithelioid AML as a neoplasm composed of purely epithelioid
cells with melanogenesis markers immunoreactivity arranged
in sheets, without adipocytes and abnormal blood vessels.
However, in otherwise classic AML, areas of epithelioid
cells can be observed, raising the question how much they
should be represented to call a tumor“epithelioid angiomyolipoma”. The collection of such cases and a consensus
meeting could be useful tools to answer to this problem.
Malignant PEComa can be a very aggressive disease
leading to multiple metastases and death as expected with a
high-grade sarcoma [3, 14, 16, 32, 39, 52, 66, 67, 70, 85, 96,

99, 109, 121, 124]. A few malignant PEComas metastasised
after several years (7–9 years) [27, 73, 89, 100] (Table 1).
Recently, Folpe et al. [39] reported 26 cases of PEComas
of soft tissue and gynaecologic origin proposing criteria for
the classification of these tumors as “benign”, “of uncertain
malignant potential” and “malignant”. In this study, they
observed a significant association between tumor size
>5cm, infiltrative growth pattern, high nuclear grade,
necrosis and mitotic activity >1/50 HPF and subsequent
aggressive clinical behaviour of PEComas.
We think that this approach is the best available at the
moment. While more cases with long follow-up are needed
to verify the effectiveness of this prognostic classification,
we believe that all cases of PEComa should be classified
according to the criteria proposed by Folpe et al.
Another future challenge regarding PEComas is their
management.
Surgery seems to be the only approach for aggressive
cases, as chemio- and radiotherapy has not shown significant results. However, this derives from anecdotical cases
as no therapeutic trial has so far been implemented. There
are obvious difficulties to perform a therapeutic trial mainly
due to the rarity of the disease. An international cooperative
study is needed to address this problem.
A very different problem is posed by lymphangioleyomyomatosis. In fact, lymphangioleyomyomatosis is composed of a
population of cells with no atypia. Mitotic activity is virtually
absent or extremely low. In spite of this, the disease usually
progresses inexorably towards lung-function impairment.
Recently, Kenerson et al. [59] demonstrated TSC1/2
inactivation and m-TOR hyperactivation in non-TSC AMLs
and in extrarenal PEComas using immunohistochemistry
and Western blot analysis. In particular, m-TOR hyperactivation can be studied in such lesions using immunohistochemical detection of p70S6K. As we have previously
mentioned, p70S6K is a protein kinase activated by mTOR. Immunohistochemical reaction for p70S6K can stain
both p70S6K, which gives a cytoplasmic signal (Fig. 14),
and a second isoform of kinase, p85S6K, which is also
activated by m-TOR and which gives a nuclear signal.
Rapamycin is a specific inhibitor of m-TOR [23] which
is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for
immunosuppression therapy after renal transplant [117],
and it has recently been approved also for therapy of renal
cell carcinomas and acute myeloid leukemia [88, 97].
Preclinical studies in animal models of TSC have shown
significant in vivo response to rapamycin [58, 65].
As regards LAM, an innovative therapeutic trial is under
way. Rapamycin seems to block signaling through the Akt
cell growth and survival pathway (for up-to-date information, see http://www.thelamfoundation.org).
A similar trial has already shown a positive effect on renal
AML, and we can hope to see the same effect on LAM.
If this will be the case, this could provide the rationale for
the use of the same drug in other lesions composed of PECs.
