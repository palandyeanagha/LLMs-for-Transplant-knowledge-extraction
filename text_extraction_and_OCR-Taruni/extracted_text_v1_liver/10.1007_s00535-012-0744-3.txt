Abstract Recently, IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) has
been recognized as a novel clinical entity with multiorgan
involvement and unknown origin, associated with abundant
infiltration of IgG4-positive cells. The Japanese research
committee, supported by the Ministry of Health, Labor and
Welfare of Japan, unified many synonyms for these conditions to the term ‘‘IgG4-RD’’ in 2009. The international
symposium on IgG4-RD endorsed the comprehensive
nomenclature as IgG4-RD, and proposed the individual
nomenclatures for each organ system manifestations in
2011. Although the criteria for diagnosing IgG4-RD have
not yet been established, proposals include the International Pathological Consensus (IPC) and the Comprehensive Diagnostic Criteria (CDC) for IgG4-RD for general
use, and several organ-specific criteria for organ-specialized physicians, e.g., the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria (ICDC) and the revised clinical diagnostic
criteria in 2011 by the Japan Pancreas Society (JPS-2011)
for type1 AIP; the Clinical Diagnostic Criteria 2012 for
IgG4-sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC-2012); the diagnostic criteria for IgG4-positive Mikulicz’s disease by the
Japanese Society for Sjogren’s syndrome; and diagnostic
criteria for IgG4-related kidney disease by the Japanese
Society of Nephrology. In cases of probable or possible
IgG4-RD diagnosed by the CDC, organ-specific diagnostic
criteria should be concurrently used according to a diagnosis algorithm for IgG4-RD, with referral to a specialist.

The history of IgG4-related disease:
before and after discovery of IgG4
Recently, IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) has been recognized as a novel clinical entity with multiorgan
involvement and an unknown origin, associated with
abundant infiltration of IgG4-positive cells [1–8]. IgG4-RD
has been found to affect the pancreas [9, 10], bile duct [10,
11], lacrimal glands [10, 12], salivary glands [10, 12],
central nervous system [10, 13, 14], thyroid [10, 15, 16],

lungs [10, 17, 18], liver [10, 19, 20], gastrointestinal tract
[10, 21–24], kidney [10, 25, 26], prostate [10, 27, 28],
retroperitoneum [10, 29], arteries [10, 30], lymph nodes
[10, 31], skin [10, 32], and breast [10, 33]. However, before
the disease was identified, each organ lesion was described
independently.
In 1892, Mikulicz et al. [34] first observed a patient with
symmetrical swelling of the lachrymal, parotid and submandibular glands, with massive infiltration of mononuclear cells. The condition was called Mikulicz’s disease
(MD); however, it has since been classified as an atypical
type of Sjo¨gren’s syndrome, which also presents with
bilateral, painless, and symmetrical swelling of the lachrymal, parotid, and submandibular glands. Ku¨ttner [35]
reported a tumor-like enlargement of the submandibular
gland that was sometimes a result of stones in the Wharton
duct, which indicated that the underlying cause had not
been identified. In 1961, Sarles et al. [36] first observed a
case of particular pancreatitis with hypergammaglobulinemia, a prototype of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). The
concept of AIP was first proposed by Yoshida et al. [37] in
1995. Following the histopathological description of lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP) in 1991,
from the resected pancreas of tumor-forming pancreatitis,
which are clinically difficult to distinguish from pancreatic
cancer, has been regarded as a characteristic histopathological finding of IgG4-related AIP (type 1 AIP) [38]. In
1967, Comings et al. [39] reported the first familiar case of
multifocal fibrosclerosis with retroperitoneal fibrosis,
mediastinal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, Riedel’s thyroiditis, and pseudotumor of the orbit, which is now
regarded as the synonym of IgG4-RD.
Hamano et al. [9] reported increased serum levels of
IgG4 in Japanese patients with AIP, an epoch-making
discovery in the history of IgG4-RD. Thereafter, many
studies of AIP have been reported, mainly by Japanese
investigators. The histopathological findings of LPSP are
characterized by the periductal localization of predominantly CD4 positive T-cells, IgG4-positive plasma cells,
storiform fibrosis with acinar cell atrophy frequently
resulting in stenosis of the main pancreatic duct, and
obliterative fibrosis [10]. About 60–80 percent of patients
with AIP show obstructive jaundice with sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis; IgG4-SC) and
other organ involvement (OOI), in which cholangiographic
features are similar to those of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), pancreatic cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma.
The steroid responses and the prognoses of sclerosing
cholangitis associated with AIP differ from patients with
PSC, which suggests different pathological conditions. In
2003, Kamisawa et al. [12] suggested that AIP is a systemic sclerosing disease. This was based on findings that
the pancreas and other involved organs have fibrosis with
abundant infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells. This is
similar to the concept of multifocal fibrosclerosis proposed
by Comings et al. [39]. Further histological and clinical
profiling of patients with ‘‘AIP’’ reveals two distinct subtypes, type 1 and type 2 [40, 41]. Type 1 AIP is classified
as a pancreatic manifestation of IgG4-RD, and is probably
a systemic disease with an abnormal immunological process. Type 2 AIP is thought to be a specific pancreatic
disease with granulocytic epithelial lesion (GEL) [42, 43]
and occasional coexistence with ulcerative colitis [41, 44].
Conversely, most patients with MD show elevated
serum levels of IgG4, negative anti-SS-A/Ro or anti-SS-B/
La antibodies, infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells
into the glands, and recovery of secretion with steroid
treatment. The patients with MD often show steroid
responsive OOIs such as AIP, sclerosing cholangitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, enlarged celiac and hilar lymph
nodes, chronic thyroiditis, or interstitial nephritis [1–5, 10].
MD has been considered to be completely different from
Sjo¨gren’s syndrome because of this, and because of its
responsiveness to steroid treatment [1–5, 10].
In addition to the original concept of multifocal idiopathic fibrosclerosis, recent studies led us to develop a
novel concept of a systemic disease such as IgG4-related
systemic sclerosing disease [1], systemic IgG4-related
plasmacytic syndrome (SIPS) [2], or IgG4-positive multiorgan lymphoproliferative syndrome (IgG4-MOLPS) [3],
all of which may refer to the same conditions. Based on
these findings, the members of the Japanese Research
Committees for ‘‘Systemic IgG4-related Sclerosing Disease’’ (chaired by Professor Okazaki) and ‘‘IgG4-MOLPS’’
(chaired by Professor Umehara), both of which were supported by the Research for Intractable Disease Program
from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan,
have agreed that the comprehensive term ‘‘IgG4-related
disease IgG4-RD)’’ includes these conditions at a minimum, although pathogenesis and pathophysiology remain
unclear [4, 5]. The first International Symposium on IgG4-
RD held in Boston (chaired by Professor Stone of Massachusetts General Hospital) endorsed the Japanese concept
and proposed nomenclatures and pathological criteria for
individual organ lesions [6, 7] (Tables 1, 2, 3).
Current concepts of IgG4-RD
General concept of IgG4-RD
Patients with IgG4-RD show diffuse or focal organ
enlargement and mass-forming or nodular/thickened
lesions in various organs, either synchronously or metachronously. This is due to the prominent infiltration of
lymphocytes and plasmacytes with fibrosis [4]. The causes

of the disease are still not clear; however, some abnormal
immunological mechanisms are involved. The organs
known to be affected include the pancreas, biliary duct,
lacrimal/salivary glands, retroperitoneum, central nervous
system, thyroid gland, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tracts,
kidneys, prostate gland, and lymph nodes [21–41]. IgG4-
RD mainly affects middle-aged to elderly men, and clinical
symptoms vary depending on the organ in which the
lesions are located. Many cases are treated effectively by
steroid therapy [1–10]; however, the prognosis is not
clear. Some patients develop serious complications such
as obstructive jaundice due to hepatic, gallbladder, or

pancreatic lesions; hydronephrosis due to retroperitoneal
fibrosis; or respiratory symptoms due to pulmonary lesions
[1–10, 25, 26, 29, 45–47]. Although the infiltration of
IgG4-positive cells and increased serum levels of IgG4 are
characteristic in IgG4-RD, the severity of fibrosis seems to
be different among the individual organs involved. These
conditions are quite similar to multifocal idiopathic fibrosclerosis [39]. Storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis
are characteristic in pancreatic and biliary tract lesions, but
the degree varies depending on the individual organs. For
example, very seldom do lesions appear in the lachrymal/
salivary gland or lymph node. The previous nomenclature
of ‘‘IgG4-related sclerosing disease’’ is mainly based on the
fibrous swollen organs, whereas those of ‘‘IgG4-SIPS’’ and
‘‘IgG4? MOLPS’’ have been based on lymphoplasmacytic
proliferation and swollen lymph nodes without fibrosis.
Although most patients have multiorgan lesions synchronously or metachronously, about 10–20 percent of the
patients do not have confirmed OOI. Therefore, it is
unclear whether the pathogenetic mechanism is same
among individual organs or not.
Concept of IgG4-RD in the hepato-bilio-pancreatic
system
Type 1 AIP (IgG4-related pancreatitis)
Recent studies have suggested that AIP manifests as two
distinct subtypes, type 1 and type 2 [40, 41]. In type 1 AIP,
the histologic description is called lymphoplasmacytic
sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP) and the pancreatic histopathology shows the following characteristic features:
(i) abundant infiltration of plasma cells (greater than 10
IgG4? cells per high power field (hpf) and an IgG4 to IgG
ratio greater than 40 percent) and lymphocytes; (ii) peculiar
storiform or swirling fibrosis; and (iii) perivenular infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells often leading to
obliterative phlebitis.
Type 2 AIP was proposed by American and European
pathologists based on histological examination of the
resected pancreases from patients with chronic non-alcoholic pancreatitis. These pathologists reported another
histopathological pattern, which they named idiopathic
duct-centric pancreatitis (IDCP) or AIP with granulocytic
epithelial lesion (GEL) [41–43]. The most characteristic
feature of type 2 AIP is the granulocytic epithelial lesion
(GEL), which often presents with destruction and obliteration of the pancreatic duct. Type 2 AIP includes swelling
of the pancreas, but no or very few IgG4-positive plasma
cells. Type 2 AIP clinical features show a distinctly
different profile associated with no serum IgG4, IgG
elevation, presence of autoantibodies, or other organ
involvement.
IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC)
IgG4-SC is a characteristic type of sclerosing cholangitis
with dense infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and
extensive fibrosis in the bile duct wall [48]. Circular and
symmetrical thickening of the bile duct wall is observed
not only in the stenotic areas but also in the areas without
stenosis that appear normal in the cholangiogram [49].
IgG4-SC related OOI such as IgG4-related dacryoadenitis
or sialadenitis or IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis is
frequently associated with type 1 AIP [50–54] The differential diagnosis of IgG4-SC from PSC and cholangiocarcinoma is very important. It is also necessary to rule out
secondary sclerosing cholangitis caused by diseases with
obvious pathogenesis.
Nomenclatures of individual organ manifestation
of IgG4-RD
Because multiorgan involvements may occur in IgG4-RD
as described above, IgG4-RD includes a wide variety of
diseases, including MD, AIP, hypophysitis, Riedel thyroiditis, interstitial pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis,
prostatitis, lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal fibrosis,
inflammatory aortic aneurysm, and inflammatory pseudotumor [1–10]. In the International Symposium on IgG4-
RD, the nomenclature of individual organ manifestations of
IgG4-RD were proposed (Table 2) using ‘‘IgG4-related’’ as
a modifier, except for the pancreatic manifestation [7]. The
pancreatic manifestation of IgG4-RD was termed ‘‘type 1
autoimmune pancreatitis (IgG4-related pancreatitis).’’ The
term ‘‘type 1 AIP’’ is now widely accepted among gastroenterologists and pancreatic surgeons. It also serves to
discriminate between type 1 and type 2 AIP, which is not a

IgG4-RD and the minimal criteria in a new organ/site in the international pathological consensus (from [6])

1. Phlebitis without obliteration of the lumen
2. Increased numbers of eosinophils

part of the IgG4-RD spectrum. When the pathogenesis of
type 2 AIP is clarified, the term ‘‘type 1 AIP’’ might be
replaced by ‘‘IgG4-related pancreatitis.’’ In the biliary
manifestation, the nomenclature for IgG4-related biliary
tract (but not gall bladder) disease includes ‘‘sclerosing’’ to
distinguish between the primary and IgG4-related forms of
sclerosing cholangitis.
Clinical diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD
International pathological consensus criteria
for IgG4-RD
To diagnose IgG4-RD, histopathological findings are critical, and the international histological consensus criteria
(IPC) (Table 3) have been proposed [6]. There are three
major histopathological features associated with IgG4-RD:
(i) dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration; (ii) fibrosis,
arranged at least focally in a storiform pattern; and (iii)
obliterative phlebitis. Other minor histopathological features associated with IgG4-RD are phlebitis without
obliteration of the lumen and increased numbers of eosinophils. IgG4-positive plasma cells are ubiquitous in diverse
localised non-specific chronic inflammatory conditions and
need to be distinguished from IgG4-related systemic disorders [55]. Therefore, different numbers of IgG4-positive
cells among individual organ lesions were required for
diagnosing IgG4-RD (Fig. 1). For examples, more than 100
IgG4-positive cells are required in the lacrimal and salivary
gland and lymph node, and more than 200 cells in the skin.
On the other hand, in the liver, bile duct and pancreas,

schema of IgG4-related disease

more than 10 cells by biopsy and 50 cells by surgical
specimen are needed. In order to diagnose involvement of a
new organ or site, it has been recommended that at least
three, but ideally four, of the following criteria for IgG4-
RD be met: (i) characteristic histopathological findings of
an elevated concentration of IgG4? plasma cells and elevated IgG4 to IgG ratio; (ii) high serum IgG4 concentrations; (iii) effective response to glucocorticoid therapy; and
(iv) other organ involvement that is consistent with IgG4-
RD. Appropriate histopathologic findings are essential, but
not sufficient, to establish a new manifestation or site of
IgG4-RD, so a combination of clinical manifestations,
including serum IgG4 levels and histological findings, are
necessary.
Japanese comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD
The Japanese comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4-
RD [5] (Table 4) are based on two major characteristics of
IgG4-RD: increased serum concentrations of IgG4 and
infiltration of IgG4? cells into the affected organ. The
cutoff value for serum IgG4 concentration, 135 mg/dl, is
the same as that in AIP [9]. Although tissue biopsies are
difficult to obtain from some organs, including the pancreas, retroperitoneum, and ocular cavity, histopathological
examination is required. Pathological criteria should be
rigorous because IgG4? plasma cell infiltration has been
reported in various diseases and clinical conditions, such as
rheumatoid synovitis, inflammatory oral and skin lesions,
and carcinomas with a peritumoral inflammatory response
[55]. Histopathological findings of marked IgG4? cell
infiltration (concentration of greater than 10 cells per hpg)
and an IgG4/IgG cell ratio of greater than 40 percent are
diagnostic of IgG4-RD.
Diagnostic criteria for individual organ manifestation
of IgG4-RD in hepato-bilio-pancreatic organs
Diagnostic criteria for type1 AIP
International consensus of diagnostic criteria (ICDC)
for type1 AIP
The ICDC for AIP [41] were developed based on previous
criteria, including JPS (2002, 2006) [56, 57], HISORt
(2006, 2009) [58, 59] Korean (2007) [60], Asian (2008)
[61], Mannheim (2009) [62] and Italian (2003, 2009) [63],
and first enabled us to make an independent clinical diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 AIP. The diagnosis of type 1 AIP
by ICDC requires a combination of five primary cardinal
features (Tables 5,6): (i) imaging features of a) pancreatic
parenchyma (on CT/MRI) and b) pancreatic duct (ERCP or
MRCP); (ii) serology (IgG4); (iii) other organ involvement;
(iv) histopathology of the pancreas; and (v) response to
steroid therapy. Each criterion, except for steroid responsiveness, is classified as either level 1 or level 2 collateral
criteria. Level 1 collateral is highly suggestive of AIP.
Patients with obstructive jaundice and a diffusely enlarged
pancreas (especially with a capsule-like rim) without pancreatic ductal dilatation/cutoff or pancreatic low-density
mass on CT/MRI are highly likely to have AIP. However,
subjects with typical findings of pancreatic cancer (e.g.,
low-density mass on contrast-enhanced CT, pancreatic
ductal dilatation/cutoff with or without pancreatic atrophy)
should be considered as having pancreatic cancer. Subjects
without features typical of AIP or pancreatic cancer should
first be investigated for pancreatic cancer. AIP should be
considered only after negative work-up of malignancy.
Response to steroids can confirm a strong suspicion of AIP.
However, a steroid trial as a means to diagnose AIP is to be
used sparingly and should not be used as a substitute for a
thorough search for an etiology.
Clinical diagnostic criteria for AIP by Japan Pancreas
Society in 2011 (JPS-2011)
JPS-2011 [64, 65] (Table 7) took basic concepts from both
the previous Japanese criteria [56, 57] and the CDC for
type 1 AIP [41]. These include ensuring that the criteria are
(i) simple for general physicians’ use; (ii) rely on diffuse/
segmental/focal classification of pancreatic imaging; (iii)
Table 4 Comprehensive clinical diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD
(from [5], with permission)
1. Clinical examination showing characteristic diffuse/localized
swelling or masses in single or multiple organs
2. Hematological examination shows elevated serum IgG4
concentrations(135 mg/dl)
3. Histopathologic examination shows:
(1) Marked lymphocyte and plasmacyte infiltration and fibrosis.
(2) Infiltration of IgG4? plasma cells: ratio of IgG4?/IgG? cells
[40 % and [10 IgG4? plasma cells/HPF
Definite: 1) ? 2) ? 3)
Probable: 1) ? 3)
Possible: 1) ? 2)
However, it is important to differentiate IgG4-RD from malignant
tumors of each organ (e.g., cancer, lymphoma) and similar
diseases (e.g. Sjo¨gren’s syndrome, primary sclerosing
cholangitis, Castleman’s disease, secondary retroperitoneal
fibrosis, Wegener’s granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, Churg–Strauss
syndrome) by additional histopathological examination
Even when patients cannot be diagnosed using the CCD criteria,
they may be diagnosed using organ-specific diagnostic criteria
for IgG4RD.

a. Three or more are observed
b. Two are observed
i) Prominent infiltration and fibrosis of lymphocytes and plasmacytes
ii) Ten or more diffuse IgG4-positive plasmacytes per high-power microscope field
iii) Storiform fibrosis
iv) Obliterative phlebitis
V. Other organ involvement (OOI): sclerosing cholangitis, sclerosing dacryoadenitis/sialoadenitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis
a. Clinical lesions
Extra-pancreatic sclerosing cholangitis, sclerosing dacryoadenitis/sialoadenitis (Mikulicz disease), or retroperitoneal fibrosis can be
diagnosed with clinical and image findings.
b. Pathological lesions
Pathological examination shows characteristic features of sclerosing cholangitis, sclerosing dacryoadenitis/sialoadenitis, or retroperitoneal
fibrosis.
\Option[Effectiveness of steroid therapy
A specialized facility may include in its diagnosis the effectiveness of steroid therapy, once pancreatic or bile duct cancers have been ruled
out. When it is difficult to differentiate from malignant conditions, it is desirable to perform cytological examination using an endoscopic
ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Facile therapeutic diagnosis by steroids should be avoided unless the possibility of
malignant tumor has been ruled out by pathological diagnosis.

JPS-2011, patients are diagnosed as having definitive,
probable, or possible AIP by a combination of the criteria
described. This is similar to the concept of the ICDC.
Although the JPS-2011 is focused on type 1 AIP, some
patients with type 2 AIP, which is extremely rare in
Japan, may be diagnosed as possible AIP using these
criteria. As ERCP is more commonly performed to
diagnose AIP or pancreatic cancer than EUS-FNA in
Japan, ERCP is essentially required in the diagnosis of
the focal/segmental type of AIP. However, to follow the
concept of the ICDC as much as possible, the following
exceptional case can be deemed acceptable only by an
expert: when a patient with a focal/segmental image of
AIP on CT/MRI without ERCP findings fulfills more than
one of III (serum IgG4), IVb (two of pathological findings) and V(a/b) (OOI), he can be diagnosed as possible
AIP only after the negative workup for malignancy by
EUS-FNA and AIP is confirmed as probable by an optional
steroid response.
Diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related sclerosing
cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma
must be discriminated from IgG4-SC. The diagnosis of
IgG4-SC is based on the combination of the following
criteria [66] (Table 8): (i) characteristic biliary imaging
findings; (ii) elevation of serum IgG4 concentrations; (iii)
coexistence of IgG4-RDs except those of the biliary tract;
and (iv) characteristic histopathological features. It is difficult to obtain sufficient biliary tract tissue to determine
the characteristic histology of IgG4-SC by biopsy [67]. Similar
to the ICDC or JPS-2011 diagnostic criteria for AIP, the
effectiveness of steroid therapy is an optional additional diagnostic criterion to confirm an accurate diagnosis of IgG4-SC.
Algorithm for diagnosing IgG4-RD in combination
with the comprehensive and individual organ diagnostic
criteria

Diagnostic items
(1) Biliary tract imaging reveals diffuse or segmental narrowing of
the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile duct associated with the
thickening of bile duct wall
(2) Hematological examination shows elevated serum IgG4
concentrations (C135 mg/dl)
(3) Coexistence of autoimmune pancreatitis, IgG4-related
dacryoadenitis/sialadenitis, or IgG4-related retroperitoneal
fibrosis
(4) Histopathological examination shows:
a. Marked lymphocytic and plasmacyte infiltration and fibrosis
b. Infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells:[10 IgG4-positive
plasma cells/HPF
c. Storiform fibrosis
d. Obliterative phlebitis
\Option[effectiveness of steroid therapy
A specialized facility, in which detailed examinations such as
endoscopic biliary biopsy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine
needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) can be administered, may include
in its diagnosis the effectiveness of steroid therapy, once
pancreatic or biliary cancers have been ruled out.

It is necessary to exclude PSC, malignant diseases such as pancreatic
or biliary cancers, and secondary sclerosing cholangitis caused by the
diseases with obvious pathogenesis. When it is difficult to differentiate from malignant conditions, a patient must not be treated with
facile steroid therapy, but should be referred to a specialized medical
facility

specific criteria, is shown in Fig. 2. Table 9 shows a
comparison of minimal pathological criteria, comprehensive diagnostic criteria, and individual specific criteria in the hepato-bilio-pancreatic system for IgG4-RD.
A diagnosis of IgG4-RD is definitive in patients with:
(i) organ enlargement, mass or nodular lesions, or organ
dysfunction; (ii) a serum IgG4 concentration of 135 mg/dl
or higher; and (iii) histopathological findings of greater
than 10 IgG4 cells per HPF and an IgG4?/IgG? cell
ratio greater than 40 percent. A diagnosis of IgG4-RD is
possible in patients who fulfill criteria (i) and (ii),
but with negative results on histopathology or without
histopathologic examination, whereas a diagnosis of
IgG4-RD is probable in patients with organ involvement
(i) and fulfilled histopathologic criteria (iii), but without
increased serum IgG4 concentration (ii). Patients with
organ symptoms but without satisfying serologic or
histopathologic criteria are considered unlikely to have
IgG4-RD. For possible or probable cases, organ-specific
criteria for IgG4-RD could be applied, such as those
for AIP [41, 56, 64, 65], MD [68], and KD [69] associated with IgG4. Patients who fulfill the organ-specific
criteria for IgG4-RD have a definite diagnosis of this
disease.
Conclusion
Current concepts and clinical diagnostic criteria for IgG4-
RD and individual organ manifestations are mentioned.
The Comprehensive Diagnostic Criteria for IgG4-RD have
been proposed for the general and specific criteria for
individual organs. It is recommended that in cases of
probable or possible IgG4-RD diagnosed by the CDC,

organ specific diagnostic criteria should be concurrently
used according to the diagnostic algorithm for IgG4-RD in
Japan. When the precise mechanism in the development of
IgG4-RD is clarified, establishment of the clinical diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD should be needed in the near
future.
