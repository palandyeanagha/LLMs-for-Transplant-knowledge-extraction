Abstract Using commercial quantitative assays, quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) has improved
our understanding and management of chronic hepatitis B
(CHB). The HBsAg level is highest in the immune tolerance
phase, starts to decline during the immune clearance phase,
and decreases slowly but progressively after hepatitis B e
antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion. The HBsAg level is
lowest in individuals with an inactive carrier state but
higher in those who develop HBeAg-negative hepatitis. It
has been shown that a reduction of HBsAg by 1 log IU/mL
or more reflects improved host immune control of HBV
infection. A combination of HBsAg \1000 IU/mL and
HBV-DNA \2000 IU/mL can identify a 3-year inactive
state in a genotype D HBeAg-negative carrier population.
In the Asian-Pacific region, where HBV genotypes B and C
are dominant, HBsAg levels of B10–100 IU/mL predict
HBsAg loss over time. As to the prediction of disease progression, low-viremic carriers with HBsAg [1000 IU/mL
have been shown to be at higher risks of HBeAg-negative
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma than those
with HBsAg \1000 IU/mL. Although qHBsAg has been
widely used in CHB patients receiving pegylated interferon
therapy, the HBsAg decline is slow and does not correlate with
HBV-DNA levels during nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC)
therapy. However, a rapid HBsAg decline during NUC therapy may identify patients who will finally clear HBsAg. A 6- to
12-monthly assessment of HBsAg level could be considered
during NUC therapy. Taking these lines of evidence together,
qHBsAg can complement HBV-DNA levels to optimize the
management of CHB patients in our daily clinical practice.

Introduction
Although safe and effective vaccines have been available
for nearly 3 decades, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is
still an important public health problem. The clinical
manifestations of HBV infection range from acute or fulminant hepatitis to various forms of chronic infection,
including an inactive carrier state, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. Hepatitis
B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the hallmark of HBV

infection and was first discovered by Blumberg and his
colleagues, reported in 1968 [2]. Since then, HBsAg has
been used as a marker for the diagnosis of HBV infection.
Being a qualitative test, HBsAg has been used by most
practicing physicians as one of the serological tests to
determine the etiology of hepatitis but not to monitor disease progression in patients with chronic HBV infection. In
clinical practice, physicians used to rely only on serological qualitative or semi-quantitative markers such as HBsAg
and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), as well as liver biochemical tests, to determine the disease phases of HBV
carriers; however, since 2007, the quantification of serum
HBV DNA level has become a useful marker to predict
long-term outcomes of such patients [3]. The recent
introduction of HBsAg quantification has attracted much
attention for its value in being able to stratify the risk of
disease progression and predict treatment response to
antiviral therapy in patients with chronic HBV infection. In
this review article, recent updates on reports of HBsAg
level as a new biomarker to optimize the management of
chronic hepatitis B will be discussed.
Life cycle of HBV and synthesis of HBsAg
Having only 3200 base pairs in its genome, HBV is the
smallest known DNA virus. Figure 1 illustrates the pathway
of HBsAg production in the life cycle of HBV. The replication template of HBV is covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA), which exists in liver and encodes four overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): S for the surface gene, C
for the core gene, P for the polymerase gene, and X for the X
gene [4]. The S and C genes also have up-stream regions
designated pre-S and pre-C. The whole virion, or Dane
particle, is a 42 nm sphere that contains the nucleocapsid and
relaxed circular HBV DNA. HBV DNA is synthesized via
the reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA, which is also
derived from cccDNA. Therefore, cccDNA is the template
for both HBV DNA and HBsAg synthesis, while both
products are derived from different ORFs of cccDNA
(Fig. 1). HBsAg is a glycosylated envelope protein of HBV
virions. There are 3 HBsAg proteins—small (S), medium
(M), and large (L), and they are translated from pre-S1
mRNA and pre-S2/S mRNA, which are transcribed from S
gene of cccDNA. In addition to the HBsAg on the mature
virions, there are large numbers of 2 types of non-infectious
particles in the sera of HBV carriers: spherical particles and
filamentous forms (Fig. 1). Both types of non-infectious
subviral particles are composed of HBsAg. The subviral
particles do not contain the HBV genome but are secreted at
levels far in excess (100–100000 folds) of those of mature
virions. Meanwhile, HBsAg can also be synthesized from
viral sequences that are integrated randomly into the host
genome. Virologically, quantification of serum HBV DNA
merely reflects viral replication activity; however, serum
HBsAg is produced not only from translated messenger
RNAs of transcriptionally active cccDNA but also from
integrated HBV DNA sequences. Thus, compared with HBV
DNA level, HBsAg level provides different but complementary information that may help us understand patients’
infection status more comprehensively.
As to other viral proteins, hepatitis B core antigen
(HBcAg) is the nucleocapsid that encloses the viral DNA.
When peptides derived from HBcAg and possibly others,
such as surface and polymerase proteins, are processed and
expressed on the surfaces of liver cells, apoptosis or
necrosis of HBV-infected hepatocytes may develop and the
virus could be cleared [5].
HBeAg is a circulating peptide derived from the core
gene, then modified and secreted from liver cells. It usually

serves as a marker of active viral replication. The long P
gene encodes the DNA polymerase; however, because viral
replication requires RNA intermediates, the polymerase
also provides HBV’s reverse transcription function. The X
gene encodes the protein that has transactivation activities
on the HBV enhancer in aiding viral replication. The X
protein can also transactivate other cellular genes that may
play a part in hepatocarcinogenesis [5].
Natural history of chronic hepatitis B
In Asia, where HBV infection is hyperendemic, HBV
carriers usually acquire the virus perinatally or in early
childhood by the age of 2 years; therefore, the age of a
given patient can be considered as the duration of infection.
On the basis of interactions between virus and host, the
natural course of Asian patients with chronic HBV infection can be divided into four chronological phases [6, 7]
(Fig. 2). The first is the ‘‘immune tolerance phase’’, which
is characterized by active replication of HBV, positivity for
HBeAg, and normal-to-low alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) levels. The second is the ‘‘immune clearance
phase’’, where HBeAg-positive patients have raised ALT
levels and a decline of HBV DNA level. In the third ‘‘low
replication or residual phase’’, patients lose HBeAg and
gain antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) with remission of liver
disease and are designated as being in an ‘‘inactive carrier
state’’. HBeAg seroconversion (losing HBeAg and gaining
anti-HBe) is a critical landmark event in the natural history
of chronic HBV infection because it usually confers a
favorable clinical outcome [8]. However, about 20–30 %
of inactive carriers may enter a ‘‘reactivation or HBeAgnegative hepatitis phase’’ during follow-up, which is
now recognized as a variant of the immune clearance phase
[9–11]. Previous longitudinal studies have indicated that
HBeAg-negative hepatitis is a major risk factor for subsequent cirrhosis and HCC development [9, 12–14].
Therefore, early identification of at-risk patients and
prompt antiviral treatment are mandatory to prevent or
reduce disease progression. In the meantime, there also
exist chances for HBV carriers to have HBsAg seroclearance or seroconversion, which is closest to the cure for
HBV infection [15].
HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in different phases
of chronic hepatitis B
Several cross-sectional studies have compared HBV DNA
and HBsAg levels among different phases of chronic
hepatitis B (Fig. 2) [16–18]. Although the study populations and HBV genotypes are different, the study results are
comparable. Both HBsAg and HBV DNA levels vary at
different phases of HBV infection but gradually decrease
as HBV carriers become older. The levels are highest in the
initial immune tolerance phase when serum ALT level is
normal with no or minimal hepatitis activity. The levels
become lower during the immune clearance phase and
persistently decrease in those who maintain normal ALT
levels after HBeAg seroconversion. All the above reports
have indicated that the lowest levels of HBsAg and HBV

DNA occur in the inactive carrier state but that the levels
are higher in the reactivation phase or HBeAg-negative
hepatitis stage.
Predictive values of HBsAg and HBV DNA in clinical
outcomes of chronic hepatitis B infection
Considering long-term outcomes of patients with chronic
HBV infection, favorable outcomes include an inactive
carrier state and loss of HBsAg, whereas adverse outcomes
include HBeAg-negative hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC.
Brunetto et al. [19] first studied whether serum HBsAg
levels may contribute to diagnosis of clinical stages in
HBeAg-negative HBV carriers with genotype D infection.
They analyzed 209 untreated and asymptomatic carriers in
Italy and found the combination of single-point quantification of HBsAg (\1000 IU/mL) and HBV-DNA
(\2000 IU/mL) could identify a 3-year inactive state with
94.3 % diagnostic accuracy, 91.1 % sensitivity, 95.4 %
specificity, 87.9 % positive predictive value, and 96.7 %
negative predictive value. Our recent study also confirmed
that a combination of HBsAg (\1000 IU/mL), normal
serum ALT level, and HBV-DNA (\2000 IU/mL) could
identify minimal-risk HBV carriers in Taiwanese patients
with HBV genotype B or C infection (Hepatology, doi:
10.1002/hep.26041).
It is widely accepted that spontaneous clearance of
HBsAg correlates with better clinical outcomes because it
usually indicates disease remission [15, 20–23]. As long as
there is no evidence of liver cirrhosis or HCV/HDV
superinfection, and as long as the subject’s age is
\50 years at the time of HBsAg loss, there is a minimal
risk of HCC development [20]. Previous longitudinal
studies have indicated that the annual rate of HBsAg loss is
approximately 0.4–2.3 %, depending on the subject’s age
and status of liver disease at enrolment [24–30]. However,
it usually needs a large-scale cohort study with a long-term
follow-up to address this issue of HBsAg loss because of its
low incidence rate.
Earlier studies suggested that the HBsAg loss rate was
lowest in HBeAg-positive patients, followed by that in
patients with HBeAg-negative hepatitis, with the loss rate
being highest in inactive carriers [15]. In a longitudinal
study from Taiwan, in which a total of 1965 HBeAg-negative patients with normal ALT levels were enrolled, Chu
et al. [25] reported an annual HBsAg loss rate of 1.15 %.
They found that HBeAg-negative patients with sustained
normal ALT levels were more likely to clear HBsAg than
those with hepatitis relapse. Subsequently, a communitybased large cohort study, Risk Evaluation of Viral Load
Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis
B Virus (REVEAL-HBV), further demonstrated that a
lower HBV DNA level was the major predictor of HBsAg
loss over time [28]. In adult patients with an undetectable
viral load (\60 IU/mL), the annual rate of HBsAg loss was
5.76 %. Compared with patients with an HBV DNA level
of C200000 IU/mL, the hazard ratio (HR) of HBsAg loss
was 15.9 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 9.3–27.2].
Because patients with low viral loads usually have a low
risk of hepatitis relapse, the association between a limited
viral replication and a higher chance of HBsAg loss could
explain why HBsAg loss occurs more frequently in patients
with persistently normal ALT levels.
Our hospital-based cohort study, Study of E Antigen
seRoClearance of Hepatitis B patients (SEARCH-B),
enrolled 390 spontaneous HBeAg seroconverters and
highlighted the impact of the HBsAg level at 1 year postHBeAg seroconversion on subsequent HBsAg loss [29].
During an average follow-up period of 7.4 years, 18
patients cleared HBsAg, with an annual rate of 0.6 %. It
was found that HBsAg level, compared with HBV DNA
level, served as a better predictor of HBsAg loss. Even
in patients with an HBV DNA level of \200 IU/mL at
1 year post-HBeAg seroconversion, an HBsAg level of
\100 IU/mL remained an independent predictor of HBsAg
loss. Although this study shed light on the importance of
HBsAg level, the statistical power was not strong enough
to fully address the relationship between HBsAg level and
HBsAg loss. We therefore conducted another hospitalbased cohort study, Elucidation of Risk fActors for DIsease
Control or Advancement in Taiwanese hEpatitis B carriers
(ERADICATE-B), and enrolled 2688 patients with chronic
hepatitis B infection. We analyzed the data of 688 HBeAgnegative patients who had HBV DNA level\2000 IU/mL
at baseline and were enrolled in the earlier stage of the
study [30]. During a mean follow up of 11.6 years, 130
patients cleared HBsAg, with an annual rate of 1.6 %. We
consistently found that HBsAg level, compared with HBV
DNA level, served as a better predictor of HBsAg loss. In
addition, the annual clearance rate of HBsAg reached 7 %
in patients with an HBsAg level of\10 IU/mL [HR of 13.2
(95 % CI 8.1–21.5) when compared with an HBsAg level
of C1000 IU/mL]. This large-scale study firmly confirmed
the importance of HBsAg level on the development of
HBsAg loss.
In addition to these cohorts, several other studies have
also validated the relationship between HBsAg level and
HBsAg loss (Table 1). A cohort study and a case-control
study from Hong Kong showed a very similar trend: a
lower HBsAg level was associated with a higher chance of
HBsAg loss; HBsAg levels of 100 and 200 IU/mL,
respectively, were their recommended cutoffs [31, 32].
Other studies from Taiwan, including the REVEAL-HBV
cohort study, a pediatric cohort study, and a case-control
study, all had very similar findings [33–35]. Although the
16 J Gastroenterol (2013) 48:13–21
123

recommended cutoffs varied among the different study
populations, all these studies pointed to the main finding
that a lower HBsAg level was closely associated with a
higher likelihood of HBsAg loss over time.
As to the prediction of disease progression, most longitudinal cohort studies have already agreed that chronic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC are sequential complications
of chronic hepatitis B infection [9, 12–14] and HCC is the
most deadly one. Therefore, all the investigators were
looking for the key factors affecting disease progression.
The REVEAL-HBV study is the first cohort study to disclose that the serum HBV DNA level is a major driving
force of adverse clinical outcomes [3, 36]; the authors of
that study found that a higher HBV DNA level was associated with both cirrhosis and HCC development, with a
dose-response relationship in adult HBV carriers. In addition, the risk started to increase when patients had HBV
DNA levels of C2000 IU/mL. This important finding
established the HBV DNA threshold level of 2000 IU/mL
for treating HBV carriers and the use of a level of
\2000 IU/mL for defining inactive HBV carriers [37–39].
When the assay of HBsAg quantification became
available, the association between HBsAg level and HCC
was firstly revealed by the ERADICATE-B cohort [40].
This cohort included 2688 Taiwanese HBV carriers who
had no evidence of cirrhosis at baseline and were treatment-free during the follow-up period. At the beginning,
the study demonstrated that both HBV DNA and HBsAg
levels positively correlated with HCC development. When
these two biomarkers were compared in predicting HCC,
HBV DNA level served as a better predictor in the overall
cohort. However, when the study population was limited to
1068 HBeAg-negative patients with an HBV DNA level of
\2000 IU/mL, in whom HBV DNA level has little impact
in predicting HCC, HBsAg level remained the only viral
risk factor. More specifically, in HBeAg-negative patients
with an HBV DNA level of \2000 IU/mL, there was an
increased HCC risk for an HBsAg level of C1000 versus
\1000 IU/mL with an HR of 5.4 (95 % CI 2.1–14.2). The
10-year cumulative incidence rate of HCC was 0.2 % for
HBeAg-negative patients with an HBV DNA level of
\2000 IU/mL plus an HBsAg level of\1000 IU/mL, and
this rate was similar to the rate of non-HBV and non-HCV
infected patients [41].
It is generally believed that cirrhosis usually results from
an accumulation of extracellular matrix arising from liver
cell injury, and HCC may subsequently emerge in the
setting of cirrhosis [7, 9, 11–14]. If the correlation between
HBsAg level and HCC is true, it is expected to exist consistent relationships between HBsAg level and HBeAgnegative hepatitis as well as cirrhosis development. On the
basis of this hypothesis, we analyzed the 1068 HBeAgnegative patients with low viral loads from the ERADICATE-B study. An HBsAg level of C1000 IU/mL was
noted to be consistently associated with a higher risk of
HBeAg-negative hepatitis and cirrhosis. As opposed to an
HBsAg level of \1000 IU/mL, the HR of HBsAg
C1000 IU/mL was 1.4 (95 % CI 1.1–1.8) for HBeAgnegative hepatitis and 2.2 (95 % CI 1.1–4.2) for cirrhosis
development (Hepatology, doi:10.1002/hep.26041).
Taking all these lines of evidence together, combining
HBV DNA and HBsAg levels could be used to define
‘‘minimal-risk’’ patients with chronic HBV infection. The
term ‘‘inactive carrier’’ was not used in our serial studies,
because its operational criteria included persistently low
levels of ALT and HBV DNA, which are very unlikely to
be used in a large-scale cohort study. With snapshot HBV
DNA and HBsAg levels, it is possible to identify patients
with minimal risk of disease progression in our daily
clinical practice. In fact, the REVEAL-HBV cohort study
also reported a finding very similar to that of the ERADICATE-B cohort study: a lower HBsAg level in patients
with an HBV DNA level of \2000 IU/mL was associated
with a lower risk of HCC [42]. On the basis of these data, it

is believed that HBsAg level helps predict the prognosis of
HBV carriers; however, the following issues need to be
addressed. First, the appropriate HBsAg cutoff level needs
further examination. Second, most of the data have come
from Asia, and it is unclear whether this finding holds true
in Western countries where genotypes A and D prevail and
most patients acquire the infection later in life. If more
lines of evidence can confirm the predictive value of
HBsAg, HBsAg level should be included in the future
development of a risk calculator or nomogram for HBV
carriers and treatment guidelines for chronic hepatitis B
[43, 44].
Decline of HBsAg in natural history of HBV infection
In the natural history of chronic HBV infection, declines of
HBV DNA and HBsAg levels are important milestones
towards good prognosis [40, 45]. Compared to the fluctuation of HBV DNA level and its remarkable decline after
HBeAg seroconversion [29], HBsAg level is more stable
and the decline in HBsAg level is usually slow [16, 29].
The REVEAL-HBV study indicated that HBsAg loss was
preceded by seroclearance of HBV DNA [28]. A recent
study from Hong Kong also showed that patients with an
undetectable HBV DNA level had a more pronounced
reduction of HBsAg levels than those with high HBV DNA
levels [46]. Therefore, although the levels of both markers
decrease over time, the seroclearance of HBV DNA usually
precedes a prominent reduction of HBsAg level. In addition, previous studies have reported that reductions of
HBsAg by 1 log IU/mL [16] and 0.5 log IU/mL [31] are
associated with a higher chance of HBsAg loss. Taken
together, these findings suggest that a rapid reduction of
HBsAg usually follows the seroclearance of HBV DNA
and that such a reduction of HBsAg may lead to a higher
likelihood of HBsAg loss.
Of particular note is that all these longitudinal studies
are coming from Asian countries. Whether these observations hold true for Western patients warrants more studies.
Clinical significance of quantitative HBsAg in chronic
hepatitis B patients with antiviral therapy
Table 2 shows current treatment strategies for chronic
hepatitis B [47]. The therapeutic endpoints for chronic
hepatitis B include sustained suppression of HBV DNA
level, normalization of serum ALT level, histologic
improvement, HBeAg loss or seroconversion for HBeAgpositive patients, and, ideally, HBsAg loss or seroconversion [37–39]. Nowadays, seven approved agents for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis B are as follows. Standard or
pegylated interferon alpha (IFN or Peg-IFN) and five
nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs)–lamivudine, telbivudine,
entecavir, adefovir dipivoxil, and tenofovir disoproxil
furamate. Although we have different agents in clinical
practice, there are only two treatment strategies, immune
control (sustained off-therapy response) and viral control
(maintained on-treatment response).
qHBsAg and Peg-IFN therapy
qHBsAg and Peg-IFN therapy has been comprehensively
reviewed elsewhere [48, 49]. In brief, on Peg-IFN treatment, sustained responders tend to show a greater HBsAg
decline than non-responders. The optimal on-treatment
HBsAg cutoff to predict response in HBeAg-positive
patients may be 20000 IU/ml at week 12 or 24 of therapy
[50, 51]; however, determination of the cutoff needs further
evaluation by prospective studies. In contrast, an absence
of HBsAg decline together with a \2 log reduction in
HBV DNA at week 12 can serve as a futility rule in
HBeAg-negative patients with HBV genotype D infection
[52, 53].
qHBsAg and NUC therapy
The decline of HBsAg during NUC therapy is less pronounced than that during Peg-IFN therapy [54]. In patients
receiving NUCs, the decline of HBsAg appears more
apparent in HBeAg-positive patients than in HBeAg-negative patients [55]. Two large-scale clinical trials have
shown that the reduction of HBsAg is pronounced within
the first year of telbivudine or tenofovir treatment, and that
HBsAg level remains relatively stable thereafter [55, 56].
For HBeAg-negative patients, HBsAg level does not vary
significantly during NUC therapy [55]. Other studies had
similar results [57–59]. Two observational studies including HBeAg-positive patients with entecavir therapy indicated that patients with HBeAg loss/seroconversion had an
early decline of HBsAg levels, while those without HBeAg
loss/seroconversion did not [57, 59]. Although the mechanism of HBsAg decline during NUC therapy is unclear, it
may be hypothesized that the reduction of HBsAg level
reflects a better degree of host immune control against the
virus or even a decrease in the amount of intrahepatic
cccDNA. From a conceptual viewpoint, it is known that
NUC only blocks the reverse transcriptase, which diminishes HBV DNA synthesis but lacks a direct effect on
cccDNA. Therefore, the observation that Peg-IFN produces
a more pronounced HBsAg decline than NUCs do is reasonable, because Peg-IFN can induce apoptosis or necrosis
in HBV-infected hepatocytes. On the other hand, the early
18 J Gastroenterol (2013) 48:13–21
123

decline of HBsAg in patients receiving NUCs may be
attributed to the restoration of the host immune response
against HBV as reflected by the pretreatment ALT level.
Thus, when the effect of the immune reaction diminishes,
such as during the second or third year of NUC treatment,
the decline of HBsAg would be less significant. However,
this speculation does not totally exclude the utility of
NUCs to lower HBsAg level. As we have learned the
lessons from the natural history of HBV infection,
achieving undetectable HBV DNA is essential for lowering
the HBsAg level or even for clearing HBsAg and NUCs are
characterized by their ability to inhibit HBV DNA synthesis to a very low or undetectable level. Furthermore,
most studies of NUCs included patients who had been
receiving the treatment for less than 5 years. Therefore, it
is premature to conclude that NUCs fail to significantly
reduce HBsAg levels over time.
HBsAg loss has been reported during NUC therapy in
HBeAg-positive patients. In HBeAg-positive patients
treated with tenofovir, the rates of HBsAg loss were 3, 6,
and 8 % after 1, 2, and 3 years of therapy, respectively.
Nevertheless, HBsAg loss was not observed in HBeAgnegative patients [55]. The HBsAg loss rates for HBeAgpositive patients treated with entecavir or lamivudine for 2
years were 5 and 3 %, respectively [60]. For HBeAgpositive patients receiving telbivudine and tenofovir therapy, a rapid decline of the HBsAg level during the first year
of therapy was associated with a higher probability of
HBsAg loss [56, 61]. Of note, the correlation between
HBsAg decline and HBsAg loss in NUC users is in line
with what we have observed in the natural history: the
greater the decline of HBsAg, the higher is the chance of
spontaneous HBsAg loss. However, most patients with
NUC-induced HBsAg loss have HBV genotype A or D
infection [55, 56, 60], and the clearance of HBsAg by
NUCs seems very rare in Asian patients with genotype B or
C infection. In other words, it may not be practical to
consider HBsAg loss as the therapeutic endpoint for Asian
HBV carriers. Our recent data derived from the investigation of HBV’s natural history has shown that an HBsAg
level of \1000 IU/mL plus an HBV DNA level of
\2000 IU/mL may determine minimal-risk HBV carriers
[40]. In future, we should evaluate whether a lower HBsAg
level, say\1000 IU/mL at the end of NUC therapy, could
serve as a therapeutic endpoint for such patients with HBV
genotype B or C infection.
Perspectives and conclusions
Although we have understood more about the clinical
utility of quantitative HBsAg in the management of
patients with chronic HBV infection in the past years, there
still exist several unmet medical needs. First, we need more
data, especially cohort studies from Western countries, to
confirm the findings observed in Asian patients. More
importantly, we need to determine an appropriate cutoff to
define minimal-risk HBV carriers, depending on how high
an HCC risk we can tolerate. Second, the role of the
HBsAg level in predicting HCC risk in HBV carriers with
intermediate viral loads (between 2000 and 20000 IU/mL)
remains to be explored. Third, the usefulness of combining
HBsAg and HBV DNA levels for the risk stratification of
HBeAg-negative disease needs further examination.
Finally, more prospective studies are awaited to evaluate
the impact of baseline and on-treatment HBsAg levels on
the identification of responders and non-responders in
patients receiving anti-HBV therapy, especially NUC
therapy.
