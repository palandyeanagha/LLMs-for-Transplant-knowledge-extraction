With the increase in patient and consumer activism
through the late twentieth century and into this century,
patient roles in research evolved into a new model of
research engagement, with patients serving as active advisors and co-leading or leading clinical research. By requiring active engagement of patients and other stakeholders, several government research funders have advanced this model, particularly in Canada, the United
States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Australia. A consortium of individuals from these countries formed a
Multi-Stakeholder Engagement (MuSE) consortium to examine critical issues in engaged research, establish consensus on definitions, and provide guidance for the field,
beginning with an overview of how to involve stakeholders
in health research (Concannon et al. J Gen Intern Med.
2019;34(3):458-463) and continuing here with an examination of definitions of research engagement. The political and advocacy roots of engaged research are reflected in
definitions. Engagement is conceptualized with reference
to research project goals, from informing specific clinical
decisions to informing health-system level decisions. Political and cultural differences across countries are evident. Some of these government funders focus on empirical rather than ethical rationales. In countries with centralized health technology assessment, the link between
societal values and engaged research is explicit. Ethical
rationales for engagement are explicit in most of the published literature on research engagement. Harmonization
of definitions is recommended so that research engagement elements, methods, and outcomes and impacts can
be clearly examined and understood, and so that the field
of research engagement can proceed from a clear conceptual foundation. Specific recommendations for terminology definitions are provided. Placing engaged research on
a continuum from specific clinical decisions to more
global public and social justice concerns clarifies the type
of engaged research, supports appropriate comparisons,
and improves the rigor of engaged research methods. The
results help identify knowledge gaps in this growing field.

INTRODUCTION
The influence of healthcare consumers—mostly
patients—dramatically increased in the late twentieth century.
Activist consumers wielded new influence on healthcare and
health policy across therapeutic areas ranging from cancer to
perinatal care, AIDS, and mental health.1, 2 Increased activism
of citizens in politics and changing views of political power
structures preceded and likely contributed to the rise of patient
activism3 and changes in the patient–clinician relationship. In
the United States (US), direct-to-consumer advertising for
pharmaceuticals altered the information asymmetry that had
been the historical hallmark of patient–clinician interactions.4
Internet search technology increased access to health information for patients, further altering consumer access to health
information.5 The changes in power relationships between
patient and clinician extended to research subjects and researchers. AIDS activists and cancer advocacy organizations
brought attention to clinical treatment access, leading to enhanced “citizen control” in drug regulation, connecting the
consumerist movement to clinical research.6, 7
Through the 1980s and 1990s, action-oriented health and
policy research was increasingly organized into a coherent
field.3,7 This community-based participatory research (CBPR)
movement continues to this day, but in the 1990s participatory
research expanded to include less directly advocacy-focused
clinical research. Rather than change CBPR, this expansion
resulted in a new paradigm for inclusion of patients and others
affected by clinical research. The term “engaged research” is

used here to denote this new paradigm of involving patients in
research activities traditionally handled only by researchers,
with patients serving as advisors to researchers, as consultants
for specific aspects of research design and/or outcomes selection, and/or as co-investigators with responsibility and intellectual contribution equal to that of the trained clinical researchers.
One result of the uptake of the engaged research
model has been formal attention from governmentbased research funders, with funding support for either
voluntary or mandatory inclusion of patients and other
end-users of research. The National Institutes of Health
Research (NIHR) in the UK has advanced engaged
research through formal engagement requirements in
clinical research along with infrastructure to support
public involvement, including for the James Lind Alliance, the NIHR-funded public priority setting organization,8 and for INVOLVE, the NIHR-supported group for
advancing active public involvement in the UK National
Health Service, and public health and social care research.8,9 The Canadian Institutes of Health Research
(CIHR) established the Strategy for Patient Oriented
Research to support engaged research among Canadian
health research awardees.10 The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in the US requires
engaged research in its funding.11 In Australia, the National Health and Medical Research Council established
guidelines for consumer and community involvement in
health research in 2005, with an update in 2016.12
A consortium of individuals from Canada, the US, the UK,
and Australia has formed a Multi-Stakeholder Engagement
(MuSE) Consortium to examine critical issues in engaged
health research, establish consensus on definitions, and provide guidance for the field. MuSE research projects test specific hypotheses but the Consortium’s broader scope is to
study health evidence including primary qualitative and quantitative studies and syntheses of health systems evidence,
health policy evidence, public health evidence, health technology assessment, health economic evidence, and knowledge
translation studies including guidelines.
The MuSE Consortium has as one focus defining research
involvement and all forms it can take. To guide the MuSE
Consortium, we examined definitions of research engagement
and research stakeholders from government-based funders in
these countries and provide recommendations for harmonizing
definitions.
There are three initial distinctions to be made in order to
identify a useful definition of research engagement. Specifically, distinction can be made between (1) patient and clinician
involvement in clinical care, (2) public involvement in setting
broad research priorities at a societal level13,14 distinct from
contributions to specific research projects, and (3) patient
involvement in the conduct of specific research projects. The
last category—patient involvement in specific research
projects—is the focus here. Further distinction needs to be
made between types of involvement. We exclude involvement
solely as research subjects and focus instead on “research
partnership” which entails patient involvement as advisors,
consultants, and/or research team members, including as coinvestigators. We therefore include only those activities from
the summary of stakeholder engagement plans presented by
Concannon et al.15 that relate to specific project work, whether
they are part of “Preparing for Research,” “Conducting Research,” or “Using Research.” The definitions reviewed here
are those relating to involvement of non-researcher patients in
specific research projects.
METHODS
The PCORI Engagement in Health Research Literature Explorer (https://www.pcori.org/literature/engagement-literature;
see online Appendix 1 for search terms and additional details)
was the initial source for material to include in this landscape
review for several reasons. It provides updated surveillance of
research engagement literature from PubMed/MEDLINE and
it provides a categorization of that material by topical focus.
Articles meeting search criteria for inclusion in the Literature
Explorer repository are reviewed and categorized by PCORI
staff into four categories (not mutually exclusive): projectspecific; engagement methods; evaluation; and framework,
editorial, or commentary. This last category captures articles
with conceptual and definitional material relevant to the goals
of this MuSE work. For this work, we selected only those
articles from the Literature Explorer that were categorized as
having a conceptual and definitional focus. Articles in this
category were downloaded from the June 2018 repository for
review and consideration for inclusion in this landscape review. Of the retrieved results, abstracts were reviewed and
those articles addressing research engagement definitions
were retrieved for full review. The reference sections of retrieved articles were searched to identify additional literature
relevant to definitions. In addition, definitions of research
engagement and stakeholders were collected from publicly
available materials from the funders, specifically the funder
websites and relevant materials, limited to those that included
definitions of engagement for each of the four countries represented in MuSE: Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia. LF
was the main reviewer, with JJ serving as the secondary
reviewer.
RESULTS
Of the 277 articles in the category of “framework, editorial,
commentary,” that is, the tagged category that includes articles
with conceptual and definitional material relating to research
engagement, 220 were included as relevant to defining research engagement based on review of the abstracts. Of those,
25 articles contained content relevant to the definitions aim
and were included in this review. The reference sections of
those 25 articles were examined and six additional funder

websites or reports were identified as relevant to the aims here
and were retrieved and reviewed as well.
Definitions of Engaged Research
1. Funding agencies
Definitions of research involvement or engagement collected from publicly available materials of major funders of clinical research in Canada, the UK, the US, and Australia are
examined below. Major research funders refer to the concept
of active research involvement variously as “patient and public
involvement” (NIHR), “patient-oriented research” and “patient engagement” (CIHR), “engaged research” (PCORI),16
and “consumer and public involvement”.
12 See Table 1 for
detailed text of relevant definitions. Key features that emerge
across each of these definitions, the “who, why, how, and
what” are compared in Table 2. Table 3 provides definitions
of stakeholders by funder, relevant for definitions. Finally, the
definitions span a continuum from a focus on interactions
between clinicians and patients, to practice level and health
system level interactions, to a more global focus on population
health, social justice, and societal equity. The continuum provides a useful way to organize and compare across funder
definitions (see Fig. 1).
CIHR. See Table 1 for the CIHR guiding definition. Several
aspects of this definition are of interest. First, it calls out
“patients as partners” as a hallmark of patient-oriented research. Reference is made to “relevant stakeholders,” suggesting that inclusion of patients is required to meet a definition of
patient-oriented research but other non-patient stakeholders
may also be engaged. Second, patient-oriented research addresses priorities important to patients. Third, it incorporates
the goals in the definition, that of improving patient outcomes
as well as applying knowledge to improve healthcare systems
and practices. The CIHR definition emphasizes the public
health rationale of research engagement and reflects the
knowledge translation orientation of the CIHR, a link made
more explicit in the definition of “patient engagement” (see
Table 1). References to equity within a CIHR discussion of the
goals of “patient-oriented research” suggest a link to the goals
of CBPR:
Patient engagement in SPOR: An important goal of
Canada's Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research
(SPOR) is for patients (an overarching term inclusive
of individuals with personal experience of a health
issue and informal caregivers, including family and
friends), researchers, health care providers and
decision-makers to actively collaborate to build a sustainable, accessible and equitable health care system
and bring about positive changes in the health of people living in Canada.
PCORI. The PCORI definition also references the public
health rationale, but more narrowly, with focus on uptake and
use of research results as the ultimate goal (see Table 1). In
distinction with the CIHR definition, while partnership with
patients in production of research is included, it is partnership
with stakeholders generally, and not necessarily patients, that is
required (see Table 2 for comparisons). The rationale and goals
for research engagement include addressing patient priorities,
and like the CIHR definition, the downstream goals include
improving uptake of research. PCORI emphasizes the more
specific and less global goal of improving decision making in
clinical encounters, however. The strategic plan and the definition of engagement maintain the focus on improving decision
making “locally” within the patient/clinician encounter and
within specific health systems, rather than globally:
We seek to fund useful research likely to change practice
and improve patient outcomes... we work to influence research
funded by others to become more useful to patients and other
healthcare decision makers. (https://www.pcori.org/about-us)
The PCORI mission addresses the global goal of improving
healthcare generally, while stressing the specific healthcare
decision focus:
PCORI helps people make informed healthcare decisions, and
improves healthcare delivery and outcomes, by producing and
promoting high-integrity, evidence-based information that
comes from research guided by patients, caregivers, and the
broader healthcare community. (https://www.pcori.org/about-us)
NIHR. See Table 1 for the NIHR definition of “public
involvement in research.” NIHR’s INVOLVE provides the
following additional definitions pertinent to the NIHR:
Involvement – where members of the public are actively involved in research projects and research organisations. Engagement – where information and
knowledge about research is provided and disseminated. Participation – where people take part in a research
study. (https://www.nihr.ac.uk/patients-and-public/)
(see also INVOLVE18)
The term “engagement” therefore means something different in the UK than in other countries. Nonetheless, the concept
of involvement is the UK analog to the engaged research
concept examined here. The NIHR definition of patient and
public involvement (PPI) is similar to the CIHR and PCORI
definitions of engaged research, emphasizing partnership:
An active partnership between patients and the public
and researchers in the research process, rather than the
use of people as ‘subjects’ of research. Patient and
public involvement in research is often defined as
doing research ‘with’ or ‘by’ people who use services
rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them. (http://www.
invo.org.uk/resource-centre/jargon-buster/?letter=P)
JGIM Frank et al.: Defining Research Engagement 309

In material directed at researchers, the NIHR provides guidance that emphasizes involvement across different stages of
research. Like the CIHR definition, the NIHR language indicates that inclusion of patients is required for engagement (see
Table 1).
The mission expressed by INVOLVE is similar to that of
PCORI indicating an ultimate goal of improving “the health,
wellbeing and wealth of the nation”.
18 The rationale for PPI
emphasizes inclusion of patient and public voice in order to
provide contributions distinct from those of researchers and
clinicians. The focus for this PPI definition is on the contributions of engagement to specific research projects rather than to
broader, societal level goals.
Australian National Health and Medical Resource Council.
The Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research19
encourages “Appropriate consumer involvement in research.”
The Australian statement about consumer and community
involvement includes “planning, seeking funding, conducting
the research, and communicating the outcomes.” As with the
Table 1 Definitions of Engaged Research from Four Major Funders
CIHR PCORI NIHR NHMRC
“Patient-oriented research
refers to a continuum of
research that engages
patients as partners,
focusses on patientidentified priorities and
improves patient outcomes. This research,
conducted by multidisciplinary teams in partnership with relevant
stakeholders, aims to apply the knowledge generated to improve healthcare
systems and practices.”
(http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.
ca/e/48413.html). “Patient engagement
occurs when patients
meaningfully and actively
collaborate in the
governance, priority
setting, and conduct of
research, as well as in
summarizing, distributing,
sharing, and applying its
resulting knowledge (i.e.,
the process referred to as
‘knowledge translation’).
It is of vital importance as
engaging patients in
health care research
makes [investments in]
research more accountable
and transparent, provides
new insights that could
lead to innovative
discoveries, and ensures
that research is relevant to
patients’ concerns … ”
(http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.
ca/e/45851.html).
“By ‘engagement in
research’ we refer to the
meaningful involvement
of patients, caregivers,
clinicians, and other
healthcare stakeholders
throughout the research
process—from topic
selection through design
and conduct of research
to dissemination of
results. We believe that
such engagement can
influence research to be
more patient centered,
useful, and trustworthy
and ultimately lead to
greater use and uptake
of research results by
the patient and broader
healthcare community.”
(https://www.pcori.org/
engagement/what-wemean-engagement)
“public involvement in
research … research
being carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ members of the
public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them.
This includes, for
example, working with
research funders to
prioritise research,
offering advice as
members of a project
steering group,
commenting on and
developing research
materials and
undertaking interviews
with research
participants,” (https://
www.nihr.ac.uk/
patients-and-public/).
“ … Involvement is
distinct from
participation in research:
patients and the public
you actively involve are
contributing to the
research process as
advisers and possibly
also as co-researchers.
Researchers and
clinicians may not have
first-hand experience of
the illness, disease or
health condition that
they wish to research.
PPI can therefore provide researchers with
insights into what it is
like to live with a particular disease, illness or
health condition, and
these insights can help
to make health research
more relevant to the
needs of patients, carers
and service users. You
can actively involve patients and the public in
all stages of the research
process including
Prioritisation of studies,
design and management
of studies, data collection and analysis, dissemination of
findings”
17 (p. 5).
“Consumer and community involvement is about
research being carried out with or by consumers
and community members rather than to, about or
for them.”

“Research engagement defined: Much of the policy
discussion in Australia around maximising the benefits
of publicly funded research … has focussed on
measuring research impact. Broadly defined, research
impact is the ‘demonstrable contribution that research
makes to the economy, society, culture, national security,
public policy or services, health, the environment, or
quality of life, beyond contributions to academia.’ This
approach is focussed on the late stages of a research process.
Research engagement, by contrast, is defined as follows:
Engagement describes the interaction between researchers
and research organisations and their larger communities/industries
for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge,
understanding and resources in a context of partnership and
reciprocity.” (https://www.atse.org.au/content/publications/

assessment)

CIHR and NIHR definitions, this encompasses more than just
involvement in a specific research project, but consonant with
the definitions from each of the other major funders examined
here, the Australian definition stresses partnership. An
Australian report on research engagement references broad
societal contributions of engagement, representing a global set
of goals like CIHR and NIHR (see Table 1).
2. In the literature
There is a relationship between literature-derived definitions of engaged research and definitions of funding agencies,
both because the literature is influenced by definitions of
major funders explicitly and implicitly, and because funders
have used literature-based features in assembling their definitions. It is instructive to consider the literature-based definitions separately, however, as they reflect a wider set of views
free of constraints of government-attached funding agencies.
While there are over 200 articles addressing engaged research
definitions from 1995 to present per the search conducted (see
Appendix 1, online), four articles from the last decade provide
particularly important contributions to defining research engagement.20–23 Each can trace their conceptual frame to
Arnstein’s ladder of citizen participation,24 in which a continuum of involvement, from passive to active control, is made
explicit in terms of citizen participation in civic activities. For
example, Goodman and colleagues20 present a stakeholder
engagement classification continuum of non-participation,
symbolic participation, and engaged participation. The last
category (engaged participation) corresponds to Arnstein’s
highest level of active control. They go on to define further
classifications as outreach, education, coordination, cooperation, collaboration, patient-centered, and CBPR.
The framework presented by Tritter22 also captures the intensity grading evident in Arnstein’s ladder, with a distinction
between indirect and direct involvement: the degree to which
mediators are or are not involved between participants and
decisions. The framework also adds distinctions between individual and collective involvement to address individual treatment decisions and system-level care elements. Of particular
relevance to definitions is the distinction between proactive and
reactive involvement. In proactive involvement, participants coproduce decisions or agendas with researchers. Proactive involvement is therefore higher on Arnstein’s ladder, representing
more active control of the work and the interaction with researchers than reactive involvement. As an example, if researchers convene participants to discuss an agenda or specific
research questions determined by the researchers rather than coproducing a research agenda with participants, then this involvement is reactive. The distinction between proactive and
reactive involvement is helpful for understanding definitions of
engagement because of the intensity of partnership the distinction indicates, from a low level of partnership with reactive
involvement to a high level of partnership with proactive involvement. Patient or citizen panels are not automatically partners or co-producers if their role is to “react” to an agenda or a
set of questions brought to them by researchers.
Oliver and colleagues23 present a framework for public
involvement in research that focuses on involvement drivers,
involvement processes, and involvement impacts. All three are
relevant to defining research engagement and distinguishing
between the who, why, and how (see Table 2).
Goodyear-Smith21 provides a useful overview of relevant
terminology and “taxonomical challenges” involved in defining participatory research, action research, participatory action
research, CBPR, and community-academic–partnered participatory research. She notes “The proliferation of terminology
used to describe this research genre requires development of a
robust taxonomy to categorize overlapping concepts where
engagement of end users in the research process is core” (p.
268). While she identifies participant engagement as a philosophy, not a methodology, we categorize it as a philosophical
approach with ethical motivations as well as a research method
with empirical support (see for example Frank et al.11 in which
the ethical imperatives are acknowledged along with empirical
rationale).
DISCUSSION
The field of engaged research has developed from the late
twentieth century through the present, with foundations in

CBPR and political activism. The political and advocacy roots
of engaged research are reflected in definitions of engagement
expressed over the past 10 years and in definitions of stakeholders of engaged research which include communities affected by the research. The unique focus on clinical research,
however, rather than on advocacy as with CBPR, has led to a
distinct set of stakeholders: individuals who are most proximally affected by the clinical research for health decision
making. Engagement itself is conceptualized and defined with
reference to research project goals, from goals designed to
inform very specific clinical decisions, to goals designed to
inform health-system–level decisions. The potential for engaged research to inform policy change is reflected in major
funder definitions, although the definitions vary in terms of
extent to which they emphasize broad public health impact
over impact on specific clinical decisions.
An additional consideration relevant to defining engaged
research is the role of stakeholders. Several funders and many
other researchers use the term “service users” as the target for
engaged research.25,26 The definitions of research engagement
and stakeholders examined here reference the targets as well as
goals of the research.
Warsh13 points to the problematic aspects of grouping “patient” with “public” involvement, as is done explicitly in the
UK with definitions and operationalization of “patient and
public involvement” (see also Fredriksson and Tritter27 on
the importance of distinguishing between them). As Tritter22
notes, involvement can be indirect or direct. Funder definitions
allow for both direct and indirect involvement as well as both
proactive and reactive involvement.
Unlike the definitions of engaged research from the other
major funders, PCORI does not explicitly reference social

stakeholders collaborating in
patient-oriented research, such

of patients can include the

processes and in bringing forward priority issues for research
is integral to patient-oriented

“A broad range of
communities have a stake
in the effectiveness of our
healthcare system. In the
term patient partners, we
include patients who are
representative of the
population of interest in a
particular study, as well as
their family members,
caregivers, and the
organizations that represent
them. Other stakeholder
partners include members
of constituencies based on
professional, rather than
personal, experience. These
can include clinicians,
healthcare purchasers,
payers, industry, hospitals
and other health systems,
policy makers, training
institutions, and
researchers. Some
individuals may fit into
several categories,” (https://
www.pcori.org/
engagement/what-wemean-engagement)
“The term research partner is used to describe
people who get actively involved in research, to the
extent that they are seen by their ‘professional’ colleagues as a partner, rather than someone who
might be consulted occasionally. Partnership
suggests that researchers and service users/carers
have a relationship that involves mutual respect and
equality,” http://www.invo.org.uk/resource-centre/
jargon-buster/) “researcher:”
“Researchers are the people who do the research.
They may do research for a living, and be based in
a university, hospital or other institution, and/or
they may be a service user or carer,” (http://www.
invo.org.uk/resource-centre/jargon-buster/page/2/?
letter=R) “When we use the term ‘public’ we are including
patients, potential patients, carers and people who
use health and social care services as well as people
from organisations that represent people who use
services. Whilst all of us are actual, former or
indeed potential users of health and social care
services, there is an important distinction to be
made between the perspectives of the public and
the perspectives of people who have a professional
role in health and social care services”
(https://www.nihr.ac.uk/patients-and-public/). “The term PPI covers a wide variety of individual
people as well as groups and organisations. … •
People who use, or have used, health or social care
services; • informal (unpaid) carers and family
members; • parents; • members of the general
public; • organisations who represent patients and
users; • patient support groups; • charities that
represent specific health conditions; • individuals
with an interest in the topic being researched.”

Community: “a group of
people sharing a common
interest (e.g. cultural, social,
political, health, economic
interests) but not necessarily
a particular geographic
association. Different types of
communities are likely to
have different perspectives
and approaches to their
involvement in research.” Consumers: “patients and
potential patients, carers, and
people who use health care
services … Collectively,
‘consumers’ and ‘community
members’ may be referred to as ‘the public.”
Stakeholder: “An individual
or group from within or
outside research organisations
with a key interest in
research. This might include
members of consumer
organisations, professional
bodies, government agencies,
non-government
organisations, industry, or research funders as well as
consumers and community
members. Stakeholders can
provide support or expertise
and may influence decisions
about the research and its
findings.”.

justice and equity as a goal of engaged research, although
specific PCORI funding initiatives address health disparities.
The source materials selected for these cross-funder comparisons emphasize definitions. The wider set of materials and
funding programs of any given funder address a wider scope
than that presented here. In addition, the definitions express
proximal goals. More distal goals of clinical research for these
funders converge on global population health. Political as well
as cultural differences in healthcare systems across the countries are likely relevant to understanding between-funder differences, including country-specific health technology assessment processes and goals.
Relative to definitions of engaged research from major
funders, definitions found in the literature from the end of
the last century through the present include more reference to
ethical rationales for engagement. A few related issues likely
account for this difference. While some research funders acknowledge ethical imperatives, as funders of empirical clinical
research the focus is on empirical rather than ethical rationales.
This raises an interesting connection between the role of
government in supporting ethical values through its activities
and the distancing of government funders from wider issues of
values. Political expedience may lead funders to emphasize
focus on tangible rationales and outcomes to avoid entering
contentious discussions of values that should underlie research
funding. Countries with centralized and advanced systems of
health technology assessment, however, have a natural link
between societal values and funded research, and may therefore be less reticent about the link between ethical imperatives
for engagement and the engagement requirement in clinical
research.
The framework for categorizing “drivers, process and impacts” presented by Oliver and colleagues23 is extremely
useful as a guide to selecting engagement models to implement and as a means for evaluating and comparing different
research engagement activities. Categories of stakeholders are
largely similar across major funders and published stakeholder
frameworks, and tracing their placement on a continuum from
research project–specific to more global and public health
connected mirrors the “specific” to “global” continuum observed across definitions of research engagement.
Terms have not been static over the past 15 years, although
there is convergence on conceptual equivalence. Comparing
across the continuum from specific patient/clinician dyad activities to initiatives with social justice aims clarifies the path
forward for defining engagement.
Terminology Recommendations
We recommend harmonization among patients, healthcare
providers, researchers, and funding agencies, mindful of
encouraging continued innovation and diversity in approaches. “Engagement” should be the preferred term for
active involvement as research partners, allowing distinction from research subject “participation.” “Involvement”
includes activities beyond research and should be reserved
for societal level activities such as priority setting and
aiding with research dissemination—activities outside of
participation in specific research projects. “Public involvement” and “consumer involvement” are overly narrow
terms since a range of stakeholders, including those not
identified as members of the non-researcher public, can be
legitimate partners in engaged research. The term “patientoriented research” is too broad to be part of harmonized
terminology, since all clinical research can be considered
patient-oriented. This term also suggests a focus on public
health and applied research. Engaged research can include
basic as well as applied research. “Research engagement”
then should be defined as active partnership between stakeholders and researchers in production of new healthcare
knowledge and evidence. Adoption of these definitions
avoids the challenges posed by the different meanings for
similar terms across funders and researchers.
Given continued development of the field and given the
likelihood that engagement approaches will continue to proliferate, consensus on definitions based on the recommendations here would enable research engagement elements,
methods, and outcomes and impacts to be examined and
understood, moving the field of research engagement forward
from a clear conceptual foundation.
