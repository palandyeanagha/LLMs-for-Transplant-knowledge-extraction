Abstract The adiponutrin (PNPLA3) rs738409 polymorphism has been found to be associated with susceptibility to
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in various
cohorts. We further investigated the association of this
polymorphism with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
severity and with histological features of NAFLD. A total
of 144 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients and 198 controls
were genotyped for PNPLA3 gene polymorphism
(rs738409 C>G). The biopsy specimens were histologically
graded by a qualiWed pathologist. We observed an association of G allele with susceptibility to NAFLD in the pooled
subjects (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.69–3.24, p < 0.0001), and following stratiWcation, in each of the three ethnic subgroups,
namely Chinese, Indian and Malay (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.12–
3.37, p = 0.018; OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.69–7.26, p = 0.001 and
OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.25–3.35, p = 0.005, respectively). The
G allele is associated with susceptibility to NASH (OR
2.64, 95% CI 1.85–3.75, p < 0.0001), with NASH severity
(OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.05–3.26, p = 0.035) and with presence
of Wbrosis (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.17–3.26, p = 0.013) but not
with simple steatosis nor with other histological parameters. Although the serum triglyceride level is signiWcantly
higher in NAFLD patients compared to controls, the G
allele is associated with decreased level of triglycerides
(p = 0.029) in the NAFLD patients. Overall, the rs738409
G allele is associated with severity of NASH and occurence
of Wbrosis in patients with NAFLD.
Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common
cause of chronic liver disease and has emerged as an important global health problem (Adams et al. 2005; Angulo
2002). The reported prevalence of NAFLD in the general
population is as high as 35% (Cheung and Sanyal 2010).
NAFLD is a spectrum ranging from simple steatosis (fat in
the liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH—fat with
inXammation and/or Wbrosis) and cirrhosis (Charlton 2004;
Malaguarnera et al. 2009). NAFLD represents the hepatic
component of the metabolic syndrome and is strongly associated with obesity and insulin resistance (Adams et al.
2009; Bertrand et al. 2011; Fatani et al. 2011; Vanni et al.
2010). Genetic factors have been shown to play a signiWcant role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD (Alisi et al. 2011;
Day 2010; Merriman et al. 2006). A familial aggregation
study comparing overweight children with NAFLD, and
overweight children without NAFLD reported that fatty

liver was more signiWcant in siblings of children with
NAFLD (Schwimmer et al. 2009).
Adiponutrin encoded by PNPLA3 has been reported to
have both lipolytic and lipogenic properties; however, the
exact function of adiponutrin is unknown (Jenkins et al.
2004). A common variant of PNPLA3 gene (rs738409) has
been reported to be associated with hepatic fat content in
the Dallas Heart Study of diVerent ancestries; Hispanics,
European Americans and African-Americans. The Hispanics bear the highest propensity to develop NAFLD followed
by the European Americans with African-Americans being
the group with the lowest risk of NAFLD (Romeo et al.
2008). Since then, several other studies in diVerent populations have been conducted (Cox et al. 2011; Hotta et al.
2010; Kantartzis et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2011; Romeo et al.
2010a, b; Sookoian et al. 2009; Valenti et al. 2010).
A diagnosis of fatty liver can be made clinically, based
on radiological and laboratory Wndings. However, the spectrum of NAFLD, particularly the diagnosis of NASH can
only be conWrmed by liver biopsy (Cortez-Pinto and
Camilo 2004; Serfaty and Lemoine 2008). While most of
the studies have attempted to predict risk of NAFLD, it is
more important to predict the risk of steatohepatitis as it is
potentially progressive (Vuppalanchi and Chalasani 2009).
Recent studies have therefore moved into looking at the
association of PNPLA3 variant with disease severity (Hotta
et al. 2010; Rotman et al. 2010; Sookoian et al. 2009).
The Malaysian population comprises of three major ethnic subgroups, namely the Malays, Chinese and Indians,
each of which are presumably of diVerent genetic pool,
hence presenting a good opportunity to study the ethnic
diVerence of NAFLD susceptibility with regard to PNPLA3
gene polymorphism. In the present study, we investigated
the association of PNPLA3 rs738409 with severity of
NASH and with histological features of NAFLD in the
three major ethnic groups of Malaysian NAFLD patients.
Methods
Study population
The study involved a total of 144 consecutive biopsyproven NAFLD patients and 198 controls without fatty
liver based on histology or ultrasound and normal liver
enzymes. Subjects were recruited from the University
Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). The study protocol was
approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of UMMC.
Informed consent was obtained from all study subjects. Participants with the following criteria were excluded from the
study; current or previous alcohol consumption >10 g/day
(Ruhl and Everhart 2005), hepatitis B or C infection, autoimmune hepatitis, were taking drugs that are known to
cause steatosis, or Wilson’s disease. Cases were patients
who were clinically diagnosed with NAFLD and conWrmed
by liver biopsy. The Brunt system was used for the grading
and staging of the liver histology (Brunt et al. 2011; Kleiner
et al. 2005). Patients with NAFLD were classiWed to three
groups: simple steatosis, NASH without signiWcant Wbrosis
(Wbrosis score of <2) and NASH with signiWcant Wbrosis
(Wbrosis score of 2 or greater). The control group without
fatty liver consists of those with normal BMI (<25 kg/m2
),
normal fasting plasma glucose (<110 mg/dl) and normal
lipid proWle.
Clinical and laboratory assessments
Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and blood
pressure were determined according to standard protocol.
Blood was taken for determination of hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) level in all subjects.
Genotyping
Blood samples obtained from the subjects were centrifuged
at 1,500 rpm for 10 min. The buVy coat layer were separated
and transferred into 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes. Genomic DNA
was extracted from the concentrated lymphocytes of the
buVy coat using the QiAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, German). PNPLA3 rs738409 I148M variant was genotyped using a predesigned Taqman SNP genotyping assay
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on a Step One
Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems). The total
reaction volume for each well was 10 l containing 5 l universal mastermix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 l assay mix,
3.5 l distilled water and 1 l genomic DNA. The plate was
set up at 95°C holding stage for 20 s, 45 cycles of 95°C
denaturation for 3 s and 60°C annealing for 20 s and ran on a
fast reaction (approximately 40 min for each run). Negative
controls were introduced for every run to ensure the genotyping quality.
Statistical
All values were presented as mean § standard deviation for
continuous data and as percentages for categorical data. All
variables were tested for normality using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For normally distributed variables (age, BMI, waist
circumference, ALT, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
total cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure),
Student’s t test was performed to determine the associations
between the NASH and simple steatosis. For skewed vari-

ables—HbA1c, AST, GGT, diastolic blood pressure, steatosis grade, lobular inXammation, ballooning, and Wbrosis—
Mann–Whitney U test was performed. Hardy–Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE) was checked for all the groups using a
goodness-of Wt 2
 test with one degree of freedom. Association of allele was performed using the binary logistic regression. Multiple logistic regression was performed to adjusting
for age, gender and ethnicity. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and Kruskal–Wallis test were conducted for comparison of means between three groups for normally and
non-normally distributed variables, respectively.
Univariate analysis of association of genotypes and histological ordinal variables was assessed using the Jonckheere–Terpstra test. Ordinal regression is performed for
multivariate analysis of histological ordinal variables. To
correct for testing for multiple histological parameters, the
false discovery rate (FDR) was calculated using Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg
1995). For easier interpretation of the results, binary logistic regression was used to obtain the odds ratio. Analyses
were performed using SPSS 16.0 (Chicago IL) and Microsoft Excel, and a p value <0.05 was considered statistically
signiWcant.
We estimated that a sample size of 135 cases and controls would provide 80% power at an  of 0.05 with the following assumptions: the allele frequency ranges from 0.24
to 0.45, the baseline risk for the Malaysian population was
0.17, and the minimum detectable odds ratio was 2.0.
Results
The demographic and clinical data of the NAFLD and control groups are shown in Table 1. The 144 patients consisted of 54 Chinese, 31 Indians, and 59 Malays. Out of the
198 controls, 54 were Chinese, 64 Indians and 80 Malays.
Ethnicity of the subjects was conWrmed by aYrmations of
absence of mixed marriages for at least three generations.
Table 2 shows the demographic and clinical data of the
patients with simple steatosis and with NASH. The BMI,
HbA1c, waist circumference, triglycerides, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure were signiWcantly higher in the
NASH group (p < 0.05) as compared to the simple steatosis
group.
Genotypes and allele frequencies of PNPLA3 rs738409 
polymorphism
The association tests of PNPLA3 rs738409 for the diVerent
NAFLD spectrum are presented in Table 3. The frequency
of the risk allele G is signiWcantly higher in the NASH
(48%) and in the NAFLD (45%) when each is compared to
the control group (24%). The genotype distribution was in
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for all the patients and controls of each ethnic subgroup.
There was a signiWcant association between the risk
allele G and NAFLD in the pooled subjects (OR 2.34, 95%
CI 1.69–3.24, p < 0.0001) as well as after stratiWcation into
the three ethnic subgroups, (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.12–3.37,
p = 0.018; OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.69–7.26, p = 0.001 and OR
2.05, 95% CI 1.25–3.35, p = 0.005, for Chinese, Indian and
Malay, respectively). Following adjustment for age and
gender (include adjustment for ethnicity for pooled subjects), the association between the risk allele G and
NAFLD in the pooled subjects and after stratiWcation into
the three ethnic subgroups remained (OR 2.23, 95% CI
1.60–3.11, p < 0.0001; OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.11–3.36,
p = 0.02; OR 3.50, 95% CI 1.67–7.33, p = 0.001 and OR
2.00, 95% CI 1.21–3.21, p = 0.007, for pooled, Chinese,
Indian and Malay, respectively) (Table 3).
PNPLA3 rs738409 polymorphism and liver histology
The NAFLD patients were then divided into simple steatosis and NASH group following which, association analysis
was performed (Table 3). We showed that the G allele is
associated with NASH (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85–3.75,
p < 0.0001) but not with simple steatosis. We further

stratiWed the NASH patients into two groups: NASH without signiWcant Wbrosis (Wbrosis score <2) and NASH with
signiWcant Wbrosis (Wbrosis score ¸2) and went on to compare these two groups of patients with that of the simple
steatosis group. Results revealed that there is a signiWcant
association in G allele frequency between the NASH group
with signiWcant Wbrosis and that of the simple steatosis
(OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.05–3.26, p = 0.035), and a suggestive
association between the NASH group without signiWcant
Wbrosis and the simple steatosis group.
We investigated the association of PNPLA3 rs738409
with the histological features of NAFLD: steatosis, lobular
inXammation, hepatocellular ballooning and Wbrosis. We
showed that there is signiWcant association between the GG
genotype with Wbrosis stage (p = 0.038) but not with the
other histological features (patients with genotype GG
compared to CC, had mean score 2.03 vs. 1.52) (Table 4).
We further investigated the magnitude of the eVect of the
risk allele G with the histological features. Patients bearing
at least a single risk allele G of rs738409 were more likely
to have a Wbrosis score ¸2 (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.17–3.26,
p = 0.013). The association remains signiWcant after the
adjustment of other histological features (p = 0.012).
However, we did not observe any association between the
risk allele and steatosis, lobular inXammation and hepatocellular ballooning (Table 5).
Analysis of various clinical parameters with PNPLA3
rs738409 genotypes
Next, we compared the clinical parameters between the
PNPLA3 rs738409 genotypes among patients with NAFLD
(Table 4). Patients with GG genotype have a signiWcantly
lower level of plasma triglycerides compared to those with
the CC genotype (p = 0.029). We then compared the levels
of triglyceride between the three groups: simple steatosis,
NASH without signiWcant Wbrosis and NASH with signiWcant Wbrosis (Fig. 1). We observed a signiWcant diVerence
between the three groups (p = 0.002). The triglycerides
level is signiWcantly higher in the NASH group with
(p = 0.006) and without signiWcant Wbrosis (p < 0.0001)
compared to those with simple steatosis. The triglyceride
level is lower in the NASH group with signiWcant Wbrosis
compared to the NASH group without signiWcant Wbrosis,
but this did not achieve statistical signiWcance.
Discussion
In the present study, we conWrm the association of PNPLA3
rs738409 G allele with susceptibility to NAFLD as has
been shown in a recent genome-wide association study
(Romeo et al. 2008). More importantly, we showed a positive association of the risk allele G with risk of NASH and
with Wbrosis stage but not with other histological parameters. Thus, the G allele is not only associated with occurence of NASH, but also with presence of Wbrosis.
The risk allele G was found to be signiWcantly associated
with susceptibility to NAFLD after stratiWcation into the
three major ethnic subgroups, the Chinese, Indian and
Malay. The Malaysian Indians migrated to Malaysia from
Southern India in the 1800s (Periasamy 2007). Studies have
suggested that Indians from India were proto-Asian origin
with West Eurasian admixture, hence giving them the
genetic aYnity towards both Asian and European (Bamshad
et al. 2001; Jorde and Wooding 2004). Compared to the
other ethnic groups, the Malaysian Indians appear to have a
high prevalence of NAFLD as is so with the Caucasians.
The Malaysian Chinese on the other hand, are of the Hans
descendance from Southern China (Hock 2007) and it is
noted that the results of the Chinese subgroup in our study is
consistent with the Wnding in the Taiwanese Hans (Lin et al.
2011) as proven by positive associations in both populations.
Our results are consistent with the results of the previous
studies of diVerent populations including Hispanics (Romeo
et al. 2008), Argentinian (Sookoian et al. 2009), Germans

The present study thus conWrms that the rs738409 plays a
signiWcant role in susceptibility to NAFLD.
We also successfully replicated the Wnding of an association of the PNPLA3 variant with NASH in our population
as was observed in several studies (Hotta et al. 2010;

those with simple steatosis, which is probably reXective of
the patients who are seen at the UMMC, which is a tertiary
referral center.
A novel Wnding in this study is that the G allele is associated with the severity of NASH. Most of the NAFLD
biopsy-proven studies to date only looked at two spectrum
of NAFLD: simple steatosis and NASH (Hotta et al. 2010;
Rotman et al. 2010; Sookoian et al. 2009). Predicting steatohepatitis is more important as NASH can potentially
progress and treatment should be considered at an early
stage of NASH. Compared to those with simple steatosis,
the G allele is signiWcantly higher in patients with NASH
with signiWcant Wbrosis but not in NASH patients without
signiWcant Wbrosis. Furthermore, the G allele frequency in
NASH with signiWcant Wbrosis is higher than that of NASH
without signiWcant Wbrosis. We also revealed that the G
allele is associated with a higher Wbrosis score but not with
the other histological features of NAFLD. The association
of rs738409 G allele with higher Wbrosis score was also
observed in other studies (Hotta et al. 2010; Rotman et al.
2010; Valenti et al. 2010). One Asian study found that the
G allele is associated with Wbrosis score but not with steatosis (Hotta et al. 2010). Our results were in concordance
with that of Hotta et al. (2010), and in addition, there was
no association with lobular inXammation and hepatocellular ballooning.
There have been conXicting reports of the correlation
between presence of G allele and serum transaminase levels
(Hotta et al. 2010; Kotronen et al. 2009; Lin et al. 2011;
Romeo et al. 2008, 2010a, b; Sookoian et al. 2009; Valenti
et al. 2010). The rs738409 G allele was shown to be associated with increased levels of both serum AST and ALT in
the Argentinian (Sookoian et al. 2009), Italian (Romeo
et al. 2010a, b), Japanese (Hotta et al. 2010), and the
Taiwanese (Lin et al. 2011). In the Hispanics (Romeo et al.
2008) and in an Italian population (Valenti et al. 2010), the
G allele was found to be related with increased serum ALT
only. The G allele was found to be associated with
increased serum AST level only in the Finnish population
(Kotronen et al. 2009). However, the serum level of AST/
ALT was found not to be signiWcantly associated with the
G allele in the African-Americans (Cox et al. 2011; Romeo
et al. 2008), European Americans (Romeo et al. 2008),
Germans (Kantartzis et al. 2009), and in the present study.
The diVerences in these Wndings are probably due to the
diVerences in the recruited subjects in the various studies,
ranging from adults with NAFLD (Hotta et al. 2010; Kotronen
et al. 2009; Romeo et al. 2008; Sookoian et al. 2009; Valenti
et al. 2010), either obese or diabetic adults (Kantartzis et al.
2009), obese adults (Romeo et al. 2010b), and obese
children (Lin et al. 2011; Romeo et al. 2010a).
Two studies reported a decreased level of plasma triglycerides in the NAFLD subjects harboring the G allele (Hotta
et al. 2010; Speliotes et al. 2010). This Wnding is in agreement with our study, in which we found decreased level of
plasma triglycerides amongst the NAFLD patients with GG
genotype despite a signiWcantly higher level triglyceride in
the NAFLD patients as compared to controls, suggesting
that genetic susceptibility of G allele plays a much more
important role than triglyceride levels in the pathogenesis
of NAFLD. In the present study, we further analyzed the
triglyceride levels in the NAFLD spectrum. We found that
the triglyceride levels are higher in NASH without signiWcant Wbrosis compared to NASH with signiWcant Wbrosis,
suggesting that the triglyceride level subsides along with
the degree of hepatocellular injury (Jou et al. 2008).
There are several limitations and strengths to this study.
Due to ethical considerations, no liver biopsies were

performed for the controls leading to a possibility of
misclassiWcation of controls. However, this likelihood was
reduced by using the stated selection criteria for the controls. The distribution of BMI, HbA1c, triglycerides, and
liver enzymes in controls reXects this selection criteria. The
causal pathway between rs738409 and NASH has been
postulated to be mediated through triglycerides. As this
study conditions on BMI, the case–control association of
rs738409 and NASH is vulnerable to confounding bias
between the pathway of triglycerides and NASH. Thus,
residual confounding from collider stratiWcation bias due to
conditioning of a downstream covariate might explain
away some of the association between rs738409 and
NASH. However, the associations between rs738409 and
the diVerent grades of NAFLD among the cases are not
likely to be confounded and provide valid estimates. A
major strength of this study was the ability to compare the
association between rs738409 and NAFLD among three
Asian ethnic groups. This study suggests that ethnicity
modiWes the relationship between rs738409 and NAFLD. It
appears that the role of rs738409 on NAFLD is ampliWed
among Indians compared to Chinese and Malays.
In summary, we showed an association between
rs738409 of the PNPLA3 gene and the risk of NAFLD in
the pooled subjects and after stratiWcation into the three ethnic subgroups. The rs738409 G allele was signiWcantly
associated with progression to NASH and Wbrosis.
