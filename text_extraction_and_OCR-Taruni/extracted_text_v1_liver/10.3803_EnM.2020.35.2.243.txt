Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver diseases and can progress to advanced fibrosis and end-stage 
liver disease. Thus, intensive research has been performed to develop noninvasive methods for the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Currently, no single noninvasive tool covers all of the stages of pathologies and conditions of 
NAFLD, and the cost and feasibility of known techniques are also important issues. Blood biomarkers for NAFLD may be useful to 
select subjects who need ultrasonography (US) screening for NAFLD, and noninvasive tools for assessing fibrosis may be helpful to 
exclude the probability of significant fibrosis and to predict advanced fibrosis, thus guiding the decision of whether to perform liver 
biopsy in patients with NAFLD. Among various methods, magnetic resonance-based methods have been shown to perform better 
than other methods in assessing steatosis as well as in detecting hepatic fibrosis. Many genetic markers are associated with the development and progression of NAFLD. Further well-designed studies are needed to determine which biomarker panels, imaging studies, genetic marker panels, or combinations thereof perform well for diagnosing NAFLD, differentiating NASH and fibrosis, and 
following-up NAFLD, respectively.

INTRODUCTION
In parallel with increasing prevalence rates of obesity, metabolic 
syndrome, and diabetes, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing continuously [1]. 
Between 20% and 40% of the adult population is affected by 
NAFLD [2]. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 
the NAFLD prevalence ranges from 70% to 95%, while the rate 
is extremely high in morbid obesity, at up to 98% [2]. In the 
general Korean population, the NAFLD prevalence ranges from 
16.1% to 25.25% [3,4]. The global prevalence of nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is between 1.5% and 6.5% [2]. However, the case definition based on abnormal aminotransferase levels or histological findings can be inaccurate, because a significant proportion of NAFLD subjects have normal liver enzymes 
and liver biopsy is performed only in selected subjects [1,5]. 
Thus, the prevalence of NASH could be as high as 12%, depending on the study design and population [6].
THE DEFINITION OF NAFLD
NALFD encompasses a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis (or nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL]) through 
NASH, to fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis. Although steatosis

can be defined by various clinically available diagnostic tools, it 
can be numerically and strictly defined by assessing liver fat: ≥
5% of fat-containing hepatocytes assessed by light microscopy; 
proton density fat fraction (PDFF) ≥5% by magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), or >5.5% by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1
H-MRS) [7,8]. The histological findings of NAFL 
demonstrate hepatic steatosis without evidence of hepatocellular 
injury (e.g., ballooning of hepatocytes), and NAFL usually follows a benign clinical course. Conversely, the histological findings of NASH are characterized by the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation with distinctive hepatocyte injury (e.g., 
ballooning degeneration), and NASH is considered to be a potentially health-threatening disease that may progress to cirrhosis in 9% to 22% of patients and to hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) as a complication [9,10]. The definitive diagnosis of 
NASH requires a liver biopsy.
IMPLICATIONS OF INTRAHEPATIC 
TRIGLYCERIDE CONTENT
The threshold level of intrahepatic triglyceride (TG) content for 
the definition of NAFLD was based on a relatively small study 
[11]. Interestingly, an elegant study evaluated metabolic and 
histologic implications of intrahepatic TG content in NAFLD 
[12]. The study found that there was a clear threshold of intrahepatic TG content (6%±2%), after which metabolic changes, 
such as muscle insulin resistance (IR), hypertriglyceridemia, 
and decreased plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol were 
already fully established (Table 1) [8,12-14]. This suggests that 
the definition of NAFLD by using MRI may underestimate the 
prevalence of fatty liver. In line with this view, a study reported 
that a cutoff value of 3% on MRI-PDFF may identify more subjects with biopsy-proven steatosis [15]. However, currently 
available and easy-to-perform US-based methods are very insensitive to detect such levels of steatosis [16]. Further, more 
accurate quantification of hepatic fat content by 1H-MRS or 
other magnetic resonance (MR)-based techniques does not predict the severity of histology [12,17]. Although liver biopsy provides an accurate diagnosis in approximately 90% of patients 
with unexplained abnormalities revealed by liver function tests 
[18], not all subjects with NAFLD could be evaluated by histologic study. Thus, noninvasive tools for screening, diagnosing, 
and staging steatosis, NASH, and fibrosis in NAFLD and for 
assessing the progression or regression of the disease are of paramount importance to both patients and their physicians. The 
evaluation of patients with NAFLD should be performed with 
consideration of metabolic and cardiovascular (CV) risk profiles as well as liver injuries including, in particular, hepatic fibrosis [19,20].
THE PROGRESSION OF NAFLD AND THE 
PROGNOSIS IN PATIENTS WITH NAFLD
In two previous studies that followed patients with NAFLD for 
a median of more than 15 years, the major causes of mortality 
were CV diseases (approximately 30%), extrahepatic malignancies (approximately 19%), and liver-related complications (15% 
to 19%) [9,21]. Although liver-related mortality could be higher 
in patients with NASH compared to those without NASH (simple steatosis with or without nonspecific inflammation) with a

longer follow-up [22], there has been a lack of evidence for additional differential risk of all-cause mortality between subgroups of NAFLD patients with simple steatosis or NASH [9, 
21-23]. Hepatic fibrosis is a key independent predictor that is 
associated with all-cause and CV mortality and mortality due to 
cirrhosis, HCC, and infectious diseases in patients with NAFLD 
[22-27]. However, the NAFLD activity score (NAS) for NASH 
was not shown to predict progression of fibrosis or mortality 
[24,25]. Thus, after the diagnosis of NAFLD, the stage of fibrosis should be assessed appropriately [24]. In addition to fibrosis, 
diabetes and smoking, and absence of statin use are associated 
with an increase in mortality, highlighting the need for comprehensive approaches in patients with NAFLD [25]. Collectively, 
at least 30% to 40% of patients with NAFLD require intensive 
observation and comprehensive measures to inhibit or regress 
the disease process [9,28].
LIMITATIONS OF LIVER BIOPSY
Liver biopsy may provide an accurate diagnosis in approximately 90% of patients with unexplained abnormalities revealed 
by liver function tests [18]. However, liver biopsy represents 
only approximately 1/50,000 of the organ and has its own inherent limitations, such as sampling errors or bias [29]. In fact, steatosis and fibrosis are not uniformly distributed among the segments of the liver [29,30]. Moreover, the progression of inflammation and fibrosis in NAFLD is a dynamic process for which 
liver biopsy may have limitations to follow all the stages of progression of this highly prevalent disease [31].
Noninvasive tools for fibrosis staging have not yet been perfected for therapeutic or other decisions but may be helpful for 
excluding the probability of significant fibrosis and for predicting advanced fibrosis, thus guiding the decision of whether or 
not to perform liver biopsy in a patient with NAFLD [32]. 
THE DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION OF 
NAFLD
Earlier studies reported that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels were elevated in 2.8% of the general population [33] and 
that 46.1% of asymptomatic subjects with elevated serum levels 
of hepatic enzymes were shown to have NAFLD on liver biopsy [21]. For subjects at risk, the major important processes in 
the diagnosis and assessment of NAFLD are (1) to determine 
the existence of hepatic steatosis, either by imaging or histology; (2) to exclude secondary causes of fatty liver; and (3) to assess NAFLD severity by establishing the presence of moderateto-severe fibrosis (fibrosis stage of at least F2) [16]. Before 
making the diagnosis of NAFLD, secondary causes of hepatic 
fat accumulation and significant alcohol consumption (≥21 
standard drinks/week for men and ≥14 standard drinks/week 
for women) need to be excluded [7]. Alcohol consumption over 
a 2-year time frame needs to be surveyed in detail using validated questionnaires [7]. However, it is noteworthy that there is 
also synergy between alcohol intake and obesity or genetic risk 
factors of NAFLD progression for any given level of alcohol intake [8]. Even in patients whose alcohol consumption level is 
low, meeting the diagnostic criteria of NAFLD, small amounts 
of alcohol intake may affect outcomes in NAFLD, which warrants further study [7,34]. After performing a history and examination, subsequent investigations should establish whether the 
patient has NAFLD or another liver condition. 
A consensus regarding initial blood tests for NAFLD has not 
been reached among guidelines [35]. The decision on the extent 
of liver blood tests and interpretation of the results should be 
determined in a clinical context. In adults, initial screening tests 
may include abdominal US, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction if 
positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, and simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation [35]. 
Although ALT levels have been shown to be the best single 
biochemical correlate of hepatic steatosis, liver enzyme levels 
can be normal in up to 50% to 79% of patients with NAFLD, 
fluctuating, or elevated in patients with NAFLD [8,36]. There 
have been suggestions that the current upper limit of normal 
(ULN) for ALT may be too high [37,38], and a recent guidance 
recommended an ALT of >30 U/L as being significant for 
males and >25 U/L significant for females [39]. A slight elevation of serum ferritin level (e.g., >1.5 ULN) generally reflects 
hepatic steatosis or secondary hemosiderosis rather than other 
liver diseases [40]. In many NAFLD patients, elevated ferritin 
may reflect a subclinical inflammatory state, rather than iron 
overload [31]. Similar to this observation, an R2* value on MRI 
(as an indicator of iron content) in its normal or minimally elevated range correlated more strongly with PDFF on MRI than 
the actual grade of hepatic iron content in patients with NAFLD 
[41]. Furthermore, low titers of autoimmune antibodies (in the 
absence of concomitant autoimmune hepatitis) are common and 
of no apparent clinical consequence [40].
Additionally, further clinical approaches to evaluate the presence of commonly associated comorbidities, such as obesity, di-

abetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovary syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea, should also 
be performed [40].
NONINVASIVE STUDIES TO ASSESS 
HEPATIC STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS
Blood markers of hepatic steatosis
Currently, no single biomarker is definitively diagnostic for 
NAFLD. Alternatively, noninvasive blood biomarkers for 
NAFLD may be useful for selecting subjects who need US 
screening for NAFLD. Clinical scores that have been developed 
to predict NAFL have included various clinical and laboratory 
parameters (Table 2) [29,42-48]. A previous study, where US, 
SteatoTest, and liver biopsy were performed together in 304 patients, showed that concordance between steatosis diagnosed at 
both US examination and biopsy, was lower (kappa coefficient=0.32±0.05) than the concordance between SteatoTest (at 
0.50 cutoff) and biopsy (kappa=0.44±0.06; P=0.02) [45], indicating both US and blood biomarker have low sensitivity in 
identifying steatosis. Furthermore, many different scoring systems have been constructed based on specific populations or 
ethnic groups and have not been thoroughly validated across 
different ethnic populations. Thus, scoring systems may not be 
used for the diagnosis of NAFLD and decision-making process 
during the management of NAFLD prior to further validation 
[46]. Rather, these scoring systems may be useful for initial 
screening to select subjects who need a specific evaluation and 
for an epidemiologic prediction for NAFLD and/or cardiometabolic risk in population studies [44]. Further well-designed studies are needed to determine which biomarker panels perform 
better as an initial noninvasive tool for NAFLD screening. In 
addition, it has not yet been determined if liver fat scores are acceptable for monitoring patents during interventions aiming to 
reduce liver fat. A study showed that changes in fatty liver index 
and NAFLD liver fat score induced by a low-carb diet for 12 
months did not correlated with changes of intrahepatic TG content after the dietary intervention [49].

IMAGING STUDIES 
Currently, US, computed tomography (CT), MRI, 1H-MRS, and 
vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) are relatively familiar imaging tools to study NAFLD depending on the 
center or clinic.
Ultrasonography and computed tomography
Although US generally has interobserver variability and limited 
sensitivity to detect mild (<20%) steatosis [16], it is the recommended first line screening method for patients with T2DM by 
the European NAFLD guidelines [34]. The sensitivity of liver 
US for the diagnosis of steatosis may be improved by the careful combination of different echographic parameters during the 
examination; with technical improvements in US equipment, 
optimum sensitivity could be achieved at a liver fat content of 
≥12.5% (sensitivity of approximately 80% to 85%) [13,50]. 
The effect of liver fat content on examination is more pronounced when small amounts of fat are observed, as a previous 
study reported that liver US was only 12% sensitive to a 5% to 
9% hepatic fat content in contrast to 80% sensitive to a ≥30% 
liver fat content [51]. 
The radiodensity of water is 0 Hounsfield unit (HU) by definition and air is defined as –1,000 HUs [16]. In non-contrast 
CT, normal liver parenchyma and fat are approximately 50 to 
60 HUs and –20 to –100 HUs, respectively. Due to inconsistency in HU calibration by external factors, ‘fat-free spleen’ can be 
used as an internal reference [16]. Hepatic HU less than 40 has 
been suggested as a cutoff value for steatosis (>30%) [52], and 
liver HU–spleen HU value less than –9 to –10 can be used as a 
reference to detect steatosis [16,52-54]. Similar to US, CT has 
limited sensitivity to detect mild steatosis (<30% liver fat). Radiation exposure is an additional drawback of CT scanning 
[16,52]. 
In addition, even though US and CT are fairly reliable in the 
condition of >30% liver fat, assessment of dynamic changes in 
liver fat is not reliable [40].
Vibration-controlled transient elastography and other 
methods
Elastography is a set of techniques by which tissue stiffness is 
estimated as a physical property termed the Young’s modulus 
[55]. VCTE measures the speed of a mechanically induced 
shear wave across the liver using pulse-echo ultrasonic acquisitions to obtain a liver stiffness measurement (LSM), as a marker 
of hepatic fibrosis, and ultrasonic energy loss as the sound wave 
passes through the liver to derive the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), as a marker of hepatic steatosis. VCTE measures approximately a 1 cm diameter to 4 cm length region of 
tissue, which is 100 times larger than that evaluated with liver 
biopsy [55]. The velocity of shear wave, which is perpendicular 
to the direction of pulse wave propagation, is proportional to 
liver stiffness, with quantitative results available as the algebraically derived Young’s modulus in kPa [55]. VCTE is an easyto-perform tool to obtain both LSM and CAP values using an 
M (3.5 MHz, at 2.5 to 6.5 cm-depth), or in case of morbid obesity, XL (2.5 MHz, at 3.5 to 7.5 cm-depth) ultrasound probe. 
LSM and CAP values range from 1.5 to 75 kPa and from 100 to 
400 dB/m, respectively. The result of VCTE is obtained as a 
median of at least 10 measurements. Although the interquartile 
range (IQR) of the measurements less than 30% of the median 
is acceptable, an IQR median ratio ≤10% is the best predictor 
of accuracy [56]. CAP cutoffs for the diagnosis of steatosis have 
been variably reported from 248 to 288 dB/m that have wide 
range of sensitivity and specificity [57,58], as LSM cutoffs (≥
8.2 to 9.6 kPa) for advanced fibrosis have also been variably reported [13,57,59]. Very low values of LSM (e.g., <5.6 kPa, or 
<6.5 kPa combined with a result from other non-invasive tests) 
suggest an exclusion of moderate fibrosis [60]. A recent excellent review summarized the performance of VCTE for the identification of stages of fibrosis (Table 3) [56]. 
Although LSM and CAP values are relatively reliable and 
well-validated, these parameters are affected by various patient 
factors, especially body mass index (BMI), which may lead to 
an overestimation [61,62]. With the availability of the XL probe,

which has been proven for use in patients with morbid obesity, 
the failure rate of VCTE for obtaining the LSM and CAP values 
was reported to be less than 5%, while a significant disagreement was observed between the first and second readings for 
LSM and CAP when obtained back to back, at 18% and 11%, 
respectively [63]. However, the assessment of dynamic change 
with either VCTE-CAP or VCTE-LSM is not reliable [40]. 
VCTE data are not reliable under conditions in which a rapidly 
developing mass effect inside the liver will increase the intrahepatic pressure and thereby reduce the liver elasticity: right-sided 
(global) congestive heart failure, acute inflammation and/or 
edema of the liver, and extrahepatic cholestasis [56]. In addition, regarding food intake, a minimum 2-hour fast is currently 
recommended prior to the examination [56]. Because LSM does 
not represent absolute level of liver fibrosis, the results should 
also be interpreted with other clinical results (e.g., physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging methods) [56]. 
Shear wave elastography (SWE, or supersonic shear imaging) 
and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) are additional 
methods that are integrated into conventional US devices to 
measure LSM, which allows US evaluation of the liver (e.g., 
screening for HCC) during the same session [29]. Although 
SWE was shown to perform better than ARFI in differentiating 
≥F2 fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, the three methods 
(VCTE, SWE, and ARFI) showed similar performances in differentiating ≥F3 stage of fibrosis and suffered from significant 
rate of failures or unreliable results [52,59].
Magnetic resonance-based techniques
1
H-MRS has been a gold standard for the MR-based quantification of hepatic TG content in a size of 2×2×2 or 3×3×3 cm3
spectroscopic volume of interest, with high sensitivity and specificity, but it remains primarily a research tool due to its low 
availability and limited clinical application [11,52]. Compared 
with liver biopsy (50 to 100 mg of sample size), a much larger 
volume of liver tissue is assessed using 1H-MRS, minimizing 
the likelihood of sampling error [11]. In the Dallas Heart Study, 
where the 1H-MRS method was used to measure hepatic TG 
content, the reproducibility of the procedure was validated by 
showing that duplicate hepatic TG measurements were highly 
correlated (r=0.99, P<0.001) and that the coefficient of variation between measurements was low (8.5%) [11]. Essentially, in

quencies (i.e., their position in the spectrum, x-axis) and are expressed as a shift in frequency (in parts per million relative to 
signals from protons associated with water) (Fig. 1) [64]. Additionally, the signal intensity of the metabolite (i.e., water or TG) 
peak (the amplitude measured along the y-axis) and the line 
width provide the “area” under a particular metabolite peak, 
which can be used to quantify the amount of observed metabolite within the sampled voxel of tissue (Fig. 1) [64]. The signal 
fat fraction (FF) is given as the fat signal (F) divided by the sum 
of the water (W) and fat signals [FF=F/(W+F)] [52].
In contrast to the measurement of differences in water and TG 
peaks on a resonance frequency domain by MRS, MRI uses frequency variation for spatial localization of the signal to a voxel 
to create a cross-sectional image [64]. Thus, advanced MRI can 
quantify hepatic steatosis by measuring the PDFF, which is the 
fraction of MRI-visible protons bound to fat divided by all protons bound to fat and water in the whole liver (Fig. 2). Chemical 
shift imaging is applied to separate the liver signal into its water 
and fat signal components by acquiring gradient echoes at appropriately spaced echo times [65,66]. 
The accuracy of MRI-PDFF was assessed through linear regression with MRS-PDFF, TG extraction, and histology in an 
elegant study by using ex vivo human livers [30], where MRIPDFF showed an excellent correlation with MRS-PDFF 
(r=0.984) and strong correlation with histology (r=0.850) and 
tissue TG extraction (r=0.871). Furthermore, MRI-PDFF is not 
significantly affected by body factors, co-existing hepatic conditions, or technical factors [65]. Intraobserver agreement, interobserver agreement, and repeatability showed significantly 
smaller variance for MRI-PDFF than for histologic steatosis 
grading [30]. As the standard deviations of repeated MRI-PDFF 
measures have consistently been far less than 1%, MRI-PDFF 
can reliably detect longitudinal changes as small as 2 or less 
percentage points [65]. In line with this view, a clinical study 
showed that, longitudinally, patients who had a decrease or increase of MRI-PDFF ≥1% (confirmed by MRS-PDFF) showed 
a significant parallel decrease or increase in their body weight 
and serum aminotransferase levels at week 24 [67]. Such a

small change in liver fat content could not be quantified with 
histology [67]. In a secondary analysis of a clinical trial involving patients with biopsy-proven NASH, histologic responders 
(≥2-point reduction in NAS, without any worsening of fibrosis 
on liver biopsy) had a proportional reduction in the MRI-PDFF 
of 29.3% from baseline which was statistically significant when 
compared with histologic nonresponders [68]. In contrast to 1HMRS and liver biopsy [30,64], MRI-PDFF is therefore a robust, 
quantitative, non-invasive, MRI-based technique that can be 
used to diagnose steatosis exactly at whatever the grade of the 
state for the entire liver; thereby, overcoming the heterogeneity 
of fat deposition and is useful for clinical trials [52,67,69-71]. 
As an MR-based technique to measure parenchymal rigidity, 
after applying low-frequency vibrations to the abdominal wall, 
magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) tracks propagating 
shear waves by acquiring images with wave motion-sensitized 
phase-contrast sequences and processing raw images (i.e., magnitude and phase images) to “wave images” and then to “elastogram.” The cross-sectional elastogram images reflect the stiffness generated from the wave propagation information [72]. 
Technically, an MRE protocol can be performed with most MR 
scanners by adding hardware to generate mechanical waves and 
adding specific software for acquisition and processing (Fig. 3) 
[65]. Because the waves can be visualized and analyzed deep 
into the liver, MRE evaluates much larger volumes of total liver 
(approximately 5%) than liver biopsy and can be performed in 
conjunction with conventional MRI [73].
Normal liver parenchyma has shear stiffness values less than 
3 kPa [72]. Most studies have demonstrated that MRE has a 
high diagnostic accuracy, with AUC ≥0.90 for identifying advanced fibrosis (F ≥3) and with MRE cutoff values ranging 
from 3.64 to 4.15 kPa [65,74-76]. Additionally, diagnostic accuracy is not affected by patient body factors or disease states. 
Thus, MRE is highly accurate for detecting hepatic fibrosis and 
the results are not influenced by patient demographics, making 
assessments reproducible across key sub-populations. In addition, the inter-observer agreement for staging fibrosis is nearly 
perfect and higher than that seen with histopathology [65,75,76]. 
A 15% increase in MRE-LSM may be associated with histologic fibrosis progression and progression from early fibrosis to 
advanced fibrosis [73]. However, the cutoff value for percent 
change in MRE to define the improvement of fibrosis requires 
further studies; it seems that more than a 20% to 25% difference 
is required to be confident considering the repeatability coeffiFig. 3. Hepatic magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). Liver MRE study in a patient with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease showing: (A)

cient of MRE-LSM [77,78]. Of note is that acute hepatic inflammation may cause a false elevation of VCTE-LSM and 
MRE-LSM values without presence of fibrosis [72]. Fatty 
change in the liver does not affect MRE-LSM, whereas MRELSM does increase if simple steatosis progresses to inflammation (NASH), even before the onset of fibrosis [72]. Although 
MRE may be helpful for the early differentiation of NASH from 
simple steatosis because significant proportion of patients with 
NASH have fibrosis or are going to progress to fibrosis, currently MRE is not indicated for the diagnosis of NASH. However, this view should not be rigid, because simple steatosis as 
well as NASH can progress to liver fibrosis [79,80]. Therefore, 
after the diagnosis of NAFLD, the ideal approach would be to 
try to detect and stage liver fibrosis even in the absence of 
NASH [52].
Many studies have directly compared and demonstrated that 
the performance of MRE and MRI-PDFF is better than that of 
VCTE-LSM and VCTE-CAP, respectively, in diagnosing fibrosis and steatosis in NAFLD patients [81]. Furthermore, both 
MRI-PDFF and MRE as composite biomarkers have been partly validated in clinical trials [68,82]. 
As in VCTE, MRE needs to be performed in a fasting state, at 
least for 2 hours, because increased postprandial portal blood 
flow may cause a dynamic increase in liver stiffness in patients 
with liver disease, potentially leading to an overestimation of 
the extent of fibrosis [29,72].
Other imaging methods
In addition to SWE and ARFI, which are currently unpopular, 
perfusion CT, MRI using Gadoxetic acid or ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles as a contrast agent, MRI targeting myeloperoxidase and others have been studied to differentiate NASH or fibrosis [29,52].
BLOOD MARKERS OR CLINICAL SCORING 
SYSTEMS FOR HEPATIC FIBROSIS 
ASSESSMENT
In patients with NAFLD, the severity of hepatic fibrosis is the 
most powerful determinant of long-term outcomes, including 
mortality [24]; thus, the assessment of fibrosis is essential to 
managing patients with NAFLD. Several prediction scores have 
been developed and validated to identify or exclude advanced 
fibrosis (≥F3). First-line testing should use either FIB-4 index 
or the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). The AST to platelet ratio 
index (APRI) has a relatively low sensitivity [29], but in our experience, it has a comparable performance to that of FIB-4 (unpublished observation). Using these scoring systems, a significant proportion of patients at low risk of fibrosis could avoid an 
unnecessary liver biopsy [29]. Those patients with indeterminate FIB-4 (1.3 to 2.67) or NFS scores (–1.455 to 0.676) may 
comprise up to 30% of patients with NAFLD [83], requiring 
one of the second-line tests in a context-dependent manner, such 
as VCTE, serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score, or MRE. 
The ELF score is a surrogate index based on an extracellular 
matrix panel consisting of plasma concentrations of hyaluronic 
acid, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, and procollagen 
type III amino-terminal peptide [84] However, the ELF test 
seems to need further validation, even though European guidelines recommend [34]. Patients with high FIB-4 (>2.67) or NFS 
(>0.676) values should be considered for referral to a specialist, 
irrespective of second-line tests [35] (Fig. 4). Thus, the use of 
these scores in combination with imaging studies seems to be 
more reasonable. Cytokeratin 18 fragments are created during 
cell death or apoptosis, and have been suggested as a NASH 
biomarker. However, the cytokeratin 18 fragment test did not 
outperform AST measurement in discriminating NASH from 
simple steatosis [85]. Although the combination of cytokeratin 
18 with other parameters may improve the performance, this 
method requires further validation [29].
GENETIC VARIANTS
Variable prevalence of NAFLD and phenotypic expression of 
severity among populations, familial clustering, and twin studies indicate that there are genetic factors associated with 
NAFLD [40,86]. It was reported that genetic factors account for 
approximately 50% of the interindividual differences in the 
prevalence of NASH with cirrhosis in a twin study [87].
Genome-wide association studies have revealed many genes 
associated with NAFLD, and functional studies on those genes 
have added much knowledge on the pathogenesis of NAFLD 
and complex pathophysiologic pathways related with the disease, as a recent review provided systematic and detailed information on those genetic markers [86]. Among several genetic 
risk factors, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patatinlike phospholipase domain–containing 3 (PNPLA3) (rs738409 
c.444 C>G, p.I148M), transmembrane 6 superfamily, member 2 
(TM6SF2) (rs58542926 c.449 C>T, p.E167K), and membrane 
bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 7/transmembrane 
channel-like 4 (MBOAT7/TMC4) (rs641738 C>T) have been 
relatively well validated to promote the development of NAFLD

and its progression (i.e., cirrhosis, HCC, or both) [88-92].
PNPLA3 encodes adiponutrin, a TG lipase that regulates both 
TG and retinoid metabolism and is mainly expressed in the liver, retina, skin, and adipose tissue [86]. The prevalence of the 
PNPLA3 I148M variant differs among ethnic groups ranging 
from 17% to 49%, and is generally correlated with that for 
NASH and its sequelae [86,90,93]. As such, a relatively high 
frequency of SNP in PNPLA3 risk allele has been reported in in 
Mexico, Japan, and Korea [40,94].
The variant is resistant to proteasomal degradation by evading 
ubiquitylation and accumulates on lipid droplets, which interferes with lipolysis and causes a change in phospholipid remodeling [95]. The PNPLA3 SNP rs738409 is strongly associated 
with hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and HCC, independent of the presence of T2DM and obesity [92,96]. Rather, 
obesity increases steatosis, liver cirrhosis, and HCC in carriers 
of the PNPLA3 I148M variant [86,97]. In patients with nonobese NAFLD, the variant of PNPLA3 is more prevalent and is 
associated with NAFLD regression [86]. In addition, a recent 
phenome-wide association study showed that the variant of 
PNPLA3 is also associated with increased risk of T2DM and 
decreased risks of acne, gout, and gallstones [98]. 
TM6SF2 is involved in the secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins from hepatocytes, and TM6SF2 protein expression is markedly decreased in the livers of patients with 
NAFLD compared to control subjects [86,99]. In contrast to 
PNPLA3, the expression of which is induced by carbohydrates 
and free fatty acids via sterol response element binding protein 
1c, there is no interaction of TM6SF2 expression and dietary 
factors [86]. The SNP rs58542926 C>T in TM6SF2 is less 
prevalent (approximately 7%) than the PNPLA3 variant and results in a loss-of-function mutation. It induces a higher liver TG 
content and lower circulating lipoproteins, but with preserved 
insulin sensitivity with regard to lipolysis and hepatic glucose 
production, and a lack of hypertriglyceridemia despite clearly 
increased hepatic fat content [86,100]. As with PNPLA3, the 
TM6SF2 minor (T) allele is associated with greater hepatic steatosis, more severe NASH and greater hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis;

intriguingly, the more common major (C) allele is associated 
with the promotion of very low-density lipoprotein excretion, 
conferring an increased risk of dyslipidemia and CV disease 
[91,101]. In line with this, in a large exome-wide association 
study of plasma lipids in more than 300,000 individuals, the 
PNPLA3 I148M and TM6SF2 E167K variants were strongly associated with hepatic steatosis and progression to NASH, cirrhosis, and HCC, but also with lower blood TG and cholesterol 
concentrations and protection from coronary artery disease 
[86,92]. 
The SNP rs641738 C>T near MBOAT7 has been shown to 
impact inflammation and fibrosis in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, NAFLD, chronic hepatitis C, and chronic hepatitis B 
[102-105]. The rs641738 variant, which encodes p.G17E in 
TMC4, is associated with suppression of MBOAT7 at the 
mRNA and protein levels [86]. The MBOAT7/TMC4 rs641738 
T allele has been shown to be associated with an increased risk 
of steatosis and histologic liver damage in NAFLD (i.e., higher 
severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis) independent of 
obesity [104]. The variant may also predispose patients to HCC 
in patients without cirrhosis [91,106]. The MBOAT7 gene encodes lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) acyltransferase 1, known 
as LPIAT1 or MBOAT7, which selectively uses LPI and arachidonoyl-CoA to form 2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylinositol (PI) 
[107,108]. Consistent with this function, lipidome changes in 
the plasma and liver of patients with NAFLD have been reported: decreases in plasma levels of PI (36:4), PI (38:3), and PI 
(38:5) and decreases in hepatic concentrations of PI (36:4) and 
PI (38:3) in proportion to the number of MBOAT7 variant alleles [104,109]. LPIAT1 contributes to the regulation of free arachidonic acid in the cell through the remodeling of phospholipids [110]. MBOAT7 deficiency is thus predicted to increase free 
polyunsaturated fatty acids and their pro-inflammatory eicosanoid lipids [106,111].
Glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP), encoded by GCKR, 
is expressed only in the liver and regulates the partitioning of 
glucokinase between the cytosol and nucleus; thus it is involved 
in hepatic glucose uptake [112]. In the nucleus of hepatocyte, 
GKRP forms an inhibitory complex with glucokinase, the enzyme responsible for regulating the uptake and storage of dietary glucose [112]. Formation of the inhibitory complex is disrupted by glucose or fructose 1-phsophate after meals, resulting 
in translocation of glucokinase from the hepatocyte nucleus to 
the cytoplasm where it can drive glucose metabolism to glycogen synthesis and de novo lipogenesis. In contrast, fructose 
6-phosphate (F6P), a by-product of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, enhances the formation of an inhibitory complex between the enzyme and the regulatory protein, thus promoting 
nuclear retention and inactivation of glucokinase during fasting 
periods [112]. The P446L (rs1260326 C>T) variant of GCKR, 
encodes a loss-of-function protein that is unable to inhibit glucokinase in response to F6P [86]. Thus, the P446L variant of 
GCKR is associated with increased hepatic glucose uptake, 
which in turn may contribute to increased production of malonyl-CoA and de novo lipogenesis, increased glycolytic pathway 
activity, and concomitantly decreased serum glucose and insulin 
levels [86,113]. The GCKR P446L variant is also associated 
with an increased risk of NASH progression, fibrosis, and 
NASH-HCC in NAFLD patients as well as elevated serum TG 
levels [114,115].
Nutritional factors are very important even when considering 
genetic factors, as adiposity has been shown to amplify the effect of the NAFLD risk alleles in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and 
GCKR [97,113]. Interestingly, in an Italian cohort study that 
evaluated the relationship between HCC risk and the total number of risk alleles, including PNPLA3 I148M, TM6SF2 E167K, 
and MBOAT7 rs641738 T, there was a significant association 
between the number of risk alleles and HCC [106].
In addition, several protective variants have also been reported 
[114]. In particular, SNPs (rs72613567, rs62305723, and rs 
6834314) in HSD17B13, a gene that encodes the hepatic lipid 
droplet protein 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 13, were 
reported to be associated with decreased inflammation, ballooning, fibrosis, and liver enzyme levels in patients with NAFLD 
[116,117]. 
Recently, HSD17B13 was identified as a lipid droplet enzyme 
retinol dehydrogenase, highlighting the importance of retinoid 
homeostasis in NAFLD and its progression [117]. The splice 
variant rs72613567:TA produces a truncated, nonfunctional 
protein that is associated with lower odds of various liver diseases and HCC [116]. It was also found that the isoform encoded by the protective allele is catalytically defective against estradiol [116].
Lean NAFLD may have clinical characteristics and distinct 
course of progression: low BMI and lower level of IR, but faster 
fibrosis progression [31]. Although the cost of genotyping single gene variants is decreasing, and the knowledge about the 
role of genetic impact on the progression and development of 
NAFLD has been expanded, the use of genetic markers in the 
diagnosis and follow-up of NAFLD is not recommended in current guidelines. However, whether specific genetic markers are 
useful for the identification of subgroups with NAFLD at high

risk of aggressive progression to cirrhosis and/or HCC needs to 
be studied.
CONCLUSIONS
Noninvasive biomarker panels are easy to use as initial screening test to rule out or rule in proceeding with imaging studies or 
liver biopsy. However, limited numbers of such tests have been 
validated and recommended in guidelines, for example, FIB-4 
and NFS. Therefore, an imaging study, favorably US, may be 
considered under the current guidelines. However, MR-based 
techniques have more acceptable performance than others, although MRE-based fibrosis assessment and follow-up of the 
patients with fibrosis need to be further validated in the future. 
In the meantime, it is recommended to combine noninvasive 
blood biomarker panels or clinical scoring systems with imaging tools that afford clinics the ability to diagnose and/or followup fibrosis to avoid unnecessary liver biopsies.
