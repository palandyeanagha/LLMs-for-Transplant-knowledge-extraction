 Fecal Carriage of ESBLE and Liver Transplant
Extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates (ESBLE) are emerging pathogens 
that confer resistance to antimicrobial drugs. We conducted 
a 10-year study in France (January 2001–April 2010) to 
investigate the incidence of and risk factors for ESBLE 
infections after liver transplant. Of 710 transplant patients 
screened preoperatively for ESBLE fecal carriage, 5.5% 
had ESBLE infection develop within 4 months after surgery; 
patients with pretransplant ESBLE fecal carriage were more 
likely to have infection develop than were noncarriers. 
Typing showed extensive genetic diversity, with a large 
predominance of CTX-M enzymes. Independent predictors 
of ESBLE infection were pretransplant fecal carriage, 
Model for End Stage Liver Disease score >25, and return to 
surgery. Our results indicate that the infl ux of preoperatively 
acquired ESBLE isolates into the hospital outweighs crosstransmission in the epidemiology of ESBLE infections 
after liver transplant. Transplant candidates should be 
systematically screened for carriage, and posttransplant 
infection in carriers should be treated with carbapenems.
Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLE) isolates, notably 
ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolates, have emerged 
worldwide as a frequent cause of infection in hospitals and 
in the community (1,2). ESBLs confer resistance to all 
β-lactam agents except carbapenems and cephamycins and 
are frequently associated with resistance to other classes 
of antimicrobial drugs, including aminoglycosides and 
fl uoroquinolones (2,3). Therapeutic options for infections 
caused by these multidrug-resistant organisms are therefore 
limited, which may result in delayed effective therapy 
and increased risk for death (4,5). Identifying risk factors 
for ESBLE infections enables identifi cation of patients 
who should receive empirical treatment targeted to these 
organisms.
ESBLE infections may pose a particularly serious 
threat in profoundly immunosuppressed patients, such as 
transplant recipients, who are often empirically treated for 
postoperative infections. Solid organ transplant has been 
shown to be a risk factor for nosocomial ESBLE bacteremia 
(6), but little research has been conducted to identify risk 
factors for ESBLE infections among these patients, and 
previous studies included only kidney transplant recipients 
(7,8). Liver transplant (LT) recipients are particularly 
at risk for bacterial infections because of the severity of 
illness associated with preoperative end-stage liver disease 
and the technical complexity of surgery (9). After LT, 
bacterial infections occur in 35%–70% of patients; these 
infections are predominantly caused by Enterobacteriaceae
(10–13). Although recent studies from Spain and China 
have reported alarmingly high rates of ESBL production in 
isolates from LT recipients (14–16), to our knowledge, the 
epidemiology of ESBLE infections among these high-risk 
patients in a nonepidemic setting has not been investigated.
We assessed the incidence of, risk factors for, and 
molecular epidemiology of ESBLE infections in LT 
recipients. More specifi cally, we investigated whether 
ESBLE pretransplant fecal carriage was an independent 
predictor of ESBLE infection after LT.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
An observational study of patients undergoing LT at 
Beaujon Hospital (Clichy, France) was conducted from 
January 1, 2001, through April 30, 2010. During this period, 
734 patients underwent LT, and pretransplant screening for 
ESBLE fecal carriage was routinely performed as part of 
an infection control program. Rectal swab specimens were 
obtained preoperatively on the day of surgery from 710 of 
the 734 LT recipients; these 710 patients constituted the 
study population (Table 1).
During the study period, standard antimicrobial 
drug prophylaxis consisted of cefoxitin administered 
intraoperatively as described (17); primary 
immunosuppressive therapy consisted of tacrolimus, 
corticosteroids, and mycophenolate mofetil (17). 
Throughout the study period, isolation procedures were 
applied to patients infected or colonized with ESBLE 
isolates until they were discharged from the hospital. More 
specifi cally, these patients were placed in individual rooms, 
and contact isolation precautions, including the use of 
gowns and gloves, were implemented.
Defi nition and Data Collection
ESBLE infections occurring within 4 months after 
LT were investigated. Infections were defi ned on the basis 
of clinical criteria and the isolation of an ESBLE isolate 
from a clinically signifi cant site. Bacteremia was defi ned 
as a positive peripheral blood culture bottle result (13,18). 
Intraabdominal infection was considered to be present 
when an ESBLE isolate was cultured from biliary fl uid, 
from peritoneal fl uid containing >250 polymorphonuclear 
cells/mm3, or from an intraabdominal collection drained 
surgically or by percutaneous aspiration (19). Pneumonia 
was diagnosed on the basis of radiographic fi ndings, 
clinical signs, and culture of >103/mL of an ESBLE isolate 
from a protected distal aspirate (20). Urinary tract infection 
was diagnosed on the basis of urine leukocyte count and a 
positive culture >104 cells/mL (21).
Data were collected in a prospectively maintained 
database. Preoperative data were age, gender, underlying 
liver disease, HIV infection, Model for End Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) score, pretransplant ESBLE fecal 
carriage, stay in intensive care unit >48 h before surgery, 
hospitalization in the previous 6 months, and any history of

RESEARCH
bacteremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or both in the 
previous 6 months. Intraoperative variables were duration 
of surgery, cold ischemia time, combined kidney and liver 
transplant, type of donor (deceased or living), number of 
packed red blood cell units transfused, and type of biliary 
reconstruction (duct-to-duct or Roux-en-Y anastomosis). 
Postoperative data were retransplantation, return to surgery, 
and acute renal failure.
Outcome was assessed by death within 28 days after 
transplant, death while hospitalized, and death related to 
infection. Death was considered be related to infection 
when ESBL infection was the immediate cause of death or 
when it initiated a sequence of events leading to multiorgan 
failure and death.
Microbiological Studies
A rectal swab specimen was routinely obtained 
before LT and plated onto a selective medium consisting 
of Drigalsky agar plates with 1 μg/mL cefotaxime during 
2001–2004 and commercialized agar plates (bioMérieux, 
Marcy l’Etoile, France) during 2004–2010. Plates were 
incubated for 24–48 h. A single sample of each distinct 
type of colony growing on the selective media was 
picked and further studied. Isolates were identifi ed to the 
species level by API 20E strips (bioMérieux), and ESBL 
production was confi rmed by double disk synergy test (22). 
This test was performed by placing disks of cefotaxime, 
ceftazidime, cefepime and aztreonam on Mueller-Hinton 
agar at a distance of 30 mm, center to center, from an 
amoxicillin/clavulanate disk. In case of ambiguous results 
for ampicillin C producers, the presence of an ESBL was 
further investigated by a double disk synergy test with 
a disk spacing of 20 mm and another test performed on 
Mueller-Hinton agar containing cloxacillin (22).
Enterobacteriaceae isolates from clinical specimens 
were also identifi ed by the API 20E strips, and antimicrobial 
drug susceptibility was tested by the Mueller-Hinton 
agar diffusion method and interpreted according to the 
recommendations of the Committee of the French Society 
for Microbiology (23). Clinical isolates were screened 
for ESBL production by the double-disk synergy test as 
described for rectal isolates. Rectal and clinical isolates 
from were kept frozen at −70°C until subcultured for strain 
and ESBL typing.
Strain Typing
The clonal relatedness of ESBLE clinical isolates 
was studied by the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic 
consensus sequence type 2 (ERIC-2) PCR fi ngerprinting 
method (24). Electrophoretic banding patterns were 
compared by visual inspection. For patients who had 
ESBLE preoperative fecal carriage and subsequently had 
infection develop, the isolate from the rectal swab specimen 
and the isolate from the infected site were compared by 
using ERIC-2 PCR.
β-Lactamase Typing
The main types of ESBL are SHV-, TEM-, and 
CTX-M ESBLs. These types were identifi ed by using 
the Check-KPC ESBL microarray system (CheckPoints, Wageningen, the Netherlands), according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (25,26).
Statistical Analysis
The prevalence of pretransplant ESBLE fecal carriage 
and subsequent ESBLE infections was compared among 4 
periods (2001–2003, 2004–2006, 2007–2008, and 2009–
2010) by a test for trend. Univariate analysis was used to 
identify associations between each of the preoperative, 
intraoperative, and postoperative variables and the 
occurrence of ESBLE infections. The χ2 test and, for small 
numbers, the Fisher exact test were used for comparison of 
categorical data. Continuous data were compared by Student 
t test; p<0.05 was considered signifi cant. We performed 
stepwise logistic regression analysis to identify signifi cant 
correlates of ESBLE infections: variables with a p value 
<0.1 were entered into the model. Potential interactions 
between covariates were considered. Data analyses were 
performed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
NC, USA).
Results
Preoperative ESBLE Fecal Carriage
Of the 710 patients screened preoperatively, 29 (4.1%) 
had ESBLE pretransplant fecal carriage; 4 patients each had 
2 distinct ESBLE isolates. Species distribution of the 33 
fecal isolates was as follows: E. coli (n = 21), Enterobacter 
cloacae (n = 5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), K. oxytoca
(n = 1), Citrobacter koseri (n = 1), and C. freundii (n = 1). 
The rate of pretransplant ESBLE fecal carriage increased 
signifi cantly, from 0% to 10.6%, during the study period 
(Table 2).

 Fecal Carriage of ESBLE and Liver Transplant
ESBLE Infections
Of the 710 patients included in the study, 39 (5.5%) 
had ESBLE infection develop within 4 months after LT. 
The incidence rate of a fi rst episode of ESBL infection was 
5.1 cases/10,000 posttransplant days. The rate of infected 
patients increased signifi cantly during the study period, 
from 1.6% during 2001–2003 to 12.8% during 2009–2010 
(Table 2).
The median time from LT to ESBLE infection was 
15 days (range 3–105 days). ESBLE infection was the 
fi rst posttransplant infection in 15/39 patients. The sites of 
ESBL infection were as follows: intraabdominal (n = 19), 
urinary tract (n = 15), respiratory tract (n = 6), bloodstream 
(n = 2), and skin and soft tissues (n = 1). Eight patients 
had secondary bacteremia: 3 patients with peritonitis, 3 
patients with cholangitis, 1 with pneumonia, and 1 with 
cellulitis. Overall, 10 (25.6%) of the 39 infected patients 
were bacteremic.
The predominant causative agent of infection in these 
patients was E. coli (n = 16), followed by E. cloacae (n = 
11), K. pneumoniae (n = 5), K. oxytoca (n = 3), C. koseri (n 
= 2), and Enterobacter aerogenes (n = 2). The susceptibility 
rates of the 39 isolates are shown in Table 3. All isolates 
were susceptible to imipenem.
Six patients died within 28 days after ESBLE infection 
developed (28-day mortality rate 15.4%); 11 patients died 
during hospitalization (in-hospital mortality rate 28.2%). 
Death was related to the infection in 8 patients (infectionrelated mortality rate 20.5%). The in-hospital mortality rate 
was signifi cantly higher in patients with ESBLE infection 
than in those without ESBLE infection (28.2% vs. 15.9%; 
p = 0.0455).
Association between Fecal Carriage and Infection
ESBLE infection occurred in 13 (44.8%) of the 29 
patients with pretransplant fecal carriage versus 26 (3.8%) 
of the 681 noncarriers (p<0.0001). Ten (84.6%) of the 13 
patients with fecal carriage had ESBL infection develop 
within 14 days after LT. The median time to onset of 
infection was signifi cantly shorter among patients with 
pretransplant fecal carriage than among those without 
carriage (9 days vs. 25 days; p = 0.0007). For the 13 carriers 
in whom ESBLE infection developed, the infecting isolate 
belonged to the same species as the fecal (or 1 of the fecal) 
isolate(s). In 10 of these 13 pairs of isolates, ERIC-2 PCR 
typing showed that the fecal isolate and the infecting isolate 
had identical patterns. An example of banding patterns is 
shown in the Figure.
Genetic Relatedness and Types of ESBLs
Overall, 31 ERIC-2 PCR profi les were observed 
among the 39 ESBLE clinical isolates (Table 3). Six of 
these patterns were observed in 2 isolates each (2 E. coli, 
2 K. pneumoniae, 1 E. cloacae, 1 C. koseri), and 1 pattern 
was shared by the 3 K. oxytoca isolates. The remaining 24 
patterns were observed in a single isolate each.
The Check-KPC ESBL microarray analysis (CheckPoints) was used to identify the type(s) of ESBL in 37/39 
tested isolates (Table 3). Nine of the isolates produced 
different types of ESBL, 8 isolates with 2 types and 1 
isolate with 3 types; a single type of ESBL was detected 
in the remaining 28 isolates. Members of the CTX-M 
family, in particular those of the CTX-M-1 group, were 
most frequently detected (Table 3). Overall, enzymes of 
the CTX-M family were observed in 31 (79.5%) of the 39 
isolates tested, including all E. coli isolates. The type of 
ESBL could not be identifi ed in 2 isolates; this result may 
have resulted from plasmid loss, because the double-disk 
synergy test result was negative after subculture.
Risk Factor Analysis
The characteristics of patients with and without ESBL 
infection are compared in Table 4. Variables signifi cantly 
associated with infection in the univariate analysis were 
pretransplant ESBLE fecal carriage, acute liver failure, 
increased MELD score, prolonged hospitalization during 
the 6 months before LT, preoperative intensive care stay 
>48 h, return to surgery, and postoperative acute renal 
failure. The 10 variables with a p value <0.1 were entered 
in the stepwise logistic regression. In the fi nal model, 
pretransplant ESBLE fecal carriage (odds ratio [OR] 18.4), 
MELD score >25 (OR 2.9), and return to surgery (OR 2.7) 
were independent predictors of ESBLE infection (Table 5). 
No signifi cant interactions between the covariates kept in 
the model were found.
Discussion
We demonstrated a progressive and signifi cant increase 
in the incidence of pretransplant ESBLE fecal carriage 
and posttransplant infection among LT patients in our

transplant center over the past decade. We also identifi ed 
pretransplant fecal carriage as an independent risk factor 
for subsequent ESBLE infection. Lastly, we found high 
clonal diversity and a vast majority of CTX-M-1 group and 
CTX-M-9 group enzymes among our isolates.
Recent studies suggest that nonhospitalized patients are 
increasingly important reservoirs of ESBLE isolates; these 
community reservoirs may play a role in the epidemiology 
of ESBLE infections in hospital settings (27–30). Harris et 
al. reported that 2% of patients admitted to intensive care 
were colonized by an ESBL-producing E. coli or Klebsiella
spp. isolate (31). In 2 other recent studies, the rates of 
ESBLE fecal carriage at hospital admission were 10.8% and 
8%, respectively (29,32). Overall, the rate of pretransplant 
carriage was 4.1% in our liver transplant recipients, and a 
signifi cant increase, from 0% to 10.6%, was noted over the 
study period. These isolates may have been acquired in the 
community or during previous hospitalizations.
Overall, 5.5% of patients in our study had ESBLE 
infection develop within 4 months after LT. This infection 
rate increased in similar proportions to the pretransplant 
colonization rate over time, reaching 12.8% during 2009–
2010. We found a signifi cant association between fecal 
colonization status and occurrence of subsequent infection. 
Posttransplant ESBLE infection developed in ≈45% of 
carriers; most infections occurred within 14 days after LT, 
and molecular typing showed that the infecting isolate was 
identical to the isolate from the prettransplant fecal swab 
for most of these patients. This fi nding is consistent with 
previous studies in nontransplant patients that found prior

 Fecal Carriage of ESBLE and Liver Transplant
colonization with an ESBLE isolate confers an increased 
risk for hospital-acquired infection with the same organism 
(29,33,34). In contrast, Arnan et al. recently found that fecal 
carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli was not associated 
with infection in neutropenic patients who had hematologic 
malignancies (35).
Differences in infection rates on the basis of 
pretransplant colonization status may indicate that fecal 
carriage plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of ESBLE 
infection or may only refl ect differences in preoperative 
host characteristics. In this study, we used a multivariate 
logistic regression analysis to control for the effects of 
confounding variables such as the severity of underlying 
liver disease. The results indicate that pretransplant fecal 
carriage is an independent risk factor for ESBLE infection 
after LT. Other predictors of infection in the multivariate 
analysis were high preoperative MELD score and return to 
surgery, 2 factors previously identifi ed as risk factors for 
Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia in LT recipients (18).
Molecular typing of our isolates showed extensive 
genetic diversity. This fi nding strongly suggests that inhospital spread of specifi c clones was not the cause of 
the increase in the frequency of ESBLE infections in our 
transplant center. An active infection-control program 
for multidrug-resistant organisms was in place during the 
study period, including isolation procedures for preventing 
patient-to-patient transmission of ESBLE isolates. 
Similarly, Harris et al. reported that cross-transmission was 
not an important cause of acquisition of ESBL-producing 
E. coli in the intensive care unit setting (36). However, it 
is noteworthy that ESBLE infection occurred in 26 patients 
whose pretransplant fecal carriage screening tests were 
negative, which suggests postoperative acquisition. An 
alternative explanation is that rectal screening may have 
failed to detect colonization in patients with a low intestinal 
inoculum.

RESEARCH
Prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs is a welldefi ned risk factor for ESBLE colonization and infection in 
hospitalized patients and in the community (6,29–33,35,37). 
Patients undergoing LT are particularly likely to be exposed 
to antimicrobial drugs, but this exposure is diffi cult 
to evaluate because all patients receive intraoperative 
prophylaxis, and many receive antimicrobial drugs in the 
early postoperative period for suspected or documented 
bacterial infections. In this study, ESBLE infection was not 
the fi rst postoperative infection in 24/39 infected patients, 
which indicates previous antimicrobial drug use after LT. 
Moreover, antimicrobial drugs given for pretransplant 
infections, which occur in 30%–35% of candidates for LT 
(38), may have predisposed them to ESBLE colonization 
and subsequent infection. Pretransplant antimicrobial 
drug exposure also includes norfl oxacin prophylaxis in 
patients with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. 
Unfortunately, we did not have access to information about 
all antimicrobial drugs that patients may have received as 
outpatients or during hospitalizations in other institutions 
during the waiting period. Further studies are therefore 
needed to identify predictors of pretransplant ESBLE fecal 
carriage among LT recipients.
Our results have implications for the treatment of 
infections in LT recipients. Because ESBLE infections 
may be associated with inappropriate initial therapy and 
increased risk for death, the identifi cation of high-risk 
patients is useful when choosing empiric antimicrobial 
drugs treatment. Therefore, we suggest that candidates for 
LT be systematically screened for ESBLE fecal carriage. 
Carbapenems should be included in initial empiric therapy 
for infections in LT recipients who have documented 
ESBLE fecal carriage.
The main limitation of our work is that it was a 
single-center study, which means the results may not 
be applicable to settings with a different epidemiologic 
context. However, our center is one of the largest LT 
centers in France and receives referrals from throughout the 
country. Moreover, our fi ndings are consistent with most 
recent reports on the epidemiology of ESBLE infections 
worldwide. During the past decade, E. coli has become 
the most prevalent species among ESBLE isolates, and 
CTX-M enzymes have replaced TEM and SHV enzymes 
as the most common types of ESBLs (1,2). Similarly, E. 
coli was the most frequent species identifi ed among our 
isolates, and ESBL typing revealed a large predominance 
of CTX-M-1 group enzymes. Therefore, we assume our 
fi ndings can be generalized to other LT centers that have 
similar infection control strategies. Another limitation 
of our study is that some ESBLE isolates may have been 
unidentifi ed in patients carrying different strains of ESBLproducing E. coli.
In summary, preoperative fecal carriage is an 
independent predictor of ESBLE infection after LT. The 
infl ux of preoperatively acquired ESBLE isolates into the 
hospital outweighs posttransplant cross-transmission in 
the epidemiology of these infections. Given the worldwide 
ongoing diffusion of ESBLE isolates outside hospitals, the 
proportion of LT recipients in whom ESBLE infections 
develop is likely to further increase over time, in spite 
of adequate infection control measures. Therefore, these 
multidrug-resistant organisms may become a major threat 
in LT centers in the near future.
