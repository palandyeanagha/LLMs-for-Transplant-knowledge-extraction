ABSTRACT
Background: Recently, several reports issued clevudine induced myopathy in the long term use.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate antiviral effects and adverse events of clevudine monotherapy in patients with chronic 
hepatitis B (CHB).
Patients and Methods: The subjects were 110 treatment-naïve CHB patients. They were treated with 30 mg clevudine/day for more than six 
months. Virological and biochemical tests, including that for serum creatine kinase (CK), were monitored at baseline and at 3-month intervals 
during treatment period.
Results: In HBeAg-positive patients, the cumulative rates of virological response were 74.0 %, 68.5 %, and 67.3 % after one, two, and three years 
of clevudine treatment, respectively. Cumulative rates of HBeAg loss or seroconversion were 17.8 %, 30 %, and 31.5 % after one, two and, three 
years of clevudine treatment, respectively. In HBeAg-negative patients, the cumulative rates of virological response were 97.3 %, 100 %, and 
94.6 %, respectively. Virological breakthrough occurred in 27 patients. The rtM204I mutation in HBV polymerase was predominantly detected. 
Muscular adverse events were observed in 15 patients. All patients with myopathy recovered after the cessation of clevudine monotherapy. 
Fluctuations in CK level during the clevudine treatment period were frequently observed irrespective of development of myopathy. Multiple 
episodes of CK elevation were significantly related to the development of myopathy.
Conclusions: Long-term clevudine monotherapy is effective for suppression of serum HBV DNA level and normalization of serum alanine 
amino transaminase levels, but associated with occurrence of rtM204I mutation. Clevudine-induced muscular adverse events are not 
uncommon, although they are totally reversible after cessation of the treatment. Muscular adverse events and serum CK level should be 
carefully monitored during long-term treatment with clevudine.

Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
During the long-term clevudine monotherapy in chronic hepatitis B patients, clevudine is effective for suppression of serum HBV 
DNA level and normalization of serum alanine amino transaminase. Clevudine-induced muscular adverse events are not uncommon, although they are reversible. Monitoring of creatinine kinase level may be helpful for early detection of clevudine-induced 
myopathy. Therefore, HBV DNA and muscular symptoms should be monitored closely during the long-term use of clevudine.

1. Background
Treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection 
with nucleoside/nucleotide antiviral agents aims for the 
prolonged suppression of viral load and prevention of 
progress to decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. To achieve this goal, the antiviral agent 
should be a potent suppressor with sustained effects, and 
should be safe for long-term use (1). Clevudine [L-FMAU, 
(1-(2-fluoro-5-methyl-β, L-arabinofuranosyl) uracil)] is a 
pyrimidine L-nucleoside analog with potent and sustained antiviral activity against HBV (2-4). It is an enantiomer of D-FMAU and is structurally related to fialuridine, 
lamivudine, and telbivudine (2). Phase II studies on clevudine therapy found that the median reduction in serum 
HBV DNA level from baseline to week 12 of treatment was 
4.5 log10 copies/ml and post-treatment antiviral activity was sustained for 12 weeks after therapy without any 
significant complication (3, 4). In phase III clinical trials on clevudine therapy, the median serum HBV DNA 
reductions were 5.1 log10 copies/ml in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients and 4.2 log10 copies/ml in 
HBeAg-negative patients after 24 weeks of treatment (5, 
6). Clinical trial of one-year clevudine treatment demonstrated that clevudine has a potent antiviral efficacy and 
low incidence of resistance (7-9). Viral breakthrough during clevudine therapy occurs less frequently than with 
lamivudine; the incidence of viral breakthrough at 48 
weeks of clevudine treatment was 9.4 % (8). However, data 
on the efficacy and safety of this antiviral agent during its 
long-term use are limited. Recent clinical trials of longterm therapy with clevudine in the USA were terminated 
because of safety issues after several studies found that it 
induced myopathy (10-12). The discontinuation of clevudine therapy appears to be sufficient to manage this myopathy and enable recovery from it. Lack of clinical experience with this drug-related toxicity makes it difficult to 
detect and identify similar potential adverse events in future drug development. Muscle enzymes such as creatine 
kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, and lactate could 
be considered as screening tools to diagnose myopathy. 
However, the muscular adverse events during long-term 
clevudine treatment have not yet been clearly identified.
2. Objectives
The present study was thus conducted to assess virological response and muscle-related adverse events associated with long-term monotherapy with clevudine.
3. Patients and Methods
3.1. Patients
The study subjects were 110 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who were enrolled consecutively between January 
2007 and June 2009 at Konkuk University Medical Center. 
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) had been detectable 
in the serum of all enrolled patients for more than six 
months, their serum alanine amino transaminase (ALT) 
level was greater than twice the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) for chronic liver disease, and they had not been 
treated previously with anti-HBV nucleosides or nucleotides. Those with HBeAg-positive CHB exhibited a serum 
HBV DNA level greater than 5 log10 copies/ml, while in 
those with HBeAg-negative CHB and/or with compensated cirrhosis, it was greater than 4 log10 copies/ml. 
Exclusion criteria included patients with chronic renal 
failure, decompensated liver disease, and co-infection 
with hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and HIV. Pregnant or breastfeeding women and women of child-bearing age who 
were unwilling to use barrier contraceptive devices were 
also excluded. Cirrhosis was diagnosed clinically based 
on imaging findings (abdominal computed tomography 
or magnetic resonance imaging) and compatible clinical features (esophageal varices or thrombocytopenia). 
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of Konkuk University Medical Center (KUH 
1010277). All of enrolled patients gave their written, informed consent for storing their sera and for the biochemical tests and HBV genetic studies.
3.2. Study Design
All 110 treatment-naïve patients received 30 mg of clevudine once daily for more than six months from January 
2007 onwards. They were monitored at baseline and every three months during clevudine therapy. They were 
assessed clinically by obtaining their medical history, 
and subjecting them to a physical examination, electrocardiography, and testing of blood HBeAg status (Cobas 
e immunoassay, Roche, Switzerland) and serum HBV 
DNA levels. At the three-monthly follow-ups during the 
treatment period, the patients were assessed clinically 
to determine their tolerability, and subjected to a physical examination, blood chemistry, and HBV status testing. Serum HBsAg levels were tested after 12 months of 
therapy. Serial blood samples were collected and stored 
frozen at -80°C from each patient at the time of initiation of each antiviral agent, every three months during 
treatment, and at the time of viral breakthrough. Serum 
HBV DNA levels were assessed using the COBAS Amplicor 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, which has a lower 
limit of detection of 300 copies/ml (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA).
3.3. Virological Response
Primary non-response was defined as a decrease in serum HBV DNA to less than 2 log10 copies/ml at six months 
therapy (13). Primary treatment failure was considered 
to have occurred when serum HBV DNA levels remained 
above 5 log10 copies/ml through month 12. Virological 
response was defined as a decrease in the serum level 
of HBV DNA to a level undetectable by PCR assay, or the 
loss or seroconversion of HBeAg in patients who were initially HBeAg positive. Biochemical response was defined 
as a decrease in serum ALT level to within the normal 
range. Complete response was defined as fulfilling the 
criteria of biochemical and virological response and loss

of HBsAg. Virological breakthrough was defined as an 
increase in serum HBV DNA to more than 1 log10 copies/
ml above the nadir after achieving a virological response 
during treatment. When viral breakthrough developed 
during the treatment period, we tested a restriction fragment mass polymorphism (RFMP; Genematrix, Youngin, 
Korea) at rt180 and rt 204 in HBV polymerase gene (14). 
Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities related to 
myopathy were monitored throughout the follow-up period and graded for severity according to criteria adapted 
from the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (15). Clevudine-induced myopathy was diagnosed 
according to clinical symptoms of proximal muscle 
weakness causing inability to perform usual social and 
functional activities and corresponding neurological 
and physical examination findings by an expert neurologist. Laboratory findings related to muscle damage and 
electromyography (EMG) were used as ancillary data. 
Types of myopathy were classified pathologically by muscle biopsy (16). Grade 3 aminotransferase elevations were 
defined as 5.1–10.0 times the baseline; grade 4 elevations 
were defined as ≥ 10 times the baseline and/or evidence 
of hepatic failure. We measured levels of serum CK every 
three months during the clevudine therapy period using 
by stored frozen sera at -80°C. Grades 1-2 CK elevations 
were defined as levels 3.0-9.9 times the ULN; grade 3-4 elevations were defined as ≥ 10 times the baseline.
3.4. Statistical Analysis
All data were entered into a database and analyzed using SPSS 13.0 for Windows software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 
USA). Continuous variables are presented as the mean ± 
SD values, and categorical variables as absolute and relative frequencies. Serum HBV DNA level and virological 
breakthrough were analyzed by t-test. The incidence of 
undetectable levels of serum HBV DNA levels and virological breakthrough were analyzed using Pearson’s 2 
tests. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically 
significant.
4. Results
4.1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients
A total of 110 patients were studied. The baseline characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean age 
of the enrolled patients was 45.1 years, 74 patients (67.3 
%) were HBeAg positive, and 36 had cirrhosis. The mean 
follow-up duration was 17.3 months. The median serum 
HBV DNA level at baseline was 7.84 log10 copies/mlin the 
HBeAg-positive patients and 6.43 log10 copies/ml in the 
HBeAg-negative patients. Nine patients (8.2 %) had been 
taking an oral statin, a well-known cause of drug-induced 
myopathy. There was no demonstrable concurrent medication such as corticosteroids, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, certain 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme 
reductase inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, penicillamine, zidovudine, cyclosporine, erythromycin, niacin, 
and/or azole antifungals (Table 1).

4.2. Virological and Biochemical Response
Of HBeAg-positive patients, serum HBV DNA was undetectable in 64.4 %, 74.0 %, 68.5 %, and 67.1 % at six, 12, 24, 
and 36 months of clevudine treatment, respectively; the 
corresponding values for HBeAg-negative patients were 
94.6 %, 97.3 %, 100 %, and 94.6 % (Figure 1). There were no 
primary non-responders or primary treatment failures in 
either of these two groups. HBeAg loss or sero conversion 
was observed in 17.8 %, 30.1 %, and 31.5 % at 12, 24, and 36 
months of treatment, respectively. None of the patients 
experienced HBsAg loss or sero conversion during the 
treatment period. Among the HBeAg-positive patients, 
ALT level became normalized in 83.6 %, 78.1 %, and 75.3 % 
at 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively; the corresponding 
values for the HBeAg-negative patients were 91.9 %, 91.9 % 
and 89.2 % (Figure 2).

4.3. Virological Breakthrough and Genotypic Mutations
Viral breakthrough occurred in 27 patients during 
the follow up period. The cumulative incidence of viral breakthrough in HBeAg-positive patients was 11.8 % 
and 22.7 % at 12 and 24 months of therapy, while that in 
HBeAg-negative patients was 9 %, 23 %, and 24.5 % at 12, 24, 
36 months, respectively. Baseline serum HBV DNA levels 
were 7.1 ± 1.4 log10 copies/ml and 6.4 ± 1.2 log10 copies/
ml in the groups that did not and did develop viral breakthrough, respectively; the difference was not statistically 
significant (P = 0.345). Thus, initial serum HBV DNA level 
was not a risk factor for developing viral breakthrough. 
The rate of undetectable levels of HBV DNA at six months 
of treatment is significantly lower in the group that did 
not develop viral breakthrough (P = 0.001). Other factors, such as age, sex, HBeAg status, cirrhosis, underlying 
disease, fatty liver, and follow-up duration, were not correlated with developing viral breakthrough. Virological 
resistance was examined by RFMP for rt204 and rt180 
at the time of virological breakthrough in 25 patients. 
The rtM204I mutation in the HBV polymerase gene was 
detected in 24 patients; the remaining patients had 
wild-type rt204 and rt180. Of 24 cases with the rtM204I 
mutation, three had co-dominant rtM204I and rtL180M 
mutations. One patient had a mixed pattern of rtM204I/V 
and rtL180M mutations.

and B) HBeAg-Negative Patients
4.4. Safety and Muscular Adverse Events
Patients underwent routine check-ups every three 
months during clevudine therapy to identify any adverse 
events and to evaluate therapeutic responses. The only 
clinically significant adverse event that led to treatment 
interruption or discontinuation during the treatment 
period was myopathy. None of the patients has experienced toxic-grade serum creatinine [≥ 1.1 times the ULN], 
rhabdomyolysis, or hepatic failure during treatment. Myopathy was diagnosed in 15 patients during the treatment 
period; the clinical and laboratory data of the patients

during the evaluation of myopathy are summarized in 
Table 2. One patient had been taking 10 mg of atorvastatin 
once daily, a well-known cause of drug-induced myopathy. Of 15 patients with myopathy, eight were female, and 
six had cirrhosis. The mean duration of clevudine therapy before symptom onset was 14.0 months (n = 15; range, 
9.3-23.5 months). Most of these patients complained 
about general weakness and difficulty in climbing the 
stairs. Weight loss was also an important finding of myopathy. EMG findings were variable. Only four of these 
patients also exhibited both grade 1 and 2 CK elevations. 
In one patient, examination of a biopsy specimen taken 
from the left vastus lateralis muscle revealed pathologic 
features compatible with myopathy. All patients with myopathy fully recovered from the condition after stopping 
clevudine or switching to another antiviral agent (0.5 
mg/day entecavir). The mean recovery time after cessation of clevudine was 4.2 months (n = 14; range, 1.6-8.7). 
Serum CK levels were monitored in 99 patients. Grade 3/4 
ALT or AST elevations during treatment were observed in 
only one case. CK elevation was frequently observed in 
the clevudine-treated patients. A total of 63 patients developed abnormal CK levels (i.e., more than the ULN) at 
least once during the follow-up period. Twenty four episodes of toxic-grade CK elevations (≥ 3.0 times the ULN) 
developed in 19 patients. Severe grades (grade 3/4, ≥ 10 
times the ULN) of CK elevations developed in a patient at 
nine months of treatment, who had not developed myopathy. 100% in myopathy group and 57.1 % in non-myopathy 
group showed at least one episode of abnormal elevation

of CK (P = 0.001). 93.3 % in myopathy group and 40.5 % in 
non-myopathy group showed at least two episodes of abnormal elevation of CK (P = 0.001). 40.0 % in myopathy 
group and 15.5 % in non-myopathy group showed at least 
one episode of toxic grade above 1 of CK (P = 0.026). No 
patient of both groups showed toxic grade above 3 of 
CK. There were frequent fluctuations in CK level during 
clevudine treatment in both groups. Hematologic and 
biochemical factors were not associated with developing 
myopathy during clevudine therapy (Table 3). Risk factors of developing myopathy were underlying thyroid or 
rheumatic diseases (P = 0.048) and abnormal episodes of 
CK elevation (P = 0.006) including toxic grade 1 or 2 CK 
elevations (P = 0.008) (Table 3).
5. Discussion
This was an observational study of the efficacy and adverse events during long-term monotherapy with clevudine in treatment-naïve CHB patients. Clevudine monotherapy showed a potent antiviral effect within 12 months 
of treatment in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative 
patients. Phase III clinical trials of clevudine therapy 
demonstrated that 59.0 % of HBeAg-positive patients and 
92.1 % of HBeAg-negative patients had undetectable levels 
of HBV DNA after 24 weeks of treatment (5, 6). Similarly, 
in the present study, 64.4 % of HBeAg-positive patients 
and 94.6 % of HBeAg-negative patients had undetectable levels of HBV DNA by quantitative PCR assay after six 
months of clevudine therapy. This study revealed a potent antiviral response at 12 months of treatment (74.0 % 
in HBeAg-positive and 97.3 % in HBeAg-negative patients), 
which is comparable to the results obtained for entecavir 
or tenofovir therapy (17, 18). Interestingly, there were no 
primary non-responders or primary treatment failures. 
However, the virological responses were lower at 24 and 
36 months than that at 12 months, particularly among 
HBeAg-positive patients. The decreasing tendency of cumulative virological response reflects the development 
of antiviral resistance during long-term use of clevudine. 
Virological breakthrough occurred in 11.8 % and 22.7 % of 
the patients at 12 and 24 months of clevudine treatment, 
respectively, similar to the findings with telbivudine 
therapy (19). However, clevudine was associated with a 
higher incidence of virological breakthrough compared 
to entecavir and tenofovir (20, 21). Clevudine resistance is 
associated with rtM204I mutation in the HBV polymerase 
gene (22). In our study, genotypic mutation was detected 
in 24 out of 25 cases for which a genotype analysis was 
performed. Resistant mutations were rtM204I and/or 
rtM204V and/or rtL180M; these are well-known antiviral 
resistant mutations in HBV DNA against lamivudine and 
telbivudine (23). The structural similarity of clevudine 
and other two nucleoside analogues could thus cause 
development of the same antiviral-resistant mutation in 
HBV DNA polymerase. Nucleoside/nucleotide analogueinduced myopathy occurs during long-term treatment 
for chronic viral infection such as CHB and HIV (24). The 
following mechanisms of drug-induced myotoxicity 
have been proposed: (a) direct effects on a muscle organelle, such as mitochondria, lysosomes, and myofibrillar proteins, (b) alteration of muscle antigens, thereby 
inducing an immunological or inflammatory reaction, 
and (c) induction of systemic effects, such as electrolyte 
disturbances, nutritional deprivation, or malabsorption, which secondarily affect muscle function (16). The 
biological mechanisms of clevudine-related myopathy 
remained unclear. Recent studies of clevudine myopathy 
suggest mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible mechanism (11, 12). Our experience of emergence of myopathy in 
clinical practice was in 15 out of 110 CHB patients (13.6 %) 
receiving clevudine therapy lasting more than 12 months. 
There was no remarkable lactic acidosis and no permanent and irreversible myopathy damage in either this 
study or any of previously published case reports (unlike filauridine disaster) (25). Clevudine is known to possess prolonged potent antiviral activity after cessation of 
medication (6, 26). Moreover, the characteristic pharmacodynamic clearance of clevudine, which does not follow 
first-order kinetics as a function of time, may increase 
intracellular L-FMAU triphophate (L-FMAUTP) in longterm clevudine therapy. Therefore, the accumulation of 
intracellular L-FMAUTP levels could help exert an HBV inhibitory effect, but also cause drug-related toxicities under long-term therapy. Weight loss and general weakness 
were frequent subjective symptoms of myopathy. Difficulty in climbing the stairs is also a pathognomic symptom. The most common sign in our study was decreased 
motor function in proximal muscles. Asking the patient 
to complete an easy stair climbing is the best way of discriminating between myopathy and general weakness. 
The EMG findings of the myopathy patients were highly 
variable: active, inactive, acute, and chronic at the time 
of diagnosis. Clinical symptoms of myopathy and muscular power recovered gradually after discontinuation of 
clevudine in 14 of the followed-up patients. In 8 of these 
14 followed-up patients, we switched from clevudine to 
entecavir, after which they all recovered completely from 
the clinical myopathic symptoms without experiencing 
viral breakthrough. Therefore, switching to another antiviral agent appears to be the best option for patients 
with antiviral-induced myopathy. The phase III GLOBE 
study found three symptomatic myopathic cases out of 
680 patients who received telbivudine (19). That study 
also showed an adverse event, a grade 3 or 4 elevation in 
serum CK level that occurred in 7.5 % of patients receiving telbivudine. In the recent clinical studies of clevudine 
treatment, incidence of developing myopathy was reportedly higher than that for telbivudine, including our 
experience (15 %) (10, 12). There was no report about elevations of CK with clevudine. It is not possible to compare 
the toxic-grade elevation of CK levels between the GLOBE 
study and ours; because different criteria for grading the 
toxicity of CK were used (the criterion of toxic grade 3 of 
CK was defined as ≥ 10 times the ULN in our study, but as 

Kim BK et al. Clevudine Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis B

≥ 7 times the ULN in the GLOBE study). Grade 3 or 4 elevations in CK level were not observed in our study. However, 
64 % (63/99) of our patients experienced an abnormal CK 
level (i.e., more than the ULN) at least once through the 
follow-up period. In total, 24 episodes of toxic grade CK elevations developed in 19 patients. Elevation of serum CK 
level is not regarded as a specific marker for myopathy 
because CK can not only be elevated by myotoxic muscle 
damage, but also by various muscle injuries including 
trauma and injection, as well as other factors. In the clinical trials for telbivudine, CK elevations were transient and 
were not reliable markers of muscular adverse events 
(19, 27). However, our results showed that at least one or 
two episodes of abnormal CK elevation and at least one 
episode of toxic-grade CK > 1 occurred more frequently 
in patients developing myopathy. Elevation of CK levels 
before a diagnosis of myopathy could be a reflection of a 
subclinical stage of myopathy. For early detection of subclinical myopathy without overt muscle weakness, a careful medical examination should be followed by tests for 
serum CK level. Together, the findings of this study show 
that long-term clevudine therapy has potent antiviral 
effects and results in biochemical improvements. However, viral breakthrough was observed after 12 months of 
treatment. Clevudine-induced muscular adverse events 
were not uncommon during long-term clevudine treatment, even though the condition was totally reversible 
after cessation of the treatment or switching to a different antiviral medication. Monitoring of CK levels may be 
helpful for early detection of clevudine-induced myopathy during long-term therapy. Therefore, HBV DNA and 
muscular symptoms should be monitored closely during 
the long term use of clevudine.
