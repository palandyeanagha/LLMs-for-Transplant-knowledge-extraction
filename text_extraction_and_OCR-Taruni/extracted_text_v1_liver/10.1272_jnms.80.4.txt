Abstract
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in rats is technically feasible and useful for the
assessment of clinical liver transplantation and analysis of inflammatory liver diseases. OLT in
rats was pioneered by Lee et al. in 1973 using hand-suture techniques of all vessels. This
model has not been widely used due to the long operative time and technical demand. The
cuff method was introduced by Kamada in 1979, and today, the Kamada technique is the one
most commonly used worldwide. However, this technique does not include hepatic artery
reconstruction, although this procedure is routinely performed in clinical transplantation.
Nevertheless, several techniques for hepatic artery reconstruction in rat OLT have been
reported recently, and our group also developed a simple splint technique from recipient right
renal artery to donor celiac axis bearing the hepatic artery. In the present article, we describe
the Kamada technique, as a standard surgical method for rat OLT. In addition, we also
describe our splint technique for hepatic artery reconstruction. Then, we compare the features
of Kamada technique and our splint technique for hepatic artery reconstruction and all other
surgical techniques currently in use for rat OLT. The widespread use of the rat OLT model
should help to provide full assessment of transplant immunology and the mechanism and
treatment of inflammatory liver diseases.

Introduction
Liver transplantation is the replacement of a
diseased liver with a healthy liver graft. About 50
years have passed since the first clinical liver
transplantation by a surgical team led by Starzl in
the United States1,2. One year after the first liver
transplantation, clinical liver transplantation was
started in Japan3

heart-beating donor was first performed in 1964 by
Nakayama from Chiba University. The first living
donor liver transplantation in Japan was performed
in November 1989 by Nagasue of Shimane
University for a boy with biliary atresia4
. Makuuchi
of Shinshu University succeeded in performing the
worldʼs first living donor liver transplantation
between an adult donor and an adult recipient in
November 19935
. After the Japanese government
enacted the Organ Transplantation Law in 1997,
Kawasaki of Shinshu University performed the first
case of liver transplantation from a brain-dead
cadaveric donor in Japan in 19996
. At Nippon
Medical School Hospital, clinical liver transplantation
has also been performed by Department of Surgery
since 20007
. Thanks to advances in surgical
techniques and the development of new
immunosuppressants, liver transplantation has
become an important treatment for hepatic failure.
The advances in liver transplantation are due, in
part, to research in small and large experimental
animals. Experimental liver transplantation was first
attempted about 60 years, at almost the similar
period as the start of clinical liver transplantation in
the United States2,8,9. Since then, new animal models
have been developed, surgical techniques have been
continuously refined, and experimental liver
transplantation is now a versatile research tool that
has been used to clarify various issues related to
human clinical liver transplantation10,11. In particular,
the rat has become a suitable model for studying the
mechanisms of graft rejection, graft tolerance, and
preservation-induced injury in liver
transplantation12―14, based on its technical feasibility,
the availability of inbred strains with wellestablished major histocompatibility complex, low
costs, and simple handling. Now, the rat model of
liver transplantation has been modified to serve as a
model for clinical living donor liver transplantation
using partial liver grafts, auxiliary heterotopic liver
transplantation, retransplantation using the same
liver graft, and xenogeneic liver transplantation15―19.
Rat Orthotopic Liver Transplantation (OLT)
Model
The orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)
technique in the rat was first described by Lee20,21
and was further enhanced by Kamada by the
introduction of the cuff technique22. Ishii E. worked
with Dr. Kamada at the National Childrenʼs Medical
Research Center, Tokyo, Japan23, and learned his
technique directly from him. The Kamada technique
of rat OLT appears to be well standardized and has
become popular, and the model has been used
worldwide. The rat OLT model is useful for analysis
of clinical liver transplantation. In addition, we
consider this model to be important for assessing
inflammatory liver diseases. In the present article,
we describe the Kamada technique of rat OLT, as a
standard surgical technique. Although controversy
exists regarding the importance of hepatic artery
(HA) reconstruction in rat OLT experiment, we
describe our recently developed splint technique for
HA reconstruction in rat OLT.
Kamadaʼs Technique for Rat OLT
In rat OLT, at least 4 anastomoses should be
performed for donorʼs and recipientʼs veins, such as
suprahepatic inferior vena cava ( SHIVC ) ,
infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IHIVC), and portal
vein (PV), and the bile duct (BD). In Kamadaʼs
technique, the cuff method is used to reconstruct the
PV and IHIVC22. The anastomosis of the SHIVC is
performed with the suture technique, and the
telescope method is used to reconstruct the BD.
Animals, Chemical Agents,
and Surgical Instruments
Rats 10 to 14 weeks old and weighing 200 to 250 g
at the time of surgery were used as both donors and
recipients. The rats were housed in Plexiglas cages
in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
environment and allowed free access to water and
normal rat chow. The Animal Studies Committee of
our institution approved all experimental protocols

The donor bile duct (BD) is transected, and a telescoping tube is inserted. The 
suprahepatic inferior vena cava (SHIVC), portal vein (PV), and infrahepatic inferior vena

and surgical procedures.
The chemical agents used included heparin
(Mochida Pharmaceutical, Tokyo), normal saline
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka), and
diethyl ether (Wako Pure Chemical Industries).
Instruments for microsurgery were from
Muromachi Kikai Co., Ltd., Tokyo. A 6-0 silk thread
was used for cuff preparation, 6-0 proline and 7-0
proline sutures (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA)
were used for anastomosis of the SHIVC, and 3-0
nylon suture on a needle was used for abdominal
wall closure. The cuff was made from a 14-G
peripheral catheter (14-G Surflo, Terumo Corp.,
Tokyo) for anastomosis of the PV and the IHIVC.
The splint tube for anastomosis of the HA and
telescope tubes for anastomosis of the BD were
prepared from 22-G peripheral catheter (22-G Surflo,
Terumo).
Rat OLT
Rat OLT was performed with the technique of
Kamada22, and the HA reconstruction was performed
with our splint technique.
Donor Surgery (Fig. 1)
A transverse abdominal incision is performed
under ether anesthesia. The gastrointestinal tract is
exteriorized to the left and covered with wet gauze.
The PV is divided from the right gastric and splenic
veins. The IHIVC is divided from the adrenal vein
and the lumbar vein. The right renal vein is ligated
and isolated from the IHIVC. The donor BD is
transected, and a 0.3-cm-long tube (22-G Surflo) is
inserted into the lumen of the BD and
circumferentially secured with 6-0 silk suture. Then
the gastroduodenal artery, the left gastric artery,
and the splenic artery are ligated and divided.
Heparin (50 U) is injected intravenously. The celiac
axis and the aortic segment are divided. The IHIVC
and PV are clamped. The liver is perfused through
the PV with an intravenous cannula connected to a
syringe containing physiological saline solution. The
SHIVC, PV, and IHIVC are divided. The liver graft
is placed in a 4℃ saline bath. The donor operation
lasts 20 to 30 minutes.

A) The liver graft is placed in a 4℃ saline bath. The suprahepatic inferior vena cava 
(SHIVC) is prepared, and stay sutures are applied using 6-0 proline on both edges of the 
SHIVC. B) The cuff body with cuff extension for the donor portal vein (PV) and the 
donor infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IHIVC) are prepared from a 14-G Surflo catheter 
together with telescoping tubes (22-G Surflo) for the donor and recipient bile ducts 
(BDs). C) PV cuff attachment; the wall of the PV trunk is completely reversed with 
microforceps, and the reversed PV wall is fixed on the cuff by ligation of the silk thread. 
D) In the liver graft, the cuffs are attached in the PV and IHIVC, and the telescoping 
tube is inserted into the donor BD.
Liver Graft Preparation (Fig. 2)
The cuff segments for the PV and IHIVC are a
0.2-cm-long cuff body with a 0.2-cm cuff extension.
The cuff preparation for both vessels is performed
in an iced saline bath. The cuff extension is held
with forceps, and another forceps is passed through
the lumen of the cuff tube to grasp the PV. The cuff
is then slipped over the PV. The cuff extension,
including the PV, is secured with a bulldog clamp,
which is fixed to the wall of the bath container. At
this point, the open end of the PV is spread with 2
forceps. The end of the PV is then everted over the
cuff body and secured in this position with a
circumferential 6-0 silk suture. The same method is
used for the IHIVC. To prepare the SHIVC, the
diaphragm and connective tissues are completely
removed. Stay sutures are then made with 6-0
proline on both edges of the SHIVC.
Recipient Surgery
A midline abdominal incision is made under ether
anesthesia. The gastrointestinal tract is covered with
wet gauze and kept within the abdominal cavity.
The right adrenal and left phrenic veins are ligated
and divided. The right renal artery is transected,
and a 0.3-cm-long tube (22-G Surflo) is inserted into
the arterial lumen and circumferentially secured
with 6-0 silk suture. Right nephrectomy is performed
after right renal vein ligation. A 0.4-cm-long tube (22-
G Surflo) is inserted into the BD and secured with a
circumferential 6-0 silk suture. The IHIVC and PV
are cross-clamped with microvessel clips, and the
SHIVC is cross-clamped with a Satinsky clamp.
These vessels are divided, and the recipient liver is
removed.

donor SHIVC is anastomosed end-to-end to the
recipient SHIVC with 7-0 proline. Traction is applied
to the distal end of the recipient PV. The recipient
PV is irrigated and opened with a needle attached to
a syringe containing cold saline. The cuff extension
of the donor PV is held with a right-angle forceps.
The cuffed donor PV is inserted into the recipient
PV. The anastomosis is completed with a
circumferential 6-0 silk suture. The clamps on the
PV are released, and the anhepatic time is
approximately 15 minutes. Next, the IHIVC
anastomosis is performed with the same method
used for PV anastomosis. The cuffed donor IHIVC is
inserted into the recipient IHIVC, and the
anastomosis is completed with a circumferential 6-0
silk suture. The BD anastomosis is performed with
the telescope technique between the tube secured in
the donor BD and the tube secured in the recipient
BD. The anastomosis is secured by tying together
the ligatures on the donor and recipient BDs (Fig. 4).
The abdominal incision is closed with a continuous
3-0 nylon suture. The PV clamping time is about 15
minutes, and the IHIVC clamping time is 20 to 25
minutes. The recipient surgery as described in the
Kamada technique should be completed within 40
minutes.
Splint Technique of HA Reconstruction

performed (Fig. 5). In the liver graft, the celiac axis
bearing the HA is prepared. In the recipient, the

tube secured in the recipient right renal artery is
inserted in the donor celiac axis bearing the HA and
secured with 6-0 silk suture. In procedures for HA
re-arterialization, the connection between the
recipient right renal artery with splint tube and the
donor celiac artery is completed within 1 minute. In
syngeneic OLT between Lewis rats, the patency of
the splint anastomosis is confirmed with
angiography of the grafted liver through the
recipient aorta more than 120 days after surgery
(Fig. 6).
Other Surgical Technique of Rat OLT
In rat OLT, several techniques or modifications
have been described to improve and facilitate the
complex procedures 20 ― 22,24 ― 48. Each modification
represents a change or simplification of the
reconstruction methods of 5 anatomical structures
(which are the cornerstones of a successful OLT):
the SHIVC, PV, IHIVC, HA, and BD. Table 1 and 2
summarize the reconstruction methods for the
hepatic venous system (SHIVC, PV, and IHIVC), the
BD, and HA20―22,24―48. Generally, 5 methods are used for
the reconstruction between the donorʼs and
recipientʼs vein, artery, and BD: 1) microsuture, 2)

technique provides conditions most similar to
physiological conditions for the clinically
transplanted liver and, thus, is associated with fewer
complications, such as thrombosis49, it requires a high
level of microsurgical skill. In addition, the anhepatic
time is longer in the microsuture technique than
with the cuff procedure26,31. On the other hand, the
complications reported with the cuff technique are
blood flow disturbances, with subsequent
thrombosis, and foreign body reaction to the cuff36,49.
However, Kamada et al., who performed rat OLT
530 times over a 5-year period, reported a 95.3%
survival rate of recipient rats50. In our experience,
the long-term (>1 year) survival rate of the liver
graft is 100% in Kamada technique-rat OLT for the
syngeneic donor and recipient combination.
Furthermore, the cuff technique, which reduces the
anhepatic time (to less than 15 minutes) is favored
for livers with a long preservation time26,31,47. A short
duration of the anhepatic phase translates into
successful OLT. The PV clamping time should not
exceed 25 minutes, and IHIVC clamping time should
not exceed 30 to 35 minutes. These time intervals
are the thresholds for splanchnic and systemic
venous cross clamping, beyond which cardiovascular
depression and acid-base imbalances may ensue28,49.
Several modified methods are also introduced for the
reconstruction of SHIVC, IHIVC, and PV. To shorten
the ischemic time, the temporary splint method is
used for the anastomosis of the PV and IHIVC
before the running suture technique (microsuturetemporary splint method)28. The splint method is also
used to reconstruct the SHIVC30. In addition, for the
quick and easy connection of hepatic veins (PV,
IHIVC, and SHIVC), the special Quick-linker kit is
used for their reconstruction31. The methods used for
BD reconstruction include pull-through, telescopic,

splint, and T-tube (Table 1, Fig. 7). For BD
reconstruction, Teflon splints are commonly used,
although the Kamada technique employs the
telescopic technique for BD reconstruction22. To
perform rat OLT more simply and easily and
without complications, further modifications of
surgical techniques will be needed in the future.
HA Reconstruction in Rat OLT
Kamada and coworkers50 have considered arterial
reconstruction in rat OLT to be unnecessary, and,
therefore, the reconstruction is not part of the
Kamada OLT technique. The need for rearterialization varies greatly in different animal
species. Reconstruction of the HA is considered an
important step in liver transplantation in humans
and large animals. Under normal conditions, the HA
supplies at least 50% of the oxygen needed by the
liver, which is essential for energy production and
regulation of metabolism51. Accidental injury,
occlusion, or both of the HA in liver transplantation
in humans often results in graft loss, leading to retransplantation, which is associated with high
mortality rates52―54. In rats, the OLT recipient can
tolerate the operation without arterialization, and
the survival rate is high in these rats50,55. Therefore,
the value of HA reconstruction in rat OLT has been
debated50,55. However, previous studies have clearly
demonstrated that arterialization in rat OLT
increases survival32,35,39, reduces microcirculatory
disorders56, avoids biliary complications35,57 and
histological changes35,41,58, and alters immunologic
responses32,59. Because HA reconstruction is routinely
performed in clinical liver transplantation, we
believe that HA reconstruction in rat OLT is
necessary for the overall analysis of clinical
transplantation.

The Surgical Technique of Rat OLT
J Nippon Med Sch 2013; 80 (1) 13
Various techniques have been developed for
hepatic re-arterialization in rat OLT (Table 2, Fig.
7)
20,32―48. The publications described for rat OLT
include the end-to-side microsuture anastomosis of
the donor aorta, celiac artery, or common HA to the
recipient aorta or proper HA ; end-to-end
microsuture anastomosis of the donor celiac artery
or common HA to the recipient right renal artery
after nephrectomy or common HA; cuff preparation
in the recipient renal artery or the recipient
common HA and connecting the donor aorta,
common HA, or celiac artery; connecting the proper
HA of the donor and the recipient or donor common
HA and recipient aorta with a splint of polyethylene
tubing; and microvascular sleeve anastomosis of the
donor common HA and recipient proper HA or the
celiac artery of the donor and the recipient.
As explained above, our splint technique from the
recipient right renal artery to donor celiac axis
bearing the HA is a simple and short procedure free
of complications. With our method, arterial
reconstruction in rat OLT is easy to perform and is
not associated with prolongation of the entire
procedure or with any harmful effect to the
recipient. Thrombosis of the artery can be
prevented (Fig. 6), and the reconnection procedure
can be performed in seconds. Taking all aspects of
rat OLT into account, we highly recommend the
splint technique using the recipient right renal
artery and the donor celiac axis bearing the HA to
re-establish arterial perfusion of the graft.
Training and Learning Skills
The rat OLT model requires a skilled operator,
and training for OLT is important for successful
transplantation60,61. For complete training before
experimentation, 40 to 50 OLTs per surgeon and
more OLTs per nonsurgeon are necessary47. The
Kamada technique for rat OLT is the standard
method, and the splint technique of HA
reconstruction is a simple procedure that is easy to
learn and technically accessible for surgeons and
nonsurgeons.
Conclusion
In this article, we described the techniques of
Kamada for rat OLT and our recently developed
splint technique for HA reconstruction. Both
techniques are easy to perform and can be
completed within a short period of time without
major complications.
Although the microsuture technique offers the
most physiologic method for anastomoses, a high
level of microsurgical skill is a basic requirement.
The most physiologic techniques are preferred for
long-term survival studies, whereas the faster,
simpler cuff techniques of rat OLT with HA
reconstruction are useful for short-term as well as
long-term survival studies. The procedure to be
selected should be based on the defined study aims.
We have used the rat OLT model to assess the
pathology of liver graft rejection62,63. We anticipate a
wider use of the rat OLT model and further
research on complex issues related to liver
transplantation, such as transplant immunology, and
the mechanisms and treatment of inflammatory liver
disease.
