Abstract
Purpose: We studied the safety, tolerability, virologic, and immunologic effects of mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF) added to a stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the setting of low-level viremia.
Methods: MMF 500 mg BID or placebo was given to patients thought to be adherent on stable
ART with plasma viremia between 200 and 4000 copies/mL. At week 4 unblinding was performed
and patients on placebo were offered open-label MMF.
Results: Six patients were enrolled. At entry mean plasma HIV-1 RNA (VL) was 2.98 log10 copies/
mL; mean CD4 count was 523. All subjects randomized to placebo elected to cross over to open
label MMF. No significant adverse events were observed during MMF therapy. Three patients on
MMF achieved VL < 50 copies/mL by week 4; a fourth had VL decline of > 0.5 log. Two patients on
placebo had declines of VL. One of these had further decline on open label MMF. Cell surface
markers of apoptosis, activation, and proliferation on CD4+ and CD8+ cells declined modestly or
remained low. CD4 counts were stable at week 24. All but one subject had rebound of viremia by
week 24, universally associated with missed doses of medication by pill count.
Conclusion: MMF appears to be safe, and its administration lead to decreased T cell activation.
During periods of adherence to therapy, the use of MMF was correlated with declines in viremia,
but this small pilot study could not prove this association. Further study of MMF in patients with
viremia should be considered for whom additional or alternative antiretrovirals are impractical.
Introduction
The adjunctive use of inhibitors of nucleoside metabolism
may exploit the reliance of HIV-1 on nucleoside pools for
reverse transcription. Further, directly blunting host cell
activation might have clinical benefits in HIV infection.
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a selective and reversible
inhibitor of de novo synthesis of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) [1,2]. MPA's effects are selective for lymphocytes, and it suppresses HIV replication through
guanine depletion [3], increasing the efficacy of several

reverse transcriptase inhibitors in vitro [4-6] and in vivo
[7-10].
We hypothesized that MMF could improve virologic suppression in the setting of low-level viremia, preserving
other antiretroviral agents for future use. We conducted a
placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunologic and virologic effects of the
addition of MMF to an incompletely successful ART regimen. Volunteers with persistent viremia < 4000 but > 200
copies/ml were recruited. We found that MMF appears
safe, and its use was associated with a decreased T cell activation as well as a short-term decline in plasma HIV-1
RNA. However, due to the confounding effect of nonadherence we could not irrefutably attribute the virologic
effect seen to the activity of MMF.
Methods
HIV-infected patients gave IRB-approved consent and
were medically stable at study entry, without history of
opportunistic infection within 12 months. All were on stable antiretroviral therapy including tenofovir, abacavir,
and/or didanosine (agents shown to be potentiated by
MMY in vitro; ref. 6) for ≥ 12 weeks with plasma HIV-1
RNA between 200 and 4000 copies/mL. Patients were
carefully interviewed and felt to be adherent to therapy at
entry by their long-term medical providers. Due to the
theoretical possibility of clinical antagonism between thymidine analogs and MMF [4], patients receiving zidovudine or stavudine allowed to enroll if at least three of the
following mutations had been detected in HIV-1 reverse
transcriptase at a prior genotype: M41L, D67N, K70R,
V75T, L210W, T215F/Y, K219E/Q, K65R, L74V, Q151M.
Patients with AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) grade IV
liver function test abnormalities, grade III or higher renal
insufficiency, grade III or higher leucopenia, or dementia
thought to impair adherence were excluded. Study subjects were prohibited from concurrent use of systemic corticosteroids, hydroxyurea, or other immunosuppressive
medications, cholestyramine, oral contraceptives, and
probenecid or other inhibitors of tubular secretion.
Patients were first randomized to the addition of MMF
500 mg BID (Arm A) or matched placebo (Arm B) to their
antiretroviral regimen (Step 1). Provider interviews and
review of medication refill records were used to assess
patient adherence. After 4 weeks of study therapy,
unblinding was performed and patients on placebo
offered open-label MMF for the remainder of the 24-week
follow-up (Step 2), if they maintained HIV-1 RNA measurements of < 4000 copies/ml. Virologic and immunologic responses, MPA levels, and clinical status were
monitored. Subjects on MMF during Step 1, regardless of
their response to blinded MMF, were given the option of
continued open-label MMF therapy and follow-up, or
study discontinuation.
At each study visit, patients underwent clinical evaluation,
HIV-1 RNA level by Roche Amplicor PCR assay, CD4 lymphocyte counts, hematology, and clinical chemistry
(including serum lactate levels and anion gap analysis).
Blood was also collected for cell surface marker studies.
Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS-Calibur, and
data was analyzed with Cellquest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) to measure expression of CD4, CD8,
Annexin V, CD69, CD38, CD25 and Ki67 on CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells. Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I
(BD Pharmingen) was used for detection of apoptosis.
One million lymphocytes were examined from each study
subject before the therapy was initiated, at weeks 4, 8 and
12 and at week 24 at the end of the therapy.
Results
Six patients meeting the above criteria were enrolled.
Baseline mean plasma HIV-1 RNA (VL) was 2.98 log10
copies/mL (range 1.9–3.9); and mean CD4 count was 523
(range 180–800). All subjects randomized to placebo
elected to cross over to open label MMF. No significant
adverse events were observed during MMF therapy. None
of the patients experienced significant changes in blood
hematocrit, metabolic profile, liver function tests or lipid
profile during protocol therapy.
Four patients were randomized to receive MMF. Three of
these achieved VL < 50 copies/mL by week 4, and elected
to enter Step 2 of the study. One subject did not have a significant decline of plasma HIV-1 RNA on blinded MMF,
and left the study after week 4. One patient on placebo
had a significant decline of VL of > 0.5 log. This subject
had a further VL decline of > 0.5 log copies/ml during Step
II while receiving open-label MMF.
There was no significant change in mean CD4 count (422/
mL at week 24) in subjects receiving MMF. All but one
subject had rebound of viremia by week 24, universally
associated with missed doses of medication by pill count.
As observed in previous studies, average MPA AUC measured at week 4 was 19.40 (range 18.79–19.90) regardless
of antiretroviral regimen [8,11].
The administration of low-dose MMF might decrease T
cell activation, either by a direct immunomodulatory
effect, or secondarily via an antiviral effect [7-10]. However, MMF has also been reported to induce apoptosis in
the setting of HIV infection [10], although this effect may
only be seen in activated cells [7,12]. Patient M4 received
HAART and blinded MMF during Step 1 but did not display a virologic response. However, the Ki67, CD69,

CD38 and CD25 levels declined while he was receiving
MMF.
Subjects P1 and P2 received HAART and placebo during
Step 1, and then HAART and open-label MMF during Step
2. These subjects had a decline in viral load during Step 1,
presumably due to study-related improvements in adherence. While on open-label MMF, pill counts suggested
non-adherence, correlated with a loss of virologic
response. Levels of annexin and Ki67 decreased initially,
but returned to baseline levels with the loss of virologic
response. However, CD69 and CD25 levels declined
somewhat and remained suppressed despite the loss of
virologic response. In P1 the level of CD38 on CD8 cells
also remained low despite viral rebound, whereas in P2
this marker increased after viral rebound.
Subject M1 displayed a gradual and persistent response to
MMF during the course of the study. Annexin and Ki67
levels also declined during observation. However, activation markers increased at week 24. M3 and M2 received
blinded MMF during the first 4 weeks of study, with
declines in viremia. Annexin and Ki67 levels decreased
initially, and surface levels of CD69, CD38 and CD25
remained low and stable. Both subjects lost virologic
response; and non-adherence was simultaneously
observed by pill count. During this time, while open-label
MMF and HAART was prescribed but apparently taken
irregularly, small but variable increases in Annexin and
Ki67 were seen, as well as moderate increases in CD69,
CD38 and CD25 levels in patient M2.
Discussion
In total therefore, MMF induced a persistent decrease in T
cell activation in all but one patient (Fig 1A and 1B). Associated with suboptimal treatment adherence, virologic
response was not durable in this patient population. The
clinical scenario of partially successfully ART, similar to
those screened for this study, is not uncommon. Treatment strategies for this group of patients are not well
defined.
Continued therapy despite low-level viremia in the setting
of drug resistance may be beneficial. Mutations conferring
resistance to antiretroviral drugs commonly lower viral
replicative capacity, and may blunt viremia In some
treated patients [13,14]. Clinical and immunologic benefits can be maintained in patients with partial virologic
suppression [15,16]. However, when partially effective
treatment is continued, slow accumulation of resistance

mutations may lead to increased viremia, and may jeopardize future treatment options. It is also reasonable to
question whether continued exposure to the toxicity of
multiple drugs is warranted in the face of limited virologic
and immunologic response. A second approach in the
face of partially effective antiretroviral therapy is the
intensification of therapy. The risks of this approach
include the development of resistance to the newly added
antiretroviral(s), and cumulative toxicities.
A third option might be the use of an agent like MMF as a
"stopgap" measure in patients without full virologic suppression who require antiviral therapy, but in whom
active antivirals are not desired due to nonadherence, or
not available due to drug resistance. Our data show a
blunting of CD3+ cell activation in weeks 4 through 24,
despite loss of virologic response in some patients. This,
together with an absence in CD4 decline under MMF therapy is consistent with finding by other investigators in different settings [17-19].
It is possible that viral resistance to MMF might develop
over time. One mechanism for this might be a shift in viral
replication away from activagted lymphocytes and monocytes to cell types with lower levels of dependence on
IMPDH type I, e.g. resting CD4+ T cells. However, substantial levels of viral replication in such cell populations.
Alternatively, HIV RT could evolve higher affinity for
native dGTP substrates. Three subjects responding to
MMF initiated at the time of antiretroviral optimization
during during our initial study [8] elected to extend MMF
therapy under IRB oversight. Continued response to salvage therapy that including MMF, as measured by at least
0.5 log10 suppression of viral load and CD4 cell count stability, was observed for 27, 30, and 33 months, respectively prior to the clinical need for re-optimization of
therapy. Only one patient developed a single new RT
mutation during this time, although several changes in
protease were observed.
In summary, in a short-term evaluation, MMF appears to
be safe its use was associated with decreased T cell activation but the effect on VL suppression was not clearly ascertained, due to intermittent non-adherence to therapy
during this study. Consistent with previous reports [7-
10,17-19], we found no clinically significant cytopenias
during MMF therapy. MMF has the potential to improve
antiretroviral treatment response as well as delay virologic
rebound. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the
clinical efficacy of MMF will require a larger or a longer
controlled study, due in part to the many factors which
blunt treatment efficacy in patients with partially suppressed viremia.
