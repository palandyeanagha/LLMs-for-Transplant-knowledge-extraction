Abstract
Background Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using
transient elastography (FibroScan) reflects the degree of
hepatic fibrosis. This prospective study investigated how
well LSM predicts the development of hepatic insufficiency
after curative liver resection surgery for hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Methods The study enrolled 72 consecutive patients who
underwent a preoperative LSM to assess the degree of liver
fibrosis followed by curative liver resection surgery for
hepatocellular carcinoma between July 2006 and December
2007. The primary end point was the development of
hepatic insufficiency.
Results The mean age of the patients was 54.9 years.
Twenty patients (27.7%) had chronic hepatitis and 52
(72.3%) had cirrhosis (44 and 8 patients showed ChildPugh class A and B, respectively). The mean LSM was
17.1 kPa. Twelve patients (16.6%) had segmentectomy
only, 16 patients (22.2%) had bisegmentectomy, and 44
patients (61.2%) had lobectomy. Nine patients (12.5%) had
stage I tumor, 56 (77.7%) had stage II, and 7 (9.8%) had
stage III. Univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses
revealed that preoperative LSM was the only independent
risk factor for predicting the development of postoperative
hepatic insufficiency (cutoff, 25.6 kPa; P = 0.001; relative
risk, 19.14; 95% confidence interval, 2.71–135.36).
Conclusions LSM is potentially useful to predict the
development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency in
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing curative
liver resection surgery.

Introduction
With considerable improvements in perioperative intensive
care and refinements in surgical technique, the rates of
death and complications after major liver resection surgery
have decreased significantly [1–4]. Nevertheless, because
many patients still have liver cirrhosis or other chronic
liver disease, death and complications may follow liver
resection surgery. Therefore, it is important to investigate
the functional liver reserve before liver resection surgery
[5–7]. The Child-Pugh scoring system is widely used to

determine the hepatic functional status, although its ability
to predict mortality after liver resection surgery is inconsistent. Consequently, various laboratory and imaging
techniques have been used to complement the Child-Pugh
scoring system in order to predict the development of
postoperative hepatic insufficiency. For example, the
serum hyaluronic acid (HA) level, liver volumetry measured using computed tomographic (CT) scan, hepatic
uptake ratio of technetium-99m-diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid galactosyl-human serum albumin at 15 min
(LHL 15), indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min (ICG
R15), and hepatic venous pressure gradient are usually
performed [8–10]. These preoperative tests are important
because they allow physicians to decide the extent of liver
resection [11]. Such careful preoperative evaluation of liver
function together with the refined operating techniques has
significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative hepatic
insufficiency [12–14].
Of these preoperative functional tests, hepatic venous
pressure gradient is a widely used preoperative test to
estimate the degree of hepatic fibrosis and liver reserve in
Western countries, whereas ICG R15 is used in Eastern
countries including Korea and Japan. However, ICG R15
remains imperfect because of its dependency on both the
hepatic flow and the functional capacity of the liver [15].
Recently, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using FibroScan was reported to reflect the degree of hepatic fibrosis,
which is an important factor determining the functional
liver reserve [16]. Therefore, we hypothesized that LSM
can predict the hepatic functional reserve.
This prospective study investigated the usefulness of
LSM as a predictor of the liver reserve.
Patients and methods
Patients
In this pilot study, 91 consecutive patients who were eligible for curative liver resection surgery for hepatocellular
carcinoma between July 2006 and December 2007 at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine,
Seoul, Republic of Korea, were enrolled prospectively.
Patients who underwent surgery because of causes other
than hepatocellular carcinoma or had Child-Pugh class C
liver function were excluded.
Among all enrolled patients, 19 patients who underwent
liver transplantation were also excluded. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Severance
Hospital.
The primary end point was the development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency. Hepatic insufficiency was
defined as persistent hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin
level [5 mg/dl) for more than 5 days after surgery or
postoperative death without other causes [17, 18].
Liver stiffness measurement
On the same day that the ICG R15 test was performed,
liver stiffness in the right lobe of the liver was measured,
using FibroScan, through the intercostal spaces with the
patient lying in the dorsal decubitus position and with the
right arm in maximal abduction. The tip of the transducer
probe was covered with coupling gel and placed on the skin
between the ribs at the level of the right lobe of the liver.
Before performing FibroScan in all patients, sonographic
evaluation was used to target nontumor liver parenchyma.
The operator, assisted by real time ultrasound, located a
liver portion that was at least 6-cm thick and free of large
vascular structures, and then pressed the probe button to
commence the measurements. Ten validated measurements
were performed on each patient. The success rate was
calculated as the number of validated measurements divided by the total number of measurements. The results were
expressed in kilopascals (kPa). The median value was
considered as representative of the elastic modulus of the
liver. Only procedures with ten validated measurements
and a success rate of at least 60% were considered reliable.
ICG R15 evaluation
After an overnight fast, 0.5 mg/kg of ICG was administered
intravenously. Blood samples were drawn at 5, 10, and
15 min and the plasma ICG concentration was measured
spectrophotometrically (710 nm). The plasma retention rate
at 15 min (ICG R15, %) and the plasma disappearance rate
(ICG-k, min-1
) were calculated.
Liver resection surgery
All the patients were examined to confirm the number, size,
location, and extent of the tumor and the existence of
distant metastases by abdominal ultrasonography, CT scan,
magnetic resonance imaging, hepatic angiography, and
positron emission tomography. In addition to preoperative
routine laboratory examinations and physical examination
for determining Child-Pugh classification, ICG R15 was
performed to determine the optimal treatment strategy.
Anatomical resection was performed according to tumor
size, location, and liver reserve function. Indications for
hepatic resection and the types of operative procedures
were mainly determined on the basis of the criteria of
Makuuchi, i.e., the presence or absence of ascites, the
serum total bilirubin level, and ICG R15 [19]. All liver
resection surgeries were performed by two surgeons
472 Hepatol Int (2008) 2:471–477
123

(J.S. Choi and K.S. Kim) and followed the anatomic definitions of segments and lobes of Couinaud [20]. Patients
routinely underwent intraoperative ultrasonography to
determine tumor localization and extent and to exclude the
presence of additional lesions in the residual liver.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics are given as the mean ± SD or
median (range). Continuous variables were compared using
an independent t-test and categorical variables were compared using v2
-test. A two-sided P-value\0.05 was
considered significant.
Variables associated with the development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency were first assessed using a
univariate analysis. Then, the variables that were significant (P\0.1) were subjected to multivariate logistic
regression analysis to identify the independent predictors
for the development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency.
The optimal cutoff value for liver stiffness was set as the
value maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity.
The predictive ability of LSM and ICG R15 was assessed
by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and
corresponding area under the ROC (AUROC) curve for
each. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
12.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
The baseline characteristics of the patients are summarized
in Table 1. The mean age of the 72 patients (56 men and 16
women) was 54.9 years. The surgical specimens of the 72
hepatocellular carcinomas revealed a background of
chronic hepatitis in 20 cases (27.7%) and cirrhosis in 52
cases (72.3%). Forty-four patients had Child-Pugh class A
and eight had class B. The mean liver stiffness value was
17.1 kPa and the mean ICG R15 was 11.8%. There were no
dropouts due to LSM failure.
Operation and tumor characteristics
Twelve patients (16.6%) had segmentectomy only, 16
patients (22.2%) had bisegmentectomy, and 44 patients
(61.2%) had lobectomy. According to the Tumor-NodeMetastasis stage of the modified Union Internationale
Contre le Cancer (UICC) staging system, 9 patients
(12.5%) had stage I tumor, 56 patients (77.7%) had
stage II tumor, and 7 patients (9.8%) had stage III tumor
(Table 2).
Comparison between patients with and without
postoperative hepatic insufficiency
Seven patients had hepatic insufficiency postoperatively,
and there was no mortality associated with liver resection
surgery. Surgical specimens of those with postoperative
hepatic insufficiency revealed that all of them had liver
cirrhosis. The seven patients who developed postoperative
hepatic insufficiency after curative liver resection surgery
had a significantly higher mean LSM before surgery
(26.8 ± 9.5 kPa) than those without postoperative hepatic
insufficiency (15.1 ± 10.5, P = 0.010). The other tested
variables affecting liver function did not differ statistically
between the groups (Table 3).
All patients who developed hepatic insufficiency postoperatively decompensated with ascites.

Prediction accuracy of LSM and ICG R15
In order to compare the predictive value of LSM and ICG
R15, we first analyzed ROC curve of LSM and R15
(Fig. 1). Corresponding AUROC curve was 0.824 (95%
confidence interval, 0.682–0.967; P = 0.007) for LSM and
0.620 (95% confidence interval, 0.422–0.819; P = 0.319)
for the ICG R15, respectively. The cutoff of LSM was set
at 25.6 kPa, which gave the best statistical accuracy (sensitivity, 71.4%; specificity, 88.6%; positive predictive
value, 55.6%; and negative predictive value, 93.9%).
Analyses for identifying the risk factors predicting
development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency
Table 4 lists the results of the univariate and subsequent
multivariate logistic regression analyses for identifying the
various clinicopathologic factors associated with postoperative hepatic insufficiency.
Multivariate analysis identified LSM as the only significant predictor of postoperative hepatic insufficiency
(cutoff 25.6 kPa, P = 0.001; relative risk, 19.14; 95%
confidence interval, 2.71–135.36).
Discussion
Liver transplantation, liver resection, and local ablation
therapy are curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. Among them, liver transplantation is the best option
because it is the only treatment that offers a chance of cure
for hepatocellular carcinoma and the underlying cirrhosis
by complete extirpation of both. However, the limitation of
organ supply remains unresolved. Therefore, liver resection
surgery for curative goal is widely performed instead of
liver transplantation regardless of restriction of its application to a liver with limited functional reserve and high
chance of recurrence in the liver remnant [21].

Because surgery removes parts of the functioning liver,
the volume of the remnant liver determines the risk of
postoperative hepatic insufficiency, which is the major
cause of mortality and morbidity after liver resection surgery, especially in the cirrhotic liver.
The lack of well-designed, randomized, controlled trials,
the use of different staging systems, and the different
definitions of postoperative hepatic insufficiency have led
to the confusion in the analysis of postoperative outcomes
for liver resection surgery [22]. Careful preoperative
evaluation of the functional liver reserve is necessary to
minimize the postoperative morbidity and mortality in
cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients [12, 13]. Several preoperative tests are available for such purposes, including
the serum HA assay, liver volumetry using CT scan, LHL
15, ICG R15, and hepatic venous pressure gradient [8–10].
Of these, the ICG R15 is the most reliable and widely
available test to determine the extent of liver resection and
liver reserve function in Eastern countries [12]. Although,
the ICG R15 has some limitations because it depends on
both the hepatic flow and the functional capacity of the
liver, there is general agreement concerning the retention
value [15].
Poon et al. [23] assessed the patient suitability for liver
resection surgery by evaluating the Child-Pugh score
combined with ICG R15 measurements; in their study, the
occurrence of hepatic failure was 1%. Torzilli et al. [4]
reported a preoperative evaluation pattern for liver resection surgery, which included the presence of ascites, serum
bilirubin levels, and estimation of the ICG R15, and
reported no mortality after liver resection in 107 patients.
Recently, LSM has been shown to reflect the degree of
hepatic fibrosis, which is an important determinant of the
development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency [16].
Therefore, we postulated that LSM could be used to predict
postoperative hepatic insufficiency before liver resection
surgery. In order to test this hypothesis, we compared the
abilities of LSM and ICG R15 in predicting the

development of hepatic insufficiency after curative liver
resection surgery. Although several studies have already
reported the correlation between intraoperative liver consistency using specific probes and postoperative outcome
[24–26], to the best of our knowledge, no other study has
investigated LSM as a preoperative evaluation for predicting the development of postoperative hepatic
insufficiency after liver resection surgery, compared with
the relationship for ICG R15.
In this study, the cutoff liver stiffness value was set at
25.6 kPa, which gave the best accuracy. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis revealed that LSM was the
only independent predictor of the development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency. In terms of the AUROC
for predicting hepatic insufficiency, the value for LSM
was greater than that for the ICG R15. Therefore, in our
study population, LSM was better than the ICG R15 in
predicting the development of postoperative hepatic
insufficiency.
We are aware of several limitations of our study. First,
the multivariate logistic regression analysis did not include
other variables that can affect the outcome of surgery, such
as the serum HA level, which is closely correlated with the
functional liver reserve and is a useful predictor of liver
regeneration [27], or the total or resected liver volume
measured using CT scan. Second, there were some factors
differently represented between who showed hepatic
insufficiency and who did not, such as total bilirubin level,
bleeding amount, operation time, and the portion of
undergoing lobectomy, although there were no statistical
differences between the two groups. These points might
influence the final results. Finally, because all enrolled
patients showed chronic liver disease status, the results of
this study are not applicable to patients without chronic
liver disease. In order to overcome these limitations, a
well-designed, well-controlled, randomized study of a
large population is required.
In conclusion, our study showed that preoperative LSM
was significantly higher in patients who developed postoperative hepatic insufficiency than in those patients who
did not. Therefore, our results suggest that the preoperative
liver stiffness is a potentially useful predictor of the
development of postoperative hepatic insufficiency in
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing liver
resection surgery.
