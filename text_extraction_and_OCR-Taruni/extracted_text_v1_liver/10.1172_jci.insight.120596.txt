Introduction
Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a highly inducible enzyme in heme catabolism (1), exerts potent cytoprotective, antiapoptotic, and antiinflammatory functions (2). We and others have shown that HO-1 expression 
plays a beneficial role in vascular inflammatory processes, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), organ 
transplantation, and atherosclerosis (3–6). In contrast, under chronic metabolic conditions, HO-1 may 
promote inflammation (meta-inflammation) instead (7), suggesting that HO-1’s role in the inflammatory 
response might be disease dependent. Therefore, understanding the HO-1 mechanisms under specific settings, whether antiinflammatory or proinflammatory, is of paramount importance.
Macrophages, the principal mediators of innate immune reactivity, can be divided into distinct subtypes owing to their high plasticity (2). Classically activated macrophages (M1) are proinflammatory, while 
alternatively activated macrophages (M2) harbor an antiinflammatory phenotype, often after upregulation 
of HO-1 (8, 9). Increasing evidence supports the importance of M1/M2 polarization in tissue injury and 
repair in liver (10), heart (11), and kidney (12). In addition, it has been reported that resolvin D1 (13) 
and microRNA-155 deficiency (14) ameliorate liver IRI by inducing M2 polarization. On the other hand, 
microenvironments characterized by high levels of oxidized lipids (e.g., atherosclerotic plaques) or the 
presence of blood (e.g., intraplaque hemorrhage) lead to the development of other macrophage subtypes, 
such as Mox (15) and Mhem (16), respectively, also characterized by high HO-1 expression levels. Whether 
HO-1 induction plays a determinant role in macrophage differentiation/polarization or is merely responsive to macrophage stimulation in IRI and other processes warrants attention.
Macrophages polarize into heterogeneous proinflammatory M1 and antiinflammatory M2 subtypes. 
Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) protects against inflammatory processes such as ischemia-reperfusion 
injury (IRI), organ transplantation, and atherosclerosis. To test our hypothesis that HO-1 regulates 
macrophage polarization and protects against IRI, we generated myeloid-specific HO-1–knockout 
(mHO-1–KO) and –transgenic (mHO-1–Tg) mice, with deletion or overexpression of HO-1, in various 
macrophage populations. Bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mHO-1–KO mice, 
treated with M1-inducing LPS or M2-inducing IL-4, exhibited increased mRNA expression of M1 
(CXCL10, IL-1β, MCP1) and decreased expression of M2 (Arg1 and CD163) markers as compared with 
controls, while BMDMs from mHO-1–Tg mice displayed the opposite. A similar pattern was observed 
in the hepatic M1/M2 expression profile in a mouse model of liver IRI. mHO-1–KO mice displayed 
increased hepatocellular damage, serum AST/ALT levels, Suzuki’s histological score of liver IRI, and 
neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, while mHO-1–Tg mice exhibited the opposite. In human 
liver transplant biopsies, subjects with higher HO-1 levels showed lower expression of M1 markers 
together with decreased hepatocellular damage and improved outcomes. In conclusion, myeloid 
HO-1 expression modulates macrophage polarization, and protects against liver IRI, at least in part 
by favoring an M2 phenotype.

RESEARCH ARTICLE
IRI is an acute process that invariably occurs after reopening of the artery following vascular occlusions 
caused by thromboembolic events and during organ transplantation. It involves a local innate immune sterile inflammation-dominated response, driven by a cascade of free radicals, specifically reactive oxygen species (ROS) that ensue upon reintroduction of oxygen into the ischemic tissues. The degree of tissue damage 
depends on the extent and duration of the ischemia, the magnitude of the inflammatory response, mostly 
comprised of infiltrating macrophages and neutrophils, and the upregulation of cytoprotective mechanisms 
(17, 18). We have previously reported that HO-1 is highly induced after liver IRI and that global HO-1 deficiency, as in systemic HO-1 heterozygous knockout mice, results in marked enhancement of hepatic IRI 
(19). In the current study, we have used conditional myeloid-specific HO-1–knockout (mHO-1–KO) and 
HO-1–transgenic (mHO-1–Tg) overexpressing mice to focus on the role of myeloid-specific HO-1 expression in macrophage differentiation/polarization and putative protection from liver IRI.
Results
mHO-1–KO mice exhibit full deletion of HO-1 in macrophages. We developed mHO-1–KO mice to evaluate 
the effect of HO-1 deletion on macrophage polarization, using a stepwise breeding strategy of floxed 
HO-1–KO and LysM-Cre–Tg mice (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with 
this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.120596DS1). Schemes for the genomic structures of the 
constructs employed in the generation of floxed HO-1–KO and LysM-Cre–Tg mice are shown in Figure 
1A. mHO-1–KO mice were made homozygous for both floxed HO-1–KO and Cre alleles (HO-1–KOfl/fl, 
LysM-Cre+/+) while their controls were homozygous for the floxed HO-1–KO allele without the Cre allele 
(HO-1–KOfl/fl, LysM-Cre–/–). We screened for HO-1 deletion efficiency in peritoneal macrophages (PMs), 
alveolar macrophages (AMs), and bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) by dsRED fluorescence 
microscopy. All these cell types exhibited red fluorescence, indicating effective deletion of HO-1 (Figure 1B 
and Supplemental Figure 2), which was confirmed in AMs, PMs, and BMDMs by real-time PCR (Figure 
1C), and total absence of HO-1 protein by immunoblot analysis in BMDMs (Figure 1D). We also evaluated HO-1 mRNA expression in a panel of tissues that included liver, spleen, kidneys, lung, and heart using 
carboxyl-terminal–specific primers and probes to assess the contribution of myeloid deletion of HO-1 at an 
organ level. There were trends toward lower HO-1 mRNA levels, albeit not statistically significant, in whole 
homogenates of liver (P = 0.095) and spleen (P = 0.056) from mHO-1–KO mice as compared with controls. 
This indicates that the differences in macrophage HO-1 expression in mHO-1–KO mice were buffered by 
HO-1 expression in other cells that were not of myeloid origin (e.g., hepatocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells). Interestingly, that buffering must have been of a smaller degree in the lung and heart where 
differences in HO-1 expression remained significant (P < 0.01) in whole tissues (Supplemental Figure 3).
HO-1 deletion in myeloid cells promotes M1 polarization and exacerbates liver IRI. To determine whether HO-1 
expression regulates macrophage differentiation/polarization ex vivo, we cultured BMDMs from mHO-1–
KO mice and their respective controls, with LPS (100 ng/ml, for 6 hours), an M1-polarizing regimen, and 
IL-4 (10 ng/ml, for 24 hours), an M2-polarizing regimen. We found that after treatment with LPS, HO-1–
deficient BMDMs exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) increased mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory 
M1 markers (CCXL10, IL-1β, and MCP1) (Figure 2A), with simultaneously decreased levels of antiinflammatory M2 markers (Arg1 and CD163) as compared with controls (Figure 2A). Likewise, HO-1–deficient 
BMDMs displayed lower mRNA levels of M2 markers after treatment with IL-4 (Figure 2B).
We then tested whether HO-1 deletion would affect macrophage polarization in vivo in a model of warm 
liver IRI, where macrophage phenotypes play a critical role in the degree of tissue damage and repair (10). 
Groups of mHO-1–KO and control mice were subjected to partial (75%) warm hepatic IRI for 90 minutes. As 
compared with controls, at 6 hours of reperfusion, livers from mHO-1–KO mice exhibited increased mRNA 
levels of M1 (CCXL10, IL-1β, and MCP1) and decreased mRNA levels of M2 (Arg1 and CD163) markers 
(Figure 2C), similar to findings ex vivo, indicating that HO-1 deletion favored M1 programming under IR stress.
M1 polarization, exacerbated by myeloid HO-1 deletion, was accompanied by increased hepatic 
IR damage. Thus, mHO-1–KO mice displayed increased necrotic area in the liver as determined by 
H&E staining (Figure 3A), higher Suzuki histological scores of the hepatocellular damage (4.2 ± 0.37 
in controls [n = 5] vs. 8 ± 0.55 in mHO-1–KO mice [n = 4]) (Figure 3B), and increased serum levels of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (controls: 11,179 ± 1,904 IU/l [n = 5] vs. mHO-1–KO: 26,232 ± 2,058 
IU/l [n = 5]) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (controls: 11,978 ± 643.6 IU/l [n = 5] vs. mHO1–KO: 16,679 ± 1,577 IU/l [n = 5]) (Figure 3B). In addition, mHO-1–KO mice exhibited increased

hepatic infiltration by macrophages and neutrophils, as evidenced by immunofluorescence staining of 
CD11b and Ly6G, respectively (Figure 3A), and quantification of macrophages (controls: 41.3 ± 1.6 vs. 
mHO-1–KO: 64.2 ± 2.3 cells/high-power field [HPF], n = 4 per group) and neutrophils (controls: 37.1 
± 1.4 vs. mHO-1–KO: 54.6 ± 2.4 cells/HPF, n = 4 per group) (Figure 3C) per microscopic field. Overall, 
our data indicate that myeloid-specific HO-1 deletion exacerbated M1 polarization, local inflammatory 
response, and the severity of liver IRI.
mHO-1–overexpressing mice exhibit increased HO-1 in macrophages. To examine the effects induced by higher 
baseline HO-1 expression in myeloid cells, we developed mHO-1–overexpressing mice by breeding mHO-1 
floxed Tg mice (Figure 4A) with LysM-Cre–Tg mice (Figure 1A), as described in the Methods section and 
in Supplemental Figure 1. Degenerate primers and their corresponding Roche universal probes were used to 
assess mouse, human, and total HO-1 (murine HO-1 + human HO-1) mRNA expression in AMs by real-time 
qPCR (Supplemental Table 2). Total HO-1 expression was significantly higher in mHO-1–Tg cells due to the 
exclusive expression of the human HO-1 transgene in these cells, in spite of a mild downregulation of the

endogenous mouse HO-1 gene in mHO-1–Tg cells as compared with controls (Figure 4B). HO-1 overexpression was further confirmed at the protein level by immunoblotting. Total HO-1 protein levels were increased 
in AMs as well as BMDMs from mHO-1–Tg mice as compared with controls (Figure 4C). Changes in 
myeloid HO-1 overexpression did not affect overall HO-1 levels in whole organs, as there were not significant 
differences in total HO-1 mRNA expression in liver, spleen, kidneys, lung, and heart (Supplemental Figure 4).
HO-1 overexpression in myeloid cells regulates macrophage polarization and attenuates liver IRI. We cultured 
BMDMs from mHO-1–Tg mice or controls, and then treated them with LPS or IL-4, similar to how we 
treated cells from mHO-1–KO mice. Tg BMDMs displayed decreased expression of proinflammatory M1 
but increased mRNA levels coding for antiinflammatory M2 markers as compared with controls, after LPS 
treatment (Figure 5A). Likewise, Tg BMDMs displayed increased M2 marker expression levels (P < 0.05) 
when compared with controls, after treatment with IL-4 (Figure 5B), indicating that increased HO-1 baseline 
expression favored M2 polarization ex vivo. We then tested effects induced by myeloid HO-1 overexpression 
on macrophage polarization in vivo, using the model of warm liver IRI. In contrast to the mHO-1–KO livers, the opposite patterns occurred in mHO-1–Tg livers, which exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) decreased 
mRNA levels of M1 markers (CXCL10, IL-1β, and MCP1) but increased mRNA levels of M2 markers 
(Arg1 and CD163) as compared with controls (Figure 5C). Overall, these data suggest that myeloid-specific 
baseline HO-1 overexpression inhibited M1 in favor of M2 polarization in IR-stressed livers.
HO-1–induced M2 polarization was accompanied by decreased hepatic damage following partial warm 
liver IRI. mHO-1–Tg mice exhibited decreased hepatic necrotic area by H&E staining (Figure 6A) and lower 
Suzuki histological scores of liver tissue damage (control: 4.2 ± 0.31 [n = 6] vs. mHO-1–Tg: 1.6 ± 0.24 [n = 5]).

In addition, mHO-1–Tg mice had decreased serum ALT (control: 11,867 ± 1,368 IU/l [n = 6] vs. mHO-1–Tg: 
6,413 ± 1,481 IU/l [n = 7]) and AST (control: 12,590 ± 614.9 IU/l [n = 6] vs. mHO-1–Tg 5,656 ± 1,909 IU/l

significantly ameliorated inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatocellular injury in IRI-stressed livers.
HO-1 levels in human liver transplants correlate with IR-hepatocellular M1/M2 gene expression pattern. To 
determine whether HO-1 expression influences macrophage polarization in humans, we examined the

liver biopsies collected from 21 adult primary orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients, at approximately 2 hours after reperfusion. Samples were divided into low (n = 11) versus high (n = 10) HO-1 
mRNA expression groups. We previously reported that subjects characterized by low HO-1 protein 
expression at postoperative day 1 exhibited higher serum ALT levels (P < 0.05), higher cleaved caspase 
3 (P < 0.05), increased frequency of TUNEL+ cells, and decreased cumulative survival time with a 
median of 712 days (range from 27 to 1,009 days) (20). These results indicate that depressed postreperfusion HO-1 protein levels were associated with a more pronounced hepatocellular damage in 
human OLT. In the current study, we have contrasted the macrophage polarization pattern in the low 
versus high HO-1 expression in liver transplant biopsy samples. Indeed, 2 of the M1 markers that were 
assessed, CXCL10 and CD80 (Figure 7A), were both significantly decreased in the high HO-1 expression biopsy group as compared with the low HO-1 biopsy group (P < 0.05). In addition, there were 
clear trends, which however failed to reach statistical significance, for decreased expression of other 
M1 markers (IL-1β and MCP1) and somewhat higher expression of M2 markers (Arg1 and CD163) in 
the high HO-1 recipient group (Figure 7A). There were also negative, albeit not significant, correlations

with high HO-1 mRNA were characterized by lower CD80 and higher CD206 expression as compared 
with biopsies from the low HO-1 group (Figure 8).
Discussion
This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrating that myeloid HO-1 expression regulates 
macrophage polarization and protects against liver IRI, at least in part, by favoring an M2 antiinflammatory phenotype. A mouse model for myeloid-specific HO-1 overexpression was screened in parallel with 
myeloid-specific HO-1–deficient mice in a preclinical hepatic IRI model, broadly relevant to many pathological states. In addition, prospective human liver transplant screening indicates that HO-1 levels in hepatic biopsies were associated with proinflammatory endpoints and long-term outcomes.
Macrophages are key mediators for native and adaptive inflammatory responses. Classically activated M1 
macrophages and alternatively activated M2 macrophages exhibit phenotypes that favor proinflammatory

and antiinflammatory responses, respectively (2). We assessed the role of HO-1 in macrophage polarization by testing the M1/M2 expression profile of BMDMs from mHO-1–KO and mHO-1–Tg mice versus 
respective controls, and then used an established mouse model of warm liver IRI, to test the relevance of 
macrophage polarization to in vivo outcomes. In this model, HO-1 is predominantly expressed in macrophages of IR-inflamed liver (Supplemental Figure 6), suggesting that macrophage HO-1 is pivotal for 
cytoprotection against liver IRI. Thus, we analyzed the expression of M1 (CXCL10, IL-1β, and MCP1) 
and M2 (Arg1 and CD163) markers in IR-stressed livers. Those from mHO-1–KO mice exhibited an 
expression pattern for increased M1 but decreased M2 markers, while livers from mHO-1–Tg mice displayed the opposite molecular signature. Likewise, LPS-induced M1 polarization was enhanced in BMDMs from mHO-1–KO mice but reduced in mHO-1–Tg cells. In contrast, IL-4–mediated M2 polarization 
was favored by HO-1 overexpression. While our study did not specifically delineate the polarization

profile of liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells), it is plausible that HO-1 expression in these cells 
would lead to phenotypes similar to those observed in vitro. Our previous study identified increased frequency of circulating macrophages compared with that of Kupffer cells in IR-stressed mouse livers (21). 
Indeed, Devey et al. reported that Kupffer cells are important in the protection against liver IRI in a rat 
model (22). Current data extend our previous report in which adoptive transfer of HO-1–overexpressing 
BMDMs suppressed the M1 phenotype and proinflammatory gene expression profile observed otherwise in Nrf2-deficient mice (23), with Nrf2 being an important transcription factor that regulates HO-1 
expression. On the other hand, HO-1 is highly upregulated in Mox (15) and Mhem (16) phenotypes as 
well, raising the possibility that HO-1 expression in M2 macrophages could be an epiphenomenon rather 
than a causal mediator. In the current study, our data derived from myeloid-specific HO-1–Tg and –KO 
mice clearly indicate that HO-1 expression drives M2 polarization and inhibits hepatic IRI, whereas its 
deficiency promotes IR-induced M1 polarization and exacerbates hepatic IR damage.
We have previously shown that HO-1 heterozygous KO mice had worse liver IRI outcomes, indicating that globally decreased HO-1 levels augmented IR-triggered hepatocellular damage (19). This could 
be due to cytoprotective HO-1 actions in hepatocytes or antiinflammatory effects in liver-infiltrating cells 
such as macrophages and neutrophils. In the murine model of cardiac transplantation, we have reported 
that global HO-1 overexpression in the recipients had improved graft survival to a much larger degree than 
local HO-1 overexpression in the donor hearts (5), suggesting a prominent host HO-1 immunomodulatory function. In this study, we have developed myeloid-specific genetically modified mice to dissect the

role of myeloid HO-1 function in hepatocellular damage induced by partial warm ischemia followed by 
reperfusion. We found that myeloid-specific HO-1 deficiency exacerbated liver IRI and hepatic infiltration 
by macrophages and neutrophils, while increased HO-1 expression in Tg mice resulted in the amelioration 
of liver injury. This is consistent with comparable outcomes in the model of kidney IRI (24, 25) where 
genetically induced HO-1 overexpression (24) or HO-1 induction by hemin administration (25) ameliorated IR damage, effects that were blunted when HO-1 had been deleted in myeloid cells (25). Importantly, 
our study enabled us to determine that HO-1–mediated protection was largely due to effects on myeloid 
functions. However, mHO-1–Tg mice are not direct counterparts to mHO-1–KO mice; myeloid cells from 
mHO-1–KO mice lacked HO-1 prior to, at the onset of, and following IR without any possibility of 
mounting an HO-1 response. This led to overall baseline HO-1 expression that was significantly lower 
(lungs and heart) or trended to be lower (liver, spleen, and kidneys) in KOs as compared with controls 
(Supplemental Figure 3). In contrast, both Tg and controls were capable of upregulating mouse HO-1 in 
response to IR, so the critical difference was the constitutive overexpression exhibited by Tg myeloid cells 
at baseline, prior to the IR insult. The difference in overall HO-1 expression in myeloid cells between Tg 
and controls was much smaller than that exhibited by KOs versus controls, which was reflected by the lack 
of trends or any significant difference in HO-1 overall expression in tissues tested (Supplemental Figure 
4). In the study by Rossi et al., administration of hemin 24 hours prior to the kidney IR induced HO-1 
expression in CD11b+F4/80lo myeloid cells, putative mediators of HO-1 protection (25). However, hemin 
was expected to induce HO-1 in a large variety of cells, not only those of the myeloid lineage. In this study, 
we are certain that HO-1 was constitutively overexpressed at baseline in mHO-1–Tg mice, only in myeloid 
cells, although we cannot rule out paracrine actions since HO-1 enzymatic byproducts, such as carbon 
monoxide, could have been released from infiltrating macrophages and alter neighbor hepatocytes. Our 
results are consistent with our previous report showing that adoptive transfer of BMDMs overexpressing 
HO-1 improved survival of cold-stored mouse OLTs (23). This is also relevant to the clinical organ transplantation setting where HO-1 expression could be induced in the recipient prior to transplant surgery. 
Taken together, our data highlight the antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory functions of HO-1 as 
well as the importance of targeting myeloid cells, and timing any potential manipulation of HO-1 expression, for future therapeutic applications, prior to the injurious insult (e.g., IR).
It is quite remarkable that low levels of HO-1 mRNA in human liver transplants, only 2 hours after 
reperfusion, were accompanied by significantly increased expression of M1 markers, CXCL10 and CD80 
(Figure 7), and trends between HO-1 levels and other polarization markers, although not statistically significant (Supplemental Figure 5). This could be due to the limited number of subjects, lack of control

of putative factors that influence inflammatory responses among liver recipients, differences in responses 
induced by partial warm ischemia in the mouse model versus cold and warm ischemia in clinical settings, 
or differences in the length of IR insult and tissue samplings. Importantly, the relationship between HO-1 
expression and M1/M2 profile was confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses of CD80 and CD206 
in liver biopsies from the high HO-1 as compared to the low HO-1 group. However, for logistical reasons, 
HO-1 mRNA levels were tested after 2 hours of IR, not at baseline, prior to the transplant, as was the 
case with the mouse studies. In spite of this, the high HO-1 expression patient cohort not only displayed a 
lesser degree of tissue injury shortly after reperfusion but also had improved long-term clinical outcomes, 
as reported separately (20). Although future studies are needed to evaluate whether differences in HO-1 
expression prior to the IR and OLT have similar predictability power, this could have important therapeutic 
implications. Indeed, our current findings are in agreement with a clinically attractive concept (26) that prospective transplant recipients could be conditioned if needed, with HO-1–inducing compounds prior to or 
around the time of the surgical procedure. Alternatively, BMDMs could be genetically manipulated ex vivo 
to overexpress HO-1 and be autografted back to the patients prior to the actual transplantation.
In summary, our translational study documents the essential role of myeloid HO-1 expression in 
macrophage polarization in favor of an M2 antiinflammatory phenotype in liver IRI. Additional work is 
required to determine the signaling pathways in the M1 to M2 macrophage switch under the control of 
HO-1 and to explore their potential therapeutic applications in sterile inflammation.
Methods
Reagents. LPS (catalog L5418-2ML) and IL-4 (catalog I1020-5UG) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 
Mouse HO-1 antibody (H105) (catalog sc-10789) and β-actin antibody (N-21) (catalog sc-130656) were 
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit anti–human/mouse HO-1 antibody (catalog ADI-SPA896-D, Enzo Life Sciences), rat anti–mouse Ly6G antibody (catalog MCA2387, Bio-Rad), rat anti–mouse 
CD68 antibody (catalog MCA1957, Bio-Rad), rat monoclonal anti-CD11b antibody (catalog 550282, BD 
Biosciences), mouse anti-CD80 antibody (catalog MAB140, R&D Systems), and mouse anti–human CD206 
antibody (catalog MAB25341, R&D Systems) were obtained from the respective vendors as indicated.
Animals. mHO-1–KO and mHO-1–Tg mice were developed at UCLA. mHO-1–KO mice were generated by crossing HO-1 floxed mice (27) with LysM-Cre–Tg mice (28), both of which had been backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for more than 10 generations, using a stepwise breeding strategy (Supplemental Figure 1). HO-1 floxed mice were generated by Mamiya et al. at Tohoku University 
Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan, with a targeting vector that had loxP sites flanking the 
second intron and the terminal exon of HO-1 (27). These mice were obtained from RIKEN (strain name: 
B6J.129P2-Hmox<tim1Mym>, stock number: RBRC03163). LysM-Cre–Tg mice were originally developed by Clausen et al. at the University of Munich, Munich, Germany, by targeted insertion of the Cre 
recombinase cDNA into the endogenous lysozyme locus (28). We obtained these mice from the colony 
of Srinivasa Reddy at UCLA (29). A dsRED protein cassette, located downstream of the floxed HO-1 
gene, was actively transcribed after Cre-mediated deletion of HO-1 exons 3–5 (Figure 1A). Therefore, 
dsRED fluorescence served as a reporter for efficient deletion of HO-1 exons 3–5. Primer sequences 
employed for the genotyping of floxed HO-1 alleles (mouse Hmox1-g62145r, mouse Hmox1-g61822f, and 
DsRed-N2) (Riken Inc.) and LysM-Cre gene (pLysM-FP1, LysM-RP2, and VE-Cad-Cre-R) are shown 
in Supplemental Table 1. mHO-1–KO mice were homozygous for both floxed HO-1 alleles and LysMCre alleles (HO-1fl/fl, LysM-Cre+/+), while control mice were homozygous for the floxed HO-1 allele but 
lacked the LysM-Cre allele (HO-1fl/fl, LysM-Cre–/–).
mHO-1–Tg mice were generated by crossing floxed HO-1–Tg mice with the aforementioned LysM-Cre–
Tg mice. Floxed HO-1–Tg mice were obtained from Anupam Agarwal at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who had generated them in the C57BL/6 background (30). This transgene contains the human HO-1 
(human HMOX1) cDNA downstream from a floxed β-galactosidase gene (β-gal) and a stop-codon cassette, which 
are preceded by a chicken β-actin (CBA) hybrid promoter with an enhancer element and a chimeric intron, which 
enhances promoter activity. The schematic of the construct employed in the generation of floxed HO-1–Tg is 
shown in Figure 4A. The breeding strategy was similar to that used for the generation of mHO-1–KO mice 
(Supplemental Figure 1). mHO-1–Tg mice were homozygous for both floxed HO-1–Tg and Cre alleles (HO-1–
Tgfl/fl, LysM-Cre+/+). For this purpose, we quantified copy number by real-time qPCR (31) using primers specific 
for HO-1 (human HMOX1 FP-101, human HMOX1 RP-101, with Roche universal probe 101) and primers for the

non-intron region of the Gja5 gene as our control (Gja5 FP6 and Gja5 RP6 with Roche universal probe 6) (Supplemental Table 2). The control mice were either HO-1–Tgfl/fl, LysM-Cre–/– littermates or C57BL/6 mice since 
there were no differences in the level of injury due to warm ischemic injury based on the H&E staining, Suzuki’s 
histological grading of liver IRI, and the levels of serum AST and ALT between HO-1–Tgfl/fl, LysM-Cre–/–, and 
C57BL/6 mice (Supplemental Figure 7). All experimental and control mice were 8- to 12-week-old males, housed 
in the UCLA animal facility under specific pathogen–free conditions. All animals received human care according 
to the criteria outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the NIH (NIH publication 86-23, revised 1985).
Liver IRI model. A mouse model of partial (75%) warm hepatic IRI was used, as described previously 
(32). Briefly, mice were anesthetized, injected with heparin (100 U/kg), and an atraumatic clip was used to 
interrupt the hepatic artery and portal venous blood supply to the left/middle liver lobes. After 90 minutes 
of ischemia, the clamp was removed and mice were sacrificed at 6 hours of reperfusion, the peak time of 
hepatocellular damage in this model. Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava and organs were 
harvested upon euthanasia.
Serum biochemistry. Levels of ALT and AST were measured in serum by IDEXX Laboratories, which 
served as indicators of hepatocellular injury.
Liver histology. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections (5 μm) were stained with H&E as previously reported (19). The severity of liver IRI was assessed blindly and graded according to Suzuki’s criteria on a scale from 0 to 4. No necrosis, congestion, or centrolobular ballooning is given a score of 0, while 
severe congestion and greater than 60% lobular necrosis is given a value of 4 (17).
Immunofluorescence. Liver-infiltrating inflammatory cells (macrophages and neutrophils) were detected 
using rat monoclonal CD11b antibody or rat anti–mouse CD68 antibody and rat anti–mouse Ly6G antibody, respectively. Liver biopsy expression of CD80 and CD206 were detected using mouse anti-CD80 
antibody and mouse anti-CD206 antibody, respectively. Immunofluorescence signals were visualized with 
secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 IgG (Molecular Probes). Positive cells 
were counted blindly in 10 HPFs/section (×400).
Isolation and culture of AMs, PMs, and BMDMs. AMs were isolated as described previously (33) with 
minor modifications. Briefly, mice were euthanized and their tracheas were exposed. An 18-gauge needle 
attached to a 3-ml syringe was inserted into the trachea to flush the lungs multiple times using 1.5 ml of 
cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which was 
immediately placed on ice after collection, and then plated in 6-well plates that were incubated. PMs were 
harvested as described previously (34). Briefly, 10 ml of PBS was injected into the mouse peritoneal cavity 
with a 21-gauge needle (1-inch length). The retrieved peritoneal lavage was first placed on ice after collection 
and then plated in 6-well plates. Cells were washed with PBS 3 times after either a 1-hour incubation (for 
mRNA analysis) or an overnight incubation (for Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy). Bone 
marrow cells from mHO-1–KO, mHO-1–Tg, and their respective control mice were harvested, and cultured 
as previously described to generate BMDMs (23). On the seventh day, cells were counted and replated. After 
24 hours, cells were treated with either LPS (100 ng/ml) for 6 hours or IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 24 hours.
Live cell fluorescence microscopy. Cells were examined under a light and fluorescence microscope (Carl 
Zeiss Cell Observer Z.1 R) within 30 minutes. Nearly all adhered cells (macrophages) exhibited red fluorescence, indicating effective deletion of HO-1 (Figure 1B). Images were taken with a ×10 eyepiece plus ×20 
objective, for a total of ×200 magnification with the phase I channel for phase-contrast light microscopic 
imaging, paired with the Cy3 channel with filter sets of 538–563 nm excitation/570–640 nm emission combination for dsRED fluorescence.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis. RNA extraction was done with a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. Probe-based 
real-time qPCR was used to characterize mouse tissue Hmox1 mRNA expression in mHO-1–KO as well 
as total HO-1 gene expression in mHO-1–Tg mice and their respective controls. Probe-based real-time 
qPCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler 480 as described previously (31). The primers and corresponding Roche universal probes are listed in Supplemental Table 2. In detail, human HMOX1 FP-101 
and human HMOX1 RP-101 with Roche universal probe 101 were used to detect human HMOX1 mRNA 
expression in mHO-1–Tg mice, with no cross-detection of mouse Hmox1 mRNA. A pair of primers (Uni 
HO1 F49/134 and Uni HO1 R49/134-short) that amplify both human and mouse HO-1 cDNA sequences 
were used to detect total HO-1 expression in mHO-1–Tg mice (Supplemental Table 2). A SYBR Green–
based qPCR method was used to assess gene expression in BMDMs treated with LPS and IL-4, mouse liver

tissues following IRI, and human liver biopsies. Primers for this purpose are listed in Supplemental Table 3. 
SYBR Green–based qPCR was performed using a DNA Engine with Chromo 4 Detector (MJ Research) 
as described previously (35). The expression of the target gene was normalized to β-actin (Roche universal probe–based method) and the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (HPRT) (SYBR 
Green–based), respectively. Values are expressed as relative fold induction.
Clinical liver transplant study and sample collection. Liver biopsy samples were collected from 21 adult 
primary OLT recipients, as described previously (20). In brief, subjects were recruited between May 10, 
2013 and April 6, 2015. Routine standard-of-care and immunosuppressive therapy were administered as 
specified by UCLA liver transplant protocols. All donor organs were procured from donation after brain 
death with standardized techniques, perfused with and stored in cold University of Wisconsin solution 
(ViaSpan; Bristol-Meyers Squibb Pharma). Recipient venous blood was collected prior to the transplant 
and at postoperative day 1. Liver function was evaluated with standard-of-care tests, including serum 
ALT, AST, and total bilirubin. Protocol Tru-Cut needle biopsies (Bx) were obtained intraoperatively 
from the left lobe approximately 2 hours after portal reperfusion (prior to surgical closing of the abdomen) and were snap-frozen. mRNA levels for HO-1 and the macrophage M1 (CXCL10, CD80, IL-1β, 
and MCP1) and M2 (ARG1 and CD163) polarization markers were assessed by real-time qPCR using the 
primers shown in Supplemental Table 3. The demographic data and clinical parameters of the recipients 
have been presented by Nakamura et al. (20).
Statistics. All data are expressed as the mean ± SEM (scatter dot blot), except for human gene expression 
(Figure 7) where data are presented as Tukey box-and-whisker plots: whiskers are inner fences reaching 1.5 
times the interquartile range and boxes represent the interquartile ranges, dots indicate outlying values, and 
lines represent median values for each gene expression level. For data comparisons between 2 groups, we used 
a 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. For data comparisons among 3 or more groups, we used 1-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple-comparisons post hoc test. Spearman’s correlations were used to 
analyze associations between HO-1 expression and other inflammatory gene expression in the human liver 
transplant biopsies. Analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism 6 software. Differences were considered 
statistically significant at P < 0.05 (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001).
Study approval. The present studies were reviewed and approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee (ARC 1999-094; mouse) and Institutional Review Board (IRB 13-000143; human), Los Angeles, 
California. Subjects provided informed consent prior to their participation in the study.
