Abstract
Hepatitis C virus (HCV)–specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTL) are present in the peripheral blood and liver of
chronically infected patients. The current study was performed to study the relationship between the strength of the
CTL response, liver disease severity, and viral load. The results may be summarized as follows: first, using CTL precursor frequency (CTLpf) analysis to quantitate the peripheral blood CTL response, chronically infected patients were
less strongly sensitized to a panel of well-defined HCV
epitopes than they were to an epitope within the influenza
matrix protein. Second, HCV-specific CTLpf did not correlate with disease activity or viral load in the majority of patients on a cross-sectional basis, although it did increase in
three patients concomitant with sharp increases in liver disease. Finally, interferon therapy did not enhance the CTLpf
against the HCV epitopes studied in these patients, indicating that its antiviral effect is independent of the CTL response. Since the HCV-specific CTLpf in the blood is actually quite low, the CTL may contribute to ongoing liver
disease in these patients while being quantitatively inadequate to destroy all of the infected hepatocytes, thereby facilitating HCV persistence and contributing to chronic liver
disease. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:1432–1440.) Key words:

Introduction
The hepatitis C virus (HCV)1 is a hepatotropic RNA virus that
causes acute and chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (1–6). It is generally believed that immune-mediated
mechanisms, in particular HLA class I–restricted cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL), play an important role in viral clearance
and disease pathogenesis in many viral infections (7, 8). In
hepatitis C virus infection, however, HLA class I–restricted
HCV-specific CD81 CTL are detectable in the peripheral
blood (9–14) and CTL clones have been isolated from the liver
of chronically infected patients (15–17) and chimpanzees (18)
despite persistent infection.
Thus, HCV can survive in the face of an intrahepatic and
peripheral CTL response to its antigens. To investigate the basis for this observation, we quantitated the peripheral blood
CTL response longitudinally in chronically infected patients
treated with interferon and analyzed the relationship between
the strength of the CTL response, liver disease activity, and viral load. To identify patients whose CTL responses to one or
more of these peptides were strong enough to warrant CTL
precursor frequency (CTLpf) analysis longitudinally by limiting dilution analysis, we screened HCV-infected patients before interferon therapy with a panel of 10 HCV-derived
epitopes. We now report that the CTL precursor frequency for
individual HCV epitopes is actually quite low in the peripheral
blood of chronically infected patients as compared to the
CTLpf for the influenza matrix epitope, and it is not enhanced
by interferon therapy. Since in individual instances an increase
in CTLpf preceded a rise in serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) activity, the results suggest that the HCV-specific CTL
response contributes to liver disease pathogenesis, but they are
unable to clear the virus in patients with chronic hepatitis.
Methods
Patient population. 9 HLA-A2–positive patients with chronic hepatitis C (Table I) and 15 HLA-A2–positive healthy, uninfected subjects were studied. The diagnosis of HCV infection was based on
standard clinical parameters and serological assays using the secondgeneration (c200/c22-3) Ortho HCV ELISA test system (Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Raritan, N.J.). All patients displayed elevated
ALT activity and histological evidence of chronic active hepatitis before interferon therapy. Three (patients 2, 6, and 7) had liver cirrhosis. Treatment with interferon followed the protocols described in Table I. A decrease of transaminases below the upper limit of the
normal range was achieved in five (patients 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9) during
and immediately after cessation of therapy and serum HCV RNA
was undetectable by branched chain DNA (bDNA) analysis in the
same five patients and by nested polymerase chain reaction in two
(patients 1 and 4) at the end of interferon treatment. Patient 1 showed a
sustained reduction of serum ALT activity and remained HCV RNA
negative by bDNA analysis for 6 mo after discontinuation of therapy,
while Patient 4 displayed only a temporary biochemical and virologic
response. All subjects studied were repeatedly negative for antibodies to HIV and HBV. The study protocol was approved by the Human Subjects Committee at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation (La Jolla, CA).

HLA typing. HLA typing of PBMC from patients and from normal donors was performed by complement-dependent microcytotoxicity using HLA typing trays purchased from One Lambda (Canoga
Park, CA).
Synthetic peptides. A panel of peptides representing 10 previously identified HLA-A2–restricted HCV CTL epitopes (12, 19, 20)
and the influenza matrix peptide 58-66 (21) were selected for this
study (Table II). Peptide sequences were derived from the nucleotide
sequence of HCV-1 (22), which is genotype 1a. All peptides were synthesized with a free amine NH2
 terminus and a free acid COOH terminus by Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Australia). Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted at 20 mg/ml in DMSO (Mallinckrodt Inc.,
Paris, KY) and diluted to 1 mg/ml with RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco
Laboratories, Grand Island, NY).
Stimulation of PBMC with synthetic peptides. PBMCs were separated on Ficoll-Histopaque density gradients (Sigma Chemical Co.,
St. Louis, MO), washed three times in HBSS (Gibco Laboratories),
resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Gibco Laboratories) supplemented with
2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM gentamycin, and 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum, and plated in a 96-well round bottom plate at 0.4 3
106 cells/100 ml per well. Synthetic peptides were added at 10 mg/ml to
eight replicate cultures. On day 7, the cultures were transferred to a
96-well flat-bottom plate and, on days 7 and 14, restimulated with 10
mg/ml peptide, 20 U/ml rIL-2 (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ), and
105 irradiated (3,000 rad) autologous feeder cells. On days 3, 10, and
18, 100 ml of RPMI with 10% (vol/vol) human AB serum and rIL-2 at
10 U/ml final concentration was added to each well. Cultures were
tested for peptide-specific cytolytic activity on day 21.
Cytotoxicity assay. For all experiments, JY cell targets (HLAA2.1, B7, Cw7) were maintained in RPMI with 10% (vol/vol) heatinactivated FCS (Gibco Laboratories). Target cells were incubated
overnight with synthetic peptides at 10 mg/ml and then labeled with
100 mCi of 51Cr (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) for 1 h and
washed four times with HBSS. Cytolytic activity was determined in a
standard 4-h 51Cr release assay using round-bottom 96-well plates
containing 3,000 targets/well. Stimulated PBMCs from patients and

normal controls were tested at E/T ratios of 30:1–40:1. Percent cytotoxicity was determined from the formula: 100 3 [(experimental release 2 spontaneous release)/(maximum release 2 spontaneous release)]. Maximum release was determined by lysis of targets by
detergent (10% Triton X-100; Sigma Chemical Co.). In all instances,
spontaneous release was , 25% of maximum release.
As previously described (23) the analysis of eight replicate cultures for each peptide allowed the strength of the CTL response to be
expressed as the CTL response index (CRI). The CRI-P value is the
sum of all specific cytotoxicities of the eight replicate cultures for a
given peptide in a patient. The mean CRI-P values observed in the 15
normal controls are indicated at the bottom of Fig. 1. CRI-P values
equal to or greater than the mean control value plus 3 SDs for each
peptide were required for a CTL response to be considered positive.
Positive responses are indicated in boldface type in Fig. 1 and the
peptides chosen for limiting dilution analysis are underlined.
Limiting dilution analysis. Quantitative analysis of epitope-specific CTLpf was performed in nine HCV-infected patients and three
uninfected healthy controls as previously described (24). To prepare
antigen-presenting cells, autologous PBMCs were activated with
0.005% Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA), with 20
mg/ml Immunobeads (Rabbit anti–human IgM; Irvine Scientific,
Santa Ana, CA) and 20 ng/ml human rec IL-4 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) at 2 3 106
 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM
l-glutamine, 10 mM gentamycin, and 5% heat-inactivated FCS. On
days 4–6, they were washed in cold 0.9% NaCl, 1% BSA, resuspended at 107
 cells/ml in cold citrate phosphate buffer, (0.13 M l-citric acid (J.T. Baker, Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ), 0.06 M sodium phosphate
monobasic, pH3 (Sigma Chemical Co.), 1% BSA, and 3 mg/ml b2 microglobulin for 2 min at 48C, washed with 5 vol cold 0.15 M sodium
phosphate monobasic, pH 7.5, containing 3 mg/ml b2 microglobulin
(Scripps Laboratories, La Jolla, CA) and 10 mg/ml peptide, and incubated with 50 mg/ml peptide, 30 mg/ml DNase (Sigma Chemical Co.),
and 3 mg/ml b2 microglobulin for 4 h at 208C. After irradiation (6,100
rad), 105 cells/well were plated in a 96-well round bottom plate and
400,000, 200,000, 100,000, and 50,000 autologous PBMCs were added
in 24 replicates in 100 ml RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 mM gentamycin, and 10% heat-inactivated human AB serum. If a high CTL precursor frequency was expected, 100,000,
50,000, 25,000, and 12,500 PBMCs were added to each well. Cultures

were fed with 20 ml rIL-7 (PharMingen) on day 7 and 20 ml rIL-2 every 3 d to obtain a final concentration of 10 ng/ml rIL-7 and 10 U/ml
IL-2. After restimulation with autologous, peptide-pulsed (20 mg/ml),
irradiated (3,000 rad) adherent cells on day 12, a split-well CTL-assay
with 3000 targets/well as described above, was performed on day 17–
19. Cultures were regarded as positive if the specific cytotoxicity was
more than 2 SDs above the mean of the unspecific cytotoxicity of all
cultures, and CTL precursor frequency was calculated using the maximum likelihood method (25). To follow changes in the HCV epitopespecific CTLpf in individual patients over time, frozen PBMCs from
different bleed dates were thawed, cultured, and tested for specific
cytotoxicity in the same experiment.
HCV RNA determination and HCV genotyping. RNA was extracted from 100 ml of serum as previously described (26). Reverse
transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction of the conserved
59 noncoding region was performed to establish the presence of HCV
RNA (27). PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel and
visualized by ethidium bromide staining. HCV RNA was quantitated
in serum using the bDNA nucleic acid hybridization assay QuantiplexTM HCV RNA Assay (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Results were expressed as HCV
genome equivalents per milliliter. Semiquantitative PCR was also
performed using serial 10-fold dilutions of the cDNA. The negative
logarithm of the highest 10-fold dilution of cDNA yielding a positive
result was taken as the HCV RNA titer for each sample. HCV genotype in each patient was determined by the standard INNOLIPA assay (courtesy of Dr. Andrew Conrad, National Genetics Institute,
Los Angeles, CA), using PCR-amplified viral nucleic acid and genotype-specific probes in the 59 noncoding region (28).

Results
Analysis of the CTL response to multiple HCV epitopes. To identify patients whose CTL responses to HCV-derived epitopes
were strong enough to warrant CTL precursor frequency analysis longitudinally by limiting dilution analysis, we screened all
patients before interferon therapy with a panel of 10 predefined HCV-derived peptides. Using a microwell peptide
stimulation strategy with eight replicate cultures per peptide,
we demonstrated that most of the patients with chronic hepatitis
C displayed a characteristic multispecific CTL response (Fig. 1).
A CRI-P of at least 3 SDs above the average CRI-P obtained
in controls was observed in all patients. In total, 43 out of 90
(46%) possible CTL responses were positive in the patient
group (Fig. 1) as oppposed to 5 out 150 (3%) possible CTL responses in the controls (not shown). Since we have recently described that the total CRI, which represents the sum of all
CRI-P per patient, is inversely associated with viral load (29),
and since interferon is thought to have antiviral as well as immunmodulatory effects, we were therefore interested in analyzing the relationship between CTL response, disease activity,
and viral load longitudinally during interferon therapy in indiFigure 4. Serial analysis of the HCV epitope–specific CTL precursor

vidual patients. For each patient, one or two of the peptides
that were best recognized (usually peptides 1 and 2 from the
core protein and peptides 4 and 6 from the NS3 protein), displaying strong CTL response indices (underlined in Fig. 1),
were chosen for CTLpf analysis (see below).
Relative strength of the CTL response to HCV and influenza
virus matrix peptides in patients and controls. To compare the
degree of sensitization to HCV and influenza virus (as a recall
antigen), simultaneous limiting dilution analysis was performed to determine the CTLpf for HCV and influenza matrix
peptides in three HCV patients and three normal controls.
HCV- and influenza peptide–specific CTLpf’s observed in a
representative patient and a representative control (using the
HCV peptide for which a high CTLpf was observed for each
subject) are displayed in Fig. 2. Note that there are more influenza-specific CTL precursors than HCV-specific CTL precursors
in the chronically infected patient and that essentially no
HCV-specific CTL precursors were detectable in the uninfected
control (i.e., , 1 in 2 3 106
 PBMCs). The HCV- and influenza
virus–specific CTLpf in all six subjects studied are summarized
in Table III. Importantly, all three patients displayed fewer
HCV-specific CTL precursors for the HCV peptides they recognized efficiently in the screening assay (Fig. 1) than for the influenza recall antigen. Table III also illustrates that, despite
the impressive degree of HCV peptide-inducible cytolytic activity illustrated in Fig. 1, the number of HCV-specific CTL
precursors is actually quite low in these chronically infected
patients, as we have previously reported (12).
Longitudinal analysis of HCV-specific CTL precursor frequency, disease activity, and viral load during interferon therapy. To examine the relationship between HCV-specific
CTLpf and both disease activity and viral load, we studied the
CTLpf for one or two epitopes per patient at 4–12 time points
before, during, and after interferon therapy. For each patient,
HCV-derived peptides that were recognized strongly in the
screening assay (Fig. 1) were chosen for CTLpf analyses. For
patients 2, 5, and 8, CTLpf for peptides that were less strongly
recognized were also studied. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B and
Fig. 4 C, three (patients 1, 2, and 6) responded to interferon
with rapid and profound decreases in viral load (shaded areas).

Importantly, the HCV-specific CTLpf (bars) did not change
during this dynamic flux in viral load, indicating that CTLindependent mechanisms were probably responsible for the
antiviral effect of interferon in these patients. In one atypical
patient (patient 3) the HCV-specific CTLpf increased approximately fourfold during interferon therapy and fell back to
baseline when treatment was stopped (Fig. 3 C). Nonetheless,
serum HCV RNA levels rose paradoxically during this period,
indicating that neither the CTL response nor interferon therapy was able to control the viral burden in this individual. Note
that serum ALT activity did not change despite the fluctuations in viral load and CTLpf in this patient.
Five (patients 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6) displayed flares in serum
ALT activity, defined as a greater than twofold increase of serum ALT activity during a period of 2 mo, either before initiation of therapy (Fig. 4 A) or after its withdrawal (Fig. 3, A and
B, and 4, A–C). It is noteworthy that CTLpf activity appeared
to increase just before or concomitant with the disease flares in
four out of six instances in three of these five (patients 1, 4, and
5), suggesting that the CTL response may have played a role in
these episodes. However, sharp increases in CTLpf were also
observed in patients 3 (Fig. 3 C) and 6 (Fig. 4 C) without any
associated changes in serum HCV RNA or ALT activity, and
wide fluctuations in serum ALT activity observed in patient 7
were not associated with concomitant changes in CTLpf or viral load (Fig. 5 A). Patients 8 and 9 displayed minimal or no
changes in HCV-specific CTLpf or serum HCV RNA levels
over a similar observation period (Fig. 5, A and B).
HCV-specific CTL precursor frequency is not enhanced
during interferon therapy and, on a cross-sectional basis, does
not correlate with disease activity or viral load. The foregoing
results demonstrate that interferon treatment did not enhance
the peripheral blood HCV-specific CTL response in these patients. This was confirmed when all patients were analyzed
cross-sectionally before, during, and after interferon therapy
for HCV-specific CTLpf. As shown in Fig. 6, the mean HCVspecific CTLpf did not change significantly from pretreatment
values during or after interferon treatment. Reflecting these
observations, the HCV epitope–specific CTL precursor frequency did not correlate with either serum HCV RNA content
as a measurement of viral load (Fig. 7 A) or the serum ALT activity as a measurement of disease activity (Fig. 7 B) before,
during, or after interferon therapy. Finally, the serum HCV
RNA content correlated with serum ALT activity in this group
of patients before interferon treatment, although this correlation disappeared with interferon therapy (Fig. 7 C).
To determine if important correlations between viral load
and CTLpf or ALT may be masked by the low sensitivity of
the bDNA assay (. 3.5 3 105
 genome equivalents/ml), the
bDNA-negative serum samples were also analyzed by semiquantitative PCR. However, no linear correlation was found
between HCV CTLpf and HCV RNA content even at the low
levels detectable by this technique (Fig. 8 B).
Discussion
The current study was performed to examine the basis for
HCV persistence in the face of a multispecific peripheral blood
CTL response in patients with chronic hepatitis. The results
can be summarized as follows: first, chronically infected patients display fewer HCV-specific CTL precursors in their peripheral blood than influenza-specific CTL. Assuming that the
CTL responses we monitored in this study are representative
of the overall strength of the CTL response to both of these viruses, this suggests that the active CTL response to an ongoing
HCV infection in these patients is not as strong as their recall
response to a previous influenza infection. This may explain
why HCV is commonly persistent while influenza is not. Second, although HCV-specific peripheral CTLpf increased before flares in liver disease activity in a few patients, this relationship was not absolute, apparently reflecting the indolent
nature of the disease in most of the patients we studied or
compartmentalization of the CTL in the liver. Third, the
HCV-specific CTLpf did not correlate with viral load; in fact,
the viral burden actually increased in the face of increasing
CTLpf in one patient, emphasizing the ineffectiveness of the
CTL response against single HCV epitopes in these patients.
Finally, in some subjects interferon treatment was associated
with a reduction in viral load without enhancing the CTL response or inducing liver disease, suggesting that HCV may be
susceptible to control by noncytopathic antiviral mechanisms
that can be induced by interferon but are not spontaneously
activated in these chronically infected patients.
These results suggest that the chronically infected patients
mount a CTL response to HCV that may be quantitatively insufficient for viral clearance, but is likely to kill some of the infected hepatocytes, thereby causing chronic hepatitis. The reason why most patients mount an apparently ineffective CTL
response to HCV is unclear. Global immunosuppression can
be eliminated based on the normal CTLpf these patients display to an unrelated viral antigen. Thymic deletion of HCVspecific T cells is unlikely since all of these patients were inFigure 8. (A) Comparison of the frequency of CTL precursors (per 106

fected as adults. CTL exhaustion due to antigen hyperstimulation is unlikely since the viral burden during HCV infection is
not especially high. Conceivably, HCV might interfere with
antigen processing or presentation by the hepatocyte, thereby
diminishing its visibility to the immune system sufficiently to
hamper development of an immune response; however, there
is no direct evidence for this hypothesis in the literature at this
time. Alternatively, it is possible that the low number of HCVspecific CTL precursors in the peripheral blood does not reflect conditions in the liver (15–17). If this is true, however, it
implies that the cytolytic function of the intrahepatic HCVspecific CTL is not sufficient to kill or cure all of the infected
cells in the liver even if the CTL response is vigorous.
Along these lines, based on evidence from a transgenic
mouse model, we have recently suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV)–specific CTL may control HBV infection not only
by killing infected hepatocytes but also by inhibiting HBV replication by secreting certain antiviral cytokines when they recognize antigen (30, 31). If this or related potentially curative
antiviral pathways are required for viral clearance to be complete in an organ with as many infectible cells as the liver, viruses that are either intrinsically resistant to noncytolytic control or that induce an immune response that does not produce
the corresponding antiviral cytokines would have a survival
advantage. The current data suggest that HCV may fall into
one of these categories, and further studies should be done to
pursue this hypothesis.
Finally, one must consider the possibility that HCV may
have mutated and escaped the CTL response to the corresponding epitopes in the chronically infected patients we studied, and the response we measured is weak due to a lack of
continuous stimulation by the original antigen. Furthermore,
some patients did not display a CTL response to epitopes that
should be encoded by the infecting virus as predicted by HCV
genotyping. Others responded to HCV-1–derived peptides
that were not identical with the predicted sequence encoded
by their own viral genotypes. These very interesting observations are currently under investigation at the nucleotide sequence level, especially since emergence of a CTL escape variant of HCV has been reported in a chronically infected
chimpanzee (18).
Collectively, these results and the published database suggest that the CTL response probably contributes to disease
pathogenesis but is not vigorous enough to eradicate the virus
during chronic HCV infection in most patients. The current
study emphasizes that the peripheral CTL precursor frequency
to individual HCV epitopes is very low in the chronically infected patients we studied. The reason for the failure to mount
a stronger epitope-specific CTL response is unclear at this
time. If the peripheral CTL response reflects the HCV-specific
CTLpf in the intrahepatic lymphomononuclear cell infiltrate,
the total number of HCV-specific CTL in the chronically infected liver may simply be too low to clear the virus from all of
the infected cells. It is premature at this time to conclude that
HCV cannot be controlled by CTL under any circumstances,
however, even though most of the patients studied were not
able to clear the virus completely and only a few displayed
sharp changes in liver disease activity. Quantitation of multispecific CTL responses in patients who recover spontaneously
from acute HCV infection is needed to better understand the
role of the CTL response in HCV clearance and disease pathogenesis.
