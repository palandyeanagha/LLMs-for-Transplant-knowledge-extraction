Hepatic steatosis is a core feature of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes and leads to hepatic insulin
resistance. Malonyl-CoA, generated by acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2 (Acc1 and Acc2), is a key regulator of
both mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and fat synthesis. We used a diet-induced rat model of nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance to explore the impact of suppressing Acc1, Acc2, or
both Acc1 and Acc2 on hepatic lipid levels and insulin sensitivity. While suppression of Acc1 or Acc2 expression with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) increased fat oxidation in rat hepatocytes, suppression of both
enzymes with a single ASO was significantly more effective in promoting fat oxidation. Suppression of Acc1
also inhibited lipogenesis whereas Acc2 reduction had no effect on lipogenesis. In rats with NAFLD, suppression of both enzymes with a single ASO was required to significantly reduce hepatic malonyl-CoA levels
in vivo, lower hepatic lipids (long-chain acyl-CoAs, diacylglycerol, and triglycerides), and improve hepatic
insulin sensitivity. Plasma ketones were significantly elevated compared with controls in the fed state but not
in the fasting state, indicating that lowering Acc1 and -2 expression increases hepatic fat oxidation specifically
in the fed state. These studies suggest that pharmacological inhibition of Acc1 and -2 may be a novel approach
in the treatment of NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance.
Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent
cause of abnormal liver function tests in the US, with an estimated prevalence of 14–20% (1, 2). It is caused by triglyceride (TG)
accumulation within the liver and can either be a benign self-limiting state or a condition associated with steatohepatitis, which
may progressto end-stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation. The most common disorder associated with NAFLD is insulin resistance, an association which holds true in both lean and
obese subjects (3, 4). Insulin resistance is in turn a key element in
the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.
Overexpressing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the liver in mice results
in fatty liver and liver-specific insulin resistance (5). Short-term
high-fat feeding in ratsleadsto hepatic steatosis, impaired insulin
signaling, and hepatic insulin resistance, and reducing lipid accumulation with a mitochondrial uncoupling agent (2,4-dinitrophenol) improves hepatic insulin sensitivity (6). We have also shown
that moderate weight loss in humans with type 2 diabetes lowers
liver TGs and specifically improves hepatic insulin sensitivity (7).
Together, these data strongly suggest that lipid accumulation in
the liver is directly responsible for the subsequent development
of hepatic insulin resistance and increased endogenous glucose
production, key elements in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
They also suggest thatreducing liverlipid accumulation may be an
attractive therapeutic strategy for NAFLD and type 2 diabetes.
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc) catalyzesthe synthesis of malonylCoA, which is both an intermediate in fatty acid synthesis and an
allosteric inhibitorof carnitinepalmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1)(8, 9).
CPT1 regulates the transfer of long-chain acyl-CoAs (LCCoAs)
from the cytosol into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized.
Malonyl-CoA is therefore a key physiological regulator of both
fatty acid synthesis (10) and oxidation (11). There are 2 isoforms
of Acc in rodents and humans; Acc1 is highly expressed in liver
and adipose tissue whereas Acc2 is predominantly expressed
in heart and skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, in the liver
(12). Despite being encoded by separate genes, ACC1 and ACC2
exhibit considerable sequence identity (∼85% excluding the N terminal extension of ACC2) and have the same domain structure
responsible for enzyme activity. The primary structural difference between the 2 is an extra N terminal hydrophobic domain in
Acc2 that appears to facilitate Acc2 localization to the mitochondrial membrane (13), where it is believed to regulate local malonyl-CoA levels, CPT1 activity, and fat oxidation. ACC2-null mice
(ACC2–/–) are leaner than wild-type controls due to increased fat
oxidation in heart and skeletal muscle (12). Interestingly, hepatic
fat oxidation was also increased and hepatic steatosis decreased

in ACC2–/– mice despite normal malonyl-CoA levels; the authors
postulated that this might have been a consequence of localized
lowering of malonyl-CoA levels in the vicinity of mitochondria
and CPT1, a change not discernible in whole-cell homogenates
(12). Acc1 is localized in the cytosol, where it is thought to regulate lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue. ACC1-null mice
are embryonic lethal (14).
Here we sought to address 2 main questions: (a) What are the
respective roles of Acc1 and Acc2 in regulating fat synthesis and
fat oxidation in the liver, the principal organ in which both fat
synthesis and fat oxidation occur to a significant degree? and (b)
What are the metabolic consequences of pharmacological manipulation of Acc1 and Acc2 expression in the liver in rats with high-fat
diet–induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance? The pharmacokinetic properties of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) used in
the currentstudy allowed usto examine in vivo reductions oftarget
mRNA in the liver without causing any change in Acc expression in
muscle. The results suggest that both Acc1 and Acc2 are involved
in regulating fat oxidation in the liver, whereas only Acc1 synthesizes malonyl-CoA for fat synthesis, and that reducing both Acc1
and Acc2 expression with a single Acc ASO (Acc1 and -2) reverses
hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance in high-fat–fed rats,
providing a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of NAFLD.
Results
Acc ASOs decrease Acc expression and lower malonyl-CoA levels in rat livers.

Acc1 and Acc2 ASO treatmentreduced ACC1 (Figure 1A) and ACC2
mRNA (Figure 1B) levels, respectively, by approximately 80% in the
liver. Whereas Acc1 and Acc2 ASOs reduced target expression in an
Acc isoform–specific manner, treatment with the Acc1 and -2 ASO
reducedbothACC1andACC2mRNAby approximately80%(Figure1,

foundwith any oftheASO-treated groupsin muscle, consistentwith
previous findings (Figure 1, C and D) (15). Western blot analysis
of liver protein extracts from rats injected with the Acc1, Acc2, and
combined Acc1 and -2 ASOs confirmed isoform-selective knockdown of Acc protein expression and approximately 90% knockdown
of total Acc protein with the Acc1 and -2 ASO (Figure 1E). Western
blotting also suggested that Acc1 is the dominant isoform, at least
in terms of protein expression, in rat liver. Malonyl-CoA levels were
not significantly altered by Acc1 or Acc2 ASO therapy, whereas the
Acc1 and -2 ASO substantially lowered (49%, P < 0.05) malonyl-CoA
levelsin the liver of refed rats(Figure 1F). Fasting malonyl-CoA levels, which are lower than those in refed rat livers, were similar in all
groups(data notshown).
Impact of Acc ASOs on fatty acid oxidation and TG synthesis in primary 
rat hepatocytes. After overnight culture, primary rat hepatocytes
transfected with ASOctrl, Acc1-, Acc2-, or Acc1 and -2 ASOs were
incubated with medium containing [14C]oleic acid for another 2
hours for fatty acid oxidation
measurement or [3H]glycerol
for another 16 hours for TG
synthesis measurement. Reduction of either Acc1 or Acc2 significantly increased fat oxidation, although the effect was
significantly greater with the
Acc2 ASO, which is believed
to regulate malonyl-CoA levels
in the immediate proximity of
CPT1. This observation suggests that malonyl-CoA generated in the cytosol (via Acc1)
also contributes to CPT1 regulation and is consistent with
the fact that knockdown of
both isoforms synergistically increased fat oxidation (Figure 2A).
In vitro fat synthesis was significantly inhibited only by the Acc1
and Acc1 and -2 ASOs (Figure 2, B and C), suggesting that Acc2 is
solely involved in regulating fat oxidation whereas Acc1 contributes to the regulation of both fat synthesis and fat oxidation in
hepatocytes. Given the in vitro evidence for a synergistic effect of
combined ACC1 and ACC2 knockdown, further work focused on
the in vivo impact of the Acc1 and -2 ASO.
Acc1 and -2 ASO reduces hepatic steatosis. Hepatic TGs were significantly lower in Acc1 and -2–treated animals than in controls (45%
reduction; P < 0.05) (Figure 3A). LCCoA also tended to be lower
(26% reduction; P = 0.13), and diacylglycerol (DAG) levels were significantly (30% reduction; P < 0.05) reduced in Acc1 and -2 ASO–
treated animals (Figure 3, B and C). Plasma ketones are synthesized in the liverfrom acetyl-CoA derived from fatty acid oxidation
and can, therefore, be used as an indirect marker of hepatic fatty
acid oxidation. Interestingly, plasma ketones were only increased

in Acc1 and -2 ASO–treated animals in the fed state (83% increase;
P < 0.05) (Figure 3, D and E), in keeping with the observed differences in malonyl-CoA concentrations (Figure 1F).
Acc1 and -2 ASO treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity. Caloric
intake, total weight gain, and epididymal fat pad weight were similar in all treated groups (Table 1) and did not differ from those
of high-fat–fed rats injected with saline (data not shown). Plasma
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were within the range seen
in healthy chow-fed rats (Table 1), suggesting that at the doses
used, inhibition of Acc does not cause hepatic toxicity. Fasting
and refed plasma glucose and fatty acid levels were similar in both
groups (Table 1), whereas refed plasma insulin and leptin levels
were significantly reduced in Acc1 and -2 ASO–treated rats. The
reduction in leptin levels during the fed state probably reflectsthe
lower insulin levels (16). In order to independently assess hepatic
and peripheral (predominantly muscle) insulin sensitivity, we performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (including radioisotope infusions) in ASO-treated rats. Glucose infusion rates were
significantly higher in Acc1 and -2 ASO–treated high-fat–fed rats
than in the ASOctrl group (Figure 4A). Whereas insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose metabolism was similar in both groups
(Figure 4B), the ability of insulin to suppress endogenous glucose
production was significantly increased by Acc1 and -2 ASO treatment (Figure 4C). Acc1 and -2 therapy did not alter peripheral or
hepatic insulin sensitivity in chow-fed (control diet)rats(Figure 4,
A–C). Neither the Acc1 nor the Acc2 ASO significantly altered
insulin sensitivity (Supplemental Figure 1;supplemental material
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI27300DS1).
Effect of Acc1 and -2 ASO treatment on hepatic insulin signaling. We
have previously shown that NAFLD is associated with activation of
PKCε as reflected by an increase in the plasma membrane/cytosol
ratio of PKCε, an event which we believe may be causally related to
the development of hepatic insulin resistance (6). Acc1 and -2 ASO
therapy significantly reduced hepatic glucose production (HGP)
during the hyperinsulinemic phase of the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (Figure 5, A and B) and significantly reduced PKCε
membrane translocation (Figure 5C). These changes were associated with increased insulin-stimulated Akt2 activity (Figure 5D)
and forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 (Foxo1) phosphorylation
(Figure 5E). Foxo1 phosphorylation prevents Foxo1 from entering the nucleus and binding to promoters of target genes, such
as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6
phosphatase (G6P) (17, 18). PEPCK and G6P are key regulators of
HGP, and insulin suppresses endogenous glucose production, at
least in part, by lowering mRNA levels of PEPCK and G6P. While
PEPCKandG6PmRNAexpressionwere similarinbothgroupsinthe
fasted state, insulin-mediated suppression of their expression was
significantly increased in Acc1 and -2 ASO–treated rats (Figure 5,
F and G), explaining, at least in part, the reduction in HGP during
the hyperinsulinemic phase of the clamp.
Discussion
It is becoming increasingly clear that hepatic lipid accumulation
causes hepatic insulin resistance and contributes to the pathogenesis oftype 2 diabetes(2). Acc catalyzes a key rate-controlling step in
both de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Here we sought
to evaluate the metabolic effects of isoform-specific knockdown of
Acc1 and Acc2 in rat hepatocytes and the therapeutic potential of
pharmacological inhibition of Acc expression in the liverin ratswith
diet-induced fatty liver. The results show that Acc1 and Acc2 ASOs
selectively reduced ACC1 or ACC2 mRNA and protein expression in
hepatocytes. The effects were both isoform specific and tissue selective, and there was no apparent compensatory increase in the nontargeted isoform, enabling us to directly assess the biological roles
of each isoform in the liver for what we believe is the first time. Acc
ASOs also reduced ACC expression in adipose tissue (∼80%, data
notshown) but not in muscle. However, lowering Acc expression in
adipose tissue did not alter epididymalfat-padweight, bodyweight,
plasma-free fatty acids, or 2-deoxyglucose uptake in adipose tissue
(data notshown). While the tissue distribution patterns(Acc1 being
predominantly expressed in lipogenic tissues and Acc2 in oxidative
tissues) and intracellularlocalization (Acc2 has a mitochondrialtargeting sequence) of each isoform previously led to the notion that
cytosolic Acc1 regulates malonyl-CoA synthesis for incorporation
into fatty acids, whereas Acc2 regulates mitochondrial fatty acid
oxidation, this hypothesis has never been directly tested. Studies
in ACC2-knockout mice suggested that malonyl-CoA in the liver
was mainly produced by Acc1, which is the predominant isoform,
but the fact that ACC2-null mice had reduced liver lipids suggested
that malonyl-CoA produced by Acc2 in the immediate vicinity of
CPT1 regulated fatty acid oxidation without producing a detectable change in malonyl-CoA levels (12). However, ACC2-null mice
are substantially leaner than wild-type controls, making it difficult
to discern the direct impact of ACC2 knockdown on lipids in the
liver, and ACC1 null mice are embryonic lethal (14). ACC1+/– mice are
viable but appear to have normal Acc1 protein levelsin hepatocytes

(presumably as a result of altered translational regulation), making
it difficultto assessthe specific biologicalrole of Acc1 in this model
(14). ASO-induced inhibition of Acc2 in rat hepatocytes significantly increased fat oxidation without altering malonyl-CoA levels
in tissue extracts, in keepingwith the notion that Acc2 may regulate
malonyl-CoA levels in a localized pool in the proximity of CPT1.
Reduction of Acc1 alone also significantly increased fat oxidation
and inhibited fatsynthesis without detectably altering hepatic malonyl-CoA levels. These data suggest that, at least in rat hepatocytes
and in contrastto previous hypotheses(14), malonyl-CoA produced
by Acc1 appears to regulate both fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid
oxidation, whereas Acc2 is solely involved in regulating mitochondrial fat oxidation. This notion is further supported by the synergistic effect on fatty acid oxidation of simultaneously knocking
down both Acc isoforms. Reduction of Acc2 in addition to Acc1 has
no further inhibitory effect on lipogenesis. The dominant role of
Acc1 in regulating de novo lipogenesisis consistentwith embryonic
lethality in ACC1 knockouts as de novo synthesis oflong-chain fatty
acidsisrequired during mouse embryo development.
High-fat feeding in rats causes hepatic lipid accumulation and
insulin resistance within 3 days (6). The pattern of LCCoA accumulation (linoleic acid [18:2] is the major fatty acid constituent
of the diet used in this study and the major detectable LCCoA in
liver extracts in these rats) suggests that this is primarily a consequence of fatty acid re-esterification rather than de novo lipogenesis (6). Fatty acyl-CoA 18:2 is also the dominant LCCoA and the
dominant fatty acid in the DAG fraction in rat liver after 4 weeks
of high-fat feeding (data notshown),suggesting that re-esterification remains the dominant factor in the development of steatosis in high-fat–fed rats. Thus, we believe that the in vivo effects of
the Acc1 and -2 ASO are predominantly a result of increased fat
oxidation rather than a tendency to inhibit fat synthesis in this
model. Indirectsupport for this notion is provided by the increase
in plasma ketones, a marker of hepatic fat oxidation. Interestingly, the rise in plasma ketones was only detectable in the fed state.
Malonyl-CoA levels are lowerin the fasting state in rat liverthan in
the fed state, a result of hormonal and allosteric regulation of Acc
expression and activity (9), and it is not therefore particularly surprising that reduction of Acc1 and Acc2 expression had no further
effect on fasting ketone levels. Although fat oxidation occurs to a
significantly greater extent in the fasting state than in the fed state,
we believe that with time a relatively modest increase in fat oxidation in the fed state results in lower liver lipid levels and improved
hepatic insulin sensitivity. In contrast to the dramatic changes in
Figure 5
Acc1 and -2 ASO therapy improves hepatic insulin signaling. Acc1 and -2 ASO treatment does not alter basal HGP (A) but enhances insulin-mediated suppression of HGP in high-fat–fed rats (B). Reduced PKCε membrane translocation (C) may be directly involved in improving hepatic insulin 
signaling. This change is associated with increased Akt2 activity (D) and increased Foxo1 phosphorylation, which promotes nuclear exclusion of 
Foxo1, thereby lowering its transcriptional activity on the promoters of gluconeogenic genes, such as PEPCK and G6P. (D) Akt2 activity before

body weightseen in ACC2-null mice (12), Acc inhibition in the liver
in rats does not lower body weight. Asthe liver of a 400-g SpragueDawley rat only weighs about 15 g and the rats had unrestricted
access to high-fat food, it is not particularly surprising that selectively increasing fat oxidation in the liver in the fed state did not
result in a significant change in body weight. It would likely take
longer to see significant weight reduction with liver-specific Acc
reduction, as opposed to a global loss of Acc activity observed in
the ACC2-null mice. Recent data suggest that lowering malonylCoA levels in the hypothalamus could increase food intake (19),
an important concern for those developing pharmacological Acc
inhibitors; however, the intraperitoneally administered ASOs used
in this study do not alter target gene expression in the hypothalamus (15), and we did not detect any differences in food intake.
A growing body of evidence implicates serine phosphorylation
of insulin signaling intermediates in the pathogenesis of insulin
resistance (20, 21). Several candidate serine/threonine kinases
exist, one of which is the novel PKC (nPKC) family. We have previously suggested that hepatic lipid accumulation in high-fat–fed
rodents is associated with PKCε translocation to the plasma
membrane (6), a finding which was reversed by the Acc1 and -2
ASO. While TGs are typically associated with both hepatic and
muscle insulin resistance, they are widely perceived to be relatively
inert biologically. Instead, lipid intermediates such as LCCoAs
and DAGs are more favored candidates for triggering fat-induced
insulin resistance. The fact that mice deficient in mitochondrial
glycerol phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) are more insulin sensitive than wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet despite substantial
increases in hepatic LCCoAs suggests that DAG is a better candidate than LCCoA in this process(22). DAG is also a known activator of PKC (23–25), making it an excellent candidate for this role.
Acc1 and -2 ASO therapy decreased TG, LCCoA, and DAG accumulation, reduced PKCε membrane translocation, and improved
insulin-stimulated Akt2 activity. In addition, thisincreased Foxo1
phosphorylation and improved insulin-stimulated suppression of
gluconeogenic gene expression.
Lipid accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle is a feature
of both obesity and lipodystrophy and has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (21, 26). A number of strategies have been employed in
efforts to limit ectopic lipid accumulation, perhaps the most
effective being to limit food intake either by simple dieting (7)
or by restricting gastric capacity (gastric banding) (27). Leptin
replacement in leptin-deficient lipodystrophic mice (28) and
humans (29, 30) has a similar effect, with dramatic metabolic
benefits. However, given the limited impact of these approaches
in most people with fatty liver, several attempts have been made
to increase fat oxidation pharmacologically. A number of Acc
small molecule inhibitors (all of which appear to inhibit both
Acc1 and Acc2) have been tested in preclinical studies (31). In
general, they do increase fat oxidation and improve metabolic
indices. However, Acc inhibition in both the hypothalamus,
where lowering malonyl-CoA levels may increase food intake,
and pancreas, where lowering malonyl-CoA levels appears to
reduce insulin secretion at the cost of higher glucose levels in
obese mice (31), may be disadvantageous. Alternative strategies
have included adenoviral delivery of excess uncoupling protein
1 (UCP1) (32) or malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) (33) to the
liver. Both approaches led to significant reductions in liver lipids and improvements in hepatic insulin sensitivity.
In summary, the currentstudy suggeststhat both Acc1 and Acc2
are involved in regulating fat oxidation in hepatocytes while Acc1,
the dominant isoform in rat liver, isthe sole regulator of fatty acid
synthesis. Furthermore, in this model, combined reduction of
both isoforms is required to significantly lower hepatic malonylCoA levels, increase fat oxidation in the fed state,reduce lipid accumulation, and improve insulin action in vivo. Thus, hepatic Acc1
and -2 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of NAFLD and
hepatic insulin resistance.
Methods
Animals.Allratswere maintained in accordancewith the institutionalAnimal
Use and Care Committees of Yale University School of Medicine. Healthy
male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200–225 g were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories and acclimated for 1week after arrival before initiation of
the experiment.Ratsreceived food andwater ad libitum andwere maintained
on a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am). They were housed
individually, and food consumption and body weight were monitored. Rats
received eitherregularrodent chow (60% carbohydrate/10% fat/30% protein
calories) or a high-fat diet (26% carbohydrate/59% fat/15% protein calories).
Safflower oil was the major constituent of the high-fat diet (Dyets Inc.). We
have previously shown that this diet produces hepatic steatosis and hepatic
insulin resistancewithin 3 days(6). ASO therapywasinitiated i.p. 3 days after
commencing thehigh-fatdiet.AllASOs(control,Acc1,Acc2, andAcc1 and-2)
were prepared in normal saline, and the solutions were sterilized through a
0.2-µm filter. Rats were dosed with ASO solutions or saline twice per week
via i.p. injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg/wk for 4weeks. During the treatment
period, body weight and food intake were measured twice weekly. The Yale
Animal Care and Use Committee approved all protocols.
Selection of rat ACC ASOs.Rapid throughputscreenswere performed in vitro
to identify rat ACC1- and ACC2-specific ASOs. ASOs were screened in rat primary hepatocytesfortheir ability to inhibitACC1 orACC2 mRNAexpression,
as described previously (34). The most potent ASOs were further characterized, and the lead ASOs were selected forin vivo studies. An in vivo approach
was used to screen for the Acc1 and -2 ASO inhibitor. In brief, ASOs were
designed to target regions of nucleotide identity between ACC1 (GenBank
accession numberXM_109883) andACC2 (GenBank accession numberXM_
132282) and were administered to Sprague-Dawley rats at 75 mg/kg/wk for
2 weeks. Target reduction in the liver revealed approximately 80% reduction
of both ACC1 and ACC2 mRNA with the lead ASO. The final lead rat Acc1,
Acc2, and Acc1 and -2 ASOs used in the study were as follows: ISIS-338292,

022193 and 1950-1970bpAB004329,respectively).AllASOswere synthesized
as 20-base phosphorothioate chimericASOs,where bases 1–5 and 16–20were
modified with 2′-O-(2-methoxy)-ethyl (2′-MOE). This chimeric design has
been shown to provide both increased nuclease resistance and mRNA affinity while maintaining the robust RNase H terminating mechanism utilized
by these types ofASOs(35).These benefitsresultin an attractive in vivo pharmacological and toxicological profile for 2′-MOE chimericASOs.The control
ASO, ISIS-141923, has the same design and chemistry as the Acc ASOs with
the following sequence: 5′-CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC-3′. It does not
have perfect complementarity to any known gene in public databases.
Determination of fatty acid oxidation and TG synthesis in transfected rat hepatocytes
in vitro. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated as previously described and
plated onto collagen-coated 25-cm2 flasks for fatty acid oxidation measurement or 60-mm platesfor TG synthesis measurement(36). Hepatocyteswere
treated with ASO (150 nM) and Lipofectin (Invitrogen Corp.) mixture for 4
hours in serum-free William’s E media (Invitrogen Corp.). ASO and Lipo-

fectin were mixed in a ratio of 3 mg of Lipofectin for every 1 ml of 100 nM
ASO concentration. After 4 hours, ASO reaction mixture was replaced with
normal maintenance media (William’s E media with 10% FBS and 10 nM
insulin). The cellswere incubated under normal conditionsfor 20–24 hours,
and then fatty acid ([14C]oleate) oxidation and TG synthesis (incorporation
of [3H]glycerol into TGs) were measured as described previously (36).
Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies. Seven days priorto the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, indwelling catheters were placed into the
right internal jugular vein extending to the right atrium and the left carotid
artery extending to the aortic arch. After an overnight fast, [3-3H]-glucose
(HPLC purified; PerkinElmer) was infused at a rate of 0.33 µCi/min for
2 hours to assess the basal glucose turnover. Following the basal period,
the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was conducted for 120 minutes
with a primed/continuous infusion of human insulin (200 mU/kg prime,
4mU/kg/mininfusion)(NovoNordisk)andavariableinfusionof20%dextrose
to maintain euglycemia (∼100 mg/dl). [3-3H]-glucosewasinfused at a rate of
1.0µCi/minthroughouttheclamps.A25-mCibolusof2-deoxy-D-[1-14C]glucose
(PerkinElmer) was injected 75 minutes into the clamp to estimate the
rate of insulin-stimulated tissue glucose uptake. At the end of the clamp,
rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium injection (150 mg/kg)
and alltissueswere takenwithin 4 minutes, frozen immediately using liquid
N2-cooled aluminum tongs, and stored at –80°C forsubsequent analysis.
Biochemical analysis and calculations. Plasma glucose was analyzed during
the clamps using 10 µl plasma by a glucose oxidase method on a Beckman Coulter glucose analyzer II (Beckman Coulter). Plasma insulin, adiponectin, and leptin were measured by radioimmunoassay, using kitsfrom
Linco Research Inc. The adiponectin kit was primarily designed to measure
mouse adiponectin, butshowed significant cross-reactivity with rat adiponectin. Plasma fatty acid concentrations were determined using an acylCoA oxidase–based colorimetric kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.).
For the determination of plasma 3H-glucose, plasma was deproteinized
with ZnSO4 and Ba(OH)2, dried to remove 3H2O, resuspended in water,
and counted in scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold; PerkinElmer) on a Beckman scintillation counter. Rates of basal and insulin-stimulated wholebody glucose turnover were determined as the ratio of the [3-3H]-glucose
infusion rate (dpm) to the specific activity of plasma glucose (dpm/mg) at
the end of the basal period and during the final 30 minutes of the clamp
experiment, respectively. HGP was determined by subtracting the glucose
infusion rate from the rate of total glucose appearance.
Tissue lipid measurement. The solid-phase extraction and purification of
medium, long-chain, and very long–chain fatty acyl-CoAs from liver have
been described previously (37, 38). After purification, fatty acyl-CoA fractions were dissolved in methanol/H2O (1:1, v/v) and subjected to liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)
analysis. A turbo ion spray source wasinterfaced with an API 3000 tandem
massspectrometer(Applied Biosystems) in conjunctionwith 2 PerkinElmer
200 Series micro pumps and a 200 Series autosampler (PerkinElmer). The
DAG extraction and analysis were performed as previously described (25,
39). Total DAG content is expressed as the sum of individual species. Tissue TG was extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (37) and measured using a DCL TG Reagent (Diagnostic Chemicals Ltd).
Tissue malonyl-CoA content. Approximately 100 mg of liver tissue was
homogenized in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid with the addition of
13C3–malonyl-CoA internalstandard. After centrifugation,the supernatant
was applied to a preconditioned cartridge (C18 Waters Sep-Pak Cartridge,
Waters Corp.) and, following washing steps, eluted with 65% ethanol containing 0.1 M NH4-acetate and 50% methanol. Samples were lyophilized
and redissolved in water. Malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA were separated
by HPLC with isocratic 15% methanol and 10 mM ammonium acetate.
Malonyl-CoA was measured using LC/MS/MS analysis.
Liver Akt2 activity, Foxo1 phosphorylation, and PKCε membrane translocation. Akt2 activity and Foxo1 phosphorylation were assessed in protein
extractsfrom livers harvested aftershort-term (20 min) insulin stimulation
(200 mU/kg prime, 4 mU/kg/min infusion) in combination with 20% dextrose to maintain euglycemia (100 mg/dl). Assays were performed according to methods previously described (6, 40, 41). Primary antibodies used for
these experiments were rabbit polyclonal IgGs(Cell Signaling Technology).
For PKCε membrane translocation, 50 µg of crude membrane and cytosol
protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 8% gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (DuPont) using a semidrytransfer cell (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked for 2 hours at
room temperature in PBS-Tween (PBS-T) (10 mmol/liter NaH2PO4,
80 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 0.145 mol/liter NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4)
containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, washed twice, and then incubated
overnight with rabbit anti-peptide antibody against PKCε (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc.) diluted 1:100 in rinsing solution. After further washings, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
IgG fraction of goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:5,000 in PBS-T for
2 hours. PKCε translocation was expressed asthe ratio of membrane bands
to cytosol bands (arbitrary units).
Quantitative RT-PCR–based gene expression analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR
was performed essentially as previously described (42). Briefly, RNA
was isolated using a commercially available kit (QIAGEN RNeasy Kit;
QIAGEN) in combination with DNase digest treatment. After 1.0 µg of
total RNA was reverse transcribed (Stratagene) with an oligo-prime, PCR
was performed with a DNA Engine Opticon 2 System (MJ Research;
Bio-Rad) using SYBR green qPCR dye kit (Stratagene). Primer sequences
are presented in Supplemental Table 1. Afterthe PCR,standard curves were
constructed from the standard reactionsfor each target mRNA species and
18s mRNA by plotting values for Ct (the number of PCR cycles at which
the fluorescence signal exceeds background) versus log cDNA input (in
nanograms, arbitrarily assigned). The Ct readings for each of the samples
were then used to calculate the amount of mRNA for each target gene relative to the standard. For each sample, results were normalized by dividing
the amount of target gene mRNA by the amount of 18s mRNA.
Statistics. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Two-tailed Student’s t
tests or 1-way ANOVA plus Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference)
multiple comparisons were performed on data with significance set at a
P value of 0.05.
