Abstract
The precise roles of mast cells in liver allograft rejection and tolerance are still unknown. This study aimed to explore the
roles of mast cells in immune regulation and liver regeneration for tolerance induction by using rat models of orthotopic
liver transplantation (OLT). Stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor c-Kit, which are critical to the migration and development
of not only stem cells but also mast cells, significantly increased in the tolerogenic livers as compared with rejected livers.
The significant elevation of mast cell tryptase, high-affinity IgE receptor, and histamine suggested the activation of mast
cells in liver allografts at the tolerogenic phase after OLT. Immunohistochemical analysis using confocal microscope clearly
showed colocalization of mast cells, Foxp3+ Tregs, cd T cells, and recipient-derived hepatic progenitor cells with higher
expression of SCF, IL-9, IL-10, TGF-b1, and IL-17 related to immunoregulation and liver regeneration in the donor grafts of a
tolerogenic OLT model. Cross-talk among mast cells and other cells was evaluated by in vitro studies demonstrating that
syngeneic bone marrow2derived mast cells (BMMCs) co-cultured with naı¨ve splenocytes or primary hepatocytes
significantly increased the population of splenic cd T cells by mitogen stimulation or by mast cell degranulation, and also
significantly induced the hepatocyte proliferation, respectively. Our results suggested that mast cells in the donor grafts
may play important roles in the induction/maintenance of immune tolerance and liver regeneration resulting in the
replacement of hepatic cells from donor to recipient.

Introduction
The first successful orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in
humans was performed in 1963 [1], and OLT has now become a
therapeutic approach for end-stage liver disease (e.g., liver
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, biliary atresia, neonatal
hepatitis). For the prevention of allograft rejection, immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporine have
contributed to the field of organ transplantation and are an
effective therapeutic modality [2]. Pharmacological roles of
immunosuppressants in the tolerance process are not yet clarified,
but it has been suggested the adverse effect of immunosuppressants
on the development of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) [3,4,5].
Furthermore, Danecke et al. demonstrated the interference of
cyclosporine with tolerance induction in vivo [6]. To date, random
trials to withdraw immunosuppressive drugs from long-time
surviving patients who not had a rejection episode are currently
being performed. However, these random trials, which lack
unified standard to evaluate the degree of rejection, have not
precisely determined the timing when immunosuppressive therapy
should be reduced or terminated. As a result, some recipients
would have the good fortune to achieve operational tolerance with
increased number of Tregs, including Foxp3+ T cells and cd T
cells in peripheral blood after liver transplantation [7,8], but other
patients would have a risk of rejection again. Therefore, complete
understanding of humoral and cellular events in the rejection and
tolerance process is crucial to safety withdraw immunosuppressive
drugs, which will contribute to alleviate the physical, mental, and
financial anguish related to liver transplantation therapy.
In general, organ allograft rejection can be defined as an
immunological reaction in response to the presence of a foreign
tissue or organ, which may potentially result in graft dysfunction
and failure [9]. Liver allograft rejection has been divided into
hyperacute (humoral), acute (cellular), and chronic (ductopenic
and/or arteriopathic) processes [10]. In recent years, many studies
have suggested that hepatic mast cells are involved in chronic
rejection [11], hepatic fibrogenesis [12,13,14,15], and cholestatic

liver diseases [13,16]. Although mast cells are seen in normal liver
surrounding the vessels and the bile ducts in the portal tracts, and
to a much lesser extent, in the hepatic parenchyma [13], hepatic
mast cells infiltrating portal tracts and surrounding damaged bile
ducts have been focused as important effector cells in the
pathogenesis of chronic rejection [11]. Immunologically, mast
cells are important effector cells in a broad range of immune
response [12]. Immediate hypersensitivity and host defense
mechanisms against parasites are closely related to mast cell
function [17]. Furthermore, mast cells have been implicated in
fibrosis related to the rejection process of other organ transplantation including renal [18,19,20], lung [21], and heart transplantation [22,23].
On the other hand, findings in skin transplantation by Lu et al.
[24] have provided substantial evidence for the role of mast cells in
Treg2mediated immunoregulatory activities by demonstrating
that mast cells are crucial for allograft tolerance through the
inability to induce tolerance in mast-cell-deficient mice. In
addition, Boerma et al. reported that the absence of mast cells is
associated with significantly reduced cardiac allograft survival after
heterotopic heart transplantation in rats [25]. However, until
recently, little attention has been given to the study of hepatic mast
cells in terms of Treg2mediated immune tolerance such as
Foxp3+ T cells and cd T cells since the precise roles of hepatic
mast cells in tolerogenic livers have not been elucidated.
In the present study, we characterize hepatic mast cells and
related factors, such as stem cell factor (SCF), c-Kit, high-affinity
IgE receptor (FceRIa) and mast cell2specific enzymes, in liver
allografts at the rejection and tolerogenic phases and discuss the
immunological aspects of hepatic mast cells on liver allograft
rejection and tolerance by using rat models of OLT in the
rejecting and tolerogenic combinations. We also discuss the
significance of migration and differentiation of bone marrow2-
derived stem cells into hepatic stem/progenitor cells in tolerogenic
livers after OLT.
Results
Liver histology in rejected and tolerant livers
Immunology in liver transplantation is unique and depends on
combination of rat strains used for donors and recipients. In the
DA donor livers into PVG recipients, allograft rejection is
spontaneously overcome after OLT, resulting in a state of longlasting and donor-specific tolerance without pharmacological
immunosuppression although PVG recipients acutely reject skin,
heart, and renal grafts from DA rats [26]. Interestingly, PVG
recipients bearing DA livers could accept skin, heart, and kidney
from the DA donor rats but rejected them from the third party
strains of rats [27,28]. This donor-specific tolerance could be
transferred to naı¨ve animals by serum transfusion obtained from
the recipient PVG rats .60 days after OLT [29]. In contrast,
recipient LEW rats usually reject a donor DA rat liver within 14
days after OLT [30]. Liver histology demonstrated the massive
infiltration of immune cells and the damage to hepatic parenchyma at the rejection phase (day 7) after OLT both in DA-PVG and
DA-LEW combinations, while tolerogenic livers at .60 days after
OLT showed less inflammation (Fig. 1).
Significance of SCF in liver allograft tolerance
SCF is a growth factor that is important for the survival,
proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and
other hematopoietic progenitor cells, including mast cells [31]. To
explore the role of hepatic mast cells in liver allograft rejection and
tolerance, we checked the hepatic levels of SCF. As shown in
Table 1, the hepatic level of SCF significantly increased at the
tolerogenic phase after OLT compared with naı¨ve and rejected
livers, suggesting the presence of c-Kit+ hematopoietic stem/
progenitor cells and mast cells in tolerogenic livers.
Activation of hepatic mast cells in liver allografts at the
tolerogenic phase after OLT
We next evaluated hepatic mast cell activation by quantitative
real-time PCR analysis. As shown in Table 1, hepatic level of c-Kit
significantly increased both at rejection and tolerogenic phases in a
rat tolerogenic OLT model. On the other hand, we observed
significant elevation of mast cell tryptase (Tpsab1) and high-affinity
IgE receptor (FceRIa) at the tolerogenic phase after OLT,
suggesting the activation of hepatic mast cells in liver allografts
at the tolerogenic phase after OLT. The lower expression of TNFa in liver allografts at the tolerogenic phase suggested that the
activation of hepatic mast cells might not be associated with
chronic rejection.
Induction of cd T cells and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells after
OLT
To explore the roles of Tregs in liver allograft tolerogenicity, we
next evaluated the hepatic levels of Foxp3, TCR c chain, and the
inhibitory cytokine IL-10 at both the rejection and tolerogenic
phases after OLT. As shown in Table 2, the early elevation of
Foxp3, TCR c chain, and IL-10 suggested the involvement of
Tregs in overcoming rejection and the subsequent tolerance
induction.
Colocalization of hepatic mast cells and Tregs in
tolerogenic liver allografts
Lu et al. have provided evidence that CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs seem
to produce IL-9 and, through the production of IL-9, may mediate
the recruitment and activities of mast cells in vivo [24]. To
characterize the association between hepatic mast cells and Tregs
in liver allograft tolerance, immunohistochemical analysis was
performed. As shown in Fig. 2, we observed the colocalization of
hepatic mast cells (mast cell protease 1 [MCP1]-producing cells)
and Tregs (Foxp3+ cells and cd T cells) in liver allografts at the
tolerogenic phase after OLT. Furthermore, we observed the
production of SCF by Foxp3+ Tregs. SCF and IL-9 were
colocalized in the tolerogenic liver allografts, suggesting Foxp3+
Tregs produced these cytokines to activate hepatic mast cells.
Protein levels of SCF and IL-9 in liver allografts were also
correlated with the activation of Foxp3 and IL-10 production
(Fig. 3A), resulting in hyperplasia and the activation of hepatic
mast cells as assessed by toluidine blue staining (Fig. 3B) and
histamine production (Fig. 3C). In addition, we observed the
replacement of both hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells from
the donor MHC haplotype (RT1Aa) to the recipient haplotype
(RT1Ac) (Fig. 2).
TGF-b1/IL-172producing mast cells and cd T cells in
tolerogenic liver allografts
Mast cells produce TGF-b1 to regulate Treg2mediated
immune tolerance in vitro [32]. On the other hand, cd T cells
are innate sources of IL-17, a potent proinflammatory cytokine
mediating bacterial clearance as well as autoimmunity [33,34,35].
To further explore the cross-talk among hepatic mast cells, Foxp3+
Tregs, and cd T cells in liver allograft tolerogenicity, we performed
immunohistochemical analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, we observed
the production of TGF-b1 and IL-17 by hepatic mast cells and cd
T cells, respectively.

Induction of cd T cells by mast cells co-cultured with
splenocytes
Zhang et al. recently demonstrated the induction of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs when bone marrow-derived mast cells
(BMMCs) were co-cultured with T cells in vitro [32]. However,
little is known about the cross-talk between mast cells and cd T
cells. To investigate whether BMMCs can induce splenic cd T
cells in vitro, splenocytes were co-cultured with syngeneic BMMCs
together with mitogen stimulation. As shown in Fig. 5B, the
percentage of cd T cells significantly increased in a cell ratiodependent manner. To evaluate the role of humoral factors
secreted from the mast cells, compound 48/80, which is known as
a histamine-liberating substance [36], was added in the culture
medium. Pharmacological induction of mast cell degranulation by
compound 48/80 strongly induced the cd T cells generation,
suggesting the involvement of mast cell mediators such as
histamine for activation of cd T cells (Fig. 5C).
Significance of migration and transdifferentiation of
bone marrow2derived stem cells into hepatocytes and
non-parenchymal cells in tolerogenic livers
Combining granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with a
dipeptidylpeptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor can promote mobilization and migration of recipient bone marrow2derived hematopoietic stem cells into ischemically injured areas, resulting in tissue
regeneration after acute myocardial infarction [37]. Hepatic
progenitor cells appear in injured livers when hepatocyte
proliferation is impaired. These cells can differentiate into
hepatocytes and cholangiocytes [38]. To explore the migration
and transdifferentiation of bone marrow2derived stem cells into

hepatic cells in tolerogenic livers, we next evaluated the hepatic
levels of DPP-IV and markers for hepatic progenitor cells, such as
a-fetoprotein (AFP), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM),
which marks hepatocytes newly derived from hepatic stem/
progenitor cells [39], and cytokeratin (CK)-18, which is known as
a hepatocytic marker [40], at the rejection and tolerogenic phases
after OLT. As shown in Table 3, DPP-IV level in OLT livers was
significantly lower than that in naı¨ve livers, suggesting the
accessibility of bone marrow2derived stem cells to the rejected
and tolerant livers. In addition to the c-Kit (Table 1), on the other
hand, the hepatic level of AFP significantly increased in the DAPVG rejected livers, suggesting the transdifferentiation of bone
marrow2derived stem cells into hepatic progenitor cells at the
rejection phase in a rat tolerogenic OLT model. AFP level in the
tolerogenic livers was significantly lower than that in naı¨ve livers,
while EpCAM and CK-18 were significantly higher in the
tolerogenic livers compared with naı¨ve and rejected livers. We
also confirmed the existence of recipient-derived EpCAM+
/CK18+ hepatic cells newly derived from the hepatic progenitor cells,
suggesting the hepatic differentiation of bone marrow2derived
stem cells in tolerogenic livers (Fig. 6).
Induction of liver regeneration by mast cells co-cultured
with primary hepatocytes
To investigate the direct role of mast cells on liver regeneration,
primary hepatocytes were co-cultured with syngeneic BMMCs
and hepatic cell growth was evaluated by MTT assay. As shown in
Fig. 7, the percent survival of hepatocytes significantly increased in
a cell ratio-dependent manner.
Discussion
In this study, we revealed the dynamics of c-Kit, mast cells,
Tregs, and hepatic stem/progenitor cells in liver allograft rejection
and tolerance. We confirmed the elevation of c-Kit in liver
allografts at the rejection phase, particularly in a rat tolerogenic
OLT model (DA-PVG). Based on the lower expression of mast cell
tryptase in rejected livers, we speculate that the early induction of
c-Kit may reflect the migration of endogenous hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells derived from bone marrow to repair/replace
damaged tissue rather than to activated mast cells. In support of
our hypothesis, we observed the massive replacement of both
hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells from the donor MHC

haplotype (RT1Aa) to the recipient haplotype (RT1Ac) at the
tolerogenic phase after OLT. We also confirmed the elevation of
AFP in the DA-PVG rejected livers probably reflecting the
induction of hepatic stem/progenitor cells in the liver allografts,
resulting in the liver regeneration for replacement of donor-type
hepatic cells. Replacement of donor Kupffer cells by recipient cells
after OLT has been reported previously [41,42], resulting in the
mild rejection response observed in both experimental and clinical
liver transplantation. In addition, transdifferentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into hepatocytes was reported in rats [43],
humans [44], and mice [45]. Theise et al. reported that 4 to 43%
of hepatocytes were replaced by recipient (male, Y chromosome+
)
cells after grafting of female liver allografts [44]. However, the
transdifferentiation of recipient bone marrow2derived stem cells
into parenchymal cells is an extremely rare event in liver, small
intestine, and heart allografts [46]. Our animal model may be a
good resource for understanding the transdifferentiation of
endogenous stem cells in liver allograft tolerogenicity.
In addition to the induction of c-Kit+ cells, Foxp3+ Tregs, and
cd T cells dramatically migrated to liver allografts at the rejection
phase after OLT. Foxp3+ Tregs possess immune-regulatory
functions by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10
and TGF-b1 [47,48]. Similar to our data, Li et al. recently
reported the induction of Foxp3 and IL-10 in liver allografts at the
rejection phase after OLT in BN-to-LEW combinations [49]. The
gene expression of Foxp3 and IL-10 in the rejected livers (day 7)
was higher than those in the tolerant livers (.day 60), while the
protein expression of Foxp3 and IL-10 was opposite fashion.
These data suggested that Foxp3 and IL-10 were transcriptionally
active but translationally inactive in the rejected livers. Time lags
between transcription and translation of Foxp3 and IL-10 are
predicted and may explain the different patterns of gene and
protein expression. cd T cells are innate-type lymphocytes that act
as regulators of local effector immune responses and are an innate
source of IL-17, resulting in the enhancement of autoimmunity
[33,34,35]. They are abundant in the liver and are involved in
anti-tumor surveillance and immune regulation [50]. However,
the fundamental roles of cd T cells in transplant rejection and
tolerance have not been well documented. In this study, we
demonstrated the upregulation of cd T cells in liver allografts
compared with naı¨ve DA livers. In our previous studies, we
demonstrated that the autoimmune response against nuclear
antigens such as histone H1 might be an important phenomenon
in overcoming rejection and in subsequent tolerance induction in a
rat tolerogenic OLT model [51,52,53,54]. The significance of
autoimmunity against nuclear antigens such as histones and highmobility group box 1 in immune regulation has been demonstrated [55,56]. We speculate that the existence of anti-nuclear autoAbs in the systemic circulation may regulate uncontrolled immune

responses and that cd T cells may regulate the balance of
autoimmunity and alloimmunity. Taken together, the early
induction of c-Kit, Foxp3+ Tregs, and cd T cells may be
indispensable for overcoming acute rejection and the subsequent
tolerance induction.
In this study, we explored the cross-talk among hepatic mast
cells, Foxp3+ Tregs, and cd T cells in liver allograft tolerogenicity.
In addition to the production of IL-9, Foxp3+ Tregs may produce
SCF to activate hepatic mast cells; in turn, activating mast cells
may produce TGF-b1. It has also been demonstrated the crosstalk between mast cells and Tregs through the production of IL-2
by mast cells which enhances the proportion of Tregs at the site of
inflammation [57]. On the other hand, IL-17 indirectly attracts
Foxp3+ Tregs, enhances their suppressor function, and induces IL9 production by Foxp3+ Tregs; in turn, IL-9 strengthens the
survival and protumor effects of mast cells in the tumor
microenvironment [58]. TGF-b1 also plays a key role in the
generation of IL-172producing cd T cells [35]. Our in vitro data
also demonstrated the generation of cd T cells by pharmacological
induction of mast cell degranulation. In support of our data, it has
been demonstrated the activation of cd T cells by histamine [59].
From the regenerative point of view, SCF/c-Kit signaling, IL-10,
TGF-b1, and histamine play important roles in the regulation of
liver regeneration [60,61,62,63]. Our in vitro data clearly
demonstrated the induction of hepatic cell proliferation by coculture with mast cells. Based on our present and other findings,
we propose an intrinsic relationship among mast cells, Foxp3+
Tregs, and cd T cells in tolerogenic livers (Fig. 8).
In summary, our data suggest that early induction of c-Kit,
Foxp3+ Tregs, and cd T cells may be indispensable for
overcoming acute rejection and that Foxp3+ Tregs, cd T cells,
and hepatic mast cells may play important roles in the induction
and maintenance of immune tolerance and liver regeneration by
producing SCF, IL-9, IL-10, TGF-b1, IL-17, and histamine.
Massive replacement of donor cells, including hepatocytes, by
recipient cells may contribute to overcoming the rejection and the
subsequent induction of tolerance without immunosuppressive
treatment in the DA-PVG combination. Further studies, including
a cell-based analysis of cytokine production, cell2cell interactions,
and the effects of various cytokines and cells on liver regeneration,
should be performed to improve our understanding of humoral
and cellular responses in liver allograft tolerogenicity.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
Our experimental design was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval No:
2009080401), and the Committee recognizes that the proposed
animal experiment follows the Animal Protection Law by the
Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. and the guideline
as shown in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as promulgated by the. Institute of Laboratory Animal
Resources, National Research Council, USA.
Animals
Male DA (MHC haplotype RT1a) and PVG (RT1c) rats that
were 4 weeks of age were obtained from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu,
Japan) and the Institute of Laboratory Animals of the Graduate
School of Medicine, Kyoto University (Kyoto, Japan), respectively.
Male LEW (RT1l
) rats 4 weeks of age were obtained from the
National Laboratory Animal Breeding and Research Center
(Taipei, Taiwan). All animals were maintained in specific
pathogen2free animal facilities with water and commercial rat
food provided ad libitum.
Orthotopic liver transplantation
OLT was carried out following the technique previously
described by Kamada et al. [64] in the following combinations:
DA to PVG (DA-PVG; natural tolerance model) and DA to LEW
(DA-LEW; acute rejection model). All serum samples and liver
grafts were stored at 280uC until analysis.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR
RNA was extracted using REzolTM reagent (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions from a rat liver harvested at the rejection phase
(postoperative day 7: n = 6) and at the tolerogenic phase
(postoperative day 60 to 85: n = 6). Total RNA (1.2 mg) was
reverse-transcribed into cDNA with ImProm-IITM Reverse
Transcriptase (Promega Corporation). The rat-specific PCR
primers are shown in Table 4. Quantitative PCR of GAPDH,
SCF, c-Kit, mast cell tryptase (Tpsab1), FceRIa, TNF-a, Foxp3,
TCR c chain, IL-10, DPP-IV, AFP, EpCAM, and CK-18 cDNAs
was performed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster, CA, USA). The GAPDH
reference gene was used to normalize the data. The 22D.CT value,
which corresponds to the expression of each gene compared to
GAPDH, and 22D.D.CT, which corresponds to the expression ratio
of each gene in the experimental group compared to the control,
were calculated.
Histological evaluation and immunohistochemical
analysis
Liver tissues were taken at postoperative day 7 (rejection phase)
and day 60 to 85 (tolerogenic phase) from rejecting (DA-LEW) and
Figure 7. Induction of liver regeneration by BMMCs. Primary
hepatocytes (26105 cells) were co-cultured with syngeneic BMMCs (0, 2

tolerogenic (DA-PVG) OLT rats, embedded in Tissue-TekH OCT
compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, USA), frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at 280uC until analysis. Liver tissues from
naı¨ve DA rats were used as a control.
For histological evaluation, cryosections (6 mm thick) were fixed
with phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (4%; pH 7.0) for
10 min at room temperature and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin or toluidine blue (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All sections were examined using a light
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
For immunohistochemical analysis, cryosections (6 mm thick)
were fixed with phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (4%;
pH 7.0) for 10 min at 4uC. Nonspecific proteins were then
blocked using Power BlockTM Reagent (BioGenex Laboratories,
Inc., San Ramon, CA, USA) for 1 hr. The sections were incubated
at 4uC for overnight with goat polyclonal Ab against MCP1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) (650 dilution with Ab
dilution buffer, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); mouse monoclonal Ab
against cd TCR (6100; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA),
Foxp3 (6200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IL-9 (6200; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or CK-18 (6100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA);
rabbit polyclonal Ab against SCF (6200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IL-17 (6100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or TGF-b1 (650;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit monoclonal Ab against
EpCAM (6100; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA); or rat
polyclonal Ab against RT1Ac (6100; AbD Serotec, MorphoSys
UK Ltd., Oxford, UK). The sections were rinsed with PBS
supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20, then incubated with Alexa
FluorH 4882conjugated donkey anti-goat, mouse or rabbit IgG
(61000; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), HyLite FluorTM 5942conjugated goat anti-mouse or
rabbit IgG (61000; Ana Spec Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) or Alexa
FluorH 6472conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (61000; Molecular
Probes, Invitrogen Corporation) for 30 min. The nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen
Corporation). All sections were examined using an Olympus
FV10i confocal laser scanning microscope.
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses
To detect the protein expression of SCF, IL-9, IL-10, and
Foxp3 in livers, naı¨ve DA livers and liver allografts at rejection
(DA-PVG and DA-LEW) and during the tolerogenic phase after
OLT (DA-PVG) were manually homogenized with T-PERH
Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Rockford, IL, USA) supplemented with protease inhibitor
complete (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After
centrifugation, liver extracts (100 mg) were run on a 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
gel using a mini gel apparatus (Bio-Rad, Burlington, MA, USA),
and fractionated proteins were electronically transferred onto a
polyvinylidene fluoride transfer membrane (GE Healthcare BioSciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA). The membrane was
blocked using 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 hr and
immunoprobed with rabbit polyclonal Ab against SCF (62000
dilution with 5% skim milk/PBST; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
mouse monoclonal Ab against IL-9 (62000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Foxp3 (62000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or goat
polyclonal Ab against IL-10 (62000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (65000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), goat antimouse IgG (610000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or donkey antigoat IgG (610000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were
visualized using an ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System
(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.), and relevant bands were
quantified by densitometry using a G:BOX Image Station iChemi
XL device (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). The data were normalized
to actin expression.

ELISA
To check the hepatic levels of histamine, liver extracts (1 mg)
were acylated and assayed in duplicate using a Histamine ELISA
kit (Labor Diagnostika Nord GmbH & Co.KG, Nordhorn,
Germany). The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a
Victor X4 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA,
USA)
Preparation of bone marrow-derived mast cells
Bone marrow cells were harvested from femurs of LEW rats and
cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, 1 mM HEPES, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were cultured in
the presence of 10 ng/ml of recombinant rat IL-3b (PeproTech,
Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), and the nonadherent cells were passaged
every 3 days. 4 weeks later, the cells were used as mast cells for
experiments and referred to as BMMCs [65]. At the time of use,
more than 98% of the cells were identified as mast cells by
Toluidine blue staining (Fig. 5A).
Immunophenotyping of splenocytes co-cultured with
BMMCs
LEW rat splenocytes were harvested and treated with lysis
buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 15 mM NaHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA2Na
[pH 7.3]) to lyse red blood cells. After washing twice with PBS,
splenocytes were suspended with RPMI-1640 medium (SigmaAldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 1 mM HEPES, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and splenocytes (2.56106 cells) were co-cultured with syngeneic BMMCs (0,
1.25, 2.5 and 56106 cells) and stimulated with Concanavalin A
(2.5 mg/ml) at 37uC for 72 hrs in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2/95% air. For induction of mast cell degranulation, 10 mg/ml
of compound 48/80 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added in the culture
media. The cells (106 cells/100 ml) were incubated at 4 uC for
30 min with mouse monoclonal Ab against rat TCR cd chain
(1 mg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed twice with PBS and
then incubated at 4 uC for 30 min with FITC2conjugated goat
anti-mouse Ig (1 mg; BD Biosciences). After washing twice with
PBS, the cells were analyzed by LSRII flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Preparation of primary hepatocytes
Primary hepatocytes were purified from naı¨ve LEW rats by the
two-step liver perfusion method [66]. Briefly, under anaesthesia by
intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital, LEW rat liver was
perfused via the portal vein with buffer I (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM
KCl, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.4 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM HEPES,
0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4) at 37uC, followed by in
situ digestion with buffer II (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 5 mM
CaCl2, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 0.4 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM HEPES,
0.05% collagenase IV, pH 7.4) at 37uC. The liver was then
excised and hepatocytes were separated from the liver by gently
shaking. After filtration, hepatocytes were purified by a percoll
gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.), and
washed twice with ice-cold 10% FCS DMEM medium (Invitrogen
Corporation). The isolated hepatocytes were suspended in DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 15 mmol/l HEPES
(pH 7.4), 1 mmol/l insulin, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin.
Cell growth assay
Primary hepatocytes (26105 cells) were pre-cultured on
collagen-coated 6-well plates for 24 hrs, and non-adhesion cells
were removed. After addition the new culture medium, hepatocytes were co-cultured with syngeneic BMMCs (0, 2 and 46105
cells) at 37uC for 72 hrs in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/
95% air. After washing twice with PBS, new culture medium was
added together with MTT reagents (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA), and cultured for 4 hr. After color development, each
sample were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates (Nalge Nunc
International, Roskilde, Denmark), and the absorbance (595 nm)
was measured using a Victor X4 Multilabel Plate Reader
(PerkinElmer).
Statistical analysis
Student’s t-tests were used to determine the significance of the
difference between normally distributed means of value in two
groups. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and results are
indicated as mean 6 SD.
