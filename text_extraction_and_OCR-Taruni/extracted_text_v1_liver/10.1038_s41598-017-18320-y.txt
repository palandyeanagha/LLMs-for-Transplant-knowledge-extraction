Cirrhosis patients have reduced peak aerobic power (peak VO2) that is associated with reduced survival. 
Supervised exercise training increases exercise tolerance. The efect of home-based exercise training 
(HET) in cirrhosis is unknown. The objective was to evaluate the safety and efcacy of 8 weeks of HET 
on peak VO2, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), muscle mass, and quality of life in cirrhosis. Random 
assignment to 8 weeks of HET (moderate to high intensity cycling exercise, 3 days/week) or usual 
care. Exercise adherence defned as completing ≥80% training sessions. Paired t-tests and analysis of 
covariance used for comparisons. Forty patients enrolled: 58% male, mean age 57y, 70% Child Pugh-A. 
Between group increases in peak VO2 (1.7, 95% CI: −0.33 to 3.7ml/kg/min, p=0.09) and 6MWD (33.7, 
95% CI: 5.1 to 62.4m, p=0.02) were greater after HET versus usual care. Improvements even more 
marked in adherent subjects for peak VO2 (2.8, 95% CI: 0.5–5.2mL/kg/min, p=0.02) and 6MWD (46.4, 
95% CI: 12.4–80.5m, p=0.009). No adverse events occurred during testing or HET. Eight weeks of HET 
is a safe and efective intervention to improve exercise capacity in cirrhosis, with maximal benefts 
occurring in those who complete ≥80% of the program.
In addition to the well-known health complications that arise with liver dysfunction1
, it is increasingly recognized 
that many patients with cirrhosis also have severe physical deconditioning, sarcopenia, and physical frailty2–5
. 
Tese prevalent, interwoven conditions limit normal daily activities, increase the risks for pre-transplant death 
and removal from liver transplant wait lists2,3,6
, and lengthen hospital stays post-transplantation7–11.
The peak aerobic power, as measured by the peak VO2, is the most objective and integrated measure of 
impaired exercise capacity; an increase of 3.5 mL/kg/min is associated with a survival advantage in patients 
referred for cardiac testing12. Abnormalities in the peak VO2 have been independently linked to the severity of 
hepatic dysfunction across the cirrhosis patient spectrum. Even patients with well compensated, early stage cirrhosis, have an approximately 40% lower peak VO2 relative to healthy controls8,13.
Unlike most advanced liver-related complications, exercise capacity is potentially modifable with changes in 
nutrition and exercise therapy. Our group and others have confrmed that supervised exercise training signifcantly improves peak VO2, muscle mass, and fatigue, and reduces the hepatic venous pressure gradient in patients 
with Child-Pugh A or B cirrhosis14–16.
Although clinically advantageous, the delivery of exercise using a supervised, site-based training environment 
does not meet the needs of many patients with cirrhosis. Individually, patients report many barriers to participation, including issues with transportation, parking availability, out-of-pocket costs, poor health, and interference 
with domestic responsibilities as well as social and work obligations17,18.

Home-based exercise training (HET) is an alternative delivery modality that has several advantages. It is less 
biased in its potential inclusion of highly motivated patients and simulates a program that can be continued in 
the long-term. Moreover, home-based programs are ofen more cost-efective than site-based ones, fexible with 
the timing of exercise sessions, and accessible to all patients. Although data have been discordant, the lack of 
direct supervision can result in a loss of exercise efcacy19–21. To date, there has been no data on the efcacy of 
home-based exercise interventions in cirrhosis.
We have conducted the largest randomized controlled trial (RCT) in cirrhosis to assess the efcacy of an 
8-week HET program on peak VO2 (primary outcome), aerobic endurance, muscle mass, quality of life, and 
safety. We tested the hypothesis that HET would signifcantly improve peak VO2, aerobic endurance, 6MWD, 
muscle mass, and quality of life without adverse events compared to a usual care (UC) group.
Results
Baseline characteristics. As shown in Fig. 1, 60 patients were approached at one of two tertiary care liver 
clinics in Alberta (University of Alberta Hospital and Royal Alexandra Hospital) of which 40 were eligible to participate. Seven patients were excluded because of comorbid illnesses that precluded participation (cardiac n=2, 
dialysis n=1, hepatocellular carcinoma n=2, and inability to use the exercise bike n=2). Te remaining 13 were 
not interested in participating.
Baseline characteristics (Table 1) of recruited patients showed that 58% were male, mean age was 57 years, 
mean MELD was 9.4±2.9, 70% had Child-Pugh A disease and 30% had Child-Pugh B cirrhosis. Te majority 
of patients had either alcohol- or hepatitis C-related cirrhosis. Tirty-fve percent of the patients were taking 
diuretics and 28% met criteria for either primary or secondary esophageal variceal prophylaxis in advance of 
participating in the RCT. Te groups were well-matched apart from a chance occurrence of a signifcantly lower 
baseline peak VO2 in patients randomized to HET (Table 1).
Primary Outcome Measure (Peak VO2). Comparing the changes from baseline to post-intervention, 
there was a signifcant increase in peak VO2 (L/min and indexed to body mass) within the HET cohort and no 
change found in UC. Te between group comparison of changes in peak VO2 did not reach signifcance (Table 2, 
Fig. 2).
Secondary Outcome Measures. Within the HET patient group, a statistically signifcant mean increase 
in aerobic endurance was found using the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD; 33.7m, 95% CI: 5.1 to 62.4, p=0.02) 
(Fig. 3). HET was associated with a signifcant increase in the thigh circumference (p=0.02) and a trend to 
improvement in thigh muscle thickness as measured by the average feather index (p=0.05) using a portable 
ultrasound device. In the UC cohort, there were no signifcant within group changes for these measures. As well,

there was no signifcant between group diferences for these outcomes. As for quality of life values, no signifcant 
within or between group diferences were identifed.
Adherence (sub-group analysis). Patients in the exercise group were almost equally divided into two 
groups based on their HET program adherence. Eleven (55%) patients fulflled criteria for adherence defned 
as completing ≥80% of the sessions (80% of sessions n = 1, 96% n = 1, and ≥100% n = 9; mean adherence 
100%±9% of sessions). Te remaining 9 (45%) patients were classifed as non-adherers (0% of sessions n =5; 
21% n=2, 38% n=1, and 66% n=1; mean adherence 16%±23% of sessions) (Table 3). Te only signifcant 
predictor of exercise adherence was male gender, where 9/11 (82%) adherers and 1/9 (11%) non-adherers were 
men. Younger age also trended to signifcance on univariate analysis (p=0.06) as a predictor of good adherence 
(Table 4). One patient in the HET group and two patients in the UC group were lost to follow-up and did not 
complete end of study testing.
Adverse events. HET was well tolerated by all 20 patients and no adverse events (e.g., musculoskeletal injuries, falls, variceal bleeding, worsening liver function) occurred during exercise testing or training (Table 2).
Discussion
Based upon the largest RCT conducted to date in a cirrhosis setting, we found that an 8-week unsupervised 
home exercise program (HET) did not signifcantly increase peak aerobic power (peak VO2) relative to the control group (UC) according to our primary between group analysis. However, increases in both aerobic endurance (6MWD) and thigh muscle thickness for the HET cohort were signifcantly greater than the UC. Moreover, 
sub-analysis within HET found that patients completing ≥80% of the sessions (mean adherence of 100%±9% of 
sessions) achieved both clinically and statistically signifcant improvements for peak VO2 and aerobic endurance 
(6MWD) compared to those with a low mean adherence of 16%±23% of sessions.
Patients with cirrhosis have severe and marked exercise intolerance. A recent systematic review of 1107 cirrhotic patients, undergoing screening for liver transplantation11, reported a mean peak VO2 of 17.4mL/kg/minute, a value typically indicative of a sedentary female aged 80–89 years22,23. Consistent with this fnding, the mean 
baseline peak VO2 of the exercise-trained participants included in the current trial was 17.3mL/kg/minute. Tis 
value corresponds to signifcant functional limitation as it is below the VO2 threshold level (e.g., 18mL/kg/minute) required for full and independent living22,23.
Te primary study endpoint, peak VO2 only trended to signifcance using the primary analysis of between 
group efects. Importantly though, clinical and statistically signifcant improvements were seen based upon 
within exercise group analyses and also when the results were analyzed in the subgroup of patients who were 
adherent to the exercise regimen. Why was the between group change in the peak VO2 with HET versus UC in the 
current trial lower than that achieved in our prior supervised exercise training trial16, despite a similar population 
and exercise protocol? Tis may be due to several factors. Specifcally, some UC subjects began regular exercise

(despite us asking them to continue with their regular activity). Moreover, patients in the HET group had a statistically lower baseline VO2 than those in the UC group. As demonstrated in Supplemental Fig. 1, a higher baseline 
VO2, was associated with a higher likelihood of improving with exercise therapy, possibly disadvantaging our 
HET group. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, as with pharmacological therapy, the beneft from exercise is 
strongly related to adherence to the prescribed regimen. Notably, adherence in the current study was signifcantly 
lower than in our earlier supervised site base exercise study16. Sub-analysis by exercise adherence in the current 
study, revealed that with adherence, the peak VO2 increased by 2.8mL/kg/min a value very close to the 3.5mL/kg/
min improvement in ftness that is associated with a survival advantage in patients referred for cardiac testing12. 
Similar to the dose response seen with pharmacological therapy, exercise has the potential to show signifcant 
benefts if patients can adhere to the prescribed regimen. In this study, adherence defned by completion of at 
least 80% of the sessions.
Te 6 minute walk test independently predicts mortality in patients with cirrhosis who are awaiting liver 
transplantation24. As compared to the original study by Carey et al., the mean 6MWD in our study participants 
was reasonably well preserved, at 498 m. Short-term exercise interventions have resulted in improvements in 
the 6-minute walk distance in other clinical populations, including those with heart failure25. In keeping with 
this, we noted a signifcant between group improvement in aerobic endurance (33.7 m), which increased even 
more when just the participants with “good” adherence were considered (46.4 m). Tese 6MWD improvements are in the range of the 20 to 50 meters associated with clinically meaningful improvements in functional 
performance status, including a patient’s ability to more easily carry out activities of daily living26,27.
Tis study was subject to several limitations, the frst being the small sample size. Our power calculations 
were done using an estimated value for improvement in the primary outcome based on the improvement seen in 
Zenith et al.
16. Studies using a larger sample size may demonstrate a more defnitive beneft. Secondly, because of 
the limitations set during our inclusion criteria, these results are generalizable only to a predominantly compensated population of cirrhosis patients. Seventy percent of patients included in the study had Child-Pugh class A 
disease. It was considered most appropriate to begin the evaluation of HET in a predominantly compensated population as there is limited data on exercise in general in cirrhosis and as HET has not previously been evaluated

in these patients. Future studies can extend this to patients with decompensated disease. Tirdly, beta-blocker 
therapy was not an exclusion criterion, and a small but comparable number of patients were on beta-blockade 
in each group. Data from the cardiac rehabilitation literature suggests that although beta-blockers may blunt the 
improvement in the peak VO2
28, training efects and prognostic information can still be achieved despite therapeutic doses. Beta-blocker use did not afect our primary outcome.

Adherence rates were lower than seen in our supervised trial16 and played a major role in the overall efcacy of the intervention. Te reduced adherence may in part have been related to the home-based exercise 
setting. Although home-based training has the advantage of fexibility and the lack of the need to travel in for 
sessions, it lacks the camaraderie and formal discipline of training in a group or in a hospital based setting. 
Tis may compromise the participant’s ability to exercise at a given intensity for long periods of time. Future 
studies may choose to address this challenge by altering the way home based training is performed, including 
the tailoring of the regimen by choice of diferent exercises based on patient preferences and patient identifed 
barriers to exercise29–31. Adherence toolkits32, choosing activities that are seen to have an immediate purpose 
(e.g., walking for transportation), that are associated with social engagement and that participants are confdent performing33 can also improve adherence. Although not well studied in cirrhosis, resistance training 
has been shown to be a potent stimulus for reversing muscle wasting and improving exercise capacity across 
a range of other populations34–36. In our experience, this exercise modality may be better tolerated and induce 
less fatigue than prolonged aerobic exercise in chronically ill and deconditioned populations37,38 and deserves 
further evaluation in cirrhosis. Additionally, given the “digital age”, the use of remote monitoring and check 
in systems as well as video conference training sessions may help to re-establish the camaraderie and make 
HET more into an enjoyable and accountable “group” activity which can be carried out in the comfort of 
the patient’s home. Data in other populations have associated e-health physical activity programs39–42 with 
improvements in clinical outcomes, quality of life and reduced health care utilization. Te only independent 
predictor of good adherence in our study was male gender, with younger age trending to signifcance. Across 
populations, there is discordant data about how age and gender infuence adherence in the literature43–46. 
Notably, there has been no systematic evaluation of the specifc predictors of adherence in cirrhosis. Future 
studies should consider more detailed evaluation of this as well as targeted reduction of sex-specifc barriers 
in order to optimize adherence31.
Despite the noted study limitations, this is the largest RCT of exercise therapy in cirrhosis and adds to accumulating data in the area14,16 regarding the safety of exercise training as well as the importance of adherence to 
the regimen.
In conclusion, these fndings indicate that 8 weeks of HET is an efective therapy to improve peak aerobic 
power, submaximal aerobic endurance and thigh muscle mass in clinically stable Child-Pugh class A and B cirrhosis. Maximal benefts are seen in patients with adherence to the prescribed regimen. Future studies are needed 
to confrm our fndings of efcacy and importantly of safety in early cirrhosis, to extend these evaluations to 
patients with more advanced disease and to determine if measures targeted to simulating the “group training” 
appeal of supervised training can increase adherence in those patients undergoing HET. Recognizing the challenges that many patients have with traveling to site-specifc exercise facilities, the important prognostic implications of physical deconditioning and the limited alternative options available for treatment, with behavioural 
change modifcations to improve adherence, we see HET as moving one step closer to expanding exercise as a 
routine part of the therapeutic armamentarium in cirrhosis.

methods were performed in accordance with relevant ethics guidelines and regulations. All co-authors had access 
to the study data and reviewed and approved the fnal manuscript.
Patient Selection. Inclusion criteria were: (1) cirrhosis diagnosed by compatible radiological appearance or 
biopsy, (2) Child-Pugh class A (CP-A) or B (CP-B), (3) age ≥18 and ≤70 years, and (4) guideline-based primary 
prophylaxis in place for high risk gastroesophageal varices (either non-selective beta-blockade or endoscopic 
band ligation to the point of variceal eradication)47. Subjects were excluded if they had: (1) signifcant cardiac 
disease (ejection fraction <60% or history of coronary artery disease, positive exercise stress test (≥1 mm ST 
segment depression)), (2) chronic renal failure on dialysis, (3) hemoglobin <110 g/L, (4) human immunodefciency virus infection, (5) hepatocellular carcinoma, (6) active non-hepatocellular carcinoma related malignancy, (7) myopathy, (8) any physical impairment or orthopedic abnormality preventing ET, or (9) post-liver 
transplantation.
Randomization to either the HET or UC groups was performed using a computer randomization plan 
(http://www.randomization.com/). Treatment assessments were concealed by sealed envelope. Patients and 
investigators were informed of the study group assignment afer completion of the baseline assessment. Te 
primary outcome was change in peak VO2 from baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in quadriceps muscle thickness as measured by ultrasound, thigh circumference, 6MWD, quality of life, and safety as 
determined by the occurrence of variceal hemorrhage or deteriorations in liver biochemistry, Child-Pugh, and 
MELD scores.
Prior to and just afer the intervention, the following assessments were performed.
a) Cardiopulmonary (VO2 peak) exercise testing was performed on an electrically braked cycle ergometer48. 
A physician and an exercise specialist supervised this test. Te initial power output was set at 15 Watts 
(W) and increased by 15W every 2minutes until the aerobic threshold was achieved, then the intensity 
increased by 15W every minute until volitional exhaustion. Continuous expired gas analysis was performed with a metabolic measurement system (Innocor, Innovision, Denmark). Blood pressure and heart 
rate were monitored and the highest oxygen consumed over a one-minute period was used as the peak VO2
score48.
b) Muscle Mass and thigh circumference- A portable ultrasound machine (Mindray©, Shenzhen, China) was 
used to measure the depth of the right quadriceps muscle (the rectus femoris and vastus intermedius) as 
we have previously described16,49. Two readings were obtained at each point: a compression reading taken 
by pressing the probe downwards until no further compression of the muscles was possible and a featherweight reading where the probe was held without pressure on the thigh. Measurements at both points were 
averaged and corrected for stature (height2
) to yield average compression and featherweight indices. Tigh 
circumference was evaluated at the one-third point using a fexible tape measure.
c) 6-minute walk distance- A standardized 6MWD was performed in accordance with American Toracic 
Society Guidelines27.
d) Quality of life measures - Te Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)50 and EQ-Visual Analogue Scale 
(EQ-VAS)51 were used to assess quality of life and self-perceived health status. Te CLDQ is a 29-item 
self-administered Health Related Quality of Life instrument50. It includes items in the domains of fatigue, 
activity, emotional function, abdominal symptoms, systemic symptoms, and worry, rated on a 7-point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate a better health related quality of life52. Te EQ-VAS is a component of the 
EQ-5D, a standardized measure of health status that quantitatively records a patient’s self-rated health state 
on a 100-point visual analogue scale51. Patients were asked to rate their own health state along the scale 
with end-points labeled “best imaginable health state” and “worst imaginable health state”. Higher scores 
indicate a better health status.
e) Lab tests and liver disease severity - Serum albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, ALT, AST, electrolytes, CBC, and 
INR were performed. Child-Pugh and MELD were calculated.
Interventions. Afer baseline testing, patients were randomized to either HET or UC for 8 weeks.
Te HET group was visited at home by an exercise specialist to deliver and set up a cycle ergometer (Schwinn), 
and provide instruction about the exercise-training program. Te exercise intensity was prescribed at a heart 
rate of 60 to 80% of heart rate reserve, or at 14 to 15 on the 6–20 Borg scale. Exercise training was performed 3 
days/week for 30 minutes each session and based on patient tolerance was gradually increased to 60 minutes of 
exercise per session. Each workout was to be preceded by a 5-minute warm up and concluded with a 5-minute 
cool down at a lower intensity. Participants were contacted by phone weekly and based on patient availability and 
interest, attempts were made to visit them biweekly for exercise session observation. Patients in the UC group 
were not given formal exercise prescription guidelines and were asked to continue their regular activity for the 
study duration. All patients were asked to complete an activity diary daily to assess adherence. Tis diary was 
reviewed by the exercise specialist on the weekly phone visits and at the end of the study. Exercise adherence was 
defned by participation in ≥80% of prescribed exercise sessions53. In addition to assessing adherence, during the 
weekly phone calls made by the exercise specialist, patients were also asked about adverse events (musculoskeletal 
injuries, falls, worsening liver function, hospitalization).
At the baseline assessment, a registered dietician (VM) provided nutritional counseling to all patients. 
Optimal protein and calorie targets were based on the European Society of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition 
guidelines54 and the Nutrition Support Manual (Adult) and Daily Nutrient Recommendations for Liver Disease
provided by Alberta Health Services. For protein intake, 1.2–1.5 g/kg protein was recommended in all patients 

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
SCIENTIFIC REPorTs | (2018) 8:99 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-18320-y 8
daily. With BMI >30, protein was dosed based on an ideal body weight (BMI 24.9). Daily target calorie intake was 
BMI specifc ranging from 35–40 kcal/kg for a BMI of 20–30, 25–35 kcal/kg for a BMI of 30–40 and 20–25 kcal/
kg for a BMI of >4055. On exercise days, patients were asked to consume an additional 250–300 kcal to replete 
the calories burned with exertion and account for their impaired capacity to mobilize glucose during exercise8
.
Te datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding 
author on reasonable request.
Statistical Analysis. Te sample size calculation was based on peak VO2. Based on our prior supervised 
exercise intervention trial16, we expected the improvement in peak VO2 to be 5.3 ml/kg/min greater afer HET 
compared to UC. With a between group standard deviation of 5 ml/kg/min16, alpha level p<0.05 and power of 
80%, a total of 28 subjects were needed. Given the potential for a combination of dropouts and for decreased 
efcacy in HET versus a supervised exercise environment, we conservatively increased the target recruitment by 
40% to a total of 40 subjects (n=20 exercise, and n=20 controls).
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Variables were 
described using means and standard deviations, or proportions. To take advantage of the RCT design, the primary statistical analysis was the determination of between-group diferences using the analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA). ANCOVA was chosen as it accounts for the individual changes within patients, changes between 
groups relative to baseline values, and is robust to violations of normality assumptions56. We also assessed 
within-group diferences (e.g., before and afer within each of the UC and HET groups) using paired t-tests. 
Statistical signifcance was established at a 2-tailed p-value of <0.05. Finally, we also evaluated the impact of 
exercise adherence compared to controls using ANCOVA methodology.
