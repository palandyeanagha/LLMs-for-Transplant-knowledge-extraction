Abstract
There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery.
Four gastric bypass operations, performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were
complicated with COVID-19. The mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ± 3 kg/m2
. Patients developed
their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 days
before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients
who required admission in intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive agents
were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can complicate the postoperative course of patients after
bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after
surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of
bariatric surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by non-infected patients in the perioperative
period.

Introduction
The rising pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a worldwide crisis for global
health and economy. Although the infection has been reported
all around the world in the first few months of the year 2020,
the clinical presentation and outcomes of surgical patients
during the COVID-19 outbreak have not been clearly characterized [1]. In response to this progressive global health crisis,
following the advice by the governmental and professional
authorities [2, 3], bariatric surgical practice, which is an elective surgical procedure, has been temporarily stopped in many
places around the world.
Based on the current knowledge, the median incubation
period of COVID-19 is 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to
7). The time from onset to dyspnea is 5 days, 7 days to
hospital admission, and 10 days to intensive care unit
(ICU) admission. Fever, cough, and fatigue are the most
common clinical manifestations. Other symptoms include
shortness of breath, myalgia, sore throat, and headache.
About 10% of patients initially present with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea) 1 to 2 days
prior to development of fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Abnormal findings in chest X-ray and CT scan can be
seen in 60% and > 90% of patients, respectively. The most
common patterns on chest CT are ground-glass opacity

and local or bilateral patchy shadowing [4–7]. Diagnosis
can be confirmed by sequencing or reverse transcriptase–
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19
nucleic acid of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens.
Notably, in a report from China on over 1000 patients to
assess the diagnostic accuracy of different tests, chest CT
scan had sensitivity of 98% compared with RT-PCR sensitivity of only 71% [8]. Major complications include
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia,
septic shock, and multiple organ failure. Overall, most
cases are classified as mild (81%; i.e., nonpneumonia
and mild pneumonia). However, 14% are severe and 5%
are critical [4–7].
There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed COVID-19 after bariatric surgery. The aim of this
report is to describe the clinical presentation and outcomes
of bariatric surgical patients during the initial phase of
COVID-19 outbreak.
Methods
Following submission of a request on a closed social media
group of Iranian bariatric surgeons who are the International
Federation for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic
Disorders (IFSO) members, 4 patients were identified who
developed postoperative COVID-19 after bariatric surgery
during the initial phase of outbreak in Iran.
Sixty-two surgeons in Iran are member of the IFSO with
annual bariatric surgical volume of near 10,000 cases. The
first case of COVID-19 in Iran, the epicenter of infection in
the Middle East, was officially announced on February 19,

2020. As of the end of April 3, 2020, there were over 53,000
laboratory-confirmed cases and near 3300 deaths in Iran.
Results
Four gastric bypass operations (Roux-en-Y n = 3, single anastomosis n = 1), performed in a 2-week period between Feb 24
and March 4, 2020 in Tehran, Iran, were complicated with
COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical characteristics of patients
and their outcomes have been summarized in Table 1. The
mean age and body mass index were 46 ± 12 years and 49 ±
3 kg/m2
, respectively.
Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea,
and fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14 days after surgery. One patient had
unnoticed anosmia 2 days before surgery. Three patients were
readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were treated with
hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in
intensive care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral medication (Kaletra [combination of lopinavir and
ritonavir]: protease inhibitor), immunosuppressive agent (tocilizumab: monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor), and hemoperfusion (for nonspecific removal of the circulating cytokines during cytokine storm) were also administered.
Patients did not require endotracheal intubation and mechanical
ventilation in the ICU. All patients survived.
Discussion
Beginning of March 2020, given the huge burden of COVID-19
outbreak on the health care systems, critical shortage of personal
protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, and risk of hospital
transmission of infection, nonessential elective surgical procedures, including bariatric surgical procedures, have been postponed in many places around the world.
Although bariatric surgical procedures are generally safe operations and patients are usually discharged the next day after
surgery [9, 10], given the extent of current epidemic and limited
availability of resources, temporary postponing of bariatric surgical procedures would be the right decision in many places.
Sometimes the rare complications of bariatric surgery, such as
bleeding, leakage, or pulmonary embolism, are difficult to manage and extremely resource demanding. Furthermore, bariatric
surgical practice usually requires frequent perioperative visits by
the multidisciplinary team which would not be safe in the current
situation when social distancing is widely advised.
These cases raise the possibility that performing elective operative interventions on patients with undetected
hidden or mild form of COVID-19 may lead to hospital
transmission of COVID-19 [1, 6]. Case 4 had an undetected form of disease at the time of surgery. He lost the
sense of smell 2 days before surgery, which would be the
early sign of COVID-19 infection according to some anecdotal reports [11]. Case 1 and case 3 that had a short
interval between the surgery and COVID-19 symptoms
probably had hidden form of disease at the time of bariatric surgery. This could potentially be associated with
spreading the infection to healthcare providers and contamination of operative room and equipment. Other possibility would be that cases 1, 2, and 3 were healthy and
might acquire the infection during their hospital stay.
Bariatric surgical patients are at risk for development of different postoperative pulmonary complications. Obstructive sleep
apnea, obesity hypoventilation, asthma, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease are not uncommon in patients with severe
obesity which can predispose them to postoperative pulmonary
adverse events. Patients who develop shortness of breath or fever
in the early postoperative period of bariatric surgery would require several diagnostic tests to rule out typical surgical complications such as gastrointestinal leak or pulmonary embolism.
Hypoventilation, infectious pneumonia (including COVID-19
pneumonia), and pulmonary edema are other possible diagnoses.

Overall, chest CT scan has a good accuracy for diagnosing different complications in the postoperative setting including the
COVID-19 pneumonia [8].
Patients with severe obesity usually have multiple comorbid conditions which would make them vulnerable to severe
form of COVID-19. Severe obesity, hypertension, diabetes,
and cardiopulmonary diseases have been found as risk factors
for poor prognosis after COVID-19 [5–7]. In the current series
of 4 bariatric patients, two patients required ICU admission.
Another small series of COVID-19 patients reported high
morbidity and mortality in surgical patients [1]. Since there
is currently not any approved medication for COVID-19, all
patients received therapies with possible benefits based on the
anecdotal evidence [12]. Those included hydroxychloroquine
(in all 4 patients), antiretroviral drug, immunosuppressive
medication, and hemoperfusion [13].
Although, this is the first published case series of COVID19 in bariatric surgical patients, this report has several limitations including retrospective design, small sample size, and
lack of comparative data on number and characteristics of
bariatric surgical patients during the study time period who
did not develop COVID-19.
In conclusion, COVID-19, presenting with postoperative
fever, cough, and dyspnea, can complicate the postoperative
course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct diagnosis and
management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing of infection after surgery in our series would raise
the possibility of hospital transmission of COVID-19: from
asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric surgery to the
healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection
by non-infected patients in the perioperative period.
