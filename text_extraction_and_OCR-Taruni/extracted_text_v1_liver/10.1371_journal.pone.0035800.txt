Abstract
Valosin containing protein (VCP)/p97 plays various important roles in cells. Moreover, elevated expression of VCP in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is correlated with increased incidence of recurrence. But the role of VCP in HCC progression
in vitro and in vivo is unclear. And there are few reports about the regulation mechanism on the expression of VCP in HCC. In
this study, it was identified that the level of VCP was frequently increased in human HCC tissues. In addition, downregulation of VCP with siRNAs could dramatically suppress the genesis and progression of tumor in vivo. It was found that
miR-129-5p directly inhibited the expression of VCP in several HCC cell lines. Meanwhile, the level of VCP in HCC tissues was
negatively associated with the level of miR-129-5p. Our further investigation showed that the enhanced expression of miR129-5p also suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, it was revealed that miR-129-5p could inhibit the degradation of
IkBa and increase the apoptosis and reduce the migration of HCC cells by suppressing the expression of VCP. Our results
revealed that the expression of VCP was directly regulated by miR-129-5p and this regulation played an important role in
the progression of HCC.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the common cancers
worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia and Africa [1]. Surgical
resection is the main modality of treatment for HCC, but the
recurrence rate of HCC after surgery is about 70%. The results of
immunohistochemistry show that elevated expression of Valosincontaining protein (VCP), also named p97, is correlated with
increased incidence of HCC recurrence [2]. But there is no direct
evidence that VCP is involved in the progression of HCC.
VCP belongs to the AAA family (ATPase with multiple cellular
activities) [3]. It is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic
cells and can interact with more than 30 different cellular proteins
with various functions, including morphology alteration of nuclear
and Golgi membranes, transcriptional regulation, membrane
fusion, programmed cell death, ubiqutin/protesome-dependent
protein degradation, ER-associated degradation [3–7]. In addition, VCP has been shown to associate physically with ubiquitinated IkBa and to target IkBa to the proteasome for degradation
[7,8]. It was reported that pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor
1(PBX1) regulates expression of VCP [9]. But so far there is no
report about the post-transcriptional regulation of the VCP
expression.
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs in
animals and plants. They can bind to the 39 untranslated regions
(UTRs) of target mRNAs and regulate genes expression at
posttranscriptional and translational levels [10]. Deregulation of
miRNAs is involved in many kinds of human diseases, including
cancer [11]. It has been shown that 50% of miRNAs are located
within the chromosomal regions known to be frequently amplified
or deleted in human cancer cells [12]. Until now, several miRNAs
are reported to be associated with HCC, such as miR-21, miR221, miR-223, miR-224, miR-122, miR-199a/b-3p, miR-101,
miR-26 and miR-29 [12–20].
Here, we firstly identified miR-129-5p could directly regulate
the expression of VCP and inhibit the degradation of IkBa.
Suppression of the expression of VCP or increasing the level of
miR-129-5p could induce cell apoptosis and migration in vitro and
inhibit the tumor genesis of HCC in vivo.

ethics committee of People’s Armed Police Corps General
Hospital approved the study, and all patients gave written
informed consent. All specimens were clinically characterized
(Tables S1 and S2).
Cell Lines
The HepG2 [17] and SK-HEP1 [21] cell lines were purchased
from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). MHCC-LM3 cell line
[22] was provided by the Liver Cancer Institute of Fudan
University (Shanghai, China). They were all maintained in
Dulbecco’s Modifed Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured at
37uC in 5% CO2.
RNA extraction and cDNA production
Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using Trizol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. microRNAs
were extracted from paraffin-embedded sections by using the
RecoverAllTM Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems). For cDNA synthesis,1 mg of RNA was mixed with 500 ng of
olig (dT) (Promega) or microRNA specific primers (invitrogen).
The RNA-primer mixture was incubated at 70uC for 10 min,
followed by a snap freeze in ice bath for 2 min. Then samples were
incubated at 42uC for 45 min with 5 ml of 56first-strand buffer,
2 ml of 5 mM dNTP, 20 U of RNasin (Takara), 1 ml of M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Promega) and distilled water to a total
volume of 25 ml. The reverse transcriptase was inactivated at 70uC
for 10 min and then chilled on ice.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
The qPCR reaction mixture contained 12.5 ml of 26SYBR
green PCR mix (GenePharma), 0.3 mM of gene-specific forward
and reverse primers, and 1 ml of template, made up to a final
volume of 25 ml with distilled water. The primers are shown in
Table S3. Cycling parameters were set as follows: initial activation
step at 95uC for 10 min, denaturation at 95uC for 30 s, annealing
at 58uC for 30 s, and extension at 72uC for 20 s. Melting curve
analysis was performed at from 58uC to 95uC with stepwise
fluorescence acquisition at every 1uC s21
. Melting curves observed
for each gene were confirmed to correspond to the correct
amplicon size by agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products.
The levels of gene expression were calculated by relative
quantification using GAPDH or U6 snRNA as the endogenous
reference genes. All samples were amplified in triplicate and the
data analysis was carried out using the MxPro qPCR system
software (Stratagene).
Vector construction and luciferase reporter assay
To generate a luciferase reporter construct, 39UTR and mutant
39UTR of VCP were inserted downstream of firefly luciferase in
pGL3. Cells were cotransfected with miRNAs and 39UTR or
mutant 39UTR luciferase reporters, using pRL-TK as control
vector. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Assay kit (Promega) with a beta-counter luminometer. Relative
luciferase activity was calculated as ratio of the raw firefly
luciferase activity and the renilla luciferase activity.
RNA oligoribonucleotides and cell transfections
Transfection of RNA oligoribonucleotide(s) was done using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The transfection efficiency was examined by a FAMconjugated siRNA (Genepharma). Sixty nM of RNA duplex or
eighty nM of miRNA inhibitor were used for the transfection,
unless otherwise indicated. In the rescue experiment, 24 h after
RNA transfection, cells were transfected with 300 ng plasmids in a
24-well plate.
Cell migration assay
HepG2 and SK-HEP1 cells were transfected and cultured for
24 h in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. And then 16105 cells were
harvested and added to upper chamber (8 mm pore size
polycarbonate membrane, Corning) of 24-well plate in serum free
medium (300 ml). After incubated for 24 h at 37uC in 5% CO2,
invasive cells on lower surface of the membrane were stained with
0.1% violet staining solution for 30 min, and counted by
photographing the membrane through the microscope (640
magnifications).
Tumor-bearing in nude mice
All experimental procedures involving animals were performed
in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals National Institutes of Health and according to the
institutional ethical guidelines for animal experiments. si-VCP,
miR-129-5p- and NC-transfected HepG2 cells (16106
) were
suspended in 100 ml PBS and then injected subcutaneously into
either side of the posterior flank of the male BALB/c athymic nude
mouse at 5–6 weeks of age. 15 nude mice were included in each
group and tumor growth was examined every four days. Tumor
volume (V) was monitored by measuring the length (L) and width
(W) of the tumor with calipers and was calculated with the formula
V = (L6W2
)60.5.
Statistical analysis

Results
Down-regulation of VCP suppressed the progression of
HCC in vivo
Although it has been reported that VCP expression level is
diverse in the different tumor samples and has prognostic
significance for disease-free and overall survival of patients with
HCC [2], the role of VCP in HCC is unclear. So we wondered
whether VCP could influence the progression of HCC or just be
a potential prognostic marker. Firstly, qRT-PCR experiment was
performed to analyze the level of VCP in 11 paired of HCC
frozen tissues and its adjacent normal frozen tissues. It was
showed that the level of VCP was significantly increased in 9
HCC tissues (Ratio.2, P,0.05) compared with the corresponding normal liver tissues (Figure 1A). In the further investigation,
the expression of VCP was knocked down in HepG2 cells with
specific siRNA (si-VCP), and then the cells were injected
subcutaneously into the posterior flank of the male BALB/c
athymic nude mouse. Compared with NC transfectants, cells
transfected with si-VCP revealed a delayed tumor formation
time (11/15 versus 0/15 on day 10) and a significant reduction
in the tumor size (Figure 1B, 1C). In addition, the immunohistochemical analysis showed that the level of VCP in the tumor

from si-VCP group was lower than that from NC group
(Figure 1D). At the same time, we tested the level of Bcl-2 in
the different groups. Bcl-2 was an anti-apoptotic protein, which
was an important regulator of programmed cell death and
apoptosis [23,24]. It was found that the expression of Bcl-2 was
decreased in the si-VCP group (Figure 1D). These results
suggested that down-regulation of VCP expression could
obviously suppress tumor growth in vivo.
miR-129-5p could directly regulate the expression of VCP
The level of VCP is altered in HCC tissue samples2 and
important for tumor growth. So we tried to investigate the
molecule which could regulate the expression of VCP in HCC.
MiRNAs have been reported to regulate the expression of various
proteins and involved in many kinds of cancer. So we investigated
if there were some miRNAs which could regulate the expression of
VCP in HCC. We firstly predicted the candidates by using the
Targetscan database (www.targetscan.org). Five potential candiFigure 1. VCP positively regulated the progress of HCC. A: Analysis of the level of VCP in HCC tissues by qRT-PCR. The result showed that the

miR-129-5p Inhibiting VCP/p97 in HCC

date miRNAs (miR-103; miR-107; miR-129-5p; miR-136; miR339-5p) were predicted to have target sites in 39UTR of VCP
mRNA. To test which miRNA can regulate the expression of
VCP, a reporter vector (pGL3-VCP-39UTR) was created by
insertion of the 39UTR of VCP mRNA to the downstream of the
luciferase gene. The reporter vector was transfected into HepG2
cells together with miRNAs or negative control RNA duplex (NC).
48 hours after transfection, the luciferase activities were tested. It
was found that only miR-129-5p can down-regulate the luciferase
activities of the reporter (Figure 2A). miR-129-5p is produced by
the precursor of miR-129-1 and miR-129-2 and both of them
negatively regulate SOX4 [25]. There were two predicted miR129-5p target sites in the 39UTR of VCP mRNA, 162–168 and
505–511. To confirm the binding between miR-129-5p and
39UTR of VCP, three mutants of 39UTR of VCP mRNA were
constructed by deleting the two targets sites individually or both to
generate three reporter vectors(pGL3-VCP-39UTRm1/m2/
m3)(Figure 2B). The three mutant reporters were transfected into
two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and MHCC-LM3) together with miR129-5p. The luciferase expression was no longer regulated by miR129-5p after the 162–168 and/or 505–511 of 39UTR were deleted
(Figure 2C, 2D). This suggested that both target sites in the
39UTR of VCP mRNA were essential for the regulation of miR129-5p.
To further verify the regulatory role of miR-129-5p on VCP
expression, the inhibitor of miR-129-5p was transfected into the
liver cancer cell line SK-HEP1 together with pGL3-VCP-39UTR.
The level of miR-129-5p was higher in SK-HEP1 than that in
HepG2 and MHCC-LM3 (data not shown). It was found that the
luciferase activities in SK-HEP1 cells were increased after the cells
were transfected with miR-129-5p inhibitor (Figure 2E). In
addition, no significant difference in the luciferase activities of
pGL3-VCP-39UTRm1/m2/m3 was observed after the cells were
transfected with the inhibitor of miR-129-5p (Figure 2C,2D,2E).
These results suggested that miR-129-5p directly interacts with the
39UTR of VCP mRNA.
In the further investigation, we analyzed the level of miR-129-
5p in 11 paired HCC and the corresponding normal liver tissues
by qRT-PCR. The significant decreased level of miR-129-5p was
observed in HCC tissues (Figure 2F).
To verify the correlation between VCP and miR-129-5p, the
level of VCP in the paraffin-embedded tissue samples of HCC was
detected by immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against
VCP. Then these samples were divided into two groups (level
1(n = 17) and level 2 (n = 22)) according the level of VCP as the
classification standard described previously [2] (Table S2) in which
the expression of VCP in level 1 was lower than that in level 2. At
the same time, the expression level of miR-129-5p in two VCP
level groups was measured by qRT-PCR. It was found that the
level of miR-219-5p was higher in level 1 than that in level 2,
which indicated the miR-129-5p level was negatively related to the
expression of VCP (Figure 2G). It was found that miR-129-5p
could also suppress the progression of HCC in vivo. Cells
transfected with miR-129-5p revealed a delayed tumor formation
time (11/15 versus 2/15 on day 10) and a significant reduction in
the tumor size, which was consist with the result of si-VCP group,
suggesting a potential tumor suppressive effect of miR-129-5p
(Figure 1B, 1C).
miR-129-5p suppressed the expression of VCP protein
and regulated NF-kB pathway
To verify whether VCP protein expression was indeed regulated
by miR-129-5p, miR-129-5p, si-VCP or NC were transfected into
HepG2 and SK-HEP1 cells. The western blot showed that the
expression of VCP protein was significant reduced after the cell
was treated with miR-129-5p or si-VCP compared with NC
(Figure 3A). The reduction was also observed in the mRNA level
of VCP in the cells transfected with si-VCP or miR-129-5p
(Figure 3B). In the further investigation, it was found that the
expression of VCP protein was enhanced compared to NC group
after the miR-129-5p inhibitor was transfected to cells (Figure 3C).
It has been reported that VCP protein is involved in the
degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Figure 4A showed that
the ubiquitinated proteins were accumulated after the cells were
treated with miR-129-5p or si-VCP. In addition, VCP could
interact with the ubiquitinated IkBa, the inactivation of the
prototype NF-kB inhibitor, and play an important role in the
proteasome-mediated degradation of IkBa [7]. In our experiment,
we found the level of IkBa in the HepG2 and SK-HEP1 cells after
transfection with miR129-5p or si-VCP was increased (Figure 3A).
These results indicated miR-129-5p might modulate the NF-kB
signal pathway through the regulation of VCP.
In the further investigation, we checked if miR-129-5p or siVCP could regulate the NF-kB signal pathway. To assess whether
the activities of NF-kB was affected by VCP or miR-129-5p, we
transiently transfected a reporter plasmid with a luciferase gene
linked to the binding region of NF-kB (pNFkB-luc) in HepG2
cells. Cells were harvested at 72 h after transfection. As shown in
Figure 3D, the luciferase activities of pNFkB-luc were strongly
repressed following miR-129-5p or si-VCP transfection. When
cells had been treated with the NF-kB inhibitor (BAY 11-7082),
miR-129-5p or si-VCP could not influence the activities of NF-kB.
These results suggested that miR-129-5p and VCP was involved in
the NF-kB signal pathway through degradation of IkBa.
miR-129-5p induced the apoptosis and reduced the
migration of HCC cells dependent on the downregulation of VCP expression
Resistance towards apoptosis is a key factor for the survival of a
malignant cell and cancer cell migration to distant organs is the
major cause of death in almost all forms of cancer [26,27].
Moreover, the NF-kB signal pathway is involved in tumor growth
and metastasis. So we checked if miR-129-5p or VCP could
influence the cell growth, apoptosis and migration of HCC cells.
HepG2 and SK-HEP1 cells were transfected with miR-129-5p or
si-VCP. Then the cell growth was evaluated using CCK8 assay
and the apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. It was found
that silencing of VCP gene with si-VCP suppressed cell growth
(Figure 4A) and increased the apoptosis of both HepG2 and SKHEP1 cells, which was consistent with the consequence of
restoration of miR-129-5p expression (Figure 4B, 4C). In addition,
we detected the expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP which were the NFkB-regulated target genes and involved in the different pathway of
cell apoptosis. It was found that the level of Bcl-2 and XIAP was
decreased in HepG2 or SK-HEP1 cells transfected with miR-129-
5p or si-VCP (Figure 4D). We also measured the migration of the
HepG2 or SK-HEP1 cells by transwell chemotaxis assay. It was
found that the number of cells migrating across the membranes
was decreased dramatically after the cells were treated with miR129-5p or si-VCP. The migration level of miR-129-5p group was
reduced to 23.54% of negative control level. Similarly, the level of
si-VCP group was reduced to 15.56% (Figure 4E).
To further confirm the effect of miR-129-5p was dependent on
the regulation of VCP expression, the VCP was expressed in HCC
cells transfected with miR-129-5p. And then the cell growth,
apoptosis and migration of cells were analyzed respectively. The
results showed that after the VCP level was recovered, the cell
growth and migration were increased and the apoptosis rate was

Figure 2. miR-129-5p could directly regulate the expression of VCP. A: miR-129-5p could significantly suppress the luciferase activities of
pGL3-VCP-39UTR in HepG2 cells. Five predicted miRNAs (miR-103, miR-107, miR-129-5p, miR-136, miR-339-5p) were transfected in HepG2 cells,

groups (level 1,n = 17;level 2,n = 22) was measured by qRT-PCR and compared. U6 snRNA was used as internal control gene. Dot plots showed an

reduced (Figure 4A, 4B, 4C, 4E). It suggested that phenotypic
alternation of cells induced by miR-129-5p was achieved by direct
influencing the expression of VCP.
Discussion
Yamamoto S et al identified that HCC patients with VCP-level
2 showed higher rate of portal vein invasion in the tumor and
poorer disease-free and overall survival compared with level 1
patients [2]. It has been also reported that the level of VCP is
associated with the prognosis of other kinds of carcinoma,
including prostate cancer, esophageal carcinoma, gingival squamous cell carcinoma and colorectal carcinomas [28–32]. All these
findings indicate that VCP can be used as a potential marker of
tumor. Until now, there are no definitive reports to clarify if VCP
is involved in the progression of tumor. Here, we demonstrated the
elevated level of VCP in HCC tissues. Inhibition of VCP could
suppress HCC tumor progression in nude mice. The size of
tumors from si-VCP group was significantly lower than that from
NC group.
Up to now, the regulatory mechanism of VCP expression is
rarely known. In this study, we identified that miR-129-5p could
down-regulate the expression of VCP by interaction with two sites
located at its 39UTR. Further investigation revealed that miR-129-
5p could inhibit the degradation of IkBa. IkBa is the inhibitor of
NF-kB, so the affection on the cell growth, apoptosis and
migration induced by VCP and miR-129-5p might be via NFkB pathway. Given the broad association between VCP and
various cell activities, further study on whether miR-129-5p is
involved in these processes will conducted in the future.
The microarray results in the previous reports had presented
that the level of miR-129 was deregulated in human HCC tissues
compared with the normal controls [16]. In our study, it was found
that miR-129-5p was frequently decreased in HCC, which was in
accordance with the previous reports [17]. In the HCC tissues, it
was found that the expression of miR-129-5p was negatively
inverse relationship between U6 snRNA and miR-129-5p expression in HCC. Significant differences were determined using Student’s t tests. **:

correlated with the level of VCP. The in vivo study showed that
enhancing the level of miR-129-5p could suppress the growth of
tumor, which was similar to si-VCP group. All of these results
revealed miR-129-5p may be associated with the progression of
HCC by inhibiting the expression of VCP.
As described previously, miR-129-5p origins from miR-129-1
and miR-129-2. Huang Y et al identified that the miR-129-2 CpG
island was frequently hypermethylated in endometrial tumors
and the level of miR-129-5p decreases [33]. Wu et al reported
that miR-129-5p could regulate the expression of Cdk6 and
induce G1 phase arrest in mouse lung epithelial cell line (E10
Cells) [34]. But this phenomenon was observed in our
experiment (data not shown). This may be due to the different
cell lines used. It will be investigated whether miR-129-2 is
hypermethylated in HCC and Cdk6 is regulated by miR-129-5p
in HCC cell lines in the future.
In conclusion, our results identified that miR-129-5p can
directly inhibit the expression of VCP. This regulation plays an
important role in cell apoptosis in vitro and the development of
HCC in vivo. As the level of VCP and miR-129-5p in HCC
samples is significantly different from that in adjacent normal
tissues, the two molecules may be an indicator for prediction of the
genesis of HCC. Our study may lead to the development of new
therapeutic regimens in treating advanced HCC.

Figure 4. miR-129-5p could regulate the cell growth, apopotosis and migration of HCC cells dependent on the regulation of VCP
expression. A: HepG2 or SK-HEP1 cells were transfected and in the indicated time periods posttransfection, cell growth rate was evaluated using
CCK8 assay. The result showed miR-129-5p and si-VCP could repress cell growth. The cell growth rate was restored after VCP expression vector were
transfected into HepG2 or SK-HEP1 cells. Shown data are representative from three independent experiments. **:P,0.01. B: HepG2 cells were
transfected and the apoptosis of cell was detected with FACS. Left panel showed miR-129-5p and si-VCP could increase the apoptosis of HepG2 cells
at 48 h and 72 h after the transfection. Right panel showed the apoptosis of cell after miR-129-5p with/without VCP expression vector were
transfected into HepG2 cells for 72 h. The experiment was repeated three times independently. NC: negative control RNA duplex; miR-129-5p: miR129-5p mimic; miR-129-5p/pcDNA3.1: cells were co-transfected with miR-129-5p mimic and blank pcDNA3.1; miR-129-5p/VCP: cells were cotransfected with miR-129-5p mimic and VCP expression vector. The experiments were repeated three times independently.*:P,0.05. **:P,0.01. C: SKHEP1 cells were transfected and the apoptosis of cells was detected with FACS. miR-129-5p and si-VCP could increase the apoptosis of SK-HEP1 cells
at 72 h after the transfection. After the level of VCP was enhanced by transfecting VCP expression vector, the apoptosis rate of cells were returned.
D:Detection the level of Bcl-2 and XIAP by RT-PCR and western blot. GAPDH served as the internal control. E:Transwell assay was performed to assess
cell migration. Upper panel represented the photographs of treated and untreated cells at 24 h (640 magnification). Lower panel showed the
number of cells invaded at 24 h. Shown data are representative from four replicates per group. *P,0.05.
