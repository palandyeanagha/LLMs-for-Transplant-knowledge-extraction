Abstract
Purpose To investigate the levels for some specified
microRNAs in human’s peripheral blood so as to determine
whether they can serve as biomarkers for metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer.
Methods Use a quantitative stem-loop RT-PCR method to
examine the serum levels for certain microRNAs including
has-miR-125a-5p, has-miR-126, has-miR-183, has-miR-200,
has-miR-221, and has-miR-222 from the patients with Stage
IV, Stage I/II non-small-cell lung cancer and the controls.
Results There was statistical difference in the serum levels
for hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-222 between
the controls and the Stage IV patients, but not for has-miR125a-5p, has-miR-200 and has-miR-221. It also showed
statistical difference for hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-183
between the Stage I/II patients and Stage IV patients, but not
between the controls and Stage I/II patients.

potential serum biomarkers for metastatic non-small-cell
lung cancer.

Introduction
Lung cancer, predominantly non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), is the most common cause of cancer deaths
worldwide (Jemal et al. 2006). NSCLC includes two predominant subtypes, adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma, which comprise 40 and 25%, respectively (Dutt
et al. 2011). Unfortunately, local and/or distant metastases
have developed in up to 75% of the lung cancer patients
when clinically diagnosed (Coello et al. 2004). So it
becomes important to find a reliable and feasible way to
discriminate the metastases.
Invasion of a primary tumor into surrounding tissues
followed by dissemination and growth of secondary malignancies (metastasis) require a concerted series of events
including dissociation of primary tumor cells from the primary neoplasia, entry into the circulatory system, and colonization at distant sites. The series of steps needed for
metastatic spread involve changes in the expression of many
genes (Du and Pertsemlidis 2010). Investigations of microRNAs (miRNAs) regulation of these steps have identified
several specific miRNAs that either promote or inhibit
metastatic potential. MiR-125a-5p was reported to inhibit
migration and invasion of lung cancer cells by regulating the
expression of several downstream genes of epidermal
growth factor receptor signaling (Wang et al. 2009a). Overexpression of miR-126 in a lung cancer cell line resulted in a
decrease in Crk protein that is a member of a family of
adaptor proteins involved in intracellular signal pathways
altering cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration (Crawford et al. 2008). Expression level of miR-183 was demonstrated to reversely correlate with the metastatic potential of
lung cancer cells by targeting VIL2-coding protein ezrin and
regulating the expression of other genes involved in migration and invasion (Wang et al. 2008). MiR-200 inhibits lung

adenocarcinoma cell invasion and metastasis by targeting
Flt1/VEGFR1 in a mouse model (Roybal et al. 2011). MiR221 & 222 enhance cellular migration through the activation
of the AKT pathway (Garofalo et al. 2009).
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that serum/plasma
miRNAs derived from various tissues/organs are stable and
resistant to nuclease digestion. Expression levels of miRNAs in blood have been found to be reproducible and
indicative of the disease status (Chen et al. 2008). Thus,
specific signatures of blood miRNA could be obtained from
total blood samples and can be used in the identification of
biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, or even the etiology of
a disease. In this study, using blood samples collected from
the Stage IV NSCLC patients, the Stage I/II NSCLC
patients, and healthy controls, we intended to find a cluster
of miRNAs that can be used as new risk markers for the
diagnosis of lung cancer metastasis.
Materials and methods
Controls and patients’ samples
Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA anticoagulation
tubes from 20 healthy controls, 30 NSCLC patients of Stage
IV, and 32 patients of Stage I/II according to TNM stage of
2007. All the individuals enrolled gave their informed consent, and the Ethical and Scientific Committees of the hospital approved the study. None of the controls had previously
been diagnosed with a malignancy. Among the controls, 10
were male and 10 female. And of the Stage IV patients, 13
cases were diagnosed with lung squamous cell carcinoma,
while 17 cases adenocarcinoma. Of the Stage I/II patients, 20
cases were of Stage I and 12 of Stage II.
The blood was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min,
within 4 h after the collection, and then the serum was
separated from the blood immediately, frozen in the
refrigerator, and stored at -80C until RNA isolation.
During the sample storage, repeated freeze-thawing were
avoided to ensure the quality of the samples.
Extraction of total RNA from the serum
The total RNA including small RNAs was extracted from
200 lL of the serum using the Qiagen Cat 217,004 kit
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality
was assessed with the Thermo Scientific Nano Drop 1,000
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).
RT-PCR for miRNA quantification
Firstly, we tested the serum levels of the specified miRNAs
from the 20 controls and the 30 Stage IV NSCLC patients.
We modified a stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR method to
quantify the expression of the miRNAs including miR125a-5p, miR-126, miR-183, miR-200, miR-221, miR-222,
and U6 in the Light Cycler platform. Then the miRNAs
that had statistical difference between the controls and
Stage IV NSCLC patients were quantified from the serum
of the Stage I/II NSCLC patients. Normalization was performed with the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) U6. This
snRNA is a stably expressed reference gene suitable for use
as normalizers. The sequences of the miRNAs and U6 were
obtained from the miRbase (V16.0) on line, and the
primers used in this study were designed by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. with the software DNA Star
6.1.3. The final procedure of stem-loop RT-PCR includes
the following two main steps.
Reverse transcription with miRNA-specific stem-loop
primers
We used 2.5 lL total RNA to perform reverse transcription
of RNA with the Applied Biosystems ABI7900 according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. We added 0.5 lL
miRNA-specific primers and 2.5 lL total RNA to incubate
at 70C for 10 min and then snap on ice for 3 min. So the
total RNA got denatured. Then we added 3.0 lL of the
mixture of the denatured total RNA and RT primers, 0.25
lL dNTP (10 mM each, Takara, D4030RA), 1.00 lL RT
buffer (59), 0.25 lL RNase inhibitor (40 U/lL, Takara,
D2313A), and 0.5 lL M-MLV (200 U/lL, Takara,
D2639A), performed the RT reaction in a total volume of 5
lL at 42C for 60 min, then deactivated the enzymes at
70C for 15 min, hold at 4C, and finally we got the RT
product. Meanwhile, the negative controls with no template
(NTC) were included for the miRNAs.
Quantification of the miRNAs and U6 expression
by RT-PCR
Real-time PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 lL per
reaction in triplicate. We placed 1 lL of RT product
described previously into a 19 lL reaction mixture that
contained 10.0 ul Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Super MixUDG (Invitrogen, 11733-038), 0.4 lL ROX reference dye,
7.8 lL diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated H2O, 0.8 lL
primer mix of the forward primers and the reverse primers
(10 uM), and 1.0 lL RT product. The cycling protocol
consisted of an initial 2-min step at 50C to clear the DNA
residue of the previous time, a 2-min initial denaturation step
at 95C, followed by 39 cycles of denaturation at 95C for
15 s, annealing and extension at 60C for 30 s, and then
plate-reading of fluorescence signals, melt-curve analysis
from 65 to 90C. Real-time PCR for U6 gene was performed
in the same way, by using the corresponding primers.

Statistical analysis
Careful normalization is essential for accurate quantification of miRNAs. We evaluated all the data with respect to
the expression of the miRNAs described previously by
normalizing to the expression of U6 and using the 2-DDCt
method. We assessed the differentially expression of the
miRNAs in the controls and the patients with different
clinicopathological features using t test. All the data were
analyzed with SPSS software (version 11.0, SPSS), and
P\0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
We firstly measured the expression levels for miR-125a-5p,
miR-126, miR-183, miR-200, miR-221, miR-222, and U6
in serum samples from the 20 healthy controls and 30 Stage
IV NSCLC patients, and then we chosed to examine the
serum levels of miR-126, miR-183, miR-222, and U6 from
32 Stage I/II NSCLC patients according to the preceding
results (primers for the miRNAs shown in Table 1). The
sequence data have been submitted to the miRbase V16.0
under accession number MIMAT0000443, MIMAT00
00445, MIMAT0000261, MIMAT0000682/MIMAT00003
18/MIMAT0000617, MIMAT0000278, MIMAT0000279,
and NR_004394.1 in turn. All the miRNAs listed above
could be detected in all the serum from the patients and the
controls by stem-loop RT-PCR.
Comparison of the serum miRNAs between the male
and female controls
Although all of the miRNAs listed previously were
reported to have relation to lung cancer metastasis, we
demonstrate that they were present in the serum from the
20 healthy controls. To determine whether the miRNAs
levels of the man and woman were different, we analyzed
the serum levels for these miRNAs from the controls. And
no statistical difference was observed for the expression of
any miRNA listed previously between the serum of the
male and female controls (Fig. 1, P[0.05).
Comparison of the serum miRNAs between the Stage
IV NSCLC patients of adenocarcinoma and squamous
cell cancer
Some studies have indicated that certain miRNAs can be
used to discriminate different pathological types of lung
cancer. However, we observed no statistical difference for
serum levels of any miRNA listed above between the Stage
IV NSCLC patients of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma (Fig. 2, P[0.05).

Comparison of the serum miRNAs between the controls
and Stage IV NSCLC patients
Since these specified miRNAs have been reported to play
various roles in the metastasis procedure of lung cancer in
vitro, we attempted to study the expression levels of them
from human’s serum. As shown in Fig. 3, there was statistical difference for the levels of hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR183, and hsa-miR-222 between the serum of the Stage IV
NSCLC patients and the controls (P\0.05), but not for

statistical difference for the
expression of any miRNA listed
above between the serum
samples of the male and female
controls (P[0.05)

expression of any miRNA listed

the levels of hsa-miR-200, hsa-miR-125a-5p, and hsa-miR221 (P[0.05). It seemed that the serum levels of hsamiR-126, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-222 may have closer
relation to lung cancer metastases.
Comparison of the serum miRNAs between the controls
and Stage I/II NSCLC patients, and between Stage I/II
NSCLC patients and Stage IV NSCLC patients
Since the preceding results had shown that the serum levels
of hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-222 may be
closely related to lung cancer metastases, we chose these
three miRNAs for further investigation. We made further
efforts to examine the serum levels for hsa-miR-126, hsamiR-183, and hsa-miR-222 from the Stage I/II NSCLC
patients at exactly the same conditions as described previously, so that the data were credible and comparable.
Then we analyzed the serum levels of these three miRNAs
between the controls and Stage I/II NSCLC patients, and
between the Stage I/II NSCLC patients and the Stage IV
NSCLC patients. As a result, there was no statistical difference for hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-222
between the controls and Stage I/II patients (P[0.05).
Meanwhile, it showed statistical difference for hsa-miR126 and hsa-miR-183 between the Stage I/II patients and
Stage IV patients (P\0.05), but not for hsa-miR-222
(P[0.05) (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). The data indicated that
serum levels for hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-183 may be
truly related to the procedure of lung cancer metastases.
Hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-183 may serve as serum biomarkers for diagnosing metastatic NSCLC.
Discussion
Tumor metastasis is one of the most important prognostic
factors for advanced NSCLC, which often results in treatment failure. So it seems urgent to detect metastasis in a
convenient way at a relatively early stage.
It has been well established that miRNAs are present in
human’s peripheral blood. And some researches have
focused on the sources of circulatory miRNAs. In healthy

difference for the levels of hsamiR-126, hsa-miR-183, and

individuals, by measuring miRNAs in the peripheral blood
and blood cells, it was found that circulatory miRNAs
came from blood cells. In cancer patients, many reports
have clearly shown that cancer affect miRNA levels in the
bloodstream, although it is still unclear how tumor miRNAs make their way into the bloodstream. So far, there has
been no definitive conclusion of cancer-related miRNAs
sources, but it is for certain that they have no relation with
blood cells (Chen et al. 2008). However, there are mainly
two conjectures about the sources of cancer-related miRNAs. They may originate from cancer cells in the circulation (Mitchell et al. 2008). They may be present as a
result of tumor cells dying and getting lysed or tumor cells
releasing miRNAs into the surrounding environment (Chin
and Slack 2008). The other conjecture is that they may
come from tumor-derived exosomes. Some researchers
detected certain miRNA levels of cancer cells and circulating tumor exosomes from ovarian cancer patients by
using a modified MACS procedure with anti-EpCAM, and
it was proposed that cancer-related miRNAs in the
circulation came from tumor-derived exosomes (Taylor
and Gercel-Taylor 2010).
Quantification of miRNAs by stem-loop RT-PCR and
high-flux sequencing technology were used to confirm that
the vast majorities of the small RNAs were miRNAs in
peripheral blood (Chen et al. 2008). Other qualitative,
quantitative, or semiquantitative experiments also indicated
that miRNAs exist in human’s peripheral blood (Lawrie
et al. 2008; Resnick et al. 2009; Chim et al. 2008; Gilad
et al. 2008). In fact, stem-loop RT primers are better than
conventional ones in terms of RT efficiency and specificity.
Furthermore, they are not affected by genomic DNA contamination. Precise quantification is achieved routinely
with as little as 25 pg of total RNA for most miRNAs. This
method enables fast, accurate, and sensitive miRNA
expression profiling and can identify and monitor potential
biomarkers specific to tissues or diseases (Chen et al.
2005). This present study applied the stem-loop RT-PCR
method to show that certain miRNAs such as miR-125a-5p,
miR-126, miR-183, miR-200, miR-221, and miR-222 were
present in peripheral blood. At the same time, the serum
samples can be obtained atraumatically and conveniently.
Besides, miRNAs are stable in peripheral blood. Given
that serum has been reported to contain high levels of
RNase activity, miRNAs exist in a form that is resistant to
serum nuclease activity. Studies have shown that the levels
of endogenous miRNAs remain stable in many other harsh
conditions such as prolonged room temperature incubation,
repeated freeze-thawing procedures, boiling, superacid,
and peralkaline. The intrinsic stability of miRNAs may
attribute to their small size and chemical structure, but not
the extrinsic conditions (Mitchell et al. 2008; Resnick et al.
2009; Chim et al. 2008).
In addition, miRNA measurements are substantially
identical in serum compared with in plasma, indicating that
both serum and plasma samples will be suitable for the
investigations of miRNAs as blood-based biomarkers.
Studies also indicate that there is not any significant difference of miRNAs level between men and women (Chen
et al. 2008; Mitchell et al. 2008). Our study demonstrated
that the serum levels for miR-125a-5p, miR-126, miR-183,
miR-200, miR-221, and miR-222 between the male and
female controls were not significantly different, which kept
identical with the previous studies.
Four major hallmarks—unlimited cell proliferation,
autonomous growth, resistance to growth inhibitory signals, and escape from apoptosis—are central to the transformation of a normal cell to a cancer phenotype, the initial
step of tumorigenesis. MiRNAs have recently been implicated as important modulators of these cell growth and
survival processes, and their deregulation can initiate
malignant transformation and unchecked cellular growth
(Du and Pertsemlidis 2010). The regulatory mechanisms of

NSCLC patients, and the Stage I/II NSCLC patients were tested by

difference between the Stage I/II patients and Stage IV patients
(P\0.05)

between the controls and Stage I/II patients (P[0.05), nor between
the Stage I/II patients and Stage IV patients (P [0.05)

miRNA expression includes various ways such as epigenetic changes (methylation for example),transcription factor misadjustment that controls the expression of miRNA
coding gene, chromosome abnormality, genic mutation,
single-nucleotide polymorphism, mechanism disorders of
miRNA biosynthesis, and so on (Du and Pertsemlidis
2010). And as continuously being shown, miRNAs can act
as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors (Esquela-Kerscher and Slack 2006). Through various techniques,
numerous groups have shown that different cancer types
including NSCLC have distinct miRNA profiles. This may
explain why some cancer-related miRNAs are up-regulated
and others are down-regulated.
In our present study, all of the six specified miRNAs
have been reported to be involved in lung cancer metastases in vitro; however, the serum level for some of them
was of no significant difference between the healthy controls and the patients. Only hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-183,
and hsa-miR-222 showed significant difference between
the serum of the Stage IV NSCLC patients and the controls.
And the expression levels for these three miRNAs were
lower in the patients than in the controls. It seems difficult
to understand the relation and function of tissue and serum
miRNAs levels.
As described above, there is a hypothesis that tumor
cells use exosomes/microvesicles to transport genetic
information, including miRNAs, to surrounding cells and
thereby support tumor growth and progression (Skog et al.
2008). Moreover, circulating miRNAs might modulate
immune responses (Valenti et al. 2007; Baj-Krzyworzeka
et al. 2007): For example, micro vesicles derived from
human melanoma and colon cancer can promote tumor
growth and immune escape by mediating the differentiation of monocytes toward TGFb-secreting myeloid suppressive cells (Valenti et al. 2007). However, it has not
been investigated if these effects are mediated by the
miRNAs contained in the microvesicles.
There are also contradictive assumptions about the
question. Wang et al. (2009b) concluded from their study
that specific miRNAs are released into the blood stream
after drug induced liver injury leading to a down-regulation
in the tissue. In contrast to that, Tanaka et al. 2009 speculated that tumor cells rely on the specific intake of miRNAs from circulating micro vesicles. These different
viewpoints clearly demonstrate a need for additional
studies to elucidate the relation of tissue and serum miRNAs expression levels.
In fact, many researches have indicated that miRNAs
play essential roles in tissue differentiation during normal
development and tumorigenesis (Mascaux et al. 2009).
Certain miRNAs are differentially expressed in lung
squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas. A group
of these miRNAs shows considerable tissue specificity (Lu
et al. 2005). For example, miR-205 is believed to be a
marker of stratified squamous epithelium (Ryan et al.
2006), and its expression is retained in squamous cell
cancers of the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Yanaihara et al. 2006; Jiang et al. 2005). Actually, the differential expression of miR-205 in lung squamous cell cancers
but not in adenocarcinomas provides a rationale for the
classification of NSCLCs based on miRNA expression
profiling. Quantification of miR-205 level has recently
been optimized for formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
samples, so that levels of miR-205 can now be used to
classify NSCLCs with a high degree of sensitivity and
specificity (Lebanony et al. 2009). It was found that it had
100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in differentiating
squamous cell cancers and adenocarcinomas for the lung
cancer resections by applying quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to analyze the hsa-miR-205 and hsa-miR-21
expression together (Bishop et al. 2010). However, so far
there have been no data about the serum level of miR-205
in NSCLCs. Our study demonstrated that there was no
significant difference in the serum levels for certain miRNAs including miR-125a-5p, miR-126, miR-183, miR-200,
miR-221, and miR-222 between the lung squamous cell
cancer patients and adenocarcinoma patients, indicating
that the serum levels of these miRNAs may have no relation to the pathological types of NSCLCs.
As for the serum levels for the six cited miRNAs, our
study showed significant difference for hsa-miR-126, hsamiR-183, and hsa-miR-222 between the Stage IV NSCLC
patients and the controls. Further study showed that there
was no statistical difference for hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR183, and hsa-miR-222 between the controls and Stage I/II
patients, which demonstrated that the expression of hsamiR-126, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-222 kept stable at the
early stage of NSCLC. Furthermore, it showed statistical
difference for hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-183 between the
Stage I/II patients and Stage IV patients, but not for hsamiR-222, which indicated that the serum levels for hsamiR-126 and hsa-miR-183 changed, but hsa-miR-222 kept
at a stable level as the metastases developed. So we concluded that the levels of hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR-183
were closely related to lung cancer metastases and these
two miRNAs had the potential to serve as serum biomarkers for diagnosing NSCLC metastases. Interestingly,
our study demonstrated that the three miRNAs—hsa-miR126, hsa-miR-183, and hsa-miR-222— were all downregulated in the patients’ serum, which indicated that they
could inhibit cancer progression, while hsa-miR-126 and
hsa-miR-183 could play an important role in inhibiting
lung cancer metastases.
The data of this study showed that the serum level for
miR-126 was 2.5-fold decrease in the Stage IV NSCLC
patients versus the controls. By analyzing a miRNA profile
J Cancer Res Clin Oncol (2012) 138:85–93 91
123

of SCC samples of Chinese lung cancer patients, Yang
et al. (2010) identified that miR-126 was one of the miRNAs that were down-regulated in the tumors compared
with non-cancerous lung tissues. The over-expression of
miR-126 results in a decrease in Crk protein, which is a
member of a family of adaptor proteins involved in intracellular signal pathways altering cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. As increased expression of Crk has
been described in lung cancer and associated with
increased tumor invasiveness, so miR-126 alters lung
cancer cell phenotype by inhibiting adhesion, migration,
and invasion, and the effects on invasion may be partially
mediated through Crk regulation (Crawford et al. 2008).
With regard to hsa-miR-183, our data showed that the
level was up to tenfold decrease in the Stage IV NSCLC
patients versus the controls. It was identified that several
potential downstream effectors including ezrin and more
than 30 genes were involved in metastases in pulmonary
giant cell cancer (Wang et al. 2008). Further study showed
that ezrin and parathyroid hormone-related protein were
up-regulated at sites of bone metastasis as detected by RTPCR and immunohistochemistry in HARA lung squamous
carcinoma cells, which offers new mechanistic insights into
the metastasis of lung cancer and provides potential targets
for the prevention and treatment of lung cancer metastasis
(Deng et al. 2007).
In our study, the serum level for miR-222 was nearly
twofold decrease in the Stage IV NSCLC patients versus
the controls with significant difference. However, the
serum level for miR-221 between the two groups showed
no significant difference. Some previous studies proved
that miR-221 & 222 function in the same way. MiR-221 &
222 induce TRAIL resistance and enhance cellular migration through the activation of the AKT pathway and metallopeptidases by targeting PTEN and TIMP3 tumor
suppressors. And the MET oncogene is involved in miR222 and miR-221 activation through the c-Jun transcription
factor (Garofalo et al. 2009). Our study showed that miR222 was at a relatively higher level, indicating that examination in the serum may be less sensitive or perhaps only a
part of microRNAs in the tumor cells can be released to the
serum. In this way, it is easy to understand that the serum
levels for other three miRNAs miR-125a-5p, miR-200, and
miR-221 were of no significant difference between the
patients and the controls.
For patients with suspected metastatic lung cancer, histopathological diagnosis is the gold standard; however,
sometimes it is difficult to obtain tissue for diagnosis.
Computed tomography (CT) even combined with positron
emission tomography (PET) is usually used to detect the
metastasis or stage the disease. Even though it is a widely
used tool for diagnosing and managing suspected lung
cancer, it has limited sensitivity and specificity, besides
PET is very expensive. In contrast, detecting the serum
level of certain miRNAs by stem-loop RT-PCR is relatively
convenient and economical. Additionally, it may be applied
to improve the accuracy for diagnosing metastatic lung
cancer combined with other currently widely used tools.
Although currently there are some problems with using
miRNAs as cancer biomarkers such as the unclearly cut
reference range and the lack of large-sample data, our
study extends the potential of hsa-miR-126 and hsa-miR183 to serve as molecular markers for human primary lung
cancer. The serum levels for these miRNAs could be
identified as an indicator for metastatic NSCLCs. And they
may be applied clinically combining with other lung cancer-specific miRNAs such as miR-21, miR-210, and miR486-5p in the future (Shen et al. 2011). Since there have
been some meaningful findings, we are planning to further
study these miRNAs in NSCLCs.
