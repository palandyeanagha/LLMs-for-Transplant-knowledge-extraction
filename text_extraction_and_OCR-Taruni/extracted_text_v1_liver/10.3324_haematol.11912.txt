ABSTRACT
Background
Human cytomegalovirus infection is the most frequent viral complication in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We investigated the development of human
cytomegalovirus-specific T cells in adult recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants.
Design and Methods
From May 2003 through October 2006 a total of 45 patients were monitored for human
cytomegalovirus-specific T-cell reconstitution. Human cytomegalovirus-infected autologous
dendritic cells were used as a stimulus to detect interferon-γ-producing human cytomegalovirus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells during the first year after transplantation. Interleukin-2
production by specific T cells was also determined.
Results
Human cytomegalovirus infection was detected in the blood of 39/45 patients at a median of
29 days after transplantation. Human cytomegalovirus-specific T-cell reconstitution followed
reactivation of latent human cytomegalovirus infection at a median time of about 2 months
after transplantation. Only donor human cytomegalovirus-seronegativity and bone marrow as a
stem cell source were found to delay specific T-cell reconstitution significantly. Levels of three
CD8+ and one CD4+ human cytomegalovirus-specific T-cells/µL blood had a positive predictive
value of around 80% for identifying patients able to control human cytomegalovirus infection
spontaneously. Five patients who received high doses of steroids for treatment of graft-versushost disease developed human cytomegalovirus infection requiring pre-emptive treatment
despite high levels of interferon-γ-producing T cells in response to human cytomegalovirus.
Specific interleukin-2 production was not detected in patients with human cytomegalovirus
infection requiring treatment, while 90% of patients who spontaneously controlled human
cytomegalovirus infection had T cells that produced interleukin-2 and interferon-γ.
Conclusions
Pre-transplant human cytomegalovirus infection of the recipient is a major factor driving human
cytomegalovirus-specific immune reconstitution. Control of human cytomegalovirus infection
likely requires the presence of both interferon-γ and interleukin-2 producing T cells.
Corticosteroid treatment may favor active viral replication even in patients with specific T cells.
Key words: human cytomegalovirus, specific T cells, stem cell transplantation.

HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution after HSCT
haematologica | 2008; 93(2) | 249 |
Introduction
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is the most
frequent viral complication in patients undergoing
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).1 The use
of prophylactic and pre-emptive treatment strategies has
significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of
HCMV infection.2-4 However, both HCMV-specific CD8+
and CD4+ arms of the T-cell immune response must be
reconstituted in order to acquire long-term protection
against HCMV relapse and disease in humans. Early studies used conventional functional assays, i.e. cytotoxicity
and lymphoproliferation assays to determine HCMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell-mediated immune responses,
respectively.5-7
In recent years, rapid techniques, such as tetramer staining, and intra- or extra-cellular detection of cytokine production have been developed to assess virus-specific T-cell
memory responses. However, the majority of studies
evaluating the kinetics of HCMV infection and HCMVspecific T-cell reconstitution after HSCT, while assessing a
CD4+ T-cell response against whole viral antigens (infected cell lysate), have focused only on pp65-and IE-1 as targets for a CD8+ T-cell response.8-11 Although these two
proteins have been recognized as immunodominant for
the CD8+ T-cell response to HCMV,12,13 a number of other
viral proteins are recognized by T cells14,15 and quantification of T cells specific for pp65 and IE-1 cannot account
for and does not correlate with the actual HCMV-specific
T-cell pool. In this respect, it was observed in solid organ
transplant recipients that the assessment of only pp65-
and IE-1-specific T cells underestimates the actual T-cell
immune response against HCMV.16
A different methodological approach providing a more
comprehensive evaluation of the HCMV-specific T-cell
immune response,17 was recently adopted to study the
kinetics of HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution in children
undergoing HSCT.18 This method, based on the use of
HCMV-infected immature dendritic cells as the stimulus,
provides a broader and more physiological activation of T
cells, along with simultaneous quantification and functional evaluation of both HCMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+
T cells.
In this study, we took advantage of the same technique
to investigate the development of HCMV-specific T-cell
immunity in adult HSCT recipients, in order to better
define the kinetics of T-cell reconstitution in this high risk
population and its correlation with immune control of
HCMV infection. 
Design and Methods
Patients
From May 2003 through October 2006, a total of 45
patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT were monitored for
HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution. The patients’ characteristics are reported in detail in Table 1. Donor-recipient
histocompatibility was determined by serology for HLAA and HLA-B antigens, and by a high molecular resolution
allelic technique for DRB1. The study was approved by
the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Ethics
Committee, and patients gave their written informed consent prior to entering the study.
Virological follow-up
HCMV infection was considered to be present when
HCMV was detected in blood by any assay, in the
absence of clinical manifestations or organ function
abnormalities, while HCMV disease was defined as either
systemic or local HCMV infection, associated with clinical symptoms and/or organ function abnormalities.22
Patients were randomized to monitoring of HCMV
reactivation by either the antigenemia or the DNAemia
assay, according to methods previously described.20,21 In
the antigenemia arm, patients were treated upon first
detection of either two or more pp65-positive leukocytes
or upon first confirmed positivity, when a single positive
cell was detected.22 In the DNAemia arm, patients were
treated when reaching a cut-off of 10,000 DNA copies/mL
whole blood. For all patients the duration of therapy was
determined by clearance of virus from blood according to
the guiding assay, and treatment was stopped after two
consecutive negative results. Relapses were treated similarly. In addition, viremia, and donor/recipient HCMV
serostatus were evaluated according to previously reported methods.23,24 Pre-emptive therapy of HCMV infection
was intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice a day).
Ganciclovir was replaced by foscarnet (90 mg/kg twice a
day) in the case of ganciclovir-induced neutropenia or
increasing levels of viremia.

Patients’ treatment
All patients were given a full-intensity myeloablative
preparative regimen. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)
prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine A associated with a
short course of methotrexate and steroids (methylprednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day until day +30), for patients receiving an allograft from an HLA-identical sibling, whereas
15/18 patients transplanted from an unrelated donor also
received anti-thymocyte globulin before HSCT. Acute
GvHD was treated with steroids as first-line therapy
(methylprednisolone 2-5 mg/kg/day), while patients with
steroid-resistant disease were treated with mofetil
mycophenolate and extracorporeal photochemotherapy. 
Immunological follow-up
Immunological reconstitution was investigated 30, 60,
90, 180 and 360 days after transplantation. HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were simultaneously quantified
by a novel method based on the use of autologous, monocyte-derived, HCMV-infected dendritic cells as previously
described.17 Briefly, following in vitro generation from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells,25 dendritic cells were
infected for 24 hours with an endotheliotropic and
leukotropic strain of HCMV (VR1814).26 HCMV-infected
dendritic cells were then co-cultured overnight with autologous thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cells at a
ratio of 1:20 in the presence of 10 µg/mL brefeldin A
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) to prevent cytokine release.
Finally, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were tested for the frequency of HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+
interferon (IFN)-γ-producing T cells by cytokine flow
cytometry. In some patients, interleukin (IL)-2 production
was also determined.
Absolute CD3+
CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cell counts were
determined on heparinized peripheral blood samples by
direct immunofluorescence flow cytometry (Beckman
Coulter Inc, Fullertone, CA, USA). The total number of
HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was calculated by
multiplying the percentages of HCMV-specific T-cells
positive for IFN-γ by the relevant absolute CD4+ and CD8+
T-cell counts. Based on results obtained by testing 46
HCMV-seropositive and eight HCMV-seronegative
healthy blood donors, “responders” (i.e. patients with
virus-specific immunity) were defined as those subjects
with HCMV-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells counts greater
than 0.4/µL blood.17
Flow cytometry analysis
Following incubation with HCMV-infected dendritic
cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were tested for
intracellular IFN-γ production. The mononuclear cells
were washed and incubated for 30 min on ice for surface
staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (Beckman Coulter
Immunotech, Marseilles, France) and phycoerythrin
cyanin 5 (PC5)-conjugated anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody
(Beckman Coulter Immunotech) in phosphate-buffered
saline + 5% fetal bovine serum, containing 5% human immunoglobulin and 0.01% sodium azide. Cells were then
washed with phosphate-buffered saline + 5% fetal bovine
serum, fixed and permeabilized using the FIX and PERM®
kit (Caltag, Burlingham, CA, USA), and stained for 45 min
with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody (Beckman Coulter Immunotech). To determine IFN-γ/IL-2 production, surface staining was performed with PC5-conjugated anti-CD4 and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies
(Beckman Coulter Immunotech), while PE-conjugated
anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody was coupled with FITCconjugated anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody (Caltag) for
intracytoplasmic staining. 
Cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde and
analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BectonDickinson, San José, CA, USA) equipped with a 488 nm
argon laser and a 635 nm red-diode laser, operating with
the CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson). As a routine,
1-2x105 viable lymphocytes were collected and at least
2.5x104 CD4+ and CD8bright T-cells were analyzed as above.
The frequencies of CD4+ and CD8bright T cells producing
IFNγ in response to HCMV stimuli were calculated by
subtracting the value of the sample incubated with mockinfected dendritic cells (consistently <0.05%) from the test
value.
Statistical analysis
Differences between medians were compared by using
the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data or Wilcoxon’s
test for paired data. 
The curves of the percentages of patients showing
HCMV infection or HCMV-specific immune response in
the first year after transplantation in the different groups
of HSCT recipients were calculated and expressed as
cumulative incidences, with death and infection relapse
being competing risks,27,28 and compared by the log-rank
test; p values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant, while p values from 0.05 to 0.1 were considered statistically non-significant, but are reported in detail.
All variables with a p value less than 0.5 in univariate
analysis were included in a multivariate analysis performed using the Cox-proportional hazard regression
model. Receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) analysis
was performed to identify levels of HCMV-specific CD4+
and CD8+ T cells protective against HCMV infection.
Results
HCMV infection and T-cell immune reconstitution
HCMV infection was detected in the blood of 39/45
patients (1 year cumulative incidence: 87%) at a median of
29 days (range, 16-68) after transplantation. In detail,
HCMV infection developed in all donor HCMV-negative
(D–
), recipient HCMV-positive (R+) patients and 27/28 D+R+
patients (96%), while it occurred in only 3/8 D+R– patients

(38%, p<0.01). As shown in Figure 1A, HCMV infection
developed earlier in D–
R+ patients, later in D+R+ patients
and lastly in D+
R– patients (p<0.01, log-rank test for trend).
No patient developed HCMV disease, due to the effective
pre-emptive treatment approach. HCMV-specific T-cell
development followed HCMV infection, with the appearance of CD8+ T cells slightly preceding that of CD4+ T cells
(median time: 60 vs. 67 days, p=0.06, Figure 1B). Although
the number of HCMV-negative recipients examined was
small, it was possible to identify, among patients receiving
a transplant from a positive donor, a lower rate of HCMVspecific T-cell reconstitution in HCMV-negative recipients
with respect to HCMV-positive recipients. On the other
hand, D–
R+ patients showed delayed T-cell reconstitution
with respect to D+
R+ (median time: 101 days for CD8+ and
111 days for CD4+ T cells, Figures 1C and D). The 1-year
cumulative incidence of development of HCMV-specific
CD4+ T cells was 93% for D+
R+, 78% for D–R+ and 63% for
D+
R–, and that of specific CD8+ T cells was 96% for D+R+,
89% for D–
R+ and 63% for D+R–.

Among HCMV-positive recipients, two D+R+ and two
D–
R+ died from transplant related complications before
specific T-cell reconstitution occurred (two of them developed only CD8+ T cells and the other two did not develop either CD8+ or CD4+
). At the last follow-up visit, all
four of these patients still showed active HCMV infection
in their blood. All the surviving HCMV-positive recipients
developed HCMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells within
4 to 6 months after HSCT, respectively. On the other
hand, after 1 year, 3/8 D+
/R– patients had not developed
either infection or specific immunity, and one of them
exhibited an initial (day +30) HCMV-specific T-cell
response which disappeared at subsequent control visits.
The total CD8+ T cell count was not different in the
three groups of D/R patients, reaching that of controls
from day +90 (data not reported). Levels of HCMV-specific
CD8+ T cells were lower than those of controls at day +30,
similar at days +60 and +90, and higher from day +180
(p<0.01). Specific T-cell counts were not significantly different between HCMV-positive and -negative recipients
undergoing HSCT from a positive donor (although positive recipients reached higher peak values), whereas they
were lower in D–
R+ patients (p<0.05) at days +30 and +60
(Figure 2A, B and C). 
As observed for CD8+ T cells, the total CD4+ T-cell
count was not different among the three groups of D/R
patients (data not shown), remaining significantly lower
than that of controls throughout the follow-up. The median number of HCMV-specific CD4+ T-cells was lower
than that of controls at days +30, +60 and +90, reaching
that of controls from day +180 onwards. No difference in
levels of HCMV-specific CD4+ T cells was found between
D+
R+ and D+R– patients (although, as observed for CD8+ T
cells, positive recipients reached higher peak values),
while patients receiving stem cells from negative donors
had lower levels of HCMV-specific CD4+ T cells (p<0.05)
at days +30 and +60 (Figure 2D, E and F). It is notable that
HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution was relatively more
pronounced in magnitude than total T-cell reconstitution
for both CD8+ and CD4+ subpopulations. In fact, the ratio
of HCMV-specific to total T-cells was higher in HSCT
recipients than in controls (p<0. 01; data not reported).
Factors influencing the kinetics of reconstitution of
CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-γ-producing T-cells 
Multiple factors were analyzed in a Cox regression
model to evaluate their possible influence on the recovery
of an HCMV-specific T-cell-mediated immune response:
conditioning regimen (total body irradiation- or chemotherapy-based), stem cell source (peripheral blood/bone
marrow), donor HCMV serostatus, donor type (sibling/unrelated), anti-thymocyte globulin administration,
and randomization arm (antigenemia/DNAemia). Only
the use of a seronegative donor (for both T-cell subpopulations) and bone marrow as the source of stem cells (for
CD4+ T-cells) were associated with a delayed recovery of
an HCMV-specific immune response (Table 2).
Relationship of HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution and
control of viral infection
In order to determine the level of HCMV-specific T cells
apparently able to control infection, we compared (Figure
3A) the number of specific T cells detected in patients considered as non-protected (i.e. those reaching the cut-off for
pre-emptive treatment), and in patients considered as protected (i.e. those without viremia after antiviral treatment,
referred to as having chemotherapy-resolved infection, and in
those with active HCMV infection which was not treated

due to spontaneous resolution, referred to as having selfresolving infection). ROC analysis showed that a cut-off
level of one CD4+ and three CD8+ HCMV-specific T
cells/µL blood had 78% sensitivity, 79% specificity, 83%
positive predictive value, 73% negative predictive value,
and 100% sensitivity, 71% specificity, 82% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value, respectively, for identifying patients able to spontaneously control
HCMV infection in the absence of treatment. As an
exception, five patients, all receiving high doses of
steroids for GvHD treatment, developed relapsing HCMV
infection requiring pre-emptive treatment in the presence
of both CD8+ and CD4+ specific T cells above the cut-off
levels.
In a subgroup of samples obtained from 18 patients, the
simultaneous production of IFN-γ and IL-2 by HCMV-specific T cells was evaluated (Figure 3B). In patients considered as non-protected, no IL-2 production was detected in
response to the HCMV-infected dendritic cell stimulus,
even in the presence of IFN-γ+ HCMV-specific T cells. On
the other hand, the great majority of protected patients had
HCMV-specific T cells producing both IFN-γ and IL-2,
especially in the CD4+ compartment. In detail, 17/19
(89%) patients examined had IL-2+ HCMV-specific CD4+
T cells (3-86% of IFNγ+CD4+-specific T-cells; 0.06-3.74%
of total CD4+ T-cells), while IL-2+ HCMV-specific CD8+ T
cells were detected in 8/19 (42%) patients (1-16% of IFNγ+
CD8+-specific T cells; 0.10-1.53% of total CD8+ T cells).
Discussion
The kinetics and magnitude of HCMV infection and
HCMV-specific T-cell immune reconstitution were investigated in adult patients undergoing HSCT by means of a
novel methodology which provides a more comprehensive assessment of the virus-specific T-cell pool as compared to methods exploiting stimuli given by single peptides or peptide mixtures, or based on MHC-multimer
staining.16,17 Major innovative results of our study are: i)
pre-transplant HCMV infection of the recipient is a major
factor driving HCMV-specific immune reconstitution; ii)
cut-off levels of both HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells presumably conferring protection against HCMV
infection were determined; iii) control of HCMV infection
appeared to require the presence of both IFN-γ and IL-2-
producing T cells. 
As for the first point, HCMV-specific immune reconstitution appeared to be relatively more pronounced in magnitude than total T-cell reconstitution. HCMV reactivation
(which preceded specific T-cell reconstitution) was detected in the blood of nearly all HCMV-positive recipients,
whereas a significantly smaller proportion of negative
recipients (less than half) developed detectable HCMV
infection in the blood, thus suggesting a minor role of the
graft in virus transmission to the recipient. Although the
number of the HCMV-negative recipients is too small to
HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution after HSCT

allow robust conclusions to be drawn, it was found that
HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution occurred in all surviving HCMV-positive recipients while about 40% of negative recipients did not develop HCMV-specific T-cell
immunity or infection within the 12 months after their
transplant. This conclusion is in keeping with previous
reports suggesting that recipient HCMV infection may act
as a booster for antigen-experienced T cells transferred
with the graft.18,29,30 However, since two HCMV-negative
recipients developed HCMV-specific immune reconstitution in the absence of detectable viral infection in blood,
an antigen-independent, cytokine-driven expansion of
donor memory T cells transferred with the graft could be
taken into consideration as an inducer of immune reconstitution in a minority of cases,31-33 unless episodes of
HCMV infection at sites other than blood may have contributed to the virus-specific immune reconstitution.
These findings are in agreement with those of a previous study conducted on children receiving HSCT, in
which it was possible to examine a higher proportion of
HCMV-negative recipients, and reactivation of latent virus
was identified as the main factor leading to immune
reconstitution.18 In pediatric patients, the presence of
donor’s memory T cells in the graft did not seem to have
a major influence on the kinetics and magnitude of
immune reconstitution. In fact, children receiving a graft
from a seronegative donor or a T-cell-depleted graft did
not show a delay in HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution.
Conversely, in the present study, it was observed that
adult patients receiving a transplant from an HCMV-negative donor reconstituted HCMV-specific T-cells significantly later than those receiving a graft from a positive
donor. This finding, in keeping with reports indicating a
better control of HCMV infection34 and reduced transplant-related mortality35 in adult patients receiving a graft
from a positive donor, supports a major role for donorderived memory T cells in accelerating immune reconstitution in adults. It can be hypothesized that children,
given their still active thymic function, have a better
capacity to develop an anti-HCMV primary immune
response in the absence of antigen-experienced T cells in
the graft. It is known that, in young children, recovery of
naïve CD4+ T cells is rapid after chemotherapy,36 whereas
in adults, following thymus atrophy, it is limited and
delayed.37 These data may provide a reasonable explanation for the well-known fact that the capacity to control
infections is less in adults than in children.
Among other factors potentially influencing immune
reconstitution, only the use of peripheral blood as the
source of stem cells was found to be significantly correlated with an earlier recovery of HCMV-specific CD4+ T
cells. This may be due to the higher number of memory T
cells in peripheral blood than in bone marrow, leading to
an earlier HCMV-specific CD4+ T-cell reconstitution.38 In
this respect, CD8+ T cells are less influenced, possibly
because they are able to undergo more rapid and massive
expansion with respect to CD4+ T cells, in response to
HCMV stimulation. The magnitude of the reconstituted
HCMV-specific CD8+ T cell pool exceeded that of CD4+ T
cells, and a much higher number of virus-specific CD8+ T
cells than that observed in healthy controls (reaching even
levels >30% of the total CD8+ T cells) accumulated and
persisted in peripheral blood. Despite the difference in
magnitude, data from this study confirm that the kinetics
of HCMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell reconstitution
are similar39 (with a median time to immune reconstitution of about 2 months), with CD8+ appearing slightly earlier than CD4+ T cells. This is different from what has
been observed in organ transplant recipients in whom
CD8+ T cells appeared consistently and significantly earlier than CD4+ T cells (median time: 3 vs. 6 months).40 This
may be due to the higher dosage of immunosuppressive
drugs which may affect CD4+ more than CD8+ T-cell
reconstitution.
As for the second point, due to the very strict virological monitoring and early pre-emptive therapy, no patient
suffered from HCMV disease. Thus, HCMV load reaching
the cut-off level for pre-emptive therapy was used as a
surrogate marker for the risk of developing HCMV disease. On the other hand, a self-resolving infection or the
sustained disappearance of HCMV after antiviral treatment was considered an indicator of acquired immune
protection against HCMV. Results of the ROC analysis
seem to confirm that, as observed for pediatric patients,18
levels of CD4+ >1 cell/µL and CD8+ >3 cells/µL may be
proposed as cut-offs for defining immune protection
against a high risk of HCMV disease. However, the positive predictive values of these cut-offs for identifying
patients able to control HCMV infection were around
80%, indicating that 20% of patients reaching these levels
of HCMV-specific T cells may still develop HCMV infection requiring treatment. In our study, as many as five
patients developed HCMV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment in the presence of levels of both CD4+ and
CD8+ specific T cells above those defined as protective. All
these five patients received high dosage steroid treatment
for GvHD.
This observation raises concerns about the protective
role of a reconstituted HCMV-specific T-cell pool in
patients undergoing steroid treatment. Previous studies
reported delayed HCMV-specific T-cell reconstitution41 or
the presence of non-functional HCMV-specific T cells42 in
patients receiving high dose steroids. In the present study,
it was found that, although developing an active HCMV
infection in blood, patients receiving high dose steroids
for GvHD treatment did not lose the reconstituted pool of
HCMV-specific T cells. Since our patients received preemptive therapy, we cannot know whether, in those with
apparent T-cell reconstitution but receiving steroid treatment, HCMV infection would have really been uncontrolled, leading to overt disease in the absence of antiviral
treatment. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that
steroid treatment affects other T-cell functions, preserving
IFN-γ production43 (which is the read-out of the assay

adopted for the identification of HCMV-specific T cells).
Thus, in order to better define the protective features of
HCMV-specific T-cells, in addition to IFN-γ production, IL2 production by HCMV-specific T cells was analyzed.
It is noteworthy that, in a recent study, functionally distinct antigen-specific T-cell subpopulations were
described based on their ability to produce IFN-γ and/or
IL-2 according to duration of antigen exposure and level of
antigen load.44 It was shown that in patients infected by
human immunodeficiery virus, control of HCMV infection required the presence of dual IFN-γ and IL-2 producing T cells.45 In accordance with this report, non-protected
HSCT recipients experiencing HCMV recurrences (also
those with specific T-cell reconstitution but receiving
steroid treatment) did not have HCMV-specific T cells
able to produce both IL-2 and IFNγ, while the great majority of protected patients did (especially in the CD4+ subset).
Lack of IL-2 may impair proper acquisition of more differentiated effector functions (such as cytotoxic activity) by
HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells. Thus, the absence of IFNγ/IL-2 producing T-cells might be an indicator of the lack
of capacity to control the infection by the recovered
HCMV-specific T-cell pool.
In conclusion, our results suggest that, as already
observed in young HSCT recipients, pre-transplant
HCMV serostatus of the recipient is the main trigger for
specific T-cell reconstitution, exceeding in relative magnitude the total T-cell reconstitution. The reconstituted
HCMV-specific T-cell pool is generally able to control the
infection in the absence of antiviral drugs. However, in
some patients, steroid treatment is associated with active
viral replication in the presence of specific T cells, thus
suggesting an immune impairment that might not be
detectable by the sole determination of IFN-γ production
by T cells. In the future, routine immunological monitoring should flank virological monitoring in the view of
making therapeutic decisions for HSCT recipients.
Virological monitoring and interventions with antiviral
drugs could be limited in patients with an adequate T-cell
immune response. However, determination of IFN-γ production alone may not be sufficient to evaluate the protective capacity of HCMV-specific T cells. Analysis of IL-2
production seems to add additional information to the
study of immune recovery. Along the same line, the search
for additional cytokines, other effector functions and
homing properties should help in the future to better
define the protective role of reconstituted HCMV-specific
T-cell immunity, particularly in patients receiving high
doses of steroids.
