Abstract
Background: NAFLD is tightly associated with various diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney
disease, and cancer. Previous studies had investigated the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic
cancers, but the available data to date is not conclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the association
between NAFLD and various extrahepatic cancers comprehensively.
Methods: Searches were conducted of various electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, and the Cochrane
Library) to identify observational studies published between 1996 and January 2020 which investigated the
association between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers. The pooled OR/HR/IRR of the association between NAFLD
and various extrahepatic cancers were analyzed.
Results: A total of 26 studies were included to investigate the association between NAFLD and various extrahepatic
cancers. As the results shown, the pooled OR values of the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomas in patients with
NAFLD were 1.72 (95%CI: 1.40–2.11) and 1.37 (95%CI: 1.29–1.46), respectively. The pooled OR values of the risk of
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in patients with NAFLD were 2.46 (95%CI:
1.77–3.44) and 2.24 (95%CI: 1.58–3.17), respectively. The pooled OR value of the risk of breast cancer in patients with
NAFLD was 1.69 (95%CI: 1.44–1.99). In addition, NAFLD was also tightly associatied with the risk of gastric cancer,
pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and esophageal cancer.
Conclusions: NAFLD could significantly increase the development risk of colorectal adenomas and cancer,
intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and esophageal cancer.
NAFLD could be considered as one of the influencing factors during the clinical diagnosis and treatment for the
extrahepatic cancers.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become
one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases globally.
Currently, it has an estimated overall prevalence of
25.2% worldwide, and 29.62% in Asia [1–4]. The disease
spectrum of NAFLD ranges from nonalcoholic fatty liver
to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually to the hepatocellular carcinoma [5].
Considering the key physical functions of the liver,
NAFLD is a complex multifactorial disease which involves sedentary life style, obesity, poor dietary habit,
sarcopenia, insulin resistance, genetic susceptibility, intestinal flora and other factors [6–9]. In addition,
NAFLD has been found to be closely related to many
diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
kidney disease. Thus, NAFLD is a multisystem disease
with extrahepatic complications [10–16].
Accumulated evidence have shown that cardiovascular
disease is the leading cause of death in patients with
NAFLD, and malignancies at both gastrointestinal (liver,
colon, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas) and extraintestinal site (kidney in men, and breast in women) were
also significant contributors to the mainly death of patients with NAFLD [17, 18]. Wongiarupong et al. conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association of
NAFLD with the risk of cholangiocarcinoma [19]. In their
study, they found that NAFLD potentially contributes to
the risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma [19]. Lee et al.
also recently reported an association between NAFLD and
esophageal, gastric, or colorectal cancers in Korea [20].
Mortality rates in NAFLD patients with any of these three
types of cancer were markedly increased, suggesting a significant association between NAFLD and the risks of
esophageal, gastric, or colorectal cancers [20].
Recently, lots of attention has been paid to the association between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers. For example, Allen et al. have investigated the effect of
NAFLD on the occurrence rate of extrahepatic cancers
in a US population, and they found a nearly 2-fold increased risk of developing cancers within 21 years
follow-up [21]. Due to differences in risk factors associated with various types of cancers in several countries,
there is no consensus about the linkage between NAFLD
and extrahepatic cancers.
The aim of this study was to identify the association
between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers comprehensively, and update the previous results of the overall association between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers.
Methods
Search strategy
The multiple systematic reviews and meta-analysis of
the available studies relying on the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISRMA) statement for the conduct of meta-analysis
of observational studies were performed [22]. The following cancers were included in this study: 1) Colon
neoplasm; 2) Cholangiocarcinoma; 3) Breast cancer; 4)
Gastric cancer; 5) Pancreatic cancers; 6) Prostate cancer;
7) Esophageal cancer. Separate meta-analyses were performed for colon neoplasms, cholangiocarcinoma, and
breast cancer. Relevant studies were identified by searching PUBMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane
Systematic Review Database for studies published between 1996 and January 2020. The following search
terms were used: Colon neoplasm, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric neoplasm, stomach neoplasm, gastric cancers, gastric cancer, pancreatic neoplasm,
pancreatic cancers, PDAC, PaC, esophageal neoplasm,
esophageal cancer, breast carcinoma, breast cancer,
breast neoplasm, breast tumor, breast malignant neoplasm, prostate neoplasms, prostate cancer. Only the observational studies (i.e., case-control studies and cohort
studies) and written in English language were considered
eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Studies were
excluded if they were only published as abstracts.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The initially retrieved publications were reviewed by two
investigators (Shou-Sheng Liu and Xue-Feng Ma) independently. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion
with all investigators. Studies were included if they meet
the criteria as follows: 1) studies explored the correlation
between NAFLD and related cancers; 2) NAFLD or
NASH was defined by either histopathological examination, imaging study or International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, Hepatic steatosis index; 3) extrahepatic cancers were also defined by either histopathological examination, imaging
study or ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes; 4) risk estimates (odds
ratios [ORs], hazard ratios [HRs] or incidence rate ratios
[IRRs]) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported or could be calculated from the
data provided; 5) studies were published full-text report
in English language. The following studies were excluded: abstracts, reviews, case reports, and letters. Studies that did not provide sufficient data to calculate the
risk estimates were also excluded.
Quality assessment
Quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two authors (Shousheng Liu and Xuefeng Ma)
according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [23].
The NOS is comprised of three sections: selection (up to
4 points), comparability (up to 2 points), and outcome
(up to 3 points). The maximum score is 9 points. Study
quality was classified as poor (score, 0–3), fair (score, 4–
Liu et al. Lipids in Health and Disease (2020) 19:118 Page 2 of 10

6), or good (score, 7–9). Discrepancies were resolved by
discussion with all investigators.
Data extraction
The following information was extracted from each
study: first author, publication year, country, number
of subjects, diagnosis method of NAFLD, source of
patients, dates of the study, study design, diagnosis
method for each cancer, adjusted confounding factors,
and study quality. The data were collected independently by two investigators (Shou-Sheng Liu and XueFeng Ma).
Data synthesis and analyses
Correlations between NAFLD and related cancers were
calculated by OR with corresponding 95% CI. In forest
plots, OR > 1 represented a risk effect, while OR < 1 represented a protective effect. Because the overall risk of
extrahepatic cancers is low, HRs and IRRs in the cohort
studies were similar to the ORs in the case-control studies mathematically. Thus, a combination of case-control
and cohort studies was appropriate. Statistical heterogeneity among the studies was assessed according to Q
and I
2 statistics. For the Q statistic, heterogeneity was
considered present when P < 0.1 or I
2 > 50%. A fixedeffect model was used when literature heterogeneity did
not exist; otherwise, a random-effect model was used.
Publication bias was evaluated visually with funnel plots.
Publication bias was considered significant when P <
0.05 in Begg’s test. Subgroup analyses were performed
according to the design of the study. Pooled ORs were
calculated by using STATA 13.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Literature search and study characteristics
A total of 3221 published studies were identified as potentially relevant from the databases searched. After removing animal studies, reviews, and nontopic studies,
1311 studies were retrieved for evaluation. After case reports, comments, non-English written articles, duplicates, and irrelevant resources were further removed,
131 studies remained for detailed evaluation. After excluding the studies which did not provide enough information of OR/HR/HRR, and those which without full
text, 26 studies were included for systematic review and
meta-analysis [21, 24–48] (Fig. 1). Among these selected
studies, some included two or more types of the following cancers: gastrointestinal (n = 15), cholangiocarcinoma (n = 7), breast (n = 4), gastric (n = 3), pancreatic
(n = 3), prostate (n = 3), and esophageal (n = 2).

Association between NAFLD and gastrointestinal cancer
Fifteen of the selected studies evaluated relationships between NAFLD and risk of gastrointestinal cancers (e.g.,
colorectal cancer and colorectal adenoma) (Table 1).
Among these studies, 7 were conducted in South Korea,
5 were conducted in China, 1 was conducted in Austria,
1 was conducted in Japan, and 1 was conducted in the
USA. All of these studies were observational and included 6 cohort studies and 9 cross-sectional studies.
According to NOS scores, 11 were high quality and 4
were fair quality (Table 2).
To investigate the association between NAFLD and
the risk of colorectal cancer, pooled OR of colorectal
cancer from ten studies was analyzed [21, 24–32]. A
meta-analysis was conducted with the random-effect
model (P < 0.01, I
2 = 83.5%). The results indicated that
patients with NAFLD have a significant risk of developing colorectal cancer (OR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.40–2.11)
(Fig. 2a). Publication bias was also tested by using Begg’s
test. The results suggested that an obvious publication
bias exists among these studies (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the results of a subgroup analysis showed that
the pooled OR of colorectal cancer in the cross-sectional
studies [25, 26, 28, 30, 31] was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.48–2.53),
and in the cohort studies [21, 24, 27, 29, 32] it was 1.52
(95% CI: 1.18–1.95) (Table 1, Fig. 2a).
To investigate the association of NAFLD and the risk
of colorectal adenoma, pooled OR of colorectal adenomas from nine studies was analyzed [28–36, 47]. A
meta-analysis was conducted with the random-effect effect model (P = 0.045, I
2 = 49.4%). The results indicated a
significant developmental risk of colorectal adenoma in
patients with NAFLD (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.29–1.46)
(Fig. 2b). When publication bias was tested, Begg’s test
indicated no obvious publication bias (P = 0.754) (Fig.
4b). Furthermore, the results of subgroup analysis
showed that the pooled OR of colorectal adenoma in the
cross-sectional studies [28, 30, 31, 34–36, 47] was 1.36
(95% CI: 1.28–1.45), and in the cohort studies [29, 33] it
was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.18–2.03) (Table 1, Fig. 2b). These
results suggest that patients with NAFLD have a higher
risk of developing colorectal cancer and colorectal adenoma than patients without NAFLD.
Association between NAFLD and cholangiocarcinoma
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, seven studies were included to evaluate relationships between
NAFLD and the risk of cholangiocarcinomas [including
intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC
and ECC, respectively)] [37–43]. Three of these studies
were conducted in the United States, 1 was conducted in
Europe, 1 was conducted in China, 1 was conducted in
Japan, and 1 was conducted in South Korea. All of these
studies were cross-sectional studies. In addition, patients
in four studies were from the community, while three
studies were from hospital. According to NOS scores, 4
studies were high quality and 3 studies were fair quality
(Table 3).
To investigate the association of NAFLD and the risk
of ICC, pooled OR of ICC from six studies was analyzed
[37–39, 41–43]. A meta-analysis was conducted with the
random-effects model (P = 0.003, I
2 = 72.60%). The results showed a significant risk of developing ICC in patients with NAFLD (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.77–3.44)
(Fig. 3a). In addition, according to Begg’s test, no obvious publication bias was observed among these studies
(P = 0.501) (Table 1, Fig. 4c). To investigate the association of NAFLD and the risk of ECC, pooled OR of ECC
from four studies was analyzed [37, 40, 41, 43]. A metaanalysis was conducted with the random-effect model
(P = 0.024, I
2 = 68.04%). The results showed that the risk
of developing ECC was significantly higher in patients
with NAFLD (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.58–3.17) than in patients without NAFLD (Table 1, Fig. 3b). These results

suggest that NAFLD may increase the risk of developing
ICC and ECC.
Association between NAFLD and breast cancer
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, four studies
were included to evaluate the relationship between NAFLD
and the risk of developing breast cancer [21, 24, 44, 45].
Among these studies, 2 were conducted in the United
States, 1 was conducted in Korea, and 1 was conducted in
Israel. Three of the studies were cohort studies, while the
remaining study was a case-control study. NOS scores indicated that all four studies were high quality (Table 3). Based
on the data in Table 1 and in Supplementary Fig. 1, the
pooled OR of breast cancer in patients with NAFLD was
1.69 (95% CI: 1.44–1.99), which suggests that patients with
NAFLD are more susceptible to breast cancer.
Associations between NAFLD and other cancers
Three of the included studies evaluated the association
between NAFLD and the risk of developing gastric cancer [21, 24, 27] (Supplementary Table 1). According to
NOS scores, all three of these cohort studies were of
high quality. The pooled OR of gastric cancer was 1.74
(95% CI: 1.03–2.95) (Table 1), which suggests that patients with NAFLD have a high risk of developing gastric
cancer. Similarly, to investigate a possible association between NAFLD and the risk of developing pancreatic
cancer, three studies were included [21, 24, 46] (Supplementary Table 1). All three cohort studies were of high
quality according to their NOS scores. The pooled OR
of pancreatic cancer was 2.12 (95% CI: 1.58–2.83) (Table
1), which suggests that patients with NAFLD have a high
risk of developing pancreatic cancer. In addition, it was
observed that patients with NAFLD have a high risk of
developing prostate cancer (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.03–
1.79) (Tables 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, two of the studies reported an association between
NAFLD and a risk of developing esophageal cancer [21,
24], with the OR value of esophageal cancer being 1.77
(95% CI: 1.19–2.62) (Tables 1 and Supplementary Table
1).
Discussion
NAFLD is an epidemic of chronic liver disease worldwide, and it is the manifestation of metabolic syndrome
in the liver [3]. Accumulating evidence suggest that
NAFLD is tightly associated with various diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease,
and cancer [11–13, 49, 50]. In recent years, more attentions have been paid to the possible association between
NAFLD and the risk of certain cancers. For example,
clinical observational studies have been conducted which
investigate the relationship between NAFLD and the
risks of developing cancer, especially extrahepatic cancers such as colon, stomach, and pancreas. Both Kim
et al. and Allen et al. have conducted reviews regarding
this issue [21, 24]. However, the results could not reflect
the newest conclusion of the association between
NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers absolutely. With the
publication of new studies, a latest summary is needed
to expound the new research progresses in ths issue.
Therefore, the newest systematic reviews and metaanalysis were conducted to investigate the association of
NAFLD with the risk of various extrahepatic cancers
comprehensively in this study.
In this study, the relationship of NAFLD with gastrointestinal cancers (colorectal cancer and colorectal adenoma), cholangiocarcinomas (ICC and ECC), and other

cancers (including breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate,
and esophageal) were investigated. The results obtained
suggest that NAFLD is tightly associated with all of these
extrahepatic cancers. However, detailed mechanism(s) to
explain how NAFLD promotes tumorigenesis remain
unclear. NAFLD is caused by excessive accumulation of
triglycerides in the liver, which could be regarded as a
type of visceral adiposity [51]. Previous reports have suggested that visceral adipose tissue may affect the function of other organs by releasing cytokines such as
adipocytokines, growth factors, and some proinflammatory factors [52]. This hypothesis, if confirmed,
could provide valuable insight into the mechanism of
NAFLD in tumorigenesis.
In a previous meta-analysis which investigated the association of incident and recurrent colorectal cancer and
adenoma with NAFLD, it was observed that the presence
and severity of NAFLD were associated with an increased risk of incident colorectal cancer or adenomas
[53]. When Mantovani et al. examined the association

between NAFLD and colorectal tumors in asymptomatic
adults who underwent a screening colonoscopy, they
found that NAFLD was associated with a moderate increase in the risk of colorectal cancer and adenoma [54].
In the present study, both inclusion and exclusion criteria were strictly adhered to, and all suitable studies
were included to investigate the association of NAFLD
with the risk of developing colorectal cancer and colorectal adenoma. The results show that NAFLD significantly increases the risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.72,
95% CI: 1.40–2.11) and the risk of colorectal adenoma
(OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.29–1.46) compared to healthy
controls. These results are consistent with those of previous studies, and they support further investigations of
the mechanism(s) by which NAFLD promotes the development of colorectal cancer and colorectal adenoma.
The associations between NAFLD and other extrahepatic cancers is less proven [55]. When Wongjarupong
et al. conducted a meta-analysis to investigate a possible
relationship between NAFLD and cholangiocarcinoma,
they found that NAFLD was associated with both ICC
(OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.52–3.24) and ECC (OR = 1.55, 95%
CI: 1.03–2.33) [19]. In this study, the most recent publications available were added to conduct this metaanalysis [21, 24–28, 31, 32, 41, 44–48]. The results obtained show that NAFLD significantly increases the risk
of developing both ICC (OR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.77–3.44)
and ECC (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.58–3.17). These results
are consistent with those of previous studies [19, 54].
Furthermore, links between NAFLD and breast, gastric,
pancreatic, prostate, and esophageal cancers were also
reviewed. Recently, Ahmed et al. reviewed the studies of
extrahepatic malignancies in NAFLD systematically, but
the detailed OR/HR/IRR of each cancer was not analyzed [50], therefore, this research made the well supplement and update for Ahmed’s study. Sorensen et al.
have reported that patients with NAFLD in the Danish
population exhibit an increased risk of lung cancer and
renal cell carcinoma [55]. Similarly, Watanabe et al. have
verified that NAFLD may be associated with more severe
renal cell carcinoma and shorter overall survival in
Japanese populations [56, 57]. However, relationships
between NAFLD and lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma remain to be further studied as available data are
currently insufficient. In addition, clinical studies are
needed to further investigate the association between
NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers. Kim et al. reported
that patients with NAFLD possess the higher susceptibility to colorectal cancer in males, and breast cancer in females [24], whether there is the gender-related
difference in the association of NAFLD and extrahepatic
cancers remains unclear. A recent study demonstrated
that patients with NAFLD are more likely to exhibit
chronic inflammation with insulin resistance, which may
generate a microenvironment conducive for cancer development [58, 59]. Emerging translational and epidemiologic data support that local ectopic fat may also affect
functional factors, and in turn the paracrine pathway, to
induce cancer development in the liver, pancreas, and
breast [60, 61]. Therefore, the results of the present
study are consistent with those of previous studies and
they indicate that NAFLD is a risk factor for various extrahepatic cancers.
Strength and study limitation
There were several limitations in this study. First, the
tight association between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers was investigated, but the degrees of NAFLD did not
be classified. Consequently, the association of NAFLD
severity with the extrahepatic cancers examined was not
demonstrated. Second, a small number of studies were
available to analyze the association between NAFLD and
the risks of gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and esophageal
cancers. Therefore, further studies are needed to focus
on the risk of these extrahepatic cancers in patients with
NAFLD. Third, many of the studies examined were conducted in East Asia. However, the ethnicity of the subjects in each study were not defined. Given that the risks
of developing NAFLD and various cancers differ according to ethnicity, the influence of ethnicity on the relationship between NAFLD and extrahepatic cancers
should be investigated in future studies.

Conclusion
In summary, the systematic review and meta-analysis
was conducted to comprehensively investigate associations between NAFLD and the risk of developing extrahepatic cancers. The results indicate that NAFLD can
significantly increase the risk of developing colorectal
cancer and colorectal adenoma, ICC and ECC, and
breast, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and esophageal cancers. However, the evidence for an association of
NAFLD with various extrahepatic cancers remains insufficient. In addition, mechanistic details regarding the
capacity for NAFLD to promote tumorigenesis remains
unclear. Both of these aspects are important to consider
in future studies.
