Abstract
Objectives: Glucose metabolism, perfusion, and water diffusion may have a relationship or affect each other in the same
tumor. The understanding of their relationship could expand the knowledge of tumor characteristics and contribute to the
field of oncologic imaging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationships between metabolism, vasculature
and cellularity of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), using multimodality imaging such as 18F-FDG positron emission
tomography (PET), dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI, and diffusion weighted imaging(DWI).
Materials and Methods: Twenty-one patients with advanced HCC underwent 18F-FDG PET, DCE-MRI, and DWI before
treatment. Maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax) from 18F-FDG-PET, variables of the volume transfer constant (Ktrans)
from DCE-MRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from DWI were obtained for the tumor and their relationships were
examined by Spearman’s correlation analysis. The influence of portal vein thrombosis on SUVmax and variables of Ktrans and
ADC was evaluated by Mann-Whitney test.
Results: SUVmax showed significant negative correlation with Ktransmax (r = 20.622, p = 0.002). However, variables of ADC
showed no relationship with variables of Ktrans or SUVmax (p.0.05). Whether portal vein thrombosis was present or not did
not influence the SUV max and variables of ADC and Ktrans (p.0.05).
Conclusion: In this study, SUV was shown to be correlated with Ktrans in advanced HCCs; the higher the glucose metabolism
a tumor had, the lower the perfusion it had, which might help in guiding target therapy.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common
cause of cancer-related death globally, behind only lung and
stomach cancer. Treatment options are limited for patients with
advanced HCC and potentially curative treatments can be
attempted in only 30–40% of patients. Conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy agents have not improved survival outcomes and
standard treatment for advanced HCC has yet to be established.
However, recently developed molecularly targeted agents offer
new options for treating this chemo-resistant tumor, and have
been reported to present survival benefits for advanced HCC
[1,2]. These molecular target agents are expensive and exert
moderate side effects, so it is important to predict optimal
candidates for this treatment. Because the therapeutic effects of
these molecular agents usually depend on the proliferative and
angiogenic activity of the tumor, it is important to understand
these characteristics.
During the early stage of hepatocarcinogenesis, arterial blood
supply increases as histologic grade progresses. However, tumor
metabolism and angiogenesis in advanced HCC have not been
well evaluated and could be different from those in early stage
HCC, as well as affect treatment responses to the target agent. 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) with positron emission
tomography (PET), diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI), and
dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) provide the information of glucose metabolism, cellularity, and vascularity of the
tumor [3]. Several studies have investigated the usefulness of
functional imaging parameters in the prediction of a response in
various tumors [4–9]. In previous studies regarding HCCs treated
with antiangiogenic agents, lower SUVmax groups showed
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71571

significantly longer overall survival than higher SUVmax groups
and the changes of Ktrans (a volume transfer constant) after
treatment were correlated with the response to the antiangiogenic
agent [5,6,8,9].
We hypothesized that glucose metabolism, perfusion, and water
diffusion may have a relationship or affect each other in the same
tumor. The understanding of the functional imaging markers
could expand the knowledge of tumor characteristics and allow for
their wider clinical application in the fields of oncologic imaging.
To our knowledge, however, no report has studied the relationships of the three parameters.
In this study, we investigated the relationships between tumor
metabolism determined by 18F-FDG PET, tumor vasculature
determined by DCE MRI, and tumor cellularity determined by
diffusion MRI in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC).

Patients
By searching a database of prospectively collected data, we
identified 26 patients with HCC who underwent PET-CT and
DCE with DWI MRI within an interval of one month. Patients
were excluded from the study if they underwent any treatment for
HCC before MRI and PET scanning (n = 5). Finally, 21 patients
(male: female, 17: 4; age range, 35–75 years; mean age, 56 years)
were enrolled. Patients were classified as having advanced HCC if
they were not eligible for surgical resection or locoregional
therapies (stage C) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC) staging system [10].
MR Protocol
All imaging studies were performed using a 3-T MR scanner
(MAGNETOM Tim Trio; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany) equipped with 8-channel body phased-array coils
(Siemens Healthcare). The patients were asked to fast four hours
before scanning. No antiperistaltic or oral contrast agents were
used.
Coronal and axial T2WI HASTE images (TR/TE = 500/
95 ms, number of slices = 20, thickness = 8 mm, field of
view = 320 mm, matrix = 2566256) were acquired for localization.
Free-breathing DWI was performed with a singleshot, echoplanar sequence with motion-probing gradients in 3 directions(TR/TE = 6017/69 ms, field of view = 3306440 mm, matrix = 1926108, flip angle = 90, slice thickness = 5 mm,
gap = 1 mm, number of slices = 30–40, number of excitation = 2,
b values = 50, 400, and 800 second/mm2
). After image acquisition,
ADCs were automatically calculated by the MR system and
displayed as corresponding ADC maps.
Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging included two precontrast T1 weighted measurements (3D VIBE, TR/TE = 4.9/
1.7 ms, field of view = 3006300 mm, matrix = 1926138, slice
thickeness = 4 mm, number of slices = 20) with different flip angles
(FAs) (2u, 15u) to determine the T1 relaxation time in the blood
and tissue before contrast agent arrival on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
This was followed by a dynamic contrast enhanced series using a
Time-resolved angiography with interleaved stochastic trajectories
sequence (TWIST, TR/TE = 4.5/1.7 ms, flip angle = 12u, temporal resolution = 0.295 s and all other parameters : same as
precontrast image) after injecting 15 ml of Omniscan (gadodiamide; GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) at 5 ml/sec using an
automatic injector, followed by a 30-ml saline injection. Serial
images were acquired under shallow free-breathing conditions.
FOV was focused on the center of tumor mass along the z axis.
Perfusion images were acquired repetitively over 75 cycles for 7–
8 min. On completion of the study, the data were transferred to an
image processing workstation (Leonardo, Siemens Medical Solutions).
PET Protocol
All patients fasted for more than six hrs before the procedure.
They then signed informed consent for the procedure and received
5.5 MBq/kg of body weight of 18F- FDG intravenously over
2 min. After a 45-min equilibration period during which the
patients were at rest, attenuation corrected emission images over
the tumor were acquired on a PET-CT scanner, Biograph
Truepoint 40 PET-CT (Siemens Medical Systems, CTI, Knoxville, TN, USA). Reconstructed attenuation corrected images were
viewed in the transaxial, coronal, and sagittal planes.
Image Analysis
A third year resident and a board certified abdominal
radiologist independently drew ROI (region of interest) on postprocessed quantitative maps for calculation of ADC, Ktrans and
SUV. Their averaged values between two readers were used for
further analysis. Detailed post processing methods are as follows;
ADC maps were co-registered to the last phase on DCE MRI
(7,8 minutes after contrast injection) using commercial software
(nordicICE, NordicNeuroLab), based on Digital Imaging and
Communication in Medicine geometry parameters (Figure 1).
Manual adjustment of image registration was performed if
necessary. ROI for ADC was drawn along the tumor border on
the same ROIs as co-registered Ktrans map. Maximum, minimum,
median, and mean values of ADC (ADCmax, ADCmin, ADCmedian
and ADCmean) for the covered tumor volume were calculated.
Tumors were distinctly differentiated from the normal parenchyma on this co-registered image.
Post-processing of Ktrans from all series of the DCE MRI was
performed with commercial software (tissue 4D, Siemens Medical
Solutions) based on a modified Tofts model. Motion correction
was performed on the dynamic images based on non-rigid
registration technique [11] and a T1 map was registered to the
dynamic images. After complete calculation of Ktrans, readers drew
ROI along the tumor borders based on the last phase of DCE.
Maximum, minimum, median and mean values of Ktrans
(Ktransmax, Ktransmin, Ktransmedian, and Ktransmean) for the covered
tumor volume were calculated. The presence or absence of portal
vein thrombosis was also recorded.
For SUV measurement, The 3D ROI was drawn to follow the
contours of the elevated FDG activity as compared to the normal
liver parenchyma. The maximal standardized uptake value (SUV)
was calculated with the following formula: SUV = Cdc/(di/w),
where Cdc was the decay-corrected tracer tissue concentration (in
Becquerel per gram), di was the injected dose (in Becquerel), and w
was the patient’s body weight (in grams). We defined SUVmax for
each patient as the maximum measured SUV of the most
hypermetabolic lesion.
Statistical Analysis
Interobserver variability for the ADC, Ktrans, and SUVmax
measurements between the two readers was analyzed by the

intraclass correlation coefficient. The relationships among the
matched quantitative imaging parameters (e.g., ADCmean -
Ktransmean) from PET, DWI and DCE MRI images were
examined by Spearman’s correlation analysis. In addition, the
Mann-Whitney test was used to evaluate the influence of portal
vein thrombosis on quantitative parameters of PET and MRI. A
P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed with Medcalc, version 9
(Medcalc Software, Belgium).
Results
The averaged values of all the quantitative parameters for 21
patients were summarized in the Table 1. Intraclass correlation
coefficients between two readers are 0.85 to 0.92, 0.82 to 0.95, and
0.99 for ADC, Ktrans and SUV, respectively. The correlation
between variables of ADC and Ktrans are summarized in Table 2.
There was no significant relationship between the corresponding
parameters.
The correlations between SUV max vs. Ktransmax and SUV max
vs. ADCmax are summarized in Table 3. SUVmax showed a
significant negative correlation with Ktransmax (r = 20.622,
p = 0.002). SUVmax showed no significant correlation with ADC
max (r= 0.369, p = 0.099). Whether portal vein thrombosis was
present or not did not influence any of the quantitative
parameters: SUV max (p = 0.756), ADCmin (p = 0.973), ADCmax
(p = 0.282), ADCmean (p = 0.251), ADCmedian (p = 0.349) and
Ktrans min (p = 0.223), Ktrans max (p = 0.918), Ktrans mean
(p = 0.756) and Ktransmedian (p = 0.863).
Discussion
Our study revealed a significant negative correlation between
SUV and Ktrans, indicating that advanced HCC with higher
glucose metabolism tends to have lower perfusion. On the
contrary, advanced HCC with lower glucose metabolism tends
to have higher perfusion. Regarding vascularity in advanced
HCC, our results were consistent with a previous study using
perfusion CT, which reported that the perfusion values in poorly
or moderately differentiated HCCs were lower than those in welldifferentiated HCCs [12,13]. These observations stand in contrast
to the conventional idea that the higher grade a tumor is, the
higher the vascularity it has. In the early stage of tumor
angiogenesis, tumor vascularity may keep step with tumor growth.
In the advanced stage, however, the growth of a tumor may leap
ahead of the growth of vascularity, resulting in hypoperfusion or
necrosis[14–17]. Low grade gliomas may have aerobic metabolic
pathway meanwhile high grade glioma may have anaerobic
metabolism [18]. Similarly, in early stages, HCCs may recruit
arterial flow and use aerobic metabolism, then switch to anaerobic
metabolism with less arterial supply at some point of moderately
differentiated [19]. Our negative correlation between glucose
metabolism and perfusion in advanced HCC may be explained on
the base of increased anaerobic metabolism in advanced HCC
[20]. Therefore, the target therapy in advanced HCC should be
focused on the anaerobic metabolism rather than angiogenesis or
vascularity. However, considering moderate correlation coefficient(r = 0.656,0.660), each parameter may have independent
domains that are not explained by the complex interplay between
perfusion and glucose metabolism. Moreover, these independent
domains might provide complementary information for therapy
planning and response monitoring. Future studies may shed new
light on these issues, as well as uncover detailed associations
between functional imaging parameters.
According to our study, variables of ADC in advanced HCC
showed no significant relationship with Ktrans or SUV, indicating
that diffusion is not correlated with perfusion or glucose
metabolism; however, in addition to cellularity, ADC value is
also influenced by necrosis or other factors.
Our study showed that the presence or absence of portal vein
thrombosis did not influence perfusion, cellularity, and glucose
metabolism in advanced HCCs. Our results were consistent with a
previous study using perfusion CT, which showed that perfusion
parameters were not different between patients with portal vein
thrombosis and those without [12]. This observation could be
explained by the hypothesis that HCCs are supplied by hepatic
arteries but not by portal veins [12]. Therefore, portal vein
thrombosis may not influence perfusion, cellularity and glucose
metabolism in advanced HCCs.
Our study has several shortcomings. Firstly, there was a
selection bias because only patients with advanced HCC were
included. Secondly, we compared DWI with DCE MRI with
different slice thickness and gap. There might be missing
information of DWI to match with DCE. However, we used
interpolation and co-registration method to overcome mismatches
[21,22]. Thirdly, we did not perform pathologic examination.
Detailed associations between functional imaging parameters
should be supported by pathologic examination in future studies.
In this study, SUV was shown to be correlated with Ktrans in
advanced HCCs; the higher the glucose metabolism a tumor had,
the lower the perfusion it had, which might help in guiding target
therapy.
