Abstract
Background: The human gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by a very diverse symbiotic microbiota, the composition of
which depends on host genetics and the environment. Several studies suggested that the host genetics may influence the
composition of gut microbiota but no genes involved in host control were proposed. We investigated the effects of the wild
type and mutated alleles of the gene, which encodes the protein called pyrin, one of the regulators of innate immunity, on
the composition of gut commensal bacteria. Mutations in MEFV lead to the autoinflammatory disorder, familial
Mediterranean fever (FMF, MIM249100), which is characterized by recurrent self-resolving attacks of fever and polyserositis,
with no clinical signs of disease in remission.
Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 19 FMF patients and eight healthy individuals were genotyped for mutations in
the MEFV gene and gut bacterial diversity was assessed by sequencing 16S rRNA gene libraries and FISH analysis. These
analyses demonstrated significant changes in bacterial community structure in FMF characterized by depletion of total
numbers of bacteria, loss of diversity, and major shifts in bacterial populations within the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and
Proteobacteria phyla in attack. In remission with no clinical signs of disease, bacterial diversity values were comparable with
control but still, the bacterial composition was substantially deviant from the norm. Discriminant function analyses of gut
bacterial diversity revealed highly specific, well-separated and distinct grouping, which depended on the allele carrier status
of the host.
Conclusions/Significance: This is the first report that clearly establishes the link between the host genotype and the
corresponding shifts in the gut microbiota (the latter confirmed by two independent techniques). It suggests that the host
genetics is a key factor in host-microbe interaction determining a specific profile of commensal microbiota in the human gut.

Introduction
The human gut microbiota has been shaped by the long coevolutionary history of symbiotic host-microbe interaction [1] and
has evolved to play an important role in maintaining human
health by preventing colonization by pathogens, degrading dietary
and in situ-produced compounds, producing nutrients, and shaping
and maintaining the normal mucosal immunity [2–4]. Recently,
other important functions of commensal microbiota became
apparent including an anti-inflammatory effect on gut epithelium
[5,6], the influence on lipid metabolism of the host [7] and
association with obesity [8,9] as well as the involvement in
intestinal homeostasis, repair and angiogenesis [10,11].
Recently, the intricate molecular mechanisms behind this hostmicrobe cross-talk began to emerge. The innate immune system of
the mammalian host senses bacteria through an impressive array
of receptors, called Toll-like (TLR) and Nod-like (NLR) (also
called CATERPILLER, NOD-LRR, and NACHT-LRR) receptors. The first mammalian TLR was discovered a decade ago [12]
and the functionality of the first NLRs (then called NODs) as
sensors of bacterial ligands was established in 2001 [13]. TLRs are
predominantly but not exclusively located in the transmembrane
region of host cells, while NLR proteins are mostly located in the
cytoplasm [14]. Both groups of receptors contain leucine-rich
repeats (LRR), which are involved in detection of danger signals
and, in particular, of whole bacteria and bacterial products
through the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns
(PAMP). PAMP signalling through the innate immunity receptors
appeared to be important not only for the recognition of, and
launching defences against, the invading pathogens but also for the
maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis and for protection
against gut injury and associated mortality [11]. Bacterial products
are also crucial for the normal immune system development; for
example, a single bacterial polysaccharide (PSA) from a commensal bacterium Bacteroides fragilis was shown is capable of directing
the complete cellular and physical maturation of the developing

immune system [15]. In murine experimental colitis models,
signalling by probiotic bacterial DNA ligands through TLR9
exerted a strong anti-inflammatory effect [16] while signalling
through TLR2 seems important for regulation of mucosal
inflammation and maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier
integrity [17,18].
Another type of regulation of the host metabolism by microbes
can be through the low molecular weight bacterial metabolites
such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and, in particular, butyrate.
Butyrate is the preferred energy source for the colonic epithelium
and may play an important role in colonic health and prevention
of colorectal cancer and colitis [19–21].
Because of limitations imposed by the extreme diversity of
microbiota in the conventional gut, which does not allow
monitoring the behaviour of a single bacterium, much less is known
of how the bacterial counterpart responds to the host-generated
molecular signals. Initially, the bacterial response was considered to
be limited to various strategies used by gut bacteria to forage the
endogenously produced substrates of the host [22,23]. Interestingly,
however, one of the aspects of this interaction, namely the specific
fucosylation, seems important for both sides involved in the hostbacterial dialogue. On one side, the intestinal bacteria induce mucin
fucosylation in the gut epithelium thus creating a specific nutritional
econiche [22,24]. On the other side, fucosylation of the cell surface
in a mammalian-like fashion appeared to be essential for the gut
bacteria to establish the successful mutualistic relationship with the
host. The lack of this property may result in the failure of bacteria to
colonize the mammalian intestine [25]. Yet another ‘‘language’’ of
host-bacterial communication could be through the quorum sensing
(QS), which utilizes hormone-like compounds and, in E. coli, has
been implicated in a potential cross-communication between the
luxS/AI-3 bacterial QS system and the epinephrine host signalling
system [26]. Bacteria may also sense the immune status of the host
and respond by the expression of a quorum-sensing dependent
virulence determinant [27]. These two examples of quorumsensing-mediated signalling between the host and bacteria are
taken from the pathogenic bacteria but it cannot be excluded that
this type of communication is common among gut symbiotic
bacteria as well.
What happens if this fine-tuned molecular cross-talk is
compromised and the host fails to recognize bacterial components
as, for example, in the case of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
such as Crohn’s disease (CD)? In a subset of CD patients,
mutations in the NOD2/CARD15 protein have been associated
with susceptibility to the disease [28,29]. Bacterial ligand for this
receptor has been recently identified as bacterial muramyl
dipeptide [30,31] and failure to recognise this ligand in CD
patients leads to the breach of tolerance and to the launch of an
aggressive Th1-skewed response against the antigens of normal
diet and commensal bacteria as well as to production of
autoantibodies [32–34]. The microbiota of these patients demonstrates diminished diversity, in particular, due to the depletion of
bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla [35,36].
Interestingly, the loss of the transcription factor T-bet, which
regulates the innate immune system, influences bacterial populations in the murine gut in a way that they become colitogenic and
this colitis is communicable to genetically intact hosts [37].
Presently, it is not clear how the composition of the normal
microbiota is restructured to become a ‘‘pathobiota’’ but,
nevertheless, this is the first experimental proof of the view that
the community as a whole may demonstrate pathogenic
properties, not a single pathogenic bacterium.
In our study, we investigated the effect of mutations in a single
gene of the host on commensal gut microbiota. The gene under
investigation, MEFV (for MEditerranean FeVer), encodes a
protein called pyrin/marenostrin, which is involved in regulation
of innate immunity [38]. Structurally, this 781-residue protein
consists of a 92-amino acid N-terminal PYRIN (PYD) domain, a
B-box zinc finger, a coiled-coil region and a ,200-amino acid Cterminal B30.2/rfp/SPRY domain [39]. Mutations in this gene
lead to an autoinflammatory disorder, familial Mediterranean
fever (FMF, MIM249100), which is characterised by short
recurrent self-resolving attacks of fever and polyserositis, with no
clinical signs of disease in remission periods. The carrier rate and
occurrence of disease is high in populations originating from the
Mediterranean basin, including Sephardic Jews, Armenians,
Arabs, and Turks. Articles describing positional cloning of the
gene by two independent consortia appeared in 1997 [40,41] and
to date 166 MEFV mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) are detected in the gene (http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/infevers).
The hotspot of MEFV mutations is localized in exon 10, which
encodes the B30.2/rfp/SPRY domain, and this single locus
inheritance greatly facilitated our analysis of host genetics in
comparison with other disorders with more complex genetics.
Genome-wide scans for IBD susceptibility, for example, have
resulted in identification of seven loci that are confirmed and
replicated in several studies, but with many more that need
independent confirmation and verification [42].
The present work is the first attempt to analyze simultaneously
the genetics of both sides involved in the host-gut microbiota
relationship. All study participants were analyzed for MEFV
mutations and the composition of gut microbiomes was assessed
by two culture-independent techniques, fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) and 16S rDNA gene library analyses. For
the first time, our findings conclusively establish the key role of the
host genotype in host-microbe interaction, which determines a
highly specific composition of commensal microbiota in the
human gut.
Results
MEFV Genotyping
Nineteen FMF patients with clinically confirmed disease and
eight healthy individuals were subjected to genotyping (Table 1).
We performed genotyping of the exon regions of the MEFV gene,
which is thought to be a single genetic determinant of FMF, in
particular exons 2 and 10, where the majority of disease-associated
mutations were identified (http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/infevers). FMFassociated mutations were found in all FMF patients displaying the
clinical signs of the disease, as well as in one healthy Armenian
control subject (in a simple heterozygous state) without diseaserelated symptoms (Table 1). All mutations were located in exon 10,
only synonymous substitutions were detected in exon 2, irrespectively of the health status. The majority of mutations in FMF
patients were M694V, which were present in the compounded
form with other disease alleles in eight patients and in a simple
heterozygous form in six patients. In the latter group, no other
disease-related mutations in exon 2, except neutral SNPs, were
detected. Homozygotes were represented exclusively by the M680I
mutation (Table 1). Interestingly, the SNPs in the control group
were all in the heterozygous state, while the homozygous forms
were encountered only among FMF patients.
Phylogenetic and comparative analysis of 16S libraries
Three 16S rDNA libraries from the fecal samples of healthy
controls as well as of FMF patients in remission and disease attack
were generated (designated as S, SR and SA in Table 1). After the
quality control a total of 1328 validated sequences (572 for healthy
Host Genetics and Microbiota

controls, 629 for FMF remission and 127 for FMF attack) were
analyzed and phylogenetic analysis was performed to establish
taxonomic positioning of sequences obtained (Table 2). Among
1328 clones analyzed, there were 268 distinct OTUs and the vast
majority (95.95%) fell into the two major phyla, Bacteroidetes with
99 OTUs (38.15%) and 714 sequences (53.76%) and Firmicutes
with 158 OTUs (57.8%) and 580 sequences (43.67%). Proteobacteria
were represented by 9 OTUs (3.47%) and 30 sequences (2.26%).
Only four Actinobacteria sequences (2 OTUs) were detected, which
were all derived from one FMF patient in remission.
In all three libraries, bacteria belonging to the Bacteroidetes
phylum were the most abundant, containing more than the half of
the sequences in each library (from 50.72% to 56.64%) but a
relatively smaller proportion of OTUs (from 35.19% to 40.91%),
whereas the Firmicutes phylum had the larger proportion of
phylotypes (from 55.30% to 60.49%) with the less copious
sequence numbers (from 41.43% to 45.95%) (Table 2). At the
phylum level, the relative proportions of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes
were not significantly different among the three libraries, however,
pairwise comparisons of each 16S rDNA library to every other
library by using the online library compare tool at RDP-II (Naive
Bayesian rRNA Classifier) revealed significant differences within
the lower taxa levels (Table 3). In particular, in asymptomatic
FMF patients in remission, the proportion of Enterobacteriaceae,
Acidaminococcaceae, Ruminococcus and Megasphaera was significantly
increased in comparison with control subjects, while Roseburia was
significantly reduced (Table 3). In the active disease, the
proportion of Prevotellaceae, Dialister and Prevotella was significantly
lower than in healthy controls while the Porphyromonadaceae,
Phascolarctobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Parabacteroides were significantly increased (Table 3). Interestingly, there were also

differences due to the disease state (remission or attack) and the
affected bacterial groups were Acidaminococcaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Megasphaera, Dialister, Faecalibacterium, and Parabacteroides
(Table 3).
Community analysis of 16S rDNA libraries
The estimates of diversity, richness, evenness and library
coverage for the three 16S rDNA clone libraries studied are
shown in Table 4. At the phylotype level, the most diverse gut
bacterial community was observed in FMF patients in remission.
The slightly lower indices were found for the healthy microbiota,
while the bacterial diversity during disease attacks was consistently
lower. The similar trend was observed for another community
parameter, species richness, which was the highest in the gut of
FMF patients in remission and in healthy volunteers but much
lower during disease attacks. On the contrary, evenness index,
which describes how evenly the individual sequences are
represented in phylotypes, was the highest in the disease attack
community (Table 4). Good’s coverage was 89.35–90.73% for the
sequence sets from FMF patients in remission and healthy controls
but only 77.2% for sequences from FMF patients in attack
reflecting the lower number of subjects and sequences collected.
Rarefaction analysis of clone libraries essentially confirmed
these findings and suggested that FMF patients in remission
possess the most diverse gut bacterial community, which is even
higher than in healthy subjects (Fig. 1). Because of limited number
of sequences in the clone library from the acute disease, we
extrapolated the curve using an empiric regression function (for
details, see the footnote to Fig. 1). The extrapolated curve
confirmed the initial findings suggesting diminished diversity of gut
bacteria in FMF attack in comparison with disease remission and
control.
Collector’s curves of the observed and estimated phylotype
richness are shown in Fig. 2. In healthy subjects, both estimates,
Chao1 and abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE), were
highly similar and, up to the point of collection of ca. 320 clones,
were in a steady and congruent increase together with the
observed phylotype number (Fig. 2A). In this sampling area,
almost any new clone sequence added represented a novel
phylotype. Adding new sequences after this point, however, led
to the gap expansion between the estimated and observed
phylotype numbers suggesting repeated sampling of the phylotypes
already present in the sample. In FMF remission, the gap between
the observed and estimated phylotype richness was constant after
the sampling point of 290 clones (Fig. 2B). Confirmatory to the
previous analyses, the phylotype number estimates at the sampling
point with 500 clones gave the higher numbers of phylotypes in
FMF remission than in the norm (220 vs. 160). The difference
between the estimates and observed phylotype richness is highest
in acute FMF possibly reflecting the insufficient coverage in this
group (77.2%).
FISH analysis
Twelve Cy3-labelled oligonucleotide probes that target the total
and specific predominant groups of human gut bacteria were used
in this study to enumerate bacteria in the feces of FMF patients
and healthy controls (for details, see Materials and Methods).
Hybridization signals were detected for all bacterial groups,
indicating their presence as dominant microbiota in all fecal
samples analyzed.
FISH analysis revealed that the composition of fecal bacteria in
FMF patients in both inactive and active phases of the disease is
different from that of the healthy controls. The results of
enumeration of bacterial cells in each group and their relative
proportions versus the universal bacterial probe Eub338 are
summarized in Table 5. All fecal samples were processed exactly in
the same way and the count of cells hybridized with Eub338 can
be calculated to give the absolute numbers of bacteria per gram of
feces. No significant difference in concentration of total fecal
bacteria was found between the healthy controls and FMF patients
in remission, the mean values 5.4761010/g and 5.1261010/g,
respectively (Table 5). In the acute stage of the disease, however,
the concentration of bacteria in fecal material was substantially
lower, at 3.5661010/g.
Among the taxonomic groups tested, the highest proportion was
detected with the Bac303 probe, which targets the Bacteroides
group. It gave the concentration of these bacteria at 1.5161010/g
(27.3% of total bacteria) in healthy controls, with elevation in FMF
patients to 1.8661010/g (39.1%) in remission and to 1.3561010/g
(38.6%) in the attack period (Table 5). Cluster XIVa bacteria
(Clostridium coccoides group) was the second most abundant group
enumerated with the Erec482 probe comprising 1.0961010/g
(21.1%) in the healthy controls and approximately 1.0161010/g in
both, FMF remission and attack phases (18% and 28.9% of total
bacteria, respectively). The E. rectale-Roseburia probe Rrec584,

with Erec482), detected 6.5%, 8.3% and 18.0% within the total
bacteria probe, Eub338, and 41.5%, 43.8% and 59.8% within the
Erec482 probe in healthy controls, FMF remission and FMF
attacks, respectively. There were significant populations of
Fecalibacterium prausnitzii related bacteria (Fprau645), the second
important group of butyrate producers within clostridial cluster
IV, in all studied groups, with the tendency to increase in acute
FMF. These bacteria comprised 0.5461010/g (11.3%) in healthy
controls, 0.561010/g (10.4%) in FMF remissions, and 0.5361010/
g (13.8%) in acute stage of FMF. Another group within clostridial
cluster IV, ruminococci, which was detected with the combination
of probes Rfla729 and Rbro730, demonstrated lower levels in
FMF patients, especially in the acute phase of the disease,
compared to healthy controls. In particular, the members of the R.
flavefaciens/R. bromii group accounted for 0.5961010/g (9.9%) in
healthy controls, 0.2961010/g (5.3%) in FMF remissions, and
0.0961010/g (2.6%) in acute FMF. Similarly, clostridial cluster IX
representatives, detected with the probe Prop853, were estimated
to be at 0.6461010/g (11%) in healthy group, whereas in FMF
remission these bacteria were reduced to 0.4461010/g (7.1%),
with even more significant reduction in the acute stage of FMF,
accounting for 0.1361010/g (3.5%). Atopobium group also tended to
be less represented in gut microflora of FMF patients compared
with healthy subjects, steadily decreasing from 0.4261010/g
(7.8%) in healthy controls to 0.2961010/g (6.3%) in remission
and 0.1761010/g (4.5%) in attack. Members of the Bifidobacterium,
Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus-Enterococcus groups, which were
detected by the probes Bif164, EnterobacD and Lab158,
respectively, did not reveal significant differences between the
studied groups because they were found in low numbers and
demonstrated high inter-individual variability (Table 5).
We also attempted to evaluate the difference in gut microbiota
composition in remission and attack periods of disease in the
‘‘pure’’ form, when the genetic, phenotypic and environmental
variables are removed from the analysis. For this, we monitored
the intra-individual shifts in total and main gut bacterial
populations during the remission and attack phases of the disease
in two patients and these observations confirmed and reinforced
the tendencies found between the larger combined cohorts of FMF
sufferers in the remission and acute stages (Table 6). First, the total
numbers of bacteria in the gut enumerated with the Eub338 probe
decreased about two-fold. Second, in a number of bacterial
groups, the tendencies detected earlier became more profound and
statistically significant. In particular, these changes included a
dramatic increase in concentration of cluster XIVa bacteria and
particularly of E. rectale-Roseburia cluster during the acute phase of
the disease, with the reduction in concentration of cluster IX
bacteria and ruminococci. The fall of proportion of populations of
lactic acid bacteria enumerated with the Bif164 and Lab158
probes during the disease attack was significant in one patient,
FMF 13-123, while in the other, FMF 87, the differences in this
group were not significant. Thus, the monitoring of intraindividual bacterial shifts during the remission and attack phases
validated and confirmed the findings involving the larger cohorts
(Tables 5 and 6).
The part of FMF patients was undergoing colchicine therapy
and we compared the composition of gut bacteria in respect to this
treatment (Table 7). There was no difference in acute disease but
in remission a certain tendency to normalization was observed in
the Bacteroides group and in clostridial cluster IX bacteria.
Nevertheless, these differences were not statistically significant
and the data sets of colchicine-treated and untreated patients were
combined together for the microbiota analyses.

populations in the gut of the three cohorts were performed using the

proportion of cluster XIVa bacteria was only increased in the acute
phase of the disease in comparison with the control group and
remission (Fig. 3A). The fraction of E. rectale-Roseburia cluster among
total bacteria was substantially increased, especially in active disease
(Fig. 3B), while bacteria of cluster IX and Atopobium decreased in the
attack phase of the disease in comparison with controls and
remission (Fig. 3C). The proportion of ruminococci was significantly
lower in FMF patients (Fig. 3D), while no significant differences
were detected among F. prausnitzii, bifidobacteria, lactic acid
bacteria, and enterobacteria (Fig. 3B, 3D and 3E).

Discriminant function analysis (DA) is a powerful tool to extract
specific patterns in multiple datasets and we used this approach to
analyze the specific gut microbiota distribution patterns in our
three cohorts. The summary of discriminant function analysis with
20 subjects and 10 variables is shown in Fig. 4. It revealed three
clusters in bacterial distribution that are highly specific, well
separated and distinct for healthy controls, FMF remission, and
FMF attack. As shown in Table 8, the total percentage of correct
classification was 95%, thus 95% of total subjects were classified
into the correct groups (100% in healthy controls, 83.3% in
remission and 100% in attack). The validity of the variables in
differentiating the groups was supported by the Wilks’s lambda
coefficient, which may vary from 0 to 1 (the smaller the lambda,
the more the variable differentiates the groups), and in this case it
had a value of 0.045. The F-test of Wilks’s lambda, which is used
to test if the discriminant model as a whole is significant, produced
(20,16) = 2.95; p,0.016. There was only one case of misclassification from a total of 20 when the remission stage was assessed as
acute. This patient refused the colchicine therapy and was
suffering from very frequent FMF attacks and there is a possibility
that at the time of sampling the microbiota was not restructured
back to the composition specific for the remission stage. Thus the

model displayed good predictive accuracy and suggested the
specific patterns of gut microbiota distribution in the healthy and
diseased states.
Discussion
This is the first work reporting the specific changes in the
human gut microbiota due to the mutations in a single gene of the
host. Suggestions that the composition of gut microbiota is host
genotype-dependant have been proposed earlier [43,44], however,
these works were based on twin studies and the host genotype was
not assessed. Gut inflammatory diseases such as IBD have been
long known as having a substantial genetic predisposition
component and a recent review of genome-wide scans reported
on the seven confirmed and replicated cases of genetic
susceptibility loci, with many more, however, that need independent confirmation and verification [42]. Although the gut
microbiota of IBD patients was subjected to several diversity
analyses [35,36,45], the host genetics was not assessed, most
probably because of complicated genetics of IBD. Thus,
uncovering the genetic mechanisms that are involved in regulation
of composition of human gut microbiota remains a challenging
task. Evidence obtained in a study of bacterium-derived cellular
fatty acids in the stool samples of six mouse strains congenic for the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) suggested the importance of host immune system in this process [46]. The obvious
advantage of our model is that the genetics of FMF is well defined
and confined to a single gene thus facilitating the host genotype
analysis. Thus, for the first time, we had the opportunity for direct
comparison of the host and gut community genotypes.
Initially, we genotyped the FMF patients and healthy controls
for the presence of disease-specific mutations in exons 2 and 10 of
the MEFV gene. In all clinically confirmed cases we were able to
detect the presence of known mutations, all of them in exon 10,
which encodes the SPRY/B30.2 domain. Among our very limited
cohort of seven healthy controls of Armenian origin, one
heterozygote was detected, suggesting that the mutation carrier
rate in this population is at least 14%, which is within the range of
carrier rates found in populations of other ethnic origin [47–50].
The high carrier frequency in affected populations suggests the
selective advantage conferred by the heterozygous state but no
perceptible biological advantage of the carrier state is presently
identified [49]. Positive selection to maintain the high frequency of
the heterozygotes should also overcome the negative selection
imposed by the increased morbidity and mortality rates among the
homozygotes and compounded heterozygotes. Clinical manifestations during the disease attack are consistent with a strong
inflammatory response, with fever, massive influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the affected tissues, neutrophilia, and
acute-phase response. In some patients this leads to systemic
amyloidosis resulting in renal failure and death.
The penetrance of mutations that are all missense mutations,
varied widely. Apart from the combined heterozygotes, which
support the recessive nature of mutations, there were also simple
heterozygotes but with different phenotypes. The simple heterozygosity in clinically confirmed disease was exclusively exemplified
by a M694V mutation and, similarly to another study [51],
suggested the autosomal dominant inheritance probably due to the
importance of this residue in the interaction of pyrin with caspase1 [52]. On the other end of the mutation spectrum is the simple
M680I heterozygosity found in one of the healthy volunteers, C6b,
which did not result in any clinical or subclinical (cytokine profile)
FMF manifestation. Thus, depending on the locus involved, the
outcome could be either an asymptomatic carrier state or a fullblown disease. In the case of M694V mutation, a 50%
complementation by the normal allele may be not sufficient to
provide the protection against clinical manifestations of the
disease. This is the most abundant mutation in our FMF cohort
and is present in 70% of the patients. Taking into the
consideration the high penetrance and associated fitness cost of
carrying this allele even in the heterozygous form it seems
counterintuitive to suggest that it may confer any selective
advantage in the heterozygous carrier state under the present
day living conditions. Phenotypically, the asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of FMF mutations are characterized by the elevated

levels of markers of inflammation such as CRP, SAA, and INF-c
[53,54] and by specific glycosylation of AGP [55]. Whether this
subclinical inflammation in asymptomatic patients may be
protective against specific pathogens, probably endemic for the
Mediterranean basin, remains to be seen since the previous studies
failed to identify such agents [49].
In a parallel study, we measured the levels of systemic markers
of inflammation in acute phase and remission of FMF [56]. The
study confirmed earlier observations that even in remission, where
the clinical signs of disease are absent, the level of certain markers
of inflammation remains elevated suggesting chronic subclinical
inflammation in FMF. How this inflammation may affect the gut
microbiota? To answer this question, we used two independent
techniques to assess gut molecular bacterial diversity in health and
disease, the sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene libraries and
FISH. Both these techniques have their own advantages and
disadvantages but in combination they are complementary and
allow obtaining a more balanced overview of gut microbiota. In
particular, 16S libraries may suffer from PCR biases introduced by
elevated number of cycles [57] or poor amplification of certain
templates [58] while FISH analysis is less sensitive since it targets
higher taxonomic entities and no community analysis involving
individuals and species/phylotypes, unless they very are numerous,
is possible. On the other hand, FISH technique consistently
detects higher levels of Bifidobacteria than clone library sequencing,
it is less expensive and can be easily automated in conjunction with
flow cytometry or computer-aided automatic count under the
microscope for analysis of large cohorts. In order to minimize
inter-individual variations, 16S rRNA gene libraries were
constructed from fecal samples of 12 FMF patients in remission,
three patients in the acute stage of FMF, six healthy Armenians,
and one healthy subject of non-Armenian origin. The number of
amplification cycles was maintained low (10 cycles) to prevent a
potential PCR bias.
Both analyses of gut microbiota produced the similar results in
terms of general distribution of major phyla representatives in the
human gut. Similarly to the previous studies [8,36,59] the vast
majority of bacterial sequences and cells hybridized to specific
probes in the gut fell into the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla. The
Bacteroidetes contained the largest number of sequences but fewer
phylotypes while the diverse Firmicutes were dominant in terms of
the numbers and the relative proportion of phylotypes detected.
The Bacteroidetes was also the largest group detected by the Bac303
probe accounting for 27–39% of the total bacterial count, which is
lower than the clone library estimates. On the contrary, the
combination of various FISH probes targeting the Firmicutes
produced a higher estimate of bacteria belonging to this phylum
than the clone libraries. The most profound difference between the
two techniques in detection of bacteria in the human gut, however,
concerned the enumeration of high G+C Gram-positive bacteria
such as Atopobium spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.: FISH technique
consistently detected a sizable population of these genera in the gut
while they were hardly represented in PCR-generated libraries.
Taking into the consideration an important role played by, for
example, Bifidobacteria in maintaining the gastrointestinal health,
consistent underestimates of these bacteria in clone library
analyses may obscure the effect of this group in various gut
diseases such as IBD as well as in the healthy gut.
Examination of gut bacterial diversity in healthy and diseased
cohorts by the two methods arrived essentially at the same
conclusion suggesting the specific shifts in composition of bacteria
imposed by mutations in the MEFV gene of the host. The gut
microbiota in active disease was characterized by diminished
bacterial diversity and major population restructuring within the
phyla. In particular, the proportion of phylotypes belonging to of
Porphyromonadaceae, Phascolarctobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Parabacteroides were significantly increased while Prevotellaceae, Dialister
and Prevotella were significantly lower in acute disease in
comparison with control. Both approaches detected the fall in
proportion of clostridial cluster IX in FMF attack: FISH
demonstrated it for the whole group, while the sequence libraries
elaborated this general trend as involving Acidaminococcaceae,
Megasphaera, and Dialister. Evenness values for microbiota in active
disease were higher reflecting the lower number of dominant
phylotypes, although this could be a consequence of the smaller
number of sequences collected. Also, in a parallel FISH approach,
the fall in absolute numbers of bacteria during the inflammation
attacks was detected. In most cases, this analysis is less sensitive
than sequencing because it targets the larger taxonomic entities
such as, for example, the whole Bacteroides group and cannot detect
the differences at the lower taxa levels, e.g., in the Prevotellaceae and
Porphyromonadaceae families and the Prevotella and Parabacteroides
genera while sequence analysis operating at the individual

sequence level is capable to do. In some cases, however, the
situation may be opposite: Rfla729/Rbro730 FISH probe, for
example, detects a subset of ruminococci, which is significantly
reduced in attack (Table 5), while at the genus level the differences
are not significant (Table 3). Thus, FISH served as a complementary tool and allowed analyzing bacterial populations that are
routinely underestimated in sequence analyses. In particular,
FISH detected the fall in absolute numbers of high G+C bacteria
such as Bifidobacterium and Atopobium, which are not represented
well in our and others SSU rRNA clone libraries [59]. Thus, in
disease attack, the drop of total bacterial count and restructuring
of bacterial composition in the gut may be the consequence of
acute inflammation, which is accompanied by fever and influx of
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) into the affected areas
including peritoneum. Elevated body temperatures (up to 40uC)
and the localized respiratory burst of PMNs producing reactive
oxygen species could be responsible for gut microbiota selection.
As mentioned earlier, despite the absence of any clinical signs of
disease in remission, certain systemic markers of inflammation are
still elevated suggesting subclinical chronic inflammation [56].
Interestingly, the diversity values in remission were higher than in
the healthy gut suggesting that the low-level subclinical inflammation in FMF may favour a greater diversity of intestinal
bacteria. DA analysis of FISH data also confirmed the specific
composition of bacterial populations in remission, which is
different from control and forms a separate cluster. An additional
internal control subject of different ethnic background was
included in our study and the classification of the subject was
consistently in the healthy group. The specific shifts of bacterial
composition were also confirmed in two patients that were
investigated during the remission and attack periods to exclude the
influence of other genetic or environmental factors and these
analyses confirmed the specific bacterial composition shifts due to
disease state such as the increase of butyrate producers and the fall
of clostridial cluster IX bacteria during disease attacks. While these
shifts in attack may be explained by factors such as acute
inflammation, with fever and PMN infiltration, the factors that
govern the specific bacterial shifts in remission, which is free of
disease symptoms, are harder to suggest. Nevertheless, our DA
model consistently classified the patients in remission as a separate
group, which suggests the specific patterns of gut microbiota in this
cohort.
Thus the question is: what are the molecular mechanisms
responsible for these microbiota shifts imposed by the mutated
version of pyrin? In a broad sense, the functional role of this
protein is the regulation of innate immunity [38]. The protein is
expressed in granulocytes, activated monocytes, and serosal and
synovial fibroblasts [60–62]. Recently it becomes evident that the
regulatory functions of pyrin are carried out through the
interaction of two domains of the protein, PYRIN and B30.2/
rfp/SPRY, with the proinflammatory caspase-1 activating complex, called the inflammasome. The N-terminal PYRIN domain of
the protein binds and competes for ASC (apoptosis-associated
speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain), an
inflammasome component, thereby decreasing its availability for
the cryopyrin/NALP3/CIAS1 inflammasome. This results in
reduction of caspase-1 activation and pro-interleukin-1beta
processing and secretion thus halting the inflammatory response
[63]. The mutational hotspot in FMF, however, is located in the
C-terminal B30.2/rfp/SPRY domain, which modulates the
inflammatory response through the interaction with several
components of the inflammasome. In addition to interaction with
cryopyrin/NALP3/CIAS1, it interacts directly with caspase-1 and
its substrate pro-IL-1b [52,64]. The net effect of these interactions
is the suppression of IL-1b activation and block of inflammation. It
was suggested that the heightened IL-1b responsiveness could be a
factor selecting for mutations in the MEFV gene [52]. Taking into
consideration the overall role of pyrin as a modulator/suppressor
of the inflammatory response, another factor contributing to the
autoinflammatory nature of the disease could be the reduced
MEFV messenger RNA expression in patients with familial
Mediterranean fever [65]. First, it may contribute to the lower
titre of pyrin and its PYRIN domain molecules in the cell thus
making more ASC molecules available to initiate caspase-1
activation. Second, the reduced concentration of pyrin and
therefore of its B30.2/rfp/SPRY domain, which, in addition, is
mutated to the loss of caspase-1 suppressor function in most of
FMF cases, may provoke easier triggering the inflammation
cascade through caspase-1 activation. Thus, both consequences of
MEFV mutations may lead to the heightened responsiveness of
cryopyrin/NALP3/CIAS1, which can be oligomerized and
activated in response to a very diverse range of ligands such as
bacterial muramyl dipeptide, ATP, toxins, bacterial and viral
RNA, small antiviral compounds, Staphylococcus, Listeria, and uric
acid crystals as well as by low intracellualr potassium concentration [66–71]. While these exo- and endogenous stimuli are
normally not perceived as danger signals or are efficiently
suppressed, the facilitated oligomerization of the cryopyrin/
NALP3/CIAS1, which is not adequately suppressed by the
mutated pyrin in FMF, may be the underlying cause in this
disease, resulting in excessive pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL1b
processing. Indeed, monocytes from FMF patients in remission
fail to induce LPS homologous tolerance and exhibit heightened
sensitivity to bacterial endotoxin [72], one of the important
activators of the cryopyrin/NALP3/CIAS1 inflammasome [73].
In conclusion, we established in this work that mutations in a
single host gene lead to specific restructuring of commensal gut
microbiota. Although the exact molecular mechanisms behind this
process are not fully understood, at our current genetic stage of
analysis the work points to the host genotype as a key factor in
symbiotic host-microbe interaction. Further developments in this
area may focus on details of this interaction at the biochemical and
physiological levels. Other models of gut inflammation such as
IBD may help to establish the role of other host genes affecting the
composition of commensal gut microbiota. Comparative community analyses from genetically different hosts are particularly
interesting in identifying gut microbiota alterations specific for a
particular disease genotype. At the same time, it cannot be
excluded that the changes in the community structure may share
some common features reflecting the similarities in disease
phenotypes such as inflammation. And finally, how the gut
microbiota is transformed in disease to become a ‘‘pathobiota’’
[37] remains an interesting question to answer.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and sampling
A total of 19 Armenian FMF patients with clinically confirmed
disease, seven healthy individuals of the same ethnic background,
and one healthy subject of non-Armenian origin participated in
this study (Table 1). All FMF cases were diagnosed based on TelHashomer criteria [74]. Blood and fecal samples were collected
from FMF patients (15 males, four females; aged from 15 to 64
years, mean age–27 years) and control subjects (one male, seven
females; aged from 32 to 67 years, mean age–43.8 years) for
genotyping and gut bacterial diversity analyses (see below). None
of the FMF patients and healthy individuals had used antibiotics
within the three months prior to sampling. In the beginning of this

study, ten FMF patients were not receiving any drugs and nine
were undergoing regular colchicine therapy. During the study, one
patient from the colchicine-free group was prescribed this therapy.
All subjects were informed about the aim of this study and gave
their consent to participate in it. The study was approved by the
local ethical committee at IMB.
Genetic diagnostics
Venous blood samples were obtained from the clinically
confirmed 19 FMF patients and eight healthy controls to reveal
the MEFV mutation carrier status. Genetic analysis was based on
screening of two mutational hot spots in the MEFV gene (exons 2
and 10). For this, genomic DNA was isolated from the
anticoagulated venous blood samples using the Wizard Genomics
DNA Purification kit (Promega, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Exon 2 of the MEFV gene was PCR amplified
from genomic DNA using a newly designed forward and reverse
primer set: Exon2F - 59-ATTCTCTCTCCTCTGCCCTG-39,
Exon2R - 59-CCATTCTTTCTCTGCAGCCG-39, yielding a
839 bp amplicon. Exon 10 was amplified using the primers
Exon10F 59-CCAGAAGAACTACCCTGTCCC-39 and
Exon10R 59-TCCTCCTCTGAAATCCATGG-39, yielding a
product of 887 bp [39]. For exon 10, amplification was performed
in a final volume of 50 ml, in a mix containing 10 mM Tris-HCl,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 200 mM of each dNTP, 10.0 pmol
of each primer, approximately 20 ng of genomic DNA, and 1 U of
Red Taq polymerase (Bioline, UK). The cycling conditions
included the initial denaturation step for 5 min at 94uC, followed
by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94uC for 30 sec,
annealing at 61uC for 60 sec, and extension at 72uC for 60 sec,
with a final extension at 72uC for 10 min. For exon 2, PCR
amplification was performed similarly, except that the PCR mix
contained 1 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Amplicons of the
expected size were excised from 1.5% agarose gel and purified
using a Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up system (Promega,
UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified PCR
products were sequenced on both directions, using the same
primer set as for generation of templates and the sequences were
read on an automated 8-channel capillary sequencer (Beckman,
USA) The wild-type sequences of exons 2 and 10 of the MEFV
gene were retrieved from GenBank (accession number AF111163).
Generation of 16S rDNA clone libraries
In order to derive a detailed phylogenetic inventory of the gut
microflora in FMF and in healthy controls, we constructed
bacterial 16S rDNA gene libraries from fecal samples. For this,
freshly voided feces were collected into sterile containers from 12
FMF patients in remission, three patients in the acute stage of
FMF, six healthy Armenians, and one healthy subject of nonArmenian origin (Table 1). One patient, FMF 13-123, provided
the samples both in remission and attack. Total DNA was
extracted from fecal samples using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit
(Qiagen, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA
was additionally purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1) extraction, ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in TE
buffer. Amplification of the 16S rRNA genes was carried out with
the universal primer set–27F (59-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-39; positions 8 to 27 in the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene)
and 1492R (59-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-39; positions
1510 to 1492 in the E. coli 16S rRNA gene) [75]. The PCR
reaction mixture contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgCl2,
50 mM KCl, 200 mM of each dNTP, 10.0 pmol of each primer,
1U of Bio-X-Act Short DNA polymerase (Bioline, UK), and
100 ng of template DNA in a final volume of 50 ml. To reduce
PCR bias caused by elevated number of PCR cycles [57],
amplifications were performed using the following conditions:
initial denaturation of template DNA at 94uC for 5 min, followed
by 10 cycles of denaturation at 94uC for 30 sec, annealing at 57uC
for 30 sec, and extension at 72uC for 2 min, with a final extension
at 72uC for 10 min. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose
gel in TBE buffer stained with GelStar (Cambrex, UK). 16S PCR
products were purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up
system (Promega, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This was followed by ethanol precipitation and the final
pellets were suspended in 5 ml of TE buffer (pH 8.0). The purified
PCR products were directly cloned into pCR-4 cloning vector and
then transformed into E. coli TOP10 chemically competent cells
using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, UK), according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. Colonies were blue/white screened
on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates supplemented with ampicillin
(50 mg/ml) and X-Gal (80 mg/ml). No IPTG was necessary in this
system because the strain and plasmid do not carry the lac
repressor. White recombinant colonies were randomly picked up
into 200 ml of LB medium with ampicillin (50 mg/ml) in a 96-well
format, sealed with a gas-permeable membrane, and incubated
overnight at 37uC in a horizontal shaker. Two insert-surrounding
primers, T3 (59-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGA-39) and T7
(59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-39) were used to amplify
inserts using a 35-cycle colony PCR. Products were visualized after
electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer and ethidium
bromide staining.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Successfully amplified 16S rDNA inserts were purified and
sequenced on the automated 8-channel capillary sequencers
(Beckman, USA). The sequencing reactions were carried out with
926R primer (59-CCGTCAATTCCTTTGAGTTT-39; positions
926 to 907 in the E. coli 16S rRNA gene) [76]. Nucleotide
sequences were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment
program CLUSTALX v1.83 [77]. Each sequence was manually
edited in conjunction with its chromatogram. Sequences were
examined for the possible chimeras using CHIMERA_CHECK
online analysis at RDP-II website (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/cgis/
chimera.cgi?su = SSU). Similarity search of the 16S rDNA
sequences against database entries was performed using online
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program at the
NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Distance
and similarity matrices were constructed with the DNADIST
program v3.6 from PHYLIP (http://evolution.genetics.washington.
edu/phylip/phylip.html) according to the Jukes-Cantor model.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbour-joining
method [78]. Statistical significance of branching was verified by
bootstrap analysis involving the construction and analysis of 1000
trees from bootstrapped data sets. Operational taxonomic units
(OTUs), or phylotypes, were defined at 99% level as recommended
for gut microbiota analyses [59]. To assign sequences quickly and
accurately to OTUs, additionally, Jukes-Cantor corrected distance
matrices were analyzed with DOTUR (Distance-Based OTU and
Richness) by using the furthest-neighbor method [79].
About the half of OTUs (165 out of 346) were sequenced to
completion. For this, a set of additional three universal bacterial
primers, 27F (59-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-39; positions
8 to 27 in the E. coli 16S rRNA gene), 519R (59-GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTG-39; positions 536 to 519 in the E. coli 16S
rRNA gene) [76] and RP2 (59- ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT -39; positions 1510 to 1492 in the E. coli 16S rRNA gene)
was used. These partial rRNA gene sequences (the average single
sequence read length was ,700 bp), including the sequence
Host Genetics and Microbiota

previously generated by the 926R primer, were assembled with
ChromasPro v1.33 program to produce a consensus sequence for
each of the 165 clones. Initially, all sequence data were assembled
according to their overlapping sequence fragments into a
contiguous consensus sequence using default program settings or,
in some cases, adjusting the program settings, if necessary,
followed by verification by eye. Afterwards, all chromatogram
contigs obtained were manually edited removing ambiguous
chromatogram areas, which resulted in the nearly full-length
16S bacterial rDNA sequences of about 1500 bp.
All full-length sequences were checked for possible chimeras
using Chimera Check program, v2.7 (online analysis at Ribosomal
Database Project II website, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/cgis/chimera.
cgi?su = SSU). Chimeras and sequences of poor quality were omitted
from further phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis was
performed in two stages. First, the almost full-length sequences from
our libraries were combined with the closest relatives, cultivated and
uncultivated, from databases, aligned, and subjected to phylogenetic
analysis using the neighbor-joining method [78]. In the second stage,
the partial sequences were aligned to the full-length sequence profile
using the guide tree generated during the first stage. A total of 1328
validated 16S rDNA sequences participated in the final tree
computing. Validation of the tree branching was done with bootstrap
analysis [80] involving 1,000 reiterations with re-sampled data sets.
Community structure analysis
Rarefaction and collector’s curves of observed phylotypes,
richness estimates and diversity indices were determined with
DOTUR program using Jukes-Cantor corrected distance matrix.
The bias-corrected Chao 1 richness estimator was calculated after
1000 randomizations of sampling without replacement. Collector’s
curves of observed and estimated (Chao 1 and the abundance-based
coverage estimator, ACE) richness were constructed. Diversity was
estimated by the Shannon and Simpson indices, the Simpson
reciprocal index was calculated as 1/D, and another version of the
Simpson diversity index–as 1-D. The evenness was calculated as
E=eH/N, where H is the Shannon diversity index, N is the number
of phylotypes. The Good’s coverage percentage was calculated with
the formula [12(n/N)]6100, where n is the number of phylotypes
in a sample represented by one clone (singletons) and N is the total
number of sequences in that sample [81].
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
FISH analysis was applied to quantify the predominant groups of
bacteria in fecal samples using the universal bacterial and groupspecific 16S rRNA-based Cy3-labelled oligonucleotide probes
(Table 9). The probes hybridized with the next bacterial groups:
Eub338 with the total bacteria [82]; Bac303 with the Bacteroides
group [83]; Erec482 with the members of the Clostridium coccoides
group (cluster XIVa) [84]; Rrec584 with the Eubacterium rectaleRoseburia cluster, which is a component of clostridial cluster XIVa
[85]; Fprau645 for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii-related bacteria–a
component of clostridial cluster IV [86]; the Rfla729 and the
Rbro730 probes are specific for ruminococci in clostridial cluster IV
[87]; Prop853 for the members of clostridial cluster IX [88]; Bif164
for the genus Bifidobacterium [89]; Ato291 for the Atopobium group
[90]; EnterobactD for the genus Enterobacteriaceae [91]; and Lab158
for lactobacilli and enterococci [92] (Table 9). Together, the groupspecific probes detected the vast majority of the total bacterial cells
in the normal human gut [84]. The Rrec584 probe was excluded
from this summation, since it detects the E. rectale-Roseburia cluster
within the group already covered by the probe Erec482 [85]. The
probe Rfla729 was used in conjunction with the probe Rbro730 as
the target bacterial groups are overlapping [87].
Freshly voided feces from six FMF patients in remission, seven
in the acute phase, six healthy Armenians and one healthy subject
of non-Armenian descent were collected (Table 1). Two patients,
FMF 13-123 and FMF 87, provided fecal samples at both disease
stages. The samples in sterile plastic bags were kept at 4uC for no
longer than 12 h prior processing. The specimens were kneaded
mechanically for 5 min at 4uC to distribute the sample evenly.
0.5 g of each sample was suspended in 4.5 ml of filtered (0.2 mm
pore-size filter) ice-cold phosphate-buffer-saline (PBS) and vortexed with a dozen of glass beads for at least 3 min to homogenize the
sample and dislodge the bacteria from feed particles. The
suspension was centrifuged at 7006g for 1 min to remove debris.
One ml of supernatant was added to three ml of 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, fixed at 4uC for 16 hours,

washed with ice-cold PBS, and stored in 50% (vol/vol) ethanolPBS at 220uC until analysed.
Depending on the expected number of target cells, the samples
were diluted 40- to 1600-fold, and 10 ml of a diluted bacterial
suspension was applied to gelatin-coated slides, air-dried and fixed
in 100% ethanol. 10 ml of 50 ng/ml solution of oligonucleotide
probes in 100 ml of hybridization buffer was added to the slides
and the samples were hybridized overnight (except for the Bac303
probe, which was incubated for 2 h) in a precision incubator at
different temperatures, depending on the probe (Table 9). If more
stringent conditions were required, formamide was added to the
hybridization buffer. To improve bacterial cell permeability
samples were incubated before hybridization in 10 ml of lysozyme
(final concentration 1 mg/ml) in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) at
37uC. The full panel of FISH oligonucleotide probes with their
target bacterial groups and hybridization conditions used in this
study is shown in Table 9.
After hybridization, the slides were soaked in a washing buffer
for 20 min at 50uC, rinsed with Milli-Q water, and rapidly dried
with compressed air. Slides then were covered with 50 ml of
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, California) to
prevent the fading of fluorescence and a coverslip. The
enumeration was performed when the hybridization signals were
clear and morphologically distinguishable. Bacterial cells were
counted automatically using image analysis software Quantimet
HR600 with a Leica DMRXA epifluorescence microscope
(Wetzlar, Germany). Depending on the number of labelled cells,
from 20 to 50 fields were counted to bring the coefficient of
variance value below 10.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statsoft Statistica
package (www.statsoft.com). Comparisons were made among
groups of subjects using the Mann-Whitney U test and Student’s
t-test. Multiple comparisons were carried out using Kruskal-Wallis
test. In order to classify cases data were subjected to discriminant
function analysis (DA). The P-values below 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Statistical comparison of 16S rDNA clone libraries was
performed using online library compare tool at RDP-II website
(http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/comparison/comp.jsp). This tool uses
the RDP Naive Bayesian classifier to provide rapid classification of
library sequences into the bacterial taxonomy proposed by the
Bergey’s Trust. The P values ,0.01 were considered as having
significant differences.
