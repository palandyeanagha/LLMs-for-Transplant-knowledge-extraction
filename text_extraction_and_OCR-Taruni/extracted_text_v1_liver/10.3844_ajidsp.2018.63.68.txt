Abstract: Infective Endocarditis (IE) still remains a serious disease. The 
treatment and pathology still remain unclear. In this study, we sought to 
clarify the epidemiology and treatment of IE in a teaching hospital in 
Saudi Arabia. In this study, we sought to conduct a retrospective 
investigation of all adult patients who were treated for IE at our hospital 
and determine the characteristic demographic, clinical and pathological 
features. Our findings indicate that the main risk factors of IE were 
surgical intervention (28%) and structural heart disease (20%). The mean 
(SD) age of the patients in our study was 48 (18). The most common 
organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus (40%) and 
Streptococcus viridans (30%). The most common clinical presentations 
were anorexia, weight loss and shortness of breath. IE was accompanied 
by valvular dysfunction in most cases (83%) and vegetation (55%). About 
83% of the patients had undergone transthoracic echocardiography. Our 
findings provided some insight into the current trends in the epidemiology 
and clinical features of IE in Saudi Arabia.

Introduction 
Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening infection 
characterized by the inflammation of the cardiac 
endothelium and valvular tissue. Histopathologically, it is 
marked by the presence of microorganisms in the lesion. 
Clinically, the condition can worsen rapidly, resulting in 
fatality if left untreated. In fact, the mortality rate of IE 
continues to remain high even in the face of the 
considerable advances made in medical technology and 
pharmacology Al-Tawfiq et al. (2009). IE is most 
often seen in intravenous drug abusers and patients
with other cardiovascular diseases, especially those 
who have undergone heart valve replacement AlTawfiq et al. (2009). 
According to age and sex, IE is known to differ in 
etiological factors, clinical features, natural history and 
therefore treatment. Staphylococcus aureus has been 
identified as the most common pathogenic organism 
in IE in developed countries and has been the cause of 
severe disease in affected populations, particularly 
patients who are elderly and those with pre-existing 
anomalies Cahill et al. (2017). Clinically, the disease 
continues to remain challenging to diagnose and 
manage. One of the main reasons for the difficulty in the 
treatment of IE is that the affected patients generally have 
severe pre-existing diseases and their general condition
may already be poor 3. In a recent study, Capilla et al. 
(2017) showed that IE continues to remain a serious 
condition and that S. aureus is the most common 
pathogenic organism involved in IE Capilla et al. (2017). 
At present, limited data are available on the prevalence, 
epidemiology and etiology of IE in the Gulf region,
particularly, Saudi Arabia. Other than case reports, very few 
studies have been published in this regard from Saudi 
Arabia Christine et al. (2012). Therefore, in this study, we 
evaluated the epidemiological, clinical and microbiological 
features of IE at a teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia. 
Methodology 
This was a retrospective study conducted on patients 
with IE treated at our hospital between the years 2016 and 

Reham Kaki and Nabeela Al-Abdullah / American Journal of Infectious Diseases 2018, 14 (2): 63.68

2017. Only adult patients diagnosed with IE were included 
in this study and children were excluded. The study 
protocol was approved by the institutional review board and 
need for patient consent was waived. 
Setting 
The study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University 
Hospital (KAUH), a tertiary teaching hospital affiliated to 
the Medical School in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The hospital 
has a capacity of 750 beds and includes all specialties. 
There are approximately 45, 000 patients being discharged 
from the hospital annually. 
Data Collection 
The type of study is retrospective based on patients’
records were used to obtain data regarding their 
demographic and clinical characteristics as well as the 
investigative and pathological findings. The parameters 
taken into consideration were age, sex, nationality, 
clinical stage of disease as well as clinical 
characteristics such as signs and symptoms, presence of 
valvular dysfunction, vegetation, presence of large 
vegetation and presence of comorbidities. The records 
were anonymized to ensure patient confidentiality. The 
patient included in this study based on the diagnosis IE 
and we trace all cases from 2016 to 2017. 
Statistical Analysis 
The retrieved data were analyzed using SPSS version 
21. Comparisons of continuous variables were made and 
those of categorical variables were made with the chisquare test or Fisher’s exact test in this study because 
sample size less than 50. To assess linearity, the quadratic 
age effect was introduced into the model, but was not found 
to be statistically significant. 
Results 
Demographic Characteristics 
During the study period, a total of 40 patients with IE 
were admitted to KAUH. The demographic and clinical
characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. The 
average age of the patients was 48 (±18) years and IE was 
found to affect significantly more men than women (75% 
Vs. 25%). Non-Saudi patients (70%) were significantly 
more common than Saudis. Further, acute disease was more 
common than sub-acute presentation of IE (53% vs. 48%). 
Medical treatment (93%) was administered to a 
significantly greater number of patients as compared to 
surgical treatment (P = 0.06). 
Clinical Presentation 
Table 2 shows the clinical features of those enrolled in 
this study. The most common comorbidities among the 
patients were hypertension and ischemic heart disease (30% 
and 36%, respectively); these diseases were significantly 
more common than other conditions/diseases (P = 0.05). 
For clinical manifestations, the symptom of anorexia
(55%), followed by weight loss (50%) and shortness of 
breath (48%) were significantly more common than others 
(Table 3). In terms of pathological findings, the most 
common organisms identified were S. aureus (40%) 
followed by Streptococcus viridans (30%). Other groups 
identified were Haemophilus spp., Aggregatibacter
(previously Actinobacillus) spp., Cardiobacterium spp., 
Eikenella spp. and Kingella spp. (7.5%) Identified as 
[HACEK] organisms.

The risk factors identified in this study are shown in 
Table 5. The most common risk factors of IE identified in 
this study were surgical intervention (28%) and structural 
heart disease (20%) which had a significantly higher risk 
than other factors. In terms of clinical manifestations, most 
patients exhibited valve dysfunction (83%), followed by 
vegetation (55%) (Table 6). The most common positive 
laboratory findings (Table 7) were elevated serum Creactive protein levels and elevated erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, which were observed in 70% and 
65% of the patients, respectively. 
Discussion 
The current study was aimed at evaluating the 
epidemiology, pathology and treatment of IE. Our data 
were based on investigations of 40 patients who have 
been treated during the period from 2014 to 2016. Our 
study is unique in that these patients have been treated 
at our clinics unlike other studies that have been based 
on the discharge diagnosis. 
Long-term studies on the epidemiology of IE among 
adult patients with congenital heart disease have shown 
the use of valvular prosthetics is associated with a higher 
risk of IE as compared to other treatment procedures 
such as valve repair surgery Christine et al. (2012) . 
A previous study conducted in Saudi Arabia showed 
that IE occurred most commonly as a result of native valve 
endocarditis and that the most common pathogenic 
organisms involved were S aureus, Enterococcus faecalis 
and streptococci viridans Gil et al. (2017). On the other 
hand, the most common organisms isolated from the 
patients in our study were S. aureus (40%), followed by S. 
viridans (30%) (Table 4). This finding is different from 
other studies, which have shown that S. viridans is the 
most common pathogenic organism. (Jean et al., 2017; 
Kuijpers et al., 2017), However, our findings are 
consistent with those of more recent studies (Capilla et al., 
2017; Marks, et al., 2015). which have shown an 
increasing predominance of staphylococcal infection in 
some regions of the world. This change in organism 
together with the finding that IE occurred more often in 
patients with a history of pre-existing ischemic heart disease 
(36%) and hypertension as well as in patients who have 
undergone surgery (28%) indicate that the disease is 
becoming increasingly complex, which highlights the need 
for the specialized and dedicated approaches, as stressed by 
Ambrosioni et al. (2017) and Nakagawa et al. (2014) 
Further, the increase in staphylococcal infection is 
concerning since studies indicate that staphylococcal IE 
is associated with more serious consequences and 
higher mortality as compared to streptococcal IE 
Nakagawa et al. (2014). 
The finding of men being more susceptible to IE as 
compared to women is consistent with the findings of 
previous studies in the UK and Japan (Jean et al., 2017; 
Kuijpers et al., 2017) However, the mean (SD) age of 
patients in our study was lower, 48 (18) years, than those in 
the abovementioned studies (52 years) (Jean et al., 2017; 
Kuijpers et al., 2 017), particularly, a long-term study that 
showed an increase in the age of IE patients over two 
decades Kuijpers et al. (2017). As mentioned above, the 
predilection for the elderly population earlier noted in a 
study Christine et al. (2012). from the same region as ours 
was not noted ours. Moreover, in our study, we found 
that IE affected non-Saudi patients more frequently
than Saudis. However, this finding may not be 
significant because our hospital has a majority of nonSaudi patients since ours is the only government 
hospital that accepts patients of other nationalities. 
Clinically, IE can vary in presentation from simple
infection of the values with minimal damage to a sudden, 
severe, life-threatening condition. The most common signs 
and symptoms associated with IE are the following: chills, 
malaise, anorexia, weight loss, arthralgia, shortness of 
breath, cough and chest and back pain (Table 3). Around 
55% of our patients had anorexia and 50% had weight loss, 
only 10% had arthralgia. The most common signs and 
symptoms noted in our study were anorexia, weight 
loss and shortness of breath. This is different from
other studies that have reported more acute symptoms 
such as fever, chills and malaise Marks et al. (2015). 
With respect to underlying disease, the most 
common comorbidities found in our study were 

Reham Kaki and Nabeela Al-Abdullah / American Journal of Infectious Diseases 2018, 14 (2): 63.68

67 
ischemic heart disease in 36%, hypertension in 30% 
and diabetes mellitus in 28% (Table 2). This is 
consistent with findings of some other studies that have 
shown a predominance of pre-existing heart disease 
(Jean et al., 2017; Kuijpers et al., 2017). Structural 
heart disease was present in 28% of our patients. 
Our study provides an overview of the current clinical 
and epidemiological trends of IE in Saudi Arabia. Similar to 
a previous report from the country, which reported the 
predominance of S. aureus (42.6%), ours showed that the 
organism was responsible for IE in 40% of the cases
Christine et al. (2012). However, the percentage of S. 
viridans in our study was almost double that noted in the 
previous study (30% Vs. 16.7%) Christine et al. (2012). 
This suggests the need for further investigation focusing on 
changing patterns in the pathogenic organisms in our 
region, as observed in some other regions of the world. 
Further, the mean (SD) age of the patients in our study was 
much less than that reported in the previous investigation 
(48 (18) years Vs. 59.7 (18.2) years) (Christine et al., 
2012). This could be related to the advances in healthcare 
facilities and increasing number of intervensive 
investigative and therapeutic procedures (Wan et al., 
2017). Interestingly, in our study, only 10% of the patients 
had IE associated with the implantation of prosthetic valves. 
This percentage is much lower than that reported in the 
study by (Marks et al., 2015) (21%) and Al-Tawfiq and 
Sufi (2009). (18.7%), but closer to the study from Japan 
(13%) (Wan et al., 2017). This is consistent with our 
finding of staphylococcal predominance since the latter
are known to affect native valves, whereas streptococci
have a preference for prosthetic valves Jean et al. (2017). 
This study has some limitations. First, the sample 
population was small and this was only a single-center 
study. In future, we intend to investigate a larger sample 
population across multiple centers. Second, in this study we 
did not recruit a control group to compare the characteristics 
of patients with IE with those of patients with other cardiac 
diseases. Future epidemiological investigations should be 
used to compare the characteristics of patients with IE and 
other population groups. Third, we did not assess mortality 
in this study since this was a cross-sectional rather than a 
longitudinal study. We intend to undertake long-term 
investigations to clarify this. 
To conclude, our study was able to provide some insight 
into the epidemiological status of IE. This disease seems to 
be evolving with the advances in medical technology and 
changes in the treatment protocol of other diseases, 
particularly surgical and interventive investigative 
procedures. Therefore, it is imperative that 
epidemiological studies are routinely undertaken in 
various parts of the world across various population 
groups in order to identify its peculiar clinical 
characteristics, risk factors and the causative pathogenic 
organisms and accordingly modify treatment and 
diagnostic procedures in order to combat IE effectively.
