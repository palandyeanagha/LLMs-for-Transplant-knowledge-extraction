Abstract
The hepatitis C virus is a positive stranded hepatotropic RNA
virus. We describe a method of detecting positive and negative
strands of hepatitis C viral RNA using the polymerase chain
reaction. We tested serum and liver tissue from nine patients
with chronic hepatitis C. The positive RNA strand of HCV was
detected in the sera and livers of all nine, the negative strand
was detected in the livers of eight (89%), and in the sera of
five (55%).
Titers of both strands of HCV RNA were determined by
serial endpoint dilutions. The amount of the negative strand in
the serum and liver was usually 10-100 times less than the
positive strand. Predigestion of serum with ribonucleases did
not alter the detection of the negative strand. This suggests that
the negative strand found in the serum may be protected from
digestion by being associated with virions. (J. Clin. Invest.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV)' is a positive-stranded RNA virus responsible for most cases of blood-borne non-A, non-B hepatitis. Although the genome of the virus has been cloned and its
nucleotide sequence determined, little is known about its mechanism of replication. The HCV is closely related to the flaviviruses and pestiviruses (1) whose replicative strategies have been
studied in vitro (2). Replication offlaviviruses involves the production of a complementary genomic-length negative RNA
strand via semiconservative RNA synthesis using the positive
RNA strand as a template. Positive strands are then amplified
using the negative strand as a template (3). Positive strands
produced in this way may be used to synthesize more negative
RNA strands, to translate viral proteins or to be packaged into
virions. The fate of the negative strand after completion ofthis
cycle is not known.

Due to the relatively small quantities of HCV-RNA found
in serum and liver tissue of infected individuals, it can usually
only detected by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
(4-10). We have studied the replication of HCV by determining the presence of the negative RNA strand of HCV in the
serum and liver of infected patients. PCR does not selectively
detect either the positive or negative strands of HCV, as it is
usually performed. We describe the specific detection of both
the negative (replicative) RNA strand and the positive (genomic) RNA strand, separately, in the serum and liver tissue of
infected individuals. The relative quantities ofthe positive and
negative strands were determined and compared by serial end
point dilutions.
Methods
Paired liver biopsy and serum samples were obtained from nine patients with chronic hepatitis C who were being evaluated for various
trials of antiviral therapy. A portion of the liver biopsy was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70'C until use. Serum
samples were obtained on the same day and stored at -20'C. AntiHCV was assayed by ELISA (Ortho Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ).
RNA was extracted from liver as described by Chomczynski and
Sacchi with several modifications (1 1). Briefly, the frozen tissue (wt,
- 20-30 mg) was homogenized in 450,ul 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 2 mM sodium citrate, pH 7, 5% sarcosyl, and 0.1 M mercaptoethanol. Sequentially, 45 Al of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4), 450 Ml watersaturated phenol, and 300 ul chloroform-isoamyl alcohol mixture
(49: 1) were added and mixed. The suspension was placed on ice for 15
min and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min. The aqueous layer
was then extracted with an equal volume of chloroform and alcohol
precipitated overnight. The RNA pellet was washed in 70% ethanol,
and resuspended in RNasin-treated autoclaved water (200 U/ml H20)
(Promega Biotec, Madison, WI). The amount of RNA extracted from
liver was determined by spectrophotometry. RNA from serum was
extracted from 50 Ml serum in guanidinium thiocyanate, phenol/chloroform as previously described (12). The precipitate was dissolved in 80
Ml of RNase free water.
The positive and negative strands of viral RNA were detected by
performing reverse transcription of RNA samples in the presence of
only one oligonucleotide primer (either the sense or the antisense
primer) followed by heat inactivation of the reverse transcriptase. The
DNA made in this reverse transcription reaction was therefore complementary to one or the other RNA strand and could then be amplified
by PCR in the presence of both oligonucleotide primers.
The oligonucleotide primers used were chosen from the highly conserved 5' noncoding region nucleotide sequence of the HCV genome
(13). For the external primers the following sequences were used: sense,
nucleotide Nos. 1-21, 5'-GGCGACACTCCACCATAGATC-3' and
antisense, nucleotide Nos. 304-324, 5'-GGTGCACGGTCTACGA1058 T.-L. Fong, M. Shindo, S. M. Feinstone, J. H. Hoofnagle, and A. M. Bisceglie

GACCT-3'. The internal primers were as follows: sense, nucleotide
Nos. 28-48, 5'-CTGTGAGGAACTACTGTCTTC-3' and antisense,
nucleotide Nos. 264-284, Y-CCCTATCAGGCAGTACCACAA-3'.
Reverse transcription (RT) was performed as described by Kawasaki (14) in a 20 ,ul reaction volume containing 5 ,d of either liver (1.5
jig total RNA) or serum RNA, 0.2 ,M of either the sense or antisense
primers, 200 MuM of the four dNTP (Promega Biotec), 20 U of RNasin
(Promega Biotec), lx PCR buffer and 5 U of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega Biotec). The mixture was overlaid with mineral oil and
incubated at 42°C for 30 min. The reverse transcriptase was then inactivated by heating at 95°C for 20 min and then quickly chilled on ice.
PCR amplification was performed by adding 80 ul of lX PCR
buffer containing 0.2 MuM of the opposite sense primer and 2 U of Taq
polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT). The thermocycler was
programmed to incubate samples at 95°C for 5 min and then to carry
out 25 cycles consisting of95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1
min, followed by a 5-min final extension at 72°C.
For the second amplification, 10 Ml were removed from the first
reaction and were added to a similar reaction mixture as the first with
0.2 MM of the inner primers instead of the outer primers. PCR was
carried out for 35 cycles as described for the first amplification.
20 Ml ofthe second amplification was analyzed by electrophoresis in
a 2% agarose gel containing 0.5 Mlg/ml ofethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. The size ofthe expected amplification product was 257 bp. Titers ofHCV-positive and -negative strand RNA were
estimated by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA extracted from 50
Ml of serum.
Carryover PCR contamination was avoided by following the measures outlined by Kwok and Higuchi (15). All serum and liver samples
were extracted in parallel with negative controls, which included three
liver samples from patients with chronic hepatitis B, one from a patient
with systemic mastocytosis and two normal liver samples.
For each set of reverse transcription/PCR experiments, a series of
controls were performed. To exclude contamination by a PCR product, a reaction was performed using all the components except RT.
This control reaction would also rule out the possibility ofa replicative
DNA intermediate. To rule out residual RT activity after heat inactivation ofRT, a reaction was done using all components except the primer
during the RT step. After heat inactivation of RT, both sense and
antisense primers were included in the PCR mixture. To rule out contamination ofthe outer sense primer with the antisense primer, the RT
reaction and first PCR was carried out using only the sense primer.
Results
Liver and serum from nine patients with chronic hepatitis C
were analyzed. All patients had elevated serum aminotransferase activities (mean serum alanine aminotransferase 157 U/
liter, range 86-409 U/liter, normal < 41 U/liter) for > 6 mo.
All had antibodies to HCV in serum. Histological examination
of their liver biopsy samples showed chronic active hepatitis in
eight and active cirrhosis in one (Table I).
The positive RNA strand of HCV was detected in the liver
of all nine patients (100%) (geometric mean titer, 10-3.2; range,
10-2_10-5) and the negative strand was found in eight of the
nine patients (89%). The titer of the negative RNA strand of
HCV in the liver was 10-100 times less than the positive strand
(Table I).
The positive RNA strand of HCV was detected in the
serum of nine patients (100%) (geometric mean titer, 10-27;
range, l0-'-10-4). The negative strand was detected in only
five of the nine patients (56%). The titer of the negative strand
was 10-fold less than the positive strand in four patients and the
same in one patient. The presence ofthe negative strand in the
serum did not correlate with the presence or the titer of the
negative strand in the liver. The presence or the titer of the
negative strand did not correlate with the aminotransferase activities or the severity of the histology (Table I).
Neither strand of HCV RNA was found in the negative
control samples. Control reactions in which RT was either destroyed before the addition of primers, or not added, were all
negative. Reactions using only one set ofprimer (sense primer)
were negative.
To determine whether the negative RNA strand of HCV in
the serum was free or protected from serum nucleases, serum
from three patients containing high titers ofthe negative strand
was subjected to ribonuclease digestion before extraction of
RNA as follows. Sera were incubated with a mixture of RNase
A (1 mg/ml) and RNase Tl (20,000 U/ml) (Ambion, Austin,
TX) at 37°C for 30 min. No change was seen in either the
amount or character of both negative and positive strand HCV

Replicative Intermediates ofHepatitis C Viral RNA 1059

cDNA after reverse transcription and PCR. To assess the efficiency of ribonuclease digestion of free viral RNA, RNA was
extracted from serum of patients 4 and 9 (see Table I) and
added to normal serum with and without the addition of ribonucleases before performing RT-PCR. Under these conditions,
the HCV RNA from both patients was completely degraded by
the ribonucleases.
Discussion
Choo and co-workers originally suggested that the HCV was a
positive-stranded RNA virus based on hybridization studies of
RNA extracted from the serum of an infected chimpanzee (1).
They found that the cDNA strand from their original clone of
HCV that hybridized to plasma-derived RNA was complementary to the strand encoding a recombinant HCV protein, indicating that the HCV RNA found in serum was positivestranded with respect to the translation of this protein.
Little has been learned subsequently about the replicative
strategy of HCV. Because of the relatively small amounts of
HCV present in liver and serum, HCV RNA cannot be reliably
detected by standard molecular hybridization techniques. Using a modification of the PCR technique, we have been able to
separately identify and quantitate both positive and negative
strands of HCV RNA in samples from patients with chronic
HCV infection.
The presence of the positive (genomic) RNA strand in the
liver was confirmed and, in addition, we demonstrated the presence of the negative (replicative) RNA strand of HCV within
the liver. This suggests that the HCV replicates via a negativestranded RNA intermediate. The amount ofthe negative HCV
RNA strand was usually at least 10-fold less than the positive
strand, a ratio that was described in a study of RNA synthesis in
type 2 Dengue virus in cell culture (3). The absence of a DNA
replicative intermediate was confirmed by the control reaction
in which extracted nucleic acids were amplified without prior
RT (1).
Whereas the finding of the negative RNA strand of HCV in
the liver was not unexpected, its presence in serum in some
patients was surprising. The reason for the presence ofthe negative RNA strand of HCV in serum remains to be determined.
The observation that both positive and negative RNA strands
in serum were resistant to digestion by ribonucleases suggests
that they are both virion associated. Another possibility is that
the negative RNA strand of HCV could also be membranebound but not virion-associated and be released during hepatocytolysis, thus protecting it from ribonuclease digestion. Finally, it is possible that the negative RNA strand of HCV was
present in serum in free form after its release from the liver by
hepatocytolysis induced by HCV infection. This explanation
appears unlikely as we found that free HCV RNA which had
been extracted from virions and added to serum was digested
and rendered undetectable by ribonuclease treatment.
The clinical significance of finding the negative RNA
strand of HCV in liver or serum remains to be determined, as
its presence was not associated with higher serum aminotransferase activities or more severe liver disease histologically (Table I). Similarly, the levels of HCV RNA in the liver do not
appear to be related to the degree of liver injury present although only a relatively small number ofpatients were studied.
Previous studies have found that a clinical and biochemical
response to alpha interferon therapy in patients with chronic
hepatitis C was associated with the disappearance of HCV genome from serum. However, HCV RNA invariably reappeared in patients in whom the hepatitis relapsed when interferon was stopped (12). The presence or absence of hepatic
HCV RNA (both positive and negative strands) may be a useful
marker of response to antiviral therapy, in particular, to evaluate the appropriate timing for discontinuation of therapy.
