Abstract
Background: Patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are
recommended to undergo transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). However, TACE in combination with
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is not inferior to surgical resection (SR), and the benefits of surgical resection (SR) for
BCLC stage B HCC remain unclear. Hence, this study aims to compare the impact of SR, TACE+RFA, and TACE on
analyzing overall survival (OS) in BCLC stage B HCC.
Methods: Overall, 428 HCC patients were included in BCLC stage B, and their clinical data and OS were recorded.
OS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis.
Results: One hundred forty (32.7%) patients received SR, 57 (13.3%) received TACE+RFA, and 231 (53.9%) received
TACE. The OS was significantly higher in the SR group than that in the TACE+RFA group [hazard ratio (HR): 1.78;
95% confidence incidence (CI): 1.15–2.75, p = 0.009]. The OS was significantly higher in the SR group than that in
the TACE group (HR: 3.17; 95% CI: 2.31–4.36, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the OS was significantly higher in the TACE+RFA
group than that in the TACE group (HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.21–2.74, p = 0.004). The cumulative OS rates at 1, 3 and 5
years in the SR, TACE+RFA, and TACE groups were 89.2, 69.4 and 61.2%, 86.0, 57.9 and 38.2%, and 69.5, 37.0 and
15.2%, respectively. After propensity score matching, the SR group still had a higher OS than those of the
TACE+RFA and TACE groups. The TACE+RFA group had a higher OS than that of the TACE group.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer but the third most lethal cancer worldwide
[1]. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system is
widely utilized in the American Association for the
Study of Liver Disease (AASLD), European Association
for the Study of Liver (EASL) and Asian-Pacific Associated for the Study of the Liver (APASL) guidelines for
the treatment of HCC [2–4]. Patients with stage B
(intermediate stage) HCC are recommended to undergo
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) based
on the BCLC system [2–4]. However, surgical resection
(SR) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are curative
therapies in BCLC stage 0/A and are alternative therapies for selected patients with BCLC stage B in clinical
practice [5–7]. Previous studies have shown that TACE
combined with RFA (TACE+RFA) has a better overall
survival (OS) than TACE in BCLC stage B [6, 8, 9].
Moreover, some studies have shown that SR can have a
better OS than TACE with or without RFA in BCLC
stage B [5–7]. However, TACE+RFA is not inferior to
SR for patients with HCC within the Milan criteria [10].
Furthermore, TACE + RFA is not inferior to SR for patients with HCC within BCLC stage A or B after propensity score-based analysis [6]. Hence, this study aims to
compare the impact of SR, TACE + RFA, and TACE on
the OS of HCC patients with BCLC stage B. Each patient was treated with one of these three therapies. Furthermore, we compared the OS of patients in each
group using propensity score matching (PSM) to
minimize potential bias in the results.
Methods
Patients and follow-up
We retrospectively collected information on 2680 patients diagnosed with HCC between 2011 and 2018 at EDa Hospital, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Two
thousand and one hundred forty-six patients were excluded due to BCLC stage 0, A, C, and D, and 110 patients had incomplete data in BCLC stage B. Finally, 428
patients with BCLC stage B were included in this retrospective study (Fig. 1). The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the International
Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice and was approved by the Ethics Committee of E-Da
Hospital, I-Shou University (EMRP-107-130). Patients
were diagnosed with HCC based on histological confirmation or at least one typical imaging method according to the recommendations of the AASLD [2].
Clinicopathological parameters, including demographic
data, smoking, excessive alcohol use, hepatitis status,
serum total bilirubin, international normalization ratio
(INR), liver cirrhosis, Child-Pugh (CP) class, tumor size,
tumor number, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), mortality, and
follow-up time, were examined. Tumor number and
tumor size were mostly determined based on radiologic
findings and confirmed by pathologic findings if appropriate. Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed based on pathologic
findings and/or evaluated by ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The functional status of the liver was evaluated using
the CP scoring system.
Patients were treated with SR, TACE+RFA, and TACE,
and our multidisciplinary team chose suitable therapy.
The criteria for SR were resectable tumors, sufficient residual liver volume, CP class A or selected CP class B
patients, or absence of ascites and hypersplenism. The
indications of TACE+RFA were CP class A or B and absent ascites. The indications of TACE were CP class A
or B and absent massive ascites. Patients were divided
into the SR group, TACE+RFA group, and TACE group.
Patients were followed up every three to 6 months by
abdominal ultrasound, CT or MRI and AFP. OS was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date
of death or last visit, and the last follow-up time was
June 2019.
Data analysis and statistics
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ver.
23.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Numerical data were
expressed as medians and ranges. Categorical data were
described using numbers and percentages. OS was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
with patients receiving different treatments. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of OS in HCC patients
was performed according to different treatments. Moreover, we used logistic regression to perform PSM with
sex, age, cirrhosis, CP class, tumor size, and tumor number for patients to reduce bias in our analyses. Each
treatment group was matched with the control group
(SR group or TACE group) according to the generated
PSM using a caliper width of 0.2. On the completion of
Lin et al. BMC Gastroenterology (2020) 20:99 Page 2 of 8

matching, the baseline covariates were compared using
the paired t-test or Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. A p-value < 0.05 was used to determine statistical
significance.
Results
Baseline demographic data before propensity score
matching
A total of 428 HCC patients were included in this study
(Fig. 1). The demographic and clinical features of the
428 patients (77.8% male, median age of 63 years) are
shown in Table 1. Regarding the etiology of HCC, 47.9%
of the patients had HBV infection, 32.4% had HCV infection, and 42.3% had excessive alcohol use. Approximately 54.7% of patients had liver cirrhosis, and of those
patients, 86.9% had CP class A disease. Many (67.5%) of
the patients had tumors ≥5 cm in size, and 65.0% of the
patients had multiple tumors.
Overall survival of patients in the total and different
treatment groups
Of the 428 patients, 257 (60.0%) died, and the median
follow-up duration was 29 (range, 1–98) months (Table

1). The mortality rate was 24.8% per person-year. The
cumulative OS rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 80.8, 50.6
and 32.8%, respectively (Fig. 2a). Among the 428 patients, 140 (32.7%) patients received SR, 231 (53.9%) received TACE+RFA, and 57 (13.3%) received TACE
(Table 1). The OS was significantly better in the SR
group than in the TACE+RFA group (HR: 1.78; 95% CI:
1.15–2.75, p = 0.009, Fig. 2b). The OS was significantly
better in the SR group than in the TACE group (HR:
3.17; 95% CI: 2.31–4.36, p < 0.0001, Fig. 2b). Moreover,
the OS was significantly better in the TACE+RFA group
than in the TACE group (HR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.21–2.74,
p = 0.004, Fig. 2b). The cumulative OS rates at 1, 3 and
5 years in the SR, TACE+RFA, and TACE groups were

37.0 and 15.2%, respectively (Fig. 2b).
Baseline demographic data after propensity score
matching
The SR group showed significant differences compared
with the TACE+RFA and TACE groups with respect to
baseline features before PSM. The SR group had significantly lower rate of HCV infection cirrhosis, tumor
number, and mortality, lower serum total bilirubin and
INR level, and higher rate of CP class A and tumor size
compared to the TACE+RFA and TACE groups (p <
0.05) (Table 1). The PSM was performed with sex, age,
cirrhosis, CP class, tumor size, and tumor number, and
there were no significant differences for the important
features (Tables 2 and 3).
Overall survival of patients in the different treatment
groups after propensity score matching
In the SR group versus TACE+RFA group after PSM
(Table 2), 140 patients underwent SR, and 16 patients
received TACE+RFA. Patients undergoing SR had significantly higher survival rates than patients receiving
TACE+RFA (HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.21–4.49, p = 0.011,
Figs. 3a). The cumulative OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years in
the SR and TACE+RFA groups were 89.2, 69.4 and
61.2% and 81.3, 50.0 and 26.8%, respectively (Figs. 3a).
In the SR group versus TACE group after PSM (Table
2), 140 patients underwent SR, and 87 patients received
TACE. Patients undergoing SR had significantly higher

(HR: 3.10; 95% CI: 2.15–4.46, p < 0.0001, Figs. 3b). The
cumulative OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years in the SR and
TACE groups were 89.2, 69.4 and 61.2% and 70.1, 36.3
and 15.7%, respectively (Figs. 3b).
In the TACE+RFA group versus TACE group after PSM
(Table 3), 56 patients received TACE+RFA, and 231 patients received TACE. Patients undergoing TACE+RFA
had significantly higher survival rates than patients receiving TACE treatments (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.22–2.56, p =
0.002, Figs. 3c). The cumulative OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years
in the TACE+RFA and TACE groups were 85.7, 57.1 and
37.7% and 73.5, 37.0 and 15.2%, respectively (Figs. 3c).
Discussion
Patients with BCLC stage B are recommended to receive
TACE based on the BCLC system [2–4]. Our study
showed that the SR group had higher OS than the
TACE+RFA and TACE groups in BCLC stage B. Furthermore, the TACE+RFA group had higher OS than
the TACE group. After PSM, the SR group still had
higher OS than the TACE+RFA and TACE groups. In
addition, the TACE+RFA group also had higher OS than
the TACE group. SR should be considered a recommended treatment for select HCC patients in BCLC
stage B.
TACE is recommended as a standard of care for
the treatment of patients with BCLC stage B disease
[2–4]. Several HCC experts have proposed four substages based on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance, CP class, and “up-to-7” criteria
within BCLC stage B disease [11]. However, these criteria mostly indicate benefits from TACE. Based on
the great improvements in surgical techniques and
perioperative care, some treatments may not be suitable for patients with BCLC stage B HCC. Our results

showed that SR resulted in a significantly higher OS
rate than TACE+RFA and TACE in patients with
BCLC stage B disease. Similarly, several studies from
both Western and Eastern countries have demonstrated that SR results had higher long-term survival
than nonsurgical treatments, even for patients with
multiple tumors [6, 7, 12–14]. Furthermore, compared
with TACE, SR significantly increases survival in select patients with BCLC stage B HCC [7]. Therefore,
SR is a safe and effective therapy for select patients
with resectable single or multiple HCC lesions and
preserved liver function. Hence, SR may be recommended for select patients with BCLC stage B
disease.
A previous study showed that TACE+RFA is safe and
as effective as SR for patients with HCC within the
Milan criteria and BCLC stage B [6, 10]. Our study demonstrated that the SR group had a higher OS than the
TACE+RFA group, although the SR group had larger
tumor sizes but fewer tumor numbers than the
TACE+RFA group. After PSM with sex, age, tumor size,
tumor number, cirrhosis, and CP class, the SR group still
had higher OS than the TACE+RFA group. Our study
first demonstrated that SR has a significantly higher OS
than TACE+RFA in the literature. Indeed, SR may be
considered for select patients who fit these criteria and
could be recommended for patients with BCLC stage B
disease.
Our study showed that the TACE+RFA group had a
higher OS than the TACE group, although the
TACE+RFA group had smaller tumor sizes and more
tumor numbers than the TACE group. After PSM, the
TACE+RFA group still had a higher OS than the TACE
group. Our study is consistent with previous studies
showing that TACE+RFA has a better OS than TACE in
BCLC stage B [6, 8, 9]. Hence, combination TACE and
RFA treatment may be considered for select patients
who were multiple tumors with smaller tumor sizes and
could be recommended for patients with BCLC stage B
disease.
Our study has several limitations. First, we did not
take into consideration comorbidity and antiviral therapy
on OS. Second, we did not consider the possible differences in TACE cycles. Third, as with all retrospective
studies, there was some selection bias despite our use of
PSM. Furthermore, a randomized study between the different treatments will be performed.
Conclusions
The SR group had higher OS than the TACE+RFA and
TACE groups. Furthermore, the TACE+RFA group had
higher OS than the TACE group in BCLC stage B.
