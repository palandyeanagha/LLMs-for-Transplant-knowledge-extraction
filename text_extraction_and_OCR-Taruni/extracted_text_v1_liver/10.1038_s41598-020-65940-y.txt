To date, there are few studies that have evaluated the prognostic impact of changes in abdominal 
obesity or weight on long-term adverse kidney outcomes in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
We investigated the efect of changes in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and body weight (BW) on chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) development, especially in non-obese NAFLD patients. We included 6,137 
participants from a community-based prospective cohort with 12-year follow-up in Korea. NAFLD 
patients were categorized according to time-averaged percent changes in WHR and BW (≤−5%, 
>−5% to <5%, and ≥5%). Compared to non-obese controls, non-obese NAFLD was signifcantly 
associated with an increased risk of incident CKD (hazard ratio [HR]=1.238, 95% confdence interval 
[CI]=1.006–1.524). In 1,563 NAFLD patients, compared to patients with minimal changes in WHR 
(>−5% to <5%), patients with a decreased WHR (≤−5%) had a signifcantly attenuated risk of CKD 
development (HR=0.300; 95% CI=0.194–0.464). Furthermore, risk reduction from decreased WHR for 
developing CKD remained signifcant in non-obese NAFLD patients (HR=0.290; 95% CI=0.114–0.736). 
In conclusion, a decrease in WHR of more than 5% signifcantly reduced the risk of CKD development in 
NAFLD patients, even in those who were non-obese. Thus, serial monitoring of WHR may be prioritized 
in the management of NAFLD.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major chronic liver disease and a common cause of hepatocellular 
carcinoma and liver transplantation1,2
. Te incidence and prevalence of NAFLD have continuously increased, 
and are a growing concern for global public health3
. Obesity is an established key factor for development and 
progression of NAFLD4
. However, NAFLD can develop even in a patient who is not obese, known as “non-obese 
NAFLD”5–10. Several studies have examined the metabolic profle or cardiovascular outcomes of non-obese or 
lean NAFLD patients, but have shown mixed results5–16. Meanwhile, emerging evidence has revealed that NAFLD 
is implicated in not only liver-related complications but also extra-hepatic complications including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD)3,17–21. Although CKD is an important extra-hepatic complication of NAFLD17,19–21, the clinical implication of non-obese NAFLD on kidney function has not been fully 
explored. Terefore, in the present study, we explored the metabolic characteristics of patients with non-obese 
NAFLD compared to obese NAFLD and non-obese healthy participants and determined the prognostic impact 
of non-obese NAFLD on adverse kidney outcomes.
To date, signifcant and sustained weight reduction is a crucial treatment strategy in patients with NAFLD22–24
and is also considered important in non-obese NAFLD patients9,10,15,25. Te benefcial efect of weight reduction has been explained by its close association with regional body fat distribution, especially visceral fat9,10,13. 
Moreover, a recent study demonstrates that patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis treated with a year of lifestyle modifcation including weight reduction  were associated with an improvement in liver histology and kidney 
function20. Tese fndings led us to investigate whether changes in abdominal fat can afect the risk of long-term 
adverse kidney outcomes in non-obese NAFLD patients. To address this issue, we explored the independent 
association between changes in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a useful anthropometric index for central obesity, and

considered respectively, the prevalence of NAFLD was 12.9% (459/3,554) in non-obese participants and 42.7% 
(1,104/2,583) in obese participants.
Metabolic profles of non-obese NAFLD patients. We compared clinical and metabolic characteristics 
between the non-obese NAFLD and obese NAFLD groups (Table 2). Te WHR, blood pressure, total cholesterol, 
low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and C-reactive protein concentrations were lower in the non-obese NAFLD 
than obese NAFLD group, but homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was similar. 
Approximately 80% of non-obese NAFLD patients had metabolic syndrome (MS), which was a signifcantly 
higher prevalence than in the non-obese controls (10.1%, P<0.001) (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, 
non-obese NAFLD patients had greater values across the all individual components of MS, including WHR, 
blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipid profles, and HOMA-IR than in the non-obese controls. In terms of baseline 
kidney function, eGFR was not diferent between non-obese NAFLD and non-obese controls, but was higher 
than the obese NAFLD group.
Risk of incident CKD in non-obese NAFLD. During a mean follow-up duration of 116.3±40.3 months, 
CKD developed in 1,258 patients (20.5%) (Table 3). Te incidence rate of CKD was the lowest (1.79 per 100 
person-years; 17.7%) in the non-obese control group and the highest (3.06 per 100 person-years; 28.5%) in the 
obese NAFLD group. In the non-obese NAFLD group, CKD developed in 26.1% patients and the incidence rate 
of CKD was 2.83 per 100 person-years. Compared to the non-obese controls, non-obese NAFLD patients had a 
signifcantly higher risk of CKD development (hazard ratio [HR]=1.238; 95% confdence interval [CI]=1.006–
1.524; P=0.04) as well as obese NAFLD patients (HR=1.330; 95% CI=1.142–1.549; P<0.001).
Efect of changes in WHR on CKD development. NAFLD patients were categorized into three groups 
according to time averaged percent WHR change (TA-% WHR change) or time averaged percent body weight 
change (TA-% BW change) (≤−5%, >−5% to <5%, and ≥5%), respectively (Supplementary Table 2). To ascertain the independent association between WHR changes and CKD development in NAFLD, multivariable Cox 
regression analyses were performed (Fig. 1). In all NAFLD patients, compared to patients with minimal changes in 
WHR (>−5% to <5%), patients with TA-% WHR change≤−5% showed a 70% lower risk of CKD development

(HR=0.300; 95% CI=0.194–0.464; P<0.001). Moreover, a signifcant risk reduction from decreased WHR 
(TA-%WHR change≤−5%) for developing CKD remained in non-obese NAFLD patients (HR=0.290; 95% 
CI=0.114–0.736; P=0.01), as well as obese NAFLD patients (HR=0.289; 95% CI=0.175–0.476; P<0.001).
Efect of changes in BW on CKD development. To test the independent efect of changes in BW on incident CKD in NAFLD patients, multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed (Fig. 2). NAFLD patients 
with a BW decrease more than 5% had a signifcantly decreased risk of CKD, compared with the minimal change 
group (HR=0.586; 95% CI=0.469–0.731; P<0.001; >−5% to <5% as reference). Furthermore, decreased risk 
for incident CKD from a mean weight loss of more than 5% was signifcant in both the obese NAFLD group 
(HR=0.610; 95% CI=0.471–0.790; P<0.001) and the non-obese NAFLD group (HR=0.492, 95% CI=0.313–
0.775; P=0.002).
Subgroup analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and 
insulin resistance. NAFLD patients were dichotomized by the median value of HOMA-IR, 2.17. Risk reduction 
from decreased WHR (TA-% WHR change≤−5%) or BW (TA-% BWchange ≤−5%) was consistently found in 
the non-diabetic, non-hypertensive, hypertensive, low HOMA-IR, and high HOMA-IR groups (Fig. 3).
Changes in insulin resistance according to WHR and BW changes. To verify the efect of WHR or 
BW changes on insulin resistance, we calculated the slope of HOMA-IR changes during follow-up (ΔHOMA-IR 
per year) according to TA-% WHR or BW categories (Supplementary Table 3). HOMA-IR did not difer among 
the three TA-% WHR change groups at baseline (P=0.63). HOMA-IR decreased in patients with a mean WHR 
decrease of more than 5% during follow-up (mean [95% CI]; −0.04 [−0.09 to 0.02] per year), but increased in 
the other two groups (0.04 [0.01 to 0.06] per year in TA-% WHR change>−5% to <5%; 0.19 [0.05 to 0.28] in 
TA-% WHR change ≥5%). Furthermore, there were signifcant diferences in the changes in HOMA-IR during 
the follow-up period among the three groups (P (group × time) <0.001) (Fig. 4). Tis trend was also observed in 
non-obese and obese NAFLD patients (both P (group × time) <0.001) (Supplementary Table 3). In terms of BW

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that not only obese NAFLD patients, but also non-obese NAFLD patients, 
had a signifcantly greater risk of CKD development. Furthermore, NAFLD patients with a decreased WHR of 
more than 5% during follow-up had a signifcantly attenuated risk of incident CKD. Of note, a signifcant risk 
reduction for CKD development provided by reduced WHR was evident in non-obese NAFLD as well as obese 
NAFLD patients. Tese fndings suggest that sustained reduction of abdominal fat may be a useful strategy to 
prevent adverse kidney outcomes in NAFLD patients, even in those who are non-obese.
Obesity is closely implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD4
. However, NAFLD can occur in subjects who 
are not obese (by region-specifc BMI cutof, BMI<25 kg/m2
 in Asian populations; <30 kg/m2 in non-Asian 
populations), which is known as “non-obese NAFLD”6–10. Te prevalence of non-obese NAFLD in Korea ranged 
from 12.6% in a community-based study5
 to 27% in a health examination cohort6. Te prevalence of non-obese 
NAFLD in this study was 12.9% among non-obese participants, which is similar to a previous community-based 
study5
. In the current study, compared to obese NAFLD, non-obese NAFLD patients had a lower values for metabolic risk factors, including WHR, blood pressure, lipid profle, and C-reactive protein concentration. However, 
the majority of non-obese NAFLD patients had MS (approximately 80%), and all individual components of MS 
were signifcantly higher than in the non-obese controls. Tese fndings were in line with a recent meta-analysis16. 
Sookoian and Pirola16 indicated that lean NAFLD patients (BMI<23 kg/m2
 in Asian populations) shared a common altered metabolic and cardiovascular profle with obese NAFLD patients, and they exhibited a greater metabolic risk compared with lean controls.
Emerging evidence demonstrates that NAFLD is closely associated with the development of CKD17,19–21. A 
meta-analysis including nine observational studies of 96,595 adults revealed that patients with NAFLD had a 
higher risk of incident CKD than those without NAFLD21. Obese NAFLD patients can be easily predicted to have 
a greater CKD risk, because of their profound metabolic risk. However, the implication of non-obese NAFLD on 
adverse kidney outcomes has not been fully explored. In this study, we found that not only obese NAFLD, but also 
non-obese NAFLD patients, had a signifcantly higher risk of incident CKD compared with non-obese controls. 
Tere are several possible reasons that underlie the increased risk of CKD in non-obese NAFLD patients. First, 
our non-obese NAFLD patients had a high prevalence of MS. Because CKD is signifcantly associated with MS26, 
CKD may develop as a consequence of the adverse efects of MS, including insulin resistance27. In our study, 
HOMA-IR, a surrogate for insulin resistance, was greater in patients with non-obese NAFLD than non-obese 
controls (Supplementary Table 1, 2.42±1.96 vs. 1.28±0.59; P<0.001), but was similar to those with obese 
NAFLD (Table 2, P=0.17). Tis result suggests that systemic insulin resistance induced by MS may be an explanation for increased risk of CKD even in non-obese NAFLD. Meanwhile, the steatotic and infamed liver itself has 
been known to contribute to kidney injury in NAFLD28,29. In NAFLD and CKD, fetuin-A, a hepatokine, promotes 
endothelial dysfunction and vascular wall infammation of hepatic and glomerular endothelial cells, providing 
evidence for the role of an infamed liver28,29. When subjects were cross-categorized based on the combination 
of MS and NAFLD in this study, the incidence rate of CKD was lowest in the non-MS and non-NAFLD groups 
(15.9%), followed by the group with NAFLD but no MS (18.7%), the group with MS but no NAFLD (27.8%), and 
was highest in patients with both MS and NAFLD (29.0%) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Although this result suggests

the efect of MS overwhelms the efect of NAFLD, because we did not measure hepatokines, we did not determine 
the role of an infamed liver on CKD development in this study. Future studies are necessary to clarify the pathogenesis and mechanism by which non-obese NAFLD contributes to a higher risk of incident CKD.
Another main fnding was that decreased BW and WHR signifcantly reduced the risk of incident CKD even 
in non-obese NAFLD patients. Although numerous studies indicate that signifcant and sustained weight reduction is benefcial to NAFLD development and disease progression22,23, few studies evaluate the impact of weight 
loss on kidney function in the NAFLD population20. A post hoc analysis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients 
demonstrated that those with a signifcant weight loss (>5%) were more likely to have improved or stabilized 
eGFR at the end of a 52-week life style modifcation training20. In the current study, patients with TA-% BW 
change≤−5% during follow-up showed roughly half the risk for CKD development and the beneft of weight loss 
was also signifcant in the non-obese NAFLD group. Previous studies suggest that weight loss may be helpful even 
in non-obese NAFLD9,10,15,25. One possible explanation for these fndings is a reduction in visceral fat9,10,13. In this 
regard, it is noteworthy that decreased WHR, a useful anthropometric index of central obesity, was signifcantly 
associated with lower risk of incident CKD even in non-obese NAFLD patients in the present study. Obesity, 
especially central obesity, increases various pro-infammatory molecules such as adipokines, interleukin-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor alpha, leading to the development of systemic insulin resistance26,27. Systemic insulin resistance is known to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of CKD30. From these fndings, we hypothesized 
that insulin resistance may change according to WHR or BW changes. In this study, HOMA-IR, a surrogate of 
insulin resistance, decreased in the reduced WHR group, but increased in the minimal change group and the 
increased WHR group during the follow-up period. Terefore, we surmised that improvement in systemic insulin 
resistance caused by decreased abdominal fat might contribute to the reduced risk of CKD development in the 
reduced WHR groups, even in the non-obese NAFLD population. Moreover, considering the hazard ratio for

(≤−5%) (A) and TA-% BW (≤−5%) (B) were calculated afer adjustment for age, sex, education, income, 
smoking status, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of cardiovascular disease, C-reactive protein 
concentrations, and baseline eGFR. HOMA-IR group was dichotomized by the median value of HOMA-IR.

CKD development, risk reduction due to decreased WHR outweighed those from BW loss in our study. Tus, 
we speculated that reducing abdominal fat strategies might be benefcial for improving kidney outcomes in these 
populations. Another potential mechanism may be through improvement of NAFLD per se induced by weight 
loss. Jin et al.
25 reported that a 5% reduction in weight was signifcantly associated with steatosis improvement 
in non-obese NAFLD patients. Unfortunately, because liver biopsy was not available in our study, the efect of 
changes on liver histology cannot be determined. Future studies evaluating the association between histologic 
improvement and central obesity and their efects on long-term kidney outcomes are worthy of investigation.
Tis study has several limitations. First, we determined the presence of NAFLD using a prediction model 
rather than liver imaging (ultrasonography) or liver biopsy. Because a non-invasive prediction model of liver 
fbrosis cannot completely refect liver infammation or fbrosis of NAFLD on a histologic exam, this fnding 
should be considered cautiously. Because this study was a community-based cohort study that included the general population, the high cost of liver imaging and the invasiveness of liver biopsy limited their application in our 
study participants. Terefore, NAFLD was determined using the NAFLD liver fat score, which is a non-invasive 
and validated index that has been replicated in previous studies31. Although lack of liver imaging or biopsy is a 
limitation of this study, using a prediction model may be more valuable in translating our fndings to real world 
practice. Second, the WHR and BW changes observed in our study may not have been intentional. We could not 
defnitively determine whether loss or gain of WHR and BW was intentional or spontaneous, due to the observational nature of this study. Terefore, therapeutic WHR or BW reduction to prevent CKD should be further 
tested in a prospective randomized controlled study. In the present study, we included various confounders in 
multivariable models and subgroup analyses were performed. When mean arterial pressure and liver fbrosis 
score, signifcant risk factors for CKD, were added to multivariable models, risk reduction from decreased WHR 
or BW was not changed (Supplementary Table 4). Subgroup analyses also showed consistent results, but not in 
diabetic patients. We suggest our small number of diabetic patients limits this study’s statistical power. However, 
residual confounding efects cannot be totally excluded. We cannot clarify the efect of lifestyle modifcation, 
medication, or bariatric surgery on weight changes in this study. Nevertheless, this study includes strongly convincing data, obtained from a large general population in a well-examined longitudinal study. Te small number

of subjects and short follow-up period of previous studies limited their ability to ascertain clinically signifcant 
kidney outcomes. Inclusion of proteinuria data and a relatively long follow-up of 12 years allowed us to ascertain 
the risk of adverse kidney outcomes thoroughly. Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the frst study to 
provide evidence for the benefcial efect of reduced WHR on long-term adverse kidney outcomes in non-obese 
NAFLD patients.
In conclusion, non-obese NAFLD patients were at a high risk of adverse kidney outcomes. A decrease in 
WHR, more than an average of 5% during the follow-up, was associated with signifcant risk reduction of CKD 
development in NAFLD patients, even though they were not obese. Based on these fndings, we speculate that 
reducing abdominal fat may be a benefcial strategy to attenuate the increased risk of adverse kidney outcomes 
in NAFLD patients. Terefore, education for lifestyle modifcation and serial monitoring of WHR and kidney 
function should be prioritized in the management of NAFLD patients, even if they are non-obese.
Methods
Study design and participants. Participants from the Ansung-Ansan Cohort of the Korean Genome 
Epidemiology Study (KoGES) were screened in this study. Te KoGES is a community-based, prospective cohort 
study that includes 40- to 69-year-old Korean participants from the general population who lived in the rural 
Ansung or urban Ansan communities from 2001 to 2002. Afer a baseline survey, follow-up surveys were performed every 2 years, and the latest (6th) follow-up was performed between 2013 and 2014. Te detailed design 
and methods of the cohort have been previously described32. Among the initially enrolled 10,030 participants, a 
total of 6,137 participants were included in the current study (Supplementary Fig. 2). Tis study was conducted 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Te study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the 
Korean Center for Disease Control and the Institutional Review Board of CHA Bundang Medical Center. All 
participants provided written informed consent before entering the study.
Data collection. Demographics, clinical, and laboratory data were retrieved from the electronic database. 
Demographics including age, sex, socioeconomic status, medical history, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and 
alcohol consumption were recorded during the baseline survey and every follow-up examination using a standardized questionnaire administered by a well-trained research coordinator. A 12-h fasting blood sample and the 
frst-voided urine were analyzed to measure biochemical variables at the central laboratory. HOMA-IR was calculated33. MS was defned based on the modifed National Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Treatment Panel III 
criteria34. Te Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation was used to calculate eGFR35.
Assessment of changes in body weight and WHR. Anthropometric indices (height, BW, waist circumference, and hip circumference) were measured as recommended by the World Health Organization36. BMI 
was calculated as weight/height2
 (kg/m2) and WHR was calculated as waist circumference/hip circumference. 
Changes in BW and WHR were assessed using the percent change from baseline37. Percentage change of BW 
and WHR was calculated with the following equation: [(BW or WHR at each follow-up/BW or WHR of baseline)–1]× 100. To test the efect of changes during the follow-up, TA-% BW change and TA-% WHR change were 
calculated for each patient.
Follow-up and outcome. Participants were re-evaluated every 2 years with a site visit. Te primary outcome was development of CKD, defned as an eGFR of <60mL/min/1.73m2
 and/or proteinuria of more than 1+
on the dipstick, whichever occurred frst. Patients who were lost to follow up were censored at the date of the last 
examination (248 at the 2nd, 339 at the 3rd, 224 at the 4th, 306 at the 5th, and 436 at the 6th visit).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria; www.r-project.org). Continuous variables were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation or as 
the median (interquartile range), and categorical variables were expressed as a number (percentage). Participants 
were categorized as non-obese (BMI<25 kg/m2
) and obese (BMI≥25 kg/m2) groups by the recommendation 
for Asian and Pacifc populations38 and the clinical practice guidelines from the Korean Society for the Study 
of Obesity39. Te presence of NAFLD was defned as a NAFLD liver fat score of≥–0.64031 and FIB-4 score was 
calculated in the NAFLD patients40 (Supplementary Table 5). Baseline characteristics were compared using a 
Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and a χ2
 test for categorical variables between 
non-obese NAFLD and obese NAFLD or non-obese controls to assess metabolic characteristics of non-obese 
NAFLD patients. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the independent risk of non-obese 
NAFLD for CKD development. Multivariable Cox regression models included signifcant variables from univariate analyses including age, sex, education, income, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, 
history of cardiovascular disease, C-reactive protein concentration, and baseline eGFR. To test the prognostic 
impact of changes in abdominal fat and BW on CKD development in NAFLD participants, 1,563 NAFLD patients 
were categorized into three groups according to TA-% WHR change and TA-% BW change (≤−5%, >−5% to 
<5%, and ≥5%), respectively. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed for all NAFLD patients and 
subsequent stratifed analyses were performed for non-obese NAFLD and obese NAFLD patients. Furthermore, 
subgroup analyses according to diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and HOMA-IR concentrations were also performed. To explore the association of WHR or BW changes with insulin resistance, HOMA-IR values over time 
were compared among the TA-% WHR change and TA-% BW change groups using a mixed-efects model. Te 
average slope of HOMA-IR changes during the follow-up was also calculated (ΔHOMA-IR per year). A P value 
less than 0.05 was considered statistically signifcant.
