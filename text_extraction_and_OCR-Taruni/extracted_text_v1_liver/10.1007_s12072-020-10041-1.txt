Abstract
The Liver Transplant Society of India (LTSI) has come up with guidelines for transplant centres across the country to deal 
with liver transplantation during this evolving pandemic of COVID-19 infection. The guidelines are applicable to both 
deceased donor as well as living donor liver transplants. In view of the rapidly changing situation of COVID-19 infection in 
India and worldwide, these guidelines will need to be updated according to the emerging data.
Introduction
COVID-19 infection is caused by the novel coronavirus 
named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) that was frst reported in Hubei, Wuhan 
province of China in December 2019 [1]. This illness 
is rapidly spreading throughout the world and more than 
199 countries across the globe have been documented to 
have this infection. The World Health Organisation (WHO) 
declared COVID-19 as global Pandemic on March 11, 2020. 
There is a huge amount of emerging data almost on a daily 
basis which makes it difcult to summarise the information 
on a given time point.
The disease transmission is primarily by human to human 
contact, with droplet route being the principal mode of 
spread [2]. Recent evidence has not completely ruled out the 
possibility of airborne spread [2]. In addition, the virus has 
been shown to be present in faeces even after the respiratory 
samples become negative [3]. Transmission has been shown 
to occur during the incubation period and from asymptomatic infected persons.
The estimated case fatality ratio thus far is approximately 
2%, but the true ratio may vary [4]. Mortality appears to be 
age dependent, with the highest rates among older adults 
(Age 50–59: 1.3%, 60–69: 3.6%, 70–79: 8%, 80+: 14.8%)
[5].
General comments in relation to liver 
transplantation
There is a concern that immunocompromised patients are at 
a greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 
infection, although data on liver transplant patients is limited 
at present [6]. It is anticipated that transplant recipients may 
have a greater viral burden and shedding resulting in greater 
infectivity and potential spread to other individuals, including healthcare workers. There is a risk of donor to recipient 
transmission of COVID-19, both from deceased donors and 
living donors. The risk of donor-derived infection would 
depend upon donor exposure, infectivity in the incubation 
period, degree and duration of viremia, and viability of the 
virus within blood or specifc organ compartments [7].

COVID-19 virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the 
inoculum shed) [8]. This raises the concern of nosocomial 
spread and superspreading events. In addition, patient-topatient and patient-to-healthcare worker infection have been 
described. Whether COVID-19 can be transmitted parenterally is not known, nevertheless, screening of all blood donors 
should be done. Preventing transmission from an infected 
patient to a healthcare worker and vice versa is of great 
importance. Current recommendations are for both droplet 
and airborne precautions for infection control in the hospital 
setting. In general, for the society emphasis should be given 
on recommended preventive measures against COVID-19 
namely social distancing, frequent hand washing, cleaning 
frequently touched surfaces, following cough etiquettes, etc.
The impact of immunosuppression in the post-transplant 
setting is currently not known and further data is needed 
before any specific recommendation can be made. It is 
expected that due to immunosuppression post-transplant, 
infected patients may have more intense and prolonged shedding of virus. This will also increase the risk of viral transmission among healthcare workers. Antivirals for COVID19 will be available in very near future, and drug–drug 
interactions with immunosuppressive medications will also 
need to be considered.
Need for liver transplant guidelines in India
There is an immediate need of guidelines for liver transplantation in India, both in deceased donor (DDLT) and living 
donor (LDLT) centres. These guidelines were formulated 
following a consensus executive meeting of the Liver Transplant Society of India (LTSI) held on March 22, 2020. The 
guidelines have the approval of the LTSI executive committee. These guidelines have been incorporated as national 
guidelines by the Indian Council of Medical Research 
(ICMR) on March 28, 2020.
Guidelines for issues specifc to liver 
transplant in India
It was decided to formulate working advisory for various 
situations that are encountered by the liver transplant centres 
with an emphasis on the issues that are unique to India.
A. Status of doing liver transplant.
 This is among the most important issue as any liver 
transplant related activity not only involves the donor 
and the recipient, but it involves a whole lot of individuals including doctors, paramedical staf, nurses, and 
patient attendants. To minimise the risk of COVID-19 
exposure in the hospital setting, it was decided that liver 
transplant will be done judiciously as per the following 
criteria:
1. Moratorium on all non-urgent transplants till April 
14, 2020 (which is likely to change as per the evolving situation of COVID-19 in India).
2. Acute liver failure (ALF)—can be done as usual 
after medical therapy has failed. Standard indications for patient selection in ALF to be followed.
3. Acute on Chronic Liver failure (ACLF with organ 
failure—decision for transplantation should be 
based on individual centre’s discretion. Standard 
indications for patient selection in ACLF to be followed.
B. Deceased donor liver transplant (DDLT).
1. Elective DDLT should be done only if donor is 
COVID-19 negative, and recipient is from the 
same city. Air travel should be avoided. However, 
with current National lockdown and a ban on both 
domestic and international travel, DDLT will need 
to be limited to the same city.
C. Living donor liver transplant (LDLT).
1. LDLT should be done for urgent cases after thorough counselling as LDLT imposes a risk on the 
healthy donor with hospital admission. LDLT also 
exposes the various potential donors who may need 
to be screened with the intent of liver donation.
D. Testing for COVID-19.
1. All donors (deceased and living donor) and recipients should be tested for COVID-19 at the time of 
urgent transplant. The testing should be done as per 
standard guidelines by the individual centres, and 
from approved laboratories. It is expected that the 
turnaround time for the test will be reduced shortly.
E. Immunosuppression strategy.
 Although there is a concern that organ transplant 
patients may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, 
there is no evidence as of now to modify the immunosuppression protocol. Standard immunosuppression 
should be followed in the post-transplant period till further data is available.
F. Follow up post-transplant.
1. Patients should follow up with their respective centres as usual. It is strongly encouraged that patient 
should avoid hospital visits for routine follow up and 
consult online via telemedicine.

2. However, those patients with post-transplant emergencies should attend hospital as usual and should 
be provided with necessary standard care by the 
transplant team.
3. Recipients with symptoms such as fever, cough 
and breathing difficulty should be evaluated for 
suspected COVID-19 infection as per the national 
guidelines.
G. Care of sick recipients on waitlist.
1. The management of recipients for various medical complications to be continued in the hospital, 
including ICU admissions.
H. Prophylactic medications for COVID-19.
1. At present, there is no recommendation for prophylactic medications or vaccinations for transplant patients. However, newer medications against 
COVID-19 are likely to be available soon.
I. Advisory for transplant recipients for COVID-19.
1. All transplant recipients should be sent an advisory 
from the respective transplant centre regarding various do’s and don’ts for the prevention of COVID-19 
infection.
J. Testing of transplant professionals.
1. This should be done selectively if there has been a 
positive case of COVID-19 in the concerned hospital.
Summary
These guidelines provide a direction to the transplant centres 
across the country to deal with liver transplantation during 
this evolving pandemic of COVID-19. The guidelines are 
applicable to both deceased donor as well as living donor 
liver transplants. However, it should be noted that the present 
situation of COVID-19 infection is changing rapidly in India 
and worldwide, and new data is emerging frequently. Hence 
these guidelines will need to be updated accordingly.
