Abstract
Background
Androgen excess is a defining feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which affects
10% of women and represents a lifelong metabolic disorder, with increased risk of type 2
diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular events. Previous studies have suggested an
increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in individuals with PCOS and
implicated androgen excess as a potential driver.
Methods and findings
We carried out a retrospective longitudinal cohort study utilizing a large primary care
database in the United Kingdom, evaluating NAFLD rates in 63,120 women with PCOS
and 121,064 age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and location-matched control women registered from January 2000 to May 2016. In 2 independent cohorts, we also determined the
rate of NAFLD in women with a measurement of serum testosterone (n = 71,061) and sex
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; n = 49,625). We used multivariate Cox models to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for NAFLD and found that women with PCOS had an increased rate of NAFLD (HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.86–2.66, p < 0.001), also after adjusting for BMI
or dysglycemia. Serum testosterone >3.0 nmol/L was associated with an increase in
NAFLD (HR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.16–4.53, p = 0.017 for 3–3.49 nmol/L and HR = 2.40, 95%
CI 1.24–4.66, p = 0.009 for >3.5 nmol/L). Mirroring this finding, SHBG <30 nmol/L was
associated with increased NAFLD hazard (HR = 4.75, 95% CI 2.44–9.25, p < 0.001 for

Conclusions
We found that women with PCOS have an increased rate of NAFLD. In addition to increased
BMI and dysglycemia, androgen excess contributes to the development of NAFLD in women
with PCOS. In women with PCOS-related androgen excess, systematic NAFLD screening
should be considered.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 10% of women and is defined by androgen
excess, chronic anovulation, and polycystic appearance of the ovaries on ultrasound.
• PCOS is not only a reproductive but also a lifelong metabolic disorder with increased
rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular events.
• Recent research has shown rates of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be
higher in women with PCOS and that androgens may play a causative role in its
pathogenesis.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study utilizing a large UK primary care database and included more than 63,000 women with PCOS and 121,000
matched controls registered between 2000 and 2016.
• We found that rates of NAFLD were increased in women with PCOS.
• We found that even normal-weight women with PCOS had an increased rate of
NAFLD.
• In addition to body mass index and dysglycemia, we identified androgen excess as a
potential additional contributing risk factor for NAFLD development in PCOS.
• We also studied 2 independent cohorts drawn from the same primary care database
who had serum testosterone (n = 71,000) or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG,
n = 49,000) measured and found that women with biochemical evidence of androgen
excess (high testosterone, low SHBG) had an increased rate of NAFLD.

What do these findings mean?
• Our findings indicate there may be an increased risk of NAFLD in women with PCOS
and that androgen excess is a factor underlying that risk.
• Screening for NAFLD should be considered in women with PCOS-related androgen
excess.
• Future studies will need to determine if androgen excess also drives progression to liver
inflammation and fibrosis and to establish whether antiandrogen medication can reduce
the risk of NAFLD.
Introduction
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of
reproductive age, affecting 6%–10% of women worldwide [1]. Diagnostic criteria include the
presence of androgen excess, oligomenorrhea, and evidence of polycystic ovaries (PCO) on
ultrasound [2]. Though conventionally perceived as a reproductive disorder, PCOS is now
emerging as a lifelong metabolic disorder, with evidence of increased prevalence of obesity,
insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome [3]. However, the metabolic disease burden in
patients with PCOS exceeds that observed in simple obesity [4]. Androgen excess has been
implicated as a distinct risk factor, with several studies showing circulating androgen burden
to correlate closely with surrogate markers of metabolic risk, independent of body mass index
(BMI) [5–7].
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a hepatic complication of the metabolic syndrome, with global NAFLD prevalence rising to epidemic proportions in recent years [8]. It
encompasses a continuous spectrum of morphological changes in the liver, from simple
hepatic steatosis, continuing to the stage of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with prevailing inflammation, and eventually progressing to irreversible hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis [9].
Overall, patients with NAFLD have increased mortality due to an increased risk of cardiometabolic complications and death from liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [10]. NAFLD is
now the second most prevalent indication for liver transplantation in the United States [11].
There is a clear association between NAFLD risk, insulin resistance and obesity. Adipose tissue
is thought to be the principal contributor of free fatty acids and systemic lipotoxicity underpinning the development of hepatic steatosis [12].
Given the shared risk factors between PCOS and NAFLD, there is a strong interest in exploring the relationship between the 2 conditions, both in terms of prevalence and shared pathophysiological mechanisms. A systematic review of 7 studies, involving mostly small cohorts with
less than 60 patients, reported an estimated 4-fold increased risk of NAFLD among patients
with PCOS compared to controls [13]. Similarly, 2 small cross-sectional studies found significant associations between NAFLD and PCOS [14,15]. Following the publication of some preliminary evidence [16], 2 recent studies and a very recent meta-analysis have implicated androgen
excess as a potentially BMI-independent risk factor for NAFLD in PCOS [17–19].
Our study aimed to comprehensively investigate the excess incidence of NAFLD in patients
with PCOS, assess if the excess risk was independent of their BMI status, and explore the
potential role of androgen excess as an independent risk factor in the development of NAFLD,
by undertaking a longitudinal study drawing from a large and diverse population base.

Methods
The study followed the preanalysis study plan (S1 Text) and is reported as per Strengthening
the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (S2 Text).
Study design
This is a population-based retrospective cohort study to determine the association between
PCOS (exposure) and NAFLD (outcome) and to assess predictors of NAFLD within the PCOS
group. Independent cohorts were separately created to explore the association of biomarkers
of androgen excess (serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG]) with
NAFLD risk (S2 Fig).
Setting
Data for this study were derived from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database, a
UK general practice electronic database. THIN data are generated from longitudinal data documented in electronic medical records by general practitioners for clinical and management
purposes during each episode of consultations using Read codes, a hierarchical coding system
for structured storage of information [20]. More than 675 practices, scattered representatively
around UK, contribute data to THIN, covering 3.7 million active patients (6%–7% of UK population) [21]. THIN data are generalizable for the UK for major health conditions [22] and
have been used for studies involving women with PCOS [23] and patients with NAFLD [24].
Participants
Women aged 18 to 50 years at study entry were eligible to take part in the study. Patients with
any documentation of excess alcohol use were excluded. Excess alcohol use was determined by
Read codes indicative of hazardous drinking or diseases related to hazardous drinking (e.g.,
alcoholic liver disease). The exposed group comprised eligible women with a diagnosis of
PCOS at any time during the study period. The nonexposed group comprised eligible women
who did not have a documented diagnosis of PCOS and were matched within the same practice for age (±1 year) and BMI (±2 kg/m2
) of each woman with PCOS. Age and BMI were used
as matching variables because of their strong association with PCOS and NAFLD [25,26].
Where there were several patients who could be matched, for each exposed patient 2 were randomly selected.
Study period
Our study period extended from 1 January 2000 (study start date) to 15 May 2016 (study end
date). The follow-up start date for an indexed patient (index date) in the exposed group was
set at first documentation of PCOS once a patient was eligible to take part in the study (newly
diagnosed patients) or set as the date a patient became eligible to take part in the study, if they
already had a diagnosis of PCOS (patients with an existing diagnosis) (S1 Fig). The same index
date was assigned for their matched corresponding unexposed patients to mitigate immortality
time bias [27]. The earliest of transfer date (when patient left the practice), death date, first
documentation of outcome—i.e., NAFLD—(outcome date), or study end date were considered
as the follow-up end date (exit date).
PCOS definition
High similarity between “PCOS” and “polycystic ovaries (PCO)” increases the possibility of
misclassification between these 2 during data entry. However, prevalence studies based on

primary care data suggest that both combined together reflect true prevalence [23]. Therefore,
primary analysis included both, while sensitivity analysis was carried out with codes reflecting
PCOS only.
Though limitations exist in documentation of the 3 features (ovulatory dysfunction, androgen excess, and PCO) used in the diagnosis of PCOS, these were captured where available. We
considered clinical androgen excess as present if clinical features commonly accepted as indicative of clinically relevant androgen excess in women (hirsutism, alopecia, or acne) were
documented.
Outcome
Our primary outcome was incidence of NAFLD.
Independent cohorts to explore the role of androgen excess in the
development of NAFLD
Two cohorts independent of the primary PCOS cohort were constructed to test the hypothesis
that androgen excess has a role in women developing NAFLD. The first cohort comprised any
woman with a serum testosterone measurement, and the second one comprised any woman
with a serum SHBG measurement. This was essential as androgen excess features (acne, hirsutism, and hair loss) and biomarkers of androgen excess were not sufficiently documented
within the PCOS cohort and therefore did not have adequate power to detect an association
(S1 and S2 Tables). Both cohorts had similar entry and exit requirements as the primary cohort
study (S1 Fig).
Selection of read codes and drug codes for the cohort exposure, outcome,
and covariates
Variables for PCOS, NAFLD, and covariates were defined using published methodologies [28],
definitions noted in previous publications [23,24], and our own systematic search process for
codes (S3 and S4 Tables). PCOS was defined using Read codes for polycystic ovary syndrome
[23] and polycystic ovaries [29]. The outcome variable NAFLD was defined using nonalcoholic
fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Read codes [24]. Other potential confounders and
covariates were informed by previous literature and included the Townsend index of deprivation [30,31], diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose regulation (IGR, includes impaired fasting
glucose [IFG; defined as fasting plasma glucose 6.1–6.9 mmol/L] and impaired glucose tolerance [IGT; defined as plasma glucose 7.8–11.1 mmol/L measured 120 minutes after ingestion of
75 g glucose in the oral glucose tolerance test]), hypothyroidism, metformin use, and lipid-lowering medications [23,32]. Predictor variables were also selected for analysis restricted to
women with PCOS only. These included Read codes for hirsutism, acne, and alopecia and medication codes for cyproterone acetate, drospirenone, and other antiandrogen medications.
Grouping of quantitative variables
BMI (in kg/m2) was categorized into <25, 25 to 30, and >30 kg/m2 as per the WHO recommendation for obesity measurement (normal weight, overweight, and obese).
Statistical methods
The basic characteristics of participants, including covariates, were summarized by exposure
status using appropriate summary measures. No statistical significance testing was performed

to show any difference between the patients with PCOS and the control patients at baseline, in
line with good practice [33,34].
Primary analysis and sensitivity analysis. Crude hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated, followed by adjusted estimates using Cox-regression models. We reported the HR estimates with
95% confidence intervals. Covariates in Cox models for main analysis included age, BMI category, Townsend category, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus status. Diabetes status at
baseline and follow-up were both used in separate analyses. Analyses were undertaken using
diabetes status during follow-up as a covariate to assess the impact of PCOS on the development of NAFLD not associated with the development of diabetes. Analyses were also undertaken by excluding patients with diabetes and IGR at baseline and by censoring when they
developed diabetes or IGR subsequently during follow-up. This enabled us to assess if the hazard of developing NAFLD was independent of the subsequent development of diabetes or
IGR.
Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the possibility of bias due to case definition
(PCOS and PCO versus PCOS codes only) and survival bias due to including prevalent cases
with PCOS (diagnosed with PCOS before meeting eligibility criteria) in the analysis [35].
Analysis to assess if NALFD risk in women with PCOS was independent of BMI. First,
we conducted a subgroup analysis within each BMI category to assess if the NALFD risk was
independent of BMI status. In addition, interaction terms were used to assess possible interaction between the exposure (PCOS/PCO) and BMI categories and their combined effect on
NAFLD risk.
Analysis to explore if androgen excess in women with PCOS confers a risk for
NALFD. Firstly, we introduced the clinical androgen excess features into the primary model
to see if it attenuated the effect size. A subsequent analysis limited to exposed patients was carried out to identify predictors of NAFLD in women with PCOS with phenotypes and antiandrogenic medications as covariates in addition to previously stated covariates. These 2 analyses
were limited given that only a third of patients had their androgen excess features
documented.
Finally, we carried out an analysis of the 2 independent cohorts (women with a serum testosterone measurement or an SHBG measurement, respectively). Serum SHBG and testosterone categories were derived based on clinically meaningful cutoff values and by consensus
among the study group to demonstrate any dose response relationship. Serum SHBG concentrations were categorized into <20, 20–29.99, 30–39.99, 40–40.99, 50–59.99, and 60 nmol/L,
and serum testosterone concentrations were categorized into <1, 1–1.49, 1.5–1.99, 2–2.49,
2.5–2.99, 3–3.49, and 3.5 nmol/L. Association between these hormonal levels and NAFLD
was assessed using Cox regression models adjusting for potential covariates. All data cleaning
and analysis were carried out using STATA MP version 14.2.
Ethical approval
The use of the THIN data for research was approved by the South-East Multicenter Research
Ethics Committee in 2003 [36] without the need for informed consent. As per requirement of
the ethical approval, further registration and authorization for this project were obtained from
the relevant Scientific Review Committee (17THIN026).
Results
Study population characteristics
The study population included 63,210 women with PCOS and 121,064 women without PCOS,
matched for age, BMI, and general practice (Fig 1). Both cohorts were followed up for a

were eligible for inclusion in the study, with a total of 2,706,062 women for the study period 2000–2016. A total of
64,787 women were listed as having PCOS according to the criteria defined in the “Methods” section. Controls were
randomly matched to women with PCOS at a ratio of 2:1 within each practice, generating a random control cohort of
123,928 women. Participants with a documented history of alcohol excess were excluded; therefore, the final cohort
consisted of 63,120 women with PCOS and 121,064 controls.

smoking status between groups. At baseline, women with PCOS were more likely to have diabetes (2.2% versus 1.4% in controls), hypertension (3.1% versus 2.4%), and hypothyroidism
(3.9% versus 2.5%) (Table 1). During follow-up, 2.1% of women in the PCOS cohort developed
diabetes in comparison to 1.1% of women in the unexposed cohort.
Among the women with PCOS, 19,425 were defined based on the PCOS Read code, while
the remainder (n = 43,785) were defined based on a PCO Read code. In total, 20,162 women
had a diagnosis after joining the general practice and were categorized as incident cases. Among
women with PCOS, 34.5% of women had documented clinical features suggestive of androgen
excess (acne 21.7%, hirsutism 12.9%, and androgenetic alopecia 6.2%), and 29.3% had features
suggestive of oligoanovulation (Table 2). Before study entry or during follow-up, 29.4% of
women with PCOS (n = 18,583) took an oral contraceptive with an antiandrogenic progestin
component (cyproterone acetate 22.6% and drospirenone 12.1%), and 24% (n = 15,152) received
metformin treatment (Table 2).
Primary analysis
Women with PCOS were found to have an increased rate of NAFLD in comparison to matched controls without PCOS (HR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.99–2.84, p < 0.001). The incidence of
NAFLD in women with PCOS was 9.2 per 10,000 person years, while in the matched control

Polycystic ovary syndrome, female androgen excess, and risk of NAFLD
PLOS Medicine | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002542 March 28, 2018 9 / 20

Increasing age (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03–1.06, p < 0.001), BMI (BMI 25–30 kg/m2
,
HR = 3.37, 95% CI 2.36–4.83, p < 0.001; and BMI >30 kg/m2
, HR = 6.98, 95% CI 5.07–9.60,
p < 0.001), and diabetes or IGR (HR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.76–3.25, p < 0.001) at baseline were
also found to be significant independent factors associated with an increased rate of
NAFLD (S6 Table), with the impact of PCOS on NAFLD rate estimated to be of a similar
magnitude to the impact of diabetes and IGR.
Sensitivity analysis
Findings were robust when analysis was limited to PCOS codes only (adjusted HR = 2.10, 95%
CI 1.52–2.93, p < 0.001) and when limited to incident cases only (HR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.49–
2.87, p < 0.001) (Table 3).
Analysis to assess if NALFD risk in women with PCOS was independent of
BMI
In the subgroup analysis, women with PCOS were at increased risk of NAFLD in all 3 BMI subgroups (HR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.02–3.34, p = 0.043 in <25 kg/m2
; HR = 2.05, 95% CI 1.37–3.07,
p < 0.001 for 25–30 kg/m2
; and HR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.65–2.57, p < 0.001 for >30 kg/m2) (S7
Table). In the analysis with interaction terms for PCOS and BMI, women with PCOS and a
BMI of <25 kg/m2 had twice the risk of developing NAFLD (HR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.06–3.46,
p < 0.031), while women with PCOS with a BMI of 25–30 kg/m2 or >30 kg/m2 were, respectively, 7 times (HR = 6.75, 95% CI 4.10–11.10, p < 0.001) and 14 times (HR = 14.12, 95% CI
9.11–21.87, p < 0.001) more at risk compared to control women with a BMI less than 25 kg/m2
(Fig 2 and S8 Table).

Introducing androgen excess features into the primary model suggested a potential reduction
in the HR from 2.23 (95% CI 1.86–2.66) to 2.07 (95% CI 1.72–2.50) (S9 Table).
Clinical features associated with NAFLD in women with PCOS. Along with increasing
age, higher BMI and dysglycemia, anovulation (HR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.06–1.756, p = 0.02) and
clinical androgen excess features, hirsutism (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.06–1.870, p = 0.01) and alopecia (HR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.23–2.45, p = 0.02), but not acne (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.62–1.22,
p = 0.87), were found to be significantly associated with NAFLD within the women with PCOS
(Table 4). Antiandrogen therapy was associated with reduced hazard, but this did not reach
statistical significance (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.59–1.097, p = 0.16) (Table 4). Increasing age,
Townsend index of deprivation, higher BMI, hypothyroidism, and anovulation (HR = 1.60,
95% CI 1.16–2.20, p = 0.004) were found to be significantly associated with NAFD within
women without PCOS (S10 Table).
Analysis of the cohorts with serum testosterone and SHBG measurements
There were 71,061 eligible women with a measurement of serum testosterone (median age
31.8 years, IQR 25.9–38.1 years) (S2 Fig). Within this cohort, serum testosterone results
(nmol/l) were distributed as follows (concentration, %): <1, 33.7%; 1–1.49, 24.9%; 1.5–1.99,
19.0%; 2–2.49, 11.5%; 2.5–2.99, 5.7%; 3–3.49, 2.6%; and 3.5, 2.6% (S11 Table). Patients in

(adjusted HR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.24–4.66, p = 0.009) groups had increased rates of NAFLD (Fig
3A and S12, S13 and S14 Tables).
There were 49,625 eligible women with a measurement of serum SHBG (median age 30.4
years, IQR 24.9–36.6 years) (S2 Fig). Within this cohort, there were 9.2% in the <20 nmol/L
group, 15.3% in the 20–29.99 group, 16.0% in the 30–39.99, 14.4% in the 40–49.99, 11.7% in
the 50–59.99 and 33.6% in the 60 nmol/L groups (S15 Table). Patients with lower SHBG
(<30 nmol/L: adjusted HR = 4.98, 95% CI 2.45–10.11, p < 0.001; <20 nmol/L; adjusted
HR = 4.75, 95% CI 2.44–9.25, p < 0.001) had increased rates of NAFLD (Fig 3B, S16 and S17
Tables).
Discussion
The results of this study provide, to our knowledge, the most conclusive evidence to date that
women with PCOS have an increased rate of NAFLD above that conferred by simple obesity.
A previous meta-analysis of 7 studies with a combined sample size of less than 600 patients
suggested an almost 4-fold increase in the risk of NAFLD in women with PCOS compared
with matched controls [13]. A very recent meta-analysis that combined data of 2,700 patients
Fig 2. Impact of BMI and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on the hazard of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PCOS and control groups were
subcategorized into lean, overweight, and obese groups according to BMI, with lean control women designated as the reference category (unexposed, BMI <25
kg/m2
). The analysis is adjusted for age, Townsend score of social deprivation, diabetes or impaired glucose regulation, and hypothyroidism at baseline. The
hazard of NAFLD increased with BMI in both control women and women with PCOS. Lean women with PCOS had an almost 2-fold higher hazard of NAFLD
compared to lean controls. The highest hazard of developing NAFLD was observed in the obese PCOS cohort.

from 17 studies found a 2.5-fold increased risk of NAFLD in women with PCOS compared
with age- and BMI-matched controls [19]. To our knowledge, our population-based longitudinal cohort study is the first longitudinal and by far the largest study to examine the association
between PCOS and NAFLD, analyzing over 63,000 women with PCOS against 121,000
matched controls. A diagnosis of PCOS was consistently associated with a 2.0–2.4-fold
increase in rate of NAFLD in multiple adjusted analyses, and this increased hazard persisted
even when restricting to patients with PCOS. Intriguingly, even women with PCOS with a normal BMI had a significantly increased rate of NAFLD.
Within our PCOS cohort, androgen excess, anovulation, and dysglycemia independently
increased the hazard of developing NAFLD. The prevalence of androgen excess in our study is
likely to be an underestimate, as multiple studies have shown prevalence estimates as high as
80% in PCOS [5]. To mitigate this, we further probed the association between androgens and
NAFLD hazard by examining the impact of serum testosterone and SHBG levels on rate of
NAFLD in separate independent cohorts. The analysis of these 2 cohorts demonstrated that
female testosterone levels in excess of 3 nmol/L and SHBG levels below 30 nmol/L were associated with an increased rate of NAFLD.

The mechanisms underpinning the increased NAFLD rate in PCOS are likely to represent a
complex interplay between androgen excess, insulin resistance, and obesity [37]. However, our
data provide convincing evidence for an independent contribution from androgen excess. Several smaller studies have previously implicated androgen excess as associated with metabolic
dysfunction in women with PCOS [16,38,39]. Increasing free serum testosterone levels in premenopausal women was associated with NAFLD in midlife in a recent prospective study, independent of traditional risk factors such as insulin resistance, BMI, and dyslipidemia [40].
Similarly, a meta-analysis looking at 2,700 patients from 17 studies found that serum testosterone was higher in those women with PCOS who had NAFLD [19].
We have recently provided mechanistic evidence to the association between PCOS, androgen excess, and NAFLD by showing that intra-adipose androgen generation in PCOS drives
systemic lipotoxicity by increasing adipocyte hypertrophy and fatty acid overspill [41]. We
found that PCOS patients with androgen excess had increased circulating glycerophospholipids and lysoglycerophospholipids, recently identified as potential biomarkers of NASH [42].
We also observed that systemic lipotoxicity increased further after an acute androgen challenge
in patients with PCOS, but not in BMI-matched controls [41]. Androgen-mediated adipose
lipotoxicity could therefore represent an important mechanism conveying liver injury in
hyperandrogenemic PCOS.
Previous in vitro data have suggested a direct effect of androgens on hepatic lipid metabolism
in women, with testosterone increasing lipogenic gene expression and de novo lipogenesis in
primary human hepatocytes from female, but not male, donors [43]. The sexually dimorphic
role of androgens in metabolic disease is an emerging topic, with female androgen excess and
male hypogonadism sharing an overlapping metabolic phenotype characterized by abdominal
obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and NAFLD [44]. Mirroring our data, a recent metaanalysis of 13,721 men and 5,840 women demonstrated a significant sexually dimorphic association between serum testosterone and NAFLD risk [45]. Higher testosterone levels reduced the
likelihood of NAFLD in men but conversely increased the risk in women. The same meta-analysis concluded that increasing SHBG concentrations in both sexes independently lowered the
Fig 3. Hazard of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) according to serum testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)
levels. (A) Serum testosterone (nmol/L) was available in 71,061 unselected women. Using women with testosterone levels below 1.0 nmol/L as a
reference cohort, the hazard of NAFLD was 2.4-fold higher in those with serum testosterone levels of >3 nmol/l. (B) Serum SHBG was available in
49,625 unselected women. Using a reference cohort with SHBG levels of 60 nmol/L, the hazard of NAFLD was almost 5-fold elevated in patients
with serum levels of <30 nmol/L. Both analyses are adjusted for age, Townsend score, diabetes or impaired glucose regulation, and
hypothyroidism at baseline.

risk of hepatic steatosis. In our study, serum SHBG levels below 30 nmol/L, as typically found in
androgen excess, conferred an almost 5-fold increase in the hazard of NAFLD. The majority of
circulating testosterone is bound to SHBG in men and women, and it is generally accepted that
only unbound or “free” testosterone is able to enter metabolic target tissues [46]. Hepatic SHBG
output is suppressed by insulin [5], and therefore, decreased circulating SHBG is a surrogate
marker of hyperinsulinemia in the setting of systemic insulin resistance [47]. SHBG metabolism
in women therefore sits at the interface between insulin resistance and androgen excess, both
key players in PCOS-related metabolic dysfunction [48]. However, it should be noted that interpreting the impact of decreased serum SHBG concentrations on NAFLD risk in women is limited by the fact that both factors known to be associated with decreased SHBG, androgen excess
and insulin resistance, are highly prevalent in women with PCOS [49,50].
Insulin resistance is implicated as a major player in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and
impaired suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis by insulin may lead directly to systemic free
fatty acid overspill from adipocytes, with accumulation of intrahepatic diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol, as well as likely direct hepatocyte injury [51]. Parameters of insulin resistance were
not available in our cohort, but we were able to phenotype patients according to glycemic status. The presence of dysglycemia was a significant factor associated with increased hazard of
NAFLD within the PCOS population (HR = 2.56), but the elevated rate of NAFLD persisted in
our PCOS cohort compared to control women even after correction for glycemic status at
baseline and during follow-up.
The effect of obesity on NAFLD rate in this study also merits discussion. Multivariate analysis consistently showed that a diagnosis of PCOS conferred an increased rate of NAFLD independent of body weight. The observation of a significantly increased adjusted HR of NAFLD
in lean PCOS patients is notable, as at present these patients are not perceived to be at high
risk of progression to metabolic dysfunction [52]. As lean women with PCOS exhibit insulin
resistance much more rarely than those with obesity [53], it is very reasonable to assume that
androgen excess is the major factor driving the increased NAFLD hazard in women of normal
weight with PCOS. This lends to the argument that androgen excess is a major causative factor
in the development of NAFLD.
The limitations of this large population study include its retrospective nature, limited documentation of the diagnostic criteria, clinical features and investigations used for identifying
PCOS and NAFLD, absence of any information on the stage of NAFLD, and the fact that no
data were available on laboratory assays employed to measure serum testosterone concentrations. It is likely that a proportion of serum testosterone values were not measured by goldstandard liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry techniques. Furthermore, data on
the serum androgen precursor androstenedione, previously highlighted as the most sensitive
biomarker of androgen burden and PCOS-related metabolic dysfunction [5], were not available. In addition, patients who underwent serum testosterone and SHBG measurements are
not representative of the general population, as they were likely investigated for clinical indications such as suspected PCOS. It is possible that women in our 2 independent cohorts with
biochemical results for serum testosterone and SHBG indicative of androgen excess were
indeed individuals with underlying PCOS who may not have been evaluated further and given
a diagnosis of PCOS. As expected in a study of this nature, there were no indices of insulin
resistance available in the patient cohorts.
In conclusion, we found an increased rate of NAFLD in PCOS, and this extended to lean
women with PCOS, indicative of androgen excess as a likely major causal factor. We could
show that increased circulating androgen burden determined by serum testosterone and
reduced SHBG levels independently confer an increased rate of NAFLD. Of note, antiandrogen

treatment was associated with a reduction in NAFLD rate, though this failed to reach statistical
significance, likely due to the limited number of women on antiandrogens in our cohort.
Our data support that androgen excess is an independent adverse metabolic risk factor in
PCOS and that metabolic risk stratification in PCOS should take androgen excess into
account. We suggest that women with PCOS should be considered for systematic screening
for NAFLD, if biochemical evidence of androgen excess is present; the diagnostic work-up
should be carried out in accordance with clinical guidelines for the assessment of individuals
deemed at increased risk of NAFLD [54]. Future studies need to clarify whether reducing
androgen burden will convey long-term metabolic benefits in both lean and obese women
with PCOS with androgen excess, including a reduction in their risk of developing NAFLD.
