Epstein–Barr virus positive (EBV+) smooth muscle tumors (SMTs) constitute a very rare 
oncological entity. They usually develop in the context of secondary immunodeficiency 
caused by human immunodeficiency virus infection or immunosuppressive treatment 
after solid organ transplantation. However, in a small fraction of predominantly pediatric 
patients, EBV+ SMTs may occur in patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders 
(PIDs), such as GATA2 and CARMIL2 deficiency. In secondary immunodeficiencies and 
when the underlying condition can not be cured, the treatment of EBV+ SMTs is based 
on surgery in combination with antiretroviral and reduced or altered immunosuppressive 
pharmacotherapy, respectively. Importantly, without definitive reconstitution of cellular 
immunity, long-term survival is poor. This is particularly relevant for patients with EBV+
SMTs on the basis of PIDs. Recently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
resulted in cure of immunodeficiency and EBV+ SMTs in a GATA2-deficient patient. We 
propose that in the absence of secondary immunodeficiency disorders patients presenting with EBV+ SMTs should be thoroughly evaluated for PIDs. Allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation should be taken into consideration, ideally in the setting of a 
prospective clinical trial.

INTRODUCTION
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a gamma 1 herpes virus that preferentially infects human epithelial cells 
of the oropharynx and B cells of the adaptive immune system to establish lifelong latency (1). Rarely, 
EBV can cause ectopic infections and has been found in NK, T, gastric epithelial, and smooth muscle 
cells as well (1, 2). In the majority of cases, primary EBV infection is asymptomatic. However, EBV 
infection can cause lymphoproliferative phenotypes ranging from common infectious mononucleosis 
to rare hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (3). Additionally, EBV infection presents as chronic 
active infection and is associated with autoimmune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (4, 5).
Epstein–Barr virus has an inherent capacity of immortalization and malignant transformation 
especially of its B cell target (6). In the laboratory, this is used to generate lymphoblastoid cell lines. In 
vivo, this can lead to post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and malignant lymphoma, 
such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (7–9).

the smooth muscle nature of the tumor (F). EBV association is demonstrated by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) in the same lesion (200×).

While the underlying conditions for the more frequent 
lymphoproliferative phenotypes seem to be heterogeneous and 
combinatorial, especially the rare and severe phenotypes are 
associated with secondary immunodeficiency disorders (SIDs) or 
predisposing genotypes, such as hemizygous SH2D1A mutations 
that cause X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (1, 3).
Smooth muscle tumors (SMTs) represent a heterogeneous 
group of disorders with a broad pathological spectrum ranging 
from very common and benign uterine leiomyoma to malignant 
leiomyosarcoma. The latter is characterized by hypercellularity, 
nuclear atypia, high mitotic rate, and tumor cell necrosis (10). 
EBV+ SMTs are a distinct subset of SMTs and have often been 
named leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma because of their close 
histological appearance to common SMTs. EBV+ SMTs are very 
rare and can be encountered at any age in the context of SIDs 
and in a small fraction of predominantly pediatric patients with 
primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) (2, 11).
Here, we review the current knowledge on EBV+ SMTs in 
general and present it as an emerging manifestation of PIDs that 
might be targeted by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT).
PRESENTATION, PATHOGENESIS, AND 
TREATMENT OF EBV+ SMTs
Most EBV+ SMTs develop at any age in patients with SIDs due 
to uncontrolled human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV 
EBV+ SMTs) and organ transplantation-associated immunosuppressive treatment (PT EBV+ SMTs) (2, 12). Additionally, they 
rarely present in pediatric patients with proven or suspected PID 
(PID EBV+ SMTs) (11). Overall the prevalence of EBV+ SMTs 
is estimated to be <1–5% for each patient group. Particularly, 
in the PT EBV+ SMTs group they present as late complications 
(median 48 months, range 5–348 months) (12, 13). The clinical 
manifestation of EBV+ SMTs is unspecific and mainly depends on 
the tumor localization, the tumor size, and the particular organ 
displacement and/or disruption (12, 13). The majority of EBV+
SMTs is located in the liver, but virtually every other organ can 
be affected and frequently the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract, 
the central nervous system, and the adrenal glands are involved 
(Figures 1A,B) (12, 13). Importantly, radiological imaging can 
not establish the diagnosis of EBV+ SMTs as there are no pathognomonic findings. EBV+ SMTs can occur at single or multiple sites

synchronously or metachronously, grow per continuitatem and 
do not metastasize (12, 13). They are believed to originate from 
myogenous venous wall cells and can be of recipient or donor 
origin in the setting of solid organ transplantation (12, 14, 15). 
Molecular genetic studies have shown that multiple EBV+ SMTs 
frequently constitute independent clones rather than metastases 
of a single tumor (16).
EBV+ SMTs have a spindle-shaped cell morphology with 
eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei, but frequently lack 
histological atypia, elevated mitotic activity, and tumor necrosis 
(Figures 1C,D). Especially in association with HIV they can present with sarcoma-like histological features and frequently infiltrating lymphocytes and histiocytes can be detected. Expression 
of smooth muscle differentiation markers, such as smooth muscle 
actin, caldesmon, vimentin, and desmin, and transcriptional 
activity of EBV are demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and 
EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) in  situ hybridization (ISH), 
respectively (Figures  1E,F). Immunohistochemistry alone can 
lead to false negative results (17, 18). Importantly, histopathology findings do neither correlate with tumorbiology nor disease 
activity, but are mandatory to establish the diagnosis of EBV+
SMTs (11, 12).
In general in EBV+ SMTs, EBV achieves a latency type III-like 
pattern, i.e., cells are positive for EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), 
EBNA3, and late membrane protein 1 (19–22). The majority of 
HIV EBV+ SMTs are positive for complement receptor 2 (CR2 or 
CD21) that is bound by EBV during B cell infection, while a substantial number of PT EBV+ SMTs and all analyzed cases of PID 
EBV+ SMTs are CD21 negative (21, 23, 24). Thus, the precise EBV 
entry mechanism into the tumor progenitor cells is unknown. 
It is possible that several entry routes exist. Also the molecular 
pathophysiology of tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. 
The activated mTOR/AKT-pathway seems to be involved and 
increased v-myc expression has been found (12, 25, 26).
The diagnosis of EBV+ SMTs is suspected in the context of 
SID and PID and, because there is no pathognomonic radiological morphology, biopsy based histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and EBER ISH are mandatory to formally establish 
the diagnosis (13).
The treatment of EBV+ SMTs is based on the principle of 
re-establishing efficient T  cell immunity. In patients with HIV 
infection, appropriate antiretroviral treatment should be given. 
Patients with iatrogenic immunosuppression following organ 
transplantation may benefit from reduction of immunosuppressive treatment. It remains a matter of debate whether switching 
immunosuppression toward a mTOR inhibitor, such as sirolimus 
might lead to a more favorable outcome (27). Surgery should be 
performed whenever tumor masses compromise organ functions. 
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be applied but in general 
neither of these approaches is markedly improving the disease 
course (13). Prognostic data are derived from retrospective analyses of case records and show a five-year overall survival (OS) of 
approximately 50% for HIV EBV+ SMTs and PT EBV+ SMTs, 
while OS of PID EBV+ SMTs tends to be 0% (13). Especially, 
multiorgan involvement (n = 33/68, OS = 48.5%) and intracranial manifestations (n = 7/68, OS = 10%) are contributing to the 
dismal prognosis (13).
PIDs UNDERLYING EBV+ SMTs
The first description of PT EBV+ SMTs dates back to 1970, but it 
was not until 1995 that the first systematic studies on HIV EBV+
SMTs and PID EBV+ SMTs were published (2, 28, 29). Up to date 
only very few cases of PID EBV+ SMTs have been reported and a 
substantial proportion of these patients lack a precise molecular 
PID diagnosis (Table 1) (19–21, 30–37).
The first report by Mierau et al. dates to 1997 and describes a 
14-year-old female with primary leiomyosarcoma of the brain in 
the context of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) (31). 
The authors emphasize the need for proper histopathological 
work-up of unusual tumor entities in immunocompromised 
patients. In view of a positive family history, the authors conclude 
that EBV+ SMTs are caused by an inherited rather than acquired 
disorder (31).
In 1999, Tulbah and colleagues published another case of a 
child with a genetically undefined congenital immunodeficiency 
presenting with multifocal EBV+ SMTs located to the thyroid 
gland, liver, and lung, and stated that they are unaware of comparable cases (36).
The first report of a genetically proven PID, namely ataxia 
telangiectasia (AT), associated with EBV+ laryngeal leiomyosarcoma and jejunal cellular leiomyoma is published by Reyes 
et al. in 2002 (20). The authors conclude that EBV+ SMTs are 
related to the immunosuppressive consequences of AT and that 
searching for infectious causes is important as SMTs have been 
reported in AT without subsequent evaluation of underlying 
EBV infection (20).
In 2003, Monforte-Muñoz et al. published the case of an 8-yearold female with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) caused 
by adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. The patient develops 
EBV+ SMTs in the gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, intestinal tract, 
and lung after alloHSCT. Additionally, the patient presents 
with EBV+ PTLD, pulmonary and gastric adenovirus, and large 
intestine cryptosporidum infections all of which are indicative 
of poor immune reconstitution and/or recurrences of the ADASCID (32). The authors state that the occurrence of EBV+ SMTs 
and EBV+ PTLD suggests a common pathogenesis that may have 
therapeutic and prognostic implications (32).
In 2006, Hatano et al. reported a 6-year-old male with an EBV+
SMT in the right bronchus that leads to atelectasis and abscess 
in the right upper and middle lobe (19). They find reduced numbers of T cells and impaired T cell proliferation after stimulation 
with phytohemagglutinin. As the patient has additional recurrent 
infections, they conclude that he has an undefined cellular immunodeficiency (19). We are currently investigating the precise 
molecular cause of the suspected PID.
In 2007, Atluri et al. published an IL2RG SCID patient who is 
treated with haploidentical alloHSCT and 8 years thereafter presents with renal and pulmonary EBV+ SMTs in the context of mixed 
donor T cell chimerism (30). Importantly, after donor lymphocyte 
infusion the EBV+ SMTs rest stable during a 2-year follow up and 
the authors conclude that EBV+ SMTs after partial immunoreconstitution may not require surgery or chemotherapy (30).
In 2012, Shaw et al. reported a 12-year-old female with quantitative classic NK cell deficiency presenting with bilateral adrenal

EBV+ SMTs that are treated by successful surgery with an event 
free follow up of 26 months (35). They perform intensive immunological analysis and document a marked deficiency of absolute 
numbers and cytotoxicity of CD3−CD16+CD56+ NK cells at four 
separate timepoints over 18 months. The authors do not report 
an underlying genetic condition, but as NK cells are known to 
participate in protective EBV immunity, they speculate that the 
severe NK cell deficiency contributes to the development of EBV+
SMTs (35).
In 2014, Petrilli et al. reported a 7-year-old female with bilateral 
adrenal EBV+ SMTs and as the patient has recurrent respiratory 
tract infections, including tuberculosis, reduced immunoglobulins, and impaired T cell proliferation after mitogenic stimulation, 
they perform alloHSCT. Five years after unsuccessful alloHSCT, 
the patient develops lethal EBV+ multifocal diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma (34). The two different tumor entities are caused by 
independent EBV transformations and the EBV+ SMTs infiltrating lymphocytes are predominantly CD3+CD5+CD8+ T  cells 
(34). In 2016 and in collaboration with Petrilli and coworkers 
we find a homozygous autosomal recessive mutation in ZAP70
(c.1765G > A, p.Val589Met) that could explain the patient’s PID 
phenotype and would modify the diagnosis into (CID, Schober 
et al., unpublished data).
GATA2 haploinsufficiency is a recently identified polymorphic PID that manifests with a variety of infectious complications especially caused by mycobacteria, but as well by viral, 
bacterial, and fungal pathogens (38). In 2010, Vinh et al reported 
a 41-year-old female with multiple infections in the context of 
GATA2 haploinsufficiency and EBV+ SMTs located to the orbit, 
liver, colon, and uterus. The patient is treated with alloHSCT, but 
succumbs to post transplant viral infections (37).
In 2016, Parta et al. reported a 24-year-old male with GATA2 
haploinsufficiency causing a polymorphic PID including EBV+
SMTs of the liver and possibly the spleen and the bones (33). They 
perform alloHSCT with a myeloablative conditioning regimen 
and peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells from a matched 
sibling donor. After a 3-year follow up GATA2 haploinsufficiency 
and EBV+ SMTs are resolved and the authors conclude that at 
least in the context of GATA2 haploinsufficiency alloHSCT can 
lead to reconstitution of immunologic function and thereby cure 
of EBV-associated malignancy (33).
In 2017, our group reports four patients with EBV+ SMTs on 
the background of a novel CID caused by homozygous autosomal recessive CARMIL2 mutations (21). Two of the patients 
initially are reported as cases of infantile myofibromatosis, but 
extensive immunobiological analyses reveal a profound regulatory T  cell deficiency, defective CD28 co-signaling associated 
with impaired T  cell activation, differentiation and function, 
as well as perturbed cytoskeletal organization associated with 
T cell polarity and migration disorders (21, 39, 40). Two patients 
decease before the PID diagnosis is established and the other two 
patients succumb to disease complications while being prepared 
for alloHSCT (21).
In summary, we are aware of 14 PID cases with EBV+ SMTs 
(Table  1). Twelve of them develop EBV+ SMTs as a primary 
PID manifestation and two of them develop the tumors after 
alloHSCT. Four of the cases are published without and ten with 
a genetic diagnosis confined to the ATM, ADA, IL2RG, GATA2,
and CARMIL2 genes. In one of the genetically undefined cases, 
we are able to retrospectively identify a mutation in the ZAP70
gene. All of the genetically and immunologically defined PIDs 
impair T and/or NK cell immunity. Four of the reported cases 
are treated with alloHSCT in the presence of EBV+ SMTs and two 
of them decease because of viral infections or B cell lymphoma, 
while one develops stable disease after donor lymphocyte infusion and one is cured from PID and EBV+ SMTs.
CONCLUSION
EBV+ SMTs constitute very rare tumors seen in the context of 
SIDs caused by human immunodeficiency virus infection or 
immunosuppressive treatment after solid organ transplantation (11). The pathogenesis of EBV+ SMTs remains largely 
unknown, but it is evident that an immunocompromised host 
is a conditio sine qua non and that especially T and NK  cell 
immunity is important to prevent the disease (11, 21, 35). 
Later, EBV+ SMTs emerge as possible manifestations of PIDs 
and up to now have been linked to mutations in ATM, ADA, 
IL2RG, ZAP70, GATA2, and CARMIL2 (19–21, 30, 32–34, 37). 
Additionally, they have been found in genetically undefined 
PIDs and based on the clinical and immunological findings 
and our growing understanding of their pathogenesis these 
PIDs should at best be named CID and classic NK  cell deficiency (31, 35, 36). At present, a particular molecular signaling 
or effector pathway has not been identified as a prerequisite 
to develop EBV+ SMTs. Given the multitude of CID causing 
gene defects, we thus propose an unbiased genetic work-up, 
such as whole exome sequencing to search for molecular PID 
causes in patients with EBV+ SMTs of unknown origin (41). In 
order to treat EBV+ SMTs, whenever possible, HIV infection 
should be addressed and post transplant immunosuppressive 
treatment should be reduced. AlloHSCT is a well-established 
curative treatment for CID and other PID and, therefore, seems 
a promising therapeutic approach for PID that is present with 
EBV+ SMTs (13, 33, 42).
Four major conclusions can be drawn at present. First, unusual 
SMTs should be screened for the presence of EBV preferentially 
by using EBER ISH. Second, in patients presenting with EBV+
SMTs without obvious SIDs, PIDs have to be considered strongly, 
necessitating appropriate investigation. Third, in PID patients 
presenting with solid tumors, EBV+ SMTs are a differential diagnosis. Fourth, PID patients manifesting with EBV+ SMTs might 
be treated with up front alloHSCT ideally in the setting of a 
prospective clinical trial yet to be initiated.
We envision that with increased awareness toward EBV+ SMTs 
as a manifestation of PIDs the rate of proper diagnosis of this 
association will increase and the outcome of curative alloHSCT will 
improve.
