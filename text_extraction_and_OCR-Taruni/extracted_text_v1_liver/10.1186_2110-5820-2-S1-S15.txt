Abstract
Introduction: Achievement of a negative fluid balance in patients with capillary leak is associated with improved
outcome. We investigated the effects of a multi-modal restrictive fluid strategy aiming for negative fluid balance in
patients with acute lung injury (ALI).
Methods: In this retrospective matched case-control study, we included 114 mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with
ALI. We compared outcomes between a group of 57 patients receiving PAL-treatment (PAL group) and a matched
control group, abstracted from a historical cohort. PAL-treatment combines high levels of positive end-expiratory
pressure, small volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin, and fluid removal with furosemide (Lasix®) or
ultrafiltration. Effects on extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), organ function, and
vasopressor therapy were recorded during 1 week. The primary outcome parameter was 28-day mortality.
Results: At baseline, no significant intergroup differences were found, except for lower PaO2/FIO2 and increased IAP
in the PAL group (174.5 ± 84.5 vs 256.5 ± 152.7, p = 0.001; 10.0 ± 4.2 vs 8.0 ± 3.7 mmHg, p = 0.013, respectively). After
1 week, PAL-treated patients had a greater reduction of EVLWI, IAP, and cumulative fluid balance (-4.2 ± 5.6 vs -1.1 ±
3.7 mL/kg, p = 0.006; -0.4 ± 3.6 vs 1.8 ± 3.8 mmHg, p = 0.007; -1,451 ± 7,761 vs 8,027 ± 5,254 mL, p < 0.001).
Repercussions on cardiovascular and renal function were limited. PAL-treated patients required fewer days of
intensive care unit admission and days on MV (23.6 ± 15 vs 37.1 ± 19.9 days, p = 0.006; 14.6 ± 10.7 vs 25.5 ± 20.2
days, respectively) and had a lower 28-day mortality (28.1% vs 49.1%, p = 0.034).
Conclusion: PAL-treatment in patients with ALI is associated with a negative fluid balance, a reduction of EVLWI
and IAP, and improved clinical outcomes without compromising organ function.
Introduction
Both early and late fluid management affect outcome in
acute lung injury (ALI), sepsis, and trauma [1-5]. After
initial filling to reverse distributive shock [6], emphasis
shifts to limitation and elimination of interstitial edema
in vital organs. Indeed, a positive fluid balance resulting
from third spacing is independently associated with
impaired organ function and worse outcome [7-11].
Conversely, achievement of negative fluid balances predicts survival and improves lung function [12,13].
Bedside measurement of extravascular lung water
index (EVLWI) performed by transpulmonary thermodilution allows to estimate the extent of capillary leak and
fluid overload [14-17]. Accordingly, EVLWI correlates
well with organ function and survival [15,16,18,19].
Moreover, fluid management aimed at EVLWI reduction
results in a more negative fluid balance and improved
outcomes [20]. In order to achieve a negative fluid balance, previous prospective trials excluded patients with
hypotension and renal failure [12,20,21].

In this study, we aimed for a negative fluid balance in
mechanically ventilated patients with ALI presenting
with severe hypoxemia, increased EVLWI, and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) using a restrictive fluid management, referred to in our institution as “PAL-treatment”. PAL-treatment combines high levels of positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), small volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin, and fluid removal with
furosemide (Lasix®) or ultrafiltration during continuous
renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
Methods
Study design
In this retrospective matched case-control single center
study, patients with PAL-treatment were compared to a
matched control group for 1 week from the onset of ALI.
Outcomes were assessed at day 28 after enrolment or at
the day of death or hospital discharge, whichever occurred
first. The primary outcome parameter was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit
(ICU) and hospital length of stay, development of intraabdominal hypertension (IAH), duration of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and cumulative fluid balance, organ dysfunction, and vasopressor therapy requirements after
1 week.
Patients
Data of 114 patients treated in two ICU’s in Ziekenhuis
Netwerk Antwerpen, ZNA Campus Stuivenberg, Antwerp,
Belgium were collected from March 2004 to August 2007
(control group) and from March 2008 to February 2010
(PAL group). Patients were consecutively included if they
were intubated and MV and if monitoring with transpulmonary thermodilution technique was performed.
The PAL group consisted of 57 patients with ALI
according to international criteria [22], in whom a negative
daily fluid balance was deemed necessary, according to
clinical appraisal of low PaO2/FIO2 ratio and increased
EVLWI and IAP. All patients were included at the onset of
ALI.
The historical cohort consisted of 123 MV patients with
thermodilution catheter monitoring, of which 65 patients
met the criteria of ALI [22] and had data available from
the onset of ALI. We used an automatic case-control
matching software module to abstract 57 control patients
from this group. In this way, controls were matched to
PAL-treated patients with regard to demographics, etiology of lung injury, severity of illness, organ dysfunction,
fluid balance, and EVLWI at baseline.
Treatment protocol
Approval for this epidemiologic study was granted by
our institutional review board (EC approval number
3766). Due to the observational and retrospective
character of this study, informed consent was waived.
Standard treatment was based on recent ICU guidelines
and did not differ between the two groups.
Patients in the PAL group received a combination
therapy aiming for negative daily fluid balances. First,
application of PEEP was titrated to counterbalance
increased IAP (best PEEP in cmH2O = IAP in mmHg).
Next, hyperoncotic albumin (20%) solution was administered by 200-ml boluses over 60 min twice on the first
day and subsequently titrated toward a serum albumin
level of 30 g/L. Finally, a furosemide drip was initiated
with an intravenous loading dose of 60 mg, followed by
a continuous infusion at 60 mg/h for the first 4 h and
5-10 mg/h thereafter, according to hemodynamic tolerance. In anuric patients, CRRT was initiated with an
ultrafiltration rate resulting in neutral to negative daily
fluid balances.
Data collection
Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were registered in an electronic database, supplemented with daily
fluid balance, sepsis-related organ failure assessment
(SOFA) score, IAP, MV settings, and hemodynamic variables. Finally, data on total duration of MV, CRRT, ICU
stay, hospital stay, and mortality on day 28 were added
to the database.
Capillary leak index (CLI) was defined as C-reactive
protein (CRP; milligrams per deciliter) over albumin
(grams per liter) ratio, multiplied by 100 [23]. Requirement of vasopressor therapy was determined by the
need of norepinephrine with a dose ≥ 0.1 μg/kg/min.
Severity of illness on ICU admission was described by
an averaged simplified acute physiology (SAPS II) score
[24], acute physiology and chronic health evaluation
(APACHE II) score [25], and SOFA score [26]. Daily
fluid balance was calculated by subtracting the fluid output (diuresis, ultrafiltration volume in case of CRRT,
and any loss from drainage tubes) from the fluid intake
(IV and enteral fluid administration); each day the
cumulative fluid balance was computed by the addition
of daily fluid balances.
IAP was the mean of two daily IAP measurements via
a Foley bladder catheter, as described previously [27].
IAH was defined as persistent increase of IAP ≥ 12
mmHg and abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) as
mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus IAP according to
consensus definitions [8].
A central venous catheter and a thermistor-tipped
arterial thermodilution catheter (Pulsiocath 5F) inserted
into the femoral artery and attached to a PiCCOplus®
system (Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany)
were already in place for each patient. Transpulmonary
thermodilution measurements were obtained by central
venous injection of three 20-mL boluses of cooled saline

(< 8°C). For each set of thermodilution determinations,
the mean values were used for statistical analysis. Cardiac output (CO), global end diastolic volume (GEDV),
extravascular lung water (EVLW), global ejection fraction (GEF), pulmonary vascular permeability index,
stroke volume variation (SVV), and pulse pressure variation were calculated using the PiCCOplus® [17]. EVLW
was indexed to body weight (EVLWI) and CO and
GEDV to body surface area (cardiac index (CI), GEDVI).
Statistical analysis
A priori analyses were performed to stratify patient
groups by demographics, etiology of lung injury, severity
of illness, organ dysfunction, fluid balance, and EVLWI
at baseline. We analyzed data on intent-to-treat basis
comparing outcomes on different time points within
groups and between groups during 1 week.
Continuous data were expressed by mean ± standard
deviation (SD), and intergroup differences were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses
day by day for 1 week (univariate analysis). Categorical
data were expressed as frequency distributions and/or percentages, and the c2 test was used to determine intergroup
differences. Two-sided p values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance.
Time course of PEEP, albumin, PaO2/FIO2 ratio,
EVLWI, daily and cumulative fluid balance, SOFA score,
and IAP was described by clustered error bar graphs
representing mean ± standard error. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to analyze differences in cumulative
survival and duration of mechanical ventilation. We
used SPSS software package (version 17.0.1; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Automatic case-control matching was
performed with the fuzzy extension (http://www.spss.
com/devcentral).
Results
Baseline characteristics
We included 114 mainly medical (n = 102) mechanically
ventilated patients with ALI. Fifty-five patients (48.2%)
required vasopressor therapy, and 50 patients (43.9%)
received CRRT at baseline.
The PAL group had on average lower PaO2/FIO2
(higher respiratory SOFA score), increased IAP, and
higher PEEP level. Otherwise, the two groups were similar (Table 1).
Direct treatment effects (Figure 1 and Table 2)
Serum albumin concentration averaged 26.0 ± 7.4 g/L in
the total group. From day 2, patients in the PAL group
had significantly higher concentrations, rising to 33.0 ±
7.3 g/L on day 7 (p < 0.001). Controls had no significant
increase in albumin after 1 week (25.3 ± 8.0 vs 26.4 ±
5.0 g/L, p = 0.399).
CLI was significantly reduced during 1 week of PALtreatment (62.9 ± 48.4 vs 31.9 ± 25.5, p < 0.001), in contrast to non-significant reductions in the control group
(68.9 ± 66.3 vs 51.8 ± 42.5, p = 0.139).
In the PAL group, average PEEP for the entire week
was significantly higher (11.0 ± 2.8 vs 7.9 ± 2.9 cmH2O,
p < 0.001) compared to controls. PEEP level correlated
with average IAP of 10.0 ± 3.4 mmHg (R = 0.293, p <
0.001).
After the day of enrolment, patients in the PAL group
had significantly lower daily fluid balances on each day;
a negative daily fluid balance was achieved on average
by day 4. PAL-treated patients had a trend toward
higher average urine output (1,844 ± 1,714 vs 1,681 ±
1,635 mL, p = 0.182). Resulting cumulative fluid balance
after 1 week was significantly higher in the control
group.
Effects on organ function (Figure 2 and Table 2)
Respiratory function improved significantly in the PAL
group. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio increased from 174.5 ± 84.5
to 274.4 ± 116.9 (p < 0.001) after 1 week in PAL-treated
patients but remained unchanged in the control group
(256.6 ± 152.7 vs 244.2 ± 98.3, p = 0.641). Accordingly,
respiratory SOFA score after 1 week decreased only in the
PAL group. EVLWI was reduced from 12.0 ± 6.1 to 10.9 ±
3.2 mL/kg (p = 0.021) in the control group and from 13.4
± 6.2 to 9.2 ± 3.6 mL/kg (p = 0.006) in the PAL group.
Except for a higher setting of PEEP, respiratory mechanics
were similar between groups at all time points.
Overall hemodynamic impact assessed with cardiovascular SOFA score shows a significant improvement after
1 week in the PAL group (3.0 ± 1.2 vs 1.8 ± 1.6, p <
0.001) and a modest but insignificant decrease in the
control group (2.9 ± 1.5 vs 2.4 ± 1.5, p = 0.099). Time
course of the MAP/heart rate ratio is shown in Figure 2.
Other hemodynamic monitoring variables were not significantly affected.
After 1 week, a higher percentage of patients required
vasopressor therapy in the PAL group (Table 3).
Furthermore, average dose of norepinephrine for the
entire week was greater in the PAL group (0.281 ±
0.284 vs 0.180 ± 0.129 μg/kg/min, p = 0.005).
Changes in renal function as assessed with renal
SOFA score were similar in both groups. However, average serum creatinine during the observed week was
higher in PAL-treated patients (1.9 ± 3.3 vs 1.6 ± 1.3
mg/dL, p = 0.038) (Table 2).
As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3, IAP increased in
the control group but remained stable in the PAL
group. The APP remained unchanged during the whole
week. During observation, 33.6% of patients developed
IAH, 39.6% in the PAL group, and 27.8% in the control
group (p = 0.224).

Major outcomes (Table 3 and Figure 4)
A total of 44 patients (38.6%) died, with more deaths in
the control group than in the PAL group (49.1 vs 28.1%, p
= 0.034). Patients in the PAL group surviving their ICU
stay required fewer days of ICU admission and days on
MV. Total hospital stay and days with CRRT were similar
in both groups.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that a multi-modal
approach using PAL-treatment in patients with ALI
achieves negative cumulative fluid balance without compromising organ function. Furthermore, compared to a
matched control group, we found improved oxygenation,
EVLWI and IAP reduction, fewer days on mechanical

ventilation, shorter ICU stay, and reduced 28-day mortality in the PAL group.
The idea behind PAL-treatment aiming for negative
fluid balance in a setting of capillary leak is based on
the recently rediscovered concept of the ebb and flow
phase [2,13,28,29]. The ebb phase represents a distributive shock characterized by increased capillary permeability and albumin leak [2,28,30]. Excess interstitial
fluid leads to organ dysfunction [31], including ALI, secondary IAH [8], and associated acute kidney injury [32].
Shock reversal and subsequent hemodynamic and renal
recovery sets in the transition to the flow phase resulting in mobilization of excess extravascular (lung) water
[2]. Previously, a neutral to negative cumulative balance
[1,7,10,13,33,34] and reduction of EVLWI were shown
to correlate with improved survival [15,16,18,19].
PAL-treatment intends to initiate the flow phase, limiting capillary leak and promoting interstitial fluid
removal while ensuring organ perfusion at the same
time. Therefore, it is a specific form of restrictive fluid
management, combining open lung ventilation, small
volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin, and
aggressive fluid removal.
Open lung ventilation strategy in ALI signifies application of high levels of PEEP [35] and is correlated with
decreases in EVLWI [36]. Both the percentage of potentially recruitable lung and EVLWI are related to outcome
[15,16,18,19,35]. The open lung strategy in ALI is associated with increased alveolar fluid clearance and reduced
EVLWI [37-39]. In this study, PAL-treatment was
initiated in patients with low oxygenation index and high
EVLWI, potentially indicating a higher proportion of
recruitable lung. Within the concept of the polycompartment syndrome, we set PEEP level (cmH2O) equal to IAP
(mmHg) in order to counteract IAP [40] (Figure 3).
Induction of the flow phase with PAL-treatment
implies vascular refilling from the interstitium and subsequent removal of fluids from the body producing a
net negative fluid balance. In this context, addition of
small volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin
to a fluid removal regimen resulted in a greater negative
fluid balance while maintaining better hemodynamic stability [21]. Moreover, restoration of colloid osmotic
pressure in absence of elevated hydrostatic pressure may
prevent further interstitial edema formation [41,42].
Accordingly, hypoproteinemia is highly predictive of

therapy for capillary leak, beneficial effects of albumin
on the microcirculation may be of particular interest,
attenuating capillary permeability and pulmonary
inflammation [44-47].

had a net negative cumulative fluid balance while control patients added up to a positive cumulative fluid balance, similar to other cohorts [12,20]. In contrast to
previous studies, negative fluid balance was pursued as a
specific goal. One week of PAL-treatment did not significantly worsen cardiovascular function. Yet, more
patients required vasopressor therapy and administered
doses were higher. Furthermore, although renal SOFA
score on each day was similar in both groups, the PAL
group had higher average creatinine for the observed
week. In line with previous reports, successful restrictive
fluid strategy with PAL-treatment led to improved
oxygenation and shortened duration of MV [12,21].
Moreover, PAL-treated patients had a significant greater
reduction of EVLWI. This observation possibly reflects
improved healing of lung injury, better shock reversal
with transition to the flow phase [15,16,18,19]. We
found PAL-treated patients to have a significant reduction of CLI as a result of restoration of serum albumin.
Overzealous fluid therapy in a setting of capillary leak
is an important risk factor for IAH, associated with
organ failure and increased mortality [48]. Therefore, a
fluid strategy aimed at negative fluid balance and avoiding crystalloid over-resuscitation may play an important

role in preventing and even treating IAH [49]. In this
context, our observations demonstrated a significant
increase of IAP in controls, whereas IAP dropped in
PAL-treated patients.
Our study has several important limitations. First, the
use of historical controls may raise difficulties to ensure
that obtained differences in outcome are related to the
studied treatment. Indeed, we cannot deny that continuous evolving standard care has led to better outcomes in
patients with acute lung injury [50]. In particular, there
are indices that a more protective ventilation (not only
higher PEEP as per protocol) was applied in the PAL
group since at baseline controls had slightly higher tidal
volumes and lower PEEP levels. However, as patients
were selected for PAL-treatment based on low oxygenation indices and high EVLWI, they may have had a
higher percentage of potentially recruitable lung, requiring higher PEEP levels [35].
Second, the large difference in mortality between the
two groups has to be placed in context. Expected mortality in the control group and PAL group was 47% and
48%, computing a standardized mortality ratio of 1.04
and 1.70, respectively. Apart from the presumed better
standard care over time, a selection bias may have been
introduced by including only mechanically ventilated
patients with thermodilution catheter monitoring. Thus,
we selected a specific case mix of severely ill ALI
patients prone to exhibit fluid retention, in which attention to fluid balance may be expected to have great
potential benefit. In this regard, we note a considerable
high cumulative fluid balance after 1 week in controls
(8,027 mL), albeit similar to earlier reports [12,20].
Third, since this was an open trial in which fluid therapy decisions were made by the treating physician, the
lack of a strict protocol to guide fluid therapy may have
introduced bias. Fourth, our database did not supply
detailed information on amounts of fluids administrated
in the first 6 h. The fluid balance on the day before
enrolment was almost 1 L higher in controls, possibly
indicating a more aggressive initial volume replacement.
Exact data on the type of fluid used and the rate of
hourly ultrafiltration in patients with CRRT were not
recorded either.
Conclusion
PAL-treatment in patients with ALI results in a negative
cumulative fluid balance, a reduction of EVLWI and
IAP, and improved clinical outcomes. Repercussions on
cardiovascular and renal function were limited. Within
the concept of dual response to inflammatory injury, we
conclude that PAL-treatment could safely and effectively
promote the transition to flow phase. Future doubleblinded trials confirming these observations and
investigating PAL-treatment in other settings of capillary
leak are warranted.
