Hepatic resection is the gold-standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In East Asia, however, only
20 % of patients with HCC are eligible for hepatectomy
[1]. In a small subset of patients, surgical resection using
conventional techniques is extremely challenging. In these
marginal cases, the tumor size, extension of the lesion, and
proximity of the tumor to critical structures are important
factors determining how to proceed. For tumors considered
unresectable by conventional means, extracorporeal hepatic resection with autotransplantation (ECHRA) has been
proposed to be an alternative [2].
ECHRA has been used to treat hepatic pathologies
including giant hemangioma [3], liver metastases [4], and
sarcomas [2]. However, few studies have reported on its
application as a treatment for HCC [5]. Herein we report a
case series involving three consecutive patients with HCC
who were successfully treated with ECHRA as curative
therapy for otherwise unresectable HCCs.
Patient Selection and Pre-operative Evaluation
In 2011, ECHRA was performed in three patients with liver
tumors at anatomically critical locations that were deemed
technically impossible to resect (Fig. 1). Patient
characteristics and indications for this technique are outlined
in Table 1. To ensure sufficient liver function after liver
resection, we estimated pre- and post-operative liver volumes using 3-D computed tomography volumetry. Indocyanine green (ICG) test was performed in selected patients.
None of the patients showed evidence of portal hypertension.
Surgery
ECHRA was performed as described previously with minor
modifications [6]. Unlike previous reports, we employed
temporary portocaval shunt during the anhepatic period
(Fig. 2). In patients with tumor-invaded major vasculature,
the vessel wall was pared and reconstruction with a venous
patch harvested from the explanted liver (Fig. 3). Details of
the surgery are given in Table 2. The affected segments of
liver were resected after total hepatectomy and the autograft was re-implanted orthotopically. Pathology evaluation confirmed all three tumors to be HCC.
Results and Outcome
The outcomes are outlined in Table 3. Patient 3 had major
complications included postoperative biliary leakage and
intra-abdominal abscess, which were treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and surgical
drainage of the abscess, respectively. There was no hospital
mortality.
Two of the three patients experienced tumor recurrence
8 months after the operation. Patient 2 was treated with
radiofrequency ablation while the other was treated by
transarterial chemoembolization. All patients are currently
alive with stable disease at the most recent follow-up.

To date, the only large series involving ECHRA was
reported by Oldhafer et al. [7]. The difficulty of the surgical
technique and the high perioperative and postoperative
morbidity impede surgeons from using this procedure. We
are the first institution to use preoperative liver volumetry
to prevent postoperative hepatic failure, the most serious

complication. The preoperative evidence of preserved liver
function and without liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension
were other determinants for a good outcome. The three
patients did well after the operation. In the literature
reporting patients with HCC receiving ECRHA, our first
patient had the longest survival [5, 7].
Unlike other studies, we used a temporary portocaval shunt
instead of venovenous bypass to facilitate hemodynamic stability during the anhepatic period. Temporary portocaval
shunts have been shown to improve hemodynamic status,
reduce requirement of intraoperative blood transfusion, and
preserve renal function during orthotopic liver transplantation
[8]; however, it has not been reported to be used in ECHRA. We
believed that the relatively short cold ischemic time and preservation of the inferior vena cava enhanced the functionality of
the temporary portocaval shunt during the anhepatic period.

Conclusions
ECHRA represents an additional surgical option in the
treatment of unresectable hepatic tumors, including HCC.
In addition, the use of a temporary portocaval shunt is a
feasible alternative to venovenous bypass during the anhepatic period.
