Abstract
Background COVID-19 has been giving the devastating impact on the current medical care system. There are quite many 
guidelines on COVID-19, but only a few on the management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during COVID-19 pandemic.
Aims We develop these recommendations to preserve adequate clinical practice for the management of HCC.
Methods Experts of HCC in the Asia–Pacifc region exchanged opinions via webinar, and these recommendations were 
formed.
Results Close contact should be minimized to reduce possible exposure of both medical staf and patients to the novel 
coronavirus. To prevent transmission of the virus, meticulous hygiene measures are important. With the decrease in regular 
medical service, the medical staf may be mobilized to provide COVID-19-related patient care. However, diagnosis and 
treatment of HCC should not be delayed because of COVID-19 pandemic. The management of HCC should be the same as 
in non-pandemic circumstances. HCC is highly malignant, thus it is recommended not to delay curative treatment such as 
surgery and ablation. However, a kind of triage is necessary even among patients with HCC when resources are insufcient 
for all to be treated. Curative treatments should be periodized and cytoreductive or non-curative treatment such as vascular 
interventions and systemic therapy may be postponed until it can be performed safely with sufcient resources. For patients 
with confrmed or suspected to be infected with the novel coronavirus, diagnosis and treatment should be postponed until 
the virus is eliminated or they are confrmed as not being infected with it.
Conclusions These are collection of measures implemented by front-line medical professionals. We would evolve these 
recommendations over time as more real-world data becomes available.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease 
caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has brought 
upon devastating stress on the current medical care system. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As 
of 19th Aug 2020, COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 
21.9 million confrmed cases globally, and over 775 thousand deaths. Approximately 250 thousand newly-confrmed 
cases are being reported daily. The pandemic has not settled 
down yet [1]. The virus is mainly transmitted from personto-person through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. There are also other modes of

transmission (i.e. airborne and fecal–oral). The average incubation period is 5–6 days, ranging from 0 to 14 days. The 
clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from mild disease 
with non-specifc signs and symptoms of acute respiratory 
illness to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and septic shock. There are also reports of asymptomatic cases. Currently, there is no vaccine against the novel coronavirus. The 
best way to prevent COVID-19 is to avoid being exposed 
to the coronavirus. It is recommended that we should keep 
distance of at least 2 m from other people. A new modeling 
study shows that intermittent periods of social distancing 
strategies will be needed till 2022 to avoid overloading of 
the medical system with its limited critical care capacity [2].
Until the end of this COVID-19 pandemic, one needs 
to maintain high management standards of other diseases 
despite the shortage of medical resources, such as personnel, 
beds, personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators. 
There are a number of guidelines and recommendations on 
COVID-19 [3–5]. However, there are only few guidelines 
and recommendations on the management of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) on pandemic of COVID-19 [6, 7].
Currently, liver cancer is the fourth most common cause 
of cancer-related death in the world, which caused 782 
thousand deaths in 2018 [8]. More than 90% of liver cancer 
is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The majority of cases 
of HCC are found in the Asian-Pacifc region [9]. Since 
Asia–pacifc region has more experience both in HCC and in 
COVID-19 than anywhere else, experts of HCC exchanged 
opinions via webinar and developed these recommendations 
to preserve and sustain adequate clinical practice in the management of HCC in the era of COVID-19.
APASL has presented clinical practice guidance for 
general hepatology and liver transplant providers during 
the COVID-19 pandemic which also includes HCC [10]. 
Our article focuses specifcally on HCC, presents more 
practical recommendations and elaborates on the diferent 
management needs. Our article does not have either grading of evidence or grading of recommendation as well as 
many recommendations concerning COVID-19 [3–7, 11]. 
Since COVID-19 is a novel disease, guidance by scientifc 
evidence is rarely available. The recommendations are the 
collection of measures implemented by front-line medical 
professionals and are revised through intense interaction 
via webinar. The presenter, the moderators and co-authors 
exchanged opinions and discussed the contents via emails 
and phones. These recommendations are likely to evolve 
over time as further data become available.
COVID‑19 and cancer
Patients with cancer seem to be easier to be infected with 
the novel coronavirus than individuals without cancer. A 
prospective study in China revealed that 18 (1%) of 1590 
COVID-19 patients had a history of cancer, which seems to 
be higher than the incidence of cancer in the overall Chinese 
population [12]. They are also likely to be at an increased 
risk of progression to severe diseases with COVID-19, such 
as being admitted to the intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilation, and death, compared with patients without 
cancer. A retrospective study in Wuhan, China reported that 
12 (0.79%) of 1524 patients with COVID-19 had cancer. 
It revealed that patients with cancer from the epicenter of 
COVID-19 had a higher risk of the novel coronavirus infection compared with the general population. Seven (58.3%) of 
12 patients had non-small cell lung cancer [13]. In a diferent 
retrospective study, there were 28 patients with cancer who 
were admitted for COVID-19 in three hospitals in Wuhan 
and who had received cancer therapy within 14 days. They 
were found to be associated with substantially higher risk of 
mortality [14]. Patients with cancer may be susceptible to 
the infection and more likely to have higher morbidity and 
mortality than the general population. Several factors could 
account for an elevated risk for the infection and consequent 
complications among cancer patients, including systemic 
immunocompromised state caused by the malignancy and 
anticancer treatments, frequent hospital visits, advanced age, 
and poor performance status.
Cancer is the second leading cause of death. An estimated 
9.6 million people died of cancer globally in 2018, i.e., about 
1 in 6 deaths was due to cancer. The fve most common 
causes of cancer death were cancers of lung (1.76 million 
deaths), colorectal (862 thousand deaths), stomach (783 
thousand deaths), liver (782 thousand deaths) and breast 
(627 thousand deaths) [8].
Cancer mortality can be reduced if cases are detected 
and treated without delay. When detected early, cancer is 
more likely to respond to efective treatment and can result 
in a greater probability of surviving, less morbidity, and 
less expensive treatment. Signifcant improvements can 
be made in the lives of cancer patients by detecting cancer 
early and avoiding delays in treatment. We should not delay 
the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the era of COVID19 pandemic. However, it would be necessary to tailor the 
management depending on available resources. Indication of 
any invasive procedure should be decided on a case-by-case 
basis with the consideration of the increased risk during the 
pandemic, the urgency of the procedure and the efect of the 
delayed intervention.

COVID‑19 and chronic liver disease
Most patients with HCC have underlying chronic liver disease, resulting from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or 
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, alcoholic liver 
disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. There have 
not been sufcient data on whether patients with chronic 
liver disease are at increased risk for getting COVID-19 or 
having severe COVID-19 [15]. CDC COVID-19 Response 
Team reported that 2692 (37.6%) of 7162 patients with full 
past history of illness had one or more underlying health 
condition or risk factor. They also reported that 41 (0.6%) 
had chronic liver disease, 17 (41%) of whom were hospitalized and 7 (17%) were treated in ICU [16]. Incidentally, 
the most commonly reported conditions were diabetes 
mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. 
In other series of COVID-19 reported by Chinese centers, 2–11% of patients had comorbid chronic liver disease 
[16–22]. There is a report that patients with non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease were associated with COVID-19 progression [23].
Infection with the novel coronavirus may impact existing chronic liver disease in three ways: frst, the additional 
hepatic injury induced by COVID-19 could lead to hepatic 
decompensation in patients with  compromised hepatic 
reserves [24]. Second, the potential immunosuppressive 
properties induced by the novel coronavirus may lead to viral 
reactivation in patients with chronic viral hepatitis, although 
more data are required to confrm this hypothesis [24, 25]. 
Third, drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19 may produce hepatotoxicity, as suggested by histological features of 
moderate microvascular steatosis with mild hepatic infammation [26, 27]. Many patients had antipyretic drugs for 
fever. Most antipyretic drugs contain acetaminophen, which 
has direct hepatotoxic potential. Furthermore, many patients 
with COVID-19 may be treated with novel, potentially hepatotoxic, antiviral drugs as well as antibiotics for bacterial 
superinfections.
Hospital preparedness for COVID‑19
It is important to minimize exposure of both medical staf 
and patients to the novel coronavirus. Face-to-face consultation should be performed through web consultation 
or by telephone call whenever possible. Hospitals should 
adapt strategies for patients to minimize hospital visits and 
hospitalization. Routine follow-up visit of hospitals should 
be postponed as long as possible. If circumstances allow, 
the appointment registration system should be adapted. 
Pre-reception inspection should be set up including body 
temperature check and Questionnaire (symptoms, recent 
history of close contact with confrmed or suspected person infected with the novel coronavirus). It is important to 
maintain social safety distance of 2 m between individuals. 
In general, hospitals should not allow patients to be accompanied with others because they can be asymptomatically 
infected with the virus.
There are various ways to screen individuals infected 
with the novel coronavirus. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current standard test for 
COVID-19. In well-equipped hospitals, PCR assays have 
been conducted a few days prior to admission. Antigen test is 
another method of detecting the presence of the virus itself. 
Although it is less accurate, it ofers results in about 15 min 
as opposed to hours for PCR. Both methods need a cumbersome swab to take samples from the cavity between the 
nose and mouth (nasopharyngeal swab). Another method 
is detection of antibodies (serological tests). Antibody tests 
show how many people have had the disease, including those 
whose symptoms are minor or who are asymptomatic. The 
serum antibody rises to certain level at an early period in 
patients infected with the virus.
In general, chest CT is not recommended for detecting the 
novel coronavirus infection. CT should only be deployed in 
very specifc conditions. One is in patients who have high 
risk of the novel coronavirus infection [26], because the sensitivity of PCR is not 100%. Another condition is in patients 
who are scheduled to be hospitalized and have abdominal 
CT, because it is not troublesome to take chest scan simultaneously. Chest CT screening for COVID-19 has a low pick 
up rate in asymptomatic patients infected with the novel 
coronavirus and a 20% false negative rate in symptomatic 
patients [26, 27]. Radiologic fndings in COVID-19 are not 
specifc. Typical features on CT initially include bilateral 
multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral or posterior distribution.
COVID‑19 and HCC
Generally, the diagnosis and treatment of HCC, which is a 
highly malignant tumor, should not be delayed because of 
pandemic of COVID-19. The indications and principles of 
management of HCC should be the same as in non-pandemic 
circumstances. However, a kind of triage may be necessary 
even among patients with HCC when resources are insuffcient. With the decrease in regular medical service, staf 
may be mobilized to provide COVID-19-related patient care. 
This shift of staf should not have a negative impact on the 
ability to manage HCC patients.
Patients with HCC who have symptoms suggestive of 
COVID-19 or other conditions of high risk of the novel coronavirus infection, such as close contact with infected people 
or people who come from a severely afected area, and have

not been tested should undergo PCR. If available, chest CT 
should also be performed for those who have high risk of the 
novel coronavirus infection [17, 20, 22]. For patients with 
confrmed or suspected to be infected with the novel coronavirus, diagnosis and treatment of HCC should be postponed 
until the virus is eliminated or they are confrmed as not 
being infected with it. It is supposed that the median time 
from onset to clinical recovery is approximately 2 weeks for 
mild cases and is 3–6 weeks for severe or critical disease 
cases.
Surveillance for HCC
Generally, surveillance with ultrasound (US) and serum 
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) measurement are undertaken in 
high-risk groups of patients, such as those with chronic 
HBV or HCV hepatitis and those with liver cirrhosis of any 
etiology. US is widely practiced for surveillance of HCC 
since US is noninvasive and its cost is reasonable. However, 
in the era of COVID-19, surveillance using US should be 
limited because of the close contact with patients and US 
practitioner [28, 29].
Under normal circumstances, a 6-month surveillance 
interval is considered as a standard for high-risk subjects 
[30]. Since COVID-19 decreases the regular medical service, it would be necessary to prioritize surveillance of super 
high-risk patients of developing HCC, such as those with 
HBV- or HCV-related liver cirrhosis.
Diagnosis for HCC
General principles in the era of COVID‑19
In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, the diagnosis of cancers as well as other diseases would not work smoothly in 
many hospitals because of their limited capacity. However, 
the diagnosis of HCC should be prioritized because HCC 
is highly malignant. Every patient should be considered as 
possibly infected with the novel coronavirus. Table 1 summarizes recommendations for general principles and each 
examination for HCC.
US
It is recommended to limit the usage of US, since US practitioners are in close contact with patients [28, 29]. Contrastenhanced US, which is very sensitive to detect hypervascularity in a nodule, should also be limited. As a protection for 
both US practitioners and patients, surgical facemasks are 
necessary for US practitioners. Examinees are also advised 
to wear facemasks. When examinees do not wear masks, US 
practitioners should have eye guards. Every patient should 
be considered as possibly infected with the novel coronavirus. To prevent transmission of the virus, meticulous hygiene 
measures are important. After each examination, thorough 
cleaning of a gel bottle and all touched surfaces should be 
performed using a disinfectant [28, 29].
CT and MRI
In general, dynamic CT, dynamic MRI, or gadolinium 
ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (GdEOBDTPA)-enhanced MRI is recommended as a frst-line 
diagnostic tool for HCC when a screening US shows a possible HCC nodule [30]. As every patient possibly infected 
with the novel coronavirus, those who have an abdominal 
CT in their investigation may also have chest CT scan at the 
same time [31]. It would not be troublesome to take chest 
scan additionally.
However, chest CT should only be deployed in very specifc circumstances, because CT screening for COVID-19 
has a low pick up rate in asymptomatic patients infected 
with the novel coronavirus and a 20% false negative rate in 
symptomatic patients [26, 27].
After each examination, deep cleaning of equipment, 
surfaces and contact points is mandatory [32]. If possible,

establishment of a COVID-19 dedicated CT and/or MRI 
scanner can minimize the risk of hospital-acquired infection.
Treatment for HCC
General principles
We need to decide whether we should perform, postpone 
or suspend treatment for each individual case by considering the situation in real time not only from medical but 
also from logistical viewpoint. Telemedicine is important 
in multi-disciplinary decision-making process on treatment 
and care plans. This technology would make it possible for 
HCC patients to get the right treatment at the right time 
without delay.
HCC as well as most other cancers are considered as progressive diseases, thus it is recommended not to delay their 
curative treatment such as surgery and ablation. American 
College of Surgeons recommends Elective Surgery Acuity 
Scale [33], which would be useful to assist the decisionmaking process not only of surgery but also of other actions 
to triage non-emergent interventions. HCC as well as most 
other cancers may be categorized as “Tier 3a (high acuity)”, 
thus action should not be postponed in general. However, a 
kind of triage is necessary even among patients with HCC 
when resources are insufcient for all to be treated without 
delay. Curative treatments should be more prioritized and 
cytoreductive or non-curative treatments may be postponed 
until they can be performed safely. The situation may be 
diferent from country to country and from institution to 
institution.
During the intervention, minimum number of staf should 
be in the room and all staf in the room should wear appropriate PPE [34] depending on their role and risk. In some 
interventions without aerosol generation, PPE may be necessary only for operators who have close contact with patients 
possibly infected with the novel coronavirus. Procedure 
tasks are slower and more difcult when wearing full PPE 
[35]. Table 2 summarizes recommendations on general principles and each treatment for HCC.
Liver resection
Liver resection (LR) is a curative treatment for HCC among 
Child–Pugh class A patients, although recurrence develops 
in most cases even after radical resection. Its indication 
should be decided based on not only tumor condition but 
also liver function. Generally, liver resection with curative 
intent should not be delayed. However, in cases of high risk 
of decompensation or comorbidities that increase risk of 
severe COVID-19, surgical intervention should be postponed 
or alternative therapy such as ablation should be adapted.
Table 2 Recommendations for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma during COVID-19 pandemic
Interventions Recommendations
General principles Whether to perform, postpone or suspend treatment should be decided for each individual case not only from medical 
but also from logistical viewpoint
It is recommended not to delay a curative treatment such as surgery and ablation
Cytoreductive or non-curative treatment such as vascular interventions and systemic therapy may be postponed
For patients with confrmed or suspected to be infected with the novel coronavirus, treatments should be postponed until 
the virus is eliminated or they are confrmed as not being infected with it
Liver resection Generally, liver resection with curative intent should not be delayed
However, in cases of high risk of decompensation or comorbidities, surgical intervention should be postponed or alternative therapy such as ablation should be adapted
There has been some concern on the safety of surgery as surgery cannot be performed without aerosol generating procedures
Liver transplantation Liver transplantation for patients with poor short-term prognosis should not be delayed
Elective living donor transplantation may be suspended
In patients with complete response to bridging therapy on transplant list, transplantation may be suspended
Ablation Ablation with curative intent should not be delayed
Ablation is an acceptable alternative to resection for cases of three or fewer tumors, each 3 cm or smaller, and of Child–
Pugh class A or B liver dysfunction
Vascular interventions Vascular interventions may be postponed because they are used as cytoreductive treatments in most cases
Vascular interventions should be suspended in cases of risk of decompensation or comorbidities that increase the risk of 
severe COVID-19
Radiation therapy Radiation therapy for cases of symptoms control or at low risk of progression may be postponed
However, radiation therapy for function- or life-threatening situation have to be treated without delay
The course of radiation should be shortened when appropriate
Systemic therapy Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors would be better than infusional regimens during the pandemic
The impact of immunotherapy on the course of COVID-19 is not known

Hepatology International (2020) 14:920–929 925

There has been some concern on the safety of surgery 
during COVID-19 pandemic as surgery cannot be performed 
without aerosol generating procedures, such as endotracheal 
incubation and energy device usage which produces surgical 
smoke. Laparoscopic or robotic surgery during the pandemic 
may contribute to decreased length of stay as compared with 
open surgery as well as minimizing the need for medical 
treatments. On the other hand, pneumoperitoneum, which 
is inevitable in laparoscopic or robotic surgery may bring 
higher risk of aerosol exposure to the surgeons and staf.
Liver transplantation
Liver transplantation, which is the best therapeutic option 
in some patients because it can be a treatment not only for 
HCC but also for cirrhosis. However, organ donor shortage 
restricts its indication.
During COVID-19 pandemic, transplantation should 
be decided on case-by-case basis. Liver transplantation for 
patients with poor short-term prognosis, such as with high 
MELD score and HCC at the upper limits of the Milan criteria are in high priority and should not be delayed [36, 37] 
and for those with compensated liver disease and within the 
lower limits of Milan criteria have medium priority may be 
suspended to minimize the risk of the donor and the recipient. In patients with complete response to bridging therapy 
on transplant list, transplantation may also be suspended 
until it can be performed safely with sufcient resources.
Ablation
Image-guided percutaneous ablation, such as radiofrequency 
ablation, microwave ablation and others, are minimally invasive therapies for HCC. Ablation is a potentially curative 
treatment and easily repeatable for recurrence. Ablation with 
curative intent should not be delayed. In cases of three or 
fewer tumors, each 3 cm or smaller, and of Child–Pugh class 
A or B liver dysfunction, ablation is an acceptable alternative to resection [38].
Ablation itself is not an aerosol generating procedure 
(Figs. 1, 2, 3) [39]. Ablation is generally performed with 
local anesthesia. In some institutions, ablation is performed 
with general anesthesia, and general anesthesia is an aerosol generating procedure. When general anesthesia is performed, ablation rooms are considered as high-risk areas of 
infection.
Vascular interventions
Vascular interventions, such as transarterial chemoembolization and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, are 
recommended for cases of unresectable, large/multifocal 
HCCs without vascular invasion nor extrahepatic spread. 
Vascular interventions are cytoreductive treatments in most 
cases. Therefore, they may be suspended until they can be 
performed safely with sufcient resources.
Vascular interventions should be suspended in cases of 
risk of decompensation or comorbidities that increase the 
risk of severe COVID-19 because of reduced inpatient beds 
Fig. 1 Image-guided percutaneous ablations, such 
as radiofrequency ablation, 
microwave ablation and others, 
are minimally invasive therapies 
for HCC. Ablation with curative 
intent should not be delayed 
even during the COVID-19 
pandemic. The patient is in 
an upright position. An RFA 
electrode is inserted from the 
epigastrium into a tumor in the 
left lateral segment

926 Hepatology International (2020) 14:920–929

for post-procedure care. If vascular intervensions are performed, selective or super selective chemoembolization 
should be attempted to prevent severe postembolization 
symptoms.
Vascular interventions, themselves are not aerosol generating procedures [39].
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy, including proton beam and carbon ion 
beam therapies, can be used as an option for local control 
of HCC. Palliative care for cases receiving the therapy to 
control symptoms or at low risk of progression is better to 
delay the schedule of radiation [40]. However, radiation 
therapy for patients with rapidly progressing HCC may outweigh the risks of the novel coronavirus infection. Radiation 
therapy for function- or life-threatening situation such as spinal cord compression and inferior vena cava syndrome have 
to be treated without delay. The course of radiation should 
be shortened, for example, single-fraction treatment for bone 
pain, and less fractionation when appropriate.
Systemic therapy
Systemic therapy is for advanced-stage HCC such as with 
macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis and with 
Child–Pugh class A liver function. For cases of advanced 
HCC treated with systemic therapy, oral tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors would be better than infusional regimens during the pandemic to protect both patients and medical staf. 
If available, video call should be used to manage common adverse events. Intravenous chemotherapy should be 
administered in a dedicated section of outpatient service. 
The impact of immunotherapy on the course of COVID-19 
is not known since there is no sufcient data. Immunotherapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Clinical 
trial recruitment should be suspended until the COVID-19 
pandemic settles down. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
postponing of locoregional therapies may be necessary. Oral 
targeted drugs might be a substitute for some patients.
Follow‑up for HCC
It is recommended to follow up the patients by telemedicine or online consultation to minimize hospital visits in 
the circumstances of COVID-19 pandemic. However, due 
to its high frequency of the recurrence in HCC, imaging 
examination to detect recurrence at the early stage should 
not be postponed.
Conclusions
In these difcult times, it is our obligation to preserve high 
management standards of other diseases as well as to efectively handle the COVID-19 pandemic in spite of the shortage of medical resources, such as personnel, beds, PPE and 
others. To keep our patients and ourselves safe, we should 
share our experiences and strategies to manage our patients.
The novel coronavirus infection will not settle down in 
the near future. We need to collect real-world data to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. It is mandatory to collect 
follow-up data of patients who recovered from COVID-19. 
There have not been any data available on COVID-19 from

long-term viewpoint, since COVID-19 was frst reported at 
the end of 2019. It is important to determine the symptomatic and asymptomatic incidence of the novel coronavirus 
infection by large-scale serological testing not only in the 
general population but also in patients with HCC and to 
survey their COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality to 
adjust management strategies of HCC.
