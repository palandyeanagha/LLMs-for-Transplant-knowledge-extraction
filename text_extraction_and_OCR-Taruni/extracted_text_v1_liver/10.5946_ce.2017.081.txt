Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has become an essential tool for the diagnostic and therapeutic intervention of gastrointestinal diseases. 
Beyond the drainage of fluid collections, it enables decompression of inaccessible bile and pancreatic ducts, the gallbladder, and the 
creation of anastomosis within the gastrointestinal tract using fully lumen-apposing stents. This review explored the safety and efficacy 
of these novel procedures and discussed the training pathway that is necessary to perform them efficiently and safely. Clin Endosc

Introduction
Historically, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been a diagnostic procedure focused on the identification of key structures and the staging of gastrointestinal cancers. However, owing to technological advancements, EUS has expanded from 
diagnostic sampling into the field of therapeutic procedures. 
To perform these interventional techniques, an endoscopist 
must appreciate the added risk of using a transmural needle to 
puncture a sterile space via ultrasound guidance (as opposed 
to direct visualization). The increased risk of complications 
with interventional EUS procedures as compared with conventional endoscopy has been well documented. In addition, 
advanced therapeutic procedures can fail in up to 15%–30% 
of cases, especially in the hands of inexperienced surgeons.1
However, the current literature suggests that EUS-guided 
transmural interventions are safe, efficacious, have fewer 
complications than percutaneous radiological interventions, 
and are less invasive compared to surgical procedures, when 
performed by expert endoscopists.2
 Due to the increased 
complexity of advanced therapeutic procedures, additional 
endoscopic skills require a further 12–24 months of training 
to develop.3,4 EUS-related complications can be broadly categorized as bleeding, infection, or perforation, but can be more 
specifically described according to the particular interventional procedure. Interventional EUS procedures are also being 
continuously refined to make them safer and more efficient.
Pancreatic fluid collections
EUS-guided drainage procedures have now largely replaced 
the conventional surgical drainage of pancreatic fluid collections, with transenteric drainage as the preferred route.5
 EUS 
helps to assess maturity of the fluid collection, assess wall 
thickness, and identify and avoid vascular strictures, as well as 
anticipate the presence of solid or other necrotic components 
within the cavity. Initially, conventional transmural drainage 
demonstrated a 72% technical success rate; however, the current technical success rate of EUS-guided drainage of pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis has increased to greater than 95%. 
Moreover, lower complication rates have been facilitated by 
dedicated EUS-guided lumen-apposing metal stents, which

prevent stent dislodgement from a collection that is not adherent to the stomach wall.6,7
Procedure-related complications rates range from 5%–18%.7-10
These procedure complications are typically secondary to perforation or bleeding. Complication rates can also vary based 
on the type of pancreatic fluid collection. Varadarajulu et al. 
demonstrated a 5% complication rate with simple pseudocysts 
and a 16% complication rate from infected pseudocysts.11
Perforation-related complications can occur during the initial transmural puncture of the fluid collection or during the 
creation of the fistula tract with electrocautery.12 Typically, 
the perforations are small and can be managed conservatively, especially if carbon dioxide is used for gas insufflation, as 
opposed to air.13 Bleeding can also occur as a complication 
despite the use of EUS with Doppler to avoid adjacent blood 
vessels. Puncture site bleeding can occur in patients with collateral vessels secondary to segmental portal hypertension, 
which can typically be controlled with a large caliber, self-expanding fully covered stent. However, other causes of bleeding can occur from vessels within the collection wall that can 
bleed after rapid decompression, or secondary to a pseudo-aneurysm, which requires embolization or even surgical exploration. Other complications include stent migration/incorrect 
deployment, infection of an incompletely drained collection, 
and, rarely, air embolism or pneumothorax. 
Advanced therapeutic EUS 
techniques
EUS-guided drainage of the biliary and pancreatic ducts 
has been developed as an alternative for patients who fail 
conventional drainage. These advanced interventional EUS 
techniques involve smaller targets, which increases the risk of 
procedure-related complications. 
EUS biliary drainage
EUS-guided biliary duct drainage has been described for 
patients who fail conventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The biliary system is accessed 
either transduodenally (choledocho-duodenostomy) or transgastrically (hepatico-gastrostomy) for direct access or as a rendezvous procedure. EUS-guided biliary drainage is associated 
with a greater than 90% technical success rate.14 A meta-analysis by Khan et al. demonstrated a cumulative adverse event 
rate following EUS-guided biliary drainage of 17%.15 Complication rates also vary according to the different biliary access 
routes, and choledocho-duodenostomy is associated with a 
lower stent dysfunction rate, as well as fewer overall complications.15,16 Procedure-related complications include bleeding, 
perforation, cholangitis, and stent migration. Bile leakage is 
another complication associated with bile tracking along the 
stent into the peritoneum, but this risk has decreased from 
11% to 4% after switching from plastic stents to fully covered 
self-expanding metal stents.16
EUS pancreatic duct drainage
EUS-guided pancreatic duct drainage is one of the most 
technically challenging EUS interventions and it is associated 
with a high risk of complication and failure. These procedures 
are categorized as either EUS-guided rendezvous drainage 
or pancreatico-gastrostomy. These are the more technically 
demanding EUS interventions due to smaller targets, the 
difficulty in maintaining the position along the axis of the 
main pancreatic duct, inability to dilate the transmural tract 
due to dense pancreatic fibrosis, and difficulty with advancing the necessary equipment secondary to the acute angle at 
which the pancreatic duct is often accessed by EUS.2
 In light 
of the inherent challenges, the technical success rate has been 
documented at 89%,17 while the procedural complication 
rate varies in the literature from 5% to 43%.2,18-20 Immediate 
complications include bleeding, pancreatitis, development of 
pancreatic fluid collection/abscess, perforation, and pancreatic 
duct leakage.17
EUS gallbladder drainage
Traditionally, in patients who are not surgical candidates 
for cholecystectomy due to underlying medical comorbidities, percutaneous drainage has been considered the drainage 
option of choice. However, recently, EUS guided drainage 
has emerged as a safe, efficacious, and minimally invasive 
option.21,22 EUS identifies the gallbladder from either the 
stomach or duodenum and allows for internal drainage. Reported technical success rates are greater than 90%, which 
is significantly higher than the 83% technical success rate of 
transcystic stenting via ERCP.23 EUS gallbladder drainage has 
also demonstrated similar clinical and technical success rates 
as compared with percutaneous drainage, but with fewer adverse events.21,23-25 Its associated complications are similar to 
those of EUS biliary duct drainage, including bleeding, infection, perforation, stent migration, bile leakage, etc., with a 10% 
adverse event rate.26
Training in interventional EUS 
The field of interventional EUS is rapidly expanding with 
the continuous addition of new techniques, including not 
only the aforementioned procedures, but also other procedures such as celiac plexus block, tumor ablation, EUS-guided 

 237 
Saumoy M et al. Safety and Complication of IEU
anastomosis, etc. Though the field of interventional EUS is exciting, a disciplined clinical pathway to the skillful utilization 
of these techniques is critical. The EUS-guided ERCP consortium meeting of 2011 brought together leading experts to generate recommendations for training in these procedures. Their 
guidelines highlighted the following categories of endoscopists 
who may qualify to perform therapeutic EUS techniques: (1) 
Those who routinely perform pancreaticobiliary EUS and 
fine needle aspiration (FNA); (2) Those with extensive ERCP 
and EUS experience for nearly 4–5 years (at least 200–300 
EUS and ERCP each year); (3) Those with a 95%–98% success 
rate for standard ERCP with normal anatomy; and (4) Those 
working in a center with interventional radiology and/or pancreatic-biliary surgery back-up.27
After demonstrating adequate experience with the prerequisite skills, a trainee can begin to become adept in therapeutic EUS techniques. Trainees must be mentored by an expert 
endoscopist to ensure mastery of each step of the technique: 
needle puncture, tract dilation, and stent placement.28 A 
trainee must also experience gradual independence, starting 
with large endoscopic targets (i.e., pancreatic pseudocysts) 
and moving to progressively smaller targets (i.e., gallbladder/
biliary/pancreatic drainage). In tandem with the increasing 
complexity of the types of therapeutic procedures, the risk of 
potential complications also increases. Therefore, an endoscopist must be comfortable managing potential complications 
prior to taking on the responsibility of interventional EUS. 
Although there are no established guidelines to determine 
competency for these procedures, sufficient training at 
high-volume centers with structured competency markers is a 
requirement to perform interventional EUS. 
Conclusions
With the development of interventional EUS, endoscopists 
are able to use minimally invasive techniques to manage patients who previously could only be treated via percutaneous 
drainage by interventional radiologists or via open/laparoscopic resection by surgeons. However, in comparison to diagnostic EUS, interventional EUS does carry a higher risk of 
complications, particularly in the context of more technically 
difficult procedures, such as EUS-guided pancreaticobiliary 
drainage. While complication rates vary based on the type of 
interventional procedure, all interventional EUS procedures 
are technically demanding and require the skill of experienced 
endoscopists. Nevertheless, interventional EUS techniques are 
very feasible and most have an overall technical success rate 
of greater than 90%. Despite the lack of established guidelines 
to determine competency for these procedures, trainees with 
sufficient clinical experience at high-volume centers can learn 
to safely perform interventional EUS. The field has advanced 
rapidly during the past decade with novel devices that facilitate these technically challenging techniques. Continued 
advancements in endoscopic technology will further enhance 
these procedures and reduce the rate of adverse events.
