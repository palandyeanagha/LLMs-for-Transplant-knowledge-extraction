Abstract. Background/Aim: To evaluate the outcome of
patients with unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(CC) treated with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and
concurrent chemotherapy (CT) with or without intraluminal
brachytherapy (ILBT) boost or with definitive ILBT. Patients
and Methods: A pooled analysis of patients with nonmetastatic unresectable CC was performed. They were
treated in three different institution with EBRT plus CT with
or without an ILBT boost. Some patients received only ILBT
with curative dose. Results: Seventy-three patients were
included in the analysis. Thirty-nine patients (53%) received
EBRT treatment with ILBT boost (18 patients with CT during
EBRT), while 28 patients (38%) were treated with EBRT (CT
in 26 patients) and 6 patients (8.2%) with definitive ILBT (2
patients with CT). CT was administered including either the
use of gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil. With a median followup of 16 month (range=1-94 months), median overall
survival (OS) was 16 months. Overall median LC was 16
months and patients who underwent ILBT had a better local
control (LC) (p=0.018). Conclusion: The role of ILBT in
unresectable CC is not yet supported by robust evidence in
the literature. However, within this limit, preliminary results
seem to suggest an improved local control in patients treated
with ILBT, almost comparable to the ones of standard
chemo-radiotherapy (CRT).
Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a rare cancer and represents 2%
of all malignant tumors. The incidence is rising in the
western world (1). Patients with CC are generally over 65
years of age, with a peak occurring in the seventh decade of
life (2).
Complete surgical resection with negative margins is the
gold standard treatment of extrahepatic CC. However, even
in localized and resectable CC, nodal metastases and perineural invasion are predictors of poor prognosis (3, 4).
Moreover, in patients who are not candidates for curative
resection, due to poor physical compliance, locally advanced
disease, or unfavorable tumor site, overall survival (OS)
generally ranges between 6 and 12 months (5-7).
To improve CC treatment outcome, external-beam
radiotherapy (EBRT) and/or intraluminal brachytherapy
(ILBT) have been used either alone or in combination with
concurrent chemotherapy (CT) (8-10). However, the specific
role of radiotherapy (EBRT or ILBT) plus chemotherapy in
locally advanced CC has not been yet clearly defined (1-5,
8, 9). Nevertheless, OS in patients with locally advanced CC
treated with chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) seem to be improved
compared to best supportive care alone, using both
gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracile as CT (11). Furthermore, the
combination of EBRT plus ILBT improved OS and QoL in
patients who underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary
drainage (PTBD) (12).

Recently, Bisello and colleagues published a study
suggesting that EBRT plus ILBT in patients with
unresectable CC is well tolerated and able to achieve OS
rates comparable to the current standard treatments (13). In
order to verify these results, also including a group of
patients undergoing ILBT alone, we retrospectively analyzed
CC patients treated with EBRT+/-CT with or without an
ILBT boost or with definitive ILBT alone.
Patients and Methods
Study design and eligibility criteria. We retrospectively analyzed
patients with extrahepatic CC treated in 3 different institutions
[Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli (FPG) - Gemelli ART-Roma;
Ospedale Sant’Orsola-Malpighi-Bologna; Fondazione IRCCS
Istituto Nazionale Tumori- Milano] from 1992 to 2017. All patients
had inoperable CC at diagnosis as documented by CT scan, MRI,
or surgical exploration. Patients treated with EBRT (+/- concurrent
chemotherapy and +/- IBRT boost) or with definitive ILBT at
curative doses were included in this analysis.
Treatment characteristics. External beam radiation was delivered to
the tumor volume and the primary lymphatic drainage with different
techniques such as: conventional 2 dimensional, (2D-CRT),
conventional 3 dimensional (3D-CRT), intensity modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT), and volumetric- modulated-arc-therapy
(VMAT). ILBT was delivered as a boost after completion of EBRT or
as definitive treatment. A 192Ir source was positioned through a
percutaneous biliary drainage catheter or a nasobiliary catheter. ILBT
was administered at both low dose (LDR) and high dose rate (HDR)
and the dose was prescribed at 10 mm from the center of the source.
Different concurrent schedules of CT were administered with EBRT:
gemcitabine and capecitabine, 5-fluorouracile, gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin, and capecitabine alone. All patients underwent radiologic
and endoscopic exams to identify the tumor site and extension, and
histologic confirmation of malignancy was obtained prior to start of
the therapy. After treatment, patients were evaluated every 3 months
by physical examination, complete blood count, blood chemistry, chest
X-ray, and abdominal ultrasound or CT every 6 months. Acute and
long-term toxicities were assessed using the Common Toxicity Criteria
Adverse event (CTCAE) Version 3.0.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by MedCalc
(14). Local control (LC) rates and OS curves were calculated using
the Kaplan–Meier method (15).
Results
In this analysis, we included 73 patients treated in 3 different
institutions. Median age was 64 years (range=32-88 years).
All patients had a non-metastatic unresectable cancer, with
or without nodal involvement. Forty-nine patients had a
proximal duct CC and 24 patients a distal ductal CC. The
patient characteristics are summarized in Table I. Thirty-nine
patients (53.4%) received EBRT treatment with ILBT boost
(18 patients with concurrent chemotherapy during external
beam radiotherapy), while 28 patients (38.3%) were treated
with EBRT (concurrent chemotherapy in 26 patients) and 6
patients (8.3%) with definitive ILBT (2 patients with
concurrent chemotherapy). CT was administered including
either the use of gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil. The median
dose of EBRT was 50 Gy (range=40-50.4 Gy). The median
dose of ILBT boost was 20 Gy (range=14-25 Gy); instead,
for definitive ILBT the median dose was 30 Gy (range=20-
50 Gy). With a median follow-up of 16 months (range=1-94
months), median OS was 16 months and median progression
free survival (PFS) was 13 months. Median LC was 16
months. At univariate analysis, patients who received
exclusive ILBT as a boost or as definitive therapy showed
improved LC compared to patients EBRT or CRT (Figure 1)
(p=0.018). Median LC was 16 months and 1-yr LC and 2-
yrs LC were 82% and 50%, respectively, in patients treated
with EBRT ± CT + ILBT. Median LC was 11 months and 1-
yr LC and 2-yrs LC were 41% and 23%, respectively, in
patients treated with EBRT±CT. Median LC was 24 months
and 1-yr LC and 2-yrs LC were 80% and 53%, respectively,
for the patients treated with brachytherapy (Table II).
OS and PFS were similar in the 3 groups (Figure 2,
p=0.51; Figure 3, p=0.18, respectively). The treatment was
generally well tolerated. The incidence of acute hematologic
and gastrointestinal toxicity (grade>2) is reported in Table
III. No differences were observed between the 3 groups.
Discussion
Surgical resection is the treatment of choice in patients with
extrahepatic CC. However, in a large number of patients,
surgical intervention is not feasible. Several studies have
been carried out in order to reduce the incidence of locoregional recurrence of the disease with different treatments.

It is difficult to detect any difference among the available
therapeutic options due to the small sample size of published
studies. Moreover, the advantages of CRT have not been
established due to lack of randomized trials, despite the
availability of some retrospective analyses on CRT even if
based on different drugs and radiation doses of 40-54 Gy
(16, 17). Therefore, the optimal radiation dose in the
definitive treatment of CC has not been defined. However,
there are strong limitations about the delivery of high
radiation doses due to the close proximity to radiosensitive
organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and the liver. In this
scenario, ILBT may represent an effective strategy to
escalate the dose to the tumor while sparing normal tissue.
In fact, this technique allows the delivery of high radiation
doses close to the source with rapid dose fall-off over a short

distance, with consequent sparing of adjacent normal tissues.
Some authors have reported a correlation between the use of
ILBT and OS, while others have shown no significant
improvement (18-22).
In the recent analysis of Bisello and colleagues, an IBRT
boost was delivered in some institutions to improve OS.
According to these authors the OS was not improved in
patients undergoing ILBT boost. However, in this group
there was a higher rate of long-term survivors (>48 months)
(13). Also the report of Deodato and colleagues showed
similar results (23). Considering that local progression of
disease is a major cause of treatment failure, increasing the
dose to the tumor through ILBT boost can be considered a
reasonable option to improve the outcome.
To increase the dose to the target stereotactic radiotherapy
can be also used to deliver conformed radiation with high
precision and accuracy, in a small number of fractions.
Recently, several studies have been published about this
treatment in CC. This technique has the advantage to be
delivered in a very short time, with easy integration with
systemic therapy. However, the optimal technique and dose
in the definitive radiotherapy of CC has not yet been defined.
In conclusion, our analysis simply suggests an improved
LC in patients treated with ILBT, even without a clear
impact on OS. Moreover, it should be stressed that the
treatments were safe and well-tolerated.
This study had obviously several limitations. The analysis
was performed on a heterogeneous group of patients with CC
in different sites of extrahepatic bile ducts. Patients were
followed by different teams of radiologists, endoscopists,
surgeons, and radiation oncologists. In particular, patients
underwent radiation therapy with different procedures of
EBRT, ILBT, and CT. In the future, the development of
nomogram, or more general predictive models, could help
the identification of patient groups who would most benefit
from the delivery of CRT or CRT and ILBT in unresectable
carcinoma.
