Abstract
Background
The present study aimed to investigate the impact of pre-sarcopenia on the prognosis of
patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with sorafenib.
Methods
We enrolled 214 patients (71 ± 10 years old; 166 men and 48 women; 90% Child–Pugh
grade A and 10% Child–Pugh grade B) treated with sorafenib in our hospital from July 2009
to August 2016. The muscle volume was measured from CT images just before sorafenib
administration using software (SliceOmatic). Skeletal muscle mass index was calculated,
and the presence of pre-sarcopenia was judged according to the standard (42 cm2
/m2 for
men and 38 cm2
/m2 for women) proposed by the Japan Society of Hepatology.
Results
Pre-sarcopenia was found in 123 patients (57%). The overall survival (OS) in patients with
pre-sarcopenia tended to be worse than in patients without pre-sarcopenia (median 252 vs.
284 days, respectively; p = 0.16). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis revealed a baseline
serum albumin level of 3.5 g/dl [hazard ratio (HR) 1.9; p = 0.0006], a baseline alpha-fetoprotein(AFP) level of 100 ng/ml (HR 2.1; p = 0.002), presence of lesions in bilateral hepatic
lobes (HR 1.7; p = 0.03), and presence of major portal vein invasion (HR 1.8; p = 0.01) to be
independent prognostic factors. In the 68 patients who had three or more negative prognostic factors, the presence of pre-sarcopenia did not correlate with prognosis. Of the 146
patients who had two or less prognostic factors, OS was significantly worse in 84 patients
(58%) with pre-sarcopenia than in 62 patients without pre-sarcopenia (median 417 vs. 562
days, respectively; p = 0.047), and Cox hazard analysis revealed pre-sarcopenia to be an
important prognostic factor (HR 1.6; p = 0.047).

Conclusion
In sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC, pre-sarcopenia is a significant prognostic factor
in patients with two or less negative prognostic factors, and could be the target of intervention to improve prognosis.
Introduction
Sarcopenia is defined as loss of both muscle volume and function (loss of muscle strength or
physical function), and loss of muscle volume alone has specifically been defined as pre-sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is classified into primary sarcopenia (associated with aging) and secondary
sarcopenia (associated with chronic disease or malignant tumors) [1]. Among the various
causes of secondary sarcopenia, chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are
regarded as high-risk diseases. In fact, it has been reported that sarcopenia is present even in
non-elderly patients with chronic liver disease. The prevalence of sarcopenia is reported to be
15% in patients with chronic hepatitis [2], up to 40% in patients with compensated cirrhosis
[3], and 11%–45% in patients with HCC [4, 5]. Notably, sarcopenia has attracted attention as a
factor predicting poor prognosis, and there is increasing evidence supporting the importance
of sarcopenia and pre-sarcopenia in patients with chronic liver disease and HCC [6–9]. The
impact of sarcopenia on the prognosis of patients with HCC has been reported in several studies. The presence of sarcopenia correlated with poor prognosis in patients after surgical resection of HCC [10, 11], liver transplantation [12], or intra-arterial therapy [13].
Treatment of advanced HCC that is not amenable to resection, liver transplantation, or
locoregional therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation or transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), remains a challenge in clinical practice. Sorafenib is a drug that has been confirmed to be effective in improving survival of patients with advanced stage HCC [14] and is
now recommended as the first-line treatment option for advanced HCC that is refractory to
TACE or does not meet the criteria for resection, transplantation, or locoregional therapy.
Accordingly, there is a wide range of HCC conditions among patients treated with sorafenib,
such as presence or absence of metastasis, major vascular invasion, tumor volume, and serum
biomarkers. However, information is limited on the prevalence and significance of sarcopenia
in patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib [15–17], and no previous study has analyzed the impact of sarcopenia in subgroups of patients stratified by HCC conditions. In the
present study, we investigated the impact of pre-sarcopenia as a prognostic factor in patients
with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib after stratification by standard prognostic factors.
Methods
Patients
This is a retrospective cohort study that enrolled 214 consecutive patients treated with sorafenib in our hospital from July 2009 to August 2016. This study was approved by the institutional
ethics committee (Ethics committee for clinical studies of Musashino Red Cross Hospital: Rinshoukenkyu-Rrinrishinsa-Iinkai (in Japanese), approved number 185) in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. The diagnosis of HCC was based on histology or radiological findings,
such as arterial enhancement, followed by a washout in the portal venous phase, as viewed on
dynamic computed tomography (CT) imaging or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in
accordance with the criteria of practice guidelines [18]. The definition of major portal vein

invasion is invading the main trunk/the first-order branch of the portal vein (Vp4/3). Inclusion criteria for sorafenib treatment were having metastatic or locally advanced HCC that was
unresectable or refractory to TACE, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C [19], and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1 [20]. Patients with active infections, those with poorly controlled thromboembolic disease, and those with interstitial
pneumonia were excluded.
Sorafenib treatment
All study participants provided informed consent for treatment and for the participation in
the clinical study, and then treatment was commenced. The initial dose of sorafenib was 800
mg/day in general but was reduced to 400 mg/day for patients with advanced age (80 years),
Child–Pugh grade B, low body weight (<50 kg), or having pleural effusion/ascites or gastrointestinal varices with a risk of bleeding[21–25]. The initial dose of sorafenib was reduced by the
judgement of physicians in order to avoid early discontinuation due to severe adverse events.
We have previously reported that prognosis was comparable between patients treated with
standard 800mg of sorafernib and those with reduced dose[24]. There are some reports that
the duration of sorafenib administration appears to influence prognosis more than initial dose
[22–25]. These were the rationales for the dose reduction. CT imaging was performed before
and one month after starting sorafenib and every three months thereafter. Radiological
responses to therapy were evaluated according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (modified RECIST)[26, 27]. Serial measurements of blood samples were performed before and monthly after sorafenib treatment. Sorafenib was discontinued and palliative treatments or best supportive care was provided in cases of radiological progressive
disease or intolerable adverse events. Patients with combination therapy were not included,
and all the patients received sorafenib monotherapy. In this study, patients who had experience of other systemic treatments were excluded.
Muscle volume measurement
The muscle volume was measured from CT images just before sorafenib administration using
software (SliceOmatic) [28]. Skeletal muscle mass index, which is the sum of muscle area at the
level of third lumbar vertebra (L3) divided by the square of the height, was calculated and the
presence of pre-sarcopenia was judged according to the standard (42 cm2
/m2 for men and 38
cm2
/m2 for women) proposed by the Japan Society of Hepatology [29]. Both diagnosis and
evaluation were performed blindly by two trained hepatologists with knowledge about radiological anatomy and experience in skeletal muscle area measurements.
Survival analysis
The endpoint was set at overall survival (OS). OS was calculated from the initial date of sorafenib treatment until death due to any cause or until the last follow-up. Baseline factors associated with OS were analyzed. The factors analyzed for prognostic significance included age,
gender, serum data (albumin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP (AFP L3 fraction)[30, 31], and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence II
(PIVKA-II) levels) before sorafenib administration, HCC conditions (maximum diameter of
intrahepatic HCC, tumor number, tumor location, major vessel invasion, and distant metastasis), and presence of pre-sarcopenia. Furthermore, we also analyzed the correlation between
the presence or absence of pre-sarcopenia and OS after stratification by standard prognostic
factors.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test, and continuous variables were
compared using the unpaired Student’s t-test. P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were expressed as mean±standard deviation. OS was evaluated by Kaplan–Meier
curves and differences between groups were assessed using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the factors associated with OS. All statistical analyses were performed using the statistical analysis software R (http://www.r-project.org) [32].
Results
Patient background
Patient backgrounds are shown in Table 1. Values are mean±standard deviation. Baseline liver
function was Child–Pugh grade A in 192 patients (90%) and grade B in 22 patients (10%).
Serum albumin level was 3.5 g/dl in 95 patients (44%). Overall, 38 patients (19%) had
received sorafenib as initial therapy for HCC, 76 patients (35%) showed evidence of extrahepatic metastasis, 47 patients (22%) had major portal vein invasion, 152 patients (70%) had
lesions in bilateral hepatic lobes, and the maximum size of tumor in the liver was 60 mm in
71 patients (35%). Regarding serum biomarkers, elevated AFP levels (100 ng/ml), AFP L3
fraction (10%), and PIVKA-II levels (100 mAU/ml) were found in 120 (56%), 125 (58%),
and 136 (65%) patients, respectively.
Prevalence of pre-sarcopenia
Pre-sarcopenia was found in 123 patients (57%). Patients with pre-sarcopenia were older
(74 ± 8 vs. 68 ± 11 years, respectively; p < 0.001) and the prevalence in females was higher
(32% vs. 12%, respectively; p = 0.001), compared with those without pre-sarcopenia. Other
baseline factors including results of blood tests, status of HCC, and serum biomarkers were
not different between groups (Table 2).

Overall survival
The median survival time (MST) after sorafenib administration was 14.4 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.1–17.1 months). OS in patients with pre-sarcopenia tended to be worse
than in patients without pre-sarcopenia; MST was 13.7(8.8–16) vs. 18.5(9.1–26) months and 6-
, 12-, and 18-month survival rates were 72%, 53%, and 37% vs. 72%, 55, and 50%, respectively
(p = 0.16) (Fig 1).
Sorafenib treatment and dose reduction
Median duration of sorafenib administration was 3.3 months (0.17–79 months). There was a
correlation between sorafenib treatment duration and survival time. Patients taking sorafenib
for more than 3 months (n = 124) had longer survival time than cases of 3 months or less
(n = 90) (19(15–23) vs. 6.5(4.9–8.1) months; p < 0.0001). One-hundred fifty six patients experienced reduction of sorafenib dose. In patients with (n = 156) or without (n = 58) dose reduction, there was no difference in survival time (14(9.3–18) vs. 14 (8.9–20) months; p = 0.54).
There was no association between pre-sarcopenia and sorafenib treatment duration or dose
reduction. Treatment duration of patients with pre-sarcopenia (n = 123) did not differ from
the duration of patients without pre-sarcopenia (n = 91) (4.2(2.9–4.8) vs. 3.2(2.7–4.3);
p = 0.76), and there was no difference in dose reduction frequency of pre-sarcopenia (75%)
compared to patients without pre-sarcopenia (71%) (p = 0.64).
Prognostic factors
The prognostic factors associated with OS were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. Univariate analysis revealed the following variables as significant prognostic factors: a
baseline serum albumin level of 3.5 g/dl, a baseline AFP level of 100 ng/ml, a baseline AFP
L3 fraction of 10%, a baseline PIVKA-II level of 100 mAU/ml, size of intrahepatic lesion
60 mm, presence of lesions in bilateral hepatic lobes, and presence of major portal vein invasion. We analyzed prognosis with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage and ECOG

performance status, but these factors were not prognostic factors: BCLC stage B (n = 109) vs.
stage C (n = 105) (p = 0.09), and ECOG performance status 0(n = 116) vs. 1(n = 108)
(p = 0.46). Multivariate analysis revealed a baseline serum albumin level of 3.5 g/dl [hazard
ratio (HR) 1.9], a baseline AFP level of 100 ng/ml [HR 2.1], presence of lesions in bilateral
hepatic lobes [HR 1.7], and presence of major portal vein invasion [HR 1.8] to be independent
prognostic factors (Table 3). The albumin cut-off value of 3.5 g/dl was used based on the cutoff value in Child-Pugh classification. AFP level of 100 ng/ml is a standard cut-off value for
the survival prediction of HCC patients, and we used this common cut-off value in this study.

bilateral hepatic lobes; and 16(13–20) vs. 5.2(3.8–6.5) months for the absence vs. presence of
major portal vein invasion, respectively (Fig 2). The numbers of negative prognostic factors in
each case were 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in 23, 54, 69, 54, and 14 patients, respectively. In patients having
three or four prognostic factors, OS was significantly worse than those having two or less prognostic factors: 5.2(4.1–6.9) vs. 20(15–24) months [HR 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4–
4.8; p < 0.0001] (Fig 3). The cut-off value for number of negative prognostic factors was calculated from the area under the curve analysis of progression-free survival and the number of
negative factors.

Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated the prevalence and significance of pre-sarcopenia in patients
with advanced stage HCC treated with sorafenib, because sarcopenia or pre-sarcopenia has
attracted attention as factors predicting poor prognosis in patients with chronic liver disease
and HCC. The incidence of pre-sarcopenia in our study cohort was 57%, which is high compared with the reported prevalence of 15% in patients with chronic hepatitis and 24% in
patients with compensated cirrhosis [2]. OS in patients with pre-sarcopenia tended to be
slightly worse than in patients without pre-sarcopenia. Furthermore, when patients were stratified according to the number of traditional prognostic factors, the presence of pre-sarcopenia
was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients having no or few negative prognostic factors. This is the first report to define a subgroup of patients where pre-sarcopenia
impacts prognosis.
There are several reports on the correlation between pre-sarcopenia and prognosis in
patients with HCC who underwent resection [10, 33–35] or liver transplantation [12, 36, 37].
However, the evidence in patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib remains scarce.
Previously, Hiraoka et al. reported that pre-sarcopenia was a negative prognostic factor independent of tumor factors and hepatic reserve in patients who received sorafenib treatment
[15]. Similar to our present study, the authors examined the correlation between pre-sarcopenia, determined using CT and psoas muscle area index (PSI), and survival in 93 patients who
received sorafenib treatment. The cut off value of PSI used was 4.24 cm2
/m2 for men and 2.50
cm2
/m2 for women, which was previously shown to be a prognostic factor in patients with
chronic hepatic diseases in that institution. Pre-sarcopenia was found in 21.5% of patients and
was an independent prognostic factor in addition to PIVKA-II level of 100 mAU/ml. In our
present study, the incidence of pre-sarcopenia was as high as 57%, possibly because the study
subjects included a larger number of elderly patients or those with decreased hepatic function
than the previous study.
The difference between our present study and the previous study [15] was that survival, as
determined by the presence of pre-sarcopenia, did not reach a statistically significant difference when analyzed in the whole cohort in our study, whereas pre-sarcopenia was a significant
factor in the previous study. A possible reason for this difference may be differences in HCC
conditions. Specifically, the incidence of extrahepatic metastasis and major vessel invasion was
similar but the size and number of intrahepatic lesions were larger, and there were more
advanced cases based on the TNM stage classification in our present study. Accordingly, we
further investigated the significance of pre-sarcopenia by dividing the patients into two groups
according to four negative prognostic factors, including baseline serum albumin levels, AFP
levels, presence of lesions in bilateral hepatic lobes, and presence of major portal vein invasion.
In patients having three or more negative prognostic factors, there was no significant correlation between pre-sarcopenia and prognosis. In contrast, in patients with better conditions having two or less prognostic factors, the prognosis was significantly worse in patients with presarcopenia than in patients without pre-sarcopenia. Our present study suggested that although
hepatic reserve and tumor conditions are the most important factors for predicting prognosis
in patients undergoing sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC, pre-sarcopenia is also an
important prognostic factor. In patients with 3 or more negative factors, the survival curve
declined rapidly within the initial several months and MST was only 5.2 months. On the other
hand, in patients with 2 or less negative factors, the decline in the survival curve was mild
within the initial several month, which became further gradual after 10 weeks in patients without pre-sarcopenia. Therefore, the early decline in survival is primarily dependent on the number of negative factors whereas survival on the long term may be affected by the presence or

absence of pre-sarcopenia. From these observations, we believe that pre-sarcopenia do not
impact the survival in patients with 3 or more negative factors whose survival is very short.
These findings suggest that evaluation of muscle volume could be one of the predictors and
that intervention to improve pre-sarcopenia, such as nutritional therapy or exercise may help
to improve prognosis, which need to be evaluated in the future studies.
Molecular mechanisms for the development of sarcopenia and its association with sorafenib
treatment are largely unknown. Previous reports have suggested an involvement of reduced
activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway, which promotes protein synthesis, in the development of sarcopenia. For this pathway, it is reported that sorafenib treatment decreases protein synthesis by directly inhibiting
the mTOR pathway by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. It may be possible that in patients who receive sorafenib treatment, these pathways lead to the development of
sarcopenia leading to progression of cachexia, thereby worsening prognosis [21]. For the treatment of sarcopenia, nutrition, exercise, and medication including BCAA supplementation are
recommended [38–41]. Therefore, these interventions may improve the prognosis in patients
with pre-sarcopenia treated with sorafenib. It may be necessary to prospectively evaluate this
in the future.
In some reports, it has been suggested that fat inside the muscle instead of muscle volume
and decreased grip strength or physical function may contribute to the development of sarcopenia [7, 42]. Based on limitations of our present study, including that this was a retrospective
study, measurement of grip strength or walking speed was not performed, and a relationship
between sarcopenia and prognosis could not be analyzed. The fat inside the muscle was not
evaluated. Further studies are required in the future. Another limitation is that the muscle volume measured by sliceOmatic and by different software programs were not compared because
other software programs were not available.
In conclusion, in sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC, pre-sarcopenia is a prognostic
factor in patients having no or few negative prognostic factors. Therefore, pre-sarcopenia
could be the target of intervention to improve prognosis.
