Abstract
Purpose The closure of midline in abdominal wall incisional hernias is an essential principle. In some exceptional circumstances, despite adequate component separation techniques, this midline closure cannot be achieved. This study aims to 
review the results of using both anterior and component separation in these exceptional cases.
Methods We reviewed our experience using the combination of both anterior and posterior component separation in the 
attempt to close the midline. Our frst step was to perform a TAR and a complete extensive dissection of the retromuscular 
preperitoneal plane developed laterally as far as the posterior axillary line. When the closure of midline was not possible, 
an external oblique release was made. A retromuscular preperitoneal reinforcement was made with the combination of an 
absorbable mesh and a 50×50 polypropylene mesh.
Results Twelve patients underwent anterior and posterior component separation. The mean hernia width was 23.5±5. The 
majority were classifed as severe complex incisional hernia and had previous attempts of repair. After a mean follow-up of 
27 months (range 8–45), no case of recurrence was registered. Only one patient (8.33%) presented with an asymptomatic 
bulging in the follow-up. European Hernia Society’s quality of life scores showed a signifcant improvement at 2 years postoperatively in the three domains: pain (p=0.01), restrictions (p=0.04) and cosmetic (p=0.01).
Conclusions The combination of posterior and anterior component separation can efectively treat massive and challenging 
cases of abdominal wall reconstruction in which the primary midline closure is impossible to achieve despite appropriate 
optimization of surgery.

Introduction
Incisional hernias (IH) are a frequent complication after 
midline laparotomies. A number of IH are considered complex because of size, location, domain loss, previous operations, the presence of stomas or infection, and comorbidities 
[1, 2]. The main goal of surgical repair of midline IH is to 
obtain a complete fascial approximation, with an appropriate 
mesh reinforcement.
However, some midline IH have extensive defects, thus 
for midline advancement of very widely separated borders, diferent component separation techniques have been 
described, and are divided into two groups: anterior component separation (ACS) and posterior component separation (PCS). Albanese frst described ACS by releasing the 
insertion of external oblique muscles [3]. Ramirez implemented this technique in a cadaver study, which combined 
medial posterior rectus sheath release with external oblique 
detachment [4]. Later, this technique was efectively used 
with mesh reinforcement [5–7]. ACS generated advancements as long as 10 cm. However, a main issue with this 
technique was morbidity associated with the wound, due to

extensive subcutaneous detachment. To avoid these complications, modifcations have been described for ACS, e.g. 
laparoscopic ACS and perforator preserving ACS [8, 9].
The PCS technique emerged only in the last decade; the 
approach facilitated closure of the midline with an extended 
lateral dissection, as in the previously described retromuscular preperitoneal plane [10]. The frst PCS study was published in 2008, and described lengthening the lateral dissection between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis 
muscles [11]. After the initial publication of the transversus 
abdominis release (TAR) [12], this PCS approach spread 
rapidly among abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) surgeons [6, 13–16], as it avoids subcutaneous dissection of 
ACS, and dissects a landing zone in a retromuscular position 
to lay the mesh as a reinforcement. The Madrid modifcation 
of the TAR was also implemented without a need for cutting 
the transversus abdominis (TA) muscle and reinserting the 
transversus muscle into the mesh [17].
In some challenging cases, despite using the component 
separation technique, there may still be difculties in reintroducing the viscera and closing the midline. Also, abdominal 
closure may induce development of intra-abdominal hypertension and respiratory distress [18, 19]. In these instances, 
quilted mesh, bridging repairs, or visceral resections have 
been performed [16, 20, 21]. Bridged repairs are associated with a high risk of recurrence [21]. In our experience, 
intestinal resection and anastomosis carry a risk of anastomotic dehiscence that may be fatal for the patient. Therefore, we decided to combine ACS and PCS for exceptional 
circumstances.
The aim of this study is to present data on TAR and ACS 
combinatorial approaches during exceptional and challenging cases, to achieve AWR.
Materials and methods
We performed a retrospective study on patients undergoing hernia repair at two specialized complex hernia repair 
centers, by reviewing a prospective AWR multicenter database. Patients undergoing AWR using a PCS approach, 
and those who also required an additional ACS for midline 
closure, where identifed and reviewed. Ethical approval 
was obtained from the Institutional Review Board before 
study commencement. The report was written following 
the STROBE statement [22], and the recommendations for 
reporting outcomes in abdominal wall hernias [23].
All patients were evaluated in a multidisciplinary unit, 
specialized in abdominal wall procedures. Collected measures included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, type of hernia according to the European Hernia Society 
(EHS) classifcation, number of previous hernia repairs, and 
details of the initial operation. Surgical data included length 
of surgical procedures, width and length of the abdominal 
wall defect and other required surgical procedures (adhesiolysis, bowel resection, panniculectomy). In the postoperative 
period, any systemic complications or surgical site events 
were recorded, e.g. length of hospital stay.
All patients followed a similar preoperative optimization 
program, which included endocrinological and nutritional 
evaluations, smoking abstinence, weight loss and respiratory physiotherapy. Injection of botulinum toxin into the 
lateral abdominal wall musculature was performed under 
ultrasound guidance, approximately 4 weeks before surgery, 
as previously described [24]. This technique was applied 
to hernia defects longer than 10 cm width, started in 2017. 
Progressive pneumoperitoneum, with daily insufation of 
500 ml of air, was performed during the two weeks before 
surgery, for cases with>25% Tanaka index [25].
Surgical technique
A schematic representation of the surgical technique is 
shown (Fig. 1). Under general anesthesia, the patient was 
placed in decubitus supinus, with a bladder catheter for intravesical pressure measurements, and an epidural catheter for 
pain management. The skin was incised through the previous 
scar, removing any unaesthetic scars, if present. If the patient 
had a large skin apron, the procedure was performed through 
a low transverse incision between both anterosuperior iliac 
spines, lifting all subcutaneous tissue until the epigastric 
area was reached. The hernia sac was opened longitudinally 
in two halves, and the bowel and omentum content were

reduced. Half the hernia sac was left attached to the anterior 
rectus sheath, and the other half was left attached to the contralateral posterior rectus sheath. A meticulous adhesiolysis 
was performed if there were any adhesions to the hernia sac, 
or the parietal peritoneum. The abdominal content was then 
protected with a towel.
The posterior rectus sheath was opened bilaterally, and a 
retromuscular dissection was performed, reaching both the 
lateral borders of the posterior rectus sheath, as the lateral 
limit of the dissection. Perforator neurovascular bundles 
were visualized and carefully preserved. Midline cranial 
dissection was performed, raising the undamaged linea alba 
by cutting and pulling down both posterior rectus sheaths 
and preperitoneal fat in the midline, until the central tendon 
of the diaphragm is reached. Caudally, the retromuscular 
dissection was overextended to detect both the Cooper’s 
ligaments. At this time of the surgery, two stitches of longterm absorbable monoflament (Monomax®, USP 00, Mesh 
Elastic, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) were placed in both 
Cooper’s ligaments to fx the permanent mesh later.
Then, a down to up TAR was performed, as previously 
described [17]. The created lateral retromuscular preperitoneal space was extended laterally as far as the posterior 
axillary line, reaching the quadratus lumborum and psoas 
muscle. Whenever possible, we aimed to cut the posterior 
rectus sheath more medially, cranially, to avoid transecting 
of the TA muscle fbers.
The posterior layer, comprising the posterior rectus 
sheath and part of the attached sac, was approximated with 
a running suture of a long-term absorbable monoflament 
not in all but one case, in which this closure could not be 
initially performed. In this case, after the initial attempt 
to reintroduce the abdominal content, there was a high 
peak of respiratory pressure. After the additional release 
of the external oblique muscle, the respiratory parameters 
improved, enabling posterior closure.
For mesh reinforcement, we used an absorbable posterior reinforcement of permanent mesh in a complex hernia (the Madrid Approach) [16]. According to, a piece of 
a 20 × 30 cm absorbable mesh (GORE® BIO-A® Tissue 
Reinforcement, WL Gore & Associates, Inc. Flagstaf, AZ, 
USA) is placed over the posterior layer closure, to provide 
support for a large 50×50 cm polypropylene macroporous 
mesh (Bulevb®, Dipro Medical Devices SRL, Torino, Italy), 
which is fxed to the Cooper’s ligaments. As required, one 
or two 15F low-suction drains are placed over the mesh. The 
lateral border of the posterior rectus sheath is then reinserted 
into the permanent mesh, with running absorbable sutures.
At this point of the surgery, a first attempt to bring 
together the midline of the medial limits of the anterior rectus sheath is carried out. If closure of the anterior layer is 
impossible and the presence of an unacceptable gap according to the physical characteristic of the patient or in case 
of severe respiratory distress for the anesthesiologist, the 
decision to add an ACS is taken. The ACS is performed in 
two ways, depending on the initial approach. In cases where 
an extensive subcutaneous dissection has been performed 
(big and redundant subcutaneous sacs, with exposure of the 
anterior fascia further the lateral limit of the anterior rectus 
sheath, or an association of a panniculectomy), a fasciotomy 
is performed as described by Ramirez [4].
In case of no extensive lateral subcutaneous dissection, the ACS is performed in a minimally invasive open 
approach, as described [26]. Two 2 cm transverse skin incisions are performed at the point of the intersection of the 
umbilical line, and the mammarian line. The subcutaneous 
tissue is dissected until exposure of the external oblique 
aponeurosis. A small transverse incision is performed in 
this layer. With blunt blind dissection, the avascular space 
is dissected with the fnger. A blind external oblique fasciotomy is performed, pushing partially closed long scissors 
in the cranial and caudal border of the aponeurosis opening, 
reaching both the costal margin and the inguinal ligament.
Once the ACS has been performed, the midline is closed 
with a running suture of long-term absorbable monoflament 
(Monomax®, USP 1 or O, Mesh Elastic, B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany). In case complete closure is not possible 
despite addition of ACS and PCS, the gap is bridged over 
the mesh, suturing the border of the anterior rectus sheath to 
the polypropylene mesh, with running sutures of long-term 
absorbable monoflaments (Monomax®, USP 00, Mesh Elastic, B.Braun, Melsungen, Germany). To isolate the exposed 
mesh from subcutaneous tissue, part of the hernia sac that 
remains attached to the anterior rectus sheath is sutured to 
the contralateral border of the posterior rectus sheath, with 
full coverage of the bridged mesh. After closure of the anterior layer, one or two low-suction drains are placed in the 
subcutaneous space, in case of an associated panniculectomy. The subcutaneous tissue is sutured with short-term 
absorbable stitches, and the skin is closed with staples.
Follow‑up
Follow-up evaluations consisted of a physical examination 
in the outpatient clinic at 4–5 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 
1 year, and then annually thereafter. Patients underwent an 
abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in case of clinical doubts, or as part of oncological surveillance.
Long-term complications such as chronic pain, chronic 
mesh infection, recurrence, and bulging were evaluated at 
each visit. Recurrence was defned as a new abdominal wall 
defect in the operated area, as identifed by physical examination or imaging. Bulging was defned as an area of weakness or asymmetry during patient abdominal wall inspection or exploration, without any solution of continuity in

the abdominal wall visible by CT. We used the European 
Abdominal Wall Hernia Quality of Life Scores (EuraHSQoL) to compare evolution in patients by pain, restriction 
and cosmetic domains between the preoperative and postoperative periods [27].
Statistics
Variable descriptions and statistical analyses were performed 
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 
program (version 19.0 for Windows). In an intention to perform the analysis, quantitative variables were expressed as 
the mean/median and standard deviation/quartiles, and categorical variables were expressed as absolute numbers and 
percentages. Spearman’s correlation coefcient was used to 
measure the strength of relationship between paired data of 
EuraHS-QoL scores.
Results
Patient demographics and characteristics
Between 2014 and 2019, 12 patients who underwent AWR, 
required combined PCS and ACS. Patient demographics 
and characteristics are shown (Table 1). The mean age was 
62.66±11.8 years, and the mean BMI was 37.19±7.94 kg/
m2. Eight patients had a previous history of incisional hernia 
repair.
Hernia characteristics
Hernia features are summarized in Table 2. The mean width 
of the horizontal aponeurotic defect was 23.58±4.91 cm, 
and the mean vertical length was 19.91 ± 5.50  cm. All 
defects were midline, ten (83.3%) were M1–M5 according to 
EHS classifcation, and two (16.7%) presented a concomitant 
lateral incisional hernia.
Operative details
Operative details are presented (Table 3). In seven cases 
(58.33%), preoperative pneumoperitoneum was performed 
with a median of 11.800 ml (5.000–12.000 ml) air. Botulin 
toxin injection was used in fve cases (41.66%). Ten cases 
(83.33%) were classifed as clean and clean-contaminated 
wounds. The posterior layer could be closed in all cases. 
Three patients (25%) required an anterior layer bridge, without the possibility of complete closure of the midline, with 
a mean horizontal bridge of 2.9 cm, and a mean vertical 
bridge of 3 cm. There was a 25% rate of enterotomies; all 
initially repaired. Associated surgeries included; omentum 
resection for two cases (16.7%), and in nine cases (75%), a 
panniculectomy was performed as part of the AWR.
Postoperative complications
Postoperative complications are summarized (Table 4). 
Surgical site infections (SSI) were reported in four cases 
(33.3%): superfcial SSI in two patients (16.7%), deep SSI 
in two cases (16.7%), and no organ/space SSI was registered. 
The overall incidence of surgical site occurrences (SSO) was 
66.6%. Seven cases (58.3%) developed a seroma in the frst 
30 postoperative days. In 25% of patients, a skin/wound 
dehiscence was registered. There were fve SSO (41.7%) that 
required procedural interventions (SSOPI): four bed-side 
drains, and one chronic seroma that required reintervention

associated respiratory insufciency, and one case required 
intensive care. No postoperative mortalities were registered. 
No patient developed intra-abdominal hypertension.
Long‑term postoperative complications
Long-term postoperative complications are shown (Table 5). 
After a mean follow-up of 27 months (range 8–45), no recurrences were registered. Only one patient (8.33%) presented 
with an asymptomatic bulging at follow-up. No cases of 
chronic pain or chronic mesh infection were identifed. No 
mortalities were recorded during follow-up.
Quality Of Life
EuraHS-QoL scores over time are shown (Figs. 2, 3, 4). The 
diferences were statistically signifcant between preoperative and 1-year scores for pain (p=0.05; moderate correlation) and restriction (p=0.01; very strong correlation) 
domains. The diference was also was statistically signifcant 
in all three domains between 1 and 2 postoperative years 
(pain, p=0.01; restriction, p=0.04; cosmetic, p=0.01; very 
strong correlation).
Discussion
This study described the association of ACS and PCS techniques for AWR, in exceptional surgical circumstances. 
The impossibility of closing posterior or anterior layers 
were the two main reasons for adding the detachment of 
the external oblique muscle to the TAR (Table 6). In our 
experience, after the lateral incision on the posterior rectus 
sheath, we perform an extended dissection in the retromuscular preperitoneal plane from the central tendon of 
the diaphragm to the Cooper’s ligaments, and from the 
psoas–quadratum lumborum of one side, to the contralateral homonymous muscles. However, despite this extensive dissection and patient optimization with botulinum 
injections and pneumoperitoneum, the impossibility of 
closing the posterior layer, composed of the remaining 
peritoneal sac and posterior rectus sheath, may occur. This 
situation may result from a lack or obliteration of these 
layers because of previous surgeries, scarred tissue or previous mesh infections. In these circumstances, the use of 
omentum, or absorbable meshes have been described [16, 
29, 30]. When the viscera cannot be returned to the abdomen, another surgical possibility is to reduce intra-abdominal volume by resection, in the following order, omentum, 
retroperitoneal lipomatosis or right hemicolectomy [31]. 
However, this last resection may lead to a postoperative

anastomotic dehiscence, in a potentially increased abdominal pressure environment that could be disastrous. To prevent this risk, adding an external oblique muscle release 
to the TAR could be a possibility in some extreme cases, 
as observed in one of our patients. In this case, the return 
of abdominal content before completely closing posterior 
layer resulted in an increased in abdominal pressure and 
respiratory parameters. The addition of an external oblique 
release provided enough volume, improving the respiratory parameters.  
The other surgical possibility after a TAR in challenging situations, is the impossibility of closing the anterior 
layer (linea alba). This layer usually consists of the rest of a 
retracted anterior aponeurosis of the rectus sheath that cannot be approximated. There are several reasons why a surgeon cannot perform closure of an anterior layer, despite a 
proper TAR (Table 6). Previous scars, infected meshes and 
the massive size of the defect could make it mechanically 
impossible to close. Also, too much tension on the abdomen may cause intra-abdominal hypertension or respiratory 
insufciency.

Surgical solutions have been described to deal with these 
conditions: myofascial faps, abdominal wall transplants, 
abdominal wall expanding systems, bridged repairs, staged 
repairs and in this study, adding an ACS to a PCS. Myofascial faps have been used for AWR to cover signifcant 
defects in the abdomen and skin [32]. However, we agree 
that pedical or free faps only provide soft tissue coverage 
of the intra-abdominal content [21]. Abdominal wall transplantation may also ofer viscera protection, however, these 
procedures are complicated and involve immunosuppression 
therapy that impairs wound healing, and may facilitate infection and other long-term side efects [33]. The use of an 
abdominal wall expanding system has also been proposed in 
reducing, intraoperatively, the distance of the fascial defect, 
[34, 35]. There is very limited experience in  this method. 
Another possibility is to perform a temporary abdominal 
wall closure, using a mesh that is progressively excised to 
allow defnite closure of the abdomen with a component 
separation [36]. In this initial report of staged repair, an 
average of six interval operations were necessary before the 
fnal operation. We consider that this staged surgery could 
be an option when increases in intra-abdominal pressure or 
respiratory insufciency are primary concerns.
The other possibility is the use of a bridged repair after 
the TAR, as previously described [16, 20, 21, 37]. When 
a TAR is performed, and the anterior layer is not entirely 
closed, synthetic mesh is secured at the edges of the anterior 
layer. In a recent study of 77 patients with bridged repairs, 
patient-reported outcomes were favorable [21]. However, 
these authors also described a very high recurrence rate of 
nearly 50%. High incidences of recurrences have also been 
reported when bridging with biological meshes [38, 39]. 
Therefore, we advocate full reconstruction of the midline 
as a relevant component in complex AWR. This poses the 
question; what approach is ideal in these challenging cases? 
A TAR with a bridged repair or a TAR adding an ACS? The 
answer will depend on the size and location of the surface 
to be bridged.
Combining external oblique muscles and TAR is considered dangerous, because of the potential instability to 
the abdominal wall, as the only lateral muscle that remains 
anatomically attached to its anatomical insertions is the 
internal oblique muscle. However, some anatomical concepts require thoughtful review. Despite the TAR, the TA 
muscle still maintains its attachment to the internal oblique 
muscle all along its surface and, inferiorly, it also contributes 
to the anterior rectus sheath below the linea arcuata. In the 
TAR, we only release the transversus abdominis from its 
anatomical insertion in the posterior rectus sheath. After 
the TAR, we do not observe the retraction of the TA muscle 
that is developed when the external oblique is released, due 
to the strong interconnections between the internal oblique 
and transversus where the neurovascular bundles from the 
intercostal nerves are coming. Also, the size of the synthetic 
mesh we currently use in the TAR, overlaps the release of 
the external oblique muscle and this way, we cover the possibility of a subsequent defect or bulging in that area (Fig. 1). 
Furthermore, it is possible to reinsert the TA muscle into the 
synthetic mesh, to avoid the partial disconnection of the TA 
[17]. It must be remembered that positive results were published for TAR after recurrences of ACS techniques [13]. In 
a recent report, 29 patients were treated with a combination 
of ACS and PCS by the release of external oblique muscle 
through a debatable posterior access between neurovascular 
bundles [40].
We do not want to encourage surgeons to perform ACS 
and PCS combinations, but surgical possibilities under 
challenging settings must be debated. There is no need

to remember the exceptional circumstances of this cohort 
of patients that associate severe comorbidities, multiple recurrences, big size of defects, and loss of domain 
(Figs. 5, 6). When dealing with these situations, the main 
objective of AWR is to provide abdominal wall continence. Combining ACS and TAR may provide closure 
of the abdomen and restore the connection between both 
sides of the abdominal wall. This continence was refected 
by satisfactory patient-reported outcomes in our study. 
This objective was particularly achieved for the youngest 
patient in our cohort, as he is now playing regular sports, 
after his AWR. In our opinion, these difcult cases should 
be treated in dedicated centers of AWR with enough level 
of expertise.
In our cohort, associated wound morbidity was high. It is 
superior to our reported outcomes of AWR [16], and those 
from the largest series of TAR [14]. We do not get lower 
SSO and SSOPI published in similar larger series [21], 
despite adequate patient optimization. The only diference in 
our cohort was that we had signifcantly more patients with 
panniculectomy, which could partially explain our higher 
morbidity. Although it is a short cohort of patients, the

long-term results obtained and the positive patient-reported 
outcomes are encouraging.
Study limitations
Our study had limitations. With our small number of cases, 
it was difcult to draw defnitive conclusions on the management of these highly complex repairs. We have not 
made comparisons with other surgical options, or other 
conservative non-operating approaches. However, a prospective group for comparison will be difcult, as the circumstances and etiopathogenesis that generate these complicated abdominal wall defects are infrequent and variable. 
Although all patients were followed-up clinically, a control 
CT scan was made available in only 66% of patients; therefore, a radiological recurrence could have been clinically 
missed. Although we have a mean follow-up of more than 
2 years, a longer follow-up would be ideal in confrming 
surgical durability and stability.
In conclusion, combining external oblique release with 
TAR may be considered a surgical alternative in addressing demanding surgical situations, where defect complexity 
and patient characteristics do not allow complete midline 
reconstruction. While the approach is associated with high 
morbidity and a long hospital recovery, long-term results 
and patient-reported outcomes are reassuring.
