Abstract
Objective: This study evaluated the effects of ultrasound combined with the homemade nitric oxide (NO) microbubble destruction on the in vitro proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
Furthermore, we studied whether or not irradiation of the NO micro-bubble combined with bone-marrow derived MSC
infusion had a better effect on treating myocardial infarction. The possible mechanism of MSC delivery into the
infarcted myocardium was also investigated.
Methods: The murine bone marrow-derived MSCs were isolated, cultured, irradiated, and combined with different
concentrations of NO microbubbles. MTT proliferation assay, annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection, migration assay,
and RT-PCR were performed 24 h after the irradiation. The NO micro-bubbles was a intravenously injected, followed
by the infusion of MSCs, which were labeled by CM-Dil. Myocardium was harvested 48 h later and the distribution of
MSCs was observed by laser scanning confocal microscope after frozen sectioning. Echocardiography, histological
examination, RT-PCR, and western blotting were performed four weeks after the cell transplantation.
Results: Ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO micro-bubbles had no significant impact on the proliferation or apoptosis
of MSCs. Transwell chamber findings demonstrated that MSCs migrated more efficiently in group that underwent
ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO micro-bubbles. The Real-time PCR results indicated that the expression of
CXCR4 was much higher in the group undergoing ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO micro-bubbles. The normalized
fluorescence intensity greatly increased in the group of US+NO micro-bubbles and the cardiac function was also
markedly improved. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the capillary density was much greater in the group
of US+NO micro-bubbles as compared to that of the other groups. RT-PCR and western blotting also revealed a
higher SDF-1 and VEGF expression in the group of US+NO micro-bubbles.
Conclusions: NO micro-bubbles could be used in the cell transplantation, which efficiently promoted the MSC
homing into the infarcted myocardium.

Introduction
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), as a main presentation of
ischemic heart diseases, is a leading cause of death all over
the world. Although the therapeutic strategies of pharmacologic
intervention, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary
artery bypass grafting can restore the blood flow and keep the
viable myocardium working, these approaches cannot restore
the normal cardiac functions as a result of myocardial necrosis.
Therefore, it is imperative to develop an effective therapeutic
approach to regenerate the myocardium and restore its normal
systolic and diastolic functions following AMI. Some recent
advances in cellular therapies, such as endothelial progenitor
cell (EPC) and mesenchymal stem cell-based strategies, have
demonstrated a great potential for the regeneration of
ischaemic tissue and the promotion of neovascularization [1-3].

Despite a large body of basic research and ongoing clinical
trials, the poor engraftment rate has limited the in vivo
reparative capacity of these cells. How to improve the
transplantation efficiency is still a remaining problem.
It has been reported that micro-bubble destruction under
ultrasound irradiation has created pores in the capillary walls.
This method has been applied for the targeted drug and gene
delivery into the arterial vasculature [4]. In 2006, Zen et al. [5]
reported that ultrasound combined with albumin micro-bubble
destruction greatly enhanced neovascularization by an
increase in the bone marrow mononuclear cell endothelial
attachment, leading to an improvement in blood perfusion and
cardiac function. However, these micro-bubbles were common
commercial injectable products without any biological factors.
Naturally, the targeted delivery could be subjected to certain
restrictions. Nitric oxide (NO) is a very important second
messenger and a fundamental factor in cardiovascular
homeostasis [6-8].
In this study, we intended to develop a new kind of microbubble, with NO loaded in its core. We evaluated the effects of
destruction on the in vitro proliferation, apoptosis, and
migration of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) due to
ultrasound combined with NO micro-bubbles. Furthermore, we
intended to study whether US irradiating NO micro-bubble
destruction combined with bone-marrow derived MSC infusion
had a better effect on treating myocardial infarction. Also, the
possible mechanisms of the MSC targeted delivery into the
infarcted myocardium was investigated.
Materials and Methods
Isolation, culture, and phenotype analysis of rat MSCs
The study protocol was complied with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National
Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were purchased from the Lab
Animal Center of Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Bone
marrow derived MSCs were isolated as previously described
[9]. Briefly, the SD rats were euthanatized and bone marrow
from tibias and femurs was flushed with PBS. Mononuclear
cells were separated by density-gradient centrifugation with
Ficoll-Paque™ (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala Sweden).
Cells were resuspended in DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Nonadherent cells were removed after 48 hours, replacing the
media every two to three days. The passaged cells were
cultured by using standard protocols. An MSC passage was
chosen from among the 3rd to 5th passage for all experimental
use. The morphological features and characteristic surface
makers detected by flow cytometry were used to identify the
MSCs as reported before.
The preparation of NO microbubbles
Since NO is unstable under general situation, we wrapped it
into the micro-bubbles. 1,2–Dipalmitoyl–sn–Glycero–3–
phosphoethanolamine–N-[Methoxy (Polyethylene glycol)-2000]
(DPPE-PEG2k) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.
(Alabaster, AL). The L-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC, lyophilized
powder) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. NO and all
the other reagents were analytical grade and were used as
received. PC/DPPE-PEG2k (95:5, molar ratio) was dissolved in
chloroform in a round-bottom flask. Chloroform was removed
under a vacuum evaporation until the thin film formed. A
phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH: 7.4±0.1) was added to the
dried lipid thin films to create a lipid concentration of 1 mg/mL.
The lipid suspension was then mixed well above the phase
transition temperature of the lipids (60°C) to form a milky
solution of multilamellar liposomes. Under the anaerobic
condition, the multilamellar liposome suspension was
continuously sonicated with a probe at 100 W with constant
purging using a steady (4 mL/min) stream of NO gas for 5 min
to form the lipid-encapsulated NO micro-bubbles. The mean
diameter of the bubbles was analyzed using N4 PLUS
Submicron Particle Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, USA).
Milli-Q pure water was used as the blank solution, where the
sample was added until an appropriate concentration was
indicated. Each sample was tested in triplicate. Samples in
solution were placed between the glass slides and observed
with an Axioskop 40 microscope equipped with a Coolsnap
MP3.3 camera (Carl Zeiss, Germany).
Assay effects of ultrasound combined with NO
microbubbles on the proliferation and apoptosis of
MSCs
The experiments were divided into two groups, including: the
blank control group and the ultrasound combined with NO
micro-bubble group. The NO micro-bubble group contained
1:20, 1:50, and 1:70 subgroups according to different
concentrations of NO micro-bubbles. MSCs were seeded at a
density of 5×105 cells per well, every other well in the 96-well
culture plates. The 96-well culture plate was then placed on the
surface of the double distilled water at the temperature of 37°C.
The ultrasonic probe was vertically placed about 8 cm to the
top of the culture plates and continuously irradiated for 60
seconds (1 MHz, 1 W/cm2). After ultrasonic intervention, the
cells were further incubated for 24 h and the proliferation and
apoptosis were assessed according to the following protocols.
1 Assessment of cell proliferation ability was performed
according to the MTT assay. The treatment method for the
MSCs in each group was the same as what was described
above and each group had eight parallel wells. At the culture
period, the cells were incubated with the MTT solution (Sigma,
USA) for 4 h. The medium was then removed and formazan
salts were dissolved with 150 µL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO,
Sigma, USA). Finally, the absorbance was measured at 490
nm with the Model 680 Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad,
American).
2 Cell apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
Detection Kit (Biovison, USA). Cells were resuspended in 500
µL of 1× Binding Buffer. A total of 5 µL of Annexin V-FITC and
5 µL of propidium iodide (PI 50 mg/ml, optional) were also
added, followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature in
the dark. The Annexin V-FITC binding was analyzed by flow
cytometry (Ex=488 nm; Em=530 nm) using FITC signal
detector. The PI staining was analyzed by the phycoerythrin
emission signal detector.

Assay effects of ultrasound combined with NO
microbubbles on the migration of MSCs
MSCs migration assay was utilized by a modified Transwell
chamber (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). The cells were
seeded in the upper chamber at a density of 1×105 cells/mL. A
total of 500 μL of the medium with 30 ng/mL SDF-1
(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added into the lower
compartment. The cell experiments were then divided into four
groups: control, ultrasound, ultrasound combined with
commercial micro-bubbles, and ultrasound combined with NO
micro-bubble groups. Commercial micro-bubbles were added
to the ultrasound combined with commercial microbubbles
group with a suitable concentration. The NO microbubbles
were added to the ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles
group with a suitable concentration (1:70). Also, equal amount
of PBS was added to the control and ultrasound groups. The
ultrasonic radiation (1MHz, 1 W/cm2) was started for 60 s for
the other three groups except for the control group. They were
then incubated for 24 hours in 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cells
without any migration were removed from the upper surface of
the filters using cotton swabs and those that migrated to the
lower surface of the filters were fixed in methanol, followed by
Crystal Violet staining. Migration was determined by counting
the cell numbers with a microscope at 100× magnification. Five
visual fields were randomly chosen for each assay. The
average number of the migrating cells in five fields was taken
as the cell migration number of the group. Experiments were
performed in sets of four for each group.
Real-time fluorescence quantitative Polymerase Chain
Reaction for CXCR4 expression
After migration, total RNA was isolated from the MSCs using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer’s
instruction. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using
an MBI RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI,
Lithuania). Cycle conditions were as follows: 94°C for 5 min
followed by 30 cycles (94°C denaturation for 30 s, 50°C
annealing for 30 s, and 72°C extension for 30 s), with a final
incubation at 72°C for 10 min. The following primers were
employed: CXCR4 sense: GCTGAGGAGCATGACAGACA and
CXCR4 antisense: GATGAAGGCCAGGATGAGAA; β-actin
sense: TGTCACCAACTGGGACGATA and β-actin antisense:
GGGGTGTTGAAGGTCT. The mRNA levels were normalized
by β-actin housekeeping gene. The Real-time PCR was
performed with an iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), using
SYBR-Green Master Mix (TOYOBO), Japan) in the 25-μL
reaction mixtures. All the experiments were repeated six times.
Myocardial infarction (MI) model establishment and
allogeneic stem cell implantation
This study was carried out in a strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NIH 1996). The protocol was approved by
the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of
Southeast University. All the surgeries were performed under
the sodium pentobarbital anesthesia and all efforts were made
to minimize the suffering.
The eight-week-old Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were
implemented with an abdominal anaesthesia by 2%
pentobarbital natrium (40 mg/kg). The airway was maintained
by endotracheal intubation. Myocardial infarction (MI) model
was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary
artery (LAD). A left thoracotomy was performed and the LAD
was ligated at a level immediately below the bottom of the left
atrium by irreversible tightening of a 6–0 suture loop [10]. The
bottom of the left atrium was used as a demarcation point to
ensure a consistent placement of the ligature and resultant
reproducibility of similar infarct sizes among the groups of
animals. A successful performance of coronary occlusion was
confirmed by regional cyanosis of the myocardial surface distal
to the suture, accompanied by a typical S-T segment elevation
on the electrocardiogram (ECG). One week later, the 42 MI
rats were alive. They were randomly divided into four groups
for cell therapy, including: US+NO microbubbles combined with
MSCs infusion group (group 1, n=12), US+commercial
microbubbles combined with MSCs infusion group (group 2,
n=10), MSCs (1×107 cells suspended in 2 ml PBS)
transplanted by the caudal vein injection group (group 3, n=10),
the PBS (2 ml) infusion without MSCs transplantation group
was set as control group (group 4, n=10). The MI rats of group
1 and 2 were irradiated with a therapeutic US system at the
frequency of 1 MHz, and the ultrasonic intensity was set at 1
W/cm2. Ultrasound probe was put to the anterior chest for 10
min after the intravenous injection of microbubbles, followed by
infusion of MSCs. All the MSCs were labeled by CM-Dil
(Introvigen, C7000, USA) before being transplanted. After 48 h
of cell transplantation, four rats were sacrificed in each group
and hearts were immediately harvested. The survival of
implanted cells were identified by the number of CM-Dilpositive cells in the frozen sections (8 μm in thickness) made
from hearts of MI under laser scanning confocal microscope,
and fluorescence intensity was used to reflect the transplanted
cell numbers. The fluorescence intensity of CM-Dil-positive
cells was evaluated by biological fluorescence image analysis
software (Olympus Fluoview Ver.2.1a).
Echocardiographic study
Transthoracic echocardiographic images of the hearts from
the rest of the 26 rats were obtained on 4th week post-cells
transplantation using an ultra high-resolution ultrasound
scanner (Vevo 2100 VisualSonics, Canada) under nembutal
anesthesia (the depth of anesthesia were almost the sane). For
the M-mode recordings, the parasternal short-axis view was
used to image the heart in two dimensions at the level of the
papillary muscles. The LV ejection fraction (EF) was recorded
along with LV cavity dimensions (end-diastolic and endsystolic).
Determination of capillary density
All the rats were sacrificed after the completion of
echocardiography, and the hearts were removed and paraffinembedded sections were made to study capillary density. The
sections were stained for capillary density using CD-31 primary
antibody (Santa cruz) and bounded antibody was detected with
Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA) and

visualized with DAB (Sigma). The 40× magnified pictures were
captured and used for CD-31 counting. For the quantitative
measurement, the number of CD-31-positive cells was counted
on the infarct border area from the endocardium through
epicardium of the midportion of the left ventricular free wall.
Five non-overlapping 400× magnification fields from four
sections of each heart were randomly selected. The capillary
density (CD) was averaged and expressed as the number of
capillaries per unit area, and the data were finally statistically
analyzed with SPSS.
RT-PCR and Western blotting
Tissues of the MI area were harvested and minced until the
tissues were fully grinded. Total RNA was extracted by using
the Trizol system (Invitrogen, USA) according to the
manufacturer's guidelines. It was then reverse-transcribed into
cDNA processed by the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Canada) and the addition of 25 μL of
SYBR Green (TOYOBO, Japan) to the reaction system. Rat
SDF-1 was amplified with the sense primer of 5’-
CCCTGCCGATTCTTTGAG-3 and the anti-sense primer of 5’-
GCTTTTCAGCCTTGCAACA-3’. The rat VEGF was amplified
with the sense primer of 5’-GCAGCTTGAGTTAAACGAACG-3’
and the anti-sense primer of 5’-AGTTCCCGAAACCCTGAG-3’.
Furthermore, β-actin was also amplified with the sense primer
of 5’-GCAGAAGGAGATTACTGCCCT-3’ and the anti-sense
primer of 5’-GCTGATCCACATCTGCTGGAA -3’ as a
housekeeping gene to normalize the expression target gene.
All the primers were used at a final concentration of 0.4 μmol/L.
The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 30 seconds at
95°C for pre-denaturation, 30 cycles for 15 seconds at 95°C for
denaturation, 1 minute at 59°C for annealing, and 10 seconds
at 72°C for elongation. At the end of each cycle, the
fluorescence emitted by the SYBR Green was measured. The
relative gene expression was analyzed by the 2-DDCt method.
All the experiments were repeated six times.
The tissues from the MI area were harvested and minced.
Western analysis was carried out using the following primary
antibodies: SDF-1 (1:500, Boster, China) and VEGF (1:400,
Boster, China). After an extensive washing, the
immunocomplexes were detected with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated appropriate secondary antibodies followed by
enhanced chemiluminescence reaction and the relative
expression of SDF-1 and VEGF were analyzed by one image
analysis software.
Statistical analyses
All the values are presented as mean±standard deviation.
Results were compared by one-way ANOVA and Student
Newman Keuls test. Statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS 18 software. A value of p<0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.
Results
The characteristics of MSCs
Density gradient centrifugation culture method was used in
the isolation and cultivation of MSCs. The morphological
features were observed and the characteristic surface makers
were detected by flow cytometry. Most of the cultured MSCs
were spindle shaped and became more uniform after several
passages (Figure 1). These expanded MSCs were uniformly
positive for CD44 (99.34%) and CD29 (99.35%), and negative
for CD34 (1.47%) and CD45 (1.56%).
The characteristics of NO microbubbles
The average mean size of the NO microbubbles was found
to be 3.85 μm with a polydisperity index of 0.699. The NO
concentration was about 1.33×10-9 mmol per microbubble. The
microbubble concentration was about 6-8×106 per milliliter. The
microscopic images under the light microscopic observation
indicated the regular spherical morphology as shown in Figure
2.
Effects of ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles
on the proliferation and apoptosis of MSCs
The MTT assay was used to assess the proliferation of
MSCs, which were treated by the ultrasound combined with NO
microbubbles. The OD values were obtained using a reading
plate at 490 nm. The relative growth rates were 0.94±0.06,
0.94±0.05, and 0.67±0.04 in the ultrasound combined with 1:70
NO microbubbles group (NO (1:70)), ultrasound combined with
1:50 NO microbubbles group (NO (1:50)), and ultrasound
combined with 1:20 NO microbubbles group (NO (1:20)),
respectively. We found that the proliferation of MSC was
significantly decreased in the ultrasound combined with 1:20
NO microbubble group (p<0.05), but there was no significant
difference in the ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO
microbubbles group, ultrasound combined with 1:50 NO
microbubble group, and the control group. Ultrasound
combined with 1:70 NO microbubbles did not significantly
inhibit cell proliferation as assessed by the MTT assay.
The representative apoptosis of the MSC was obtained from
flow cytometry. The mean percentage of MSC apoptosis were
2.9±1.1%, 3.4±0.9%, 7.9±1.8%, and 19.8±2.9% in the control
group (Control), ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO
microbubbles group (NO (1:70)), ultrasound combined with
1:50 NO microbubbles group (NO (1:50)), and ultrasound
combined with 1:20 NO microbubbles group (NO (1:20)),
respectively. The percentage of the apoptotic cells was
significantly higher in the ultrasound combined with 1:50 NO
microbubbles group and ultrasound combined with 1:20 NO
microbubbles group in comparison with the control group
(p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between
the ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO microbubbles group and
control group. Ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO
microbubbles did not significantly increase the MSC apoptosis.

Effects of ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles
on the migration of MSCs
As shown above, the ultrasound combined with 1:70 NO
microbubbles were relatively safe for the MSCs. Therefore, the
consternation of 1:70 was chosen to verify the role of
ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles in the MSCs’
migration. We performed a Transwell migration assay, which
was routinely used to study cell migration in response to
specific signal stimuli. As shown in Figure 3, the MSCs treated
with ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles migrated
more efficiently as compared to the other groups (p<0.05).

Crystal Violet staining was performed to determine the
number of migrated cells. Figure 3 (A) demonstrates the image
of the MSCs, which migrated to the bottom of the wells in the
control group. Figure 3 (B) is the image of the MSCs, which
migrated to the bottom of the wells in the ultrasound only
group. Figure 3 (C) is the image of the MSCs, which migrated
to the bottom of the wells in the ultrasound combined with
commercial microbubbles group. Figure 3 (D) is the image of
the MSCs, which migrated to the bottom of the wells in the
ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles group. The mean
number of the migrated MSCs were 58.5±7.47, 32.71±7.10,
19.44±7.21, and 4.80±2.52, respectively. Ultrasound combined
with NO microbubbles increased the number of migrated MSCs
(p<0.05).
Effects of ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles
on the expression of CXCR4
Quantitative Real-time PCR was used to assess effects of
ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles on the expression
of CXCR4 in MSCs. As shown in Figure 4, CXCR4 expression
was significantly higher in the ultrasound combined with NO
microbubbles group as compared to the other groups (p<0.05).
Identification of engrafted MSCs
All the cultured MSCs could be labeled with CM-Dil, and CMDil positive cells were stained in phospholipid bilayer
membranes in red under laser scanning confocal microscope
(Figure 5(A-D)). The CM-Dil positive cells were located in the
infarcted and border areas, while there were nearly none in the
normal myocardium. The mean fluorescence intensity was
3140.2±317.1, 2408.9±276.3, 1084.1±241.7, and 617.5±209.3,
respectively, from picture A to D (Table 1). Quantification
analysis showed that there was a significant difference
between group 1 and the other three groups (P<0.05).
Improvement in cardiac function
After the MSC transplantation, the left ventricle systolic
function was improved and there was also a significant EF
difference between group 1 and 2 (61.27±4.69% and
53.35±3.29%; P<0.05). The same trend was observed for
group 1 and 3 (61.27±4.69% and 45.91±4.57%; P<0.05], and
group 2 and 4 (61.27±4.69% and 44.16±5.72%; P<0.050.
Figure 6 (A- D) showed that EF% was higher in group 1 as
compared to that of the group 2, group 3, and group 4. All the p
values were less than 0.05. Table 2 shows the S-N-K Test for
the four groups.

was 58.5±7.47, 32.71±7.10, 19.44±7.21, and 4.80±2.52, respectively. Ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles increased the
number of migrated MSCs (p<0.05).

Immunohistochemical analysis of capillary density
Four weeks after the MSC delivery, we assessed whether
NO microbubbles had an effect on enhancing neovasculature
formation. Indeed, quantification of capillaries revealed that
group 1 had a significantly higher capillary density (46±6) as
compared to that of the group 2 (34±5) (p<0.05), group 3
(22±4) (p<0.05), and group 4 (18±8) (p<0.05) (Figure 7A-D,
Table 3). This finding indicated that ultrasound combined with
NO microbubbles mediated the MSC transplantation, which

could augment the capillary density as a beneficial effect for
myocardial repair.
Expression of SDF-1 and VEGF with RT-PCR and
Western blotting
RT-PCR results showed that the level of SDF-1 and VEGF
(Table 4) in the infarcted zone was higher in group 1 as
compared to that of the group 2, 3, and 4 (all the P values were
less than 0.05). Western blotting results showed that the level
of SDF-1 (Figure 8, Table 4) in the infarcted zone was higher in
group 1 as compared to that of the group 3 and 4 (the P values
were both less than 0.05). However, there was no statistical
differences between group 1 and 2 (P>0.05). Western blotting
results showed that the level of VEGF (Figure 8, Table 4) in the
infarcted zone was higher in group 1 as compared to that of the
group 2, 3, and 4 (all the P values were less than 0.05).

Discussion
Myocardial infarction is characterized by extensive necrosis
of cardiomyocytes, which causes irreversible deterioration of
cardiac function. Recent researches have shown that the
transplantation of stem cells for the repair of myocardial
necrosis is a safe and effective method for the treatment of
ischemic cardiomyopathy [11]. Because of the ability of the
self-renewal and multiple differentiation potential, the MSC
becomes good candidates for experimental and clinical
applications in stem cell therapy of acute myocardial infarction
[12]. However, poor cell viability associated with transplantation
has limited the reparative capacity of these cells in vivo. How to
improve the transplantation efficiency is still a remaining
question.
Microbubbles were originally developed as contrast agents
for ultrasonic imaging and diagnosis [13]. Recently, the
therapeutic use of microbubbles has become an emerging
methodology [14,15] with a high potential for the enhanced
directed therapeutic gene, drug, bioactive gas, and stem cell
delivery [16]. In these studies, commercial and homemade
microbubbles were mostly composed of low-solubility gases,
such as SF6 or C3F8, and a coating of biodegradable material,
such as albumin, phospholipids, or polymers. The gaseous free

radical NO is an important regulator of a variety of biological
functions, especially in the cardiovascular system [17].
However, it can be easily oxidized to nitrate or nitrite under
general situation due to its short half-life of only 3-5 s, which
could greatly influence its application in the clinical and
experimental study. Because of the fact that microbubbles
could be stabilized as a new type of biological vector, we
wrapped NO into the microbubbles. The novel NO
microbubbles could burst to release NO into the targeted
tissues. As shown in the results, we have successfully
fabricated the NO microbubbles, with the mean size of 3.85 μm
(1.33×10-9 mmol NO in each microbubble).
The previous studies have demonstrated the safety of the
commercial microbubbles [18]. However, there have been no
studies about these novel NO microbubbles. Our pervious
study indicated that ultrasound with low intensity 0.25 W/cm2
and frequency of 1 MHz had no adverse effect on the
proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of the endothelial
progenitor cells. So we applied the same ultrasonic parameters
in this study. The results demonstrated that ultrasound (1 W/
cm2, 1MHz) combined with a suitable concentration of NO
microbubbles (1:70) had no significant influence on the
proliferation and apoptosis of MSCs, which was relatively safe
to MSCs in vitro and provided more evidence for further studies
in vivo.
For the statement mentioned above, we made an innovative
use of the ultrasound mediated NO microbubble destruction to
promote the MSC homing for the therapy of myocardial
infarction. The previous studies have demonstrated that the
ultrasound combined with microbubbles could enhance the
effect of the cell transplantation in MI treatment [19], but there
was no report about the NO microbubble. In our studies, we
found that the number of CM-Dil positive cells in the MI area of
the US+NO Microbubbles+MSC group was significantly larger
than that of the US+Microbubbles+MSCs group, the MSCs
group, and the control group. This observation showed that the
ultrasound combined with NO microbubble delivery system
might have a higher efficiency of prompting the homing and
gathering of MSCs to the area of MI. It is well known that
SDF-1/CXCR4 plays a very important role in stem cell homing
[20], so we made a much more comprehensive study of its
mechanism both in vivo and in vitro. In the in vitro experiments,
we found that the MSCs under ultrasound combined with NO
microbubbles migrated more efficiently and the RT-PCR results
revealed that the CXCR4 expression was higher in the US+NO
microbubble group. In the in vivo experiments, higher
expression of SDF-1 was found in the US+NO Microbubbles
+MSCs group as compared to that of the US+Microbubbles
+MSCs group, the MSCs group, and the control group. The
high expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 might have been
involved in the enhanced attachment of transfused MSCs onto
the targeted area. Furthermore, Li et al. [21] reported that the
myocardial permeability was improved in the ultrasound
irradiation area, which facilitated the homing and gathering of
the MSCs into the MI area.
From the echocardiography, we found that the post-infarction
left ventricular function improved most in the US+NO
microbubbles+MSCs group as compared to the other three
groups. It was also reported that the improvement of the left
ventricular function was mainly due to the neovascularization
and inhibition in fibrosis and LV remodeling. Among these
factors, neovascularization was considered to be one of the
most important mechanisms of the MI recovery. It could
improve the myocardium perfusion and preserved the stunned
cardiomyocytes and surviving myocytes from the post-ischemic
apoptosis. VEGF has been known to be a multifunctional
cytokine that contributes to angiogenesis by both direct and
indirect mechanisms. It is reported to be a major contributor to

angiogenesis by increasing the number of new capillaries. After
myocardial infarction, ischemia and hypoxia stimulates the
VEGF autocrine activity. Song et al. [22] have reported that the
therapeutic ultrasound-mediated microbubble cavitation
induced the VEGF secretion and angiogenesis in the normal
skeletal muscles. Furthermore, in this study, we used
ultrasound combined with NO microbubbles infusion to mediate
the MSC delivery. Compared with the US+microbubbles+MSCs
group, the MSCs group, and the control group, the US+NO
microbubbles+MSCs group revealed a remarkable upregulation in the VEGF expression. At the same time, the
capillary density was also increased.
In summary, our study has demonstrated that an intravenous
infusion of MSCs combined with US+NO microbubbles
enhanced the targeted delivery of the MSCs into the infarcted
myocardium and induced the regional angiogenic response. It
was beneficial for an improvement of LV perfusion and cardiac
function of the ischemic heart. These findings suggested that
this novel cell delivery approach might be feasible and efficient
in the treatment of MI.
