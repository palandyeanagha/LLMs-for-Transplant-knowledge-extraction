Abstract
Background: The hepatitis E virus (HEV) has a global distribution and is known to have caused
large waterborne epidemics of icteric hepatitis. Transmission is generally via the fecal-oral route.
Some reports have suggested parenteral transmission of HEV. Anti-HEV prevalence data among
chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients are few and give conflicting results.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in August of 2004. We tested 324 chronic
HD patients attending three different units in the city of Tabriz, northwestern part of Iran, for antiHEV antibody. A specific solid- phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (Diapro, Italy) was used.
Results: The overall seroprevalence of hepatitis E was 7.4 %(95% CI: 4.6%–10.6%). The prevalence
rate of HBV and HCV infection were 4.6% (95% CI: 2.3%–6.9%) and 20.4% (95% CI: 16%–24.8%),
respectively. No significant association was found between anti-HEV positivity and age, sex,
duration of hemodialysis, positivity for hepatitis B or C virus infection markers and history of
transfusion.
Conclusion: We observed high anti-HEV antibody prevalence; there was no association between
HEV and blood borne infections (HBV, HCV, and HIV) in our HD patients. This is the first report
concerning seroepidemiology of HEV infection in a large group of chronic HD individuals in Iran.
Background
The causative agent of hepatitis E, hepatitis E virus (HEV)
had provisionally been classified into the caliciviridae
family, but in the most recent ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) classification, HEV has
been placed in its own taxonomic group within the class
IV (+) sense RNA viruses, "Hepatitis E-like viruses" [1,2].
Hepatitis E is an important public health concern in many
developing countries of Southeast and Central Asia, the

Middle East, northern and western parts of Africa, and
Mexico, where the occurrence of outbreaks have been
reported [3-7]. Although the overall mortality rate associated with HEV infection is low, it is reportedly as high as
20% in infected pregnant women [8,9].
Transmission of HEV occurs primarily by the fecal-oral
route through contaminated water supplies in developing
countries. Recent studies have indicated that zoonosis is
involved in the transmission of HEV, especially in industrialized countries where hepatitis E had been believed to
be non-endemic [10,11]. Further, vertical transmission of
HEV from infected mothers to their children has been
observed [12]. Also dental treatments were suspected as
risk factors for HEV contamination [13]. It has been
reported that a substantial proportion of blood donors
(3/200 or 1.5%) were positive for HEV RNA and viremic
blood donors are potentially able to cause transfusionassociated hepatitis E in areas of high endemicity [14,15].
Patients on chronic hemodialysis have an increased risk of
exposure to nosocomially-transmitted agents, and the
possibility of transmission of HEV in this group of
patients had been raised. Reports on the prevalence and
possible nosocomial transmission of HEV in patients on
hemodialysis (HD) are scant. Some authors observed a
high prevalence of anti-HEV antibody in their hemodialysis patients and hypothesized that the fecal-oral route may
not be the only route of transmission of HEV among their
patients [16]. Other investigators, in contrast, found few
anti-HEV-positive patients in their HD populations
[17,18]. Moreover, in most of these reports a small
number of patients were studied.
To our knowledge, the seroprevalence rate of anti- HEV
among HD patients in Iran has not been examined. Iran is
a country with few suspected outbreaks of HEV [19].
These findings prompted the present study to establish
the prevalence of anti-HEV antibody among HD patients
in the city of Tabriz in the northwestern part of Iran.
Methods
Patients
This study was carried out in Tabriz, northwestern part of
Iran with about 3.5 million residents. We studied all
patients (n = 324) on chronic hemodialysis treatment at
three different dialysis units in Tabriz in August 2004.
Routine HD techniques were performed with 3 or 4-hours
treatments three times a week. Blood samples were
obtained from all the patients for serological testing.
Information was obtained from the medical records of the
patients on the duration of hemodialysis and etiology of
renal failure. In addition, a questionnaire was completed
for each subject detailing the age, sex, and history of blood
transfusion.
Laboratory assay
Blood samples were taken from each patient before the
hemodialysis session, and the serum was separated without delay. Sera were stored at -20°C, coded and further
tested at the laboratory of Research Center for Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases (Taleghani Hospital, Tehran)
for anti-HEV IgG by enzyme immunometric assay
(Diapro, Italy HEV EIA) according to the manufacturer's
instruction. Cut-off was defined with positive and negative control sera that were included in each assay, according to manufacturer's instruction. Samples were
considered positive if the optical density (OD) value was
above the cut-off value and all positive samples were
retested in duplicate with the same EIA assay to confirm
the initial results. All patients were previously tested for
HBs Ag (Diasorin, USA), anti-HCV (Third generation
assay, Diasorin, USA) and anti-HIV (Biotest, Germany) by
EIA assay.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (version 11)
statistical software (Scientific Package for Social Sciences,
Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics were reported. Continuous variables were summarized as mean ± SD, and comparisons were performed with use of t-test for unpaired
samples. The chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and MannWhitney test were used to compare the proportions
between groups. The level of significance was set at a P
value of <0.05. The study was endorsed by the responsible
ethics committee.
Results
Three hundred and twenty four patients were tested. There
were 190 (59%) males, and 134 (41%) females; the mean
age (± SD) was 53.5 ± 15.1 years. The median duration of
HD treatment was 27 months (range1–261 months). The
chronic renal failure of the patients was due to glomerulonephritis (n = 113), diabetic nephropathy (n = 73),
nephroangiosclerosis (n = 28), polycystic kidney disease
(n = 22), chronic interstitial nephritis (n = 5) and other
etiologies (n = 83). No patient admitted a history of intravenous drug use.
There were twenty-four of 324 chronic hemodialysis
patients showing anti-HEV antibody, the anti-HEV prevalence in our population was 7.4% (95%CI: 4.6%–10.6%).
There were 15/324(4.6%) patients with persistent HBV
infection (HBs Ag positive) and 66/324 (20.4%) patients
were anti-HCV antibody positive. All the patients were
seronegative for anti-HIV antibody. Table 1 shows the
patient characteristics in relation to the presence of HEV
coinfection. No statistically significant difference was seen
between anti-HEV positive and negative patients with
respect to age, sex, incidence of blood transfusion and
other blood borne infections (HBV, HCV, and HIV).

The duration of hemodialysis ranged between1 and 121
months (median 26) for anti-HEV positive patients and
between 1 and 261 months (median 27) for the anti-HEV
negative one with no significant difference (Mann-Whitney P = 0.73).
Discussion
Studies concerning HEV epidemiology among chronic
HD patients are few and give conflicting results. Difference of HEV prevalence in the general population, the criteria for inclusion of patients, and the routes of HEV
transmission could partially explain the diverse results
found.
HEV is usually associated with the fecal-oral route, and
blood is not considered an important cause of HEV transmission as the virus dose not produces a chronic carrier
state [3]. However, experimental transmission of HEV to
man showed a transient phase of viremia proceeding the
onset of clinical symptoms and prolonged viremia has
been observed in some patients [20-22]. Therefore, a theoretical possibility of HEV transmission in endemic areas
via a parenteral route has been suggested. Such a possibility is supported by the observation that anti-HEV antibody is more frequent in transfusion recipients than in the
same number of non-transfused controls [23].
We found that the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was 7.4 %
in chronic HD patients attending three different units in
the city of Tabriz, northwestern part of Iran. There were
few reports on suspected outbreaks of HEV in Iran [19]
and a population-based study indicated that the prevalence rate of IgG anti-HEV among healthy population was
9.6% [24]. The observation that anti-HEV prevalence rate
in HD patients in our study (7.4%) is lower than in the
previous general population-based study (9.6%)might be
due to differences in the population, the size of the sample studied or situation of public health services. In Iran,
large cities have better public health services, such as clinics, municipal water and sewage systems, possibly
explaining the reduced risk of infection. These factors
need to be further evaluated.
The detection of IgG anti-HEV in 7.4% of chronic HD provides additional evidence that HEV is endemic in Iran.
Similar findings have been reported from Saudi Arabia
[25], where 7.2% of HD patients were detected for IgG
anti- HEV. In contrast, the prevalence of IgG anti-HEV in
patients at the hemodialysis unit of non- endemic countries was significantly low [26-28]. The prevalence of HEV
vary in different hemodialysis units, relatively independent of the prevalence in the general population and probably reflect the difference in the epidemiological
characteristics of HEV in areas of low and high endemicity
[27,29]. Apart from socioeconomic and environmental
factors, intra-unit factors that may be associated with HEV
transmission in some hemodialysis units needs to be evaluated further [29].
No statistically significant association was observed
between HEV seropositivity and blood-borne viruses
(HBV, HCV and HIV). One study has shown a striking
association between hepatitis C and HEV, pointing to
similar or overlapping routes of transmission [30]. Such
an observation is in contrast with our finding. HEV infection, as detected by anti-HEV antibody, was associated
with no risk factor in most patients.
Conclusion
This cross-sectional study showed a high prevalence of
anti-HEV antibody in our HD Patients; we didn't find
association between HEV and blood-borne viruses.
A careful surveillance in the general population is
required and further appropriate investigations are
needed to identify the exact mode of transmission and
risk groups for this infection in Iran.
