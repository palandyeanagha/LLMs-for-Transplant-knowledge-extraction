Abstract
The management of tyrosinaemia type 1 (HT1, fumarylacetoacetase deficiency) has been revolutionised by the
introduction of nitisinone but dietary treatment remains essential and the management is not easy. In this review
detailed recommendations for the management are made based on expert opinion, published case reports and
investigational studies as the evidence base is limited and there are no prospective controlled studies.
The added value of this paper is that it summarises in detail current clinical knowledge about HT1 and makes
recommendations for the management.
Keywords: Hepatorenal tyrosinaemia, Fumarylacetoacetase, Succinylacetone, Nitisinone, Cirrhosis, Acute live failure,
Hepatocellular carcinoma, Low tyrosine diet
Methodology
This ad hoc working group was chosen from those in
Europe and Canada who had the greatest experience and
number of patients with HT1. The literature was
reviewed and as a result it was decided that it was insufficient to warrant writing formal guidelines and instead
only recommendations were written. The first draft was
written by the chairman (JVL) and revised in a workshop. Subsequent revisions were circulated and after
repeated iterations finally agreed.
Introduction
Tyrosinaemia type 1 (HT1) is caused by a defect in the
final enzyme of the pathway of the degradation of tyrosine,
namely fumarylacetoacetase (FAH, EC 3.7.1.2, Figure 1).
As a result of the metabolic block toxic metabolites are
formed including succinylacetone, maleylacetoacetate and
fumarylacetoacetate. These are responsible for severe disruption of intracellular metabolism of the liver and kidney.
For more details of the biochemistry, molecular genetics
and pathophysiology see [1]. HT1 has a birth incidence of
approximately 1 in 100,000 in most areas but is more
common in some regions, notably in Quebec, Canada [2].
Nitisinone is a compound that has revolutionised the
management of tyrosinaemia type 1 [3,4]. It is a potent
inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme that is upstream of fumarylacetoacetase (Figure 1).
As a result the flux through the pathway is markedly
reduced and in most patients there is a rapid decrease in
the concentrations of succinylacetone, an increase in tyrosine and a clear clinical improvement.
The purpose of this article is to review current management and to develop recommendations that should assist
with the clinical management of HT1. However there is
little evidence base for the management of HT1 so these
recommendations are largely based on studies already
published [5,6], on expert opinion and unpublished data.
Clinical presentation and diagnosis
Most patients will present clinically in regions without a
specific newborn screening programme for tyrosinaemia
type 1 although a few may be identified because of
affected siblings or abnormalities of plasma or urine
aminoacids. However the latter cannot be relied on and
most patients will therefore still present with symptoms.
Clinical illness
The main organs that are affected are the liver, kidney
and peripheral nerves.

Hepatic disease
The liver is the organ that is usually most severely
affected. Acute liver failure with onset in the first weeks
or months of life is common with clotting abnormalities,
ascites and oedema secondary to hypoalbuminaemia.
Haemorrhage is frequent but jaundice is usually mild
and the plasma aminotransferases may be only slightly
or moderately elevated. Patients go on to develop cirrhosis, liver nodules and hepatocellular carcinoma. They
may also present with any of these at a later age without
liver failure. On clinical examination the liver is firm or
even hard. Hypoglycaemia may by caused by liver failure
and hyperinsulinism [7].
Renal disease
The characteristic renal disease is a tubular disorder with
a Fanconi syndrome, the severity of which is variable.
Although the typical features include aminoaciduria,
glycosuria, phosphaturia and renal tubular acidosis, they
may not all be present. Patients may develop hypophosphataemic rickets, which can be severe. The renal disease
may progress with nephrocalcinosis, glomerulosclerosis
and chronic renal failure. Although renal disease may be
the predominant feature, there is always some co-existing
liver disease of varying severity.
Neurological disease
The most characteristic neurological problem is a
porphyria-like syndrome usually precipitated by intercurrent infection. The crises, which may be severe, are
characterised initially by pain (including abdominal pain
mimicking an acute surgical emergency), weakness and
autonomic changes such as hypertension. Patients may
develop an acute progressive ascending motor neuropathy, often with respiratory distress requiring assisted
ventilation.
Timing of presentation
Patients may present in infancy, childhood or as adults
[1,8]. The presentation can be variable, even within one
family. The age of presentation broadly correlates with
severity.
Acute
These patients present before the age of six months, the
most severe between 0–2 months [8], usually with a severe liver disease characterised particularly by a synthetic
failure. This is the most common presentation. These
patients are particularly susceptible to infections [9].
Sub-acute
These patients present with progressive liver disease
usually also in the first year of life that is usually less severe
than the younger patients. The main features are coagulopathy, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly and rickets.
Chronic
These patients are more than one year old and present
mainly with liver and/or renal disease. The illness may
be complicated by cardiomyopathy [10] and neurological
problems such as porphyria-like episodes. Cirrhotic liver
changes are generally already present.
Newborn screening
Newborn screening for HT1 is not widely available because of the rarity of HT1 in most areas. However
together with early treatment with nitisinone and diet, it
is the medical management of choice [11,12]. Recent
studies have shown confirmed this [13] Newborn screening
is best performed using succinylacetone (SA) as a primary
marker because it is sensitive and specific. Blood spot
tyrosine is neither specific nor sensitive. Although biochemical abnormalities may be identified shortly after
birth [14], babies with HT1 are rarely symptomatic in the
first days of life. Newborn screening enables treatment of
children who are not yet clinically ill. However newborn
babies diagnosed by screening have markedly raised AFP
levels [15] and mild abnormalities of coagulation.
Figure 1 Tyrosine degradation pathway: HT1 is caused by a
defect in the fumarylacetoacetase. Succinylacetone is a potent
inhibitor of 5-aminolaevulinate dehydratase. Nitisinone inhibits
4-hydydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase reducing flux through
the pathway.

Investigations
Diagnostic tests
The most useful test is for succinylacetone that may be
measured in plasma, dried blood spot as used in newborn screening (DBS) or urine. This is highly specific
and sensitive. SA may not be detected in routine organic
acids analyses in urine, particularly if the concentration
of SA very low or the urine very dilute so specific assays
may be needed. Testing is urgent if tyrosinaemia type 1
is suspected.
Baseline tests
Initial tests for HT1 should include the following:
Blood/ plasma
Blood gases
Liver function tests: bilirubin, aspartate and alanine
aminotransferase (AST, ALT),
alkaline phosphatase, γ glutamyl transpeptidase (γGT)
albumin.
Coagulation: Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin
time, fibrinogen,
Urea and electrolytes, creatinine
Calcium, phosphate
Glucose and ammonia (in acute liver failure)
Full blood count
Aminoacids (quantitative)
α-fetoprotein (AFP)
Succinylacetone (if available. Note: plasma SA is
protein bound and is a better test with which to
monitor metabolic control than urine SA [16], although
urine SA is more widely available at present.
Urine
Glucose
Aminoacids
Tubular re-absorption of phosphate (TRP)
Calcium/creatinine ratio
Albumin, protein, β2-microglobulin
Organic acids and succinylacetone (Note: Routine organic acid analysis may not be sufficiently sensitive)
Interpretation: Initial tests may show evidence of liver
disease, usually with a striking disorder of clotting.
Plasma amino acids may show raised tyrosine as well as
raised methionine, abnormalities that are consistent with
any severe liver disease. AFP is usually markedly raised
but it is not specific.
Imaging
Imaging for hepatic disease is important, particularly at
presentation. All patients should have an ultrasound
examination of the liver and kidneys initially and thereafter at regular intervals. If nodules are present in the
liver further imaging, preferably by MRI, should be done.
However there is no single ideal method. To some degree the method chosen will depend on the resources
and facilities available.
Ultrasound with high resolution transducers and colourdoppler remains the first modality of choice. It is rapid
and safe allowing identification of the echogenicity of the
parenchyma and nodular lesions as small as 2 mm in
diameter. Colour-doppler can be used to assess the hepatic
vessels and portal hypertension. However not all nodules
may be detected and the technique is operator dependent.
Multi detector CT scan is quick and enables multiplanar imaging with good spatial resolution of abnormalities
in the liver. Contrast may improve the detail, enabling
identification of malignant change. However, a risk-benefit
analysis is mandatory to avoid radiation in children
already at risk of malignancy so it requires repeated evaluation. Sedation is sometimes required
MRI has emerged as the best technique to help in differentiating nodules in children with chronic liver disease, because of its ability to identify different tissues
properties. After intravenous gadolinium injection dynamic sequences provide analysis of nodule vascularisation. Diffusion-weighted imaging may help to distinguish
well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas from benign nodules [17,18], C Dionisi Vici and L Monti unpublished. However it requires some form of sedation in
many children.
Conclusion: All patients should have an ultrasound
examination of the liver and kidneys. If nodules are
present in the liver further imaging, preferably by MRI,
should be done.
Bone X-ray (for those with a definite tubulopathy):
wrist or chest
Immediate management
An outline flow diagram for the management of patients
with tyrosinaemia type 1 is shown in Figure 2.
As soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, or even suspected
because of liver disease and appropriate investigations
have been sent, start nitisinone (NTBC, OrfadinW,) in a
dose of 1 mg/kg/d once a day as the half life is 54 hrs
[19,20]. A dose of 2 mg/kg/d should be given for 48 hours
for those in acute severe liver failure. An alternative
approach is to give all patients in liver failure nitisinone at
a dose of 2 mg/kg/d from the start and allow the dose to
fall with growth to 1 mg/kg/d before increasing it. Nitisinone can only be given orally (or by naso-gastric tube). It
is imperative to do so quickly to prevent further liver and
kidney damage and avoid potentially major complications
such as haemorrhage. The risk of long term complications
is also reduced [16]. Details of potential side effects of
nitisinone are listed in the appendix.

http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/8

The patient should also be started on a low tyrosine and
low phenylalanine diet. If plasma tyrosine concentrations
are raised a high energy diet with a phenylalanine and
tyrosine free aminoacid supplement should be given
(0.5-1.0 g/kg/d) but natural protein should be introduced
early and certainly once plasma tyrosine concentrations
are falling. If plasma tyrosine concentrations are initially
normal or only slightly raised, natural protein should generally be introduced at the outset. Fructose and galactose
from should be excluded until the diagnosis of galactosaemia and fructosaemia have been excluded.
Patients, particularly younger ones, may be seriously ill
and require intensive supportive measures including clotting factors albumin electrolytes, correction of acid–base
status and aggressive treatment of infections [9]. Children
with a plasma bilirubin concentration of more than
100 μmol/l, plasma ammonia of more than 100 μmol/l or
with severe acute liver failure at presentation should be
discussed with a liver transplant centre at an early stage.
Monitoring tests
The essential investigations to check the response and to
monitor progress are liver function tests, AFP, coagulation studies, quantitative plasma aminoacids and quantitative blood or urine succinylacetone.
Response to nitisinone
The response to nitisinone is usually rapid. Coagulation
usually improves within 48 hours and all patients should
respond within a week. Succinylacetone in the urine and
blood should no longer be detectable after the first
24 hours.
The concentrations of plasma tyrosine and urine
phenolic acids will increase as a result of the inhibition
of the 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase although
the increase in these should be blunted by the diet.
AFP will fall more slowly, usually logarithmically. It
there is not a steady fall, check the liver imaging carefully. It can take up to one year or even longer for the
AFP to fall to the target value < 10 ng/l.
Failure to respond
Normally there is a marked improvement in the liver
function and coagulation within less than one week but,
if the liver function does not normalise or succinylacetone can still be detected in plasma and/or urine, then
first check compliance and the dosing. If nitisinone is
being given correctly, then the dose should be increased
to 2 mg/kg/d, if not already receiving that dose. As the
plasma concentrations in individuals are variable [16], if
rapid assay of plasma nitisinone level is available it may
be useful in detecting problems.
Recovery from severe liver failure is possible but the
time taken to do so is variable in severely ill patients. In
such patients, management must be individualized during
the early days of nitisinone treatment. If the patient
deteriorates, as judged by coagulation, liver function (progressive jaundice or hyperammonaemia) or signs of encephalopathy, then orthotopic liver transplantation should
be considered.
Long term management
Before the advent of nitisinone major complications of
HT1 including cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma and porphyria-like syndrome were frequent.
Even when being treated with nitisinone, there are still
important risks of long term complications of HT1,
most importantly hepatocellular carcinoma. All patients
must be followed carefully.
Medication
Nitisinone must be continued without interruption. Failure to do so may precipitate serious complications including acute liver failure, a neurological crisis [21] or
even hepatic malignant change.
On the standard dose of 1 mg/kg/d, the plasma concentrations in individuals that suppress SA are variable
[16,20]. Adjustments of the dose based on plasma nitisinone concentrations may be indicated. However the target NTBC concentrations in plasma are uncertain and
vary from 30-50 μM [22]. Some prefer to maintain the
concentration above 50 μM [23], G Mitchell personal
communication. Others use a value greater than 40 μM
[C De Laet and P Goyens personal communication].
However lower doses of nitisinone have been found to
be effective [24,25]. In one case the serum nitisinone
concentration was only maintained above 30 μmol/l [24]
with apparently good metabolic control. Whatever the
dose, complete suppression of succinylacetone concentrations is essential. Obese patients require a lower dose
than that calculated from total body mass. For older
children and adults the dose may be calculated using
35 mg/M2
/day.
Additional tests (Molecular Genetics)
Molecular genetic studies may be needed for counselling, prenatal diagnosis and family screening. One splice
mutation is prevalent in French-Canadians [26] and
more than 40 mutations are now known [27,28].
Clinic appointments and monitoring
The patients should be monitored regularly. The frequency should take account of the age of the patient, the
severity of the illness, the family’s understanding and
compliance. It is suggested that in the first year the patient is seen every month (or even every week) until the
patient is stable and well controlled and the family
confident. Thereafter the intervals can be lengthened.

The tests that should be included in each visit are:
Blood/ plasma
Blood gases
Liver function tests: bilirubin, aspartate and alanine
aminotransferase (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase,
γglutamyl transpeptidase (γGT), albumin.
Coagulation: Prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin
time, fibrinogen,
Urea and electrolytes, creatinine, calcium, phosphate
Full blood count
Aminoacids (quantitative)
α-fetoprotein (AFP)
Succinylacetone (if available)
Albumin
Nitisinone (NTBC)
If the patient is in acute liver failure plasma glucose
and ammonia should be added.
Recently, a simple method allowing the simultaneous
determination of NTBC, succinylacetone, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine on a dried blood has been
developed with great practical advantages especially in
paediatric patients [29].
Urine
Glucose
Aminoacids
Tubular re-absorption of phosphate (TRP)
Calcium/creatinine ratio
Urine acidification (by the locally preferred method)
Albumin, Protein, β2-microglobulin
Organic acids and succinylacetone (note: A specific
assay for succinylacetone may necessary to detect very
low concentrations as routine organic acid assays may
not be sufficiently sensitive).
The following investigations should be done as with
any patient on a strict diet at intervals of every 6 months
to one year.
Iron and ferritin, vitamins A,D,E, Folate & vitamin B12,
Micronutrients (Se, Zn, Cu)
a-fetoprotein
The AFP should decline steadily and it should be close
to the target (normal) value of 10 ng/l by one year but
there is considerable variability so that some reach the
target earlier and a few later. A slow decrease, failure to
normalise or a slight rise should be regarded with suspicion [30] and prompt a careful review of the imaging.
The value of lectin reactive-AFP is unclear [31]. If there
is any doubt the patient should be referred for assessment by the liver transplant team.
Diet
The low tyrosine low phenylalanine diet must also be continued indefinitely and should be carefully supervised. The
target plasma concentrations of tyrosine and phenylalanine are unclear and long term follow-up studies are urgently needed. The increase in plasma concentrations are
associated with increased CSF concentrations of tyrosine
[32]. The effects on the tryptophan-derived neurotransmitters [29] is unknown. As a guide the aim should be to
keep tyrosine concentrations between 200 – 400 μmol/l
up to the age of about 12 years. This is not easy and some
centres allow plasma tyrosine concentrations up to
500 μmol/l. After the age of 12 years it is common to
allow the plasma tyrosine concentrations to rise modestly
but the safety of this is not known and it needs to be kept
under careful review. As it is difficult to measure the
plasma aminoacids fasting they should be measured under
the same conditions each time. To maintain these concentrations of tyrosine, a diet similar to that used in phenylketonuria but without tyrosine supplements is necessary.
The quantity of natural protein will be restricted and given
as exchanges. A phenylalanine and tyrosine free aminoacid
supplement is necessary. Low phenylalanine concentrations may be damaging. If the plasma phenylalanine
concentrations are persistently very low, some clinicians
prescribe phenylalanine supplements but plasma phenylalanine concentrations show a marked diurnal variation
[33,34] and the precise timing of any supplements is
unclear. Such phenylalanine supplements may increase
plasma tyrosine concentrations. The diet should be monitored as any strict low protein diet.
Whilst the eye complications are rare with tyrosine
concentrations below 800 μmol/l (see below) there is increasing concern about the cognitive outcome. Many
patients on nitisinone have learning difficulties [35] and it
is widely thought that this is associated with the increased
tyrosine concentrations. Strict control of plasma tyrosine
concentrations is to be encouraged. However a stricter
diet is not easy and the evidence that stricter control of
plasma tyrosine concentrations improves the outcome is
not conclusive [36,37]. The relevance of the concentrations of other large neutral aminoacids, notably tryptophan, is uncertain [32].
Imaging
The risk of developing HCC is not easily assessed but
the later the diagnosis is made the greater the risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma (see Table 18.1 in reference 1).
Constant vigilance is needed in all patients. Hepatic
imaging therefore must be done regularly at least every
six months, particularly in the late diagnosed patients.
If the liver is uniform ultrasound may be done every
6 months with MRI (or CT if no alternative) every year.
However if there are any changes MRI (or CT if no
de Laet et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:8 Page 6 of 9
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/8

alternative) should be done without delay. Occasionally
nodules are present before nitisinone treatment but regress on repeated imaging following treatment [38]. It
may be permissible to do an MRI (or CT if no alternative) every two years in patients detected by newborn
screening, started on treatment early and who are stable.
If there are nodules cross sectional imaging (by MRI (or
CT if no alternative)) should be done every 3–6 months.
It is difficult to assess the potential risk of malignancy in
liver nodules so that if a nodule has any characteristics
suggestive of HCC or if it persists on repeat imaging
(within 3–6 months) in a child with a good metabolic
response to treatment, the patient should be discussed
with a liver transplantation team.
Imaging should also be done without delay if there is
any rise or failure of the expected fall in AFP. Any changes
need to be reviewed carefully. If there is a sudden change
in a nodule, the development of a new nodule or a nodule
is larger than 10 mm in diameter, HCC is likely and the
patient should be referred for assessment for liver transplantation. Liver biopsy should be avoided because of the
risk of seeding metastases.
Renal imaging: The kidneys should be imaged using
ultrasound when the liver is imaged in order to monitor
kidney growth and changes in renal parenchyma.
Psychometric assessment
Psychometric evaluation is important but is of little predictive value before 4 years of age. The facilities for psychometric evaluation are generally in short supply. For
most units realistically the first assessment should be
before school entry and at intervals thereafter according
to the apparent progress and the resources available.
Neuropsychological studies may be more helpful that
standard IQ tests. School reports can be useful to supplement the assessment.
Eye examination
Eye complications do not appear to be common [16,39]
but periodic eye examination with a slit lamp may be
indicated (for example annually). There does not appear
to be a clear cut-off of plasma tyrosine concentrations
either in man or experimental animals [39,40]. It is not
clear whether it is necessary in the asymptomatic child.
One approach to minimise clinic appointments is to arrange for an initial eye examination looking for anomalies
and then only refer if the child develops symptoms (or if
compliance is not good with high plasma tyrosine
concentrations).
Bone mineral density
Bone mineral density should be checked as with any patient on a strict diet. It is particularly important in those
with any severe or persisting renal tubular disease.
Long term management and compliance
Nitisinone and the diet must be continued indefinitely
but some families will need intensive support to maintain the treatment.
The role of liver transplantation
Although the quality of life after a successful liver transplant is usually good, there are serious risks including
those of the surgery and lifelong immunosuppression.
The indications for liver transplantation include acute
liver failure and malignancy. Young babies may need
emergency liver transplantation if they fail to respond to
nitisinone. If the recommended medical treatment with
nitisinone is not adhered to or is not available, the patient is at risk for acute and chronic complications of
HT1. They may be considered for liver transplantation
according to the classical criteria established before the
availability of nitisinone.
If the diagnosis of HCC without extrahepatic disease is
proven or the diagnosis of HCC is suspected because of
radiological or serological investigations, the patient should
be evaluated by a liver transplantation team urgently.
Pregnancy
The safety of nitisinone in the treatment in pregnancy,
and of the accompanying fetal and maternal hypertyrosinaemia, has not been firmly established. However, three
patients on nitisinone have had babies who were normal
on examination in the newborn period [41,42], unpublished case report. Early follow-up was also normal.
In affected babies SA is detectable in amniotic fluid in
pregnancy and both SA and AFP are raised in cord
blood [15]. This suggests that the tyrosine degradation
pathway is active in utero. In one pregnancy both
mother and baby had HT1, the nitisinone not only
crossed the placenta freely but suppressed the disease in
the fetus [42]. If NTBC is proved to be completely safe
it might be given to the mother to prevent damage in
utero. This approach should be regarded as experimental
and subject to a research protocol.
Management of siblings at risk
HT1 is an autosomal recessive disorder so that there is a
1 in 4 risk of the next sibling being affected. HT1 is a severe disease and prenatal diagnosis is feasible. Although
nitisinone has revolutionized the management of the
disease, the long-term outcome of the patient remains
uncertain. The ethical issues are complex and contentious but it is one widely held view is that termination of
the pregnancy can be justified. However the prevailing
public and family views and the laws vary widely
in countries that may use these recommendations.
Detailed discussions between the professionals and
the family are essential.
de Laet et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:8 Page 7 of 9
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/8

The test is best done by mutation analysis if the genotype of the index case is known. The measurement of
succinylacetone concentrations in amniotic fluid is reliable but occasional problems have been reported [43].
Where the mutation is not known, a combined strategy
has been suggested [1].
If a baby is known to be at risk but has not had a prenatal diagnosis, cord blood [13] or urine (collected at
around 6–12 hours of age) should be sent for urgent
analysis of succinylacetone.
Conclusions
With the introduction of nitisinone the prognosis for those
with HT1 has improved greatly. However because newborn screening is only available in a few countries most
patients still present clinically. Early treatment with nitisinone and strict diet is essential. Careful long term monitoring and management is required. Prospective, controlled
treatment studies are needed to develop evidence-based
guidelines for the future management of HT1.
Endnote (Disclaimer)
The recommendations have been scrutinised carefully
but there may still be errors. Furthermore new evidence
at any time can invalidate them. No liability whatsoever
can be taken as a result of using this information. These
recommendations are applicable to most patients but
there will be occasions when alternative management is
more appropriate. If there is any uncertainty or doubt
about the management, the patient should be referred a
specialist for a further opinion.
