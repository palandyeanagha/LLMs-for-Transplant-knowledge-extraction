Long term outcomes after liver transplantation are major determinants of quality of life and of the value of this heroic 
treatment. As short term outcomes are excellent, our community is turning to take a harder look at long term outcomes. 
The purpose of this paper is to review these outcomes, and highlight proposed treatments, as well as pressing topics 
needing to be studied. A systemic review of the English literature was carried in PubMed, covering all papers addressing long term outcomes in pediatric liver transplant from 2000-2013. Late outcomes after pediatric liver transplant 
affect the liver graft in the form of chronic liver dysfunction. The causes include rejection particularly humoral rejection, 
but also de novo autoimmune hepatitis, and recurrent disease. The metabolic syndrome is a major factor in long 
term cardiovascular complication risk. Secondary infections, kidney dysfunction and malignancy remain a reality 
of those patients. There is growing evidence of late cognitive and executive function delays affecting daily life productivity as well as likely adherence. Finally, despite a good health status, quality of life measures are comparable 
to those of children with chronic diseases. Long term outcomes are the new frontier in pediatric liver transplantation. 
Much is needed to improve graft survival, but also to avoid systemic morbidities from long term immunosuppression. 
Quality of life is a new inclusive measure that will require interventions and innovative approaches respectful not 
only on the patients but also of their social circle.

INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation is now a well-established 
treatment for end stage liver disorders in pediatrics. 
Over the last decade advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppressive therapies and infectious 
monitoring and treatment have revolutionized patient and graft survival. Short term complications 
are at all times low, and 1 year survival is solidly 
above 95% across all pediatric cholestatic disorders. 
A correlate of this success is that long term complications are becoming more apparent as patient survival is now reaching over 20 years. 
Long term complications likely for some originate 
in the early post-transplant period, but others reflect 
long term and cumulative side effects of immunosuppressive medications as well as compliance 
hurdles. All are in addition affected by the individual

genetic and general health background.
When Ng et al. [1] looked in the studies in pediatric liver transplant (SPLIT) registry at the health 
status of children alive 10 years after liver transplant, 
of 167 survivors, only 32% achieved an “ideal profile” 
as defined by first allograft, stable on mono therapy, 
normal growth and absence of common immunosuppression-induced sequelae. Impaired growth 
was seen in 23%, renal dysfunction in 9%, post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) in 5%, and 
patients had a lower health-related quality of life 
score than matched healthy children. 
These outcomes defer slightly from those reported 
from other areas in the world, but the general themes 
are constant. An excellent review of long term outcomes was included in the recently published 
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 
guidelines for the management [2].
In this review we will briefly go over common 
outcomes. We will detail some of the novelty and 
controversy areas. We will also review emerging topics of interest.
GRAFT HEALTH
Liver graft health is clearly affected by the integrity 
of its vascular and biliary systems, as well as by the 
immunologic responses along the spectrum of its life 
affecting parenchymal, but also vascular and biliary 
structures. Improving surgical techniques and operative support, as well as treatment modalities have 
helped improve dramatically those outcomes.
Vascular complications
While they reach up to 10% in some series in the 
first 90 days, de novo late onset hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), or portal vein (PV) or hepatic vein (HV) 
stenosis/thrombosis are growing in recognition. 
They are often found on monitoring US or with manifestation of related morbidities. The onset of these 
vascular complications is likely still to have been in 
the early post-operative time, but chronic immunologic and ischemic insults are also at play. The long 
term effect on the graft can result in progressive scarring and/or bile duct disease, leading to morbidities 
and in rare cases to a need for re-transplantation. In 
addition pro-thrombotic disorders need often to be 
rule out as part of their work up. 
Hepatic artery thrombosis & hepatic artery 
stenosis 
Early HAT occurs in around 8.3% of transplanted 
children and is more common in lower volume centers (performing less than 13 transplants a year). 
Risk factors include: less than 6 month old donor livers, small recipient vessels, whole liver graft, right 
split liver graft, need for arterial graft, prolonged cold 
ischemia time, and recipient massive ascites and hyper-coagulable state. The use of interrupted and fine 
sutures for arterial anastomosis, loupe or microscope, and attention to organ harvesting improved 
outcomes through the decades to a current 3.8% incidence in large transplant centers (inclusive of adult 
and pediatric transplants). Mortality in the case of 
early HAT can range from 30-40%, and is due to infections, severe bile ducts injury, and graft dysfunction. Treatment with heparin or aspirin, and the use 
of micro-vascular surgeries do not show clear preventive advantage in published literature. Thrombectomy, surgical revision of the arterial anastomosis, and thrombolysis are the prevalent treatment 
modalities. Children tend to do better than adults 
with a 92% good outcome if diagnosis and treatment 
are done early. Re-transplantation was performed in 
62% of children [3].
Late HAT is rarer, as most cases arise in the first 
month post-transplant. It is often felt to represent 
more of a late recognition than late onset. The liver 
function is usually fairly preserved due to the presence of extensive collateralization, assured usually in 
pediatric recipients by the roux, the cut surface of the 
liver and the liver capsule. Non-specific transaminase elevations, de-novo biliary complications, 
and a finding of parvus tardus could point towards 
late HAT. Bile ducts complications are the defining 
morbidities. They typically consist of non-anastomotic strictures, often in the hilum and complex in 
nature. Bilomas and biliary sepsis are common.

Re-vascularization usually does not work. Re-transplantation is the better treatment when complications arise, but is very hard, fraud with substantial 
comorbidities and financially forbidding. 
If hepatic artery stenosis is diagnosed, it is always 
worth treating conservatively usually with dilatation, but long and recurrent interventions are 
needed. It remains a high risk situation for long term 
graft dysfunction and biliary complications. 
Portal vein thrombosis
PV thrombosis is estimated at 2-10% in all pediatric 
recipients. While often silent in early post transplant 
time, portal hypertensive clinical findings and hypersplenism are usually seen as time elapses. Portal hypertensive complications manifest mostly as hypersplenism, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. GI 
bleeding is often clinically significant, sometimes requires surgical shunting and more rarely retransplantation. Currently scarce systematic data is 
available on those patients’ outcomes, the timing and 
appropriate vascular shunt type to use; a REX shunt 
(mesenterico-left portal bypass) is favored when 
technically feasible [4].
Hepatic vein/outflow stenosis 
Late outflow obstruction is the least prevalent of 
vascular complications and is more commonly seen 
in the technical variant graft (less than 1% in most 
reports). It presents as a Budd-Chiari syndrome. 
Diagnosis is made by US, computed tomography 
(CT) angiography or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI). It is confirmed by direct venography that can 
also serve as first line treatment. Often those livers 
do end up failing with time unless corrective surgery 
can be done. Thrombotic tendencies need to be ruled 
out in such patients if technical issues are not at play.
Biliary complications
Bile ducts (BD) complications can arise at any 
time in the life of a graft. They average 5-25% incidence in pediatric liver graft recipients. Late biliary 
strictures are more frequent in anatomic variant liver 
grafts. The mean time to diagnosis is around 2 
months from transpant. 
Biliary complications are to suspect when cholestatic biochemical changes or cholangitis are present. 
The bilirubin level is often normal, and rarely 
anomalies are seen on US. Imaging the liver graft 
with CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography can be helpful in diagnosing dilated ducts 
in some patients. In the absence of radiologic findings, if the suspicion is high, a liver biopsy can document cholangitis and obstructive findings. Endoscopic or percutaneous cholangiography is often needed 
to confirm or rule out the diagnosis, and also serves 
as the most common treatment modality.
Bile duct stenosis tends mostly to be ischemic in 
origin. Anastomotic strictures are usually short and 
respond nicely to dilation and stenting for 6-8 weeks. 
Non-anastomotic strictures are harder to manage, 
often result from HAT or ischemia-reperfusion 
injury. Some can also be due to primary immune 
injury. Rarely in pediatrics, casts and stones are seen, 
but cholangitis remains the most common manifestation along with progressive liver graft scarring. 
In adults, 30-50% with BD complications needs retransplantation. In pediatrics, surgical correction or 
re-transplantation are rarely needed, and no studies 
are available about their long tern outcomes. In a recent abstract describing their single center series, J. 
Seal for the Toronto’s group reported that 70% of 
their biliary complications resolved with endoscopic 
or interventional radiology interventions, but mortality and re-transplant rates were higher in patients 
with biliary complications than in ones without 
(SPLIT meeting 2013). 
Immune complications
Late acute rejection (LAR): Although its exact definition is not formalized, it is often referred to as acute 
cellular rejection over 3 months post-transplant. The 
incidence of LAR has not changed with current immunosuppression, and it should always raise the 
question of compliance problems. As opposed to early acute rejection, LAR seems to be associated with a 
higher incidence of chronic graft dysfunction and 
loss estimated to be at 50% in some series. It remains 

210 　　　Vol. 16, No. 4, December 2013
Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr
a not well defined and studied entity in pediatrics, 
and likely the new donor specific antibodies (DSA) 
and compliance data will shed more light on its immune mechanism and treatment potential.
Chronic rejection (CR): The incidence of CR has declined in most reported adult series from 20% to 
3-8%, likely reflecting improved immunosuppressive 
regimens. In the SPLIT database, CR as defined by 
ductopenic findings of graft dysfunction, remains at 
a less than 5% incidence. The highest risk factors for 
CR are transplantation for CR, immune-mediated 
primary liver diseases, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and low immunosuppression. In the early 
phases of chronic liver allograft rejection, there is 
usually no architectural distortion and the portal inflammation is mild. However, duct damage is usually severe and widespread, with or without bile duct 
loss. When present, duct loss involves over 50% of 
the portal tracts, inflammation concentrate around 
the small BD and more rarely around the central vein 
usually then with peri-venular hepatocyte dropout, 
cholestasis and/or hepatocyte ballooning. 
Often clinical and histological pictures are not 
clear cut and CMV and Ebstein Barr virus (EBV) 
co-infections are often reported in pediatrics, raising 
the possibility of a causative relationship. Recurrent 
immune disease (auto-immune hepatitis [AIH], primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC]) can also cloud 
the diagnosis and can independently lead to graft 
failure. Finally, the role of humoral immunity as a 
cause or complication of CR is gaining momentum. 
No codified treatment is currently available for CR. 
The introduction of tacolimus-based immunosuppression decreased CR’s incidence. Newer immunomodulatory agents, inclusive of some that better target the humoral and naïve immune systems, 
seem to help select patients. Timing of such therapies and the compliance profile, likely play a major 
role in their effectiveness.
Humoral rejection: Pre-formed and particularly de 
novo donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) specific 
antibodies (DSA), while having not much effect on 
the incidence of early acute rejection, have now been 
shown in multiple retrospectively studies, to be associated with a higher incidence of chronic graft dysfunction, CR and graft loss. Emerging prospective 
data is building up, and helps to better interpret and 
validate those findings, as well as establishes their 
clinical relevance in the context of modern immunosuppressive regimens. New data is also now 
emerging on the possible role of non-HLA 
antibodies. Pediatric data remains at best scarce.
HLA immunity: Most of the literature on HLA immunity comes from the adult patients. Mazariegos, 
in a report on attempted immunosuppression withdrawal, found that: patients with negative DSA could 
be easily weaned off immunosuppression; most patients who failed weaning off immunosuppression 
were DSA positive [5]. De novo DSA was identified as 
an independent risk factor for late graft dysfunction 
and decreased patient and graft survival at 1 year [6]. 
Evans et al. [7] found a graft survival rate of 68% at 1 
year, 45% at 5 years, 31% 10 years with the only predictor of graft loss being DSA positivity. Ekong et al. 
[8] and Scheenstra et al. [9] reported on the high incidence of liver fibrosis on protocol biopsies, associated with high de novo DSA.
While more reports are coming detailing the association of graft dysfunction with DSAs, we still in 
large do not know more details about their significance, how graft injury happens in their presence, nor how and when to treat them. This is promising to be one of the hottest topics in liver transplantation this coming decade. As adult studies a 
fine tuning the incidence and relevance of anti-HLA 
antibodies, retrospective and prospective studies are 
needed in pediatrics.
De novo auto-immune hepatitis: De novo AIH was 
first reported in pediatric liver recipients and remains since more prevalent in the pediatric age 
group averaging 2.35-6.2% depending on the series 
[10]. McDiarmid reported a similar incidence from 
the University of California Los Angeles transplant 
group; 40% of their patients having isolated anti-nuclear antibody positivity of still unknown significance; patients with de novo AIH were more likely to have experienced rejection and to be still on steroids on long term follow up (AASLD post-graduate 

www.pghn.org　　　　211
 Nada A. Yazigi：Long Term Outcomes after Pediatric Liver Transplantation
course 2013). The presence of high antinuclear antibody titers (1 : 1,600) was highly associated with 
progressive graft fibrosis, and children again were 
more commonly affected than adults [11]. In the 
SPLIT data, de novo AIH patients are older, females’ 
predominance, more commonly diagnosed with LAR 
and/or cholestatic rejection, on higher immunosuppression, and more likely to belong to a minority 
ethnic group [12].
Aguilera et al. [13] showed that some patients with 
de novo AIH have circulating antibodies to glutathione S-transferase T1, that is present in the graft but 
not in the donor. Thus, if the graft-damaging immune 
response seen in de novo AIH is directed against graft 
rather than host antigens, then this would surely fit 
the criteria for rejection rather than autoimmune 
disease. The question of autoimmune, versus allo-immune disorder remains therefore unclear as non-liver 
directed auto-immune phenomena are also seen 
more commonly in some of those patients, namely 
immune cytopenias and hypothyroidism.
De novo post-transplant AIH responds to classical 
AIH treatment with steroids and purine analogues 
per most series. Earlier reports had worse outcomes, 
possibly due to base immunosuppression and late diagnosis, confusing this entity with rejection [10]. 
For cases where the classical treatment is not possible, Gibelli et al. [14] reports are promising.
RECURRENT DISEASE
Recurrent disease is understandably more frequently reported when protocol biopsies are done. As 
disease phenotypes are changing with the availability of new medications, particularly in viral hepatitis, the data remains in flux, but continuously 
improving.
Infectious
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus infections are rare indications for liver transplantation 
in pediatric age patients in the western hemisphere. 
Current preventive measures for recurrent disease 
mirror those in adult experience, and newer antivirals are likely to revolutionizing this field.
Immune liver disease
Recurrent AIH in kids is estimated to be up to 33% 
in pediatrics, with up to.
Recurrent AIH ranges form 12-46% depending on 
the immunosuppression used. While its mean time 
to recurrence is 4.6 years it can be as early as a month 
post transplant. The diagnosis relies on the typical 
histologic appearance and positive auto-antibodies. 
Successful treatment relies on early diagnosis and 
consists mostly of re-introducing steroids and azathioprin [10]. Death rate in that subgroup of patients 
is high and approaches 10-11%.
Transplant for PSC remains rare in pediatrics, and 
data on recurrence is not available. In adults, while 
recurrent PSC seems to be frequent, it rarely leads to 
graft lost, but is a diagnostic challenge as has common pathologic and imaging features as CR.
Steatohepatitis
Sutedja et al. [15] examined the post-transplant 
histology of 39 patients transplanted for cryptogenic 
cirrhosis who survived for longer than 1 year. 
Steatosis and steatohepatitis were present in 37.6% 
of patients (vs. 16.7% in control); 18.8% had moderate steatosis at 1year, and half progressed to cirrhosis 
at 4 years. 
Pediatric data is currently unavailable in this select group of patients. As the obesity epidemic is 
spreading across borders and age groups, this is likely to become a prime topic of study and focus in the 
future as more adolescents are meeting criteria for 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis advanced liver disease. 
Clearly this remains a major opportunity for prevention, and liver transplant should be reserved as a 
last treatment option. 
Cancer
More pediatric patients are going through transplantation for hepatoblastoma and other pediatric 
liver tumors than in the past. This field was revolutionized by a multi-disciplinary approach to these 
complex patients resulting in fine tuning of peri- and 

212 　　　Vol. 16, No. 4, December 2013
Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr
post- transplant chemotherapy and medical support, 
and in a better and evolving understanding of the 
distinct biological behavior of these tumors in pediatric hosts. Long term outcomes for primary transplants are excellent for both patient and graft 
survival. Caution remains for possible primary tumor 
recurrence. 
KIDNEYS, METABOLIC SYNDROME, 
AND CARDIO-VASCULAR HEALTH 
Renal dysfunction is reported at ∼30% in a cross 
sectional study of SPLIT [16], and the Birmingham’s 
group reported a 15% incidence in their ＞15 years 
survivors, likely reflecting different immunosuppressive regimens (AASLD post-graduate course 
2013). In addition, it is accepted that albuminuria 
and decreased GFR independently increase cardiovascular risk. As a result of this data, much effort 
has been put the last decade to decrease and palliate 
the risk of kidney injury both short and long term, 
with the use of less nephrotoxic agents, induction 
regimens allowing minimization of calcineurin inhibitors exposure, treating hypertension and glomerular hyper-filtration in order to avoid early glomerulosclerosis, and closely monitoring kidney health 
with implementation of nephron-sparing immunosuppression regimens. Future populations outcomes will judge of the success of these preventive 
and treatment strategies that seem to be having already great effects on short term kidney outcomes.
The incidence of diabetes is around 10% in pediatric recipients, and is more common in older patients 
and those with cystic fibrosis. Underlying kidney 
dysfunction seems in addition to predispose to insulin resistance in most patients, and is revealed often at times of stress or steroids exposure [17]. In a 
cross sectional data from the SPLIT registry [1-18], 
obesity was seen in 12% of 461 five year survivors, 
and hyperlipidemia in 7%. Hyperlipidemia from the 
same group was at 23% in ＞10 years survivors, and 
hypertension was at 20%. 
Diabetes, hyperlipidemia and obesity form the basis of the metabolic syndrome; it was shown to be an 
independent predictor of poor outcomes in heart 
transplant recipients. In a meta-analysis of liver 
transplant recipients, Madhwal et al. [19] found that 
the cardiovascular risk is increased by 64%. The 
Toronto group shared an abstract at the 2013 SPLIT 
meeting where they found a 20% incidence of metabolic syndrome in their liver recipients, much higher 
than the median predicted prevalence of 3.3% in the 
general population, raising of course concerns about 
significant cardiovascular risk in the future of those 
pediatric aged recipients.
Prevention remains the cornerstone of the metabolic syndrome treatment. It includes minimizing 
steroids exposure, encouraging healthier eating habits, and optimizing physical activity. Looking forward, at least in this arena, the pediatric community 
has made big thrives. But the obesity epidemic is still 
reaching our patients, and poses another level of 
challenge to our community of care.
PREVENTION
More attention is now given across programs to 
assure that accelerated and updated vaccines are given before transplantation, and to vaccinate patients 
after transplantation. The Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention vaccinations guidelines were recently updated, and serve as the guideline for our patients’ vaccination regimen [20].
Secondary cancer awareness and prevention is an 
integral part of post transplantation follow up. 
Dramatic decrease in PTLD incidence to less than 3% 
in the pediatric population is likely due to the vigilant EBV viremia monitoring by PCRs and minimization of immunosuppression when possible.
Skin and gynecologic cancer risks are to be emphasized and screened for, in particular in adolescents.
While mostly improved after transplant, nutrition 
and growth face now the hurdle of the obesity epidemic [1-18]. Vitamin D nutritional deficiency is 
commonly seen and tends to mirror its incidence in 
the general pediatric population, reflective of prevalent diet habits.
Sexual maturation and fertility are also noted to be 

www.pghn.org　　　　213
 Nada A. Yazigi：Long Term Outcomes after Pediatric Liver Transplantation
normal in pediatric liver recipients [21]. Pro-active 
family planning and contraception are encouraged 
to all transplant recipients. Special attention needs 
to be given to prevention of sexually transmitted diseases in adolescents.
Perhaps the single most important prevention 
move in pediatric liver transplantation over the past 
decade is a move away from the transplant center-centric care, to an effort to re-integrate the primary care pediatrician in the treating team, assuring 
a more comprehensive and anticipatory look at the 
general health of pediatric liver recipients.
CHRONIC FIBROSIS
The emergent reports on silent fibrosis in long 
term grafts is raising concerns about long term outcomes, in particular in an era of aggressive attempts 
at immunosuppression minimization. 
Desai and Neuberger [11] looked retrospectively 
at 667 annual protocol biopsies in 335 patients: despite normal liver biochemistry, 49.8% had abnormal 
histology; only 4.9% had normal histology suggesting poor correlation between liver tests and liver 
histology. However, in only a minority did the findings result in a change of treatment (usually amending the immunosuppression). 
Sebagh et al. [22] showed histologic abnormalities 
in 80% of 143 patients at 10 years follow up. In 52%, 
liver tests were normal, suggesting protocol biopsies 
were justified annually.
Diagnosis of liver graft fibrosis still requires a liver 
biopsy. The platelet count can be useful as a secondary marker. The aspartate aminotransferase to 
Platelets Ration Index (APRI) score has a good predictive value for cirrhosis in HCV hepatitis but not for 
earlier stages of fibrosis. Along with serum markers 
of collagen (European liver fibrosis and fibro test), 
and MRI elastography, these tests still need validation in a transplanted graft, but could prove to be 
useful as non-invasive screens in the future. 
Patients transplanted for acute liver failure of indeterminate origin seem to be at higher risk for progressive graft fibrosis than the control group. This 
finding still needs to be validated in pediatrics, but 
can prove to be particularly relevant in pediatric age 
recipients where indeterminate acute liver failure 
(ALF) predominates in the patients requiring 
transplantation. 
The actual cause of progressive liver graft fibrosis 
remains unclear, and therefore no treatment can be 
specifically recommended. Further, of concern is a reported 15% rate of progression to cirrhosis documented over time in some patients [7]. In this single 
center report on 117 survivors over 15 years, fibrosis 
was diagnosed in 33% of patients with graft 
dysfunction. Interestingly, maintenance steroids 
seemed to have a protective effect, raising the possibility of an immune cause underlying the fibrosis. 
This is further enforced by experienced improvement 
in fibrosis found in trials of immunosuppressive 
withdrawal or minimization, once tacrolimus goal 
levels were raised.
FOCAL NODULAR HYPERPLASIA
Reports of focal nodular hyperplasia are increasing. They are particularly found in patients with prolonged vascular occlusions, and in those with exposure to chemotherapy. Close follow up for possible 
portal hypertensive complications is warranted in 
those patients. In addition, specific imaging techniques and agents are sometimes required for diagnosis. 
No primary treatment is available.
RE-TRANSPLANTATION 
Liver graft survival is currently at 80% at 5 years 
and 60% at 10 years, resulting in a 1/2 life of a liver of 
roughly 13 years. 
Improved surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimen clearly improved graft health, 
but little dent was placed in long term graft outcomes that are likely due to humoral-based immune 
responses, compliance issues and higher risk 
recipients. For those patients, re-transplantation remains a viable option when possible.
Re-transplantation incidence decreased from 20% 

214 　　　Vol. 16, No. 4, December 2013
Pediatr Gastroenterol Hepatol Nutr
to 10 % over the years, but is seeing a more recent increase again likely reflecting the adoption of new 
surgical techniques for transplantation, but also an 
increased number of pediatric transplant recipients 
going through adolescence and early adulthood with 
significant compliance problems.
Survival after re-transplant varies with timing of 
re-transplant. The Scientific Registry of Transplant 
Recipients data shows a survival of 61% in re-transplants vs. 85% after first liver transplant. In a single 
center study, Heffron et al. [23] found comparable 3 
year survival rates between those groups. 
In a seminal paper reviewing pediatric data from 
the SPLIT registry, Ng et al. [18] in 2008 identified 
the following as risks for death after re-transplantation were: ＜1 year old, donor age increase and 
high international normalized ratio. In a single center data report, Lao et al. [24] added as death risk 
predictors: intensive care unit, small recipient, bilirubin＞19. 
Clearly more work is needed to prevent the need 
for re-transplantation, but also to improve the health 
of those candidates, and define the optimum timing 
for re-transplantation. Of course also, re-transplantation has to reconcile the realities of organ 
availability and financial hurdles, to optimize its value to the individual patient and society.
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
The most common causes of death after transplantation remain: malignancy, infection, graft failure, multi-organ failure, and cardio-vascular. They 
all seem to mostly peak in the second decade post 
transplantation. They are vastly associated with immunosuppressive medications side effects. So the 
goal of transplantation in this era is in large to decrease/eliminate the need for immunosuppression 
therapy in order to achieve a state that best balances 
graft and host health: functional tolerance.
Many immunosuppressive withdrawal and minimization trials are on the way. Major work is carried 
also to define tolerance footprints, so to be able to 
monitor those patients.
The Pittsburgh group reported failure of withdrawal in patients who were younger than 50 years 
and less than 5 years post-transplant; they found that 
no rejection in the first post-transplant year seems to 
be a good marker for success (Oral Presentation 
SPLIT meeting, Sep 2013). Feng et al. [25] achieved a 
1 year functional tolerance in a highly selected group 
of pediatric recipient of living related liver. Slow 
withdrawal of immunosuppression was carried only 
in patients with normal histology, and who were at 
least 1 year out of transplantation and with no history 
of rejection in the preceding year. Ongoing monitoring of this successful group is pending, and includes 
blood immune parameters and liver biopsies.
Liver genes microarrays seem to be more reliable 
than serum, in predicting tolerance, and Bohne et al. 
[26] found that mostly iron metabolism gene panels 
distinguish tolerant from non-tolerant patients. 
The withdrawal studies have also shed a light on 
the presence of sub-clinical inflammation and fibrosis in a subset of patients with normal liver biochemical profiles, prompting the proposal of protocol 
liver biopsies to better define and understand this 
problem. Importantly, the very concept of whether 
withdrawal improves long term outcomes remains 
debated: while Tryphonopoulos et al.’s data [27] 
supports a benefit, the Immune Tolerance Network 
data so far shows none. 
Therefore, much needed to advance this field are 
retrospective disease-specific data and immunosuppressive protocols to pave the ground for prospective 
work, and the development and validation of immune 
testing to help guide and tailor therapy. One fact is 
clear: while we still know little, there is an enormous 
interest in learning more and from patients to 
participate. In the meantime, messages of caution for 
patients enrolled in those trials come from 
Abdelmalek et al. [28] about long term morbidities.
Despite the fact that this seminal and important 
work remains too young to be translated in clinical 
practice, it is clearly promising of a different future 
for immunosuppressive regimens and monitoring.

organ in his own rights, might very well be the best 
organ to allow this goal to come true.
PEDIATRIC LIVER DISORDERS IN ADULTS
A particular challenge emerging from successful 
pediatric liver transplantation is the survival of patients with disorders that never in the past made it 
past early childhood. Many of those are actually systemic disorders, and their phenotype is maturing as 
children are surviving into the second decades post 
transplantation. Being on the lookout for known and 
suspected outcomes, but also keeping a pro-active 
approach for unknown ones is crucial to optimize our 
patients’ long term outcomes and health. Eventually 
also, updating our adult transplant hepatology peers 
about such disorders is crucial to help with a successful transition to adulthood.
While patients with biliary atresia, still constituting the majority of pediatric transplant indications, 
have a liver focused problem, this defers for others:
alpha one anti-trypsin, tyrosinemia and other metabolic patients can have primary kidney problems and 
some have increased immune problems.
Alagille’s patients are at risk for kidney disease, 
primary renal artery stenosis, primary bone disease, 
pancreatic insufficiency, progressing pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, progressive retinopathy and vascular anomalies putting 
them at risk among others for strokes and bleeding.
Cystic fibrosis patients remain at risk for progressing lung disease, severe infection, pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatic and colon cancers.
AIH and PSC patients are at risk for recurrent disease, but also for increased auto-immune disorders 
affecting other organs, typical of such disorders presenting in the pediatric age. Ongoing monitoring 
and screening is recommended for those patients.
It became clear that transplant for progressive 
familial intra-hepatic cholestasis (PFIC 2), while curative for the disease, does trigger a unique form of 
humoral rejection targeted to the new protein made 
by the graft.
Children transplanted for liver tumors (particularly 
if hepatoblastoma) require monitoring for secondary 
tumors due to innate or chemotherapy induced risk.
Finally, neonatal liver failure requiring transplantation exemplifies the “SPLIT black box”, as the 
vast majority of those patients have no clearly indentified cause for their liver failure. Close monitoring for metabolic and immune anomalies are particularly needed in such recipients.
TRANSITION OF CARE AND ADHERENCE
Perhaps one of the most challenging outcome post 
pediatric liver transplantation is that of achieving a 
successful transition into adult care. 
Berquist et al. [29] documented a risk of non- adherence up to 50 % of their single center adolescents. 
Of the 37 non-compliant patients, 6 needed re-transplantation during the study period and 3 died. 
Shemesh et al. [30,31] reported the strong incidence 
of post trauma stress disorder (PTSD) in non-adherent SPLIT recipients, and the psychological hurdles to 
successful transition to adult care in those patients. 
Diagnosing non-adherence has proven hard till a 
problem happens. Tacrolimus standard deviation 
seems to be a helpful marker for non-compliance 
[32]. Diagnosis factors that increase non-adherence 
risk like health literacy, PTSD, depression, psychosocial and economic hurdles are crucial to identify and 
treat. Of course all these factors are a moving target 
and reassessment, as well as specific interventions 
and treatment tools need to be readily available. Such 
an intervention can only be made in a structured 
multidisciplinary clinic and requires extensive staffing and economic resources.
These adherence factors ironically are the same 
that can lead to a successful state of health sufficiency that can assure a successful transition to adult 
care [33]. The preparative work for transition needs 
to start many years before its due time, and should 
involve both patient and family. Dedicated multidisciplinary transition clinics have proven so far to be 
the best forum for a successful and safe transition to 
adult care. Successful transition implementation includesz early involvement of the adult transplant

hepatologist, follow up after transition with the pediatric team to review the process including the risk 
of not taking medications, simplifying medication 
regimen, counseling and support groups, and preferably an involved primary care physician.
While work continues to consolidate and implement these principles in most pediatric transplant 
programs, there is a need for a specific multi-center 
data base to capture those young adults transitioning 
care to better track their outcomes and challenges.
QUALITY OF LIFE 
Quality of life (QOL) matters. Liver transplant has 
proven to be a life-saving operation. We now have 
the luxury to explore QOL as an ultimate goal. 
In and analysis of the United Network for Organ 
Sharing database Huda et al. [34] found that only 1/4 
of adult recipients are employed. This is in contrast to 
recent pediatric data from Birmingham showing 
that the majority of their pediatric recipients are in 
school or working, drawing some attention to geographic and societal as well as age differences.
Burra et al. [35] looked at adherence post liver 
transplant in both adults and children in a center cohort: non-adherence to drugs was 15-40%, and to 
clinic appointments 3-47%. In addition non-adherence in pediatrics was 4 times higher than in adults. 
Risk factors in adults were high cost, psych disorders 
and side effects, conviction that medications are 
harmful. Risk factors in pediatrics were psychological distress, family functional status, and impact 
of medications on their physical appearance. 
Limbers et al. [36] looked at health related quality 
of life (HRQOL) in pediatric transplant recipients 
compared to other chronic disease groups. He found 
a similar HRQOL to children s/p renal transplant and 
cancer treatment in remission, better HRQOL than 
kids on dialysis except for school functioning, worse 
HRQOL than kids with type 1 diabetes except for 
emotional functioning. The study concluded that liver transplant recipients manifest impaired HRQOL 
and face ongoing challenges that warrant monitoring and indicate a need for interventions to improve 
their HRQOL. 
Mohammad et al. [37] looked at health status in 
young adults 2 decades after SPLIT (1988-1992): 
85/171 patients were alive, 56 were contacted, with a 
response rate of 66%. Of those who answered, 62% 
attended college, and 80% of those older than 23 
years were employed. Patients had lower HRQOL 
than non-liver transplant age matched controls. 
Patients’ health utilities were lower than normal and 
correlated with unemployment and hospitalizations. 
The authors concluded that physical and psychological sequelae continue to affect health status up to 
2 decades post liver transplant.
Sorensen et al. [38] examined cognitive and academic outcomes after SPLIT. In 144 kids over 2 years 
post liver transplant enrolled in the SPLIT study 
group: 26% (vs. 14 expected) had mild to moderate 
intelligence quotient (IQ) delays (in 71-85 range), 
4% (vs. 2% expected) had serious IQ delay (＜70), 
reading and math score were weaker than IQ in 25% 
(vs. 7%) suggesting learning disabilities, executive 
deficits were also noted.
Based on the available data we clearly have ways 
to go to improve ultimate QOL and function of SPLIT 
survivors. Improving medical and general health 
outcomes will obviously help achieve this goal. 
Disease-specific HRQOL instruments will likely help 
map the road for us. Identifying and palliating to the 
cognitive, and socioeconomic hurdles remain crucial 
interventions and hold true across societies and systems of health care delivery. 
CONCLUSION
While there is still a lot to conquer in transplantaion in scientific and medical knowledge, the 
real pressing cornerstones of care are: better management of our current treatment tools to avoid and 
treat toxicity, and adressing psycho-social and economic hurdles that affect every aspect of long term 
outcomes, through poor compliance and/or poor access to care.
Long term outcomes after pediatric liver transplantation are the true new frontier in this ev-

er-evolving field. They will no doubt improve as we as 
a community: 1) Accept the fact that liver transplantation is a chronic disease state, no matter how 
healthy and functional our recipient patients are–we 
should therefore be cognizant to use the Chronic Care 
Model of health care delivery along the Institute Of 
Medicine rules of redesign; 2) Adopt upfront a model 
of health care delivery along the Ohio State Project 4 
model: predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory; 3) Build a system around our patients that 
accommodate their state as a “vulnerable population” public health model, allowing us to address 
not only patient-based but social circle- and society-based issues relevant to their care (Fig. 1).
