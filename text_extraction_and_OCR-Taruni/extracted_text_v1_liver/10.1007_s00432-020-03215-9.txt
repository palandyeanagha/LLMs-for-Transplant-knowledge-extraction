Abstract
Background It has been shown that local ablative procedures enable downsizing, reduce drop-out from the waiting list and 
improve prognosis after liver transplantation. It is still unclear whether a response to the local ablative therapy is due to 
a favorable tumor biology or if a real beneft in tumor stabilization exists, particularly in complete pathological response.
Method Data of 163 HCC patients who underwent liver transplantation were extracted from our prospectively maintained 
registry. We analyzed the tumor load, pre-transplant α-fetoprotein levels, child stage aside the application and success of 
local ablative therapies as bridging procedures before transplantation.
Results 87 patients received multiple and/or combined local therapies. In 20 cases, this resulted in a complete remission 
of the tumor as observed in the explant histology. The other 76 patients underwent no bridging procedure. The observed 
5- and 10-year survival rates for patients with bridging were 67% and 47% and without bridging 56% and 46%, respectively. 
Tumor-related 10-year survival showed a statistically signifcant diference between both groups (81% versus 59%). In the 
multivariate analyses bridging, number of lesions and α-fetoprotein level showed an independent statistically signifcant 
infuence on tumor-related survival in these patients.
Conclusions Successful local ablative therapy before liver transplantation is an independent statistically signifcant factor 
in long-term tumor-related survival for patients with HCC in cirrhosis and reduces tumor recurrences.

Introduction
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radio frequency 
ablation (RFA), radioembolization (RE), percutaneous alcohol injection (PEI), microwave ablation, irreversible electroporation and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) 
in combination with thyrosinkinase inhibitor are being 
employed for local ablative treatment prior to liver transplantation (LT) in selected patients [1–7]. TACE is the most 
frequently employed bridging procedure. The role of bridging therapy was frst reported by Manjo et al. in a study of 
the Hospital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France [8]. The procedures are often combined and/or repeated for increased efciency [9]. It has been shown that local ablative procedures 
enable downsizing, reduce drop-out from the waiting list and 
improve prognosis after liver transplantation [5, 10–14]. A 
statistically signifcant improvement of survival has been 
documented in a multi-center study of the European Liver 
Transplant Registry (Pommergard 2018). It is still unclear 
whether a response to the local ablative therapy is due to a 
favorable tumor biology or if a real beneft in tumor stabilization exists, particularly in complete pathological response.
Here, we present the efect of local ablative bridging procedures on the 10-year recurrence rate and the tumor-related 
10-year survival after liver transplantation for HCC in our 
patient population. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
frst long-term observation in this feld.

Materials and methods
From our prospectively maintained tumor register, we 
extracted data of HCC patients who underwent liver 
transplantation between 1996 and 2017. Patients who 
died within 3 months after LT and patients transplanted 
for recurrence of HCC after partial hepatectomy were 
excluded. All patients were followed-up until death or until 
August, 1st 2018. 163 patients were included in the study.
In cases of sufcient liver function bridging procedures, 
such as liver resection, local ablative procedures (transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radio frequency ablation 
(RFA), Yttrium90 radio embolization (Y90RE), tomotherapy, 
in combination with systemic therapy with thyrosinkinase 
inhibitor were employed since 2004. All these interventions 
were continued for as long as residual tumor was identifed and monitored radiologically in 90 days intervals. In 
cases of residual vital tumor, the procedures were repeated 
and combined. TACE was the most frequently applied local 
ablative therapy. In 87 patients (54%), TACE, RFA or Y90
radioembolisation was performed, some of them repeatedly. 
67, 13 and 7 cases, respectively, (77%, 15%, und 8%) were 
TACE, RFA or Y90 radioembolisation. 79 patients did not 
receive any bridging therapy (transplantation before 2004, or 
functionally unsuitable for local ablative procedures).
133 patients received a deceased donor liver. 30 patients 
received a split from a living donor (all of them received 
segments SV-VIII). The waiting time prior to living donation was median 6 months (range 0–20 months) and, thus 
statistically signifcantly shorter than prior to deceased 
donor transplantation (median 9 months, range 0–46). 
mTOR-based long-term immunosuppression was administered since 2010 in patients who had no contraindications.
Follow-up consultations after LT for HCC are standardized including follow-up for tumor status. As long as laboratory tests including AFP were within normal ranges, a 
CT scan was performed every 3 months for the frst 2 years 
and then annually. If tumor recurrence was confrmed, 
therapeutic options were discussed in the interdisciplinary hepatobiliary tumor board. We performed surgical 
resections with curative intent for intra- and extra-hepatic 
recurrence, applied local therapy (TACE, Y90RE, RFA) in 
non-resectable intra-hepatic recurrences and radiation for 
bone metastases. Whenever possible, a systemic therapy 
with thyrosinkinase inhibitors followed.
We analyzed the morphological data of the tumor load 
in pre-transplant contrast computed tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, α-fetoprotein 
(AFP) (ng/ml) level, stage of underlying liver disease 
(Child stage) and use of loco-regional therapy.
All patients gave their consent for clinical registration. 
We have only used data from the clinical data registry. The 
study in humans has been carried out with approval of the 
local ethics committee (Nr. 4337-02/15), in accordance 
with national law and the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 
(in the current revised form).
The statistical univariate analysis was performed with 
SPSS Software version 19. Diferences in the distribution 
of variables have been tested with Fisher’s exact test or with 
Chi square test for statistically signifcant diferences. Survival rates were calculated with the Kaplan–Meier procedure 
and signifcance testing was performed with the log-rank 
test. Starting point for survival was date of transplantation. 
End point for observed and tumor-related survival were 
death of any cause and death of hepatocellular carcinoma, 
respectively. Cox regression analysis was used for the multivariate analysis.
Results
Patient age at transplantation was median 61 years (range 
38–72 years). Morphological tumor load was „inside Milan“ 
in 70 (43%) patients and „outside Milan“ in 93 (57%) 
patients. Further data on patients and tumor load are being 
shown in Table 1. Child- and UICC stage were diferent 
in patients with and without bridging. Bridging resulted in 
complete remission (no evidence of vital tumor tissue in the 
explant specimen) in 20 cases. This was most frequently 
observed in single lesions (13/42=31% vs. 7/45=16%) and 
after RFA (5/10 vs. 15/77=20%), respectively.
Median follow-up time after LT was 55 months (range 
8–264). By now, 71 patients died, 34 of them of other causes 
and 37 (22%) of them from HCC recurrence. 5 patients died 
from malignant second tumor (lung cancer in 3, pancreatic 
cancer in one and urinary bladder cancer in one), and 29 
died from other causes.
Of the 92 living patients, 10 developed a second carcinoma after LT (3 each in the ENT area or on the skin, one 
each B-cell lymphoma, stomach GIST, small cell renal carcinoma or prostate cancer).
Observed 5- and 10-year survival rates were 62% and 
47%, respectively. Observed 5-year survival rate was higher 
with bridging than without (67% vs. 56%). The diference 
did not reach statistical signifcance, though. The respective 10-year survival rates were 47% and 46%, respectively. 
For tumor-related survival, there was a statistically signifcant diference in long-term survival (Fig. 1). In addition 
to bridging, tumor-related survival was statistically signifcantly related by the level of pre-operative α-fetoprotein levels, Milan and UICC classifcation (Table 2, Fig. 2).
Sex, patient age, type of bridging procedure, existing 
portal vein thrombosis and child stage had no statistically 
signifcant infuence on tumor-related 10-year survival in the 
univariate analysis.

The statistically signifcant infuence of bridging was 
maintained with stratifcation according to Milan classifcation (Fig. 2).
Of the 20 patients with complete pathological response 
after bridging, none has died from tumor recurrence so far. 
12/20 had been histologically confrmed pre-LT, the others 
were classifed as HCC from CT/MRT scans and AFP.
Bridging therapy, level of pre-operative α-fetoprotein and 
number of lesions showed an independent statistically signifcant impact on tumor-free survival in the multivariate 
analysis (Table 3).
Recurrence
46 patients (28%) developed a tumor recurrence. 13 recurrences were located intra-hepatically. Of the 33 extra-hepatic 
recurrences lung, bones, adrenal glands and peritoneum 
were afected in 12, 9, 5, 4 patients; abdominal wall, thoracic 
wall and pericardium were afected in one each.
Following LT with prior bridging, one patient developed 
an intra-hepatic recurrence, 16 patients (18%) developed 
extra-hepatic recurrence. Without prior bridging, intrahepatic recurrence was observed in 12 patients (16%), 
extra-hepatic recurrence in 17 patients (22%). The rates of

intra-hepatic recurrence were statistically signifcantly different (p=0.001).
Duration of recurrence diagnosis from LT was median 
12  months (range 2–62). Where possible, recurrences 
were treated with curative intent. In cases of intra-hepatic 
recurrence (IHR), patients survived for median 2 months 
and in cases of extra-hepatic recurrence (EHR) 18 months. 
Patients treated with curative intent survived the recurrence 
for median 38 months, patients treated with palliative intent 
6 months.
Discussion
To our best knowledge, this is the frst monocentric series 
that shows a statistically independent infuence of bridging 
therapy on tumor-related 10-year survival after liver transplantation in patients with HCC in cirrhosis. In patients 
with bridging therapy, the rate of intra-hepatic recurrence 
decreased from 16 to 1%, but the rate of extra-hepatic 
recurrence was unchanged. 20 patients had a complete 
pathological response. None of them died of recurrence as 
yet. Only transplanted patients were enrolled in the study. 
The majority of patients which were removed from the transplant waiting list had distant metastases or intra-hepatic 
tumor progress. Rarely, patients were removed from the list 
for other reasons, like aggravation of comorbidities, noncompliance or newly diagnosed second primary tumors. If 
liver function was sufcient, loco-regional ablative therapy 
was carried out in these patients. Unfortunately, these data 
are missing due the retrospective data analysis.
EASL/EORTC guidelines and the international consensus conference for liver transplantation for hepatocellular 
carcinoma recommend bridging therapy if the waiting time 
exceeds 6 months [15, 16]. The American guidelines from 
the AASLD states bridging therapy as the method to prevent 
tumor progression and drop out from the waiting list [17].
Studies on bridging therapies are extremely heterogenous. There are no recommendations concerning indications for the diferent procedures, choice of procedure in 
remaining vital tumor tissue as well as documentation and 
quality assurance of local ablative therapies. The choice of 
procedures often depends on local availability. Thus, comparability and reporting the results of these procedures are 
extremely difcult. In the literature as well as in our study, 
TACE was the most frequently employed bridging procedure. Currently, there are only small case series on 90Y RE 
as successful bridging therapy prior to transplantation [6, 
18–21]. Prospective randomized studies are missing, thus an 
evaluation of the 90Y RE is not possible to date. In selected 
patients with a maximum of three tumor lesions, each with 
a maximum diameter of 3 cm, RFA can be performed safely 
and efectively. Also, the large proportion of complete histological tumor absence in 7/13 patients treated with RFA in 
our study results from the limited tumor burden.
Primary tumor size and number of lesions vary (Yao und 
Fidelman 2016; [22]). In our series, transplantation was performed in 93/163 patients with HCC “outside Milan”. The 
efciency of bridging therapy in large tumors for meeting 
the Milan criteria was reported [22, 23]. In our series, too, 
the efect of bridging in small and large tumor burden was 
observed.
Short‑term efect of bridging
Numerous studies on bridging prior to LT evaluate the success from imaging studies, employing diferent standards 
for remission. Successful radiological criteria of downstaging are tumor shrinkage by 30 or 50% [5, 24], meeting the 
Milan criteria [6, 25, 26], meeting the Milan criteria with 
defnition of AFP target levels [22, 27], meeting the UCSF 
criteria [23] as well as complete or partial response according to the mRECIST criteria [28]. The pathological report 
of the explanted liver for evaluation of response behavior

is used only in some studies in addition to imaging studies 
after bridging. Shaker et al. have shown that radiological 
response was more pronounced than pathological evaluation 
of response from the explant specimen [29].
In the literature, information on complete pathological 
response after bridging therapy ranges from 10 to 54% in different procedures. In our patients, we saw complete pathological response after bridging in 20 of 87 patients (23%) (Table 4).
The efciency of local ablative therapy has been documented by various radiological studies [30, 31]. Lei et al. 
reported superior overall survival and tumor-free survival in 
the group of responders (patients with response (mRECIST) 
after local ablative therapy with TACE). In particular, the 
long-term results of patients with HCC outside Milan were 
after TACE with response better (p<0.05). In the univariate analysis as well as in the multivariate analysis, complete 
and partial response after TACE was the best predictor for 
survival and tumor-free survival [32]. Discrepancies of 25% 
between radiological and pathological response have been 
reported [33]. Thus, there is an uncertainty to date.
Other factors, such as waiting time for the donor organ or 
immunosuppression may infuence the recurrence rate after 
liver transplantation [34–36].
Long‑term efect of bridging
Few studies address the impact of bridging therapy on longterm survival. Here, too, diferent target criteria are being 
used (overall survival, disease specifc survival, recurrence 
rate). The observed 5-year survival in patients with bridging 
therapy prior to transplantation for HCC in cirrhosis ranges 
from 55 to 94% in the literature [25, 37] Only Lee et al. 
reported 10-year survival of 42% with bridging therapy [38].
The signifcant impact of tumor number on long-term survival in our series has also been documented by Pawlik et al. 
and Llovet et al. [39, 40]. Na et al. and Jang et al. reported in 
agreement with our series a statistically signifcant impact

of AFP levels on long-term survival [37, 41]. Agopian et al. 
reported a signifcant impact of AFP on the long-term results 
in correlation to response to bridging therapy [42]. Comparative studies between patients with and without bridging 
therapy are listed in Table 5. In the European register study 
of Pommergraad et al., there was a statistically signifcant 
diference in survival of patients transplanted for HCC with 
versus without bridging therapy [14]. In the other studies, 
no statistically signifcant diference was reported. 10-year 
survival rates have been reported by Seehofer et al. only, 
according to our knowledge (Table 5).
Summary
To reduce prognostically relevant recurrence after LT different options are being investigated. In our series, response 
behavior to bridging therapy prior to transplantation for 
HCC in the explanted liver had a positive impact on longterm survival, cumulative tumor recurrence rate and location 
of tumor recurrence after LT.
Lay summary
We report on a single-center analysis of all local ablative 
bridging procedures (TACE, RFA, RE, PEI) prior to liver 
transplantation with 10-year long-term survival.
