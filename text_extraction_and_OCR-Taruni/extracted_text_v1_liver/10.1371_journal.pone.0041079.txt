Abstract
Background: Associations have been made between obesity and reduced intestinal numbers of members of the phylum
Bacteroidetes, but there is no direct evidence of the role these bacteria play in obesity. Herein, the effects of Bacteroides
uniformis CECT 7771 on obesity-related metabolic and immune alterations have been evaluated.
Methods and Findings: Adult (6–8 week) male wild-type C57BL-6 mice were fed a standard diet or a high-fat-diet HFD to
induce obesity, supplemented or not with B. uniformis CECT 7771 for seven weeks. Animal weight was monitored and
histologic, biochemical, immunocompetent cell functions, and features of the faecal microbiota were analysed after
intervention. The oral administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 reduced body weight gain, liver steatosis and liver
cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and increased small adipocyte numbers in HFD-fed mice. The strain also reduced
serum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, insulin and leptin levels, and improved oral tolerance to glucose in HFD fed mice.
The bacterial strain also reduced dietary fat absorption, as indicated by the reduced number of fat micelles detected in
enterocytes. Moreover, B. uniformis CECT 7771 improved immune defence mechanisms, impaired in obesity. HFD-induced
obesity led to a decrease in TNF-a production by peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS, conversely, the
administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 increased TNF-a production and phagocytosis. Administering this strain also
increased TNF-a production by dendritic cells (DCs) in response to LPS stimulation, which was significantly reduced by HFD.
B. uniformis CECT 7771 also restored the capacity of DCs to induce a T-cell proliferation response, which was impaired in
obese mice. HFD induced marked changes in gut microbiota composition, which were partially restored by the intervention.
Conclusions: Altogether, the findings indicate that administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 ameliorates HFD-induced
metabolic and immune dysfunction associated with intestinal dysbiosis in obese mice.

Introduction
Obesity is considered a major health issue due to its increasing
prevalence and associated co-morbidities (e.g. type 2 diabetes, fatty
liver and cardiovascular disease) affecting both the developed and
the developing world [1–2]. This disorder is the result of a longterm positive energy imbalance and is associated with a chronic
state of low grade inflammation and immune dysfunction [3–5].
The microbiota of the human gastrointestinal tract has been
considered as an organ that contributes to human physiological
diversity by encoding additional metabolic capacities and regulating gene expression of pathways involved in host nutrient
metabolism [6]. Animal studies indicate that colonisation of adult
germ-free mice with a distal gut microbial community harvested
from conventionally raised mice influences energy-balance by
increasing both nutrient digestion and absorption, and adiposity
[7]. This effect is mediated by different mechanisms, including
microbial fermentation of dietary polysaccharides that are
otherwise indigestible by the host, subsequent intestinal absorption
of monosaccharides and short-chain fatty acids, conversion of
these metabolites to more complex lipids in the liver; and
microbial regulation of host genes that promote lipid accumulation
in adipocytes [8].
In humans, the gut microbiota composition is also thought to
play a role in energy balance, as inferred from observational
studies reporting associations between obesity or weight loss and
shifts in gut microbiota composition. It has been reported that 80–
90% of bacterial phylotypes are members of two phyla, namely
Bacteroidetes (including the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella) and
Firmicutes (including the genera Clostridium, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Ruminococcus), followed by the phyla Actinobacteria
(including the genus Bifidobacterium) and Proteobacteria (including
Helicobacter and Escherichia) [9–10]. Therefore, relative proportions
of Firmicutes and Bacteroides are considered good indicators of
major changes in intestinal microbiota constitution. So far, most
studies have reported associations between obesity and reduced
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e41079

proportions of the phylum Bacteroidetes [11] which, in some
cases, were accompanied by increased proportions of Actinobacteria [6] or Firmicutes [12], as also observed in mice [9,13]. In
addition, weight loss in obese human subjects subjected to dietary
or surgical interventions has been associated with increases in
Bacteroidetes [12] or in Bacteroides spp., Bacteroides-Prevotella spp. or
Bacteroides fragilis group [14–17]. Nevertheless, few observational
studies have found no associations between weight-loss or obesity
and numbers of Bacteroides spp. or Bacteroides-Prevotella spp. [18–19],
reported opposite associations between obesity, and the relative
proportion of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes [19] or the numbers of
Prevotellaceae, a subgroup of Bacteroidetes [20]. These discrepancies
could partly be explained by differences in the analytical
techniques used since, for example, real-time PCR or FISH target
only specific groups of Bacteroidetes and underestimate some
members of this phylum present in faecal samples [21]. By
contrast, DNA sequence analyses of the phylum Bacteroidetes can
cover up to 46 species of bacteria belonging to seven different
genera of the order Bacteroidales [6], encompassing a taxonomic
unit that is too broad to assess its possible implication in obesity
[21].
In this study, we hypothesised that modification of the gut
microbiota structure by increasing numbers of specific Bacteroides
spp. could contribute to restoring obesity-related metabolic and
immune dysfunction. To obtain direct evidence of the role of
Bacteroides spp. in obesity and thus confirm such a hypothesis, we
have evaluated in vitro the immunologic properties of different
intestinal Bacteroides spp. on macrophages. Furthermore, we have
assessed the effect of the selected strain (B. uniformis CECT 7771)
on metabolic and immune parameters of mice with high-fat-diet
induced obesity.
Methods
Bacterial Strain and Culture Conditions
The following Bacteroides spp. and strains from the IATA-CSIC
and Spanish Culture Collection (CECT) were studied: Bacteroides
dorei SS1, Bacteroides ovatus SU2, Bacteroides distasonis CAY3,
Bacteroides uniformis CECT 7771 (or CY1), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
SAC4, Bacteroides fragilis SX3, Bacteroides caccae SV3 and Bacteroides
finegoldii SX2. These strains were isolated from stools of healthy
infants (mean age 5.7 years, range 1.0–10.8 years). Briefly, fresh
stool samples were diluted (1:10 [w/v]) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution (130 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.2) and homogenised. Then, aliquots of serial
dilutions in PBS and aliquots were plated on Schaedler Agar
(Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain) supplemented with kanamycin
(100 mg/L), vancomycin (7.5 mg/L) and vitamin K (0.5 mg/L)
and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 uC for 48 hours.
Individual colonies were isolated from the highest dilution plate
from each subject and their cellular morphology and Gramstaining characteristics were examined. The isolated clones were
identified at species level by sequencing of amplified 16S rDNA
regions with the primers 27f and 1401r as previously described
[22]. The PCR products obtained were purified using the GFXtm
PCR DNA and Gel Band DNA Purification Kit (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK) for DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing
was carried out by an ABI PRISM-3130XL Genetic Analyser (Applied
Biosystems, California, USA). The closest relatives of the partial
16S rRNA gene sequences were sought in GenBank using the
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm, and
sequences with more than 97% similarity were considered as
belonging to the same species. All new data has been deposited in
GenBank (Accession numbers: JX183979, JX262250, JX183978,
JX183977, JX183984, JX183983, JX183981 and JX183982,
respectively).
For experimental purposes, the bacterial strains were grown in
Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BH) (Scharlab, SL- Barcelona, Spain)
at 37 uC in microaerophilic conditions (AnaeroGen; Oxoid,
Basingstoke, UK). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 g
for 15 min), washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS,
1306 sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), and
re-suspended in PBS plus 15% glycerol for in vitro trials and in 10%
skimmed milk for animal trials. Aliquots of these suspensions were
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80uC until used. The
number of live cells after freezing and thawing was determined by
colony-forming unit (CFU) counting on BH agar after 48 h
incubation. For the strain tested, more than 90% cells were alive
upon thawing and no significant differences were found during
storage time (2 months). One fresh aliquot was thawed for every
new experiment to avoid variability in the viability of cultures.
Effect of Bateroides Strains on Induction of Cytokine
Production by Macrophages
To evaluate the immunological properties of different Bacteroides
strains, the RAW 264 macrophage cell line, obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA), was
cultured overnight in 24-well flat-bottom polystyrene microtiter
plates (Corning, Cultek, Madrid, Spain) at a concentration of
16105 cells per ml in Dulbeco’s Modified Eagles Medium
(DMEM) (SigmaTM– St. Louis, MO/USA). Media were changed
before stimulation and, then, cells were incubated in the presence
of 100 ml of a cell suspension (16107 cfu/ml) of each Bacteroides
strain for 24 h. Purified LPS from Salmonella enterica serotype
Typhimurium (Sigma Chemical Co, Madrid, Spain) was used at a
concentration of 1 mg/ml as a positive control. Non-stimulated
Raw 264.7 cells were also evaluated as controls of basal cytokine
production. The cell culture supernatants were collected and
stored at 220uC until used for cytokine determination. TNF-a
and IL-10 were quantified by ELISA Ready SET Go! Kit (BD
Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). Every parameter was assayed
in triplicate in two independent experiments.
Animals, Diets and Experimental Design
Animal experiments were carried out in strict accordance with
the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of University of Valencia (Central Service of
Support to Research [SCSIE], University of Valencia, Spain) and
the protocol was approved by its Ethic Committee (approval ID
A1245740259386). Adult (age 6–8 week) male wild-type C57BL-6
mice were purchased from Harlan Laboratories. During the
adaptation period (7 days), six animals were housed in each
stainless-steel cage in a temperature-controlled (23 uC) room with
a 12-h light/dark cycle and 40–50% relative humidity. Then, mice
were randomly divided into four groups (n = 628 mice per group)
as follows: (1) a control group, receiving a standard diet (SD); (2) an
obese group, receiving a high-fat diet (HFD); (3) a group receiving
a SD and a daily dose of 5.06108 CFU B. uniformis CECT 7771 by
gavage; and (4) an obese group receiving the HFD and a daily dose
of 5.06108 CFU B. uniformis CECT 7771 by oral gavage. To
induce obesity, mice were switched from the SD (CA.170481-
AIN-76A Purified Diet-Rats/Mice, Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI 53744-4220) administered during the adaptation period to
all mice, to a HFD (TD.06414 - Adjusted Calories Diet - 60/Fat,
Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI 53744-4220) for 7 weeks. The
HFD provided 18.4% kcal as protein, 21.3% kcal as carbohydrate
and 60.3% kcal as fat (5.1 kcal/g), whereas the SD provided
18.8% kcal as protein, 68.8% kcal as carbohydrate and 12.4% kcal
Bacteroides uniformis and Obesity

as fat (3.8 kcal/g). Therefore, there was an increase in fat at
expenses of a reduction in carbohydrates in the HFD. Mice had
free access to feed and sterile water.
Body weight was measured once a week and, at the end of
study, animals were fasted for 16 h, anaesthetised, bled by aortic
puncture and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. To analyse the
metabolic parameters, blood samples were collected in tubes
containing EDTA and centrifuged to obtain plasma that was
stored at -20uC. Stools were collected at the end of the
experimental period (7 weeks) for microbiological analyses. The
liver, white adipose (perirenal and epididymal) and small intestinal
tissues were excised and rinsed with saline solution, and sections
were fixed in 10% neutral formalin buffered solution for
histological analysis. The white adipose deposits (perirenal and
epididymal) were previously weighed. Liver sections were also used
for lipid extraction and quantification as described below.
Histology of Liver, White Adipose Tissues and Small
Intestine
Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned to a thickness of 4–
5 mm and fixed to glass slides. Slides were deparaffinised and stained
with haematoxylin-eosin. The severity of steatosis was determined in
100 hepatocytes of two liver tissue sections per mouse and scored as
follows: grade 0 when fat was not detected in hepatocytes; grade 1
when fat occupied less than 30% of hepatocytes; grade 2 when fat
occupied between 30 and 60% of hepatocytes; grade 3, when fat
occupied more than 60% of hepatocytes.
Adipocyte cell sizes were measured in 100 cells of two sections of
epididymal adipose tissue per mouse [23]. Adipocyte cell sizes
were expressed as area ranges using the following ranges: ,2000,
2000–4000,4000–6000 and 6000–7000 mm2
.
The ratio of fat micelles to enterocyte was determined in 100
cells from two sections of small intestinal tissue of each mouse by
counting ten 100X light microscope fields. All parameters were
measured in a NIKON Eclipse 90i Microscopic, using the NIS
Elements BR 2.3 basic research software (Kingston, Surrey, KT2
5PR, England). All histological analyses were conducted by an
experienced histologist in a blind fashion.
Analysis of Serum and Liver Biochemical Parameters and
Glucose Tolerance
Biochemical parameters were quantified in plasma using
enzymatic assay kits for glucose (Glucose Liquid Kit; Quı´mica
Analı´tica Aplicada SA, Spain), cholesterol (Cholesterol Liquid kit,
Quı´mica Analı´tica Aplicada SA, Spain) and triglycerides (Triglyceride Liquid kit, Quı´mica Analı´tica Aplicada SA, Spain). Serum
leptin concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (BD Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA).
Serum insulin was determined by Ultrasensitive Mouse Insulin
ELISA (Mercondia AB, Sweden, 2010).
Triglycerides and cholesterol were also quantified in liver.
Lipids were extracted by homogenising the tissue with 2:1
chloroform-methanol (v/v) making a 20-fold dilution, and filtering
the homogenate through a nylon filter (Cell Strainer 40
micrometros Nylon.BD Falcon; BD BIOSCIENCIES). Nonlipidic substances were eliminated by adding 5-volumes of CaCl2
solution (5 mg/L) in water to the filtrate fraction. After
centrifugation (4,000 g, for 5 minutes, at room temperature) the
upper phase, containing all of the non-lipidic substances, was
discarded. This process was repeated three times. Extracted lipids
were dried under vacuum (Concentrator Plus 5301, Eppendorf
Inc., NY, USA) and then triglyceride and total cholesterol
concentrations were determined as described above.
Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in vivo after 6 weeks
of treatment. Food was removed 2 h after the onset of the daylight
cycle and, after a 4-h fasting period, glucose was administered
orally at a dose of 2 g/kg and blood samples were taken with
heparinised capillary tubes from the tail vein before and 15, 30,
60, 90 and 120 minutes after glucose administration. Plasma
glucose levels were analysed with glucose test strips (Ascensia
Esyfill, Bayer, Tarrytown, NY; USA) and a glucometer (Ascensia
VIGOR, Bayer Tarrytown, NY; USA), with a detection level
ranging from 30 to 550 mg glucose/dl.
Isolation and Assessment of Cytokine Production by
Peritoneal Macrophages
Peritoneal cells were collected by washing the peritoneal cavity
of different groups of mice, with 5 ml of sterile cold DMEM
(Sigma), containing 10% inactivated (56uC for 30 min) foetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Barcelona, Spain), 100 mg/ml
streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (SigmaTM– St. Louis,
MO/USA). Isolated macrophages were plated in flasks (Corning,
Cultek, Madrid, Spain) at a concentration of 16106 cells per ml in
DMEM and incubated for 2 h at 37uC in an atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. Non-adhered cells were washed out with
warm PBS. To evaluate differences in the response to a common
stimulus, macrophages from different mouse groups were incubated in the presence of purified LPS from Salmonella enterica
serotype Typhimurium (Sigma Chemical Co, Madrid, Spain) at a
concentration of 1 mg/ml. Non-stimulated peritoneal macrophages were also evaluated as controls of basal cytokine production. To
evaluate microbiota-related immune properties of faecal samples,
macrophages from control mice were incubated in the presence of
faecal samples (30 ml of 10-fold dilution) from the different mouse
groups for 24 h. Stool samples used as stimuli were collected from
six mice of each experimental group at the end of the study,
diluted 10-fold in PBS and homogenised for 3 min. Macrophage
culture supernatants were collected and stored at 220uC until
used for cytokine determination. TNF-a and IL-10 were
quantified by ELISA Ready SET Go! Kit (BD Bioscience, San
Diego, CA, USA). Each parameter was assayed in triplicate in two
independent experiments.
Bactericidal Activity of Peritoneal Macrophages
The bactericidal activity of peritoneal macrophages was
analysed according to Vieira et al. [24] Cells were washed with
serum-free DMEM and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT – SigmaTM–
St. Louis, MO/USA) at 0.5 mg/ml together with a bacterial
extract (Stimulant, No. 840-15-SigmaTM– St. Louis, MO/USA)
in an equivalent concentration of McFarland Scale 2 in Lab-tek
chamber slide w/cover (Nalge Nunc International, USA). After
1 h of incubation at 37 uC in 5% CO2 atmosphere, the cells were
washed with PBS, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
observed in a NIKON Eclipse 90i Microscope, using the NIS
Elements BR 2.3 basic research software (Kingston, Surrey, KT2
5PR, England). One hundred cells were counted per mouse and
the percentage of NBT positive cells was determined. This
measurement was taken in triplicate, in two independent
experiments.
Isolation and Cytokine Production by Bone Marrowderived Dendrite Cells (DC)
DCs were generated from bone marrow as described previously
[25]. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 16106 (90–94%
DCs) in 1 ml of culture medium without rm GM-CSF in 24-well
plates (Corning, Cultek, Madrid, Spain) and incubated in the
Bacteroides uniformis and Obesity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e41079

presence of faeces (30 ml) from the respective mouse group at 37uC
under 5% CO2 for 24 h. Purified LPS from S. enterica serotype
Typhimurium (Sigma Chemical Co, Madrid, Spain) was used at a
concentration of 1 mg/ml as a positive control. Non-stimulated
DCs were also evaluated as controls of basal cytokine production.
Stool samples were obtained and prepared as described above.
The cell culture supernatants were collected and stored at 220uC
until used for cytokine determination (TNF-a and IL-10) as
described above. Every parameter was assayed in triplicate, in two
independent experiments.
Interactions between DCs and CD4+ T Lymphocytes
CD4+ T lymphocytes were isolated from mouse spleens, which
were excised, suspended in complete medium and passed through
a stainless steel wire mesh. The obtained crude cell suspension was
washed once. CD4+ T cells were immune-magnetically isolated by
positive selection with ‘‘CD4+ (L3T4) microbeads’’ (Miltenyi
Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. CD4+ T cells (purity exceeded 95%)
were used for mixed lymphocyte reaction.
Isolated DCs were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 1 mg/ml
LPS from S. Typhimurium (Sigma Chemical Co, Madrid, Spain).
Aliquots of mature DCs from different mouse groups were plated in
triplicate with allogeneic CD4+ T cells (TL) at 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 TL/
DC cell ratios, in 0.2 ml culture medium in 96-well flat-bottomed
plates (Corning, Cultek, Madrid, Spain) at 37 uC for 72 h.
Lymphocyte proliferation was measured with the cell proliferation
ELISA BrdU-colorimetric assay (Roche, Diagnostic, Germany).
Individual cultures of DCs and TL stimulated with or without ConA,
used as mitogen, were used as controls.
Samples and Microbial Analysis by Quantitative PCR
(qPCR)
Stool samples were weighed, diluted 1:5 (w/v) in PBS (pH 7.2),
homogenised by shaking in a vortex and stored at -20 uC till
analysed. One aliquot of this dilution was used for DNA extraction
using the QIAamp DNA stool Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Specific primers (Table 1) [26–30] targeting different
bacterial genera and species were used to characterise the
composition of the microbiota by qPCR using LightCyclerH 480
SYBR Green I Master (Roche, USA) with a an ABI PRISM 7000-
PCR sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, UK), as
described previously [14].
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 11.0 software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data of biochemical parameters
were normally distributed and significant differences were
determined by applying One-Way Anova with pos hoc Tukey’s
test. Remaining data were non-normally distributed and the
differences were determined by applying the Mann-Whitney U
tests. In every case, P-values ,0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
Bacteroides Strain Selection Based on in vitro Ability to
Induce Cytokine Production
Results in Table 2 show the ability of different Bacteroides strains
to induce cytokine production by Raw264.7 macrophages. All
strains induced the production of significantly higher amounts of
the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a than the non-stimulated
cells and LPS-stimulated macrophages, although the magnitude of
this effect was strain-dependent. The strains B. dorei SS1, B.
uniformis CECT 7771 and B. thetaiotaomicron SAC4 induced the
lowest TNF-a production. Different bacterial strains also induced
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production above basal levels to
different extents, except for B. thetaiotaomicron SAC4, B. fragilis SX3
and B. finegoldii SX2 whose effects were not significant. B. uniformis
CECT 7771 induced the highest IL-10 levels compared to the
other Bacteroides strains under study. Therefore, this strain was
selected for its greater anti-inflammatory properties.
Body Weight Gain, Adipose Tissue Weight and
Biochemical Parameters in Obese Mice
Body weight gain and total adipose tissue weight of mice after a
7-week intervention are shown in Table 3. The time course body
weight gain over the intervention period is also shown in Figure 1.
HFD-fed mice experienced significant greater weight gain
compared to SD-fed mice from the first 4 weeks of treatment till
the 7th week. The weights of total adipose tissues were also
statistically significantly greater in obese mice than in lean mice.

Bacteroides uniformis and Obesity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e41079

The administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 significantly
reduced body weight gain in HFD-fed mice by the end of the
intervention, but did not significantly modify total adipose tissue
weight (Table 3, Figure 1). No mice died and all of them remained
healthy throughout the study.
Serum concentrations of biochemical and hormonal parameters
of metabolic relevance are shown in Table 3. The HFD induced a
significant increase in all serum parameters analysed compared to
SD-fed mice. The administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771
significantly reduced serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides and
cholesterol concentrations in HFD-fed mice but not in SD-fed
mice. In HFD-fed mice B. uniformis CECT 7771 reduced
cholesterol levels by 18% and triglyceride levels by 25%.
B. uniformis CECT 7771 administration also significantly lowered
fasting glucose levels (Table 3) and improved glucose tolerance,
reducing the maximum peak and the area under the curve during
the oral glucose tolerance test (Figure 2). The increased serum
leptin concentrations induced by the HFD were significantly
reduced by the administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 (Table 3).
The specific concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides
present in total lipids extracted from the liver were also analysed
(Table 3). The HFD induced a significant increase in both
parameters compared to levels in SD-fed mice, while the
administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 significantly reduced
triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations in the liver of HFD-fed
mice (Table 3).
Hepatic Steatosis, Adipocyte size, and Fat Absorption by
Enterocytes in Obese Mice
Figure 3 shows the effects on hepatic steatosis of the
administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 to SD- or HFD-fed
mice. The bacterial strain significantly reduced steatosis in HFDfed animals, and also reduced lipid accumulation in the liver of
SD-fed mice. The administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 to SD
mice significantly increased the number of hepatocytes with no
steatosis (0-grade) and reduced those with steatosis grades 1 and 2.
In HFD-fed animals, B. uniformis CECT 7771 administration
contributed to increasing the number of hepatocytes with 0- and 1-
grade steatosis and to reducing those with 2-and 3-grade steatosis.
The effects of the intervention on adipocyte size on epididimal
adipose tissue are shown in Figure 4. HFD induced a significant
increase in adipocyte size in the following ranges 2000–4000,
4000–6000 and 6000–7000 mm2
, and reduced those of size ,2000
mm2. The administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 in SD-fed
mice did not induce significant changes in adipocyte size, while a
significant increase in the number of small adipocytes (,2000) was
observed in HFD-fed mice.
The effects of the HFD and the administration of the bacterial
strain on the number of fat micelles per enterocyte, which indicate
dietary fat absorption, are shown in Figure 5. The HFD induced a
significant increase in fat micelles in enterocytes, whereas the
administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 reduced these numbers.
In the SD group, no significant changes were observed due to
intervention with the aforementioned bacterium.
Macrophage Functionality
The results of cytokine production by LPS-stimulated peritoneal
macrophages from SD- and HFD-fed mice with and without B.
uniformis CECT 7771 supplementation are shown in Figure 6.
Obesity induced by a HFD led to a decrease in cytokine TNF-a
production by peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS
compared to macrophages of SD-fed mice (Figure 6A). The
administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 significantly increased
the ability of LPS-stimulated macrophages to produce TNF-a in
HFD-fed mice but not in SD-fed mice (Figure 6A). The HFD did
not affect the ability of LPS-stimulated macrophages to produce
the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and this feature was not
modified by the administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771
(Figure 6A). The oxidative burst in peritoneal macrophage after
uptake of a microbial extract was also studied to analyse effects on
phagocytosis function (Figure 6B). The results indicated that the
oral administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 stimulated this
function in macrophages in both SD- and HFD-fed mice
(Figure 6B).
Dendritic Cell (DC) Functionality
The results of cytokine production by LPS-stimulated DC from
SD- and HFD-fed mice, with and without B. uniformis CECT 7771
supplementation are shown in Figure 7A. The administration of B.
uniformis CECT 7771 to obese and lean mice increased the ability
of DC to produce TNF-a in response to LPS stimulation, which
was significantly reduced by the HFD (Figure 7A). In HFD-fed
mice, IL-10 production by LPS-stimulated DCs was significantly
increased. The administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771
increased IL-10 values even more in HFD-fed mice and also
stimulated this cytokine production in SD-fed mice (Figure 7A).
The results of the influence of HFD-induced obesity and oral
administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 on the ability of
matured DCs to priming a T cell proliferative response are shown
in Figure 7B. DCs from SD-fed mice were able to induce a
significant increase in T cell proliferation in comparison to T cells
alone (data not shown) in all the examined DC:T cell ratios. The
HFD impaired the capacity of DCs to induce a T cell proliferation
response, but this function was restored by B. uniformis CECT 7771
administration, and the strongest effects were obtained at 1:4
DC:T ratio. This effect was also significant for SD-fed mice.

mice is shown in Table 4. The HFD led to reductions in the gene

and the group C. leptum. The numbers of the C. coccoides group
followed the same trend, but the differences were not significant.
To evaluate whether these changes in the microbiota could
modify the inflammatory signals coming from the gut in the
different mouse groups, the ability of faecal samples to induce the
production of cytokines by immunocompetent cells in vitro was
evaluated (Figure 8A and 8B). Stool samples from HFD-fed mice
induced a higher production of TNF-a than those from SD-fed
mice by macrophages (Figure 8A) and DCs (Figure 8B), indicating
that the HFD induced an increase in the pro-inflammatory signals
coming from the gut. The administration of B. uniformis CECT
7771 significantly reduced the production of this pro-inflammatory
cytokine in macrophages stimulated with stools from both mouse
groups (Figure 8A), and in DCs stimulated with stools from the
HFD group. Therefore, this bacterial strain seems to have ability
to reduce the inflammatory properties of the gut content, although
confirmatory studies measuring additional inflammatory markers
in the gut would be required to draw definitive conclusions.
In macrophages (Figure 8A) and DCs (Figure 8B), stool samples
of HFD-fed mice induced significantly higher production of the

Discussion
This study has provided direct evidence of the metabolic and
immune effects of B. uniformis CECT 7771 in a murine model of
diet-induced obesity. Previous scientific research was controversial
and had only established associations between either a lean

phenotype or weight loss with increased intestinal numbers of the
phylum Bacteroidetes phylum, or the groups Bacteroides-Prevotella or
Bacteroides fragilis [9,11–20]. The selection of the specific strain
tested was based on its lower inflammatory potential in vitro on
macrophages compared to strains belonging to other intestinal
Bacteroides spp. This trait could be relevant in the context of obesity
since it is considered a chronic inflammatory disorder, largely
mediated by macrophage infiltration in the adipose tissue [31–33].
Our study demonstrated that B. uniformis CECT 7771 induced low
TNF-a production and the highest IL-10 production in comparison with other strains of Bacteroides spp. Our recent studies also
demonstrated that the prevalence of B. uniformis CECT 7771 in the
gut of infants is favoured by breast-feeding [22] and breast-feeding
seems to protect against later development of obesity as compared
to formula feeding [34–35]. Considering these data altogether led
us to hypothesise that the oral administration of B. uniformis CECT
7771 could exert beneficial effects in an obesity model as reported
in this study.
In our mouse obesity model, B. uniformis CECT 7771
administration induced significant modifications in total body
weight gain by the end of intervention, although differences in
adipose tissue weight were not significant, probably due to the
limited duration of the trial. However, B. uniformis CECT 7771
increased the number of small adipocytes in obese mice, which
could precede fat weight reduction. In contrast, colonisation of
germ-free mice by B. thetaiotaomicron and Methanobrevibacter smithii
augmented de novo lipogenesis and adiposity [36]. In this context, it
was proposed that gut colonisation by the conventional microbiota
or by specific commensal bacteria (e.g. B. thetaiotaomicron) provides
the hydrolases necessary to utilise complex polysaccharides and
the resulting products are absorbed or metabolised to short-chain
fatty acids. Subsequently, the latter are delivered to the liver and
converted to triacylglycerols and, then, part of these de novo
synthesised lipids are deposited in adipocytes [37–38]. In addition,
it was considered that the gut microbiota could reduce the fastinginduced adipose factor (Fiaf, also known as angiopoietin-like
protein-4), a secreted lipoprotein lipase (LPL) inhibitor [8],
promoting storage of fatty acids released by the LPL in the host
adipose tissue, but this mechanism was not confirmed in a latter
study [39]. Although the animal models used in our and previous
studies are not comparable, the results suggest that different
Bacteroides spp. might exert different effects on energy balance and
lipid storage.
In obese subjects there is also an increased flux of free fatty acids
to the liver due to their excessive accumulation in the adipose
tissue and to the inability of insulin to suppress lipolysis in
adipocytes due to insulin resistance, which leads to steatosis or
fatty liver disease [40–41]. In our study, the administration of B.
uniformis CECT 7771 significantly reduced steatosis in obese
animals and, interestingly, also reduced liver cholesterol and
triglyceride accumulation. In obese mice, liver steatosis and
adipocyte hypertrophy is reported to be related to an increased
energy input via intestinal lipid absorption, which is transported in
the form of chylomicrons to peripheral tissues [42]. Therefore, we
also analysed the number of fat micelles per enterocyte, which
partly represents fat absorbed from the diet. B. uniformis CECT
7771 administration significantly reduced the fat micelles in
enterocytes, particularly in obese mice, indicating that this is a
mechanism by which this bacterial strain exerts a positive effect on
liver steatosis and serum lipids. Other studies also demonstrated
that specific lactobacilli or bifidobacterial strains might reduce the
absorption of dietary fat, but this is the first evidence that a
Bacteroides strain exerts this effect depending on the diet [40,42,43].
However, the involvement of other mechanisms, such as reduction
of endogenous biosynthesis or reduction of lipid uptake by
hepatocytes, cannot be disregarded [44].
Dyslipidaemia is also a frequent feature of obese subjects, with
the most common being hypertriclyceridaemias and hypercholesFigure 5. Number of fat micelles per enterocyte in control mice and mice with high fat diet-induced obesity, administered or not B.

terolaemias [45,46], which are also induced by HFD in mice. In
this study, HFD-fed mice showed higher values of serum
cholesterol and triglyceride levels than SD-fed mice. B. uniformis
CECT 7771 administration reduced serum cholesterol and
triglyceride levels in HFD-fed mice. These effects could also be
partially related to a reduction of dietary fat absorption and
possibly to modulation of the expression of genes and proteins
involved in lipid homeostasis in the gut and liver, as indicated
previously.
Hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance are also frequently
associated with obesity in humans [1–2]. This feature was also
reproduced in our mice obesity model, which showed increased
fasting glucose levels and reduced glucose tolerance. However, the
administration of B. uniformis CECT 7771 significantly improved

the response to an oral glucose challenge and reduced the fasting
glycaemia in parallel to insulin, suggesting an improvement in
glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Comparisons between
germ-free and conventional mice indicated that the commensal
microbiota, as a whole, induced hyperglycaemia and insulin
resistance [44] while administration of antibiotics causing a
reduction in the intestinal bacterial load improved oral glucose
tolerance in ob/ob and HFD-fed mice [47,48]. The adverse effects
attributed to the microbiota were related to a reduction of AMPK
activity and, therefore, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transFigure 7. Influence of LPS stimuli on cytokine production and activation of T-lymphocyte proliferation by dendritic cells (DCs)

port in muscles [38] and to a reduction of inflammatory signals
coming from the gut, such as LPS from Gram-negative bacteria
and its correlation with intestinal and plasma TNF-a levels [49].
Nevertheless, our present and previous studies indicated that
intervention in the gut ecosystem with specific strains may improve
diet-induced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance above the
commensal microbiota effects [40].
Obesity often manifests with hyperleptinemia, associated with
leptin resistance, leading to different central and peripheral
adverse effects, including increased hunger and reduced energy
expenditure as well as increased lipid accumulation [50]. B.
uniformis CECT 7771 administration also led to reduced leptin
levels in obese mice, which could be indicative of an improvement
in leptin function or sensitivity, leading to lower leptin production
[51]. These improved leptin levels could be related to improvements in glucose tolerance and reduced serum concentration since
leptin favours insulin function [52]. In addition, the reduction of
serum leptin levels could also be related to increases in smaller
adipocytes and reduced liver steatosis in HFD-fed mice supplemented with the bacterial strain due to the role of leptin in fat
accumulation in peripheral tissues [53].
Our study also showed that B. uniformis CECT 7771 administration improves immune function of macrophages and DCs,
which is particularly important in obese mice. It is known that
macrophage function is impaired in obesity, showing reduced
phagocytic capacity and oxidative burst, which has been linked to
increased susceptibility to infections of obese subjects [54,55]. In
our study, phagocytic function of macrophages was slightly
reduced by the HFD, in accordance with others authors [56].
However, B. uniformis CECT 7771 administration stimulated the
oxidative burst of macrophages in both HFD and SD-fed mice.
Our study also demonstrates that B. uniformis CECT 7771
administration improved the ability of macrophages and DCs to
produce cytokines in response to a pathogenic bacterial stimulus
(LPS). B. uniformis CECT 7771 also restored the capacity of DCs to
present antigens and stimulate T lymphocyte proliferation. A
functional deficiency of DCs in ob/ob mice has also been described
previously, suggesting that this damage could be generalised to the
more frequent forms of obesity [41]. Altogether, our data indicates
that B. uniformis CECT 7771 can improve innate and adaptive
defence mechanisms against infections in diet-induced obesity.
This study also confirms that diet has a tremendous impact on
the intestinal microbiota composition and supports the hypothesis
that its modulation through the use of dietary strategies could
ameliorate the metabolic and immune dysfunctions associated
with imbalanced diets. The HFD reduced gene copy numbers of
Gram-positive bacteria, including Bifidobacterium spp. and C.
coccoides group, in accordance with previous studies [49]. Our
study also demonstrates that the HFD increased the gene copy
numbers of enterobacteria, while B. uniformis CECT 7771 slightly
reduced these numbers and increased those of C. coccoides group,
Bifidobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp. Furthermore, the B. uniformis
CECT 7771-related changes in microbiota contributed to
reducing the gut inflammatory signals, which could affect other
peripheral tissues involved in obesity. In this context, endotoxins
(LPS) from enterobacteria, present in the gut, have been shown to
play an important role in the development of insulin resistance and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [57]. In ob/ob mice, reductions of
intestinal E. coli numbers by antibiotic treatment were associated
with the reduction of metabolic endotoxaemia and inflammatory
status as well as with improvements in insulin resistance [58].
Another recent study also reported that positive effects of
prebiotics (oligofructose and inulin mixture) on body weight and
fat and related metabolic parameters could be due to their ability
to increase numbers of both bacteroides and bifidobacteria in the
gut microbiota of obese JCR:LA-cp rats [13]. These changes were
related to modifying the expression of anorexigenic and orexigenic
peptides, but the role of each bacterial group on such effects
remains unclear.
In conclusion, the results support the hypothesis that the
B. uniformis CECT 7771 modulates the metabolic and immune
dysfunction induced by HFD at least in mice. The study provides
direct evidence of the potential beneficial roles played by
B. uniformis CECT 7771 in obesity, bringing us one step ahead
of the mere associations inferred from previous observational
studies. Therefore, the use of dietary strategies targeting the gut
ecosystem may be an additional tool to control metabolic
disorders. However, further studies are required to support this
hypothesis and to reveal plausible mechanisms of action of the

Figure 8. Influence of stool samples from mice fed standard diet or high-fat diet, supplemented or not with B. uniformis CECT 7771,
on cytokine production by peritoneal macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) from control mice. SD: standard diet group (control) (n = 6);
SD+B: standard diet group receiving a daily dose of 5.06108 CFU B. uniformis CECT 7771 by gavage for 7 weeks (n = 6); HFD: high fat diet group
(n = 6); HFD+B: high fat diet group receiving a daily dose of 5.06108 CFU B. uniformis CECT 7771 by gavage for 7 weeks (n = 6). In the cytokine
production study, peritoneal macrophages (Figure 8A) and DCs (Figure 8B) were stimulated with stool stimuli. Non-stimulated peritoneal
macrophages and DCs were evaluated as controls of basal cytokine levels. Figure 8A: TNF- a and IL-10 cytokines produced by stool-stimulated
peritoneal macrophages; Figure 8B: TNF- a and IL-10 cytokines produced by stool-stimulated CDs. Data are expressed as means 6 SD of duplicate
measures determined in two independent experiments. Statistically significant differences of data are established at P,0.05.
