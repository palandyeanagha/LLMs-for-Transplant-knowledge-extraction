The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the
feasibility of 11C-choline PET, compared with 18F-FDG PET, for
the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 16 HCC lesions in 12 patients were examined with both 11Ccholine PET and 18F-FDG PET. Tumor lesions were identified as
areas of focally increased uptake, exceeding that of surrounding
noncancerous liver tissue. For semiquantitative analysis, the
tumor-to-liver (T/L) ratio was calculated by dividing the maximal
standardized uptake value (SUV) in HCC lesions by the mean
SUV in noncancerous liver tissue. Results: 11C-choline PET
showed a slightly higher detection rate than did 18F-FDG PET
for detection of HCC (63% vs. 50%, respectively), although this
difference was not statistically significant. 11C-choline PET had
a better detection rate for moderately differentiated HCC lesions
but not for those poorly differentiated (75% vs. 25%, respectively).
In contrast, 18F-FDG PET exhibited the opposite behavior, with
corresponding detection rates of 42% and 75%, respectively.
The mean 11C-choline SUV and T/L ratio in moderately differentiated HCC lesions were higher than those in poorly differentiated
HCC lesions. In contrast, the mean 18F-FDG SUV and T/L ratio
in poorly differentiated HCC were higher than those in moderately
differentiated HCC. These differences, however, were also not
statistically significant. Conclusion: 11C-choline PET had a better
detection rate for moderately differentiated HCC lesions but not
for poorly differentiated HCC lesions, whereas 18F-FDG PET produced the opposite result. 11C-choline is a potential tracer to complement 18F-FDG in detection of HCC lesions.

PET with 18F-FDG is a well-established functional
diagnostic oncologic imaging technique that provides glucose metabolism information about lesions (1). However, it
is known that 18F-FDG PET is not sensitive enough in the
detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in
cases of low-grade HCC (2,3). Because the enzymatic activity
of low-grade HCC resembles that of normal hepatocytes, the
degree of 18F-FDG uptake in these tumors is low (4).
Recently, 11C-choline has been introduced as a new
tumor-seeking agent for evaluation of a variety of malignant
tumors (5–8). Choline is incorporated into cells through
phosphorylcholine synthesis and is integrated into the cell
membrane phospholipids (9). Malignant tumors may show a
high proliferation and increased metabolism of cell membrane components, which will lead to an increased uptake of
choline (10). To our knowledge, no reports have been published regarding the use of 11C-choline PET in the detection
of HCC.
The purpose of the present study was to retrospectively
investigate the feasibility of 11C-choline PET, compared
with 18F-FDG PET, for the detection of HCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This study was approved by our institutional review board, and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
A total of 12 consecutive preoperative patients (5 men, 7
women; mean age, 71 y; age range, 58–78 y) with HCC who
underwent both 11C-choline and 18F-FDG PET studies between
February 2007 and February 2008 were retrospectively selected.
Two patients were positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen, 7
patients were positive for hepatitis C virus antibody, and 3 patients
were negative for both. Nine patients had not been treated, and
the other 3 patients had received transcatheter arterial embolization therapy more than 10 d before the PET study (mean interval,
33 d). Surgery was performed after the PET study (mean interval,
22 d). The grade of HCC differentiation was estimated according
to Edmondson–Steiner classification (11).
Radiotracer Synthesis 11C-choline and 18F-FDG were produced using a cyclotron
(HM-18; Sumitomo Heavy Industries Co.). 11C-choline was produced by proton bombardment of 14N2. The resultant 11CO2 was
reduced to 11C-methanol by lithium aluminum hydride and subsequently converted to 11C-methyl iodide by addition of hydrogen
iodide by a modified method of Pascali et al. (12). The radiochemical purity of the produced 11C-choline was greater than 99%. 18FFDG was produced by proton bombardment of 18O-enriched water

by a modified method of Toorongian et al. (13). The radiochemical
purity of the produced 18F-FDG was greater than 95%.
PET
All acquisitions were performed using a scanner (ECAT EXACT
HR1; Siemens/CTI Inc.). The imaging system enabled simultaneous acquisition of 63 transverse PET images per field of view
(FOV), for a total axial FOV of 15.5 cm. In-plane resolution was
approximately 4.6 mm, with an axial resolution of approximately
3.5-mm full width at half maximum. PET scans were performed in
the 3-dimensional mode. A transmission scan was obtained using
a 68Ge rod source to provide attenuation correction. PET images
were reconstructed with ordered-subsets expectation maximization, using 2 iterations and 8 subsets.
Patients were instructed to fast for at least 5 h before the PET
scan. For 18F-FDG PET, a normal blood glucose level in the
peripheral blood was ensured. Five minutes after an intravenous
injection of 11C-choline (6 MBq/kg) or 60 min after an intravenous injection of 18F-FDG (3.5 MBq/kg), attenuation-corrected
whole-body scanning was performed from the skull base to the
proximal thighs, with 2 and 3 min allowed per bed position for
transmission and emission scans, respectively.
The 2 PET scans were acquired within 2 wk. No treatment was
performed during this period of PET.
Data Analysis
PET and maximum-intensity-projection images were reviewed
on a workstation (Sun Microsystems; Siemens/CTI Inc.) in the
transverse, coronal, and sagittal planes. Each scan was interpreted
independently by 2 experienced nuclear physicians who were
unaware of clinical data and information pertaining to the corresponding scan, except for the results of the CT scan. CT scans were
assessed for the exact localization of HCC lesions. Any difference
of opinion was resolved by consensus.
Tumor lesions were identified as areas of focally increased
uptake, exceeding that of surrounding noncancerous liver tissue.
For semiquantitative analysis, regions of interest (ROIs) were
placed over the entire 11C-choline– or 18F-FDG–avid lesion
including the largest amount of radioactivity using the transverse
PET image. For HCC lesions not visible on both or either of the 2
PET scans, an ROI was drawn on the respective scans in the
region corresponding to the area of abnormality on the CT scan.
For the noncancerous liver tissue ROI, a circular 2-cm ROI was
placed on the noncancerous liver tissue. The standardized uptake
value (SUV) was calculated by using the following formula: SUV
5 cdc/(di/w), where cdc is the decay-corrected tracer tissue
concentration (in Bq/g); di is the injected dose (in Bq); and w is
the patient’s body weight (in g). The maximal SUV in the HCC
lesion ROI and the mean SUV in the noncancerous liver tissue
ROI were calculated for each ROI. As a contrast value, the tumorto-liver (T/L) ratio was also calculated by dividing the HCC
lesions SUV by the noncancerous liver tissue SUV.
Statistical Analysis
The detection rates of HCC using 11C-choline and 18F-FDG were
compared using the paired x2 test. Differences in semiquantitative
parameters were analyzed by a Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon
signed rank test for unpaired and paired observations, respectively.
Semiquantitative data were expressed as mean 6 SD. Differences
were considered statistically significant at the level of P , 0.05.
RESULTS
A total of 10 patients had a single lesion, and the
remaining 2 patients had 3 lesions each. The histologic
grade of HCC was moderately differentiated (grade II) in
12 lesions and poorly differentiated (grade III) in 4 lesions.
Of all 16 HCC lesions, 8 were detected by 11C-choline PET
only, 6 were detected by 18F-FDG PET only, and 2 were
detected by both modalities. Figures 1–3 show typical cases
of HCC lesion detection by 11C-choline only, by 18F-FDG
only, and by both imaging techniques. Although 11C-choline
PET showed a slightly higher detection rate than did
18F-FDG PET for detection of HCC (63% vs. 50%), the difference was not statistically significant.
The mean (6SD) 11C-choline SUV was 15.23 6 5.94 and
the mean (6SD) T/L ratio was 1.46 6 0.60 in all HCC
lesions. The means (6SD) of the 18F-FDG SUV and T/L
ratio were 4.80 6 3.00 and 1.78 6 1.08, respectively, in all
HCC lesions. No significant difference was found between
the 11C-choline and 18F-FDG T/L ratios in any HCC lesions.
A total of 9 of 12 (75%) moderately differentiated lesions
could be visualized by 11C-choline PET, whereas only 5 of
12 (42%) such lesions could be detected by 18F-FDG PET.
Thus, 11C-choline PET tended to be more sensitive than did
18F-FDG PET for moderately differentiated HCC lesions,
although this difference was not statistically significant. In
contrast, only 1 of 4 (25%) poorly differentiated lesions

could be visualized by 11C-choline PET, and 3 such lesions
(75%) were detected by 18F-FDG PET. Thus, 18F-FDG PET
tended to be more sensitive than did 11C-choline PET for
poorly differentiated HCC lesions, although this difference
was also not statistically significant.
The mean (6SD) 11C-choline SUV and T/L ratio in
moderately differentiated HCC lesions (16.79 6 4.92 and
1.58 6 0.53, respectively) were higher than those in poorly
differentiated HCC lesions (10.56 6 7.01 and 1.09 6 0.72,
respectively), but the differences were not statistically
significant. In contrast, the mean (6SD) 18F-FDG SUV
and T/L ratio in poorly differentiated HCC lesions (7.25 6
5.37 and 2.61 6 1.85, respectively) were higher than those
in moderately differentiated HCC lesions (3.99 6 1.33 and
1.50 6 0.57, respectively), but the differences were not
statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
In the present study of 12 patients with HCC, 11C-choline
PET showed a slightly higher overall detection rate than did
18F-FDG PET for detection of HCC lesions (63% vs. 50%,
respectively), although this difference was not statistically
significant. In particular, for detection of moderately differentiated HCC lesions, the detection rates for 11C-choline
PET and 18F-FDG PET were 75% versus 42%, respectively.
18F-FDG PET is a useful diagnostic method for metastatic liver tumors (14). A meta-analysis found excellent
sensitivity (96%) and specificity (99%) for 18F-FDG PET in
detecting hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (15).
For HCC lesions, however, several investigators have
shown that the sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET is not sufficiently high (50%–55%) (2,3,14,16). In the present study,
the detection rate was only 50% for detection of HCC
lesions by 18F-FDG PET, which is well in agreement with
the results in previous reports (2,3,14,16). The activity of
glucose-6-phosphatase is reported to vary widely, according
to a differentiation grade of HCC: well-differentiated HCC
cells are histologically closer to the normal liver cells than
to the undifferentiated types (4,17). Thus, the abundance of
glucose-6-phosphatase may render these tumors undetectable. However, a high positive rate of 18F-FDG accumulation has been reported in undifferentiated HCC lesions (16).
Previous studies have also shown that the SUV and T/L
ratio using 18F-FDG PET are significantly higher in poorly
differentiated HCC lesions than in well-differentiated and
moderately differentiated types and, therefore, reflect the
degree of HCC differentiation (4,17). In the present study, a
similar tendency was seen with tumor grade, although no
statistical significance was detected.
The use of 11C-choline PET has been reported for the
detection of tumors in organs such as the brain and prostate,
in which 18F-FDG lacks sensitivity (5,6). However, to the
best of our knowledge, no study has reported on the use of
11C-choline PET for the evaluation of HCC lesions. The

precise uptake mechanism of 11C-choline in tumor cells is
not well known. It has been suggested that tumor cells are
characterized by their ability to incorporate choline actively to produce phosphatidylcholine, a cell membrane
constituent, to facilitate rapid cell duplication (6). When 11C-choline is incorporated in tumors, it is rapidly phosphorylated (yielding 11C-phosphorylcholine) and chemically trapped inside the cell membranes (6).
In the present study, the overall detection rate of HCC
lesions using 11C-choline PET was slightly better than that
using 18F-FDG PET. This detection rate appears to be
dependent on tumor differentiation, as demonstrated by a
higher detection rate for moderately versus poorly differentiated HCC lesions using 11C-choline PET and 18F-FDG
PET. These results suggest that the 2 tracers may complement each other in the detection of HCC lesions. Similar
findings have been reported using 18F-fluorocholine (18)
and 11C-acetate, a tracer assumed to be related to lipid
synthesis (19), in HCC lesions. To overcome the limited
utility of the 11C tracer due to its short half-life (;20 min),
18F-fluorocholine has been developed. Talbot et al. showed
that the sensitivity of 18F-fluorocholine (100%) for the
detection of HCC lesions was better than that of 18F-FDG
(55.6%) (18). A trend toward a higher 18F-fluorocholine
SUV in well-differentiated HCC lesions than in poorly
differentiated HCC lesions is demonstrated, although the
difference was not statistically significant (18). Ho et al.
reported that the overall sensitivity of 11C-acetate (87.3%)
for the detection of HCC lesions was better than that of 18FFDG (47.3%) (19). However, 11C-acetate was not sensitive
for the detection of poorly differentiated HCC lesions (19).
Furthermore, a statistically significant relationship between
tumor differentiation and T/L ratio for 18F-FDG PET and 11C-acetate PET exists (19). Ho et al. also evaluated the
sensitivity of metastatic HCC lesions with both 11C-acetate
and 18F-FDG, compared with that of 18F-FDG or 11Cacetate alone (20). In their results, dual-tracer PET/CT
showed an excellent sensitivity (98%) (18F-FDG PET/CT
had 79% and 11C-acetate PET/CT had 64%) (20). The
detection rate for HCC lesions in the present study was
slightly lower than that obtained in these previous studies
(18,19). One of the reasons for this difference may be
because of the small sample size and the construction of the
sample in the present study versus the previous studies
(18,19). The percentage of well-differentiated HCC lesions
in the previous studies was 33%–35% (18,19), although we
had no well-differentiated HCC lesions. Furthermore, because the background 18F-fluorocholine levels in the liver
parenchyma are low, areas exhibiting their accumulations
can be visualized in good contrast to other areas.
A limitation of the present study was the small size of the
sample, in which we had no well-differentiated and very
few poorly differentiated HCC lesions. This may explain
the lack of statistical significance of differences observed.
Three patients had received transcatheter arterial embolization therapy before the PET study. The detection rates of
HCC lesions were analyzed using visual, not SUV, analysis.
The value of the present data is also limited by the retrospective character of the study. Further prospective studies involving a larger number of patients are required to
determine the clinical usefulness of 11C-choline PET for
detection of HCC lesions.
CONCLUSION
11C-choline PET had a better detection rate for moderately differentiated HCC lesions but not for poorly differentiated HCC lesions, whereas 18F-FDG PET demonstrated
the opposite behavior. The use of 11C-choline as a tracer
complementary to 18F-FDG in detection of HCC lesions
seems to be a possibility.
