Abstract
Background & Aims: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) involves steatosis combined with inflammation, which can
progress into fibrosis and cirrhosis. Exploring the molecular mechanisms of NASH is highly dependent on the availability of
animal models. Currently, the most commonly used animal models for NASH imitate particularly late stages of human
disease. Thus, there is a need for an animal model that can be used for investigating the factors that potentiate the
inflammatory response within NASH. We have previously shown that 7-day high-fat-high-cholesterol (HFC) feeding induces
steatosis and inflammation in both APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice. However, it is not known whether the early inflammatory
response observed in these mice will sustain over time and lead to liver damage. We hypothesized that the inflammatory
response in both models is sufficient to induce liver damage over time.
Methods: APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice were fed a chow or HFC diet for 3 months. C57Bl6/J mice were used as control.
Results: Surprisingly, hepatic inflammation was abolished in APOE2ki mice, while it was sustained in Ldlr2/2 mice. In
addition, increased apoptosis and hepatic fibrosis was only demonstrated in Ldlr2/2 mice. Finally, bone-marrow-derivedmacrophages of Ldlr2/2 mice showed an increased inflammatory response after oxidized LDL (oxLDL) loading compared to
APOE2ki mice.
Conclusion: Ldlr2/2 mice, but not APOE2ki mice, developed sustained hepatic inflammation and liver damage upon long
term HFC feeding due to increased sensitivity for oxLDL uptake. Therefore, the Ldlr2/2 mice are a promising physiological
model particularly vulnerable for investigating the onset of hepatic inflammation in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease covers a disease spectrum
ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1].
Whereas steatosis might not adversely affect outcome, inflammation determines the long-term prognosis of this disease [2–5]. It is
still not known why some patients progress towards inflammation,
while others do not.
Exploring the molecular basis of the hepatic alterations
associated with the metabolic syndrome is highly dependent on
the availability of animal models which mimic the human
condition from the physiological and metabolic points of view
[6,7]. To date, the most commonly used animal models for NASH
imitate particularly late stages of human disease. Thus, there is a
need for animal models that can be used for investigating the
factors that potentiate the inflammatory response within NASH.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a component of the
metabolic syndrome and therefore it is frequently associated with
hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis [8]. One of the commonly used
models for atherosclerosis studies is the low density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor knock-out (Ldlr2/2) mouse. The LDL receptor
plays a major role in the clearance of apoB and apoE-containing
lipoproteins [9]. Another mouse model for atherosclerosis is the
apolipoprotein E2 knock-in (APOE2ki) mouse. In APOE2ki mice,
the murine apoe gene is replaced by the human APOE2 allele. The

APOE2 protein has a markedly reduced affinity for the LDL
receptor, leading to a plasma lipoprotein profile resembling
human type III hyperlipoproteinaemia (HLP) [10]. Previously,
we used these ‘humanized’ APOE2ki mice and Ldlr2/2 mice to
study NASH. Both hyperlipidemic mice developed early hepatic
inflammation and steatosis when fed a high-fat-high-cholesterol
(HFC) diet, whereas C57Bl6 mice only developed steatosis [11].
Unlike the lipoprotein profile in wild-type (WT) profile, in which
most cholesterol is present in the HDL fraction, the profile of the
Ldlr2/2 mouse and APOE2ki is more comparable with the human
plasma lipoprotein profile, in which cholesterol is mainly confined
to the LDL fraction [12]. Thus, when fed a HFC diet, both
APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice have the potential to be used as animal
models for investigating the factors that potentiate the inflammatory response within NASH. However, data from the literature
regarding the effect of inflammation on liver damage in
hyperlipidemic mice on NASH progression are partial and
inconclusive.
Based on the pronounced inflammatory response observed
upon short-term HFC feeding, we hypothesized that the
inflammatory response in both models will sustain over time and
will be sufficient to induce fibrosis and liver damage. To test this
hypothesis, male APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice were fed a HFC diet
for 3 months and normolipidemic C57Bl6 (WT) mice were used as
the control group. Surprisingly, although plasma and liver lipid
levels were still elevated in both hyperlipidemic models after 3
months of HFC feeding, the inflammatory response was only
sustained in the Ldlr2/2 mice. In addition, increased apoptosis and
hepatic fibrosis was only demonstrated in Ldlr2/2 mice. By
analysing the effect of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) loading on
macrophages from the different models, we showed that these
differences are most likely attributable to an increased sensitivity
for oxLDL-induced inflammation in Ldlr2/2 mice compared to
APOE2ki mice. All together, the Ldlr2/2 mice are a promising
physiological model particularly vulnerable for investigating the
onset of hepatic inflammation in the context of fatty liver disease.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The
protocol was approved by the Committee for Animal Welfare of
Maastricht University (Permit Number: 2008-060). The investigation conforms to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication No. 85–23, revised 1996).
Mice and diet
The mice were housed under standard conditions and given free
access to food and water. Twelve-week-old male C57Bl/6,
APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice (with the same genetic background,
C57Bl/6) were fed a high-fat-high-cholesterol diet (HFC) for 3
months (n = 8) containing 21% milk butter, 0.2% cholesterol, 46%
carbohydrates and 17% casein. The control groups for each
genotype were kept on a standard chow diet for the same period
(3.3% fat, 46.1% carbohydrates and 19% protein). The 7 days and
3 month experiments were carried out at the same time. The
collection of blood, sacrificing of the mice, and tissue isolation
were performed as described previously [11].
Lipid analysis
Liver and plasma lipid analysis were performed as described
previously [11].
Liver histology
Frozen liver sections (7 mm) were stained for infiltrated
macrophages (macrophage marker, Mac-1), CD68 Kupffer cells
(CD68 marker, FA11), T cells (T-cell marker, KT3), fibroblasts
(fibroblast marker, ERTR7) and neutrophils (neutrophil marker,
NIMP) as described previously [13]. TUNEL staining for
apoptosis was performed on frozen liver sections according to
the manufacturers’ protocol (In situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
Roche Applied Science). Paraffin-embedded liver sections (4 mm)
were stained with Sirius Red as described previously [13] and asmooth muscle actin (aSMA) (M0851, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Horse-anti-mouse IgG (PI-2000, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, USA) was used as secondary antibody and daminobenzidine (DAB) was applied as color substrate.
Gene expression analysis
Total RNA isolation from mouse liver tissues, cDNA synthesis
and Q-PCR analysis were performed as described previously [11].
Measuring auto-antibody titers against modified LDL
Specific antibody titers against modified LDL in plasma were
determined as described elsewhere [14,15]. Plasma was diluted
and antibody binding measured by chemiluminescent enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Measuring aminotranferases
The level of aminotransferases ALT in plasma of each
individual mouse was measured by using the Reflotron-system
and the test strips for ALT measurments (Roche Diagnostics,
Almere, The Netherlands), according to the manufacturers
instructions.
Caspase 3/7 activity in liver homogenates
To detect apoptosis in liver homogenates, Caspase-GloH 3/7
assay (#G8091, Promega, Madison, USA) was applied according
to the manufacturers instructions. An equal volume of liver
homogenate (5 mg/ml protein) was mixed with the Caspase-GloH
Reagent in 96-well, white-walled plates. The assay was incubated
for 1.5 hour at room temperature before reading on a platereading luminometer.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TNF and IL6
TNF (0.05 mg/ml protein) and IL6 (0.1 mg/ml protein) were
measured in liver homogenates by ELISA assays (CMC3013 and
CMC0063 resp., Invitrogen, Camarillo, USA), according to the
manufacturers instructions. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm
using a microtiterplate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA).
Hydroxyproline assay
Hydroxyproline content of proteins was measured after acid
hydrolysis with 6 M HCl for 5 hours. Samples were introduced
into a tandem mass spectrometer using UPLC. Amino acids were
measured in multiple reaction mode in ESI-positive mode. The
mass transition 131.75.85.9 was used for the identification of
hydroxyproline. Stable isotope-labelled asparagine was used as
internal standard.

In vitro murine macrophage culture
Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs and tibiae of
C57Bl6, APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice. The cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 (GIBCO Invitrogen, Breda, the Netherlands) with
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Bodinco B.V., Alkmaar, the
Netherlands), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 ug/ml),
and L-glutamine (2 mM) (all GIBCO Invitrogen, Breda, the
Netherlands) (R10) supplemented with 15% L929-conditioned
medium (LCM) for 8–9 days to generate bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMM), as described previously [16]. The cells were
treated for 24 h with 25 mg/ml of oxidized LDL (Intracel,
Frederick, USA). Uptake of oxLDL particles that were DiIlabelled was assessed by flow cytometry after residual oxLDL was
washed away.
Statistical analysis
The data was statistically analysed by performing two-tailed
non-paired t-tests using GraphPad Prism, version 4.03 for
Windows. Data were expressed as the mean 6SEM and
considered significant at p,0.05. *, ** and *** indicate p,0.05,

Results
After 3 months of the HFC diet, hepatic inflammation is
only sustained in Ldlr2/2 mice
To determine whether hepatic inflammation was sustained in
both Ldlr2/2 and APOE2ki mice after 3 months (long-term) of
HFC feeding, the numbers of infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils
and T cells and the gene expression levels of Tnf, Mcp-1 and Cd68
in these mice were compared with control mice fed chow and with
mice on the 7-day (short-term) HFC diet (Fig. 1). Normolipidemic
C57Bl6 mice were used as the control group. To follow the
changes in hepatic inflammation within time, we included the data
of the 7-day HFC diet (dotted bars) in the first figure, which
originates from Wouters et al [11]. These data indicated that both
Ldlr2/2 and APOE2ki mice had increased inflammation after 7
days of HFC feeding compared to mice on the chow diet and
normolipidemic C57Bl6 mice, as reflected by elevated numbers of
infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils and T cells. In control mice,
only a minor increase in the number of infiltrated cells was
observed after 7 days of HFC feeding (Fig. 1A). Gene expression
analysis for Tnf, Mcp-1 and Cd68 confirmed these findings.
Comparing 7 days and 3 months of HFC feeding demonstrated
that the inflammatory response was only sustained in Ldlr2/2
mice. In contrast, the number of infiltrated macrophages,
neutrophils and T cells was significantly reduced in APOE2ki mice
after 3 months of HFC feeding (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the
inflammatory cells were more clustered in Ldlr2/2 mice compared
to APOE2ki and C57Bl6 mice (Fig. 1B–D). In addition, the
observed differences in hepatic inflammation between the
hyperlipidemic models and between short- and long-term HFC
diets were confirmed by gene expression analysis for Tnf, Mcp-1
and Cd68, where the inflammatory response was sustained in the
Ldlr2/2 mice and abolished in the APOE2ki mice after 3 months of
the HFC diet (Fig. 1E). Hepatic TNF and IL6 protein levels were
also confirmed by ELISA (Fig. S1).
Hepatic steatosis is present in all models after 3 months
of the HFC diet
To investigate if the inflammatory response was associated with
steatosis after 3 months of the HFC diet, liver lipid levels and Oil
red O staining were performed on the livers of the three different
mouse models. In general, HFC feeding induced weight gain in all
models, but there were no significant differences between the 3
groups (Fig. S2). The liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels were
increased in all C57Bl6, APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice after HFC
feeding compared to mice on the chow diet. Furthermore, the
levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly higher in
Ldlr2/2 mice compared to C57Bl6 and APOE2ki mice on HFC
diet (Fig. 2A+B). These findings were confirmed by Oil red O
staining (Fig. 2C–E).
Only Ldlr2/2 mice have increased fibrosis and apoptosis
after 3 months of the HFC diet
One of the features of advanced stages of NASH is hepatic
fibrosis. To investigate whether the 3 mouse models differed in the
extent of fibrosis, Sirius Red, fibroblast (ERTR7) and aSMA
(activated hepatic stellate cells) staining were performed (Fig. 3A–
C). The Sirius Red and fibroblast staining demonstrated that
Ldlr2/2 mice have increased hepatic fibrosis after 3 months on the
HFC diet compared to C57Bl6 and APOE2ki mice. Likewise, the
collagen content and fibroblast presence were greater around the
portal areas in Ldlr2/2 mice (Fig. 3C). However, in APOE2ki mice,
ERTR7 staining is mainly prevalent in pericellular locations. This
is probably also the reason why we couldn’t detect a clear
difference between the hydroxyproline levels of APOE2ki and
Ldlr2/2 mice (Fig. 3D). Nevertheless, the Ldlr2/2 mice were the
only model that demonstrated a significant difference between
chow and HFC diet compared to C57Bl6 and APOE2ki mice. The
aSMA staining was mainly prevalent around the portal areas in all
3 models and only showed activated stellate cells in a few, but not
all, Ldlr2/2 mice (Fig. S3). The histological findings were
confirmed by the gene expression analysis of Tgf-b, Mmp-9,
Col1a1, Timp1 and aSma (Fig. 3E–I) and therefore we can conclude
that the Ldlr2/2 mice have more fibrosis compared to C57Bl6 and
APOE2ki mice, although fibrosis is rather mild.
Cell death by apoptosis is thought to give rise to larger regions
of liver damage. To test whether hepatic inflammation was
associated with apoptosis, liver sections were stained for apoptosis
(TUNEL staining). After 3 months of HFC feeding, Ldlr2/2 mice
had increased apoptosis compared to C57Bl6 and APOE2ki mice
(Fig. 4A+Fig. S4). These findings were confirmed by increased
levels of caspase 3/7 activity in the livers of Ldlr2/2 mice
compared to APOE2ki mice (Fig. 4B). Moreover, gene expression
analysis of the apoptotic markers Bax, Bcl-2, Traf1, Bfl1 and Chop
confirmed these findings, indicating a clear association between
the inflammatory response and apoptosis (Fig. 4C–G). However,
the presence of elevated transaminases in plasma like alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) did not differ between the different
models (Fig. 4H).
High plasma cholesterol levels and foamy Kupffer cells in
both hyperlipidemic models after 3 months of the HFC
diet
Plasma cholesterol levels were significantly increased after 3
months of HFC feeding in all three models. No differences were
observed between APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice (Fig. S5A).
Moreover, the size of foamy KCs did not differ between the
hyperlipidemic models. The KCs of these models were swollen
compared to chow and C57Bl6 mice on HFC diet (Fig. S5B).
Ldlr2/2 mice have increased hepatic expression levels of
lipid-related genes
To further investigate the effect of HFC feeding on hepatic
cholesterol metabolism, gene expression levels of the lipid-related

genes were analysed. As expected, the hepatic expression of Cd36,
Sr-a, Lpl, Abcg1, Abca1 and Pparc were all elevated in mice upon
HFC diet. In addition, Ldlr2/2 mice on the HFC diet showed
higher expression levels of these genes (except for Abca1) than
APOE2ki mice (Fig. 5).
Bone marrow-derived macrophages of Ldlr2/2 mice are
more inflammatory after oxidized LDL loading compared
to APOE2ki macrophages
We have previously shown that the level of naturally occurring
antibodies against oxLDL in the plasma correlates with hepatic
inflammation [13]. To investigate whether the differences in
hepatic inflammation between Ldlr2/2 and APOE2ki correlate
with the plasma levels of these antibodies, measurements of IgM
and IgG antibodies against oxLDL were performed. These levels
were comparable between the three different mouse models,
suggesting a similar generation of oxidation-specific epitopes (Fig.
S6A+B). Moreover, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) of
these mice were loaded with oxLDL, which leads to foam cell
formation and inflammation in vitro. Gene expression analysis of
the inflammatory gene Tnf, Il6, Mcp-1 and Cd68 after oxLDL
loading demonstrated that APOE2ki BMM have a lower
expression compared to C57Bl6 and Ldlr2/2 BMM. Additionally,
the two main scavenger receptors responsible for the uptake of
modified lipids, Cd36 and Sr-a, showed increased expression in
Ldlr2/2 compared to APOE2ki (Fig. 6A). The percentage of
positive BMM and the positivity of BMM were increased upon
oxLDL loading compared to basal levels, but were not different
between the groups (Fig. 6B–C). In conclusion, although the
uptake of oxLDL was the same between the different models,
BMM of APOE2ki mice were less inflammatory compared to
C57Bl6 and Ldlr2/2 mice.
Discussion
The present study illustrates that the Ldlr2/2 mice are a
promising long term NASH model, while in contrast to our
expectations, APOE2ki mice are not. The HFC diet led to
sustained hepatic inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis in Ldlr2/2
mice, but not in APOE2ki mice. This difference was most likely a

consequence of the increased sensitivity for oxLDL-induced
inflammation in Ldlr2/2 mice compared to APOE2ki mice. These
novel observations indicate that hyperlipidemia and steatosis are
not sufficient for maintaining the inflammatory response in the
liver. In addition, our data demonstrate that the Ldlr2/2 mouse
model can be used as an excellent physiological model particularly
vulnerable for investigating hepatic inflammation in the context of
fatty liver disease.
Lack of a suitable animal model that faithfully recapitulates the
pathophysiology of human NASH is a major obstacle in delineating
mechanisms responsible for the progression of steatosis to NASH.
The best characterized and most widely used genetic model for
NASH is the leptin-deficient mouse (ob/ob). The ob/ob mice
develop hepatic steatosis but not hepatic inflammation or fibrosis,
possibly due to the loss of normal leptin signalling [17]. Therefore,
these ob/ob mice need a pro-injurious stimulus, such as an
endotoxin (LPS) [18]. The most well-known nutritional model for
NASH is a diet deficient in methionine and choline (MCD). These
mouse models display all of the hallmarks of NASH, from steatosis
to inflammation and fibrosis development [19]. However, mice fed
an MCD-deficient diet tend to lose weight and display lowered
plasma TG levels and are therefore very different from NASH in
human metabolic syndrome or diabetes patients who are mostly
obese and/or hyperlipidemic [6]. Therefore, the currently available
genetic and nutritional models are especially useful to investigate
late stages of NASH but have some limitations restricting their use
to serve as a physiological model to study the development of
hepatic inflammation in the context of NASH [6],[8].
Based on the analogy between the mechanisms of NASH and
atherosclerosis, an emerging trend in NASH research is to utilize
the mouse models traditionally targeted for studies of atherosclerosis, including APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice. The APOE2ki mouse,
a humanized mouse model of hyperlipidemia, has outstanding
potential as it is highly responsive to dietary factors and
pharmacological interventions [20]. As these mice are not
commonly used, the effect of feeding a long-term HFC diet on
the liver of APOE2ki mice had so far not been investigated. In
contrast, several studies have been performed to determine the
consequences of a long-term HFC diet on Ldlr2/2 mice. The
Ldlr2/2 mice are mildly hypercholesterolemic due to the absence
of LDL receptors, which prolongs the plasma half-life of VLDL
and LDL [21]. These mice were utilized by Kong et al., who
revealed that 5 months of HFC feeding in male Ldlr2/2 mice
induced macrovesicular steatosis, but not inflammatory cell
infiltration [22]. In contrast, Yoshimatsu et al. demonstrated that
3 months of HFC feeding of female Ldlr2/2 mice resulted in
steatosis, infiltration of neutrophils into the liver and increased
serum aminotransferases (ALT) levels. However, the diet was
highly enriched with cholesterol (1.25%) and cholic acid (0.5%),
and the latter is a primary bile acid that is known to cause hepatic
toxicity. In addition, the effect on hepatic fibrosis was not
investigated [23]. Finally, Gupte et al. demonstrated that middleaged (12-month-old) male Ldlr2/2 mice fed an HFC diet for 3
months developed steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress
and elevated liver injury markers [24]. However, the authors
concluded that the advanced age of these mice exacerbated the

HFC-induced fibrosis [25]. Thus, the current data regarding the
effect of a long-term HFC diet on NASH progression in
hyperlipidemic mice is partial and inconclusive. Besides, elevated
liver enzymes such as ALT in the blood usually suggest liver
damage, however, there is not always a correlation between these
liver enzymes and NAFLD or NASH [26]. By using young mice
with a physiological diet, we proved for the first time that the
Ldlr2/2 mice are a promising model for investigating the onset of
hepatic inflammation in NASH and can be a valuable tool for
conducting interventional studies; these findings should eventually
lead to a better understanding of human NASH and the
development of an efficient therapy for this condition.
Studies in apoE2/2 mice show that ApoE influences several
inflammatory processes due to the fact that it is produced by a
wide variety of cell types, including macrophages [27–30].
However, our data suggest that the APOE2 isoform is not directly
involved in inflammation as the inflammatory response was not
sustained in the APOE2ki mice. Unlike APOE2ki mice, apoE2/2
mice have been extensively used as models for atherosclerosis. It
was shown that the mean cross-sectional area of the plaque in the
APOE2ki mice is approximately half that seen in age-matched
apoE2/2 mice with a similar genetic background and the plaques
of the APOE2ki mice are less mature [31–33]. Moreover, it was
also demonstrated that apoE has allele-specific effects in protecting
cells from oxidative cell death, with E2 the most effective one [34].
In addition, the circulation time of atherogenic particles is also
reduced in APOE2ki mice compared to apoE2/2 mice , which can
result in an decreased inflammatory response in the body [35,36].
Altogether, these evidences suggest that APOE2ki mice are less
inflammatory compared to the apoE2/2 mice.
Where Ldlr2/2 mice require an atherogenic diet to develop
atherosclerosis, APOE2ki mice spontaneously develop the full
spectrum of atherosclerotic lesions, even on a regular chow diet.
Moreover, an atherogenic diet, high in fat and cholesterol, further
exacerbates the development of atherosclerosis and xanthomas in
these APOE2ki mice. However, it was shown that the lesions in
these APOE2ki mice mainly consisted of foam cells and had
relatively fewer fibrous caps, cholesterol clefts and necrotic cores
[10]. Thus, in line with our observations, it is likely that the foamy
macrophages from the atherosclerotic plaques of APOE2ki mice
are less inflammatory compared to those in Ldlr2/2 mice.
Currently, APOE2ki mice are still accepted as an established
model for atherosclerosis. Altogether, based on our data and data
from the literature, this paradigm should be re-evaluated.
Although hepatic inflammation was completely abolished in
APOE2ki mice after 3 months of HFC feeding, plasma and liver
lipid levels were still elevated. Previously, we reported that elevated
plasma cholesterol levels can trigger hepatic inflammation [11]. In
addition, omitting cholesterol from the diet even resulted in a
dramatic inhibition of hepatic inflammation, without affecting the
levels of steatosis. In line with these findings about steatosis, recent
reports have also raised doubts about steatosis as a precondition
for the development of inflammation during NASH progression
[37,38] [39]. In the present study, neither plasma cholesterol,
steatosis, nor anti-oxLDL antibodies were correlated with hepatic
inflammation. These observations suggest that the differences in
inflammation are not related to systemic difference in lipids and
oxidation, but rather to differences in the activity of intracellular
inflammatory pathways. In line with this hypothesis, KCs from
both hyperlipidemic models still had a foamy appearance after 3
months of HFC diet. Moreover, BMM of Ldlr2/2 mice showed
increased expression of Il-6 and Cd36 compared to macrophages
from APOE2ki and C57Bl6 mice after oxidized LDL loading.
Relevantly, IL-6 was shown to dictate the transition from acute to

chronic inflammation by changing the nature of leukocyte
infiltration (from polymorphonuclear neutrophils to monocyte/
macrophages). In addition, IL-6 exerts stimulatory effects on T- and
B-cells, thus favoring chronic inflammatory responses [40]. Thus,
these data suggest that, unlike macrophages from APOE2ki and
C57Bl6 mice, macrophages of Ldlr2/2 mice produce higher levels of
IL-6 and therefore are more prone to develop chronic inflammation.
Relevantly, IL6 is also increased in serum of patients with NAFLD
and is linked with insulin resistance [41]. Gene expression of Cd36,
the main scavenger receptor responsible for the uptake of oxidized
cholesterol and involved in inflammatory signal transduction, was
also higher in BMM of Ldlr2/2 mice after oxLDL loading compared
to APOE2ki and C57Bl6 mice. Interestingly, oxLDL up-regulates
CD36 expression via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR) c, and this may initiate a feed forward loop of CD36
expression that amplifies the inflammatory response [42]. In support
of this view, the expression levels of several target genes for PPARc
(ABCG1, LPL, CD36) were also reduced in the livers of APOE2ki
mice compared to Ldlr2/2 mice. Thus, it is possible that this loop
mechanism does not occur in APOE2ki mice and therefore these
mice are less sensitive to the inflammatory cascade.
So far, there is no suitable physiological model for studying
the hepatic inflammation in a metabolic context that faithfully
recapitulates the pathophysiology of human NASH. In this
study, the hepatic inflammatory response induced by prolonged
HFC feeding in APOE2ki and Ldlr2/2 mice was investigated.
We demonstrated that Ldlr2/2 mice have increased sensitivity
for oxLDL-induced inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis
compared to APOE2ki mice. Therefore, the Ldlr2/2 mouse
model is particularly useful for understanding the relationships
between lipid metabolism and inflammatory recruitment in the
context of NASH. This model may therefore be an excellent
platform for the assessment of therapeutic strategies for hepatic
inflammation.
