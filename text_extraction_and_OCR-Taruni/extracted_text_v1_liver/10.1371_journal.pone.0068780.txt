Abstract
Objective: To develop a simple predictive model for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) using the
routine hematological parameters of a complete blood count.
Methods: A total of 458 eligible CHB patients who had undergone a liver biopsy were randomly divided into two cohorts:
an estimation group (n = 310) and a validation group (n = 148). Liver histology was assessed according to the Metavir
scoring scheme. All common demographics, hematological parameters, HBeAg status, HBV DNA, and liver biochemistry
were analyzed.
Results: Based on routinely available clinical parameters (age, sex, HBeAg status, HBV DNA, common hematological
parameters of a complete blood cell count), a model for predicting significant fibrosis (Metavir score $2) in the estimation
group was derived using platelets and red cell distribution width (RDW), and another model for predicting cirrhosis (Metavir
score = 4) was derived using platelets, RDW and hemoglobin. A novel index, the RDW to platelet ratio (RPR), was developed
to amplify the opposing effects of liver fibrosis on the RDW and platelets. The AUCs of the RPR for predicting significant
fibrosis and cirrhosis were 0.825 and 0.884, respectively, which is superior to the AAR, FIB-4 and APRI in the estimation
group. Compared with the two derived models, the RPR has a comparable predictive power for significant fibrosis and
cirrhosis. Using optimized cutoffs (0.10 and 0.16), the RPR accurately predicted 63.1% of cases with significant fibrosis and
73.7% of cases with cirrhosis and accurately excluded 85.5% of the cases with mild fibrosis and 93.0% of the cases with no
cirrhosis.
Conclusion: The RPR, a routinely available, inexpensive and easily calculated index, can predict significant fibrosis and
cirrhosis in CHB patients with relatively high accuracy. The application of this index may reduce the need for liver biopsy in
CHB patients.

Introduction
Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are major causes of morbidity and
mortality in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Although
antiviral therapy has greatly reduced the risk of fibrosis and
cirrhosis, some patients may eventually develop advanced
fibrosis and cirrhosis. Knowledge of the stages of liver fibrosis
is essential in patients with viral hepatitis B to assess the
progression and prognosis of the disease, particularly when
determining whether to use antiviral treatment [1,2]. Currently,
liver biopsy remains the gold standard for assessing the
histological outcomes of liver disease [3]. However, this
procedure is costly and carries a small risk of complications
due to sampling error and invasiveness [4]. Thus, non-invasive,
economical and simple methods to assess the severity of hepatic
fibrosis are considered to be attractive.
Several non-invasive methods using laboratory tests, scores and
indices to predict hepatic fibrosis have been proposed over the past
decade, such as the FibroTest and Fibroindex, AST/ALT ratio,
APRI and FIB-4 [5,6,7,8,9]. However, these methods were based
on patients with hepatitis C and might produce conflicting results
in the prediction of liver fibrosis among CHB patients. Recently,
several models based on CHB patients have been reported, but
they are somewhat difficult to use in clinical practice because these
models utilize less common biochemical markers or require the use
of a special computer program to perform the calculations [10,11].
Moreover, the accuracy and reliability of these assays are not very
satisfactory in predicting liver fibrosis. Thus, additional studies are
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68780

necessary to identify a simple, accurate and routinely available
method.
The complete blood count (CBC) is one of the most frequently
ordered laboratory tests in clinical practice. Standard CBC tests
include white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC) and platelet
counts as well as their morphological indices. Various studies have
evaluated the performance of these hematological CBC parameters to predict disease severity and mortality risk. For example,
the circulating platelet count has been proposed as a biomarker of
liver fibrosis and cirrhosis [12]. An elevated red cell distribution
width (RDW) has been reported to be associated with mortality
and other severe adverse outcomes in cardiac, renal and infectious
diseases, even in the general population [13,14,15,16]. Other
studies have found an association between low hemoglobin (Hb)
concentrations and mortality [17]. Despite these correlations, few
studies have evaluated the association between these parameters
and the histological outcomes of liver disease in patients with
CHB. Given the relative ease and low cost of measuring these
indices and their close association with disease progression and
prognosis, we attempted to develop a simple clinical approach
using these measurements to predict the liver fibrosis stages in
patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Materials and Methods
Patients and Laboratory Assessment
Our cohort comprised 603 patients with CHB who underwent
liver biopsy to assess the degree of liver fibrosis and necroinflammation at the First Affiliated Hospital of the School of
Medicine from Feb 2008 to Jan 2012. CHB is diagnosed when
serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is positive for more than
6 months and when persistent or intermittent elevations in ALT/
AST levels and symptoms or signs of hepatitis or histological
changes are present [18]. For all subjects, demographic, clinical
and laboratory data were collected. All laboratory variables were
obtained within 7 days of the liver biopsy.
In this study, the exclusion criteria included co-infection with
HCV, hepatitis D virus, hepatitis G virus and/or human
immunodeficiency virus, other autoimmune liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation and metabolic liver
disease. Patients who received antiviral or anticoagulant treatment
6 months before admission were also excluded. The final subjects
were randomly divided according to a computer-generated
randomization schedule into an estimation group (approximately
two thirds of the subjects) and a validation group (approximately
one third of the subjects). All subjects gave written informed
consent for the liver biopsy. The Ethics Committee of the First
Affiliated Hospital of the Medical School of Zhejiang University,
Hangzhou, China, approved the consent procedure and the study.
Histological Assessment of the Liver
Liver biopsy was performed using a fully automatic biopsy
needle (18G BioPinceTM, InterV-MDTech, Gainesville, Florida)
under ultrasound guidance. A minimum of 1.5 cm of liver tissue
with at least five portal tracts was required for diagnosis. The
specimens were obtained using H&E and Masson’s trichrome
stains on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue. All
histological specimens from the eligible patients were reviewed
by a pathologist, who was blind to the patient characteristics,
according to the Metavir scoring scheme [19]. When the
diagnostic results were not consistent with the previous results,
another pathologist was invited to make a further assessment.
Fibrosis was scored on a 5-point scale: F0 (no fibrosis), F1 (portal
fibrosis without septa), F2 (portal fibrosis with rare septa), F3
(portal fibrosis with many septa), and F4 (cirrhosis). Significant
fibrosis was considered to be a fibrosis score of 2 or more (F2, F3
and F4), advanced fibrosis was defined as a fibrosis score of 3 or
more(F3 and F4) and cirrhosis was defined as a fibrosis score of 4
(F4).
Non-invasive Prediction Methods and Calculation
Formulae
The non-invasive prediction methods used in our study included
the AST-to-ALT ratio (AAR), AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI)
and FIB-4. The calculation formulae were as follows:
AAR~ AST

Statistical Analyses
The data analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0
software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). All continuous
variables were analyzed for the normality of distribution after
logarithmic transformation. Differences between the estimation
and validation groups were tested using Student’s t-test for
continuous variables and the X2 -test for categorical variables.
Correlations were evaluated by the Spearman correlation coefficient. Hematological parameters were presented as the quartile
ranks for the univariate and multivariate analyses to select
independent predictors. Binary logistic regression analyses were
used to develop the predictive models of significant fibrosis and
cirrhosis. Probabilities generated from the predictive models were
recorded and used as new input variables for the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The accuracy of
the models and RDW-platelet ratio (RPR) was evaluated by
constructing ROC curves. Differences between the AUCs were
tested using the z-test. The probability cut-off points for the
optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity were determined
by the Youden index. The predictive models and RPR were
validated by the standard diagnostic analysis of sensitivity,
specificity and positive and negative predictive values. All p-values
were 2-sided, and values ,0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
Study Population
A total of 603 patients with CHB who had undergone a
percutaneous liver biopsy were enrolled in the study. Overall, 30
patients were excluded due to insufficient data, and 115 were
excluded because of hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplants,
other liver diseases and medicine usage. The final study cohort,
consisting of 458 subjects, was divided into two groups: an
estimation group containing 310 patients and a validation group
containing 148 patients. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1. All variables were
comparable between the estimation and validation groups.
Predictors and Regression Models
In the univariate analysis, an increased odds ratio (OR) of
significant fibrosis was associated with age (OR = 1.04, p,0.001)
and the fourth (vs. first) quartiles (Qs) of hemoglobin (OR = 1.79,
p,0.001), RDW (OR = 2.18, p,0.001) and platelet count
(OR = 2.75, p,0.001). Similarly, an increased OR of
cirrhosis was found for hemoglobin (OR = 3.43, p,0.001), RDW
Predicting Fibrosis in Chronic Hepatitis B
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68780

(OR = 3.85, p,0.001) and platelet count (OR = 3.74, p,0.001).
These significant variables were selected for a multivariate
analysis. In the multivariate analysis, only RDW and platelets
remained as independent predictors of significant fibrosis, and
hemoglobin, RDW and platelets were retained as independent
predictors of cirrhosis (Table 2). Finally, based on these
independent predictors, two regression models were derived to
predict significant fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively. The models
are as follows:
Regression model for the prediction of significant fibrosis:
Model 1 : p~ 1
1ze{ {ð Þ 1:817z0:357|RDW{0:025|PLT
Regression model for the prediction of cirrhosis:
Mdel 2 : p~ 1
1ze{ {ð Þ 3:471z0:181|RDW{0:023|PLT{0:045|Hb
A Novel Index Consisted of RDW and Platelets for
Predicting Liver Fibrosis
The associations of hemoglobin, RDW and platelets with
histological outcomes were further analyzed. Among these
significant independent predictors, RDW was positively correlated
with significant fibrosis and cirrhosis, whereas platelets and
hemoglobin were negatively correlated with significant fibrosis
and cirrhosis. Figure 1 shows that the severity of liver fibrosis was
correlated significantly with a gradual increase in the RDW (Fig. 1
A) and with a decrease in hemoglobin and platelets (Fig. 1 B, C).
Compared with hemoglobin (r = 20.38), a decreased platelet
count (r= 20.52) was more closely associated with the stage of
fibrosis. Thus, RDW and platelets were the most powerful risk
predictive factors of liver fibrosis. Because an overlap existed in the
different stages of fibrosis, we devised the RDW to platelet ratio
(RPR) to amplify the difference in the RDW and platelets among
patients with different fibrosis stages.

Consequently, the RPR was significantly related to the stage of
fibrosis, with a higher correlation coefficient than the RDW or
platelets alone (r = 0.58) (Fig. 1 D).
Accuracy of the RPR, Model 1, Model 2, AAR, FIB-4 and
APRI in Predicting Liver Fibrosis and Cirrhosis in the
Estimation Group
An ROC curve analysis was applied to estimate the predictive
values of the RPR, Model 1 and Model 2 in the estimation group.
Meanwhile, the RPR was compared to three pre-existing noninvasive indexes including the AAR, APRI and FIB-4. The AUCs
of all six models for predicting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis in
the estimation group are shown in Figures 2 A and B. The AUCs
of the RPR, APRI, AAR, FIB-4 and Model 1 were 0.825, 0.740,
0.586, 0.795 and 0.826, respectively, in the prediction of
significant fibrosis. The AUCs of the RPR, APRI, AAR, FIB-4
and Model 2 were 0.884, 0.849, 0.734, 0.857 and 0.892,
respectively, in the prediction of cirrhosis. The RPR exhibited a
significantly higher AUC in the prediction of significant fibrosis
compared to the APRI and AAR (p,0.05) and in the prediction of
cirrhosis compared to the AAR (p,0.05). No significant difference
was observed between the RPR, FIB-4 and Model 1 in the
prediction of significant fibrosis (p.0.05) or between the RPR,
APRI, FIB-4 and Model 2 in the prediction of cirrhosis (p.0.05).
Validation and Comparison of RPR, Model 1, Model 2,
AAR, FIB-4 and APRI in Predicting Liver Fibrosis and
Cirrhosis in the Validation Patients
The diagnostic performance of the models, RPR, AAR, FIB-4
and APRI was assessed using data from the validation group. The
sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive
predictive value of all six models, using the various cutoffs
suggested for each model, are shown in Table 3. Among the 83
patients without significant fibrosis, 71 (85.5%) had an RPR score
less than the optimal cutoff of 0.1, and only 55 (66.3%) had an
APRI score less than the cutoff of 0.5, suggesting that the patients
who did not have significant fibrosis were classified correctly and
that liver biopsies could thus be avoided. Among the 108 patients
without advanced fibrosis, 79 (73.1%) had an FIB-4 score less than
the cutoff of 1.45. Among the 40 patients with advanced fibrosis,
10 (25.0%) had an FIB-4 score greater than the cutoff of 3.25. For
the 65 patients with significant fibrosis, 41 (63.1%) had an RPR
score greater than the optimal cutoff of 0.1, and 49 (75.4%) had an
APRI score greater than the cutoff of 1.5. Similarly, among the
129 patients without cirrhosis, 120 (93.0%) had an RPR score less
than the optimal cutoff of 0.16, 121 (93.8%) had an APRI score
less than the cutoff of 2.0, and 124 (96.1%) had an AAR score less
than the cutoff of 1.0. For the 19 patients with cirrhosis, 14
(73.7%) had an RPR score greater than the optimal cutoff of 0.16,
12 (61.4%) had an APRI score greater than the cutoff of 2.0, and
13 (68.4%) had an AAR score greater than the cutoff of 1.0, thus
suggesting that these patients should have been considered for
more stringent monitoring and management.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to develop a simple, inexpensive and
routine approach to predict significant fibrosis and cirrhosis using
easily available hematological CBC parameters. Although the
search for new biomarkers is quite active, information on the
stages of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B is
available from routine hematologic tests, such as the complete
blood count. Anemia (low hemoglobin) has been long known to be
associated with an increased risk of mortality, and hemolytic
anemia is commonly present in chronic liver disease, particularly

cirrhosis [22,23]. Thrombocytopenia has also been a well-known
predictor of severe liver fibrosis. The platelet count has been used
in the most predictive models for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The
RDW, an indicator of the variability of the circulating RBC size, is
often used to diagnose different types of anemia. Recent studies
have reported that a higher RDW is associated with a higher
mortality risk in various patient populations. A prospective study
by Kushang V. Patel l et al showed that the RDW was a strong
predictor of mortality in middle-aged and older adults [14].
Another study by Lou et al reported that increased RDW values
were associated with disease severity in patients with hepatitis B
[24]. Consistent with these correlations, we found that 3
hematologic CBC parameters–hemoglobin, RDW and platelets–
were independent predictors of the liver fibrosis stage in patients
with chronic hepatic B. In addition, our findings indicated that the
other parameters were not predictive risk factors for liver fibrosis.
In contrast, a previous study concluded that WBCs and their
subtypes were associated with histological severity in patients with
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [25]. Two other retrospective
studies revealed that the mean platelet volume (MPV) was
increased in chronic hepatitis C patients with advanced fibrosis
[26,27]. These inconsistencies could result from the different study
populations, which had liver disease caused by different pathogenic factors. Although increasing evidence highlights the prognostic value of individual CBC parameters [28,29], to our
knowledge, our study is the first to report the relationship between
RDW and the stage of liver fibrosis. Moreover, few studies have
combined the RDW and platelet count, the two strongest
predictors, to identify CHB patients with significant fibrosis or
cirrhosis. Our study addressed this gap and found that the RDW
and the RDW to platelet ratio in particular could predict the risk
of significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
The RPR and regression models based on CBC parameters all
exhibited excellent performance in the prediction of significant
fibrosis and cirrhosis. The RPR index obtained an AUC of 0.825
in the prediction of significant fibrosis. The AUC improved to
0.884 in the prediction of cirrhosis. The sensitivity and specificity
of the RPR (63.1% and 85.5.0%, respectively, for significant
fibrosis and 73.7% and 93.0%, respectively, for cirrhosis) were
both high at the optimal cutoffs. The two regression models, which
required more variables and complicated calculations, obtained
higher AUCs than the RPR but did not significantly improve the
predictive ability of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. Compared
with the APRI and FIB-4, the RPR is a more powerful predictive
index of significant fibrosis but is equally powerful in the
prediction of cirrhosis. The AAR has no advantage in predicting
significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. The APRI was initially created
based on patients with chronic hepatitis C. Although the APRI is a
promising tool for predicting hepatic fibrosis and includes only 2
inexpensive laboratory tests that are performed routinely in all
patients, a meta-analysis demonstrated that the APRI was not an
appropriate choice to identify hepatitis B-related fibrosis in CHB
patients [30]. Moreover, the appropriate definition of the upper
limit of normal (ULN) of the AST level remains uncertain because
each laboratory uses a different ULN value. Other models, such as
the FIB-4, FibroTest-ActiTest and FibroScan (all based on chronic
hepatitis C patients), were applicable to patients with CHB in
some investigations but were limited by the requirement of
complicated calculations or expensive instruments [31,32,33,34].
In addition, two scoring systems, constructed by Hui AY and Zeng
MD, respectively, were based on CHB patients but were applied to
special populations: patients with an HBV-DNA level .105
copies/ml and patients who were HBeAg positive, respectively
[10,11]. Most recently, Wai-Kay Seto and colleagues introduced a
new model, the PAPAS index, which still requires cumbersome
calculations [35]. Altogether, compared with the current predictive models, the RPR requires only 2 common CBC parameters
and is the simplest, cheapest and most easily calculated noninvasive method with a relatively high accuracy.
The development of liver fibrosis is considered to be a complex
trait. The role of platelets in the progression of fibrosis is not well
understood. Recent findings have revealed a potentially beneficial
role of platelets, in which they have been found to alleviate liver
fibrosis through the decreased expression of the principal
profibrogenic cytokine TGF-b and the increased expression of
matrix metalloproteinases [36]. Nevertheless, a negative correlation exists between liver fibrosis progression and platelets. Platelets
contribute to the inflammatory reaction after liver injury [37].
Platelets thus appear to have a dual role in liver fibrogenesis and
regeneration [38,39]. Additionally, the mechanism underlying the
association between the RDW and the stage of liver fibrosis in
CHB patients is unclear. A prospective, multicenter study
suggested that an elevated RDW might indicate inflammatory
stress and impaired iron mobilization [40]. Indeed, inflammation
and iron overload play key roles in mediating the processes
associated with hepatic fibrosis [41]. Richard G Ruddell et al
demonstrated a role for ferritin, an indicator of body iron stores, in
regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines associated
with hepatic fibrogenesis [42]. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines may increase the heterogeneity of erythrocyte maturation
and impairment, characterized by an elevated RDW.
The present study had several limitations. The patients were
retrospectively enrolled, and not all were treatment-naive CHB
patients. However, CHB patients who had recently received
antiviral and anticoagulant treatments were excluded to avoid
drug interference in the measurement of hematological parameters. In addition, laboratory results were collected within one week
of the liver biopsy, which could lead to a measurement bias; thus,
we used the set of results that was recorded closest to the time of
the biopsy. In addition, the HBV genotypes of the patients were
not assessed due to the absence of available data. Although
genotype C HBV has been shown to be related to more active liver
disease than genotype B HBV in Asian patients [43], the
determination of the HBV genotype is not a routine clinical test.
Finally, this study involved a single center, such that the small
proportion of patients with significant fibrosis and/or cirrhosis
may have posed a selection bias in this study. Therefore, the
predictive performance of the RPR should be further confirmed in
multi-center, prospectively designed studies.
In conclusion, the present study provided important insights
into the progression and prognosis of chronic hepatitis B using a
complete blood cell count. Two common hematological parameters, the RDW and platelet count, provided the greatest
predictive value of liver fibrosis. The RPR, an inexpensive and
easily calculated index, can predict significant fibrosis and cirrhosis
in CHB patients with relatively high accuracy, potentially reducing
unnecessary liver biopsies. Further studies are needed to validate
this index and compare it with other non-invasive methods of liver
fibrosis in CHB patients.
