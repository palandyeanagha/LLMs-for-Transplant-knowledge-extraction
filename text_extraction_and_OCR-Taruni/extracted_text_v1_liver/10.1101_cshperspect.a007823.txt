Clinical islet transplantation has progressed considerably over the past 12 years, and .750
patients with type 1 diabetes have received islet transplants internationally over this time.
Many countries are beginning to accept the transition from research to accepted and funded
clinical care, especially for patients with brittle control that cannot be stabilized by more
conventional means. Major challenges remain, including the need for more than one donor,
and the requirement for potent, chronic immunosuppression. Combining immunological
tolerance both to allo- and autoantigens, and a limitless expandable source of stem cell- or
xenograft-derived insulin-secreting cells represent remaining hurdles in moving this effective
treatment to a potential cure for all those with type 1 or 2 diabetes.
The transplantation of islets of Langerhans,
procured from a deceased donor, has become a promising treatment for type 1 diabetes
mellitus (T1DM). Currently, C-peptide negative patients are considered for this procedure
if they display severe glycemic lability, recurrent
hypoglycemic episodes, and a reduced ability to
detect the symptoms of hypoglycemia. It is estimated that patients with T1DM experience 1.3
severe hypoglycemic episodes per year, with 5%
of patients accounting for 54% of these episodes
(Pedersen-Bjergaard et al. 2004). It is these patients that benefit most from islet transplantation and in whom chronic immunosuppression
can be justified. The indications are expanding, with microvascular and even macrovascular
complications improving after transplantation
(Warnock et al. 2008; Thompson et al. 2011).
In brief, islet transplantation involves the
procurement of a donor pancreas with subsequent digestion and separation of the exocrine
tissue and stroma from the islets. This is performed using enzyme degradation and density
centrifugation. Isolated islets are assessed for
quantity and quality (Fig. 1). Islet preparations
that contain an adequate number of islets (5000
islet equivalents [IEQ] per kilogram based on
recipient weight) are then transplanted into a
diabetic recipient. The majority of transplants
involve percutaneous cannulation of a branch
of the portal vein with subsequent gravity infusion of the islet preparation (Fig. 2). Recipients
are placed on immunosuppression and other
medications designed to enhance islet engraftment and survival.
The first attempt at islet transplantation occurred in 1893 when Watson-Williams and Harsant transplanted minced sheep’s pancreas into
the subcutaneous tissue of a young boy with
ketoacidosis (Williams 1894). The discovery of

insulin reduced interest in transplantation as a
treatment for diabetes, but was renewed in 1972
when Drs. Ballinger and Lacy demonstrated a
method for isolating intact islets of Langerhans
from rodents with subsequent in vivo function
after transplantation in a rodent diabetes model
(Ballinger and Lacy 1972). Nearly 20 years later,
Scharp et al. (1990) achieved the first case of
clinical insulin independence, which lasted
nearly 1 month. This achievement was possible
owing to advances in islet isolation and purification including the development of the Ricordi
chamber by Dr. Camillo Ricordi in 1989 (Ricordi et al. 1989). Further advances and experimentation culminated in the publication of
the Edmonton Protocol in 2000 (Shapiro et al.
2000). In this series of seven patients with T1DM
receiving islets from multiple (2–4) donors,
100% of recipients achieved insulin independence. This study heightened the interest in islet
transplantation and proposed the use of a steroid-free immunosuppression protocol, the
transplantation of a larger islet mass (.11,000
IEQ/kg recipient weight) and the avoidance of
islet culture before transplantation. Although islets are now routinely cultured, steroids continue
to be avoided in posttransplant immunosuppression regimens. The use of multiple donors,
while enabling the transplantation of a large islet
mass, limits the number of patients that can receive grafts. Current data on the outcomes of
islet transplantation show insulin-independence
rates to be .27% at 2 yr posttransplant (Investigators 2009). The Edmonton group and others
have observed an inexorable decline in insulin
independence out to 8 yr posttransplant, but
with persistent C-peptide secretion and complete protection from hypoglycemic reactions
in .70% of recipients (Fig. 3). This is through
the use of multiple islet donors. Even more recent data hints at 3-yr insulin-independence
rates nearing 50%.
A major international trial was initiated by
the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) both to
replicate Edmonton’s success, and to set up a
series of clinical sites for future trials in tolerance and islet transplantation. The major findings of that trial were that insulin independence
was indeed attainable at multiple sites where a
common islet isolation and clinical immunosuppressive protocol was applied, but variance
in success between sites reflected site-specific
experience both with the complex preparation
of human islets for transplantation, and clinical
experience in the routine management of immunosuppressive therapies, especially around
dosing of sirolimus (SRL) (Shapiro et al. 2003,
2006). Enabling lower islet masses from single
donors to achieve insulin independence is one
of the current goals in islet transplantation and
would allow transplantation of a wider group of
recipients and advance islet transplantation as
the “treatment for all” in diabetes. In addition,
the achievement of longer-term insulin independence is highly sought. Although independence

out to 10 yr is possible (Berney et al. 2009) this is
certainly not standard. The focus of this work is
to review the advances in islet transplantation
that have made the current results possible and
to look ahead at some of the future advances
aimed at achieving these goals.
SINGLE-DONOR ISLET TRANSPLANTATION
Although the majority of islet transplant recipients receive islets from multiple donors (average 2 –3), this limits the number of transplants
that can occur. The success of the Edmonton
Protocol can be attributed, in part, to the transplantation of a large islet mass (.11,000 IEQ/
kg) (Shapiro et al. 2000). There are numerous
factors in the pre- and posttransplant period
that contribute to islet loss. Up to 60% of the
islet mass can be lost in the first few days following islet infusion (Biarnes et al. 2002). The use
of a larger islet mass over multiple islet infusions
leads to a larger mass of surviving b cells and a
higher likelihood of insulin independence.
However, donor limitations reduce the number
of patients that can be treated.
Achieving posttransplant islet function and
even insulin independence with single donors
would help to transition islet transplantation
from therapy for few to a cure for all with
T1DM. It would also avoid exposing the recipient to polyhuman leukocyte-associated (HLA)
antigens that may preclude future transplants
for the recipient. Single-donor islet transplant
success has been achieved in certain centers,
most notably at the University of Minnesota
(Hering et al. 2004, 2005) and University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF) (Posselt et al.
2010a,b). However, this is not a universal phenomenon. The University of Alberta, one of the
most active islet transplant centers worldwide
with .300 intraportal islet infusions in .150
subjects over the past 12 years, despite making
progress in long-term outcomes does not routinely achieve single-donor islet engraftment—
in fact, this is a rare occurrence in only 10% –
15% of cases in Edmonton’s hands. Exactly
which factors account for center differences in
single-donor islet transplant success is difficult
to define with precision, especially in the absence of common predictive potency assays for
comparison. Important differences between
Edmonton’s single-donor experience and that
of selected centers in the United States likely
reflect two dominant factors: (1) Edmonton is
relatively nonselective in which pancreas organs
are processed for islet transplantation, the philosophy being to maximize utility of any organ
not used for whole pancreas transplantation in
Canada; and (2) real differences in organ donor
parameters between Canada and the United
States—in Canada it is exceedingly rare to
have access to young donors with high body
mass index (BMI), donors which are more favored in the United States islet transplant centers as they yield superior numbers of islets of
increased potency. Differences in the funding
mechanism further polarize this, as scarce research dollars must cover the costs of all islet
isolations in the United States (pancreas procurement fees of up to $35,000 and islet processing fees of up to $40,000), whereas in Canada there are no procurement fees, and the costs
of islet processing are covered by the public
healthcare system. Furthermore, the cold ischemic time for transfer of a pancreas from donor
explant to processing in the islet center tends to
be much longer in Canada than in the United
States, because islet processing is centralized in
Edmonton and in Vancouver, often with cold

ischemic times exceeding 12 h, which may contribute substantially to the potency of the final
islet product. Beyond these obvious differences,
it is difficult to identify other major contributory factors, as the islet processing and culture
techniques are common and shared between
centers, including specific batches of optimized
collagenase blend enzymes. Ongoing analysis of
data from the Collaborative Islet Transplant
Registry (CITR) is anticipated to highlight these
differences with more precision over time.
ADVANCES IN ISLET PROCUREMENT
AND ISOLATION
Pancreas Donor Access and Selection
The selection of a donor pancreas for islet isolation is a critical step in the transplantation procedure. Success is dictated bya number offactors
including donor BMI, cold ischemia time, use
of vasopressors, and blood glucose levels (Zeng
et al. 1994; Matsumoto et al. 2004; Nano et al.
2005). Attempts to standardize the donor selection process have been undertaken using algorithmic scoring systems (O’Gorman et al. 2005;
Witkowski et al. 2006). However, these have been
correlated with islet isolation success and not
necessarily posttransplant islet function. The selection of an “ideal” donor, leading to a large
postisolation islet mass would increase the success of single-donor transplantation. However,
the decision to allocate the “optimal” pancreas
to islet isolation must be made against the decision to use it for whole-organ pancreas transplantation, which should still take priority in
most centers, because this is a more established
procedure with more durable single-donor success, albeit with a much greater burden of perioperative risk. As the gap closes in insulin-independent success between pancreas alone and
islet transplantation alone (ITA) (and that gap
has almost closed with recent data from Minnesota, Edmonton, Geneva, Lille, and at UCSF
showing 50% insulin independence at 5 yr), it
is likely that pancreas allocation rules will change further to allow more optimal pancreas organs to be allocated to islet processing.
Most islet isolations begin with a pancreas
obtained from a heart-beating brain dead organ
donor. Most donors fall into the “marginal” category, which negatively affects islet yield and
potency. The use of donors that have succumbed
to cardiac death, more generally accepted in the
Netherlands, have yielded successful outcomes
in some centers, most notably the University of
Pittsburgh (Markmann et al. 2003; Saidi et al.
2010). Living donors are used in many transplant programs including those performing
liver and kidney graft transplants but have failed
to gain popularity in islet transplantation,
or indeed in segmental vascularized pancreas
transplantation although technically possible
(as shown by Sutherland and the Minnesota
group). The group in Kyoto successfully transplanted islets from mother to daughter using a
distal pancreatectomy in the donor (Matsumoto
et al. 2005). This places the donor at risk for
complications including pancreatic leak, fistula,
and diabetes, making this an unpopular approach for many. The potential need for multiple donors creates an added detraction in the
setting of living islet donation. Limited experience in this area has yet to establish whether
procurement under ideal circumstances (absence of brain death and inotropic support)
and use of unpurified but limited volume
pancreatic digest from half a pancreas (similar
to an islet autograft, which does have increased
rates of single-donor engraftment), will increase
rates of single, living donor insulin-independent
success.
Islet Isolation
Islet isolation involves two distinct steps: pancreas digestion and islet purification. Pancreas
digestion begins with sectioning of the pancreas, then exposing it to enzymatic digestion within a Ricordi chamber, developed nearly 20 years
ago by Ricordi et al. (1989). Even though the
apparatus itself has not changed, the enzyme
cocktails have. Early enzymes varied widely
and provided inconsistency owing to lot-to-lot
variability (Kin et al. 2007). This was temporarily resolved with the development of the enzyme
blend Liberase HI by Roche (Roche Applied

Science, Indianapolis, IN). Unfortunately, reports surfaced detailing the use of bovine brain
components in its manufacturing, leading programs to remove it from their protocols. Recent
state-of-the art blends include collagenase NB1
(Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), a mammalian
tissue-free version of Liberase (Liberase MTF,
Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) and a
new blend that enhances the proportion of intact C1 collagenase (VitaCyte CIzyme collagenase HA enzyme) (Szot et al. 2009; Brandhorst
et al. 2010; O’Gorman et al. 2010). At the current
time, the Serva, Roche, and VitaCyte products
perform with similar success, but head-to-head
comparisons are pending to more optimally define merit.
Islet Purification
Density gradient islet purification reduces the
volume of tissue infused into the portal vein.
Infusions of large volumes have been shown
previously to lead to thrombosis, embolism,
and very rarely death (Mehigan et al. 1980; Mittal et al. 1981). It should be noted that in the
post-Edmonton era, there have been no reports
of acute death resulting from intraportal islet
infusion and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a testament to islet purification,
current systemic anticoagulation protocols, and
especially to the use of low-endotoxin-containing enzyme products. Islets are purified based
on their differential density compared to the
surrounding pancreatic exocrine tissue. The development of the COBE 2991 (COBE Laboratories, Inc., Lakewood, CO), originally designed
for blood separation, has made this separation
more reproducible, shortened isolation times,
and increased islet purity (Lake et al. 1989).
Originally, most density gradients were composed of Ficoll, a synthetic polymer of sucrose,
or a derivative of it. Newer gradients have improved on this. Kin et al. (2008) were able to
achieve a 77% islet recovery rate using University of Wisconsin solution with Biocoll. Another
promising compound is Iodixanol. Alternatively used as a radiologic contrast agent under the
name Visipaque, Iodixanol (Optiprep) can enhance islet recovery (Noguchi et al. 2009) and
reduce chemokine/cytokine production (Mita
et al. 2010). Iodixaniol has seen increasing
use recently and may contribute in some (but
not all) single-donor islet transplant protocols
(Matsumoto et al. 2011).
ADVANCES IN ISLET IMPLANTATION
The vast majority of islet transplants have been
performed percutaneously into the portal vein
system (Fig. 2). Ideally, islets require ready access
to a robust vascular supply including oxygen
and glucose and the means to deliver insulin to
target tissues. From the patient’s standpoint the
transplantation of islets should confer minimal
procedural risk and allow for long-term function. In addition, having a means to monitor
islets posttransplant could allow interventions
to promote graft recovery and engraftment.
The Portal Site
Although implantation of islets directly into the
portal bloodstream with their eventual settlement in the smaller venules yields a high oxygen
tension and a near-physiologic insulin delivery
environment, it also exposes islets to very detrimental blood components. The instant bloodmediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR),
characterized by rapid activation of the coagulation and complement systems leads to rapid
islet loss (Bennet et al. 1999, 2000). Anticoagulation with heparin posttransplant has helped to
reduce the impact of IBMIR and improved the
success rate of single-donor islet engraftment
from 10% to 40% (Koh et al. 2010). Further
strategies to overcome this barrier to successful
islet engraftment are continuously sought, including blockade of tissue factor (Johansson
et al. 2005) and further anticoagulant strategies.
This procedure is not without complications. The Edmonton group reported complications including bleeding (8%), portal vein
thrombosis (3%), and bile leakage (Owen et al.
2003). The risk of bleeding has been substantially reduced through the use of agents that
plug the catheter tract (including Avitene paste
and coils) (Villiger et al. 2005). Inclusion of heparin in the islet preparation and intravenously

postinfusion has made life-threatening thrombosis extremely rare.
Posttransplant monitoring of intraportal
islets, although potentially useful for guiding
therapy, has proven difficult. Random biopsy
sampling is only successful in 30% of attempts
and may not provide timely answers as samples
are prepared and analyzed (Toso et al. 2009).
Imaging modalities may provide a more timely
answer to posttransplant islet status. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), using islets labeled
with a paramagnetic compound, can provide
relatively high spatial resolution but lacks
long-term application and may be limited by
iron overload (Toso et al. 2008; Medarova and
Moore 2009). Positron emission tomography
(PET) using [18F]FDG-labeled islets may provide superior sensitivity and specificity as compared to MRI and has already elucidated the
early posttransplant loss of islets (Eich et al.
2007a; Eriksson et al. 2009). However, longerterm monitoring of islets in the portal site has
remained elusive owing to islet dispersion and
washout of tracers.
Although the portal site remains the most
common islet habitat, it is certainly not without
its drawbacks. Early islet loss and difficulties
in posttransplant monitoring have led research
groups to search for alternatives.
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPLANT SITES
The drawbacks of the portal site, namely, the
early posttransplant islet loss and the difficulty
in reliably monitoring the graft, have initiated a
search for alternative sites (Fig. 4). In a mouse
model, syngeneic rodent islets transplanted into
the femur are able to reverse hyperglycemia
without any evidence of derangement of the
hematopoietic system or disruption of structural integrity (Cantarelli et al. 2009). Another
promising site is the gastric submucosal space

(GSMS) (Echeverri et al. 2009; Wszola et al.
2009). After endoscopic placement, islets would
benefit from a rich blood supply and a high oxygen tension. Preclinical trials using a porcine
model showed reduced early islet loss and insulin requirements when GSMS islets were compared to intraportal islets (Echeverri et al. 2009).
Transplantation into a more readily accessible site, such as skeletal muscle, would facilitate
graft monitoring, implantation, and biopsy.
In mice, intramuscular islet grafts display enhanced revascularization with vessel densities
and blood flow comparable to the native pancreas (Christoffersson et al. 2010). Clinically, a
group in Sweden transplanted a 7-yr-old girl
with autologous islets (6400 islets/kg) after total pancreatectomy (Rafael et al. 2008). The
techniques developed using PET in intraportal
implantation would apply readily to intramuscular grafts provided the correct biomarkers
were available (Eriksson and Alavi 2011). One
drawback of the muscular site is the space limitation. Combination of the portal and intramuscular site would allow placement of a “sentinel” graft in muscle to allow for early detection
and intervention in the case of rejection.
A novel approach to graph implantation is
the use of islet encapsulation devices. Both micro- and macroencapsulation devices have been
developed that provide a secure oxygen and
nutrient-rich environment for islets, while
potentially affording a degree of immunoisolation. This idea dates back to 1977 when Chick
et al. (1977) developed an “artificial pancreas,” a
small hollow tube made of semipermeable
acrylic copolymer. When filled with islets, these
devices restored glycemia for hours before their
removal. Others have used alginate and related
compounds with improved success, showing
robust enough protection to allow islet xenograft survival (Duvivier-Kali et al. 2001, 2004;
Omer et al. 2003). Macroencapsulation, providing a larger volume for tissue implantation, has
the added advantage of being reloadable and
retrievable. One example is the TheraCyte device that is composed of a double membrane of
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (Suzuki et al.
1998; Yang et al. 2002). The inner membrane
provides immunoisolation, whereas the outer
membrane facilitates angiogenesis. Despite the
advances in device conception and construction, there has been a challenge to achieve success in large animal allogeneic or xenogeneic
islet models. Scharp et al. have reported protection of islets for 2 weeks in macro devices transplanted into normal, type 1, and type 2 diabetic
patients (Scharp et al. 1994). More recently, Calafiore et al. (2006) have shown function of microencapsulated allogeneic islets transplanted
intraperitoneally, whereas Elliott et al. (2007)
reported a case of macroencapsulated porcine
islets showing live islet cells nearly 10 years after
implantation into a diabetic recipient. Although
islet encapsulation is a promising avenue, it is
still hampered by challenges including overcoming device biocompatibility, ineffective immunoprotection, hypoxia, and posttransplant
inflammation (Vaithilingam and Tuch 2011).
ADVANCES IN POSTTRANSPLANT
TREATMENT
Islet implantation into a recipient with diabetes
exposes the islets to a number of detrimental
factors. These include IBMIR, hypoxia, inflammation, hyperglycemia, mechanical injury, and
immune-meditated islet attack. The aim of recipient treatment posttransplant is to reduce the
effects these factors have on the transplanted
islet mass. On the horizon there are several exciting and innovative trials moving forward in
the clinical arena in islet transplantation, and in
fact there are .80 registered trials presently registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Table 1). With
.1500 subjects potentially enrollable in these
trials, and at an estimated cost of in excess of
$150,000 USD per subject treated, the burden
of cost on research organizations is enormous
($227 million USD), and is likely not sustainable. There are major endeavors under way now
in the United States to secure a biological license
(BLA) for islet transplantation so that many of
the routine costs of islet preparation and patient
care can be assumed by reimbursable sources
(e.g., Medicare and Medicaid). In Canada, this
process occurred in 2001, with the Canadian
Provincial governments reimbursing islet transplantation as standard clinical care in carefully

selected indications. Similarly, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
(NICE) in the United Kingdom recently fully
funded islet transplantation, and several other
countriesincluding Sweden, Switzerland, France,
and Italy have followed suit. “Brittle” type 1 diabetes with associated recurrent hypoglycemic
episodes or marked glycemic lability, despite
best efforts by a qualified diabetologist or endocrinologist to stabilize control with optimized
insulin delivery including intensive insulin, insulin pumps, or continuous glucose monitoring
systems (CGMS), currently form the basis for
consideration of islet-alone transplantation.

with the Clinical Islet Transplant Consortium

Islet Engraftment
The initial few days following islet infusion are
a critical time. It is clear that a large proportion
of the graft is lost during this period, up to 60%
in both syngeneic mouse islet models (Biarnes
et al. 2002) and clinically in the allogeneic setting
(Eich et al. 2007b). Below we will review approaches to enhancing engraftment, which may
improve islet survival and function leading to
improved single-donor islet transplant success.
Anti-Inflammatory
When islets become trapped in portal venules
they are relatively ischemic and inflamed before
undergoing revascularization, aided by the recipient arterial system. This places islets at direct risk of undergoing apoptosis and necrosis.
More specifically, islets are subject to attack by a
number of cytokines, including tumor necrosis
factor a (TNF-a) and Interleukin 1 (IL-1).
An initial study by Farney et al. (1993)
showed the benefit of TNF-a blockade in mice
receiving syngeneic islet grafts. This led to the
inclusion of etanercept, a fusion protein that
includes the TNF receptor, in a single-donor
islet transplant protocol reported by Hering
et al. (2005). Eight patients received an average
of 7271 IEQ/kg from an optimal donor pancreas in addition to etanercept (50 mg IV day 0 and
25 mg on days 3, 7, and 10) antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and daclizumab for induction therapy. Islets were cultured for a period of 2 days
before transplant. All eight patients became insulin independent (Hering et al. 2005). It remains unclear at this time how much the period
of culture and anti-inflammatory strategies
contributed to single-donor islet engraftment.
Etanercept has now been included in many other islet transplant protocols including the University of Chicago (Gangemi et al. 2008), the
University of Miami (Faradji et al. 2008), and
the University of Alberta. Alternative TNF-a
blockade with the monoclonal antibody Infliximab, although potent inflammatory disorders
including inflammatory bowel disease, has not
shown a benefit in islet transplantation (Froud
et al. 2005). It is difficult to explain why etanercept may be more potent than Infliximab for
suppression of TNF-a during islet engraftment,
or indeed whether multiple other differences in
the islet product and engraftment regimens outside of TNF-a contributed to single-donor engraftment success.
Blockade of IL-1 with anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, has become important in the
treatment of inflammatory conditions including rheumatoid arthritis (Mertens and Singh
2009). Matsumoto et al. (2011) published results of three patients who received a combination of etanercept and anakinra, reporting benefits to early graft function. Our own laboratory
has investigated the combination of TNFa/IL-1
blockade and found them to be synergistic in
promoting islet engraftment in mice (McCall
et al. 2011a).
Apoptosis and IBMIR
The team in Uppsala, Sweden led by Dr. Olle
Korsgren has extensively studied the effects of
IBMIR and its negative effect on engrafting islets
(Bennet et al. 2000; Nilsson et al. 2011). IBMIR
involves a thrombotic and inflammatory reaction characterized by binding of platelets to the
islet surface and infiltration of leukocytes in the
islets. This is likely mediated by tissue factor expressed on the islets themselves. The group has
developed multiple potential targets to reduce
the effects of IBMIR including dextran sulfate
and islet surface heparinization (Johansson et al.
2006; Cabric et al. 2007). Intravenous infusions
of heparin and insulin posttransplant have been
reported to improve the success of single-donor
islet transplantation (Koh et al. 2010).
Apoptosis, a caspase-mediated event, is a
dominant final pathway for early islet death.
Methods to prevent islet apoptosis in the early posttransplant period have been extensively
studied by our laboratory and others. Emamaullee et al. engineered rodent islets to overexpress X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
(XIAP) (Emamaullee et al. 2005). This rendered
them relatively resistant to apoptosis. Although
modification of islets with viral vectors may not
be palatable in the clinical setting, this “proof
of principle” inspired studies exploring caspase

inhibitors. We have recently studied the compound IDN6556 (Conatus Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., San Diego, CA) in both mouse and pig islet
transplant models (McCall et al. 2011b). In both
cases, addition of the drug posttransplant led to
improvements in marginal mass islet engraftment. In other words, a minimal islet graft size
was able to ameliorate diabetes in mice when
treated with the caspase inhibitor. A further
compound (EP1013) was tested that showed
the ability to promote allograft survival when
combined with costimulation blockade. A clinical trial is planned with IDN6556 and if the
results mirror those seen in the preclinical studies this approach could substantially reduce the
islet mass necessary to secure insulin independence and the antigenic burden placed on the
immune system by dying islets.
Metabolic and Growth Stimulation
Glucagonlike-peptide 1 (GLP1) is an endogenous peptide secreted form intestinal L cells that
functions to increase insulin secretion and bcell mass. Analogs of GLP1 are currently used in
the management of type 2 diabetes and have
shown promise in the setting of single-donor
islet transplantation. The ability of exenatide
to aid islet engraftment has been shown by multiple centers including the universities of Illinois, Miami, and British Columbia (Ghofaili
et al. 2007; Faradji et al. 2008; Gangemi et al.
2008). However, 30% of patients on exenatide
develop intolerable nausea. An alternative compound, liraglutide, has been shown to possess
similar effects, benefitting human islet culture
and engraftment in mice (Merani et al. 2008b;
Toso et al. 2010). This compound seems to be
better tolerated in patients.
Advances in Recipient Immunosuppression
Effective control of both alloimmune and autoimmune islet attack in the recipient remains
the cornerstone of posttransplant islet recipient
treatment. Unfortunately, many of the compounds used are toxic to the islets themselves.
This is especially true of corticosteroids that
formed the backbone of islet transplant immunosuppression before the Edmonton Protocol
(Morel et al. 1992; Shapiro et al. 1998). One of
the main strengths of the Edmonton Protocol
report was its avoidance of corticosteroid use.
In its place, sirolimus (a macrolide antibiotic
which inhibits mTOR) and tacrolimus (Tac) (a
calcineurin inhibitor) were used (Shapiro et al.
2000). These are not without their own side effects as tacrolimus can cause neuro- and nephrotoxicity in addition to b-cell damage (Froud
et al. 2006; Chatenoud 2008). The choice to
eliminate tacrolimus and/or sirolimus may improve metabolic function but may be detrimental when considering the risk of rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, CellCept), a purine
biosynthesis inhibitor, is now more commonly
used either in combination with tacrolimus or
sirolimus (Table 2).
Induction therapy is used in most islet
transplant protocols. The Edmonton Protocol
used daclizumab, an anti-interleukin 2 receptor
monoclonal antibody (anti-CD25) given pretransplant and for four doses biweekly posttransplant (Shapiro et al. 2000). Daclizumab is
now off the market as its patent has expired. The
Minnesota program reported use of an antiT-cell strategy with anti-CD3 (hOKT3-ala-ala)
which, when combined with sirolimus and lowdose tacrolimus, promoted single-donor insulin
independence in four of six recipients (Hering
et al. 2004). More recently at the University of
Alberta, we have noted marked and sustained
improvement in 5-yr insulin independence outcomes that now match the results of pancreasalone transplantation at a similar time point,
when alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) T-depletional
induction is given. The combination of alemtuzumab induction with tacrolimus and MMF
maintenance has led to durable protection
against both auto- and alloimmune pathways.
Despite this approach, single-donor islet engraftment success at the University of Alberta
has remained at approximately 10%. This reflects our less selective approach both to pancreas donors and recipients, and emphasizes the
need to address early engraft and peritransplant
survival of portally infused cells.
A number of exciting new immunosuppressive agents are emerging that may provide

superior immunosuppression with elimination
of existing agents such as tacrolimus. The combination of sirolimus and MMF is one option
but this may not provide potent long-term
immunosuppression to prevent rejection. Costimulation blockade has seen increasing use
in organ transplantation clinical trials (Bluestone 2005; Vincenti et al. 2005). Two compounds have currently been approved for use:
abatacept (CTLA4Ig) and belatacept (LEA29Y),
which block T-cell interaction with CD80/
CD86 on antigen-presenting cells. The group
at UCSF has reported promising results with belatacept costimulation blockade in combination
with thymoglobulin (thymo)-based therapy
(Posselt et al. 2010b). This protocol allowed a
calcineurin-inhibitor-free maintenance therapy
strategy and even permitted single-donor engraftment success. This same group has studied
the benefit of an anti-LFA-1 antibody called
efalizumab (Posselt et al. 2010a,b). Although effective in allowing tacrolimus-free maintenance
therapy, it has been withdrawn from clinical use
owing to concerns of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and thus the long-term followup in these studies was hampered.
Advances in Immune Monitoring and Control
of Recurrent Autoimmunity
Although islet transplantation is currently the
most minimally invasive transplant available
(perhaps with the exception of a blood transfusion), and is attractive from a conceptual
perspective, its relatively tiny cellular mass distributed diffusely throughout the liver creates
especially unique challenges for detection, imaging, and monitoring post transplant. The inability to detect early islet rejection at a time
point where reversal is still possible, combined
with a need to control recurrence of autoimmunity in an already highly primed subject with
type 1 diabetes, conversely create one of the
most difficult transplants to maintain. Lessons

learned previously in whole pancreas transplantation suggested that minimal maintenance
immunosuppression would probably control
autoimmunity, but it is now becoming increasingly apparent that even in whole pancreas
transplantation complete autoimmune-mediated destruction leads to graft loss in at least
6% –10% (and maybe more) over time (Vendrame et al. 2010; Burke et al. 2011; Pugliese
et al. 2011). Clear histological evidence of recurrent autoimmunitywith selectiveb-cell destruction after islet transplantation has been shown
by Rossini’s group (Rossini 2004; Sharma et al.
2006). Although core biopsy of an intrahepatic
islet transplant is technically possible, the approach is unattractive to patients, and only
yields islet material in about half of the cases
(Toso et al. 2009). However, encouraging data
is beginning to emerge from sequential analysis
of peripheral blood. Perturbations in autoantibody levels in peripheral blood for islet cell
autoantibody (ICA-512), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-65), and anti-insulin antibody
(IA-2) over time have generally not yielded
distinctive patterns predictive of eventual islet
outcome, possibly in part owing to imprecision
in the monitoring of these antibodies, and perhaps suggesting that the presence of such antibodies could be epiphenomena, and not always
predictive of potency of autoreactive memory
responses. Conversely, Roep’s group have found
striking correlations between cellular autoreactivity in lymphocyte stimulation tests against
autoantigens and alloreactivity using cytotoxic
T-cell lymphocyte precursor assays and outcome in clinical islet transplantation (Huurman
et al. 2008). Furthermore, the same group found
a strong association between cytokine profiles in
mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) assays using
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and graftspecific HLA class II. They also measured cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursor (CTLp) assays to
determine HLA class I alloreactivity, and found
that a marked skew toward a Th2 or regulatory
phenotype in those subjects maintaining insulin
independence over time, with production of
IL10 and low-MLC reactivity strongly associated
with persistence insulin independence over time
(Huurman et al. 2009).
Kenyon’s group in Miami have studied perturbations in granzyme B and perforin messenger RNA (mRNA) expression within cytotoxic
lymphocytes, and found that especially granzyme B mRNA expression can be predictive of
eventual islet failure, and may occur up to many
months before the onset of hyperglycemia (Han
et al. 2002, 2004). Although these observations
are enticing, until the course of inevitable graft
failure is clearly averted by interventions dictated by elevated granzyme B expression, their utility will remain unclear.
New technologies for the study of peptideMHC T-cell ligands using tetramer-based approaches have been developed by Nepom’s
group, and allow more precise visualization of
autoreactive T-lymphocyte responses (Nepom
2005). Such approaches may further predict
which subjects may do better in the longer
term with an islet transplant, and may further
help to direct T-cell-specific immunotherapies
for control of recurrent autoimmunity post
transplant.Until such time as “personalizedmedicine”-based approaches are developed and applied in the setting of clinical islet transplantation, highly potent T-direct inductive therapy
and increased dosing of maintenance immunosuppression will be required in all cases, if recurrent autoimmunity and protection from allograft rejection is to be controlled effectively.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
There have been substantial advances in clinical
islet transplantation over the past 12 years. Before this time, insulin independence was an extremely rare occurrence. The Edmonton Protocol success invigorated the field and prompted
continued research and effort into improving
islet transplant outcomes. Although the initial
results of this series were promising using multiple islet donors, the insulin-independence
rates declined markedly by 3 and 5 years after
islet infusion. In the years following, groups
have improved on these results; now single islet
donors can provide insulin independence. The
routine achievement of these results will allow
for many more subjects to be treated with islets
and will reduce risk of donor HLA sensitization.

In addition, insulin-independence rates using
multiple islet donors are nearing those for pancreas transplantation making decisions around
pancreas allocation less straightforward. Advances in engraftment and immunosuppressive
agents have permitted these improved results.
How can we further advance islet transplantation so that single-donor insulin independence
is routine? This will require a multimodal approach including the optimization of the donor
pancreas, access to consistent and effective collagenase enzyme blends, improved islet engraftment and immunosuppressive agents, and further advances in islet graft monitoring. This will
no doubt improve both short- and long-term
islet transplantation success and further open
up this exciting treatment to diabetic patients.
