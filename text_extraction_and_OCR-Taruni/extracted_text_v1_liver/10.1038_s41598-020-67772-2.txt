Clinical impact of irreversible 
electroporation ablation 
for unresectable hilar 
cholangiocarcinoma
Chih‑Yang Hsiao1,2,3, Po‑ChihYang 1,4, Xiaoyong Li5 & Kai‑Wen Huang1,2,6*
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a non-thermal ablation modality that has been shown to be safe 
and efective in its application to tumors that are close to risky areas. This study aims to assess the 
safety and efcacy of IRE for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Nine patients from two medical 
centers in Asia received IRE treatment between June 2015 and July 2017. Before IRE treatment, 
percutaneous biliary decompressions had been performed on eight patients, and internal stenting 
had been performed on one patient. All patients tolerated the procedure well without high-grade 
complications. The ablated tumors had constant size without contrast enhancement for more than 
three months in eight patients and the level of CA19-9 decreased signifcantly in all patients. The 
percutaneous biliary drainage tube was removed from two patients with recanalization of the bile 
duct. The internal stent in one patient was removed without further stenting. The median overall 
survival period was 26 months, and the progression-free survival was 18 months. Bile ducts remained 
narrow in the majority (2/3) of the treated patients. Nevertheless, IRE ablation of unresectable hilar 
cholangiocarcinoma involving vital structures is a safe and feasible primary treatment for local tumor 
control and is efective in prolonging survival.
Hilar cholangiocarcinoma, also known as a Klatskin tumor, is a form of ductal adenocarcinoma involving a 
common bile duct and the bifurcation of intrahepatic ducts. It is the most common type of bile duct cancer, 
accounting for approximately 60–70% of total cholangiocarcinomas1
. Te Bismuth-Corlette staging system classifes hilar tumors by the extension and location of hepatic ductal infltration. Unfortunately, the majority of 
patients have an advanced disease that precludes radical resection due to either local vascular invasion, hepatic 
extension, or distant metastasis, in which resectability is less than 30%2
.
Tere are no efective modalities for patients who are not suitable for surgical resection. Empirical radiotherapy and chemotherapy with gemcitabine-based regimens can achieve a response rate of only 7–27%, and it 
cannot sufciently prolong a patient’s lifespan. Patients usually succumb to obstructive jaundice and related complications. Long-term patency of biliary drainage is the only solution proven to be helpful for patient survival3
, 
but even with successful biliary stenting, the average survival period is only 6–8 months4
.
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new non-thermal ablative modality that induces cancer cell apoptosis in 
tumors through the destruction of cell membranes by electroporation5
. Recently, the technique has been routinely 
applied for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and prostate cancer6,7
, and its safety and efcacy have 
been documented. However, there remains a dearth of literature on the role of IRE in hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
In this study, we report our experience with IRE treatment in nine patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma from two medical centers in Asia. Tese patients had been treated with only palliative percutaneous

transhepatic cholangiography and drainage (PTCD) before IRE treatment. Te aim of the study was to investigate 
pilot results and explore the clinical efcacy and safety of IRE treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinomas.
Materials and methods
Patients. Tis retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee and the institute review board of 
National Taiwan University Hospital (Protocol ID: 201210007DIC), and all study methods were performed in 
accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All study subjects provided informed consent prior 
to participation in the investigation. Te study retrospectively included nine patients with unresectable hilar 
cholangiocarcinoma from National Taiwan University Hospital and the Fifh Afliated Hospital of Zhengzhou 
University who were seen from June 2015 to July 2017, and the data were collected in December 2019.
Te demographic data and the patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Four patients were male, and fve 
patients were female. Te mean age was 63.6±9.03 (range 41–83) years. Te clinical presentations before diagnosis included jaundice, pruritus, and clay-colored stool. Preoperative diagnoses were made by contrast-enhanced 
computed tomography (CT), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, or positron emission tomography (PET) scans if the image revealed an enhanced sof tissue density within the bifurcation of the common 
hepatic duct with intrahepatic bile duct dilation. All patients had unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma, which 
was confrmed by intraoperative exploration and tumor biopsies. Seven of the patients had locally advanced 
disease, and two patients had systemic disease with distant metastasis.
According to the Bismuth–Corlette classifcation, three patients had type III disease, six patients had type 
IV disease, and the mean primary tumor size was 2.8±1.2 cm. Te defnition of unresectable tumor refers to 
AJCC (8th edition) stage IV disease (i.e., with any regional lymph node metastasis) or stage III disease (i.e., 
tumor perforating the visceral peritoneum or involving local extrahepatic structures by direct invasion) without 
adequate liver reserve to undergo hepatic resection. As for the gross morphology of the tumors, fve patients 
had the periductal or intraductal type, and four patients had the mass forming type based on image studies. All 
patients had no severe systemic diseases.
All patients had obstructive jaundice at the time of diagnosis. According to imaging examinations, eight 
patients had complete obstruction of at least one major hepatic duct, and these eight patients had undergone 
PTCD without an attempt at endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage before IRE treatment. One patient with 
partial biliary obstruction had undergone endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage to place a plastic stent in a 
bile duct before IRE treatment.
Treatment procedure. Before IRE treatment, all patients had undergone routine preoperative evaluations, 
including complete blood count, liver function, CA-19-9 levels, creatinine kinase levels, coagulation function 
tests, and electrocardiograms to assess their suitability for IRE treatment. Tumor ablation with IRE was performed under general anesthesia with full paralysis using the Nanoknife System (Angiodynamic, USA) sonography guidance. Five patients underwent IRE by laparotomy, and four patients underwent IRE percutaneously. 
Patients who underwent IRE by laparotomy also underwent cholecystectomy and regional lymph node dissection.
Te ablation zone was planned to cover the whole targeted area including the suspicious tumor area based 
on imaging, bile ducts that were abnormal or narrowed, and regionally enlarged lymph nodes. Electrodes were 
inserted under sonography guidance based on the principle of the caudal-cranial direction and parallel to the 
hepatoduodenal ligament (during laparotomy) or an anteroposterior approach (during percutaneous approach) 
to avoid injury of the vessels. Te ablation area was covered by the electric feld created using 3 to 4 unipolar 
electrodes with an active tip of 1.5–2.0 cm, and the distance between each electrode was 1.5–2.5 cm.
In total, 90–180 electric pulses with a voltage of 2,400–3,000 V/cm were administered between each pair 
of electrodes, and the pulse length was set at 70–90 ms. Afer removal of the electrodes, the operator checked

whether there was any bleeding or bile leakage, and compression or suturing was applied if it was deemed 
necessary. An intraperitoneal drain was placed for postoperative monitoring in patients who had undergone 
laparotomies.
Post‑treatment examination and management. Afer the IRE procedure, patients were closely monitored in the ward. Empirical antibiotics and intravenous fuid were given with fasting within 24  h. Regular 
monitoring of complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry profle including muscle enzymes, and the liver 
and renal functional profles were determined on postoperative days 1, 3, and 7. Laboratory examinations and 
contrast-enhanced CT or MR were performed one month afer the procedure and then once every three months. 
A cholangiogram was obtained on postoperative day 7 via PTCD or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. No patient underwent postoperative radiotherapy, but two patients underwent postoperative adjuvant 
chemotherapy.
Te efcacy of treatment was assessed by contrast-enhanced CT or MR imaging at one month and three 
months afer the procedure. Te treatment was considered efective and complete when the following fndings 
were observed: (1) absence of contrast enhancement of the tumor in the one-month CT/MR image and (2) 
progressive shrinkage of the tumor in the three-month CT/MR image. Te treatment was considered partially 
efective or not efective when contrast enhancement of the tumor was still present in the one-month CT/MR 
image or new solid enhanced nodules or enlargement of the tumor mass was detected in the three-month CT/
MR image8
. Te percutaneous biliary drainage tube was removed afer the procedure within three months if the 
bile duct was patent without evidence of obstructive jaundice, and it was replaced with an expandable metallic 
stent if necessary.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as the mean±standard deviation, and paired t-tests were used to 
compare the clinical and biochemical data of patients before and afer the procedure. A value of P < 0.05 was 
considered statistically signifcant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
Treatment course. All patients underwent the IRE procedure without complications or severe arrhythmia. Hypertension was noted in some patients, but systolic pressure never exceeded 200 mmHg in any patient. 
During the procedure, the delivered current was distinctly elevated with a diference of 10–15 A, which shows 
the efectiveness of electroporation. Te lesions in all patients were proven to be adenocarcinoma by intraoperative biopsies. Two of the fve patients who underwent lymph node dissection during laparotomy had lymph 
node metastasis. No patients had high-grade complications according to the Clavien–Dindo classifcation. No 
patients had postoperative bleeding, bile leakage, or infection. All patients were discharged within seven days 
afer operation.
Two patients were within the normal range for the tumor marker CA19-9 before and afer treatments. Te 
other seven patients had elevated CA19-9 preoperatively, which gradually returned to the normal range by 
one month afer the IRE procedure. Te preoperative mean total bilirubin level was 2.9±1.1 mg/dL, and the 
postoperative mean total bilirubin level one month later was 1.2±0.4 mg/dL. Tree months afer the operation, 
trans-catheter cholangiography was performed, and three patients had patent bile ducts. Terefore, their external 
PTCD tube (n=2) or plastic internal stent (n=1) was removed, and one patient with PTCD received internal 
metallic stent replacement before the removal of the PTCD.
PTCDs were not removed from the other six patients because they still had apparent narrowing of the bile 
ducts, which was revealed by cholangiogram. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT/MR at one month afer the procedure revealed complete response in eight of the nine patients (Fig. 1). Only one patient had residual enhanced 
nodules with an enlarged disease area, which suggested a remaining tumor. Te same results were observed by 
CT/MR at three months afer IRE, and a complete ablation rate of 88.9% was achieved.
Follow‑up and outcome. All patients survived for at least 12 months afer IRE treatment. During followup in the frst year, three patients had disease progression, including three patients who had regional lymphadenopathy that were suspicious for metastasis. One patient had intrahepatic distant liver metastasis, and two 
patients had local recurrence in the ablated area, which presented as hyperbilirubinemia and biliary infection 
(Table 2). Two patients underwent postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with a gemcitabine-based regimen, and 
seven other patients refused chemotherapy for personal reasons based on quality of life and health care support.
Among the nine patients, the follow-up period ranged from 13 to 39 months. Te median overall survival 
time was 26 months (interquartile range 23–32 months), and the median progression-free survival time was 
18 months (interquartile range 12–21 months). Seven patients had disease progression during the follow-up 
period, and four of them died in the 13th, 23rd, 25th, or 32nd postoperative month due to liver failure related 
to multiple liver metastases and severe infection. Five patients were alive (median OS, 27 months) as of the last 
follow-up at data collection (aside from one patient who survived 17 months and was lost to follow-up). Two 
patients were still in a progression-free state at the end of follow-up in the 33rd and 39th months afer treatment.
Discussion
Hilar cholangiocarcinoma has a unique anatomical location with difuse infltration along the biliary tree. Resectability is rare, and the prognosis is usually poor. In recent years, the detection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma 
and thus its incidence have increased because of advances in image modalities and the prevalence of health 
examinations9

Current treatment options for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
palliative biliary drainage (by percutaneous external drainage or internal drainage with stent placement), radiofrequency ablation, and photodynamic therapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have poor responses10–12, 
and palliative biliary drainage relieves only obstructive jaundice without treating the primary tumor, resulting 
in a poor survival rate in most patients13. Patients ofen die of obstructive jaundice, biliary tract infection, and 
hepatic failure, which are related to tumor progression.
Photodynamic therapy and local tumor ablation could improve bile drainage and keep biliary patency and 
have been proposed to prolong a patient’s survival14,15. A prospective cohort study compared systemic therapy 
to photodynamic therapy in 40 patients with successful biliary stenting. Te photodynamic therapy group fared 
better with a median survival of 425 days, compared to 169 days for chemotherapy15.
IRE is a non-thermal ablation method that induces cell apoptosis by creating nanoscale-sized pores in cell 
membranes through the application of high-voltage, low-energy, direct-current pulses16. Tis method destroys 
only the cell membranes of tumor cells and does not damage the extracellular matrix components that maintain 
the continuity of sensitive structures, such as blood vessels, nerves, and bile ducts5,17. It is suitable for the treatment of tumors that are adjacent to or have infltrated important structures, such as pancreatic cancer18.
In the past few years, we have used IRE for the treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinomas. We retrospectively 
reviewed the clinical data and outcomes of nine cases with hilar cholangiocarcinoma treated with IRE. Tis

local control (progressive shrinkage of tumor without any contrast-enhancing lesion) with complete response.

results (lef lower part). Before IRE treatment, an obstructive bile duct was observed (lef), but three months

method appears to be a safe and feasible treatment because there were no serious adverse events or complications in these patients.
Te transient elevation of CA19-9 on day 3 afer the procedure might be related to extravasation of intracellular protein due to the perforation of cell membranes, but the steady normalization of CA19-9 thereafer 
indicated the efective targeting of tumor cells. All patients had neither biliary leakage nor vascular injury during 
the long-term follow-up. Our preliminary results revealed that there were no viable residual tumors in 88.9% of 
patients afer IRE treatment, but obstruction of the bile ducts remained in the majority of patients, and PTCD 
drainage was needed to relieve jaundice. Only three of the nine (33.3%) patients were weaned of PTCD tubes. 
Nevertheless, all patients had a survival time that was longer than the expected average survival time reported 
in the current literature19–22.
We have proposed a new treatment strategy of using IRE for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma, which 
addresses the dedicated local control of the primary tumor with a low risk non-thermal ablation procedure. 
Compared with other currently available palliative treatments, IRE has advantages of efective local tumor control, safety, fewer complications, and an absence of heat-sink efects23,24. Our preliminary results demonstrated 
high efcacy in local tumor control with an overall survival of 24.8±6.84 months and disease progression-free 
survival of 18.5±8.41 months, which exceeded the results of other standard palliative treatments that are currently available. To date, there has been a dearth of reports on the application of IRE in the treatment of hilar 
cholangiocarcinoma in the literature.
Martin et al. reported on 26 patients who had undergone IRE and demonstrated the method’s safety, with 
an acceptable complication rate of 11.5% (3/26). Following IRE, the median catheter-free time before requiring 
PTCD replacement was 305 days25. However, there have been no reports detailing the median or long-term survival of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma following IRE treatment. Our preliminary results demonstrate 
that IRE treatment without adjuvant chemotherapy likely prolongs patients’ overall and disease-free survival.
Our study has some limitations. We reported on a small number of cases with relatively short follow-up 
periods. Determining the long-term efectiveness requires larger case numbers with longer follow-up periods. 
However, our study still has clinical value for IRE-based treatment in the local control and progression of unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
Metastasis, tumor progression-related obstructive jaundice, and complications such as biliary infection due 
to external drainage tubes continue to play a crucial role in patient prognosis. Future work may consider whether 
IRE in combination with additional adjuvant chemotherapy and the replacement of PTCD tubes with internal 
biliary stents would be benefcial for patient prognosis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that IRE appears to 
be a safe and feasible treatment for patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma that sufciently controls 
local tumor progression and may have potential benefts for patient survival.
