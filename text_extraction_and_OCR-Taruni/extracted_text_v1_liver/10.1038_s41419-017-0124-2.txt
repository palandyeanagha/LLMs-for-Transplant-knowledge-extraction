Abstract
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be detected in up to 33.6% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients,
often in absence of metabolic risk factors. Nevertheless, most of previous studies on such issue were conducted within
the IBD population only. The primary aim of this study was to compare clinical and metabolic features of NAFLD in
patients with and without IBD (w/o IBD) and to identify specific NAFLD phenotypes within the IBD population. Among
223 NAFLD patients, 78 patients with IBD were younger compared to 145 without (w/o) IBD, were less likely to have
altered liver enzymes, had lower mean body weight, smaller waist circumference and lower body mass index (BMI); at
the same time, MetS was more prevalent among patients w/o IBD (56.6 vs. 23.1%, p < 0.001). Within IBD population,
patients with severe IBD showed more often severe steatosis (S3) at ultrasound (US) (32.1 vs. 16.6%, p = 0.01),
compared to mild-to-moderate disease. Independent risk factors for S3 US steatosis in IBD patients at the multivariate
logistic regression analysis were: more than 1 IBD relapse per year during disease history (OR 17.3, 95% CI 3.6–84),
surgery for IBD (OR 15.1, 95% CI 3.1–73.7) and more extensive intestinal involvement (OR 19.4, 95% CI 3.4–110.9); the
ongoing anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (antiTNFα) therapy was the only independent factor which protect toward
the presence of altered liver enzymes (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0–0.8, p = 0.02). In conclusion, NAFLD in IBD patients is different
from that in patients w/o IBD, who seem to develop different NAFLD phenotypes according to intestinal disease
clinical course. More severe IBD seem to predict the presence of more severe steatosis. Therapy with antiTNFα
antibodies could prevent alteration of liver enzymes in such population.
Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a
wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from hepatic steatosis
(NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD
patients are at high risk for liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)1–5
. Although NAFLD is
typically associated with altered metabolism and metabolic syndrome (MetS), it also occurs in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this context,
NAFLD is usually considered the consequence of malnutrition and malabsorption6
.
The prevalence of NAFLD in IBD patients is highly
variable ranging from 1.5% to even 40%, in dependence of
different diagnostic criteria7–9
. In a recent retrospective
study, Bessissow et al.10 confirmed that NAFLD is often
diagnosed in IBD patients (prevalence 33,6%, incidence
rate 9.1/100 PY); at baseline, IBD patients who developed
NAFLD during the observation period were older, more
often diabetics and with a higher average body mass index
(BMI) than those who did not develop NAFLD10.
Nevertheless, prevalence of obesity and diabetes in such
population was low and some Authors hypothesized that
the pathogenesis of NAFLD in IBD patients could involve

disease-specific risk factors, related, for example, to the
underlying chronic inflammatory status11,12. In this view,
disease activity and duration, steroid use during the
inflammatory bowel disease progression, small bowel
surgery and alterations of the gut microbiota, were identified as predictors of NAFLD in such patients; these
factors could be considered as surrogate markers of IBD
severity.
Taken together, these data suggest that IBD patients
could develop NAFLD with less metabolic risk factors
than the general population10,11,13. However, most studies
on this issue were conducted in IBD patients only, without a direct comparison of clinical features and natural
history of NAFLD in non-IBD patients1,4,14,15. Moreover,
the impact of NAFLD-related features on the progression
of IBD is completely unknown.
The primary aim of this retrospective study was to
characterize NAFLD in patients with and without IBD (w/
o IBD), comparing their clinical and metabolic features.
According to the presence of severe steatosis and altered
liver enzymes, the secondary aim of the study was to
identify specific NAFLD-phenotypes within the IBD
population, relating them to the course of the intestinal
disease.
Results
Study chart
Three-hundred and 30 consecutive patients were evaluated for study eligibility, 107 of whom were excluded
because they did not meet the exclusion criteria (Fig. 1).
The demographic and clinical data of the remaining 223
patients, 78 NAFLD + IBD and 145 NAFLD without
(w/o) IBD were collected and retrospectively analyzed.
Clinical and metabolic characteristics of NAFLD + IBD
patients
Clinical and demographic data of the 78 IBD patients at
the time of observation are reported in Table 1. All of the
78 IBD patients had NAFLD diagnosis prior to IBD
diagnosis. Forty-two out of 78 patients with NAFLD +
IBD had Crohn’s disease (53.8%) and 36 (46.2%) had
Ulcerative colitis. CD and UC patients did not significantly differ for clinical and metabolic characteristics.
Forty-three out of 78 patients (55.1%) had extensive IBD
and 26 patients (33.3%) had clinical and/or endoscopicdocumented active disease lasting at least 3 months.
Thirty-four out of 78 patients (43.6%) had history of more
than 1 disease relapse/year since IBD diagnosis. Twentyseven out of patients 78 (34.6%) had had surgery during
their IBD course (ileal or ileo-colonic resection for 20 CD
patients, none of whom developed short bowel syndrome
and total subtotal or total procto-colectomy with ileo-anal
anastomosis for 7 UC patients). Concerning therapies,
and particularly corticosteroids (CCSs), the majority of
patients with more than 1 disease flare/year (25 out of 34,
73.5%) had received only low-systemic bioavailable corticosteroids (budesonide or beclomethasone per os or
enema) for relapse treatment during their IBD course,
while the remaining 9 patients had received systemic
CCSs. Seven patients (8.9%) had been on low-systemic
bioavailable steroids therapy for at least the previous
3 months before the first detection of steatosis and only 3
patients were taking budesonide at the time of steatosis
detection. Ongoing medications are detailed in Table 1.
Concerning the metabolic profile, MetS was more prevalent in patients who had stable clinical and endoscopic
remission for more than 6 months than in those with
active disease (30.8 vs. 7.7%, χ2
-square test p = 0.02).
Patients in clinical stable remission for more than
6 months had higher mean BMI compared to patients
with clinical activity in the previous 3 months (27.9 ± 4.5
Kg/m2 vs. 25.5 ± 4.9 Kg/m2
, p = 0.04).
Comparison of demographic and metabolic data of
patients with NAFLD and IBD vs. NAFLD without IBD
NAFLD patients with IBD were younger compared to
NAFLD w/o IBD (mean ± SD 51.2 ± 11.8 vs. 54.9 ± 12.5
years, p = 0.03) and were less likely to have altered liver
enzymes (42.3 vs. 57.9%, p = 0.03). Mean white blood cells
(WBCs), platelets (PLTs) and mean C-reactive protein
(CRP) were higher in IBD patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.001,
and p = 0.001, respectively) likely because of patients with
active disease within IBD group (Table 2).
Analyzing the clinical and metabolic profile, IBD
patients had lower mean (±SD) body weight (78.1 ± 13.3

Kg vs. 82. ± 15.8 Kg, p = 0.04), smaller mean waist circumference (97.7 ± 14 cm vs. 102 ± 14.5 cm, p = 0.04) and
lower BMI (28.6 ± 4.8 Kg/m2 vs. 30.2 ± 5.4 Kg/m2 p <
0.001); at the same time, they less often had hypertension,
reduced HDL cholesterol level and elevated fasting
plasma glucose. Mean total/LDL/HDL cholesterol and
triglycerides did not significantly differ between the two
groups. On the whole, MetS was more prevalent among
patients w/o IBD (56.6 vs. 23.1%, p < 0.001) (Table 3).
Risk factors for severe steatosis in IBD patients
NAFLD patients with severe IBD showed significantly
more often severe steatosis at US (grading S3) at the time
of the first detection of steatosis (32.1 vs. 16.6%, p = 0.01).
Stiffness measurement and APRI score did not significantly differ between the 2 groups.
To identify risk factors for severe (S3) US steatosis in
IBD patients, a binary logistic regression analysis considering intestinal-related and metabolic-related variables
was performed. Both at univariate and multivariate analysis, risk factors for severe US steatosis (grading S3) were:
more than 1 IBD relapse per year during disease history
(OR 17.3, 95% CI 3.6–84, p < 0.001), surgery for IBD (OR
15.1, 95% CI 3.1–73.7, p = 0.001), and more extensive
intestinal involvement (OR 19.4, 95% CI 3.4–110.9, p =
0.001). The diagnosis of MetS did not significantly relate
with severe grading of steatosis within such subgroup of
patients (Table 4).
Risk factors for altered liver enzymes in NAFLD + IBD
patients
Concerning the presence of altered liver enzymes (AST/
ALT), the most representative factors of the intestinal and
hepatic conditions were included in the regression logistic
model (Table 5).
At univariate analysis, severe steatosis (S3) (OR 3.5, 95%
CI 1.3–9.3, p = 0.01) and more extensive IBD (OR 3.2,
95% CI 1.2–8.1, p = 0.02) were risk factors for increased

AST/ALT, while the ongoing therapy with anti-Tumor
Necrosis Factor alpha (antiTNFɑ) antibodies showed a
protective effect (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0–0–8, p = 0.03). At
multivariate analysis, only ongoing antiTNFɑ therapy was
an independent protective factor for the presence of
altered liver enzymes (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0–0.8, p = 0.02).
Discussion
In this study, we compared NAFLD phenotype in
patients with and without IBD and we identified factors
associated, in the IBD population, with the presence of
severe steatosis and with increased AST/ALT levels: these
are potential determinants for progression of liver condition toward liver fibrosis and cirrhosis3–5,16.
Although NAFLD is typically related to MetS and dysregulated metabolism, it can be found also in IBD
patients, which generally have lower BMI and lower
prevalence of metabolic risk factors6
. As mentioned
above, a large study conducted on 928 IBD patients
identified small bowel surgery (OR 3.7), hypertension (OR
3.5), obesity (OR 2.1), and the use of CCSs at the time of
US examination (OR 3.7) as independent risk factors for
presence of NAFLD in patients with IBD7
. On the contrary, in our study CCS therapy did not predict the presence of severe steatosis among IBD patients. Systemic
CCSs notably cause liver steatosis by inhibiting
mitochondrial beta-oxidation and lipid beta-peroxidation
enzymes. However, the majority of IBD patients in our
study had received only low-systemic bioavailable CCSs,
such as budesonide, which have an extensive first pass
liver metabolism.
McGowan et al.6 had previously identified in the
improvement of therapies and nutritional status the cause
of increased BMI among IBD population, with a direct
relationship between prolonged remission, higher risk of
MetS and NAFLD development. More recently, Erzin
et al.17 did not find any difference between prevalence of
NAFLD in IBD and Irritable Bowel syndrome (IBS)
patients, assuming that the pathogenesis of steatosis and
steatohepatitis in patients with IBD was related more to
nutritional factors than to inflammatory load. Still, IBD
activity and its severity have been recently linked to
NAFLD development18–21: Bessissow et al. found that,
after adjusting for steroids treatment, age at IBD diagnosis
and use of antiTNFɑ drugs or methotrexate, the development of NAFLD was independently predicted by the
presence of active IBD (HR 1.58), disease duration (HR
1.12) and prior bowel surgery (HR 1.34), all surrogate
markers of severe disease10. None of these Authors,
however, compared NAFLD phenotype in patients with
and without IBD; this could help to better identify specific
features of NAFLD within IBD population and to find

predictors of bowel disease severity. In our study, patients
with NAFLD and IBD were younger than those w/o IBD,
had lower BMI and lower prevalence of MetS but more
often severe steatosis (S3) at US. Overall, these features
indicate that NAFLD in IBD patients is notably different
from what is observed in patients w/o IBD. According to
the severity of intestinal disease, we identified two different specific NAFLD-phenotypes within the IBD
population:
(1) The “mild” IBD patient, with less than one relapse
per year and mild-to-moderate steatosis at the
ultrasound (S1, S2), despite having one or more
metabolic risk factors, such as increased BMI and/
or MetS.
(2) The “severe” IBD patient, with more than one
relapse/year, more extensive disease, often with a
history of bowel surgery, and severe steatosis at
ultrasound (S3), but less metabolic risk factors.
In our view, more severe IBD promotes the development of severe liver fat accumulation. Severe liver steatosis further impairs bowel disease. Both IBD and NAFLD
are known to be associated to increased intestinal permeability: the translocation of bacterial antigens and DNA
throughout the portal system was recently observed in
patients with IBD, as well as in those with NAFLD22,23.
On the same line, of a relevant role played by increased
inflammation in NAFLD pathogenesis, is the finding of a
protective effect of antiTNFɑ drugs toward severe liver
steatosis. Therapy with antiTNFɑ was also the only
independent factor positively influencing altered liver
enzymes in such subgroup of patients. In a very recent
study, Carr et al.24 evaluated the influence of MetS on

NAFLD severity in patients with IBD. They showed that
MetS but not intestinal inflammation predicted NAFLD
severity in IBD patients. Particularly, they did not found
any significant difference in IBD medication use or in IBD
severity. However, they recognized that the majority of
IBD patients in their cohort (77%) had NAFLD in the
absence of MetS: this suggests that IBD patients develop
NAFLD because of an increased inflammatory load and
not because of metabolic risk factors.
The lack of histologic diagnosis of NAFLD is a limit of
our study: however, qualitative ultrasonography grading
of steatosis has already been validated in comparison with
histology. Particularly, with a cutoff value >25%, ultrasound was found to have sensitivities and specificities
ranging from 85.7 to 99.1% and from 85.2 to 91.9%,
respectively, for the detection of moderate or severe
hepatic steatosis25. Hernaez et al.26 confirmed through a
meta-analysis that US is an useful tool for diagnosis of
both moderate (S2) and severe (S3) steatosis (sensibility
and specificity 84.8 and 93.6%, respectively). Considering
our patients with severe steatosis, we can therefore
assume that this evaluation is an accurate marker of
NAFLD. Additionally, the recent guidelines of European
Association for the Study of Liver about the management
of NAFLD, reported that first-line diagnosis of NAFLD
should be done with US1
. Moreover, we strengthened our
study considering only US exams performed into a Third
level Center by an expert sonographer and confirming the
diagnosis by a second sonographer of exams reporting
first-degree (S1) steatosis.
In conclusion, IBD patients seem to develop different
NAFLD phenotypes according to intestinal disease clinical course. However, future prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether such specific NAFLD phenotypes
could have different prognostic course in this subgroup of
patients.
Patients and methods
Study design
The study was conducted at a single Centre, the Gastroenterology Unit of the University of Modena and
Reggio Emilia, Modena Hospital, Italy. All consecutive
patients evaluated at least one time at the NAFLD
Outpatient Clinic between March 2012 and March 2016
were assessed for eligibility. Patients with one or more of
the following criteria were excluded: lack of complete
clinical and demographic parameters; lack of at least one
sonographic and one hepatic stiffness evaluation with
transient elastography; hepatitis B surface antigen and/or
hepatitis C virus antibodies positivity; diagnosis of autoimmune hepatobiliary disease (primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, autoimmune
hepatitis), Wilson’s disease or hemochromatosis, according to European Association for the study of Liver
(EASL)27–30; pathological alcohol consumption, defined as
>20 g per day for women and >30 g per day for men1,31;
diagnosis of coeliac disease. For each patient, demographic and laboratory data, such as previous and ongoing
therapies were obtained from clinical reports.
Diagnostic criteria
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
patients were identified among patients with a primary
diagnosis of NAFLD according to the European Crohn’s
and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) criteria32,33; the Crohn’s
Disease Activity Index (CDAI) >150 for CD and the Mayo
score >2 for UC were used to stratifying IBD activity34,35.
According to the Montreal classification36, we defined
disease location for each IBD patient, describing the
“extensive disease” as the UC extended beyond the splenic
flexure (Montreal E2-E3) and the CD affecting >100 cm
in extent, regardless of the location32. Ongoing medications were: mesalamine (5ASA) or corticosteroids (CCSs)
only, 5ASA + CCSs, azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine
(AZA/6-MP), antiTNFɑ antibodies (infliximab or adalimumab) and others (cyclosporine, methotrexate).
The diagnosis of NAFLD was defined according to
EASL-EASD-EASO guidelines1
. Ultrasound imaging of
each patient were independently reviewed by two radiologists to grade steatosis (S), classified as mild (S1),
moderate (S2), or severe (S3), according to Saverymuttu
criteria37. All other causes of steatosis were excluded,
particularly alcohol abuse over 30 g per day and 20 g
per day for men and women respectively and concomitant
use of hepatotoxic drugs. The evaluation of liver fibrosis
was made according to liver stiffness measurement with

transient elastography38. The first available ultrasound
examination and/or liver stiffness measurement was
considered for each IBD and w/o IBD patients, prior to
any lifestyle, dietary and/or therapeutic intervention. The
APRI score was used to stratify patients for advanced
fibrosis39,40. Finally, the diagnosis of MetS was based on
the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria41,42.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were reported as mean (SD) and
categorical variables as number of cases and percentage.
Student’s t-test for independent data or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test were used to compare continuous variables; Pearson’s χ2
-test or two-tailed
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, when
appropriate; p level <0.05 was considered significant.
Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression
analysis was performed considering intestinal-related
(number of IBD relapses per year, disease extension,
small bowel surgery, and therapies) and metabolic-related
variables (diabetes, obesity, and diagnosis of metabolic
syndrome) to define predictors of severe steatosis and
altered liver enzymes in the subgroup of IBD patients. A
p-value <0.05 was considered significant for all tests. SPSS
software version 23.0 (Chicago, US) was used for statistical analyzes.
