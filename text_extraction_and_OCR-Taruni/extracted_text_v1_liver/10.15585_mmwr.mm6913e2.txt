Preliminary Estimates of the Prevalence of Selected Underlying Health 
Conditions Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 — United States, 
February 12–March 28, 2020
CDC COVID-19 Response Team
On March 31, 2020, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization 
declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic 
(1). As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed 
COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported 
worldwide (2). Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk 
factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of 
at least one of several underlying health conditions (3,4). U.S. 
older adults, including those aged ≥65 years and particularly 
those aged ≥85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe 
COVID-19–associated outcomes; however, data describing 
underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients 
have not yet been reported (5). As of March 28, 2020, U.S. 
states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 
cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on 
underlying health conditions and other known risk factors 
for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported. 
Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or 
more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 
(62.4%) had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health 
condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring 
intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and 
those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 
of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%). The most commonly reported 
conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and 
cardiovascular disease. These preliminary findings suggest that 
in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions 
or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease 
from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.
Data from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported 
to CDC from 50 states, four U.S. territories and affiliated 
islands, the District of Columbia, and New York City with 
February 12–March 28, 2020 onset dates were analyzed. Cases 
among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, 
China, and the Diamond Princess cruise ship were excluded. 
For cases with missing onset dates, date of onset was estimated 
by subtracting 4 days (median interval from symptom onset 
to specimen collection date among cases with known dates in 
these data) from the earliest specimen collection. Public health 
departments reported cases to CDC using a standardized case 
report form that captures information (yes, no, or unknown) 
on the following conditions and potential risk factors: chronic 
lung disease (inclusive of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and emphysema); diabetes mellitus; 
cardiovascular disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver 
disease; immunocompromised condition; neurologic disorder, 
neurodevelopmental, or intellectual disability; pregnancy; current smoking status; former smoking status; or other chronic 
disease (6). Data reported to CDC are preliminary and can be 
updated by health departments over time; critical data elements 
might be missing at the time of initial report; thus, this analysis 
is descriptive, and no statistical comparisons could be made.
The percentages of patients of all ages with underlying health 
conditions who were not hospitalized, hospitalized without 
ICU admission, and hospitalized with ICU admission were 
calculated. Percentages of hospitalizations with and without 
ICU admission were estimated for persons aged ≥19 years with 
and without underlying health conditions. This part of the 
analysis was limited to persons aged ≥19 years because of the 
small sample size of cases in children with reported underlying 
health conditions (N = 32). To account for missing data among 
these preliminary reports, ranges were estimated with a lower 
bound including cases with both known and unknown status 
for hospitalization with and without ICU admission as the 
denominator and an upper bound using only cases with known 
outcome status as the denominator. Because of small sample 
size and missing data on underlying health conditions among 
COVID-19 patients who died, case-fatality rates for persons 
with and without underlying conditions were not estimated.
As of March 28, 2020, a total of 122,653 laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure) and 2,112 deaths were 
reported to CDC. Case report forms were submitted to CDC 
for 74,439 (60.7%) cases. Data on presence or absence of 
underlying health conditions and other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections (i.e., 
smoking and pregnancy) were available for 7,162 (5.8%) 
patients (Table 1). Approximately one third of these patients 
(2,692, 37.6%), had at least one underlying condition or risk 
factor. Diabetes mellitus (784, 10.9%), chronic lung disease 
(656, 9.2%), and cardiovascular disease (647, 9.0%) were the 

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

most frequently reported conditions among all cases. Among 
457 ICU admissions and 1,037 non-ICU hospitalizations, 
358 (78%) and 732 (71%), respectively occurred among 
persons with one or more reported underlying health condition. In contrast, 1,388 of 5,143 (27%) COVID-19 patients 
who were not hospitalized were reported to have at least one 
underlying health condition.
Among patients aged ≥19 years, the percentage of non-ICU 
hospitalizations was higher among those with underlying 
health conditions (27.3%–29.8%) than among those without 
underlying health conditions (7.2%–7.8%); the percentage 
of cases that resulted in an ICU admission was also higher 
for those with underlying health conditions (13.3%–14.5%) 
than those without these conditions (2.2%–2.4%) (Table 2). 
Small numbers of COVID-19 patients aged <19 years were 
reported to be hospitalized (48) or admitted to an ICU (eight). 
In contrast, 335 patients aged <19 years were not hospitalized 
and 1,342 had missing data on hospitalization. Among all 
COVID-19 patients with complete information on underlying conditions or risk factors, 184 deaths occurred (all among 
patients aged ≥19 years); 173 deaths (94%) were reported 
among patients with at least one underlying condition. 
Discussion
Among 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to CDC as 
of March 28, 2020, 7,162 (5.8%) patients had data available 
pertaining to underlying health conditions or potential risk factors; among these patients, higher percentages of patients with 
underlying conditions were admitted to the hospital and to 
an ICU than patients without reported underlying conditions. 
These results are consistent with findings from China and Italy, 
which suggest that patients with underlying health conditions 
and risk factors, including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, COPD, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, chronic renal disease, and smoking, might be at higher 
risk for severe disease or death from COVID-19 (3,4). This 
analysis was limited by small numbers and missing data because 
of the burden placed on reporting health departments with 
rapidly rising case counts, and these findings might change as 
additional data become available.
It is not yet known whether the severity or level of control 
of underlying health conditions affects the risk for severe disease associated with COVID-19. Many of these underlying 
health conditions are common in the United States: based on 
self-reported 2018 data, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes 
among U.S. adults was 10.1% (7), and the U.S. age-adjusted 
prevalence of all types of heart disease (excluding hypertension 
without other heart disease) was 10.6% in 2017 (8). The ageadjusted prevalence of COPD among U.S. adults is 5.9% (9), 
and in 2018, the U.S. estimated prevalence of current asthma 
among persons of all ages was 7.9% (7). CDC continues to 
develop and update resources for persons with underlying

health conditions to reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19 
(10). The estimated higher prevalence of these conditions 
among those in this early group of U.S. COVID-19 patients 
and the potentially higher risk for more severe disease from 
COVID-19 associated with the presence of underlying conditions highlight the importance of COVID-19 prevention in 
persons with underlying conditions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, these data are preliminary, and the analysis was 
limited by missing data related to the health department 
reporting burden associated with rapidly rising case counts 
and delays in completion of information requiring medical 
chart review; these findings might change as additional data 
become available. Information on underlying conditions was 
only available for 7,162 (5.8%) of 122,653 cases reported to 
CDC. It cannot be assumed that those with missing information are similar to those with data on either hospitalizations or 
underlying health conditions. Second, these data are subject 
to bias in outcome ascertainment because of short follow-up 
time. Some outcomes might be underestimated, and long-term

outcomes cannot be assessed in this analysis. Third, because of 
the limited availability of testing in many jurisdictions during 
this period, this analysis is likely biased toward more severe 
cases, and findings might change as testing becomes more 
widespread. Fourth, because of the descriptive nature of these 
data, attack rates among persons with and without underlying 
health conditions could not be compared, and thus the risk 
difference of severe disease with COVID-19 between these 
groups could not be estimated. Fifth, no conclusions could be 
drawn about underlying conditions that were not included in 
the case report form or about different conditions that were 
reported in a single, umbrella category. For example, asthma 
and COPD were included in a chronic lung disease category. 
Finally, for some underlying health conditions and risk factors, 
including neurologic disorders, chronic liver disease, being 
a current smoker, and pregnancy, few severe outcomes were 
reported; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the 
risk for severe COVID-19 among persons in these groups.
Persons in the United States with underlying health conditions appear to be at higher risk for more severe COVID-19, 
consistent with findings from other countries. Persons 
with underlying health conditions who have symptoms of 
COVID-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath, 
should immediately contact their health care provider. 
These persons should take steps to protect themselves from 
COVID-19, through washing their hands; cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces; and social distancing, including 
staying at home, avoiding crowds, gatherings, and travel, and 
avoiding contact with persons who are ill. Maintaining at least 
a 30-day supply of medication, a 2-week supply of food and 
other necessities, and knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms 
are recommended for those with underlying health conditions (10). All persons should take steps to protect themselves 
from COVID-19 and to protect others. All persons who are 
ill should stay home, except to get medical care; should not go 
to work; and should stay away from others. This is especially 
important for those who work with persons with underlying 
conditions or who otherwise are at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. Community mitigation strategies, 
which aim to slow the spread of COVID-19, are important to 
protect all persons from COVID-19, especially persons with 
underlying health conditions and other persons at risk for 
severe COVID-19–associated disease (https://www.cdc.gov/
coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigationstrategy.pdf).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Published reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors 
for severe COVID-19 disease include underlying health conditions, but data describing underlying health conditions among 
U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported.
What is added by this report?
Based on preliminary U.S. data, persons with underlying health 
conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, 
and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for 
severe COVID-19–associated disease than persons without 
these conditions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Strategies to protect all persons and especially those with 
underlying health conditions, including social distancing and 
handwashing, should be implemented by all communities and 
all persons to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
