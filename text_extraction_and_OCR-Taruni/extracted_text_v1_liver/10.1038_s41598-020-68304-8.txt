Insufcient real-world data on acute liver injury (ALI) risk associated with oral anticoagulants (OACs)
exist in patients with nonvalvular atrial fbrillation (NVAF). Using the French national healthcare
databases, a propensity-weighted nationwide cohort study was performed in NVAF patients initiating
OACs from 2011 to 2016, considering separately those (1) with no prior liver disease (PLD) as main
population, (2) with PLD, (3) with a history of chronic alcoholism.A Cox proportional hazards model
was used to estimate the hazard ratio with 95% confdence interval (HR [95% CI]) of seriousALI
(hospitalisedALI or liver transplantation) during the frst year of treatment, for each non-vitamin
K antagonist (VKA) oral anticoagulant (NOAC: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) versusVKA. In
patients with no PLD (N= 434,015), only rivaroxaban new users were at increased risk of seriousALI
compared toVKA initiation (adjusted HR: 1.41 [1.05–1.91]). In patients with chronic alcoholism history
(N= 13,173), only those initiating dabigatran were at increased risk of seriousALI compared toVKA
(2.88 [1.74–4.76]) but an ancillary outcome suggested that diferential clinical follow-up between
groups might partly explain this association. In conclusion, this study does not suggest an increase of
the 1-year risk ofALI in NOAC versusVKA patients withAF.
Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) use has increased dramatically worldwide over the last 
5 years since their introduction for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fbrillation (NVAF)1
. Te 
European guidelines now recommend NOACs in preference to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in these patients2
. 
With increasing AF prevalence3
 and, as a more convenient alternative to VKAs4, NOAC prescription should 
continue to increase. Careful monitoring of their safety profle apart from their well-known bleeding adverse 
events is therefore needed in clinical practice, especially regarding rare adverse events that cannot be observed 
in randomized clinical trials (RCT)5
.
Following market withdrawal of ximelagatran, the frst orally available direct thrombin inhibitor, due to 
reports of severe liver injury6
, post-marketing data including pharmacovigilance reports have raised concerns 
about the potential hepatotoxicity of other NOACs7–9
. While all NOACs undergo varying degrees of hepatic 
metabolism, with much lower hepatic metabolism for dabigatran10, cases of drug-induced liver injury, albeit rare 
and of varying severity, have been reported with dabigatran11, rivaroxaban12 and apixaban13. Although VKAs 
have been marketed for decades, acute liver failure has been rarely reported14,15. Only two published cohort studies based on claims data have compared NOAC and VKA therapies in terms of liver injuries16,17. Both studies 
defned liver injury as a mix of hospitalised acute and chronic (or unspecifed) liver injuries and their estimates

were based on small numbers of cases, leading to wide confdence intervals. Results of these observational studies 
contrasted with those reported from postmarketing pharmacovigilance data18,19. Furthermore, the risk of liver 
injury associated with oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapies has never been assessed in patients with concomitant 
AF and chronic alcoholism, which may concern about 1.9–7.5% of AF patients according to EORP-AF and EHS 
registry data20,21.
Due to the insufcient real-world data on liver injury risk associated with each type of oral anticoagulants to 
make informed choices in clinical practice, we therefore investigated the risk of serious acute liver injury (ALI) 
associated with OAC use and compared this risk between each NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and 
VKAs in AF patients, with no prior liver disease and also in those with prior liver disease and those with a history of chronic alcoholism.
Methods
Data sources. Tis observational study was conducted using data from the largest scheme (‘Régime général’, around 54 million benefciaries) of the French national healthcare database (Système National des Données 
de Santé, SNDS). Te SNDS database contains comprehensive data on health spending reimbursements and 
provides detailed medical information on all hospitalisations in France (see Supplementary Table 1). It has been 
previously described and used in pharmacoepidemiology research22,23, including in the feld of gastrointestinal 
and liver diseases24,25.
Study population and study design. First, a cohort of OAC new users was identifed among patients 
with ‘Régime général’ health insurance coverage for at least 5 years (the calendar year of the index date and 
the previous 5 years) as those who initiated OAC therapy (all doses) with VKAs, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or 
apixaban (no reimbursement for any OAC, either VKA or NOAC, in the previous 24 months) between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2016 (see design diagram in Supplementary Figure 1). A patient’s index date was 
the date of frst OAC reimbursement during this period. Te cohort of OAC new users was further restricted to 
those treated for NVAF: (1) patients treated for other OAC indications, i.e. patients with a history of deep vein 
thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) or who had undergone lower limb orthopaedic procedures during the six-week pre-index period, were excluded; (2) OAC new users treated for AF were identifed from the 
resulting cohort as the sum of “OAC new users with confrmed AF”, identifed directly by using the International 
Classifcation of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) I48 diagnosis code or specifc AF management procedures, and 
“OAC new users with probable AF”, for outpatients identifed using an algorithm discriminating AF from DVT/
PE with 95% specifcity26; (3) NVAF patients were identifed by excluding patients with a history of prosthetic 
heart valve or chronic rheumatic heart disease.
Second, patients presenting contraindications to OAC therapy, currently or recently treated for cancer or 
treated for HIV infection, were excluded.
Finally, for the main analysis, the resulting cohort was restricted to patients with no history of liver disease 
during a 5-year pre-index period, including alcoholic liver disease, chronic hepatitis or disorders of copper or 
iron metabolism. Codes used for identifcation of the study population are shown in Supplementary Table 2.
Additional populations. Two additional study populations were defned from the incident cohort of OAC new 
users with NVAF: (1) patients with prior liver disease; (2) patients treated/hospitalised for chronic alcoholism in 
the 1-year rolling period before OAC initiation. Te exact level of alcohol consumption and the patient’s history 
of alcoholism are not available in the French healthcare databases. Chronic alcoholism was therefore defned by 
using proxies (see defnition in the Supplementary Table 2).
Exposure. NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and VKA (fuindione, warfarin and acenocoumarol) 
therapies were identifed using codes from the Anatomical Terapeutic Chemical (ATC) classifcation; edoxaban 
was not available during the period considered. A 30-day coverage period was attributed to any date of OAC 
reimbursement, including VKA.
Outcome. Te outcome of interest was serious ALI. Patients were considered to present this outcome when 
they had been hospitalised for liver transplantation (French procedure classifcation system, codes HLEA001, 
HLEA002) or presented one of the following ICD-10 diagnosis codes (considering only the principal discharge 
code): non-chronic toxic liver disease (K71.0, K71.1, K71.2, K71.6, K71.8, K71.9), non-chronic hepatic failure (K72.0, K72.9), nonspecifc reactive hepatitis (K75.2), unspecifed infammatory liver disease (K75.9) or 
unspecifed jaundice (R17). Te use of these specifc hospital codes, has been shown to maximize validity of ALI 
cases in a study based on four European healthcare data sources27,28. Only the frst hospitalisation for ALI was 
considered during the follow-up period.
Regular International Normalised Ratio (INR) testing is performed in VKA patients, while no anticoagulation 
monitoring is needed in NOAC patients. Laboratory monitoring of toxic liver damage by transaminase assays 
(aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) was therefore used as an ancillary outcome to try to assess the potential 
role of diferential anticoagulation blood monitoring in the early detection of ALI and to help to interpret results 
from cases of hospitalised ALI. As the French healthcare databases do not contain laboratory test results, a proxy 
for elevation of transaminases was used: a patient was considered to have elevation of transaminases when he/
she presented consecutive reimbursements for serum transaminase assays (French laboratory test classifcation 
system codes 0.516, 0.517, 0.522) on at least three diferent dates over a 30-day period during follow-up.

Covariates. Baseline covariates included sociodemographics, comorbidities, comedications and healthcare 
utilization proxies29, as listed in Table 1 and defned in Supplementary Table 2. In particular, a list of potential hepatotoxic drugs was considered at baseline30,31, including paracetamol, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 
rifampicin (see Supplementary Table 3).
Data analysis. All analyses were performed for both the main and the ancillary outcome.
Intention‑to‑treat analysis. Patients were followed for up to 360 days from the day afer the index date until the 
outcome considered, death from any cause, or 31 December 2016, whichever came frst.
For each type of NOAC, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 
its 95% confdence interval (95%CI) for the outcome considered with VKA as the reference group. To control 
for confounding by baseline covariates, HRs were adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting 
(IPTW). Weights were calculated for each analysis and based on the propensity score (PS), which was estimated 
by a logistic regression model including all baseline covariates and predicting the probability of receiving the 
type of NOAC considered.
Te balance in baseline covariates was compared using standardized diferences, before and afer weighting32.
Crude and IPTW-adjusted non-parametric cumulative incidence curves were estimated (i.e. 1 minus 
Kaplan–Meier estimator of the survival curve) and plotted and their 95%CI were determined by bootstrap 
analysis with 200 replications.
To check for possible variations, the association between NOAC use and the outcome considered was assessed 
in pre-defned subgroups, according to sex, age (patients aged 80 years or over), type of NOAC dose (standard 
versus reduced) at initiation, risk factor for liver disease (obesity or baseline comedication with a potentially 
hepatotoxic drug), as well as in patients at increased risk of bleeding (i.e. with an HAS-BLED score≥3, adapted 
to claims data) and in frail patients.
Sensitivity analyses. Several sensitivity analyses were performed for the main study population. First, the 
main intention-to-treat analysis was further adjusted for history of alcoholism (see defnition in Supplementary 
Table 2) in the year prior OAC initiation. Second, sensitivity with respect to the handling of extreme weights 
was explored by modifying initial weight truncation33 and by using asymmetric PS trimming34 (All details in 
Supplementary Table 4).
Tird, we restricted the outcome defnition (1) by excluding the R17 ICD-10 code from the primary list of the 
codes searched (2) by restricting the defnition to acute or subacute toxic ALI (i.e. K71.0, K71.1, K71.2, K72.0) 
or liver transplantation only.
Finally, a per-protocol analysis was performed to try to avoid bias due to potential diferential adherence to 
the drugs compared: follow-up was additionally censored at the time of switch between the four OAC therapies 
(OAC dose variations were not considered) and at treatment discontinuation (identifed by a 60-day gap with 
no medication coverage, with the additional criterion of no reimbursement for INR monitoring during this gap 
for VKA patients).
All calculations were performed using SAS, version 9.4 sofware (SAS Institute Inc.). P < 0.05 (two-tailed) 
was considered to be statistically signifcant.
Ethics approval. Tis observational study based on the French healthcare databases was approved by the 
French Data Protection Agency (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés, Cnil) and did not 
require patient consent or ethics committee approval. Patients and or public were not involved.
Results
Patient selection and characteristics. Te main study population comprised 434,015 OAC new users 
with NVAF and no contraindication to OAC therapy and no prior liver disease, corresponding to 220,367 VKA, 
51,737 dabigatran, 99,408 rivaroxaban and 62,503 apixaban new users. Te main reasons for ineligibility were 
other indications or uncertain identifcation of the indication for OAC therapy (Fig. 1). Before weighting, in 
the main study population, i.e. in patients with no history of liver disease, NOAC new users were younger and 
had fewer comorbidities than VKA new users (See Supplementary Table 5). Across all variables included in the 
PS, the standardized diferences ranged from −0.54 to +0.40 for the dabigatran/VKA cohort, −0.55 to +0.46 
for the rivaroxaban/VKA cohort and −0.59 to +0.37 for the apixaban/VKA cohort. Recent history of chronic 
alcoholism was identifed for 2.6% of VKA new users and 2.0% of each cohort of NOAC new users with no 
history of liver disease. During the 1-year follow-up period, discontinuing OAC treatment (switching between 
OAC therapies) occurred in 21.6% (8.4%), 26.5% (18.7%), 26.2% (12.6%) and 20.5% (7.8%) of VKA, dabigatran, 
rivaroxaban and apixaban new users, respectively.
Te two additional study populations, chosen among the OAC new users with NVAF, comprised 12,961 
patients with a history of liver disease and 13,173 patients with a history of chronic alcoholism, respectively 
(Fig. 1). Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 display the baseline characteristics of these populations.
Main study population: OAC new users with NVAF and no prior liver disease. Table 1 displays 
the baseline characteristics of each OAC group afer weighting; all standardized diferences ranged from −0.08 
to +0.06, indicating a good balance between treatment groups (see also Supplementary Table 4).

Association between OAC initiation and hospitalised ALI (main outcome). During follow-up, a total of 218 of 
the 434,015 OAC new users were hospitalised for ALI (see details in Supplementary Table 8), including one case 
of liver transplantation in each of the VKA and dabigatran groups, corresponding to crude and IPTW-adjusted 
cumulative 1-year incidences reported in Table 2.
Compared with the use of VKAs, no increased risk of hospitalised ALI was observed for new users of dabigatran (adjusted HR, aHR: 1.17; 95%CI [0.79–1.75]) and apixaban (0.82 [0.53–1.25]), while an increased risk 
was observed in rivaroxaban new users (1.41 [1.05–1.91]) (Table 2, Fig. 2; curves in Supplementary Figure 2).
Results of subgroup analyses (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 9) were comparable to those of the entire cohort 
for the dabigatran and apixaban cohorts. For rivaroxaban patients, results were statistically signifcant only in 
patients initiating NOAC standard dose, those with no hepatotoxic drug at initiation and those at increased risk 
of bleeding (i.e. with an HAS-BLED score ≥3, adapted to claims data ).
Association between OAC initiation and elevation of transaminases (ancillary outcome). No association was 
observed between rivaroxaban (aHR: 0.97; 95%CI [0.93–1.01]) or apixaban (1.01 [0.96–1.06]) initiation and 
elevation of transaminases (proxy) compared to initiation of VKAs. Initiating dabigatran versus VKA therapy 
was associated with a reduced risk of elevation of transaminases (0.85 [0.81–0.90]). Similar results were observed 
in all subgroup analyses (Table 2; Supplementary Table 9).

Te reduced risk and the non-signifcant trend towards reduced risk observed for dabigatran and rivaroxaban new users, respectively, contrasted with the increased risk (non-signifcant and signifcant, respectively) 
previously observed for hospitalised ALI. For apixaban analyses, the non-signifcant trend toward a reduced 
risk of hospitalised ALI difered from the null risk (or slightly increased risk in some subgroups), observed for 
elevation of transaminases.
Sensitivity analyses. Results of sensitivity analyses are reported in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 9.
Consistent results regarding the risk of hospitalised ALI were observed for the comparisons between dabigatran and apixaban versus VKA new users. All but one of the estimates of the association with hospitalised ALI 
were non-signifcant for the comparison between rivaroxaban and VKA cohorts. A trend towards an inverse, 
protective association was observed for the dabigatran and rivaroxaban cohorts when restricting the outcome 
defnition to toxic ALI or liver transplantation only.
Te results for elevation of transaminases were very similar to the estimates of the main analyses for all types 
of OAC comparisons.
Additional study populations: OAC new users with NVAF and prior liver disease or with a his‑
tory of chronic alcoholism. Table 3 presents the results for each population. Overall, only a few cases 
of hospitalised ALI were observed and incidence of hospitalised ALI was higher in both groups compared to 
the incidences observed in the cohort of patients with no prior liver disease. Protective associations or trends 
towards a protective association were observed for the risk of hospitalised ALI in both cohorts for rivaroxaban 
and apixaban, versus VKA. In patients with a history of chronic alcoholism, only initiating dabigatran versus 
VKA therapy was associated with an increased risk of hospitalised ALI (aHR: 2.88; 95%CI [1.74–4.76]), with a 
signifcantly lower risk of elevation of transaminases (0.53 [0.38–0.75]).
Discussion
Main fndings. In this large cohort study based on health data for nearly 450,000 OAC new users with 
NVAF, hospitalised ALI was rare and the incidence of ALI was much higher in patients with a history of liver 
disease or alcoholism than in those with no history of liver disease.
No increased risk of hospitalised ALI was observed among NOAC patients during the frst year afer OAC 
initiation compared to those initiating VKA therapy, except in patients with no history of liver disease initiating rivaroxaban (association no longer signifcant in sensitivity analyses) and those with a history of chronic 
alcoholism initiating dabigatran.
Comparison with post‑marketing literature. Unlike studies based on pharmacovigilance data that 
found an increased risk of ALI for NOACs, especially for rivaroxaban7,8
, the two studies based on administrative 
data published so far, found no increased risk of liver injury with NOAC versus VKA16. Overall, the results of this 
study that focused exclusively on ALI, are reassuring and consistent with those of these two observational studies and with clinical trial data35. However, in the main analysis, an increased risk was observed in rivaroxaban

patients with no prior liver disease compared to VKA patients. Tis positive association was no longer observed 
when using trimming or modifed weight truncation, suggesting that the risk diference in the main analysis was 
mainly due to a very small number of patients treated contrary to the prediction.
Comparison between results of the main and ancillary outcomes. With the ancillary outcome, 
a proxy for elevation of transaminases, a protective association for dabigatran and a trend towards a protective association for rivaroxaban were observed in the main population, but no association was observed for 
apixaban. Tese results could actually refect the diferential frequency of contact with the healthcare system 
between NOAC and VKA therapy (no regular blood monitoring needed for NOAC patients in contrast with 
VKA patients), but also between the various NOAC (channelling of dabigatran and rivaroxaban towards less 
severe patients compared to apixaban, or when compared to VKA therapy). Closer clinical follow-up of VKA 
patients may have led to earlier detection and monitoring of some cases of ALI, which may have prevented 
hospitalisation. It could constitute another partial explanation for the slightly increased risk of hospitalised ALI

observed in the main population for rivaroxaban, together with a protective association for the ancillary outcome. Tis explanation could also apply to the increased risk of ALI observed in dabigatran patients with a history of chronic alcoholism, among whom the strongest signifcant protective association was observed for the 
ancillary outcome, while consistent results were observed afer PS trimming. Furthermore, patients who experienced the ancillary outcome in the main analysis were more than tenfold likely to be hospitalised for ALI and 
liver imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography or MRI scan) was performed in 37.2% of these patients during 
the 180-day period following the frst of the three consecutive blood tests for transaminases (data not shown).
Strengths and limitations. Although the risk of confounding by indication is limited in this study evaluating unwanted side efects of treatment, channelling bias due to preferential prescription of NOAC over VKA 
towards younger and less severe patients was observed. Analyses were therefore adjusted by using the IPTW 
method within an active comparator new user design36. IPTW is also known to be useful in the case of rare 
outcomes such as ALI37.
Although the PS included covariates associated with the patients’ functional and cognitive status or healthcare 
system consumption, residual confounding by unmeasured or incompletely captured factors, such as frailty, 
alcohol consumption or healthcare and sociocultural behaviours, cannot be excluded. Weight truncation and

PS trimming as well as numerous restrictions were therefore used to improve comparability of patients and try 
to further reduce unmeasured confounding34,38, leading to similar conclusions. As intention-to-treat analysis 
may bias estimates towards the null value, outcomes were assessed during a short 1-year follow-up period and 
a per-protocol analysis was also performed with IPTCW adjustment.
We consider the use of the ancillary outcome to be a strength of this study, as it helped us to better interpret 
the results observed for hospitalised ALI. It could be useful to consider this type of tool in future comparative 
studies between NOAC and VKA before drawing any conclusions.
As with many other claims databases, the actual patient consumption of reimbursed drugs cannot be verifed. 
None of the ICD-10 codes used to defne ALI have been validated in the SNDS database, with the corresponding 
risk of misclassifcation. However, our outcome defnition was restricted to acute liver outcomes identifed exclusively by a principal hospital discharge code, which should have maximized the validity of the identifed cases of 
ALI, especially in patients with no prior liver disease, as suggested by studies based on other databases27,28. Te 
results of the sensitivity analyses using narrower ALI defnitions were also in line with those of the main analyses.
Tis is the frst observational study to assess the comparative risk of ALI in the cohort of patients with a 
history of chronic alcoholism. However, this cohort, as well as the cohort of patients with prior liver disease, 
comprised small sample sizes. Te results, based on very small numbers of cases, should therefore be interpreted 
cautiously and in the light of the potential beneft of NOAC therapy in patients with cirrhosis39.
Finally, our results regarding the comparative risk of ALI in the various cohorts cannot be extrapolated beyond 
the frst year afer OAC initiation.
Conclusion
Overall, the results of this large cohort study based on the French healthcare database do not suggest an increased 
risk of ALI in NOAC patients with NVAF compared to VKA patients in the frst year afer treatment initiation, 
irrespective of a history of liver disease. Te risk of ALI, as a potential adverse drug reaction, may therefore not 
justify preferring one particular OAC therapy rather than another in these patients. Diferential clinical monitoring between NOAC and VKA patients might partly explain the increased risk of ALI observed in dabigatran 
patients with a history of chronic alcoholism.
