ABSTRACT
Background: Intestinal allograft rejection resembles
Crohn’s disease clinically and pathologically. An understanding of its mechanism could impact this life-saving
procedure, as well as provide insight into the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. The NOD2 protein
has been implicated as a key player in intestinal immune
health, as a consequence of the discovery of three
polymorphisms linked with Crohn’s disease. An investigation was carried out to determine whether epithelial
immune function and graft survival were influenced by
NOD2 mutations in an intestinal transplant population.
Methods: The NOD2 genotypes of 34 transplants
performed consecutively over the past 3 years were
determined. The NOD2 genotypes were related to clinical
outcomes and the expression of certain intestinal
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) believed to protect the
epithelium.
Results: An unexpectedly high percentage of recipients,
35%, possessed NOD2 polymorphisms, while 8.6% of
donors had comparable mutations. The likelihood of
allograft failure was about 100-fold higher in recipients
with mutant NOD2 alleles compared with recipients with
wild-type NOD2 loci. Rejection in NOD2 mutant recipients
was characterised by decreased expression of certain
Paneth cell and enterocyte AMPs, prior to the onset of
epithelial injury and inflammation.
Conclusions: Crohn’s disease-associated polymorphisms
in the NOD2 gene in the recipient represent a critical
immunological risk factor for intestinal allograft rejection.
Compromised epithelial defences precede visible epithelial
injury and inflammatory infiltration. The association of
impaired epithelial immunity with the recipient’s genotype
suggests that certain NOD2-expressing cells of haematopoietic origin play a role in the process, perhaps by
regulating expression of certain epithelial AMPs within the
allograft.
The NOD2 gene product has recently been
recognised to play an important role in the
immune health of the small intestine. The discovery arose from efforts to identify genes that
were associated with Crohn’s disease (CD), a
disorder in which intestinal inflammation is
provoked by commensal bacteria. NOD2 is an
intracellular microbial sensor present in macrophages, dendritic cells and certain intestinal
epithelial cells, including Paneth cells.1–3 Several
alleles in the NOD2 locus have been identified as
potentially functionally abnormal, and the risk of
having CD increases between 2- and 40-fold
depending on the genotype of the individual.4–8
Studies in both mouse and man have linked the
presence of NOD2 CD-associated polymorphisms
with impaired expression of certain Paneth cellderived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)9 10 in individuals with the ileal form of CD.11–13 The
hypothesis proposes that the presence of impaired
NOD2 sensors results in the failure to regulate
intestinal epithelial AMPs effectively; subsequent
epithelial damage caused by commensal microbes
results in a secondary tissue-destructive inflammatory response.
More than 600 people worldwide have received a
small intestinal allograft over the past 15 years for
intestinal failure following surgical resection or
functional intestinal anomalies.14–18 About 60% of
the recipients are infants and children younger
than 15 years for whom the allograft provides the
only remaining means to deliver adequate nutritional support required for growth.14 18 19 Graft
failure secondary to rejection occurs in about 30–
40% of transplants within the first 3 years postoperatively. Efforts continue to define optimal
strategies to increase survival of the allograft.
Small intestinal allograft rejection is characterised
by intestinal crypt cell damage and apoptosis,
invasion of the lamina propria by lymphocytes and
macrophages, and, in later stages, luminal epithelial
ulceration or complete destruction, reminiscent of
some of the pathological characteristics of both CD
and graft versus host disease.20 21
These reports prompted us to examine whether
an association existed between the presence of
NOD2 CD-linked polymorphisms in our transplant population and transplant outcome. We
hypothesised that the presence of a NOD2 polymorphism in the recipient might influence the
viability of the allograft by interrupting NOD2-
dependent circuits required to maintain intestinal
homeostasis with respect to commensal flora.
Outcomes that were selected for assessment
included the first episode of severe rejection and
time to graft failure post-transplantation.
Furthermore, we speculated that damage to the
intestinal epithelium of a healthy bowel (recognised as ‘‘rejection’’) would be more likely to occur
in a recipient lacking a functional intestinal
microbial-sensing system than in a recipient with
an intact system, and that the damage would be
more severe pathologically.
We further questioned whether the presence of a
NOD2 polymorphism was associated with alteration in the expression of Paneth cell and enterocyte
AMP genes of the allograft after implantation, a

deficiency in epithelial innate immunity observed in CD.
METHODS
Study population
Between May 2002, the date when the intestinal transplant
programme began, and November 2006, 34 consecutive patients
underwent small intestinal transplantation at the Georgetown
University Hospital under the direction of a single surgeon (TF).
The study population includes every individual who received an
intestinal allograft at our institution, with the last patient
included having about 4 months postsurgical time. DNA
samples suitable for genotyping, tissue specimens, along with
complete clinical information from recipients and donor organs
were obtained with approval of the Georgetown University
Institutional Review Board. The authors were responsible for
the design of the study, assembly and analysis of the data, and
the writing of the manuscript.
The study described in this report began in mid-2005 after
about 20 patients had been transplanted. The transplantation
protocol and all postoperative management procedures were not
altered by the initiation of this study and thus remained fixed
for the entire group of 34 patients. All individuals involved in
patient management were unaware of the NOD2 genotypes of
the recipients and donors.
The following clinical data were collected on all recipients:
age, sex, race, serological evidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) or
Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection, the primary cause of
intestinal failure, organs transplanted in addition to the small
intestine, the duration of cold ischaemia, the number of
episodes of rejection, the histological severity of rejection, the
number of episodes of infection and responsible organisms, the
loss of the graft, and vital status, with the cause of death
established. Donor information included age, sex, race, CMV
and EBV status. Donor organs were all from heart-beating
cadaveric donors who suffered irreversible brain injury but who
had normal bowel function and no history of gastrointestinal
disease. Recipients were individuals who suffered intestinal
failure and lifelong dependence on parenteral nutrition. One
patient was retransplanted after the loss of the first allograft.
The majority had short bowel syndrome, having required
massive surgical resection of the small intestine due to a variety
of common paediatric and adult diseases. Other patients
suffered either functional disorders of motility or had desmoid
tumours associated with familial adenomatous polyposis
(table 1). Our population did not differ with respect to the
reasons for transplantation from the experience of other
centres.15 17 22 23
The basic transplantation protocol has been described in
detail elsewhere.14 18 19 Rejection was routinely treated with
pulsed steroid and augmented tacrolimus therapy when mild,
and with antilymphocyte agents when more severe, as clinically
indicated. Bacterial decontamination of the intestine was
performed when signs of systemic toxaemia accompanied
rejection. Endoscopic biopsy evaluations and symptom evaluation guided daily management decisions.
Evaluation of allograft rejection
Endoscopic mucosal pinch biopsies were taken at transplant
protocol-specified time points and additionally whenever
clinically indicated. Patients consented to additional biopsy
material being collected simultaneously for the purpose of
evaluation of the expression of AMPs. Biopsy samples were
fixed, paraffin embedded and stained with H&E. Biopsies were
then examined by one of two pathologists unaware of the
NOD2 status of the patient and scored using standard rejection
grading criteria.15 24 25
Amongst the earliest microscopic signs of acute small bowel
rejection are apoptotic cells within the crypts, increasing in
number/crypt as rejection progresses (fig 1A,B). As the severity
of rejection increases, villous blunting is seen, followed by
invasion of the lamina propria and crypt of inflammatory cells,
with eventual mucosal erosion (fig 1C–F). ‘‘Severe rejection’’ as
referred to in this report describes pathology characterised by
extensive mucosal ulceration and inflammatory infiltration of
the lamina propria. Episodes of rejection separated by .30 days
with an intervening period characterised by normal histology
were considered as independent events.
Tissue sample collection
Grasp biopsies were obtained from allograft mucosa during
either endoscopy of the ileal stoma or colonoscopy following
stoma takedown, generally between 10 and 30 cm from the
ileocolonic anastomosis. In patients with ileal ulceration or
other pathologies, biopsies were targeted to regions of intact
mucosa. Samples of pre-reperfusion donor small bowels and
biopsies were placed into RNALater (Ambion, Austin, TX)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and saved at –80uC
until used.
DNA extraction
Isolation of genomic DNA from tissue (QIAamp DNA Mini Kit;
Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or blood (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit,
Qiagen) was done according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. EDTA-anticoagulated blood was spun for 10 min at
2000 rpm at 4uC; the buffy coat was collected and stored at –
80uC until used for DNA isolation.
Genotyping assay
All donors and recipient were genotyped for three common
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOD2/CARD15
gene: (1) a missense mutation 2104CRT (SNP 8; R702W, NCBI
reference SNP ID: rs2066844); (2) a missense mutation 2722
GRC (SNP 12; G908R, NCBI reference SNP ID: rs2066845); and
(3) a frameshift C-mutation, 3020insC (SNP 13; 1007fs, NCBI
reference SNP ID: rs2066847). For R702W and G908R mutation,
two pre-made (Assay-on-Demand) assays were provided by
Applied Biosystems (Assay ID: c_ _ 11717468_20 and c_ _
11717466_20). For the 1007fs mutation, the assay was customdeveloped by Applied Biosystems with the following primers
and fluorophor-labelled probes: (forward primer, GTCCAA
TAACTGCATCACCTACCT; reverse primer, CAGACTT
CCAGGATGGTGTCATTC; VIC-labelled probe, CAGGCC
CCTTGAAAG; FAM-labelled probe, CAGGCCCTTGAAAG).
Reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions in a 96-well plate. Briefly, 10 ng of genomic DNA
was mixed with 12.5 ml of 26 TaqMan Universal PCR Master
Mix No AmpErase UNG and 1.25 ml of 206 SNP Genotyping
Assay, and PCR was carried out on a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR
instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Thermal
cycling conditions were: 95uC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles
of 92uC for 15 s (melting step) and 60uC for 60 s (anneal/extend
step). Detection of fluorescent signal was performed according
to the recommended protocols for the 7500 Fast Real Time PCR
machine, and the results were analysed by the associated
Sequence Detection System (SDS) Software V. 1.3.0. (Applied
Biosystems).

Determination of mRNA abundance by TaqMan quantitative
reverse transcriptase-PCR (TaqMan qRT-PCR)
The gene products analysed included antimicrobial peptides/
proteins expressed by Paneth cells (HD5, HD6 and lysozyme)
and enterocytes (HBD1, HBD2, HBD3 and LL37). All donor
organs examined were from individuals with normal NOD2
alleles.
Isolation of total RNA was performed by RNeasy Mini RNA
isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, from tissues that had been previously stored in
RNALater (see above). RNA was quantified with a Biorad
spectrophotometer; A260/280 readings between 1.8 and 2.0 were
used to confirm purity. Additionally, formaldehyde gel electrophoresis was performed to verify the presence of intact 18S and
28S rRNA. The expression of human AMP mRNA in small
bowel was determined by TaqMan qRT-PCR. To measure
cDNA levels, the threshold cycle at which fluorescence is first
detected above baseline is used, and a standard curve is drawn
between starting nucleic acid concentrations and the threshold
cycle.
We measured the concentration of the following AMP
mRNAs: human b defensin 1 (hBD1, NCBI RefSeq:
NM_005218.3), human b defensin 2 (hBD2, NCBI RefSeq:
NM_004942.2), human b defensin 3 (hBD3; NCBI RefSeq:
NM_018661.2), human defensin 5 (HD5, NCBI RefSeq:
NM_021010.1), human defensin 6 (HD6, NCBI RefSeq:
NM_001926.2), lysozyme (Lsz, NCBI RefSeq: NM_021797.2)
and cathelicidin-derived peptide LL37 (LL37, NCBI RefSeq:
NM_004345.3). Pre-made TaqMan probes and primers (assay
ID: Hs00608345_m1, Hs00175474_m1, Hs00218678_m1,
Hs00360716_m1, Hs00427001_m1, Hs00253976_m1,
Hs00189038_m1, respectively) were purchased from Applied
Biosystems. Target mRNA levels are expressed relative to an
internal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
control (assay ID: Hs99999905_m1, Applied Biosystems).
Isolated total RNA (1 mg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA
in a 20 ml reaction mix using Superscript III reverse transcriptase
and random hexamers, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For cDNA amplification, a 10 min incubation at 95uC was carried out to activate
AmpliTaqGold DNA polymerase; this was followed by 40 cycles
with 15 s at 95uC and 1 min at 60uC for each cycle.
The relative expression was defined as a relative value in
comparison with the arbitrary expression value 1 obtained from
patients without any polymorphism in NOD2/CARD15 or as
qualified in fig 3. qRT-PCR was performed with the 7500 Fast
Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). More information

Western blot analysis
Ileal tissue (5–8 mg) was analysed by acid urea–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (AU–PAGE), followed by western blotting as
described.26 The tissue was homogenised in ice-cold acetic acid
(1:10 w/v), containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride,
1 mg/ml leupeptin and 1 mg/ml aprotinin. Samples (25 mg/line)
were subjected to 12.5% AU–PAGE, transferred onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, fixed with 0.1%
glutaraldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and blocked for 1 h
in 5% non-fat powdered milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20
(TTBS). The membranes were then incubated overnight with
the primary antibodies against hBD1, hBD2, HD5 and HD6 at a
final dilution of 1:1000. Blots were washed several times in
TTBS, and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were
added for 2 h. All antibodies were purchased from Alpha
Diagnostic International Inc. (San Antonio, TX). Finally,
membranes were washed several times in TTBS, and complexes
were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection
(ECL) method (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Protein
levels were measured by Bradford assay. Relative densitometry
of the bands was quantified using National Institute of Health
ImageJ software, version 1.36B. b-Actin was used to confirm the
load of protein in each lane.
Paneth cell histology
Tisssues were stained with phloxine–tartrazine as described13 At
least 10 crypts displaying Paneth cells were examined per
patient, from 2–3 biopsies taken from physically separate sites
on the distal ileum.
Statistical analysis
The major outcome variables (first episode of severe rejection,
graft loss and patient death) were analysed in relation to NOD2

mutant alleles. Time to the clinical event was examined by
means of Kaplan–Meier survival curves using log-rank analysis
in order to determine significance. Cox’s proportional hazards
model was fit to control the possible effects from other factors.
We compared the Kaplan–Meier curves of outcomes of NOD2
wild-type and NOD2 mutant recipients with a log rank test
(fig 2), and then, separately fitting a Cox proportional hazard
model to accommodate other potential influences on outcome
(table 2). For patient demographic characteristics, a two-tailed
unpaired t test was used for comparison of continuous variables,
while Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables or
discrete variables. p Values of ,0.05 were considered to indicate
statistical significance; all p values were two-sided.
RESULTS
Prevalence of NOD2 genotypes in recipients and donors
NOD2 genotypes were determined for all 34 donor–recipient
pairs. The median duration of follow-up for these patients was
1.3 years (range, 70 days to 4.5 years). Twelve of the 34
recipients (35%) had one or more of the three NOD2
polymorphisms associated with CD (R720W, G908R,
3020insC), while 22 had corresponding wild-type NOD2 loci
(table 1). In contrast, only 3/35 donors (8.6%) had CD NOD2
polymorphisms (p,0.008). Each of the three NOD2 polymorphisms was represented in the recipient population, with no
apparent bias towards a specific mutation. Several individuals
carried two polymorphisms within a single NOD2 gene, and six
individuals were homozygous for one of the CD NOD2
polymorphisms. A full description of the NOD2 hapolytypes
observed in the transplant recipient population will be
published elsewhere (Novitskiy et al, manuscript in preparation)
Three recipients (8.8%) had prior CD, two with NOD2 CDassociated polymorphisms and one without. To the best of our
knowledge, none of the other recipients were first-degree
relatives of individuals with CD. The frequency of NOD2
polymorphisms in the donor group was within the range
reported for the general population.4
Association of NOD2 genotype with outcome
Allograft recipients were divided into two groups according to
whether or not the recipient carried a NOD2 CD-associated
polymorphism (table 1).

The median follow-up time was similar for the recipients
with NOD2 polymorphisms and those with wild-type loci (1.4
and 1.2 years, respectively). Only three allografts were from
donors with NOD2 polymorphisms, thus, our assessment of
outcomes is essentially a reflection of the impact of the NOD2
genotype of the recipient on the transplant outcome. Two of
the three allografts that came from donors with NOD2 CDassociated polymorphisms had been implanted into recipients
who also had NOD2 CD alleles, including an individual with
underlying CD. Both experienced severe graft rejection, and the
recipient with CD died of sepsis following allograft failure. The
remaining NOD2 mutant donor graft was transplanted into a
recipient with a wild-type NOD2 genotype and they experienced an uneventful course.
From the Kaplan–Meier curves we see that the risks of
developing an initial severe episode of rejection (fig 2A) and of
graft failure (fig 2B) were significantly greater in the NOD2
mutant recipients compared with the NOD2 wild-type recipients (p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). No patient deaths
were observed in NOD2 wild-type recipients; each NOD2
mutant recipient who experienced graft rejection subsequently
died prior to re-transplantation.
We considered as potential covariates the age, gender, prior
viral status of the recipients and donors (CMV and EBV), and
whether or not other organs were being transplanted along with
the small intestine (table 2). The inclusion of the liver with the
small intestine has been proposed to worsen outcome.18
Recipients with a NOD2 polymorphism were at greater risk
of experiencing a first episode of severe, graft-threatening
rejection than NOD2 wild-type recipients, with a hazard ratio
of 4.449 (p,0.018); no significant effect was observed from
other covariates in a Cox regression model (not shown).
Similarly, the risk of graft loss was significantly greater for
recipients with mutant NOD2 alleles than those with wild-type
loci (hazard ratio 97.3, p,0.006). No deaths were found in the
recipients with NOD2 wild-type alleles (0/22), compared with
5/12 (42%) of the NOD2 mutant group, representing a highly
significant difference using Fisher’s exact test (p = 0.0024).
Association of recipient NOD2 genotype with graft AMP
expression
To assess whether the NOD2 genotype of the recipient
influences the innate defences of the allograft, we examined
the expression of epithelial AMPs in biopsy specimens obtained
at a common time point (3–4 weeks) postoperatively from all
recipients of wild-type allografts who had not yet experienced a
rejection episode and who were free of gastrointestinal or
systemic infections. Ten patients met these criteria, comprising
four individuals with NOD2 polymorphisms and six with wildtype loci. Small bowel allografts implanted into both groups of
recipients showed no significant difference in the overall
expression of the AMP genes, as anticipated (fig 3A).
Allografts introduced into wild-type recipients retained the
same pretransplant level in the expression of these AMP genes
3–4 weeks after transplantation (fig 3B), despite active immunosuppression and prior surgery. In contrast, allografts
implanted into the NOD2 mutant recipients exhibited significant depression of HD5 and HBD2 expression relative to
pretransplant levels, despite normal bowel function and
histology (fig 3C). The relative differences in mRNA content
obtained by qPCR were confirmed by quantitative measurement of absolute mRNA copy numbers (Novitskiy et al,
manuscript in preparation). Semi-quantitative analysis of
protein extracted from the biopsy tissues was consistent with
the relative differences in corresponding mRNA abundance
(fig 3D–G). A light microscopic examination of biopsies taken
from allografts at this time revealed no change in numbers of
crypts or the number of Paneth cells per crypt. However, we
observed a distinct decrease in size and number of phloxine–
tartrazine-stained secretory granules in recipients with NOD2
polymorphisms compared with wild-type recipients (fig 3H,I);
Three of four recipients with NOD2 mutations selected for this
analysis subsequently developed acute severe rejection between
2 and 6 months after transplantation, while none of the six
wild-type recipients has as yet experienced severe rejection
(between 1 and 2 years post-transplantation). Taken together,
these data suggest that the ‘‘normal’’ expression of certain
intestinal epithelial AMPs is not sustained when the intestine is
introduced into a recipient with a mutant NOD2 genotype.
DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates that small intestinal allograft recipients
with one or more NOD2 CD-associated polymorphisms were
more likely to suffer severe allograft rejection, allograft loss and
death than recipients with corresponding wild-type loci. We
suggest that NOD2 genotyping has important prognostic value
in small intestinal transplantation.
NOD2 is an intracellular microbial sensor expressed most
robustly in human macrophages, dendritic cells and Paneth
cells.1 3 The importance of the NOD2 gene in human innate
immunity was first appreciated by its identification as a locus
linked to CD,5–8 but precisely how the defective NOD2 locus
leads to CD, as well as its role in intestinal health, remains
controversial. Data from mouse and man support several
hypotheses. Defects in the NOD2 gene of the intestinal
macrophage have been shown to disturb the expression of the
suite of cytokines necessary to co-ordinate the balance between
immune suppression and activation required for healthy
functioning of the adaptive immune system in the intestine;
as a consequence, the presence of commensal microbes in
individuals with CD is hypothesised to provoke a dysfunctional
inflammatory reaction leading to epithelial injury.1 In addition,
the NOD2 gene plays a role in maintaining the functional
integrity of the healthy intestinal mucosal barrier; for example,
individuals with both SNPs R702W and 3020insC are more
likely to exhibit abnormal mucosal permeability than individuals with wild-type alleles.27 Other studies suggest that CDassociated defects in the NOD2 gene of the intestinal epithelial
cell result in impaired expression of certain AMPs, leading to
microbe-induced epithelial damage; a secondary inflammatory
response is provoked to ‘‘protect’’ the intestinal mucosa.11 13 28
Indeed, in a study performed with mice in which the NOD2 loci
were genetically deleted, the expression of specific Paneth cell
defensins (Defcr4, Defcr-rs10) was found to be significantly
depressed compared with wild-type animals; the homozygotic
knockout mice could not clear orally administered Listeria
monocytogenes from their gastrointestinal tracts as efficiently as
wild-type animals, although they handled a systemically
administered inoculum indistinguishably.12
We have observed that epithelial AMP expression in the
allograft is depressed in recipients with NOD2 CD loci prior to
the appearance of histopathology visible by light microscopy.
The AMPs involved, HD5 and HBD2, are both believed to
protect the epithelium from microbial damage and control the
growth and species diversity of commensals. These observations
are consistent with those reported by Wehkamp et al in studies

observed from biopsies taken both from areas of small intestine

that were inflamed and from those not pathologically diseased.13 29 In addition, as observed here, Wehkamp et al noted
that in ileal CD Paneth cell defensin expression was reduced
while the numbers of Paneth cells per crypt were not.13 29
It remains to be determined if this failure of AMP-based
antimicrobial defences is directly responsible for the subsequent
rejection process that more frequently occurs in recipients with
NOD2 CD-associated SNPs. Intestinal crypt apoptosis, followed
by extensive submucosal inflammation, might be provoked by
microbes unconstrained by epithelial AMPs. In the absence of
an antimicrobial shield, microbes could physically gain access to
the apical surface of the enterocytes, cause cellular damage and
provoke inflammation, as proposed to explain CD11 30 31 Recent
studies have demonstrated that changes in the level of
expression of Paneth cell defensins similar in magnitude to that
observed in our transplant recipients can profoundly alter the
numbers and species diversity of intestinal commensal bacteria.13 Alternatively, rejection might be a consequence of other
compromised NOD2-dependent functions required for normal
intestinal epithelial homeostasis. In either case, this process
appears to differ with respect to the mechanism for ‘‘classical’’
tissue rejection, which is an inflammatory state provoked by
antigens recognised as ‘‘non-self’’ by the recipient.
The allograft is depleted of donor lymphoid tissue prior to
implantation; lymphoid cells of the recipient repopulate the
allograft over the course of days.32 In contrast, the epithelial
tissue of the allograft retains the donor genotype, with recipient
epithelial cells comprising ,0.5%, when examined between
about 6 months and .2 years after the procedure.33 Hence, the
NOD2-bearing cells of the recipient most probably contributing
to allograft rejection and depressed AMP expression are the
macrophages and/or dendritic cells that repopulate the allograft.
We can only speculate at this time on the mechanisms by
which the macrophage and/or dendritic cell could influence the
intestinal epithelium to modulate AMP expression. Recently
published studies suggest that intestinal epithelial growth
factors, such as Wnt, play a role in man in intestinal stem cell
proliferation, cell fate determination and the physiological
maintenance of mature Paneth cells.34–36 Indeed, in fully
differentiated Paneth cells, induction of certain antimicrobial
peptides and proteins, such as HD5 and HD6, appears to be
actively regulated by Wnt.34–36 Precisely how signals from Wnt
and other growth factors involved in the maintenance of a
‘‘healthy’’ intestinal epithelium are regulated to meet physiological needs is not known. Our study suggests that macrophages/dendritic cells, utilising NOD2-dependent circuits,
might be helping to influence the outcome.
Holler et al have recently reported that transplantation of
haematopoietic stem cells from donors with one or more CDassociated NOD2 polymorphisms increases the risk of severe
intestinal graft versus host disease, a condition that resembles
allograft rejection with respect to microscopic pathology.37 We
conclude that the risk of severe intestinal epithelial injury is
increased when we repopulate the bowel with haematopoietic
tissue bearing these NOD2 polymorphisms, regardless of
whether we transplant the haematopoietic system or the
intestine.
The high frequency of NOD2 polymorphisms discovered in
our allograft recipient population is notable. Whereas the
frequency of NOD2 CD-associated SNPs among our donors
(previously healthy individuals with no gastrointestinal disease)
was similar to that of the general population, the frequency of
these polymorphisms among the recipients was similar to that
reported for CD in various populations.4 The recipients are
individuals who previously suffered one of several extreme
intestinal insults requiring extensive surgical resection of the
small intestine, or who suffered a disabling functional intestinal
disorder. The high frequency of CD-associated NOD2 polyFigure 2 Kaplan–Meier curves of rejection and graft loss after

Figure 3 Expression of intestinal antimicrobial polypeptide (AMP) genes in tissue specimens from allografts in recipients with or without NOD2
Crohn’s disease (CD)-associated polymorphisms. Recipients represent those in the transplant population that had not as yet experienced a rejection
episode and had normal intestinal histology. All donor organs were from NOD2 wild-type donors (see text). Total RNA was isolated and analysed as
described in the Methods section. The relative level (normalised to glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase) of target mRNA was determined by
quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Data are expressed as relative levels of each mRNA, as described in the figure, with the comparator assigned a
value of 1.0. (A) Organs sampled prior to transplantation; tissue levels of specific AMPs from allografts implanted into recipients with a NOD2 wild-type
genotype (W, white bars) (N = 6) are compared with those implanted into recipients with NOD2 mutant genotypes (M, grey bars) (N = 4); (B) AMP
mRNA recovered from allografts, 3–4 weeks after transplantation into recipients with wild-type NOD2 loci; white bars, tissue samples taken from the
donor bowel prior to transplantation; grey bars, biopsies taken from the same bowel 3–4 weeks after implantation. (C) as B, but allografts were
transplanted into recipients with NOD2 CD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. (D–G) Western blot analyses of AMPs extracted from allograft
biopsies taken at the same time points as in B and C, and performed as described in the Methods section. Amounts of protein extract were normalised
based on b-actin (b-A) present. Quantitative densitometry of the photographic images for each peptide is presented, along with one representative blot
image (*p,0.05; **p,0.01). (H, I) Representative light microscopic images of Paneth cells taken from biopsy specimens corresponding to samples
studied in B and C, respectively (phloxine–tartrazine).

morphisms observed in the recipient population might reflect a
previously unappreciated genetic linkage with the specific
intestinal disorders that ultimately required extensive surgical
resection (eg, gastroschisis, malrotation, intestinal atresia, etc.).
Alternatively, the presence of dysfunctional NOD2 alleles might
impair the ability of the small intestine to accommodate the
injurious ‘‘stresses’’ imposed by the primary intestinal disorder
eventually leading to intestinal failure. Our study suggests that
mutations in the NOD2 gene may be more widely associated
with human gastrointestinal diseases than is currently appreciated.
In summary, NOD2 CD-associated polymorphisms in an
intestinal allograft recipient appear to represent significant risk
factors for rejection and death. An early event in the rejection
process appears to involve impaired expression of epithelialderived AMPs, including those of the Paneth cell. Failure to
protect the epithelium appears to be followed by visible damage
to the epithelial barrier, and a subsequent inflammatory cell
infiltration into the bowel wall. The association of this process
with the NOD2 status of the recipient implicates a heretofore
unrecognised role played by NOD2-expressing cells of bone
marrow in the maintenance of normal intestinal epithelial
immune health. Hopefully the information presented in this
study will help guide our attempts to improve the outcome of
small intestinal transplantation and other serious intestinal
diseases in man.
