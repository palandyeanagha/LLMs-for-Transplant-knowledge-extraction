Background: Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are relatively rare malignant tumours with poor prognosis. It is known from other solid
neoplasms that antitumour inflammatory response has an impact on tumour behaviour and patient outcome. The aim of this study
was to provide a comprehensive characterisation of antitumour inflammatory response in human BTC.
Methods: Tumour-infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD4 þ , CD8 þ , and Foxp3 þ ), natural killer cells (perforin þ ), B lymphocytes
(CD20 þ ), macrophages (CD68 þ ) as well as mast cells (CD117 þ ) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 375 BTC including
extrahepatic (ECC; n ¼ 157), intrahepatic (ICC; n ¼ 149), and gallbladder (GBAC; n ¼ 69) adenocarcinomas. Overall and
intraepithelial quantity of tumour-infiltrating immune cells was analysed. Data were correlated with clinicopathological variables
and patient survival.
Results: The most prevalent inflammatory cell type in BTC was the T lymphocyte. Components of the adaptive immune response
decreased, whereas innate immune response components increased significantly in the biliary intraepithelial neoplasia – primary
carcinoma – metastasis sequence. BTC patients with intraepithelial tumour-infiltrating CD4 þ , CD8 þ , and Foxp3 þ
T lymphocytes showed a significantly longer overall survival. Number of total intraepithelial tumour-infiltrating Foxp3 þ regulatory
T lymphocytes (HR: 0.492, P ¼ 0.002) and CD4 þ T lymphocytes (HR: 0.595, P ¼ 0.008) were tumour grade- and UICC-stageindependent prognosticators. The subtype-specific evaluation revealed that the tumour-infiltrating lymphocytic infiltrate is a
positive outcome predictor in ECC and GBAC but not in ICC.
Conclusion: Our findings characterise the immune response in cholangiocarcinogenesis and identify inflammatory cell types that
influence the outcome of BTC patients. Further, we show that BTC subtypes show relevant differences with respect to density,
quality of inflammation, and impact on patient survival.
Biliary tract cancers (BTC) are a diverse group of tumours that
arise from the biliary tract epithelium. Biliary tract cancers can be
divided into three major clinical phenotypes: cholangiocarcinomas
(CC) of intrahepatic (ICC) and extrahepatic (ECC) origin and
adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder (GBAC). In the United States
and Europe, risk factors for BTC include chronic biliary tract
diseases, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatolithiasis,
choledochal cysts, and other anatomical malformations of the bile
ducts (Blechacz et al, 2011). Non-biliary diseases such as heavy
alcohol abuse, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic
hepatitis C, and cirrhosis are also more prevalent in BTC patients
compared with the general population. For BTC patients with
locally advanced or metastatic disease, the prognosis is poor with
median survival less than 1 year (Hezel et al, 2010). Common
therapeutic options include surgery and chemotherapy but as BTC
patients often present in an unresectable state, there is an urgent

need of novel chemotherapeutic options (Patel, 2011). As some
BTC patients are in a general condition insufficient to undergo
aggressive systemic treatment, finding better and reliable prognostic markers for BTC is of importance for further stratification of
patients for therapeutic trials.
Tumour cells are often surrounded by infiltrating inflammatory
cells, particularly lymphocytes and macrophages (Smyth et al,
2006). Tumour antigens drive the development of tumour-specific
adaptive immune responses (Boon et al, 1994). CD4 þ and CD8 þ
T lymphocytes are crucial components of tumour-specific cellular
adaptive immunity. CD8 þ T lymphocytes attack tumour cells
presenting tumour-associated antigen peptide with major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) on their surface by
producing interferon-g. Interferon-g-dependent mechanisms of
tumour cell cytostasis and killing comprise cell cycle inhibition,
apoptosis, angiostasis, and induction of antitumourigenic activity
of macrophages (Dunn et al, 2004). Immunohistochemical studies
have found that tumour-infiltrating CD8 þ T lymphocytes have a
favourable effect on patient survival in several malignant tumours
including colorectal (Galon et al, 2006), ovarian (Zhang et al,
2003), breast (Mahmoud et al, 2011), and pancreatic (Fukunaga
et al, 2004) cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), density and
location of CD8 þ T lymphocytes have a prognostic value superior
to and independent of the International Union Against Cancer
(UICC) – TNM classification (Mlecnik et al, 2011). Further,
density of immune cells at the invasive margin of metastatic CRC is
predictive for response to chemotherapy (Halama et al, 2011).
In BTC, sub-populations of immune cells have so far only been
studied in parts, using comparably small patient cohorts and
without specifying anatomical/histological subtypes (Oshikiri et al,
2003; Takagi et al, 2004). Therefore, our aim was to analyse the
influence of density and distribution of tumour-infiltrating
immune cells on patient prognosis in a large, well-characterized
series of BTC patients with long-time follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinicopathological characteristics of BTC patients. Tissue
samples from 375 patients (median 64.1 years) who underwent
bile duct and/or liver surgery at the University Hospital Heidelberg
between 1995 and 2010 were included in this study. Only patients
with primary adenocarcinomas of the biliary tract and without
other known malignancies at the time of diagnosis were included.
Biliary tract cancers consisted of 149 ECC (106 perihilar and 43
distal), 157 ICC, and 69 GBAC. Patients who received radiochemotherapy before surgery were excluded. Survival data were
available for 335 patients (Table 1). Tumours were restaged
according to the seventh TNM classification of malignant tumours
and classified after the World Health Organization (WHO) tumour
classification system (Bosman et al, 2010). Clinicopathological data
of the complete study cohort is given in Supplementary Table 1.
The use of the tissues for this study was approved by the
institutional ethics committee (206/05).
TMA construction and immunohistochemistry. From all 375
BTC, 3 mm sections were cut and stained with H&E. Representative
areas from the tumour centre and invasive margins were
marked by pathologists with special expertise in BTC pathology
(BG and WW). For each case, tumour tissue cores (1.5 mm
diameter) from the selected representative tumour areas were
punched out of the sample tissue blocks and embedded into a new
paraffin array block using a tissue microarrayer (Beecher
Instruments, Woodland, CA, USA). For 92 cases, in addition,
high-grade dysplastic lesions (BilIN III) were sampled. In addition,
we included 30 metastatic lesions of BTC. For the characterisation
of the inflammatory components, vessel density, and proliferative

(1:100, clone 236A/E7, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and a monoclonal
mouse IgG antibody directed against Ki-67 (1: 200, clone Mib 1,
DAKO, Glostrup, DK) were used. Staining was performed on two
automated systems (Foxp3: Bond, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany; all
others were obtained from Discovery Ultra, Ventana, Tuscon, AZ,
USA) following the manufacturers’ instructions.
Evaluation of TMAs. Immune cell density was assessed quantitatively on tissue microarray (TMA) slides. Immune cells were
identified as either T-helper cells (CD4 þ ), regulatory
T lymphocytes (Foxp3 þ , a subset of CD4 þ T lymphocytes),
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 þ ), natural killer (NK) cells
(perforin þ ), B lymphocytes (CD20 þ ), macrophages (CD68 þ ),
and mast cells (CD117 þ ). The immunostaining was in all
instances evaluated in conjunction with morphology to avoid
misclassification of immunohistochemically positive cells without
matching morphology as immune cells. For CD4, CD8, CD20,
CD68, Foxp3, CD31, and Ki-67 the whole set of cases could be
evaluated, whereas for perforin and CD117 only a part of the
cohort was available. Infiltrating immune cells were numerically
evaluated in the category ‘total’ by counting the total number of
positive immune cells per TMA dot, regardless of whether these
cells were found in the epithelial or in the stromal compartment of
the adenocarcinoma (for example, ‘CD4 total’). For statistical
analyses, the cases were grouped by using the median as a cutoff.
We defined those cases with an inflammatory infiltrate above the
median as positive and those cases with an inflammatory infiltrate
below the median as negative for the respective infiltrating immune
cell type. Overall, NK cell count numbers were very low; therefore,
we grouped cases as having none or any number of infiltrating NK
cells. In solid tumours, the localisation of inflammatory cells
(stroma vs epithelium) has been shown to be of some importance
(Galon et al, 2006). Therefore, the number of infiltrating immune
cells within a representative area containing 100 carcinoma cells
(epithelial compartment of the carcinoma) was evaluated separately (for example, ‘CD4 intraepithelial’). Immune cells observed
in lymphoid follicles (aggregates) were excluded from counting; the
presence of lymph follicles was evaluated separately. For technical
reasons, single TMA dots could not be evaluated with the necessary
precision. Therefore, the number of cases included varies between
the statistical analyses of the different immune cell types. The
number of Ki-67-stained tumour cells out of 100 tumour cells were
counted and expressed in percent. The number of CD31 þ vessels
was counted per TMA dot (1.5 mm diameter).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with the
statistical computing environment R version 2.15.1 and IBM SPSS
STATISTICS version 19 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Spearman’s
rank order correlation was used to determine whether there was a
positive or negative correlation between the degrees of tumourinfiltrating immune cells, vessel density, and proliferative activity.
The significance of differences in the density of immune cells for
differing tumour stages and other clinicopathological variables was
assessed with Mann–Whitney-U-tests, Kruskal–Wallis tests, and
w2
-tests, as indicated. Statistically significant trends associated with
increasing UICC stages, tumour grades, or T-stages were identified
by Jonkheere–Terpstra and Cochran–Armitage trend tests.
Univariate survival analysis was performed for overall survival by
generation of Kaplan–Meier curves. Significance of differences
between the groups was assessed using the log-rank test. For
multivariate analysis, concordance regression (Dunkler et al, 2010)

RESULTS
Characteristic distribution of inflammatory infiltrate in BTC.
In BTC, T lymphocytes were the most prevalent inflammatory cell
type (for exemplary photomicrographs, see Supplementary Figure 1).
The majority of T lymphocytes were CD8 þ T lymphocytes
(64 cells per TMA spot) but CD4 þ T lymphocytes were also
frequently found (40 cells per spot; Supplementary Table 1).
Correspondingly, CD8 þ T lymphocytes showed a higher
propensity towards infiltration of tumour epithelium (48.4%
of cases), whereas only 36.3% of cases had intraepithelial
CD4 þ T lymphocyte infiltrates (Supplementary Table 2).
Of the CD4 þ T lymphocytes, only a subset was of the Foxp3 þ
regulatory T-cell-type (in median 5 out of 40, 12.5%,
Supplementary Table 1). B lymphocytes were only infrequently
observed. More than half of the tumours did not show any B
lymphocyte infiltrate and only 1.4% of BTC showed B lymphocytes
within the tumour epithelium (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Macrophages were quite frequently encountered per total TMA
dot (median of 72 cells) as well as in the tumour epithelium (77.6%
of cases). Mast cells were infrequently seen with more than half of
the tumours being completely negative. Within the tumour
epithelium, mast cells were infrequent as well (4.3% of cases;
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Total NK cell count was very low,
with only 19.1% of tumours showing any infiltration of this cell
type at all (Supplementary Table 2).
The total count of CD4 þ T lymphocytes, CD8 þ
T lymphocytes, regulatory T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and
mast cells was high in BilIN III, and showed a stepwise decrease in
invasive tumours and their metastases (Figure 1). Similarly, NK cell
content also decreased from BilIN III to the primary tumour
(Supplementary Figure 2). On the contrary, the number of
macrophages was increased in invasive tumours and metastases
when compared with BilIN III (Figure 1).
The densities of specific immune cell types are correlated with
each other and are partly associated with vessel density and
proliferative activity. As expected, the total density of specific
immune cell types was significantly correlated with the corresponding number of intraepithelial immune cells for all cell types
evaluated (Figure 2). However, the statistical strength of correlations varied. Although for CD4 þ T lymphocytes, CD8 þ
T lymphocytes, and macrophages strong correlations showing
r-values well above 0.5 were observed, total and intraepithelial
Foxp3 þ regulatory T lymphocyte counts showed only a moderate
association (r ¼ 0.41). This association was even weaker for
B lymphocytes and mast cells (r ¼ 0.20 and r ¼ 0.24, respectively).
The densities of CD4 þ T lymphocytes, CD8 þ T lymphocytes,
and macrophages was quite strong, positively linked to each other,
whereas the density of B lymphocytes, NK cells, and mast cells
seemed to be independent. The total density of cytotoxic T cell,
regulatory T lymphocytes, and macrophages was positively

associated with proliferative capacity. This was also observed for
intraepithelial infiltrates of regulatory T lymphocytes. All other
inflammatory components did not correlate with the proliferation
status. In general, the density of inflammatory cells was higher in
tumours with a high microvessel count, but the respective
associations of inflammatory cell numbers with vessel density
were only weak (Figure 2).
Differences in the density of inflammatory infiltrate with
respect to clinicopathological parameters and BTC subtypes.
Apart from the total infiltration of regulatory and cytotoxic
T lymphocytes, which was higher in older patients, age and sex
were not associated with significant differences in the density of
inflammatory cells (Supplementary Table 1). Higher UICC stages
(specifically stage III) were associated with a modest increase in
mast cell infiltrates (Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, NK cell
counts decreased by trend in locally more advanced tumours
(Supplementary Table 2). Regarding the intraepithelial density
of inflammatory cells, a decrease of intraepithelial CD4 þ
T lymphocyte density with increasing UICC and pT stages
(Supplementary Table 2) was observed. Total densities of CD4 þ
T lymphocytes, CD8 þ T lymphocytes as well as B lymphocytes
(single cells as well as aggregates) were significantly higher in lowgrade than in high-grade tumours (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2;
Supplementary Figure 3). Striking differences in the composition of
inflammatory cells were noted for BTC subtypes. Although ECC
and GBAC showed equal amounts of total CD8 þ T lymphocytes
(median 88 per TMA dot; Supplementary Table 1), numbers in
ICC were significantly reduced (median 40 per TMA dot,
Po0.001). Regulatory T lymphocytes were most frequent in
GBAC (median 24 per TMA dot), followed by ECC (median 8 per
TMA dot), and most infrequent in ICC (median 2 per TMA dot,
Po0.001; Supplementary Table 1, Figure 3). In addition, mast cell
counts were higher in ECC when compared with GBAC and ICC
(median 20 vs 0, and 0 per TMA dot, Po0.001). However, these
differences in total density did not translate into differences in the
intraepithelial component for all cell types (Supplementary
Table 2).
The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes is an independent
predictor of patient survival in BTC. Classical survival prognosticators such as UICC stage and others proved to have high
prognostic impact on our BTC cohort (Table 1). The presence of
intraepithelial tumour-infiltrating CD4 þ T lymphocytes as well as
CD8 þ T lymphocytes correlated significantly with a longer overall
survival in BTC patients (P ¼ 0.002 and 0.015, respectively).
Patients who had higher total regulatory T lymphocyte counts had
a significantly better prognosis when compared with those patients
whose tumour tissues showed lower regulatory T-lymphocyte
counts (Figure 4F, P ¼ 0.018). Intraepithelial B lymphocytes were
rarely observed and the few cases with intraepithelial cells did not
differ with respect to prognosis. However, presence of total B
lymphocytes had a positive prognostic impact (Figure 4H,
P¼ 0.032). The presence of B-lymphocyte aggregates, macrophages,

or mast cells either total or within the tumour epithelium was not
associated with significant differences in overall survival (Figure 4).
Multivariate analysis under inclusion of UICC stage and tumour
grade revealed a significant independent prognostic impact of the
presence of either intraepithelial Foxp3þ regulatory T lymphocytes
(HR: 0.492, P¼ 0.002; Supplementary Table 3) or intraepithelial
CD4 þ T lymphocytes (HR: 0.595, P ¼ 0.008; Supplementary
Table 4) but not of intraepithelial CD8 þ T lymphocytes
(HR: 0.840, P ¼ 0.363; data not shown) or total B lymphocytes
(HR: 0.758, P ¼ 0.151; data not shown).
The role of CD4 þ and CD8 þ T lymphocytes as a predictor of
patient survival is subtype dependent in BTC. We analysed the
impact of immune cells on survival regarding the major subtypes
of BTC and found that the prognostic significance of the presence
of intraepithelial T and B lymphocytes is dependent on the BTC
subtype. Our data showed that in ECC and GBAC, the respective
associations of lymphocyte infiltration and prognosis were
retained for CD4 þ T lymphocytes (Supplementary Figure 4),
CD8 þ T lymphocytes (Supplementary Figure 5), regulatory T
lymphocytes (Supplementary Figure 6), and B lymphocytes
(Supplementary Figure 7). In contrast to ECC and GBAC, all of
these prognostic parameters lost their power in the subgroup of
ICC (Supplementary Figures 4–7).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the
inflammatory infiltrate in BTC by evaluating total and intraepithelial tumour-infiltrating CD4 þ , CD8 þ , Foxp3 þ , CD20 þ
lymphocytes, perforin þ NK cells, CD68 þ macrophages, and
CD117 þ mast cells in a large and well-characterized BTC cohort.
We decided not to include granulocytes in the analysis, as tumour
infiltration by this cell type is heavily influenced by the presence of
tumour cell necrosis and therefore difficult to analyse with respect
to its biological relevance in a study design like ours.
We observed that general components of the adaptive immune
response (T/B lymphocytes) decreased via the dysplasia – primary
carcinoma – metastasis sequence, whereas components of the
innate immune response (such as macrophages) increased. This
observation is in line with a variety of functional data showing
that in the course of carcinogenesis, neoplasms are able to learn
how to evade an activation of the adaptive immune response
(Dunn et al, 2004; Rabinovich et al, 2007).
In general, we observed that the adaptive immune response is
beneficial for BTC patients and its activation is associated with
longer overall survival times. In line with these results, some of the
inflammatory cell types involved in this type of immune response
have previously been linked to a more favourable outcome in other
malignancies (Cho et al, 2003; Fukunaga et al, 2004; Galon et al,
2006; Mahmoud et al, 2011; Mlecnik et al, 2011). An explanation
for this association is that these inflammatory cells represent a cellmediated immune response against the tumour. However, the
particular tumour-infiltrating immune cell type relevant for patient
outcome may vary between different malignancies.
The role of CD8 þ T lymphocytes in tumour progression has
been examined in a variety of human malignancies (Oshikiri et al,
2003; Fukunaga et al, 2004; Galon et al, 2006; Mahmoud et al,
2011; Mlecnik et al, 2011). Most of these studies reported a
beneficial prognostic effect of high intratumoural/intraepithelial
CD8 þ T lymphocyte counts – a finding, which we were able to Number of CD117–positive cells (total)

T lymphocytes in immunologic anticancer response is more
controversial. It is generally accepted that CD4 þ T lymphocytes
may suppress tumour growth indirectly through cytokine
production (Waldner et al, 2006). However, a low CD4/CD8 ratio
has also been reported to be associated with better prognosis of
patients in colorectal carcinoma (Diederichsen et al, 2003),

ability of CD8 þ T lymphocytes to attack tumours in certain
conditions. On the other hand, cooperation between CD4 þ and
CD8 þ T lymphocytes has been described to improve patient
outcome (Cho et al, 2003). We found a favourable prognostic
impact of both intraepithelial tumour-infiltrating CD4 þ and
CD8 þ T lymphocytes indicating a cooperative antitumour effect
of these two T lymphocyte types in BTC.
Tumour cells can suppress immunity either by producing
immunosuppressive molecules or by attracting other immune cell
types, which in turn are able to suppress the immune reaction
against the tumour. The latter mode of action has been suggested
to be mediated at least in part by regulatory T lymphocytes
(Zou, 2006; Liu et al, 2007). However, infiltration of regulatory
T lymphocytes in vivo has been observed to be associated with
inconsistent survival probabilities (Siddiqui et al, 2007; Sinicrope
et al, 2009; Mathai et al, 2012; Yoon et al, 2012). In this
BTC cohort, total tumour-infiltrating regulatory T lymphocytes
were associated with a longer patient survival. Therefore, a
prognostically relevant immunosuppressive effect of regulatory
T lymphocytes is unlikely in BTC.
The functional contribution of B lymphocytes to the inflammatory response of solid tumours is not well understood. Here we
present data that showed that the total tumour-infiltrating
B lymphocyte count is correlated with a longer overall survival
probability in BTC. Whether this observation just reflects an
epiphenomenon in the context of immune response activation, or
whether it is indicative of a true contribution of B lymphocytes to
tumour control by the immune system should be determined in
future studies.
Our data revealed that ECC, GBAC, and ICC are different
regarding the prognostic importance of the inflammatory infiltrate.
Although all three BTC subtypes are traditionally merged in the
clinical context and are treated similarly with respect to
chemotherapeutic approaches, there is evidence that this viewpoint
might be oversimplified concerning the molecular basis of the BTC
subtypes (Guedj et al, 2009; Cardinale et al, 2010; Komuta et al,
2012). The here-observed subtype-specific immune responses and
their differing associations with patient survival suggest profound
differences in the immune system – tumour interaction for the
respective BTC subtypes. In this regard, one potentially important
mechanism might be tumour immune escape. Immune escape
mechanisms of tumour cells have been studied extensively in a
variety of human cancers, including breast, prostate, pancreatic,
oesophagus, and CRC (Du and Wang, 2011; Scott et al, 2012).
However, concerning biliary malignancies and immune escape
mechanisms, the number of available studies is limited. One major
mechanism of immune escape is the downregulation of MHC I
antigen on cancer cells by a number of different molecular
alterations (Seliger, 2008; Seliger, 2012). Down-regulation of MHC
I expression on cancer cells has been shown in a variety of human
malignancies and mostly, but not exclusively, had a negative
impact on patient survival (Natali et al, 1989; Facoetti et al, 2005;
Meissner et al, 2005; Ogino et al, 2006; Han et al, 2008; Kasajima
et al, 2010; Du and Wang, 2011). Further, the correct function of
MHC I antigen is dependent on a network of intracellular proteins
called the antigen-processing machinery (APM). We could recently
demonstrate that besides down-regulation of MHC I, downregulation of other components of the APM is also linked to the
density of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and also correlates with
poor patient survival in CRC (Kasajima et al, 2010). Such
mechanisms might be underlying the failure of antitumour
inflammation to improve prognosis in ICC observed in our study.
This theory is strengthened by proposed differences for the cell of
origin of ICC and ECC/GBAC. Although recently developed
concepts of a stem cell phenotype in hepatocellular carcinoma/
combined hepatocellular CC show stem cell features that are also
encountered in classical ICC, the hilar/distal ECC and GBAC show
a different stem cell phenotype originating from biliary tree stem
cells (Bosman et al, 2010; Roskams et al, 2010; Komuta et al, 2012).
It is known that several normal and cancer stem cells express
minimal or no class I and II MHC (Kubota and Reid, 2000; Du and
Wang, 2011). This knowledge has specifically been confirmed in
human hepatic stem cells (Kubota and Reid, 2000; Rao et al, 2008).
This might explain why ICC are able to evade damage induced by
tumour immune response, which in turn would explain the
missing association of inflammation and ameliorated patient
outcome in this tumour subtype. However, further studies are
necessary to prove that alterations in MHC-associated mechanisms
are actually of importance in BTC. Another potential mechanism
of tumour immune escape is Fas-mediated apoptosis of immune
cells. Fas ligand (FasL) binding to death receptor Fas triggers
apoptosis of Fas-expressing cells including tumour-infiltrating
immune cells. Upregulation of FasL has been demonstrated in a
variety of human neoplasms and was linked to survival (Du and
Wang, 2011). In ICC, one study showed upregulation of FasL at
early stages and downregulation of FasL at progressed stages,
thereby indicating a potential role of this immune escape
mechanism in cholangiocarcinogenesis (Shimonishi et al, 2000).
Interestingly, in vitro experiments showed that primary and
malignant cholangiocytes undergo CD40-mediated Fas-dependent
apoptosis, but are insensitive to direct activation with exogenous
FasL (Humphreys et al, 2010).
Recently, immune response modulating targeted drugs have
been successfully tested as anticancer agents in a variety of human
tumours (Weber et al, 2008; Brahmer et al, 2012; Kirkwood et al,
2012). As the clinical effect of these drugs is now explored in other
neoplasias, our data may serve as a rationale to launch future
clinical trials in BTC patients.
In conclusion, we report that the presence of both intratumoural
T and B lymphocytes is correlated with a longer survival in BTC
patients. In addition, we found that BTC subtypes show important
differences in the composition and the prognostic relevance of
immune cell infiltrate, that is, in ECC and GBAC, prognosis was
inflammation linked, whereas in ICC no such association was
observed. These data provide a solid basis for a better understanding of the biological role of inflammatory infiltrate in BTC
and might therefore encourage future functional and clinical
studies exploring the modulation of the inflammatory response for
the benefit of BTC patients.
