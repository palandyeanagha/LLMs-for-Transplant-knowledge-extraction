Abstract. HCC may recur following surgery or radiofrequency 
ablation. Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a type of radiotherapy 
that achieves excellent local control of HCC without severe 
toxicity. The present study reported the long-term outcome of 
3 HCC patients who each received 4 repeat courses of PBT. All 
patients had a hepatitis BorC viral infection. A total of 14 lesions 
were treated using a curative PBT protocol and irradiated liver 
volumes in each treatment were 7-50% of the total liver volume. 
Liver function in all cases was considerably preserved until the 
last follow-up and patient survival was 51-107 months from the 
first PBT with no local recurrence observed in the 14 lesions. 
The presented cases indicated that repeated PBT is an effective 
treatment option for recurrent HCC due to reduced liver damage 
and superior local treatment compared with other treatment 
options such as transarterial chemoembolization.
Introduction
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most 
frequent cancer among men and the seventh among women. 
It frequently occurs in East Asia and Africa because of the 
high incidence of hepatitis infection in these regions (1). To 
address this disease, various treatment methods, curative and 
non-curative, have been developed based on factors such as liver 
function, tumor burden, and tumor size. For patients with single 
or up to three nodules of HCC, local treatment such as surgery 
or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the standard choice.
HCC is frequently comorbid in the cirrhotic liver with 
chronic hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV) infections that 
cause HCC recurrence even after curative local treatment 
has been performed and local control have been achieved. A 
2011 report indicated that the risk of HCC recurrence in the 
liver within five years after liver resection or RFA amounts to 
70% (1). This recurrence pattern has two types, multicentric 
and intrahepatic (2), which force HCC patients to receive 
repeated treatments every few months or years.
Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a radiotherapy characterized 
by ultra-precise delivery of high dose radiation that limits 
off-target energy. HCC is one of the diseases to which PBT 
is often applied for treatment (3-5). PBT was started in our 
facility in 1983 and the current facility has been dedicated to 
clinical research and practice since 2002. We have since treated 
approximately 1400 HCC patients using proton beams and have 
demonstrated that PBT has the ability to achieve excellent local 
control of HCC without severe toxicity in several scientific 
reports (6-8). Among those patients, a total of 160 patients 
have subsequently received repeated PBT as of 2017 and the 
maximum number of treatment courses delivered has been 
4 times in 3 of those patients. Although local treatment effect 
has been demonstrated in many reports, intrahepatic recurrence 
is as important an issue for PBT as other local treatments. 
In cases of single or few recurrent tumors, PBT is one of the 
local treatment options. However, as the number of treatments 
increase, cumulative dosages elevate and overlap of dose 
distribution in many organs would cause various clinical issues 
such as liver dysfunction, digestive tract/skin ulcers, and bile 
duct stenosis. However, in spite of the importance of this issue, 
it is poorly understood how repeated PBT affects the prognosis 
and treatment-derived side effects to the various organs from 
past studies of PBT. For this reason, we here describe the 
long-term treatment outcomes in patients who each received the 
maximum number of 4 courses of repeated PBT. The present 
study was approved by Institutional Research Committee of the 
University of Tsukuba (approval no. H28-101).
Case 1
A 60-year-old man with HCV infection had HCC with a 
maximum diameter of 1.2 cm in S4. PBT was performed 
using the respiratory-gating technique with an irradiation 
dose of 66 gray relative biological effectiveness [Gy (RBE)] in

32 MURAKAMI et al: FOUR ROUNDS OF PBT FOR HCC
10 fractions over 22 days. A second PBT round for a new 2.2 cm 
diameter tumor in S7 was performed 12 months later [66 Gy 
(RBE)] in 10 fractions over 14 days). The third PBT course for 
a new 1.5 cm diameter tumor in S3 was performed 10 months 
after the second PBT round [72.6 Gy (RBE)] in 22 fractions over 
31 days). A fourth and final PBT course for a new 1.6 cm diameter 
tumor in S5 was performed 21 months after the third PBT round 
[66 Gy (RBE)] in 10 fractions over 14 days) (Fig. 1A). Note that 
we took great care to minimize irradiation field overlap during 
all courses in all patients. The total liver volume was 1286 cm3
at the first PBT while the irradiated liver volumes {an absolute 
volume of >1.0 Gy (RBE) delivery [V1.0 Gy (RBE)]} over the four 
treatments were 90, 176, 115 and 442 cm3, respectively (Fig. 1B). 
Serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (Alb) and total 
bilirubin (T. Bil) showed no significant changes during follow 
up (Fig. 1C). The Child‑Pugh classification remained class A 
and no acute or late treatment-related toxicity events of grade 2 
or more (according to the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.03) were observed until the last 
follow-up 16 months after the fourth PBT (60 months from 
the first PBT). A multiple intrahepatic recurrence developed 
22 months after the fourth PBT (66 months from the first PBT). 
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and Des-gamma carboxyprothrombin 
(DCP) remained mainly below 100 mg/ml and 100 mAU/ml, 
respectively, during follow up (Fig. 1D). This patient died a total 
of 96 months after the first PBT.
Case 2
A 69-year-old man with HBV infection had an HCC of 3 cm in 
diameter in S8 and 4.5 cm in S6 and had already received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) 5 times before consulting 
our hospital. PBT was performed simultaneously for the tumors 
in S8 [66 Gy (RBE) in 10 fractions over 15 days] and S6 [77 Gy 
(RBE) in 35 fractions over 57 days] and we confirmed that the 
two irradiation fields did not overlap. A second PBT course for 
a new 2.7 cm diameter tumor in S8 was performed 25 months 
later [77 Gy (RBE) in 35 fractions over 57 days]. A third PBT 
round for a new 1.8 cm diameter tumor in S8 was performed 
14 months after the second PBT [72.6 Gy (RBE) in 22 fractions over 34 days]. In this treatment, beams were delivered 
from the back to avoid overlapping the first irradiation field, 
although a right lateral beam could have greatly reduced the 
irradiation dose of the right lung field. The fourth and final PBT 
for a recurrent tumor of 7 cm in diameter in S7/8 with inferior 
vena cava tumor thrombosis was performed 8 months after the 
third PBT course [66 Gy (RBE) in 10 fractions over 56 days] 
(Fig. 2A). The total liver volume was 1073 cm3 at the first PBT 
while the irradiated liver volumes over the four treatments were 
260, 221, 114 and 330 cm3, respectively (Fig. 2B). Unirradiated 
volume in the liver throughout all treatment was 320 cm3. 
Serum concentrations of ALT showed no significant changes 
but AST and T. Bil increased and Alb showed a reduced, 
albeit mild trend which was noticeable after the fourth treatment (Fig. 2C). The Child‑Pugh classification remained class A 
and no acute or late treatment-related toxicity events of grade 2 
or more were observed. A multiple intrahepatic recurrence 
appeared at 4 months after the fourth PBT (50 months from 
the first PBT). AFP was largely decreased after first PBT and 
rapidly increased after the second PBT. AFP once decreased 
from 2005 to 999 mg/ml during the fourth PBT but rebounded 
after that then reached 1789 mg/ml 5 months after the fourth 
PBT. DCP showed a similar pattern (Fig. 2D). This patient died 
51 total months after the first PBT.
Case 3
A 51-year-old man with HCV infection had multiple HCC (1 cm 
in diameter in S5 and 1 cm in diameter in S6). PBT for both 
tumors were performed simultaneously [66 Gy (RBE) in 10 
fractions over 15 days] and we confirmed that the two irradiation 
fields did not overlap. A second PBT round was then performed 
for a new 2 cm diameter tumor in S8 10 months later [66 Gy 
(RBE) in 10 fractions over 16 days]. In this treatment, beams 
were delivered from the front and right back to avoid overlapping the first irradiation field, although a right lateral beam could 
have greatly reduced the irradiation dose of the liver. A third 
PBT course for a new 3 cm diameter tumor in S4 was performed 
4 months after the second PBT [66 Gy (RBE) in 10 fractions 
over 16 days]. The fourth and final PBT course for a new 4 cm 
diameter tumor in S8 was performed 27 months after the third 
PBT [72.6 Gy (RBE) in 22 fractions over 36 days] (Fig. 3A). The 
total liver volume was 1624 cm3 at the first PBT while the irradiated liver volumes over the four treatments [V1.0 Gy (RBE)]were 225, 
388, 177 and 295 cm3, respectively (Fig. 3B). Total liver volume 
was dramatically altered by the repeated atrophy of the irradiation site and compensatory hypertrophy of the normal liver. AST 
and ALT showed a downward trend while Alb and T. Bil showed 
no significant changes (Fig. 3C). The Child‑Pugh classification 
remained class A and no acute or late treatment-related toxicity 
events of grade 2 or more were observed until the last follow-up 
60 months after the fourth PBT (101 months from the first 
PBT). A multiple intrahepatic recurrence appeared at 61 months 
after the fourth PBT (102 months from the first PBT). AFP and 
DCP showed no relatively big changes mainly at levels below 
100 mg/ml and 100 mAU/ml, respectively, until the fourth PBT, 
but there was a rapid and large increase after that (Fig. 3D). This 
patient died 107 months after the first PBT.
Discussion
There are some reports which refer to outcomes multiple treatment courses for HCC patients. Nishikawa et al (9) reported 
that overall survival rates of 130 relapsed patients treated with 
repeated‑RFA were not significantly different to those of 150 
non-relapsed patients after RFA. Joliat et al (10) analyzed 
67 patients with recurrent HCC after hepatectomy and found that 
the median survival time for patients receiving surgery, RFA or 
TACE was 77 months but it was 20 months for patients receiving 
chemotherapy or palliative care. Additionally, the survival 
period of those patients who received surgery/RFA/TACE was 
not significantly different from non‑relapsed patients(10). These 
reports demonstrate that long-term survival can be obtained if 
sufficient local control is achieved in spite of HCC recurrence. 
However, patients were treated no more than twice in most of the 
published reports and there are very few reports on the survival 
period after multiple treatment courses for HCC.
While our facility commonly encounters HCC patients with 
multiple treatment histories, a lack of literature on this topic 

MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY 12: 31-35, 2020 33
adds to the difficulty of accurately predicting patient outcomes. 
Although (to the best of our knowledge) there are no reports 
of repeated conventional photon radiotherapy treatments in 
HCC patients, Lo et al (11) reported the outcome of repeated 
stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in 14 HCC patients. The 
median first treatment dose was 41 Gy and second treatment 
dose was 40 Gy, leading to 1 and 2-year progression free survival 
rates of 68.6 and 42.9%, respectively, and 1 and 2-year overall

survival rates of 76 and 59.1%, respectively. As for treatment 
effect, in‑field recurrence happened in only 1 of the 18 tumors 
(5.6%) but one patient developed radiation-induced liver disease 
and three showed progression in Child‑Pugh classification after 
their second treatment. Sanuki et al (12) reported that 4% of 
patients who received SBRT suffered from fatal hepatic failure 
within 12 months after SBRT and liver function and platelet 
count can predict liver failure. Data such as these therefore 
indicate that, although local control may be established, preservation of liver function is not always guaranteed (12).
The criteria of repeated PBT in our facility is exactly the 
same as the first PBT, namely that PS is 0‑2, Child‑Pugh classification is A‑B and tumor number must be single or a few with 
an upper size limit of 15 cm. However, tumor location and vessel 
invasion only have a small influence on treatment adaptation. 
The existence of ascites requires more careful treatment planning, especially if the ascites amount is unstable. Maintenance 
of liver function is clinically very important for repeated PBT 
but all three patients in our study were positive for HBV or 
HCV, potentially impacting liver dysfunction. The irradiated 
volume for the 12 total irradiation events was 7-50% of the total 
liver volume, the summation of which corresponded to 51-91% 
of the total liver volume at the first treatment. Most published 
liver dosage tolerances are based on whole liver irradiation 
data (13,14) and available data relating liver tolerance to PBT 
are scarce. It is thought that liver function or irradiation volume 
affects radiation-induced liver dysfunction (15,16); however, no 
definite consensus has been reached because of sparse data and 
reports. We therefore defined our own dose constraint as an 
unirradiated liver volume of > 500 cm3 based on our previous 
studies and clinical experience (15). However, the unirradiated volume is occasionally forced to be <500 cm3
 by repeat 
irradiation. In such cases, liver dosage and treatment protocol 
are determined by multiple considerations, including age, PS, 
liver function, treatment strategy, patient wishes, etc. (example: 
Case 2). It is fortunate that no severe side effects occurred in 
these 3 cases. Clarification of the ability of these 3 patients 
to tolerate PBT for 4 courses is important. Our precise dose 
calculation for each organ and careful treatment strategy may 
be responsible. Alternately, these patients might have had some 
pathological condition or constitution conducive to enduring 
repeated treatment. One possible common point was the maintenance of liver function over several years after the first PBT 
in spite of the repetitive treatment. Next, as far as observing the 
transition of the biomarkers in these 3 cases, viral hepatitis and 
cumulative dosage to the liver did little to affect the prognosis. 
In summation, although we cannot conclude how liver dysfunction was avoided from such a small cohort, further studies with 
higher patient numbers could shed light upon this issue.
We have previously reported the results of repetitive PBT for 
HCC at our facility. At the initial treatment center (1989-2000), 
we analyzed 27 cases and revealed that re-irradiation is safe if 
liver function is Child-Pugh class A and the target is located 
in a peripheral tumor (17). At the current center (2002-2010), 
83 cases were analyzed and it was revealed that liver function 
tended to gradually decline as the number of irradiation events 
increased (18). As the number of treatment courses piles on 
top of cumulative dose elevation, the treatment effect becomes 
difficult to be predicted and risk to normal organs becomes 
higher. In general, this analysis features long-term follow-ups 
and descriptions of side effects for selected HCC patients 
receiving many repetitions of PBT, which differs from past 
studies of PBT for HCC. Moreover, this data lends credence to 
our recommendation that repeated PBT can be safely selected 
for the curative treatment of HCC.
There are some limitations in the current study. Various 
reports for liver dose tolerance exist but they are mostly based 
on the outdated concept of total liver irradiation, which may

not always apply to modern, locally high dose treatment. 
Another subject is deformation of the liver, which dramatically and non-uniformly deforms after PBT in patients with 
chronic liver disease (18,19). This means that our method of 
summing irradiated volumes by simply adding them together 
may be overly simplistic. However, it is technically diffi cult to 
correctly calculate cumulative dose distribution in deformed 
livers, highlighting the necessity to improve dose distribution 
calculation techniques which can overcome this limitation and 
establish the safety of repeated PBT.
Here, we reported on three HCC patients who each received 
4 courses of PBT. Liver function was considerably preserved 
until fi nal follow‑up and long‑term survival (>48 months) was 
achieved. We consider that PBT has the potential to be applied 
to recurrent HCC due to less liver damage and a superior local 
treatment effect. Repeated PBT can therefore be an effective 
treatment option for persistently recurring HCC.
