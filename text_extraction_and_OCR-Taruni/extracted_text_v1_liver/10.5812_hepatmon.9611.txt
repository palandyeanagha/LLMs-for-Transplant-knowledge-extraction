ABSTRACT
Background: There are surprisingly a few studies that evaluate the impact of chronic viral hepatitis, which is common in HD (hemodialysis) 
patients, on HRQOL (health related quality of life).
Objectives: We conducted a study to evaluate the impact of chronic viral hepatitis on HRQOL and to compare their HRQOL with non-infected 
HD patients via a HRQOL questionnaire.
Patients and Methods: The Iranian adapted version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SF) version 1.3 questionnaires 
were filled out by the HD patients. In all HD patients, serum HBsAg, HBS Abs, and HCV Abs [enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)] were 
routinely checked every six months. Patients were considered to have chronic HBV infection if HBsAg was positive for more than six months. 
In all HD patients, third generation assay was used to detect HCV infection. Furthermore, serum HCV-RNA (PCR) was examined in anti-HCVpositive patients for confirmation of HCV infection.
Results: in this cross sectional study 4101 patients from 103 dialysis units in Iran between October 2010 and August 2011 were included. 
Prevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection was 2.1% and 1.3% respectively. Almost all KDQOL items for viral hepatitis patients had 
equivalent or better scores than those without viral hepatitis. In the logistic regression after adjustment for age, sex, educational level, marital 
status, dialysis vintage, HBs Ag positivity and HCV Ab positivity, only age (P < 0.001) and educational level (P = 0.015) had negative impact on 
quality of life.
Conclusions: Our data show that not only general health and physical activity were preserved but also health perception may be better 
among HD patients with viral hepatitis.

HRQoL is a multidimensional concept that reflects patient’s well-being in both the physical and mental aspects of health. Moreover, 
several factors such as disease related manifestations, the side effects of treatments, and patient’s quality of interaction with family

1. Background
Viral hepatitis in hemodialysis (HD) patients is more 
prevalent than the general population (1, 2). In addition, 
recent evidence has emphasized the adverse effects of 
HBV and/or HCV infection on survival and certainly on 
health related quality of life (HRQOL) in this population 
(3). Several reports have revealed that both end stage renal disease (ESRD) and viral hepatitis have negative impact on HRQOL, mortality and morbidity (1, 3). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying impairment in HRQOL 
have not been fully elicited (1, 4, 5). Although HRQOL in 
asymptomatic HBV carriers with normal renal function 
is as good as those with HBsAg negative; progression of 
disease worsens the general health and consequently the 
mental health. Finally, when it progresses to ESRD all dimensions of HRQOL are influenced (6). Moreover, HRQOL 
in HCV-infected HD patients is correlated with anemia, 
malnutrition, and depression, and is not associated with 
severity of the liver disease (5). The natural history of HBV 
and HCV infections in patients with ESRD are not entirely 
implicated (3) and the prevalence of HCV and HBV infection in HD patients differs noticeably country-by-country, 
ranging from negligible for HBV infection in developed 
countries to a very high prevalence of HCV infection in 
some developing countries (7, 8). As prevalence of hepatitis virus infections is higher in developing countries 
than in developed countries (9), due to accessibility of 
healthcare facilities, the factors that influence HRQOL in 
patients with ESRD especially in association with other 
comorbid diseases would undoubtedly be variable. Although, the trend of the interaction between multiple 
diseases and HRQOL has steadily increased, previous researches have focused on the effects of erythropoietin 
and exercise, and other factors on HRQOL among dialysis 
patients (10-12). Despite increasing interest in assessing 
HRQL in different types of chronic disease, there are surprisingly a few studies that evaluate the impact of chronic viral hepatitis, which is common in HD patients (13), on 
HRQOL (14).
2. Objectives
We conducted a study to evaluate the impact of chronic 
viral hepatitis on HRQOL and to compare their HRQOL 
with non-infected HD patients via a HRQOL questionnaire.
3. Patients and Methods
3.1. Patients
In a prospective cross-sectional study, the quality of life 
was evaluated among 4101 adult HD patients who were 
checked for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 
hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) from 103 dialysis units in 
Iran between October 2010 and August 2011. The Iranian 
adapted version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life 
Short Form (KDQOL-SF) version 1.3 questionnaires (15) 
was filled out by these HD patients. We enrolled patients 
aged more than 14 years that were clinically in a stable 
condition, who remained on HD for at least 3 months and 
received HD 3 times per week with each session lasting 3 
to 4 hours. We excluded the patients hospitalized for an 
acute illness, those with vascular access failure, including 
dialysis via a temporary vascular access and those who refused to participate in the study. All patients were divided 
into three groups; group I, patients who were serologically negative for HBsAg and HCV Ab (n = 3961); group II, patients with HBsAg positive (n = 87); and group III, patients 
with HCV Ab positive (n = 53).
3.2. Instruments
The evaluation of HRQOL was perform by the KDQOL-SF 
questionnaire version 1.3 ( 16 ), which includes generic 
and disease specific cores. Mental and Physical Component Summary, (MCS and PCS) was obtained from the generic core scores, that encompass eight scales of the SF-36 
physical functionality , role-physical, bodily pain, general 
health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social function, mental 
health (emotional well-being), and role-emotion. Disease 
specific items were condensed in to eleven scales targeted for kidney disease and including symptoms/problems, effects of kidney disease on daily life, burden of 
kidney disease, work status, cognitive function, quality of 
social interaction, sexual function, sleep, social support, 
dialysis staff encouragement and patient satisfaction. 
These 11 kidney disease specific scales of the KDQOL-SF 
questionnaire were validated for Iranian patients ( 15 ) 
and were condensed as the Kidney Disease Component 
Summary (KDCS). Each scale score varied from 0 to 100 
points; hence, higher scores indicated a better quality of 
life. Details on translation and validation of SF-36 Health 
Survey have been described elsewhere ( 17 ); however, 
KDQOL-SF version 1.3 underwent a translation and validation process to Farsi in another study ( 15 ). In our study, 
all scales had internal consistency and reliability as measured according to Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.41 to 
0.91 (Table 1). The questionnaire was generally self-administered, where the respondent completed it on his/her 
own; therefore, the patients mostly filled out their questionnaire at home or in the dialysis department. The last 
laboratory data was obtained from the patients’ data file. 
Dialysis staff rechecked the written information by the 
patients to assure correct understanding and to make 
sure that they completed the questionnaire.
3.3. Definition
In all HD patients, serum HBsAg, HBS Abs, and HCV Abs 
[enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)] were routinely checked every 6 months. Patients were considered 
for chronic HBV infection if HBsAg was positive for more 
than six months (7).

 In all HD patients, third generation assay was used to detect HCV infection. Furthermore, serum HCV-RNA (PCR) 
was examined for anti-HCV-positive patients for confirmation of HCV infection.
3.4. Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 18.0 for 
Windows. Clinical, demographic, and HRQOL variables 
were expressed as means and standard deviations. Categorical variables were measured as frequencies and percentages. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskall-Wallis tests for skewed data were used to compare 
continuous variables between more than two groups; 
the Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney test for skewed 
data was applied for comparisons between two groups. 
The Chi square test was used to compare categorical variables. Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship between quality of life and continuous variables 
(e.g. age, dialysis vintage, Kt/V, and Hb). Following the 
univariate analysis, all demographic and clinical variables with P ≤ 0.2 were entered as predictor variables in 
multiple regression models. A P-value of 0.05 or less was 
considered to indicate statistical significance.
4. Results
From a total of 4101 dialysis patients aged between 14 
and 91, 2.1% and 1.3% had hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection, respectively. In more than half of all patients (57.4%) 
and in all 3 groups, male gender was predominant (Table 
2). The mean age was 55 ± 16 years with a mean dialysis 
vintage of 39±40 months. The most common primary 
known disease was hypertension (30.7%). More than half 
of the participants were educated (54%) and near 60% 
were aged less than 60 years old. Mean age for non-HBs 
non-HCV, HBs Ag positive and HCV Ab positive patients 
were 55.22 ± 16.29, 49.85 ± 16.62 and 47.82 ± 13.51, respectively, P = 0.001.

4.1. Viral Hepatitis
Patients with HCV infection were younger than those 
who had no hepatitis B and C (48 ± 13 vs 55 ± 16 years, P = 
0.001) and individuals with HBV infection (48 ± 13 vs 50 
± 17 years, P = 0.5). Half of patients in group II were uneducated (52.5%), while majority of patients with HCV 
Ab positive were educated (72.3%). The prevalence of HBV 
and HCV infections was significantly higher in Afghani 
refugee HD patients compared to the Iranian population 
(7.2% vs 1.9% P = 0.001 and 4.8% vs 1.2%, P = 0.004 respectively). Male gender was predominant for HBV and HCV 
infections (male to female ratio=2.1:1 and 1.8:1, respectively). It is important to note that almost all KDQOL items 
for viral hepatitis patients had equivalent or better scores 
than those without viral hepatitis (Table 3). Although burden of kidney disease had a lower score in HBsAg positive 
patients when compared to HCV Ab positive patients and 
negative HBV and HCV patients, this was not statistically 
significant (20.1 ± 18.5 vs 25.58 ± 22.2 and 22.59 ± 18.7, P = 
0.3). The other demographic data and KDQOL results for 
HBS positive, HCV positive and non-infected viral hepatitis patients are summarized in Table 2.

In HBsAg positive patients, duration of dialysis had no 
significant correlation with any of the KDQOL items. But 
increasing age had a negative significant effect on symptoms (P = 0.01), cognitive function (P = 0.007), quality 
of social interaction (P = 0.001), patient satisfaction (P 
= 0.01), pain (P = 0.02) and social function (P = 0.02). In 
HCV Ab positive patients, we found a positive correlation 
between duration of dialysis, work status (P = 0.02) and 
pain (P = 0.03), however, age had a negative correlation 
with role physical function (P = 0.004), role physical (P = 
0.006), pain (P < 0.001), general health (P = 0.02), PCS (P < 
0.001), emotional wellbeing (P = 0.04), energy fatigue (P 
= 0.03), role emotion (P = 0.04), social function (P = 0.02) 
and MCS (P = 0.007). In logistic regression after adjustment for age, sex, educational level, marital state, dialysis 
vintage, HBs Ag positivity and HCV Ab positivity; only age 
(P < 0.001) and educational level (P = 0.015) had a negative impact on quality of life (total SF- 36 and KDCS).
5. Discussion
In the current study, we observed that the prevalence 
of HBS antigenemia and HCV Ab positivity among HD patients decreased from 2.6% and 4.5% in 2006 (7) to 2.1% and 
1.3% in 2011, respectively. In this survey, we demonstrated 
that most of the KDQOL scores were higher in HD patients with viral hepatitis; especially PCS had significantly better scores for the 3 major components of the KDQOL 
questionnaire KDCS.
5.1. Incidence
There is a wide variation in the prevalence of HBV and 
HCV infections among different HD units and countries 
as shown by previous studies (7, 9, 18). The mean prevalence of HCV infection in different dialysis centers is approximately 13.5% and varies among different countries 
from 2.6% to 22.9% (9), while the prevalence of HBV infection within dialysis units in developing countries is 2% – 
20% (9). Although in a previous study (9) HBV infection 
was less prevalent than HCV infection in HD units, we 
showed that HCV infection had a lower prevalence than 
HBS Ag enemia in most of the Iranian dialysis centers. Despite the fact that we did not isolate HCV positive patients 
in dialysis units, lower rate of HCV infection may be due 
to a successful strategy for viral hepatitis prevention in 
HD units such as screening of all HD patients to detect 
HCV Ab using third generation. There is a limited data 
about occult HCV infection in HD patients (19-22). Barril 
and colleagues detected genomic HCV RNA in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells from 45% of long-standing HD 
individuals who had an unexplained high aminotransferases and had repeated anti-HCV antibody and serum 
HCV RNA negative. In addition, HCV-related liver disease 
in ESRD patients is characterized by spuriously low levels 
of liver enzyme, even in the presence of active infection. 
Moreover, some researchers have shown that occult HCV 
infection can be found following spontaneous or treatment-induced clearance of serum HCV-RNA (19). Thus, using only third generation assay could not exactly detect 
HCV infection and we used only HCV-RNA detection in 
anti HCV Ab positive; hence, our reported prevalence of 
HCV infection may be underestimated.
5.2. HRQOL
Chronic infections such as chronic viral hepatitis can 
impair HRQOL by affecting memory, neurocognitive 
function, concentration, attention and sexual function 
(5, 23). Conversely in this study, symptom scores were significantly better in HD patients with viral hepatitis. Ac-

6 Hepat Mon. 2013;13(6):e9611
cording to some studies, most patients infected with HCV 
and HBV infections are asymptomatic (1, 3) because the 
natural histories of these infections extend over decades 
rather than years and adverse consequences of chronic 
HBV or HCV infections may not be obvious in patients 
followed for a short period of time (3). Thus it is possible 
that the symptoms in our HD patients were not severe 
enough to have a significant effect on their quality of life. 
The total scores for KDCS and PCS were also significantly 
better in these groups of patients. Some explanations are 
as follows:
1) As we know HRQOL is a multidimensional concept 
that includes physical, mental, pysico-social, and spiritual aspects of health. In addition, many biological and 
non-biological factors such as hemoglobin levels, mineral and inflammatory biomarkers, Kt/V, patient’s culture, 
religious behaviors, and ethics, may play an important 
role in HRQOL because they can affect patients’ perceptions and expectations regarding quality of life (24). 
Therefore, the KDQOL questionnaire has defects in some 
human aspects of life (25) and cannot assess all aspects of 
life. Thus the instrument used in the present study was 
not sensitive enough to identify mild cognitive impairments. Moreover, we also have limitations in this survey, 
because we didn’t consider any of the biological factors, 
which seriously contribute to HRQOL and as a result unexpectedly many contributing factors were ignored.
2) On the other hand, distribution of viral hepatitis varies in different providence of Iran. Thus we may have a 
selection bias in this study, but a large number of HD patients were included; therefore, the results may be representative for all Iranian HD patients.
3) It seems that chronic hepatitis in patients, especially 
HCV infection, has small but significant effects on higher 
neurological functioning, however the impact of these 
changes on physical and mental well being is poorly 
understood and presumably links to both the degree of 
the change and the personal adaptation that, in some patients, may lessen the effects of infection on HRQOL (23).
4) The HRQOL was considerably diminished in HD patients, but less so in the group that was educated about 
their nutrition (8). Also, according to previous studies, 
male and employed patients have better HRQOL (15, 26, 
27). Interestingly, our patients with viral hepatitis were 
significantly younger, of the male gender, more employed and had higher education. Subsequently they 
were more likely to have better HRQOL scores.
5) Although there are some reports about quality of life 
in ESRD patients and chronic HCV infected patients, there 
is little reported data about HRQOL in treated and untreated HD patients with chronic HCV infection (28). Foster and colleagues in 2009 showed that sustained viral response can improve HRQOL. For the majority of patients, 
viral clearance produces improvements in both HRQOL 
and long-term prognosis (23). We also had another limitation that is we did not exclude treated patients or HBV 
carriers who have better HRQOL than patients with active 
hepatitis (6).
5.3. Limitations
Additionally, it was not possible to accurately measure 
all the variables that might have an impact on HRQOL. 
Finally, since our study had a cross-sectional design, our 
results may not prove a cause and effect relationship. Interestingly, our data showed that not only general health 
and physical activity were preserved but also health 
perception may be better among HD patients with viral 
hepatitis.
