Background. To evaluate the usefulness of the routine sonographic evaluation of the pattern of fluctuate portal 
velocity tracings and the hepatic veins for the diagnosis of arterioportal fistula (APF) and cardiogenic trans-sinusoidal 
shunting (CTS). 
Materials and methods. Color Doppler flow imaging and pulsed-wave Doppler (PW) examinations of the portal 
vein were performed in 282 subjects. The waveforms of the velocity tracings in the portal main trunk and its branches 
were determined to infer APF or CTS. Suspected cases of APFs or CTSs were always confirmed by echocardiography, 
contrast-enhanced ultrasound, computed tomography, or digital subtraction angiography findings. The portal maximum velocity (Vmax), minimum velocity(Vmin), Vmax/Vmin, arterial peak systolic velocity and resistance index, and venous 
reverse and forward velocities were used to estimate their haemodynamics. 
Results. The waveform of the velocity tracing for the draining portal vein of APF was typically arterial-like or diphase, 
as indicated by a systolic hepatofugal dwarf peak and a diastolic hepatopetal low flat shape. The flow in the affected portal vein was always hepatofugal in an intrahepatic patient, whereas a hepatopetal flow was observed in 
an extrahepatic APF patient. The waveform of the velocity tracing for the portal vein of CTS patients, especially its intrahepatic branches, showed a typical hump-like shape with or without a transitory hepatofugal tracing. The PW results 
displayed an increase in the retrograde phase of the hepatic venous flow with increased velocities in the two phases. 
Conclusions. Portal velocity tracings should be evaluated during routine detecting for APF or CTS, especially in patients with gastrointestinal upsets.

Introduction
Arterioportal fistula (APF) and cardiogenic transsinusoidal shunting (CTS) may both lead to portal 
hypertension and subsequent esophageal varices 
with bleeding.1-6 A timely diagnosis is essential 
because most cases have curable causes of portal 
hypertension that require different therapeutic 
tools.7,8 However, APF and CTS are often ignored 
because some patients are asymptomatic or experience equivocal symptoms such as diarrhea, 
edema, ascites, abdominal pain, and distension. 
Some APFs exist in patients with liver cirrhosis, 
whose portal hypertension can be considered the 
common evolution of cirrhosis; and other patients 
have the normal internal diameters of portal vein, 
hepatic vein, and hepatic artery, with indiscoverable focus.9-12
APF and CTS can cause variations in hepatic 
haemodynamics, especially of the portal vein.13
Ultrasound (US) analysis, which is dynamic, noninvasive, economical, and convenient, can examine

blood vessels in every direction. Fluctuate portal velocity with rhythmicity 14 The haemodynamics determined from the velocity tracings detected via US can easily be analysed15, but a detecting diagnostic procedure that can be applied during 
routine examinations has yet to be properly defined. 
The present study was performed to determine the 
usefulness of the routine evaluation of portal velocity tracings, in combination with those of the hepatic 
artery and vein, for APF and CTS diagnosis.
Materials and methods
Patients and controls
Color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and pulsedwave Doppler (PW) studies of the portal vein were 
performed on 195 patients with APF or CTS. These 
195 patients were selected from a consecutive series of APF or CTS diagnoses between January 2002 
and December 2010. Among 195 patients, 103 were 
males and 92 were females. The age distribution 
ranged from 26 to 67 years, with a mean age of 53 
years. The clinical symptoms were the following: 
edema in 105 patients, abdominal pain and distension in 53 patients, ascites in 32 patients, diarrhea 
in 17 patients, and malignant hypertension in 3 patients ( diastolic pressure>140mmHg). 23 patients 
were asymptomatic. Among 87 control subjects, 41 
were males and 46 were females. The age distribution ranged from 24 to 72 years, with a mean age 
of 49 years. No significant difference in sex or age 
distribution between the 195 patients and 87 control subjects.
Standard pre-settings
Two-dimensional images with homogeneous gain 
could clearly display the vascular lumens. In the 
CDFI, the blood flow signals exactly suffused 
the vascular lumen with soft color. The sampling 
frame steer was consistent with the direction of 
blood stream, and the sampling gate located at the 
center of lumen, of which the width was 2 mm, and 
the correction line paralleled with the direction of 
bloodstream.
CDFI and PW 
All subjects were evaluated by a skilled technician 
in the morning following an overnight fasting. The 
patients and control subjects routinely underwent 
CDFI and PW. The portal maximum velocity (Vmax), 
minimum velocity (Vmin) and Vmax/Vmin, arterial peak 
systolic velocity (PSV) and resistance index (RI), 
[(Vmax-Vmin) / Vmax], venous reverse velocity (RV) and 
forward velocity (FV), and reverse time/forward 
time [(RT)/(FT)] were used to estimate their haemodynamics. Each result is the mean of three measurements. The waveforms of the velocity tracings in 
the main trunk and the branches of the portal vein 
were determined to infer APF or CTS. A detecting 
diagnostic procedure is shown in Figure 1. 
Other procedures for confirmed 
diagnosis
Suspected APF or CTS based on color Doppler US 
findings were always confirmed by echocardiography, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), or digital subtraction angiography 
(DSA) findings.
CEUS was performed using an Acuson Sequoia 
512 US scanner equipped with a 3–5 MHz convex 
transducer and CPS, a contrast-specific CEUS software (Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, 
CA, USA). Standard pre-settings were used, with 
adjustment options for individual patients. After 
the baseline evaluation, SonoVue (Bracco, Milan, 
Italy) was injected intravenously as a bolus of 2.4 
mL, followed by a flush of 5 mL of normal saline. 
The region of interest set in each JPEG file for the 
affected portal vein was observed in real-time 
for about 2 min after the intravenous injection of 
SonoVue. The entire process was recorded and 
saved on the hard disk attached to the scanner. 
CT scans were performed with a dual-sourceCT 
system (Somatom Definition, Siemens Healthcare). 
Contrast-enhanced triple-phase scans (arterial, 
portal venous, and equilibrium phases) were obtained after an intravenous bolus injection of 120–
150 mL of iopromide (Ultravist 300 mg I/mL, Bayer
Schering Pharma) at a rate of 4.0 mL/s using an 
18-gauge catheter.

200 Meng Q et al. / Fluctuating portal velocity tracing
DSA was performed with femoral catheterisation by the Seldinger technique using a biplane 
DSA unit with rotational capabilities (Axiom Artis 
dTA, Siemens Healthcare). Typically, 6–9 mL of nonionic contrast medium (iopromide, Ultravist 300 
mg I/mL) was used per acquisition. A baseline DSA 
of the coeliac trunk and the superior mesenteric 
artery was performed to visualize the liver vasculature and evaluate the portal vein patency. The 
common hepatic artery and the right and left hepatic arteries were cannulated, and more superselective cannulations of the feeders to the arteriovenous shunts were performed, if indicated, with or 
without the use of microcatheters. The arterial and 
early and late parenchymal phases were evaluated 
after the acquisition of digitally subtracted images 
at a rate of one per second. APF was considered in 
cases where an opacification of one or more portal 
branches before or during the early parenchymal 
phase was observed.
Statistical analysis
All values are reported as mean ± standard deviation. 
Mean comparisons were performed using the t-test 
for paired samples, as appropriate. Comparisons of 
coefficients of variation were performed by F-tests. 
A value of P < 0.05 was used as the threshold for 
the statistical significance. A statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS 16.0 software.
Results
US findings
An echo-free focal lesion in continuity with a markedly hypertrophied feeding artery and a dilated 
draining portal vein, which showed a fast and 
turbulent flow during the CDFI and PW examinations, (Figure 2) was considered a direct indication of APF. The affected portal vein occasionally 
showed no enlargement with indiscoverable focal 
lesions. The waveform of its velocity tracing was 
typically arterial-like or diphase, as indicated by 
a systolic hepatofugal dwarf peak and a diastolic 
hepatopetal low flat shape (Figure 3A).
The right or left branch of the portal vein draining blood from the intrahepatic APF always had a 
hepatofugal flow, whereas that in the other lobe 
had a hepatopetal flow. The flow in the main trunk 
of the portal vein was always hepatopetal with a 
markedly decreased velocity in an intrahepatic 
APF patient but with a markedly increased velocity in an extrahepatic APF patient, whose flow directions in the two main branches of the portal vein 
were hepatopetal (Figures 2, 3A, 4A).
Dynamic CEUS scans showed that microbubbles arrived at the affected portal vein and at its 
parallel running artery in the early arterial phase 
7–10 s after SonoVue injection: the affected portal 
vein was markedly enhanced by the microbubbles 
during the arterial phase and became more echogenic than its surrounding parenchyma until the 
hepatic veins were stained (Figure 3B).
Normal US scans and CDFI always showed normal conditions in the portal vein, hepatic veins, and 
artery. The hepatic veins were sometimes enlarged. 
The waveform of the velocity tracing in the portal 
vein, especially its intrahepatic branches, showed a 
typical hump-like shape with or without a transitory hepatofugal tracing. PW results displayed an 
increase in the retrograde phase of hepatic venous 
flow with increased velocities in the two phases. 
Echocardiography always exhibited an enlarged 
right atrium with severe tricuspid regurgitation 
(Figure 5).
CT findings
The contrast-enhanced CT findings are as follows: 
(a) earlier enhancement of the affected portal vein 
compared with the superior mesenteric or splenic 
vein during the arterial phase or stronger opacification of the affected portal vein compared with 
that of the superior mesenteric or splenic vein 
(Figure 3 C); (b) wedge- or irregularly shaped hoFIGURE 2. US findings for a typical intrahepatic APF. (A) The dilated draining left

early pacification of the portal vein and its parallel

on color Doppler US findings were confirmed by 
echocardiography, 15 APF by CEUS, 27 APF by CT 
and 51 APF by DSA. The haemodynamic parameters of Vmax, Vmin, Vmax/Vmin, PSV, RI, RV, FV,

Discussion
The normal liver receives a dual supply of blood 
from both the portal vein and the hepatic artery. 
The main portal vein carries venous blood from the 
intestines and the spleen, while arteries accompany 
veins and their terminal branches to join via a capillary network. The main portal vein divides into 
the right and left branches, and the hepatic artery 
accompanies the portal vein. The terminal branches of the portal vein and their hepatic arterioles are

known as the acinus. Blood perfuses the liver parenchyma through the sinusoids and then enters 
the terminal hepatic venules, which form sequentially larger veins and drain into the inferior vena 
cava. The portal and hepatic vein are both without 
valves, thus their haemodynamics, especially the 
direction of blood flow, are responsive to change 
when exposed to variations in vascular pressure. 
The intrahepatic and extrahepatic terminals of the 
portal vein are both capillary networks; the intrahepatic terminal branches of the portal vein, and 
the hepatic artery and vein join the sinusoid. The 
blood flow directions of the portal vein and the hepatic artery are hepatopetal, but that of the hepatic 
vein is hepatofugal.16
Blood, similar to water, follows the path of 
least resistance. The normal portal venous flow is 
typically continuously hepatopetal with minimal 
variations related to the cardiac or respiratory activity.17,18 If there is communications between an 
artery and the portal vein, the arterial blood results in an APF and preferentially flows into the 
adjacent portal venous system with low resistance 
rather than into the relatively highly resistant arterial lumen. Consequently, the portal drainage is 
arterialised, so it shows a hepatic artery-like velocity tracing.
APF can be congenital, post-traumatic, iatrogenic (trans-hepatic intervention or biopsy), neoplastic, or related to ruptured hepatic artery aneurysms.7,19-22 Trauma and neoplasm are the most 
common causes of APF.7 They may be either intra- or extra-hepatic. Intra-hepatic APF can cause 
the hepatofugal flow of portal drainage in the liver,

and extra-hepatic APF can induce the hepatopetal 
flow.23
The portal velocity tracing of CTS is, to a large 
degree, influenced by the mechanical events in the 
right atrium.24 The main factor is increased hepatic 
venous outflow resistance with subsequent periodic trans-sinusoidal shunting caused by the elevated 
right atrial pressure with periodic profuse retrograde venous drainage into the hepatic vein via the 
inferior vena cava.25 This condition is commonly 
attributed to tricuspid insufficiency, and rarely, 
constrictive pericarditis.26 The pattern is characterFIGURE 5. CTS with severe tricuspid regurgitation. (A) Normal US scans demonstrate normal internal diameters of the portal and hepatic veins (a: right

ized by a monophasic hepatopetal flow with peak 
velocity and gradual diminution of velocity with or 
without a transitory hepatofugal flow velocity during each cardiac cycle; it exhibits a periodic humplike velocity tracing. This pattern is associated with 
periodic portal hypertension and has been found 
to be predictive of congestive heart failure.
APF or CTS presentation depends particularly 
on the shunt flow and, thus, its haemodynamic 
consequences. A fistula blood flow is a direct function of both the size of the vessel supplying it and 
the diameter of the communication itself.13,27 Those 
with small shunts often present as incidental findings in asymptomatic patients with indiscoverable 
focuses and may close spontaneously. A large or 
diffuse fistula results in a decrease in the feeding 
arterial pressure and an increase in the draining 
portal vein pressure. A large fistula indicates a varicose or saccular vessel with turbulent blood flow 
adjacent to the portal drainage.
APF can lead to chronic arterial inflow from 
the portal vein and CTS can facilitate the hepatic 
venous reflux into the portal vein. The increased 
blood flow in the portal system is considered to be 
the cause of portal hypertension.7,9,28 The increased 
portal pressure also impairs blood efflux from the 
spleen and gastrointestinal tract by increasing vascular outflow resistance, which may lead to potential complications.3,4 Mild to moderate abdominal 
pain and diarrhea secondary to congestive vascular enteropathy may be some early findings. Signs 
of more advanced disease include gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding, splenomegaly, refractory 
ascites, or other signs of progressive liver failure 
caused by portal hypertension. APF is one of the 
main impediments and relative contra-indications 
to trans-arterial chemo-embolisation, which has 
been proven to be an effective means of managing 
unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).19
The rationale behind AFP treatment is either to 
overcome existing portal hypertension or to prevent its development. The angiographic embolisation is a simple and effective means of treatment 
provided that the fistula is not too large and is accessible; it can be performed either via the transarterial approach or transvenous approach. The 
transvenous approach can be considered and used 
when there are multiple arteriovenous fistulas, or 
when embolisation via the trans-arterial approach 
is technically unsuccessful. Closure by embolisation with Gelfoam, steel coils, detachable balloons, 
n-butyl cyanoacrylate, or bucrylate has proven 
to be feasible.2,7,19,22,29 The choice of embolic agent 
should be based on the underlying mechanism of 
the shunts and their angio-architecture. The hepatic resection of liver parenchyma containing the 
AFP and ligation of the feeding artery are reserved 
for those patients with fistulas that are too large for 
safe embolization or whose embolised arteries are 
recanalised.30
APF and CTS can be slight and asymptomatic, 
but they often cause symptoms because of their 
consequences.8,10 Both are reversible causes of portal hypertension but utilize different therapeutic 
procedures. Thus, a correct diagnosis is necessary 
because only then a definitive therapy can be proposed. The waveform of the velocity tracing of the 
right and left branches of the portal vein is a reliable indicator that can differentiate the presence of 
APF or CTS. Its direction can distinguish intrahepatic from extrahepatic APF, and the velocity tracings of the hepatic artery and vein could further 
support the diagnosis. Therefore, color Doppler US 
can be proposed for the detecting of APF and CTS. 
The fistulous mechanism and angio-architecture 
should be identified in future investigations.
Conclusions
A fluctuating portal velocity tracing with rhythmicity is a reliable indicator for diagnosing APF or 
CTS. The evaluation of the velocity tracing patterns 
of the portal and hepatic veins, especially the direction of portal blood flow, should be used for the 
routine detection for APF and CTS in patients with 
gastrointestinal symptoms. Timely diagnosis and 
application of proper measures can relieve portal 
hypertension caused by APF or CTS.
