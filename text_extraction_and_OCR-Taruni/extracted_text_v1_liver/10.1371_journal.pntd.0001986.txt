Abstract
Background: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by Echinococcus multilocularis infections is a dangerous old disease in the
Northern Hemisphere. The aim of the paper was to collect and analyze data on human AE in Poland in the last two decades.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The sources of data were both the cases officially registered and detected by an active
field and laboratory surveillance. The cases were verified by clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria. Altogether 121
human cases of AE were detected. Among these 83 (68,6%) cases were classified as confirmed, 16 as probable and 22 as
possible. During the two decades a continuous increase in detection rate was noticed. The cases were 6–82 years old at the
time of diagnosis (mean - 47.7 years). Sex ratio M/F was 0.86/1.0. The AE was fatal in 23 (19%) patients (mean age at death -
54.1 years). Family agglomeration of AE was found in 4 foci, involving 9 patients. Seventy six of the cases were diagnosed in
an advanced stage of disease. In all cases the liver was the primary location of AE. In 30 (24.8%) patients a spread to other
organs was observed. Ninety four of the patients were treated with albendazole. In 73 (60%) patients a surgical operation
was performed, including 15 liver transplantations.
Conclusions/Significance: The studies confirmed that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, which is the fourth country in
Europe with over 120 cases detected. The results also indicate the need of a wider national programme for implementation
of screening in the highest AE risk areas (north-eastern Poland) with an effort to increase the public awareness of the
possibility of contracting E. multilocularis, and above all, training of the primary care physicians in the recognition of the risk
of AE to allow for an early detection of this dangerous disease.

Introduction
During the last three decades there has been a continuous
increase in worldwide interest both in human and animal alveolar
echinococcosis (AE), mainly due to a substantial increase in the
number of recorded AE human cases.
Human alveolar echinococcosis is caused by the larval stage of
Echinococcus multilocularis, occurring in at least 42 countries of the
northern hemisphere. Recent studies in Europe and Asia have
shown that the endemic area of E. multilocularis is larger than
previously suspected and an invasion among foxes has regionally
expanded from rural to urban areas [1]. Alveolar echinococcosis is
old disease in Europe [2]. In the last half-century, the most
frequent cases of human AE in Europe were described in France,
Germany, Switzerland and Austria [1,3], and more recently, also
in Lithuania, the nearest neighbouring country, where 96 human
AE cases were recorded in the years 1997–2008 [4–5]. Recently
the most numerous casus of AE in humans have been reported
from China [6–8].
The clinical progress of human AE is very slow: the period
between exposure and the appearance of symptoms may be as
long as several to dozen or more years [9–10]. The increase in the

´

incidence rate of human AE in Poland [11] in the recent decade is
particularly worrying. Human AE is diagnosed mainly in areas
with a high prevalence of infected red foxes, a fact testifying to an
alleged link between the occurrence of E. multilocularis in animals
and human infections in the locally community [12–14].
In Poland the fox population increased from 67 000 in 1995 to
220 000 in 2006 [13]. The average E. multilocularis prevalence in
the red fox in Poland is 2.6%, the highest infection rate being in
the Varmia – Masuria Province (mean 39.6%, in some districts
varies from 50.0–62.9%), in the Sub – Carpathian Province
(36.8%) and in the Province of Pomerania (mean 7.9%) [13].
In Poland by 1980 human AE had been known from the two
individual case reports [15–16]; and two other cases in 1984 and
1988 were diagnosed retrospectively [17]. However in the years
1990–2011 a significant increase in morbidity including fatal cases
was observed [11]. Several cases were individually reported [17–
29]. The EurEchinoReg includes 14 cases notified [1], two out of
which were recognized in the eighties, 6 in the years 1990–1995
and another 6 in the years 1996–2000.
In the first half of the nineties the Poznan´ Clinical Centre in
cooperation with the WHO Informal Group on Research in
Echinococcosis made an attempt to coordinate scientific research
into AE in 4 clinical centers in Poland (Białystok, Gdynia, Poznan´,
Warszawa) [30]. Four scientific conferences were held (Poznan´
1996, 2002, 2004 and Warsaw 1999). National Reference
Laboratories for serologic AE differentiation were organized
[31]. Based on the information from five clinical centers the first
attempt was made in 1998 to register the AE cases using the
EurEchinoReg programme [1]. In 2003 in an effort to formalize
and extend the register, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate (CSI) of
Poland was asked to continue the National AE Register.
Preliminary data of CSI were presented during CSI Conference
in Warsaw, 2006 (unpublished).
In the treatment of AE in humans chemotherapy (mainly with
albendazole (ABZ)) and radical surgery are used. In Poland
treatment with albendazole meets difficulties because the high cost
of the drug.
We aim to analyse the clinical and epidemiological data on 121
autochthonous human AE cases registered by CSI in Poland in the
years 1990–2011, collected by retrospective and prospective
analysis and as well as an active epidemiological field surveys.
The results of this analysis were partly reported at conferences in
2010 [11].
Materials and Methods
Identification and definition of AE human cases
The studies were conducted in areas with a high prevalence of
E. multilocularis in foxes. Retrospective, current and prospective
analysis of persons, was done by using clinical, laboratory and field
data. The most numerous group of patients emerged from the
persons who presented at the doctor’s with abdominal pain
(n = 94). An additional 27 cases were detected (n = 16) or suspected
cases confirmed (n = 11) during field studies carried out in the
years 1997–2008, when a total of 7308 serum samples were
collected from persons living in areas with high prevalence of
E.multilocularis in foxes. The respective cases were categorized
based on the criteria described by Brunetti et al. [10]. The
diagnosed cases were defined as: confirmed, probable or possible.
Laboratory investigations
The tissue specimens taken during liver biopsy and/or surgery
were sent for histopathology, ultrastructural and molecular studies
to confirm the diagnosis. The histological preparations were
stained with haematoxylin and eosin and by the Periodic acidSchiff (PAS) technique [10]. Such techniques as trichrom and
Azan-staining, as well as ultrastructural investigations by transmission electron microscope were also included [32]. Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed according to the procedure
described by Dinkel et al. [33] and Myjak et al. [24]. The
following serological tests were used: indirect haemagglutination
test (IHA) (Echinoccocose_HAkit, bioMe˙rieux, France), Enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-IgG (Immunodiagnostica
Gmbh, Germany) or ELISA-IgG (Bordier Affinity Products S.A.
Crissier, Switzerland) detects IgG antibodies to Echinococcus spp;
ELISA Em2plus (Bordier Affinity Products S.A.) – which detects
antibodies to E. multilocularis and as a confirmation test immunoblotting (Western-blot) (LDBIO, France), which helps to differentiate between E. granulosus and E. multilocularis in 70% cases. All
tests were applied and read according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Serological tests were carried out mostly in 3 scientific
diagnostic laboratories: Department of Tropical Parasitology
Medical University of Gdan´sk (DTP MUG) (59 cases, 48,8%–
384 serum samples), Department of Parasitology National Institute
of Hygiene (DP NIH) (33 subjects, 27.3%–39 serum samples) and
Department and Clinic of Tropical and Parasitic Diseases Medical
Uniwersity of Poznan´ (DCTPD MUP) (17 cases, 14%–49 serum
samples). Molecular studies were performed in DTP MUG (20
cases, 16.5%) and ultrastructural investigations in the Department
of Medical Biology Medical University of Warsaw (DMB MUW)
(9 patients, 7.4%). The histopathological examinations were
conducted in local hospitals where the subjects were treated.
Clinical investigations
Most AE affected patients - 95 (78%) were hospitalized in the
specialised clinical centers: Department of Tropical and Parasitic
Diseases Medical University of Gdan´sk (DTPD MUG) (52
patients, 43%), Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology
Medical University of Białystok (DIDH MUB (16 patients,13.2%),
DCTPD MUP (16 subjects, 13.2%), Department of Infectious
Author Summary
Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a consequence of
accidental ingestion of the eggs of the tapeworm
Echinococcus multilocularis. AE constitutes a serious and
increasing medical and epidemiological problem in many
countries including Poland. The natural environments with
a high AE prevalence are the areas where the definitive
hosts (foxes, raccoons) and the intermediate hosts
(rodents) live. The increasing population of infected foxes
that penetrate nearby the village and urban buildings and
infected dogs poses a certain risk to human health. This
report is a joint clinical and epidemiological analysis of 121
AE cases recorded in the years 1990–2011 in Poland. The
highest percentage of E. multilocularis infected foxes in the
north-eastern regions of Poland (about 40% of the
examined population infected) bears a clear-cut relation
to the highest incidence of detected AE human cases in
those areas. An epidemiological and clinical survey of the
local population conducted for over a dozen years has
contributed to the discovery of several new AE cases.
Alveolar echinococcosis in humans caused by Echinococcus
multilocularis infection belongs to the emerging diseases
in Poland where a continuous increase in the detection
rate was noticed during the last two decades.

Diseases of Voivodeship Hospital in Szczecin (5 cases, 4.1%) as
well as in the surgical divisions: Chair and Department of General,
Transplant & Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw
(CDGTLS MUW) (29 patients, 24%, including 12 liver transplantations and other major surgical procedures) and II Chair and
Department of General & Vascular and Oncological Surgery
Medical University of Warsaw (CDGVOS MUW) (12 patients,
9.9%, including 9 cases of major surgery). The remainder (n = 26,
21.5%) were hospitalized in nonacademic hospitals. Some
individuals were treated in two or three clinical centers.
When possible (mostly in CDGTLS MUW, CDGVOS MUW
and DCTPD MUP) the diagnosed 34 AE cases were assigned to
one of the clinical Parasitic-Neighbouring-Metastasis (PNM) coded
groups [34]. PNM grading is based on staging of neoplasm and
determines appropriate treatment decisions, the duration of
chemotherapy and may also provide prognostic information.
The written consent of the Local Ethics Commission of the
Medical University of Gdan´sk was obtained to perform the
epidemiological and clinical field studies (routine clinical diagnostic procedures being carried out during hospitalization). We
obtained a written consent from every patient involved.
Results
Diagnostic data
In 1990–2011 a total of 121 new AE cases (incidence 0.014)
have been diagnosed, including 27 (22.3%) cases found during
field studies in endemic areas screened for human AE. These 121
cases of alveolar echinococcosis include also 12 cases diagnosed in
the nineties and reported to the EurEchinoReg [1].
Suspicion of AE was mainly based on ultrasonography (US)
examination of the liver. This finding was usually followed by
serologic tests, in conjunction with clinical and imaging studies, the
results of which were regarded as an indication to treatment with
albendazole or surgery.
Serologic tests were performed in 114 subjects (94.2%). In 4
patients in the initial stage of the investigation the above tests were
not done, whereas information on diagnostic issues was missing in
three patients. Immunoblotting (Western-blot) was used to study
106 serum samples (87.6% patients), ELISA Em2plus in 104 cases
(86%), ELISA–IgG was performed in 84 cases (69.4%), whereas
IHA in 17 (14%). Histopathological examinations were carried out
in 84 (69.4%) patients, ultrastructural studies in 9 (7.4%) subjects
and molecular studies (PCR) in 20 (16.5%).
Out of the 121 cases recorded, 83 (68.6%) were classified as
confirmed, 16 (13.2%) as probable and 22 (18.2%) were classified
into the ‘‘possible’’ category according to the Brunetti et al. criteria
[10]. In some individual cases it was difficult to fulfill all the
diagnostic criteria. As confirmed AE cases were also regarded
those positive according to the clinical, epidemiological and
imaging criteria, but were negative serologically (4 cases) or the
serological tests were not performed (4 cases), and or a specific test
(ELISA–Em2plus or western blot) turned out to be positive, but
another specific test was negative (5 cases) or was not performed
(10 cases).
According to the accepted criteria [10], 32 (26.4%) patients, in
whom either histopathological or molecular studies were not done
but the serological tests were performed, were classified into the
‘‘probable’’ or ‘‘possible’’ categories in spite of the fact that the
epidemiological, clinical and imaging criteria were in favour of
AE.
Epidemiological data
In successive 5 year periods under investigation (1990–2011)
there was a steady increase in the detection of AE cases in Poland,
the most significant rise being observed in the years 2005–2009 (55
cases, 45.5%), however over 23 months of 2010–2011 as many as
23 new AE cases have been diagnosed (Fig. 1).
Among the 121 patients recorded, 65 (53.7%) were females and
56 (46.3%) males (M: F ratio – 0.86/1.0).
Age at the diagnosis of 118 persons infected with AE ranged
from 6 to 82 years, (mean age 47.6). The age of 3 women and one
man could not be determined. Specifically, in 62 women the age
varied from 6 to 82 years (mean 49.2 years), in 55 men from 10 to
77 years (mean 45.7 years) (Table 1). AE was most commonly
diagnosed in the age group 41 to 50 years (Fig. 2).

During the observation period 23 persons died (19%) aged from
24 to 87 years, an average of 50.8, the highest death rate was in 51
to 60 years (Fig. 2). The immediate cause was: the progress of the
AE or its complications, and in five cases, another concomitant
disease (e.g. heart failure). The average survival time after
diagnosis was 4.54 years, ranging from 2 months to 15 years.
Four of the cases were children aged 6, 10, 11 and 11 years,
which indicates a very early exposure to E. multilocularis. All four
children live in a rural area. Their illness was diagnosed in the
years 2005–2008, in one case as confirmed and in the three as
possible. Two children were treated with albendazole and, in
addition to oral therapy, one of them underwent surgical removal
of the hepatic lesion. Unfortunately, no insight into the patients’
files of the remaining two children was not possible.
One hundred eighteen cases of AE in humans in Poland were
observed in 12 of 16 provinces (in 54 of total 379 districts -14%).
These cases were distributed unevenly, the largest number (65
cases, 53.7%) was recorded in the Varmia and Masuria Province
(Fig. 3 A, B) and Podlaskie (11 cases) (north eastern Poland) (Fig. 3
A). The origin of three patients could not be determined.
The highest incidence of detected AE cases was in the Varmia –
Masuria Province (Table 2). In this Province, the highest average
yearly incidence (over 2/100 000) of recorded AE cases occurs in 4
communities: Srokowo, Barciany, Budry and Kiwity located in
three districts. Furthermore in the two other communities:
Młynary and Zalewo the incidence was 1.95–1.97.
Family aggregation of the 9 cases (7.4%) was observed in 4
focuses. In one of them the afflicted persons were: a mother and
two daughters, in another one a brother and a sister [21], in the
third focus two brothers, in the fourth focus: mother and son. Out
of these patients only 3 are still alive. The 3 focuses were identified
in areas of a high prevalence of E. multilocularis in foxes.
An overwhelming majority of the patients (73.1%) were living in
rural areas and had a long – lasting occupational or/and environmental contact with the forest (going bilberry picking and mushrooming. As many as 87 (72%) of the patients had its own household dog.
Clinical data
In all 121 cases, the liver was the primary location of AE. In
most cases – 81 (74%) liver was the only affected organ, but in 30
(25.8%) patients there was a spread to other organs either in the
form of metastatic dissemination (M – metastases) or infiltration of
adjacent structures (mainly the bile ducts).
Metastases were found in the lung – 11 cases, the brain – 4
cases, the peritoneum – 3 cases, multiorgan dissemination – 4
cases, metastatic involvement of the ovary was evidenced in 2
patients, of the lymph nodes – 3 cases, bony metastasis to the crus
tibia – 1 case, metastatic involvement of the prostate and
gallbladder – 1 case of each location; infiltration of the liver
vessels and adjacent internal organs was recognized in 6 cases.
Liver failure occurred in 6 patients, renal failure imposing the
necessity of chronic dialysis in 3 subjects.
Chemotherapy with albendazole was instituted in at least 94
(77.7%) patients including the ‘‘during and after surgery’’ cases.
There was some irregularity in taking albendazole due to its price
and availability as well as difficulties of rural patients in contacting
the specialized medical centres.
Toxic effects of albendazole were noted at least in 8 (6.6%)
patients taking the forms of hepatitis (n = 4), leucopenia (n = 4), alopecia
(n = 2). Consequently, in four cases it led to ABZ treatment

interruption and to initiation of the treatment with nitazoksanide
(‘‘Alinia’’). The treatment has not been continued because of lack
of registration of the drug and its high cost. In patients treated with
Alinia no signs of liver damage have been observed.
AE – related surgery, sometimes repeated was performed in 73
(60.3%) patients. Out of the above subjects, 15 patients underwent
liver transplantation. In 43 patients surgery consisted in hepatic
lobectomy, segmentectomy or excision of the local parasitic lesion.
In 15 patients diagnostic laparotomy was undertaken, followed by
no further surgery. 26 subjects were spared from any surgical
procedure. Detailed date on treatment were absent in 22 patients.
In the clinic CDGTLS MUW, 29 patients were hospitalized, of
whom 26 patients were operated because of AE (8 women and 18
men). In the surgically treated group, there were 12 liver
transplantations, 11 liver resections with the intention of the
radical operation and three explorative or diagnostic laparotomies.
In these 26 patients, clinical severity assessed according to PNM
classification was as follows: Stage I - 4 patients, stage II - 3
patients, stage IIIa - 2 patients, stage III B - 9 patients, and stage
IV - 8 patients. The wide range of operations in individual
patients, was as follows: 12 patients – orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), 6 patients – right hemihepatectomy, one patient –
right hemihepatectomy extended to segment IV, 1 patient - central
liver resection, 2 – left hemihepatectomy, 1 – left lateral
bisegmentectomy.
In 13 patients there were no complications, in 2 patients biliary
fistula was formed, there was a case of pleural effusion, pneumonia
in one, in 4 postoperative cases wound infections developed
pulmonary embolism occurred in one and two patients died. One
patient died after right hemihepatectomy extended to segment IV.
The second patient died after 1.5 years of successful transplantation, due to necrosis of the small intestine in the course of the
gastrointestinal obstruction.
In the clinic CDGVOS MUW, 12 AE patients have been
hospitalized, while 9 subjects (5 women and 4 men) underwent
major hepatic surgery. The PNM grading was as follows: stage
IIIA – 1 patient, IIIB – 3 patients, stage IV – 5 subjects. Major
hepatic resections were usually accompanied by additional surgical
procedures (duodenal surgery, right lung tumorectomy, partial
resection of the diaphragm, operation on the common bile duct,
and operation on the ileum and adjacent iliac muscles, partial
excision of the portal vein and inferior vena cava, as well as an
external drainage of the cyst cavity). The weight of the removed
parasite containing tissues varied from 498 to 2470 grams (the
average 1214 grams). The duration of follow – up after operation
varied from 10 months to 16 years [35].

In total 35 patients underwent surgery in the reference
specialised surgical clinics. Other surgical procedures (including
three OLT) in 38 AE patients were performed in different surgical
wards in Poland.
Discussion
In the period of investigations (1990–2011) a steady increase in
the incidence of AE cases in Poland was noted (Fig. 1). A similar
tendency was also observed in Germany [1] and in Lithuania [4–
5], whereas in France [1,3] and in Austria [1] the incidence rate
remained at a constant level.
The presented group of 121 autochthonous human AE cases
sets Poland in the rank of other European countries (France,
Switzerland, Germany and Poland) with the number of recorded
AE cases exceeding 120.
Human AE cases were found in 12 among 16 Provinces in
Poland. Their geographical distribution was not equal. The
highest detection was observed in the Varmia – Masuria and
Podlasie Provinces located in the north – eastern part of Poland)
(Fig. 3 A, B). These Provinces are very close to Lithuania (surface:
65 300 km2
, 3.4 million inhabitants), where between 1997 and
July 2006 as many as 80 human AE cases were diagnosed [4], and
rose up to 96 by July 2008 [5]. These facts are suggestive of a
certain underestimation of the incidence of human AE cases in the
above region. The real number of human AE cases in Poland is
presumably much higher. Real number of the unreported cases
may be caused by: the non-diagnosed AE cases (probably due to
diagnostic difficulties), misdiagnosed usually as primary or
secondary malignancies of the liver, the cases with imprecise
diagnosis ‘‘Echinococcus – caused disease’’, as well as true AE
cases remained unreported to State Epidemiological Sanitary
Inspection, despite of the fact that a legal obligation to report all
AE cases is in force.
Although the red fox is the definitive host of E. multilocularis, the
epidemiological data suggest that also dogs and cats play a more
and more important role in the transmission of the parasite onto
man [36–38]. Some authors believe, these animals pose a major
threat to man [7].
In 2003, prof. Pawłowski, who [39] initiated a program of
modern diagnostics and registration of AE patients in Poland and
coordinated it with the European operations [1] has decided to
pass the further studies and registration to CSI.
This report, based on a planned multi-center clinical study, as
well as field studies is the up-dated collection of data on all human
AE cases diagnosed and treated in Poland.
The rise in the number of established human AE cases in
Poland is allegedly due to several factors: it may be associated with
an increase in red fox population causing an increased risk of
infection [14], but also it may be a result of the introduction of
imaging techniques and modern diagnostic methods (histochemical, ultrastructural, serologic and molecular) to general diagnostic
practice. Also increased public and medical practitioners’ awareness of the possibility AE can play a part in early and effective
disease detection. It should be kept in mind that wild fruits and
mushrooms as well as garden fruits and vegetables can not be
ruled out as a source of infection. Recently we detected the DNA
of E.multilocularis in 13% of samples taken from fruits and
vegetables (Szostakowska et al. 2012). The role of the dog and
cat in AE transmission cannot be clarified at present through lack
of the relevant studies in Poland.
In DTP MUG [24], DCTPD UMP [26] and DP NIH [40] a
routine serological diagnosis of AE based on 3 commercial tests
was introduced in the nineties, and since 2000 molecular diagnosis
of AE has been employed in DTP MUG [24]. The Poznan´
Clinical (DCTPD UMP) instituted the serological studies involving
the adhesive particles aimed at evaluating the clinical course and
the degree of advancement of alveolar echinococcosis of the liver
in humans [41].
However it should be taken into consideration that there is no
unique ‘gold standard’ in diagnosis of AE, only a combination of
clinical trials, imaging and laboratory diagnostic techniques can
allow to diagnose a confirmed, probable or possible invasion.
The detection rate for human AE among people who live in the
endemic areas in the northern part of the Varmia – Masuria
Province (Table 2) was very high, in particular in the communities
of Srokowo, Barciany, Budry and Kiwity. According to Eckert and
Deplazes [9], the annual incidence of human AE in Europe varies
from 0.01–0.3/100.000 inhabitants depending on the country. A
local annual incidence of two or more AE cases per 100 000 is
regarded as a high endemic area. As can be seen in Table 2 this
criterion of high endemicity was fulfilled for 4 communities of the
Varmia – Masuria Province. These communities are located in the
formerly German (until 1945) East Prussia (Ost – Preussen)
territory, whereas now three of them border the Russian
Kaliningrad enclave. Fife AE cases (including 5 affecting members
of a family) were recorded in the Srokowo community with a
population of 4293 inhabitants. This is a sparsely populated,
marshy, woodland, with a high population of the red fox (Vulpes
vulpes) and raccoons dogs (Nycterentes procyonoides). Furthermore in
two other communities the incidence was 1.97/100 000. It should
be emphasized that the average detection rate for human AE in
the Varmia – Masuria Province in the years 1990–2011 was 0.20
as compared with 0.014 per 100 000 inhabitants in all the country
(Table 2).
Since the beginning of AE project it was decided that one
experienced surgery center should be selected in a medical
university. In fact there were two surgical clinics in Medical
University of Warsaw. There were a total of 35 surgeries done
including 12 OLTs.
Thus, out of a total of 725 liver transplantations performed in
CDGTLS MUW from January 1989 to December 2008, 11 livers
were transplanted because of AE (6.4%), the main indication being
parasitic bile duct infiltration and resultant cholestasis (in the years
1990–2011 were 1034 transplantations in this 14 with AE). This
percentage is over twelvefold higher than in the material of
European Liver Transplantation Registry, presented in 2005, in
which among 79 044 LT cases, parasitic disease (not only AE) was
reported in 3.0% of the cases [29]. In our material, cumulative 1, 5
and 10 year recurrence – free survival rates after OLT in the
alveolar echinococcosis group of patients were: 100%, 91% and
74.3% respectively [29]. Apart from few indications, liver
transplantation is abandoned in favour of major resections and
palliative, sometimes multistage surgery. An aggressive surgical
management involving removal of the possibly largest mass of the
parasite provides beneficial conditions for chemotherapy and
prolongs survival in advanced AE cases [35].
The results indicate the need of a wider national programme for
implementation of screening (US, seroepidemiology) in the highest
AE risk areas (north-eastern Poland) and increase of the public
awareness of the possibility of contracting E. multilocularis and its
consequences, and above all, training of the primary care
physicians in the recognition of the risk of AE to allow for an
early detection of this dangerous disease. This is consistent with
the recommendations developed at the Swiss International
Exploratory Workshop ‘‘Alveolar Echinococcosis in Poland,
Lithuania and Switzerland’’. Zurich, 2010, 17–19.11 (unpublished
report).
