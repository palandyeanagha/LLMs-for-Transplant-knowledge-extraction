Abstract
Metabolism and effects on platelet function of 6 g/d for 6 d of
either eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5w-3) or docosahexaenoic acid (DCHA, C22:6w-3) in volunteers were compared in a
randomized crossover study. Incorporation kinetics revealed that
EPA appeared in plasma free fatty acids and plasma phospholipids after 4 h, but was not incorporated into platelet phosphatidylcholine and -ethanolamine until day 6. This indicates that
platelet fatty acid composition does not immediately reflect that
of the surrounding plasma milieu, but rather may be determined
during megakaryocyte maturation. Importantly, EPA was not
incorporated into platelet phosphatidylinositol or -serine in vivo,
thus reflecting selective biosynthesis of platelet phospholipids.
After dietary EPA, C22:5w-3 increased in plasma and platelet
phospholipids. In contrast, DCHA-levels were unaltered. After
DCHA-ingestion, C20:5w-3 concentrations rose in plasma phospholipids, implying that retroconversion took place. These findings indicate that dietary DCHA can serve as a source of EPA.
During this short-term study, ingestion of both EPA and DCHA
resulted in reduced platelet aggregation in response to collagen.
The response to ADP was lowered significantly only by DCHA.
After either EPA or DCHA, thromboxane formation was unchanged in serum derived from clotted whole blood as was total
in vivo synthesis measured by excretion of immunoreactive 2,3-
dinor thromboxane B2/3. We conclude that DCHA reduces
platelet responsiveness, contributing to the antithrombotic effects
of w-3 fatty acid-rich fish oil ingestion, of which DCHA is a
major component.

investigation in animals, volunteers, and patients. Their antithrombotic and antiinflammatory properties imply prophylactic
and therapeutic potential (1-6). In humans, eicosanoids from
EPA are less thrombogenic and less proinflammatory than those
derived from arachidonic acid (7-10). Additional benefits may
be attributable to the plasma lipid-lowering action ofdietary fish
oils and fractions derived therefrom (3, 11-14). We recently
carried out a detailed metabolic study of time and dose relationships of long-term dietary cod liver oil supplementation (15).
These reports involved the use of fish and fish oils, i.e., mixtures
of fatty acids, of which both EPA and DCHA are major constituents.
It is not known whether DCHA exerts antithrombotic effects
of its own during intake of mixtures containing w-3 fatty acids.
Therefore, we performed a randomized crossover study designed
to compare individual metabolic and functional effects of the
purified w-3 fatty acids, EPA, and DCHA in male volunteers. It
will be shown that dietary DCHA can be retroconverted to EPA
in humans. Interestingly, DCHA by itself reduces platelet responsiveness, and contributes therefore to the antithrombotic
properties of fish and fish oils. Moreover, the results indicate
that platelet phospholipid fatty acid composition may be determined during cell maturation.
Methods
Study protocol. Seven healthy male volunteers, 29-38 yr of age, weight
58-82 kg, were recruited from hospital staff. Informed consent was obtained. The volunteers were advised to take vitamin E (100 mg/d), refrain
from all drug intake, and to exclude dietary fish for I wk before and
during the study periods. After an overnight fast, venipuncture was performed with minimal venous stasis on an antecubital vein with 19-gauge
butterfly sets before and after the 6-day intake of either 6 g EPA or
DCHA ethylester. 24-h urine samples were obtained at these time points.
Four volunteers were randomized to receive EPA initially, and after a
10-wk interval the DCHA regimen was administered. One volunteer was
unable to participate in his second (DCHA) phase ofthe study for personal
reasons. In a randomized subset of four volunteers, blood was drawn for
determination of fatty acid composition of plasma, phospholipids in
plasma, and platelet phospholipid subclasses, before, 4, 8, and 24 h as
well as after 6 d of EPA supplementation. All volunteers were unaware
whether they received EPA or DCHA, and all analyses were performed
without knowledge of the type of dietary supplementation.
Materials. Capsules containing 0.5 g of 83% pure EPA ethylester
(other major component DCHA, 4.2%), were from R/P Scherer (Eberbach, Federal Republic of Germany). Capsules containing 0.25 g of 90%
pure DCHA ethylester (other major component C22:5w-3, 5.5%, EPA
<1%) were from Nippon Oil and Fats, Tokyo, Japan. The capsule content
was verified by gas-liquid chromatography. All other materials have been
recently described ( 1 5, 16).
Methods. Fatty acid analyses in plasma and of phospholipids in
plasma and platelets were performed as described (15). Platelet phos2446 C. von Schacky and P. C. Weber

Results
Fatty acid alterations. Supplementation of the diet with either
EPA or DCHA for 6 d induced significant qualitative and quantitative changes in plasma free fatty acids and in phospholipids
of plasma and platelets (Figs. 1 and 2). Despite significant increases in plasma levels of EPA, platelet EPA remained constant
over a 24-h period (Fig. 1). Ingested EPA was not incorporated
into platelet phosphatidylinositol or -serine at any time (detection
limit of EPA was 1% relative to arachidonate). This confirms
and extends our previous study with fish oil (16). In the subsequent 5 d, levels of 20:5w-3 almost tripled in plasma phospholipids as well as in platelet phosphatidylcholine and -ethanolamine (Fig. 1).
During dietary EPA, 22:5w-3 changed minimally in the first
24 h, but this was followed by a significant rise in all compartments, whereas 22:6w-3 remained at control values (Fig. 1).
DCHA ingestion resulted in a doubling of control levels in
both plasma and platelet phospholipids. However, this was accompanied by an unanticipated increase in 20:5w-3 in plasma
phospholipids, which could only have resulted from retroconversion of DCHA (Fig. 2). With regard to 22:5w-3, a small but
significant decrease in plasma and platelet phospholipids was
noted during DCHA ingestion (Fig. 2).
Significant changes ofany other fatty acid were only observed
during EPA supplementation. Arachidonic acid decreased in
plasma free fatty acids, whereas linoleic acid decreased in both
plasma and platelet phospholipids (data not shown).

gregation ex vivo in response to collagen was reduced after both
DCHA and EPA. In contrast, the response to ADP was reduced
only after DCHA but not after EPA.
TX formation. Formation of immunoreactive TXB2/3 in
clotted whole blood did not change significantly after either EPA
or DCHA (Fig. 3, right). The excretion rate of urinary immunoreactive 2,3-dinor TXB2/3 was unaltered in volunteers with
normal basal excretion rates, but it decreased in the one volunteer
with high control excretion rates after both EPA and DCHA.
Safety. All volunteers were repeatedly questioned concerning
side effects, and no side effects were reported. Laboratory studies
of blood, urine, and chemistries were unremarkable during the
study.
Discussion
In this study we compared the metabolism and effects on platelet
aggregation of the two major w-3 fatty acids in fish oil, EPA and
DCHA individually. The major findings are: (a) retroconversion
of dietary DCHA to EPA took place; (b) platelet responsiveness
was reduced by DCHA, a major component of fish and fish oils;
(c) platelet phospholipid fatty acid composition may be defined
during cell maturation.
Fatty acid metabolism. The unexpected increase of 20:5w3 in plasma phospholipids of volunteers ingesting 22:6w-3 represents a retroconversion phenomenon. This has only been reported previously in the rat and in vitro (17, 18). Thus, DCHA
may serve as a "reservoir" for EPA via partial j3-oxidation (19)
and saturation of the resulting trans-double bond (17).
In this study, dietary EPA was not metabolized to DCHA,
which is consistent with a previous report (20). The significance
of the small quantity of 22:5w-3 observed after dietary EPA remains to be determined (21). EPA actually accumulated in
plasma free fatty acids and even more so in plasma phospholipids
(Fig. 1). In contrast, dietary supplementation with dihomo-ylinolenic acid (C20:3w-6), found in evening primrose oil, does
not lead to 20:3w-6 accumulation, in that it is rapidly desaturated
to arachidonic acid (3). Thus EPA, but not C20:3w-6, is metabolically available over a period of time as an eicosanoid precursor after dietary intake.
24 h after EPA ingestion, its content in platelet phosphatiFigure 3. Ex vivo platelet aggregation (left) and ex and

dylethanolamine and -choline was substantially unchanged. In
contrast, at this time point, EPA had already increased fivefold
in plasma free fatty acids and doubled in plasma phospholipids
(Fig. 1). Interestingly, 6 d of EPA ingestion was required before
an increase in EPA content of platelet phosphatidylethanolamine
and -choline was observed. These results extend our previous
conclusions (15) that blood cells do not incorporate EPA from
the surrounding plasma milieu in large quantities. Rather, phospholipid fatty acid composition is determined to a considerable
extent during the formative stages of these cells. Alternatively,
a slow rate of incorporation of fatty acids into circulating platelets, which would also be different from the much faster incorporation in vitro, could account for the above results.
EPA was not incorporated into platelet phosphatidylinositol
or -serine throughout the study. This emphasizes previous observations, in which mixtures of dietary co-3 fatty acids were
administered to man (16, 22, 23). It is unlikely that short-term
incorporation of EPA into phosphatidylinositol with a subsequent transacylation into phosphatidylethanolamine and -choline occurred. The selective incorporation of dietary EPA differs
markedly from the in vitro situation, wherein radioactive EPA
is avidly incorporated into all platelet phospholipid subclasses
(cf. Reference 16), independent ofthe simultaneous presence of
labeled arachidonic acid (24). Thus the metabolic fate ofdietary
EPA in vivo reflects specific control mechanisms which are undetectable in vitro.
Platelet aggregation. Dietary DCHA reduced platelet aggregation in response to both ADP and collagen. This is the first
demonstration of an effect of purified dietary DCHA on platelet
function in humans. Importantly, EPA levels in the platelets
remained constant during DCHA intake. Therefore, reduced
platelet aggregation by dietary DCHA cannot be attributed to
the EPA resulting from retroconversion and, thereby, induction
and formation of the inactive compound TXA3.
In vitro, DCHA (150 AM) inhibits platelet aggregation (25).
Using lower concentrations (2-10 ,uM), we did not observe such
inhibition of platelet aggregation (unpublished results). Human
platelets and neutrophils, enriched with dietary w-3 fatty acids,
do not release detectable amounts of DCHA upon stimulation
ex vivo (26), and 7- and 14-hydroxy-DCHA, the major in vitro
metabolites (26-28), are only found in traces ex vivo (26).

Therefore, interference with platelet function by hydroxy-DCHA
seems unlikely. Thus, the mechanism by which DCHA reduces
platelet aggregation responsiveness ex vivo remains to be clarified.
In this 6-d study, 6 g daily of purified dietary EPA reduced
the ex vivo platelet response to collagen but not to ADP (Fig.
3). This observation was reported in another study after 2 wk
of purified dietary EPA (3.6 g/day, Reference 20). An additional
2 wk of EPA resulted in further inhibition of platelet responsiveness, including that to ADP (20). We conclude that dietary
DCHA reduces platelet responsiveness more efficiently than EPA
does. Thus, inhibition of platelet function, observed upon ingestion ofdietary fish and fish oils containing both EPA and DCHA
(2-4, 15, 23), is attributable in part to DCHA.
Thromboxane formation was measured in serum from clotted whole blood, in which ex vivo platelet stimulation was presumed to be maximal. In this short-term study, neither EPA
nor DCHA affected immunoreactive TXB2/3 formation in the
test system (Fig. 3). We previously reported that, after long-term
w-3 fatty acid ingestion, there was a reduction of TXB2 and
immunoreactive TXB2/3 as measured by this test (15). Thus,
duration of supplementation may be important for eicosanoid
production upon maximal stimulation, in that, e.g., ionophorestimulated leukotriene B4 production decreased after 6 wk, but
was unchanged after 3-4 wk of w-3 fatty acid supplementation
(9, 10). Consistent with our previous report utilizing long-term
dietary fish oil supplementation (15), normal excretion rates of
urinary 2,3 dinor-TXB2/3 were unaltered, whereas elevated excretion rates were reduced in this short-term study. This may
be attributed to reduction ofincreased in vivo platelet activation
by ingestion of both EPA and DCHA.
In summary, we have demonstrated, for the first time, retroconversion of dietary DCHA to EPA in humans. DCHA
ingestion resulted in a greater reduction of platelet aggregation
than EPA ingestion. Thus, DCOA is an important factor in the
antithrombotic effects of fish oil rich in w-3 fatty acids. In addition, our results indicate that platelet fatty acid composition
does not immediately reflect that of the plasma milieu, but may
be defined during cell maturation.
