Abstract
Objective To evaluate the added role of T1-weighted (T1w)
gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine penta-acetic
acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) compared with T2-weighted MRC
(T2w-MRC) in the detection of biliary leaks.
Methods Ninety-nine patients with suspected biliary complications underwent routine T2w-MRC and T1w contrastenhanced (CE) MRC using Gd-EOB-DTPA to identify biliary
leaks. Two observers reviewed the image sets separately and
together. MRC findings were compared with those of surgery
and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiopancreatography.
The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the techniques in
identifying biliary leaks were calculated.
Results Accuracy of locating biliary leaks was superior with
the combination of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC and
T2w-MRC (P<0.05).The mean sensitivities were 79 % vs
59 %, and the mean accuracy rates were 84 % vs 58 % for
combined CE-MRC and T2w-MRC vs sole T2w-MRC.
Nineteen out of 21 patients with biliary-cyst communication, 90.4 %, and 12/15 patients with post-traumatic biliary
extravasations, 80 %, were detected by the combination of
Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC and T2w-MRC images, P
<0.05.
Conclusions Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC yields information that complements T2w-MRC findings and improves
the identification and localisation of the bile extravasations
(84 % accuracy, 100 % specificity, P<0.05). We recommend
Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC in addition to T2w-MRC
to increase the preoperative accuracy of identifying and
locating extravasations of bile.
Key Points
• Magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) does not
always detect bile leakage and cysto-biliary
communications.
• Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC helps by demonstrating
extravasation of contrast material into fluid collections.
• Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC also demonstrates the
leakage site and bile duct injury type.
• Combined Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced and T2w-MRC
can provide comprehensive information about biliary
system.
• Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC is non-invasive and does
not use ionising radiation.

Introduction
Bile leaks can be seen after traumatic or iatrogenic bile duct
injuries, with an estimated incidence ranging from 12 % to
41 %, and communication of a hydatid disease with the
biliary tree has been described in up to 90 % of hepatic
hydatid cysts [1, 2]. Precise and prompt preoperative
localisation of bile leaks is instrumental in determining the
surgical approach and reducing the extent of exploration and
anaesthesia time [2]. Thus, morbidity and mortality rates can
be reduced significantly. For the detection of biliary leakage,
cross-sectional imaging studies including ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) are employed [3, 4]. Although these
techniques provide highly suggestive findings for a diagnosis of biliary leaks in an appropriate clinical setting, they
generally provide non-specific findings (e.g. fluid collection). Further investigation with invasive techniques such
as percutaneous transhepatic cholangiopancreatography
(PTC) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) is
required to confirm the diagnosis by demonstration of active
contrast extravasation from the biliary tree [4–6]. The current algorithm for searching for an extravasation of bile is to
perform abdominal ultrasound and, if the findings are nondiagnostic, to perform T2-weighted (T2w) MRC, which
highlights the biliary tree [7]. The accuracy rate of diagnosis
and localisation of an extravasation of bile by T2w-MRC is
within the range 70–74 % [8]. T1-weighted (T1w) contrastenhanced MRC (CE-MRC) using hepatobiliary contrast
agents such as gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) and
gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine penta-acetic
acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) is a recently emerged technique with
promising results with respect to its ability to visualise nondilated bile ducts and biliary leaks [5–9]. Both Gd-BOPTA
and Gd-EOB-DTPA are incorporated into the hepatocytes
by an anionic transport system after the vascular phase.
Approximately 3–5 % of the injected dose of Gd-BOPTA
and 50 % of Gd-EOB-DTPA are excreted in the human
biliary system [10, 11]. Therefore, Gd-EOB-DTPA may
provide adequate biliary imaging within a shorter period of
time (10–20 min) than Gd-BOPTA (60 min) [12]. Gd-EOBDTPA-enhanced MRC allows detection of active bile leakage and cysto-biliary communication by direct visualisation
of contrast material extravasation into fluid collections and
also demonstrates the anatomical site of the leakage and the
type of bile duct injury [10–12].
Although few case reports demonstrated biliary leakage on contrast-enhanced MRC images, to the best of
our knowledge, no previous study has investigated its
added diagnostic value in comparison to T2w-MRC in a
large series. Therefore, in this study we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced
MRC added to T2w-MRC in the detection of posttraumatic and post-surgical biliary extravasations and
cysto-biliary communications.
Materials and methods
Patients
This prospective study (over a period of 6 months) received
institutional review board approval, and all of the patients
gave written informed consent. One hundred and five patients (60 men and 45 women; mean age 55±6.3 [SD], range
39–74 years) with suspected biliary leak were referred for
MRC. Six patients were excluded owing to claustrophobia
(n=1), previous hypersensitivity to gadolinium (n=2) and
reduced glomerular filtration rate of less than
30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and increased total serum bilirubin over
17 mg/dl (n=3). The remaining 99 patients (56 men
[56.5 %] and 43 women [43.4 %]) constituted the study
group and underwent T2w-MRC and T1w-Gd-EOB-DTPAenhanced MRC. The indications for MRC were suspected
biliary leaks after cholecystectomy (n=24); living donor
liver transplantation (n=14); patients with major liver resection (n=6); pancreaticoduodenectomy (n=5); following
traumatic biliary tract injury (n=20); surgical treatment of
hydatid cysts (n=21); [this group were divided into two
subgroups: cystectomy (n=16) and tube drainage of bile
ducts (n=5)]; and following percutaneous drainage of a
hydatid cyst (n=9); Table 1. The mean duration between

MRC and trauma or surgical and interventional procedures
was 3.4±2.3 days (range, 1–5 days).
MRC protocol
Conventional T2w-MRC and CE-MRC were performed
using a 16-channel phased-array body surface coil on a 3-
T MRI (Magnetom Skyra; Siemens Healthcare, Berlin,
Germany) equipped with high performance gradients (maximum gradient, 45 mT/m; maximum slew rate, 200 T/m/s).
First, T2w-MRC was acquired using half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE) sequences
(TR/TE, 2,000/698 ms; FA, 15°; 3-mm slice thickness;
256×134 matrix) in transverse and coronal planes.
Multiplanar/maximum intensity projection (MPR/MIP) reconstructions specially designed to directly view the contents of the bile and pancreatic ducts were generated. CEMRC was performed using breath-hold three-dimensional
(3D) fat-suppressed gradient echo (GRE) T1w VIBE (volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination) sequence
(TR/TE, 3.89/1.83 ms; FA, 15°; duration 18 s; 3-mm slice
thickness; 256×115 matrix) after intravenous administration
of 0.1 ml/kg (0.25 mmol/kg) Gd-EOB-DTPA (Primovist;
Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) at a rate of
2 ml/s, followed by a bolus of 20 ml saline. Following an
early dynamic phase in a transverse plane, the post-contrast
T1w sequence was repeated in the transverse and coronal
planes at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 min for detection of the biliary
extravasations. In 12 patients with suspected biliary-cyst communications, further delayed imaging at 180 min after intravenous administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA was carried out.
Image evaluation
Two experienced radiologists (13 and 5 years of experience
in abdominal MR imaging) performed image evaluation by
consensus; first, they assessed the images obtained by T2wMRC and recorded all findings. In the post-transplantation
and postoperative groups, information on the type of surgical procedure was obtained from operating surgeons before
MRC image evaluation. After 3.4±2.3 days, the same radiologists performed comparative assessment of the images
obtained by T2w-MRC and T1w-CE-MRC by consensus.
T1w-CE-MRC images were evaluated at 30-60 min after
intravenous administration of Gd-EOB-DTPA for trauma
and postoperative and transplantation group, respectively.
In the hydatid cyst group, these images were evaluated at
60 min to 24 h after intravenous administration of Gd-EOBDTPA. The following parameters were considered in analysis: biliary fistulas (into the peritoneal cavity);
intraparanchymal biliary leakage (biloma); cysto-biliary
communication; the Strasberg classification in the trauma
group; timing of MRC after contrast agent administration.
For each examination, the readers recorded the presence or
absence of biliary leaks (e.g. fistulas, biloma or cysto-biliary
communication) on T2w-MRC and the combined images
(T1w-CE-MRC plus T2w-MRC). All MRC images were
transferred to a workstation (Syngo Via console, software
version 2.0; Siemens Medical Solutions, Berlin, Germany)
for evaluation. After images from the MRC examinations
had been reviewed by consensus, the sensitivity, specificity
and accuracy rates for the presence or absence of biliary
abnormalities were calculated for T2w-MRC and the combination of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC and T2wMRC. All MRC image findings were compared with the
results of the surgical and interventional radiological evaluations findings, or clinical follow-up.
Correlation of MRC with surgical and/or interventional
radiological findings
Two surgeons, with 15 and 12 years of experience with
hepatobiliary and liver transplantation surgery, performed
all surgical explorations. An interventional radiologist with
16 years of hepatobiliary experience performed all interventional radiology procedures. The main aim of surgical exploration and interventional procedures was to determine the
site of bile leakage and provide treatment. Additionally,
biliary tract injuries were determined. All surgical procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. However,

all of the interventional radiological procedures were
performed under local anaesthesia. All surgical and interventional radiological findings, including the location of the
biliary leaks, were recorded (Table 2).
Statistical analysis
We used the Fisher’s exact test to analyse the presence or
absence of biliary abnormalities per site per patient in each
group with the use of T2w-MRC and combined Gd-EOBDTPA-enhanced MRC and T2w-MRC. In all cases, a twotailed P value was determined, and the null hypothesis was
rejected at P<0.05 (see Table 3).
Results
Ninety-nine patients with suspected biliary complications
successfully underwent routine T2w-MRC and T1w CEMRC using Gd-EOB-DTPA.
Biliary leak, confirmed by surgical exploration and interventional radiological procedures was found in 64 of the 99
patients (64.6 %; Table 2). Diagnostic accuracy of T2wMRC alone and of combined images (CE-MRC and T2wMRC) was shown in Tables 4 and 5 (P<0.05).
Of 29 patients undergoing cholecystectomy and
pancreaticoduodenectomy, 13 (44.8 %) showed
abnormalities in the biliary tract, namely biliary fistulas
(n=6) and biliary leakage (n=7). Combined routine T2wMRC and CE-MRC images achieved to demonstrate extravasation in 11 of these patients (84.6 %; P<0.05), whereas
T2w-MRC failed to identify the abnormality in seven patients (false-negative rate, 53.8 %; Fig. 1a-c). Of six patients
undergoing major liver resection, three (50 %) showed
biliary extravasation: biliary fistulas (n=2) and biliary leakage (n=1). In two of these patients, the alteration was
identified on combined T2w-MRC and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC images (false-negative rate, 16 %, P<0.05;
Fig. 2a-c). Of 20 patients with traumatic biliary injury, 15
(75 %) showed bile extravasation: biliary leakage (n=10) and
biliary fistulas (n=5). T2w-MRC diagnosed the abnormality
in six (40 %) of these patients, whereas combined T2w-MRC
and CE-MRC images detected the abnormality in 12 patients
(80 %; P<0.05; Fig. 3a, c). Of 14 patients who underwent
orthotopic liver transplantation, six (42.8 %) had biliary extravasation: biliary leakage (n=4) and biliary fistulas (n=2).
T2w-MRC images detected the abnormality in only two of
these patients (33.3 %; Fig. 4a, b), whereas combined T2wMRC and CE-MRC images delineated the alteration in four
patients (66.7 %; P<0.05; Fig. 5a-c).
Of 21 patients who underwent surgical and interventional
treatment for hydatid cyst, 19 (90.4 %) had cysto-biliary
communication; combined T2w-MRC and CE-MRC images detected the abnormality in 17 of these patients
(89.4 %; P<0.05; Fig. 6a-c). Of nine patients who
underwent percutaneous treatment of a hydatid cyst, eight
(88.9 %) had cysto-biliary communication, and all were
demonstrated by combined T2w-MRC and Gd-EOBDTPA-enhanced MRC images (P<0.05; Fig. 7a-c).
In five patients (20 %) treated with tube-drainage in hydatid
cyst group, cysto-biliary communications were detected on
post-contrast T1w- MRC 30–60 min after contrast agent administration. If visualisation of the biliary tree was insufficient, additional T1w-MRC images were obtained at 60, 120
and 180 min after contrast agent administration. In the
remaining 25 patients with hydatid cyst, additional delayed
MRC images from longer than 60 min after bolus administration of Gd-EOB-DTPAwere obtained because visualisation of

the bile ducts was not sufficient for anatomical diagnosis
within 60 min of contrast agent administration. In 12 out of
25 patients (P<0.05; 48 %) with a hydatid cyst, cysto-biliary
communications were detected on T1w-MRC 180 min after
contrast agent administration, as these alterations were not
detected 60 min after contrast agent administration. At surgical exploration, additional cysto-biliary communications were
detected in only four patients (16 %) who were missed on
T1w-MRC 180 min after contrast agent administration. By
Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced T1w-MRC, biloma collections in
the gallbladder bed or perihepatic region were seen as peripheral nodular puddling similar to the pattern of contrast enhancement cavernous haemangioma (Fig. 7c). The accuracy
of locating biliary leaks was superior using the combination of
Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC and T2w-MRC for each
group (Table 3).
Discussion
Our results show that the addition of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC to standard T2w-MRC significantly increases
the accuracy in detecting bile leaks. When we added the GdEOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC images to the T2w-MRC, both
observers by consensus performed better at identifying the
presence of the bile extravasations.
Computed tomography, ultrasound, T2w-MRC, CEMRC and PTC have been employed to identify bile leaks
[13, 14]. However, surgical exploration remains the most
reliable technique for detecting bile extravasation [15]. CEMRC is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that does not
require ionising radiation and it holds great potential for
biliary imaging. Currently, the following three hepatobiliary
contrast agents are available for CE-MRC: mangafodipir
trisodium (Mn-DPDP, Teslascan; GE Healthcare, Oslo,
Norway), gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA,
MultiHance; Bracco Imaging, Milan, Italy) and
gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine penta-acetic
acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA, gadoxetic acid, Primovist; Bayer
Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) [11]. Fayad et al. [4]
used mangafodipir trisodium for CE-MRC to demonstrate
bile extravasation. However, as Mn-DPDP is a purely
hepatocyte-specific agent it only allows hepatobiliary phase
imaging [16].
Unlike mangafodipir trisodium, Gd-EOB-DTPA and GdBOPTA allows both early dynamic and delayed

hepatobiliary imaging [1, 2, 11–15, 17–20]. Intense enhancement of bile within the common bile duct has been
reported to begin as early as 10 min after contrast material
administration in healthy volunteers, and a 20-min delay
after Gd-EOB-DTPA injection was reported to be sufficient
for biliary evaluation [21–25]. Because Gd-EOB-DTPA uptake is mediated by the same transporter that is responsible
for bilirubin transport, biliary obstruction or diminished
hepatobiliary function can be suspected in patients with
reduced or no visualisation of the biliary tree 20–30 min
after Gd-EOB-DTPA administration [21, 26, 27]. In our
study, hepatobiliary phase images were acquired 10, 20,
30, 60 and 180 min after contrast agent administration to
minimise inter-individual differences in the circulation time.
Bile duct injuries are the most common and most serious
complications associated with biliary surgery, especially
laparoscopic cholecystectomy [28, 29]. Undiagnosed bile
extravasation can be a significant cause of morbidity and
mortality [30]. Traditionally, bile duct injuries have been
classified by using the Bismuth or Strasberg classification.
The Bismuth classification is based on the localisation of
biliary strictures according to the distance from the biliary
confluence but does not encompass the entire spectrum of
bile duct injuries [31]. Therefore, Strasberg et al. [25] made
the Bismuth classification much more comprehensive by
including other types of laparoscopic extrahepatic bile duct
injury (Table 6). Type A, a common form of bile duct injury,
is seen after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and involves
leakage from the cystic duct or the bile ducts of Luschka
[24, 28, 32, 33]. Bile leaks usually manifest within the first
postoperative week, whereas strictures without a bile leak
tend to manifest several months to years after surgery [26].
Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC allows detection of active
bile leakage by direct visualisation of contrast material
extravasation into fluid collections in addition to demonstrating the anatomical site of the leakage and the type of
bile duct injury. Extravasations of bile can be detected
concretely on CE-MRC by their characteristic signs such
as contrast-enhanced biloma and fistula formation [32–35].
Although only 8 of the 16 patients (50 %) with postoperative bile duct injuries were detected by T2w-MRC alone, the
addition of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC images to the
T2w-MRC increased our detection to 13 of these 16 patients
(81.2 %). Aduna et al. [15] detected postsurgical bile duct
injuries on Mn-DPDP-enhanced MRC images with 95 %
sensitivity and 100 % specificity respectively. Vitellas et al.
[16] showed the presence of bile duct leaks after cholecystectomy on mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced MRC images

with 86 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity respectively. In
our study, the sensitivity and specificity of Gd-EOB-DTPAenhanced MRC images were 81.2 % and 100 % respectively
for post-surgical biliary leaks.
Post-traumatic biliary tract injuries are also a significant
cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preoperative
evaluation of biliary duct injury and biloma formation is
very important for surgeons [28, 29, 32–34, 36]. In patients
suspected of having a bile leak, cross-sectional imaging
studies are useful for depicting fluid collection in the gallbladder bed or perihepatic region [30]. Concordantly, CEMRC is also useful for assessing the degree of any obstruction according to the presence or absence of contrast material downstream in the bile duct [29, 35–37]. In patients with
complete obstruction of the bile duct after trauma CE-MRC
imaging shows proximal duct dilatation and lack of excretion of the contrast agent from the bile duct. Salvolini et al.
[18] determined the traumatic biliary injuries on CE-MRC
images, with 64 % sensitivity. In this study we detected 12
(80 % sensitivity) of the 15 patients with biliary injury. The
injuries were accurately detected on the combined images
(CE-MRC and T2w-MRC) before surgical treatment. Thus,
post-traumatic morbidity and mortality were significantly
decreased.
An obstruction is a relatively common complication of
liver transplantation, occurring in up to 20 % of patients
[36]. MRC depicts the site of the biliary anastomosis, the
cause of the obstruction and the status of the biliary ducts
upstream [37]. By using CE-MRC, comprehensive information on the patency of biliary-enteric anastomoses can be
obtained [29, 36, 37]. In our study, four of the six patients
(66 %) with biliary leakage after orthotopic liver transplantation were accurately detected on the combined images
(CE-MRC and T2w-MRC), but biliary leakage in two of
these patients was not detected on the routine T2w-MRC
images. Fulcher and Turner [38] determined 19 of the 25
patients with ductal dilatation after liver transplantation on
routine T2w-MRC images. CE-MRC imaging combined

with T2w-MRC can be helpful in identifying biliary complications after liver transplantation.
In patients with a centrally located type 2 or 3 hepatic
hydatid cyst larger than 10 cm, there is a higher risk of the
cyst being close to the biliary tract [39]. Unless the relationship between the cyst and biliary tract is evaluated before
endoscopic or percutaneous radiological procedures or surgery, alcohol-like scolicidal agents that are injected into the
cyst may pass into biliary system, and cause chemical sclerotic reactions in the biliary tracts [16, 39]. Therefore, CEMRC combined with T2w-MRC imaging plays a role in
detecting a connection between the biliary duct and cyst
when results of T2w-MRC are inconclusive or diagnostically insufficient [16, 29, 36, 37, 39]. Adaletli et al. [35]
demonstrated a case with a fistulous communication between a hepatic hydatid cyst and the gallbladder on T2wMRC images. In this study, 19 of the 21 patients (90.4 %)
who had cysto-biliary communications were identified by
Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC combined with T2w-MRC
imaging before surgical and interventional radiological procedures. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study
has investigated the added diagnostic value of CE-MRC in
comparison to T2w-MRC in hepatic hydatid cysts.
Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC provides functional assessment of the biliary anatomy and detection of biliary
leakage from other fluid collections. With CE-MRC, concrete evidence of contrast agent leakage from the biliary
tract can be obtained, which is not possible with conventional MRC sequences [39–42]. Furthermore, we can evaluate bile duct injury, biliary-enteric anastomosis and
sphincter of Oddi dysfunction; and differentiate biloma from
other pathological conditions on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced
MRC images [10]. At Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRC, filling defects might be masked if contrast material completely
fills the bile duct, a pitfall similar to the one that occurs during
ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)
due to overfilling or superimposition of contrast medium.
Moreover, adequate contrast material filling in the bile duct
requires liver function that is normal or at least not
substantially reduced and a sufficient delay time [13].
As we had excluded the patients with increased total
serum bilirubin over 17 mg/dl, we successfully evaluated the
biliary tree on CE-MRC in our study. We should point
out that the excretion of Gd-EOB-DTPA into the biliary
tree interferes with successful visualisation of biliary
fluid at conventional T2w-MRC, because at a higher

concentration of the contrast material the signal intensity
of bile appears darker on T2w images, owing to the T2-
shortening effect of concentrated contrast material within the bile ducts [24]. Therefore, we acquired conventional T2w-MRC first in order to avoid the darkening
effect of Gd-EOB-DTPA in the biliary tree.
Our study had a few limitations. Firstly, the patient population was relatively small. Our results will need to be
confirmed by a larger prospective study. Secondly, two
experienced radiologists performed image evaluation in
consensus, and we did not determine interobserver variability. Because of the learning curve involved, it would have
been better to assess interobserver agreement. Thirdly, the
sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced were not calculated alone.
We conclude that CE-MRC using Gd-EOB-DTPA and
the 3D GRE technique is a robust tool that displays the
biliary anatomy and provides functional information about
physiological or pathological biliary flow. The added diagnostic properties make it invaluable in the accurate detection
of bile leaks and cysto-biliary communication. Therefore,
CE-MRC can be added to T2w-MRC as a complementary
tool in order to increase the accuracy in the detection of bile
extravasations in selected patients.
