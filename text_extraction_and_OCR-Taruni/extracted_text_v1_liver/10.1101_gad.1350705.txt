Smad transcription factors lie at the core of one of the
most versatile cytokine signaling pathways in metazoan
biology—the transforming growth factor- (TGF) pathway. Recent progress has shed light into the processes of
Smad activation and deactivation, nucleocytoplasmic
dynamics, and assembly of transcriptional complexes. A
rich repertoire of regulatory devices exerts control over
each step of the Smad pathway. This knowledge is enabling work on more complex questions about the organization, integration, and modulation of Smad-dependent transcriptional programs. We are beginning to uncover self-enabled gene response cascades, graded Smad
response mechanisms, and Smad-dependent synexpression groups. Our growing understanding of TGF signaling through the Smad pathway provides general principles for how animal cells translate complex inputs into
concrete behavior.
As evolution unfolded and multicellular life forms
emerged, so did the need for tight control over the ability
of individual cells to move, divide, differentiate, and organize. Intricate intercellular communication systems
evolved to ensure the proper behavior of individual cells
in the context of the whole organism. Among these
forms of communication, one of the most prevalent involves secretory polypeptides that are recognized by
membrane receptors coupled to transcriptional regulatory factors. With its 42 members in the human genome,
seven in Drosophila, and four in Caenorhabditis elegans, the transforming growth factor- (TGF) family is
one of the most prominent representatives of this class
of molecules. TGF and its family members—the
nodals, activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs),
myostatins, anti-Muellerian hormone (AMH), and others—exert profound effects on cell division, differentiation, migration, adhesion, organization, and death.
These factors may be produced by many cell types, as in
the case of TGF, or very few, as in the case of myostatin, and they may be active from the earliest stages of
embryo development through adulthood, as in the case
of the BMPs, or for very limited periods during development, as in the case of AMH. On the whole, the TGF
family provides a paradigm of functional versatility
among hormonally active polypeptides.
The quest to understand how cells read these signals
started as soon as these factors were isolated in the early
1980s and has continued unabated ever since. By now,
we have obtained a fairly robust understanding of the
biochemical backbone of the TGF signaling pathway,
and a growing sense for how cells translate these signals
into responses. At the core of this pathway lie the Smad
transcription factors. TGF induces its membrane receptors to directly activate Smad proteins that then form
transcriptional complexes to control target genes (Fig. 1).
What is not so simple is how these complexes activate or
repress hundreds of target genes at the same time, in the
same cell, and under tightly controlled conditions. This
complexity has been the subject of much research in
recent years and is the focus of the present review. For
more information on the biology of the TGF family, we
would recommend several classical reviews (Letterio
and Roberts 1998; Whitman 1998; Massagué and Chen
2000; Massagué et al. 2000; Derynck et al. 2001; Attisano
and Wrana 2002; Schier 2003). Other recent reviews
(Derynck and Zhang 2003; Siegel and Massagué 2003)
and research articles (Foletta et al. 2003; Ozdamar et al.
2005) cover the emerging topic of Smad-independent
pathways in TGF signaling.
Basic features of the Smad proteins
Eight Smad proteins are encoded in the human and
mouse genomes, four in Drosophila, and three in C. elegans (Massagué 1998). Only five of the mammalian
Smads—Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad5, and Smad8—act
as substrates for the TGF family of receptors; these are
commonly referred to as receptor-regulated Smads, or
RSmads (Fig. 2A). Smads 1, 5, and 8 serve principally as
substrates for the BMP and anti-Muellerian receptors,
and Smads 2 and 3 for the TGF, activin, and Nodal
receptors. Smad4, also referred to as Co-Smad, serves as
a common partner for all RSmads (Fig. 2B). Smad6 and
Smad7 are inhibitory Smads that serve as decoys interfering with Smad–receptor or Smad–Smad interactions.

The Mad protein in Drosophila, which was the first identified member of this family (Raftery and Sutherland
1999), is the ortholog of mammalian Smad1/5, whereas
dSmad2, Medea, and Dad are the orthologs of Smad2/3,
Smad4, and Smad6/7, respectively. The Smad family in
C. elegans includes Sma1, Sma2, and Sma3 (Das et al.
1999). The name “Smad” was coined with the identification of human Smad1 in reference to its sequence
similarity to the Sma and Mad proteins (Liu et al. 1996).
Smad proteins are ∼500 amino acids in length and consist of two globular domains coupled by a linker region
(Fig. 2A; Shi and Massagué 2003). The N-terminal domain, or “Mad-homology 1” (MH1) domain, is highly
conserved in all RSmads and Smad4 but not in Smads 6
and 7. The linker region is quite divergent between the
various subgroups, whereas the C-terminal or MH2 domain is conserved in all Smad proteins. Functional studies, together with the X-ray crystal structure analysis of
the MH1 and MH2 domains, have provided critical insights into the principal interactions of Smad proteins
with other proteins and with DNA. The MH1 domain is
a DNA-binding module stabilized by a tightly bound
zinc atom. The contact with DNA is primarily established by a -hairpin structure, which is conserved in all
the RSmads and Smad4. Interestingly, the most abundant splice form of Smad2 contains an insert (encoded by
exon 3) that blocks DNA binding. The MH1 domain is
followed by the linker region, a flexible segment with
binding sites for Smurf (Smad ubiquitination-related factor) ubiquitin ligases, phosphorylation sites for several
classes of protein kinases, and, in Smad4, a nuclear export signal (NES).
The Smad MH2 domain is highly conserved and is one
of the most versatile protein-interacting modules in signal transduction. RSmads have a conserved C-terminal
motif, Ser–X–Ser, that is phosphorylated by the activated
receptor. A pocket lined with basic residues interacts
with the phosphorylated region of the activated receptor
in the case of RSmads and with the phosphorylated tail
of RSmads in the case of Smad4. A set of contiguous
hydrophobic patches, referred to as the “hydrophobic
corridor”, on the surface of the MH2 domain mediates
interactions with cytoplasmic retention proteins, with
components of the nuclear pore complex (nucleoporins),
and with DNA-binding cofactors. A region overlapping
the linker and MH2 regions (“Smad4 activation domain”, SAD) mediates interactions with transcriptional
activators and repressors (Fig. 2A).
Smad activation and deactivation
The striking ability of Smad proteins to accumulate in
the nucleus in response to TGF or BMP was one of the
early key observations placing Smads downstream of the
TGF receptors (Hoodless et al. 1996; Liu et al. 1996).
Smad proteins undergo a constant process of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, and their nuclear accumulation results from receptor-mediated phosphorylation events
that decrease the affinity of RSmads for cytoplasmic anchors and increase their affinity for nuclear factors (Shi
Figure 1. Functional and structural features of the TGF–Smad pathway. TGF
family members are dimeric ligands that
remain in latent form by binding to their
propeptide, or in trapped form by binding
to occluding factors. On release from these
inactive states, the ligand binds to pairs of
membrane receptor serine/threonine kinases (receptor types I and II), promoting
the formation of a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex. The cytoplasmic region of
the type I receptor contains a canonical
protein kinase domain (purple) preceded
by a regulatory region or GS domain
(green) to which the inhibitor FKBP12 (red)
binds to enforce the inactive basal state.
Phosphorylation of the GS domain by the
type II receptor creates a repeated pS–x–pS
motif that serves as a docking site for receptor-regulated Smad proteins (RSmad).
In the basal state, RSmads and Smad4 undergo a constant nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Anchor proteins capture RSmads for
presentation to the activated type I receptor. Receptor-mediated phosphorylation at
the C terminus of RSmads creates a pS–x–
pS motif (red P), allowing the accumulation of RSmad in the nucleus and the recognition of this motif by a basic pocket in Smad4. The
resulting Smad complex incorporates different DNA-binding cofactors that confer target gene selectivity and influence the recruitment
of either transcriptional coactivators or corepressors. Several hundred genes are regulated by TGF in this fashion, of which two-thirds
are activated by the signal and the rest are repressed. RSmad dephosphorylation terminates the signaling cycle. (Crystal structures
adapted from Shi et al. 1997; Huse et al. 1999, 2001; Wu et al. 2000, 2001b).

and Massagué 2003; Xu and Massagué 2004). Subsequent
dephosphorylation of RSmads causes their return to the
cytoplasm for another round of receptor-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Inman et al.
2002). This ensures a constant sensing of the receptor
activation state by the Smad pathway.
Smad nucleocytoplasmic dynamics
The mechanisms of Smad nuclear import and export
have been extensively studied over the last few years,
particularly in Smads 2, 3, and 4. Interestingly, the
nuclear import of these proteins can occur without the
intervention of nuclear transport factors (Xu et al. 2000,
2002). Many proteins undergoing nuclear translocation
in response to regulatory signals rely on importins, a set
of factors that mediate nuclear import by recognizing a
motif called the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the
cargo proteins (Jans et al. 2000). The classic NLS motif
consists of a cluster of basic residues and is recognized by
importin-. Importin- binds to importin-, which directly interacts with the nuclear pore components—nucleoporins—to negotiate the passage of the importin--
importin--cargo complex into the nucleus (Mattaj and
Englmeier 1998; Gorlich and Kutay 1999). However, the
nuclear translocation of Smad proteins can occur independently of importins because Smad proteins can directly interact with nucleoporins (Xu et al. 2000, 2002).
This interaction maps to the hydrophobic corridor in the
Smad MH2 domain and to the FG repeat region on the
nucleoporins Nup153 and Nup214 (Fig. 3; Xu et al. 2002).
The FG repeat region is also the region for nucleoporin
interaction with importins (Bayliss et al. 2000). Importin-independent transport has also been described for
other signaling factors, including -catenin in the Wnt
signaling pathway (Yokoya et al. 1999) and ERK2 MAP
kinase in response to Ras-mediated mitogenic signals
(Whitehurst et al. 2002).
Some Smad proteins may additionally undergo nuclear
import via importins. A conserved lysine-rich sequence
in the MH1 domain of Smads that resembles classical
NLS motifs was hypothesized, and shown, to interact
with importins (Xiao et al. 2000; Kurisaki et al. 2001).
This conserved lysine-rich sequence forms an -helix
right next to the DNA-binding motif in the MH1 domain, not an extended loop as would be structurally
required for recognition by importin- (Shi et al. 1998;
Chai et al. 2003). Indeed, Smad3 interacts with importin-, not importin- (Xiao et al. 2000; Kurisaki et al.
2001). Importin binding has been detected with overexpressed Smad3 and Smad4 but not Smad2. This inability of Smad2 has been attributed to the presence of
the exon 3-encoded insert in the MH1 domain. One
study comparing the efficiency of Smad3 translocation
by the importin-dependent and -independent mechanism indicated that the importin-dependent process is
considerably weaker (Xu et al. 2003). On balance, it appears that Smads 2, 3, and 4 undergo nuclear import by
means of direct interactions with nucleoporins, and this
process may be aided by importin- in the case of Smads
3 and 4.
The intrinsic asymmetry of the nuclear pore complex,
and the distribution of different nucleoporins along the
span of the pore, are thought to allow proteins docking
on one side of the pore to move unidirectionally to the
other side and vice versa (Rout et al. 2000). Indeed, the
direct interaction of Smads 2 and 3 with nucleoporins
has been shown to enable nuclear export as well as import (Xu et al. 2002). The presence of an NES and the
recognition of this sequence by the general nuclear export factor CRM1, which are necessary for nuclear export of other proteins (Fornerod et al. 1997), are not required for the export of Smads 2 and 3. Interestingly,
these properties are also shared by -catenin (Yokoya et
al. 1999), ERK2 (Whitehurst et al. 2002) and importin-
(Fahrenkrog and Aebi 2003).
Figure 2. Smad proteins and their structural elements.
(A) Smad proteins consist of two conserved globular domains—the MH1 and MH2 domains—and a variable
linker region. The seven mammalian Smad proteins are
listed under their corresponding classes. In RSmads and
Smad4, the MH1 domain contains a -hairpin structure
for binding to DNA. I-Smads lack MH1 domain. The
linker region of RSmads contains multiple phosphorylation sites for MAPKs, CDKs, and other protein kinases. In RSmads and I-Smads, the linker region contains a PY motif for recognition by the WW domains in
Smurf ubiquitin ligases. The linker region of Smad4
contains an NES. The MH2 domain contains a basic
pocket for interaction with activated type I receptors in
the case of the RSmads, and in both the RSmads
and Smad4 for interaction with the pS–x–pS motif (red
ball) of RSmads. On the surface of the MH2 domain in
RSmads, a contiguous set of hydrophobic patches or
hydrophobic corridor serves as a site for multiple interactions (see Fig. 3). (B) Some examples of mammalian TGF family members and their relationships with the five type II receptors,
the seven type I receptors, the five RSmads, and the single Co-Smad. The schematic depicts a hetero-trimeric Smad complex consisting of
two RSmad molecules and one Smad4 (only the MH2 domains are shown). RSmad–Smad4 heterodimers have also been described.
Smad signaling

In the basal state, Smad4 is distributed throughout the
cell and may also undergo a continuous shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 3; Pierreux et
al. 2000; Watanabe et al. 2000; Inman et al. 2002). Receptor-mediated phosphorylation at the C-terminal region of RSmad proteins creates a binding site for Smad4
(Wu et al. 2001b; Chacko et al. 2004). In principle, receptor-phosphorylated RSmads could associate with Smad4
in the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus as a RSmad–
Smad4 complex, or this complex could form after
RSmads enter the nucleus. The site of Smad complex
formation in the cell has not been systematically investigated, and it may depend on the cell type and conditions. Regardless, Smad4 is concentrated in the nucleus
as a result of this interaction.
Unlike the nuclear export of Smads 2 and 3, the export
of Smad4 is dependent on, or at least enhanced by,
CRM1. Smad4 contains a leucine-rich NES in the linker
region that is recognized by CRM1 (Figs. 2A, 3; Pierreux
et al. 2000). The CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B blocks
the nuclear export of Smad4 without interfering with
nuclear export of Smads 2 or 3 (Inman et al. 2002; Xu et
al. 2002). The interaction with receptor-phosphorylated
Smads 2 and 3 is thought to mask the NES in Smad4,
protecting the RSmad–Smad4 complexes from recognition by CRM1 and nuclear export (Watanabe et al. 2000;
Inman et al. 2002). When RSmads are dephosphorylated
and the complex dissociates, the Smad4 NES becomes
exposed again and nuclear export of Smad4 by CRM1 can
proceed. Little is known about other inputs that may
regulate the exposure of the Smad4 NES. However, an
alternatively spliced mammalian Smad4 isoform (Pierreux et al. 2000) and a separate gene product, Smad4, in
Xenopus (Watanabe et al. 2000) lack the NES and are
constitutively located in the nucleus.
Smad subcellular retention mechanisms
Despite the intrinsic ability of RSmads to shuttle in and
out the nucleus, many immunocytochemical studies
have shown that in the basal steady state, RSmads are
predominantly concentrated in the cytoplasm (Pierreux
et al. 2000; Watanabe et al. 2000; Xu et al. 2002). This is
thought to result from the action of cytoplasmic Smadbinding factors. Indeed, endogenous Smad proteins in the
basal state are found in high-molecular mass oligomeric
complexes, as determined by molecular-sizing chromatography (Jayaraman and Massagué 2000).
Different cytosolic proteins may function as Smad anchors and adaptors. The best characterized of the cytosolic retention factors for Smad2 and Smad 3 is the protein SARA (smad anchor for receptor activation) (Tsukazaki et al. 1998). SARA is a multidomain protein that
contains an 80-amino-acid Smad-binding domain (SBD)
and a FYVE phosholipid-binding domain that avidly
binds to phosphatidyl inositol 3 phosphate on endosomal membranes. FYVE targets SARA preferentially to
early endosomes (Di Guglielmo et al. 2003). As revealed
by the X-ray crystal structure of the Smad2–SBD complex, the SBD of SARA makes contact with the three
consecutive hydrophobic patches on the MH2 domain
surface that constitute the hydrophobic corridor (Figs. 2,
3; Wu et al. 2000). This region is also involved in the
interaction with the FG-repeat-containing domain nucleoporins and the binding of DNA-binding cofactors
(Wu et al. 2000; Randall et al. 2002). Therefore, the interaction with SARA is incompatible with translocation
of Smad2/3 into the nucleus and formation of transcriptional complexes.
Receptor-mediated phosphorylation causes a decrease
in the affinity of Smad2 for SARA (Wu et al. 2001b). This
occurs without a concomitant increase in Smad affinity
for nucleoporins. In vivo, however, this drop in affinity
for SARA is sufficient for Smad2/3 dissociation and
movement into the nucleus, where Smad2/3 are retained
by interactions with Smad4 and additional proteins, as
Figure 3. Smad interaction sites. Summary of representative
interactions of RSmads and Smad4 with other proteins in the
cytoplasm, nuclear pore, and nucleus. On a type I receptor kinase domain, the L45 loop specifies the receptor–RSmad interaction, the phosphorylated GS domain enables this interaction,
and the catalytic domain phosphorylates the RSmad tail. On
RSmad, the L3 loop (not shown) and the basic pocket (blue oval)
match the receptor L45 loop and the GS domain. In the basal
state, the MH1 and MH2 domains may interact in cis, and the
MH2 domains of Smad4 in trans (dashed arrow), forming homotrimers. The phosphorylated tail of RSmads (red dot) is recognized by the basic pocket in Smad4. SARA, acting as a cytoplasmic anchor, and the nucleoporins Nup214 and Nup153, acting as mediators of nuclear import and export, interact with the
hydrophobic corridor of RSmads. Smad4 import involved direct
contacts with these nucleoporins, whereas export involves
binding of CRM1 to the NES motif (orange mark) on the linker
region of Smad4. In the cytoplasm or the nucleus, the linker
region of RSmads is recognized by MAPKs, CDKs, and other
kinases for phosphorylation and by Smurf ubiquitin ligases for
polyubiquinitation. In the nucleus, different DNA-binding cofactors bind to RSmads in the hydrophobic corridor and others
bind to the MH1 domain. Transcriptional coactivators such as
p300 bind to the MH2 domain, in some cases with the assistance of adaptors such as MSG1. Corepressors may bind in competition with p300 (case of TGIF) or in competition with Smad4
(case of SnoN).

well as with the DNA. Dephosphorylation and dissociation of Smad transcriptional complexes are thought to
end this retention, allowing the export of RSmad out of
the nucleus (Inman et al. 2002).
The hydrophobic corridor and adjacent regions are involved in binding contacts not only with SARA and nucleoporins, but also with DNA-binding partners in the
nucleus (Fig. 3; Randall et al. 2002). Two such partners of
Smad2/3, the forkhead family member FoxH1 and the
homeodomain transcription factor Mixer, share a conserved Smad-interacting motif (SIM) that has sequence
similarity with the SBD of SARA (Germain et al. 2000;
Wu et al. 2000). Interestingly, the SIM is shorter than the
SBD and, contrary to the SBD, it binds to Smad without
occluding the Smad–Smad interface (Wu et al. 2001b).
Thus SIM-containing factors can bind to Smad2/3–
Smad4 oligomers, whereas SARA SBD interacts with
monomeric Smad2/3.
As the same Smad protein surface interacts with cytoplasmic retention factors, nuclear pore components,
and nuclear-interacting factors, this surface creates mutually exclusive interactions—and hence, competition—
between Smad-binding components (Fig. 3). A soluble
SBD peptide has been used as an effective inhibitor of
Smad2/3 nuclear translocation (Xu et al. 2000, 2003).
Nup214 and Nup153 compete with SARA for Smad2 in
binding assays (Xu et al. 2002). Overexpression of FoxH1
causes the concentration of Smad2/3 in the nucleus even
in the absence of TGF, providing evidence for the constant nucleocytoplasmic traffic of Smads (Xu et al. 2002).
This FoxH1–Smad2/3 interaction is transcriptionally inert because, without receptor mediated phosphorylation,
Smad2/3 in this complex cannot recruit Smad4.
Smad adaptors for receptor interaction
Several adaptor proteins that facilitate the Smad–receptor interaction have been described, of which SARA is
the most extensively characterized. By regionally restricting Smad2/3 proteins to the plasma membrane and
early endosomes, SARA facilitates the interaction of
Smads 2 and 3 with the activated TGF receptor (Tsukazaki et al. 1998). The activated receptor complex is internalized via clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane to the early endosomes, where SARA-bound
Smads are thought to be most readily accessible (Di
Guglielmo et al. 2003). However, this interaction also
appears to occur at the plasma membrane prior to receptor internalization (Di Guglielmo et al. 2003). Another
FYVE domain protein, Hgs, has been found to cooperate
with SARA on Smad phosphorylation (Miura et al. 2000).
Activated TGF receptor complexes are also internalized
via lipid rafts and caveolae, but this route is thought to
lead to receptor interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase
Smurf2 that targets the receptor for inactivation (Di
Guglielmo et al. 2003). However, genetic evidence for
the necessity for SARA in Smad2/3 signaling is lacking,
and so it remains to be established whether SARA is in
fact a major player in this pathway.
Other proteins that have been proposed to participate
in the interaction of Smad2/3 with the TGF receptor,
including Disabled-2 (Hocevar et al. 2001), Dok-1 (Yamakawa et al. 2002), Axin (Furuhashi et al. 2001), the
ELF -spectrin (Tang et al. 2003), and a cytoplasmic isoform (cPML) of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (Lin
et al. 2004), are interesting members of this group. cPML
has been proposed to interact with SARA, Smad2/3, and
the TGF receptor and to be critical for TGF phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and TGF signaling (Lin et al.
2004). However, PML-deficient mice develop fairly normally (Wang et al. 1998), whereas embryos deficient in
TGF receptors or Smad2 do not (Oshima et al. 1996;
Waldrip et al. 1998; Heyer et al. 1999). The proteins
TRAP-1 (TGF-receptor-associated protein) (Wurthner
et al. 2001) and TLP (TRAP-1-like protein) (Felici et al.
2003) have been described as adaptor proteins that interact with the receptor complex and facilitate the formation of Smad2/3–Smad4 complexes. Many of these interactions require a more thorough examination before
their significance as Smad adaptors can be established.
Furthermore, little is known about factors that facilitate
RSmad–receptor interactions in the BMP pathway.
Smad1 does not interact with SARA, but given the overall similarity between these pathways, the existence of a
SARA-like factor for Smads 1, 5, and 8 remains possible.
Smad phosphorylation by TGF receptor kinases
Smad phosphorylation by the activated TGF receptor
complex is a pivotal event in the initiation of TGF signal transduction. The mechanism of TGF receptor activation was established by combining biochemical and
genetic approaches (Wrana et al. 1994). This process and
its structural basis have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Shi and Massagué 2003). Briefly, TGF binds to
pairs of receptor serine/threonine kinases, known as the
TGF type I (TR-I) and type II (TR-II) receptors, forming a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex. In this complex, TR-II phosphorylates a serine/threonine-rich region, called the GS region, that is located N-terminal to
the canonical kinase domain of TR-I (Fig. 1). In the
absence of ligand, the small proteins FKBP12 and
FKBP12.6 bind to the GS region and occlude the phosphorylation sites in this region (Y.G. Chen et al. 1997;
Datta et al. 1998). The X-ray crystal structure of the
FKBP12–TR-I cytoplasmic domain complex revealed
that the bound FKBP12 additionally enforces a catalytically inactive conformation of the TR-I kinase domain
by pressing against the active center and causing a misalignment of the critical catalytic amino acid residues
(Huse et al. 1999). Thus, in the basal state, the GS region
acts as a docking site for FKBP12 and an auto-inhibitory
element of the receptor kinase (Fig. 1).
TR-II appears to be a constitutively active kinase
(Wrana et al. 1994). Ligand access to the receptors is a
tightly regulated process, with numerous proteins acting
as ligand traps that bind various members of the TGF
family and prevent their contact with cell surface receptors (Fig. 1; for reviews, see Massagué and Chen 2000; Shi
and Massagué 2003). In the ligand-induced receptor comSmad signaling

plex, TR-II gains access to the GS region of TR-I, catalyzing the phosphorylation of alternating serine (or
threonine) residues in the sequence Thr–Thr–Ser–Gly–
Ser–Gly–Ser (Wrana et al. 1994; Massagué 1998). This
interaction is negatively regulated by the pseudoreceptor
BAMBI, which intercalates in the receptor complex (Onichtchouk et al. 1999). Phosphorylation of TR-I turns
the GS region from a FKBP12-binding site to a binding
site for Smad2/3 (Huse et al. 2001), providing a case of
remarkable economy of function within a kinase structural element. Smad2/3 are then phosphorylated by
TR-I and released to propagate the signal.
This general mechanism applies to all TGF and BMP
family receptors characterized to date, from human
through Drosophila (Shi and Massagué 2003). The
RSmad substrate specificity of a given receptor complex
is determined by a particular region, the L45 loop, in the
kinase domain of the type I receptor and a complementary region, the L3 loop, on the MH2 domain of RSmads
(Fig. 3). TR-I (also known as ALK5) and the nodal/activin type I receptors ALK2 and ALK7 recognize Smads 2
and 3, whereas ALK1, ALK3, and ALK6 recognize Smads
1, 5, and 8. Thus, the phosphorylated GS region drives
receptor interaction with RSmads, whereas the L45 loop
determines the specificity of this interaction.
Receptor-mediated phosphorylation occurs at two serine residues in the extreme C-terminal sequence Ser–
Val–Ser (Ser–Met–Ser in Smad2) of RSmads. pSer–X–pSer
is the paradigmatic activation motif of the TGF-/Smad
pathway (Fig. 1). This motif occurs both in the GS region
of type I receptors upon phosphorylation by type II receptors and in the C-terminal tail of RSmads upon phosphorylation by type I receptors. Together with the Cterminal carboxyl group, this di-phosphoserine moiety
constitutes an acidic tail that binds to a basic pocket in
the Smad4 MH2 domain (Fig. 1; Wu et al. 2001b; Chacko
et al. 2004). As a result, RSmad–Smad4 oligomers are
formed that nucleate a large number of transcriptional
regulatory complexes.
In solution, the unphosphorylated Smad2 MH2 domain is a monomer but the phosphorylated form is a
homotrimer (Wu et al. 2001b), and Smad4 also forms
homotrimers (Shi et al. 1997). Smad2/3 mixed oligomers
(presumably trimers) have been observed in cells on
TGF- stimulation (Wu et al. 2001b; Chacko et al. 2004),
but their function is unknown. More significant from
the standpoint of signal transduction are the RSmad–
Smad4 oligomers, both heterodimers (RSmad–Smad4) or
heterotrimers (two RSmads molecules plus one Smad4
molecule) (Figs. 1, 2B). As revealed by X-ray crystallographic studies, these oligomers are stabilized by interactions within an extensive protein–protein interface between MH2 domains plus the binding of the pSer–X–pSer
motif of one MH2 domain into the di-phosphoserinebinding pocket on the adjacent MH2 domain (Wu et al.
2001b). Mutation of these serine residues into aspartic
acid mimics this interaction. Several Smad-inactivating
mutations found in tumors map to the MH2 domain
interface and inhibit Smad oligomer formation (Wu et al.
2001b).
Smad dephosphorylation
A steady level of Smad2/3 phosphorylation is achieved in
cells within 15–30 min of exposure to of TGF addition
and can last for several hours. Eventually, a drop in
TGF levels in the extracellular space, receptor inactivation by internalization and degradation, or the action
of negative feedback mechanisms leads to a loss of Smad
phosphorylation.
Recent evidence suggests that sustained receptor activity is required for the maintenance of the steady-state
phospho-Smad levels over the duration of the TGF
stimulation. The existence of a rapid cycle of dephosphorylation and return to the cytoplasm has been inferred from results using a TGF receptor kinase inhibitor (Inman et al. 2002). Interrupting signaling by addition
of this inhibitor causes a precipitous loss of phosphoSmad2, with a half-life of <30 min (Inman et al. 2002).
This loss is primarily caused by dephosphorylation (Fig.
1; Inman et al. 2002), although ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of Smad2 in the nucleus
may also eventually occur (Lo and Massagué 1999).
RSmad dephosphorylation seems to occur in the
nucleus, as suggested by the underphosphorylated state
of Smad2 protein exported from the nuclei of permeabilized TGF-treated cells (Xu et al. 2002). Dephosphorylation is accompanied with dissociation of the RSmad–
Smad4 complex and export of its components to the cytoplasm. Thus, RSmads undergo repeated cycles of
receptor-mediated phosphorylation and re-entry into the
nucleus, as long as TGF receptors remain active (Fig. 1).
Smad signaling activity becomes thereby tied to receptor
activation. The identity of the RSmad phosphatase(s) has
not been revealed, but their identification will be of great
interest because the action of this enzyme(s) causes the
termination of Smad signal transduction.
Smad transcriptional complexes
The RSmad–Smad4 complex formed upon receptor-mediated phosphorylation of RSmad acts as the core of
many different multiprotein assemblies that target different genes for either activation or repression. The Smad
proteins in this complex, via their MH1 domain, can
bind to DNA. Almost universally, however, Smads must
interact with other DNA-binding cofactors to achieve
high affinity and selectivity for specific subsets of target
genes. Understanding how the MH1 domain recognizes
DNA and how a RSmad–Smad4 complex engages different DNA-binding partners is essential for delineating
Smad transcriptional programs.
DNA-binding determinants in the MH1 domain:
-hairpin and exon 3 insert
Smad4 and all RSmads (except the long form of Smad2,
see below) can directly bind to DNA. The X-ray crystal
structure of the Smad3 MH1 domain bound to the SBE
shows that a -hairpin (i.e., two anti-parallel short
-strands separated by a linker loop) in the MH1 domain
Massagué et al.
2788 GENES & DEVELOPMENT
Downloaded from on October 6, 2025 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press

mediates this binding interaction. The -hairpin is inserted in the major groove of the DNA and establishes
hydrogen bonds with nucleotides in three base pairs of
the Smad-binding element (Shi et al. 1998). The -hairpin sequence is conserved in all RSmads and Smad4 (Shi
et al. 1998), arguing that this Smad–DNA contact cannot
provide much selectivity in the interaction of different
Smads with their corresponding target genes.
Interestingly, the most abundant splice variant of
Smad2 in vertebrates contains an insert in the MH1 domain, in the vicinity of the -hairpin, that prevents
Smad2 binding to DNA (Shi et al. 1998). This insert is
codified by exon 3 of Smad2. The predicted sequence of
the Smad2 ortholog in Drosophila, dSmad2, also contains an insert in this position (Brummel et al. 1999). A
splice variant of Smad2 lacking the exon 3 insert is able
to bind DNA (Yagi et al. 1999). Because the splice form
containing the insert is the most abundant and was
cloned first, this variant is called Smad2, whereas the
version lacking the insert, and thus most closely resembling the other RSmads, is stuck with the name
Smad2E3.
The endogenous Smad2 and Smad2E3 proteins are
coexpressed in various cell types at a ratio ranging from
3:1 to 10:1 (Dunn et al. 2005). Smad2-null mice show an
early embryonic lethal phenotype because Smad2 plays
an essential role in patterning the embryonic axis and
specifying the endoderm (Waldrip et al. 1998; Heyer et al.
1999). Mice engineered to exclusively express Smad2E3
from the Smad2 locus are viable and fertile, indicating
that full-length Smad2 with the insert is not required for
viability (Dunn et al. 2005).
The role of the insert and its inhibitory effect on DNA
binding remain a mystery. Smad2 might act as a competitive inhibitor of Smad2E3 and Smad3 in transcriptional complexes. However, this scenario has not been
borne out by the evidence. Smad2 was originally identified for its ability to act as a mediator and not an inhibitor of activin/TGF-like transcriptional responses.
Smad2 can associate with Smad4 and an additional
DNA-binding cofactor to form transcriptional complexes. This was shown by the ability of the complex
FoxH1–Smad2–Smad4 to mediate activation of the Mix2
promoter (X. Chen et al. 1997; Liu et al. 1997). Still, it is
possible that Smad2 may act as an effector of some gene
responses and as an inhibitor of others. Furthermore, the
exon 3-encoded insert may have functions not related to
transcriptional regulation. Of interest in this regard,
Smad2E3, like Smad3, forms high-molecular mass
oligomeric complexes in the basal state, whereas Smad2
is essentially monomeric under these conditions (Jayaraman and Massagué 2000).
Smad-binding elements
Using a bound-oligonucleotide selection strategy, the
binding specificity of recombinant Smad proteins was
originally defined as 5-GTCTAGAC-3 (Zawel et al.
1998) and later shown to be 5-GTCT-3, or its complement 5-AGAC-3, called the Smad-binding element
(SBE). Many Smad-responsive promoter regions contain
one or more SBEs, which in many instances contain an
extra base, as 5-CAGAC-3. The crystal structure of the
MH1–SBE complex shows that Smads recognize the 5-
GTCT-3 sequence through the -hairpin in the MH1
domain (Shi et al. 1998).
The affinity of Smad proteins for the SBE is too low to
support binding of a Smad complex to a single SBE in
vivo (Shi et al. 1998). Sufficient binding affinity for transcriptional activation can be artificially achieved with
concatemers of multiple SBEs (Zawel et al. 1998). As
activated Smad complexes consist of Smad oligomers,
the presence of multiple SBEs likely enables tight binding through cooperative interactions between multiple
MH1 domain–SBE contacts by the same Smad complex.
However, natural Smad target promoters seldom contain
SBE concatemers, and those that contain up to four SBEs
still require cooperating factors for effective DNA binding (Seoane et al. 2004).
High-affinity binding of the Smad complex is thought
to occur through the incorporation of a different DNAbinding cofactor into the RSmad–Smad4 complex (Fig.
1). This allows the recognition of promoter regions that
present one SBE in the vicinity of the cognate sequence
for that particular cofactor. This mode of interaction provides a basis for high affinity and selectivity in the recognition of target genes and a venue for the differential
action of TGF in different cell types (Massagué and
Wotton 2000). As discussed below, the interaction of
Smads with other transcription factors to generate target
gene-specific transcriptional complexes is crucial for the
pleiotropic nature of TGF signaling. However, no crystal structure of a natural Smad complex bound to its
cognate DNA region has been described to date, leaving
us to wonder how such interactions may actually take
place.
SBE variants and GC-rich elements
Some TGF responsive regions lack a canonical SBE but
contain sequences that may function as such because of
a certain degree of tolerance in the MH1–SBE interaction. Based on the crystal structure of this complex, the
second nucleotide in the 5-GTCT-3 sequence does not
support interactions with the MH1 domain, thus allowing substitutions that do not impair Smad binding (Shi et
al. 1998). Such “degenerate” SBEs have been proposed in
the TGF inhibitory element (TIE) in the c-Myc promoter (Chen et al. 2002). The TIE does not contain a
canonical SBE but binds a Smad3–Smad4 complex, as
verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
(Chen et al. 2002). Scrutiny of this region in vitro and in
cells has demonstrated that the sequence 5-GGCTT-3
is contacted by Smad3 or Smad4 (Chen et al. 2002; Frederick et al. 2004). Either way, the Smad–DNA interaction in the c-Myc TIE is buttressed by E2F4/5 and DP1 as
DNA-binding cofactors in the c-Myc inhibitory complex
(Chen et al. 2002; Frederick et al. 2004).
In certain promoters, Smad complexes recognize GCrich regions. Mad (Drosophila Smad1) and Medea (DroSmad signaling

sophila Smad4) were shown to interact with a GCCGnCGC sequence in the promoters of Vestigial (Kim et
al. 1997) and Tinman (Xu et al. 1998). Interestingly, the
murine counterpart of Tinman, Nkx2.5, contains a canonical SBE that interacts with the Smad complex (Lien
et al. 2002; Brown et al. 2004). The BMP-responsive element (BRE) in the promoter of Smad6 contains four overlapping copies of a GC-rich motif. Direct binding of
Smads to GC-rich sequences has been demonstrated in
oligonucleotide binding assays using extracts from cells
that overexpress Smad5 and Smad4 (Ishida et al. 2000).
Based on these observations, GC-rich motifs are sometimes referred to as “Smad1-binding elements”. However, it would be erroneous to imply that Smad1/5/8
bind GC-rich motifs, whereas Smad2/3 bind to SBEs.
The first Smad1-binding element defined in vertebrates,
in the BMP-responsive region of the Xenopus Vent-2 promoter, is a canonical SBE (Hata et al. 2000). Furthermore,
binding of Smad1–Smad4 complexes and Smad3–Smad4
complexes to the Id1 promoter requires both SBE and
GC-rich elements. Both elements are required for BMPmediated induction of Id1 (Korchynskyi and ten Dijke
2002; Lopez-Rovira et al. 2002; Kang et al. 2003) and
TGF-mediated repression of Id1, the difference being
determined by the recruitment of an additional factor,
ATF3 (Kang et al. 2003). No crystal structure of a Smad
molecule bound to a GC region has been reported, but
the dual interaction with SBE and GC-rich motifs invites
the speculation that the MH1 domain might actually
contain separate DNA-binding sites for these two different sequences.
Core Smad complexes: dimers and trimers
Transcriptionally active Smad complexes are mediated
by RSmad–Smad4 oligomers. The stoichiometry of such
oligomers has been the subject of debate. The analysis of
complexes formed with Smads containing acidic residue
substitutions for the C-terminal serine residues suggested that they form heterotrimers of two phosphoRSmad molecules and one Smad4 molecule (Chacko et
al. 2001; Qin et al. 2001). Moreover, phospho-Smad2 and
Smad4 each in isolation form homotrimers in solution
(Shi et al. 1997; Wu et al. 2001b). These results indicated
that functional RSmad–Smad4 complexes are probably
heterotrimers (Chacko et al. 2001). However, the crystal
structure of isolated MH2 domains of phospho-Smad2
supported as well a heterodimer model between Smad4
and the RSmad (Wu et al. 2001a,b). Recently, the X-ray
crystal structure analysis of the complexes formed by the
MH2 domains of phospho-Smad2–Smad4 and phosphoSmad3–Smad4, digested with chymotrypsin, shows that
both complexes are heterotrimers comprising two phosphorylated RSmad subunits and one Smad4 (Chacko et
al. 2004).
Studies on endogenous Smad transcriptional complexes in vivo have suggested a more complex scenario.
Both heterodimers and heterotrimers may be formed depending on the target gene and other factors present in
the complex (Inman and Hill 2002). For example, the
Mix2 promoter may be targeted by a heterotrimer
Smad2–Smad2–Smad4 bound to FoxH1, whereas a
Smad3–Smad4 heterodimer and an as yet unknown cofactor may be involved in targeting the JunB promoter
(Inman and Hill 2002). The physical interaction of the
Smad cofactors with the RSmad–Smad4 complexes
might facilitate the formation of a heterodimer or a heterotrimer.
The regulation of c-Myc, Id1, p21Cip1, and other genes
by TGF involves Smad3 preferentially over Smad2.
Smad3 has a higher affinity than Smad2 for the cofactors—E2F4/5, ATF3, and FoxO, respectively—that target
Smads to these gene promoters (Chen et al. 2002; Kang et
al. 2003; Seoane et al. 2004). The role of Smad2E3 in
these complexes has not been characterized. Therefore,
the choice between Smad heterodimers and heterotrimers might depend on several variables, including the balance between Smad2 and Smad2E3, the other DNAbinding partners present in the complex, and the number
of SBEs present in the target promoter.
Smad4 requirement
Whether Smad4 is always required in Smad transcriptional complexes remains an important yet elusive question. All endogenous Smad complexes described to date
have been shown to contain Smad4. All Smad target
genes characterized by chromatin immunoprecipitation
showed Smad4 binding along with RSmads. Nevertheless, Smad4-deficient tumor cells and fibroblasts from
Smad4-deficient mice still display some gene responses
to TGF (Sirard et al. 1998; Wisotzkey et al. 1998; Subramanian et al. 2004). Certain pancreatic carcinoma cells
that lack Smad4 contain high levels of phosphorylated
RSmads and respond to TGF receptor signaling with
increased motility (Subramanian et al. 2004). TGF receptors could signal some of these responses via MAP
kinases, phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, PP2A protein
phosphatases, or Rho family members (for review, see
Derynck and Zhang 2003; Siegel and Massagué 2003), or
as a result of effects on tight junction membrane components (Ozdamar et al. 2005). However, TGF signaling via RSmads independently of Smad4 remains a possibility, as suggested by the more severe phenotype of
mad mutants compared with medea mutants in Drosophila (Wisotzkey et al. 1998) and Smad2−/− mice compared with Smad4−/− mice (Sirard et al. 1998; Chu et al.
2004). Phospho-RSmads might yet be shown to interact
with factors distinct from, and in competition with,
Smad4.
Target gene selection by association with
DNA-binding partners
Activated RSmad–Smad4 complexes achieve high affinity and selectivity for target gene promoters by associating with diverse DNA-binding factors (Fig. 4A,B). The
DNA-binding activities of the various components in
the resulting complex cooperatively generate a high-afMassagué et al.

finity binding interaction with target promoters that
contain the cognate sequences. This interaction demands that the suitable DNA elements be present at the
correct distance and orientation on the target promoter,
so the interaction is highly selective. Among several
hundred TGF target genes in a given cell, only a few
may be targeted by a particular RSmad–Smad4–partner
combination. A given cell type that does not express a
particular Smad partner will be unable to mount the
TGF gene response(s) that depend on that particular
RSmad complex combination. This would make a gene
response to TGF cell type dependent. Some DNA-binding partners can pair with Smad2/3 only and others with
Smad1/5/8 only, thus establishing pathway specificity
for TGF and BMP gene responses. Furthermore, in some
cases Smad partners also determine the sign of the effect—
activation or repression—that is exerted on a target gene.
Smad partners therefore provide four levels of specificity:
(1) target gene specificity, (2) pathway specificity, (3) cell
type specificity, and (4) specific transcriptional effect.
Many Smad cofactors have been identified that fulfil
this paradigm for different Smad target genes. Remarkably, these cofactors belong to different families of DNAbinding proteins, providing a basis for the breadth of
TGF transcriptional responses. It should be noted that
only a few of these interactions have been validated to
date by analysis of endogenous (as opposed to overexpressed) proteins, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of protein binding to DNA in vivo, and genetic depletion of Smad partners. Whenever possible, we will focus
here on examples that meet these stringent criteria.
The first identified Smad-interacting transcription factor was the forkhead family member, FoxH1 (previously
FAST1) (Chen et al. 1996). The FoxH1–Smad2–Smad4
complex binds an activin-responsive element on the promoter region of Mix2 in response to activin/nodal-like
signals during mesoderm specification in Xenopus.
FoxH1 is essential for the binding of this complex to the
Mix2 promoter (X. Chen et al. 1997; Liu et al. 1997).
FoxH1 specifically interacts with the MH2 domain of
Smads 2 and 3. This interaction is mediated by two separate sequences on FoxH1: a proline-rich sequence called
the SIM and a FoxH1-specific motif (Germain et al.
2000). Three other forkhead family members, FoxO1,
FoxO3, and FoxO4, serve as Smad3 transcriptional partners in the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 or CDKN1A (Seoane et al. 2004). In this
case, however, the interaction is mediated by the DNAbinding domain (“forkhead” or “Fox-box” domain) of the
FoxO proteins and the MH1 domain of Smad3.
A region structurally and functionally similar to the
FoxH1 SIM is also present in Mixer and Milk. However,
these proteins are members of the Mix family of homeodomain transcription factors. Mixer and Milk serve
as Smad partners in the regulation of Xenopus goosecoid
(Germain et al. 2000). Interestingly, it has been suggested
that the contact with the goosecoid promoter is established by Mixer or Milk with Smads tethered to these
proteins without directly contacting the DNA (Germain
et al. 2000).
Activation of Vent2 during ventral mesoderm differentiation in Xenopus is mediated by an OAZ–Smad1–
Smad4 complex in response to BMP (Hata et al. 2000).
OAZ belongs to yet another family of DNA-binding proteins, the zinc-finger protein family. OAZ contains 30
zinc-finger motifs, some of which mediate binding to
Smad1 and others mediate binding to a Vent2 promoter
sequence (Hata et al. 2000). Another BMP target gene
Figure 4. Models of transcriptional regulation by Smads. (A)
RSmad–Smad4 complexes, in combination with different DNAbinding cofactors, form assemblies that target specific genes.
FoxH, FoxO, and Mixer are examples of DNA-binding cofactors
for Smad2/3–Smad4, and OAZ for Smad1/5–Smad4. These
complexes may recruit coactivators (e.g., p300, CBP, P/CAF)
with the assistance of adaptor proteins (e.g., MSG1, SMIF). (B)
RSmad–Smad4 complexes may also recruit corepressors as a
function of the associated DNA-binding cofactor. Smad1–
Smad4 with Nkx3.2 recruits mSin3/HDAC1. Smad3–Smad4
with E2F4/5 recruits p107 and with Runx2 recruits HDAC4.
The color coding indicates functionally linked components. (C)
In a growing number of cases, Smad-mediated transcriptional
regulation appears to involve a self-enabling mechanism
whereby Smads induces a gene response that then enables another Smad-dependent gene response. (1) In the Xenopus embryo, Mixer with Smad2–Smad4 induces expression of Mix2,
which then mediates the induction of other genes with Smad2–
Smad4. Likewise, OAZ with Smad1–Smad4 induces expression
of Vent2, which then apparently mediates the induction of
other genes with Smad1–Smad4. (2) In human keratinocytes,
Smad2/3–Smad4 with unknown cofactors induces expression of
ATF3, which in complex with Smad3–Smad4 then mediates the
repression of ID1. (3) By down-regulating the expression of cMYC in epithelial cells, an E2F4/5–Smad3–Smad4 complex removes Myc-mediated repression from p21CIP1, thus enabling the activation of this gene by FoxO–Smad3–Smad4 complexes. (4) In the Drosophila embryo, repression of Brinker by a
Schnurri–Mad–Medea complex facilitates the displacement of
Brinker from the Ubx promoter by a competing Mad–Medea
(with an unknown cofactor) complex.
Smad signaling

activated by the Smad–OAZ complex is Xretpos, a novel
family of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons in
Xenopus, whose transcript is restricted to ventro–posterior-specific regions (Shim et al. 2002). However, the activation of the homeobox gene, Tlx2, by BMP in the
mouse embryo during gastrulation and in the embryonic
carcinoma p19 cell line (Macias-Silva et al. 1998; Tang et
al. 1998) is not mediated by Smad–OAZ (Hata et al.
2000). In this case, the TRAF6-interacting protein Ecsit,
which is also implicated in the Toll signaling pathway,
helps the Smad1–Smad4 complex recognize Tlx2 for activation (Xiao et al. 2003). This provides yet another example of the level of selectivity that has evolved to ensure proper control of target gene selection in Smad transcriptional programs.
The list of DNA-binding partners is rapidly growing.
The RUNX family of DNA-binding factors contributes
three members to this list: Runx1 (also known as AML1/
CBFA2/PEBP2B, Runx2 (AML3/CBFA1/PEBP2A), and
Runx3 (AML2/CBFA3/PEBP2C) (Hanai et al. 1999; E.
Pardali et al. 2000; Zhang and Derynck 2000; Alliston et
al. 2001). TGF-activated Runx–Smad2/3–Smad4 complexes target the IgC promoter in B cells (Hanai et al.
1999; E. Pardali et al. 2000; Zhang and Derynck 2000)
and the osteocalcin promoter in osteoblasts (Alliston et
al. 2001). AP1 transcription factors interact with Smads
in the regulation of c-jun (Zhang et al. 1998), collagenase-I/MMP1 (Wong et al. 1999), and interleukin-11 (Y.
Kang et al. 2005). While AP1 and Smad complexes have
been shown to bind to adjacent sites on the collagenaseI/MMP1 and interleukin-11 promoters, they can act on
the c-jun promoter by a long-range synergy from distant
promoter sites (Wong et al. 1999). Thus, in the c-jun
response, AP1 and Smads may not establish the kind of
physical partnership that is characteristic of other Smad–
partner interactions. The E2F family members E2F4 and
E2F5 act as partners of Smad3–Smad4 in repression of
c-Myc by TGF in epithelial cells (Chen et al. 2002) and
the ATF/CREB family member ATF3 in the repression of
Id1 (Kang et al. 2003).
p53 has been proposed to interact with Smads and to
be required for many Smad gene responses, although no
direct physical interaction has been demonstrated (Cordenonsi et al. 2003). Among general transcription factors, Sp1 has been implicated in the induction of
p15Ink4b (Feng et al. 2000) and p21Cip1 (K. Pardali et al.
2000), but no evidence has been provided yet that TGF
controls the interaction of endogenous Sp1 with the
p15Ink4b and p21Cip1 promoters in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays or that conditional depletion of
Sp1 specifically interferes with the induction of these
genes by TGF.
It remains possible that genes containing enough clustered copies of the SBE in the promoter region might be
activated by Smad-only complexes. One candidate in
this class is Smad7, whose promoter contains two palindromic SBEs (Denissova et al. 2000). Smad7 is activated by both TGF and BMP pathways in many cell
types for negative feedback. So, it would make sense if
its induction could be achieved by activated Smads regardless of the activating input. Nevertheless, definitive
proof for this notion is still lacking. Indeed, several reports show that full activation of the Smad7 promoter
requires cooperation of the Smad complex with AP1,
Sp1, or TFE3 transcription factors (Brodin et al. 2000;
Hua et al. 2000). Of note, the p21Cip1 promoter contains
up to four consecutive SBEs in the TGF responsive region, but still requires the participation of FoxO as a
Smad partner (Seoane et al. 2004).
Roles of Smads in transcriptional activation
and repression
Smad transcriptional complexes target specific genes for
either induction or inhibition through the direct recruitment of transcriptional coactivators or corepressors to
target promoters. However, other modalities of gene
regulation appear to include Smad interference with activators or repressors, and Smad cooperation with DNAbinding partners that are themselves targets of Smaddependent expression. Groups of gene responses generated by these mechanisms constitute transcriptional
programs for the regulation of specific cellular functions,
as has been systematically explored in the TGF cytostatic response of epithelial cells (Siegel and Massagué
2003). Other properties of this system enable the generation of graded gene responses to TGF family morphogens and the synchronous expression—or “synexpression”—of functionally diverse genes by a common Smad
complex.
Smad-dependent transcriptional activation
The ability of the MH2 domains of Smad1 and Smad4 to
display transcriptional activation potential when tethered to DNA via a heterologous Gal4 DNA-binding domain (GBD) was recognized early on (Liu et al. 1996). A
GBD fusion to the full Smad1 protein had little activity
on its own, but showed strong BMP inducible transcriptional activity. This was presumably due to effects of
BMP signaling on endogenous Smads, which entered the
nucleus where they could interact with the tethered
Smad1 fusion. This idea was backed up by the finding
that the activity of GBD–Smad1 fusions could be induced by coexpression of Smad4 (Liu et al. 1996, 1997).
Domain mapping studies (Zhang et al. 1996; Hata et al.
1997), and later structural data (Shi et al. 1997; Chacko et
al. 2004), demonstrated that the MH2 domains in response to TGF or BMP stimulation form a complex
with transcriptional activation potential.
Much of the initial interest in Smad coactivators
was focused on the general coactivators p300 and CBP
(Massagué and Wotton 2000). In part this came from experiments using the adenovirus E1a protein, which on
overexpression was known to titrate these factors.
E1a expression inhibited Smad responses, whereas a mutant that lacked the p300/CBP-binding domain had no
effect (Feng et al. 1998; Pouponnot et al. 1998; Shen et
Massagué et al.

al. 1998; Topper et al. 1998). p300 and CBP interact with
Smads 1, 2, 3, and 4, and these interactions mapped to
the MH2 domains. These findings, together with the
demonstration that Smads had sequence-specific DNAbinding activity, firmly identified the Smad proteins as
classical transcription factors, with a modular structure,
including the MH1 DNA-binding domain and the MH2
oligomerization and transcriptional activation domain
(Figs. 3, 4A).
The fact that p300/CBP coactivator complexes contain
multiple activities that are capable of acetylating histone
N-terminal tails (Bannister and Kouzarides 1996; Ogryzko et al. 1996) suggested that Smads function in part by
remodeling the chromatin template, an idea that has
been further supported by the identification of histone
deacetylases (HDACs) as alternate components of Smad
complexes (see below). The recruited acetylase activity
might also act on other chromatin-associated proteins,
including the Smads themselves. However, although
many transcription factors are acetylated, there is currently no evidence for direct acetylation of either Smad4
or the RSmads.
Interaction of the Smad proteins with such general coactivators also provided for the possibility of integration
of different signals at the level of the coactivators, a form
of nuclear cross-talk between signal transduction pathways. Indeed, the ability of BMP2 and LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) to synergistically induce astrocyte differentiation was shown to result from the simultaneous
binding of their signal transducers, Smad1 and STAT3,
respectively, to separate sites in p300 to cooperatively
activate the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (Nakashima et al. 1999). This may provide a model, not only
for how two signals can be integrated in the nucleus, but
also for how more specificity of transcriptional activation can be generated.
Smads reportedly interact with other general transcriptional regulatory proteins. The P/CAF chromatin
assembly factor, which associates with p300/CBP complexes, was shown to interact with the MH2 domain of
TGF-activated RSmads, and some potentiation of a
TGF transcriptional response was seen with increased
P/CAF expression (Itoh et al. 2000). The ARC105 component of the Mediator complex interacts with Smads 2,
3, and 4, again via the MH2 domain (Kato et al. 2002).
This interaction was shown, by siRNA knock-down, to
be required for full activation of TGF (but not BMP)
transcriptional responses in Xenopus.
In addition to these general transcriptional coactivators, more specific Smad coactivators have been identified, many from yeast two-hybrid interaction screening.
Deletion analysis of Smad4 revealed the presence of a
transcriptional activation domain, named the SAD, at
the C-terminal end of the linker region extending into
the MH2 domain (de Caestecker et al. 2000). Subsequent
analysis suggested that the protein MSG1 promotes interaction of p300 with Smad4, primarily via the SAD
(Figs. 3, 4A; Shioda et al. 1998; Yahata et al. 2000). Thus,
MSG1 may represent a type of specificity factor, which is
not absolutely required, but can promote preferential interaction of a general coactivator with a specific transcription factor, in this case p300 with Smad4.
Other transcriptional coactivators that appear to be
more Smad-specific, or at least less general in their effects, include SMIF and Swift. SMIF is a Smad4-interacting cofactor that is present in the cytoplasm and accumulates in the nucleus with the Smads in response to
either TGF or BMP signals (Bai et al. 2002). Like MSG1,
SMIF on its own is not a transcriptional activator, but
interacts with both Smad4 (via the SAD) and p300, and
potentiates TGF-activated gene expression. Swift is a
Xenopus BRCT (BRCA1 C-terminal) domain-containing
protein that interacts with Smad2 and enhances activin
signaling during early development (Shimizu et al. 2001).
Whether Swift acts by recruiting general coactivators is
not known, but it does appear to be a potent transcriptional activator.
Smad-mediated gene repression
Although Smad proteins have intrinsic transcription-inducing activity, there are also many examples of genes
that are transcriptionally repressed by Smads. The repression of c-Myc in the context of the TGF cytostatic
response was the first major example of this type of effect (Siegel and Massagué 2003). With the advent of microarray-based transcriptomic assays, it became clear
that at least one-quarter of all TGF gene responses in
mammalian cells are gene repression responses (Chen et
al. 2001; Zavadil et al. 2001; Kang et al. 2003).
The inhibitory effect of TGF on c-Myc expression is
rapid and occurs in most cell types that are growth inhibited by TGF. Promoter analysis identified a TIE
within the proximal c-Myc promoter, which is required
for TGF-induced transcriptional down-regulation in
epithelial cells. The c-Myc TIE binds a complex consisting of Smad3 and Smad4, together with a heterodimer of
E2F4 or 5 and DP1 (Fig. 4B; Chen et al. 2002; Frederick et
al. 2004). Both of these heteromeric DNA-binding complexes contact DNA, via Smad- and E2F-binding sites
within the TIE. What makes this a repressive complex is
that the corepressor p107 is bound via contacts with
both E2F4/5 and Smad3 (Chen et al. 2002). Despite the
presence of more widely acting Smad transcriptional corepressors such as TGIF and Ski (see below), it is the
presence of this very specific complex that allows for
down-regulation of c-Myc.
In human keratinocytes, E2F proteins also play a role
in TGF-induced repression of the Cdc25A tyrosine
phosphatase, which is an activator of cyclin-dependent
kinases. However, this repression is a secondary gene
response mediated by the accumulation of E2F4–p130–
HDAC complexes in cells that have undergone exit from
the cell cycle (Iavarone and Massagué 1999). In mammary epithelial cells, repression of Cdc25A by TGF appears to be an immediate gene response that occurs
through an as yet unknown mechanism (Iavarone and
Massagué 1997).
Transcriptional profiling of epithelial cells demonstrated that expression of the Id1, Id2, and Id3 inhibitors
Smad signaling

of differentiation was repressed on treatment with TGF
(Fig. 4C; Kang et al. 2003). Repression of Id1 requires
binding of ATF3 and Smad3 to specific promoter elements, where ATF3 mediates transcriptional repression.
TGF elevates expression of ATF3 in a first-wave response, and then Smad3 and ATF3 cooperatively repress
Id1 expression (Kang et al. 2003). Like repression of cMyc, this is clearly a situation in which direct promoter
binding by a TGF-activated Smad complex mediates
repression of gene expression, again by a specialized
mechanism. In contrast, repression of Id2 by TGF in
keratinocytes is secondary to down-regulation of c-Myc
or induction of the Mad family of c-Myc antagonists (no
relationship to the Smad1 orthologene in Drosophila,
also named Mad) (Siegel et al. 2003).
Smad3 is also able to repress specific responses by recruiting class II histone deacetylases, such as HDAC4
(J.S. Kang et al. 2005). Smad3 interacts with the Runt
domain transcription factor, Runx2, and inhibits its ability to activate the osteocalcin promoter (Alliston et al.
2001). This effect of Smad3 is both cell type and promoter specific. In part this specificity may come from
the fact that HDAC4 itself is able to interact with Runx2
(Vega et al. 2004), again suggesting the formation of a
specific Smad-containing repressor complex that targets
certain gene responses.
Examples of Smad-mediated gene repression have also
been defined in BMP pathways. Nkx3.2 is a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor that regulates chondrocyte
differentiation under control of BMP signaling (Kim and
Lassar 2003). Nkx3.2 interacts with the mSin3/HDAC
complex in a Smad1/Smad4-dependent manner (Fig. 4B).
It appears that both the Smad complex and Nkx3.2 contact HDAC1 or 2, but that interaction of Nkx3.2 with
Smad1 is required for recruitment of the mSin3/HDAC
complex. The Mad–Medea (Smad1–Smad4) complex in
Drosophila mediates the activation of numerous gene
responses in response to the BMP-like factor, Dpp (Massagué 1998; Raftery and Sutherland 1999). However,
binding of the Mad–Medea complex to a particular element of the Brinker promoter allows the preferential recruitment of the repressor Schnurri to cause repression
(Marty et al. 2000; Muller et al. 2003). The sequence of
these Mad–Medea-binding silencers differs from the normal Dpp response element, and it is thought that this
allows for recruitment of Schnurri.
Transcriptional deactivation and derepression
Smad proteins can also inhibit gene expression by preventing the action of transcriptional activators. The inhibitory effect of TGF on skeletal muscle differentiation has been suggested to result from an interference of
Smad3 with the myogenic differentiation transcription
factor MyoD (Liu et al. 2001). In response to TGF,
Smad3 can interact with the basic helix–loop–helix
(bHLH) domain of MyoD, preventing it from forming
MyoD-E12/47 dimers and binding to E-box response elements in genes critical for myogenic differentiation (Liu
et al. 2001). Here, Smad3 inhibits gene expression by
preventing a transcription factor from exerting gene activation. A second mechanism for inhibition of myogenic differentiation has been proposed, in which Smad3
binds to another inducer of differentiation, the transcription factor MEF2, blocking its interaction with the coactivator GRIP-1 (Liu et al. 2004). Interestingly, Smad3,
but not Smad2, is implicated in these inhibitory effects
of TGF. Other reports of TGF interfering with the action of transcription factors also point at Smad3 as the
mediator of these effects (for example, Alliston et al.
2001). Thus it may be that this is a specific role of
Smad3. Nonetheless, the significance of these observations in cell culture remains unknown because no major
defect in muscle formation has been described to date in
various Smad3-null mouse models.
Certain gene responses to TGF family signals occur
in part by the ability of Smad proteins to displace transcriptional repressors from a target gene promoter. For
example, Dpp signaling in Drosophila relieves repression
of a subset of genes by inhibiting expression of the transcriptional repressor Brinker (Marty et al. 2000; Muller et
al. 2003). Brinker competes with Mad for binding to overlapping sites in specific Dpp-responsive elements, in
genes such as Zen and ultrabithorax (Ubx) (Fig. 4C; Kirkpatrick et al. 2001; Rushlow et al. 2001). By repressing
the expression of the repressor Brinker, Dpp signaling
favors the action of Mad–Medea and allows the expression of Zen and Ubx.
Self-enabled gene responses
The way in which Zen and Ubx are activated by Mad–
Medea also represents an example of what can be called
“self-enabled” gene responses, meaning gene responses
that are mediated by Smad proteins depending on prior
Smad-mediated gene responses (Fig. 4C). Other examples
of this mode of activation involve the Smad-mediated
expression of DNA-binding cofactors that then act as
partners of Smad complexes to regulate the expression of
new target genes. Such gene responses could be considered secondary in that they require new protein synthesis (synthesis of the DNA-binding cofactor) but could
also be considered primary gene responses in that they
involve the direct action of a TGF-activated Smad complex on the gene promoter in question.
In Xenopus, nodal-like signals acting via Smad2/3–
Smad4 induce the expression of Mixer (Germain et al.
2000), which then forms a Mixer–Smad2/3–Smad4 complex that binds to the goosecoid promoter to activate
gene transcription (Fig. 4C). Another example—a repression response, in this case—is provided by the TGF-
dependent inhibition of Id1 expression in mammalian
epithelial cells (Kang et al. 2003). A TGF-activated
Smad3–Smad4 complex binds to the TGF responsive
region of the Id1 promoter, initially causing a burst of
transcriptional activation. In the meantime, other
Smad3–Smad4 complexes bind to the ATF3 promoter to
induce expression of ATF3, which is a transcriptional
repressor (Fig. 4C). As it accumulates, ATF3 becomes
recruited by Smad3–Smad4 to the Id1 promoter, causing
Massagué et al.

Id1 repression (Kang et al. 2003). Thus, by specifically
inducing the expression of a Smad transcriptional partner, TGF modifies the cellular context to enable repression of the Id1 gene. By requiring the consecutive activation of two transcription factors—Smad and ATF3—
and coupling the activation of one to that of the other,
this mechanism provides tight transcriptional control.
Self-enabled gene responses have built-in devices for
the differential interpretation of effects of transient versus sustained TGF stimuli. For example, as a TGF-
dependent gene response that requires the TGF-induced expression of a Smad partner first, Id1 repression
contains a built-in time gap. Id1 repression requires a
sufficiently prolonged TGF signal that would not be
achieved by a brief exposure of the cells to TGF.
Integrated gene responses
Self-enabled gene responses may additionally provide a
mechanism for the integration of TGF transcriptional
programs. An example is provided by the induction of
p15Ink4b and p21Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which is enabled by the down-regulation of c-Myc
(Fig. 4C). c-Myc, in complex with Myc-interacting zincfinger protein-1 (Miz1), binds to a proximal promoter region of p15Ink4b and p21Cip1, inhibiting the expression
of these genes (Seoane et al. 2001; Staller et al. 2001).
Down-regulation of c-Myc by TGF relieves p15Ink4b
and p21Cip1 from c-Myc-Miz1-mediated repression
(Seoane et al. 2001, 2002), enabling activation of these
genes by Smad–FoxO complexes bound to an upstream
Smad-responsive region (Seoane et al. 2004). Therefore,
the induction of p15Ink4b and p21Cip1 by TGF is
based on two inputs, one involving direct transactivation
delivered by a Smad–FoxO complex, and the other involving a derepression by down-regulation of c-Myc.
This second input, which enables transcriptional activation by Smad–FoxO, additionally integrates the c-Myc,
p15Ink4b, and p21Cip1 responses in the TGF cytostatic
program. As each of these gene responses has an impact
on cell cycle progression, their coordinated execution
may help ensure an orderly attenuation of CDK and cMyc activities in epithelial cells undergoing cell cycle
arrest in response to TGF.
Graded Smad responses to morphogens
Organization of cell and body patterns is controlled by
gradients of cytokines referred to as “morphogens”. In
these contexts, different sets of target genes are induced
depending on the concentration of the morphogen. TGF
family members, including Dpp, certain BMPs, nodals,
and activins, are thought to act as morphogens during
embryonic development (Hogan 1996; Whitman 1998).
Different concentrations of these factors lead to different
levels of receptor occupancy and hence varying levels of
activated Smads in the nucleus (Dyson and Gurdon
1998). It is conceivable that the different affinity of
DNA-binding partners and target promoters for the activated Smad core complex dictate which Smad target promoters will be activated at low concentrations of agonist
and which at higher concentrations.
The nature of self-enabled gene responses, with their
capacity for the differential interpretation of weak and
transient versus more robust and sustained stimuli, provides a potential mechanism for the interpretation of
morphogen gradients. One example of this is suggested
by Dpp, which generates a graded expression pattern that
is crucial for the proper development of Drosophila. In
the developing wing imaginal disc of Drosophila, a key
player is the transcriptional repressor Brinker. Its expression is finely controlled by the intensity of Dpp signaling
through a morphogen-regulated silencer present in the
Brinker promoter (Marty et al. 2000). A Smad complex
containing the DNA-binding cofactor Schnurri binds to
the silencer region in the Brinker promoter to control its
expression, depending on the intensity of the signal.
Schnurri allows the Smad complex to sense different intensities of Dpp signaling and hence generate graded
transcriptional expression in response to a morphogen.
During Xenopus development, an activin-like signaling gradient (most likely formed by Xnr nodal homologs)
has been proposed to govern mesoderm formation. In
individual cells, the specific sets of genes activated in
response to the activin-like signal depend on the position
of the cell within the gradient and the absolute number
of occupied receptors on the cell surface (Dyson and Gurdon 1998). Based on these in vitro experiments with animal cap explants, it has been proposed that the magnitude of a cell’s response to activin is determined by the
rate of entry of phosphorylated Smad2 into the nucleus
(Bourillot et al. 2002). As with other TGF family responses, this links the magnitude of the transcriptional
response to the level of activin sensed by the cell. It
should be noted that these studies largely relied on the
use of an artificial system (animal cap explants) and need
to be validated in the context of the whole embryo.
Smad synexpression groups
It has long been recognized that certain groups of genes
are expressed in a seemingly coordinated manner in the
same tissue and with the same kinetics (Gawantka et al.
1998; Niehrs and Pollet 1999; Niehrs and Meinhardt
2002). Such synchronously coexpressed gene sets, or
“synexpression” groups, are particularly apparent during
embryo development (Tsang et al. 2002; Baldessari et al.
2005) and in the response of cells to specific hormones
and growth factors (Karaulanov et al. 2004). The genes in
a particular synexpression group may encode functionally diverse activities. However, their joint expression
suggests that such activities act in a complementary
fashion to achieve a programmed developmental event
or a balanced response to a stimulus.
The biological significance of this phenomenon may
be profound but its mechanistic basis remains largely
unknown. In a simple scenario, the set of genes in question would contain the same cognate sequence for a transcription factor and thus would respond together to that
Smad signaling

factor. In synexpression groups controlled by TGF family signals, the transcription complex in question would
be a particular cofactor–RSmad–Smad4 combination. A
BMP4 synexpression group in Xenopus has been analyzed with this possibility in mind (Karaulanov et al.
2004). Three of the genes representing this group are
bambi, smad7, and vent2. In vent2, BMP4-dependent induction is mediated by binding of a OAZ–Smad1–Smad4
complex to a distinct BRE in this promoter (Hata et al.
2000; Karaulanov et al. 2004). The BMP4 synexpression
promoter module defined in bambi, smad7, and other
genes in this synexpression group involves a region containing an SBE, a conserved GC-rich BRE (5-TGGC
GCC-3), and a Vent2 site, but no OAZ site (Karaulanov
et al. 2004). So, it appears that BMP-activated Smads
with OAZ induce Vent2, and Vent2 then cooperates
with BMP-activated Smads to induce the expression of
bambi, Smad7, and other genes in the synexpression
group (Fig. 4C).
These complexities may limit the ability to predict
potential Smad-responsive genes through bioinformatic
analysis of gene promoter regions. Gene expression profiling of TGF response in cells depleted of specific Smad
cofactors holds promise as an alternative approach to
identifying specific TGF synexpression groups.
Constraining Smad transcriptional functions
Several types of mechanisms have evolved to limit the
activity of Smad transcription factors (Fig. 5). One type
includes transcriptional corepressors that interfere with
the ability of Smads to engage coactivators. The homeodomain protein TGIF was identified in a screen for
Smad2-interacting proteins and was shown to be a transcriptional repressor that inhibits TGF signaling (Wotton et al. 1999a). TGIF interacts specifically with Smad2
and Smad3 and recruits a complex of general corepressors, including CtBP and the mSin3/HDAC complex
(Wotton et al. 1999b; Melhuish and Wotton 2000). Binding of TGIF prevents the interaction of Smads with coactivators, such that activation of target gene expression
is reduced. The resulting competition for Smad binding
between coactivators and corepressors helps determine
the magnitude of the transcriptional output from a given
level of signaling. A second TGIF-related protein (TGIF2)
also has Smad transcriptional corepressor activity, and
TGIF homologs, which are also Smad corepressors, are
found in other vertebrate species (Melhuish et al. 2001;
Hyman et al. 2003).
Interestingly, mutations in human TGIF are associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a severe genetic disease affecting craniofacial development, in which the
primary defect is a failure of ventral forebrain development (Gripp et al. 2000). One point mutation identified
in an HPE patient specifically prevents interaction of
TGIF with the corepressor CtBP, suggesting that the
ability of TGIF to carry out its function as a transcriptional corepressor is critical for forebrain development
(Melhuish and Wotton 2000). There is evidence from
mouse models and zebrafish that mutations affecting
TGF signaling can cause HPE-like phenotypes (Hayhurst and McConnell 2003), suggesting that over- or underactivity of TGF family signaling during embryogenesis can perturb normal craniofacial development. The
Smad corepressor, Ski (see below) has also been shown to
regulate craniofacial development. A mouse knock-out
of Ski resulted in perinatal lethality, with a high frequency of exencephaly and facial clefting, due to a failure
of neural tube closure (Berk et al. 1997). The phenotypes
of the Ski-null mice have been suggested to be analogous
to the human 1p36 deletion syndrome, and the human
Ski gene is located on chromosome 1p36 (Colmenares et
al. 2002).
The proto-oncoprotein Ski and the related protein
SnoN are transcriptional corepressors for TGF-activated Smads (Fig. 5). Both Ski and SnoN were isolated
biochemically as Smad4-interacting proteins, and were
also shown to bind Smad2 and 3 (Akiyoshi et al. 1999;
Luo et al. 1999; Stroschein et al. 1999; Sun et al. 1999a).
It has been reported that Ski, but not SnoN, can also

interact with Smads 1 and 5 (Wang et al. 2000), although
this interaction appears not to be sufficient for repression of a BMP response (Takeda et al. 2004). Ski interacts
with the N-CoR/mSin3/HDAC repressor complex (Nomura et al. 1999). Initially, Ski and SnoN were thought
to act much like TGIF, being recruited to a TGF-activated Smad complex with corepressors including
N-CoR, mSin3, and HDACs. Indeed, it was shown that
Ski was able to recruit mSin3 and HDAC1 to Smad3 and
could compete with p300 for binding to Smad3 (Luo et al.
1999). However, this is unlikely to be the whole story
and may not even be the main way in which Ski represses TGF signaling. It has been shown that Ski interacts with Smad4 via the same region of the MH2 domain that is required for interaction with Smad2 and
Smad3, and competition between Smad2 and Ski for
binding to Smad4 was demonstrated (Wu et al. 2002).
This results in a model in which Ski, and presumably
the structurally related SnoN, can prevent the formation
of an active Smad complex. However, an additional
Smad2/3 interaction domain was mapped within Ski and
SnoN, and although this appears to have a lower affinity
for Smads, it may still inhibit Smad function without
disrupting Smad complex formation (Luo et al. 1999;
Stroschein et al. 1999). Both Ski and SnoN are expressed
at relatively low levels and can undergo Smad-targeted
ubiquitination and degradation (Sun et al. 1999b; Bonni
et al. 2001; Stroschein et al. 2001). Additionally, SnoN
expression is transcriptionally up-regulated by TGF
(Stroschein et al. 1999). Thus, these various events may
generate a rich negative feedback loop to limit the duration of the Smad response.
Evi-1 is a zinc finger containing proto-oncoprotein implicated in the leukemic transformation of hemopoeitic
cells (Lopingco and Perkins 1996). Evi-1 was initially
shown to bind to Smad3 and inhibit its ability to bind to
DNA, preventing TGF-induced growth inhibition
(Kurokawa et al. 1998). However, full repression of a
Smad3-dependent transcriptional response required regions of the Evi-1 protein other than the domain that
blocked DNA binding. Later work demonstrated that
Evi-1 interacts with the corepressor protein CtBP and
that this interaction is required for full repression of a
TGF response (Izutsu et al. 2001). In addition, HDAC
has been implicated in repression by Evi-1 (Izutsu et al.
2001). This suggested that Evi-1 is a Smad transcriptional corepressor, much like TGIF (which also recruits
CtBP) and Ski/SnoN.
The fact that Evi-1 and Ski were independently identified as proteins with oncogenic potential raises the possibility that overexpression of Smad transcriptional corepressors may contribute to tumorigenesis by preventing the growth inhibitory effects of TGF. Evi-1 is a
component of the AML/Evi-1 fusion gene generated by a
3;21 chromosomal translocation (Lopingco and Perkins
1996). These fusions express the entire Evi-1 protein
fused to the DNA-binding (Runt) domain of AML1.
Among the possible explanations for how this fusion
protein contributes to hematopoietic stem cell malignancies is the possibility that overexpression of Evi-1 as
part of the fusion inhibits TGF signaling. v-Ski, which
contains a small C-terminal truncation relative to its
cellular counterpart, was identified from an avian retrovirus and shown to cause fibrosarcoma (Stavnezer et al.
1986). It appears that v-Ski overexpression, rather than
truncation, is what transform cells, suggesting increased
rather than altered function (Colmenares et al. 1991).
Thus, increased Ski expression might be expected to contribute to tumorigenesis by blocking TGF growth inhibitory signals. Indeed, the transforming ability of Ski is
dependent on its ability to inhibit TGF signaling (He et
al. 2003). Although there is no evidence that TGIF is an
oncogene, it is amplified in a subset of esophageal tumors, and cell lines derived from these tumors are more
resistant to TGF growth inhibition (Nakakuki et al.
2002). The related gene TGIF2 may also be amplified in
some ovarian tumors (Imoto et al. 2000). Thus, it may be
that the amplification or overexpression of negative
regulators of TGF activated transcription is a common
theme in tumorigenesis, even if it is not a primary event.
Other inhibitory interactions
The interaction of other regulatory proteins with either
the Smads themselves or with their coactivators results
in decreased gene expression by interfering with the formation of transcriptional activation complexes. A case
in point is the inhibitor of TGF signaling SNIP1, which
interacts with Smad4 and p300 and is thought to prevent
the formation of a functional Smad–p300 complex (Kim
et al. 2000). In contrast to Smad transcriptional corepressors, which also compete with general coactivators for
Smads, SNIP1 appears not to recruit corepressor proteins.
Another example is provided by the bHLH transcription factor neurogenin, which has been proposed to inhibit expression of glial differentiation genes by sequestering a Smad1–p300 complex away from DNA-bound
STAT1/3 at glial-specific promoters (Sun et al. 2001).
Neurogenin can also recruit the Smad1–p300 complex to
neurogenin-binding sites in neuronal gene promoters resulting in their activation (Sun et al. 2001). The sequestration of Smad1–p300 from STATs is independent of the
ability of neurogenin to bind to its own DNA site, suggesting that it is a separate repressive function. MdmX
(Kadakia et al. 2002) and FoxG1 (Seoane et al. 2004) have
also been proposed to disrupt transactivation by Smad
complexes.
Other inhibitors may act by binding Smad proteins
and barring their access to transcriptional regulators.
Mice with a targeted deletion in the gene encoding the
anti-proliferative protein Tob have increased bone mass
and increased bone formation in response to BMP2
(Yoshida et al. 2000). Tob has been proposed to sequester
BMP-activated Smads (Yoshida et al. 2000), but it has
also been proposed to interact with Smads 6 and 7 and to
localize to the plasma membrane (Yoshida et al. 2003).
Thus, Tob is capable of affecting BMP signaling, but its
precise mechanism of action is unclear. In a related example, mutations in the gene LEMD3 are responsible for
Smad signaling

diseases of increased bone density in humans (Hellemans et al. 2004). This gene encodes MAN1, an integral
inner nuclear membrane protein that binds and sequesters RSmad proteins, inhibiting their activation and association with Smad4 (Pan et al. 2005).
Roles of the inhibitory Smads
The inhibitory Smads include Smad6 and Smad7 in vertebrates (Hayashi et al. 1997; Imamura et al. 1997; Nakao
et al. 1997; Hata et al. 1998) and Dad in Drosophila (Tsuneizumi et al. 1997). The MH2 domain of Smad6 and
Smad7 is thought to have a similar overall structure to
that of Smad4 or RSmads lacking the C-terminal sites
for receptor-mediated phosphorylation. Smad7 inhibits
TGF/activin and BMP signaling (Hayashi et al. 1997;
Nakao et al. 1997), whereas Smad6 inhibits primarily the
BMP pathway (Imamura et al. 1997; Hata et al. 1998). It
should be noted that high-level overexpression of either
Smad6 or Smad7 results in inhibition of both TGF and
BMP signaling, blurring the distinctions in Smad6 and
Smad7 function.
Smad6 competes with Smad4 for interaction with the
receptor-activated Smad1, such that inactive Smad1–
Smad6 complexes are formed (Hata et al. 1998). Thus,
receptor-activated Smad1 is sequestered away from
forming active complexes with Smad4 (Fig. 5). Targeted
disruption of the Smad6 gene in mice revealed defects
consistent with an increase in BMP signaling, primarily
in the cardiovascular system, where Smad6 expression
appears to be highest (Galvin et al. 2000). A repressive
role for Smad6 in the nucleus has been proposed, and
recent evidence suggests that a Smad6 interaction with
the corepressor CtBP is required for this function (Bai et
al. 2000; Lin et al. 2003c). Smad6 does contain a CtBP
interaction motif, and an interaction is detectable, but it
remains to be determined whether this is a true role of
Smad6, and if so, how it is recruited to target promoters.
Smad7 binds to activated TGF and BMP receptors in
competition with RSmads (Fig. 5; Hayashi et al. 1997;
Nakao et al. 1997). In Xenopus, Smad7 appears to be able
to regulate both BMP and TGF signaling by this mechanism, and may in fact preferentially target BMP receptors (Bhushan et al. 1998; Casellas and Brivanlou 1998;
Souchelnytskyi et al. 1998). In Drosophila, Dad was
shown to antagonize Dpp signaling (Tsuneizumi et al.
1997), but from overexpression experiments in transgenic flies, has also been suggested to have a potential
role in Drosophila activin signaling (Marquez et al.
2001).
In addition to its roles as a competitive inhibitor,
Smad7 has been shown to play an important, and perhaps principal, role in regulating TGF receptor ubiquitination by Smurf ubiquitin ligases (Fig. 5; Kavsak et al.
2000; Suzuki et al. 2002). Smurf2 can bind to Smad7,
resulting not in immediate ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7, but in export to the cytoplasm. The
Smurf–Smad7 complex is then able bind to the TGF
receptor complex and promote its ubiquitination,
thereby down-regulating signaling (Kavsak et al. 2000;
Suzuki et al. 2002; Tajima et al. 2003). BMP receptors are
also targeted for degradation in this manner, and it appears that Smurf1, as well as Smads 6 and 7, plays a role
(Murakami et al. 2003).
The activity of Smad6 and Smad7 is regulated at many
levels, suggesting that they are key points for fine-tuning
the responses to TGF/BMP signaling. Smad7 expression
is induced by TGF, activin, and BMP signaling (Nakao
et al. 1997; Ishisaki et al. 1998; Benchabane and Wrana
2003) and likely plays an important role in a negative
feedback loop to limit the duration of the signal. Similarly, Smad6 expression can be induced by BMP signaling
(Afrakhte et al. 1998; Ishida et al. 2000). Direct binding of
Smads to the Smad6 and Smad7 promoters has been
shown to mediate these responses (Brodin et al. 2000;
Denissova et al. 2000; Hua et al. 2000; Ishida et al. 2000;
Stopa et al. 2000; von Gersdorff et al. 2000). Intriguingly,
Smad7 normally resides in the nucleus and moves to the
cytoplasm in response to TGF, suggesting that TGF
not only enhances expression of Smad7 transcription but
also mobilizes a pre-existing nuclear pool of Smad7 to
inhibit TGF receptors (Itoh et al. 1998). Smad7 expression can also be induced by other signaling inputs, which
interfere with TGF signaling. In the immune system,
where pathogenic and inflammatory signals counteract
the effects of TGF, Smad7 expression is activated by
interferon  (Ulloa et al. 1999), tumor necrosis factor ,
and interleukin-1 (Bitzer et al. 2000).
Regulation of Smads by phosphorylation of the
linker region
Phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine residues of
the MH2 domain by activated receptor is not the only
phosphorylation event controlling RSmad activity. The
RSmad linker region contains multiple serine and threonine consensus sites for ERK MAP kinases (PxS/TP sites)
and for proline-directed kinases in general. Extensive
phosphorylation of these sites by endogenous kinases,
including ERKs, is readily apparent in tissue culture
(Kretzschmar et al. 1997, 1999). In vitro, several of these
sites can be specifically phosphorylated by Erk1 and Erk2
in the case of Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 (Kretzschmar et
al. 1997, 1999). ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Smads
1, 2, and 3 was shown to attenuate the nuclear accumulation and signaling activity of these proteins in response
to agonists (Kretzschmar et al. 1997, 1999), the extent of
this effect depending on the cell type.
Smad3 has been shown to also serve as a substrate of
the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk4. The
CDK phosphorylation sites in Smad3 include threonine
and serine residues in the linker region (Matsuura et
al. 2004), which are also sites for ERK MAP kinases
(Kretzschmar et al. 1997, 1999). As in the case of ERKmediated phosphorylation, CDK-mediated phosphorykation correlates with a decrease in Smad3 signaling
activity (Matsuura et al. 2004). A similar effect has been
reported for the phosphorylation of Smad2 by the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II at a distinct site in the linker region (Wicks et al. 2000).

Unlike the structural and functional conservation of
the MH1 and MH2 domains, the linker region of RSmads
is rather divergent, providing a basis for selective regulation by upstream signals. Although the functional consequences of Smad linker phosphorylation can be acute
and provide a direct tie between Smads and several key
pathways, the molecular events triggered by these phosphorylations and their dependence on the cellular context remain a mystery. Yet, these events provide the
most direct link between Smad proteins and several key
pathways. Resolving how linker phosphorylation regulates Smad function will clarify signal integration by
Smad proteins and their inhibition in cancer.
Regulation of Smads by ubiquitination and acetylation
Smad1 and Smad2 were the first Smads reported to be
ubiquitinated, and like the classical ubiquitin-mediated
regulation of protein function, this resulted in their targeting to the 26S proteasome for degradation (Lo and
Massagué 1999; Zhu et al. 1999). Following an initial
accumulation in response to TGF, receptor-phosphorylated Smad2 is eliminated by the acute action of a phosphatase(s) (Inman et al. 2002), but also by the slower
action of ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation
(Lo and Massagué 1999). It is possible that these two
mechanisms operate to different extents on different
pools of phosphorylated Smad complexes that mediate
acute or prolonged gene responses.
In contrast to the signal-induced ubiquitination of
Smad2, Smad1 was initially shown to be targeted for
destruction by the HECT-domain E3 ligase, Smurf1, in
the absence of BMP signaling (Zhu et al. 1999). Thus,
cells with a high level of Smurf1 would have a lower
steady-state level of Smad1 and, therefore, a lower response to BMP signals (Fig. 5). This kind of ubiquitindependent regulation by Smurf1 can set the maximal
possible response to BMPs and plays an important role in
embryonic pattern formation in Xenopus and likely in
other organisms (Zhu et al. 1999; Izzi and Attisano 2004).
Thus, RSmad regulation by the ubiquitin/proteasome
pathway occurs in both the basal and activated state,
setting the maximal response in a particular cell by
modulating the overall level of the Smad, and turning
down the response once an initial burst of activation has
occurred. Although these different modes of regulation
were first uncovered separately for the TGF and BMP
pathways, constitutive and signal-induced ubiquitination may play roles in both TGF and BMP signaling.
Other Smurf family members have been identified.
dSmurf regulates BMP signaling during embryogenesis
in Drosophila (Podos et al. 2001), and mammalian
Smurf2 targets Smads 1, 2, and 3 (Izzi and Attisano 2004).
A related protein, Tiul1 (for TGIF-interacting ubiquitin
ligase), was proposed to regulate TGF signaling by causing the degradation of Smad2 (Seo et al. 2004). It appears
that a complex of Smad2, TGIF, and Tiul1, in which all
proteins are in contact with each other, is required for
Smad2 ubiquitination. This would represent an alternate
mode of inhibition of TGF signaling by the corepressor
TGIF. All of the Smurf family members contain a Cterminal HECT domain (for homologous to E6AP C terminus, a founding member of this superfamily). In addition, Smurfs contain an N-terminal C2 phospholipidand calcium-binding domain and a variable number (2–4)
of WW protein interaction domains. By means of the
WW domains, Smurfs interact with a specific motif in
the linker region of the RSmads, termed the PY motif
(PPXY) (Fig. 3; Izzi and Attisano 2004). Smad4 does not
contain a PY motif and is not directly targeted by
Smurfs, although it may become ubiquinated by Smurfs
when bound to RSmads (Moren et al. 2005). In addition
to their roles in regulating the levels of RSmads and
Smad4, Smurfs target other components of these pathways for degradation, including corepressors, Smad4, the
I-Smads, and the TGF and BMP receptors.
Other ubiquitin ligases, including SCF/Roc1, NEDD4-
2, and HsN3, can target Smads for degradation, suggesting that the regulation of Smad stability is a critical feature of modulation of the responses to TGF and BMP
signaling (Izzi and Attisano 2004). Activated Smad3 can
be bound by the SCF/Roc1 E3 complex, which results in
Smad3 export from the nucleus and its degradation in
the cytoplasm (Fukuchi et al. 2001). Ubiquitination of
activated Smad2 also requires its nuclear localization,
but whether it is exported prior to degradation is not
known (Lo and Massagué 1999). There is evidence for
Smad4 ubiquitination by the SCF -TrCP1 complex
(Wan et al. 2004) as well as the RING-domain protein
Ectodermin under conditions of protein overexpression
(Dupont et al. 2005).
In addition to the role of polyubiquitin as a tag for
degradation via the 26S proteasome, it is now becoming
clear that the addition of one or a few ubiquitin molecules can act as a signal much like phosphorylation.
Recent work pointed to this kind of regulation of Smad2
activity by Itch (Bai et al. 2004). Itch is a ubiquitin ligase
involved in the immune response of T lymphocytes and
has a similar domain structure to the Smurfs, suggesting
it may also regulate TGF family signals. Although Itchnull mice are viable, embryonic fibroblasts lacking Itch
were less sensitive to TGF-induced growth inhibition
(Bai et al. 2004). Itch was shown to promote Smad2 ubiquitination but did not result in significant Smad2 degradation. Rather, it was proposed that ubiquitinated
Smad2 interacted better with the TGF receptor complex, resulting in enhanced TGF signaling (Bai et al.
2004). Itch did appear to promote polyubiquitination,
and so it is not clear how Smad2 polyubiquitinated by
Itch differs from Smad2 polyubiquitinated by Smurf2.
The I-Smads are both targets for ubiquitination and
cofactors that promote receptor ubiquitination. Smad7
can be targeted for ubiquitination by the RING-domain
E3 ligase, Arkadia (Koinuma et al. 2003). The resulting
removal of inhibitory Smad7 results in increased responses to both TGF and BMP, which fits with the
original identification of Arkadia as an enhancer of
Nodal-related signaling required for node formation during mouse embryogenesis (Episkopou et al. 2001) and
mesoderm induction in Xenopus (Niederlander et al.
Smad signaling

2001). Thus, degradation of the inhibitor amplifies the
signal. The interplay of Smurfs and the I-Smads is, however, more complex. The susceptibility to ubiquitination
may be controlled by acetylation of the same lysine residue. Nuclear Smad7 can be acetylated by p300 at two
N-terminal lysines, which are also the sites of ubiquitin
attachment (Gronroos et al. 2002). Acetylation prevented receptor-induced ubiquitination of Smad7 by
Smurf without affecting the subcellular distribution of
Smad7, raising the possibility that acetylated Smad7 is
competent to exit the nucleus and inhibit receptor activity (Gronroos et al. 2002).
Regulation of Smads by sumoylation
The rising interest in the ubiquitin-like modification
involving SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) has
shown that sumoylation alters protein function by creating a composite interaction domain (Song et al. 2004).
One of the outcomes of sumoylation is the modulation
of protein targeting within the cell (Johnson 2004). There
is now growing evidence for a role for sumoylation in
modulating numerous transcriptional responses, often
leading to decreased transcriptional activity. Several recent reports have demonstrated the sumoylation of
Smad4. Two sumoylation consensus motifs (KxE,
where  is hydrophobic, x is variable and K is the lysine
to be modified [Melchior 2000]) are present in Smad4,
one in the MH1 domain, and one in the linker region,
and these are the sites of Smad4 sumoylation (Lee et al.
2003; Lin et al. 2003a,b; Ohshima and Shimotohno
2003).
Two opposite effects of sumoylation on Smad4 activity have been reported: increased (Lee et al. 2003; Lin et
al. 2003a,b; Ohshima and Shimotohno 2003; Liang et al.
2004) and decreased transcriptional activity (Long et al.
2004; Chang et al. 2005). It is possible that the differences observed are due to the use of different cell lines or
different readouts of Smad function. However, the apparent contradiction may reflect the more general complexities of the effects of protein sumoylation. In another
transcription factor (Elk-1), it has been shown that
SUMO can recruit the histone deacetylase, HDAC2, resulting in repression of genes that would normally be
activated (Yang and Sharrocks 2004). A recent report proposes a similar mechanism for regulation of Smad4 by
sumoylation, by binding of the factor Daxx (Chang et al.
2005).
A different explanation is required for the observation
that sumoylation increases Smad4 activity. This may
come from a potential competition between ubiquitination and sumoylation of the same lysines on Smad4. In a
different protein, IB, sumoylation on the same lysines
that are also targets of ubiquitination protects against
IB ubiquitination and degradation (Desterro et al. 1998).
There is evidence that mutation of the two SUMO target
lysines in Smad4 increased its half-life, with a concomitant decrease in the level of ubiquitinated Smad4 (Lin et
al. 2003a). It is, therefore, possible that an activated
Smad complex can be either sumoylated or ubiquitinated on the same two lysines in Smad4. If ubiquitinated, it will be targeted to the proteasome and Smadinduced gene expression will be decreased. In contrast,
sumoylation would block ubiquitination and prolong the
half-life of the complex, allowing it to reach a target
gene. Sumoylation may be a relatively dynamic modification. Thus, it may be that SUMO plays roles in activation and repression and that the balance between ubiquitination, sumoylation, and desumoylation is critical.
Several groups identified members of the PIAS (protein
inhibitor of activated STAT) family as SUMO E3 ligases
for Smad4 (Fig. 5; Lee et al. 2003; Ohshima and Shimotohno 2003; Liang et al. 2004). PIAS proteins are SUMO
E3s for a growing number of proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, but it also appears that in some
cases they act as transcriptional cofactors independent of
their ability to promote sumoylation (Schmidt and
Muller 2003). As is the case for many SUMO-modified
proteins, a clear understanding of the important physiological outcomes requires further investigation.
Smads as nodes for signal integration
Cytokines of the TGF family control many critical processes during development and tissue homeostasis. Cell
proliferation, differentiation, positioning, migration, metabolism, and apoptosis are exquisitely regulated and coordinated by Smad signaling pathways. However, this
occurs in concert with other pathways impinging on the
cell. The correct integration of these inputs is essential
for their proper interpretation by the cell in the control
of gene expression. Smad proteins provide an important
platform for the integration of many inputs. At one level
or another, essentially all major signaling pathways have
been shown to converge on Smads as a node for signal
integration. Here we discuss only a few prominent examples (Fig. 6).
Elements for integration: the linker, the corridor,
and the partners
Besides the receptor-mediated phosphorylation of the Cterminal tail, three main venues exist for Smad regulation by diverse inputs. One venue is the linker region
between the MH1 and MH2 domains of RSmads, which
undergoes phosphorylation by pathways that activate
ERK MAP kinases, CDKs, and other protein kinases, as
well as recognition by Smurf ubiquitin ligases. In Smad4,
the linker region is a site for sumoylation and for presentation or occlusion of the NES.
Another important venue for signal integration is provided by the various surfaces of the Smad molecule that
contact DNA-binding cofactors, coactivators, or corepressors. The most remarkable of these surfaces is the
hydrophobic corridor on the MH2 domain. This region is
a site for competing interactions with the cytoplasmic
anchor SARA, nucleoporins, and specific DNA-binding
proteins involved in recruitment of Smads to DNA. Inputs that alter the levels of these different proteins may
Massagué et al.
2800 GENES & DEVELOPMENT
Downloaded from on October 6, 2025 - Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press

influence the competitive advantage of one Smad partner
over others for binding into the hydrophobic corridor.
A third major venue for input integration are the
DNA-binding cofactors, coactivators, and corepressors
themselves, which are subject to their own set of regulatory inputs that secondarily affect the activity of Smad
transcriptional complexes in which these factors participate (Fig. 6). Collectively, these three venues convey inputs from essentially all the major signal transduction
pathways.
Smad cross-talk with major pathways
Ras and TGF pathways act cooperatively as well as antagonistically during development and in oncogenesis
(Massagué 2003). In response to mitogenic signals via
receptor tyrosine kinases and the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 are phosphorylated by
ERK at multiple MAP kinase sites in the linker region
that negatively affect Smad function (Kretzschmar et al.
1997). The integration of Smad and Ras/MAPK pathways
during Xenopus development has provided insights into
the relevance of this regulatory node. In Xenopus development, BMP signaling via Smad1 inhibits neural development, and this effect is blocked by ERK-activating factors FGF8 and IGF2 (Wilson et al. 1997; Pera et al. 2003).
These inputs inhibit Smad function and favor neural differentiation and mesoderm dorsalization in Xenopus by
inhibiting BMP signaling (Pera et al. 2003). Ectopic expression of Smad1 in developing Xenopus embryos led to
a mild ventralization phenotype, which was strongly enhanced when a Smad1 mutant lacking all MAP kinase
sites was used. In various neural induction assays, this
Smad1 mutant blocked the neuralizing effects of FGF8
and IGF2, whereas the wild-type Smad1 did not. FGF8
and IGF2 induce MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of
Smad1 at the linker region in cell culture (Pera et al.
2003), as do EGF and HGF (Kretzschmar et al. 1997).
Furthermore, Smad1 can undergo linker phosphorylation
by endogenous MAPK in Xenopus embryos (Pera et al.
2003). The onset of Smad1 linker phosphorylation occurs
in the early to mid-gastrula stage, along with an increase
in endogenous Erk activation.
Experiments with targeted mouse mutations demonstrated that phosphorylation of Smad1 by MAP kinases
and BMP receptors have qualitatively different outcomes, not just effects on the magnitude of the BMP
signal (Aubin et al. 2004). A mutant Smad1 lacking the
C-terminal phosphorylation sites had largely the same
phenotype as the null mutation. In contrast, mutations
that abolished MAP kinase phosphorylation sites generated novel phenotypes affecting germ cells and gastric
function, suggesting that these phosphorylations may
not only limit the action of BMP, but also modulate it in
a more subtle manner.
In Xenopus, the mid-gastrula-stage ectoderm abruptly
loses competence to generate mesoderm in response to
activin-like signals (Grainger and Gurdon 1989). This coincides with an inability of Smad2 to translocate to the
nucleus in response to activin and an increase in Smad2
phosphorylation (Grimm and Gurdon 2002). Remarkably, a mutant Smad2 lacking MAPK sites in the linker
was able to translocate into the nucleus in response to
activin at the gastrula stage, suggesting that the loss of
competence in the ectoderm is mediated by linker phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of Smad2 (Grimm and
Gurdon 2002). How phosphorylation of the linker region
may inhibit nuclear accumulation or alter other functions of RSmads remains an enigma.
The p38 and JNK pathways can selectively modulate
certain TGF gene responses that depend on transcription factors controlled by p38 and JNK MAP kinases.
One example of this regulation is provided by the inhibitory effect of TGF on Id1 expression in epithelial cells
(Chen et al. 2001). TGF inhibits Id1 expression through
Smad3–Smad4 in concert with ATF3. ATF3 itself can be
induced by the activity of JNK and p38. TNF (tumor
necrosis factor ) and other agonists that signal via JNK
and p38 induce ATF3 expression, which favors the repression of Id1 by TGF-activated Smads (Kang et al.
2003).
The PI3K–AKT pathway inhibits TGF gene responses
that depend on FoxO factors. AKT phosphorylates FoxO
factors, causing their exclusion from the nucleus (Brunet
et al. 1999). As a result, high levels of AKT activity inhibit the ability of FoxO to function as a partner of
Smad3–Smad4 complexes for p21Cip1 induction (Seoane
Figure 6. Smads as nodes for signal integration.
The scheme depicts some examples of cross-talk
between Smads and major signal transduction pathways. Inputs by other pathways occur by signal-mediated expression of Smad7, which acts as an inhibitor of receptor-mediated Smad activation (box 1);
signal-mediated phosphorylation of the Smad linker
region, which negatively regulates certain Smad
functions (box 2); and signal-mediated activation of
transcription factors that target specific genes in
concert with Smads (box 3). (RTKs) Receptor tyrosine kinases. See the text for other abbreviations

Smad signaling

et al. 2004). Mitogenic growth factors that activate the
PI3K–AKT pathway can thereby attenuate the induction
of p21Cip1 by TGF and counteract its anti-mitogenic
activity. Hyperactivation of the PI3K–AKT pathway by
loss of the tumor suppressor lipid phosphatase PTEN, as
commonly occurs in glioblastoma cells, can have a similar effect (Seoane et al. 2004).
The Wnt/-catenin/TCF pathway cooperates with
TGF signaling by forming Smad–TCF complexes that
control joint target genes. Smad4 has been shown to interact with -catenin and TCF/LEF1, which form a transcriptional activation complex in response to Wnt signaling. This complex activates Xtwn expression during
Xenopus development (Nishita et al. 2000). Similarly, in
mouse development, Wnt and BMP signaling cooperatively regulate expression of Emx2 (Theil et al. 2002). In
an animal model of renal dysplasia, an interaction between -catenin and a Smad1–Smad4 complex cooperatively regulates c-Myc expression (Hu and Rosenblum
2005).
Several forms of cooperation between Smads and
nuclear receptors have been proposed. Interactions of the
androgen receptor (AR) and Smad3 have been reported,
which result in enhancement or inhibition of AR activity by Smad3 and repression of TGF signaling by AR,
depending on the conditions (Hayes et al. 2001; Chipuk
et al. 2002; Kang et al. 2002).
Other forms of cross-talk affect Smads less directly.
Interferon- signaling via the Jak/STAT1 pathway (Ulloa
et al. 1999) and TNF signaling via NF-B (Bitzer et al.
2000) can induce the expression of Smad7. This accumulation of Smad7 in interferon- or TNF-treated cells
inhibits TGF receptor signaling. IFN signaling via
the inflammatory response pathway is generally antagonistic to TGF signals, and up-regulation of Smad7 expression by IFN provides a mechanistic basis for this
antagonism. However, the interplay between Smad
and STAT or TNF pathways is not purely antagonistic.
Recall that Smad1 and STAT3 cooperatively activate
the glial fibrillary acidic protein to induce astrocyte
differentiation (Nakashima et al. 1999), and TNF
can cooperate with TGF in the repression of Id1 expression (Kang et al. 2003). There are many other examples
in which Smads interact with other signal-regulated transcription factors, either directly or via coactivators.
Perspectives
The extraordinary amount of information accumulated
in just a few years has shed substantial light on the molecular properties that make the Smad proteins such
widespread and versatile nodes for signal integration and
regulation of gene expression. This versatility is a result
of the remarkable functional flexibility of these proteins.
The MH1 domain, the linker region, and, very especially,
the MH2 domain, with their interactive surfaces that
admit many different partners and regulatory inputs,
convert a simple pathway into a major highway for cell
signaling. These considerations take us back to biological problems. Building on a large body of information and
new high-throughput technologies, a new era has started
for the field at large, in which long-standing problems of
major importance, but daunting complexity, can be addressed at last. To this end, the field is likely to move in
several complementary directions:
● Long-standing questions about the basic elements of
this pathway, such as the basis for Smad-dependent
signaling in the absence of Smad4, the role of the MH1
domain insert, or the identity of RSmad phosphatases,
still need to be addressed.
● The structural basis for the assembly of Smad transcriptional complexes on the DNA is not known. Yet,
insights into this question would be critical for understanding the versatility of Smad proteins and providing information for selectively targeting Smad interactions that lead to fibrotic disorders or tumor metastasis.
● The transcriptional action of Smad complexes has yet
to be parsed into discrete steps of sequential recruitment or cyclical exchange of chromatin remodeling
activities that give rise to temporally restricted transcriptional responses.
● The functional consequences of several Smad posttranslation modifications (e.g., linker phosphorylation, sumoylation) remain largely unknown. One challenge is to determine the role of these modifications in
physiological settings.
● The effects of TGF on specific target genes and the
cellular functions that these genes control have been
studied largely one at a time. The ability to dissect
Smad-regulated gene synexpression groups should
help define how diverse cellular functions are jointly
controlled by TGF–Smad signals. This would shed
light into how TGF-induced changes in cell cycle
progression, for example, are orchestrated with
changes in cytokine production, cell adhesion behavior, or cell shape.
● Current high-throughput methods for the analysis of
protein interactions are taking the modeling of signal
transduction processes to an entirely new level. However, when this level of resolution is achieved, the
information that it yields is useful to the extent that
it relates to physiologically meaningful conditions.
Challenges in this area include the need to perform
these analyses under such conditions.
Admittedly, the list of future directions could be much
longer, and the choices listed above may just reflect the
particular interests of the authors. However, it is clear
that the TGF signal transduction pathway, and the
Smad transcription factors that have been studied so doggedly for years, have come of age. This important piece of
molecular machinery controlling the complex behavior
of metazoan cells remains a major focus of study, not
only to further define its own workings, but also as a tool
to pry open many aspects of fundamental biology, as well
as the pathogenesis of human diseases resulting from the
malfunction of the Smad pathways.
