Abstract
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of liver transplantation (LT) in Western countries. Polymorphism in the
IL28B gene region has a major impact on the natural history and response to antiviral treatment in HCV. We investigated
whether IL28B polymorphism was associated with graft survival in patients with or without HCV undergoing LT. 1,060 adult
patients (age .18 years) underwent LT between years 2000 and 2008. Patients with previous LT, living donor LT and
patients dying or requiring retransplants within 30 days of LT were excluded. DNA samples of 620 (84%) recipients and 377
(51%) donors were available for genotyping of IL28B rs12979860C.T. Donor IL28B genotypes had no significant differences
in graft survival irrespective of HCV status. There was no difference in graft outcome in the non-HCV cohort (n = 293) based
on recipient IL28B genotype. In the HCV group (n = 327), recipients with CC or CT genotype had better graft survival
compared to TT genotype (62% vs. 48%, p = 0.02). HCV recipients with CC or CT genotype had delayed time to clinically
relevant HCV recurrence compared to TT (10.4 vs. 6.7 months, p = 0.002). The beneficial effect of the CC/CT genotype on
HCV recurrence and graft survival was independent of antiviral treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that in
contrast to donor IL28B genotype recipient IL28B was associated with graft survival and clinically relevant HCV recurrence in
HCV infected recipients. No effect of IL28B genotype was manifest in non-HCV LT recipients.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects about 4 million people in the
United States and nearly 170 million people worldwide [1]. HCV
causes 40% of all chronic liver disease in US and HCV-associated
cirrhosis is the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) in
the US [2]. Recurrent HCV is the leading cause of graft failure
after LT in HCV recipients and treatment with interferon based
anti-viral therapy is offered for those with recurrent HCV after LT
but bears sub-optimal response rates and is poorly tolerated [3]. It
has been reported that an IL28B gene polymorphism was
associated with spontaneous clearance and sustained virological
response (SVR) to interferon based therapy in general populations
affected with HCV [4–6]. More recently studies have shown that
the IL28B polymorphism was associated with SVR to pegylatedinterferon and ribavirin therapy for recurrent HCV after LT [7–
11].
IL28A, IL28B and IL29, also called type III or lambda
interferons (IFN-l3), are induced by viral infections and are
upregulated in hepatocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells of individuals with HCV infection [12,13]. IL28B is
encoded by six exons and located on chromosome 19. IL28B
interacts with a heterodynamic class II cytokine receptor that
consists of IL10Rb and IL28Ra, resulting in antiviral activity
by induction of interferon-stimulated genes through JAKSTAT pathway [12,14,15]. IFN-l3, the product of IL28B
gene, was found to regulate Treg and enhance adaptive
cellular immunity [16].
Understanding the impact of donor and recipient IL28B
variants on post-transplant outcomes might yield novel insights
into the mechanism of liver graft failure. Recent studies point
to an influence of IL28B variants on response to anti-HCV
therapy and HCV recurrence [7–11,17]. Data regarding the
effect of IL28B on overall graft survival are scare. Herein, we
investigated whether donor and recipient IL28B polymorphism
are associated with long-term graft survival in a large cohort of
non-HCV and HCV infected LT recipients.

Materials and Methods
Study Population
We studied consecutive adult patients (age .18 years) who
underwent LT at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York between
January 2000 and December 2008. Patients who had retransplants, living donor liver transplants, or patients dying or
requiring retransplantation within 30 days of LT (primary nonfunction, PNF) were excluded from analysis [18]. As standard of
care adopted by our center, all patients received IL2 receptor
antibody for induction therapy, and were maintained on
tacrolimus with or without mycophenolate mofetil and steroid
taper (off steroids by 6 months post LT). Samples used for DNA
analysis and clinical data on these patients were entered
prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. All patients were
followed until graft loss, death or the last follow-up visit.
Clinical data collected included donor and recipient age,
ethnicity and gender, cold ischemia time, presence of hypertension, diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HCV
status, HCV genotype (tested since 2004), HCV viral load
(tested since 2004), anti-HCV therapy, Model for End-Stage
Liver Disease (MELD) score at the time of LT, cause of liver
failure, liver chemistry tests, liver biopsy results, date of death or
graft failure. Graft survival data were also obtained from
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). Liver
related graft loss was defined as graft loss occurring secondary
to complications of portal hypertension or liver failure directly
related to HCV. Non-liver related graft loss was defined as
death due to causes unrelated to HCV recurrence or liver
disease and with a functioning graft. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Mount Sinai School of
Medicine. The IRB waived the need for written, informed
consent for this retrospective chart review.
Definition of HCV Recurrence and Antiviral Therapy
Clinically relevant HCV recurrence was defined as histological
evidence of HCV in a liver biopsy that was performed in the
setting of abnormal liver chemistry tests. On histology HCV
recurrence was defined as$grade 1 inflammation [19]. Patients
who did not undergo liver biopsy were excluded from the analysis
of HCV recurrence. Sustained virological response (SVR) was
defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the
end of treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Patients
were started on therapy if they had$stage 2 fibrosis on liver biopsy
or the cholestatic variant of HCV recurrence. An escalating dose
regimen was used for treatment for recurrent HCV consisting of
pegylated interferon alpha 2b (90 mg SQ weekly) and ribavirin
(400 mg PO daily) and advancing to full dose within 4–8 weeks
depending on the tolerability and blood counts. All patients
received 48 weeks of therapy regardless of their genotype and
despite virological response. Reasons for discontinuation included
infection, rejection, severe cardiovascular complications, and
severe rash.
IL28B Genotyping
Recipient DNA samples were obtained from paraffin-embedded explanted recipient liver and donor DNA samples were
obtained from paraffin-embedded pre-implantation biopsy of the
liver graft. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded liver
tissue blocks per the manufacturer’s protocol (DNeasy blood
and tissue kit, Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA, USA). IL28B
genotyping (rs12979860) was performed using the Taqman
Real-Time PCR assay and allelic discrimination kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
IL28 Gene Expression
For IL28 gene expression, total RNA was extracted according
to manufacturer’s protocol (RNeasy FEPE Kit, Qiagen Inc,
Valencia, CA, USA) from paraffin-embedded pre-implantation
biopsies of donor liver. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using
Omniscript RT kit and qRT-PCR was perfomed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit from the same manufacturer. Primers
were designed for IL28 as previously described [20]. The
expression levels of IL28 mRNA were normalized to expression
of housekeeping gene 18S.
Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as means 6 standard deviation, unless
stated otherwise. T-test was used to analyze continuous variables
and chi-square test was used for categorical variables. HardyWeinberg equilibrium for genotypes was tested as previously
described [21]. Graft survival curves were compared using
Kaplan-Meier test and multiple logistic regression method was
used for multivariable analysis. The impact of sustained virological
response (SVR) or anti-viral therapy on graft outcome was
analyzed in a multivariable approach. In the multivariable
approach variables with a p,0.2 in the univariable analysis were
included. P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version
18.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Assuming
the following for the HCV group: alpha = 0.05, 8 years of accrual
time (2000–2008), 5.5 years of follow-up time, and a median
survival of 5 years for ‘‘controls’’ (CC/CT genotype), 254
‘‘controls’’ (CC/CT) and 73 ‘‘at-risk’’ (TT) subjects provides a
power of 90% to detect a hazard ratio of 1.75 for survival using
conventional Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Assuming the same
for the non-HCV group, 251 ‘‘controls’’ and 42 ‘‘at-risk’’ subjects
provides a power of 74% to detect a hazard ratio of 1.75 for
survival.
Results
Patient Characteristics
1060 adult patients (age .18 years) underwent LT between
January 2000 and December 2008. After excluding 319 patients
who had retransplants (n = 156), living donor transplants (n = 115),
PNF or death within 30 days of LT (n = 48), we included 741
patients who were primary deceased donor LT recipients. Of the
741, DNA samples were available and adequate for IL28B
genotyping of 620 (84%) recipients and corresponding 377 (51%)
donors. Of 620 recipients, 327 were HCV recipients and 293 were
non-HCV recipients. Of 377 donors, 202 were donors for HCV
recipients and 175 were donors for non-HCV recipients (Fig. 1).
Among recipients without graft loss, follow-up times ranged from
1.5 years to 10.6 years. Mean follow up was 5.562.5 years.
Demographic and clinical characteristics, stratified by HCV
status and recipient IL28B genotype are shown in table 1. Based
on graft survival data, patients were grouped into CC or CT
genotype and TT genotype, and demographics were compared
between these two groups. Among HCV recipients, there were no
significant differences between patients with CC/CT genotype
compared to patients with TT genotype. Among non-HCV
recipients, proportion of male recipients was significantly higher
with genotype CC/CT compared to TT genotype (Table 1).
IL28B Genotype Distribution
Among recipients, genotype frequencies were 37%, 45% and
18% respectively for CC, CT and TT genotypes. Among donors,
genotype frequencies were 34%, 45% and 21% respectively for

CC, CT and TT genotypes (Table 2). These frequencies were in
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. CC genotype was significantly less
prevalent in HCV compared to non-HCV recipients (31% vs.
47%, p,0.001). Within the HCV group, there was no significant
difference in prevalence of CC genotype between recipients and
donors (31% vs. 33%, p = 0.36).

Recipient IL28B Genotype was Associated with Graft
Survival
Among HCV recipients, overall graft survival rates were 61%,
62% and 48% respectively for patients with CC, CT and TT
genotypes. Given similar survival between CC and CT genotypes,
survival curves were plotted comparing the group with recipient
IL28B CC/CT and the TT. Graft survival was higher in CC/CT
compared to TT recipients (62% vs. 48%, p = 0.02, Fig. 2A). Nonliver related graft loss included infection/sepsis (75%), cardiac
events (9%), cancer (5%), (CVA (3%), MVA (1.5%), suicide
(1.5%), GVHD (1.5%), PTLD (1.5%), PML (1.5%).
Liver related graft loss was defined as graft loss occurring
secondary to complications of portal hypertension or liver failure.
77% had jaundice/ascites; 15% fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis; 8%
variceal bleeding. When survival curves were plotted using liverrelated only graft loss, effect of IL28B genotype on graft survival
was still evident with a graft survival of 80% in CC/CT vs. 66% in
TT genotype (p = 0.006). Among non-HCV recipients, graft
survival rates were 82%, 76% and 69% respectively for patients
with CC, CT and TT genotypes. There was no significant
difference in graft survival in non-HCV recipients with CC/CT
and TT genotype (Fig. 2B). In addition, no significant differences
in graft survival were observed based on donor IL28B genotype
irrespective of recipient HCV status (Fig. 3A, 3B). The study did
not have the power to assess the effect of matched recipient and
donor TT and CC/CT genotypes on graft survival.
Multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed for the
entire cohort adjusting for covariates with p,0.2 in the univariate
analysis (donor and recipient age, presence of hypertension and
diabetes, HCV status, HCV viral load at the time of LT, HCV
genotype, HCC status, and IL28B genotype). Recipient IL28B

and diabetes (HR 12.86; 95% CI 5.17–32.07; p,0.001) were the
only factors that significantly influenced graft survival.
We next tested the impact of SVR and IFN therapy on graft
survival in the HCV population. In a univariate analysis neither
SVR (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.69–1.01; p = 0.07) nor IFN therapy
(HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.73–1.03; p = 0.11) was an independent
predictor for graft survival. IL28B genotype remained an
independent predictor for graft survival after adjusting for SVR
(HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.06–1.59; p = 0.01) or IFN therapy (HR 1.31;
95% CI 1.07–1.60; p = 0.01).
Recipient IL28B Genotype was Associated with Time to
Clinically Relevant HCV Recurrence
We tested the effect on IL28B on timing of HCV recurrence
because HCV recurrence, especially within first year after LT, was
associated with worse graft and patient outcomes [22]. Only
patients with at least one liver biopsy were included in this analysis.
Of the 327 HCV recipients, 286 (87%) had clinically warranted
liver biopsies. 50% of the biopsies were performed after 3 months
of LT (Fig. S1). 91% of patients that had a biopsy within 3 months
of LT that did not show recurrence of HCV had at least one
further biopsy 3 months after LT. 16% of HCV patients had two,
20% had three, 37% had more than three liver graft biopsies after
LT.
238 (83%) patients had evidence of histological HCV recurrence. Rates of histological HCV recurrence for the entire followup were 81% and 92% for CC/CT and TT, respectively. There
was no significant difference in the histological grading of HCV
recurrence severity or fibrosis scores among the IL28B groups.
Because liver biopsies were not performed at the same time point
post LT time dependent variability cannot be excluded.
The median time to histological HCV recurrence was
significantly longer (p = 0.002) in CC/CT (10.4 months; IQR
4.8–30.6) compared to recipients with TT genotype (6.7 months;
IQR 2.9–11.5). Plotted over time CC/CT recipients had
significantly lower rates of histological HCV recurrence within
the first year after LT compared to TT genotype (45% vs. 75%,
p = 0.002; Fig. 4).
Effect of IL28B Genotype on Sustained Virological
Response (SVR)
Of 238 patients with histological HCV recurrence, 108 (45%)
received treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. While
recipient IL28B genotype data were available for all 108 patients,
donor IL28B genotype data were available for 70% of the patients.
The rates of SVR were 30% in CC/CT and 17% in TT recipients
(p = 0.15, Fig. S2A). The rates of SVR were 33% in CC/CT and
27% in TT donors (p = 0.5, Fig. S2B).
IL28B Genotype had no Effect on IL28 Gene Expression
We tested whether intrahepatic IL28B mRNA expression was
affected by the IL28B genotypes. We observed no significant
differences of the IL28 mRNA transcripts based IL28B CC/CT
and TT genotypes (Fig. 5).
Discussion
Our results showed that recipient IL28B polymorphism was
linked with outcomes in patients with HCV undergoing LT. We
found that while donor IL28B genotype was not associated with
graft survival, the recipient IL28B TT genotype, compared to
CC/CT genotypes, was associated with early and clinically
relevant HCV recurrence and inferior graft survival. We also
found that the detrimental effect of the TT genotype on HCV
recurrence and graft survival was independent of antiviral
treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that
IL28B genotype had no effect on graft survival in a large cohort of
non-HCV patients.
Our findings that effects of IL28B genotype were independent
of anti-viral therapy were consistent with studies that have shown
that the C allele of IL28B rs12979860, as compared to T allele,
was associated with higher rates of spontaneous viral clearance
[5,23,24]. While viral clearance is unlikely to occur after LT we
hypothesize that IL28B genotype was associated with an altered
innate immune response (e.g. interferon-stimulated genes) to
induce an anti-viral state. This is in agreement with data that
the expression of hepatic interferon-stimulated genes was strongly
associated with IL28B variants producing a more favorable
immunologic profile for viral clearance [25,26]. Interestingly, in
the absence of HCV infection, interferon stimulated gene
expression in the liver was not associated with the IL28B genotype
[27]. Confirming previous data our results showed that there was
no correlation between IL28B genotypes and IL28B gene
transcript levels [26]. How genetic polymorphisms affect IL28B

function is not fully understood and merits further studies but our
observation that IL28B genotype had no effect in the non-HCV
population supports a direct or indirect anti-viral effect.
While several recent studies have reported the effects of IL28B
genotype on anti-viral response after LT our study is one of the
largest with a long follow up that examined the effects of IL28B on
the natural history of HCV in untreated recipients [9,11,17,28]. A
study conducted in Europe that included 91 patients with HCV
liver graft reinfection showed that the response to antiviral therapy
was strongly associated with the donor’s IL28B TT genotype but
only weakly with the recipient’s IL28B genotype [8]. No significant
association of either recipient or donor IL28B genotype with 3 and
5-year graft or patient survival were observed [8]. Charlton et al.
studied 189 HCV infected LT patients in the U.S. of whom one
third were treated for recurrent HCV [9]. While the IL28B
genotype of the donor and recipient were strongly and independently associated with higher rates of SVR, there was no
significant difference in overall graft survival [9]. Coto-Llerena
et al. tested the effects of the IL28B genotypes in 128 European
donor and recipient pairs and found that the recipient genotype
played a major role in the response to therapy, while donors effect
depended on a favorable recipient IL28B genotype [10].
In agreement with other data we did not find an association
between donor IL28B genotype and liver outcomes [17]. This is in
contrast to reports suggesting an important influence of the donor
IL28B genotype in HCV infected recipients [8–10]. In addition,
others found that a favorable donor IL28B CC genotype was only
noticeable after antiviral therapy [11]. As donor PBMC are often
not available several studies used DNA samples obtained from
implanted liver biopsies. The rapid repopulation of the graft with
recipient-derived cells can confound the donor genotype determination explaining some of the discrepancies observed among
different studies [30]. In contrast, our donor DNA samples were
isolated from lever tissue before transplantation. While recipient
IL28B genotype is an important biomarker after LT we believe
that the effect of the donor IL28B on post transplant course
requires further studies.
IL28B is produced by both bone marrow-derived as well as
hepatocytes and the interplay between donor and recipient
genotypes is complex after LT. It has been established that in
murine models of LT, a proportion of the liver allografts nonparenchymal cells are recipient in origin and as such the recipient
genotypes may ultimately impact long-term liver allograft function
[29]. Thus, IL28B might cause an attenuation of the anti-viral
state due to altered intragraft interferon-stimulated gene and IFNk1-3 expression.
Although we found a trend towards lower rates of SVR in the
IL28B TT neither recipient nor donor IL28B status were
significantly associated with SVR after anti-HCV treatment as it
was observed in other studies [7–11]. In addition, we observed
30% SVR rate in the favorable IL28B genotype which was lower
compared to other studies ranging from 42 to 86%. Lack of an
association and lower rate of SVR in our study might be due to
ethnic differences, timing of treatment initiation, disease severity,
treatment adherence, the type (deceased versus living) and quality
of the donor organ (e.g. donor age). Of note our study included a
higher rate of African Americans compared to other studies [8–
10].
In our HCV cohort, the prevalence of CC genotype was similar
between recipients and donors. However, prevalence of CC
genotype was significantly less in HCV infected LT recipients
compared to non-HCV LT recipients. This is consistent with
previous findings that reported a significantly lower prevalence of
CC genotype in HCV infected LT recipients [8,9]. These findings
suggest that HCV infected patients with CC genotype had better
outcomes leading to enrichment of non-CC genotypes in patients
that progress to end stage liver disease requiring LT.
The large sample size of consecutively enrolled patients is a
major strength of our study. Furthermore, our cohort’s liver
allograft survival rates at 1 and 5 years are comparable to
nationwide deceased donor liver graft survival rates of 82% and
68% respectively [31]. However, given the lack of an association
between IL28B genotype and graft survival in the non-HCV
group, we acknowledge that our study may be underpowered to
detect a possible association in this subgroup. Our study is
somewhat limited by the fact that our data on HCV recurrence
was based on clinically indicated biopsies rather than timed
protocol biopsies. 87% of our HCV cohort underwent at least on
biopsy, of these 73% had two or more biopsies reflecting our
program’s low threshold for performing liver biopsies in the setting
of abnormal liver chemistry tests.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that donor IL28B
genotype did not affect graft survival in contrast to recipient
IL28B genotype, which was associated with graft survival, and
clinically relevant HCV recurrence after LT in HCV infected
recipients.
