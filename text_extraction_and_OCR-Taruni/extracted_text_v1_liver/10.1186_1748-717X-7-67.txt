Abstract
Background: To report single-institutional clinical outcomes and toxicity with SBRT for cholangiocarcinoma.
Methods: From March 2009 to July 2011, 10 patients with 12 unresectable primary (n = 6) or recurrent (n = 6)
cholangiocarcinoma lesions underwent abdominal SBRT. Sites treated included liver (n = 10), abdominal lymph
nodes (n = 1), and adrenal gland (n = 1). SBRT was delivered in three (n = 2) or five (n = 10) consecutive daily
fractions over one week. The median prescription dose was 55 Gy (range, 45–60). Treatment response was graded
by RECIST v.1.1, and toxicities were scored by CTCAE v.4.0. Data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to
determine rates of local control (LC), freedom from distant progression (FFDM) and overall survival (OS).
Results: The median follow-up was 14 months (range, 2–26 months). LC, defined as freedom from progression
within the SBRT field, was 100%, but four patients treated to intrahepatic sites experienced progression elsewhere in
the liver. Estimates for FFDM at 6 and 12 months were 73% and 31%, respectively. Sites of disease relapse included
liver (n = 3), liver and lymph nodes (n = 1), liver and lungs (n = 1), lymph nodes (n = 1), and mesentery (n = 1). OS
estimates for the cohort at 6 and 12 months were 83% and 73%, respectively. The most common Grade ≥2 early
toxicities were Grade 2 nausea and vomiting (n = 5) and gastrointestinal pain (n = 2). Late ≥2 toxicities included
Grade 2 gastrointestinal pain (n = 3), Grade 3 biliary stenosis (n = 1), and Grade 5 liver failure (n = 1).
Conclusions: SBRT shows promise as an effective local therapy for properly-selected patients with
cholangiocarcinoma. Further follow-up is needed to better quantify the risk of late complications associated with
SBRT.

Background
Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare, locally-aggressive malignancy
of the biliary tree that is traditionally classified as either
intra- or extra-hepatic, based on its location within the bile
ducts. Currently, the only known curative therapy for cholangiocarcinoma is surgical resection [1,2]. Unfortunately,
the majority of patients present with unresectable disease,
and even when all disease is amenable to resection, local
recurrence is common [1,3]. Non-surgical options for
patients with unresectable or recurrent disease include
combinations of chemotherapy, external beam radiotherapy
(EBRT), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and/or photodynamic therapy
(PDT) [4-8], although EBRT is the most common local
therapy utilized for patients without metastatic disease.
Yet even with this diverse array of treatment modalities,
the median survival for locally-advanced or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma is approximately 9 months, and 5-year
overall survival is less than 5% [9].
While the majority of patients eventually progress
within the high-dose region when treating with standardfractionation EBRT [5], most contemporary series have
demonstrated a clinical dose–response relationship [5,10,11].
This has resulted in a renewed interest in dose-escalation as
a means of improving disease control and survival. One way
in which dose escalation may be achieved is through the use * Correspondence: barney.brandon@mayo.edu 1

of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), which involves the
delivery of very high doses of highly conformal radiotherapy
in five or fewer fractions. Some early reports of SBRT for
unresectable cholangiocarcinoma have shown equivalent or
improved rates of local control compared to EBRT, albeit
with increased toxicity [12-16]. Since 2008, we have enrolled
patients with unresectable or recurrent cholangiocarcinomas
treated with SBRT in a prospectively-maintained institutional database. In this study, we present the early clinical
outcomes and toxicity associated with SBRT for unresectable
or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma.
Methods
Patients
This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional
Review Board (IRB) and appropriate informed consent
was obtained prior to treatment. All clinical data was
obtained from the prospective institutional SBRT database.
This database is maintained through continued review by
the institutional IRB, and all patients give informed consent prior to being included therein. No patient in this
study was treated on protocol. All prospectively collected
data was confirmed and analyzed retrospectively for the
purposes of this review. All patients had a biopsy-proven
cancer diagnosis and had undergone complete staging
evaluation with history, physical exam, and full-body imaging with either computed or positron emission tomography. Patients with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma were
considered for SBRT as long as all active disease was
amenable to some form of local therapy, or if the patient
had symptomatic disease progression. Appropriate imaging of the lesion(s) in question was required, which typically consisted of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
triple-phase contrasted computed tomography (CT) for
intrahepatic lesions and regular CT, with or without contrast, for non-liver lesions. The decision to undertake a
course of SBRT was made in a multidisciplinary fashion–
patients were presented with all treatment options prior to
making the choice to proceed with SBRT. No other specific criteria were used to select patients with cholangiocarcinoma for SBRT.
SBRT technique
Patients were immobilized using the Body-Fix wholebody immobilization system (Medical Intelligence,
Schwabmünchen, Germany). Axial CT planning images
were obtained on a General Electric (GE) Light Speed
RT 16-slice CT simulator (GE HealthCare, Fairfield, CT)
with four-dimensional (4D-CT) respiratory monitoring
via an infrared reflector placed on the patient’s chest
(Varian RPM, Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The patient’s respiratory pattern and CT data were linked at the time of
simulation and transferred to an Advantage virtual
simulation station (GE HealthCare) for tumor motion
evaluation and isocenter placement. Techniques such as
respiratory gating or abdominal compression were reserved
for patients whose 4D-CT images demonstrated >5 mm of
tumor respiratory motion.
Normal tissue and tumor segmentation was performed
on the Advantage workstation. In all cases, planning
imaging was fused with diagnostic imaging to aid in tumor
and normal tissue delineation. Gross tumor volume (GTV)
was considered to be identical to clinical target volume
(CTV). CTV was modified to create an internal target
volume (ITV), accounting for the movement of the
tumor in three dimensions using 4D-CT images. This
ITV was not generated solely by contouring on maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, but rather by
contouring on the binned image sets chosen from specific time points during the patient’s breathing cycle.
ITV contours were then reviewed by playing back the
entire 4D image loop to ensure that the entire tumor
volume was contained within the ITV contour at all
phases of the breathing cycle. The planning target volume (PTV) was typically created using a uniform 5 mm
expansion of the ITV in all dimensions. Normal tissues
at risk, including skin, spinal cord, stomach, small and
large bowel, duodenum, kidneys and liver were segmented. In some patients with liver tumors not readily visible on a non-contrasted CT scan, 2 to 6 small fiducials
were placed percutaneously using ultrasound guidance
around the tumor borders under local anesthesia by an
interventional radiologist. Image-guided radiotherapy was
accomplished with either cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) or stereoscopic kV imaging of fiducials.
Daily imaging was acquired prior to each treatment, a
match was performed, and the shift was applied. Any shift
greater than 0.3 cm required a second image acquisition
to verify position.
Patients were treated with either 3 or 5 fractions on
consecutive days, with efforts made to complete therapy
within a single week. The dose prescribed and number
of fractions delivered was at physician discretion and was
based upon target proximity to critical structures. Heterogeneity corrections were used in all cases. Both IMRT
and 3D-conformal SBRT treatment plans were designed
using Eclipse (Varian) treatment planning software. Often
when IMRT was used, a heterogenous dose distribution
was achieved by prescribing a higher dose to GTV relative
to the PTV, creating a cloud of increased dose around
the gross disease while facilitating the attainment of
constraints on normal tissues in the immediate vicinity.
Dose constraints used on organs at risk were somewhat
dependent on SBRT fractionation, but can be generalized
as follows: for bowel structures (stomach, duodenum, and
intestine), a maximum point dose of 32 Gy and a 10 cc
constraint of 20 Gy; for liver, at least 700 cc of normal liver
to receive less than 21 Gy; for kidney, at least 200 cc of
Barney et al. Radiation Oncology 2012, 7:67 Page 2 of 7
http://www.ro-journal.com/content/7/1/67

each kidney to receive less than 17.5 Gy; and for spinal
cord, a maximum dose of 20 Gy.
Toxicity and follow-up
Follow-up consisted of imaging of the treated area, a
clinical evaluation, and appropriate laboratory testing
2–3 months after completing SBRT. Follow-up thereafter
occurred at 3–6 month intervals with imaging studies.
Tumor treatment response was scored by a radiation oncologist using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 [17], and toxicity was scored using
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0.
Statistics
The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to define rates
of overall survival (OS), local control (LC), and freedom
from distant progression (FFDM). Distant failure was
defined as the development of new metastases or progression of untreated metastases. Survival and control times
were calculated from the end of SBRT.
Results
Patient and treatment characteristics
Baseline patient and disease characteristics for the 10
patients are available in Table 1. The median patient age
was 61.6 years (range, 51.4 to 87.0 years). The initial primary cholangiocarcinoma location was intrahepatic (n = 6)
or extrahepatic (n = 4). Three of the four extrahepatic
tumors were located in the perihilar region (Klatskin
tumor). Six of the 12 treated lesions (50%) consisted of
unresectable primary sites, and the other 6 lesions (50%)
were recurrent after initial surgery, either in the liver
(n = 5) or adrenal gland (n = 1). All primary site lesions
were biopsy-proven prior to SBRT, and all patients with
recurrent disease had, at minimal, imaging evidence of disease recurrence on PET-CT and/or MRI.
The median interval from the time of initial diagnosis to
SBRT was 2.3 years (range, 0–5 years). For patients who
had previously undergone surgical resection, the time
from surgery to disease recurrence treated with SBRT
was 3.7 years (range, 2–5 years). A total of 4 patients
had received systemic therapy at some point prior to
SBRT, and 4 patients also received systemic therapy after
completion of SBRT. One patient treated for a recurrent
liver metastasis had previously received adjuvant standard fractionation EBRT to the primary site and regional
lymph nodes after resection of an extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. No other patient had received previous
EBRT.
Treatment details, including site treated, prescribed
dose, and PTV volume and dose information is described
in Table 2. The median prescribed dose was 55 Gy in 5
fractions (range, 45–60 Gy in 3–5 fractions). All but 2
patients were treated in 5 fractions with total doses of 45,
50 or 60 Gy. The choice of dose was based on tumor
volume and proximity of dose limiting structures. The
median PTV volume was 79.1 cm3 (range, 16.0-412.4 cm3
).
Outcomes
Clinical outcomes, patterns of failure, and acute and late
toxicity for each patient are shown in Table 3. The median follow-up time in living patients was 14 months
(range, 2–26 months). At the time of this analysis, 4
patients were dead of disease, 2 patients were dead of
other causes, 2 patients were alive with disease, and 2
patients had no evidence of disease. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS at 6 and 12 months were 83% and 73%, respectively (Figure 1). No patient experienced an in-field
failure, but 4 patients treated to liver sites developed a
recurrence in a distant portion of the liver. By RECIST, a
complete response (CR) was seen in 3 lesions (25%), a
partial response (PR) in 5 lesions (42%), and stable disease (SD) in 4 lesions (33%). For those patients experiencing disease progression outside the SBRT field, the
median time from SBRT to progression was 6.1 months
(range 2–13 months). The 6- and 12-month KaplanMeier estimates of FFDM were 73% and 31%, respectively (Figure 2). The most common first sites of disease
progression included liver (n = 5), abdominal lymph nodes
(n = 4), and lungs (n = 1).
Toxicity
Acute toxicity was common but relatively mild, with no
acute Grade ≥3 toxicity reported (Table 3). Common acute
toxicities included nausea, fatigue, and abdominal pain.
Late toxicity was also common, with all but 4 patients experiencing late side effects. Abdominal pain was the most
common late toxicity but was mild in nature. Two patients
experienced serious late toxicities; one required placement
of biliary stent for Grade 3 biliary stenosis, and another

developed Grade 5 liver failure. The patient who developed biliary stenosis did so approximately 6 months
after SBRT. He was treated postoperatively to a dose of
50 Gy in 5 fractions for positive resection margins after
surgery for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. No dose
constraint was employed on the biliary tract, though
portions were contained within the high-dose volume.
He later developed other sites of metastasis in the liver.
The patient who developed Grade 5 liver failure had normal liver function and was Child-Pugh Class A at the time
of SBRT and in the immediate follow-up period; however,
she had received extensive systemic therapy previously,
both for the unresectable cholangiocarcinoma and for
metastatic breast cancer 15 years previously. She was

Discussion
In this small, preliminary report of prospectively-collected
data, we demonstrate excellent local control using SBRT
for unresectable or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma. Additionally, most patients tolerated treatment well and were
able to experience a significant interval free of active disease. A majority of patients in the study eventually progressed distantly or within other hepatic sites; however, one
patient is currently alive without evidence of disease nearly
2 years after SBRT, and another patient lived 20 months
without evidence of recurrence but died of liver failure.
This suggests that SBRT may impact patient survival in
addition to local control in appropriately selected patients.
Currently, the most common local treatment approach
utilized for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma is fractionated
EBRT +/− chemotherapy. A phase II trial of 128 patients
with unresectable intrahepatic malignancies treated with
concurrent hepatic artery floxuridine and high-dose radiation (median dose 60.75 Gy in 1.5-Gy fractions BID)
included 46 patients with cholangiocarcinoma [4]. The
median survival for all patients was 15.8 months, with an
actuarial 3-year survival of 17%. In that study, 13 of 36
patients (36%) with cholangiocarcinoma who were available for evaluation of treatment response experienced
in-field progression, while 15 others progressed in other
intrahepatic sites. Another single institution series reported
on 52 patients with unresectable extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiation over a
time period of 60 years [5]. Radiation doses and techniques
varied widely among the cohort of patients; however, the
first site of disease progression was local in 72% of cases,
and the median survival was 10 months. Although cholangiocarcinoma is not considered to be curable without surgery, these high rates of in-field progression with standard
EBRT +/− chemotherapy imply a more aggressive local
treatment approach may be beneficial in properly selected
patients.
Newer options showing promise as local therapy for
unresectable or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma include
TACE, RFA, and PDT [6-8]. A series of 49 patients with
unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with
TACE reported a median survival of 10 months from the
time of treatment [7]. The authors found that patients with
hypovascular tumors had inferior outcomes compared to
those with hypervascular tumors. Another interesting
finding was that median survival for tumors <8 cm was
37.2 months and 10.4 months for larger tumors, though
this difference was not statistically significant. RFA has
shown promise as an effective local therapy, particularly
for smaller tumors. For example, a study of 13 patients
with 17 primary intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas treated
with RFA reported a crude local control rate of 88% at a
median follow-up of 19.5 months. Two local failures occurred, both in tumors >5 cm in diameter. The median
overall survival after RFA was 38.5 months. PDT, which
involves the interaction of light with photosensitive agents
to produce an energy transfer and a local chemical effect,
has been tested in a number of small prospective studies
with mixed results. A recently-published article summarizes
the current medical literature for PDT for unresectable cholangiocarcinoma [8]. Additionally, a small prospective randomized controlled trial of 39 patients comparing PDT
after biliary stenting to stenting alone showed a statisticallysignificant survival benefit favoring PDT [18]. One of the
major drawbacks to each of these approaches is that they
typically involve an invasive procedure, a problem not
encountered with SBRT.
Other groups have reported results using SBRT for
cholangiocarcinoma, some of which are summarized in
Table 4 [12-16]. The largest current series includes 27
patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma treated

with SBRT [14]. The dose used on all patients in this
study was 45 Gy in 3 fractions, prescribed to isocenter.
While the authors do not comment specifically on LC,
they note median progression-free and overall survivals
of 6.7 and 10.6 months, respectively. Interestingly, they
found increased rates of duodenal/pyloric ulceration
(n = 6, 22%) and duodenal stenosis (n = 3, 11%) compared to other contemporary series, but they were not
able to establish a dose-volume relationship for bowel
injury. This increased reported rate of bowel injury may
be due to the fact that all but one tumor was hilar in location; therefore the high-dose volume was likely located in
closer proximity to small bowel. Additionally, the dose and
fractionation schema utilized by the Danish group was
more aggressive than that of other series. Yet the lack of
dose-volume relationship for toxicity implies other underlying and undiscovered factors may also contribute to
bowel injury. Other smaller series report one-year LC rates
of 65-77% using various dose and fractionation schemes
(Table 4). Median survival times vary greatly among these
series, likely reflecting patient selection bias. In spite of the
smaller patient numbers in the current series, our results
compare favorably with those from other institutions, as
no patient in our report has experienced a local failure
with a median follow-up of more than a year.
The excellent LC in this series of patients must be
balanced against potential toxicity, particularly in light of
the Grade 5 liver failure that occurred in one patient. Our
institutional liver constraint for 5-fraction liver SBRT,
which mirrors constraints provided by the American
Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task
Group 101 (TG101), is to keep ≥700 cm3 of normal liver
<21 Gy [19,20]. Constraints from the Quantitative Analyses of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC)
are slightly more stringent, with recommended mean liver
doses of <13 Gy for three-fraction SBRT and <18 Gy
for six-fraction SBRT, and ≥700 cm3 of normal liver to
receive ≤15 Gy [21]. In this patient with a liver volume
of 1980.4 cm3
, 1231.0 cm3 of normal liver received
<21 Gy and 1051.4 cm3 received <15 Gy, easily meeting
both our institutional constraint and the QUANTEC
recommendation. The mean liver dose was 19.3 Gy in five
fractions, which is slightly higher than the QUANTEC
recommendation of 18 Gy for six-fraction SBRT. We have
not routinely employed a mean liver dose constraint at
our institution when treating with SBRT as the mean dose
does not take the size of a patient’s liver into account.
Another factor that may have contributed to the patient’s
liver failure was her extensive history of previous systemic
therapy, which we did not consider during the treatment
planning process. This consisted of neoadjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) followed
by concurrent 5-FU and postoperative chest wall and
nodal irradiation at an outside institution for stage III
breast cancer 16 years prior to SBRT. A year later, the
patient developed recurrent disease and underwent
autologous bone marrow transplantation. This was followed by two years of tamoxifen therapy. The patient
was malignancy-free for 13 years, when a new increase
in liver function tests led to the work-up and diagnosis of unresectable, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
She received two doses of chemoembolization with
mitomycin-C and cisplatin, and then went on to receive
nine 28-day cycles of gemcitabine. She had not received
any systemic therapy within the previous 12 months of
SBRT, nor had she been previously treated with radiotherapy. SBRT was delivered to the previous site of chemoembolization, meaning the previously embolized volume was
not considered as part of the ≥700 cm3 dose constraint.
The patient was Child-Pugh Class A at the time of SBRT

though bilirubin, serum albumin, and international normalized ratio (INR) were never checked in the post-SBRT
period as she never developed symptoms or side effects of
liver failure until she presented at her local emergency department with signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We hypothesize that the patient’s previous
systemic therapy and transplant may have resulted in subclinical liver injury, and the additional radiation injury
from SBRT depleted what remained of the patient’s already
diminished hepatic reserve, enough to cause fulminant
liver failure. Indeed, altered liver function is a common
complication of stem cell transplantation, with complications ranging from increased liver function enzymes to
graft-versus-host disease, hepatic veno-occlusive disease,
and death due to liver failure [22]. Interestingly, at the time
of liver failure the patient had no evidence of active disease, neither cholangiocarcinoma nor breast cancer.
In summary, this study is a small single-institutional
report of patients with unresectable or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma treated with SBRT. With over a year of
follow-up, no patient experienced a local recurrence and
with one notable exception, the toxicity profile was otherwise acceptable. Although cholangiocarcinoma is a relatively
rare malignancy, these results need to be prospectively
validated in a larger study. With many other local therapy
options available, more information is needed to help physicians stratify patients to the treatments from which they
are most likely to benefit. Nonetheless, SBRT appears to
be a safe, effective, non-invasive treatment option for carefully selected patients who are unable to undergo surgical
resection or who experience an abdominal recurrence of
cholangiocarcinoma.
