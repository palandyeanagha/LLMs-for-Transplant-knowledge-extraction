Portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH) is defined as pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH) associated with portal hypertension and is a subset of Group 1 pulmonary
hypertension (PH). PoPH is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in patients
with portal hypertension with or without liver disease. Significant strides in elucidating the
pathogenesis, effective screening algorithms, accurate diagnoses, and treatment options
have been made in past 20 years. Survival of PoPH has remained poor compared to
IPAH and other forms of PAH. Recently, the first randomized controlled trial was done in
this patient population and showed promising results with PAH specific therapy. Despite
positive effects on hemodynamics and functional outcomes, it is unclear whether PAH
specific therapy has a beneficial effect on long term survival or transplant outcomes. In
this review, we will discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical and hemodynamic
characteristics of PoPH. Additionally, this review will highlight the lacunae in our current
management strategy, challenges faced and will provide direction to potentially useful
futuristic management strategies.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic progressive disease characterized by elevated
pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) eventually leading to
right heart failure and premature death. PAH associated with portal hypertension is called
portopulmonary hypertension (PoPH), and is a subset of Group 1 PH (1). Similar to other causes
of PAH, PoPH is characterized by the presence of intimal proliferation, medial hypertrophy,
adventitial fibrosis of the muscular arteries and plexiform arteriopathy, and is thought to be
histopathologically indistinguishable from other PAH phenotypes (2–4). Importantly, there does
not seem to be a link between the presence or severity of PoPH with the degree of underlying liver
dysfunction or hepatic venous pressure gradient (5, 6).
Patients with PoPH may be treated with PAH specific therapies, which may decrease the severity
of the disease, improve functional parameters and hemodynamics, and allow for liver transplant
(LT) (7). Despite a rapidly evolving understanding of PoPH, challenges remain in the diagnosis,
treatment and transplantation of patients with PoPH. In this review, we will discuss the latest
expert opinion in diagnosis and management of PoPH, as well as identify key areas of future
research focus.

DEMOGRAPHICS AND CLINICAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS WITH
PoPH
The exact prevalence of PoPH is difficult to determine. The
annual incidence of all types of PAH is <10 patients per
million population, and PoPH patients are a subset of this group
(8). PoPH was the third most common form of PAH in a
population-based epidemiologic study in France (9). Historically,
PoPH was thought to be 5–10% of all patients with PAH
(10, 11). More recently, French authors have reported that the
proportion of newly diagnosed (incident) patients with PoPH
is as high as 15% of all patients with PAH, and is continuing
to rise as wider screening practices are adopted (12). PoPH
is thought to be present in anywhere between 2 and 10% of
patients with portal hypertension (6, 13). Furthermore, while
the vast majority of cases of PoPH are in patients with portal
hypertension related to cirrhosis, non-cirrhotic causes of portal
hypertension (including portal vein thrombosis, granulomatous
disease, auto-immune disorders, drug reactions, infections, and
congenital abnormalities) are also important contributors (14,
15). McDonnell et al. showed a prevalence of histopathologic
changes of PAH of 0.61% in autopsies of patients with cirrhosis
(16), and small cohort studies have shown prevalence of PoPH
in patients with cirrhosis undergoing transplant evaluation to be
between 5 and 6% (17–19).
Although the hemodynamic profile of patients with PoPH
is better than in patients with idiopathic/familial PAH
(IPAH/HPAH), their overall mortality is similar or worse
(12, 20–22). The French Pulmonary Hypertension Registry
(FHPR) shows a 1, 3, and 5-years survival of 84, 69, and
51%, respectively, for patients with PoPH (12), which is
similar to the survival data for patients with IPAH, HPAH and
anorexigen associated PAH (23). In contrast, analysis of the
US based REVEAL registry showed that patients with PoPH
had significantly worse survival when compared to patients
with IPAH/FPAH: 67 vs. 85% at 2 years, and 40 vs. 64% at 5
years (Figure 1) (20). These findings were similar in the Spanish
REHAP registry, where the 5 year mortality was 49 and 69%,
for PoPH and IPAH/HPAH, respectively (Figure 2) (24, 25).
Furthermore, severe PoPH is associated with significantly
decreased survival in patients undergoing LT (7, 26), and severe
PoPH precludes liver transplantation and significantly affects the
course of hepatic failure in these patients (26, 27).
The lack of better outcomes in patients with PoPH as
compared to their IPAH/FPAH counterparts is not entirely
clear, especially in light of their relatively better hemodynamic
profile and functional status (20, 25). One possible explanation
is increased deaths from liver related events, which account for
25–33% of deaths in patients with PoPH, as compared to only
5% in patients with IPAH (22, 25). In patients with liver disease,
higher Child-Pugh Scores are associated with worse outcomes
(14, 22), which makes it clear that the severity of liver disease
(rather than PoPH) is the main factor in worse outcomes in this
population. Another possibility is a relative delay in PAH-specific
treatments within the PoPH cohort. PoPH patients started on
PAH-specific therapy live longer, despite worse hemodynamics,
when compared to PoPH patients not on therapy (25). However,
the percentage of PoPH patients on pulmonary vasodilators at
both time of enrollment and at 90-days post enrollment into the
REVEAL registry was significantly lower than their IPAH/FPAH
counterparts (20). The cause of this delay is likely multifactorial,
and includes milder symptoms, better hemodynamics, and lack
of definitive data to suggest the ideal agent in patients with PoPH.
Likewise, the difference in survival seen between different
PoPH cohorts are also likely due to a variety of factors,
which include differences in regional screening practices for the
presence of PoPH. Patients in the US and Spain with cirrhosis
are typically screened at time of liver transplant evaluation, which
likely skews the diagnosis of PoPH to patients with more severe
liver disease. In contrast, all patients with cirrhosis are screened
for PoPH in France, which likely leads to increased rates of
diagnosis of PoPH in patients with milder liver disease, which
in turn increases the overall survival rates. Rates of referrals of
patients to PH specific centers may differ by region (the REVEAL
registry included PAH patients treated in the community in
addition to academic PH-centers). There may also be differences
in baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in each respective
registry (including New York Heart Association Functional Class
[NYHA FC] and severity of underlying liver disease at the time of
enrollment). Additional prospective studies are needed as PoPHspecific management guidelines are established and standardized,
to see if this gap can be improved.
PATHOGENESIS OF PoPH
The underlying mechanisms for the development of PoPH
are poorly understood and continue to be an area of active
research. Liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension lead to
splanchnic vasodilatation and formation of portosystemic shunts,
which are thought to contribute to PoPH pathogenesis in
multiple ways (Figure 3). Mechanically, increased intrahepatic
resistance to flow from cirrhosis results in an increased portal
pressure gradient and portosystemic collateralization through
the reperfusion/dilation of preexisting vessels and through
the generation of new vessels (28). On a molecular level,
portosystemic shunting enables blood to bypass the liver, and
thus evade hepatic metabolism of vasoactive substances. This
direct reduction in the peripheral vascular resistance, combined
with indirect vasodilation via intestinal vasoactive substances that
are now able to bypass the liver and reach systemic circulation,
ultimately result in a hyperdynamic state. This phenomenon
has been seen in patients immediately after undergoing a
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement,
and persisted even a month out (29). Likewise, levels of vasoactive
substances acting in the pulmonary circulation (including
pulmonary vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin, as well
as pulmonary vasoconstrictors endothelin-1, thromboxane A2,
and serotonin), are similarly dysregulated in cirrhosis (30–32).
The imbalance of these vasoactive substances in the pulmonary
vasculature results in net vasoconstriction and pulmonary
vascular resistance elevation.

Shear stress from persistently high flows leads to endothelial
cell injury and the activation and repression of genes that
participate in the vascular remodeling process, and is believed
to play a role in various forms of PAH (33–35). Exposure of
and damage to the underlying arterial smooth muscle results in
smooth muscle proliferation and thickening of the tunica intima,
media, and adventitia within the pulmonary vasculature (4). The
arterial wall thickening, in turn, can result in more sluggish
pulmonary blood flow, platelet aggregation, and thrombus
formation, which can then become recanalized over time (3).
Autopsy data of patients with PoPH confirms that the end stage
of this process is medial and intimal thickening, plexiform lesions
and fibrotic venular obstruction (36). Together, these vascular
lesions result in permanently elevated PVR that distinguishes
PoPH from other causes of elevated mPAP in patients with portal
hypertension (Figure 5).
Signaling mediated by bone morphogenic protein receptor
2 (BMPR2), a member of the TGF-β superfamily, has been
shown to play a key role in familial pulmonary hypertension,
and mutations in the gene encoding this receptor have also
been found in 15–40% of idiopathic cases of PAH (37, 38).
Bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9) is a circulating factor
produced by hepatic stellate cells, which serves as a ligand for
BMPR2 signaling, and has been shown to have a protecting
effect against hepatic fibrosis (39). Recent studies have shown
that patients with PoPH have significantly lower circulating levels
of BMP9 as compared to control patients with advanced liver
disease and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension (40). BMP9

levels were likewise significantly lower in patients with PoPH
as compared to patients with other etiologies of group 1 PAH
(41). Moreover, selective enhancement of endothelial BMPR2
with exogenous BMP9 has been shown to reverse the presence
of PAH in multiple mouse models of PAH (42). Together, these
findings suggest that BMP9 and BMPR2 associated downstream
signaling pathways also likely play a role in the pathogenesis
of PoPH.
More recently, activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) by
bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from bacterial translocation
has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH. Mouse models
deficient in BMPR2 exposed LPS were shown to develop evidence
of pulmonary hypertension, which did not occur in their wildtype counterparts (43). The underlying mechanism for this is
thought to be rooted in increased IL-6 production and activation
of the STAT3 transcription factor, which is associated with
increased expression of TLR4 (43). TLR4 is the main receptor for
LPS and has been previously show to promote the development
of PAH (44–46). Together, these data suggest that exposure to
bacterial endotoxins, which occurs more frequently in cirrhotic
patients due to recurrent gut bacterial translocations, may
provide a “second hit” toward the development of PoPH in an
otherwise predisposed host.
Lastly, there is growing evidence that altered sex hormone
also contributes to the pathogenesis of PoPH. Estrogen binds
to the promoter region of the BMPR2 gene and regulates its
expression (47). Polymorphisms in CYP1B1 which metabolizes
estrogen were associated with penetrance of PAH in women
with BMPR2 mutations, but not men (48). Expression of
CYP1B1 has also been shown to be increased in experimental
models and human PAH (49). A candidate gene study to
identify genetic risk factors in PoPH found single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes coding for estrogen
receptor 1 and aromatase, a critical enzyme in the estrogen
metabolism (50). Recently, Al-Naamani et al. showed that
in PoPH patients, the risk allele rs7175922 in CYP19A1
was associated with significantly higher levels of estradiol,
urinary 2-hydroxyestrogen/16-α-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE/16αOHE1), plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and
plasma levels of 16-α-hydroxyestradiol (16α-OHE2) compared
to the patients with liver disease but no PoPH (51). 16α-OHE1

porto-systemic shunting resulting in an overall hyperdynamic state. Dysregulation of key regulator of pulmonary vascular tone associated with cirrhosis results in
pulmonary vasoconstriction. At the same time, damage to the pulmonary endothelium and the underlying smooth muscle results in permanent vascular remodeling,

to increase oxidative-stress related proliferation in pulmonary

Sahay et al. performed qualitative immunohistochemical (IHC)

small sample size, they did not find any significant difference
between the PoPH and cirrhotic livers, but aromatase expression
was increased compared to the normal liver (54). More research is

needed to explore the links between altered estrogen metabolism
and the development of PoPH in patients with liver disease.
SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF
PORTOPULMONARY HYPERTENSION
Screening for PoPH should begin with a detailed history
and physical exam (Figure 4). Common symptoms of PoPH
include unexplained dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, weakness,
orthopnea, near-syncope, syncope, palpitations, and chest pain,
with dyspnea being by far the most common. On physical exam,
these patients often have an accentuated pulmonic component of
the second heart sound (P2), a right sided S3, and a right sided
S4. Additionally, the presence of a tricuspid regurgitant murmur
or a pulmonic insufficiency murmur can be heard in 40% and
13% of patients, respectively (55). Other signs of right heart
failure, including jugular venous distention, ascites, and bilateral
lower extremity edema, may also be seen (56). Additional history
looking for other known World Health Organization (WHO)
Group 1 PAH risk factors should be taken. This includes use of
drugs such as methamphetamines, use of dietary supplements,
prior history of chemotherapy, and history of autoimmune
diseases. Clinicians should also review the medical history for
any other conditions known to be associated with PH, such as
left heart disease, chronic lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea,
venous thromboembolism, and hematologic disorders. If the
history and physical arouses any suspicion for PoPH, the patient
should undergo an echocardiogram.
Laboratory workup should include serological screening tests
for connective tissue diseases, hepatitis and HIV. Additional
evaluation with pulmonary function tests (including spirometry,
lung volumes, diffusion capacity, and a 6 min walk test) and
a CT scan of the chest should be obtained to screen for the
presence of significant lung disease, and to establish a baseline
which can then be used to track disease progression (11, 57).
A ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan should also be done to
screen for the presence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
hypertension (CTEPH) (especially in the setting of portal vein
thrombosis). See Table 1 for more symptoms, physical exam and
imaging findings.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the best screening
test for PoPH, as it is for other forms of PAH. All patients
with portal hypertension should be screened for PoPH with a
TTE. A list of the most common echocardiographic findings
that are seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension can be
seen in Table 1. Although traditionally used throughout the
literature to screen for the presence of pulmonary hypertension,
right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) calculations using
the simplified Bernoulli equation are prone to error, stemming
from the difficulty in accurately assessing a patient’s right
atrial pressure. In their analysis of echocardiographic screen of
patients undergoing liver transplant evaluation, Krowka et al.
demonstrated only moderate correlation between the RVSP and
the PA systolic pressures that were measured on right heart
catheterization (RHC) (19). Moreover, this discrepancy increased
with increasing values of RVSP. Likewise, cutoff values of RVSP
used for ruling out the presence of PoPH have differed between
studies, and the ideal threshold value for a positive screen has
been a matter of debate. As such, it has been suggested that the
use of RVSP should be replaced by continuous wave Doppler
measurements of peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity, with cutoff
values of 2.8 m·s
−1
for intermediate and 3.4 m·s
−1
for high
probability for the presence of PH (58). Issues with calculating
RVSP notwithstanding, current guidelines from the American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommend
evaluation with right heart catheterization in all patients being
considered for LT with an RVSP ≥45 mmHg on screening
echocardiogram (59). The International Liver Transplant Society
(ILTS) guidelines recommend a RHC in patients with RVSP >
50 mmHg and/or evidence of right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy
or dysfunction on TTE (60). Clinicians should understand that
when lower RVSP cutoffs are used, the sensitivity will approach
100%, but the specificity will decrease, resulting in a significant
number of false positives (17). However, given the high mortality
associated with severe PoPH and LT, performing an unnecessary
RHC is preferable to “missing” PoPH. In practice, all patients
in whom there are TTE findings suspicious for PoPH (elevated
RVSP or signs of RV dysfunction) should undergo RHC.

HEMODYNAMICS INTERPRETATION IN
PoPH
The diagnosis of PoPH includes hemodynamic evaluation of both
the pulmonary and hepatic circulations. Portal hypertension can
be challenging to diagnose non-invasively. Esophageal varices

and skin collaterals are suggestive of portal hypertension. On
ultrasound, decreased portal vein flow velocity, and portal vein
biphasic or flow reversal are suggestive of portal hypertension
(61). A hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) (wedge
hepatic vein pressure [WHVP]—free hepatic vein pressure
[FHVP]) of >5 mmHg is diagnostic of sinusoidal portal
hypertension (62).
On RHC, the patient must have both an elevated mPAP
and PVR and a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure
(PAWP) for a positive diagnosis of PoPH. During the
most recent World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension,
the hemodynamic criteria for the diagnosis of pre-capillary
pulmonary hypertension (which includes WHO Group 1)
were revised. With this change, patients with a mPAP
> 20 mmHg (previously > 25 mmHg), a PVR of ≥
3 Wood units (WU) (≥240 dynes), and a PAWP < 15
mmHg meet the diagnostic criteria for the presence of
PAH (1).
Careful evaluation of a patient’s hemodynamic profile
on RHC is crucial in order to distinguish PoPH from
other clinical conditions that are common in patients with
liver disease that can also result in elevated mPAPs. These
conditions can be classified into three broad categories:
hyperdynamic state, volume overload and true portopulmonary
hypertension (63). See Figure 5 for comparisons between these
hemodynamic profiles.
Patients with decompensated liver disease may present with
an elevated mPAP, PAWP, and PVR. This may be due to
a combination of volume overload, hyperdynamic state, and
PoPH (perhaps all three). Volume overload is managed with
careful diuresis, as patients with liver disease are prone to
kidney injury (64). A hyperdynamic state can be intrinsic
to liver disease, but may also be due to other treatable
medical comorbidities (such as anemia, arteriovenous shunts,
and hyperthyroidism) (65–67). This common clinical scenario
speaks to the challenge of diagnosing and treating PoPH, which
is best done at expert centers which are most familiar with these
complicated patients.
TREATMENT OF PoPH
The importance of screening for PoPH was established by
Krowka et al. in a retrospective review of case reports and case
series, which looked at the relationship between the presence
of untreated PoPH and cardiopulmonary related mortality in
patients undergoing LT (7). In this seminal work, Krowka et al.
examined 43 patients with PoPH (confirmed by RHC) who were
not on medical treatment and underwent LT. The patients were
grouped based on severity of pulmonary hypertension. Patients
with a mPAP between 25 and 35 mmHg were considered to
have mild disease, those with a mPAP between 35 and 50 mmHg
were considered moderate, and those with a mPAP >50 mmHg
were considered severe. In these groups, 100% of the patients
with severe and 50% of the patients with moderate PoPH died
due to cardiopulmonary related events (the majority died during
the transplantation hospitalization). No mortality was reported
among the patients with mild PoPH (mPAP < 35 mmHg). As a
result of this study, and others, routine screening for the presence
of pulmonary hypertension is now recommended in all patients
undergoing evaluation for LT.
After this landmark study established that PoPH patients with
higher mPAP are at high risk of mortality with LT, it prompted
the question of whether medical therapy could mitigate some
of those risks. Treatment of PoPH prior to or instead of
liver transplantation remains challenging and is fraught with
a paucity of data and large knowledge gaps. Randomized
controlled trials of pulmonary hypertension specific medical
therapies for patients with portopulmonary hypertension have
been limited by concerns regarding adverse hepatic effects of
PAH specific medications (68). We will review select clinical trials
of PAH-specific therapy in PoPH, as well as the indications and
contraindications for liver transplantation.

Thomas et al. Update on Portopulmonary Hypertension
Retrospective data on treatment of PoPH is quite
heterogenous, with some studies showing improvement in
hemodynamics and outcomes, and others showing no treatment
effect. There is higher quality data from prospective nonrandomized studies, from which a few themes emerge. A
recently published prospective cohort study from the French
Pulmonary Hypertension Registry (FPHR) examined data
on 637 patients with PoPH, 90% of whom were started
on PAH-specific therapies (12). These patients experienced
significant improved WHO functional class, 6-min walk
distance (6MWD) and hemodynamic parameters. The ANGEL
study is a recent single arm prospective trial of ambrisentan
in 31 patients with PoPH (69). This trial showed improved
hemodynamics (PVR, mPAP, cardiac index [CI]) and functional
class, but no change in 6MWD. From these prospective
studies, it is reasonable to conclude that PAH directed
therapy has favorable effects on hemodynamics and functional
outcomes, but the effects on mortality and candidacy for LT
are unclear.
As previously stated, the vast majority of randomized
controlled trials of PAH-specific therapies in PAH patients
have excluded patients with PoPH. One notable exception is
the PATENT-1 trial by Ghofrani et al. (phase 3, double-blind,
randomized controlled trial), which randomized 443 patients
with various etiologies of WHO group 1 PAH to receive either
placebo or two different doses of riociguat (70). This trial is
significant in that it included 13 patients with PoPH, 11 of
whom received the highest dose of study medication (2.5 mg
daily). The primary end point of the PATENT-1 trial was
6MWD, which was significantly improved in the riociguat 2.5 mg
group. Secondary hemodynamic (PVR, mPAP, and CO) and
functional (WHO functional class, Borg dyspnea scale and time
to clinical worsening) endpoints were also significantly improved
in the riociguat 2.5 mg daily group. The PATENT-2 trial was an
extension of the PATENT-1 study, in which all eligible patients
from the first study were given riociguat and followed for 2 years.
PATENT-2 showed sustained improvements in functional class
and 6MWD (71). A recently published subgroup analysis of the
13 patients with PoPH who were enrolled in PATENT-1 and 2
showed similar improvements in WHO functional class, 6MWD
and PVR (72). Importantly, riociguat was well-tolerated by the
PoPH patients.
The first ever randomized controlled trial of PAH specific
therapy in patients with PoPH was published in 2019. The
PORTICO study, which randomized 85 patients with PoPH to
receive either macitentan or placebo for 12 weeks, found that
the macitentan group had a 35% reduction in PVR, the primary
endpoint (73). While there were significant improvements in
some secondary endpoints (mPAP and CI), there were no
significant improvements in WHO functional class and 6MWD.
Importantly, macitentan was well-tolerated in this population,
with no hepatic side effects.
A notable limitation of PORTICO is that it excluded patients
with Child-Pugh class C liver disease and patients with a MELD
score of >19, which are groups with known poor survival (12).
It is still unclear whether this significant reduction in PVR
could translate into more meaningful outcomes for patients
(improved functional capacity, decreased mortality) or alter
candidacy for liver transplant. However, a recently published
post-hoc analysis of the PORTICO study found that patients
in the macitentan treatment group had significantly decreased
waitlist and perioperative mortality risk categories as compared
with the placebo arm (74).
Taken together, these studies show that PAH specific
therapies can improve hemodynamics and functional outcomes
in patients with PoPH. Importantly, these medications seem
to be well-tolerated in patients with liver disease and PoPH.
By extension, they can help patients become candidates for
LT and potentially live longer. In the absence of PoPH
specific treatment guidelines, clinicians should follow the general
treatment principles of PAH, with special attention to the
unique considerations for patients with PoPH. More research is
needed to elucidate the nuances of PAH specific therapies in the
PoPH population.
LIVER TRANSPLANTATION
As previously discussed, the severity of PoPH is an established
risk factor for liver transplant waitlist mortality (75) and poor
perioperative outcomes (7). As such, decisions about candidacy
for liver transplantation in patients with PoPH are complex and
best done by experienced centers.
The following general principles are recommended by the
AASLD (59) for management of patients with liver disease who
are being considered for LT. All patients who are undergoing
evaluation for LT should be screened for PoPH with transthoracic
echocardiography, and patients with RVSP > 45 mmHg should
be further evaluated by RHC. Patients with mPAP < 35 mmHg
do not require treatment with PAH specific therapies and can
proceed with further evaluation for LT. Patients with mPAP >
35 mmHg should be evaluated by an experienced PH specialist
and be considered for PAH specific therapy. If the mPAP can be
lowered to <35 mmHg and the PVR can be lowered to <5 WU
with medical therapy, LT can be pursued.
For some patients with mild liver disease and PoPH, their
higher risk for waitlist mortality is not accurately captured by
the MELD score (76). LT candidates with PoPH are eligible for
MELD exception points if the following criteria are met: initial
mPAP > 35 and PVR > 3 WU; patients are treated with PAH
specific therapy; and post-treatment mPAP is lowered to < 35
mmHg (76).
Giving MELD exception points to patients with PoPH is
controversial for a number of reasons. The U.S. based Organ
Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) requires a RHC
and resubmission of full hemodynamic data every 3 months (76)
to maintain the MELD exception points, which is burdensome
and often impractical for both patients and institutions. Despite
having to submit full hemodynamic data every 3 months, only
mPAP < 35 mmHg is used to maintain eligibility MELD
exception points. Some patients may achieve a lower PVR with
PAH directed therapy, but continue to have an elevated mPAP
from volume overload and/or a high flow state (60). In an
analysis of patients with PoPH on the LT waitlist, initial PVR

Thomas et al. Update on Portopulmonary Hypertension
was an independent predictor of waitlist mortality, while preand post-treatment mPAP were not (75). This suggests that a
broader hemodynamic picture should be used to maintain MELD
exception points eligibility.
In one analysis of 155 patients on the LT waitlist with
approved PoPH MELD exception points, less than half of the
patients actually met the standardized OPTN MELD exception
criteria. Furthermore, almost one third of patients in this study
lacked sufficient hemodynamic data to diagnose PoPH or had
hemodynamic data that was inconsistent with PoPH (77). These
researchers found that overall mortality was higher for patients
given PoPH MELD exception points (as compared to patients
listed without exception points), which shows the need for
more research into methods of risk stratification for patients
with PoPH.
In the era of the AASLD/ILTS guidelines and MELD exception
points, data on the natural course of PoPH after LT is limited. In
one retrospective cohort study, hemodynamics and survival data
for 35 patients with PoPH were examined (78). After LT, 6 month,
1 year, and 3 year survival rates were 80, 77, and 77%, respectively.
Of the 27/35 patients who survived more than 6 months after
LT, all were able to be weaned from intravenous epoprostenol.
Furthermore, most of the patients had improvement in their
hemodynamics after LT, with 30% having a mPAP < 25 mmHg at
last follow up. This data suggests that carefully selected patients
with PoPH who undergo LT will have significant improvement in
their hemodynamics.
CHALLENGES IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND
MANAGEMENT OF PoPH
There are a number of barriers to the effective diagnosis and
treatment of patients with PoPH. As previously discussed,
accurate diagnosis of PoPH is challenging, and the differential for
an elevated mPAP in the setting of liver disease is broad. There
is only one randomized controlled trial for PAH specific therapy
in patients with PoPH. Advanced liver disease symptoms have
significant overlap with the side effects of PAH specific therapies
(e.g., nausea, fatigue, and fluid overload), which can make the
initiation and maintenance of treatment challenging (67).
Many of the drugs used to treat PoPH are metabolized in
the liver, and drug metabolism is altered by liver disease and
other medications that patients may be taking (67). Additionally,
patients may have hepatic encephalopathy or lack the social
support needed to safely administer parenteral therapy or take
medications multiple times per day (67). More generally, many of
the treatment barriers that apply to all patients with PAH apply
to patients with PoPH: late referrals, lack of an expert center in
close proximity to where the patient lives, and insurance issues.
There is significant variability in the screening and management
practices of PoPH, discordance between published guidelines and
actual practice patterns, and disagreements about the role of LT
in PoPH (79).
CONCLUSIONS AND AREAS OF FUTURE
FOCUS
PoPH remains a challenging disease entity with many facets
in need of further research. More research is needed into
which types of PAH specific therapies will benefit patients
with varying severities of PoPH. The first randomized control
trial in PoPH was recently published, which showed that
macitentan significantly lowered PVR in patients with PoPH. It
unfortunately remains unclear if hemodynamics improvements
translate into successful LT or substantial survival benefit. While
it is clear that patients with severe disease have high mortality
with or without LT, their long-term response to treatment is
unknown. It is unknown if mild PoPH needs to be treated or
given MELD exception points, and the risk for progression to
more severe disease is unknown.
Pre-operative risk stratification of patients prior to LT remains
a challenge, as the traditional cut off of a mPAP of 35 mmHg is
somewhat arbitrary and is based on a small retrospective review
of case reports and series. There are no published guidelines
on initiation of PAH specific therapies in PoPH, or whether to
continue PoPH treatment post-LT. Finally, there is no centralized
national registry of PoPH patients who undergo LT; this would
serve as a foundation for focusing on the aforementioned areas
of need.
While there are indeed many barriers to and challenges
in caring for patients with PoPH, it remains a field with
many areas of active investigation. As the mechanisms
and treatment continue to be explored, we are confident
that care for these complex patients will continue
to improve.
