Abstract
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of diabetes; however, many clinical
conditions affect the HbA1c level, including anemia. And, the most common causes of anemia worldwide
include iron deficiency anemia (IDA). We performed a systematic search using different combinations of
MeSH words from the electronic database for the last 10 years (2011 to 2020). Articles included in the study
were observational, randomized controlled trial (RCT), and review/systematic review. A total of 18 articles
were included in the study. The majority of the studies showed the association between hemoglobin (Hb)
and HbA1c. Large-scale studies showed that the HbA1c level increases in IDA and some studies showed its
correction after the treatment with oral iron supplementation. Our study indicates the need for screening for
anemia in patients before commencing the treatment of diabetes diagnosed via the HbA1c level.
Furthermore, anemia should be corrected before setting the treatment goal of optimal HbA1c control,
especially when the level is in the diagnostic threshold. Also, the purpose of strict HbA1c control is not
recommended in the anemic patient before it is corrected. However, further large-scale interventional
studies are needed to know precisely the goal of optimal HbA1c control in diabetic and non-diabetic
individuals.

Introduction And Background
Anemia is defined as a reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and measured by the cut-off value
of Hb level <12.0 mg/dl in adult non-pregnant women and <13.0 mg/dl in adult men [1]. The prevalence of
anemia is 32.9% worldwide, and among many causes of anemia, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most
common cause [2].
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a clinical syndrome occurring due to an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin,
leading to abnormal carbohydrate metabolism. It is manifested clinically as hyperglycemia and is broadly
classified as Type I and Type II DM, of which >85% disease burden is due to Type II [3]. The diagnosis of DM
is made on the basis of fasting, two-hour postprandial, random blood sugar, and HbA1c. In euglycemic
person HbA1c is < 5.5%, impaired glucose tolerance 5.6%-6.5% and >6.5% is considered diabetic [4].
Hemolytic anemia leads to the reduced lifespan of red blood cells (RBC), and IDA prolongs it; as a result,
there occurs the discrepancy in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) [5]. HbA1c is the product of the non-enzymatic
chemical reaction of Hb with glucose. It reflects the average amount of blood glucose in the past two to
three months [6]. HbA1c is an important tool to assess glycaemic control, and its regular monitoring and
strict control reduce the onset and progression of wide varieties of diabetic-related complications [7].
Furthermore, HbA1c is one of the gold standard tests’ in the diagnosis of DM and monitoring of long-term
blood glucose levels [8], in anemia because these causes can lead to erroneous increase or decrease in HbA1c
leading to misinterpretation of the disease condition. So, the significance of Hb value in serial monitoring of
HbA1c and the cut-off value of Hb below which HbA1c cannot be considered as important diagnostic and
monitoring tools in diabetes is still a mystery [6].
There has been a controversy for the use of HbA1c as a diagnostic tool in anemia. As a result, we aim to find
the effect of anemia and the goal of optimal HbA1c control in diabetes and non-diabetes from the available
evidence.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All the articles relevant to the topic were searched in different databases. Only articles published in English
medium with full text between 2011 to 2020 and articles from all the geographical locations were included.
All types of studies were included except animal studies.
Result
The database searches identified 380 related articles out of which 316 articles were excluded based on title
and/or abstract, which were not relevant to our study. Out of the remaining 64 full-text articles, 46 were
excluded after further reading, and 18 articles were approved for the study. The main reason for exclusion
was incomplete data and/or not meeting the inclusion criteria. Included articles had at least one
measurement of HbA1c and hemoglobin by any method; however, this rule was not applied for the review
articles. No additional articles were identified via reviews of reference lists (Figure 1)

Discussion
Various studies have been conducted to gauze the relationship between anemia and HbA1c. More studies
were directed towards IDA. The effect of IDA on the HbA1c level was first studied by two American
researchers Horton and Huisman, in 1965 [9]. Ongoing studies have been done since then, which are out of
the scope of this review article and can be found in various journals. We have tried to review related articles
from 2011 to till date, which are depicted in Table 2 and Table 3.

TABLE 3: Review articles and their conclusions
HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c; IDA, iron deficiency anemia
In 2019, Solomon et al. showed mean Hb, hematocrit, and red cell indices were low as expected in the IDA
group [10]. His study revealed that this group had a much lower HbA1c level than the non-IDA group.
Therefore, monitoring the diabetic patient with only the HbA1c level should be done with caution. This
finding was consistent with an interventional study among 120 subjects by Kalairajan et al. in 2019 [11]. It
showed that IDA leads to a decrease in HbA1c level with a subsequent rise in HbA1c level with its correction.
This showed a positive correlation between Hb and HbA1c in IDA before treatment; however, no correlation
was observed after correction of anemia by oral iron supplementation for three months. The author in this
study acclaims that this was one of the few articles done in the Indian subcontinent where the cause of IDA
is nutritional. They also claim that the study was unique and encompasses a wide variety of race and ethnic
groups and people of low socio-economic status in that location.
These two studies were contradictory to other studies. As other studies have either failed to find the
association between two or the association was reversed. An observational study conducted by Alsayegh et
al. in 2017 showed a high prevalence of anemia in diabetes patients (female>male) predominantly more in
people with diabetes complications [12]. However, it showed no association between HbA1c and anemia in
both males and females. The author further added the need for early diagnosis and prompt treatment of
anemia in diabetes patients as it was associated with grave complications of diabetes. The previously
published study also supported this finding. The RCT by Villar et al. in patients with Type II diabetes and
chronic kidney disease divided the subjects into sub-normal Hb (110-129 g/L) and normal Hb (130-149 g/L)
were given iron and/or erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA) for correction of anemia for 6,12 18, 24
months and HbA1c did not vary significantly (P = 0.73) with correction of anemia [13]. This diversion from
the finding in the literature could be accredited to the type of anemia being non-IDA.
Ford et al. had a cross-sectional study of 8,296 patients and found a significant positive correlation between
Hb concentration and HbA1c concentration [14]. However, the HbA1c was found to be higher in IDA
patients, and HbA1c concentration in IDA patients was similar to non-IDA patients. This slight variation in
the finding can be attributed to the positive association between hemoglobin and HbA1c being counterbalanced by a negative association between HbA1c concentration and iron profile. Furthermore, the author
has warned that caution should be made in diagnosing diabetes in patients with anemia who are close to the
diagnostic threshold and need another method or retesting for diagnosis.
The majority of findings we observed were contradictory to the above findings. A study by Urrechaga in 2018
divided the Type II diabetes patient according to iron status as normal, latent iron deficiency (LID) and
IDA and the result showed a non-homogenous increase in the HbA1c values in both latent and apparent iron
deficiency anemia in both genders and the age groups above and below 50 years regardless of fasting plasma
glucose [15]. The finding of this study was comparable with the previous study by Shanthi et al. [22]. The
authors further recommend screening for IDA before commencing treatment in diabetes. Similarly, a study
conducted a year before by Madhu et al. in 122 patients also showed comparable findings [16]. Besides, it
also showed that in such subjects, the HbA1c level dropped after oral iron supplementation for three months
from 5.51+/-0.696 to post-treatment 5.044+/-0.603 with P-value <0.001. Seventy percent of IDA patients of
this study were prediabetic, who became euglycemic after iron therapy. This study has similar findings with
previous studies by Esfahani et al. [18]. Indirectly this study supports the suggestion of the large survey of
Ford et al. to take caution in diagnosing diabetes in IDA patients with threshold HbA1c [14].
Hong et al. have tried to find out the significance of HbA1c as a screening tool in diabetes and prediabetes
cases with IDA [20]. The author had compared no anemia, non-IDA, and IDA, and found HbA1c as 5.59+/-
0.01, 5.44+/-0.03, and 5.70+/-0.02, respectively (P<0.001). They have further added that the presence of IDA
affected the HbA1c distribution >=5.7% (the cut-off value for impaired glucose tolerance, IGT) and >=6.1%
Published via California Institute of
Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology

(Korean cut-off value for diabetes) but not in >=6.5% (WHO cut-off value for diabetes). So, IDA can
significantly increase in the HbA1c level in the people with prediabetic glycaemic status as well as in normal
glycaemic status but does not affect fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c level in diabetic people. This finding
again supports the finding by Ford et al. and Madhu et al. that the HbA1c level in the diagnostic threshold is
affected by IDA [14,16]. Similarly, a case-control study by Christy et al. was conducted in 2013 on 120
diabetic patients and found a positive correlation between HbA1c and IDA (6.8+/-1.4%), especially in women
(7.02+/-1.58%) [21]. The value of HbA1c was higher in patients with plasma fasting glucose 100-126 mg/dl
(7.33+/-1.55%) compared to euglycemic. However, there is a negative correlation between ferritin and
hemoglobin. So, the author suggests the correction of IDA in a patient with impaired glycaemic control.
Some studies tried to delineate the impact of Hb level on HbA1c. One such study conducted by Silva et al.
showed among 122 participants (67 with anemia, 67 without anemia) has found that the HbA1c level does
not vary significantly with the measuring technique (like high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
method and immunoturbidimetry method; P=0.192) [19]. Mild anemia has little impact on the HbA1c level,
whereas moderate to severe anemia can increase the level of HbA1c. Hence, in people with mild anemia,
HbA1c can be used as a diagnostic tool for diabetes. Others have tried to study the impact of IDA on the
HbA1c level in particular settings. A study conducted by Inada and Koga in 2017 compared the HbA1c level in
gastrectomized subjects with and without IDA [17]. HbA1c level showed a negative correlation with all the
indicators of iron deficiency like ferritin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and haemoglobin. Thus, the
HbA1c level is higher in gastrectomized subjects with IDA than non-IDA (P=0.003).
Guo et al. in 2019 highlights the need for further studies as there is no clear cut demarcation of effects of
IDA on HbA1c level; the cause being multifactorial and the effect being multidimensional [6]. Moreover, due
to the lack of standard calibration method to measure HbA1c, other confounding variables like IDA may lead
to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of diabetes. Also, a review by Naquash and Bader in his article mention
that the HbA1c level is dependent on erythrocyte turnover so, in the IDA, HbA1c level increased and in other
forms of anemia, HbA1c level is lowered [23]. Furthermore, other studies contradicted the finding. However,
the clinical data is insufficient, and further studies are mandatory in delineating the effect of erythrocyte
indices in the HbA1c level.
Similarly, a systematic review by English et al. in 2015 concludes that erythrocyte indices are essential
confounders in the analysis of HbA1c in patients with anemia and diabetes [7]. So, the author highlighted the
need for further study in this regard. In a review by Weykamp in 2013 [5], in anemia due to chronic disease,
HbA1c is low due to decreased RBC survival, but in IDA, it is spuriously high, which is assumed to be enticed
to altered glycation rate. A similar recommendation by Ahmad and Raft in 2013 suggested more research is
needed to know the mechanism by which Hb and HbA1c are related precisely [24]. Furthermore, the author
also recommends people who are in the diagnostic threshold to diagnose diabetes in anemia should have
another method of diagnostic modality to confirm the disease.
In a nutshell, most of the studies showed a relationship between anemia and the HbA1c level; however, it
fails to demonstrate the effect and the goal of optimal HbA1c control in diabetes and non-diabetes.
Study limitations
Data might not have been consistent as we included studies from all around the world. Also, we could not do
the systematic review and meta-analysis of all the articles which would strengthen our paper. Furthermore,
since we could review only the articles published in the English language, we might have missed the
valuable findings observed in the articles published in the local languages. Besides, we reviewed the articles
published since 2011 only which could have excluded the important conclusions from the articles published
earlier.
Conclusions
Our study indicates the need for screening for the anemia in patients before commencing the treatment of
diabetes diagnosed via the HbA1c level. Furthermore, anemia should be corrected before setting the
treatment goal of optimal HbA1c control, especially when the level is in the diagnostic threshold. Also, the
purpose of strict HbA1c control is not recommended in the anemic patient before it is corrected. However,
further large-scale interventional studies are needed to know precisely, the goal of optimal HbA1c control in
diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
