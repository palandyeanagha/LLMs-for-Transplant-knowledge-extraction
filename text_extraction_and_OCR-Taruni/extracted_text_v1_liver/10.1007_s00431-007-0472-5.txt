Abstract Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection occurs less
frequently in children than in adult patients, and the natural
history, prognosis, and clinical significance of HCV
infection in children are poorly defined. We report here a
descriptive follow-up of the clinical course, biochemical
data, and viral markers observed in 37 children with antiHCV. Ten patients included in the study tested persistently
negative for serum HCV-RNA (group 1) and 27 patients
tested persistently positive (group 2). In group 1, serum
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was normal in all patients,
while two patients had non-organ-specific autoantibodies.
In group 2, serum ALT was elevated in 13 of 27 patients,
and five patients had non-organ-specific autoantibodies.
HCV genotype 1a and 1b were the most prevalent among
HCV-RNA-positive patients. Twenty liver biopsies were
carried out on 17 patients in our series (mean evolution
time, 11.2 years; range, 3–21 years). The liver specimens
showed mild necroinflammatory changes in most patients,
and fibrosis was absent or low grade. Two HCV-RNApositive patients became persistently HCV-RNA negative.
Of the 26 children investigated, 7 (one in group 1, six in
group 2) had a co-infection with hepatitis G virus.
Conclusion Most children chronically infected with HCV
were asymptomatic and presented only mild biochemical
evidence of hepatic injury. Autoimmunity in the form of
non-organ-specific autoantibodies was common. HCV in
children induced mild changes in the liver with a low level
of fibrosis and at a low rate of progression.

Introduction
HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection occurs less frequently in
children than in adult patients. The natural history, prognosis
and clinical significance of HCV infection are poorly defined
in childhood [11]; in contrast, HCV infection in adults
presents a high degree of chronicity, with up to 50% of all
HCV-infected adults developing progressive liver disease
[21]. Results from prospective studies show that 20–30% of
chronically infected adults develop compensated and
eventually decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, or both, within 20 years of the initial infection [1].
The lower prevalence of HCV infection in children and
the fact that most patients undergo antiviral drugs treatment
result in very limited knowledge of the natural outcome of
chronic HCV infection acquired at early ages of life. Thus,
immediate goals in the investigation of HCV infection
should be to characterize current epidemiology and to
describe the pathogenesis and course of hepatitis C in
children and adults [20]. To understand the evolution of
HCV infection could be itself an important surrogate endpoint for the evaluation of infected young patients with
prognostic implications and therapeutical consequences.
The aim of this study was to determine the clinical
features and long-term evolution of HCV infection in a
group of children who had never received treatment with
antiviral drugs.
Patients and methods
Thirty-seven children (16 females, 21 males) with positive
antibodies to hepatitis C (anti-HCV) were investigated
retrospectively. These patients were followed-up for a
period of 5 years. None had received treatment with
antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis or had a history of
intravenous drug abuse. All subjects made regular visits to
our outpatient clinic, and the serum levels of alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, prothrombin time, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-mitochondrial antibodies
(AMA), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA), liverkidney anti-microsomal antibodies type I (LKM), antigastric parietal cells antibodies (GPCA), rheumatoid factor,
thyroxine (T4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), antithyroid antibodies, anti-HCV and HCV-RNA were determined at least on five consecutive occasions at 1-year
intervals. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen
(HBsAg), antibodies to HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs),
antibodies to HBV core antigen (Anti-HBc), human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and antibodies to hepatitis
E (anti-HEV) were investigated in all patients during one
visit. Hepatitis G virus-RNA (HGV-RNA) and antibodies to
HGV (anti-HGV) were determined in 26 patients. Genotypes of HCV were performed in 21 viremic children.
The duration of infection was calculated as the interval
between the presumed date of infection and the date of the last
visit to the clinic. Liver biopsies were obtained in 17 patients.
Repeated biopsies were performed in three patients.
Viral markers for HBV, HCV and HIV were tested by
third generation ELISA (Axsym; Abbott Diagnostics,
Chicago, Ill.). Anti-HEV was detected by a commercially
available ELISA (Bioelisa HEV IgG; Biokit, Barcelona,
Spain). HGV-RNA and anti-HEV antibodies were detected
using commercial tests (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany). HCV-RNA was detected by PCR (Amplicor
HCV PCR test, Roche Diagnostics), and HCV genotyping
was performed by a second generation line probe assay
(INNO-LIPA HCV; Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium).
Liver biopsies were performed percutaneously and under
the ultrasound guidance of an experienced operator. All liver
biopsy specimens (>12 mm long) were fixed in formalin,
embedded in paraffin stained with hematoxylin-eosin and
Masson’s trichrome and then observed by a single experienced
pathologist (AM). Histological necroinflammatory activity and
fibrosis were scored separately. The degree of histological
necrosis with inflammatory activity was scored using the three
parameters of the histological activity index (HAI) developed
by Knodell et al. [12]; these consist of: (1) piecemeal necrosis
and bridging necrosis (score: 0–10), (2) lobular cytolysis
(score: 0–4) and (3) portal inflammation (score: 0–4).
Fibrosis was scored independently using the following
system: F0, absence of fibrosis; F1, fibrous expansion of
portal areas; F2, portal to portal bridging fibrous tracts; F3,
portal-central bridging fibrous septa; F4, cirrhosis (bridging
fibrous septa with parenchymal nodules). This score is a
modification of the fibrosis scoring system of Knodell’s
method and introduces one additional degree of fibrosis.
Macrovesicular steatosis was graded semiquantitatively using
a modified score from Brunt et al. [5]. Alternative and
additional diagnoses identified in the liver biopsy were also
recorded.
Results
Mean chronological age for the 37 patients (21 males and
16 females) at the last follow-up evaluation was 20.1 years
(range: 9–30 years). Most of the subjects were diagnosed
among patients who were screened for HCV infection after
receiving transfusions of blood products for heart surgery,
hematological diseases or casual injuries before 1992. Thus,
most of the patients included in the study presented with
other diseases that were unrelated to HCV infection: 16
patients had a congenital heart disease, seven had various
hematological disorders, three had neurological diseases,
220 Eur J Pediatr (2008) 167:219–224

one had vesicoureteral reflux and one had Turner syndrome
associated to IgA deficiency.
Ten patients were anti-HCV-positive and HCV-RNAnegative (Group 1). The presence of HCV-RNA was
demonstrated in the other 27 patients (Group 2). Demographic characteristics and the main results obtained in
these children are shown in Table 1.
Group 1
The once-yearly PCR analysis revealed that ten patients had
positive anti-HCV and negative viremia, which reflected an
ongoing or past infection with HCV. These patients were
asymptomatic, and the liver function tests remained normal
in all but two who had been diagnosed with congestive
heart failure; the liver abnormalities of these two patients
were normalized after their cardiac condition had improved.
One female patient presented persistent positive AMA
for 3 years, which then normalized and remained negative
during the subsequent 9-year follow-up period. Throughout
this period the patient was asymptomatic, and liver tests
were normal. Two years after the laboratory tests were
negative for antibodies, the patient presented with psoriasis.
Another patient had persistent high titers (1:620) of antiLKM. Fifteen years after acquiring the infection this patient
lost the anti-HCV but the anti-LKM remained positive for
two more years. During the follow-up this patient did not
present liver abnormalities or other diseases.
During the follow-up span of this study, another female
patient became persistently anti-HCV negative 12 years
after she was infected. At the time of writing, eight patients
remain anti-HCV-positive and HCV-RNA-negative, and
they show no evidence of liver disorders.
Group 2
HCV-RNA was detectable in the blood of 27 patients, two of
whom became HCV-RNA-negative. The age of exposure to
the infection and the type of exposure could not be established
in one patient; following the detection of HCV in the blood
serum, this patient was followed for 11 years and was positive
for HCV up to and including the last follow-up visit.
All patients, with one exception, were asymptomatic. The
exception had been diagnosed with leukemia in 1987 and
received transfusions of blood products on several occasions.
She underwent chemotherapy and had a cholestatic hepatitis;
liver tests revealed persistent abnormalities. Anti-HCV and
HCV-RNAwere detected in 1991. The patient presented portal
hypertension and progressive liver failure, and when she was
8 years old, in 1993, she received a liver transplant.
The evolution of serum ALT levels is shown in Table 1.
Serum levels of albumin and prothrombin time were
abnormal only in the patient who developed hepatic failure.
The presence of non-organ-specific autoantibodies
(NOSAs) was detected in five patients. One patient
(genotype1a) diagnosed with a single ventricle and Fontan
surgery developed persistent anti-LKM (titers 1:160–1:620)
and the rheumatoid factor throughout the evolution of the
disease. Liver biopsy could not be obtained in this patient.
Another male patient (genotype 1b) had positive ANA for
2 years, which subsequently normalized. This patient had
increased ALT, and the liver biopsy showed minimal
necrosis with inflammatory changes (HAI: 2) and no
fibrosis. A third patient (genotype 1b) had persistent PGCA
during her follow-up period (10 years), with slightly
elevated ALT levels, mild necrosis with inflammatory
changes (HAI: 4) and minimal fibrosis (stage 1). A fourth
patient (genotype1b) with AST levels greater than fourfold
the upper normal level presented SMA during the last
2 years of her follow-up (HAI: 6). The patient diagnosed

with Turner syndrome and IgA deficiency (genotype 1b)
developed throughout the years a seronegative poli-articular
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and celiac disease. She had
intermittently positive ANA.
The levels of T4 and TSH were normal in all patients,
and no patient developed antithyroid antibodies.
Abdominal ultrasounds did not show significant abnormalities. Only the patient who presented cirrhosis had
changes associated to portal hypertension.
Liver biopsies were performed in viremic patients who
presented altered hepatic function tests and for whom
parental consent had been obtained. Seventeen patients
underwent 20 liver biopsies. Mean evolution time of the
infection at the time of biopsy was established in 16 patients
(mean: 11.2 years; range: 3–21 years). The results on
necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis are shown in Table 2.
A second hepatic biopsy was performed in three patients
after 5, 12 and 14 years, respectively. The minimal necroinflammatory activity observed in the first biopsy specimens of
these three children remained unchanged in the second biopsy.
One of the patients progressed from F0 to F1 fibrosis. A
second patient never presented with fibrosis, and both samples
of the third patient had minimal fibrosis (F1).
During the follow-up period, 2/27 patients became
persistently HCV-RNA-negative (for 9 and 10 years,
respectively). Both patients showed minimal necrosis and
inflammatory activity with minimal fibrosis (F1) in the
biopsy performed before HCV-RNA clearance. One patient
of Group 1 was HIV-positive, while one patient of Group 1
and six patients of Group 2 were HGV-positive.
Viral coinfections observed in both groups are expressed
in Table 1.
Discussion
In this study, chronic hepatitis C infection was silent in
most of the children, and there was little biochemical
evidence of liver disease in these patients. Only one girl
with portal hypertension and liver failure developed
symptoms related to the infection. Consequently, our data
suggest that HCV infection may be currently underdiagnosed in children and, moreover, that young patients could
become a potential source of infection. We therefore
strongly recommend that children falling in risk groups be
screened for HCV infection.
Of the 37 pediatric patients in this series, seven (19%)
had NOSAs. These antibodies are highly prevalent in
subjects exposed to the HCV, and a positive test result for
SMA, GPCA and ANA is part of the natural course of
chronic HCV infection in adults and children [7]. Lenzi et
al. [13] reported a higher prevalence of NOSAs in antiHCV-positive adult patients than in normal controls (25 vs.
6%). Stroffolini et al. [22] found positive NOSAs in 36.9%
of 502 subjects with HCV-RNA-positive chronic hepatitis.
Muratori et al. [16] detected positive NOSAs in 16 of 47
children (34%) with chronic hepatitis C, and anti-LKM was
present in 11% of the children.
Of the 37 children participating in our study who
manifested past or active HCV infection, two had serum antiLKM. This incidence is lower than that observed by Muratori
et al. (11%) [16] and Bortolotti et al. (10.3%) [4] in children

with HCV infection. A possible explanation for this finding is
the higher age and longer mean duration of HCV infection in
the patients included in our series in comparison to the
children in the other two studies. The prevalence reported by
Lenzi et al. (1.3% [13]), Stroffolini et al. (2.25% [22]) and
Reddy et al. (0% [18]) in adults support this hypothesis. AntiLKM is an immunomarker of type 2 autoimmune hepatitis
[2] that tends to present at younger ages and to affect mainly
children. Our data suggest that age may be a factor
contributing to the presence of anti-LKM1 in children
infected with HCV. Moreover, we observed that one of our
non-viremic patients had persistent antibodies after the test
for anti-HCV became negative.
Liver specimens from the children with hepatitis C showed
mild necroinflammatory changes and a low level of fibrosis.
In most patients, fibrosis was absent or low grade. Only one
patient, as mentioned above, developed cirrhosis and liver
failure over a period of 6 years. This leukemic patient had
other additional risk factors for liver damage that may have
affected this outcome. In this respect, Hoshiyama et al. [9]
observed that chronic hepatitis C is more frequent among
children with hepatitis C infection following blood transfusions for malignant disease than in patients with hepatitis
C following blood transfusions for open heart surgery.
We have compared our results with those obtained from
other pediatric series [6, 8, 9, 23]. Table 3 summarizes the
data on fibrosis obtained from liver biopsies of 210
pediatric patients (above-mentioned studies). Fibrosis was
not detected or was low grade in 200 patients (95%), and
severe fibrosis or cirrhosis was detected in ten patients
(5%). Minola et al. [15] and Poynard et al. [17]
demonstrated an inverse correlation between age at HCV
infection and progression to cirrhosis that suggests that
chronic HCV infection in childhood induces mild changes
in the liver with a low level of fibrosis and a low rate of
progression. However, it has been observed that mild
chronic hepatitis C can be a progressive disease in adult
patients [3, 19] and that the long evolution of infection
acquired in childhood could increase the risk of fibrosis.
Thus, some children infected early in life, in whom chronic
disease has a mild liver expression, might develop fibrosis
in adulthood.
It is noteworthy that 6/27 of the children with HCV
infection in our series had a co-infection with HGV (HGVRNA-positive) or had a past HGV infection (antiHGV-positive). This prevalence of HGV infection is higher
than that found in healthy children (6%) in Spain [10].
These data suggest that HCV-infected children must be
considered to be a risk group for HGV infection since HCV
and HGV are both parenterally transmitted. Moreover, no
differences were observed in biochemical and histological
findings in HCV-infected children with and without a
concomitant infection with HGV, which suggests that
superimposed HGV infection does not influence the course
of HCV infection.
Conversely, our data do not support that HEV, which can
be transmitted by a parenteral route [24], is prevalent in
children who had undergone blood transfusions (prevalence
rate: 0%). However, this low value may result from the low
prevalence of HEV infection in Spain (2.8%) [14].
Conclusion
Most children chronically infected with HCV are asymptomatic and present only mild biochemical evidence of
hepatic injury. Spontaneous clearing of the virus occurs
occasionally. Autoantibodies are common in HCV patients.
The natural history of chronic hepatitis C in children differs
from that in adults since HCV infection is relatively benign,
induces mild changes in the liver with a low level of
fibrosis and a low rate of progression and is rarely
associated with severe or decompensate liver disease.
