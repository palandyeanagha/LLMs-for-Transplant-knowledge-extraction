Background: The frequency of normal and aberrant hepatic arteries differs among 
ethnicities. The aim of our work was to study the frequency of normal and aberrant hepatic arteries among Egyptians using multidetector computed tomography 
(MDCT) and to compare our prevalence with the prevalence of other nationalities. 
In addition, the gender differences of such variations were clarified. Moreover, the 
arterial feeding of hepatic segment IV was determined.
Materials and methods: The present study was carried out on 500 patients 
(409 males and 91 females). Abdominal CT was performed using two MDCT systems, 
a 64-row, and a 256-slice system. 
Results: According to Michel’s classification, the normal anatomy (type I) was observed in 369 (73.8%) cases, while anomalous hepatic arterial pattern was detected in 
131 (26.2%) cases. These anomalies were distributed as follows: type II in 36 (7.2%) 
cases, type III in 60 (12%) cases, types IV and V in 5 cases for each (1% each), type VI 
in 14 (2.8%) and types VIII and IX in a single case for each (0.2% each). Neither 
type VII nor type X was detected. Nine (1.8%) unclassified cases were observed. 
According to Hiaat’s classification, the anomalies were distributed as follows: type II 
in 41 (8.2%) cases, type III in 74 (14.8%) cases, type IV in 6 (1.2%) cases, type V in 
a single case (0.2%) and type VI in 2 (0.4%) cases. Finally, 7 (1.4%) unclassified cases 
were observed. Common hepatic artery (CHA) originated from coeliac trunk in 98% 
(79.8% males and 18.2% females). It originated from the abdominal aorta in 0.4% 
and from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in 0.4%. It was absent in 1.2%. Right 
hepatic artery (RHA) originated from the CHA in 86.6% (69.8% males and 16.8% 
females) and from the SMA in 13.2% (11.8% males and 1.4% females) and from the 
abdominal aorta in 0.2% (a single male case). Left hepatic artery (LHA) originated 
from the CHA in 91.2% and from the left gastric artery (LGA) in 8.8%. The most 
common origin of the segment IV blood supply was the LHA in 60.8%, followed 
by the RHA in 35%. Less commonly, blood supply derived from the hepatic artery 
proper (HAP) in 1%. Combined supply derived from RHA and LHA in 0.8%, from the 
LHA and HAP in 2% and the least encountered was from the RHA and HAP in 0.4%.
Conclusions: Hepatic artery variations among Egyptians have a different distribution 
when compared to such variations among other species. The normal hepatic arterial 
pattern was observed in 73.8%, while the anomalous was detected in 26.2%. The 
CHA originated from the coeliac trunk in 98%, the RHA originated from the CHA in 
86.6% and the LHA originated from the CHA in 91.2%. The most common arterial 
supply of the hepatic segment IV is derived from the LHA (60.2%). (Folia Morphol

INTRODUCTION
Knowledge of hepatic vasculature variants is mandatory in laparoscopic surgery, liver transplants, radiological abdominal interventions and penetrating 
abdominal injuries [16]. Lack of familiarity with such 
variants can result in insufficient management and 
predispose patients to inadvertent injury during open 
surgical procedures or percutaneous intervention [7].
Normally (12–49%), the liver receives its total inflow from the hepatic branch of coeliac trunk [4]. 
Aberrant hepatic artery refers to a branch that does 
not arise from coeliac trunk. There are two types of 
aberrant hepatic artery: accessory and replaced [6]. 
The accessory hepatic artery is applied when the normal coeliac right hepatic artery (RHA) or left hepatic 
artery (LHA) is present and there is an additional artery from other sources. The replaced hepatic artery 
is applied when the normal coeliac RHA or LHA is 
missing and the replacing artery comes from another 
source and provides the sole supply to that lobe [6]. 
Aberrant hepatic arteries can be of major surgical significance in the laparoscopic procedures and 
operations of gallbladder, liver, upper intestinal tract, 
and pancreas [19]. Such aberrant arteries can develop a technical problem for infusion treatment 
and trans-arterial chemoembolisation of neoplasms 
[19]. Aberrant LHA lies in the hepatogastric ligament 
and is prone to laceration or ligation causing fatal 
ischaemic necrosis of left lobe of the liver [1]. In addition, accessory left gastric artery (LGA) arising from 
aberrant LHA affects the diagnosis and treatment of 
proximal gastric and distal oesophageal and hand in 
intra-arterial infusion of chemotherapeutic agents for 
hepatic neoplasms [17]. Aberrant RHA leads to alteration in the surgical approach and adversely affects 
the surgical outcome. Injury to aberrant RHA leads 
to intra- or postoperative bleeding and ischaemia of 
right lobe of liver [20].
Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) 
angiography is accurate, and reliable in the evaluation of the hepatic artery configuration [22]. It allows 
faster volume imaging of the whole liver with thinner 
slices in high spatial resolution within one breath-hold 
period, when compared with the CT devices with 
a single detector row [23].
Recognition of the origin of the artery of segment IV 
is important for donor evaluation for living donor 
liver transplantation and for the split liver transplantation [12].
We hypothesized that the frequency of normal 
and aberrant hepatic arteries differs among ethnicities. So, the aim of our work was to study the 
frequency of normal and aberrant hepatic arteries 
among Egyptians using MDCT and to compare our 
prevalence with the prevalence of other nationalities. 
In addition, the gender differenced were elucidated. 
Finally, the arterial feeding of hepatic segment IV 
was determined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present study was carried out on 500 patients 
(409 males and 91 females). The mean ± standard 
deviation of their ages was 54.06 ± 11.6 years. The 
studied patients were referred to the Radiology Department of Cairo University Hospital and underwent 
abdominal dynamic enhanced MDCT. The data were 
obtained during the arterial phase. 
Exclusion criteria were impaired renal function 
(creatinine > 1.2 mg/dL), allergy to iodinated contrast 
media, previous hepatic or major abdominal surgery 
and all pathological conditions that may modify the 
vascular anatomy (i.e. parasitic flow in hepatocellular 
carcinoma) [4].
Permission from the ethics committee was not 
requested as CT studies followed routine imaging 
protocols, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All procedures were carried 
out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 
1975, revised 2013.
Abdominal CT was performed using two MDCT 
systems, a 64-row, and a 256-slice system. MDCT 
coverage extended from the dome of the diaphragm 
to the inferior margin of the right kidney. Configurations of MDCT system: detector configurations 
of 64 × 0.625 mm or 256 × 0.5 mm, respectively; 
section thicknesses of 0.625 or 0.5 mm, respectively; 
reconstruction intervals of 0.625 or 0.5 mm, respectively; and table speeds of 64 or 256 mm per rotation, 
respectively. 
Dynamic enhanced MDCT images were obtained 
in a craniocaudal direction during the hepatic arterial, 
portal venous and equilibrium phases. A dual-head 
power injector was used to administer a flush of 
Iopromide (Ultravist; Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, 
Germany) at 370 mg iodine/mL and 30 mL sterile saline 
(0.9% NaCl). The contrast medium and saline solution 
were injected at 4 mL/s through an 18-gauge plastic 
intravenous catheter placed in an antecubital vein.

S.M. Zaki et al., Hepatic artery variations
Hepatic arterial phase imaging delays were 
11–20 s after descending aorta enhancement to 
150 HU, as measured by an automatic bolus-tracking technique, and portal venous phase inter-imaging 
delays were 20–30 s after the aortic enhancement. 
Equilibrium phase images were acquired 180 s after 
completion of the contrast medium administration.
For the purposes of this study, only the data obtained during the arterial phase were downloaded onto an off-line workstation (ADW 4.3; General 
Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) for image 
post-processing and analysis. We used multiplanar 
reformation in three spatial planes and three-dimensional reformation using volume rendering and maximum intensity projection. Images were reformatted, 
analysed and assessed with respect to origination 
sites and the anatomy of the coeliac axis and their 
major branches. The anatomies of the coeliac trunk 
and hepatic arterial system were analysed individually, 
and anatomical variations recorded. We analysed 
patterns of aortic origin for the four major arteries: 
LGA, common hepatic artery (CHA), splenic artery 
and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) with adherence 
to our modified definition of coeliac axis and Song’s 
definition of CHA, whereby CHA is defined as an 
arterial trunk containing gastroduodenal artery and 
at least one segmental hepatic artery, irrespective of 
its origin and anatomic course [28].
The anatomical variations of hepatic arterial system were defined according to Michel’s [28] and 
Hiatt’s classifications [6] (Table 1). 
Statistical analysis
The data obtained from the radiological and anatomical studies were recorded and analysed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics version 21 (SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, IL). Qualitative data were expressed 
as frequency and percentage of normal and aberrant hepatic arteries. The gender differences in such 
variations were clarified using the χ2 test. A p-value 
< 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS 
According to Michel’s classification, the normal 
anatomy (type I) was observed in 369 (73.8%) cases, 
while the anomalous hepatic arterial pattern was 
detected in 131 (26.2%) cases. The anomalies were 
distributed as follows: type II in 36 (7.2%) cases, 
type III in 60 (12%) cases, types IV and V in 5 cases 
for each (1% each), type VI in 14 (2.8%) cases and 
types VIII and IX in a single case for each (0.2% each). 
Neither type VII nor type X was detected. Nine (1.8%) 
unclassified cases were observed (Table 2, Fig. 1). 
According to Hiaat’s classification, the anomalies 
were distributed as follows: type II in 41 (8.2%) cases, type III in 74 (14.8%) cases, type IV in 6 (1.2%) 
cases, type V in a single (0.2%) case and type VI in 
2 (0.4%) cases. Finally, 7 (1.4%) unclassified cases 
were observed (Table 2).
According to Michel’s classification, the unclassified cases were CHA from the aorta, the CHA 
from the superior mesenteric with the LHA from the 
coeliac trunk, the RHA from the aorta, the accessory 
right hepatic from the aorta, absent coeliac trunk 
(Fig. 2).
The anatomical variation of the origin of the CHA 
showed normal origin from the coeliac trunk in 98% 
(79.8% males and 18.2% females). It originated from 
the abdominal aorta in 0.4% and from the SMA in 
0.4%. It was absent in 1.2% of the cases. The anatomical variation of the origin of the RHA was normal 
origin from CHA in 86.6% (69.8% were males and

16.8 % were females), while it originated from SMA 
in 13.2% (11.8% were males and 1.4% were females) 
and from abdominal aorta in 0.2% (a single male 
case). The anatomical variation of the origin of the 
LHA was the normal origin from the CHA in 91.2%, 
while it originated from the LGA in 8.8% (Table 3, 
Figs. 1, 2).
The most common arterial supply of the hepatic 
segment IV is derived from the LHA (60.2%), followed by the RHA in 35%. Less commonly, blood 
supply derived from hepatic artery proper (HAP) in 
1%. Combined blood supply derived from the LHA 
and RHA in 0.8%, from the LHA and HAP in 2% and 
the least encountered was from the RHA and HAP in 
0.4% (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
A comparison with other angiographic studies 
based on Michel’s classification [3, 4, 10, 14, 19, 21, 
22, 26] and Hiatt’s classification [6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 
25, 29] was exhibited in Table 5. Our study showed 
a higher percentage of normal hepatic artery anatomy 
(73.8%) compared to that of Michel’s study (55%) 
[28]. Most of the radiological investigations displayed 
percentages near to that found in our study. The

anatomical variations in our study were low (26.2%) 
compared to the variations reported by Michel’s 
(45%), Saba’s (38.63%) and De Cecco’s (34%) [4, 
22, 28]. Many researchers exhibited percentages like 
that found in our study (Table 5).
The most common anatomical variants observed 
in our study was the replaced RHA arising from SMA 
(Michel’s type III). It constituted 12% of our studied 
cases which was in accordance with the findings of 
Michel (11%), Rygaard (13.4%), De Cecco et al. (9.2%), 
Saba and Mallarini (10.56%) [4, 21, 22, 28]. A low 
percentage of this variation was found in the studies 
of Daly et al. (6%) [3], Chen et al. (5.2%) [2], Stemmler 
et al. (6.3%) [26]. The replaced RHA is a beneficial 
variant in right hepatic lobe living donors transplant, 
as the common postoperative complication in liver 
transplantation is hepatic artery thrombosis because 
of shorter and thinner hepatic artery graft. However, 
the replaced RHA in such cases provides a longer and 
larger graft, thus reducing chances of hepatic artery 
thrombosis [13].

The second most frequent variation in our study was 
the replaced LHA arising from the LGA (Michel’s type II). 
It constituted 7.2% of the studied cases which was in 
accordance with the findings of Michel (10%) [22], 
Chen et al. (7.8%) [2], Saba and Mallarini (7.48%) [22]. 
A low percentage of this variation was found in the 
studies of Daly et al.,1984 (6%) [3], Rygaard et al., 1986 
(4.6%) [21], De Cecco et al., 2009 (5.2%) [4], Koops et 
al., 2004 (2.5%) [10]. Stemmler et al., 2004 [26] reported absence of such variant in their study. Type II and III 
variants are suitable for the operation, owing to the 
longer replaced right or left hepatic arteries allowing 
the surgeon to perform safer anastomosis [17].
The existence of replaced RHA and LHA (Michel’s 
type IV) constituted about (1%) of the studied cases. 
Most of the radiological investigations displayed percentages like that. Rygaard et al. [21] and Stemmler 
et al. [26] reported absence of such variant in their 
studies.
Great difference was observed in the number of 
accessory hepatic arteries detected (Michel’s types V 
and VI), with low prevalence in most studies including 
our study. This difference might be due to the small 
size of the accessory branches, resulting in the general 
underestimation of these arteries on angiography [10]. 
Rygaard et al. [21] reported absence of such variants 
in their study.
The prevalence of the rare unclassified Michel’s or 
Hiatt’s anomalies in our study does not differ from 
those reported in other publications. We observed five 
variants that are not included in Michel’s scheme; CHA 
from aorta, CHA from superior mesenteric and left 
hepatic from coeliac trunk, RHA from aorta, accessory 
right hepatic from aorta, absent coeliac trunk. 
Common hepatic artery originated directly from 
the abdominal aorta in 0.4% of the studied cases. 
Chen et al., 1998 [2] and Sureka et al., 2013 [27] reported such variant in 0.5% and 0.33%, respectively.

S.M. Zaki et al., Hepatic artery variations
Other researchers found a higher percentage in their 
studies (1.7%, 1.35%, respectively) [5, 24]. Right and 
left hepatic arteries originated from the coeliac trunk 
directly in 0.2% of our cases. Sureka et al., 2013 [27] 
reported a higher incidence (1%). Right hepatic artery 
originated directly from the aorta in 0.2% of our cases. Iezzi et al., 2008 [8], Ugurel et al., 2010 [30] and 
Sureka et al., 2013 [27] reported variable percentage 
of this variant (0.2%, 0.3%, 1%).
Recognition of the origin of the artery of 
segment IV is important for donor evaluation for 
living donor liver transplantation and for the split 
liver transplantation [12]. Left hepatic artery feeding 
segment IV occurred in 60.2% of our cases vs. 53% 
of Lee’s and 55.1% in Saba’s studies. Right hepatic 
artery feeding segment IV occurred in 35% of our 
studied cases vs. 39% of Lee’s and (31.25%) in Saba’s 
studies. Finally, double blood supply from left and 
right hepatic arteries was found in 0.8% while it was 
2% in Lee’s and 6.3% in Saba’s studies [11, 22]. The 
latter authors also reported triple blood supply from 
CHA, LHA, and RHA in 0.6% which was not found in 
our study. If segment IV artery originates from the 
RHA, the RHA should be clamped after it gives off the 
segment IV artery [15]. In right lobe transplantation, 
if the right hepatic arterial origin of the segment IV 
artery is not detected prior to the surgery and the 
RHA is clamped as it takes off from the HAP, the left 
lobe medial segment that remains in the donor will 
develop ischaemia [15].
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, hepatic artery variations among 
Egyptians have a different distribution when compared to such variations among other species. The 
normal hepatic arterial pattern was observed in 
73.8%, while the anomalous one was detected in 
26.2%. The CHA originated from the coeliac trunk in 
98%, the RHA originated from the CHA in 86.6% and 
the LHA originated from the CHA in 91.2%. The most 
common arterial supply of the hepatic segment IV is 
derived from the LHA (60.2%).
