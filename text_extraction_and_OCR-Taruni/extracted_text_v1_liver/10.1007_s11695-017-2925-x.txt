Abstract
Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) occurs in up to 80% of patients with obesity. Current data suggest an improvement of NAFLD after established bariatric
procedures.
Objectives This study investigated liver function impairment
after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and one-anastomosis
gastric bypass (OAGB).
Setting University Hospital, Bariatric Surgery Unit
Methods In this single-center case series, consecutive in- and
outpatients after bariatric surgery who presented with severe
liver dysfunction from March 2014 to February 2017 were
included and followed until March 2017.
Results In total, 10 patients (m:f = 2:8; median age 48 years,
range 22–66 years) were included. Liver dysfunction occurred
after a median postoperative time of 15 months (range 2–
88 months). Median %excess weight loss at that time was
110.6% (range 85.2–155.5%). Liver steatosis/fibrosis occurred
in 70%, cirrhosis in 30% of patients, and led to fatigue (90%),
ascites (70%), hepatic encephalopathy (30%), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20%). Elevation of transaminases, impairment of coagulation parameters, thrombocytopenia, and
hypoalbuminemia were present in 70, 80, 70, and 100%, respectively. In eight patients, lengthening of the alimentary/
common limb led to an improvement or complete remission
of symptoms. In one patient, liver transplantation was required,
one patient deceased due to septic shock and decompensated
liver disease.
Conclusions Severe liver dysfunction may also occur after
bariatric procedures such as OAGB and RYGB. A comprehensive, meticulous follow-up for early identification of postoperative liver impairment should be aspired. Bypass length
reduction led to a fast improvement in all patients.

Introduction
Obesity and the concomitant metabolic syndrome represent a
global health care issue. In up to 80%, obesity is associated
with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to significant liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma
[1]. Although lifestyle modification and weight loss is known
to be the most effective treatment of NAFLD, long-term reduction of excessive overweight needs discipline and endurance, and is often unsuccessful.
During the last years, bariatric surgery has become an
established procedure for effective and sustainable weight loss
that may reverse or prevent long-term sequelae associated
with obesity, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal damage, and sleep apnea [2]. Importantly, in the
majority of patients, bariatric surgery improves liver steatosis,
inflammation, and fibrosis in NAFLD patients with obesity
[3]. In up to 16% of cases, yet, an increase of liver fibrosis or

de novo fibrosis is seen, but is consistently mild without development of cirrhosis or liver function alterations [4–10]. However,
occasional deterioration of liver function was reported and may
be attributed to the type of bariatric procedure and the extent of
malnutrition and malabsorption. Jejunoileal bypass (JIB), and to
a lesser extent also biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), are associated with a higher morbidity and mortality, particularly concerning
liver function [11, 12]. Acute liver failure was reported in 7% in a
study following 453 patients after JIB [13]. Therefore, nowadays,
bariatric surgeons refrain from performing JIB.
To date, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are the most commonly performed procedures.
The one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) or omega loop/
mini gastric bypass is an up-and-coming procedure and is
regarded as a technically simpler bypass accompanied by an
increased %excess weight loss (%EWL), but very little complications [14, 15]. Clinical liver deterioration or histologic liver
alterations after OAGB, SG, or gastric banding have not been
reported so far.
In the present study, we aimed at highlighting the occurrence and clinical characteristics of liver dysfunction after
RYGB, OAGB, and distal GB (performed due to failed weight
loss or weight regain) as seen at our institution in a case series
of 10 patients.
Patients and Methods
Consecutive in- and outpatients after bariatric surgery who
attended our facility at first presentation of liver dysfunction
from March 2014 to February 2017 were included in the study
and followed until April 2017. Patients’ health records were
retrospectively screened for preoperative signs of liver disease
and other comorbidities. All available pre- and postoperative
results of liver imaging and liver histology, as well as the
course of laboratory parameters and clinical symptoms as direct or indirect signs of liver dysfunction were analyzed.
NAFLD was graded according to the NAFLD Activity
Score (NAS). Additionally, clinical parameters such as age,
sex, weight, body mass index (BMI), ΔBMI, %EWL, and %
total weight loss (%TWL) [16] were documented prior to and/
or after bariatric surgery, respectively. Obesity was graded
according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification [17]. The study was performed in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki including current revisions.
Results
Demographics and Initial Body Weight
Patient characteristics are displayed in Table 1. Nine of 10
patients suffered from morbid obesity; one patient was
classified as having obesity grade II according to the WHO
classification [17]. No regular alcohol consumption or other
liver diseases than NAFLD were present in any of the patients
during the observed time period.
Surgical Procedures and Weight Loss
In six of 10 patients (#1–5 and #8) surgery was performed at
our center, whereas patients #6, 7, 9, and 10 were primarily
operated elsewhere and transferred to our facilities only after
complications had occurred. RYGB was the most frequently
applied primary surgical procedure (n = 5). In three patients,
OAGB and in two further patients gastric banding was performed (Table 2).
In one patient (#9) no successful weight loss was achieved
after gastric banding (6.5%EWL), so that after band removal
an OAGB was performed. In the further nine patients, the
primary surgical procedure led to a significant weight reduction of 111.8% median %EWL (range 75.4–155.5%; median
BMI 22.7 kg/m2
, range 18.4–31.9 kg/m2; for ΔBMI and
%TWL (%), see Table 2). However, in three of these patients
(#2, 4, and 5), a weight regain occurred after a median time of
7 years (range 1–8 years), in one patient after removal of
gastric band due to dysphagia and in two patients after
RYGB. Therefore, a conversion to OAGB in the first patient
and a shortening of the common channel for reduction of the
absorption length in the two other patients were performed
(after exclusion of preexisting food restriction). In total, four
of 10 patients required a secondary procedure for persistent
weight reduction.
Including all primary and secondary surgical procedures,
the overall patient’s lowest median BMI was 22.2 kg/m2
(range 18.4–30.5 kg/m2) which was equivalent to a median
%EWL of 110.6% (85.2–155.5%, and median %TWL of
51.6%, range 42.0–61.7%). The median remaining intestinal
resorption length (alimentary plus common limb) was
357.5 cm (range 245–500 cm).
Liver Alterations and Course of Liver Deterioration
The features of liver alterations and clinical presentation are
displayed in Tables 1 and 2, as well as Fig. 1. Liver dysfunction developed after a median interval of 15 months (range 2–
88 months), after performing OAGB in four patients (#2, 3, 8,
and 10), after RYGB in two patients (#6 and 7), and after distal
GB following RYGB in two patients (#4 and 5). In the remaining two patients, liver dysfunction occurred after a symptomfree period of weight stability (84 months after RYGB in patient #1 and 36 months after OAGB in patient #9) followed by
a further significant weight loss of unknown origin. Four and
5 months thereafter, signs of malnutrition and liver dysfunction became evident (Table 2).
OBES SURG (2018) 28:812–819 813

Liver dysfunction was mainly characterized by a moderate
increase in liver enzymes (70%), hepatosplenomegaly (80%),
thrombocytopenia (70%), impaired coagulation parameters
(80%), hypoalbuminemia (100%), and sarcopenia (60%). At
later stages, patients suffered from ascites (70%), pleural effusions (30%), hepatic encephalopathy (30%), hepatorenal
syndrome (10%), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (20%).
The referring histologic picture of liver alterations after
bariatric surgery was available in seven patients. While there
was a 90 to 100% micro- and macrovesicular steatosis in two
patients (#1 and 9), in three others a cirrhotic remodeling was
predominant (#2, 3, and 8). In patient #7 and #10, a worsening
from no comprehensible pathology to macrovesicular
steatosis (#7:20%; #10:85%) and fibrosis (#7:grade 1a, NAS
3/8; #10:grade 3; NAS 7/8) was documented. In the other
three patients’ (#4, 5, and 6) sonography and/or computed
tomography showed steatosis and hepatosplenomegaly, as
well as ascites (#6).
As a consequence, after bridging by implanting a feeding
tube into the remnant stomach to increase absorption (#1, 4
and 7), the common channel was lengthened (at the expense of
the biliopancreatic limb) in seven patients (#3–5, and #7–10)
and the entire bypass reversed in one patient (#1). In patient
#2, ultimately, liver transplantation was required. Patient #6
was treated conservatively and died due to septic shock and
decompensated liver disease prior to any surgical conversion
could have been performed.
Of note, after the original intestinal anatomy was restored
in patient #1, a clinical stabilization occurred as assessed by
laboratory parameters (Fig. 1, 1A–E). Furthermore, a

complete reversal of a prior 100% steatosis was found and
documented by liver biopsy (fig. 1, 1D). In patients #3 to 5
and #7 to 10, the lengthening of the common channel at expense
of the biliopancreatic limb led to a clinical stabilization and
significant improvement both in imaging and laboratory parameters in all patients (data not shown). In patient #2 (Fig. 1, 2A–E)
who received a liver transplant only 11 months after liver transplantation again, transaminases increased to six times the upper
limit of normal. Performing a re-conversion operation was considered too risky in view of a common limb of 500 cm and a
questionable benefit of the reversal since liver biopsy additionally revealed de novo post-transplantation autoimmune hepatitis
(Fig. 1, 2D).
Discussion
In the present study, we report 10 cases of significant liver
dysfunction after OAGB, RYGB, and distal GB for weight
loss failure or weight regain following RYGB. Liver dysfunction occurred after a median time period of 15 months after
surgery had been performed. In two of 10 patients, liver dysfunction developed after a significant additional unexplained
weight loss occurring after a long time period of stable weight
after RYGB or OAGB. Total median %EWL was 110.6% in
all patients. In two thirds of patients, NAFLD was present
already prior to surgery, but aggravated thereafter. In two patients, liver disease developed only after surgery.
In general, bariatric surgery has been successfully utilized to reverse or prevent further progression of NAFLD
[18–22]. In a large meta-analysis, comprising 766 patients
receiving paired liver biopsies after BPD, gastric banding,
or RYGB, improvement or resolution of steatosis,
steatohepatitis, and fibrosis was reported in 91.6, 81.3,
and 65.5% of patients, respectively [3]. In contrast, although an improvement in steatosis and hepatic cell ballooning may be observed within the first year after these
procedures, in a prospective study including 381 patients,

although 95.7% maintained a fibrosis score ≤ F1, fibrosis
had progressed significantly after 5 years, and was associated with higher BMIs and increased insulin resistance [9].
However, apart from only slight impairment of liver histology, rarely, also severe deterioration leading to liver failure
and death was described predominantly after JIB or BPD
[12]. In contrast, there are only few single cases of significant liver dysfunction after laparoscopic RYGB [23]. To
the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of
OAGB leading to a moderate or even excessive deterioration of liver function to the requirement of LT, as it was seen
in our study.
The underlying mechanisms for liver deterioration after
bariatric surgery have not yet been understood and prognostic
surrogate parameters are lacking. It has been shown that purely restrictive procedures such as SG are feasible and effective
also in patients with preexisting advanced liver disease [24].
To the best of our knowledge, severe liver deterioration after
SG or gastric banding has not been described so far. In contrast, very recently, a randomized trial reported that patients
with NASH undergoing RYGB were more susceptible to early
transient deterioration of liver function compared to SG [25].
A negative impact on liver function after RYGB has been
suggested to occur due to extended excluded limbs or distal
versions of RYGB [26]. In our series, the dimensions of the
common channels (median length 357.5 cm) should have
been more than sufficient for adequate absorption.
Nevertheless, although BMI remained within a normal range,
median %EWL was significantly higher than average. It
seems therefore apparent that an adequate limb length does
not guarantee appropriate absorption in the individual patient.
In fact, differing adaptation of the intestinal mucosa has been
hypothesized [27].
Negative events after RYGB were furthermore reported
to be largely associated with preoperatively diagnosed cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, and intraoperative complications
[28]. The degree of liver disease, yet, had no effect on the
perioperative outcome, but indicated an association with
higher mortality in patients suffering from NASH at longterm follow-up [29, 30]. A systematic review in 108 mainly
Child Pugh A patients undergoing bariatric surgery suggested an increased morbidity and mortality in these patients and described a decompensation of liver disease in
six cases, as well as death due to fulminant hepatic failure in
four cases [28]. This may lead to the question whether patients with a preexisting liver disease are more susceptible
to a Bsecond hit^ due to rapid weight loss or undefined
factors caused by malabsorptive procedures.
In our case series, both the facts that 60% of our patients
showed preexisting liver disease and that a high total median
%EWL of 110.6.3% occurred may have contributed to patients’ liver dysfunction. Importantly, the OAGB which is
considered a safe procedure has led to a considerate liver
impairment in five of our patients [31]. By elongation of the
common limb or BP reversal, a significant improvement or
even cessation of symptoms could be achieved in all patients
after RYGB or OAGB.
Of note, up to 5% of patients with morbid obesity patients
already suffer from undiagnosed cirrhosis at the time of bariatric surgery [2]. Symptoms can be relatively unspecific and
even intraoperatively macroscopic liver disease may be easily
overlooked [32]. In consequence, the presence of advanced
liver disease should be thoroughly excluded prior to bariatric
surgery. The importance of a meticulous postoperative followup including close monitoring of liver function tests needs to
be emphasized. The focus might especially be brought on
patients with previous morbid/super obesity, continuously impaired insulin resistance, and preoperative liver pathologies,
as well as sudden and fast weight loss occurring independently from the primary procedure until prospective factors for
postoperative liver deterioration have been established.
Large prospective clinical and basic research studies are
required for a better understanding of the extent of our observation in this patient collective and for the determination of
possible origins behind a deterioration of liver function after
bariatric surgery.
Limitations Due to the retrospective nature of this study, we
cannot give information on the overall prevalence of liver
deterioration after bariatric surgery. Diagnostic methods were
adapted to the clinical appearance of symptoms in each individual patient, and the prevalence of liver dysfunction might
be underestimated.
Conclusion
To date, there are no recommendations for handling bariatric
patients suffering from a certain degree of liver disease as
there is insufficient evidence, so far. Considering the fact that
obesity comes in hand with a high and increasing prevalence
of NAFLD, guidelines for pre- and postoperative surveillance
are warranted. We need to stress that in our cases, a very mild
preoperative liver pathology has led to a clinically critical liver
disease after the less malabsorptive procedures of OAGB and
RYGB. In the presented cases, elongation of the resorption
length of the bypass has led to an improvement in symptoms
in all patients and this might be considered in patients showing
a similar pattern of liver dysfunction after a bariatric procedure.
