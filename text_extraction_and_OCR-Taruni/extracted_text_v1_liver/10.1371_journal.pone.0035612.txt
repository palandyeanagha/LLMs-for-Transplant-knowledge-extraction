Abstract
Background: Osteopontin (OPN) plays an important role in the progression of chronic liver diseases. We aimed to quantify
the liver, adipose tissue and serum levels of OPN in heavy alcohol drinkers and to compare them with the histological
severity of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.
Methodology/Principal Findings: OPN was evaluated in the serum of a retrospective and prospective group of 109 and 95
heavy alcohol drinkers, respectively, in the liver of 34 patients from the retrospective group, and in the liver and adipose
tissue from an additional group of 38 heavy alcohol drinkers. Serum levels of OPN increased slightly with hepatic
inflammation and progressively with the severity of hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic OPN expression correlated with hepatic
inflammation, fibrosis, TGFb expression, neutrophils accumulation and with the serum OPN level. Interestingly, adipose
tissue OPN expression also correlated with hepatic fibrosis even after 7 days of alcohol abstinence. The elevated serum OPN
level was an independent risk factor in estimating significant (F$2) fibrosis in a model combining alkaline phosphatase,
albumin, hemoglobin, OPN and FibroMeterH levels. OPN had an area under the receiving operator curve that estimated
significant fibrosis of 0.89 and 0.88 in the retrospective and prospective groups, respectively. OPN, Hyaluronate (AUROC:
0.88), total Cytokeratin 18 (AUROC: 0.83) and FibroMeterH (AUROC: 0.90) estimated significance to the same extent in the
retrospective group. Finally, the serum OPN levels also correlated with hepatic fibrosis and estimated significant (F$2)
fibrosis in 86 patients with chronic hepatitis C, which suggested that its elevated level could be a general response to
chronic liver injury.
Conclusion/Significance: OPN increased in the liver, adipose tissue and serum with liver fibrosis in alcoholic patients.
Further, OPN is a new relevant biomarker for significant liver fibrosis. OPN could thus be an important actor in the
pathogenesis of this chronic liver disease.

Introduction
Excessive alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable
cause of death in the United States [1]. Regular alcohol use can
result in hepatic steatosis, which eventually progresses to
steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. Up to 40% of patients with
severe acute alcoholic hepatitis die within six months [1]. A better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to the
progression of liver disease and the identification of new potential
actors of the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver diseases (ALD) are thus
important challenges. Modification of gut permeability, production of acetaldehyde, NADH and ROS, activation of Endoplasmic
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35612

Reticulum stress, recruitment of immune cells into the liver and
hepatocyte apoptosis may be key mechanisms of alcohol-induced
liver injury [1,2]. In line with the involvement of death of
hepatocytes, we recently showed that serum markers of hepatocyte
death and apoptosis are non invasive biomarkers of advanced
fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease [3]. Others factors
involved in the pathogenesis of ALD can originate from extrahepatic sites, particularly adipose tissue. The pioneers in this field
have reported excess weight to be an independent risk factor for
steatosis, acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH) and cirrhosis in patients
with ALD [4]; body mass index (BMI) is an independent risk factor
for fibrosis in non-obese alcoholic patients [5] and high blood
pressure, apolipoprotein A-1 concentration and BMI are predictive of steatosis [6]. More recently, Naveau et al. demonstrated that
adipose tissue inflammation correlated with the severity of
pathological features in the liver of alcoholic patients [7].
Recently, altered hepatic expression of osteopontin (OPN), a
Th1 cytokine, chemokine and profibrogenic extracellular matrix
protein, has been reported in an animal model of alcohol-induced
liver injury [8,9,10] and in the liver of patients with alcoholic
hepatitis and fibrosis [11,12]. In female rats fed an ethanol
containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for 6 weeks and then
challenged with LPS, the elevated circulating and hepatic levels of
OPN play an important role in neutrophil accumulation and liver
injury [8,10,13,14]. OPN could also be involved in fibrogenesis.
Indeed, OPN was upregulated in rodent liver fibrosis models
[15,16,17] and in activated hepatic stellate cells [17,18,19]. OPN
was required for myofibroblast differentiation [20] and upregulation of OPN expression in the liver of patients with ALD-cirrhosis
was recently reported [12].
Similarly, OPN appears to play an important role in the
occurrence of liver complications in a mouse model of non
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [15,21,22,23]. We also
reported recently that the elevated expression of OPN was
associated with adipose tissue macrophage accumulation and liver
steatosis in humans [24] and evidence of OPN overexpression with
progressive NAFLD has been confirmed recently [12].
Based on the evidence that OPN can be considered as a
potential actor in alcohol-induced hepatic complications in
rodents, we focused our study on serum, liver and adipose tissue
OPN levels in patients with ALD and searched for a correlation
with the disease severity. The evaluation of this marker in
estimating significant fibrosis was also examined
Materials and Methods
Study population
1) Alcoholic patients. Estimation group: From October
1997 to June 1998, 109 consecutive heavy alcohol drinkers (82
males, 27 females, 4761 years old) admitted to our Liver unit for
detoxification and/or inpatient rehabilitation were entered into this
study as previously described [3,25,26]. Validation group: 95
additional consecutive heavy alcohol drinkers (73 males, 22 females,
4869 years old) were entered into this study from November 2006
to December 2009. All patients had consumed over 80 g ethanol
per day for more than 5 years. All patients were negative for
circulating hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, and human
immunodeficiency virus. No patient had osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Fasting blood samples were obtained and used to
measure alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (cGT). A needle liver
biopsy was performed in all patients by the transparietal approach.
Biopsies were processed routinely and stained with hematoxylineosin-saffron and Sirius Red. The quality of biopsies was sufficient
for interpretation [27]. The length of the liver biopsy was over
15 mm. Histopathological features were semi-quantitatively evaluated (Table 1): the grade of steatosis (0, ,5%; 1, 5%–30%; 2,
.30%–60%; 3, .60%) and stage of fibrosis (from 0, none, to 4,
cirrhosis). The grading of hepatitic inflammation was done
according to the Activity score of Orrego et al. [28]. Briefly,
hepatic inflammation was determined by the presence (I1) or
absence (I0) of hepatocellular necrosis and ballooning degeneration,
alcoholic Mallory’s hyaline bodies, associated with an inflammatory
reaction. Sera and liver tissues were stored at 280uC until use.
Second gene group: 38 consecutive heavy alcohol drinkers
admitted to the Hepatogastroenterology Department of Antoine
Be´cle`re University Hospital, Clamart, France, due to alcoholism
and ALD, were prospectively included into this study. All patients
underwent ultrasound-guided liver biopsy at admission. One
specimen of liver tissue was used for histological analysis and
another was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
280uC for subsequent RNA extraction. Specimens were stained
with hematoxylin-eosin-saffron, Masson’s trichrome and picrosirius
red. All biopsy samples were evaluated by a pathologist blind to the
patient’s clinical and biological data and to the duration of
alcoholism and daily alcohol intake. Histopathological features
were evaluated semi-quantitatively as described above (Table 1).
Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were performed at admission
and after 7 days of abstinence from ethanol consumption. Adipose
tissue samples were removed by needle aspiration as previously
described [7]. 2) Patients with chronic viral hepatitis C. 86
patients with chronic viral hepatitis C were included from June 1999
to May 2009. Anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA were detected
in their serum. Selected patients had an available liver biopsy and
some blood markers. Fasting blood samples were collected
immediately before or no more than 12 months after liver biopsy.
Exclusion criteria comprised additional causes of liver disease,
particularly HBV and HIV infections, complicated cirrhosis, antifibrotic treatment in the previous 6 months, alcohol consumption of
more than 30 g/day in the five years prior to inclusion. Liver
biopsies were performed using Menghini’s technique with a 1.4–
1.6 mm diameter needle. Biopsy specimens were fixed in a
formalin–alcohol–acetic solution and embedded in paraffin; 5-mm
thick sections were then cut and stained with hematoxylin–eosin–
saffron. Liver fibrosis was staged from F0 to F4 according to the
Metavir staging system [29]. The diagnostic target, significant
fibrosis, was defined as follows: F2+F3+F4. Readings were
performed by independent, senior pathologists specialized in
hepatology. These pathologists were blinded to blood tests. 3)
Obese patients. Obese patients were recruited through the
Department of Digestive Surgery and Liver Transplantation, where
they underwent bariatric surgery for morbid obesity (Nice and Paris
hospitals). Bariatric surgery was indicated for these patients in
accordance with the French Guidelines for surgery for obesity.
Briefly, they had a BMI of 40 or 35 kg/m2 with at least one
complication. Exclusion criteria were as follows: presence of a
hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection, excessive alcohol
consumption (.20 g/day), or another cause of chronic liver
diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson
disease, genetic hemochromatosis, or biliary disease). Fasting blood
samples were obtained before surgery. Surgical liver biopsies were
obtained at the time of bariatric surgery. Liver bridging fibrosis was
assessed by sirius red staining and was classified into five stages as
follows: absent, mild, significant (incomplete septa), advanced (with
complete septa) and cirrhotic.
All subjects gave their informed written consent to participate in
this research study according to French legislation regarding
Ethics and Human Research (Huriet-Serusclat law, the ‘‘Comite´

Hospitalier Universitaire of Angers Hospital’’ (Nu2010-01) approved this study).
Circulating levels of OPN, Leptin and FibroMeterH
Circulating OPN levels were evaluated with an ELISA (R&D
Systems, Lille, France), as described in the manufacturer’s
instructions. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, in random
order and blinded to the clinical/pathological data. The CV (%) of
intra-assay precision and inter assay precision ranged from 2.6 to 4
and 5.4 to 6.6, respectively. The minimum detectable dose of
OPN ranged from 0.006 to 0.024 ng/mL. Serum was validated
for use in this assay as indicated by the manufacturer. However,
serum values are approximately 50% of the plasma values because
of proteolytic cleavage by thrombin during the clotting process.
Leptin was assessed in the serum by MILLIPLEX MAP Human
Adipokine Panel A kit (HADK1-61K-A, Millipore) using a
Luminex instrument (Luminex) according to manufacturer’s
recommendations. The FibroMeterH index of fibrosis was
calculated using an algorithm including hyaluronate, the prothrombin index, a2-macroglobulin and platelets [30].
Immunostaining
Liver biopsies were fixed in 4% buffered formol, paraffin
embedded and sectioned at a thickness of 2 micron Slides were
then dewaxed at pH = 6 using PT link (cycle :start at 65uC ,209 at
95uC, back to 65uC), and washed for 5 minutes in Envision Flex
Wash Buffer. Immunohistochemical staining was done using
Autostainer Link, with anti-CD15 antibodies (347420 BD
Biosciences) as the primary antibody, and diaminobenzidine
(DAB) as activated chromogen. Nuclear counterstaining was done
with Hematoxylin. CD15+ cells were counted in 2 or 3 portal
spaces for each patient at 4006 magnification. Counting was
performed blindly by one observer.
Real-time quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from human tissues using a RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). The samples were treated
with Turbo DNA-freeTM (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf,
France) or RNAse-free DNAse kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocols. The quality of the isolated RNA was
determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser with RNA 6000
Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Massy, France). Total RNA (0.5 or
0.35 mg) was reverse-transcribed with the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf,
France) or with the RT2 First Strand kit (SABiosciences) for the
‘‘estimation’’ and ’’second gene’’ groups, respectively. For the
estimation group, real-time quantitative PCR was performed using
the ABI PRISM 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System and FAMTM
dyes (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) following the
manufacturer’s protocols in C3M Genomics facilities. The
TaqManH gene expression assays were purchased from Applied
Biosystems: OPN, (Hs00167093_m1); TGFb (Hs00171257_m1),
RPLP0 (Hs99999902_m1) and 18S (Hs99999901_s1). For the
second gene group, real-time quantitative PCR was performed
using a custom-made PCR array (SABiosciences) in the LightCyclerH 480 instrument (Roche) with the RT2 SYBRH Green
qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Gene expression values were normalized to the value of
the housekeeping gene RPLP0 (Ribosomal Phosphoprotein Large
P0) or 18S and calculated based on the comparative cycle threshold
Ct method (22DDCt) as previously described [24,31].

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of the differential gene expression or
circulating levels between the two study groups was determined
using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test with the DCt or
amount for each group, respectively. The non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for the comparison of more than
two study groups. P,0.05 was considered as significant. As a posthoc correction for Kruskal-Wallis test, the Scheffe’s test has been
performed (data not shown). Correlations were analyzed using the
Spearman’s rank correlation test. Comparisons were done using
the Chi2 test or Fischer’s exact tests for nominal data and by twosample t tests for continuous data. Multivariate analyses were
performed using binary logistic regression with estimation of odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Diagnostic
performance was determined by constructing a ‘‘receiver-operating characteristic’’ (ROC) curve and calculating the area under the
ROC (AUROC) curve for determination of patients with
significant fibrosis (F$2) for serum OPN. From these curves, the
best cut-off values were established for OPN, which were the
values that maximized the sum of the sensitivity and specificity to
identify patient status. Statistical analyses were performed using
NCSS 2007 software.
Results
Clinical Characteristics of Patients
Two cohorts of heavy alcohol drinkers were included in this
study, which examines retrospective (estimation cohort) and
prospective (validation cohort) data. In the estimation cohort
(109 patients), 36% of the patients had moderate or severe steatosis
(S$2), 24% presented with hepatic inflammation, 14% with
moderate fibrosis (F = 2) and 27% with advanced fibrosis (F$3)
(Table 1). The estimation (Table 1) and validation (95 patients)
cohorts were similar in terms of age, gender, alcohol consumption,
AST, AST/ALT, cGT and hepatic fibrosis. The serum OPN level
was evaluated in all patients, while OPN gene expression was
evaluated in the liver of 34 patients from the estimation group
(Table 1: Liver) and in the liver and adipose tissue in 38 patients
from the second group (Table 1: Second gene group).
The serum and hepatic OPN level increased with liver
fibrosis in patients with alcoholic liver diseases
We first evaluated the serum OPN levels in the estimation
cohort of 109 alcoholic patients. While hepatic steatosis had no
effect on the serum OPN level (Figure 1A), the level was
increased in patients with hepatic inflammation (I1) compared
with patients without liver inflammation (I0) (Figure 1B) and was
progressively increased in association with the stage of fibrosis
(Figure 1C). The serum OPN concentrations of F0/F1 alcoholic
patients (14 F0 and 51 F1) were comparable to those found in
16 lean subjects without diagnosed liver complications
(BMI = 2161 kg/m2
) and in 14 morbidly obese patients
(BMI = 4361 kg/m2
) with a minimal stage of fibrosis (4 F0 and
10 F1) and without hepatic steatosis, inflammation and ballooning
(Figure S1). The serum OPN level further correlated strongly
with fibrosis (rs= 0.681, P,0.001) and, to a lesser extent with the
hepatic inflammation (rs= 0.193, P = 0.047). We then evaluated
the hepatic expression level of OPN and TGFb, a pro-fibrogenic
factor [32], in 34 alcoholic patients from the estimation group
(Table 1). Gene expression of OPN was increased in patients with
moderate (F2) and advanced fibrosis (F3/F4) compared with
patients with no fibrosis (F0) (Figure 2A). The liver OPN and
TGFb expression correlated with each other and with the grade of
fibrosis (Figures 2A and 2B). The serum OPN level also
correlated with its hepatic expression. Since OPN plays an
important role in neutrophil accumulation and liver injury in the
rat model of ASH [8,10,13,14], we then evaluated OPN
expression compared to the accumulation of neutrophil in the
liver of patients with different grades of hepatic fibrosis (N = 11).
The number of neutrophils in the portal space correlated with the
circulating and hepatic OPN level (rs= 0.917, P,0.001; rs= 0.907,
P,0.001; respectively) (Figure 2C). These results indicate that
the circulating OPN level could reflect its hepatic expression and
that there is a strong link between hepatic OPN expression and
fibrogenesis.
Figure 1. The serum OPN level correlated with fibrosis and
steatohepatitis in 109 alcoholic patients (estimation cohort).
The circulating levels of OPN were measured in the serum of 109
alcoholic patients (Table 1) and analyzed according to the grade of
steatosis (S0, S1, S2, S3)(A), the presence of hepatic inflammation (I0, I1)
(Hepatic inflammation was determined by the presence (I1) or absence
(I0) of hepatocellular necrosis and ballooning degeneration, alcoholic
Mallory’s hyaline bodies, associated with an inflammatory reaction) (B)
and the stage of fibrosis (F0, F1, F2, F3, F4)(C) (as described in Materials
and Methods). Results were expressed as the median (25th, 75th
percentile). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the 4 groups
S0, S1, S2 and S3, P = 0.900 and the 5 groups F0, F1, F2, F3 and F4,
P,0.001. The Mann Whitney test compared A0 A1: P = 0.047. The Mann
Whitney test compared the two groups (C): &, P,0.015, compared with
F0; #, P,0.028, compared with F1; $, P = 0.007, compared with F2.
Correlations between the serum OPN level with hepatic steatosis,
hepatitis or fibrosis were analyzed using the Spearman’s rank
correlation test.

The adipose tissue OPN level increased with liver fibrosis
in patients with alcoholic liver diseases
Since adipose tissue inflammation correlated with the severity of
pathological features in the liver [7], we evaluated OPN expression
in 38 ongoing alcoholic patients in both liver and adipose tissue
biopsies (BMI = 2464 kg/m2
) (Table 1: Second gene group).
In adipose tissue, the OPN level was already increased in patients
with mild fibrosis (F1) compared with patients without liver fibrosis
(3.1060.51 fold increase, P = 0.0082) and correlated with hepatic
fibrosis but not with liver steatosis and inflammation (Table 2).
OPN level in adipose tissue did not correlate with BMI (rs= 0.073,
P = 0.689, N = 37) and the leptin level in adipose tissue (rs= 0.138,
P = 0.415, N = 37) or serum (rs= 0.099, P = 0.577, N = 34).
Expression in the liver correlated with fibrosis, as found in the
estimation group (Figure 1), and with steatosis and inflammation
(Table 2). Because recent alcohol intake could influence these
results, the adipose tissue OPN expression was evaluated after 7
days of alcohol abstinence. Its expression still correlated with liver
fibrosis (Table 2). Since OPN is mainly expressed by the
inflammatory and immune cells in adipose tissue [22,24], the
Figure 2. Hepatic OPN expression correlated with hepatic TGFb expression, portal space neutrophils and the serum OPN level. A)
Hepatic OPN and TGFb1 expression levels were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR in 34 alcoholic patients from the estimation group without
(F0) (N = 6) or with mild (F1) (N = 14), moderate (F2) (N = 6) or advanced (F3/4) (N = 8) fibrosis. The mRNA levels were normalized to the mRNA levels
of RPLP0. Results are expressed relative to the expression levels in F0 patients and expressed as means 6 SEM. The Kruskal-Wallis test compared the 4
groups F0, F1, F2 and F3/F4: OPN, P = 0.037; TGFb1, P = 0.002. Mann Whitney test compared the two groups: &, P#0.011, compared with F0; #,
P#0.029, compared with F1; $, P = 0.008, compared with F2. B) Correlation between hepatic OPN gene expression (DCt) and either the hepatic TGFb1
expression level (DCt) or the serum OPN level were analyzed using the Spearman’s rank correlation test. C) Correlation between the number of portal
space neutophils (Cf. Materials and methods) and serum OPN level or hepatic OPN gene expression (DCt) in 11 alcoholic patients (2F0/3F1/1F2/5F4)
were analyzed using the Spearman’s rank correlation test.

adipose tissue of alcoholic patients could be inflamed at the early
stage of liver fibrogenesis.
The serum OPN level was an independent risk factor in
estimating significant (F$2) liver fibrosis in patients with
alcoholic liver diseases
Since the circulating level of OPN was higher in patients with
moderate fibrosis (F2) compared with patients with no or mild
fibrosis (F0/F1) (Figure 1C), we investigated the pertinence of the
serum OPN level for the estimation of significant fibrosis (F$2).
Using the univariate analysis (Table 3), patients with significant
fibrosis (F$2) were older and had a higher levels of OPN, cGT,
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, hyaluronate and of the FibroMeterH index of fibrosis and lower levels of platelets, albumin, red
blood cells, hemoglobin and of the prothrombin index compared
to patients with mild fibrosis (F,2) (Table 3). In contrast, the
gender, AST and ALT were not associated with F$2. In a
multivariate analysis including the OPN, alkaline phosphatase,
albumin, hemoglobin and FibroMeterH level, OPN and FibroMeterH were the only independent variables when F$2 was the
judgment criterion (Table 4). Since FibroMeterH is a test that
combines analysis for hyaluronate, the prothrombin index, a2-
macroglobulin and platelets, we did not include these items in this
analysis. The serum OPN level could thus be considered as an
independent factor in estimating significant liver fibrosis in patients
with alcoholic liver disease.

and significant (F$2) fibrosis with the serum OPN level was 0.89
(95% CI: 0.81–0.94) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79–0.93), respectively.
Thus, the retrospective (estimation cohort) and prospective
(validation cohort) studies led to the same result. Several cut-off
values were calculated for the serum OPN level for the prediction
of F$2 in the estimation group (Table S1). For example, the cutoff point at 29 ng/mL estimated F$2 with a sensitivity of 84%, a
specificity of 81%, a Positive and Negative Predictive Value of
75.5% and 88.3%, respectively. To validate the performance of
OPN in estimating significant fibrosis, we compared the OPN to
the FibroMeterH level, a specific blood test using four biomarkers
to predict fibrosis in ALD [30], and hyaluronate, serum cell death
(Cytokeratin 18 total) and apoptotic markers (caspases generated
cytokeratin 18 fragment), single biomarkers reflecting increased
fibrogenesis [3,33]. The area under the ROC curve in the
estimation cohort for discriminating F,2 from significant (F$2)
fibrosis with the FibroMeterH, hyaluronate, cell death marker and
apoptotic marker was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82–0.95), 0.88 (95% CI:
0.79–0.94), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.73–0.89) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63–
0.82), respectively. While OPN was more efficient than the
apoptotic marker in estimating significant fibrosis (OPN AUROC

that OPN should be an important actor or manifestation of liver
fibrosis induced by chronic alcohol consumption.
The serum OPN levels correlated with hepatic fibrosis
and estimated significant (F$2) fibrosis in patients with
chronic viral hepatitis C
To explore whether the previous findings were specific to ALD,
we evaluated the serum OPN levels in 86 patients with chronic
viral hepatitis C including 25 patients with mild fibrosis (F1), 34
patients with moderate fibrosis (F2), 19 patients with severe fibrosis
(F3) and 8 patients with cirrhosis (F4). The OPN level was
increased in patients with moderate, severe fibrosis or cirrhosis
compared with patients with mild fibrosis (F1) (Figure 4A). The
serum OPN level further correlated strongly with fibrosis
(rs= 0.617, P,0.001) (Figure 4A) and, to a lower extent with
hepatic inflammation (rs= 0.360, P = 0.047). However, the serum
OPN level in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C and significant
fibrosis (F$2) was lower than in alcoholic patients with significant
fibrosis (F$2) (HCV group: OPN median = 43.2 ng/mL, N = 61;
Alcoholic group (estimation cohort): OPN median = 59.5 ng/mL,
N = 44; Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.005). As shown in Figure 4B,
the area under the ROC curve in patients with chronic viral
hepatitis C to estimate significant (F$2) and advanced (F$3)
fibrosis with the serum OPN level were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.62–0.84)
and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68–0.89), respectively. This indicated that
circulating OPN could be a conserved response to chronic liver
injury induced, per se, by alcohol and HCV.
Discussion
We report here for the first time that the serum OPN level
correlated with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in heavy alcohol
drinkers. The hepatic OPN expression level strongly correlated
with hepatic neutrophils accumulation, the pro-fibrogenic factor
TGFb and hepatic fibrosis. Expression of OPN in adipose tissue
correlated with hepatic fibrosis reinforcing the concept that
adipose tissue was also inflamed in ALD. The serum level of
OPN was an accurate independent factor in estimating significant
liver fibrosis in both the estimation and validation cohort.
OPN expression detected in adipose tissue and in the liver of
alcoholic patients was enhanced by the presence of hepatic
fibrosis. The relative contribution of these two tissues in circulating
OPN is difficult to estimate. While hepatic OPN expression
correlated with the serum OPN level in our patients, further
studies will be required to determine the relative role of these two
tissues in modulating circulating OPN concentrations. Although
the cellular origin of the increased hepatic OPN expression has not
been precisely determined, increased OPN gene expression has
been reported in macrophages, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, biliary
epithelial cells and in inflammatory cells of the necrotic areas in
rodent liver fibrosis models [15,16,18]. The observation that
hepatic inflammation was associated with elevated serum OPN

levels is in favor of a role for OPN in liver inflammation. Recent
studies have highlighted the role of OPN in inflammatory liver
diseases such as alcoholic and non alcoholic liver diseases and T
cell-mediated hepatitis [8,10,13,15,23,34,35,36,37]. In rodent
models of alcoholic liver diseases, neutrophils accumulation in
the liver was mediated by OPN [8,10,13]. In agreement with these
reports, we showed in a small number of patients that hepatic and
systemic OPN expression correlated with neutophil infiltration in
the portal space. OPN also facilitated the infiltration and
accumulation of macrophages at sites of injury during the initial
steps after carbon tetrachloride intoxication [16]. The recruitment
and activation of the inflammatory and immune cells by OPN
could enhance hepatic inflammation, which in turn may activate
hepatic stellate cells and fibrogenesis. In agreement with this
mechanism, the invalidation of the OPN gene decreased hepatic
inflammation and consequently fibrosis in mice fed a cholinemethione-deficient diet [12,15]. Furthermore, it has been
suggested that OPN could have fibrogenic properties. OPN
expression was increased in activated hepatic stellate cells
[17,18,19] and was required for myofibroblast differentiation
[20]. OPN was regulated by the hedgehog pathway and directly
promoted pro-fibrogenic responses [12]. The upregulation of
OPN has been reported in the liver of patients with ALD-cirrhosis
but also with NASH-cirrhosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, which suggested that OPN induction is a conserved response to chronic liver
injury [12]. Excess weight was as an independent risk factor for
fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with ALD [4,5]. More recently,
Naveau et al. demonstrated that adipose tissue inflammation
correlated with the severity of pathological features in the liver [7].
The increase in the production of OPN in adipose tissue could
result from the activation of adipose tissue macrophages by LPS
and cytokines such as TNFa and IL6. The latter were strongly
increased in serum and adipose tissue of heavy alcohol drinkers
[1,7]. OPN plays an important role in the infiltration and
accumulation of macrophages in the early stages of obesity.
Indeed, we recently reported that elevated OPN expression in
adipose tissue paralleled with adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and both phenomena were reversed after weight loss in obese
patients [24]. While further investigation is necessary to determine
the molecular mechanism of adipose tissue inflammation, adipose
tissue OPN expression could lead to enrichment of adipose tissue
in macrophages and to increased adipose tissue inflammation. The
OPN level in adipose tissue could be related more to inflammation
than adipose tissue gain. Indeed, OPN expression in adipose tissue
did not correlate with BMI, leptin expression and leptinemia.
We have shown for the first time that the serum OPN level was an
independent factor that estimates significant fibrosis in two
independent cohorts of patients with ALD. A larger group of
alcoholic patients with all the data allowing to repeat the univariate
and multiple regression modeling will be done in the future. Since
circulating OPN could increase in obese individuals and that obesity
is also associated with a higher propensity to fibrosis and progression
of chronic liver diseases, we analyzed 60 alcoholic patients with
available BMI to determine an independent association between
OPN and fibrosis. In these patients (39% with a significant fibrosis
(F$2)), serum OPN correlated with hepatic fibrosis (rs= 0.497,
P,0.001, N = 60) but not with BMI (rs= 0.128, P= 0.328, N = 60).
Using the univariate analysis, OPN but not BMI was associated with
F$2 (Table S2). In a multivariate analysis including the OPN,
cGT and BMI, OPN was the only independent variable when F$2
was the judgment criterion (Table S3). The serum OPN level could
thus be considered as an independent factor estimating significant
liver fibrosis. However, additional validations on a large number of
alcoholic patients, controls subjects and morbidly obese group
included patients with the full range of liver fibrosis with available
BMI will be required. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for
assessment of liver fibrosis. However, problems with liver biopsy
include sampling error and inter-observer variability. Fibroscan and
the currently available blood-algorithm tests (FibrotestH, FibroMeterH) or direct biomarker (Hyaluronate) can differentiate between
mild and advanced disease [2,33,38,39]. In the case of borderline
results two or more methods can be combined. However,
identification of novel markers is needed to improve bloodalgorithm tests leading to quantification of fibrosis and to monitor
the dynamic nature of fibrosis.
Interestingly, the OPN and FibroMeterH levels were the only
independent variables when the F$2 was the judgment criterion in
a multivariate analysis including OPN, alkaline phosphatase,
albumin, hemoglobin and FibroMeterH levels. Furthermore,
OPN, FibroMeterH and hyaluronate estimated significant fibrosis
with the same accuracy. OPN was a good marker in both
retrospective (AUROC = 0.89 (0.81, 0.94)) and prospective
(AUROC = 0.88 (0.79, 0.93)) studies. Moreover, the serum OPN
levels accurately estimated advanced fibrosis (F$3: AUROC = 0.91
(0.83, 0.95)) and cirrhosis (F = 4: AUROC = 0.91 (0.80, 0.96)) in
alcoholic patients (from the estimation group).
Circulating levels of OPN were also modified in patients with
liver complications related to the hepatitis C and B viruses. An
elevated circulating OPN level was an excellent predictor of
cirrhosis in patients with a hepatitis B infection [40]. The circulating
levels of OPN were also modified in patients with liver
complications induced by a hepatitis C infection. Indeed, we report
here that the serum OPN in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C
correlates with hepatic fibrosis, as previously reported for plasma of
hepatitis C virus infected subjects [41]. OPN enhanced tumor
development and metastases, since OPN was highly expressed in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and correlated with worse
prognosis [42]. However, the role of OPN in these diseases is still
poorly understood. It was recently proposed that OPN could be a
potential target for the control of HCC [43,44].
In summary, circulating levels of OPN estimate, with good
accuracy, significant fibrosis in heavy alcohol drinkers. Hepatic
OPN also correlated with serum OPN and with hepatic
inflammation, neutrophils infiltration, fibrosis and TGFb expression. Infiltration of liver by parenchymal neutrophils is a
prominent feature of Alcoholic Hepatitis [45]. Up-regulation of
OPN in liver could contribute to this infiltration and the severity of
Alcoholic Hepatitis. Multiple factors stimulate parenchymal and
nonparenchymal cells to produce this chemokine including LPS,
IL6 and TNFa. Adipose tissue of alcoholic patients was further
inflamed, as evaluated by OPN expression. OPN adipose tissue
level also correlated with hepatic fibrosis. Since TNFa and IL6
were strongly increased in adipose tissue and serum of heavy
alcohol drinkers [1,7], cytokines secreted by adipose tissue could
enhance the inflammation and up-regulation of OPN in liver. The
recruitment and activation of the inflammatory and immune cells
by OPN could also enhance hepatic inflammation, which in turn
may activate hepatic stellate cells and fibrogenesis. Furthermore, it
has been suggested that OPN could have fibrogenic properties
[12,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Studies focusing on the role of OPN in
liver and adipose tissue function will be appropriate approaches to
acquire more insight into the pathogenesis of human ALD.
