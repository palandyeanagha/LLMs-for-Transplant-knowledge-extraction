Abstract 
Aims: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become the most severe 
public health issue all over the world. Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury 
has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk 
factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19.
Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in 
Beijing You’an Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, 
they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). 
Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The 
independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed.
Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% 
(33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal 
group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly 
higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly 
lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT 
elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
showed CRP ≥20 mg/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1×10^9/L were independently 
related to hepatic injury.
Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic 
injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine 
storm in liver injury. Early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury in patients 
with COVID-19 are necessary.

Introduction 
The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a severe public health issue in the 
world, is a newly emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus 
SARS-CoV-2, which may develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple 
organs failure1-3. It’s reported that this novel coronavirus is identified to the species of 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related-Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) which 
belongs to the beta-coronavirus family and share 79.6% sequence identity to 
SARS-CoV 4
. Based on the phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, it was 
officially named as SARS-CoV-25
, and the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was 
named as COVID-19 6. 
Despite atypical pneumonia as the primary symptom, liver dysfunction has also 
been observed in many clinical cases7-9, indicating a possibility for the patients with 
COVID-19 may cause hepatic injury. Except that part of patients receiving 
lopinavir/ritonavir during hospitalization, which can cause drug-induced hepatic 
injury10, the underlying mechanisms for hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19 are 
still unclear. And there are few of clinical research regarding on this issue and it 
remains controversial now. 
Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the changes of liver injury in 
the patients with COVID-19 retrospectively, and analyzed the clinical features and 
laboratory data to seek the possible risk factors of liver injury in patients with 
COVID-19. The findings provide new clues and data for the mechanisms of liver 
injury in patients with COVID-19.

Methods 
Study design and patient selection 
From January 21st, 2020 to February 29th, 2020, a total of 85 consecutive 
patients with COVID-19 were admitted and treated in Beijing You’an Hospital, 
Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. The diagnosis criteria of COVID-19 are 
based on the detection of nucleic acid, the epidemiological history, clinical feature or 
laboratory testing and imaging11. 
The clinical classifications are as follows: (1) Mild: only mild symptoms, no sign 
of pneumonia in imaging. (2) Ordinary: with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and 
imaging shows pneumonia. (3) Severe: meet any of the following: a) respiratory 
distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 beats / min; b) in the resting state, means oxygen 
saturation ≤ 93%; c) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/ oxygen concentration ≤
300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa). Pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions 
progressed more than 50% within 24-48 hours, and the patients were managed 
according to moderate case. (4) Critical: one of the following conditions: a) 
respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation; b) Shock occurs; c) 
ICU admission is required for combined organ failure. 
This retrospective study was performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines 
of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and was authorized by the Institutional Review 
Board of Beijing You’an Hospital, Capital Medical University (Approval No.

2020-022). The informed consent was waived by the IRB because this study was a 
retrospective assessment. 
Baseline data collection 
The laboratory data of 85 patients at admission were collected. Laboratory 
assessments consisted of complete blood count, blood chemistry, coagulation test, 
liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactic acid, cardiac markers. 
Statistical analysis 
Age and days were represented by median (range), categorical variables by 
number (%), and laboratory data by mean (interquartile range). Compared the 
differences between the two groups with t-test, chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U 
test. Logistic regression was used to select independent risk factors that affect 
abnormal liver function. Analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 statistical 
package (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 
Results 
Clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 
The characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the present study were shown 
in Table 1. The median age of the patients with COVID-19 was 49 years old, the sex 
ratio was similar. The average ALT value was 28U/L. The average value of total 
bilirubin and direct bilirubin were in the normal range. The average level of creatinine 
was normal. C-reactive protein increased significantly, the average value of

lymphocyte was close to the normal low value. The median value of creatine kinase 
was normal. In terms of clinical classification, the proportion of patients with ordinary 
type was 42.3%, followed by severe and critical patients. 
The proportion and incidence rate of abnormal liver function 
There were 33 patients with abnormal liver function during the whole process of 
hospitalization, accounting for 38.8% (33/85), including elevated ALT and AST 
(Table 2). And 24.7% (21/85) of them with ALT elevation on admission. Among the 
21 patients presenting with abnormal liver function at admission, only one of them 
had moderate elevation of ALT (179U/L), others had mild liver injury (ALT<2ULN). 
14.1% of patients (12/85) had abnormal liver function during the whole process of 
hospitalization. All of them are mild and medium elevation of ALT. Six patients with 
chronic hepatic diseases were enrolled in our study. There was no abnormal liver 
function in two patients with HBV infection. There were two patients with alcoholic 
liver disease, one of them had moderate elevation of ALT (120U/L) within one week 
after admission, the other one had no liver injury. There were two patients with fatty 
liver, one patient had mild liver injury on admission, the other one had liver injury on 
3 days after admission. 
Comparison of baseline data of the COVID-19 patients between normal and 
abnormal liver function group 
The results were shown in Table 2. The median age of the two groups was 
statistically different, the ALT elevation group was 59 years old and the ALT normal 
group was 44.5 years old. Compared with patients with normal liver function, patients

who had elevated ALT were more likely to have drinking history. Albumin in ALT 
elevation group were significantly lower than those in the ALT normal group 
(33.4±4.3 vs 37.8±4.8, P = 0.000). The bilirubin level was normal between the two 
groups. The level of lactic acid was significantly higher in the ALT elevation group 
(1.5±0.6 vs 1.2±0.5, P = 0.037). The number of lymphocytes in ALT elevation group 
was significantly lower than that in ALT normal group (0.8 vs 1.4, P = 0.000). 
However, the level of CRP was significantly higher in the ALT normal group (39.7 vs 
37.4, P = 0.000). At the same time, the number of neutrophils and myoglobin also 
increased in ALT elevation group than in ALT normal group. The proportion of 
severe and critical patients in the ALT elevation group was significantly higher, 
reaching 61.5%. 
The factor related to ALT elevation in Multivariate analysis 
Multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze the factors including 
age, drinking history, baseline albumin, lactic acid, CRP, neutrophils, lymphocytes，
myoglobin and clinical classification. It was found that the CRP ≥20 mg/L and 
lymphocyte count< 1.1×10^9/L were independently related to ALT elevation. (Table

Discussion 
The present study mainly focused on the risk factors involved with hepatic injury 
in the patients with COVID-19. After excluding the patients receiving drugs that may 
cause liver damage such as lopinavir/ritonavir, according to the findings, for the first

time, we found that the level of lymphopenia and CRP were independently associated 
with hepatic injury, and our study suggested inflammatory cytokine storm might be 
the major mechanism. 
As the number of patients with COVID-19 continues to rise, liver injury is 
frequently reported as extra-pulmonary clinical feature. Some recent studies revealed 
that nearly a half of patients experienced different degrees of liver injury7.8. However, 
as far as we know, there is no study on the factors of liver injury. Such as SARS, 
SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-II4
, 
which is expressed in the liver tissue as well. A lately research showed that bile duct 
cells had higher specific expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-II than 
hepatocytes12, which indicated the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infected bile duct cells 
directly and caused hepatic injury. It’s suggested that bile duct epithelial cells may 
play a key role in immunoreaction. However, clinical data from two researches 
showed that the bile duct injury related indexes alkaline phosphatase, 
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and total bilirubin did not increase significantly10,14. 
In our study, the hepatic injury of patients was mainly reflected through mild or 
medium elevation of ALT, and the level of serum TBIL was almost normal. Moreover, 
the pathological results of liver biopsy showed moderate microvascular steatosis and 
active inflammation in the hepatic lobule portal area13. Due to the use of 
lopinavir/ritonavir during treatment, it is difficult to distinguish the reason of liver 
injury according to the pathological results. Although the cell entry receptor 
angiotensin converting enzyme-II is highly expressed in bile duct cells, recent works

and our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection did not cause an obvious bile 
duct injury. Thus, SARS-COV-2 infection may not be the major reason related to 
liver injury. 
In our study, there were a total of 33 patients with abnormal liver function during 
the whole process of hospitalization, accounting for 38.8%. And 24.7% (21/85) of 
them showed ALT elevation on admission. Among the 21 patients presenting with 
hepatic injury, only one of them had moderate elevation of ALT (179U/L), others had 
mild liver injury (ALT<2ULN). The results suggested that COVID-19-related hepatic 
injury was not serious at the beginning of the disease, which was consistent with 
previous researches. Compared with other study9
, the higher proportion of patients 
with liver injury at admission might be related to the number of samples and the 
different periods from onset to hospitalization in our study. 
Among the patients presenting with abnormal liver function in the present study, 
moderate and severe types of patients were more likely to have liver injury, 
accounting for 58.8% and 66.7%. This indication was consistent with Academician 
Nanshan Zhong ’s recent clinical research on acute respiratory syndrome caused by 
COVID-19, which involved the largest scale of data so far15. It suggested that hepatic 
injury likely occurred in patients under critical care. Moreover, in our study, a positive 
correlative relationship between the lymphopenia and liver injury. Based on previous 
studies16,17, lymphopenia is typical laboratory indicator during highly pathogenic 
coronavirus infections, such as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, and is 
believed to be associated with disease severity. Recent studies revealed that 63%-70.3%

of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with severe diseases have lymphopenia and the low 
level of lymphocyte counts in patients is associated with mortal outcome8,18. 
Therefore, our results suggested that the occurrence of hepatic injury was related to 
the deterioration of the disease with a dynamic process. In addition, six cases with 
chronic hepatic diseases were enrolled in our study, however there was no significant 
difference between the abnormal liver function group and normal liver function group. 
This might be related to the fact that most of the inpatients were ordinary type9,10. 
Previous studies have shown that inflammatory cytokine storm is associated with 
severe lung injury and adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection 
17,19,20. Inflammatory cytokine storm is an overactive inflammatory response of the 
human body caused by virus infection, which leads to a persistent activation and 
reproduction of lymphocytes and macrophages that will secrete huge amount of 
inflammatory cytokine21. Inflammatory cytokine storm not only leads to pulmonary 
injury, but also the injury of non-pulmonary organs including the liver, kidneys and 
cardiac muscle. And some studies have found the liver damage is more common in 
patients with severe pneumonia, which is suspected to be associated with 
inflammatory factor storm8,9. In our study, patients with liver damage had higher 
elevated CRP level. As a typical inflammatory index, CRP is an acute phase protein 
that rapidly increase in the presence of infection or tissue damage. Additionally, 
lymphocyte cells are important for inhibiting overactive innate immune responses 
during viral infection22,23. Thus, loss of lymphocyte cells during SARS-CoV-2 
infection may result in aggravated inflammatory responses. The significant decreases

in the counts of lymphocyte cells, especially CD8+
T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, 
IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-1924. 
While T cell counts drop to the lowest levels, serum level of inflammatory cytokines 
reach their peaks in a few days after the onset of COVID-19. It suggests that 
inflammatory cytokines are involved in the process at the early stage, which can 
explain the reason for the patients with mild liver injury. 
Compared with the inflammatory damage of lung, the inflammatory damage of 
liver was relatively mild by autopsy analysis13. This result may explain that no one 
develop to liver failure or severe hepatitis in our study, even in severe cases. 14.1% of 
patients (12/85) had liver injury during the whole process of hospitalization. All of 
them are mild and medium elevation of ALT. After liver protection treatment, the 
liver function of most patients was improved within one or two weeks. 
Our study also observed the patients had a decline of serum albumin, though 
there was no obvious difference between the two groups. It was more likely due to the 
patients’ hyper metabolic state presenting with fever, malnutrition and low caloric 
intake, suggesting the importance of nutritional support therapy. Moreover, 
hyperlactatemia reflects hypoxia injury and may be related to liver injury, our results 
showed that hyperlactatemia was related to liver injury, but it turned to negative after 
multivariate analysis. The change of result may be related to our sample size, which 
needs further study and confirmation. 
There were some limitations in our study. The data were collected from a single 
center at a certain timepoint. So, the sample size was relatively limited. And

large-sample cohort studies are still needed to verify this in the future. 
In conclusion, hepatic injury is likely a complication of COVID-19 infection. 
Inflammatory cytokine storm may be the major mechanism. Early detection and 
timely treatment are helpful for the recovery of liver function.
