Abstract
Small-for-size graft (SFSG) syndrome after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is the dysfunction of a small graft, 
characterized by coagulopathy, cholestasis, ascites, and encephalopathy. It is a serious complication of LDLT and usually 
triggered by excessive portal fow transmitted to the allograft in the postperfusion setting, resulting in sinusoidal congestion 
and hemorrhage. Portal overfow injures the liver directly through nutrient excess, endothelial activation, and sinusoidal 
shear stress, and indirectly through arterial vasoconstriction. These conditions may be attenuated with portal fow modulation. Attempts have been made to control excessive portal fow to the SFSG, including simultaneous splenectomy, splenic 
artery ligation, hemi-portocaval shunt, and pharmacological manipulation, with positive outcomes. Currently, a donor liver 
is considered a SFSG when the graft-to-recipient weight ratio is less than 0.8 or the ratio of the graft volume to the standard 
liver volume is less than 40%. A strategy for transplanting SFSG safely into recipients and avoiding extensive surgery in the 
living donor could efectively address the donor shortage. We review the literature and assess our current knowledge of and 
strategies for portal fow modulation in LDLT.

Introduction
Due to severe organ shortages and the increasing gap 
between supply and demand, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has become an accepted alternative to expand 
the donor pool [1-4]. Variables such as the model for the 
end-stage liver disease score, donor/recipient age, recipient body mass index, and pretransplant diagnosis reportedly 
allow for the prediction of short-term mortality after liver 
transplantation [5–7]. However, the use of partial hepatic 
grafts in LDLT can complicate the prediction [8]. Since the 
introduction of adult LDLT, graft size has become a concern, 
particularly for patients with Child class C cirrhosis and/or 
portal hypertension. Small-for-size graft (SFSG) syndrome 
after LDLT is a major complication of this procedure [9-
12]. It is defned as the dysfunction of a small graft within 
the frst 1–2 post-transplant weeks in the absence of any 
other identifable cause and is characterized by coagulopathy, cholestasis, ascites, and encephalopathy [13, 14]. A key 
mechanism of SFSG syndrome is thought to be excessive 
portal fow transmitted to the allograft in the postperfusion 
setting, resulting in sinusoidal congestion and hemorrhage 
[13]. In the setting of portal overfow, adaptive responses 
in the liver lead to vasoconstriction of the hepatic artery 
[15]. Whereas portal overflow injures the liver directly 
through nutrient excess, endothelial activation, and sinusoidal shear stress, arterial vasoconstriction introduces 
secondary ischemic damage [16, 17]. These insults may be

attenuated with portal fow modulation. Attenuating portal 
fow increases arterial fow and improves graft function [18, 
19].
Currently, a donor liver is considered a SFSG when the 
graft-to-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) is less than 0.8% 
or the ratio of the graft volume (GV) to the standard liver 
volume (SLV) is less than 40% [18, 20]. Factors other than 
the GV can potentially infuence outcomes. These factors 
include recipient-related factors such as clinical disease 
status and portal hypertension; graft-related factors such as 
donor age, steatosis, and immunological factors, and technical factors such as vascular reconstruction, adequate hepatic 
venous outfow, and vascular infow [8, 20–23]. For example, 
grafts within a wide range of GV-to-SLV ratios can tolerate 
portal hypertension if they have excellent venous outfow 
capacity, but when the ratio range is exceeded, modulation 
of vascular infow becomes necessary for graft survival [19].
One Korean group no longer measures portal pressures 
routinely. Rather, they consider establishing excellent venous 
outfow, preventing acute rejection, and having young donors 
to be key mechanisms for avoiding SFSG syndrome in grafts 
with a GRWR as small as 0.7%. That group noticed that successful SFSGs were from young donors with young recipients in whom perfect venous outfow was ensured [24]. They 
maintain that portal venous pressure (PVP)>20 mmHg is 
not associated with an increased risk of SFSG syndrome or 
graft loss, as long as perfect venous outfow is maintained 
and portal fow steal is interrupted with portosystemic shunt 
ligation [13, 24].
It is important to consider donor safety and avoid subjecting healthy living donors to excessive surgery [25–28]. A 
strategy for transplanting SFSG safely into recipients while 
avoiding excessive surgery in living donors could efectively 
address the donor shortage [20]. Several strategies to prevent SFSG syndrome, including portal fow and/or hepatic 
venous outfow modulation, have been reported [4, 9, 29]. 
Excessive portal fow and/or the reduced intrahepatic vascular bed result in higher portal fow, increased portal pressure, 
and stress at the hepatic sinusoid [30, 31]. To reduce the risk 
of these factors, diferent portal fow modulation techniques 
have been described. We review the relevant literature and 
assess the current knowledge of and strategies for portal fow 
modulation in LDLT.
Splenectomy
Generally, splenectomy is performed to reduce the bleeding tendency resulting from thrombocytopenia, or as part of 
surgical procedures such as devascularization of the upper 
stomach and esophageal transection to control variceal hemorrhage. It is also performed for hematologic disease such as 
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, splenic tumors such 
as malignant lymphoma, trauma, splenic artery aneurysm, 
and liver or renal transplantation from an ABO-incompatible donor [32]. In rodent models, splenectomy improves 
the vascular compliance of the graft and increases hepatic 
serotonin, which plays a signifcant role in hepatic perfusion 
through its vasodilatory efects [33, 34]. Hepatic serotonin 
improves microcirculation and promotes liver regeneration by stimulating the endothelial cells to release vascular endothelial growth factor. It also protects the graft by 
increasing the microcirculation and accelerating liver regeneration [35].
Simultaneous splenectomy during LDLT improves graft 
outcomes by reducing the portal pressure and fow and 
increasing the vascular compliance of the graft [36–38]. We 
previously reported that simultaneous splenectomy reduced 
hypersplenism and prevented graft congestion resulting 
from excessive portal fow [9, 39]. In our frst report, the 
outcomes of six cases of LDLT with a left-lobe graft were 
analyzed. None of the patients who underwent splenectomy 
sufered hyperbilirubinemia or intractable ascites. Both 
portal pressure and portal vein fow decreased after splenectomy in most of the patients. To clarify whether splenectomy was benefcial for patients with a SFSG, further 
analysis was performed for patients who had a GV-to-SLV 
ratio of 40% or lower (n=50) [9]. SFSG syndrome developed in 11 of 50 patients with a GV-to-SLV ratio of 40% 
or lower, and excluding splenectomy was an independent 
risk factor for SFSG syndrome in our patients. Kaido et al. 
clarifed that overall survival rates after LDLT were signifcantly higher for patients with a fnal PVP≤15 mmHg 
than for those with a PVP>15 mmHg [40]. Therefore, they 
routinely apply a portal pressure control program that targets a fnal PVP≤15 mmHg to prevent SFSG syndrome. 
The Kyoto group recently reported re-evaluating the indications for PVP modulation, which they achieve primarily with splenectomy [41]. They found that failed PVP 
modulation (fnal PVP>15 mmHg) was associated with 
an increased incidence of SFSG syndrome and early graft 
loss. Among 38 patients with failed PVP modulation, donor 
age≥45 years and ABO incompatibility were independent 
risk factors for graft loss [41]. Survival analysis showed that 
PVP>15 mmHg was related to poor prognosis in grafts from 
either ABO-incompatible donors or from donors≥45 years 
of age, but it did not negatively afect grafts from ABOcompatible/identical donors or from donors<45 years of 
age. They concluded that PVP modulation is not necessary in all recipients. Grafts from ABO-compatible/identical donors and from donors<45 years of age can tolerate portal hypertension; however, lowering the fnal PVP 
to≤15 mmHg is necessary for patients with grafts from 
ABO-incompatible donors or from donors≥45 years of age 
[41]. In most reports, the decision to perform splenectomy 
was made after graft implantation. Portal hyperperfusion can

injure the SFSG when splenic fow is present. Therefore, we 
perform splenectomy before graft implantation to prevent 
graft injury if portal hypertension is anticipated, because of 
splenomegaly and excessive portal fow. Among 258 patients 
who underwent splenectomy for portal fow modulation during LDLT at Kyushu University, 232 (89.9%) underwent 
splenectomy before implantation. In a rodent SFSG liver 
transplant model, better outcomes were achieved when splenectomy was performed just before partial liver transplantation (LT) than after partial LT because of the direct elimination of splenic infammatory leukocytes and inhibition of 
infammatory leukocyte infltration [42].
In Japan, the benefts of simultaneous splenectomy in 
LDLT are well documented, whereas the negative efects, 
including potential adverse events such as portal venous 
thrombosis (PVT), infectious complications, pancreatic fstula, and postoperative bleeding, are not discussed in detail 
[43]. Ito et al. recently reported a signifcantly higher incidence of reoperation for postoperative hemorrhage within 
the frst postoperative week, and of lethal infectious disease as well as greater intraoperative blood loss and longer 
surgery time among recipients who undergo simultaneous 
splenectomy than among those who do not [43]. Selected 
patients in that series underwent splenectomy at the time 
of LDLT if medically indicated, but never for PVP modulation. Patients who underwent splenectomy did not have a 
lower incidence of SFSG syndrome than those who did not. 
Notably, a GV-to-SLV ratio above 40% was required and 
the donors [43] were younger than those in the Kyoto study 
(median, 35 years old vs. 45 years old, respectively) [41]. A 
vessel sealing system for dissection around the spleen and 
a vascular stapler for the splenic hilum have improved the 
ease and safety of splenectomy, even for patients with severe 
portal hypertension [9, 44]. Furthermore, the splenic artery 
is routinely ligated when simultaneous splenectomy is performed. Consequently, intraoperative blood loss and surgery 
time are not increased when simultaneous splenectomy is 
performed at our center. However, more technical refnement 
is necessary to prevent pancreatic fstula and bleeding from 
the splenic stump.
Portal vein thrombosis after splenectomy
PVT is a severe complication of LDLT that can result in 
increased morbidity and mortality [45]. The incidence of 
PVT in deceased donor LT ranges from 0.3 to 2.6% [46, 
47], and increases to 4–9% in adult LDLT with more complex surgical techniques and complicated vascular reconstructions, mainly related to shorter vessel grafts resulting 
in shorter vessel length for anastomosis [48, 49]. PVT is not 
a rare complication of splenectomy for patients with cirrhosis in a non-transplant setting [32, 50]. In patients with 
cirrhosis, decreased portal fow and the development of portosystemic collaterals are considered predisposing factors 
for PVT. Furthermore, the imbalance between coagulation 
factors and coagulation inhibitory factors resulting from 
decreased levels of coagulation inhibitory factors such as 
protein C, protein S, and antithrombin-III, may cause PVT 
in these patients [32, 50]. Kinjo et al. also reported that the 
incidence of PVT after splenectomy in a non-transplant setting was 24.3%. The independent risk factors for PVT in that 
study were large splenic vein diameter (13 mm or more) and 
low white cell count (≤ 2×103 /mm3), and spleen weight 
was correlated with splenic vein diameter and white cell 
count [51].
The relationship between splenectomy and an increased 
incidence of PVT after LDLT is not clear. Kurata et al. 
reported a very high incidence of PVT (33.3%) after LDLT 
with splenectomy, but no incidence after LDLT without splenectomy [52]. They concluded that using grafts of sufcient 
size was the key to controlling PVP and that splenectomy, 
a risk factor for PVT, should be avoided whenever possible 
in LDLT [52]. Blood stasis in the stump of the splenic vein 
results in thrombosis, which subsequently extends to the 
portal and superior mesenteric veins [32, 51, 53]. Figure 1
shows a PVT extending from the splenic vein stump after 
LDLT with simultaneous splenectomy. This patient underwent emergency thrombectomy, which was efective and 
there was no recurrence of PVT. Anticoagulant therapy was 
not given to this patient. The Kyoto group reported that the 
incidence of PVT did not difer between patients with splenectomy (5.7%) and without (2.6%), whereas the incidence 
of isolated splenic vein thrombosis was higher in patients 
with splenectomy (6.8%) and required short-term anticoagulant therapy [53]. Although patients with isolated splenic 
vein thrombosis are not given anticoagulants at Kyushu 
University, the incidence of PVT after LDLT is not higher 
at this institution than in the Kyoto group (Fig. 2). Further 
study is needed to establish whether anticoagulant therapy 
is recommended for patients with splenic vein thrombosis 
after splenectomy.
Splenic artery ligation
Splenic artery ligation (SAL) was initially applied to prevent 
thrombocytopenia in LDLT [54]. Troisi et al. proposed the 
use of SAL to resolve ascites and increase hepatic arterial 
fow in LDLT [55]. Moreover, they reported that SAL was 
a simple and efective method for decreasing portal fow 
when recipient portal venous fow did not exceed 500 ml/
min per 100 g of liver. Other techniques, such as portocaval 
shunt or portomesenteric disconnection should be considered when SAL is insufcient to relieve portal hypertension 
[56]. Therefore, SAL is an alternative to splenectomy for

reducing PVP and fow [57]. Ishizaki et al. reported their 
successful experience of LDLT using left-lobe grafts without portal fow modulation [58]. In their study, the mean 
GRWR was 0.82% and 6 of the 42 patients underwent SAL. 
At Kyushu University Hospital, recipients who underwent 
SAL had worse graft function after LDLT than those who 
underwent splenectomy [9, 39]. Moreover, the 1-year graft 
survival rate was 91.2% for recipients with splenectomy, but 
only 77.9% for those with SAL in our single-center experience. This suggests that SAL was insufcient to modulate excessive portal fow and/or pressure compared with 
splenectomy. Umeda et al. established the preoperative 
proximal splenic artery embolization technique to prevent 
intraoperative bleeding resulting from injury to the massive collateral vessels around the splenic artery [59]. They 
embolized the proximal splenic artery with interventional 
radiology 12–18 h before LDLT without complications such 
as sepsis, portal thrombus, or abscess formation. They concluded that splenic artery embolization reduced excessive 
portal fow and improved graft function, which lowered the 
incidence of SFSG syndrome and had advantages for liver 
regeneration [60]. Since patients who wait for LDLT often 
have thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, pseudoaneurysm 
of the punctured artery or bleeding around the puncture site 
should be considered and checked when performing this 
technique. Furthermore, this technique has a substantial risk

of pancreatitis and postembolization syndrome [61]. Moon 
et al. recently reported the efects of a splenic devascularization procedure to prevent various complications, including 
PVT, pancreatic fstula, and bleeding from the splenic stump 
after splenectomy [61]. They performed not only SAL but 
also ligation of the right gastroepiploic artery and division of 
the gastrosplenic ligament including the short gastric arteries 
as an alternative to splenectomy. Since arterial supply to the 
spleen is maintained by intrapancreatic collaterals from the 
superior mesenteric artery, there was no incidence of splenic 
infarction and/or abscess. The splenic volume decreased to 
60% of the original volume for 1 month after LDLT with 
splenic devascularization. Although the incidence of SFSG 
syndrome was similar in the two groups, procedure-related 
complications were less common in patients who underwent 
devascularization than in those who underwent splenectomy. 
The mean GRWR at their institution was 1.1% and splenectomy or devascularization was performed in only 10.6% 
of patients. Further studies from other institutions that use 
smaller grafts would clarify the impact of this procedure.
Portocaval shunt
Compensatory portosystemic shunts develop in about 40% 
of patients with cirrhosis and the frequency increases with 
severity [62, 63]. Large shunts can be an advantage during 
recipient hepatectomy because the efect of severe portal 
hypertension is signifcantly reduced and portal clamping 
results in less congestion in the mesenteric system [63, 64]. 
Spontaneous portosystemic shunts are commonly removed 
during standard LT because the escape of portal infow 
through collaterals (steal phenomenon) may lead to ischemic 
graft damage [65] and PVT (Fig. 3). Troisi et al. recommended that spontaneous portosystemic shunts be left in 
place when small grafts (GRWR<0.8%) with hyperkinetic 
portal fow are used in LDLT [56]. The Kyoto group reported 
that the ligation of large portosystemic shunts increases portal venous fow and to prevent the portal venous steal phenomenon after LDLT when graft resistance increases during 
rejection [40]. The Asan group reported surgical interruption of portosystemic collaterals and additional evaluation of

collaterals with intraoperative cine-portogram in recipients 
with large portosystemic shunts, which are a possible route 
of postoperative portal fow steal [61, 66, 67]. We ligate 
large shunts to maintain adequate portal fow and to prevent 
the steal phenomenon as long as the portal pressure does not 
exceed 20 mmHg after test clamping [8, 21, 68]. Balloonoccluded retrograde transvenous obliteration is a feasible 
intervention to close the remnant shunt when portal fow 
decreases because of the steal phenomenon [69]. Takatsuki 
et al. opposed mandatory ligation of shunts because 75% of 
their patients experienced no complications without ligation 
and the shunt ligation procedure can be dangerous [70].
To prevent graft failure resulting from portal hyperperfusion, diversion of the superior mesenteric fow with a mesocaval shunt was frst described for LDLT using a SFSG 
[71]. Animal experiments using a portocaval shunt in SFSG 
transplant have demonstrated that adequate decompression 
of the portal system can efectively prevent the sinusoidal 
congestion and graft injury typically seen in SFSG syndrome 
[72, 73]. A hemi-portocaval shunt reduced portal fow and 
improved patient and graft survival by preventing SFSG 
syndrome in the clinical setting [74-76]. It is important to 
rule out hepatic venous outfow obstruction before creating 
a shunt because a shunt in the presence of this obstruction 
can cause severe portal steal and graft ischemia [63]. Hemiportocaval shunts may result in excessive diversion of the 
portal fow into the systemic circulation and may lead to 
the steal phenomenon. Troisi et al. recommended measuring 
portal fow and calibrating the size of the shunt accordingly 
[75]. It remains controversial whether these shunts should 
be closed after graft regeneration occurs and liver function 
stabilizes [76, 77].
Pharmacologic manipulation
Pharmacologic manipulation is another method of portal 
fow modulation. This method is reversible, unlike surgical procedures such as splenectomy or SAL. Propranolol 
and somatostatin decrease both portal fow and portal pressure reliably and reproducibly in cirrhotic patients [78]; 
therefore, these drugs are used widely in the treatment 
of variceal bleeding [79]. A couple of studies reported 
the efect of somatostatin infusion in an animal model of 
LT with SFSG [80, 81]. Xu et al. found that somatostatin 
improved 7-day graft survival by attenuating acute-phase 
shear stress. Hessheimer et al. revealed that somatostatin 
reduced portal vein fow and protected sinusoidal endothelial cells, and that somatostatin had a cytoprotective efect 
on hepatic stellate cells [81]. In a recent randomized trial, 
Troisi et al. found that somatostatin decreased the hepatic 
venous portal gradient and preserved arterial fow to the 
graft [82]. The benefcial efects of the intraportal infusion 
of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a vasodilator with hepatoprotective efects, have been reported [83, 84]. We previously 
reported that the continuous intraportal infusion of PGE1, 
nafamostat mesylate, and a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor prevented SFSG syndrome after LDLT by attenuating 
microcirculatory insufciency [85]. Moreover, the continuous intraportal infusion of PGE1 was efective in split LT for 
two adults [86]. Microthrombus in the portal vein, caused by 
inserting an indwelling catheter when performing continuous intraportal infusion therapy, should be avoided.
In conclusion, portal fow modulation with a prudent 
combination of shunt control such as ligation or hemiportocaval shunt, a portal decompression procedure such 
as simultaneous splenectomy or SAL, and pharmacologic 
manipulation, is crucial when performing LDLT with an 
SFSG.
