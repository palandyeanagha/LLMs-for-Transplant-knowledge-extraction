Abstract
Survival rates for patients following liver 
transplantation exceed 90% at 12 months 
and approach 70% at 10 years. Part 1 of this 
guideline has dealt with all aspects of liver 
transplantation up to the point of placement 
on the waiting list. Part 2 explains the organ 
allocation process, organ donation and organ 
type and how this influences the choice of 
recipient. After organ allocation, the transplant 
surgery and the critical early post-operative 
period are, of necessity, confined to the liver 
transplant unit. However, patients will eventually 
return to their referring secondary care centre 
with a requirement for ongoing supervision. 
Part 2 of this guideline concerns three key 
areas of post liver transplantation care for 
the non-transplant specialist: (1) overseeing 
immunosuppression, including interactions and 
adherence; (2) the transplanted organ and how 
to initiate investigation of organ dysfunction; 
and (3) careful oversight of other organ 
systems, including optimising renal function, 
cardiovascular health and the psychosocial 
impact. The crucial significance of this holistic 
approach becomes more obvious as time passes 
from the transplant, when patients should expect 
the responsibility for managing the increasing 
number of non-liver consequences to lie with 
primary and secondary care.
Introduction
Following successful liver transplant (LT), 
12-month patient and graft survival rates 
in the UK exceed 90% and 80%, respectively.1
 The 10-year survival approaches 
70%, and transplant services have an 
ever-increasing population of long-term 
survivors.2 Kidney transplant services 
repatriate their transplant recipients to 
referrers soon after surgery, whereas 
liver services have historically been more 
cautious.3
 However, as numbers increase, 
some aspects of post-operative care are 
being redistributed to referrers.
Part 2 of this two-part guideline 
examines:
► Organ donation, organ allocation and 
organ types.
► LT surgery and post-operative period.
► How immunosuppression should be 
managed.
► How the patient should be managed 
post-LT.
► Transplant outcomes.
Organ donation, organ 
allocation and organ types
Organ donation
Figure 1 outlines the source of organs and 
their relative contributions.4–6
Organ allocation
Organ allocation has long been debated 
across many healthcare systems. Organs 
can be allocated according to ‘need’ 
(sickest first), ‘utility’ (best use of organ) 
or ‘benefit’ (combines need and utility). 
Most countries have adopted need as the 
main criterion. The UK recently agreed 
to use the Transplant Benefit Score (TBS) 
to allocate donor after brain death (DBD) 
livers, and it is likely that donor after 
cardiac death (DCD) livers will follow 
the same process. TBS contains 21 donor 
and recipient variables, including donor 
age, cause of death, body mass index 
(BMI), diabetes, recipient’s indication for 
transplant, creatinine, sodium, bilirubin,

albumin, waiting time, maximum tumour size and 
number of tumours. The National Liver Offering 
Scheme ensures a complete de-linking between organ 
retrieval and allocation.7 Variant syndromes are allocated livers in proportion to the number on the waiting 
list.
Organ types
DCD grafts are usually whole livers but, if of sufficient 
quality, can be ‘split’ and transplanted into a child and
adult. Partial grafts carry additional risks,8 so factors 
such as donor age, time on the intensive care unit and 
obesity will aid donor-team decision-making. All grafts 
risk transmission of malignancy and viruses so donor 
screening, transmission recognition and reporting 
facilitate accurate estimation of these risks.9
Liver transplantation surgery and the 
post-operative period
The recipient’s LT operation commences when the 
surgeon is assured of donor organ size, quality and 
anatomy. Hence, some recipients will experience a 
‘false start’ if the organ quality is poor; however, if 
the organ is suitable, surgery will proceed (figure 2
outlines the order of surgery).
Figure 3 and online supplementary appendix 1 outline 
the post-LT complications. These can be broadly divided 
into immediate and early complications. Any major 
abdominal procedure carries a risk of bleeding and infection in the immediate post-operative period. The additional, more specific, surgical complications relate to the 
various vessel anastamoses (figure 2), including portal 
vein thrombosis, hepatic artery thrombosis and biliary 
leak or stricture. Live donor liver transplant (LDLT) 
and DCD allograft recipients are more prone to biliary 
and vascular complications. Hepatic artery stenosis and 
rare complications such as primary non-function may
require re-graft,10 so all listed recipients are warned of 
this possibility. Conversely, portal vein thrombosis and 
biliary complications can usually be managed without 
the need for further surgery. These ‘immediate’ complications arise in the first few days and hence will all be 
managed in the liver transplant unit (LTU). Complications arising after the first week or so (see figure 3) 
include the ever-present risk of hepatic artery thrombosis, the emerging risk of organ rejection and diverse 
infections, including those related to graft transmission 
and immunosupression.
How should immunosuppression be 
managed in the clinic?
Most LT recipients require lifelong immunosuppression, although some develop ‘operational tolerance’ 
and can maintain graft health without immunosuppression.11 12 Maximum immunosuppression is 
required early post-transplant, when rejection risk is 
greatest. Frequently used agents are shown in online 
supplementary appendix 2. The most common regimens include13

or without corticosteroids.

Immunosuppression is associated with significant 
side effects, which may be related to immunosuppression itself (such as increased risk of some cancers 
and infections) or drug-specific side effects (such as 
steroid-associated osteopenia or CNI-associated renal 
impairment) as in table 1. Golden rules for managing 
immunosuppression are outlined below, and the LTU’s 
pharmacist is an additional important resource.
Golden rules with immunosuppressants
1. Always use the same brand of CNI and do not interchange.
2. CNI and mTOR inhibitor (mTORi) doses should be 
informed by the use of therapeutic drug monitoring 
(TDM).
3. Target trough whole blood levels for the stable recipient 
are usually between 3 and 8 ng/L for tacrolimus and between 80 and 100μg/L for cyclosporin.
4. For ‘trough’ CNI drug levels, ensure that the patient has 
not taken their drug on the morning of the blood test.
5. Always check any new prescriptions for potential drug–
drug interactions.
6. The development of side effects does not necessarily 
equate with over-immunosuppression.
Immunosuppression regimens
Immunosuppression regimens vary considerably between 
units and individuals. The choice of immunosuppressive 
regimen is dependent on many factors, including
1. Time after transplant. Induction regimens (not included 
in these guidelines) use antilymphocytes agents and interleukin-2 receptor blockade: with increasing time after 
transplantation, the immunosuppressive burden can be 
reduced. Sirolimus (mTORi) is deferred for 3 months 
as it impairs wound healing and risks hepatic artery 
thrombosis.14
2. Indication for transplant. Many LTUs use long-term corticosteroids in autoimmune conditions,15 whereas highdose steroids promote viral replication in active hepatitis 
C virus (HCV) infection.
3. Acute and/or chronic rejection episodes.
4. History or risk of cancer. mTORi may reduce the risk of 
some de novo cancers.
5. Complications of previous immunosuppression therapy.
6. Wish of recipient or partner to conceive and/or breast 
feed (mycophenolate and mTORi are teratogenic).
7. Renal impairment. For those with pre-transplant renal 
impairment, drug regimens with reduced CNI exposure 
may be appropriate.
8. Comorbid diseases. Diabetes mellitus or significant osteopenia is exacerbated by steroids. Azathioprine is 
frequently used in patients with inflammatory bowel 
diseaserequiring LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC).
There are few prospective, large-scale trials comparing
different immunosuppressive regimens and these mostly 
focus on relatively short-term outcomes (<1year), so the

evidence base for immunosuppression is often based on 
retrospective analysis and clinical experience.
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
immunosuppressants
TDM is used to adjust the dose of some drugs, especially CNI and mTORi. Usually, trough levels are used 
to direct therapy with higher target levels in the earlier 
post-operative period. TDM 2hours after ingestion 
has been advocated for ciclosporin but is rarely used.16
TDM for mycophenolate has been advocated but is 
not used in routine practice.17
Drug metabolism is affected by many factors, 
including preparation and formulation, whether the 
medication is taken with food, co-morbid disease 
(including replicating HCV), intercurrent infections 
(especially diarrhoea or vomiting), change in liver 
function, use of other drugs (including herbal remedies) and genetic factors (such as CYP3A5 isoenzymes for CNI and thiopurine methyltransferase for 
azathioprine).
There are different preparations of the commonly 
prescribed agents available and different preparations 
with different pharmacodynamic profiles. For example, 
different preparations of tacrolimus are licensed for 
once daily or twice daily dosing and generic preparations that do not all have bioequivalence. Prolongedrelease tacrolimus may be more cost-effective than two 
times per day release and may be associated with better 
outcomes.18 The MHRA has advised that the growing 
number of oral tacrolimus products available increases 
the potential for inadvertent switching between products, which has been associated with toxicity and graft 
rejection.19 Similar considerations apply to formulations of ciclosporin. Therefore, to ensure maintenance 
of therapeutic response when a patient is stabilised on 
a particular brand, oral tacrolimus products should 
be prescribed and dispensed by brand name only. If 
a prescriber considers that switching a patient to a 
different brand of oral tacrolimus would be of benefit, 
the change requires careful supervision and therapeutic monitoring by an appropriate specialist. There 
is some evidence that a significant variation in trough 
levels may be associated with a worse outcome.20 21
Similarly, mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate 
mofetil are not interchangeable.
Adherence post LT
The rate of non-adherence to immunosuppression
regimes approaches 40% in some studies22 (although 
non-adherence definitions are inconsistent across
studies). Reasons for non-adherence vary between 
age groups and include side-effect profiles, perceived
harm, changes to physical appearance and psychological distress. At all clinic visits, non-adherence
should be considered and discussed with patients and 
their family, ideally by the specialist pharmacist.23
How should the patient be managed after 
LT?
Following discharge after LT, patients are reviewed 
weekly by their LTU. In many LTU’s, the surgical team 
supervises the first 3 months post surgery. Depending 
on the complexity of surgery, distance to travel and 
post-operative complications, patients can expect to be

‘weaned off’ their weekly transplant clinic visit as care is 
increasingly shared with their local hospital (see box 1).
Post-LT survival has been steadily rising for the 
last 20years.24 Improved surgical expertise, better 
patient selection and better immunosuppression have 
contributed, such that non-liver causes such as malignancy (22%), cardiovascular disease (11%), infection 
(9%) and renal failure (6%) are the leading causes of 
mortality 1year post surgery.25 Beyond 12 months, the 
metabolic syndrome emerges as being of increasing 
relevance to recipients.
Graft dysfunction
Most LT recipients return to their referrers outpatients with normal or stable LFTs. Any variance 
should be investigated thoroughly (table 2) to include 
a check of adherence, any new medication and an 
ultrasound scan (with Doppler). Further investigation of graft dysfunction for infection, rejection and 
disease recurrence will likely take place at the LTU 
and are outlined further:
Rejection
Rejection should be considered if liver biochemistry 
deteriorates post-LT. The classification of liver allograft rejection has recently been revised by the Banff 
Working Group26 (see online supplementary appendix 
3). The most common form is T cell-mediated rejection where symptoms include fever, fatigue, jaundice 
and liver tenderness, which may occur with a rising 
transaminase and, possibly, leucocytosis. A biopsy is 
usually mandatory (see online supplementary appendix 
3 for interpretation and management) and should be 
forwarded to the LTU as accurate interpretation is critical. Antibody-mediated rejection is rare and a detailed 
discussion is beyond the scope of this review. Chronic 
rejection (also termed ‘ductopenic’ rejection) typically 
occurs several months or more post-LT and is potentially reversible, so a liver biopsy with expert interpretation is mandatory.
Infection
► CMV infection usually occurs in a virus-naïve recipient 
receiving an organ from a previously infected donor. 
In such instances, the recipient will receive 6 months 
of oral valgancyclovir as prophylaxis. CMV infection 
causes fever, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms with 
neutropenia and positive CMV PCR.
► During the first 6 months post-LT, opportunistic infections such as those caused by Aspergillus can appear, and 
latent infections such as those caused by Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis may be reactivated.
► Beyond 6 months, immunosuppression is frequently 
reduced, so infections then align with those seen in 
the non-immunosuppressed population. In addition, 
post-LT prophylactic agents such as co-trimoxazole, 
valganciclovir and isoniazid usually stop between 3 and 
6 months post-LT and should be considered if new infections appear.
► Chronic hepatitis E is under-recognised and should be 
considered in any LT recipient developing graft dysfunction. A positive hepatitis E PCR may require ribavirin 
treatment.27
Disease recurrence
Following LT, disease recurrence frequently occurs:
► Hepatitis B requires ongoing viral suppression.
► Untreated hepatitis C requires clearance post LT.
► Non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can return, especially if obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia 
and diabetes control worsen post-LT.
► Alcohol-related liver disease—addiction services and 
open discussion with patient.
► PBC recurrence is found in up to 50% at 5 years. Ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO) is often used, but there is limited 
experience with obeticholic acid.
► PSC recurs in up to 70% at 5 years; there is no effective treatment, although ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 
is sometimes used.
Renal dysfunction
The cumulative incidence of end-stage renal failure 
(ESRF) post-LT was 4% in Fisher’s series at 10 years,28
while the frequency of chronic kidney disease at this 
time, approaches 25%.29 The longer the follow-up, 
the more renal dysfunction occurs, and this is associated with substantial cardiovascular mortality and 
morbidity. Poor pre-operation renal function, along 
with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and CNIs, are the 
major determinants of declining post-transplant renal 
function.29
Cardiovascular disease
Despite careful evaluation pre-surgery, cardiovascular 
risk increases post-LT. The proportion of transplant 
recipients with pre-existing metabolic syndrome is 
increasing as the population’s median BMI rises.30 A 
recent retrospective study from the USA identified a 
new cardiovascular disease within 8 years of surgery 
in almost a third of all LT recipients.31 Significant risk 
factors included age, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
<60mL/min/1.73m2 and prior cardiovascular disease. 
Careful attention to risk factors and lifestyle is important in all recipients.
Post-transplant development of diabetes mellitus
Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) increases 
the risk of infection and cardiovascular events, and 
decreases graft and recipient survival as well as quality 
of life (QOL).32 Risk factors for development of 
PTDM include HCV infection, male gender, corticosteroid use, pre-LT diabetes and CNI (tacrolimus>ciclosporin).

Liver
Box 1 Management of post liver transplant (LT) patient in the clinic
General
► Careful drug history to ensure no new renal toxins have been started.
► Adherence.
► Careful blood pressure (BP) monitoring aiming for a systolic BP of <140mmHg and a diastolic BP of <85mmHg. Home 
monitoring may be necessary.
► BMI monitoring, monitoring weight in non-obese and advice on weight reduction in obese patients.
Abnormal liver function tests (LFT)
► Check medications, including herbal remedies.
► Ultrasound liver for space-occupying lesion and biliary anastamotic stricture, and Doppler of hepatic artery and portal vein for 
patency.
► Viral hepatitis screen to include hepatitis A, B, C and E; cytomegalovirus (CMV); and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
► Consider liver biopsy (disease recurrence or rejection).
Renal dysfunction
► Close monitoring is necessary.
► Mycophenolate mofetil use enables CNI dose reduction.
► Seek help from multidisciplines, especially diabetologists and nephrologists.
► Seek help early as, once lost, renal function tends not to recover.
Cardiovascular disease
► Statins are safe and appropriate.
► Continue CNI but minimise use of statins with cyclosporin, and in patients on sirolimus, carefully monitor lipids.
► Use of cardiovascular risk scores such as QRISK .
Post-transplant diabetes
► Ensure close control with regular evaluation.
► Effective management of glucose control.
► No particular advantage of one antidiabetic drug over another.
► Rapid minimisation of steroids if safe.
Hypertension
► Careful choice of antihypertensive, always check drug–drug interactions.
► First line: calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, reduce systemic vascular resistance and improve renal blood flow with 
minimal side effects and no interactions with CNI.
► β-Blockers are safe and widely used.
► Drugs that block the renin–angiotensin system, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, are best avoided in 
the early post-operative period when plasma renin activity is low and can exacerbate the hyperkalaemia seen with CNIs. The 
renin–angiotensin system does recover later in the post-transplant period, and then these drugs can be useful.
► Diuretics can damage renal function and are best avoided.
Dyslipidaemia
► Aggressive management is necessary.
► Dietary interventions have little effect on dyslipidaemia.
► Long-term corticosteroid use can also contribute to hyperlipidaemia, so attempting to minimise corticosteroid use long-term is 
appropriate.
► Sirolimus is associated with high rates of dyslipidaemia.
► Statins are usually safe, efficacious and well tolerated post-LT.
► Pravastatin and atorvostatin appear effective, have little significant interactions with CNI and are well tolerated.
► Hypertriglyceridemia with normal cholesterol levels is also common post-LT.
Obesity
► Advice and education of patient and family on the waiting list prior to surgery.
► Early resumption of advice and weight supervision post surgery.
► Diet education is critical at the early stage, and exercise becomes possible once wounds have healed.
► Minimise length of steroid use in obese recipients.
► Place similar emphasis on dangers of weight gain as is placed on the other core issues (including rejection and infection) in the 
early post-transplant period.
► All options, including surgical and medical solutions, are possible in the post-LT patient, as per standard protocols.
Smoking
► All patients should be rigorously questioned over tobacco use.

Box 1 Continued
► Patients should be actively and repeatedly encouraged to stop smoking.
► Use of nicotine patches safe pre-LT and post-LT.
► Careful education of patients in how to identify early signs of head and neck cancer in this group.
Osteoporosis
► All patients with chronic liver disease should have a bone densitometry scan, regardless of whether they are being assessed for 
transplantation.
► Minimise corticosteroid and heparin use and avoid loop diuretics as these drugs promote osteoporosis.
► Optimise calcium and vitamin D intake.
► Maintain weight-bearing exercise.
► Consider rrepeat bone densitometry scan at 12 months post-transplant.
► Prevention and treatment should be consistent with national guidance.
► Note that bisphosphonates are both safe and effective post-transplant.
Alcohol
► Check for alcohol use post-LT.
► Ensure addiction services are being used, where appropriate.
► Facilitate honest and open discussions with patient and family over alcohol, drug and tobacco use.
Cancer
► Transplant recipients should avoid sun exposure, wear a hat and use factor 50 sunscreen.
► Patients should participate in national screening programmes (cervical, breast and bowel).
► Patients must be told to seek urgent dermatological opinion if skin changes are noticed, and every recipient should have a 
total skin review (head to toe) annually, to look for moles, basal cell carcinoma and other skin tumours (annual ‘MOT’).
► Specific questions on smoking should be asked at every clinic review and appropriate advice provided.

Malignancy Primary or secondary
LFT, Liver Function Test.
Post-transplant systemic hypertension
Pre-LT, arterial hypertension is rare, but most recipients develop hypertension following LT.33 Corticosteroids and CNIs are largely responsible.34
Post-transplant development of dyslipidaemia
Patients requiring lipid-lowering agents pre-LT should 
continue after surgery. Advanced liver disease lowers 
cholesterol levels because of impaired hepatic synthesis 
and esterification; however, patients with cholestatic 
liver disease may have high serum cholesterol levels if the 
liver synthetic function is preserved.35 Hyperlipidaemia 
is more frequent with ciclosporin than tacrolimus.36
Obesity
Obesity occurs in almost half of LT recipients in 
some series.37 Virtually all of those obese pretransplant remain so, and in those who were normal 
weight pre-LT, a third will become obese. Important 
factors include improved appetite and corticosteroid 
use, coupled with the reversal of cirrhosis, effectively 
removing the associated catabolic state. The cardiovascular mortality and morbidity rise, along with renal 
disease and non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), 
in the recipient’s graft.38
Post-transplant smoking
Up to a quarter of patients in centres around the world 
will be regularly smoking tobacco at the time of their 
LT.39 While the European Association for the Study 
of the Liver (EASL) recommends abstinence before 
listing, UK transplant centres do not take an ‘absolutist’ 
view.40 Cigarette smoking promotes fibrosis in hepatitis C, PBC and alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD) 
and probably increases the likelihood of hepatoma 
developing . The data on graft and recipient survival 
are conflicting with respect to tobacco smoking, but 
cardiovascular disease is certainly more prevalent.41
Osteoporosis
Inadequate bone density is very common in the endstage liver disease population.42 More advanced 
chronic liver disease and cholestatic liver diseases are 
associated with more advanced bone loss. Within the 
first 12 months after LT, bone density rapidly deteriorates, predisposing to fractures.43
Post-transplant alcohol use and misuse
All LT candidates are questioned over alcohol use, 
regardless of indication. Depending on definitions 
used, up to a quarter of patients transplanted for ArLD 
return to potential harmful consumption levels, and

twice that many will return to some sort of alcohol 
use.44 45 When significant relapse occurs after LT, the 
rate of graft damage rises, as does mortality.
For patients transplanted for non-ArLD indications, 
standard advice to maintain alcohol intake below 14 
units/week is appropriate.
Cancer
The risk of malignancy, particularly skin cancers and 
lymphoma, rises in LT recipients.46 Cancer of the lung, 
head,neck and colon are more common, whereas prostate and breast cancers have a similar prevalence to 
age-matched and sex-matched controls.
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is
usually EBV driven and usually occurs in the first 12 
months post-LT. While classical symptoms of fever, 
night sweats and weight loss are seen, they can sometimes be more subtle. Therapy is initiated by reducing 
immunosuppression combined with standard chemotherapy techniques.
Online supplementary appendix 4 displays a specimen outpatient proforma.
Outcomes of LT
This section examines patient (table 3) and organ 
(table 4) survival, as well as other outcome parameters, 
such as QOL, return to employment and psychosexual 
outcomes.
Patient outcomes
Patient survival times (table 3) reported in the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR) show that 
survival depends on the indication and the age of 
the recipient. However, there is a cohort effect, and 
long-term patient and graft survival has been steadily 
improving over the last 20 years.
Graft outcomes
Graft survival times (table 4) reported in the ELTR 
demonstrate that re-grafts do not last as long as the 
first organ transplanted.
Psychosocial outcomes following LT
Quality of life
Assessing successful outcomes following LT has 
historically focused on survival rates for both the 
patient and graft. More recently, with ever improving 
‘hard’ outcomes, it is becoming recognised that 
measures of a successful LT should include aspects of 
Quality of Life (QOL).47 48 Evaluation of outcomes 
according to QOL following LT are limited due to 
the lack of a standardised framework for evaluation 
and data collection; the generic health assessment 
questionnaires are the most widely published (Short 
Form 36 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Score) but are limited by their lack of disease-specific
elements.49
Generic heath-related quality of life (HR-QOL)
improves following LT, and improvements are similar 
to outcomes in kidney, heart and lung transplant 
recipients; however, HR-QOL scores fail to return to
that of sex-matched and age-matched healthy individuals.50 Improvements are most marked in the first 
2 years following LT, with positive changes in psychological, physical, social, personal and overall health 
perceptions.51 Assessment of anxiety and depression, specifically, shows a decline in the longer term, 
reported for 2 years after LT, secondary to concerns 
regarding disease recurrence and accruement of 
comorbidities accentuated by immunosuppression 
use. Conversely, improvements in physical functioning and overall life satisfaction scores appear 
more sustained over time.51
Employment
LT recipients who return to work have a significantly 
better QOL compared with those who are unemployed. The percentage of recipients who return to 
work varies from 26% to 57% and is dependent on 
time from LT and disease aetiology.52 53
Sexual function and pregnancy
Sexual function and fertility improves following 
LT but does not reach that of healthy age-matched
and sex-matched individuals with reports of
decreased libido, difficulty in reaching orgasm, 
erectile dysfunction and reduced satisfaction.54–56
For men, erectile dysfunction usually improves 
post-LT but remains in some due to a combination 
of medication, comorbidities and depression.56 57
Sexual health in women has been less well studied; 
however, dysfunction following LT correlates with 
a reduction in QOL.56 Fertility can return as early 
as 1 month post-LT. Fertility should be discussed 
with all women of childbearing age following

transplantation; pre-conception counselling and 
multidisciplinary management of the pregnancy 
will result in the best possible outcome. Pregnancy 
should be avoided for the first post-LT year due 
to its association with acute cellular rejection.58 59
Pregnancy following LT is associated with a live 
birth rate of 70% but with an increased risk of foetal 
loss, prematurityand low birth weight whilst the 
mother is more likely to develop hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and graft dysfunction.58 59 Immunosupression should be continued 
throughout pregnancy with the exception of mycophenolate or sirolimus/everolimus, which are teratogenic.
Physical activity and diet post-LT
After LT, functional capacity improves, although 
exercise capacity remains lower than that of agematched controls.60 Only 25% of recipients are 
physically active after LT, and more than two-thirds
consume more than the recommended calorie 
intake.61 Data to support benefit in targeted exercise/nutritional programmes post-LT are emerging, 
although these have yet to demonstrate an impact on 
metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality.62 Obesity is a growing problem, with 
>30% being obese at 3 years, with older age at transplant and transplant for chronic as opposed to acute 
liver failure being risk factors.
Conclusions
► Liver transplantation improves the quantity and quality 
of life of patients with advanced liver disease.
► The number of organs available for liver transplantation 
has steadily increased over recent years and is associated 
with increasing numbers of long-term survivors.
► After the first year, most patients will be cared for 
primarily by their local gastroenterologist/hepatologist.
► Immunosuppression requires careful management to 
maximise protection from the immune system while 
minimising harm to other organs.
► Early post-transplant complications include technical, 
infection and immunological issues.
► With time, complications related to the metabolic 
syndrome and associated cardiovascular risks become 
increasingly prevalent.

Contributors There were 20 authors involved in the production 
of these two articles concerning liver transplantation. The 
original project was divided into an Introduction, nine sections 
and a Conclusion. From that original outline, the sections 
were written by writing groups and then collated. The nine 
sections were then divided into two halves for the purposes 
of publication, after discussion with the editor of Frontline 
Gastroenterology. Each contributor provided editing input to 
the project, as the manuscript went through its many iterations. 
The specific contribution/participation of each contributor are 
as follows: CM (consultant hepatologist in a DGH): senior 
author; initiated section divisions, collected manuscripts; 
contributed to writing by adding DGH aspects to all part 1 
and management of the post-transplant patient section; edited 
all tables and oversaw the process; responsible for the overall 
content as guarantor. AC: consultant pharmacist; cowrote the 
section on immunosuppression agents in part 2 with JN and 
gave input to part 1, particularly with the ‘disease-specific 
considerations’ and where medication interactions can occur. 
MEC: consultant transplant hepatologist; coauthored the 
section on 'management of the patient on the waiting list' and 
then read both parts 1 and 2 of the final submission as an 
additional critique for all sections; critical role in the planning 
and acquisition of data for inclusion into the guideline, along 
with evaluation of relevance to the project; final manuscript 
editing and approval. AH: consultant transplant hepatologist; 
coauthored the section on 'how to refer' and then drew up the 
tables and added valuable additional input, as well as rewrote 
participation for the sections when the original submission was 
too lengthy; critical role in planning, final manuscript editing 
and approval. SH: consultant histopathologist; wrote the 
section on cellular rejection in part 2; added valuable oversight 
in part 1, particularly as both parts were too lengthy and 
required significant reduction in word count. JH: consultant 
hepatologist in a DGH; wrote the section on transplant 
assessment and with KJ refined this section to focus on the 
DGH referrer, and also read both completed parts to provide 
the DGH perspective on these elements of liver transplantation 
and ensure focus was correct for that audience; critical role 
in planning and acquisition of data for inclusion into part 
1 of the guideline, along with an evaluation of relevance to 
the project; editing and approval of parts 1 and 2 of the final 
manuscript. KJ: transplant coordinator; provided the section 
on the transplant coordinator and then gave critical input for 
aspects on process of organ selection, along with RP; critical 
role in the planning and acquisition of data for inclusion in the 
guideline, along with evaluation of relevance to the project; 
final manuscript editing and approval. JL: consultant transplant 
hepatologist; coauthored the section on 'how to refer' and 
provided editorial input for part 2; critical role in the planning

evaluation of relevance to the project; final manuscript editing 
and approval. JN: consultant transplant hepatologist; wrote 
the section on post-transplant Immunosuppression with the 
aid of AC; also contributed to part 1 in an editorial role, when 
he helped with the original concept; provided a critical role 
following the original guideline production and prior to its 
splitting into two halves (parts 1 and 2) and ensuring correct 
focus was maintained when the manuscript was reduced in size. 
RP: consultant transplant surgeon; wrote the section on organ 
allocation and donation; also made a significant contribution 
to the postoperative care and complications sections and the 
preop evaluation (part 1); critical role in the planning and 
acquisition of data for inclusion in the guideline, along with 
evaluation of relevance to the project; final manuscript editing 
and approval. AP: liver pharmacist; contributed to part 2, 
immunosupression section, but also gave useful input into 
parts 1 and 2 from the point of view of medication and drug 
interactions, particularly with viral hepatitis treatment; critical 
role in evaluating data for inclusion in the guideline, along with 
maintaining relevance to the project; final manuscript editing 
and approval. WP: consultant in palliative care; authored 
the section on palliative care and transplantation in part 1; 
contributed in part 2 via proofreading and providing critical 
input; critical role in the planning and acquisition of data for 
inclusion in the guideline, along with evaluation of relevance 
to the project; final manuscript editing and approval. LS: 
transplant coordinator; contributed to the section on how to 
refer a patient for liver transplant (part 1) and gave input into 
the section on organ allocation (part 2); critical role in the 
planning and acquisition of data for inclusion in the guideline, 
along with evaluation of relevance to the project; final

two halves; critical role in planning and acquisition of data for 
inclusion into guideline, along with evaluation of relevance to 
project; final manuscript editing and approval. DTh and RW: 
consultant transplant hepatologists; coauthored the section 
on transplant outcomes; provided critical input into part 1 as 
well, with respect to the referral process; critical role in the 
planning and acquisition of data for inclusion in guideline, 
along with evaluation of relevance to the project; final 
manuscript editing and approval. DTr: consultant transplant 
hepatologist; coauthored the section on postoperative care and 
complications (non-surgical); also supported the entire process 
by helping the lead author with editing sections and discussion 
of tables and pictures and deciding on section inclusion, data 
relevance and final manuscript editing and approval.
