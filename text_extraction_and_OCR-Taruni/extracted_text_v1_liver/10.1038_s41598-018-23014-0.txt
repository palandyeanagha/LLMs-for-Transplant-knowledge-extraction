This study aimed to investigate the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its 
severity with the decline in kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted 
a cohort study of 1,525 CKD patients who underwent repeated health check-up examinations from 
January 2003 through December 2013. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography and its severity was 
assessed by the NAFLD fbrosis score. At baseline, the prevalence of NAFLD was 40.9%, and the mean 
estimated glomerular fltration rate (eGFR) was 59.1ml/min/1.73m2. The average follow-up was 6.5 
years. The age- and sex-adjusted decline in eGFR was greater in patients with NAFLD (−0.79% per year, 
95% CI −1.31%, −0.27%) compared to those without it (0.30%, 95% CI −0.14%, 0.76%; p=0.002). 
In multivariable adjusted models, the average diference in annual percent change in decline in eGFR 
comparing patients with NAFLD to those without NAFLD was −1.06% (−1.73%, −0.38%; p=0.002). 
The decline in eGFR associated with NAFLD was greater in patients with higher NAFLD fbrosis score, 
in those with proteinuria or with low eGFR at baseline (<45ml/min/1.73m2), and in those who were 
smokers and hypertensive. Therefore, NAFLD is independently associated with CKD progression.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and is rapidly becoming a major 
burden to the global health care system1,2
. Te global prevalence of CKD was estimated at 10.4–13.4%3. End-stage 
renal disease (ESRD), the last stage of CKD requiring renal replacement therapy, is rapidly increasing worldwide 
and expected to further increase in the next decade4
. Tere is a substantial interest in identifying novel and potentially reversible causes of progression from early stages of CKD to ESRD.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation without signifcant alcohol intake, use of medications causing fatty liver, or other traditional causes of fatty liver, is the most 
common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, especially in developed countries5,6
. Te global prevalence of 
NAFLD was estimated at 25.2%7
. Furthermore, the consequences of NAFLD extend beyond the liver8. NAFLD 
is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease9–11, and with increased prevalence 
and incidence of CKD12–14. No study, however, has evaluated the role of NAFLD on the decline in kidney function

among patients who already have reduced kidney function (CKD stage 3 or more). NAFLD is frequently accompanied by multiple traditional risk factors for CKD progression including obesity and diabetes, but evidence 
supporting the independent role of NAFLD on CKD progression is still lacking.
We thus investigated the association of NAFLD and its severity with the longitudinal decline in kidney function in a cohort of CKD patients, adjusting for traditional risk factors for CKD.
Results
Te mean (standard deviation, SD) age of study patients was 60.8 (11.3) years, and the prevalence of NAFLD at 
baseline was 40.9% (Table 1). Compared to patients without NAFLD, those with NAFLD were more likely to be 
young, male, smokers, and had a higher level of body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and other metabolic 
risk factors. Te mean estimated glomerular fltration rate (eGFR) at baseline was 59.1ml/min/1.73m2
 (26.2% 
patients had proteinuria ≥2+on urinalysis). While eGFR at baseline was higher in patients with NAFLD compared to those without NAFLD at baseline (61.8 vs. 57.3ml/min/1.73m2
, p<0.001), patients with NAFLD had 
higher proportion of proteinuria than those without NAFLD (30.2 vs. 23.5%, p=0.004).
Te average duration of follow-up was 6.5 years (maximum 13.6 years; average number of visits per participant 
6.3). During follow-up, the age- and sex-adjusted decline in eGFR was greater in patients with NAFLD (−0.79% 
per year, 95% CI −1.31%, −0.27%) compared to those without it (0.30%, 95% CI −0.14%, 0.76%; p=0.002).
Afer adjustment for age, sex, and year of visit, the average diference in annual percent change of eGFR 
between patients with NAFLD and those without NAFLD was −1.09% (−1.89%, −0.27%; p=0.009; Table 2). 
Te results did not materially change afer adjusting for confounders or potential metabolic mediators. Te multivariable adjusted average diference in annual percent changes in eGFR comparing patients with low NAFLD 
fbrosis score (NFS) (<−1.455) or intermediate to high NFS (≥−1.455) and those without NAFLD were 0.01% 
(−0.74%, 0.99%) and −2.12% (−2.93%, −1.31%), respectively (Table 2).

Te association between NAFLD and CKD progression was also observed in patients with only eGFR<60ml/
min/1.73m2
, with only proteinuria, or with both at baseline (Table 3). Te association between NAFLD and the 
decline in eGFR was consistent across most subgroups (Fig. 1), although the decline in eGFR associated with 
NAFLD appeared to be stronger among patients who were current smokers (p for interaction<0.01), hypertensive (p for interaction=0.02), and those with lower eGFR at baseline (p for interaction<0.01).
Among patients with eGFR<45 ml/min/1.73 m2
 at baseline (Supplementary Table S1), the multivariable 
adjusted average diference in annual percent change of eGFR between patients with NAFLD and those without 
NAFLD was −5.61% (−11.43%, 0.59%; p=0.075; Table 4).
Discussion
In this large longitudinal study, NAFLD was an independent risk factor associated with the progression of CKD. 
Te association was stronger in patients with more advanced NAFLD, as indicated by a higher fbrosis score, in 
those with lower eGFR, in those with proteinuria, and in patients who were current smokers, and hypertensive. 
Furthermore, the association did not appear to be mediated by traditional risk factors associated with NAFLD. 
To our knowledge, this is the frst report to implicate NAFLD as an important risk factor for CKD progression. 
Further research needs to consider the clinical impact of screening for and managing NAFLD in CKD patients.
Te control of CKD progression is still an unresolved issue4,15. Few specifc treatments delay the progression of CKD, especially in patients with advanced CKD, so that identifying risk factors or mediators other than 
diabetes or hypertension is critically important. NAFLD is a common comorbidity in CKD patients. Although 
several studies have evaluated the association of NAFLD and CKD, most of them were cross-sectional and did 
not address the role of NAFLD in CKD progression16–18. Similarly, several studies have identifed an association 
between NAFLD and proteinuria16–21, but a longitudinal association of NAFLD with kidney function decline in 
CKD patients had not been evaluated.
Several mechanisms may explain a role of NAFLD in CKD progression. NAFLD is associated with the activation of the nuclear factor-κB and the C-Jun-N-terminal kinase pathways, which enhance transcription of several proinfammatory genes that amplify systemic chronic infammation and insulin resistance, respectively22–26. 
Tese pathways may facilitate CKD progression by augmenting intrarenal immunologic infammatory responses 
in CKD, especially in glomerulonephritis where the main pathogenic mechanism is immunologic reaction27. 
Te fnal common pathologic features in CKD progression are glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy accompanied by interstitial fbrosis28–30. Pro-infammatory milieu in NAFLD may accelerate the development of these 
pathological features in patients with CKD even in patients in whom the initial pathogenic mechanism was not 
immunologic.
In our study, the association of NAFLD with kidney function decline was stronger in current smokers, and in 
those who were hypertensive or who had baseline eGFR<45ml/min/1.73m2
. Tis fnding suggests specifc subgroups may beneft most from screening, prevention and management of NAFLD. Te importance of smoking 
cessation and hypertension control for attenuating CKD progression has been documented in many studies and 
emphasized in the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines31–34. Te interplay between NAFLD 
and traditional risk factors of CKD, however, has not been fully elucidated35–38. Further studies should focus on 
the interaction between NAFLD and traditional risk factors for CKD progression.
Several limitations need to be considered in the interpretation of our fndings. First, we did not have information on the primary cause of CKD. However, we had detailed clinical and laboratory information on comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension, medications, anthropometry, and blood chemistry that allowed for 
adjusting for multiple confounders and evaluating potential mediators. Second, proteinuria was not measured 
using a quantitative assay. Tus, we excluded trace or 1+protein on urinalysis from the proteinuria subgroup

because of the possibility of false positives. Tird, NAFLD was measured by ultrasound afer exclusion of secondary causes for fatty liver. Although the accuracy of ultrasound for establishing the presence of fatty liver is high, 
it is subject to measurement error6,39. Similarly, we used eGFR as an outcome, which has inherent limitations 
derived from using creatinine as a fltration marker. Finally, this study was based on Korean patients in health 
screening exams, and may not be generalizable to other settings or to other ethnicities.
Screening for NAFLD in CKD patients is not routinely performed and there is no specifc guideline for screening NAFLD in CKD patients34. Our data suggest that routine screening for NAFLD needs to be contemplated 
among CKD patients, although additional studies are required to determine the approach and the clinical management of NAFLD in CKD patients. Most treatment strategies for NAFLD involve lifestyle modifcation such as 
weight reduction, hypocaloric diet, increase physical activity, smoking cessation, and treatment of associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia)5
. Future studies will also need to evaluate whether 
NAFLD resolution can reduce the risk of CKD progression independently of traditional risk factors40.
In summary, NAFLD was associated with declining kidney function in CKD patients independently of established risk factors, and the association was stronger in patients with advanced NAFLD, and in those with proteinuria or with eGFR lower than 45ml/min/1.73m2
. Our fndings suggest that NAFLD may contribute to CKD 
progression and may help identify patients with a higher risk of rapid progression. CKD patients may beneft 
from screening and management of NAFLD, which warrants prospective validation.

Center in Seoul, South Korea, from January 2003 to December 2013 (Fig. 2). Since our objective was to evaluate the 
longitudinal association between NAFLD and change of eGFR among patients with CKD, the analysis was restricted to 
subjects who had CKD (eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2
 or proteinuria ≥2+on urinalysis), and underwent an abdominal 
ultrasound (US) at baseline, and had at least 1 additional follow up for serum creatinine (n=1,843). We then excluded 
patients who had any of the following conditions at baseline: history of cancer (n=34), history of liver cirrhosis, positive hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C virus antibodies (n=70), alcohol intake≥30g/day in men or ≥20g/day 
in women (n=85), or had received a kidney transplant or started dialysis within 1 year afer the baseline examination 
(n=13). We also excluded patients who had missing information on alcohol intake (n=113), NFS (n=3), or less than 
6 months follow up (n=6). Since study patients could have more than one exclusion criteria, the fnal sample size was 
1,525 (1,065 men and 460 women). Te Institutional Review Board of the Samsung Medical Center approved this study 
and waived the requirement for informed consent as we used only de-identifed data routinely collected during health 
screening visits. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
Data collection. At each visit, demographic characteristics, smoking status, alcohol consumption, medical 
history, and medication use were collected through standardized, self-administered questionnaires. Smoking 
status was categorized into never, former, or current smoker. Alcohol consumption was categorized into none or 
moderate (<30 g/day in men and <20 g/day in women). Height, weight, and sitting blood pressure were measured by trained nurses. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
Serum creatinine was measured with the kinetic alkaline picrate method (Jafe method) using automated 
chemistry analyzers Hitachi 7600 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) from 2003 to 2009 and Modular DP (Roche, Basel, 
Switzerland) from 2009 to 2013. Serum glucose was measured by the hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. 
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 
were measured following the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry method. Urine protein was measured semi-quantitatively by urine dipstick using urine chemistry analyzers, Cliniteck Atlas (Siemens, Munich, 
Germany) or Urisys 2400 (Roche). Te Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics at Samsung Medical 
Center has participated in several profciency testing programs operated by the Korean Association of Quality 
Assurance for Clinical Laboratory, the Asian Network of Clinical Laboratory Standardization and Harmonization, 
and the College of American Pathologists.
Abdominal US. Abdominal US imaging was performed using LogiQ E9 (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, USA), iU22 xMatrix (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, Ohio, USA) or ACUSON Sequoia 512 
(Siemens, Issaquah, Washington, USA) equipments by experienced radiologists unaware of the study aims. 
Images were captured in a standard fashion with the patient in the supine position with the right arm raised above 
the head. An US diagnosis of fatty liver was made based on standard criteria, including parenchymal brightness, liver-to-kidney contrast, deep beam attenuation and bright vessel walls41,42. Since we had already excluded 
patients with excessive alcohol use (≥30 g/day for men and ≥20 g/day for women) as well as other identifable 
causes of fatty liver at baseline as described in the exclusion criteria, fatty liver was considered NAFLD.
Among individuals with NAFLD, we used the NFS to assess severity of fbrosis. Te NFS was calculated 
as −1.675 + 0.037 × age (years) + 0.094 × BMI (kg/m2
) + 1.13 × impaired fasting glucose/diabetes (yes = 1, 
no=0)+ 0.99× AST/ALT ratio − 0.013×platelet count (×109
/l) − 0.66×albumin (g/dl)43. Based on NFS, 
patients with NAFLD were classifed as high-intermediate (NFS≥−1.455) and low probability (NFS<−1.455) 
of advanced fbrosis.

Estimated glomerular fltration rate and proteinuria. EGFR was calculated from serum creatinine 
using the CKD epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation44: for women with serum creatinine ≤ 0.7, 
eGFR was calculated as 144 × (serum creatinine/0.7)−0.329× (0.993)age; for women with serum creatinine 
>0.7, eGFR was calculated as 144 × (serum creatinine/0.7)−1.209 × (0.993)age; for men with serum creatinine ≤ 0.9, eGFR was calculated as 141 × (serum creatinine/0.9)−0.411 × (0.993)age; and for men with serum 
creatinine>0.9, eGFR was calculated as 141×(serum creatinine/0.9)−1.209×(0.993)age. Signifcant proteinuria 
was defned as protein ≥2+ on urinalysis. CKD was defned as eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2
 or protein ≥2+ on 
urinalysis at the baseline examination. Te degree of CKD progression was evaluated as the average annual 
percent change in eGFR from baseline eGFR. For the severity of CKD, patients were further divided into two 
groups using a cut-of value of eGFR ≥45 ml/min/1.73 m2
 vs. <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 (dividing G3a and G3b) at 
baseline.
Statistical analysis. We compared serial changes in eGFR among CKD patients with or without NAFLD 
at baseline using linear mixed models for longitudinal data with random intercepts and random slopes45. To 
account for correlations in eGFR from repeated measurements over time in the same participant, the main analyses consisted of two-level linear mixed models for longitudinal data. We modeled linear trajectories in eGFR 
with time at the frst level, and variations in eGFR trajectories across participants at the second level. We used 
loge-transformed (eGFR) as the outcome and we estimated the average diference in annual percent change in 
eGFR (with 95% confdence intervals [CI]) comparing patients with NAFLD to those without NAFLD at baseline. 
Te 95% CIs were obtained from linear mixed models with diferent intersecting linear trends during follow-up 
time, interactions between linear time and baseline NAFLD status, and random variations in linear time among 
participants.
We used three models with increasing degrees of adjustment to account for potential confounding factors at 
baseline. Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and year of visit. Model 2 further adjusted for smoking (never, former, 
current, and missing), alcohol consumption (none and moderate), and BMI. In addition, to evaluate potential 
mediation of the association between NAFLD and eGFR changes by metabolic factors, model 3 further adjusted 
for hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides.
We conducted sensitivity analyses depending on CKD criteria at baseline: eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m2
 only, 
proteinuria only, and both. In addition, we performed stratifed analyses to evaluate if the association of NAFLD 
with CKD progression difered in pre-specifed subgroups defned by age (<60 vs. ≥ 60 years), sex, smoking (never or former vs. current), alcohol drinking (none vs. moderate), obese (defned as BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2
), 
hypertension (defned as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, or the 
use of antihypertensive medication), diabetes (defined as fasting serum glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl, hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5%, or the use of antidiabetic medication), hyperlipidemia (defned as high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL)-cholesterol < 40 mg/dl in men or < 50 mg/dl in women, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dl, or the use of 
lipid-lowering medication), or baseline eGFR (<45 vs. ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m2
). All reported P values were 
two-sided and the signifcance level was set at 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 14 
(Stata Corp., College Station, Texas).
