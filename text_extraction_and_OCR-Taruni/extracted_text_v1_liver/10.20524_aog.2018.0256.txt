Abstract Background Ongoing evidence suggests that sarcopenia adversely affects outcomes in cirrhosis. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate muscle fat infiltration as a component of sarcopenia and its 
prognostic value in this setting.
Methods In 98 consecutive patients with cirrhosis, muscle density was measured during a 
computed tomography scan at the level of the fourth to fifth lumbar (L4) vertebrae. Univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine predictors of survival.
Results Body mass index: median 26 (range 17-45.2); model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 
score: median 11  (6-29); Child-Pugh (CP) score: median 7  (5-13), CP class: A=49  (50.5%), 
B=39 (40%), C=10 (9.5%); hepatocellular carcinoma: 14 (14.3%); follow up: median 45 (1-140) 
months. Median L4 total psoas area (TPA): 2022 (777-3806) mm2; L4 average total psoas density 
(ATPD): 42.52 (21.26-59.8) HU. ATPD was significantly correlated with age (r=-0.222, P=0.034), 
creatinine (r=-0.41, P<0.001), albumin (r=0.224, P=0.035), MELD score (r=-0.218, P=0.034), and 
TPA (r=0.415, P<0.001). Fifty-four patients (55.1%) died during follow up. In the multivariate 
analysis, higher CP score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.41), 
advanced age (HR 1.038, 95%CI 1.006-1.07) and lower ATPD (HR 0.967, 95%CI 0.937-0.997) 
were predictors of mortality.
Conclusion Muscle fat infiltration, as a result of sarcopenia, is a negative predictive factor of 
survival in cirrhosis, emphasizing the need for early identification of this subgroup of patients.

Introduction
Malnutrition is a common complication of cirrhosis. 
The prevalence of malnutrition ranges from 50-90% and 
is proportionally related to the severity of liver disease [1]. 
It constitutes an independent predictor of mortality in 
patients with liver cirrhosis [2] and has been associated with 
detrimental early postoperative outcomes following liver 
transplantation [3].
The etiology of malnutrition in chronic liver disease (CLD) 
is considered to be multifactorial. Abnormal nutrient and 
caloric intake, decreased intestinal absorption and metabolic 
disturbances are all common in the CLD setting [4] and 
have been proposed as some of the major determinants that 
adversely affect nutritional status. Malnutrition is defined 
as a deficiency or imbalance in the intake of energy and/or 
nutrients and its diagnosis is based on the presence of at least 
2 of the following 6 criteria: weight loss, inadequate energy 
intake, loss of muscle mass, loss of subcutaneous fat, fluid 
accumulation and diminished functional status [5]. Sarcopenia 
results from the impaired nutritional intake and, although 
not synonymous, its definition overlaps that of malnutrition. 
Several groups have attempted to define sarcopenia [6-8], 
but there is still no consensus among experts. According to

2 M. Kalafateli et al
Delmonico  et  al the definition of sarcopenia was based on 
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measuring whole and 
regional body composition [9]. Computed tomography (CT) 
and magnetic resonance imaging are considered to be the 
gold standards for estimating muscle mass and muscle fatty 
infiltration for research purposes [6]. CT cross-sectional 
analytic morphometry has been used to correlate muscle 
mass with clinical outcomes in end-stage CLD. According to 
most of these studies, decreased muscle size is an independent 
predictor of mortality, both in stable cirrhosis [10] and on 
the liver transplantation waiting list [11,12], and it adversely 
affects outcomes in the post-transplant setting [3,13-15]. 
However, there is scarce evidence concerning the prognostic 
role of muscle fatty infiltration (the other component of 
sarcopenia) in CLD. In a recent study [16] the prognostic 
significance of sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity and myosteatosis 
was investigated in 678  patients with cirrhosis. The authors 
reported both sarcopenia and myosteatosis as independent 
predictors of mortality in cirrhosis. However, the cutoff values 
used for the definition of sarcopenia/myosteatosis were derived 
from studies that included oncologic patients. These results 
were not validated in CLD patients. Thus, we conducted this 
retrospective cohort study to evaluate the impact of muscle 
attenuation, measured by CT scan as an index of muscle fatty 
infiltration, on the overall survival of patients with cirrhosis.
Patients and methods
Patients
Ninety-eight patients with liver cirrhosis who attended 
the hepatology outpatient clinics between 2005 and 2011 and 
underwent an abdominal CT scan for any reason during the 
study period, which included the fourth lumbar (L4) section, 
were retrospectively enrolled in the analysis. In our center, 
cross-sectional imaging is commonly performed in patients 
with cirrhosis for diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal symptoms 
common in this setting, and/or pre-transplant evaluation. 
Patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria were excluded 
from the study. The study was approved by the local hospital’s 
ethics committee and conformed to the ethical guidelines of 
the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
Demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics
Data were recovered from the review of medical charts 
and included sex, age, height, weight, etiology of cirrhosis, 
presence of ascites or encephalopathy, liver biochemistry, and 
presence of HCC. None of the patients had diabetes mellitus. 
Survival data were recovered from medical charts or clinical 
correspondence. The severity of liver disease was assessed by 
the Child-Pugh class and score and the Model for End-stage 
Liver Disease (MELD). The presence of ascites was confirmed 
with both clinical and radiological findings.
CT image analysis
CT scans for routine diagnostic purposes were used for 
the assessment of total psoas muscle area (TPA) and density 
(ATPD). All CT scans were performed in the same scanner (GE 
Lightspeed 16x) and images were analyzed on a GE workstation 
in consensus by two radiologists (AK and CK), blinded to the 
patients’ outcomes. Freehand areas of interest (ROIs) were 
drawn covering the entire cross‐sectional areas of the left and 
right psoas muscles at the level of the L4/L5 intervertebral 
disc on precontrast images. This provided the values of area 
in mm2 and density in Hounsfield units (HU) of each psoas 
muscle at this level. The area of the resulting enclosed regions 
was then computed to generate the cross-sectional area of both 
psoas muscles by summing the areas of each (Fig. 1). To assess 
fatty infiltration of the psoas muscles, their mean density was 
calculated (left psoas muscle density + right psoas muscle 
density/2), with lower HU reflecting higher fat infiltration [9].
Statistical analysis
Numerical data were expressed as mean ± standard 
deviation if the distribution was normal, or median with 
interquartile range if not, and categorical data were represented 
as counts and percentages. All variables were tested for normal 
distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Categorical 
variables were tested using the chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. 
Continuous variables with and without normal distribution 
were compared using Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney 
U test, respectively. Spearman’s correlation coefficient (r) 
analysis was used for correlation between L4-TPA or L4-ATPD 
and baseline characteristics. Multivariate analysis of factors 
predicting TPA and ATPD values was performed by linear 
regression. For the survival analysis, we calculated the months 
Figure  1 Multiplanar reconstruction images were used in the 
precontrast examination of these patients to determine the L4/L5 level 
of the lumbar spine. In the axial plane at the level of the intervertebral 
disk a freehand region of interest was drawn around each psoas muscle. 
The total cross-sectional area of the two psoas muscles and the mean 
HU value were then calculated

from the CT scan to death. Univariate and multivariate Cox 
regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors 
for overall survival. Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test) was 
used to evaluate the impact of the lowest L4-ATPD quintile 
on overall survival. The discriminative ability of L4-ATPD to 
predict 12-month mortality was assessed by receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analysis. The L4-ATPD value that 
maximized the sum of sensitivity and specificity (i.e., that with 
the highest Youden’s index) was considered as the best cutoff. 
The results are presented as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). Significance testing was two-sided 
and based on a P-value <0.05. Analysis was performed using 
the SPSS statistical package (version  22.0, IBM, New  York, 
NY, USA) and MedCalc for Windows (version 12.5, MedCalc 
Software, Ostend, Belgium).
Ethical guidelines
The study was reviewed and approved by the ethics 
committee of the University Hospital of Patras. All study 
participants, or their legal guardian, provided informed written 
consent prior to study enrolment.
Results
The baseline characteristics of the study population are 
shown in Table  1. The etiologies of cirrhosis were alcohol 
(n=45, 45.9%), viral hepatitis (n=23, 23.4%), a combination 
of alcohol and viral hepatitis (n=12, 12.2%), autoimmune liver 
disease (n=8, 8.2%), and other causes (n=10, 10.2%).
Correlation of L4-TPA with baseline characteristics
In the univariate analysis, TPA had a positive, although 
weak, correlation with height (r=0.5, P<0.001), weight 
(r=0.566, P<0.001), body mass index (BMI) (r=0.28, 
P=0.008), and ATPD (r=0.415, P<0.001). Male patients had 
higher TPA values than females (median: 2022 ± 719  vs. 
1264 ± 482; P<0.001). No correlation with the severity of liver 
disease was found, whether assessed by Child-Pugh or MELD 
scores. However, sex-stratified analysis showed a significant 
correlation with Child-Pugh score (r=-0.27, P=0.024) and 
serum sodium (r=0.304, P=0.017) in male patients (Fig. 2). 
In the multivariate linear regression analysis, which included 
sex, BMI, ATPD and Child-Pugh score, male sex (b=0.54, 
95%CI 614.56-1114.11; P<0.001), high BMI (b=0.24, 95%CI 
14.16-64.84; P=0.003) and increased L4-ATPD (b=0.4, 
95%CI 15.42-35.08; P<0.001) were predictors of L4-TPA. 
In another model that included the individual components 
of the Child-Pugh score, rather than the composite index, 
male sex (b=0.557, 95%CI 690.42-1297.74; P<0.001), high 
BMI (b=0.274, 95%CI 17.3-76.05; P=0.002), increased L4-
ATPD (b=0.4, 95%CI 14.36-35.79; P<0.001), normal serum 
sodium (b=0.18, 95%CI 1.024-55.39; P=0.042) and no ascites 
(b=  -0.198, 95%CI 32.84-530.48; P=0.027) were found 
significant.
Correlation of L4-ATPD with baseline characteristics
In the univariate analysis, ATPD was significantly correlated 
with age (r=-0.222, P=0.034), creatinine (r=-0.41, P<0.001), 
albumin (r=0.224, P=0.035), and MELD score (r=-0.218, 
P=0.034), but not with BMI. There was no difference in ATPD 
between male and female subjects (43.04±8.95 vs. 41.6±13.1, 
P=0.34). A moderately weak but significant correlation was also 
observed with TPA (r=0.415, P<0.001). This correlation was 
stronger in the subgroup of male patients (r=0.538, P<0.001), 
but was not significant in female patients (r=0.22, P=0.267). 
However, there was a wide variation of ATPD across individuals 
with the same TPA for both male and female patients (Fig. 3). 
Likewise, patients with the same MELD score demonstrated 
a wide range of ATPD values (Fig. 4). The multivariate linear 
regression analysis of the factors which presented statistically 
significant difference in the univariate analysis together with 
sex, showed that younger age (b=-0.179, 95%CI -0.32 – -0.009; 
P=0.039), male sex (b=0.24, 95%CI 0.73-11.27; P=0.026), lower 
creatinine levels (b=-0.38, 95%CI  -17.17 –  -6.26; P<0.001), 
and higher TPA (b=0.59, 95%CI 0.006-0.013, P<0.001) were 
independently positively associated with ATPD.

Overall survival
Fifty-four patients (55.1%) died and 4 were lost to follow up. 
The causes of death were liver failure (55%), HCC (15%), acute 
gastrointestinal bleeding (5%), sepsis (5%), acute kidney injury 
(5%), and other etiologies (15%). Median overall survival was 
31.5 (range 1-140) months and median follow up of surviving 
patients was 57 (range 2-130) months. The univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses of the predictive factors 
for mortality are shown in Table 2. The value of L4-TPA was 
not predictive of the overall survival; thus, only ATPD was 
tested in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. In the 
multivariate analysis adjusted for age and sex, higher CP score 
(HR 1.2, 95%CI: 1.04-1.41, P=0.014), lower ATPD (HR 0.967,

Muscle attenuation and survival in cirrhosis 7
Discussion
Our study clearly demonstrates the independent prognostic 
significance of muscle fat accumulation, a process involved in 
the muscle attenuation/sarcopenia that often complicates CLD 
patients, in the survival of patients with cirrhosis after a long 
follow-up period. However, the decrease in psoas muscle size, 
also considered a component of sarcopenia, was not correlated 
with survival. The main advantage of our study compared to 
others [10,12,17] is the fact that we tested both features of 
sarcopenia (i.e., muscle mass loss and fat infiltration) and we 
did not focus only on muscle size. Evidence from our study 
(Fig.  2) supports a non-linear relationship between muscle 
mass and fat accumulation, suggesting an independent impact 
on survival that should be evaluated separately. We deliberately 
used muscle size and density as quantitative variables and 
avoided defining sarcopenia, taking into consideration the lack 
of specific cutoffs in patients with cirrhosis.
There are some differences between the findings of our 
study and those of two previous studies [10,17] that also 
investigated the impact of sarcopenia on the survival of 
patients with cirrhosis which were not on the waiting list for 
liver transplantation. In both these studies, sarcopenia was 
assessed at the L3 vertebra level—L3-skeletal muscle index 
(SMI)—and the cutoff values used for its definition were based 
on the findings of a study that included patients with solid 
malignant tumors [18]. The aforementioned studies reported 
no correlation between sarcopenia and the severity of liver 
disease (defined by either MELD or Child-Pugh score); these 
findings were not in concordance with our study. We found a 
significant correlation between TPA and Child-Pugh score in 
males, confirming a previous observation [12] reporting that 
the prevalence of sarcopenia increased with the Child-Pugh 
class in male patients awaiting liver transplantation but not in 
females.
A decreased skeletal muscle index has been independently 
associated with overall mortality. However, there were 
significant differences from our study: a. The use of certain 
L3-SMI cutoff values for the definition of sarcopenia was not 
validated in patients with cirrhosis; b. The SMI was comprised 
of the cross-sectional areas of all muscles enclosed in the L3 
region including the psoas muscle. In our study, we used only 
the psoas to evaluate muscle size. The psoas is a centrally 
located, deep muscle; it is easily recognizable, it does not 
require complex computations for its assessment and, most 
importantly, it is not influenced by abdominal distension in 
case of water retention [11]; c. The role of muscle fat infiltration 
was not evaluated in the previous studies, although the muscle 
depletion process of sarcopenia is by definition characterized 
by both muscle size decrease and fatty infiltration [9]; and 
d. The follow-up period in our study was longer (median 
45  months) compared to other studies (median 15 [10] and 
23 [17] months).
Skeletal muscle attenuation assessed by computed 
tomography is highly correlated with muscle triglyceride 
content in muscle biopsy [19] and is considered an objective 
measure of frailty, as it is related to age, inactivity and 
metabolic status [20]. It has also been associated with glucose 
intolerance, type  II diabetes mellitus, proinflammatory 
mediators, impaired physical function and increased risk of 
disability [21-23]. The role of psoas muscle density (measured 
by analytic morphometry) as a predictor of poor outcome has 
also been evaluated in other chronic (non-liver) conditions. 
In 302  patients who underwent colectomy for colon cancer, 
psoas density was the sole predictor of surgical complications 
(OR 0.96, 95%CI 0.94-0.99; P=0.004) [24]. In another study 
of 101  patients with stage III melanoma, psoas density, but 
not psoas area, was associated with disease-free survival (OR 
0.398, 95%CI 0.204-0.779) and distant disease-free survival 
(OR 0.55, 95%CI 0.349-0.866) [25]. As mentioned above, we 
found a significant correlation between muscle attenuation 
and liver disease severity. The mechanisms that link muscle fat 
infiltration and liver dysfunction might include a modulation 
in the pattern of proinflammatory cytokines (especially 
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein) 
and adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), observed in insulin 
resistance and type 2 diabetes [22,23], but the current evidence 
is very limited and further research is needed.
We found a significant discrepancy between ATPD values 
and MELD score, indicating that patients with the same liver 
function might have a wide range of ATPD values (Fig.  2). 
This indirectly reflects the independent impact of muscle fat 
infiltration on the overall mortality of patients with cirrhosis, 
confirmed by the multivariate analysis after adjustments to age, 
sex and liver disease severity. Notably, patients in the lowest 
quintile of ATPD had an almost twofold greater risk of death 
compared to patients in higher quintiles.
It is now widely accepted that prioritization of liver 
transplantation candidates based solely on the use of the MELD 
score can be suboptimal in certain clinical scenarios and runs 
the risk of misclassification of patients [26,27]. Durand et al [11] 
created a score (MELD/psoas score) that combined MELD score 
and transversal psoas muscle thickness/height (measured on 
a CT image) in a pre-MELD cohort (n=186) and they tested its 
performance in a MELD-era cohort of patients waiting for liver 
transplantation (n=376). The c-statistic of the MELD-psoas was 
0.82  (95%CI 0.64-0.93), similar to that of the MELD-Na score 
and numerically slightly superior to that of the MELD score (0.80; 
95%CI 0.60-0.91). However, the difference did not reach statistical 
significance. The new score performed better in patients with 
refractory ascites and MELD score <25, but with no statistically 
significant difference compared to the MELD score. It remains 
to be elucidated whether psoas muscle density, as an objective 
measure of frailty, could predict waiting-list mortality, as our study 
did not included patients listed for liver transplantation.
The presence of malignancy is strongly associated with 
a complex metabolic profile in patients known as cancer 
cachexia [28]. The survival of patients with HCC has been 
negatively related to skeletal muscle index and muscle 
attenuation [29]. A recent study, which included patients with 
liver cirrhosis with or without concomitant HCC, evaluated 
the frequency and the clinical significance of sarcopenia and 
myosteatosis in a cirrhotic population [30]. In this study, a 
separate analysis was conducted for cirrhotics with and without 
HCC and no difference between these two groups emerged 
regarding the factors related to survival [30].

There are some limitations related to this study. Firstly, 
it was a single-center study with a retrospective design, so it 
needs to be validated prospectively in larger populations. 
Secondly, the inclusion of patients based on the availability of 
CT scans might have entailed a risk of selection bias. Thirdly, 
the baseline MELD score in this study was low in contrast 
with the high mortality rate. However, as the MELD score 
constitutes a prognostic model in cirrhosis that has been 
validated for short-term mortality (3  months in the original 
paper), this discrepancy may be related to the long follow-up 
period (median of 45 months) of our patients.
In conclusion, this study suggests that psoas muscle density 
measured on a single transverse CT image at the L4 level can 
predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis, independently 
of liver disease severity. Apart from the underlying liver 
disease, it seems that host factors have a detrimental impact 
on disease progression and should thus be taken into account 
in risk stratification. There is a need for early identification 
of malnourished/sarcopenic cirrhotic patients. The efficacy 
of nutritional interventions and exercise therapy in terms of 
nutritional status, muscle mass, muscle fat accumulation and 
subsequent outcomes in liver cirrhosis needs to be further 
investigated in large, prospective, randomized trials.

Summary Box
What is already known:
•	 Sarcopenia is one of the most common and adverse
complications in patients with cirrhosis
•	 Computed tomography (CT) cross-sectional 
analytic morphometry has been used in a number 
of studies, which showed that decreased muscle 
sizes are associated with detrimental outcomes in 
end-stage chronic liver disease
•	 Evidence concerning the prognostic role of muscle
fatty infiltration (as the other component of 
sarcopenia) in cirrhotic patients is scarce
What the new findings are:
•	 Increased psoas muscle fat infiltration measured
on a single transverse CT image at the L4 level 
can predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis, 
independently of liver disease severity
•	 There is a great need for early identification of
malnourished/sarcopenic cirrhotic patients
