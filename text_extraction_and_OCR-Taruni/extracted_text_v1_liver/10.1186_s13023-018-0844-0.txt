Miglustat in Niemann-Pick disease type C
patients: a review
Mercè Pineda1,4*, Mark Walterfang2 and Marc C. Patterson3
Abstract
Objective: Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a rare, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disease associated
with a wide variety of progressive neurological manifestations. Miglustat is indicated for the treatment of progressive
neurological manifestations in both adults and children. Since approval in 2009 there has been a vast growth in clinical
experience with miglustat. The effectiveness of miglustat has been assessed using a range of measures.
Methods: Comprehensive review of published data from studies of cellular neuropathological markers and
structural neurological indices in the brain, clinical impairment/disability, specific clinical neurological
manifestations, and patient survival.
Results: Cranial diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown reduced
levels of choline (a neurodegeneration marker), and choline/N-acetyl aspartate ratio (indicating increased
neuronal viability) in the brain during up to 5 years of miglustat therapy, as well as a slowing of reductions
in fractional anisotropy (an axonal/myelin integrity marker). A 2-year immunoassay study showed significant
reductions in CSF-calbindin during treatment, indicating reduced cerebellar Purkinje cell loss. Magnetic
resonance imaging studies have demonstrated a protective effect of miglustat on cerebellar and subcortical
structure that correlated with clinical symptom severity. Numerous cohort studies assessing core neurological
manifestations (impaired ambulation, manipulation, speech, swallowing, other) using NP-C disability scales
indicate neurological stabilization over 2–8 years, with a trend for greater benefits in patients with older (noninfantile) age at neurological onset. A randomized controlled trial and several cohort studies have reported
improvements or stabilization of saccadic eye movements during 1–5 years of therapy. Swallowing was also
shown to improve/remain stable during the randomized trial (up to 2 years), as well as in long-term
observational cohorts (up to 6 years). A meta-analysis of dysphagia – a potent risk factor for aspiration
pneumonia and premature death in NP-C – demonstrated a survival benefit with miglustat due to improved/
stabilized swallowing function.
Conclusions: The effects of miglustat on neurological NP-C manifestations has been assessed using a range
of approaches, with benefits ranging from cellular changes in the brain through to visible clinical
improvements and improved survival.

Background
Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NP-C) is a rare neurovisceral lysosomal disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in either the NPC1 gene (in 95% of cases)
or the NPC2 gene (in approximately 4% of cases) [1–3].
NP-C is panethnic, and is usually sporadic, but specific
clinical sub-populations are associated with a higher risk
of NP-C compared with the general population [4].
Widely recognised age-at-onset categories are as follows:
perinatal (onset at age < 3 months, including prenatal
onset); early-infantile (at age 3 months to < 2 years);
late-infantile (at age 2 to < 6 years); juvenile (at age
6–15 years); and adolescent/adult (at age > 15 years)
[5, 6]. While NP-C is traditionally recognised as a
childhood-onset disease, a greater proportion of adolescent/adult-onset cases are now being detected. In
particular, patients with movement disorders, organic
psychosis, or early-onset cognitive decline are being
diagnosed [4, 7–9]. This trend is expected to continue, partly owing to raised awareness of the disease
[10, 11], as well as the increasing availability of rapid,
convenient diagnostic biomarkers [12–15], improved
genetic analytic methods [7, 16, 17], and new clinical
screening tools [17–20].
As in many rare inherited metabolic diseases, the
clinical presentation of NP-C is highly heterogeneous
[5, 21]. The signs and symptoms of NP-C can be
broadly grouped into three categories: visceral, neurological and psychiatric. Patients with the perinatal and
early-infantile forms tend to present with visceral
symptoms, cholestasis and development delay, while
those with juvenile- and adolescent/adult-onset forms
may present with a wide range of neurological manifestations [1, 22]. Typical neurological manifestations
include cerebellar ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria, and
dysphagia [5, 23, 24]. Vertical supranuclear saccade
palsy (VSSP), and gelastic cataplexy are characteristic
neurological signs [5]. In addition, patients with
adult-onset disease often present with neuropsychiatric signs including early cognitive decline and/or
psychiatric disturbances [25–28].
There is no cure for NP-C, although research into
possible disease-modifying therapies has been ongoing
since the 1950s [29]. Unesterified cholesterol was originally
considered the key offending metabolite underlying the
biochemical defect. The therapeutic effect of lipid-lowering
agents was therefore investigated [30, 31]. While these
agents reduced hepatic and plasma cholesterol levels, no
effect on neurological progression of the disease was seen.
A number of other potential therapies have been investigated, but so far only limited, mainly experimental data
have been reported [5]. Until fairly recently, treatment for
NP-C has therefore been restricted to palliative approaches
aimed at ameliorating neurological manifestations. These
generally include anti-seizure drugs, anticholinergics to
relieve dystonia and tremor, and antidepressants or antipsychotics for mood and psychotic disorders [5, 6].
Impaired intracellular lipid trafficking and resultant
accumulation of a broad range of lipids in cell lysosomes
and late endosomes is considered the primary underlying pathophysiological defect in NP-C [32, 33]. Current
understanding of the link between impaired lipid storage
and subsequent neurodegeneration remains incomplete
as the exact functions of NPC1 and NPC2 proteins are
not fully known, and different tissues show different
patterns of lipid accumulation [34]. Miglustat (Zavesca™;
Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd) inhibits the synthesis of
glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and is the first and only
targeted therapy to be approved for the treatment of
NP-C [5, 35, 36]. As required for any treatment for diseases associated with centrally-mediated neurological
symptoms, miglustat is able to cross the blood–brain
barrier, which allows it to access malfunctioning neurons
in the brain [37].
In animal models of NP-C, miglustat has been shown
to reduce neuronal glycosphingolipid accumulation, delay
the onset of neurological dysfunction, and prolong
survival [38, 39]. A clinical proof-of-concept study showed
improved lipid trafficking in peripheral blood B lymphocytes after miglustat treatment [40]. Subsequently, a
randomised controlled trial (RCT), long-term extension
studies, and a retrospective cohort study formed the
clinical evidence base for initial regulatory approval in the
EU in 2009: miglustat is now available in many countries
worldwide [41–43]. While a key effect of miglustat on
glycosphingolipid metabolism has been suggested [35], the
precise mode of action of this agent is not yet fully
understood.
There has been a vast growth of clinical experience
with miglustat in treating patients with NP-C since it
first became available, which has prompted development
of a variety of methods to measure disease responses to
therapy. Most commonly, the clinical impact of miglustat on observable, core neurological manifestations has
been evaluated using subjective physician-reported assessments of patient disability [24, 42, 44–48]. However,
such NP-C disability scales and ambulation indices are
not easy to apply in patients with early- or late-infantile
onset. Clinical developmental scales such as the Denver
Developmental Screening Test (DDST [49]) and the
Bayley scales for infant development (Bayley-III [50])
can be helpful for assessing patients during infancy.
Objective, quantitative assessments of specific clinical
features such as ocular motor function and swallowing
impairment can allow tracking of neurological progression independent of patient age [51–56]. A number of
studies have also reported objective parameters for
measuring changes in brain neurochemistry, structure,
Pineda et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:140 Page 2 of 21

and neuronal transmission [57–59]. No standardised
disease-specific approaches for assessing psychiatric
manifestations in NP-C have been reported, although
existing clinical scales can be used to assess cognitive
function [59–61].
This paper provides a comprehensive review of published data from studies that have reported therapeutic
effects with miglustat in patients with NP-C. Given the
multi-faceted nature of NP-C, we focus on the rationale
and clinical utility of methods used to evaluate a range
of different aspects of the disease, covering both subjective and objective efficacy measures. This review is
intended to provide guidance for the choice of disease
response markers for future evaluations of miglustat
efficacy. A full consensus recommendation on the best
methods for assessing the effectiveness of targeted therapy would be a desirable endpoint in NP-C. However, in
lieu of sufficient data to meet this goal, this article serves
as a source of information for future studies.
Miglustat pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics in NP-C
Miglustat is a small iminosugar molecule that reversibly
inhibits glucosylceramide synthase – the enzyme that
catalyses the first committed step in the GSL synthesis
pathway [35]. This activity has been demonstrated to
ameliorate the lipid-trafficking defect in patients with
NP-C, reducing intracellular lipid storage and normalizing lipid transport in peripheral blood B-lymphocytes
[40]. In turn, this is thought to reduce potentially neurotoxic levels of gangliosides GM2 and GM3, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide.
Data from animal studies suggest that miglustat can
delay the progression of NP-C and prolong survival [39,
62]. Miglustat was shown to reduce cerebellar pathology and storage of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides, to
decrease the risk of neurological manifestations developing by approximately half, and to increase lifespan in
NP-C mice after approximately 1 year of treatment
[39]. In a feline model miglustat decreased brain ganglioside accumulation and delayed the onset and progression of neurological symptoms [39]. Miglustat has
also been shown to improve Purkinje cell survival in
cats, possibly related to modulation of microglial
immunophenotype and function [63].
Data from in vitro and ex vivo analyses in animals and
humans indicate that miglustat may modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis through its effects on glucosylceramide levels [64]. Impaired calcium homeostasis
related to excess sphingosine storage is a suspected initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NP-C [65, 66].
Lysosomal sphingosine accumulation in NPC1-mutant
cells is thought to inhibit lysosomal calcium uptake [65],
which in turn may lead to impaired endocytic function
and subsequent development of the NP-C disease
phenotype. Miglustat may improve intracellular calcium
balance by reducing sphingosine accumulation [65].
Recent findings of reduced calcium binding protein
levels in cerebellar neurones suggest a role for calcium
homeostasis in the therapeutic effects of miglustat [67].
Pharmacokinetic studies in humans have shown that
miglustat is rapidly absorbed after oral administration,
reaching maximal plasma drug concentration in 2–2.5 h
[36, 68]. The absolute bioavailability of miglustat is at
least 80%, and its pharmacokinetic profile is approximately dose-proportional [36]. The large volume of
distribution of miglustat (83–105 L) reflects the fact that
it is not restricted to the bloodstream after absorption,
having physico-chemical properties that enable wide distribution in extravascular tissues as well as its ability to
cross the blood–brain barrier [36–38]. Miglustat is not
metabolized in vivo and is eliminated mainly via the
kidneys [36]. With a terminal elimination half-life (t½) of
6–7 h, steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions are
achieved 4–6 weeks of after initiation of treatment [69].
Clinical efficacy studies
A wide range of measures have been developed and
employed to assess the effects of miglustat therapy over
the last decade. The sections below review data on the
effectiveness of miglustat from three categories of published reports: 1) studies/case series in paediatric
patients (Table 1); 2) adult and across-ages cohort studies (Table 2); and 3) key single-patient case reports
(Table 3). Findings are discussed in sequence according
to the type of disease features they address, including:
neuropathological markers; specific neurological and
psychiatric manifestations; general clinical impairment/
disability; and treatment outcomes (survival).
Neuropathological markers
Excess GM2 and GM3 gangliosides and unesterified
cholesterol are differentially stored in neurons of the
cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus in NP-C.
This results in a range of recognisable ultrastructural
changes in these brain regions, including ballooned neurones, meganeurites, and glial cell abnormalities [62, 70,
71]. Neurodegeneration is most dramatic in the cerebellum, where Purkinje cell death is a hallmark neuropathological feature of NP-C [70, 72]. Cerebellar Purkinje cells
are particularly sensitive to GM2 and GM3 ganglioside
accumulation, but the basis of this selective vulnerability
is not yet known [73, 74]. Alzheimer disease (AD)-like
features including amyloid beta-protein accumulation –
without plaque formation – and paired-helical filament
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are consistently seen in
NP-C, mostly in the basal ganglia, hypothalamus, brain
stem and spinal cord [75, 76], and are possibly related to

dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism and apolipoprotein E genotype [76, 77]. While many of these features
are only observed on post-mortem histological examination, some of them, in particular cerebellar Purkinje cell
degeneration, bear relevance to clinical disease monitoring methods.
Brain imaging markers
Objective clinical markers of some of the known neuropathological features of NP-C have been reported based
on serial, quantitative brain imaging measurements in
longitudinal clinical studies. Importantly, the required
technologies for most assessments are available in many
hospitals. However, some of these techniques are not
suitable for clinical practice settings, requiring specialist
imaging analysis post-processing and expertise.
Brain choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and derivative Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios
are acknowledged markers for neurodegeneration in the
brain, and are detectable using brain magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) [78]. In a case series of three French
adolescent/adult-onset NP-C patients, Galanaud et al.
reported a sustained decrease in Cho/Cr ratio during
2 years of miglustat therapy [79]. These changes were
associated with mild improvement or stabilization of
core neurological manifestations, as measured using an
NP-C disability scale [24]. Improved neuronal viability
(based on Cho/NAA ratios) was later reported in a larger cohort of 16 adolescent/adult patients who received
miglustat for an average of 2.5 years. In contrast, patients
who discontinued miglustat showed deterioration [80]. In
line with MRS findings, annual progression of NP-C disability scores improved in patients who continued miglustat, but worsened in those who discontinued therapy.
Positron emission tomography (PET) has also been
used to assess brain metabolism in patients with NP-C
[45, 81]. Serial PET imaging was used to monitor treatment response in the frontal and temporo-parietal regions, basal ganglia, and cerebellum in a case series
following 16 Spanish paediatric NP-C patients [45].
Cerebral hypometabolism appeared stabilized and
neurological disease progression slowed during 3–4 years
of miglustat treatment in patients with juvenile-onset
disease. However, PET data were less consistent in patients with early-infantile or late-infantile onset forms.
Overall, no clear relation between PET findings and
NP-C disability scores was observed. Further studies are
required to assess the utility of PET in disease monitoring, particularly in the adolescent/adult-onset form.
Cerebral atrophy involving both grey- and white-matter
regions is frequently seen on clinical imaging in NP-C,
and some of these changes correlate with clinical functional deficits. For instance, MRI volumetry indicates that
reduced area and thickness of the corpus callosum,
decreased cerebellar volume, decreased volume of subcortical nuclei (including the thalamus, basal ganglia and
hippocampus), and ratio of pontine-to-midbrain area correlate with saccadic eye movement indices and loss of
motor function (e.g., ataxia, manipulation) [54, 55, 82–84].
In a prospective, controlled study, the loss of cerebellar
grey and white matter, bilateral thalamic volume, and
right caudate volume was slower in adolescent/adult-onset NP-C patients who received miglustat for a median
period of 2.8 years than in untreated patients [57]. Loss
of cerebellar grey matter and left thalamic volumes
correlated with NP-C disability scores and decreased
horizontal saccadic gain (HSG), and a potential protective effect of miglustat on cerebellar Purkinje neurons
was proposed [57].
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is another neuroimaging method that has been used in NP-C to measure
white matter architecture and integrity, and may be
useful for identifying regional changes in myelination
and axonal integrity, which are known to be altered in
NP-C [83, 85, 86]. A case report using DTI in an adult
NP-C patient showed improved fractional anisotropy
(FA), which is a marker of axonal myelin integrity, in the
corpus callosum after 1 year of miglustat therapy [87].
In a prospective longitudinal cohort study in 39 NP-C
patients, miglustat therapy was associated with lower
neurological symptom severity scores and less pathological change across a range of cerebellar DTI measures
(FA, mean diffusivity and cerebellar regional volumes)
[88]. Serial DTI assessments in a cohort of 13 adolescent/adult-onset patients showed improved FA in key
white matter regions including the corpus callosum,
forceps minor and the cingulate gyrus after 2 years of
miglustat therapy [58]. Decreased (improved) radial diffusivity (RD) was also noted in the corpus callosum.
These beneficial changes were considered possibly related to effects on cerebral metabolism. A case-control
DTI study comparing seven miglustat-treated and two
untreated control patients showed that miglustat treatment was associated with slowed degeneration in the
corticospinal tract, thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (Bowman et al., JIMD in press) [89].
CSF markers
Bradbury, et al. reported changes in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) levels of the calcium-binding protein, calbindin
D-28 K [67]. This putative marker is present at high
levels in the dendrites, soma and axons of cerebellar
Purkinje cells, and elevated CSF calbindin is considered a marker for Purkinje cell loss [67]. Prospective
analyses in 36 patients with NP-C aged 1.8–51.3 years
indicated significant (approximately 33%) decreases in
CSF calbindin during 2 years of miglustat therapy. However, unlike MRS-derived indices described above, CSF
Pineda et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:140 Page 8 of 21

calbindin did not appear to correlate with neurological severity scores, as measured using the NIH
NP-C neurological severity scale described by Yanjanin et al. [90].
Cologna et al. [91] reported altered levels of the CSF
fatty acid binding protein, FABP3, among other protein
biomarkers (e.g., oxidative stress proteins glutathione
s-transferase alpha, superoxide dismutase) in patients
with NPC1 in a study assessing the potential underlying
pathophysiology of NP-C. Furthermore, levels of FABP3,
which is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and
is considered a marker of ongoing neuronal cell loss/
damage, were significantly decreased in
miglustat-treated patients relative to untreated patients.
Electrophysiological markers
Neurophysiological indices derived from transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) tests have been suggested
as possible quantitative biomarkers for disease progression [59]. TMS testing in a preliminary study of two patients with NP-C showed improvement after 1 year of
miglustat treatment, and impaired SAI scores appeared
to correlate with disease severity and NPC1 mutation
status, as supported by previous evidence [92]. However,
the control population for this study was not well
matched, and these findings should be interpreted with
caution. In a further case report relating to longitudinal
TMS evaluations during 15 months of miglustat therapy,
cerebellar inhibition, TMS-derived short-latency afferent
inhibition – a measure for cholinergic transmission –
and short-interval intracortical facilitation – a marker
for glutamatergic neurotransmission – both showed improvement during miglustat therapy [93].
Assessments of key clinical neurological manifestations
Ocular motor assessments
Ocular-motor abnormalities, which often precede other
motor symptoms, are a hallmark feature of NP-C and
have been reported in 65–81% of patients [5, 23, 27]. This
variability on reported rates likely reflects
under-ascertainment of a finding that is frequently overlooked. In the experience of the authors, VSSP is invariably present in patients with neurologic symptoms beyond
infancy. Voluntary vertical saccades are affected first, usually in the late-infantile period, and are followed over time
by reduced pursuit movements and impaired horizontal
saccades [82, 94]. Full VSSP eventually develops in most
patients, reflecting progressive degeneration of
ocular-motor nerve tracts in the brainstem [82, 84]. Vertical saccades are often heavily impacted, if not absent, by
the time a patient has been diagnosed with NP-C, which
prevents their effective use in quantifying disease progression beyond diagnosis. In contrast, horizontal saccades deteriorate more gradually as the disease progresses [95, 96].
Horizontal saccadic eye movement parameters are therefore more useful for measuring miglustat treatment effects.
Between two indices of the linear relationship between
peak horizontal saccade duration and amplitude, horizontal SEM alpha (HSEM-α; the gradient) has been
verified as a useful marker for neurological progression
and treatment effects in NP-C, while HSEM-β (the intercept) is considered less relevant [54, 56]. In addition, a
number of other saccadic eye movement measures that
reflect volitional or even cognitive aspects can also be
used to indicate neurodegeneration in different regions
of the brain (e.g., corpus callosum, parietal cortex, cerebellar vermis, frontal cortex, and basal ganglia projections to the brainstem) [54, 55, 84].
HSEM-α (ms/deg) was the primary efficacy endpoint
in the seminal 12-month RCT investigating treatment
with miglustat versus standard care in 41 adults and
children with NP-C [56]. After 12 months of treatment,
HSEM-α was improved in miglustat-treated adults compared with those who received standard care. This effect
was statistically significant after exclusion of patients
taking benzodiazepines, which are known to impair saccadic eye movements. A mean improvement in HSEM-α
was also observed in children. In both adults and
children who completed 12 months of miglustat therapy
and subsequently participated in open-label extension
treatment, HSEM-α was maintained/stable relative to
baseline up to 24 months and beyond [41, 43]. While
HSEM-β indicated increases (deterioration) in patients
aged ≥12 years or older, smaller changes were seen in
miglustat-treated patients compared with those on
standard care. Changes over 12 months were not statistically significant (p = 0.834).
Changes in a number of saccadic eye movement parameters were reported in an observational cohort study in
nine adolescent/adult NP-C patients who received miglustat for up to 5 years [54]. HSG, a strong index of cerebellar vermian integrity, and self-paced saccades, which
reflect function of frontal-lobe eye fields in the brain, were
reported to discriminate better than HSEM-α between
NP-C patients and controls, and as potentially more
robust indicators of treatment efficacy. Both parameters
were significantly improved in treated patients but worsened significantly in untreated patients. HSG was also
measured in the MRI study in adolescent/adult patients
reported by Bowman et al. [57]. Correlations between the
rates of change in HSG and disease-relevant cerebellar
grey and white matter regions were observed. While HSG
increased in treated patients during a median 2.8 years of
miglustat therapy, it decreased in untreated patients. This
treatment difference was highly statistically significant.
Detailed, standardised ocular motor assessments are
crucial in clinical practice for the diagnosis/detection of
NP-C [5]. As well as saccades, smooth pursuit,
Pineda et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:140 Page 9 of 21

gaze-holding function, optokinetic nystagmus, and vergence movements should be examined (http://www.neur
ocular.com) [16]. A number of studies have also clearly
demonstrated that saccadic eye movement measurements are useful for assessing patient responses to
therapy in NP-C [41, 43, 54, 56, 57]. Video-oculography
(VOG; e.g., EyeSeeCam) allows the semi-automated
recording of all types of eye movements, and can be
used for objective, quantitative analysis of ocular motor
function (http://eyeseecam.com/) [59].
Swallowing
Dysphagia is a very common and frequently progressive
manifestation of NP-C, and is reported in approximately
80% of patients [21–23]. Similar to dysarthria, dysphagia
arises in NP-C chiefly through neurodegeneration in
specific brain regions including the corticobulbar pathways, basal nuclei, brainstem and cerebellum. Patients
with impaired swallowing need to be closely monitored
to avoid pneumonia subsequent to food aspiration. Dysphagia has been studied in NP-C using both subjective
clinical assessments based on clinical scales, and objective, semi-automated instrumental methods that directly
assess swallowing function.
Standardised clinical assessments of patients’ ability to
swallow different foods, graded using a five-point categorical scale, were performed during the 12-month
RCT and long-term extension study of miglustat in
adults and children [41, 43, 56]. Improved/stable swallowing was reported in the majority of juvenile- and
adolescent/adult-onset patients after 12 and 24 months
of miglustat therapy (86% and 79–93%, respectively) [43,
56]. While swallowing difficulties were less common
among children compared with older-onset patients,
likely due to limited time for neurological deterioration
to become apparent, no deterioration in swallowing
function was seen in children after 24 months on therapy [41]. Similar swallowing assessments were employed
in a cohort study including 25 NP-C patients (all age
groups), and demonstrated improved/stabilized swallowing function in the majority of patients (65%) treated
with miglustat for 24 months [48]. These results persisted in 40–50% of patients after 48–96 months.
Dysphagia is one of the cardinal neurological manifestations evaluated by clinical NP-C disability scales,
where swallowing function is generally scored across
severity ratings from ‘normal’ (lowest score) through to
‘requirement for nasogastric tube or gastric button feeding’ (most severe score). In an observational retrospective study in 66 patients across all age-at-onset categories
(range 0–32 years), stable/improved scores on the dysphagia subscale were observed in 81% of patients after a
median of 1.5 (0.1–4.5) years on miglustat [42]. A comparable proportion (75%) of patients included in the
international NPC Registry also showed stable or improved swallowing function based on disability scores [46].
Silent aspiration (i.e., food or fluid aspiration without
overt, observable signs of choking) of small or trace
amounts of food or fluid is not well diagnosed without objective, quantitative data derived from video-fluoroscopic
(VFS) analyses. Chien et al. reported VFS findings in two
Taiwanese patients treated with miglustat for 1 year [53].
Patient 1 had severely impaired swallowing at baseline and
showed substantial improvements by month 6 of treatment. Patient 2 had a later disease onset but showed
impaired cognition that improved during miglustat therapy: his swallowing ability was normal at baseline and
remained stable throughout treatment. In a later case
series, the same research group reported improved or
stable VFS-defined swallowing function across five patients who received miglustat for a median of 4 years in a
Taiwanese case series [52]. No significant increases in the
Han dysphagia scale or an aspiration–penetration index
were observed among four evaluable patients.
VFS studies in an Italian case series of four
early-infantile and juvenile-onset patients with NP-C
who received miglustat for 3–4 years indicated early improvements in swallowing ability on treatment [51].
Importantly, VFS studies in the Italian patients indicated
that more severe, pharyngeal-phase swallowing impairments associated with penetration/aspiration of VFS
contrast agent occurred later in the course of disease
[51]. This finding was in line with parallel ratings of
overall neurological impairment. Further, therapeutic
effects on pharyngeal-phase swallowing appeared earlier
and were more pronounced than those on oral-phase
swallowing, which hints at a selective effect on involuntary reflexes dependent on the integrity of brainstem
neurones. More recently, Abe and Sakai reported
improved swallowing in a single-patient case report [97].
Ambulation
Cerebellar ataxia and dystonia are core neurological manifestations in NP-C [4, 22]. The treatment effects of miglustat
on ambulation are usually assessed based on subjective clinical observation and findings from neurological examinations in clinical practice settings [23, 27, 28]. However,
ambulation has been studied using more structured assessments such as the SAI, where it is rated on a categorical
scale from zero (asymptomatic or fully active) to 9 (restricted
to wheelchair and unable to transfer independently) [98].
SAI assessments during the 12-month miglustat RCT
and subsequent extension treatment demonstrated stabilised ambulation in both adults and children over
24 months of therapy [41, 43, 56]. In the Taiwanese paediatric case series reported by Chien et al., SAI-defined
ambulatory function remained stable for at least the first
2 years of treatment in most patients, but there was a
Pineda et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:140 Page 10 of 21

trend towards deterioration thereafter, considered possibly
related to treatment interruptions [52, 53]. Substantial improvements, concomitant with improved cognition and
abolition of seizure activity, have also been reported using
the SAI in a French patient with juvenile-onset NP-C [99].
Ambulation subscales are consistently included in
NP-C disability scales, which are most often based on
the original Iturriaga scale or a modified version thereof
[24, 45]. Longitudinal analysis of disability assessments
in 92 patients across all age-at-onset categories (range <
1–44.6 years) included in the international NPC Registry
indicated stable or improved ambulation at approximately 2-year follow up [46].
Psychiatric and cognitive manifestations
Psychiatric disturbances are often observed in patients with
adolescent/adult-onset NP-C, and have been reported in
up to 86% of cases, usually at initial presentation [25, 100]:
they are relatively rare in patients with childhood-onset
NP-C, although a few cases have been reported [101, 102].
Psychotic and mood-related symptoms are the most common psychiatric features reported in patients with NP-C
(in 43–62% of patients) [26, 103–105]. Many adolescent/
adult-onset patients (61–86%) exhibit cognitive decline,
likely due to the fact that cognitive decline manifests in
most patients of juvenile age onwards [27, 106].
Published evidence regarding the effects of miglustat
on psychiatric manifestations is largely based on case reports and case series: changes in psychiatric status are
not generally quantified using objective or systematic
methods. Szakszon et al. reported complete recovery
from psychosis after 1 year of miglustat therapy in a patient with juvenile-onset disease [102]. Maubert et al. described stabilised psychiatric symptoms and cognitive
function, allowing cessation of antipsychotic therapy, in
an adolescent/adult-onset patient after 1.7 years on
miglustat [107]. Santos et al. reported improvements in
indices for depression, affective and attention problems
based on the child behaviour checklist (CBCL [108]),
along with stabilisation/improvements in seizure control
and movement, in a juvenile-onset patient [109]. Mattson et al. reported profound improvements in speech/
language in a patient with adult-onset psychosis [110].
The mini-mental status examination (MMSE [60]) has
been used to assess cognition in miglustat-treated patients in various studies. Small improvements in cognition were reported in miglustat-treated adolescent/
adult-onset patients compared with those on standard
care in the 12-month RCT [56]. In a retrospective, observational evaluation in a cohort in 21 adult-onset
NP-C patients, initial improvement or stabilisation of
cognitive function, as measured using the MMSE and
FAB (frontal assessment battery), was reported during
an average of 19 months of miglustat treatment [111].
MMSE analyses have indicated improvements in cognitive function over varying treatment periods (1–6 years)
in individual case studies [52, 53, 105]. Developmental
delay and cognitive impairment have also been assessed
in selected paediatric patients in the Italian NP-C cohort
using formal psychometric tests including Griffith’s
mental developmental scale and Wechsler-Bellevue
scales (WPPSI, WISCR, WAISR) [48, 112].
General clinical impairment/disability evaluations
A number of NP-C disability scales that quantify overall
‘functional disability’ in NP-C based on categorical assessments of core neurological domains have been formulated to establish easy-to-use, focussed clinical tools
suitable for physicians who are not experts in metabolic
diseases (see Additional file 1: Table S1). The original
NP-C disability scale was developed by Iturriaga et al.
[24], and was later modified by Pineda et al. [45] to provide equal weighting for four core domain subscales
(ambulation, manipulation, language and swallowing).
Other forms of the original scale have followed similar
assessment rationales, but have addressed additional
neurological aspects. For instance, the scale developed
by Fecarotta et al. for use in the Italian NP-C cohort
included subscales for developmental delay/cognitive impairment, seizure activity and dystonia (as a separate domain), and was therefore better suited for assessing
childhood-onset disease [48].
To date, NP-C disability scales have been used to
evaluate effects of miglustat on patient impairment/
disability in a large, retrospective observational cohort
study [42], in the international NPC Registry [46],
and in a number of national NP-C cohort studies [44,
45, 47, 48]. NP-C disability scales have also been
measured in parallel with a number of putative
neuropathological markers to achieve clinical validation (See Neuropathological markers section) [57, 67,
80].
In a retrospective observational cohort study, NP-C
disability scores were reported for 66 patients (mean age
9.7 [0–32] years) treated with miglustat in clinical practice
settings [42]. Overall neurological stabilisation was observed during a median 1.5 (0.1–4.5) years of treatment.
While neurological disease was stabilised across all
age-at-onset groups, the size of treatment effects was
greater in patients with the juvenile- and adolescent/adult-onset forms than in those with early- or late-infantile
onset. Prospective longitudinal NP-C disability scale assessments have been reported for 92 patients across all
age-at-onset categories (range < 1–44.6 years) in the international NP-C Registry who received ≥1 year of continuous miglustat therapy [46]. Reduced annual disease
progression was reported during a mean of 3.9 (1.1–9.8)
years on therapy. In line with findings from the
Pineda et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:140 Page 11 of 21

retrospective cohort study, the proportion of improved/
stable patients increased across neurological onset categories in the following order: early-infantile (33%) <
late-infantile (50%) < juvenile (79%) < adolescent/adult
(94%).
Improved/stabilised neurological manifestations have
consistently been reported based on prospective cohort
studies in Italy [48, 113] and France [44], and case series
reported in Spain [45] and Iran [47]. In the Italian national
NP-C cohort, improved/stabilised disability was measured
using a modified version of the Iturriaga scale over a median 5.9 (4.0–8.0) years of treatment in the majority (56%)
of evaluable patients who started miglustat early on in the
disease course (< 3.5 years after neurological onset) [48].
Notably, beneficial effects were much less frequent in patients who started treatment late on in the disease course.
Patients with lower rates of neurological deterioration at
treatment start responded better than those with higher
rates of progression. In addition, developmental delay was
stabilised or improved in the majority of patients
(68%). A Spanish paediatric NP-C case series reported
a relative lack of effect of miglustat on systemic
symptoms such as splenomegaly [45]. However,
neurological status generally appeared stabilized in
juvenile-onset patients, while smaller neurological effects were observed in patients with early-infantile
and late-infantile onset disease who were at a more
advanced stage of disease treatment start. In an
Iranian paediatric case series [47], a general stabilisation of scores was observed based on a disability scale
designed specifically for use in Iranian patients, which
incorporated ocular-motor function and seizure activity, along with improvements in psychomotor delay in
early- and late-infantile onset patients.
A post-hoc analysis of data from the 12-month miglustat RCT evaluated disease stability based on subjective
appraisals of all core clinical symptoms assessed during
the trial (HSEM-α, swallowing, SAI, and MMSE) [114].
Among 29 patients who received ≥12 months of miglustat treatment, 21/29 (72%) were classified as having
stable disease (i.e., no deterioration in swallowing, SAI
and MMSE, or deterioration in HSEM-α only) [114].
These data were supported by similar multi-parameter
analyses in the retrospective cohort analysis reported by
Pineda et al. [42].
Plasma biomarkers
Quantitative analysis of plasma oxysterols (e.g.,
cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol [C-triol], 7-ketocholesterol
[7-KC]), certain plasma bile acids (e.g., 3β,5α,6β-trihydroxycholanic acid), and certain lysosphingolipids (e.g.,
lyso-SM-509) have been shown to be highly effective in
the diagnosis and screening of NP-C [12–17, 115, 116].
There are currently no data to support their use for
disease or efficacy monitoring. Plasma levels of these
markers have not been shown to correlate with neurological disease stage [14, 115, 116]. The presumed reason
for this is that the main therapeutic action of miglustat
is in the brain, whereas overall marker levels in blood
reflect whole-body disease impact, contributed mostly
by visceral impairment (e.g., hepatomegaly, splenomegaly). Previous published data indicate that miglustat has
relatively little effect on visceral symptoms in NP-C [45].
Treatment outcomes
Rates of disease progression and overall life expectancy
vary greatly in NP-C and are highly influenced by age at
onset of neurological symptoms. Estimates of age at onset and prognosis in US and European national NP-C
cohorts have been reported previously [6]. While there
are rare published cases where patients have survived
into the sixth or even seventh decade of life or have
never exhibited neurological manifestations [117, 118],
almost all NP-C patients die prematurely.
Precise causes of death are not consistently reported
in NP-C, but data from two separate patient cohorts indicate bronchopneumonia subsequent to food or fluid
aspiration as the reason for early mortality in approximately 60% of patients [119, 120]. Dysphagia has been
recorded in up to 80% of patients with NP-C [21–23], is
by far the most common cause of aspiration pneumonia,
and has been shown to represent a major risk factor for
patient mortality [121].
In a meta-analysis of all available data from studies of
miglustat treatment effects in NP-C, miglustat was
reported to confer a potential survival benefit [121].
Comparison of untreated NP-C patients (N = 97) with
those who received miglustat (N = 90; all age groups) revealed a vast numerical difference in the number of
deaths over a 5-year period: 74 deaths among untreated
patients versus three in the treated group. Kaplan-Maier
estimates of survival indicated that this difference was
statistically significant (p = 0.044).
How to assess miglustat efficacy: Utility of disease
monitoring methods
Figure 1 provides an overview of the relationship
between NP-C cellular pathology and neuronal damage,
brain substance changes, neurological symptoms, psychiatric manifestations and, ultimately premature death
in NP-C, and lists some of the respective measurements
that can be applied to track changes in each of these
features. Several objective and subjective markers have
been developed that can be used to assess each of the
main neurological manifestations of NP-C, including
general clinical impairment (NP-C disability scales),
ambulation (SAI), ocular motor changes (HSEM-α,
HSEM-β, HSG), swallowing (VFS, clinical grading), and
Pineda et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:140 Page 12 of 21

imaging (e.g., MRS Cho/NAA ratio), and neurotransmission (TMS) (Table 4).
NP-C progresses slowly in most patients, and its clinical manifestations are highly variable from individual
to individual. It would be highly desirable to use simple,
widely available and reliable laboratory measurements
to assess response to interventions. Such measurements
are characterised as biomarkers or surrogate markers
(see Table 5). A surrogate marker is defined as “…a laboratory measurement or physical sign that is used in
therapeutic trials as a substitute for a clinically meaningful
endpoint that is a direct measure of how a patient feels,
functions, or survives and is expected to predict the effect
of the therapy” [122]. In contrast, a biomarker is simply
defined as “…a laboratory measurement that reflects the
activity of a disease process” [123].
Some methods, particularly those based on imaging
(MRI, DTI, VFS), are widely accessible in hospital settings, provide objective, quantitative data, and can be
applied independent of patient age. Visual analyses
can be relatively non-specific for diagnostic purposes.
However, they are highly specific for long-term monitoring as they can accurately and specifically capture
longitudinal changes in affected brain regions over
time. However, to be truly useful for disease monitoring in NP-C, these techniques require specialist

evaluation (e.g., by a neuroradiologist) and interpretation. Likewise, specialised imaging methods such as
PET and MRS are not readily available at all treatment centres as they require access to significant
scanning hardware and expertise.
Other techniques (e.g., VOG) require a degree of cooperation that can be difficult to achieve in children and
elderly patients, such as quantitative assessments of ocular motor impairment or evaluations of ambulation (in
the SAI and NP-C disability scales). CSF calbindin
assays, which require collection of CSF by lumbar
puncture and quantification by immunoassay, require
forward planning and necessary laboratory expertise,
and are therefore more suited to research use in clinical studies.
NP-C disability scales have provided a great deal of
valuable data on the clinical efficacy of miglustat.
Despite being derived from subjective clinical observation, these scales are generally well suited for assessing
treatment efficacy in clinical practice settings. The majority of studies assessing miglustat have been based on
the original, simple scales reported by Iturriaga et al. in
2006 [24] and Pineda et al. in 2010 [45]. The more
comprehensive neurological severity scale described by
Yanjanin et al. [90], which is based on the US NIH
NP-C cohort, has not been so widely used for longitudinal disease/efficacy monitoring in clinical practice.
However, it has proved useful for assessing overall
neurological disease severity in the clinical trial setting.
The original NP-C disability scale reported by Iturriaga
et al. [24] and the modified version reported by Pineda
et al. [45] have been applied most widely to monitor
disease progression and treatment effects, but different
scales including extra neurological domains have also been
developed. As a result, certain clinical NP-C disability
scales appear to be more relevant in early-infantile,
late-infantile and juvenile-onset patients than in adolescent/adult patients. For instance, the scale applied by
Fecarotta et al. in the Italian paediatric NP-C cohort
included developmental delay/cognitive impairment, and
may be an appropriate choice for assessing children aged
> 6 years [48]. On the other hand, this scale does not take
seizures or ocular movements into account. The Pineda et
al. scale includes both of these domains as well as
language delay [45].
Clinical use of miglustat
Miglustat is indicated for the treatment of progressive
neurological symptoms in both children and adults with
NP-C [36]. The recommended dose for adolescent and
adult patients is 200 mg t.i.d., and should be reduced in
proportion to body surface area in paediatric patients, as
per manufacturer’s instructions [36]. Based on expert
consensus treatment should be initiated as soon as any
neurological manifestations appear [5, 6, 36]. In patients
who do not have neurological manifestations, but for
whom there is a known family history and disease
course, treatment can be commenced at the anticipated
time of neurological onset [5, 124].
In general, miglustat therapy should be continued as long
as patients continue to derive discernible therapeutic benefits with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile [5].
Treating physicians, patients and family members should be
aware of what to expect from miglustat therapy, taking into
account individual patient characteristics (e.g., age at onset,
symptom severity). In general, based on clinical experience
to date, it can take 6–12 months to observe clinical benefits
in early-infantile onset cases and over 2 years in later-onset
disease. Any decisions to alter or discontinue ongoing
miglustat treatment should be taken with careful consideration of risk versus benefit and patient tolerability [5].
Miglustat tolerability: Potential impact on
effectiveness
As with any medication, the tolerability profile of miglustat in NP-C has the potential to affect clinical effectiveness. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) recorded
in miglustat-treated patients during clinical trials and in
clinical practice settings were mainly gastrointestinal
(e.g., diarrhoea, flatulence and abdominal pain/discomfort) [36, 41, 43, 56, 125–127]. The gastrointestinal tolerability of miglustat at the start of treatment has the
potential to affect patient compliance with therapy and
needs to be monitored closely [127]. It is noteworthy
that such effects can be minimised or even avoided using
dietary modifications or, in some cases, careful up-titration
of miglustat dosing at treatment start [36, 127]. Transient
physiological tremor of the hands has been reported
in over half of patients during the initial weeks of
Table 5 Recommendations on NP-C marker selection for
following disease development or treatment efficacy
• NP-C disability scale based clinical measures are easy to use and
broadly acknowledged.
• Simple, focussed NP-C disability scales (e.g. Pineda scale [45]) may be
preferred over more wide-ranging measures (e.g., the NIH severity
scale [90]).
• The efficient application of an NP-C marker as part of a research study
does not guarantee that the marker will be useful in individual patients in a hospital setting.
• Imaging and laboratory marker methods should ideally be applied
using established, locally available methods and expertise.
• Specific imaging markers (e.g., MRI, DTI, VFS) provide objective,
quantitative data, and can be applied independently of patient age.
• The application of laboratory markers should be considered in
relation to patients’ or carers’ acceptance and access.
• Diagnostic NP-C biomarkers (oxysterols, lysosphingolipids, bile acids)
do not currently qualify as effective methods for disease monitoring
over time.

therapy, but usually resolves after the 1–3 months on
treatment and can be helped by temporary dose reduction
[36]. Weight loss has also been reported in both adults
and children on miglustat, but has not been associated
with any clinical sequelae and has either minimal or no effect on normal growth in paediatric patients [41]. Mild reductions in platelet counts that were not associated with
bleeding have been observed in some NP-C patients during treatment with miglustat, and monitoring of platelet
counts is recommended in patients with low platelets at
start of treatment [36].
Peripheral neuropathy was reported as an AE in
two patients with Gaucher disease (GD) who received
miglustat during the initial GD registration trial [69].
While this prompted increased safety vigilance in
miglustat-treated patients in subsequent years [125,
128, 129], peripheral neuropathy is a very rare complication in NP-C. A search of the literature reveals
only a few published cases of this neurological manifestation in NP-C, all of which were in patients who
did not receive miglustat [130–132].
Conclusions
Since its initial approval in 2009, clinical experience with
miglustat in the treatment of NP-C has increased markedly, as documented in numerous clinical cohort studies,
case series and case reports. A weakness of the published literature is the scarcity of data from prospective,
RCTs. RCTs are challenging to design, fund and execute
in a rare, progressive disease such as NP-C, especially
when no alternative disease-modifying therapies have
been approved. Nevertheless, consistent with the clinical
heterogeneity of NP-C, a wide variety of methods have
been used to assess the effects of miglustat on a number
of disease manifestations. Available parameters address
changes in brain neurochemistry, metabolism, structure,
CSF markers and neurotransmission, and changes in
ocular-motor function, swallowing, movement, psychiatric manifestations, cognitive function and overall clinical disability.
Imaging studies based on DTI and MRS have demonstrated reduced levels of choline (a neurodegeneration
marker), and Cho/NAA ratio (indicating increased neuronal viability) in the brain. Less reduction in fractional
anisotropy (an axonal/myelin integrity marker) has also
been observed in certain brain regions. In MRI studies,
potential protective effects of miglustat on cerebellar
and subcortical structures were shown to correlate with
clinical symptom severity, although longitudinal MRI
findings are subject to a high degree of variability.
Observations of reduced CSF calbindin levels during
treatment may represent a potential further means of
tracking proposed protective effects of miglustat on
cerebellar Purkinje cells. Observed changes in TMS
parameters indicate roles for GABA-ergic, NMDA and
cholinergic receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the
effects of miglustat on dystonia, cognition and possibly,
seizure activity.
Owing to the neurodegenerative nature of NP-C, disease stabilization is considered the best attainable therapeutic goal as irreversible damage/loss of neurones has
likely already occurred in most patients by the time a
diagnosis of NP-C is confirmed and targeted treatment
initiated [6]. The main aims of targeted therapy are
therefore to improve patient quality of life and maintain
physical function.
Improved or stabilised core neurological manifestations have consistently been reported in miglustat cohort
studies and case series based on NP-C disability scales
that assess typical neurological symptoms. A range of
these scales have been employed in studies reported to
date. The more simple scales (e.g., those of Iturriaga et
al. [24] and Pineda et al. [45]) are particularly useful in
clinical practice and were used in the majority of studies
covered in this review. The more comprehensive neurological severity scale developed based on the NIH NP-C
cohort has been reported only in selected clinical trial
settings to date [5, 90]. The range of disability scales that
are available raises a difficulty, in that studies on treatment effects are not easily comparable with one-another
and certainly do not allow statistical meta-analyses,
which are important in rare diseases such as NP-C
where patient numbers are limited. There is therefore an
ongoing need for the development of a unified, validated
disability scale that can be applied more widely across
studies to measure treatment effects, certainly in patients aged ≥4 years.
Treatment benefits seem less predictable in patients
with early-infantile-onset NP-C than in late-infantile-,
juvenile- and adolescent/adult-onset groups. Therapeutic
effects are also less pronounced in patients with severe
manifestations at treatment start, and in those who start
treatment late on in the course of disease. Objective,
quantitative assessments indicate improvement/stabilisation of swallowing function (VFS) and ocular motor
function (saccadic eye movement indices).
A published report has indicated beneficial effects of
miglustat on prognosis in NP-C [121]. This may partly
be due to slower progression of dysphagia, and a subsequent delay to disease stages where severe bronchopneumonia due to food or fluid aspiration becomes more
likely. Further data are required to confirm this.
Overall, published data have shown that the treatment
effects of miglustat in NP-C can be monitored on a variety of levels. In clinical practice physicians can choose
from a range of accessible methods to monitor disease
progression depending on individual case presentations,
prevalent symptoms pertinent to specific patient cohorts,
Pineda et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2018) 13:140 Page 17 of 21

and local/regional health infrastructure. Regardless of the
measures employed, it should be borne in mind that
NP-C is a progressive disease, and patients should be
followed up at 6–12-monthly intervals to allow proper
longitudinal assessment.
