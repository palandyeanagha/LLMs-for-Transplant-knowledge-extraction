Abstract Changes in body composition are associated
with poor outcomes in cancer patients including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sarcopenia, defined as the loss
of skeletal muscle mass, quality and function, has been
associated with a higher rate of complications and recurrences in patients with cirrhosis and HCC. The assessment
of patient general status before HCC treatment, including
the presence of sarcopenia, is a key-point for achieving
therapy tolerability and to avoid short- and long-term
complications leading to poor patients’ survival. Thus, we
aimed to review the current literature evaluating the role of
sarcopenia assessment related to HCC treatments and to
critically provide the clinicians with the most recent and
valuable evidence. As a result, sarcopenia can be predictive
of poor outcomes in patients undergoing liver resection,
transplantation and systemic therapies, offering the chance
to clinicians to improve the muscular status of these
patients, especially those with high-grade sarcopenia at
high risk of mortality. Further studies are needed to clarify
the predictive value of sarcopenia in other HCC treatment
settings and to evaluate its role as an additional staging tool
for identifying the most appropriate treatment. Besides,
interventional studies aiming at increasing the skeletal
muscle mass for reducing complications and increasing the
survival in patients with HCC are needed.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide [1]. The identification of
patients with a high-mortality risk is the key-point in the
choice of the most adequate treatment for each patient with
HCC, according to the patient’s specific prognosis. Thus,
several prognostic staging systems have been developed,
such as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) and others
[1]. Nevertheless, its high-mortality rate, the prognostic
factors for HCC remain controversial since the long-term
prognosis of HCC is associated with several factors, mainly
represented by the liver functional reserve and the stage of
cancer progression [1, 2]. In the past decade, the performance status developed by the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) was added to the BCLC staging
system in order to provide a parameter for the general
assessment of patients status, ranging from fully active to
dead [1], the performance status has been previously
associated with both tumoral and cirrhotic factors and
accurately predicts long-term survival in HCC patients
[3]. However, to date, the available staging and prognostic
systems do not include other parameters for assessing the
general performance and nutritional and functional status
of the patient with HCC. Interestingly, in addition to these
well-known factors, previous studies demonstrated that
changes in body composition are associated with poor
outcomes in cancer patients including HCC [4]. Indeed, a
progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder,
defined as sarcopenia, is associated with an increased
likelihood of adverse outcomes including falls, fractures,
physical disability and mortality [1, 2]. More in deep,
sarcopenia is characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle
mass, quality and strength [5]. During the past decades,
several methods have been proposed to assess sarcopenia
(Table 1). This disorder can be due to aging (primary
sarcopenia) or acute and chronic illness (secondary sarcopenia), including chronic liver diseases [4]. Moreover, it
has been associated with poor prognosis in a lot of
malignancies as pancreatic cancer [6], colorectal liver
metastases [7], melanoma [8], lung cancer [9] and
esophageal neoplasia [10] and significantly increases
morbidity and mortality after surgery for cancer [11], other
than being associated with the outcome of patients with
HCC [12].
In fact, sarcopenia has been associated with a higher rate
of complications and recurrences in patients with cirrhosis
and HCC undergoing resection [13]. While few studies
exist on the prognostic role of sarcopenia after ablative
treatments [14], such as radiofrequency ablation,
chemoembolization and radioembolization, a growing
number of studies have been conducted in patients undergoing systemic therapies for HCC, such as the multi-kinase
inhibitor Sorafenib [15, 16]. In this latter setting, where the
assessment of the general status of the patient is crucial for
achieving therapy tolerability, sarcopenia was an independent predictor of poor survival, scarce tolerance to
chemotherapy and higher toxicity in these patients [15, 16].
Therefore, the aim of this review was to critically revise
the available evidence on the role of sarcopenia assessment
in all HCC treatment settings, in order to assess whether it
can be considered a reliable tool for stratifying patients’
prognosis before treatment and to address further research
into the field.
We conducted a Medline and PubMed search from
inception to December 2019 using the search terms ‘sarcopenia’, ‘muscle’, ‘body composition’, ‘hepatocellular
carcinoma’, followed by a manual review of the literature
to select articles evaluating the influence of sarcopenia on
HCC treatments and outcomes.
Curative treatments
Liver resection
The usefulness of the assessment of the nutritional status in
patients undergoing hepatectomy is known since 1994,
when Fan et al. [17] studied two groups of patients randomly assigned to receive or not preoperative intravenous
nutritional support (branched-chain amino acids, lipid
emulsion and dextrose). The main difference found was a
reduction in septic complication after surgery, the need of
diuretic therapy to reduce ascites and less deterioration of
liver function as measured by the change in the rate of
clearance of indocyanine green ( – 2.8% vs. – 4.8% at
20 min, p = 0.05), and more importantly a reduction of inhospital mortality. As regards studies specifically addressing the role of sarcopenia in patients undergoing liver
resection (summarized in Table 2), the first study evaluating the relationship between sarcopenia and the prognosis
of patients with HCC following hepatic resection was made
by Harimoto et al. in 2013 [18]. In this study, the crosssectional areas of skeletal muscles (psoas, erector spinae,

hepatectomy was reported by Voron et al. [20] in 2015. In
this study, sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle index
(SMI) (example in Fig. 1) less than 52.4 cm2
/m2 for men
and less than 38.9 cm2
/m2 for women. Sarcopenia was
correlated with the presence of a more undifferentiated
HCC (p = 0.015) and the presence of satellite nodules
(p = 0.031) than non-sarcopenic patients. Voron and collaborators [20] also showed that sarcopenia was a strong
and independent prognostic factor for mortality (Hazard
Ratio [HR] = 3.19, 95% Confidence intervals [CI]
1.28–7.96; p = 0.013) and recurrence (HR = 3.03, 95% CI
1.67–5.49; p = 0.001) after liver resection for HCC. These
results were confirmed by a later study by Takagi et al.
[22], which used a different cut-off to define sarcopenia,
respectively, 46.4 cm2
/m2 for men and 37.6 cm2/m2 for
women, but they also found the overall 5-year survival rate
after hepatectomy was significantly lower in the sarcopenic
group compared to the non-sarcopenic group (58.2% vs.
82.4%, log-rank p = 0.0002) [22], moreover, they found
that sarcopenia was correlated with the presence of
microvascular invasions (p = 0.003) and the tumor stage
(p = 0.015) [22].
Interestingly, the risk of recurrence after liver resection
was found to be associated with the combined presence of a
sarcopenic high BMI. Indeed, another research group [23],
using further different cut-off values for SMI (43.75 cm2
/
m2 and 41.10 cm2
/m2 for males and females, respectively),
found that there was no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications and 90-day mortality between the
patients with and without sarcopenia; however, they further
stratified their cohort according to the BMI (BMI \22 and
BMI [ 22), finding at multivariate analysis that poorly
differentiated tumor cells, microvascular invasion and a
low SMI were independently associated with an increased
risk of recurrence (HR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5; p= 0.02).
As regards the immediate outcomes after liver resection,
sarcopenic patients were found to have a smaller preoperative total functional liver volume (TFLV) compared with
non-sarcopenic patients undergoing liver resection (2% vs
2.3%, p \0,05) [19], and these findings may negatively
affect short-term outcomes after liver resection. However,
little is known about the effect of sarcopenia on short-term
outcome after resection, such as the occurrence of posthepatectomy liver failure,in a Japanese study [21] evaluating the impact of total psoas muscle area (TPA), patients
with sarcopenia revealed a significantly higher rate of liver
failure (International study group of liver surgery grading
[ISGLS] grade C and B) (33% vs 16%, p = 0.003), major
complications assessed with Clavien grade C3 (54 vs 37%,
p = 0.011), and intra-abdominal abscess (29 vs 18%,
p = 0.040) and a longer hospitalization (39 vs 30 days,
p\ 0.001) than those without sarcopenia. The optimal cutoff for normalized TPA [21] associated with the development of liver failure was for males 567 mm2
/m2, and for

(fist: a, b, c; second: d, e, f) demonstrated two large hepatic lesions
consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma due to the arterialization

delayed phases (arrows in b and e). The diagnosis was confirmed by
histology after surgical treatments in both patients. The evaluations at
the level of the soma of the third lumbar vertebra by using dedicated
free software revealed no sarcopenia in the first patient (c) and
sarcopenia in the second one (f)

females 395 mm2
/m2, respectively. The odds ratio (OR)
reported for post hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) prediction by sarcopenia was 2.44 (95% CI 1.20–4.99,
p = 0.012). More recent studies [24, 25] showed the role of
sarcopenic obesity on prognosis after hepatectomy; in the
study by Kobayashi et al. [25] patients were classified on
the basis of body composition into four groups as nonsarcopenic non-obesity (39%), non-sarcopenic obesity
(47%), sarcopenic non- obesity (7%) and sarcopenic obesity (7%). The OS and the recurrence-free survival rates
after hepatectomy for HCC were significantly lower in the
sarcopenic obesity group than in the non-sarcopenic nonobese group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, respectively). In
conclusion, the preventive study of sarcopenia before liver
resection spreads only over the past decade and with different methods and proposed cut-offs; the depletion of
muscle mass in HCC patients seems to be dependent on the
underlying liver disease and to the aggressiveness of the
HCC. While there are only isolated studies that need validation regarding the risk of HCC recurrence after treatment and PHLF, robust data are available on the predictive
role of sarcopenia assessment before liver resection and
patients’ OS.
Radiofrequency ablation therapy
To date, poor data exist about the impact of sarcopenia on
radiofrequency ablation therapy (RFA). Only one study
[26] evaluated the predictive role of skeletal muscle mass
on survival for HCC patients undergoing percutaneous
RFA therapy. In this study, the evaluation for muscle mass
was conducted using pre-treatment psoas muscle index
(PMI, cm2
/m2) on the Computed Tomography (CT) images. Using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
analysis for survival, the optimal cut-off point for PMI was
6.31 cm2
/m2 in males (Area under ROC curve [AUROC]
0.74, sensitivity 86.5%, specificity 56.8%) and 3.91 cm2
/
m2 in females (AUROC 0.76, sensitivity 72.0%, specificity
78.3%). Patients with low PMI showed a reduced rate of
survival than those without, being PMI an independent
predictor for survival (HR 6.867 at multivariate analysis)
[26]. Even less is known about the role of sarcopenia on
percutaneous ethanol injection, so it might be interesting to
evaluate its impact also on the outcome of this percutaneous technique.
Liver transplantation
Sarcopenia is frequently encountered in patients with EndStage Liver Disease (ESLD), and, for this reason, several
studies have tried to show that sarcopenia, in turn, could be
a major predictor of adverse clinical outcome measures
also in liver transplantation (LT) [27](Table 3). Notably,
most of the studies evaluating the prognostic role of sarcopenia in LT setting included patients undergoing or who
have undergone LT irrespective of the presence of HCC. In
addition, different skeletal muscle mass measurements
have been used or even functional assessments of strength/
performance, thus making comparisons among different
studies difficult to perform. Regardless of the various
definitions of sarcopenia used, several studies have
demonstrated that it represents a risk factor for mortality
among LT candidates. In particular, sarcopenia measured
by lumbar three skeletal muscle index (L3 SMI) was first
demonstrated by Tandon et al. [45] to be a 2.4-fold independent risk factor for mortality in patients awaiting LT.
Similarly, in another study, transverse psoas muscle
thickness (TMPT)/height ratio was associated with an
increase of 15% of waiting list mortality for every unit of
decrease of TMPT [31]. Even larger and multicenter
studies confirmed the correlation between sarcopenia and
waiting list survival [38]. Such findings prompted the
transplant community to add sarcopenia to the Model for
End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for better predicting patients’ survival while in-list. In fact, although MELD
score has always been used to prioritize patients with
ESLD for LT, it may underestimate disease severity in
many cases. Montano-Loza et al. [34] described how
MELD-sarcopenia (defined as L3 SMI) score was associated with improvement in the prediction of 3-month mortality in patients evaluated for LT, with the best benefit in
patients with low MELD score (\15). In particular, if
present, sarcopenia (i.e. males with BMI \ 25: \43 cm2
/
m2
, males with BMI C 25: \53 cm2/m2, females: 41 cm2/
m2
) was equivalent to adding 10 points to MELD score. On
the contrary, Van Vugt et al. [40] in a multicenter European
cohort of 585 patients listed for LT, showed that although
the presence of sarcopenia was associated with an
increased waiting list mortality, adding these measurements to the currently used organ allocation system in the
Netherlands did not provide any additional benefit in predicting mortality compared to MELD score alone [40].
Sarcopenia was found to be associated also with the
outcomes of LT once transplant was carried out. In particular, sarcopenia was associated with postoperative
complications (including mortality), intensive care unit
(ICU)/hospital stay and survival. According to a recent
meta-analysis [46], there are only few studies focusing on
the association between complications after LT and sarcopenia defined by either total psoas area (OR = 0.48 per
increase in standard deviation of the area) [32] or volume
(OR = 3.06) [36]. In the latter study, all severe complications (Clavien grade C III, 23.4%) occurred in the sarcopenic group, although liver resections were also included
in the same analysis. Others, instead, demonstrated a positive association between sarcopenia and rate of infection/

sepsis [28], especially when of bacterial origin [33].
Among them, pneumonia was the most frequently described complication and responsible for longer ICU stay (due
to more days of intubation) [29] and, in turn, for longer
length of hospital stay and higher failure-to-rescue in such
frail patients [35].
With regard to survival, a meta-analysis by Van Vugt
et al. [46] showed a pooled HR of 1.84, which increased to
2.21 when only studies that measured psoas muscle area
were included (heterogeneity from 60 to 49%). More
recently, a study by Golse et al. [42] demonstrated that the
1- and 5-year survival rates were significantly poorer in the
sarcopenic group than in the non-sarcopenic group (59%
vs. 94% and 54% vs. 80%, p\ 0.001). However, the largest contribution to survival came from the higher rate of
90-day or within 1-year mortality observed in the sarcopenic group [24, 33, 36]. Instead, when looking to HCC
patients, since reduced skeletal muscle mass could lead to
the decrease of certain cytokines (myokines and adipokines) and to the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a,
such a combined effect was suggested to impact survival
also by promoting tumor progression and recurrence after
LT [44].
As regards living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT), a
study by Kaido et al. [30] showed that the OS rate in
patients with preoperative low skeletal muscle mass was
lower than in those without (p\ 0.001).
Another more recent study by Itoh et al. [39] including
153 patients undergoing LDLT showed that patients with
low skeletal muscle mass-to-visceral fat area ratio (SVR)
assessed by CT had a significantly poorer prognosis than
those without both for recurrence-free (p = 0.01) and
overall (p = 0.03) survival.
A more recent field of investigation is represented by the
development of sarcopenia after LT, namely ‘‘de novo’’
sarcopenia, which is reported ranging between 15 and 25%
of patients [37, 43]. However, it is more likely that sarcopenia was already present at the time of LT and then
progressed after transplant. Many factors occurring after
LT may be responsible for the decrease in lean body mass,
including infections, renal dysfunction or lack of specific
nutritional diets. Also, the use of immunosuppressive
agents such as mTOR and calcineurin inhibitors may have
an additional role [47]. In conclusion, sarcopenia can be
predictive of poor outcomes in LT, thus offering the possibility to clinicians to improve the muscular status of these
patients, especially those with high-grade sarcopenia and,
therefore, at high risk of mortality both in the waiting list
period and after transplant.
Transarterial chemo- and radio-embolization
Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment modality for asymptomatic, large or
multifocal HCC patients, without macrovascular invasion
or extrahepatic metastasis (intermediate HCC, BCLC stage
B) [48]. Many independent factors influence the prognosis
of patients treated with TACE and many of them are not
tumour-related but are related to the individual patient
characteristics. For example, it is well demonstrated and
widely accepted that age, total bilirubin, alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) and ascites represent some important prognostic
factors for patients treated with TACE [48–50]. Recently,
the ability to perform non-invasive measurement of sarcopenia has facilitated the use of sarcopenia as a prognostic
factor in many medical fields, such as in patients with liver
diseases [12, 51, 52]. However, to date, the impact of
sarcopenia on tumour response and OS in patients receiving TACE therapy has not been largely assessed (Table 4).
Four studies had examined the role of skeletal muscle
volume and its changes in HCC patients who received
TACE [14, 53–55]. Two of these studies investigated
patients undergoing TACE for primary liver cancer
[53, 54], while the other two were conducted among
patients who underwent TACE for both primary and secondary malignancies of the liver [14, 55].

These studies demonstrated that patients with progressive muscle hypotrophy after TACE had a significant
decrease in OS. In Fujita et al. [54] series, the multivariate
analysis showed that changes in psoas muscle index (PMI),
a surrogate of sarcopenia, per month during the TACE
period was significantly associated with poor OS (HR
1.884, P = 0.001, 95% CI 1.305–2.72, p = 0.001) [54].
Similarly, Kobayshi et al. [53] investigated the prognostic
value of skeletal muscle loss (SML) stratified by cut-offs
for sarcopenia and the rate of change in skeletal muscle
mass over 6 months after TACE. The multivariate analysis
revealed that SML was independently predictive of poor
OS (HR, 1.675,95% CI 1.031–2.721; P = 0.037) with
serum AFP C 20 ng/mL (HR, 2.550; 95% CI 1.440–4.515;
p = 0.001) and maximum tumour diameter C 30 mm (HR,
1.925; 95% CI 1.166–3.179; P = 0.010) [53]. However,
data regarding the prognostic role of pre-interventional
sarcopenia remain controversial. Kobayashi et al. and
Fujita et al. showed no significant association between
muscle volume mass at baseline and clinical outcome
[53, 54]. However, Loosen et al. and Dodson et al. [14, 55]
similarly showed that pre-interventional sarcopenia was an
independent predictor for an unfavorable outcome
(respectively HR 2.876, 95% CI 1.044–7.922, p = 0.041
and HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.03–3.64, P = 0.04) [14, 55]. These
data are similar to those of previously published series of
patients with HCC treated with modalities different from
TACE procedures [13, 18, 23, 57–60].
Interestingly, Loosen et al. [14] also demonstrated that
pre-interventional sarcopenia did not correlate with treatment response to TACE (OR 0.704, 95% CI 0.494–1.003,
p = 0.052) [14]. Besides, Dodson et al. [55] showed that
baseline sarcopenia was not associated with the risk of
periprocedural morbidity after TACE (OR 0.89, 95% CI
0.28–2.86, p = 0.84) [55]. These data probably establish
that the prognostic impact of sarcopenia on TACE depends
on its role over the general clinical conditions of cirrhotic
patients with HCC and not directly on its role on the local
efficacy of TACE (evaluated by tumour response or
periprocedural morbidity). However, these preliminary
results need to be confirmed with more robust data before
introducing these concepts in daily clinical practice.
If there is little scientific evidence for TACE, the role of
sarcopenia in the field of trans-arterial radioembolization
(TARE) has been even less investigated. To the best of our
knowledge, only one recent study investigated the impact

of sarcopenia in HCC patients treated with TARE [56]. In
particular, Faron et al. [56] evaluated the value fat-free
muscle area (FFMA) as a marker of sarcopenia to predict
clinical outcomes in patients receiving TARE for treatment
of unresectable HCC (14). FFMA as a measure of lean
muscle mass was identified as an independent prognostic
factor of OS (HR 2.675, 95% CI, 1.255–5.702, P = 0.011)
and seems to provide significant prognostic information on
the OS in patients receiving TARE for the treatment of
HCC [56].
In conclusion, the assessment of sarcopenia could provide additional prognostic information beyond established
biomarkers and, moreover, may also help to further stratify
the patients in order to optimize the selection criteria for
receiving TACE or TARE for treatment of unresectable HCC. However, most of these data are derived
from retrospective studies involving a relatively small
number of patients. Future prospective studies with larger
sample size and longer observation are required to provide
more robust evidence about the prognostic role of sarcopenia in HCC patients receiving trans-arterial therapies
such as TACE and TARE and to reveal whether the prevention of skeletal muscle depletion might contribute to
improving clinical outcomes.
Systemic therapies
The assessment of sarcopenia is a useful tool in oncologic
settings, particularly in patients with advanced oncologic
disease, since they are exposed to several cancer-specific
and non-cancer-specific factors causing decrease in muscle
mass and muscle dysfunction [61]. As cancer progresses to
unresectable or metastatic stage, possible treatments are
often limited to systemic therapy and the patients present
higher prevalence of sarcopenia [62]. In many different
types of cancers, sarcopenia has been shown to be a
prognostic factor for disease progression, OS, response to
treatments, poor performance status and toxicity caused by
chemotherapy [4, 63–65]. Similarly, in the past decade,
some papers established the prognostic role of sarcopenia
in cirrhotic patients who underwent systemic therapy for
hepatocellular carcinoma, even if they mostly focused on
Sorafenib-based regimens (Table 5). Sorafenib is the first
orally active multi-kinase inhibitor that has been confirmed
to be efficacious in patients with advanced HCC [73],
representing today the standard first-line treatment [74],
however, it may cause many different side effects, such as
fatigue and diarrhea, up to hand-foot syndrome and liver
dysfunction, which may lead to dose reduction or treatment
interruption [75, 76]. First data about sarcopenia in Sorafenib regimen for advanced HCC were described in 2012,
when Mir et al. [16] established that sarcopenia was
independently correlated with the occurrence of early doselimiting Sorafenib toxicities (DLTs) in patients who have
advanced HCC with Child–Pugh A liver cirrhosis, also
describing a significative prevalence of grade 3 diarrhea in
sarcopenic patients. Few years later, in 2015 a Japanese
study [66] first provided the prognostic role of sarcopenia
in patients undergoing Sorafenib for HCC, measuring by
CT-scans the L3 SMI. L3-SMI was identified as independent prognostic factors in HCC patients treated with Sorafenib (p = 0.020), with an OS significantly shorter in
patients with L3 SMI \ = 39.2 cm2
/m2 (p = 0.003).
Nevertheless, in this cohort of 40 patients with HCC, L3
SMI did not appear to be a significant risk factor for dose
reduction or discontinuation of Sorafenib.
Successively, a larger retrospective study [67] conducted on 232 patients with unresectable HCC established
a significantly reduced OS after Sorafenib treatment in
sarcopenic patients versus non-sarcopenic ones (174 vs.
454 days, p\ 0.0001), confirming sarcopenia assessed by
L3 SMI as an independent predictor factor of OS (HR
0.365). Sarcopenia-group presented as well significantly
lower objective response rate (p = 0.0146) and disease
control rate (p = 0.0151), compared with non-sarcopenia
group. Similarly, Takada et al. [70] evaluated pre-sarcopenia (established according to the standard proposed by
Japan Society of Hepatology [77] with L3 SMI in CTscans \42 cm2
/m2 in males and 38 cm2/m2 in females)
and its role in 214 patients with advanced HCC treated with
Sorafenib. They found that OS in patients with pre-sarcopenia tended to be worse than that of the control group,
even if not significantly (252 vs. 284 days, p = 0.16), with
bigger differences after stratification of the study cohort by
prognostic factors. In fact, in the subgroup who had three
or more negative prognostic factors, the presence of presarcopenia did not correlate with prognosis, while in the
subgroup with two or less prognostic factors, the OS in presarcopenic patients was significantly lower (HR 1.6,
p = 0.047); even in this study, no association between presarcopenia and sorafenib treatment duration or dose
reduction was observed. Differently, a European multicentric retrospective study [15] in a cohort of patients who
underwent Sorafenib found that sarcopenia (assessed by L3
SMI) was significantly associated with patients OS (63 vs.
32 weeks, HR 1.69, p = 0.02), with a reduced duration of
treatment among sarcopenic patients (25.8 vs. 12.3 weeks,
HR 1.75, p = 0.0044) and with sorafenib-related toxicity
(adverse events grade 3 and 4, 62% vs. 40%, p = 0.04).
The prognostic impact of body composition in advanced
HCC patients treated with Sorafenib was also investigated
by Saeki et al. [71] which analysed the pre-treatment
depletion muscle mass with L3-SMI and visceral fat area
(VFA) at umbilical level using CT images. They found that
the absence of muscle depletion (HR = 0.498, p = 0.006),
and a value of VFA [ = 100 cm2 (HR = 0.556,
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:927–943 937
123

p = 0.031) were significant factors for long-term survival,
higher disease control rate (p = 0.012) and longer duration
of treatment, with a higher total amount of Sorafenib
administered.
New interesting data are now available by the longitudinal and dynamic evaluation of sarcopenia changes before
and after Sorafenib treatment of advanced HCC patients for
predicting the patients’ outcomes. As example, Hiraoka
et al. [68] showed that the value of psoas muscle area index
(PSI) was significantly reduced at follow-up CT-scans, at
8–12 weeks after starting Sorafenib treatment. A similar
effect is likely due to the antiangiogenic characteristics of
Sorafenib, which appears to directly inhibit protein synthesis, as already observed in other oncologic settings [78].
According to Yamashima et al. [69], the variation of
skeletal muscle thickness, before and after 1–3 months of
Sorafenib treatment, resulted to be an independent factor
for OS (p = 0.0439, HR = 1.99271). Differently from the
studies above, this group established skeletal loss thickness
assessing Transverse Psoas Muscle Thickness over height
(TPMT/height), through CT-images at the level of the
umbilicus.
Finally, a recent, more comprehensive study was conducted by Imai et al. [72] assessing visceral fat mass index
(VFMI), subcutaneous fat mass index (SFMI), L3 SMI and
relative changes of such indexes (DVFMI, DSFMI and
DL3SMI) before and after Sorafenib treatment (120 days).
Patients within the 20th percentiles cut-offs for DL3SMI,
DSFMI and DVFMI were classified into a rapid depletion
group. Confirming the above literature, baseline-sarcopenic
patients showed reduced survival than those without
(p = 0.0157). In addition, rapid depletion group, according

to DSFMI and DL3SMI, showed a significantly poorer
survival too (respectively p = 0.0101 and p = 0.0027).

4.109, p = \0.001) and DL3SMI [ = 5.73 (HR 4.010,
p\ 0.001) were independent predictors of survival.
As far as other systemic therapy for advanced HCC, to
our knowledge there is poor evidence regarding the prognostic role of muscle mass, especially considering the
recently approved Regorafenib or other promising molecules, such as metronomic Capecitabine, Lenvatinib,
Nivolumab, Cabozantinib or Ramucirumab [79]. Less
recent studies [80, 81] have been published regarding the
combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX
regimen) as second-line treatment in advanced HCC,even
in these cohorts of patients, a significantly shorter OS was
described in sarcopenic patients. Lately, a new interest has
been growing about Lenvatinib, which, unlike Sorafenib,
appears to induce a minimum, non-significant, muscle loss,
even after 24 months of treatment for unresectable HCC:
this may be correlated with the positive clinical response
and its low toxicity [82]. However, the initial expectations
were disappointed since a multicentric study [83] on 152
unresectable-HCC patients showed a relative reduction in
muscle volume at 4 and 12 weeks after starting Lenvatinib
in 35.3% of subjects, even if these findings have not yet
been related to patients outcome and HCC response. In
conclusion, sarcopenia has been assessed as a well-recognized predictive factor of poor prognosis in patients treated
with Sorafenib for advanced HCC, both at baseline and as a
change through the treatment time. Its role in predicting
HCC response or chemotherapy toxicities tolerability
needs to be deepened since studies published showed
conflicting data. In the same way, new evidences needs to
be produced about sarcopenia and new agents’ therapy, in
order to better target systemic treatments on HCC patients.
Future perspectives
Improving sarcopenia in liver cirrhosis
By the way sarcopenia has an important role in defining the
prognosis of cirrhotic patients, several authors tried to find
a strategy to improve this condition in these patients. Most
literature is focused on the effect of physical exercise in
cirrhotic patients [84–87], but there is no specific evidence
that exercise can reverse sarcopenia in this setting. However, it seems reasonable to suggest that physical therapy,
when tolerated, may help prevent further loss of muscle
mass [88–90]. The effects of exercise in sarcopenic patients
might be explained by stimulation of mTOR signaling,
inhibition of muscle apoptosis by decreasing local TNF-a
levels, stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity and
increased blood flow to the skeletal muscle [91, 92]. An
example of physical activity recommended is walking
30–40 min three or four times per week and lifting light
weights such as hand weights two to three times per week
[88]. A study by Aemann et al. [93] evaluated the efficacy
of progressive resistance exercise in cirrhotic patients
compared to a control group. They found that the exercise
group increased their quadriceps cross-sectional area of
10%, greater gain than that of the control group (p \0.01)
[93]. Other studies evaluated the impact of nutritional
supplementation in cirrhotic patients. In a study by Ohara
et al. in 2018 [94] the authors evaluated the supplementation of L-Carnitine, comparing the PMI before and after
supplementation. The D PMI/ month value (D PMI/month
(%) = ([psoas muscle area on the second CT scan – psoas
muscle area on the initial CT scan]/psoas muscle area on
the initial CT scan) 9 100/interval between CT scans (m))
was 0.27% in the group with the supplementation of
L-Carinitine and - 1.24% in the control group, with a
significant difference (p\ 0.01) both in males and
females. Another similar study [95] evaluated the metabolic and molecular response to branched-chain amino
acids (BCAA) enriched with leucine in six well-compensated alcoholic cirrhosis compared to controls; the authors
found that a large dose of supplemental leucine was able to
overcome the skeletal muscle anabolic resistance in cirrhosis, better than with BCAA alone.
Finally, Hiraoka et al. [96] analysed the combined effect
of BCAA supplementation and walking exercise to prevent
sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients. The alimentary supplementation consisted of a late-evening snack (protein
13.5 g, including L-leucine 1922.5 mg, 210 kcal/day) and
additional 2000 steps/day to the normal routine for
3 months. The ratio of muscle volume changed from 1.0 to
1.013 (p \0.01), as observed using the bioelectrical
impedance analysis (BIA) method, and also leg and
handgrip strength changed significantly (p\0.01) [96].
Improving sarcopenia before and after HCC
treatment
As regards sarcopenia treatment in patients with HCC,
scarce evidence is to date available. Koya et al. [97]
evaluated the effects of in-hospital therapeutic exercise on
liver function and skeletal muscle mass after HCC treatment (85% TACE) in patients with chronic liver diseases.
They used a combination of a 20-min lasting exercise to be
performed already during the hospitalization starting from
the subsequent day of the HCC treatment for all patients.
The patient’s body weight decreased significantly during
hospitalization together with the skeletal muscle mass
measured with BIA, except for the right arm. Notably, in
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:927–943 939
123

the patients previously under treatment with BCAA the
decrease of muscle mass was lower than that of other
patients who only made exercise ( – 0.5 kg vs – 1.1 kg)
[97]. However, the exercise improved physical ability
without worsening liver function.
The same authors [98] in a subsequent study including
patients with HCC who underwent TACE identified two
groups: patients performing exercise (n = 102) and controls (n = 107). The authors evaluated SMI and PMI before
TACE and 50 days after, after treatment, the DPMI and
DSMI were significantly higher in the exercise group than
in the control group; this discrepancy between the two
studies may be explained by the methodological differences in evaluation of SMI (BIA vs CT scan images of the
abdominal cross-sectional area at the level of L3) [98].
A similar study [99] evaluated the effect of cancer
rehabilitation (CR) on the prognosis of patients with HCC
who underwent TACE. CR, a new multidisciplinary
intervention for cancer patients, consists of nutritional and
physical therapy. Patients were classified into the CR
(n = 85) and control (n = 67) groups and they evaluate the
change in SMI. After treatment with TACE, DSMI was
significantly higher in the CR group than in the control
group (p = 0.02). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the CR and control groups
regarding the DSMI in male patients [99]. Other studies
were focused on patients belonging to the LT setting. The
cornerstone of these studies [100] consisted in a pretransplant nutritional supplementation. Enteral supplementation improved parameters of nutritional status pretransplant and mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle
circumference and grip strength, but it had no effect on the
outcomes of LT. Finally, other authors [101, 102] investigated the role of physical exercise in cirrhotic patients on
LT waiting list on hospital stay, 1-year mortality and
morbidity after LT and related adverse events, but, however, no randomized clinical trial evaluated its impact in
reducing sarcopenia or in outcome changes after LT. In
conclusion, nutritional supplementation and physical
exercise seem to be a reasonable intervention to reduce
sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients in order to prevent complications in the eventuality of HCC occurrence and
treatment. Sarcopenia treatment for improving the nutritional status of the patients seems to be not feasible
between HCC occurrence and treatment due to the slowness of the recovery process, as also witnessed by the lack
of studies in this timeframe. On the other hand, limited data
are available on interventions made after HCC treatment in
order to improve survival. Thus, further prospective, larger,
well-designed and with standardized parameters studies are
need in order to evaluate the effect of interventions such as
nutritional supplementations and physical activity in
patients who undergone HCC treatments.
Conclusions
Several studies evaluated the predictive role of sarcopenia
assessment before HCC treatments. Steady evidence is
almost available on the prediction of survival of patients
undergoing liver resection, transplantation and Sorafenib.
However, most of the evidence came from eastern studies
using different methods to assess sarcopenia with different
cut-offs. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of
sarcopenia in other HCC treatment settings and to address a
possible utility as an additional staging tool for identifying
the most appropriate treatment. Besides, interventional
studies aiming at increasing the skeletal muscle mass for
reducing complications and increasing the survival of a
given HCC treatment are needed.
