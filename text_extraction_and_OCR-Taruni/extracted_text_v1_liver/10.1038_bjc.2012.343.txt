BACKGROUND: Paracentesis for malignant ascites is usually performed as an in-patient procedure, with a median length of stay (LoS) of
3–5 days, with intermittent clamping of the drain due to a perceived risk of hypotension. In this study, we assessed the safety of free
drainage and the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of daycase paracentesis.
METHOD: Ovarian cancer admissions at Hammersmith Hospital between July and October 2009 were audited (Stage 1). A total of
21 patients (Stage 2) subsequently underwent paracentesis with free drainage of ascites without intermittent clamping
(October 2010–January 2011). Finally, 13 patients (19 paracenteses, Stage 3), were drained as a daycase (May–December 2011).
RESULTS: Of 67 patients (Stage 1), 22% of admissions and 18% of bed-days were for paracentesis, with a median LoS of 4 days. In all,
81% of patients (Stage 2) drained completely without hypotension. Of four patients with hypotension, none was tachycardic or
symptomatic. Daycase paracentesis achieved complete ascites drainage without complications, or the need for in-patient admission in
94.7% of cases (Stage 3), and cost d954 compared with d1473 for in-patient drainage.
CONCLUSIONS: Free drainage of malignant ascites is safe. Daycase paracentesis is feasible, cost-effective and reduces hospital
admissions, and potentially represents the standard of care for patients with malignant ascites.

Malignant ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal
cavity caused by an underlying cancer (Agarwal and Kaye, 2003).
Around 15–50% of all cancer patients will develop malignant
ascites (Ayantunde and Parsons, 2007). It is most commonly seen
in ovarian, where it is present in 36% of women at the time of
diagnosis of ovarian cancer (EOC), and is present in approximately
60% at the time of death (Sorbe and Frankendal, 1983). Other
cancers associated with malignant ascites are primary peritoneal,
endometrial, breast, pancreatic and gastrointestinal malignancies
(Ayantunde and Parsons, 2007). The presence of large volume
ascites causes abdominal discomfort, anorexia, nausea and
vomiting, and deterioration in quality of life. Palliation of
symptoms with minimal distress is therefore paramount.
In-patient paracentesis is the most commonly used procedure in
over 85% of cases, which achieves prompt relief of symptoms
(Macdonald et al, 2006; Keen et al, 2010). In-patient admission for
paracentesis of malignant ascites utilises over 28 000 hospitals beddays annually, and has a significant impact on healthcare resources
and is onerous for patients (HESOnline, 2008). Malignant ascites
re-accumulates in patients with disease progression. Diuretics have
been used to diminish re-accumulation, with variable benefit and
risk of dehydration and renal dysfunction (Ayantunde and
Parsons, 2007). Other strategies for the management of recurrent
ascites have included the use of peritoneovenous (PV) shunts,
intraperitoneal (IP) interferon-alpha and tumour-necrosis factor
(Rath et al, 1991; Hirte et al, 1997; White et al, 2011b). In addition,
recent studies have demonstrated potential benefit from IP
catumaxomab, a tri-functional antibody to CD3, EpCAM with a
functional Fc domain and VEGF targeting with bevacizumab and
aflibercept (Hu et al, 2005; Numnum et al, 2006; Hamilton et al,
2008; Kobold et al, 2009; Heiss et al, 2010; Gotlieb et al, 2011).
However, PV shunts are associated with complications including
pulmonary oedema, major vein thrombosis and disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy in 38% of patients (White et al, 2011b).
Catumaxomab leads to pyrexia, nausea and abdominal pain due to
cytokine release in over 60% on patients, and VEGF inhibition is
associated with fatal bowel perforation in a subset of patients
(Kobold et al, 2009; Heiss et al, 2010; Gotlieb et al, 2011). The
recent development of indwelling tunnelled catheters potentially
offers patients with recurrent ascites, at short intervals, a safer
alternative, albeit with the inconvenience, discomfort and infection
risk of a long-term indwelling catheter (White et al, 2011a).
The Hospital Episode Statistics suggest an average length of
in-patient stay (LoS) for paracentesis of 4 days (HESOnline, 2008).
This is due to the common practice of intermittent clamping of

drains, because of a perceived risk of hypotension with free
drainage, based on historical experience with paracentesis for
transudative ascites due to hypo-albuminaemia and portal
hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. These patients
frequently require intravenous fluid replacement, and many
gastroenterology units routinely co-administer human albumin
solution. Malignant ascites develops as a consequence of peritoneal
carcinomatosis, portal vein compression and lymphatic invasion
(Tan et al, 2006; Tamsma, 2007). Recent preclinical and clinical
data have also identified a key role of VEGF and increased vascular
permeability in the development of ascites, as also demonstrated
by the efficacy of bevacizumab and aflibercept in some patients
(Hu et al, 2005; Numnum et al, 2006; Tan et al, 2006; Tamsma,
2007; Hamilton et al, 2008). In view of the difference in the
pathophysiology of malignant ascites, a recent study of 18 women
(23 episodes of paracentesis) with ovarian cancer suggested that
free drainage of malignant ascites was safe and did not cause
significant hypotension (Decruze et al, 2010). Similarly, Gotlieb
et al (1998) have previously shown that free drainage is associated
with only modest (6 mm Hg) fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP), but
no changes in diastolic BP, and is safe. Because in-patient admissions
limit the quality of life of patients with advanced disease; daycase
paracentesis if possible is a potentially preferable alternative.
However, the attempts of Decruze et al (2010) to perform
paracentesis as a daycase procedure was associated with a 44%
admission rate due to incomplete drainage of ascites, whereas in
another study in a hospice setting, daycase paracentesis achieved
only partial fluid drainage (Stephenson and Gilbert, 2002).
Concerns over the risk of hypotension, the small size of the
Decruze study, the lack of independent validation of their results
and high admission or partial drainage rates continue to limit the
adoption of daycase paracentesis clinically (Stephenson and
Gilbert, 2002; Macdonald et al, 2006; Decruze et al, 2010).
To address these issues, we audited our in-patient bed utilisation
for paracentesis, and re-assessed the safety of free drainage of
ascites. Reasons for high admission rates owing to partial drainage
in the previous study related to delays in drain insertion and slow
fluid drainage. To eliminate the need for in-patient admission
while retaining high rates of complete drainage, we evaluated the
feasibility of daycase paracentesis, with radiological insertion of
drains instead of junior doctors. We also determined the costeffectiveness of such a strategy relative to in-patient paracentesis.
METHOD
This study was conducted in three stages.
Stage 1 – audit of admissions
An audit of all the 67 in-patient admissions (Stage 1) between July
and October 2009, for ovarian cancer, to the Department of
Oncology, Hammersmith Hospital, London, was performed to
assess the proportion of in-patient resources utilised for ascitic
drainage. Data on the reason for admission, LoS and whether
patients were chemonaive, on chemotherapy, relapsing or in the
terminal phase were collected from the oncology electronic patient
database. For paracentesis, patients were marked for drainage
using ultrasound guidance in radiology, and the drain was inserted
on the medical ward by a junior doctor.
Stage 2 – safety of free drainage
A total of 21 consecutive patients with EOC requiring ascitic
drainage between October 2010 and January 2011 were drained
without intermittent clamping of the drain. The baseline
characteristics of the patients (Stage 2) are shown in Table 1.
Patients were admitted as in-patients, the drain insertion site
marked by ultrasound in radiology, and the catheter was sited by a
junior doctor on the ward. Following the drain insertion, catheters
were left unclamped. The drain was re-clamped if the systolic
blood pressure fell to o95 mm Hg or the patient was unwell.
A proforma (Supplementary Material 1) was used to prospectively record: date and time of admission; ultrasound marking for
drainage and drain insertion; BP and heart rate prior to drain
insertion, during drainage and hourly for 2 h following drain
removal; and the total volume of ascites drained at specified time
intervals. The renal function, albumin, platelet count and clotting

prior to drain insertion were recorded. The following data was
collected retrospectively from the medical and nursing notes: route
of admission, LoS, stage, grade and histology of ovarian cancer,
months since diagnosis, treatment history and the use of antihypertensives and anticoagulants.
Stage 3 – feasibility and cost-effectiveness of daycase
paracentesis
The feasibility of complete fluid drainage, without complication or
the need for in-patient admission, as a daycase with radiological
drain insertion, was evaluated in patients requiring non-emergency paracentesis (Supplementary Figure 1). Patients were
eligible for daycase paracentesis if their performance status was
0–2, they were not taking warfarin, did not require hospital
transport, were able to wait 2–7 days for drainage and had normal
platelet counts and coagulation. If patients were on subcutaneous
low-molecular weight heparin, the patient was asked to omit the
dose the night before the procedure (Supplementary Material 2).
All the patients received a Patient Information Sheet to explain the
procedure (Supplementary Material 3). Patients were asked to
complete a questionnaire following daycase paracentesis
(Supplementary Material 4).
To enable complete drainage during working hours, the procedure
was performed with ultrasound guidance prior to 1000 hours.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed, and the largest locule of
ascitic fluid was identified. The overlying skin was infiltrated with 1%
lidocaine, a 2–3-mm incision was made and using the Seldinger
technique, a 145-cm 03500 Fixed Core Curved Safe-T-J Wire Guide
(3 mm) (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) was inserted and the
needle exchanged for a 6-Fr Angiotech Skater drainage catheter
(Angiotech, Vancouver, Canada). The catheter were sutured to the
skin, connected to a Simpla Profile Night Bag (2000 ml) (Coloplast,
Peterborough, UK) and left on free drainage.
No intravenous fluids were administered. Blood pressure and
heart rate were assessed every 15 min in the radiology department
for 1 h, then every 30 min for a second hour. After 2 h, the patient
returned to the day unit. An armchair was made available for all
patients and they were not required to lie flat. At 1600 hours,
patients were reviewed, and if the patient had drained completely,
the drain was removed and the patient is discharged home. If
drainage was incomplete, or the patient became symptomatic, the
patient was admitted. To assess the cost-effectiveness of daycase
paracentesis, we estimated the difference in resources used
between the standard in-patient paracentesis and the daycase
paracentesis, based on the results of Stages 2 and 3 of this study,
respectively. In-patient and daycase paracentesis differed in terms
of length of hospital stay and the staff involved with the drain
insertion. The cost of the drain was assumed to be constant, and
therefore omitted for the cost comparison. Unit costs for these
resources were obtained from the National Schedule of Reference
Costs (Curtis, 2010; NHS Reference Costs 2009–10, 2011).
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were analysed by using the Chi-square test
and continuous variables by using Mann–Whitney U-test, with
Po0.05 used to determine statistical significance. Excel (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA) and SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) were
used to perform all analyses.
RESULTS
Clinical and resource impact of paracentesis for malignant
ascites
There were 67 admissions for 597 bed-days, for ovarian cancer,
over the 4-month audit period (Stage 1). In all, 22% of admissions
and 18% of bed-days were for ascitic drainage (Figure 1), with a
median LoS for paracentesis of 4 days (range 1–26). Patients
requiring ascitic drainage only, without any other procedures or
investigations, had a median LoS of 3 days.
Safety of paracentesis with free ascitic drainage
A total of 21 paracenteses with free drainage of ascites were
performed in 18 patients (Stage 2), between October 2010 and
January 2011 (Table 1). The median age of women undergoing
drainage was 64 years (range 54–84) (Table 1). Three had not
received any prior treatment, including debulking surgery or
chemotherapy. The average time from diagnosis was 24 months
(0–98 months). Five of the patients had previously undergone
ascitic drainage; the average length of time since OR from the
previous paracentesis was 3 months (1–10 months). Overall, 13 of
the patients were on antihypertensive medication and 10 on
anticoagulants.
The average volume of ascites drained was 4500 ml (range 750–
8400 ml). On average, 50% of the total ascitic fluid volume drained
in 3 h, 70% in 6 h and 75% in 8 h (Figure 2). The median LoS for all
patients undergoing drainage of malignant ascites was 7 days.
Those admitted solely for drainage of ascites had a median LoS of 3
days (range 1–13), but if admitted via A&E (Accident and
Emergency), the median LoS increased to 5 days (Table 2).
Of the 21 episodes of paracenteses with free drainage, 5 were
clamped. One ascitic drain was accidentally clamped after 2 h. The
patient was well and not hypotensive. In four patients (19%; 95%
CI 2–36%), the drain was clamped due to a fall in SBP o95 mm Hg
(Figure 3, Supplementary Table 1). However, none of the patients
felt unwell or had a compensatory tachycardia, suggesting that the
fall in BP was in part a re-normalisation of the BP, with the relief of
abdominal discomfort and anxiety (Figure 3). None of these four
patients subsequently developed renal dysfunction (a rise in
creatinine 425 mmol) as a result of their ascites drainage. No
individual patient characteristic predicted for the development of
asymptomatic hypotension, in particular, a low pre-procedure BP
did not predict for the development of asymptomatic hypotension.
Feasibility of daycase paracentesis
Between May and December 2011, 19 paracenteses were performed
as a daycase (Stage 3), on 15 occasions in 11 patients with EOC,
thrice in a patient with bladder cancer and once in patient with
stomach cancer (Table 1). Eighteen out of nineteen paracenteses
(94.6%; 95% CI 74–100%) were to dryness as a daycase. Only one
patient was admitted because the ascitic drain was placed late in
the day, preventing adequate drainage by the close of day. None of
the patients developed hypotension, nor any other complications.

in-patient, 71% (5 of 7) favoured daycase over
in-patient paracentesis, and all 5 of 5 patients who had recurrent
ascites consented to further daycase paracentesis.
Comparative costs of daycase vs in-patient paracentesis
We calculated the cost of in-patient paracentesis with free drainage
based on our results from Stage 2 with a median LoS of 3 days, and
for daycase paracentesis based on Stage 3 of the study. The cost of
in-patient paracentesis was d1473 compared with d954 for daycase
paracentesis, and suggests a cost saving of at least d519 per episode
with a daycase procedure (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Paracentesis is a simple, low-risk procedure that provides rapid
symptomatic relief from malignant ascites. The current practice of
in-patient paracentesis is onerous for patients and consumes
significant healthcare resources. Our study confirms the safety of
free drainage of malignant ascites, and further demonstrates that
in contrast to published studies, complete drainage can be
achieved in a daycase setting in over 94% of patients, with
radiological insertion of drains. The ability to perform complete
paracentesis as an out-patient, within 6–8 h, and with minimal
nursing intervention represents a significant improvement. It
avoids lengthy hospital admission, improves the quality of life in
palliative patients, with savings of over d500 per patient.
Our ability to achieve 495% success rate with daycase
paracentesis compared with the study by Decruze et al (2010) is
likely to relate to planned radiological insertion of drains,
minimising both delays associated with drain insertion by junior

doctors, and a reduction in failed attempts at drain insertion
(Decruze et al, 2010). The drains used in our study were 6 Fr,
which is larger than commonly used Bannano catheters, which is
likely to have also expedited the rate of fluid drainage. Drain
insertion by radiologist also has the advantage of consistency of
the service over time compared with fluctuations that are inherent
with changes in junior doctors on rotational attachments.
However, provided that the drain is sited by a competent nonradiologist under image guidance, and within protected times early
in the working day, the success of such a service should be
reproducible.
Radiological drain insertion is often perceived as a costly option
for paracentesis. However, our data indicate that overall there is a
saving of approximately d519, with daycase compared with inpatient paracentesis. Similarly, an independent cost analysis
reviewed by NICE costed in-patient ascitic drainage at d3145,
PleureX drains at d2466 and daycase paracentesis at d1456 (White
et al, 2011a). The cost savings of a daycase paracentesis service
therefore range between d519 and d1689 relative to in-patient
drainage. Given that paracentesis accounted for more than 28 000
bed-days in hospitals in England during 2007–2008, if implemented nationally, daycase paracentesis has the potential to save the
NHS between 18 000 bed-days and d4–14 million per annum.
Although we have only included good-performance-status
patients in the daycase service so far, our preliminary study
suggests that patients with a poorer performance status are no
more likely to experience haemodynamic compromise. The main
limitation to this study is that most of the patients included
in Stage 3 are ovarian cancer patients. However, of the few
non-gynaecological patients included in the study, we saw no
complications. The practicalities of hospital transport and
day-unit capacity is currently the major obstacle locally preventing
our ability to offer all eligible patients the option of daycase
paracentesis.
The recent positive review of PleureX catheters compared with
in-patient paracentesis urgently raises the issue of the best strategy
for selecting patients for these three alternatives (White et al,
2011a). Although there is a role for long-term indwelling ascitic
drains, such as the commonly used Pleurex and Rocket catheters,
we feel that the majority of patients do not require sufficiently
frequent drainage to necessitate an indwelling drain. Of the
29 patients with ovarian cancer in Stages 2 and 3, only 6 (21%) had
been drained in the previous 17 months (Supplementary Table 2).
This demonstrates that the majority of ovarian cancer patients are
drained for platinum-sensitive relapse, and that daycase paracentesis is the preferred method for drainage. In contrast, in platinumresistant patients, with recurrence ascites, long-term drains may be
considered.
In summary, our results confirm the safety of free ascitic
drainage and demonstrate the feasibility of daycase paracentesis
with complete fluid drainage in over 94% of patients with
radiological catheter insertion. Coupled with it’s cost-effectiveness,
our results suggest that daycase paracentesis can potentially
be considered the primary treatment modality for the management
of malignant ascites, especially with ovarian cancer and good
performance status, and should be an option more widely available
to patients.
