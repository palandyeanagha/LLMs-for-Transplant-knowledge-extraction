Abstract. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the leading causes of liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current treatment strategies of HBV infection including the use of
interferon (IFN)-α and nucleotide analogues such as lamivudine and adefovir have met with only partial
success. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more effective antiviral therapies that can clear HBV
infection with fewer side effects. RNA interference (RNAi), by which a small interfering RNA (siRNA)
induces the gene silence at a post-transcriptional level, has the potential of treating HBV infection. The
successful use of chemically synthesized siRNA, endogenous expression of small hairpin RNA (shRNA)
or microRNA (miRNA) to silence the target gene make this technology towards a potentially rational
therapeutics for HBV infection. However, several challenges including poor siRNA stability, inefficient
cellular uptake, widespread biodistribution and non-specific effects need to be overcome. In this review,
we discuss several strategies for improving the anti-HBV therapeutic efficacy of siRNAs, while avoiding
their off-target effects and immunostimulation. There is an in-depth discussion on the (1) mechanisms of
RNAi, (2) methods for siRNA/shRNA production, (3) barriers to RNAi-based therapies, and (4)
delivery strategies of siRNA for treating HBV infection.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important global
health problem with over 350 million HBV carriers worldwide (1). Approximately one million deaths occur annually
due to HBV-induced liver diseases, which ranges from acute
to chronic infection and from cirrhosis to hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) (2,3). Chronically infected patients have
been treated with interferon-α (IFN-α) and nucleoside
analogs such as lamivudine or adefovir. IFN-α has an
immunomodulatory mechanism of action and the nucleoside
analogues interfere with viral DNA replication. These drugs
are partially effective. Moreover, prolonged therapy with
lamivudine is associated with an increased incidence of viral
resistance. The low efficacy, undesirable side-effects, and
occurrence of resistance to HBV mutations remain the major
obstacles in their clinical application in treating HBV
infection (4–7). The need for alternative therapeutic
approaches has provided the impetus to develop novel
therapeutic reagents for inhibiting HBV replication. Ribozymes, antisense oligodeoxynucleoitdes (ODNs) and DNA
vaccines are being developed to potentially complement
existing antiviral therapies (8–11).
RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural process by which
small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex directs sequencespecific post-transcriptional silencing of homologous genes by
binding to its complementary mRNA and triggering its
elimination (11). It is an evolutionary mechanism for protecting the genome against invasion by mobile genetic elements
such as transposons and viruses. This finding generated huge
interest in applying RNAi for biomedical research. Nomination of RNAi as the “Breakthrough of the year 2002” by the
Journal Science prompted biologists to overhaul their vision
of the cell and its evolution, and discovery of RNAi was
awarded Nobel Prize to Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello
in 2006.
Potent knockdown of a gene of interest with high
sequence specificity makes RNAi a powerful tool for studying
gene function and may be used for treating a variety of
diseases. RNAi can specially inhibit the function of any
chosen target genes and has shown antiviral effect against
hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (12–15). Unlike HCV and HIV, there is
only modest sequence heterogeneity among HBV DNA
strains. Thus, HBV makes extensive use of overlapping
reading frames (ORFs) with the DNA genome, suggesting
the multiple HBV RNAs will make the virus susceptible for
RNA interference (16,17).
HEPATITIS B VIRUS BIOLOGY AND INFECTION
HBV belongs to a family of small enveloped DNA
viruses that predominantly infects the liver. HBV particle
virions are 42 nm in diameter and possess an isometric

nucleocapsid core of 27 nm in diameter, surrounded by an
outer coat of approximately 4 nm thick (Fig. 1). The protein
of the virion coat is known as hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg), which consists of three subspecies, depending on
the hepadnavirus. The three envelope components are called
as S, M, and L (18). S protein is 226 amino acids long and
known as the S domain. The two larger proteins contain S
plus amino-terminal extensions of S created by initiation at
upstream start codons. For HBV, these codons are located at
approximately 165 (M) and 489 (L) nucleotides upstream of
the initiation codon for S. The extra domain of M is known as
pre-S2, while the domain unique to L is called pre-S1. S, L,
and M are all found as components of the 42-nm diameter
infectious viral particles (19). HBsAg is generally produced in
vast excess, and is found in the blood of infected individuals
in the form of filamentous and spherical particles.
HBV has a compact genome with a partially double–
stranded DNA of approximately 3200 bases in length and
contains four open reading frames (ORFs) that encode
precore/core, polymerase, surface and HBVx (HBx) proteins.
The core and polymerase genes are essential for viral DNA
replication. The core gene encodes the viral capsid protein,
known as hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg). Additional
two gene expression products are hepatitis X protein (HBx)
and hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg). HBx is dispensable for
virus replication in transfected cells (20,21) and acts as a
stabilizer for viral RNAs (22). Apart from transactivation of
many promoters, activities linked to HBx include stimulation
of signal transduction (23) and binding to well-known protein
targets such as p53 (24–26), proteasome subunits (27,28), and
UV-damaged DNA binding protein (29). HBeAg is also
dispensable for in vivo infections (30,31). HBeAg is an
important marker of HBV replication and may cause depletion
of Th1 helpers cells, thereby suppressing the ability to mount a
strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to the infected
hepatocytes (32,33).
HBV replication includes entry, uncoating, and delivery
of the viral genome into the cell nucleus. The life cycle of
HBV is characterized by the synthesis of a 3 kb partially
double-stranded, relaxed-circular DNA (rcDNA) genome by
reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenome. The mechanism of RNA-directed DNA synthesis has
been well characterized through genetic and biochemical
studies (34,35).
All hepatitis viral transcripts utilize a common polyadenylation signal located within the core protein-coding region
(Fig. 2). The 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA and three subgenomic
mRNAs regulate the translation of HBV proteins and reverse
transcription of HBV DNA (18). The pregenomic mRNA not
only serves for translation of the core protein, HBeAg and
polymerase-reverse transcriptase, but also represents the
template for reverse transcription. The DNA polymerase
and X gene are essential for reverse-transcription and transcription regulation. Both the life cycle and genome structure
of HBV are susceptible to specific siRNAs.
MECHANISMS OF RNA INTERFERENCE
RNAi is a regulatory mechanism of most eukaryotic cells
that uses dsRNA molecules to direct homology-dependent
control of gene activity (36). RNAi-based gene silencing
occurs post-transcriptionally in the cytoplasm (37) and it is
an ATP-dependent and translation-independent event. The
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) model is showed in
Fig. 3. siRNAs are 9–24 bp dsRNA molecules and have a
characteristic 2 nucleotide 3′-overhang that allows them to be
recognized by the enzymatic machinery of RNAi, leading to
homology dependent degradation of the target mRNA. In
mammalian cells siRNAs are produced from cleavage of long
dsRNA precursors by the RNase III endonuclease Dicer (38).
Dicer works with a small dsRNA-binding protein, R2D2, to
hand off the siRNAs to the RISC, which contains the
“splicing” protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2) that cleaves the target
mRNA molecules between bases 10 and 11 relative to the 5′-
end of the antisense siRNA strand. The core components of
RISC are the Ago family members, and in humans only Ago2
possesses an active catalytic domain for cleavage activity (39).
While siRNAs loaded into RISC are double-stranded, Ago2
cleaves and releases the “passenger” strand leading to an
activated form of RISC with a single stranded “guide” RNA
molecule (40). mRNA molecules with perfectly or nearperfectly complementary to the guide RNA are recognized
and then cleaved by Ago2.
A short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a DNA-based siRNA
production strategy in which siRNAs are produced by intracellular processing of shRNA transcripts (Figs. 3 and 4).
shRNA uses a plasmid or viral vector and utilizes the H1 or
U6 promoter to facilitate shRNA expression. The shRNA
hairpin structure is cleaved by the cellular machinery into
siRNA, which is then bound to the RISC. This complex binds
and then cleaves mRNAs which match the siRNA that is
bound to it. The shRNA is processed in the cytoplasm by the
HBsAg

is of spherical shape with a diameter of 42 nm, and consists of an
outer envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapsid core. The outer
envelope contains embedded proteins known as hepatitis B surface
antigens (HBsAg). The HBV DNA genome is double-stranded and
contains a long and short segment which overlap approximately
240 nt to form an open circle. The longer strand is 3020–3320
nucleotides long, and the shorter is 1700–2800 nucleotides long. The
virus can be divided into four major serotypes (adr, adw, ayr, ayw)
based on antigenic epitopes present on HBsAg, and into eight
genotypes (A-H) according to overall nucleotide sequence variation
of the genome.

OFF-TARGET EFFECT
siRNA duplexes can potentially target multiple genes in
addition to the intended target. This phenomenon is known
as “Off-target activity”, which can principally arise from two
mechanisms: depletion on the mRNA level or the suppression
of translation at protein level. Alternatively, another possible
mechanism for off-target activity arises from the fact that the
physical structure of siRNAs appears to be identical to the
related class of miRNAs. miRNAs seem to have mismatches
between RNA oligo and RNA target inherent in their
structure. A siRNA can potentially interact with the 3′-UTRs
of unintended genes that yield mRNA translation inhibition
rather than mRNA degradation. So, off-target effects of
siRNAs is reminiscent of transcript regulation by miRNA
(41). Therefore, improved understanding of the miRNA
mechanism of action could also allow us to improve the
design of siRNAs and to improve the design of experiments
where siRNAs are used. Recently, 2′-O-methyl (2′-OMe)
modifications to specific positions within a siRNA seed region
reduced both the number of off-target transcripts and the
magnitude of their regulation as well as off-target phenotypes
in functional study, without significantly affecting silencing of
the intended targets (42).
siRNA delivery into mammalian cells often induces
innate interferon (IFN) responses and sequence-independent
suppression of both endogenous and exogenous gene expression into “off-target” effect. The use of siRNA containing
immunostimulatory RNA motif or siRNA with length of
30 bp or more can be complicated due to the induction of the
nonspecific IFN response in mammalian cells through the
RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and interaction with
endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in particular TLR7/8.
This effect may be of greater significance when we use
perfectly matched exogenous RNA for gene silencing (43–45)
or when we select cationic liposomes or polymers for siRNA
delivery (46). TLR7 binding is sequence specific, favoring
GC-rich sequences, and can be avoided by choosing sequences
that are not recognized by this receptor. Moreover, this effect
leads to the production of proflammatory cytokines and
type I infections and induce nuclear KB activation. 2′-Uridine
modifications within the siRNA duplex not only evades
immune activation, but also suppresses TLR signaling triggered by their unmodified counterparts, 2′-OMe modified
siRNAs are recognized with high affinity by TLR7/8, but do
not induce downstream signaling (47). These off-target
activities potentially cause the inhibition of translation and
mRNA degradation of unintended genes, which would be
undesirable in a therapeutic process.
DELIVERY STRATEGIES
To improve the effect of RNAi-based therapy, the
enzymatic stability and cellular uptake of siRNA should be
significantly enhanced, while their immunoactivation should
be decreased. Chemical modification and bioconjugation

with lipids are known to improve the stability and cellular
uptake of siRNA. The overall scheme for improving siRNA
stability, cellular uptake and gene silencing efficiency is
illustrated in Fig. 5.
Chemical Modification
The hydrophilic character and anionic backbone of
siRNAs reduces their uptake by the cells. While siRNA
duplexes are relatively more stable in serum than single
stranded siRNA, they easily undergo degradation in vivo
(48–51). This represents a significant barrier to the therapeutic development of siRNA. Chemical modifications to sugars,
backbones, or bases of siRNAs, have been shown to enhance
their stability, prevent them from triggering an immune
response, control their pharmacokinetic profiles and reduce
nonspecific effects without affecting their biological activity.
Most commonly used chemical modifications of siRNA
include phosphorothiolation (P=S) of the non-bridging oxygen at the 3′-end, 2′-sugar modification (such as 2′-OMe or
2′-F) and locked nucleic acid (LNA). Chemical modifications
of siRNA confer enhanced gene silencing at lower doses and
reduced dosing frequency (52). siRNA molecules consisting
of 2′-OMe and 2′-F have shown to have enhanced stability in
the plasma and increased in vivo potency (48,49). The
modifications also reduce the immunostimulatory effect of
siRNAs (53). Judge et al. reported that immune stimulation
by synthetic siRNA can be completely abrogated by selective
incorporation of 2′-OMe uridine or guanosine nucleosides
into one strand of the siRNA duplex. These non-inflammatory
siRNAs, which contain less than 20% modified nucleotides,
can be readily generated without disrupting their genesilencing activity (54,55). Morrissey et al. (56) selected two
siRNAs, HBV263 and HBV1583 and chemically stabilized for
nuclease resistance using 2′F, 2′-OMe or 2′H residues to
substitute 2′-OH residues. They then analyzed in vitro
potency (Fig. 6). It was found that the placement of one,
two or three ribonucleotides at the 5′ end of the modified
siRNA improved the median inhibitory concentration of the
stabilized siRNAs by approximately fivefold. Jackson et al.
(2007) demonstrated that 2′-OMe modification of position 1
and 2 within the siRNA seed region reduce both the number
of off-target transcripts and the magnitude of their regulation,
without significantly affecting silencing of the intended target
(42). 2′-OMe modification at the 5′-end significantly prolongs
the half-life of a large fraction of the siRNA guide strand

when exposed to human blood serum (49). Furthermore,
siRNA with 2′-OMe modification completely block ribonucletic cleavage 3′ to position 1. It also significantly reduces but
does not completely block cleavage 3′ to position 2.
Bioconjugation
An siRNA can be linked to a carrier molecules or
covalently conjugated to a targeting ligand via a cleavable
spacer to increase its cellular uptake or confer cell-specific
targeting. Since the antisense strand is active, the carrier
molecule is usually attached to the sense strand of an siRNA
duplex without compromising the level of gene silencing.
Conjugates can be placed on either the 5′- or 3′-end of the
sense strand. To date, siRNA has seen conjugated to lipids,
polymers, peptides and aptamers (57–60).
Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is expressed predominantly in
the liver cells, and is an essential protein for assembly and
secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL), which are required for the
transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Soutschek et al.
conjugated cholesterol to the 3′-end of the sense strand of
siRNA targeting ApoB and demonstrated significant increase
in the levels of this conjugate in the liver. Most importantly,
siRNAs efficiently reduced the levels of ApoB mRNA in the
liver by ∼55% and ∼70% in the Jejunun, the two main sites
of AboB expression. Concomitantly, ApoB in plasma protein
dropped by ∼70% and serum cholesterol fell by 35–40% (53).
Lorenz et al. also have conjugated siRNAs to lipids like
lithocholic and lauric acids at the 5′-end of the sense strand
and showed increased cellular uptake of siRNAs in human
liver cells without the use of any transfection reagent (61).
Conjugation of siRNA to apatamer which can bind to
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has shown some
promise for targeted delivery of siRNA to prostate cancer.
McNamara et al. developed aptamer-siRNA chimeric RNAs
capable of cell type –specific binding and delivery of
functional siRNA into cells. The aptamer portion of the
chimeras mediates binding to PSMA, whereas the siRNA
portion targets the expression of survival genes when applied
to cell expressing PSI (57,62).

depends on the cationic lipid structure and liposome composition (63). The cationic lipid which contains protonable polyamines linked to dialkyl or cholesterol anchors in the liposomal
formulation form complexes with DNA or RNA, leading to
their enhanced cellular association. Morrissey et al. (56,64)
incorporated chemically modified siRNA against HBV into a
specialized liposome to form a stable nucleic acid lipid particle
(SNALP) and administered intravenously into mice carrying
replicating HBV. There was significant improvement in efficacy
compared to unformulated siRNA with a longer half-life in
plasma and liver. Mahato et al. (65) reported that cationic lipids
with multivalent head-groups are more effective in gene
transfer compared to their monovalent counterparts.
Hepatocytes can be targeted using galactosylated liposomes (66–68) or asialofetuin grafted vesicles (69). Liposomes that are modified with human serum albumin
predominantly accumulate in liver endothelial cells (70) and
mannosylated liposomes are recognized by Kupffer cells
(71,72). To deliver antisense ODN into hepatocytes for
treating HBV infection, Zhang et al. (73) developed the
liver-targeting cationic liposomes as a gene carrier, which was
co-modified with the ligand of the asialoglycoprotein receptor
(ASGPR), beta-sitosterol-beta-d-glucoside (sito-G) and the
nonionic surfactant, Brij 35. The cationic liposomes/ODN
complexes exhibited high transfection efficiency and strong
antigen inhibitory effect in primary rat hepatocytes and
HepG2.2.15 cells, respectively. The cellular uptake of these
liposomal formulations is mediated by endocytosis and
membrane fusion. The ligand sito-G enhanced ASGPRmediated endocytosis, while the nonionic surfactant Brij 35
facilitated membrane fusion. This co-modification resulted in
efficient transfection, with little cytotoxicity. These results
suggest that the co-modified liver-targeting cationic liposomes
would be effective to ODN delivery to hepatocytes infected
with HBV.
Like cationic lipid, cationic polymer can also form
complexes with siRNA because of electrostatic interaction
between positively charged amine groups of the polycations
and negatively charged phosphate groups of the siRNA. The
interaction between cationic polymer/siRNA complexes and
negatively charged cell membranes can enhance its cellular
uptake and thus increase transfection efficiency (74). Various
cationic polymers have been studied as potential vectors for
gene delivery which include proteins such as histones and
cationized human serum albumin, polypeptides such as polyL-lysine (PLL) and poly-L-ornithine, and polyamines such as
polyethyleneimine (PEI) and starburst polyamidoamine
(pAMAM) dendrimers. pAMAM dendrimers have been
largely applied for delivery of plasmids and ODNs (75,76),
but not yet explored for siRNA delivery. Generally, it is
expected that the advantages observed for ODNs may be
adapted for siRNA. Among the cationic polymers employed
for gene delivery, PEI has been the most widely used polymer
for siRNA delivery. PEIs with various molecular weights,
degrees of branching, and other modifications have been used
for transfecting siRNAs in different cell lines and live animals
(77,78). The high transfection efficiency of PEI can be
attributed to its buffering effect, also known as “proton
sponge effect” due to its secondary and tertiary amines. The
cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency of PEI are directly
proportional to its molecular weight. PEI is often grafted with
polyethylene glycol (PEG) or cholesterol to reduce its
cytotoxicity (79,80).
Antibody-mediated delivery is an effective method of
targeting siRNA to particular cells. This involves fusing the
nucleic acid binding domain to Fab fragment or scFv that
recognizes a membrane receptor, resulting in a fusion protein
that possesses cell recognition and nucleic acid-binding
abilities. This fusion protein can then bind nucleic acids and
deliver them into target cells through receptor-mediated
endocytosis. Wen et al. (81) recently tested five siRNA
duplexes to select a specific siRNA that effectively inhibited
HBV gene expression and replication. These investigators
constructed two fusion proteins, s-tP and sCkappa-tP to
contain a single chain of the human variable fragment, scFv,
against HBsAg, a truncated protamine (tP). To provide
targeted delivery of siRNA, siRNA expressing cassettes
(SEC), and siRNA-producing plasmids, a constant region of
the kappa chain (Ckappa), s-tP and sCkappa-tP were
developed. Fluorescein labeled-siRNA, fluorescein labeledSEC, and plasmid DNA were specifically delivered into
HBsAg-positive cells using the sCkappa-tP fusion protein,
and effectively inhibited HBV gene expression and replication. HBV gene expression was also inhibited by siRNA or
siRNA-producing plasmids in HBV transgenic mice.
Hydrodynamic Injection
The hydrodynamic injection technique is used to efficiently deliver HBV expression plasmids and siRNAs targeting various HBV gene regions, with enhanced HBV gene
silencing (64,82,83). Morrissey et al. (64) assessed the activity
of stabilized siRNAs in vivo after co-delivering an HBV
vector and siRNA via high-volume tail vein injection. More
than a 3 log10 decrease in levels of serum HBV DNA and
HBsAg, as well as liver HBV RNA, were observed in the
siRNA-treated groups compared to the control siRNAtreated and saline groups. Furthermore, the observed decrease in serum HBV DNA was 1.5 log10 more with
stabilized siRNA compared with unmodified siRNA, indicating the value of chemical modification in therapeutic applications of siRNA.
METHODS OF siRNA PRODUCTION
siRNAs can be produced either by chemically synthesis
or by in vitro transcription or in vivo vector expression of
shRNA.
Chemical Synthesis of siRNA
The selection of siRNA for a target gene is a crucial step
for its application, yet empirical process is used for selection
of siRNA because the rules that govern efficient siRNA
silencing are still unknown. Nevertheless, Ambion (Houston,
TX) recommended four guidelines for designing siRNAs: (1)
beginning with the AUG of the target gene transcript, search
downstream for AA dinucleotide sequences, each AA and
the 3′ adjacent 19 nt are potential siRNAs; (2) blast the
potential sequences against the species-specific genome
database to eliminate cross-silencing phenomenon with nontarget genes; (3) select three to four target sequences along
78 Chen, Cheng, and Mahato

the gene for production of siRNAs; and (4) for all siRNA
experiments, negative control siRNAs with the same nucleotide, but a scrambled sequence (84). Ui-Tei et al. (85)
proposed another four practical guidelines for designing
siRNA sequences in mammalian cells: (1) A/U at the 5′-end
of the antisense strand; (2) G/C at the 5′-end of the sense
strand; (3) at least five A/U residues in the 5′ terminal of the
third antisense strand; and (4) the absence of any GC stretch
of >9 nt in length. These guidelines closely related to the
molecular mechanism of RISC assembly.
Web-based software and bioinformatics is the current
method for siRNA design. Naito et al. (86) presented a webbased software, siDirect (http://design.RNAi.jp) (86), to
compute highly effective siRNA sequence with maximum
specificity. The siDirect algorithm incorporated the four
guidelines to favor efficient mammalian RNAi with a high
success rate. In addition, it investigates all the potential crosshybridization to avoid off-target gene silencing effects. Bioinformatics approaches have also been used to help select
optimal siRNAs. Yuan et al. (87) built a web-based tool
(http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bioc/siRNA) that implements several
algorithms to identify siRNAs with high probability of
silencing the target gene. One advantage of the server is that
they keep incorporating rules from new results, which
provides the biologist access to the newest design features.
To design esiRNAs, Henschel et al. (88) developed a webbased tool, DEQOR(http://cluster-1.mpi-cbg.de/Deqor/deqor.
html). The program mimics esiRNAs by fragmenting the
input sequence into small pieces (16–25 nt), whereby the
sequence window is shifted along the input query by 1 nt at
each iteration step of the algorithm. Each simulated siRNA
will be: (1) analyzed using a scoring system based on the stateof-the-art parameters for its ability to induce specific gene
silencing; and (2) analyzed for its ability to cross-silence genes
different from the target by performing BLAST searches
against the transcriptome or genome of the studied organism.
Although algorithms can increase the chances of identifying
active siRNAs, they can sometimes miss the most potent
siRNAs, which can only be identified by experiments testing.
Chemical synthesis is a direct means of generating
siRNAs. Advantages of chemically synthesized siRNA include the precise control of the amount and purity of siRNA,
ease in characterization and modification of siRNA (89), high
transfection efficiency into the cells of interest, and immediate
gene silencing (90,91). The steps of chemical synthesis of
siRNA includes the production of sense and antisene strands,
annealing of the strands, adding stable chemical entities and
2 nt overhangs at 3′ end. Dykxhoorn et al. (90) reported that
siRNA duplex requires a 3′-hydroxyl group and a 5′-
phosphate group for functional activity.
Although siRNA provides a powerful tool for inhibiting
target genes, there are several concerns and limitations in the
practical application of this technology. Milhavet et al. (84)
summarized several parameters that could affect transfection
and gene silencing efficacy: (1) cell culture conditions, cell
density and medium composition; (2) amount and type of
transfection agent; (3) quality and amount of siRNA; and (4)
exposure time of the cells to siRNA. Furthermore, the use of
chemically synthesized siRNA is limited by the fact that
different sequences have significantly different inhibitory
abilities. Holen et al. (92) observed that several siRNAs
synthesized against different sites on the same target mRNA
demonstrated striking different gene silencing efficiency, and
only a few of the siRNAs resulted in a significant gene silencing,
suggesting that accessible siRNA target sites may be rare in
some human mRNAs. Hohjoh et al. (93) reported that different
siRNAs induce different levels of gene silencing.
Several sites of the HBV genome have been targeted to
assess the efficiency of chemically synthesized siRNAs against
HBV (Table I). These include pre C/core, HBsAg and HBx.
The most commonly used strategy is to use chemically
synthesized double-strand siRNAs of 19–24 nt. These siRNA
duplexes are usually transfected into HBV producing
HepG2.2.15 or HuH7 cells. Sequence-specific reduction in
viral RNA and DNA production are often seen. This
accompanies by a drop in the secretion of HBsAg and/or
HBeAg into the culture medium (82,94,95). Hamasaki et al.
(95) demonstrated that siRNAs specific for the 3.5 kb

RNAi for Treating Hepatitis B Viral Infection 79

pregenomic RNA, which did not bind to other viral transcripts reduced the level of 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA and
resulted in reduced levels of secreted HBeAg and
replicative intermediates converted from the 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA. Unsurprisingly, the levels of 2.4/2.1 kb
mRNA and secreted HBsAg was not reduced in cells
transfected with siHBV, since the 2.4/2.1 kb mRNA did
not include the homologous sequence to HBV.
Because all HBV viral RNAs have a common polyadenylation signal at their 3′-ends located within the core
protein-coding region, effective siRNA targeted region that
can decrease the levels of 3.5 kb, 2.4 kb, and 2.1 kb HBV
mRNA. Konishi et al. (94) selected the polyadenylation
signal as one of the siRNA targets based on their previous
successful results using oligoDNA (96). The site offers the
possibility of disrupting several sensitive sites due to overlapping reading frames. The use of siRNA against HBV is
attractive because of its small size mRNA and overlapping
reading frames. It is possible to design siRNAs such that a
single sequence could disrupt several critical mRNAs. The
observed decreases in levels of 3.5-kb, 2.4-kb, and 2.1-kb
HBV mRNA are consistent with this concept (Fig. 2).
RNAi target sequences should be chosen on the basis of
their conservation among the major HBV genotype. The
conserved gene regions of HBV genome are chosen as the
target sites of siRNA sequences. Compared to RNA viruses,
which have a high rate of mutation during their RNA genome
replication, the genomes of DNA viruses are relatively stable,
with a low mutation rate. Thus, resistance to RNAi-mediated
viral gene silencing though mutation of the target sequence has
not been observed in DNA virus infection. However, siRNA
may exert selection pressure on preexisting resistant mutants, as
exemplified by a recent report on HBV (97). Although HBV is
a DNA virus, its DNA replicates through a genomic RNA
intermediate and utilizes a virally encoded reverse transcriptase. Consequently, a significant amount of diversity, similar to
that seen in RNA viruses, occurs in the sequences of HBV
isolates, which can be classified into at least 8 genotypes (A–
H). A mutant C genotype that contains a mutant in the 3′
portion of the targeted region was isolated and was more
resistant to HBV S1 shRNA-mediated RNAi than the wildtype. This mutant can be preferentially selected in the
presence of HBV S1 shRNA in Huh-7 cells co-transfected
with wild type and mutant HBV-C at a ratio of 9:1 at day 5
post-transfection (97). Many studies have found that the
distinct RNAi targeting sequences on HBsAg gene exhibited
different efficacies on inhibition of the viral DNA replication
and gene expression (12,82,98,99). The highest inhibitory
effects induced by different siRNAs targeted on HBcAg and
HBx gene have also been reported (12,98). The particular
advantage of using RNAi-based therapeutic strategy over
conventional drugs is that siRNA mediated inhibition of gene
expression does not require any viral DNA replication.
One of the major challenges to the clinical applications
of RNAi technologies is how to handle escape from inhibition
of viruses that are prone to a high mutation rate and different
RNAi exhibiting different degrees of gene silencing. The
latter may be handled by screening effective siRNA sequences.
Selection of RNAi escape mutants has been reported in vitro
for poliovirus, HIV-1 and HCV. However, resistant viral
sequences were susceptible to silencing by corresponding site
mutant siRNAs or alternative site siRNAs. Several sites of
the HBV genome have been targeted to assess the efficiency
of siRNAs against HBV which include C, S, and X gene
regions of HBV (100,101).
Transfection of a single siRNA often fails to provide
adequate gene silencing. Another potential problem of
chemically synthesized siRNA is variable transfection efficiency. To circumvent these limitations, expression vectors
containing shRNA expression cassettes are developed which
undergo processing by Dicer in mammalian cells. ShRNAs
are generally designed to match for the target mRNA
according to corresponding siRNA sequences to induce gene
silencing. These shRNAs can be produced from plasmid or
viral expression vectors.
Although the siRNAs sequences used by different
researchers are different, a series of experiments showed
significant reduction in HBV transcripts and proteins in cell
culture, as well as in the viral replicative forms, induced by
siRNA-producing vectors (55,98,102–105).
Endogenous Expression of Anti-HBV shRNA
Plasmid and viral vectors have been developed to
express shRNA that are converted into siRNA in cells.
Briefly, in the plasmid-based expression vector, the shRNA
cassette including sense and antisense of siRNA sequence is
transcripted as a single RNA with a short loop of 4–10 base
sequence in the middle (Fig. 3). The transcript forms a
hairpin structure that can be digested into functional siRNA
by Dicer upon exporting into cytoplasm. Two different
promoters, namely polymerase III (pol III) U6 and H1
promoters are used predominantly (106–108). It was reported
that the vector containing Pol III promoter for expressing
shRNA does not induce interferon responses like pol II.
One emerging concern is that RNAi mono-therapies
might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape
silencing by mutation and/or RNAi suppression. Thus,
sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim at
averting viral resistance by combining RNAi effectors with
each other or with further gene expression inhibitors. Several
reports have already validated this new concept of combinatorial RNAi (coRNAi) and illustrate its versatility by coexpression of shRNA against single or multiple, viral or
cellular targets. Moreover, vectors have been engineered to
blend RNAi-mediated gene inhibition with conventional gene
replacement strategies.
Plasmid Vector
Many studies have shown that siRNAs based on
chemical synthesis could knock down the expression of
HBV gene (82,94,109). However, most of the studies showed
transient effects using the chemically synthesized siRNA for
an infected cell line or co-transfecting a vector bearing HBV
genome with siRNA to a healthy cell line. The vector-based
shRNA, targeted against specific sequences in the HBV
genome has been shown to inhibit the expression and
replication of the HBV in vitro and in vivo.
Table II summarizes recent studies using shRNAs to
target the transcripts from all four major HBV ORFs
(12,38,97–99,101,102,104,105,110,111). While these studies
80 Chen, Cheng, and Mahato

demonstrated the feasibility of achieving efficient viral gene
silencing, there was no clear pattern due to the differences in
the experimental settings. Most noteworthy finding were by
McCaffrey et al. (12) who demonstrated shRNAs can block
replication of HBV in cell culture and in immunocompetent
and immunodeficient mice transfected with plasmid encoding
shRNA against HBV. These authors injected a large volume
of plasmids encoding the HBV genome together with HBVspecific shRNAs into mouse liver. Among the organs transfected with the exogenous HBV DNA (liver, spleen, kidney
and pancreas), the liver showed the highest levels of gene
expression with approximately 40% of hepatocytes expressing the transgenes. The authors show that the HBV-specific
shRNAs significantly reduced viral mRNAs and protein
expression, thus inhibiting virus replication in hepatocytes of
HB-infected mice.
Although shRNA expressed from the plasmid driven by
polymerase III using the constitutive promoter, such as U6
and H1, were able to knock down HBV expression, most of
the observations were transient. In an attempt to improve the
silencing effect, Ren et al. (104) used a modified cytomegalomavirus (CMV) promoter to drive expression with Polymerase II (Pol II), which is considered to be a stronger
promoter than the other common RNA Pol II promoters.
These authors constructed seven vectors expressing specific
shRNA driven by RNA polymerase II promoter and transfected into Hep2.2.15 cells. In the cells that can stably express
functional siRNA, HBsAg and HBeAg secretion into culture
media was inhibited by 86% and 91%, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis indicated similar
results. HBV DNA was markedly restrained by 3.28-fold. RTPCR analysis showed that viral mRNAs were effectively
degraded, thus eliminating the messengers for protein expression as well as templates for reverse transcription.
Due to their short half-life and low in vivo transfection
efficiency, plasmid-based shRNAs are unlikely to be effective
in treating chronic HBV infection, because virtually all
hepatocytes in the patients are infected. In this regard, a

RNAi for Treating Hepatitis B Viral Infection 81

viral vector, which can achieve efficient and uniform transduction of all liver cells, should provide an effective gene
therapy for chronic HBV infection.
Viral Vector
While most rapidly dividing cell lines are easily transfected using shRNA expression plasmids, these vectors are
not easily transfected into primary cells, stem cells, and
nondividing cells. In the absence of cell division, the siRNA
expression plasmids cannot be introduced into the nucleus,
where the DNA is transcribed. To overcome this limitation,
different viral vectors encoding shRNA including lentiviral,
adenoviral (Adv), and adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors
are being developed (112–115).
Uprichard et al. (99) and Carmona et al. (117) have
recently demonstrated that shRNAs delivered by recombinant Adv vector could suppress HBV replication and gene
expression in transgenic mice, an animal model more
clinically relevant to chronic HBV in terms of containing
heavily ongoing HBV replication in all hepatocytes.
AAV vectors are nonpathogenic and less immunogenic
compared with other viral vectors. The ability of AAV vectors
to infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, and to direct
long-term gene expression in these tissues made it an ideal
vehicle for gene therapy. Chen et al. (118) used a doublestranded adenoassociated virus 8-pseudotyped vector
(dsAAV2/8) to deliver shRNA. HBV transgenic mice were
used as an animal model to evaluate the inhibition effects of
the RNAi-based gene therapy. A single administration of
dsAAV2/8 vector, carrying HBV-specific shRNA, effectively
suppressed the steady level of HBV protein, mRNA and
replicate of DNA in the liver of HBV transgenic mice,
leading to 2–3 log10 decrease in HBV concentration in the
circulation. The therapeutic effect of shRNA was sequencedependent and did not involve activation of interferon. These
results underscore the potential of developing RNAi-based
therapy by dsAAV2/8 vector to treat HBV chronic infection.
Sun et al. (119) selected two effective siRNAs targeting S
and X gene region of HBV genome and cloned them into a
human foamy virus (HFV)-based vector to generate a dual
siRNA expression vector HFVU6-siSX. The results showed
that the siRNA vector effectively inhibited multiple HBV
gene expression and viral DNA replication.
Combination Strategy of RNAi
The ongoing solution to thwart viral mutation evolution
and circumvent the resistance of anti-viral therapy is to
combine RNAi triggers or with other ways of inhibiting gene
expression. These novel approaches hold significant promise
over conventional mono-therapy.
Cocktail of siRNAs
Variability of gene silencing efficiency of different siRNA
sequences can be attributed to different affinity between
cellular siRNA binding protein and the secondary and/or
tertiary structures of target mRNA participating in the
induction of RNAi activities (120). Using the cocktail of
siRNAs could be solved the problem because the combination of siRNAs will cleave multiple sites in the mRNA target
and make it difficult for the target to be repaired. For
example, Chen et al. (121) demonstrated combination of
siRNAs targeting different HBV sites was highly effective in
the inhibition of HBV replication and antigen expression
compared with the use of any individual siRNA (121).
Therefore, it is important to use a cocktail treatment with
the capability of inhibiting multiple viral antigen expression
and DNA replication (94).
Production of Multiple siRNAs
The use of a vector which can generate multiple siRNAs
or shRNAs would have the advantage of limiting escape and
targeting a range of sequences found in different viral
genotypes or quasispecies. It is important to use a combination of various highly effective shRNAs against S, C, P and X
genes to achieve complete inhibition of HBV replication and
gene expression. To toward this goal, some investigations to
determine the best combination of the effective shRNAs are
warranted.
Weinberg et al. (122) assessed the efficacy of long hairpin
RNAs (lhRNAs) that target the conserved HBx open reading
frame of HBV. As substrates for Dicer, lhRNAs have the
potential to generate multiple siRNAs to enable simultaneous
targeting of different sites (Fig. 7). These authors constructed
two U6 Pol III vectors that encode anti-HBV lhRNAs with a
62 base pair stem sequence containing multiple G:U pairings.
Assessment in transfected cultured cells and also in vivo using
the hydrodynamic injection model in mice showed that one of
the lhRNA vectors (lhRNA 1) decrease viral replication by
70–90% with no evidence of interferon response induction.
The highest silencing efficacy was observed for targets that
are complementary to sequences located at the base of the
hairpin stem and this correlated with a higher concentration
of siRNAs derived from this region of the lhRNA.
Combination of siRNA and Other Inhibitory Factors
To combine shRNA with other inhibitors of gene
expression is another promising way to overcome viral gene
mutation and improve the silencing effect. Jarczak et al. (123)
investigated a dual strategy of ribozyme and siRNA simultaneously targeting distinct highly conserved HCV 5′- and 3′-
UTR RNA sequences. Huh-mono cells were co-transfected
with U6 promoter-driven siRNAs and tRNAVal-driven
hairpin ribozymes with attached CTE (tRz-CTE). tRz induced 30% decrease in NS5B protein levels. siRNAs reduced
HCV NS5B expression by approximately 50%. Surprisingly,
when U6 promoter-driven siRNAs were combined with
tRNAVal-driven hairpin ribozyme tRz-CTE, a consistent
inhibitory effect of the ribozyme in the range of 25% was
added to the inhibitory effect of each siRNA. This suggests
that a dual strategy of ribozymes and siRNAs might become a
powerful molecular tool to specifically silence HCV RNA
replication.
HBV replicates through a pregenomic RNA (pgRNA)
intermediate, which provides a therapeutic opportunity for a
novel antiviral gene therapy based on combination of
ribozyme RNA cleavage and siRNA.
82 Chen, Cheng, and Mahato

Combination of siRNA and Nucleoside Analogues
Nucleoside analogues like lamivudine therapy have been
shown to a rapid decrease in HBV DNA and improvements
in transaminase levels and liver histology and enhanced rate
of loss of HBeAg. In patients who do not lose HBeAg,
stopping therapy after 3 to 12 months is usually followed up
by a return of HBV DNA to pretreatment values and relapse
of disease. A major limitation of chronic lamivudine therapy,
however, is the development of viral resistance, marked
virologically by rises in HBV-DNA levels despite continuation of this therapy. Resistance to lamivudine typically
develops after 6 months of treatment and is associated with
mutations in the highly conserved catalytic region of the HBV
polymerase gene (124). Combination of siRNA and lamivudine
may exhibit greater inhibitory effect on HBV replication.
Li et al. (116) systemically measured the anti-HBV effect of
siRNA combined with lamivudine on HepG2.2.15 cells at
HBeAg, HBsAg, DNA and mRNA levels. The combination
of siRNA and lamivudine exerted a pronounced inhibition of
HBV replication.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
HBV viral infection remains a challenge for modern
medicine. RNAi can inhibit HBV gene expression and replication, and it might have the potential to revolutionize the
treatment of HBV. The level of HBV gene silencing greatly
depends on siRNA sequences and dose. Virus mRNA may form
complicated space structure which obstruct siRNA to come into
play a role. A single nuclear mutant on the target gene may
obstruct gene silencing. HBV DNA replicates through premRNA intermediate and reverse transcriptase, HBV genome is
prone to mute, and mutation strains escape silencing by RNAi.

RNAi for Treating Hepatitis B Viral Infection 83

Thus, strategies should be developed that can effectively avert
viral mutation by combining siRNAs which can simultaneously
target multiple sites of HBV gene.
Viral gene-specific siRNAs are promising antiviral inhibitors and have been examined in a broad range of medically
important viruses. However, many RNA viruses escape RNAimediated suppression by counteracting the RNAi machinery
through mutation of the targeted region, by encoding viral
suppressors, or both. DNA viruses also counteract the RNAi
machinery, preferentially using viral suppressors. Cellular
factors may also contribute to RNAi resistance. Systemic
delivery of synthetic siRNA and shRNA expression vectors to
specific targets is still a problem, due to their poor stability,
widespread distribution and inefficient gene silencing.
