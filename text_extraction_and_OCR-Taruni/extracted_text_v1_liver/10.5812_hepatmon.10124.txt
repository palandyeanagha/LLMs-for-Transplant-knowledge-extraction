ABSTRACT
Early-onset diabetes, liver dysfunction, growth retardation, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and tendency to skeletal fractures due to osteopenia 
are characteristics of Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS). Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase (EIF2AK3) is the only known gene, 
which is responsible for this rare autosomal recessive disorder. Here, we report two siblings a girl and a boy with diabetes mellitus (DM) who 
presented in one and two months of age respectively. Recurrent self-limiting hepatitis developed later, and severe hepatic failure resulted in 
death of the first child. The second child visited was a 7.75 year old boy who had spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and subclinical hypothyroidism 
besides DM and recurrent hepatitis. We suggested WRS for this patient, and it was confirmed by identification of a novel homozygous missense 
mutation (Q166R) in exon 3 of the EIF2AK3 gene. The aim of this report is to remind the possibility of WRS in isolated neonatal diabetes; while, 
the other clinical manifestations of this syndrome including its major symptom of recurrent hepatitis may appear later.

1. Introduction
Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS) (OMIM 226980) is 
a rare disorder but has been reported as the most common known genetic cause of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) which occurs in consanguineous 
pedigrees (1, 2). Other common genetic causes of PNDM 
are proposed as a mutation in KCNJ11 (NM_000525), 
ABCC8 (NM_000352.2), and INS (NM_000207). WRS, as a 
monogenic (single gene) autosomal recessive disorder 
is caused by mutations in EIF2AK3 gene. WRS is characterized by infancy permanent diabetes, hepatic and renal 
dysfunction which are mostly recurrent, self-limiting,

and episodic. It is accompanied by multiple epiphyseal 
or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, osteoporosis, growth 
retardation, and congenital heart anomaly (2). Liver 
dysfunction sometimes leads to hepatic failure, which 
is mostly accompanied by acute multiorgan failure (encephalopathy, renal, and bone marrow failure) and may 
result in the patient’s death. However, hepatic and renal functions returned to normal in survived patients. 
Unfortunately, Genetic counseling and analysis for this 
condition is usually delayed until WRS is fully presented. 
EIF2AK3 is a type I transmembrane protein which functions as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor for 
protein synthesis regulation via phosphorylating the 
α-subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) in the 
ER (3, 4). Therefore, diabetes may be considered as an ER 
stress disease (5).
2. Case Presentation
This study was performed in the Molecular Genetics 
Laboratory of Ali-Asghar Children's Hospital of Iran University of Medical Sciences, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An informed consent was obtained 
from the parents on behalf of the child. Clinical information was obtained using a standardized questionnaire 
from outpatient and hospital records. Parents were first 
cousin. Since the first child was died, a single proband 
was tested for EIF2AK3 mutation with a suspected diagnosis of Wolcott-Rallison Syndrome based on early-onset 
diabetes (within the first 15 months of age), unexplained 
liver dysfunction, and skeletal dysplasia. The Figures of 
changes in liver enzymes were drawn by IBM SPSS 19.
2.1. EIF2AK3 Gene Analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes using standard method. The coding exons and the 
intron-exon boundaries of the EIF2AK3 gene were amplified via PCR; primers and conditions were available upon 
request. Single-strand sequencing was performed utilizing gene specific primers and standard methods on an 
ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Macrogen, South Korea). 
Sequences of all amplicons were compared with the published template (accession no. AF110146.1) using Mutation 
Surveyor (version 3.20; SoftGenetics, State College, PA). 
Any changes in the sequence were checked against published polymorphisms and mutations and for conservation across species.
2.2. Patients
2.2.1. Patient 1
The first patient was a girl, the first child of healthy parents with consanguineous marriage. She had diabetes 
since 40 days of age and atrial septal defect (ASD) which 
improved spontaneously. She had frequent hospital admissions due to vomiting, abdominal pain and distention, acholic stool and generalized edema. Hepatomegaly 
and ascites were reported in her medical records. Laboratory tests showed abnormal liver function. The liver enzymes in different ages are illustrated in Table 1 and Figure 
1. Other tests were total bilirubin, 3 mg/dL (normal range, 
0 - 1.2); direct bilirubin, 1.9 mg/dL (0 - 0.3); Alkaline Phosphatase, 1720 IU/L (180 - 1200); viral hepatitis markers had 
negative results.

Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, lipid profile, and protein electrophoresis had normal findings. Anti-insulin autoantibody 
anti-islet cell antibody had negative results, while antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (anti GAD) was 19.6 IU/mL 
(positive, > 12). Recurrent episodes of hepatitis had usually occurred concomitant with viral upper respiratory 
infections. Abnormal walking had begun when she was 
3 years old, and the patient eventually died with hepatic 
failure at 5 years of age. 
2.2.2. Patient 2
The second patient was the brother of the first child 
who was visited by us at 4.4 years of age (Figure 2). He was 
born full term by caesarean section with a birth weight of 
2.4 Kg (< 5th percentile) which was considered small for 
gestational age. Neonatal diabetes had been diagnosed 
at 2 months of age when he presented with poor feeding and dehydration. Treatment with regular and NPH 
insulin was started for him twice daily upon diagnosis. 
He had the history of hospital admission at 11 months of 
age due to vomiting and abdominal distention accompanied by generalized edema. Laboratory tests showed abnormal liver function with highly elevated liver enzymes, 
anemia with neutropenia, and lymphocytosis at that age 
(Table 2). Fluctuations in liver enzymes are seen in different ages (Table 1, Figure 3).
Figure 2. Photograph of the Patient 2 Demonstrating Posture
The report of abdominal ultrasonography confirmed 
hepatomegaly, mild pericholecystic edema, normal 
spleen, and enlarged hyper echoic kidneys but no bright 
liver. Doppler sonography of hepatic vessels and portal 
system had normal findings. The clinical signs were improved spontaneously; AST and ALT returned to normal 
level but recurred after viral upper respiratory infections. 
He has been under treatment with levothyroxine sodium 
due to subclinical hypothyroidism (T4: 7.9 µg/dl, TSH: 7.35 
µIU/L), since one year ago.

Serum cortisol at 8 AM was 27.6 µg/dL. Other laboratory 
tests like blood gas, lipid profile, immunoglobulin A had 
normal results, and endomysial IgA and antitissue transglutaminase had negative findings. Alpha 1 antitrypsin 
was 2.94 g/L (0.7 – 1.7). He had difficulty in walking since 
three years of age. Bone survey reported small and irregular epiphysis compatible with multiple epiphyseal 
dysplasias (Figure 4). We proposed Wolcott-Rallison syndrome as the most possible diagnosis for this patient 

Behnam B et al. Recurrent Self-limiting Hepatitis

with respect to clinical manifestations, paraclinical findings, and family history, which led us to perform genetic 
study to confirm the diagnosis. Sequencing analysis 
showed that the patient is homozygous for a novel missense mutation, Q166R (c.604A > G; p.Glu166R), in exon 3 
of the EIF2AK3 gene (Figure 5). Her mother was heterozygous carrier for this mutation.
3. Conclusions
In this study, clinical diagnosis of Wolcott-Rallison Syndrome (WRS) was confirmed by the identification of a 
novel homozygous missense mutation (Q166R) in exon 3 
of the EIF2AK3 gene. WRS has been reported as the most 
common known genetic cause of permanent neonatal 
diabetes mellitus (PNDM) in consanguineous pedigrees 
(1). Wolcott-Rallison syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease, first reported in 1972 by Wolcott and Rallison

Figure 5. Electrophoregrams Illustrates
A) Normal, B) Abnormal sequences; The arrow shows the site of mutation in the patient
who described three siblings with infantile onset diabetes mellitus and multiple epiphyseal dysplasias (2). Liver 
dysfunction, renal insufficiency, organomegaly, joint 
stiffness, hypoplastic pancreas, cardiac and neurodevelopmental defects, and central hypothyroidism were 
added to the list of problems in later reports (6-10). Renal 
insufficiency was not seen in our two patients. The gene 
responsible for this disorder was determined in year 
2000 based on genetic studies of two consanguineous 
families as EIF2AK3 (or PEK) which encodes translation of 
the pancreatic eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinase (11). Senee et al studied twelve families with 18 cases 
of WRS in 2004, while 17 patients of 18 carried EIF2AK3
mutations resulting in a truncated or missense version 
of the protein (12). In a study EIF2AK3 was sequenced in 
34 probands with infancy-onset diabetes with clinical 
phenotype suggestive of WRS and homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutation of EIF2AK3 were found 
in 25 probands (1). Although the mutation which we have 
found in this study (Q166R) is a missense mutation, and 
does not result in the protein truncation or frame shift, it 
may have a great impact on the protein function leading 
to WRS. This might be probably due to making an amino 
acid change in N-terminus of the protein compared to 
some other mutations reported in much downstream 
and C-terminal part of the protein. For instance, there are 
some recent reports of nonsense mutations (e.g. R491X, 
C532X, c.1408_1409insT, Gln398Stop, p.Pro285AlafsX3) in 
exons 5, 7, 8, and 9 of the EIF2AK3 gene leading to protein 
truncation, and therefore WRS (13-16). Although it is not 
reported in Eif2ak3 knockout mice, phenotypic features 
including severity and unexplained hypoglycaemic episodes are suggestive of hepatic impairment and renal 
failure (17). It has been shown that EIF2AK3 gene and its 

Recurrent Self-limiting Hepatitis Behnam B et al.

product are developmentally required in formation and 
function of the insulin-secreting β-cells during fetal life 
as well as early neonatal period (3). Recently, a complex 
bi-directional link between the diabetes and liver has 
been highlighted, in particular addressing nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the roles of endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) and lipotoxicity in its etiopathogenesis 
(18). Moreover, the association of diabetes with NAFLD 
as an inter-related pathogenic mechanism has been recently shown (19). It is shown that steatohepatitis may be 
induced by ER stress, and some genes including osteocalcin and PNPLA3/adiponutrin are proposed to have major 
role in this regard. Studies have shown that ER stress is 
reversed by Osteocalcin through nuclear factor-kappaB 
signaling, so impaired insulin sensitivity resulted from 
diet-Induced obesity improves (20, 21). In general, ER 
stress as a recently studied mechanism of NAFLD is interesting while intervention strategies targeting ER dysfunction may provide hope for future therapy and prevention in hepatic dysfunction state as well as diabetes. 
In our patients hepatic dysfunction was deteriorated by 
upper respiratory infections which may cause ER stress. 
Although mitochondrial beta-oxidation defects may 
cause liver failure, but these disorders are accompanied 
by clinical and laboratory manifestations that were not 
found in our patients, like hypoglycemia, high creatinine 
phosphokinase, high lactate, myopathy and some others. 
Any infant with diabetes mellitus should be followed for 
the signs and symptoms of WRS while all findings of this 
syndrome might be obscured at the time of diagnosis of 
isolated neonatal diabetes. As the most common cause of 
PNDM, any neonatal case of diabetes mellitus, in particular among consanguineous parents is a real candidate for 
molecular analysis of EIF2AK3 gene. On the other hand, 
episodes of hepatic failure are the most life threatening 
complication of this rare syndrome (4). Therefore, early 
correct recognition and diagnosis is recommended to 
ensure rapid intervention to prevent hepatic complications.
