Abstract
Background Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare,
complex disease associated with significant morbidity and
mortality. Delays in diagnosis are common and may have
detrimental consequences on patients’ prognosis. Too little
is known regarding the patient journey to diagnosis.
Objective The objective of this study was to describe the
patient-reported journey to a correct diagnosis for AL
amyloidosis.
Methods Using a mixed-methods approach, data were
collected from clinician (n = 4) and patient (n = 10)
interviews and a survey of community-based patients with
AL amyloidosis (n = 341). Data were used to document
the patient experience between the onset of symptoms and
the receipt of a diagnosis.
Results Delays in diagnosis were common. Qualitative and
quantitative data indicated that initial symptoms were
varied and similar to other more prevalent diseases. Two
themes regarding the journey to diagnosis emerged: (1)
barriers to an early diagnosis; and (2) the emotional toll of
the journey. Time to diagnosis was heavily influenced by
how patients interpreted their initial symptoms, whether
they sought early medical help, and challenges associated
with making differential diagnoses. Survey results indicate
that patients with primary cardiac involvement were more
likely to receive a delayed diagnosis than those with primary kidney involvement. Patients described mixed emotions associated with the eventual diagnosis of AL
amyloidosis.
Conclusions These data support a need for better early
identification and support for patients seeking a diagnosis.
Increasing clinician awareness may reduce the time to
diagnosis. Additional research is needed to identify optimal
diagnostic testing to reduce delays in treatment initiation
and subsequent severe impacts on health.
Key Points for Decision Makers
Patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis often
experience a complex, lengthy, and ambiguous
journey to diagnosis, which can affect their
emotional well-being.
Older patients may delay seeking medical help
because they attribute early, common symptoms,
such as fatigue or changes in appetite, to the aging
process or to other chronic, more common
conditions.
Clinicians face diagnostic challenges due to lack of
awareness of AL amyloidosis, the non-specific
symptoms of the disease, and the heterogeneity of
the condition.

1 Introduction
Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare, heterogeneous
condition that affects approximately 8–12 new individuals
per million person-years [1, 2]. It is a complex and often
fatal disease caused by misfolded protein deposits composed of monoclonal immunoglobulin light-chain fibrils in
tissues and organs [3]. Amyloid deposits and circulating
free light chains interfere with the structure and function of
tissues and can lead to permanent organ damage and death
[4, 5]. The primary risk factor associated with AL amyloidosis is increased age. The median age at diagnosis is
64 years [6].
Although the deposits can be localized to one specific
tissue or organ, it is typically a multi-system disease. The
locations of amyloid deposits can vary, thus contributing to
the heterogeneity of the disease experience in terms of
signs, symptoms, and health complications [7]. Heart and
kidney involvement, the most commonly affected organs,
can lead to renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and pericardial
and pleural effusions [4]. Damage to multiple organs and
cardiac impairment are most predictive of decreased survival rates and poor disease outcomes, with the most
common cause of death being a cardiac complication [4].
Prognosis for AL amyloidosis is associated with early
diagnosis, treatment, and the extent of organ involvement.
Current treatments, including chemotherapy regimens,
autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT), and
immunomodulatory drugs, have been shown to improve
prognosis and extend life expectancy [8]; however, no
treatment has been specifically approved by USA or
European regulatory agencies for the treatment of AL
amyloidosis. Although current treatments aim to reduce the
production of clonal plasma cells and to prevent further
misfolded light chains and amyloid accumulation and
deposition, there are currently no approved treatments to
target or impact the existing amyloid that causes organ
dysfunction. With current treatment strategies, successful
treatment outcomes depend on early diagnosis and the
extent of organ damage prior to treatment initiation [9]. In
most cases, organ damage is irreversible; therefore, rapid
treatment initiation is necessary to receive the optimal
treatment benefit.
Despite previous reports of diagnostic delays and their
detrimental impact on patient prognoses, there are limited
data to describe patients’ journey to a diagnosis [10]. It is
plausible that delays in diagnosis may be multi-faceted and
heavily influenced by the average age of the patient, the
complexity of the disease, and the rareness of the condition. The onset of disease often occurs at an age when
individuals are at an increasing risk for other more common, chronic conditions. The complexity of the disease and
the non-disease-specific symptoms may reduce the likelihood of a prompt diagnosis. Finally, first-line clinicians
may not be familiar with such a rare condition and may not
initially consider it when making decisions related to differential diagnoses.
An in-depth understanding of the diagnostic process
from the perspective of both clinicians and patients may
identify modifiable barriers to diagnosis and treatment
initiation. The purpose of this study is to describe the
journey to an AL amyloidosis diagnosis using data from
qualitative and quantitative research and to raise awareness
of the difficulties that patients encounter in order to obtain
a correct and timely diagnosis of their disease.
2 Methods
This study was based on a mixed-methods triangulation
approach—a method in which interpretations are made
equally from qualitative and quantitative data sources [11].
Qualitative interviews were conducted with clinicians and
patients to assess patients’ experience with the disease and
to inform the development of a quantitative survey on the
same topics. Both data collection efforts that involved
patients were reviewed and approved by the New England
Institutional Review Board (qualitative patient interviews:
NEIRB #15-140; quantitative survey: NEIRB #15-355).
2.1 Qualitative Interviews
2.1.1 Recruitment and Procedures
Study investigators sought to recruit three to five clinicians
from several key specialties and to yield an even distribution of clinicians by gender and representation from
different geographic regions. Clinicians were eligible for
the study if they had (1) at least 5 years’ experience in
post-residency clinical practice and (2) expertise in treating
patients with AL amyloidosis. Potential clinician respondents were identified and sent introductory emails by the
study sponsor to inform them of the study opportunity.
Semi-structured interviews with clinicians were conducted
by telephone in March 2015. Data for this paper were
drawn from portions of the interview that focused on
(a) clinician experiences related to pathways to diagnosis
and (b) initial signs and symptoms of the disease.
For patient interviews, investigators sought to recruit a
sample of ten patients who varied in terms of gender,
educational attainment, age, geography, duration of disease, types of organ involvement, and experiences with
treatment success. Patients were eligible to participate if
they (1) were at least 18 years of age; (2) had a self-reported diagnosis (as made by a doctor) of AL amyloidosis;
208 K. L. McCausland et al.

and (3) were willing and able to participate in the study and
comply with all study requirements, including completing a
written informed consent form (ICF). Patients were
excluded from the study if they were unable to answer
questions by phone as required to participate in the study.
The Amyloidosis Support Group, a patient advocacy group,
sent an email to a random selection of 50 active group
members. The email included an introduction to the study,
a patient screener, the ICF, and instructions for returning
the completed screener and ICF. The semi-structured
interviews, conducted between April and May 2015, were
designed to gather information related to patients’ journey
to diagnosis, specific initial symptoms, and the impact of
AL amyloidosis on their functioning or well-being.
2.1.2 Data Coding and Analysis
All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, coded, and
analyzed using NVivo Software (QSR International Pty
Ltd., Melbourne, VIC, Australia, Version 10, 2012) and a
grounded theory approach [12]; this approach allows
themes to emerge from the data rather than imposing a
priori hypotheses to be tested. Physician interviews were
coded and analyzed by one researcher, whereas patient
interviews were dual coded and analyzed by four
researchers. Review meetings were held to ensure agreement between coders. An iterative process for coding was
developed to demonstrate saturation, the point at which no
new relevant information emerges and no additional
interviews are necessary. First, a preliminary set of firstlevel codes was developed by reviewing all ten interviews.
Next, the transcripts were divided into four groups. The
first group of interviews was recoded for second-level
codes. If new second-level codes emerged from the second
batch of interviews, the first group of interviews was rereviewed using the revised list of new codes. This process
was continued with the third and fourth groups. Saturation
was confirmed once the last interview was reviewed and no
new codes emerged.
2.2 Quantitative Survey
A longitudinal, non-intervention study of communitybased patients with AL amyloidosis was conducted to
examine the experience of patients with AL amyloidosis
and the impact of the disease on their health-related
quality of life (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02574676). Investigators partnered with two patient
advocacy groups (the Amyloidosis Support Groups and
the Amyloidosis Foundation) to post recruitment
announcements on websites and social media pages, as
well as in membership emails. Individuals were deemed
eligible for the study if they (1) were at least 18 years of
age; (2) reported a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis made by
a physician; and (3) were able and willing to complete
four online surveys written in English during a 12-month
follow-up period. Data for the cross-sectional analyses
reported here were drawn from the initial survey using a
subset of survey items pertaining to basic demographics,
disease characteristics, initial symptoms, and the patients’
journey to a diagnosis.
Descriptive statistics were calculated using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Chi square
tests were used to conduct bivariate analyses. Logistic
binomial models were used to estimate the relative risk of
receiving a delayed diagnosis, defined as a diagnosis that
occurred at least 6 months after the onset of initial
symptoms.
3 Results
3.1 Study Participants
Demographic characteristics of the clinician (n = 4: three
hematologists and one nephrologist) and the demographic
and disease characteristics of the patient interviewees
(n = 10) and survey respondents (n = 341) are described
in Table 1. Both patient samples were diverse in terms of
geographic representation. For example, patient interviewees and survey respondents came from all regions of the
USA with respondents residing in 40 states.
3.2 Journey to Diagnosis
Delays in obtaining a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis were
commonly reported by both clinicians and patients.
According to clinicians, the timeframe between symptom
onset and the receipt of a diagnosis was 10 months (range
1 month to 2 years). Patient interviewees also reported
delays in time to diagnosis that varied broadly (average
3 years; range 3 months to 4 years). This was further
corroborated by the survey data where over 70% of patients
reported that they received a diagnosis at least 6 months
following the onset of symptoms (Table 2).
There was wide variation in how and when patients
received their AL amyloidosis diagnosis. For some, the
path to a diagnosis was straightforward; whereas, for others, the experience involved misdiagnoses and many consultations with various specialists. For example, one patient
interviewee was diagnosed within 3 months of receiving an
abnormal urine test during a routine physical examination.
In contrast, another patient’s journey took more than
4 years from the time he/she first sought help from a doctor
for a bothersome symptom to when he/she ultimately
received a confirmed diagnosis.

3.2.1 Barriers to an Early Diagnosis
Patients and clinicians reported cumulative factors that
ultimately led to delays in diagnosing AL amyloidosis.
Patients’ interpretation of the initial signs and symptoms of
the disease influenced whether they sought early medical
help. Once patients began to seek a diagnosis, delays also
occurred within the healthcare system. Clinicians were not
often familiar with the condition and were challenged by
the complexity and rarity of the disease. This impacted
their ability to make a differential diagnosis. It is important
to note that given the variability of the disease, there was
no ‘‘typical’’ case of AL amyloidosis, and the variability of
the disease itself contributed to delays in reaching a
diagnosis.
3.2.1.1 Interpretation of Signs and Symptoms by Patients
Seeking Medical Help Based on spontaneous reports and
targeted probing questions, patient interviewees reported a
total of 32 distinct symptoms, regardless of type of organ

involvement. The symptoms most commonly reported
during the interviews were used to generate close-ended
questions on the quantitative survey. As shown in Fig. 1,
the most prevalent symptoms were consistent across both
data sources. Fatigue, the most commonly reported symptom, was reported by 80% of all patient interviewees and
82% of all survey respondents. Overall, many of the
reported symptoms were non-specific and overlapped with
the symptomology of other more prevalent chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer.
These non-specific, early symptoms did not always raise
immediate concern for patients, and may have contributed
to delays in seeking medical attention. It was common for
older patients to associate initial symptoms with the aging
process or to attribute them to other existing health conditions. For some patients, the early symptoms were minor
and only seemed relevant after they had received the
diagnosis. Three of the ten patient interviewees did not
consider they were seriously ill until they received an
abnormal result on a routine urinalysis despite noting
previous symptoms as illustrated below:
‘‘I’ve always had problems with statins, so I’ve
always had joint and muscle pain, because statins
have always bothered me. So, I didn’t think much
about it when my hands started tingling and I had
neck pain.’’ (Patient 003)
‘‘It was things like being a little more tired, and I was
suddenly, and I don’t know how this fits in, but I had
been a vegetarian or semi-vegetarian for quite some
time, and all of a sudden I would have these horrible
cravings for meat, and I thought it had something to
do with iron, being of a certain age or whatever.’’
(Patient 010)
‘‘As part of that whole screening process [screening
for eligibility for a stem cell transplant] questions
were asked did you have any experience with this or
that or the other thing. Then it became evident to me I
was seeing some minor symptoms. Nothing I would
have said caused me to go to see a doctor.’’ (Patient
002)
For some patients, the initial symptoms were more
severe and the negative impact on daily functioning was
readily apparent. This may be particularly true for younger
patients whose initial symptoms may not have fit the
expectancies of their current health status.
‘‘And it was unusual. I never had shortness of breath.
And then it wasn’t every single time. You know, I’d
also notice things like I’d finish dinner and I’d go out
and play catch with my son and I’d get out of breath.
And it was a bunch of unusual circumstances like
that. And finally I – the final thing that got me into the
doctor was I went for a walk with my daughter, made
it about a half mile and had to stop and rest. Like,
okay, that’s definitely not normal.’’ (Patient 004)

3.2.1.2 Patient Characteristics Associated with Delayed
Diagnoses Table 3 describes the patient characteristics of
the survey respondents by their time to diagnosis. In this
sample, patients who received an early diagnosis did not
differ in terms of basic demographics from patients who
received a delayed diagnosis. Among patients who
received delayed diagnoses, greater proportions reported
non-disease-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, shortness
of breath, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, dizziness
upon standing, and numbness of arms and legs. Symptoms
such as purpura, which are less common in other prevalent
diseases, were not associated with time to diagnosis.
There were also significant associations between the
primary organ affected and the time to diagnosis based on
bivariate analyses. For instance, 35% of patients who
received a delayed diagnosis identified heart as the primary organ affected by the disease; whereas only 19% of
patients who received an early diagnosis identified their
heart as their most affected organ. Patients who identified
the heart as their most affected organ were 43% more
likely to obtain a delayed diagnosis as compared to
patients who identified the kidney as their most affected
organ (relative risk [RR] 1.43, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.21–1.69). The risk of a delayed diagnosis among
patients who identified other types of primary organ
involvement (i.e., liver, gastrointestinal, and nervous
system) was similarly 42% greater than the risk among
the patients with primary kidney involvement (RR 1.42,
95% CI 1.20–1.68).
3.2.1.3 Challenges of a Differential Diagnosis Once
patients began to actively pursue a diagnosis due to either
(1) suspicious or bothersome symptoms and/or (2) abnormal findings from a routine test, the path to a diagnosis was
heavily influenced by the interpretations of the signs and
symptoms by clinicians. Clinicians described the journey to
a differential diagnosis as challenging, noting that if
patients present with symptoms that were more specific to
AL amyloidosis, such as macroglossia (i.e., enlarged tongue) or pinched periorbital purpura, that could facilitate the
diagnostic process; however, few patients have these
symptoms. The vast majority of patients present with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue. Clinicians acknowledged that this presents a challenge for first-line clinicians.
One clinician (female, hematologist) used the term ‘‘a great
masquerader’’ to describe AL amyloidosis because its
symptoms are also common to other, more prevalent
conditions.
Patients in both the qualitative and quantitative study
visited multiple doctors during their journey to a diagnosis.
Among surveyed patients, more than a quarter (28%) saw
at least six doctors across various specialties before they
ultimately received their AL amyloidosis diagnosis
(Table 2). Patient interviewees consulted with an average
of three different types of specialists before they received
the correct diagnosis. As described in Table 4, the types of
specialty consultations depended on the patients’ organ
involvement and included primary care physicians, cardiologists, hematologists, nephrologists, gastroenterologists,
pulmonologists, and others.
Patients’ diagnostic narratives described many examinations and tests. Even after AL amyloidosis was suspected, additional tests were conducted for confirmation
and to further determine which organs were affected.
During interviews, patients spontaneously described a
broad range of diagnostic tests that included urinalysis and
blood tests, biopsies, and various imaging procedures.
Although patient interviewees were not systematically
queried about specific types of diagnostic tests, all interviewees reported receiving at least one biopsy (average
number of biopsies = 2; range 1–4). Bone marrow biopsies
were the most frequently mentioned (70% of interviewees).
Other biopsy locations included fat pad, heart, lung, kidney, skin, and upper/lower gastrointestinal tract. Aside
from biopsies, patients also received the following diagnostic tests or procedures: bronchoscopies; cardiac
catheterizations; cardiac magnetic resonance imaging;
colonoscopies; computerized tomography scans; echocardiograms; electrocardiograms; endoscopies; nerve conduction tests; positron emission tomography scans;
pulmonary functioning tests; and X-rays.
Clinicians further confirmed that delays in treatment
initiation occur due to the diagnostic process and additional
diagnostic testing often occurs even after a patient is
referred to a specialty clinic or a center of excellence.
Based on these interviews, clinicians reported that it can
take 1–2 months to receive confirmation of their diagnosis.
Misdiagnoses may also prolong patients’ diagnostic
journey. Eight of the ten patient interviewees received
incorrect diagnoses prior to receiving a conclusive AL
amyloidosis diagnosis.
‘‘He started talking about; he didn’t say amyloidosis
at that time but he said you know could be some
variant of leukemia in your blood system. Could be
myeloma.’’ (Patient 002)
‘‘At that point the diagnosis was still cardiomyopathy
… hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. When I was in the
hospital to get the defibrillator pacemaker a team
came in and basically just shook their heads and said,
you know, something’s not right with this diagnosis
so we’re going to do a biopsy. They did a biopsy and
the next day installed the defibrillator. I went back for
a check on the silver bandage the week after that
where they advised me that I had cardiac amyloidosis.’’ (Patient 005)
212 K. L. McCausland et al.

‘‘And when she came back, she said, ‘Oh, you have
got something called pre-leukemia, MDS,
myelodysplastic syndrome.’ She said that ‘That’s
MDS, which is a form of cancer.’’’ (Patient 008)
‘‘I think the asthma [diagnosis] absolutely was
incorrect and going through all of the asthma medications, of course, did not help.’’ (Patient 010)

The Journey to Diagnosis of AL Amyloidosis 213

3.2.2 Emotional Toll of the Diagnostic Process
Reactions to receiving a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis were
mixed. Many patients expressed a feeling of relief after
receiving their ultimate diagnosis, due to the anxiety and
uncertainty of symptoms that could not be explained. Other
patients were shocked and overwhelmed by the rareness
and seriousness of the condition. The following quotes are
representative of reactions described by patients:
‘‘… the longer it went the more and more frightened I
got because they couldn’t identify it … when they
finally said it’s amyloidosis, it’s almost a relief
because I finally knew what it was.’’ (Patient 001)
‘‘At the same exact moment [when I received the
diagnosis] I feel relieved that actually I had a diagnosis, that I wasn’t crazy. I mean there was something wrong with me that wasn’t medically
identifiable because, if not relief, there was a certain
sense of justification that it is all good. And then it hit
me when they started saying, yes, but there is no cure
for AL.’’ (Patient 008)
‘‘I can tell you the exact date when it happened, I
know it was probably about 4:00 and I remember
exactly where I was standing because I was at work,
and I had gone into a stairwell to take his call, and I
can remember in detail most of the conversation so in
terms of feelings, it’s not exactly a feeling but it was
life-changing, I knew that. I remember being distressed and wondering really what was going to
happen to me, and it was a little bit of a shock, so I
didn’t necessarily cry or anything at that moment, I
just remember being kind of overwhelmed, which is
probably the word.’’ (Patient 010)
4 Discussion
This rigorous mixed-methods study documents important
aspects of the journey to diagnosis from both the clinician
and patient perspective. Based on qualitative and quantitative data, delays in obtaining the correct diagnoses for
AL amyloidosis occur often. Common themes observed in
patient journeys included the barriers to an early diagnosis
and the emotional toll associated with both the disease and
the process.
Patients were not always concerned by initial symptoms.
Since AL amyloidosis is more likely to occur later in life, it
is not surprising that some of the non-specific symptoms,
such as fatigue and loss of appetite, were misinterpreted as
symptoms of aging or attributed to more common chronic
ailments. Interestingly, purpura, a symptom that may be
more distinctive of this disease, was not significantly
associated with time to diagnosis in bivariate analyses.
Though purpura is a distinctive symptom of the disease, its
prevalence in patients with AL amyloidosis is estimated to
be less than 15% [13]. Thus, first-line clinicians, who may
have little experience with AL amyloidosis, may still be
relatively unfamiliar with the diagnostic utility of this
symptom. Indeed, recent work has described cases in which
a proper diagnosis is missed even in the presence of this
symptom [14]. In working with clinicians to reduce barriers
to a prompt and correct diagnosis, the importance of this
symptom should be emphasized. It is also important to note
that these symptoms are varied and do not occur in

isolation, making it difficult to tease out whether specific
symptoms may serve as early indications of the disease and
lead to earlier diagnoses.
Several patients were first alerted by abnormal results on
routine urine tests rather than by their specific symptoms.
Results from the quantitative study further indicated that
patients with kidney involvement were less likely to
experience the diagnostic delays incurred by patients primarily affected by other types of organ involvement. It is
plausible that when patients receive abnormal urinalysis
results they may be more likely to see a nephrologist who
will order a kidney biopsy much earlier in the diagnostic
journey than other patients. This may subsequently accelerate diagnoses for patients with kidney involvement even
if a specialist does not suspect or is even aware of AL
amyloidosis. Further examination of whether patients with
particular symptom profiles, disease characteristics, or
patterns of healthcare utilization and proximity to a center
of excellence (i.e., individuals who see their doctors regularly and/or adhere to recommended health screenings)
are more or less likely to receive a delayed diagnosis is
warranted. Additional studies aimed at understanding how
clinicians make diagnostic decisions may have the potential to increase the accuracy and speed with which first-line
clinicians are able to recognize the disease.
Patients described a variety of tests and procedures used
to confirm their diagnosis and/or to identify affected
organs. Additional research should be conducted to identify
optimal diagnostic strategies based on sensitivity, specificity, and low risks for complications. Unnecessary biopsies and the use of diagnostic testing with low sensitivity
can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation. A
recent study reported a median delay in diagnosis of
4.1 months in cases that required more than one biopsy as
compared to patients who only needed one biopsy to obtain
a confirmation of their diagnosis with AL amyloidosis [10].
Nearly three-quarters (72%) of patients in the quantitative study received a diagnosis at least 12 months after the
onset of symptoms. This high prevalence of delayed
diagnoses suggests that the overall prevalence of the disease may be underestimated. Many patients may die of a
complication before receiving a diagnosis. Delays in
diagnosis for cardiac patients are especially concerning, as
the median survival rate among untreated patients with
cardiac involvement is approximately 6 months following
the onset of symptoms [6]. Furthermore, the prognosis for
patients with AL amyloidosis is improved by early diagnosis and treatment—the challenges and delays described
by both clinicians and patients have the potential for a
severe impact on health outcomes and impaired quality of
life. These data support a need for better early identification and support for patients looking for a diagnosis.
Clinical experts recommend the inclusion of AL
amyloidosis as a potential diagnosis when patients present
with nephrotic-range proteinuria, unexplained non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, unexplained hepatomegaly, or atypical multiple myeloma [8].
Heightened awareness and understanding of the disease
and identification of the optimal coordination of care is
paramount to help patients receive a correct diagnosis,
receive prompt treatment, and manage their disease effectively. Unnecessary procedures and misdiagnoses not only
delay treatment, but may negatively impact the patientphysician relationship and increase healthcare utilization
and subsequent costs. Data collected from the longitudinal
study may be useful in more clearly illustrating the relationship between time to diagnosis and future health
outcomes.
A number of study limitations should be noted. First,
interviews with clinicians were conducted with experts
who treat AL amyloidosis regularly. Their reports may not
fully capture some of the challenges or experiences of firstline clinicians who see patients earlier in the diagnostic
journey and are less familiar with the disease. Similarly,
patients who are able to participate in a long, in-depth
interview or complete an online survey may not be representative of the broader disease population. Given the
expectations to participate in the study, patients who are
too ill may not have agreed to participate. This, and other
potential selection biases, may have impacted observed
patterns in the data, particularly if healthier patients tend to
have similar diagnostic characteristics or histories. Despite
these limitations, these findings consistently highlighted
common barriers to diagnosis and patient experiences.
5 Conclusion
Patients experience a variety of challenges during their
journey towards a diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. Increased
awareness of the disease and its symptoms and clinical
manifestations may reduce diagnostic delays, which could
increase access to treatment and ultimately improve health
outcomes.
