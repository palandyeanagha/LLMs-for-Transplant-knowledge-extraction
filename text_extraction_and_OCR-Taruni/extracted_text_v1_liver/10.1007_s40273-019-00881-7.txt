Abstract
Background Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe, typically progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD). The global prevalence of NASH is increasing, driven partly by the global increase in obesity and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), such that NASH is now a leading cause of cirrhosis. There is currently an unmet clinical need for efcacious and cost-efective treatments for NASH; no pharmacologic agents have an approved indication for NASH.
Objective Our objective was to summarise and critically appraise published health economic models of NASH, to evaluate 
their quality and suitability for use in the assessment of novel treatments for NASH, and to identify knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities for future modelling.
Methods A systematic literature review was performed using the MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and EconLit databases to identify published health economic analyses in patients with NAFLD or NASH. Supplementary hand searches of 
grey literature were also performed. Articles published up to November 2019 were included in the review. Quality assessment 
of identifed studies was also performed.
Results A total of 19 articles comprising 16 unique models including either NAFLD as a whole or NASH alone were 
included in the review. Structurally, most models had a state-transition component; in terms of health states, two diferent 
approaches to early disease states were used, modelling either progression through fbrosis stages or NAFLD/NASH-specifc 
health states. Conditions that frequently co-exist with NASH, such as obesity, T2DM and cardiovascular disease were not 
captured in models identifed here. Late-stage complications such as cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma were consistently included, but input data (e.g. costs, utilities and transition probabilities) for late-stage complications were frequently sourced from other liver disease areas. The quality of included studies was heterogenous, and only 
a small proportion of studies reported internal and external validation processes.
Conclusion The health economic models identifed in this review are associated with limitations primarily driven by a lack 
of NASH-specifc data. Identifed models also largely overlooked the intricate association between NASH and other conditions, including obesity and T2DM, and did not capture the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with NASH. 
High-quality, transparent, validated health economic models of NASH will be required to evaluate the cost efectiveness of 
treatments currently in development, particularly compounds that may target other non-hepatic outcomes.

1 Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an overarching 
term and defned as the presence of≥5% hepatic steatosis 
in the absence of secondary causes of hepatic fat accumulation and includes both non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [1]. NAFL is defned 
as “≥5% hepatic steatosis, but without evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of hepatocyte ballooning” [1]. 
A subset of patients with NAFLD have NASH, which is 
progressive and defned as “the presence of≥5% hepatic 
steatosis and infammation with hepatocyte injury, with or 
without fbrosis” [1]. On a global level, the prevalence of 
NAFLD is estimated at around 20–30% in adults [2, 3], and 
the prevalence of NASH is estimated at 2–5% [2].
NASH occurs as a consequence of a state of lipid surplus in which the rate of uptake or synthesis of lipids into

Key Points for Decision Makers
There is a paucity of data specifc to non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) relating to cost inputs, quality of life and 
disease progression to inform the development of health 
economic models. Many currently available models rely 
on input data from other liver disease areas.
Identifed models typically do not include cardiovascular 
outcomes or account for the fact that NASH often coexists alongside other conditions, including obesity and 
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
The treatment benefts of pharmacologic agents currently in development for NASH may extend beyond the 
hepatocyte. As such, there is an unmet need for models 
that take cardiovascular outcomes and comorbid conditions such as obesity and T2DM into account.
Model developers are restricted by the data that are 
available; future studies linking surrogate outcomes to 
hard clinical endpoints may assist model developers in 
terms of modelling long-term outcomes based on available short-term data.
Identifed health economic models of NASH are largely 
product specifc; there is an unmet need for non-productspecifc models, which would also facilitate comparison 
of fndings across diferent analyses.
The reporting quality of identifed models was heterogenous; increased transparency is needed in the development of future models to enhance credibility and 
acceptance with payers, policy makers and other key 
stakeholders.
NAFLD with simple steatosis may have no progression or 
even regression of disease, and these patients do not have an 
elevated mortality risk [9]. However, approximately 30–40% 
of patients who develop NASH will develop fbrosis to a 
varying degree, and 15–20% of those with fbrosis will go 
on to develop cirrhosis, which is in turn associated with an 
elevated risk for decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), requirement for liver transplantation and 
liver-related mortality [10].
As NASH is a progressive disease, its increasing prevalence has notable implications in terms of the clinical and 
economic burden of disease on national and global levels. 
In the USA alone, total annual direct medical costs related 
to the treatment and management of patients with NAFLD 
(including patients with NAFL, NASH and later complication states, including fbrosis, cirrhosis and HCC) are estimated at over $US100 billion (€91 billion; October 2019 
exchange rate) ($US1613 [€1472] per patient), whereas the 
corresponding fgure in Germany, France and Italy combined is estimated at €28 billion (€354–1163 per patient) 
[11]. Total direct costs for patients with NASH (including 
those with late-stage complications, i.e. fbrosis, cirrhosis 
and HCC) were $US17 billion (€15.5 billion) in the USA 
and €5 billion for Germany, France and Italy combined [11]. 
Despite the considerable clinical and economic burden of 
NASH, no drugs are indicated for the treatment of NASH 
in either the USA or Europe, although the of-label use of 
pioglitazone and vitamin E is mentioned in both US and 
European guidelines [1, 12]. Several diferent pathways 
can lead to disease progression. As such, phase II/III trials 
of a number of drugs with diferent mechanisms of action 
are ongoing [13]. Given the rapid rise in the prevalence 
of NASH, an unmet clinical need exists for drugs that can 
arrest or reverse the progression of disease, particularly in 
patients progressing to fbrosis and potentially cirrhosis. 
Further, novel drugs with mechanisms of action that may 
extend beyond the hepatocyte, such as anti-infammatory 
agents, insulin sensitizers or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists may have systemic efects that independently 
infuence non-hepatic outcomes. Alongside the demonstration of clinical efcacy, in ever more cost-constrained environments, it is becoming increasingly important for novel 
drugs to also demonstrate long-term cost efectiveness. 
Such evaluations will ideally require high-quality, transparent health economic models as well as high-quality clinical, 
economic and quality-of-life (QoL) input data. To this end, 
the aim of the current review was to summarise and critically 
appraise published health economic models of NASH (and 
NAFLD) and to evaluate their quality and suitability for use 
in the assessment of novel treatments for NASH, as well as 
to identify knowledge gaps, challenges and opportunities for 
future modelling.
hepatocytes exceeds the rate of export and degradation 
[4]. The development and rate of progression of NASH is 
highly heterogeneous between patients, refecting the complex interplay between diferent underlying etiologic factors, including lifestyle, diet, genetics and epigenetics [5]. 
However, in NAFLD, several factors, including diabetes and 
elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels have been 
shown to be signifcant independent predictors of progression to moderate or severe fbrosis [6]. NAFLD and aspects 
of the metabolic syndrome share common etiologic components [7], and NAFLD is increasingly considered to represent a hepatic component of the metabolic syndrome [8].
NAFL is largely asymptomatic, and NASH may also be 
asymptomatic in many patients, or patients may present 
with non-specifc symptoms such as fatigue. Patients with

2 Methods
A systematic literature review was performed using the 
MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and EconLit databases. The review was conducted in line with Cochrane 
guidelines [14], and search strategies were constructed 
using both medical subject headings and free-text terms 
(full details of the search strategies used are provided in 
Tables  1–7 in the Electronic Supplementary Material 
[ESM]). Initial searches were performed in July 2018 and 
updated in November 2019 to capture the most recently 
published articles. Supplementary hand searches of grey 
literature were also performed. For inclusion, studies were 
required to be full-text publications (data were not extracted 
from analyses published as abstracts alone) of health economic analyses in patients with NAFLD or NASH and published in English. No restrictions were applied in terms of 
interventions, comparators or outcomes. First-round screening of titles and abstracts was followed by second-round 
full-text screening of short-listed articles and data extraction of articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Both frst- and 
second-round screening was performed by two independent 
reviewers, and disagreements relating to the inclusion or 
exclusion of articles were resolved by discussion and consensus or, where necessary, through consultation with a 
senior reviewer.
Data extraction was performed using pre-designed data 
extraction tables in Microsoft Word. Data extracted from 
each article included model characteristics, health state 
utility values, costs, treatment efects, model validation 
and uncertainty (stochastic and parameter level). Strengths, 
limitations and key fndings of included analyses were also 
evaluated. The quality of included analyses was assessed 
using the Philips et al. [15] checklist, which is a 53-item 
checklist assessing model structure and data quality.
3 Results
3.1 Literature Search Results
The combined original (July 2018) and updated (November 
2019) literature searches across the four included databases 
identifed a total of 539 hits, of which 97 were duplicates, 
therefore yielding a total of 442 unique hits (Fig. 1). A further 369 hits were excluded during the frst-round screening of titles and abstracts, and 56 were excluded during the 
second-round full-text screening. A further two articles were 
identifed through supplementary searches of grey literature. 
As such, a total of 19 articles [11, 16–33] (capturing 16 different models) were included in the review; summary details 
of identifed studies are shown in Table 1.
A total of 13 articles assessed health economic outcomes 
associated with diferent screening or diagnostic strategies 
[16, 18–21, 26–33]; fve assessed outcomes with diferent 
treatments, including lifestyle intervention, pioglitazone, 
vitamin E and obeticholic acid as well as bariatric surgery 
for overweight/obese patients with NASH [17, 22–25]. The 
remaining article examined the overall clinical and economic 
burden of disease and as such was a non-comparative study 
[11].
3.2 Model Approach and Structure
Analyses identifed in the review examined either NAFLD 
as a whole, NASH alone or both NAFLD and NASH as

separate entities (Table 1). There was heterogeneity in terms 
of the way in which NASH was considered, with several 
using health states specifc to NAFLD/NASH. For example, 
seven articles specifcally used ‘steatosis’ or ‘steatohepatitis’ 
health states [11, 17, 18, 21, 30, 31, 33]. In contrast, other 
investigators used fbrosis states or states such as ‘signifcant liver disease’, which corresponded to fbrosis stages 
(see Table 8 in the ESM for a detailed overview of health 
states used).
In terms of model structure, most identifed models were 
state-transition models, with or without a preceding decision tree [11, 17, 18, 22–26, 29–31, 33], and four consisted 
of decision trees alone [16, 21, 28, 32] (one further model 
was described by the authors as a “simple decision model” 
and therefore was also considered likely to be a decision tree 
[19]), all of which used a cohort-based population approach. 
Three models were described as microsimulation models, 
thereby using an individual patient-level approach [25, 30, 
31]. As noted, there was substantial heterogeneity between 
the diferent models with regard to the consideration of 
NASH alone, including both NASH and NAFLD but as 
separate health states or implicitly including NASH but utilising an overarching NAFLD health state. Additionally, of 
the models that used state-transition elements, two distinct 
approaches for modelling health states early in the course 
of the disease were identifed (see Table 8 in the ESM). 
The frst and most common approach, used in six publications [17, 18, 22, 25, 26, 29], was to use fbrosis stages. 
Four studies [17, 25, 26, 29] that used this approach used 
transition probabilities sourced from a meta-analysis of 11 
studies of paired biopsy samples in patients with biopsyproven NAFLD, including 150 patients with NAFL and 261 
with NASH [34]. A key limitation of this data source was 
that, because of low patient numbers for patients with more 
severe disease, rates of progression were only reported for 
patients with NAFL or NASH with F0 or F1 disease at baseline (as well as for a pooled population of patients with F0 
or F1 disease at baseline). Therefore, it was assumed that the 
rate of progression for later stages (e.g. F2–F3) was linear. 
However, one advantage of the use of fbrosis stages is that it 
allowed for the use of utility and cost data from studies conducted in other liver disease areas. The second commonly 
used approach for early disease health states was the use of 
NAFLD- and NASH-specifc health states, which was used 
in three publications [11, 24, 33]. For example, in Younossi 
et al. [11], early disease health states included “NAFL” and 
“NASH-non-cirrhotic”. Similarly, early disease health states 
used by Zhang et al. [33] included no steatosis, steatosis, 
steatohepatitis or fbrosis.
The approach to later stages of disease was relatively 
consistent for models that used a state-transition approach. 
Health states typically included cirrhosis, decompensated 
cirrhosis, HCC and liver transplantation. Notably, three 
articles (two models) considered HCC in detail [24, 30, 31]. 
For example, within HCC, Mahady et al. [24] considered 
states including resection, locoregional therapy, treatment 
with sorafenib and palliative care. Additionally, three models 
omitted the possibility of liver transplantation [18, 26, 33]. 
Although liver transplantation only afects a small proportion of patients, it is associated with high direct medical 
costs. Transition probabilities for progression from compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis or HCC, etc. were 
frequently sourced from studies in other liver diseases, particularly hepatitis C. Health states associated with comorbid 
conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular outcomes were 
generally not considered in the identifed models.
3.3 Health State Utilities and Costs
In terms of utility values for diferent health states, three 
diferent approaches were identifed. The frst approach was 
to use utilities in patients with other liver diseases, particularly hepatitis C [17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26, 33]. The second 
approach was to use utility values specifc to NAFLD/NASH 
health states using data from a study by David et al. [35] 
that assessed QoL in patients with NAFLD/NASH using the 
36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and then 
mapping these values to the Health Utilities Index (HUI)-2 
[11, 33]. The third approach, used by Tanajewski et al. [29], 
was to use values derived from expert opinion (see Table 9 
in the ESM for full details of health state utility values used 
in identifed modelling analyses). Additionally, direct costs 
associated with late-stage disease/complications such as cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC were also commonly sourced from studies in other liver diseases, again frequently from analyses in patients with hepatitis C (Table 10 
in the ESM). One multinational analysis [11] used a microcosting approach (in addition to previously published costs) 
for early disease states. Resource use for NAFL and precirrhotic NASH states was determined through consultation 
with clinical experts, and this was then mapped to national 
fee schedules [11]. The use of hepatitis C cost data as a proxy 
was generally attributed to the paucity of cost data specifcally relating to NAFLD and NASH. However, as noted by 
some of the authors of included studies, it is reasonable to 
assume that the direct costs of the management of states/
complications such as cirrhosis, HCC and liver transplantation will be similar irrespective of the underlying aetiology.
3.4 Treatment Efects
Although no drugs are currently indicated for the treatment of NASH, several of the identifed articles performed 
analyses that used data from phase II trials or investigator-initiated studies of drugs used of-label, including 

Health Economic Modelling of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis 491
thiazolidinediones [17, 18, 24, 29, 33], vitamin E [17, 24, 
30, 31, 33] and obeticholic acid [25] (see Table 11 in the 
ESM for full details). A further eight articles included 
comparisons using data from studies examining the 
efects of lifestyle interventions, including weight loss 
and bariatric surgery [17, 22–24, 26, 30, 31, 33]. Efcacy was typically assessed in small-scale trials in terms 
of improvement in histology. Typically, a relative risk 
adjustment to the rate of progression or regression of 
fbrosis was applied to patients in treatment arms where 
histologic improvement was reported based on data either 
directly from trials or—for thiazolidinediones—a metaanalysis. On a related issue, only two articles identifed in 
the review explicitly captured treatment-related adverse 
events or complications. Specifcally, Pearson et al. [25] 
captured the efects of pruritus and dyslipidaemia associated with the use of obeticholic acid in two phase II 
trials [36, 37] and Klebanof et al. [23] captured the risk, 
QoL detriment and costs associated with minor and major 
complications associated with bariatric surgery. Klebanof 
et al. [23] also included an adjustment for the likelihood 
of clinical decompensation according to body mass index. 
The primary and secondary endpoint and safety data available from trials of drugs currently in development will be 
key determinants of future modelling analyses, but only 
endpoints that can be used to accurately project long-term 
outcomes, such as progression of fbrosis, may be suitable for modelling. Drug development guidelines issued by 
the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
advocate that either resolution of steatohepatitis without 
worsening of fbrosis or improvement in liver fbrosis of 
at least one stage with no worsening of steatohepatitis 
be used as primary endpoints in phase III trials of new 
drugs for NASH [38, 39]. Similarly, a 2019 joint workshop 
statement from the American Association for the Study 
of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association 
for the Study of the Liver (EASL) included resolution 
of steatohepatitis (with no worsening of fbrosis) or an 
improvement of at least two points in NAFLD Activity 
Score (NAS) as recommended primary endpoints in clinical trials [40], but linking such endpoints to long-term 
outcomes is likely required before they can be used in 
health economic analyses. The utility of other commonly 
used secondary endpoints such as change in ALT levels, 
lobular infammation or change in hepatic fat levels that 
cannot be linked with long-term progression may therefore 
be limited in terms of health economic modelling.
3.5 Non‑Hepatic Outcomes and Consideration 
of Co‑Existing Conditions
The models identifed in the review did not account for 
changes in metabolic and cardiovascular parameters that are 
intricately linked with NASH. Several individual studies and 
meta-analyses have shown that NAFLD is associated with 
a signifcantly elevated risk for cardiovascular events [41, 
42]; indeed, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of 
death in patients with NAFLD [43]. However, cardiovascular 
endpoints were omitted from the identifed models, but if 
the regression of fbrosis can infuence the risk of cardiovascular endpoints, which are frequently associated with high 
direct medical costs and a substantial decrement in QoL, 
this may warrant consideration in future health economic 
models. This is also particularly pertinent for any interventions that target aspects of metabolic pathways, such as lipid 
metabolism or other parameters such as insulin resistance, 
which may impact metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in addition to hepatic outcome measures. Allied to this, 
co-existing conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) were also not considered as separate health 
states in the identifed models. However, one analysis did 
perform separate analyses of a NASH screening strategy for 
a general population, obese patients and patients with T2DM 
based on diferent prevalence rates for steatosis and NASH 
in the three diferent patient populations [33].
3.6 Uncertainty and Validation
The internal and external validation of the identifed models 
was also examined. Only three analyses explicitly reported 
internal validation processes [17, 29, 32], although deterministic and/or probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed 
by most investigators to verify that the model was projecting 
outcomes as anticipated and determining key drivers of results 
(Table 2). External validation processes were fully described 
in three analyses [11, 18, 32]. Where external validation processes were described, these included the comparisons of 
outcomes with those from previously published studies [18, 
32] as well as by comparing those generated using a specialist 
disease modelling software package (DisMod II) [11].
3.7 Study Quality
Assessment of study quality using the checklist by Philips 
et al. [15] revealed substantial heterogeneity between analyses in terms of quality. Full results of the quality assessment are presented in Table 12 in the ESM. Overall, quality 
assessment revealed that the identifed models were wellsuited to their purpose. For example, using the Philips checklist, all included analyses had “outcomes consistent with the 
objectives”, nearly all (18/19) models were considered to 
be “appropriate given the decision problem”, 16/19 were 
considered as having “data modelling methodology based 
on justifable statistical and epidemiological techniques” and 
18/19 analyses were considered as investigating “all feasible 
and practical options” (see Table 12 in the ESM).

4 Discussion
4.1 Overview of Existing Models
Overall, review of published health economic models of 
NAFLD/NASH demonstrated that most economic models 
of NAFLD used a state-transition model approach and that 
the approach to modelling late-stage complications was generally consistent, although diferent approaches were used 
to model earlier disease and the quality of existing models 
was heterogenous. Additionally, most of the published costefectiveness analyses in NAFLD/NASH were conducted 
for North American or European settings, with only three 
publications from another country (Thailand [17, 26] and 
Australia [24]). However, the literature searches were limited to studies published in English, so it is feasible that 
other studies in non-English languages may be available but 
not included here. The literature review also highlighted a 
general paucity of input data for economic analyses in this 
area (Table 3).
In particular, health state utilities, complication costs and 
transition probabilities were frequently sourced from studies 
conducted in other liver disease areas, particularly hepatitis 
C. Whereas the use of input data from other disease areas 
may be suboptimal, it should be noted that model developers are restricted in terms of the available data, and—where 
data gaps exist—are faced with having to evaluate the relative merits and limitations of diferent alternatives or proxy 
sources. For example, health technology assessment (HTA) 
agencies in some countries, such as Sweden, prefer analyses that use health state utilities elicited using direct methods such as standard gamble or time trade-of, and others

prefer indirect methods, with HTAs in countries such as 
the UK, Netherlands and Belgium specifcally mentioning 
the EuroQoL 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) tool [44]. However, 
utility values for NAFLD-/NASH-specifc health states and 
specifcally utility values elicited using the EQ-5D are lacking. This leaves model developers in countries such as the 
UK with the alternatives of using NAFLD/NASH-specifc 
values elicited using the SF-36 and mapped to the HUI-2 
or using EQ-5D values for diferent fbrosis stages elicited 
from patients with other liver diseases (primarily hepatitis 
B or C). However, this issue is likely limited to early disease 
states as utility values (and also direct costs) for late-stage 
complications, such as decompensated cirrhosis, are unlikely 
to be signifcantly infuenced by the underlying aetiology of 
liver disease.
Model developers are also faced with the issue of how 
best to capture the QoL decrements associated with health 
states that frequently co-exist in patients with NAFLD/
NASH, such as obesity and T2DM while avoiding ‘double counting’ of QoL decrements. One alternative is to use 
a multiplicative approach to model the QoL decrement in 
instances of comorbid conditions, which is accepted by 
some HTA agencies, including the UK National Institute 
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), but this approach 
also relies on assumptions. Three analyses identifed in the 
review assigned a mean utility value of 1.0 to the states of 
NAFLD and simple steatosis [30, 31, 33], which—given the 
mean age of NAFLD/NASH populations and high prevalence of obesity and T2DM within this patient population—
may be unrealistic. Current limitations around the lack of 
data could potentially be overcome with data from clinical 
trials of novel drugs, particularly if trials include patientreported outcomes such as QoL. Further studies specifcally 
in patients with NASH are needed to address some data 
gaps, such as QoL and costs and linking surrogate outcomes 
to hard clinical endpoints. These data are likely to become 
available in the future with the ongoing development of new 
drugs for the treatment of NASH.
4.2 Considerations for Future Model Development
A key consideration for future model developers is how best 
to capture the progression and regression of liver disease. 
The approach used by several investigators to date was to 
model progression through stages of fbrosis using transition 
probabilities derived from a meta-analysis by Singh et al. 
[34]. However, this approach is associated with a number 
of limitations. First, Singh et al. [34] only reported mean 
rates of progression for patients with stage 0 or 1 fbrosis 
at baseline for patients with NAFLD, NAFL and NASH. 
Consequently, in the absence of data, model developers 
necessarily assumed that the rate of progression between 
diferent fbrosis stages was linear. In hepatitis C, fbrosis 
progression estimates are frequently sourced from Thein 
et al. [45], in which the rate of progression between diferent 
fbrosis stages was similar. However, whether this assumption is transferable across diferent liver disease areas has 
yet to be elucidated. Additionally, in their meta-analysis 
Singh et al. [34] noted that the rate of progression was heterogenous and that 21% of patients with NAFLD could be 
classifed as “rapid progressors” and progressed from stage 
0 to stage 3 or 4 fbrosis over a mean±standard deviation of 
5.9±3.7 years. However, Singh et al. [34] did not present 
separate progression rates for rapid versus slow progressors. 
Factors including older age, presence of T2DM, higher steatosis grade and low aspartate transaminase (AST):alanine 
transaminase (ALT) ratio have previously been linked with 
more rapid progression; [34] however, diferential rates of 
progression for rapid versus slow progressors have not been 
captured in the identifed models. As such, this is an area 
that may warrant further investigation and potentially the 
development of risk equations linking patient-related factors 
such as age or presence of comorbidities as well as surrogate endpoints such as steatosis or AST:ALT ratio to rate of 
progression. The ability to model progression and identify 
and perform subgroup analyses in rapid progressors would 
be a useful feature worthy of consideration for inclusion in 
future models. Another aspect that was largely overlooked 
in identifed models was the intricate association between 
NAFLD/NASH and obesity, T2DM and cardiovascular outcomes as well as the possibility for regression of disease 
and the downstream implications of this, such as the efect 
on cardiovascular risk factors or even cardiovascular outcomes [46, 47]. One group partially addressed this issue by 
performing separate analyses in patients who were obese or 
had T2DM at baseline [33], but this approach does not fully 
capture the long-term complication risks associated with 
frequently co-existing conditions such as T2DM.
The focus on changes in fbrosis stage alone in both clinical studies and modelling analysis means that potentially 
clinically meaningful changes in other histologic parameters such as steatosis, ballooning, lobular infammation and 
portal infammation, as well as changes in cardiometabolic 
risk factors, may not be captured. Moreover, in addition to 
changes in fbrosis, recommended primary endpoints for 
phase III trials in patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH include 
resolution of NASH without worsening of fbrosis or≥1 
stage reduction in fbrosis (without worsening of steatosis 
in EMA and FDA guidance), or≥2-point reduction in NAS 
with≥1-point reduction in either lobular infammation or 
hepatocellular ballooning and no worsening of fibrosis 
[38, 39, 48]. In AASLD/EASL guidance, recommended 
secondary endpoints in phase II/III clinical trials include 
cardiometabolic risk factors [48]. However, for endpoints 
to be suitable for economic modelling, they must be defnitively linked with long-term outcomes such as occurrence 

494 P. Johansen et al.
of cirrhosis, HCC or liver-related mortality. Long-term data 
linking histologic outcomes such as improvement in NAS 
to long-term outcomes are scarce, which presents a barrier 
to their use in modelling analyses. Indeed, evidence to date 
suggests that fbrosis is the only endpoint that can currently 
be independently linked with long-term outcomes, including 
liver-related morbidity and mortality [49, 50].
With regard to the structure of future models for NASH, 
given the heterogeneity of NASH as a condition, it is feasible 
that a microsimulation approach rather than a cohort-level 
approach may represent the optimal approach for future 
models. In particular, the microsimulation approach (unlike 
the cohort approach) allows for heterogeneity to be captured on an individual patient level. It also ofers a fexible 
approach and allows for the modelling of factors that have 
non-linear relationships with model outcomes, and NASH 
has been shown to have non-linear disease pathology (exemplifed by the existence of fast progressors and slow progressors) [51].
4.3 The Future of Treatment for Non‑Alcoholic Fatty 
Liver Disease/Non‑Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
There is currently an unmet clinical need for efcacious 
pharmacological treatments for NASH. Lifestyle modifcations such as weight loss have been associated with regression of NASH, but some patients fnd lifestyle modifcations 
difcult to sustain [52]. Indeed, European guidelines state 
that bariatric surgery can be considered for obese patients 
who have been unresponsive to lifestyle modifcations and 
pharmacotherapy [12]. Bariatric surgery has been shown 
to reduce liver fat levels via improvements in obesity and 
diabetes but is also associated with a risk of peri-operative 
and post-operative complications [12]. Additionally, the use 
of pioglitazone and vitamin E is recommended in both European and US guidelines [1, 12]; however, both agents are 
used of label, and no drugs are currently indicated for use in 
NASH in either Europe or the USA. This has implications in 
terms of the availability of robust clinical data for comparator treatments and for demonstrating cost efectiveness relative to the current standard of care (SoC). In the absence of 
approved drug treatments, the current SoC for patients with 
NASH is lifestyle modifcation and weight loss. This means 
that in future trials of novel drugs, the comparison may be 
active treatment plus lifestyle modifcation versus placebo 
plus lifestyle modifcation, which may necessitate the use of 
indirect comparisons to compare diferent novel drug treatments. Allied to this, several of the agents currently in development for the treatment of NASH target processes such 
as oxidative stress or insulin resistance and therefore may 
be associated with therapeutic benefts extending beyond 
the hepatocyte, which should also be taken into account in 
health economic modelling analyses.
4.4 Transparency in Future Economic Models
Future economic models of NAFLD/NASH should conform 
to good practice standards. These include but are not limited 
to appropriately and adequately representing the disease process, balancing the necessary complexity required to appropriately capture all necessary aspects of the disease process 
but not being so complex as to be unclear and compromise 
transparency, as well as appropriately considering uncertainty, using conservative assumptions in the absence of data 
and having appropriate validation and sufcient transparency 
to enable others to reproduce the model [53–55]. In particular, transparency and validation are regarded as crucial for 
imbuing the model with credibility for interested stakeholders [56]. This review of identifed NAFLD/NASH models 
revealed substantial heterogeneity in terms of the reporting 
of models and also a general lack of reporting of validation 
processes.
Additionally, a consistent limitation identifed across 
all included publications was that structural uncertainty 
was not addressed. Other commonly identifed limitations 
included failure to assess the quality of input data (identifed in 13 publications), failure to provide evidence that the 
mathematical logic of the model had been thoroughly tested 
before use (13 publications) and failure to present evidence 
of comparison or cross-validation with other models (nine 
publications). However, it should be noted that an inherent limitation of quality assessment is that fndings may 
be negatively infuenced in instances where the quality of 
reporting of the model structure, development and input 
data sources is poor or restricted because of stringent word 
limits applied by some journals, which may mean that the 
quality of the reporting of an analysis may not accurately 
refect the quality of the actual modelling analysis per se. 
However, to circumvent this, authors could select journals 
that allow publication of supplementary online material for 
interested readers.
A lack of transparency relating to some aspects of health 
economic models in other liver disease areas, such as chronic 
hepatitis B, has also been reported [57]. One approach to 
enhancing transparency and validation is the formation of 
informal networks within disease areas to actively promote 
this. For example, the Mount Hood Diabetes Challenge Network is an informal association of diabetes modellers that 
holds regular meetings with an aim of promoting transparency though validation and allows for internal, external and 
cross-validation of available diabetes models [56]. Previous 
meetings have involved transparency challenges wherein 
model developers are tasked with reproducing the results 
of clinical and cost-efectiveness analyses, with diferences 
between models compared and rationale sought for any 
major diferences [56, 58]. The Mount Hood group have 
also developed the Diabetes Modelling Input Checklist, a 

Health Economic Modelling of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis 495
disease-specifc checklist [58]. Corresponding networks in 
other disease areas could similarly promote transparency and 
validation. Another approach would be more widespread use 
of validation checklists such as the AdViSHE tool published 
by Vemer et al. [59] or the establishment of other diseasespecifc modelling checklists, which may be more useful in 
terms of capturing nuances specifc to individual therapy 
areas. None of the articles identifed in this review used the 
AdViSHE tool for validation, although it should be noted 
that 6 of the 19 included articles predated the publication of 
the AdViSHE tool. Further, with regard to validation processes specifcally, peer reviewers have an integral role to 
play by requesting that model developers include details of 
validation processes in publications. Additionally, another 
potential caveat of economic models created de novo is that 
they are often designed to be highly product specifc and, 
while this has the advantage of accurately capturing aspects 
such as treatment-related adverse events, non-product-specifc models have the advantage of enabling comparison of 
fndings across diferent analyses and treatments.
5 Conclusions
Available models were associated with limitations, largely 
driven by a lack of data specifc to NAFLD/NASH patient 
populations; however, a key limitation with regard to model 
structure was the consistent omission of health states relating to conditions that frequently exist alongside NASH, 
such as obesity and T2DM, as well as the omission of the 
increased risk for cardiovascular disease reported in patients 
with NASH. High-quality, transparent, validated health economic models of NASH will be required to evaluate the cost 
efectiveness of novel treatments currently in development, 
particularly for compounds that may target both hepatic and 
non-hepatic outcomes.
