Abstract
Background: A consensus has been reached that carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) screening in
immunosuppressed individuals can reduce the incidence of CRE bloodstream infection (BSI).
Methods: We retrospectively studied the clinical data of 395 consecutive HSCT patients from September 2017 to
April 2019. From September 2017 to June 2018 (period 1), 200 patients received single CRE screening before
transplantation. From July 2018 to April 2019 (period 2), 195 patients received continuous weekly CRE screening
after admission. For patients colonized with CRE, targeted managements were received: (1) contact precautions and
(2) preemptive CRE-targeted treatment if necessary.
Results: During period 1, 3 patients with CRE colonization were detected (1.5%). The CRE BSI rate was 2.0% (4
patients), and the related 30-day mortality was 50.0% (2 out of 4 patients). During period 2, 21 patients with CRE
colonization were detected, and the detection rate was significantly higher than that in period 1 (P < 0.001). Of the
21 colonized patients, 4 (19.0%) patients were identified as positive for CRE at the first screening, 5 (23.8%) were
identified at the second screening, and the remaining 12 (57.1%) were identified at the third or later screening. The
CRE BSI rate decreased to 0.5% (1/195), and there were no CRE-related death.
Fifteen colonized patients developed neutropenic fever. Thirteen colonizers were preemptively treated with
tigecycline within 24 h of fever onset, and they achieved rapid temperature control. One colonizer received
tigecycline later than 48 h after fever onset and ultimately survived due to the addition of polymyxin. The other
received tigecycline later than 72 h after fever onset and died of septic shock.
Conclusion: The increase in screening frequency contributed to the detection of patients with CRE colonization.
Targeted managements for these colonized patients may contribute to reducing the incidence and mortality of CRE
BSI, therefore improving the prognosis of patients.

Introduction
With the extensive use of carbapenems, a global dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
has been reported in recent decades [1]. A recent national
multicenter study from 25 provinces in China reported
that the rate of carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli
(E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) was
up to 0.6–3.6% and 1.2–18.9%, with 1.8 and 12.3% in Zhejiang Province, respectively, which has increased year after
year [2]. Long-term hospitalization, frequent use of broadspectrum antibiotics, high-dose chemotherapy, neutropenia, compromised immunity, and gastrointestinal mucosal destruction are risk factors favoring CRE
colonization and bloodstream infections (BSIs) in patients
with hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [3–8]. The overall incidence of BSIs caused by CRE in HSCT recipients is approximately 1.8–2%. Due to the lack of effective antibiotic
treatment, the death rate of CRE BSIs after HSCT is high
(51–65%) [3, 6, 9, 10]. Increasing studies have revealed the
importance of preemptive intervention in the prevention
and treatment of CRE BSIs.
Gut colonization by CRE is an independent risk factor
for CRE infection [7, 8, 11, 12]. An Italian multicenter
study showed that in patients who underwent autologous
and allogeneic HSCT, the CRE colonization rates were 1
and 2.4%, respectively. Of these patients with CRE
colonization, 25.8 and 39.2% subsequently developed CRE
BSIs, which was significantly more frequent than the rate
of general hospitalized patients (16.5%) [6]. Early identification of CRE colonization made it easier to adopt early
strategies to control CRE dissemination [13]. Many guidelines and studies also recommend HSCT patients as a target population for CRE screening, and consider stool as
the preferred sample for screening because of good patient
compliance and few side effects [5, 14–18]. However, for
HSCT centers where CRE are endemic nosocomial pathogens, the effect of weekly active screening on morbidity
and mortality of CRE BSIs has rarely been reported.
In our center, the first case of CRE BSI was identified
in May 2016, and the incidence and related mortality of
CRE BSIs from May 2016 to August 2017 was 1.9 and
66.7%, respectively. Given the high CRE BSI-related
mortality, we initiated active screening from September
2017 in an attempt to identify CRE-colonized patients
and to reduce the rate of CRE BSIs. This study aimed to
evaluate the effect of CRE screening and intervention
measures in the prevention and control of CRE BSI during the early stage of transplantation.
Patients and methods
Patients and study design
This was a retrospective observational study of 395 consecutive patients who underwent HSCT in our center
from September 2017 to April 2019. From September
2017 to June 2018 (period 1), we implemented single
CRE rectal screening within 1 week before transplantation. From July 2018 to April 2019 (period 2), to improve the positive detection rate, we implemented
continuous weekly screening until hematopoietic reconstruction. CRE screening would be repeated in patients
who had fever or underwent gut complications, such as
abdominal pain, diarrhea and perianal inflammation.
Data retrospectively collected from the two periods were
compared. The CRE gut colonization rate, CRE BSI rate
and attributed mortality at day 30 from the positivity of
blood cultures were evaluated. Informed consent for
HSCT, collection of stool swabs, data analysis, and publication was obtained from patients. The study protocol
complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Surveillance
Stool was the surveillance material in our center. Specimens were collected in an aseptic manner and immediately transported to the microbiology laboratory. The
technician inoculated the samples on Columbia blood
agar for microbial identification, and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed. CRE was defined as any isolated Enterobacteriaceae resistant to meropenem (disc
diffusion diameter ≤ 19 mm), ertapenem (MIC≥2 μg/ml)
or imipenem (MIC≥4 μg/ml) [19]. Patients who had a
positive stool swab for CRE during the screening period
were defined as colonized, while patients who continuously tested negative for CRE during the whole screening period were defined as noncolonized [14].
Targeted managements of CRE colonization
For patients colonized with CRE, contact precautions
were applied, including a single room, a hanging sign,
hand hygiene performed before and after entering the
room, use of disposable gloves and gowns and strengthened environmental cleaning and disinfection. Patients
who were colonized with CRE but had no fever also received contact precaution but were not treated with
prophylactic antibiotics.
A single oral temperature of ≥38.3 °C or a persistent oral
temperature > 38.0 °C sustained over 1 h was defined as
fever, and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below
0.5 × 109
/L was defined as neutropenia in this study [20].
CRE BSI was diagnosed with the collection of blood cultures that yielded a CRE strain. When the colonized patient exhibited febrile episodes, treatment was conducted
according to the patient’s condition, neutropenic severity,
infection clinical symptoms and laboratory examination.
At least two consecutive blood cultures were sent before
starting antibiotics for patients with clinical symptoms.
Preemptive CRE-targeted treatment with tigecycline was
performed under all the following conditions: (i) CRE
Yang et al. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control (2020) 9:49 Page 2 of 9

colonization identified at the onset of fever; (ii) neutropenic fever persistent over 12 h or fever with obvious
symptoms of intestinal infection, such as abdominal pain,
diarrhea, and perianal pain; and (iii) C-reactive protein
(CRP) at 5 times higher than normal with or without a significant increase in procalcitonin (PCT). Polymyxin was
added if there were signs of progression of sepsis or if
there was a lack of response for tigecycline treatment
within 48 h [18, 21].
Statistical analysis
Data analyses were performed with SPSS (version 20.0
SPSS Inc., IBM Co., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test; categorical variables were evaluated with Fisher’s exact test
or Pearson chi square test. All tests and P-values were
two-sided, and a P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 395 patients who underwent HSCT from September 2017 to April 2019 were evaluated. Two hundred
and twenty-one (55.9%) were male, and 174 (44.1%)
were female, with a median age of 36 years (range, 9–
67). Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in age, sex, underlying
disease or type of HSCT.
CRE detection rate, BSI incidence and clinical outcomes
During period 1, 3 patients (3/200, 1.5%) were identified
as colonized with CRE in the gut; one died of septic
shock, and the other two survived. Four patients who
were screened negative for CRE colonization before
HSCT later developed CRE BSIs (4/200, 2%) during the
HSCT period. Two (50%) out of the 4 patients died, as
one patient died of CRE-related septic shock and the
other of CRE BSI-induced thrombotic microangiopathy.
During period 2, 21 (10.8%) out of 195 patients were
identified to be colonized with CRE, which was a significantly higher percentage than that identified by single
screening (p < 0.001). Among these patients, the median
number of screening times performed in patients was 6
(ranging from 4 to 15 times): only 4 (19.0%) patients
were identified as positive for CRE at the first screening,
5 (23.8%) at the second screening, and the remaining 12
(57.1%) at the third or more screening. One of these colonized patients with neutropenia subsequently developed CRE BSI (1/21, 4.8%) but survived (Table 2).
Targeted managements
Twenty-four patients (3 detected during period 1 and 21
detected during period 2) were identified to be colonized
with CRE in the gut, and the clinical manifestations are
summarized in Table 3. Among the 3 patients who received a single screening, 2 patients were positive for
CRE screening before transplantation and developed
fever at day + 7 and day + 5 after screening. They

received tigecycline-based treatment within 24 h of developing fever, and their body temperatures were controlled within 72 h of fever onset. The other patient
(patient 1) was negative for CRE screening before HSCT.
However, due to symptoms of persistent neutropenic
fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and significantly increased CRP (over 100 mg/L) after HSCT, the stool swab
of this patient was sent for another CRE screening,
which indicated positive CRE colonization at 3 days after
fever initiation. She was then treated with tigecycline but
ultimately died of septic shock.
During period 2, febrile episodes did not occur after positive screening in 9 patients, and antibiotics were not used.
For the other 12 colonized patients, they developed neutropenic fever, and the median time from colonization identification to fever was 9 days (1–17 days). They received
treatment with tigecycline in the initial 24 h of following
fever onset (except patients 20 received tigecycline after 48
h of fever onset) considering the emergence of neutropenic
fever, accompanying clinical signs of infection and significantly increased inflammatory biomarkers: the body temperatures of 9 patients were controlled within 72 h of fever
onset. Three patients (patients 12, 20, and 23) continued to
suffer high fever (over 38.5 °C) 48 h after tigecycline treatment and were additionally treated with polymyxin. Polymyxin was changed to ceftazidime-avibactam due to the
nephrotoxicity in patient 20. The patient 20 was diagnosed
CRE BSI 3 days after fever. The body temperatures of 3 patients returned to normal after the administration of targeted treatment. Finally, 21 colonized patients were
discharged after successful hematopoietic reconstruction.
Microbiological data
CRE strains were isolated from 11 patients in blood cultures, including strains detected in the unscreened phase
and 24 patients in stool swabs during the screening
period (the first positive result was documented for samples from the same origin), revealing 22 K. pneumoniae
and 13 E. coli. K. pneumoniae was predominant, accounting for 81.8% of CRE BSIs (9/11) and 54.2% (13/
24) of CRE colonization. One patient with CRE
colonization subsequently developed a CRE BSI, and the
resistance to antibiotics was exactly consistent between
blood culture and stool samples. The resistance rates to
antibiotics of the 35 CRE isolates are shown in Table 4.
Among the three carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem
and ertapenem), there was a slight difference in the antibiotic resistance rate of the two strains, which cannot be
ruled out for technical reasons. The resistance rates of
tigecycline and amikacin were 0 and 28.6%, respectively.
Discussion
CRE BSIs have become a major challenge and are associated with high mortality. In China, the overall annual
CRE incidence is approximately 4 per 10,000 discharges,
with the highest rates in some regions (0.15%) where
CRE is highly endemic and causes a severe disease burden [22]. Active surveillance for CRE colonization as
part of a multifactorial intervention is an effective strategy to decrease nosocomial CRE infection rate and CRErelated mortality [20, 23, 24]. CRE screening with stool
is considered an effective method for surveillance of
CRE colonization.
Before the implementation of active screening, the incidence and attributable mortality of CRE BSI in our
center were high (1.9 and 66.7%, respectively) and similar to those in previous studies. Thus, we initiated active
surveillance in HSCT recipients. During period 1, only
1.5% of patients were identified as positive for CRE, and
the 4 patients who developed CRE BSIs were negative at
the single screening. The incidence and mortality of
CRE BSIs were 2 and 50%, respectively. These results
suggested that single screening could not effectively discriminate colonized patients. Considering the poor efficiency, we started continuous weekly screening during
period 2, and a significant difference was observed with
respect to the CRE detection rate (1.5% vs 10.8%, P <
0.001). Additionally, it is worth noting that of the patients who were positive in continuous screening, only 4
were positive at the first screening, and 80.9% (17 out of
21 colonized patients) turned positive results for CRE at
the second or later screening, which again suggests the
deficiencies of single screening. Moreover, due to the increased positive rate of continuous screening and the
preemptive treatments used in these patients with infectious symptoms, the morbidity and mortality of CRE

BSIs showed a trend of reduction (only 0.5 and 0%, respectively), for which the difference was not statistically
significant, probably owing to the small sample size. Forcina et al. also demonstrated that after the introduction
of regular surveillance, the cumulative incidence in CRE
BSI and septic shock at 1 year after HSCT was significantly reduced [4]. The CRE infection mortality dropped
from 62.5 to 16.6%. These results strongly support the
key role of continuous screening in the prevention and
control of CRE BSI.
Consistent with published data, the resistance rate to
tigecycline in our study was low, at 0%, and tigecycline
was also used as the first-line antibiotic for CRE infection
in our study [2, 25, 26]. Clinical signs of infection are usually attenuated or absent in neutropenic patients, and
fever is often the only symptom of a serious potential infection. In order to manage patients colonized with CRE,
who are at high risk of developing BSIs, we conducted
contact precaution and preemptive CRE targeted treatment. Early targeted antibiotic therapy is considered vital
to cover possible infections in febrile neutropenic patients
with CRE colonization even if blood cultures remain negative [20, 27–30]. In our study, we administered preemptive
treatment with tigecycline in the initial 24 h following
fever onset to patients with CRE colonization combined
with neutropenic fever/clinical signs of infection/significant elevation of inflammatory markers, and controlled
temperature rapidly. However, 2 patients with neutropenic
fever received tigecycline later than 24 h after fever onset.
One received tigecycline 72 h since the single screening
was negative and ultimately died of septic shock. The
other subsequently developed a CRE BSI but survived due
to timely combination with polymyxin (changed later to
ceftazidime-avibactam because of the nephrotoxicity).
These results also highlight that for CRE colonized patients with febrile neutropenia and clinical signs of infection, prompt and active targeted CRE treatment
contribute to improvement of prognosis [4, 31]. For patients colonized with CRE without fever, contact precaution is necessary, while the administration of antibiotics
should be cautious and avoid abuse. In our study, patients
colonized with CRE in the absence of febrile episodes were
only isolated and observed, did not receive tigecycline
treatment and got favorable prognosis. These results also
suggest that gut CRE colonization alone is not an indication for further antibiotic treatment.
There are several limitations of this study. First,
this was a single-center, retrospective observational
study in a particular geographical area. Second, the
resistance mechanism has not been well investigated.
Finally, the cohort of patients with CRE colonization
or CRE BSIs was small. A multicenter, prospective
study is being carried out in our center to further
demonstrate the optimal surveillance methods for
CRE colonization in HSCT patients.
Conclusion
In summary, for patients who undergo HSCT, regular
continuous screening for CRE colonization is necessary
to assist in the early detection and management of CRE
colonizers, including contact precaution and prompt implementation of CRE-targeted preemptive treatment to

Availability of data and materials
The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available
from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
Neither medical nor ethical approval was required to conduct the
surveillance since it was part of the local hospital policy, patients provided
oral informed consent and all data were processed anonymously. The, noninvasive, rectal swabs were collected as part of the local hospital policy
which is considered routine care. The weekly performed surveys for the presence of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are part of the infection
control policy in our hospital. This includes contact tracing, active search in
patients with risk factors and routinely check-ups like the yearly prevalence
survey. Swabs were not specifically collected for the purposes of this
publication.
