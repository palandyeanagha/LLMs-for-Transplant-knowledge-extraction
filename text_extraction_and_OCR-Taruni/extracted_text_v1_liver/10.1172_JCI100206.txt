DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF THE MAXIMUM AND STANDARD BLOOD
UREA CLEARANCES
Investigations by Marshall and Davis (1914), Pepper and Austin
(1915), Addis and Watanabe (1916), and by Addis, Barnett, and
Shevky (1918) have shown that when the urine volume is fairly large
the rate of urea excretion is directly proportional to the blood urea
content. Expressed in other words, with abundant urine the urea
-excretion per minute equals the urea contained in a constant volume
of blood. This volume of blood in a normal adult is about 75 cc.
Austin, Stiliman, and Van Slyke (1921) demonstrated in three
normal subjects that the direct ratio between blood urea content and
urea excretion rate holds only when the urine volume is above a certain limit (about 2 cc. per minute in adults), which they called the
"augmentation limit." When the urine volume fell below the augmentation limits of the subjects studied, the urea excretion rate was
found to fall also, and on the average, in proportion to the square root
of the volume: e.g., if, blood urea remaining constant, the urine volume were diminished from 2 to 0.5 cc. per minute, the urea excretion
rate would be halved.
The conception of these authors is confirmed in this paper by observation on 7 other subjects, and- the augmentation limit in normal
adults has been found to range from 1.7 to 2.5 cc. of urine per minute.
When the urine volume output-is at any point above the augmenta-

tion limit, urea excretion proceeds at maximum speed, and the output
per minute represents the urea content of a maximum blood volume.
This blood volume, averaging in normal men about 75 cc. per minute,
we shall for convenience term the maximum blood urea clearance, or
simply the maximum clearance. It represents the volume of blood
which one minute's excretion suffices to clear of urea when the urine
volume is large enough to permit a maximum urea output. The value
of the maximum clearance, Cm, is calculated from the observed urea
concentrations of the blood and urine, B and U, and the urine volume,
V, in cubic centimeters per minute, by the formula,
Maximum clearance = Cm =
The concentration ratio,-, indicates the number of cubic centi- )B)
meters of blood the urea content of which is represented in 1 cc. of
urine. B X V therefore indicates the number of cubic centimeters
of blood represented in the urea content of the V cubic centimeters of
urine excreted in 1 minute.
Below the augmentation limit the volume of blood, the urea content
of which is represented in one minute's excretion, (the blood urea
clearance per minute) is not a constant, but varies, on the average,
in proportion to the square root of the urine volume. In order to
compare excretions below the augmentation limit, therefore, they must
either be observed with a standard, constant, urine volume output,
or, if observed with other urine volumes, the excretion rates must be
corrected for the urine volume effect. It is practically impossible to
fix the urine volume at a definite standard, but, by means of the square
root rule of Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke, the urea excretion that
would accompany such a standard urine volume can be calculated
from the excretion measured with any other volume below the augmentation limit.
The formula for the calculation is developed as follows:
If C is the observed blood urea clearance (the cubic centimeters of
blood, the urea content of which is excreted in 1 minute) with any
428

EGGERT MOLLER, J. F. McINTOSH AND D. D. VAN SLYKE 429
urine volume output, V, below the augmentation limit, then with the
standard urine volume, V8, the corresponding standard clearance,
C.,, may be calculated by the square root rule as
C,: C = VvI: Ar
or
C. = C
The standard urine volume that we have adopted is 1 cc. per minute.
This value not only simplifies calculation because it is represented by
unity: it presents itself also as a natural standard, because it is ap.
proximately the average rate of urine excretion for normal adults (1440
cc. for 24 hours; Addis (1923) found 1345 cc. as the average). Consequently the observed volumes will on the average differ less from
it than from any other volume. Substituting therefore 1 for V, we
obtain
C's= C
For convenience in calculation it is desirable to substitute in place
of the observed clearance, C, the figures directly determined by analysis, viz. the urea concentrations, U and B, in urine and blood respectively, and the urine volume, V. As shown above in connection with
the calculation of the maximum clearance, the observed clearance is

of urea excretion with haigh urine volumes. The maximum clearance is
normally about 40 per cent greater than the standard clearance, the
mean values being 75 cc. of blood per minute for the maximum and
54 cc. for the standard. Usually, though not always, in pathological
conditions both values are affected to approximately the same degree.
For use in the above formulae for calculating C. and Cm, any convenient units of urea or urea N concentration, e.g. grams per liter,
milligram per 100 cc., may be used to express the urea concentrations,
U and B so long as the same unit is used for both U and B. This
follows from the fact that in each formula U and B appear only in
U
the ratio B, so that both U and B may be multiplied by any factor
U
without changing the value of - ratio, or of the C, or Cm calculated B
therefrom.
The unit for expressing values of V, however, can not be changed
without changing the numerical values of C. and Cm.
CALCULATION OF CLEARANCE VALUES
If the urine volume exceeds 2 cc. per minute, as observed in an
adult, or as corrected for body size (see next paper) in a child, the
maximum clearance is calculated.
If the volume thus observed or corrected is less than 2 cc. per minute, the standard clearance is calculated.
It is advantageous as a rule to calculate both clearances in percentages of the mean normal C. and Cm. Urea excretions observed
with ordinary urine volumes and calculated in terms of C. are thus
rendered directly comparable with excretions observed with large
urine volumes and hence calculated in terms of Cm. Furthermore
the percentage values thus calculated express directly percentages of
average normal renal efficiency.
The percentage of average normal Cm is obtained by dividing the
absolute Cm value by the mean normal Cm, 75, and multiplying by 100.
Similarly the percentage of average normal C, is obtained by dividing
the absolute C, by 54 and multiplying by 100.

Both the absolute and percentage C.. and C, values are most readily
calculated graphically by means of a slide rule, or by means of the

used it is necessary to calculate by arithmetic only the value of the

Technique for determining the blood urea clearance as a measure of
renal efficiency. The necessary data are the concentrations of urea in
blood and urine, and the volume of urine excreted in a measured time.
The manner in which these 3 values are secured may be varied to suit
conditions. As a routine procedure, however, we have found the following satisfactory:
The subject is not subjected to any previous routine, except that
vigorous exercise is avoided and the previous meal should be a moderate one, preferably without coRee, which Addis and Drury (1923)
have found may increase the blood urea clearance. The most desirable time of day, when excretion is least liable to fluctuations, is
found according to MacKay (1928) in the hours between breakfast
and lunch. The patient remains quiet while the urine is collected
during two succeeding periods of 1 hour each. The chief source of
error is probably the possibility of incomplete emptying of the bladder,
either at the beginning or end of a period. The collection of two
urine specimens affords a check on this factor. A few minutes before
the end of the first hour a blood sample is drawn. Its urea content is
used for calculation of the clearances during both periods. This usage
is permissible, because under the conditions of the test the blood urea
does not change greatly during an hour.
The maximum clearance is calculated if the urine volume observed
1.73 in an adult, or if the corrected volume V X S .s c Sq. m. surface area

in a child, exceeds 2 cc. per minute. (See. accompanying Paper III
of this series.)
The standard clearance is calculated if the urine volume, corrected
in the case of a child, is less than 2 cc. per minute.
Physiological and pathological significance of maximum and standard
blood urea clearances. The excretion rate observed with the average
normal maximum blood urea clearance is what would be obtained if
75 cc. of blood per minute passed the kidneys, and all its urea were
excreted. Actually a larger volume of blood perfuses the kidneys,
and only' a certain fraction of its urea is removed. Picard (1856)
found that in dogs the urea content of blood from the renal vein was
half that of blood from the artery. If a similar relation held for man,
the average normal renal blood flow could be estimated at 150 cc.
per minute, 50 per cent of the urea of this blood being excreted with
large urine volumes and 35 per cent with the average urine volume
of 1 cc. per minute.
Decrease in the volume of blood cleared of urea per minute in pathological conditions must be due to one of two causes: either the volume
of blood per minute passing through the kidneys is diminished, or the
proportion of its urea removed during the passage is less than normal.
In cardiac decompensation presumably the flow factor is responsible
for lowered renal function; and in glomerular nephritis the damaged
renal vessels make diminished flow again seem certain. Whether a
decrease in the proportion of urea removed from the blood also occurs
or not, we have not at present the basis to surmise.
THE VARIABILITY OF THE BLOOD UREA CLEARANCE, AND ITS
SIGNIFICANCE
The fact that in a given individual the probable variation of the
standard blood urea clearance is i 10 per cent, and that the maximum
variation is much greater, indicates, as pointed out by Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke (1921), that other factors in addition to blood
urea concentration and urine volume affect urea excretion. Some
of these factors were studied by Addis pnd Drury (1923), who found
that the maximum clearance was increased by ingestion of a mixed
meal, milk, caffein, or glutamic acid, and decreased by pituitrin or

UREA EXCRETION
very large doses of adrenalin. The effect of adrenalin, however, was
shown in rabbits by Addis, Barnett, and Shevky (1918) to vary with
the dosage; up to a certain maxiLmum it increased urea output, but
greater amounts depressed the output. Ordinarily Addis (1917) believed that adrenalin and pituitrin act as antagonists in regulating
renal activity.
Such influences may vary the blood clearence per minute in either
of two ways. They may vary the renal blood flow without altering
the percentage of blood urea removed at each passage through the
kidneys. Or they may so influence the activity of renal cells that
variations do result in the percentage of blood urea removed at each
passage. The questions, whether and how the percentage of urea
removed from the blood in the kidneys can be influenced, awaits
experimental proof.
It is evident that the urea excretion rate is influenced by other
factors in addition to blood urea content and urine volume, and that
an erroneous imprecsion would be created by the clearance formulae
if they were assumed to express with mathematical exactness the complete effects of all factors influencing urea excretion. The width of the
range of normal variation indicates the contrary. The formulae
are only expressions of the effects of two factors, blood urea content
and urine volume, which are in continual action and appear to be
ordinarily of chief importance in regulating the urea output.
To minimize variations due to other factors Addis (1922) in determining the maximum clearance gives water and urea to the fasting
subject at the beginning of a 6 hour period, and analyzes specimens of
blood and urine collected during the last 3 hours of the period, during
which diuresis is maintained by water drinking. In determining the
standard clearance in this laboratory we have thus far set no conditions, except that the subject should be at rest and should have avoided
coffee and other obvious diuretics during the preceding hours of the
day. The limits of variation in our results, reported below, apply to
these conditions. It appears possible that by standardizing conditions more completely the range of variation could be narrowed.

THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF UREA EXt¶ETION TESTS OF RENAL
FUNCTION IN NEPHRITIS
. That the relatively simple conceptions of the maximum and standard blood urea clearances outlined in the preceding pages are logical
developments of a long course of observation, experiment, and study
by many investigators is indicated by the following historical
slummary.
In 1827 Bright first described the disease which has been called after him.
The year after, 1828, Wohler performed the synthesis of urea. This was the first
time any organic substance had been synthesized in vitro.
The coincidence of these two scientific events at once created an interest in urea
excretion in Bright's disease. Christison (1829) found the serum urea content
increased in 3 patients out of 6, and further observed, that in these 3 cases the rate
of urea excretion was slower than in the 3 others. Bright (1836) found a serum
urea concentration of as much as 1500 mgm. per cent in a case of uremia. He
noted that the concentrations of urea in the serum and in the urine of this patient
were the same, and that while the former was increased, the latter was only about
one-third of the ordinary normal value. These findings were soon confirmed by
other authors, and in 1851 Frerichs, in his monograph, stated that while in acute
cases of Bright's disease urine urea concentration and urea output were both
normal, in chronic cases both were lower than in normal subjects on the same diet.
In such cases he believed that the determination of the urea concentration of the
urine could be of diagnostic value. A few years later diagnostic use of the blood
urea concentration was recommended by Picard (1856).
During the second half of the nineteenth century the investigation of Bright's
disease was chiefly concerned with the morphological and circulatory changes.
The few isolated comments upon the usefulness of the determination of urine urea
concentration (Green, 1885) or excretion rate (Cruise, 1890; Guyon, 1892) were
only exceptions to the general rule.
In about 1900 interest turned to the functional aspect of disease, and the study
of urea excretion was resumed. The point of view, however, was now different.
Determination of the blood urea content and the urea excretion rate were carried
out (separately or combined) not only for purposes of qualitative diagnosis, but
in order to furnish quantitative information about the degree of functional impairment of the kidneys. The unrelated measurement of excretion rate or of urea
concentration in urine was soon found to be unsatisfactory for this purpose. The
reason was that both these factors are too dependent on the rate of protein catabolism and the urine volume, The influence of protein catabolism was fully recognized at the time, but that of urine volume was not.
Achard and Paisseau (1904) brought patients into nitrogen equilibrium and then
added to the diet 20 grams of urea daily for some days. They measured the urea
THE JOURNAL Or cLINICAL INVESTIGATION, VOL. VI, NO. 3

UREA EXCRETION
output per 24 hours, and noted the rapidity with which the superimposed amount
of nitrogen was excreted. The procedure was, however, laborious, the results
not very consistent. The method was abandoned, to be revived occasionally by
later authors.
Other authors turned their attention to the blood urea, and neglected the excretion. The determination of blood urea was introduced into clinical medicine by
Strauss (1902) and by Widal and Javal (1904). For diagnostic purposes determination of blood urea concentration has an advantage over determination of
urine concentration, in that with ordinary urine volumes the blood figure is less
dependent on fluctuations of water output. Other factors being constant, however, the blood urea content is proportional to the rate of protein catabolism. If
a given subject breaks down into urea half as much protein daily his average
blood urea will be half as high, given a constant urine volume. If the urine
volume increases within the ordinary range (below the augmentation limit), the
blood urea will be further diminished, increased water output washing out more
urea from the blood. Both of these factors are likely to be operative in nephritis
to prevent a rise in blood urea proportional to renal destruction. MacKay and
MacKay (1927) in fact report data (which our own confirm) showing that many
nephritics do not show blood ureas definitely above the normal maximum until
more than 60 per cent of renal function has been lost.
The conception of comparing simultaneous urea determinations in blood
and urine was introduced by Gr6hant (1904) who used the concentration ratio -
B
as an expression of renal functional ability. However, the immense effects of
urine volume changes on the urea concentration, U, in urine were not considered,
in consequence of which even approximate constancy can not be obtained with
this ratio. The use of the B ratio was revived by Harrison (1922), who empha- B
sized that the most consistent results were gained when the urine volumes were
below 150 to 100 cc. per hour. This restriction reduces the inconsistencies introduced into the B ratio by urine volume changes, but also limits the conditions
under which observations can be made.
Ambard and Weill (1912) were the first to include both urea output and urine
volume in attempting quantitatively to relate urea excretion to blood content.
They found that urea excretion in normal subjects, and also in nephritics, was
governed by two laws, relating output to blood and urine concentrations respectively. These laws were combined into the urea excretion formula of Ambard
and Weill (1912), which, with numerical constants omitted, is:
B
K =
438

EGGERT MOLLER, J. F. McINTOSH AND D. D. VAN SLYKE 439
B and U represent, as above, concentration of urea in urine and blood, and D
indicates rate of urea excretion (debit). Since D = U X V, Ambard's formula
can be written
B
K ul Vi
For the sake of comparison with our standard clearance formula we take the
reciprocal, and have
1 U4
K B
In this form the similarity can readily be seen of Ambard's formula with our
present formula, C. = B v<V, for calculating standard blood clearance. Although
the influence of urine volume was not directly investigated by the French authors,
a correction for urine volume is nevertheless contained in their formula and is
brought out through its transcription as above. The volume factor VTV is valid,
however, only for ordinary urine volumes of less than 2 cc. per minute. Above
this point the volume factor should be V, and for higher urine volumes the Ambard
formula becomes increasingly more inaccurate. The use of U in the 3th power
instead of in the first appears, in the light of present results, to be a complication
diminishing rather than enhancing the accuracy of the formula. The introduction
of the Ambard formula was, however, an important advance in estimating the
effect of urine volume on urea excretion.
F. C. McLean (1915) put the Ambard formula into a more convenient form
by squaring and inverting it, and adding a numerical constant, which made 100
the average normal value of this "urea secretory index."
Addis and Watanabe (1916) found a wide range of variation in results calculated
from normal subjects by Ambard and Weill's formula, and presented data indicating the degree of inaccuracy of the two basic assumptions. Addis believed the

urea excretion ratio, - = Lbinendtofunevl B urea in 100 cc. blood' t b vol
ume (1917), and recommended its determination under certain standard conditions
(1922) as a test of kidney function. These standard conditions will, except in
rare pathological conditions, keep the urine volume well above the augmentation
limit, and cause
D
to represent the maximum blood clearance.
B
The existence of the augmentation limit was first recognized by Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke (1921) who showed, first, that Addis' urea excretion ratio is
independent of urine volume only when this is above the augmentation limit of
about 2 cc. per minute, and, second, that with urine volumes below this point the
excretion rate varies most nearly in proportion to the square root of the volume.

UREA EXCRETION
In the present paper we confirm these results on normal subjects, and in an accompanying paper we show that they hold true for nephritics also.
H. MacLean and de Wesselow (1919, 1920) in the interest of simplicity reverted
to a single determination, the urea concentration in the urine, as a test of renal
function. These authors prescribed certain standard conditions for its determination, designed to make the values more consistent. They gave 15 grams of urea
with 100 cc. of water, and noted whether or not the urine urea concentration in the
2 subsequent hours rose above 2 per cent. If it did, they considered the kidneys
fairly efficient. Gross errors due to dilute urines were excluded by rejecting tests
in which the second hour's urine volume exceeded 150 cc. Their procedure was
admirably adapted to its.primary purpose, the rapid examination of large numbers
of soldiers. In the study of nephritic patients, however, the method invites
error by neglect of the blood urea. For example, if urinary function is so low that
only a tenth the normal blood volume is cleared of urea per hour, the urea output
will nevertheless be normal if the blood urea concentration is ten-fold the ordinary.
Hence the urinary concentration will also be normal, if the volume is not increased.
For this reason, in the terminal stages of nephritis, with high blood urea content,
a urinary urea concentration within ordinary normal ranges may be observed,
despite tremendously\ reduced renal ability.2 The interpretation of figures for
urea concentration in urine is therefore uncertain, unless the blood urea content is
known, as well as the urine volume.
The historical sequence in which the different urea determinations
were introduced as indicators of renal function, and the conditions
under which they were best applicable, are summarized in table 1.
Numerical relation of the present standard clearance to previously used
forms of the Austin-Stillman-Van Slyke formula. The formula - N B
expresses the number of cubic centimeters of blood of which the urea
content is concentrated into 1 cc. of urine, when urine excretion is at
the average normal rate of 1 cc. per minute. The mean normal
numerical value of 54 indicates that under these conditions the kidneys
concentrate the blood urea 54-fold. The standard clearance thus
may be interpreted as a measure of the concentrating power, as well as
the excreting ability, of the kidney. For this reason the value now
called the standard dearance has, in a number of papers from this
laboratory (e.g. Hiller, McIntosh, and Van Slyke (1927)) been called
the "concentration index." The term "standard clearance" is at pres2 "Selbst die prozentige Ausscheidung des N kann noch relativ gut erscheinen,
ja 1 per cent betragen, wenn bereit die todliche Vergiftung begonnen hat" (p.
166 of Volhard and Fahr, 1914).

under which the two respective urea excretion rates are determined.
In the above papers the formula used in calculating the "index" was B W
instead of B WVi. However, in the - ratio used the volume unit was cubic

centimeters per hour per kilogram, which, for a person of 60 kgm. weight, is the
same as cubic centimeters per minute. Hence the values of B I/W in the above
papers are approximately interchangeable with those of the present C. =

the fact that unusually low or high body weights influence the value - only
in proportion to their square roots, and not their first powers, diminishes the effect
on the calculated clearance. E.g., a person of 50 kgm. would weigh 17 per cent
less than one of 60; but the effect of this weight difference on the value of the

paper, is to correct for wide divergence from average size by multiplying V by

authors differed from the present clearance, and from the above discussed concenV

kilogram, was used. A given excretion rate expressed in cubic centimeters per
minrute is represented by a figure 1 , or 0.694 W, times as large as that ex1440

pressing the same rate in terms of liters per-24 hours per kilogram. The average
weight of the 4 men studied by Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke was 72 kgm.
If we substitute this for W in the factor 0.694 W, we find that a given excretion
expressed in the terms of the above authors is to be multiplied by exactly 50 to
correct it into cubic centimeters per minute. In order to convert the .average
value of the excretion constant obtained by Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke into
terms of the present standard clearance, the former value is consequently to be
multipliqd by 0, or 7.13. Their average normal constant of 7.5 therefore corresponds to a standard clearance of 53.6 cc. of blood per minute, which is nearly
identical with the value calculated from the additional data yielded by other
normal adults in this paper.
Numerical relationship of the present maximum clearance to the excretion ratio of Addis. The excretion ratio of Addis,
urea in 1 hour's urine
urea in 100 cc. blood'
indicates the number of cubic centimeters of blood, the urea con- 100
tent of which is represented by 1 hour's secretion. The excretion
ratio is determined by Addis under conditions of large urine volumes,
so that the value represents maximum clearance. A normal hourly
excretion equivalent to the urea content of 5000 cc. of blood corresponds
to an Addis ratio of 50, which was found by him (1922) to be the average normal value. Our maximum clearance, expresses - the cubic 60
centimeters of blood, of which the urea content is represented by 1
hour's excretion. The Addis ratio is therefore converted into maximum clearance values, of cubic centimeters of blood cleared of urea per
100
minute, by multiplying the Addis ratio by 60 or 1.67. The mean
normal value of his ratio, found by Addis to be about 50 in young
men, corresponds therefore to a per minute maximum blood clearance
of about 1.67 X 50 = 83 cc., which does not differ greatly from the
average of 75 cc. found in our normal subjects.
THE CORRELATION BETWEEN URINE VOLUME AND UREA EXCRETION
The influence on urea output of urine volume changes below the
augmentation limit, observed by Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke, has

44UREAEXCRETION
been questioned by Addis and his collaborators. Addis and Drury
(1923) studied the relationship between V and the excretion ratio
(or blood urea clearance). They found that in rabbits changes in
volume down to 2 cc. per hour had no influence on the observed clearance, BU Of the 3 human subjects studied, however, only one was
observed with urine volumes below 120 cc. per hour, which is the usual
augmentation limit according to our data. In this subject they
found the blood clearance somewhat lower with urine volumes below
50 cc. per hour than with volumes above 64 cc. per hour. Since no
regular quantitative relationship between excretion and urine volume
was demonstrable from their data, however, these authors concluded
that the increase in urea excretion with increase in urine volume, observed over the lower Volume ranges by themselves and by Austin,
Stiliman, and Van Slyke, was due merely to the fact that certain factors stimulated both water and urea excretion: the excretion rates of
these two substances Addis and Drury conceived to be independent
of each other.
As opinions still are divided we have considered it desirable to increase the number of observations covering the influence of urine
volume on urea excretion in normal subjects. We have attempted to
limit the factors influencing excretion as nearly as practicable to one,
water. In some of the experiments data were also obtained on the
effect of urea ingestion, which, however, was not observed to affect
significantly the clearance values obtained.
EXPERDIENTAL
We have examined 5 normal persons between 20 and 30 years of age,
all in good health and without any history of kidney disease. We also
have reexamined another normal subject, now 44 years of age, (Van
Slyke), on whom data were first published by Austin, Stiliman, and
Van Slyke, six years ago.
During each experiment (except those on Van Slyke) the person examined was
kept in bed. The reasons for this were, first, that changes of position are said to
influence the water excretion through the kidneys (White, Rosen, Fischer and
Wood (1926)) and, second, that the kidney function of patients is nearly always
emined while they are in bed, so it seems more correct to compare them with
normals studied under similar conditions.

In some of the experiments urea was taken between 6 and 8 a.m.
The test began at 9 a.m. and went on for from one to seven hours. During this
time the subject voided at the end of each hour, and a sample of blood (usually
0.2 cc. from the ear lobe) was drawn 10 minutes before the middle of each 1-hour
period. The intention was to obtain a blood urea figure representing as nearly as
possible the average value during the hour when the urine was formed. The urine
takes a certain time to flow from the renal tubules to the bladder. The error
which is due to this factor is lessened when the blood is taken somewhat before the
middle of the collection period.
At about 8 a.m. the subjects were allowed to take bread, butter and jam. At
noon bread, butter, jam, fruit and vegetables were given. Addis and Drury (1923)
found that ingestion of milk or coffee accelerated urea excretion appreciably;
consequently we have avoided giving them during an experiment. Addis and
Drury found moderate sugar ingestion to be without effect. We have not observed any significant effect of the above, chiefly carbohydrate, meals on the urea
excretion rate in our subjects.
The variations in urine volume were obtained by controlling the water intake.
Each patient was examined on 2 or more days. When minimal urine volumes were
desired no fluids were given from the previous evening till noon or later. High
volumes were obtained by giving water freely hour by hour, either from early morning or in the afternoon following a period of desiccation. No other factors were
varied, except on occasions when urea was given. As will be seen, the urea was
without discernible influence on the clearance values. The variations obtained in
the blood clearances with varying urine volumes may, we believe, be attributed to
the variations in water regime.
Our attention has been particularly directed to the possibility of
such changes in blood clearance occurring, during sudden increases or
decreases of water output, as were found in dogs under certain conditions by Bourquin and Laughton (1925). These authors observed
exceedingly high clearances during the onset of diuresis and a period
of depressed clearances when diuresis subsided and during more or less
of the postdiuretic period. It will be seen from table 1, that although
sudden changes in urine volume occurred in several of our experiments,
no changes in clearance of the kind described by Bourquin and Laughton are found in our data on human subjects.
The concentrations of urea in the urine and in most of the blood samples were estimated by the gasometric urease method of Van Slyke
(1927). Most of the blood analyses were performed on 0.200 cc.
samples by the micro-technique. In experiments numbers A 7 to
A 11, however, the blood was drawn by venous puncture, and the

UREA EXCRETION
urea concentration was estimated on samples of 3 cc. with the aeration
urease method of Van Slyke and Cullen (1914).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The conditions and results of all our experiments are given in tables
1 to 4.
The results for each of the 6 subjects investigated by us, and for one
other from the literature (Rehberg, 1926), have been plotted in figures
3 to 9 with clearance values as ordinates and v"- as abscissae. In
order to simplify the plotting by obtaining straight line curves we have
laid off as abscissae values of the square root of the urine volume. According to the square root rule, this procedure should enable one to
express the relationship between urine volume and blood clearance as
a rising straight line below the augmentation limit; and it will be seen
in the graphs that such is the case. Above the augmentation limit
volume has no effect, and the excretion curve becomes a horizontal
line.
The curves have been drawn in the following manner. The mean
UV value of the clearance B, in cubic centimeters of blood containing
the amount of urea excreted per minute, for all points above the augmentation limit is taken, and at the corresponding height above the
horizontal axis, and parallel to it, a line is drawn. Then for all
points to the left of the augmentation limit the standard clearance
U_
VvV is calculated, and the mean value is taken. This average
determines the height of the curve at V = 1 cc. Through the corresponding point on the vertical line representing V = 1 cc., and
through the zero point, a straight line is drawn. The position of the
augmentation limit is calculated as the intersection point between this
slanting line and the horizontal line first drawn.
In this way we have calculated augmentation limits from the data
given by Austin, Stiliman, and Van Slyke on Austin and Van Slyke
our own data on six normal subjects, and finally the data given by
Rehberg (1926) on himself, that were collected by him for quite other
reasons, but can be used for our purpose as well.

UREA EXCRETION
The results of these calculations are given in table 4.
In addition to the above experiments, in which the complete excretion curves were obtained over the maximum urine volume range,
observations with ordinary urine volumes, below the augmentation
limit, were made on 9 other normal subjects, and are reported, with the
resulting standard clearance values, in table 3. The subjects were
young men engaged in such activity as involves ordinary laboratory
work.
The augmentation limit. It is seen from table 4, that the %ugmentation limit in the 8 normal subjects observed occurs at between 1.67
and 2.55 cc. per minute, if the observation made on Van Slyke in 1921
is excluded. The higher augmentation limit in this case, due to a very
high average maximum clearance, falls statistically outside the group,
since it differs by more than four times the mean error3 from the average. There were only 4 determinations with high urine volumes in
this case (data of Austin, Stilhman, and Van Slyke) and they were
made while the subject was about the laboratory, and not under the
conditons of rest imposed on the subjects used for the analyses reported n this paper. Accordingly additional experiments on the
same subject have been performed with the present series of observations, during which the subject was sitting quietly at his desk. The
augmentation limit and clearances thus obtained fall within the limits
of the rest of our observations. In the calculation of the average augmentation limit and maximum clearance, and the variation for the
group of normal subjects, given in tables 3 and 4, only the present
figures are used for this subject.
NORMAL VALUES AND VARIATIONS OF THE STANDARD AND MAXIMUM
BLOOD UREA CLEARANCES
In table 4 are summarized the mean standard clearances of the
normal subjects reported in detail in tables 2 and 3, and in addition
the standard clearances calculated from previous data of Austin,
Stillman and Van Slyke (1921). Similarly in table 5 are summarized
a The mean error calculated as the standard deviation, i,divided
by the square root of the number of observations (fig. 9).
454

EGGERT MOLLER, J. F. McINTOSH AND D. D. VAN SLYKE 455
the maximum clearances of the sanie subjects, and in addition those
on the 13 normal subjects reported by Addis (1922) with 4 or more
observations on each.
For each subject, in tables 4 and 5, on whom 4 or more C. or Cm
values are available, the probable deviation of a given determination
from the average in each subject, and of the mean value of each subject from the mean of all 9 subjects, have been calculated by the
formula 0.675 i 1 where 2 d2 represents the sum of the squares
of the deviations of individual determinations from the mean, and n
represents the number of determinations. According to the theory of
statistics, if the probable deviation is correctly determined half the
results obtained are likely to show less deviation while half of them
show greater deviations. Our number of determinations, n, is in fact
too small in each individual to permit a really accurate estimate of the
probable deviation of the standard or maximum clearance in his case;
and likewise the number of subjects is too small to permit an accurate
estimate of the probable individual deviation from the mean of the
group. However, the data given, comprising 120 standard clearance
determinations on 18 normal subjects and 158 maximum clearances on
20 normal subjects, appear sufficient, taken together, to yield an approximate idea of the degree of constancy to be expected in the standard and maximum clearance values in a normal individual, and of the
range of these values in different normal subjects.
The "percentage probable deviation" values in tables 4 and 5 indicate that the variability among different determinations on a given
subject is somewhat less for the maxmum clearance than for the standard clearance. This is perhaps what could be expected, since with
the smaller urine volumes, with which the standard clearance is determined, failure to empty the bladder completely must be of greater
importance. We do not believe, however, that the data are sufficiently numerous to justify any comparative conclusions save that both
clearances show variations of the same general order of magnitude.
The maximum clearance values calculated from Addis' 13 subjects
average 82 cc. of blood cleared of urea per minute, while the values
calculated from our 7 subjects and Rehberg average 75 cc. It appears

possible that the difference may be due partly to greater body size in
Addis' subjects. He employs 1.82 square meters as the mean surface
area (private communication through MacKay), and if the subjects

urine volume, while above it the clearance is independant of urine
volume. The grouping of points about the slanting portion of the
curve indicates that the square-root rule which this portion represents
expresses the average effect of urine volume changes. No other line
or curve could follow the experimental points more closely. The
deviations of the points are frequently considerable, since other, unknown factors, besides urine volume influence the rate of urea excretion (Addis and Drury, 1923). It is obvious, however, that the

SUBJECTS

For the increase in urea excretion rate which accompanies increase
in water excretion rate up to the augmentation limit two hypothetical
explanations may be offered.

UREA EXCRETION
1. Increase in urine volume diminishes the amount of work the
kidney has to do against osmotic pressure in compressing each gram of
urea from the volume it occupies in the blood to the smaller volume it
occupies in the urine. Less work is required to compress the urea of
100 cc. of blood into 2 cc. of urine than to compress it further into 1
cc. of urine. The kidneys, because they work more easily with
increased urine volume, may work faster, and excrete more urea per
minute. From this view point, the increase in urea excretion rate
which accompanies accelerated water output is a direct cause of the
latter. (For quantitative calculation according to the laws of thermodynamics of the mechanical work done by the kidney per gram
molecule of substance excreted see pages 93 to 96 of Barcroft (1914)).
2. The other hypothesis is that increase of renal circulation, or
stimulus of the secretory activity of the renal cells, may accelerate
excretion of both urea and water. The accelerated water output in
this case would not be the cause of the accelerated urea output. Both
would be due to a common stimulus acting on the kidney. Even dilution of the blood by water drinking might be such a cause, either inducing larger proportions of renal capillaries to open up (vide Richards
(1920-21)) or, making the secretory cells become more active.
For the purpose of estimating from urea excretion the work which
the kidneys will do under standard conditions it is, however, a matter
of indifference whether the acceleration of urea output that comes
with increased urine volume is caused by the latter, or merely accompanies it as the result of a renal stimulus that affects both. Whether,
in introducing vi_ as a factor in the standard blood urea clearance
calculation, we are dealing with the direct cause of fluctuations of
clearance with urine volume, or are using urine volume as a fairly
consistent indicator of such cause, does not greatly matter when we
are concerned merely with measurement of renal ability.
SUMMARY
1. The relationship between urine volume and urea excretion has
been studied in 6 more normal adults.
2. The observations of Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke have been
confirmed, that with urine volumes below a certain point (the augmentation limit) the urea output increases in direct proportion to the
462

EGGERT MOLLER, J. F. McINTOSH AND D. D. VAN SLYKE 463
square root of the urine volume, and that when the urine volume
reaches this limit urea excretion attains its maximum, unaffected by
further increase in urine volume.
3. The augmentation limit has been calculated for 8 normal subjects
(our 6 and 2 others on whom the necessary data are found in the literature). It has been found to average 2.13 cc. of urine per minute, with
a probable deviation of -0.24 cc.
4. When the urine volume exceeded the augmentation limit, the
urea excretion was found to equal the urea content of a volume of
blood which was constant for an individual within a probable variation
of 4:6 per cent. This volume of blood, which a minute's excretion
with urine volumes above the augmentation limit suffices to clear of
urea, is termed the "maximurn clearance." Data from this and Addis'
laboratory on 20 normal adults show mean maximum clearances
ranging from 64 to 99 cc. of blood per minute. For the person of
average adult size (surface area = 1.73 square meters) the meanmaximum clearance is about 75 cc. of blood per minute.
5. When the urine output was below the augmentation limit the
square root formula of Austin, Stillman, and Van Slyke was used to
estimate the urea that would be excreted with a urine volume of 1 cc.
per minute, which is approximately the average output of a normal
adult under ordinary conditions. The volume of blood, which 1 cc. of
urine exereted in 1 minute suffices to clear of urea, is termed the
"standard clearance," since it is estimated for a standard urine volume output. The standard clearance was found to be constant for an
individual within a probable variation of i10 per cent. In 18 different normal adults the mean standard clearance varied from 40 to 68
cc. of blood per minute. Estimated per 1.73 square meters of surface
area, the range was 41 to 65 cc., with a mean of 54 cc.
6. Line charts (figures 1 and 2) are given for graphic estimation of
the maximum and standard blood urea clearances, and for comparison
of the results on a percentage basis with the mean normal values.
