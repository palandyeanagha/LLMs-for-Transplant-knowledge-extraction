Challenges of Change: A Qualitative Study 
of Chronic Care Model Implementation
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE The Chronic Care Model (CCM) provides a conceptual framework for 
transforming health care for patients with chronic conditions; however, little is 
known about how to best design and implement its specifi cs. One large health 
care organization that tried to implement the CCM in primary care provided an 
opportunity to study these issues. 
METHODS We conducted a qualitative, comparative case study of 5 of 18 group 
clinics 18 to 23 months after the implementation began. Built on knowledge 
of the clinics from a previous study of advanced access implementation, data 
included in-depth interviews with organizational leaders and varied clinic personnel, observation of clinic care processes, and review of written materials.
RESULTS Relatively small and highly variable care process changes were made 
during the study period. The change process underwent several marked shifts in 
strategy when initial efforts failed to achieve much and bore little resemblance 
to the change process used in the previously successful large-scale implementation of advanced access scheduling. Many barriers were identifi ed, including too 
many competing priorities, a lack of specifi city and agreement about the care 
process changes desired, and little engagement of physicians. 
CONCLUSION These fi ndings highlight specifi c organizational challenges with 
health care transformation in the absence of a blueprint more specifi c than 
the CCM. Effective models of organizational change and detailed examples of 
proven, feasible care changes still need to be demonstrated if we are to transform care as called for by the Institute of Medicine.

INTRODUCTION
P
roviding optimal health care for persons with chronic conditions 
is a major concern in the United States. The Institute of Medicine 
(IOM) reports that the care delivered is frequently not the care that 
patients should receive given current medical knowledge.1
 The IOM has 
called on health care organizations to “design and implement more effective organizational support processes to make change in the delivery of 
care possible.”1 The same themes have been called for by the Future of Primary Care conference and the Future of Family Medicine project.2,3
In line with these recommendations, the Chronic Care Model (CCM) 
conceptualizes care as prepared practice teams in productive interactions 
with informed, activated patients (Figure 1). Six elements appear important 
for this end: the (1) overall health care organization, which must support a (2) redesigned delivery system and (3) modern clinical information 
systems; (4) systematic decision support; (5) self-management support for 
patients; and (6) links to available community resources.4,5
Multidisciplinary practice teams are key to the CCM, but they require 
substantial redesign and reorientation from the existing care roles and 
processes that are oriented toward acute care. Successful teams are created

CHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
through formulating multifaceted goals and related 
measurable outcomes, systematizing routine tasks of 
care, making member tasks and roles explicit, providing appropriate training, and substituting nonphysician 
for physician tasks when appropriate.6
Though the CCM is well developed as a conceptual framework, there are no specifi c steps, methods, 
or existing models to guide medical groups wanting to 
implement it. Groups must fi gure out what the parts 
look like and how to make them come together as a 
whole. This challenge was encountered by a large multispecialty group in Minneapolis-St. Paul when in 2001 
it chose to make CCM implementation in primary care 
a cornerstone of its care improvement efforts. 
The purpose of this article is to describe this medical group’s effort to address the challenge of implementing a CCM-type change so that others might 
learn from its experience. Our study, designed to 
evaluate both the care system changes addressed and 
the change process used to implement them, focused 
on the following questions:
1. Which CCM components were being addressed, 
and how well were they implemented?
2. What change process strategies were used, both 
centrally and at individual clinic sites?
3. What important facilitators or barriers were 
encountered?
4. What generalizable lessons and recommendations can be drawn from this experience?
METHODS
Preintervention Context
This 600-physician multispecialty group was described 
in the preceding companion article.7 The group overall 
was led by a medical director and senior administrator, 
supported by a council of medical and administrative 
leaders. It had successfully achieved a major care transformation in implementing an advanced access patientscheduling system throughout these clinics in 2000.8
The group also has had certain CCM elements in place 
for some time, particularly guidelines, patient education, chronic disease registries, and standing orders for 
preventive services. 
Before instituting advanced access scheduling, the 
medical group was relatively decentralized in its functioning, and individual clinics, as well as individual 
physicians, worked with relative autonomy. Clinics 
had little systematization of care and few designated 
leadership roles. The advanced access change process 
led to strengthened central and clinic leadership, plus 
more centralization of authority and lessened clinic 
and physician autonomy.8
The Intervention
Organizational leaders chose more complete implementation of the CCM as a major priority for 2002, 
and later impetus was stimulated by a grant award from 
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Institute 
for Healthcare Improvement intended to spur care 
transformation. A project leader and various 
multidisciplinary design teams were created 
to guide the effort, with particular focus on 
access, diabetes care, and depression care. 
The design teams developed a plan for more 
systematic care processes, and individual 
pilot care teams were designated in several 
different clinics to test the implementation. 
Once the new care processes had been tried 
for a time, efforts were made to spread the 
approach from the pilot teams to their entire 
clinics, but any care changes were largely 
limited by existing care patterns. Simultaneously, an electronic medical record (EMR) 
information system was rolled out in stages, 
along with improvements in decision support 
and self-management support. 
By mid-2002 the change strategy shifted 
from a condition-specifi c to a condition-neutral focus that would apply across chronic 
conditions, and from pilot teams to 2 small 
primary care clinics as research and development sites. A 2-day intensive design process 
developed new patient care fl ows by conceptualizing a 4-stage offi ce visit process:

CHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
previsit, visit, postvisit, and between visits. Prepared 
practice teams (PPTs) were made up of a clinician and 
rooming nurse and were supplemented by a registered 
nurse and a receptionist who were shared among 3 
contiguous PPTs. Although this core PPT was understood as having an expanded version that included 
other clinicians, implementation work focused largely 
on the core team. 
In April 2003, concerned about the slow pace of 
change in these sites, medical group leaders expanded 
this PPT and care fl ow concept throughout all the primary care clinics. They brought teams from all clinics 
together for a 1-day collaborative meeting to explain 
PPT roles and tasks. Though the overall change model 
was still conceived in condition-neutral terms, clinics 
were asked to select diabetes care, depression care, or 
preventive services as a focus for change measurement. 
During later sessions at each clinic, more-detailed 
templates of suggested PPT roles and tasks were promoted. Most ideas were for face-to-face work, although 
clinics that were further along in EMR implementation 
and skills were beginning to think in terms of virtual 
teamwork as well. 
In sum, the CCM implementation effort relied 
on medical group leaders to specify change aims and 
strategies, the details of which changed several times 
from 2002 to 2004. The change process began by 
focusing pilot work on a few clinics and then shifted to 
involve all clinics. It included expert design teams, rapid 
design processes, shared learning, and implementation 
planning by clinics in 3 multiclinic 1-day collaborative 
meetings; each clinic was expected to undertake its 
own approach to implementation. Clinic work was supported by 3 facilitators, some communication by e-mail 
and telephone, and monthly progress reports to project 
leaders. Consultants from the Institute for Healthcare 
Improvement provided input and external evaluation. 
Evaluation Approach 
This study of the above change effort was designed 
to build on knowledge acquired through a previous 
qualitative evaluation of this group’s successful implementation of advanced access, and we used extensive 
interviews and observations at both central leader and 
clinic levels.8 We purposefully sampled 5 clinics from 
the original 18 for a diverse range of size, location, 
diabetes care performance, and medical group leaders’ assessment of their preliminary CCM efforts. In 
particular, we looked for some clinics that would better exemplify change barriers, as well as for those that 
would better exemplify change facilitators. 
One author (MH) conducted 45 semistructured 
interviews with organizational leaders, external and 
internal change leaders, midlevel clinic managers, medical and administrative clinic leaders, front-line physicians, and nurses (53 persons). Questions focused on 
actual care changes, the change processes used, and 
perceived change facilitators and barriers. Descriptive 
fi eld notes of observed work in patient care areas, with 
special attention to PPT activities, helped in triangulating interview fi ndings.9
 Institutional Review Board 
approval was obtained. The interviews and observations 
were conducted during a 5-month period, beginning 
18 months into the overall CCM implementation and 6 
months after systematic PPT work started in the clinics. 
All interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed, and 
combined with typed observation notes for review by 
the fi rst 5 coauthors. Immersion-crystallization and 
iterative consensus processes were used to develop the 
analysis and interpretation.10,11 We sought disconfi rming

evidence in the data during the course of analysis discussions. Informant recall bias could not be measured specifically but was dealt with through triangulating multiple 
informant interviews, existing organizational documents, 
and the perspectives of 2 team members who were also 
organizational and change leaders (LIS, JSH). 
We rated the level of CCM implementation at each 
clinic using a categorization developed by RAND.12
We looked at the highest level of CCM activity 
within each clinic, whether it was done generally or 
focused on a specifi c condition (typically diabetes 
care or depression care), and scored the presence of 
components for each CCM element according to a 
3-point scale (Table 2, and Supplemental Table, available at: http://www.annfammed.org/cgi/content/
full/4/ 317/DC1). For example, for the clinic with 
only 1 offi cially designated pilot PPT, we scored 
that team’s activity rather than trying to contrive an 
average score across nonexistent or minimally existent 
teams. Thus, this scoring tended to overestimate the 
extent of CCM implementation. 
RESULTS
Care Process Changes 
A number of similarities were evident across the 5 clinics studied. All showed at least some evidence of PPT 
development with a new sense of team identity and 
teamwork. The roles of registered nurses now included 
varying amounts of team and patient care management. 
Focused attention was being given to previsit planning, 
including systematically reviewing and collating test 
results, identifying preventive and other clinical services needed, comparing care with established guidelines, and providing alerts for items needing attention 
at the visit. At some clinics, subgroups of patients were 
called to come in for previsit laboratory work. 
Despite these similarities, the differences among 
and within clinics were pronounced. For example, 
PPT structure and function varied widely. The centrally recommended design of 4 core PPT members 
had been adopted by 3 of the 5 clinics. Another clinic 
added a fi fth team member from the chartroom staff, 
and still another clinic designated all geographically 
adjacent personnel as a PPT (10 to 12 members). Clinics and teams differed in their team leadership, and few 
involved the clinician more than peripherally. Team 
function across and within clinic sites seemed to be 
more dependent on individual personalities than on 
systematically planned and similar team roles.
Regardless of the specifi c membership, fi nding team 
meeting times was a universal logistic challenge, because 
work schedules varied, clinic staffi ng was lean, and many 
found it diffi cult to take time from more routine patient 
care responsibilities. Although all PPTs were doing some 
previsit planning, there was little standardization of care 
across PPTs or clinics. Registered nurse and clerical roles 
changed the most, with registered nurses often becoming de facto PPT leaders and doing some care management. Clerical assistants in some clinics helped with 
calling patients to come in for previsit laboratory work, 
and in most clinics at least part of their work was in 
physical proximity to the registered nurses and licensed 
practical nurses, in contrast to previous physical separation. The licensed practical nurses working in tandem 
with physicians showed fewer role changes. 
Nonphysician staff commonly expressed appreciation for the newfound teamwork and the opportunity 
to be more involved in patient care. 
“This clinic is awesome, and what they’ve done is 
incredible. Everything just feels and fl ows so much better. You notice that things are much smoother. There 
isn’t a lot of that chaotic sort of running around. Not 
that they’re not busy—they are incredibly busy here.

it just feels much more effi cient than I think how we 
operated even 5 years ago. So it’s a good place. What’s 
made the difference is the teamwork” (Supervisor, 
clinic 3: interview 1). 
“It was clear to me that there was a very different 
energy in this group compared to my visit 2 years ago 
for the advanced access evaluation. Then, I remember 
a sense of strain about the struggles of the changes 
that had already taken place and anticipation of major 
struggles around changes yet to come. The sense this 
time was that those changes had been successfully 
negotiated, and that there was a certain comfort about 
the workings of things. I also sensed that this leadership team seemed very comfortable and at ease with 
each other” (Interviewer’s notes, clinic 3).
On the other hand, clinic leaders, especially in the 
smaller clinics, expressed concern that slim staffi ng 
margins and infl exible job descriptions limited their 
ability to innovate work roles. 
Among the clinic similarities, the most striking 
was that physician roles were generally unchanged. 
Although certain physicians were actively involved 
with the changes either as named or as de facto leaders, by and large, change happened around the physicians and did not depend on their participation or 
engage them in a meaningful way. At least in part, this 
lack of engagement appeared related to the tradition 
and organizational history of physician autonomy. 
Physician opinions about the value of previsit planning also varied. Some believed that PPT previsit work 
enabled them to make therapeutic moves with patients 
more quickly and easily (eg, intensifying diabetes 
medications). 
“The visits are easier because you have the information that you need, and you can do a lot more with 
the visit. You can save a lot of time and actually go on 
to more important issues from the patient’s perspective and also on changing the treatment, starting new 
medications, and adjusting them” (Physician, 5:2).
Others believed that such planning made no difference, because patient noncompliance was the chief 
constraint for any care improvement. 
“Having information at the time that you’re actually seeing the patient changes the fl ow in the offi ce a 
lot, about when things get done or who’s calling about 
what. But we haven’t fundamentally changed how we 
motivate people. We’re just pestering them on a different end of that visit” (Physician, 2:5).
Such comments seemed to refl ect a lack of awareness of the need for any systemic care change, as well 
as the common medical professional pattern of blaming 
patients for the ills of their care results.13
In several of the clinics, structural space changes 
positioned PPT members closer together, which their 
leaders observed had improved team function. In clinics where fl oor plans remained traditional (clerical 
staff at front, licensed practical nurses in the middle 
near examination rooms, individual physician offi ces 
in back, and registered nurses in a separate space), 
teamwork appeared constrained by the geography. Traditional workspace arrangements, in effect, segregated 
clinic staff by work discipline and did not provide 
shared, comfortable spaces for face-to-face multidisciplinary teamwork. Although a fully functioning EMR 
could provide a shared virtual workspace, at the time 
of our study, most clinics were still too new to electronic systems to use them facilely. 
Information systems were an important element of 
the CCM implementation in 2 major ways. First, the 
2-phase organizational implementation of an EMR, 
initially mostly read-only but later fully interactive and 
paperless, was concurrent with other aspects of CCM 
implementation. The demands of learning computer 
skills and using the new EMR reduced the ability to 
focus more specifi cally on team and care changes, at 
times overwhelming all personnel. Second, the initial 
read-only EMR disrupted existing care processes, 
including fl ow sheets and registries. It did not permit 
easy collation of information necessary for care planning, such as fl ow sheets of preventive services. It also 
did not accommodate the importation or customization of tools for information management. Information 
management for planning and following patterns of 
clinical care often required a great amount of reworking by the staff. In addition, the use of existing online 
chronic disease registries, eg, for diabetes, varied 
widely across the clinics. The clinic with best use of 
a registry had a software-savvy administrative leader 
who customized their registry report to make it more 
user-friendly, even though it required double entry of 
data. The 2 clinics that did not use the registries at all 
reported they chose not to because the cost of reworking information led to inaccuracies that were greater 
than the potential benefi ts. 
“I think registry lists never fl ew. We tried working. 
We got registry lists from corporate. By the time you 
got them, they were based on billing data, they were 
wrong, and it felt like just a tremendous waste of time 
to try and work that list. We had to clean it up and 
then work it. It was just a ridiculous waste of time and 
no return” (Supervisor, 1:1).
Organizational leaders agreed that clinic operations 
were changing but believed that care practices were 
not being dramatically transformed. At the time of the 
interviews, they were not expecting much change in 
patient outcomes soon. There were struggles in developing adequate change measures and little means for 
accountability. Nevertheless, many spoke of their hope

CHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
for achieving change in the future, using such metaphors as a “foundation being laid,” a “plane ready for 
take off,” or being “ready to blossom.” 
The level of CCM implementation in each clinic, 
as rated by the authors from the interview and observational data, is displayed in Table 2. These fi ndings 
illustrate the relatively low level of implementation 
of the CCM elements and their components 2 years 
into the process, even in the one clinic that was much 
more successful in doing so. PPT development, hence 
delivery system redesign, was the focus of most of 
this CCM implementation effort. Clinical information 
systems and health care organization were the other 
CCM elements with some notable changes. Scores in 
the self-management support and decision support categories more often related to tools and practices that 
predated the CCM implementation. 
Change Process
The change process used to implement these care 
process changes was strikingly different from what 
had been used for the successful implementation of 
advanced access scheduling 2 years earlier. Table 3 
summarizes these differences, most of which appeared 
to be related to the much less well-defi ned information available about details or methodology of CCM 
implementation. As a result, every clinic went about 
change differently. Local clinic leader approaches 
ranged from hands off to micromanaging, but mostly 
they relied on the self-organizing initiative of individuals and each PPT. 
Originally, it was hoped that substantial transformation of care could be made within 1 year, but it 
quickly became apparent this much was not possible. 
Change strategies required major revision and time. As 
1 organizational leader said, “We are limited by human 
capacity to change [and] we are rebuilding the airplane 
while it’s fl ying.”
Change Facilitators and Barriers
Change facilitators and barriers at both clinic and 
organizational levels are summarized in Table 4. 
Notable facilitators included the presence of a few 
strong clinic leaders, such as a chief physician who 
envisioned the specifi c changes needed and supervisors who supported that vision. Clinic staff able to take 
leadership of PPTs became important change leaders 
for individual teams. In other words, leadership ability 
needed to be dispersed over multiple levels that ranged 
from overall clinic leaders to at least some clinic staff

in varying roles. Physicians, even though not engaged, 
did not openly resist the care changes, because those 
changes that affected the availablilty of information 
and supported decision making made their lives easier. 
In some clinics, personnel actions were taken with 
those unwilling to make changes, including physicians; 
these decisions were typically made at the clinic level 
and supported by central leaders. At 1 clinic, supervisors believed such an action was the difference that 
allowed teamwork development to proceed. We heard 
no evidence of such changes being a disincentive for 
change. As new forms of teamwork developed, the 
trust, communication, and stable work relationships it 
promoted were self-reinforcing. 
Barriers to change included clinic leaders who 
failed to develop a practical vision for the change or 
who involved themselves less in change management. 
Change management skills appeared limited across 
all the clinics, and few clinics had organized change 
management teams. There was little, if any, evidence 
of meaningful use of formal change processes, such as 
PDSA (plan, do, study, act) cycles. Staff experienced 
change fatigue and apathy, the result of 4 years of 
major changes and many other priorities for quality 
improvement, productivity increases, and cost reduction. Large organizational size meant clinic personnel 
were relatively insulated from the business imperatives 
for change that could motivate a smaller group. In 
addition, union rules placed constraints on how work 
roles might be reconfi gured. There was still no generally agreed-on sense that consistency or standardization of care within or across clinics was valuable. 
“I don’t think that the culture at the clinic has really 
bought into the fact that there are some best ways to 
do things and we should all do them that way. Even 
around immunizations, let’s say. I had a nurse just 
recently who said, ’I don’t think we’ll ever all recommend the same thing.’ Wow! That’s amazing, isn’t it?” 
(Physician leader, 2:1).
Finally, the seeming contradiction of naming physicians as both change facilitators and barriers (Table 4) 
refl ects their professional power in shaping patient care 
processes and their general stance of neutral autonomy 
in this change. They neither actively supported nor 
actively resisted the change, so other clinic staff strategically built change around them. The issue of physician autonomy and general lack of engagement in the 
change process was not addressed systematically.

CHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
DISCUSSION
This medical group’s effort to transform its approach 
to care by implementing CCM concepts appears to 
have produced some changes, mostly related to partial 
changes in team structure, roles, and function, as well 
as introduction of an EMR. Although the team changes 
appeared small, immensely varied within and among 
its clinics, and unlikely to be associated with major 
measurable improvements in care, they may represent a 
fi rst step in creating a new foundation for transformed 
care. They illustrate that changing traditional care patterns is diffi cult and requires enormous attention and 
focus, with clear specifi cations, strong leadership, and 
attention to a myriad of details at both local and central levels of an organization. 
The companion article, describing the related quantitative quality measure results from our study, shows 
that the improvements for diabetes care, coronary heart 
disease care, and depression care occurred in outcomes 
(such as glycated hemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein levels) rather than in care processes (such as rates of 
laboratory testing or use of antidepressant medications).7
This qualitative work suggests that the care process 
changes were still nascent, and the care improvements 
may not have been directly due to the CCM implementation. The quality measure improvements during the 
CCM change may also be taken as a hopeful sign that 
long, diffi cult, and sometimes chaotic change processes 
are not incompatible with some advances in care quality.
It is particularly striking to compare the approaches 
taken for this change effort with those taken for 
advanced access 2 years earlier. At fi rst glance it looks 
as if the organization forgot the change lessons of 
its earlier successful transformation. The differences 
become more understandable, however, with the realization that the 2 changes were qualitatively different, 
beginning with care process designs, which differed 
completely in their level of action and ability. 
The advanced access effort began with a more 
concrete, prescriptive model ready for implementation, whereas the CCM effort had only an abstract 
conceptual framework that required up-front design 
of what was to be implemented and how to do it. The 
CCM change leaders also had to adjust to constrained 
options because of the grant and other organizational 
priorities. As a result, their strategies changed several 
times as they worked to construct and fl esh out operational details of the CCM concept and its implementation. Clinic leaders then often had limited guidance 
on what to do and how to do it. Although the medical 
group is known for its measurement savvy, meaningful 
measures and feedback mechanisms for the changes 
were also diffi cult to develop. Much of the change 
effort aimed for endpoints in work relationships, where 
it appeared that measurable processes did not necessarily translate into desired, measurable outcomes. 
Measure development was also hampered at the time 
of the study by a limited understanding of the PDSA 
process in the clinics and by so few changes being 
systemwide, and thus amenable to systemic measurement. This example highlights the difference between 
theoretical ideals and practical realities. In an ideal 
world, it might have been easier to separate EMR implementation from PPT development. Leaders wondered in 
retrospect whether it would have been easier for clinics 
to be plunged into the interactive EMR from the start, 
rather than have it implemented in stages. But in the 
real world, decisions must be made and action taken on 
the basis of incomplete information. Regardless of how 
planned any change may be, no one has the luxury of 
planning its full context or its related contingencies free 
of other priorities. In addition, one structural change 
may bring to the fore others needing to happen, as with 
the problematic registries that led to staff work-arounds. 
This example also raises questions about how best 
to use the conceptual framework, the Chronic Care 
Model, particularly in regard to the difference between 
care process design and change implementation. After 
initial efforts to educate clinic personnel in the overall 
framework clearly failed, organizational leaders turned 
from using the whole CCM to a few more-focused 
concepts, especially PPTs. Although they developed 
some role specifi cations for PPT members, individual 
teams and clinics had to work out their own details. 
With no preexisting examples of effective teams, we 
observed that the teams had limited effectiveness and 
undesirable variability. The main improvements came 
from those personnel most prepared for role expansion, particularly nurses, who used the opportunity to 
develop their immediate care setting. 
As a conceptual framework, the CCM is useful for 
thinking about the types of care processes needing to 
be addressed. It was at best a vague guide to change, 
however; there were no specifi cs about the actual care 
process changes to be made and no description of the 
change process needed to achieve them. In contrast, 
Murray and Tantau’s detailed description of a more limited but still dramatic change in care process—advanced 
access—does provide those operational specifi cs.14-16 In 
addition to a theoretical framework for thinking about 
the problem, it specifi es what the new care model looks 
like (>50% open appointments at the beginning of a day, 
offers of same-day service with one’s personal clinician, 
etc) and what changes are needed to get there (periodic 
measures of backlog and access, reduction in appointment types, working down the backlog, “max-packing” 
visits). They also describe previous transformation 
experiences and successful models. This information

CHRONIC CARE MODEL IMPLEMENTATION
allowed the medical group to successfully tailor its own 
approach to advanced access implementation (Table 3). 
Efforts to improve the quality of medical practice 
have a long history, going back at least to the work of 
Dr Ernest Codman in the 19th century.17 More recently, 
we passed through the phase of quality assurance based 
on the “bad apple” theory, and then to the continuous 
quality improvement model from industry.18 After some 
false starts in which there was too much emphasis on 
improving particular processes using models that took 
too long and failed to involve leadership and address 
culture, we now seem to be developing more comprehensive and rapid approaches that include physicians.19 The research literature, however, has continued 
to focus almost entirely on studying interventions 
to change the behavior of individual physicians.20,21
Only recently are the 2 threads coming together in an 
understanding that real change requires applying quality improvement to change practice systems and using 
organizational change processes to do so.22-28
Some of the lessons we draw from this large organization’s effort to transform its care for patients with 
chronic conditions are as follows:
1. Choose selective care processes that have been well 
worked out in similar settings, or devote time to careful 
design and piloting before tackling implementation.
2. Use the CCM as a backdrop for leaders to understand the relationships and roles of specifi c care changes 
needed, not as the change blueprint or training model.
3. Recognize and respect the diffi culty of changing 
traditional care patterns. Organizational and professional 
cultures are critical to any change and require as much 
attention as the implementation, so fi rst understand and 
align your organization’s culture with the strategies being 
chosen.29 Attend to work relationships; when functioning 
well, they should engage and empower all stakeholders 
to invest in and contribute to the changes.30
4. Involve and engage physicians in both the care 
and change processes, or change will be stymied and 
the impact on patient outcomes will be limited.
5. Give individual clinics clear models and specifi cations about the desired end, as well as latitude in 
how they get there.
6. Provide strong leadership vision, along with 
change management skills, and ample resources at the 
level of both overall organization and individual clinics.
7. Monitor closely what is going on, and adjust as 
change barriers emerge. 
8. Focus, focus, focus! Large changes require strong 
prioritization and ongoing concentration of organizational attention, resources, time, and energies.
9. Change takes time, probably twice as long as you 
think. Pace the work, giving time and space for essential group learning and refl ection.31
10. Allow for the unexpected. Complexity science 
suggests that surprise is inherent in organizational 
change, offering as much opportunity for learning and 
creativity as threat of failure for those open to it.32,33
11. Appreciate that concurrent organizational 
changes may be unavoidable, even when it would be 
better to separate them.
This study is limited in being observational and 
including only a few clinics with varying change success within one large care system. Interviews and clinic 
observations were made at single points in a much 
longer time span of changes. In addition, although the 
overall change effort was intended as implementation of 
the CCM, it largely focused on the elements of delivery 
system design (PPTs) and on clinical information system 
changes (EMR). This medical group’s experience may be 
best viewed as an exploration in organizational change. 
Study credibility is enhanced by the research team’s 
extensive experience in studying clinical practices and 
related organizational change. Key organizational leaders 
were also engaged with this team to strengthen our data 
collection and its iterative analysis. It is also important to 
note that each member of the research team was familiar 
with the CCM, had supported its use at least conceptually, and had research and/or leadership experience in 
changing physician behavior. Three (LIS, JSH, MPM) 
had some direct leadership involvement in this CCM 
implementation effort. Two (MCH, BFC) approached the 
research from a cultural anthropology perspective. 
Generalizability is tempered by studying a single, 
large health care system in a region in which managed 
care and large health care organizations are widespread. 
Clearly, this group differs in organizational complexity, 
leadership, and resources from the small practices providing most of the primary care in the United States. 
Although the specifi cs of CCM use must be somewhat 
site, system, and population dependent, our sense is 
that the facilitators and barriers others might encounter in implementing the model would differ more in 
degree than in kind. The lessons learned here are probably applicable for any medical group interested in the 
CCM, especially identifi cation of optimal PPT structures and function and optimal integration of the EMR. 
A more-detailed and specifi c care process and 
change process for CCM implementation probably will 
be required to achieve a higher stage of evolution and 
any major change in care delivery. The problems and 
needs identifi ed here may partially explain why there 
are still so few examples of the successful care changes 
called for by the Institute of Medicine.
Epilogue
In the 2 years since data for this study were collected, 
the medical group has fully implemented its EMR and

made considerable progress in delineating and applying its standardized, disease-neutral care model and 
the visit cycle concept (previsit, visit, postvisit, and 
between-visit). This model continues to spread in primary care through clinic-wide collaborative learning 
sessions, and training has included leadership development. Physician engagement is being built into the 
EMR. Quality measures are starting to show increased 
improvement, and leaders are cautiously optimistic that 
the trend will continue.
