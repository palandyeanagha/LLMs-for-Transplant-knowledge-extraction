Abstract Tafamidis, a transthyretin (TTR) kinetic stabilizer, delayed neuropathic progression in patients with
Val30Met TTR familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTRFAP) in an 18-month randomized controlled trial (study
Fx-005). This 12-month, open-label extension study evaluated the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
tafamidis 20 mg once daily in 86 patients who earlier
received blinded treatment with tafamidis or placebo.
Efficacy measures included the Neuropathy Impairment
Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL), Norfolk Quality of
Life-Diabetic Neuropathy total quality of life (TQOL)
score, and changes in neurologic function and nutritional
status. We quantified the monthly rates of change in efficacy measures, and TTR stabilization, and monitored
adverse events (AEs). Patients who continued on tafamidis
had stable rates of change in NIS-LL (from 0.08 to 0.11/
month; p = 0.60) and TQOL (from -0.03 to 0.25;
p = 0.16). In patients switched from placebo, the monthly
rate of change in NIS-LL declined (from 0.34 to 0.16/
month; p = 0.01), as did TQOL score (from 0.61 to -0.16;
p\0.001). Patients treated with tafamidis for 30 months
had 55.9 % greater preservation of neurologic function as
measured by the NIS-LL than patients in whom tafamidis
was initiated later. Plasma TTR was stabilized in 94.1 % of
patients treated with tafamidis for 30 months. AEs were
similar between groups; no patients discontinued because
of an AE. Long-term tafamidis was well tolerated, with the
reduced rate of neurologic deterioration sustained over
30 months. Tafamidis also slowed neurologic impairment
in patients previously given placebo, but treatment benefits
were greater when tafamidis was begun earlier.

Introduction
Transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP)
is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by TTR gene
mutations that destabilize the tetrameric transthyretin
(TTR) protein, leading to tetramer dissociation, monomer
misfolding, and aggregation [1, 2]. TTR is a plasma protein
produced mainly by the liver that functions as a backup
transporter for thyroxine and as the primary transporter of
the retinol-binding protein/vitamin A complex [3, 4]. The
dissociation of the TTR tetramer into its monomeric subunits is believed to be the rate-limiting step in amyloidogenesis [5]. Subsequent monomer misfolding and
misassembly leads to efficient TTR aggregation, including
amyloid fibril formation. Evidence suggests that TTR
amyloidogenesis causes axonal degeneration, leading to
progressive sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy [2, 6].
The length-dependent axonal degeneration initially
involves the unmyelinated and small myelinated nerve
fibers that mediate pain and temperature sensation, causing
sensory disturbances that typically start in the lower
extremities. Concomitantly, autonomic dysfunction
affecting the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and cardiovascular systems, and subsequent degeneration of larger myelinated fibers results in further sensory deficits and muscle
weakness [7, 8]. The gastrointestinal complications ultimately lead to malabsorption, extreme malnutrition, and
substantial weight loss, with death often occurring within a
decade of symptom onset [7–9].
Liver transplant is the current standard of care for
patients with TTR-FAP, replacing the mutated TTR gene
producing the majority of circulating transthyretin with a
wild-type gene found in a genetically normal donor organ
[10]. Although liver transplant has been shown to slow
disease progression [11, 12] and prolong survival [13–15],
it is associated with a first-year mortality of &10 % and
substantial morbidity due to chronic immunosuppression
[13, 15, 16]. Furthermore, due to continuing tetramer dissociation, monomer misfolding and misassembly of wildtype TTR into oligomers and amyloid, and the extrahepatic
production of mutated TTR, transplant does not prevent
clinical deterioration (in particular, heart and ocular complications) in all recipients [17–21]. This underscores the
need for new treatment approaches.
TTR kinetic stabilizers offer a promising approach, in
which small-molecule binding to the unoccupied thyroxine-binding sites on TTR stabilizes the protein in its native
tetrameric state, thereby markedly slowing tetramer
dissociation and, consequently, amyloidogenesis [10, 22].
Tafamidis is a small molecule that binds selectively to TTR
in human blood and slows TTR fibril formation in vitro
[23, 24]. The compound binds with negative cooperativity
to at least one of the two thyroxine-binding sites on TTR to
kinetically stabilize the tetramer.
The safety and efficacy of oral tafamidis, 20 mg once
daily, in patients with TTR-FAP was evaluated in an
18-month, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (study Fx-005) [25]. The co-primary
efficacy endpoints were the Neuropathy Impairment Score
in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) response (\2-point change
from baseline at month 18) and change from baseline to
month 18 in the Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy Total Quality of Life (TQOL) score. Multiple
outcome measures were used to evaluate the efficacy of
tafamidis on neurologic progression, nutritional status,
and QOL. There was a higher than anticipated liver
transplant dropout rate, and statistically significant differences between the tafamidis and placebo groups were
not observed in the primary analysis in the intent-to-treat
(ITT) population for both co-primary endpoints. However,
in a predefined secondary analysis, where the primary
analysis of the NIS-LL response rates was repeated using
the per-protocol (efficacy evaluable) population that
excluded liver transplant patients, significantly more tafamidis-treated patients were NIS-LL responders compared with placebo recipients (60.0 vs. 38.1 %; p = 0.04).
Additionally, the tafamidis-treated patients had better
preserved QOL. As several secondary outcomes also
demonstrated a significant reduction in the worsening of
peripheral neurologic impairment with tafamidis, the
totality of the evidence supported the hypothesis that
preventing TTR dissociation can delay peripheral neurologic impairment in TTR-FAP [25].
The main objectives of the extension study (study
Fx-006) were to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of tafamidis and to assess the long-term effects on
disease progression with tafamidis.
Methods
Patients
Men and women who had TTR-FAP with the Val30Met
mutation and completed the month 18 visit of study Fx-005
were eligible. Key exclusion criteria were the presence of
liver function test abnormalities considered by the investigator to be due to reduced liver function or active liver
disease and the chronic use of non-protocol-approved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Female patients who
were pregnant or breastfeeding were also ineligible.

Study protocol
This extension study was an open-label, multicenter,
international, single-arm trial, in which all patients
received oral tafamidis 20 mg once daily for 12 months.
This study, in combination with the previous double-blind
study, represents a delayed treatment type of design.
Patients randomized to placebo in study Fx-005 were
switched to tafamidis and constituted the ‘placebo–tafamidis’ group, whereas patients randomized to tafamidis initially continued to receive the active drug and constituted
the ‘tafamidis–tafamidis’ group. Although the patients and
investigators were aware that all patients were receiving
tafamidis during the extension study, they remained blinded to the treatment assignment in study Fx-005. The
values obtained in the procedures and evaluations conducted at the month 18 visit of study Fx-005 served as the
baseline for this extension study. It was intended that study
medication would not be interrupted between the two
studies. However, three sites experienced an extended
interval between the end of study Fx-005 and initiation of
the extension study because of delays in regulatory
approval. As a result, 14 patients (6 in the tafamidis–
tafamidis group and 8 in the placebo–tafamidis group) had
their treatment interrupted for more than 2 months. For
these patients, who were not included in the ITT population, new baseline assessments were conducted at enrollment into the extension study.
All patients self-administered a once-daily dose of
tafamidis 20 mg for 12 months. The active drug was supplied in soft-gelatin capsules filled with a suspension
containing 20 mg of tafamidis meglumine.
Clinic visits were scheduled at week 6 and months 3, 6,
and 12. Efficacy measures were performed at months 6 and
12, and vital signs were assessed, electrocardiography was
performed, clinical laboratory evaluations were made, and
adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each visit. Telephone calls to enquire about any change in each patient’s
health status, AEs, and concomitant medications were
made during the months in which no clinic visits were
scheduled and at 30 days after the last dose of the study
medication.
This study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00791492) was
approved by the Independent Ethics Committee at each
site. All patients provided written informed consent.
Efficacy measures
Efficacy measures and the rationale for their use in evaluating patients with TTR-FAP have been described previously [25]. In addition to the safety and tolerability
analyses performed to address the protocol-specified
objectives, statistical analyses were also performed on the
efficacy data from this extension study (Fx-006). The
details of these efficacy analyses were outlined in the statistical analysis plan for this protocol.
The NIS-LL, which quantifies the neurologic examination of the lower limbs [26], ranges from 0 (normal) to 88
(total impairment) and is obtained by adding subscale
scores in each lower limb for muscle weakness, reflexes,
and sensation. The NIS-LL was assessed twice at each
visit, separated by at least 24 h and within 1 week, with the
results reported as the average of the two tests. Clinical/
neurophysiologic composite endpoints (NIS-LL ? R3 and
NISLL ? R7) were calculated after data availability.
The Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy
questionnaire is a 35-item, patient-reported questionnaire
that comprises domains for physical functioning/large-fiber
neuropathy, symptoms, activities of daily life, small-fiber
neuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy [27]. The TQOL
score, representing the sum of the five domain subscores,
ranges from -2 (best possible QOL) to 138 (worst possible
QOL).
Large- and small-fiber function were assessed using
composite scores obtained by summing multiple measures
of nerve fiber impairment, including the results of five
nerve conduction studies [NCSs] (sural nerve sensory
nerve action potential, peroneal nerve compound muscle
action potential, peroneal nerve motor conduction velocity,
peroneal nerve distal motor latency, and tibial nerve distal
motor latency), three measures of sensory detection
thresholds (vibration detection threshold at the hallux and
cooling detection threshold, and heat/pain detection
threshold at the dorsum of the foot) obtained using quantitative sensory testing (QST) with the Computer Aided
Sensory Evaluator (version 4; CASE IV), and the heart rate
response to deep breathing (HRDB) at six breaths/min. The
summated seven nerve tests normal deviate score (R7 NTs
nds), which measures primarily large-fiber function, combines the results of the five NCSs with the vibration
detection threshold of the hallux and HRDB, and is scored
from -26 to 26, with a higher score demonstrating more
impaired nerve function. The summated three nerve tests
(small fiber) normal deviate score (R3 NTSF nds), which
measures small-fiber function, comprises cooling detection
threshold, heat/pain detection threshold, and HRDB and is
scored from -11.2 to 11.2, with a higher score demonstrating more impaired nerve function. For statistical
analyses, individual test data were expressed as normal
deviates based on healthy subject cohort data from the
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.
Modified body mass index (mBMI) is calculated by
multiplying BMI (kg/m2
) by serum albumin concentration
(g/L) to compensate for the edema that may be caused by
malnutrition associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction.
The mBMI was found to correlate better with survival than
2804 J Neurol (2013) 260:2802–2814
123

the standard BMI measure in TTR-FAP patients who had
not undergone liver transplant [28].
The stability of the TTR tetramer was analyzed using a
validated immunoturbidimetric assay performed on
patients’ plasma samples [24, 29].
Safety and tolerability assessments
Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring treatment-emergent AEs (AEs that started or worsened between
the start of study treatment and 30 days after the last dose).
In addition, physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiogram, laboratory tests, and recording of vital signs were
performed at each clinic visit, and Holter monitoring,
echocardiography, and eye examinations with fundal photography were conducted at the 6- and 12-month visits.
Statistical analyses
Efficacy analyses were conducted in the ITT population,
which included all patients who received at least one dose
of study medication and had an interruption of B2 months
between study Fx-005 and the extension study. As enrollment was constrained by the number of patients who
completed study Fx-005 and elected to continue their
participation, the sample size in the extension study was
not based on formal sample size calculations and the study
was not powered specifically for the evaluation of the
efficacy measures. To assess efficacy in the extension
study, three main hypotheses were proposed in the statistical analysis plan; (i) to determine whether the treatment
effect of tafamidis in slowing disease progression over
18 months could be sustained for an additional 12 months
(comprising a total of 30 months), we compared the
monthly rate of change of the various outcome measures
during the extension study (i.e., the last 12 months of
treatment) with the monthly rate of change during the first
18 months (i.e., in study Fx-005) in the tafamidis–tafamidis group; (ii) to evaluate the efficacy of tafamidis in
slowing disease progression in patients previously given
placebo, we compared the monthly rates of change in the
outcome measures during the extension study (tafamidis
treatment) and study Fx-005 (placebo) in the placebo–tafamidis group; (iii) to assess whether earlier initiation of
treatment resulted in better outcomes, we compared the
changes in each efficacy measure from the baseline of the
double-blind study (Fx-005) with month 12 of the extension study in the tafamidis–tafamidis group and the placebo–tafamidis group.
A mixed-model analysis of variance was used to assess
the sustainability of the treatment effect, and the efficacy of
tafamidis in slowing disease progression in patients
previously given placebo, with the measurement at different visits as the dependent variable, and the study-bytreatment interaction and the time-by-study-by-treatment
interaction as independent variables. The intercept and
time variables were modeled as random effects. The test of
treatment effect was based on the time-by-study-by-treatment interaction. If each patient underwent the same
number of observations, the model would be equivalent to
a 2-stage analysis, in which the slope of each patient’s
efficacy measure is determined by linear regression for Fx005 and Fx-006 separately and the slopes within treatment
groups are compared between the studies using a paired
t test. To evaluate the early-start treatment effects, the
changes from the pretreatment baseline of study Fx-005 to
the end of the extension study by treatment sequence were
compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Muscle
weakness at the individual joint locations (toe, ankle, knee,
and hip) was also evaluated for early-start treatment effect.
Safety analyses were performed on all patients who
received at least one dose of the study medication (i.e., the
safety population).
Results
Patients
Ninety-one patients completed the month 18 visit in study
Fx-005, and 86 patients (94.5 %) enrolled in the extension
study, which ran between July 2008 and October 2010. Of
the five patients who decided not to participate in the
extension study, two cited liver transplantation, two pregnancy, and one refused regular clinic visits. All but one of
the enrolled patients received tafamidis; therefore, the
safety population consisted of 85 patients. Fourteen
patients (16.3 %) had treatment interrupted for[2 months
between studies and were excluded from the ITT population (Fig. 1). Of the 71 patients in the ITT population, five
(5.8 %) discontinued treatment to undergo liver transplant,
and three (3.5 %) discontinued after withdrawing consent.
In total, 63 patients (88.7 %) in the ITT population and all
14 patients who had treatment interruption [2 months
between the two studies completed the extension.
The demographic characteristics of patients in the
tafamidis–tafamidis and placebo–tafamidis groups at the
baseline of the extension study were similar (Table 1). The
patients who had received placebo in study Fx-005 [25]
demonstrated greater disease severity at the start of the
open-label extension than the patients who had been treated
with tafamidis (Table 1). Of relevance to the use of mBMI
as an outcome measure, 6 of 85 patients (7.1 %) had a
medical history of peripheral edema.

Sustainability of the treatment effect of tafamidis
on disease progression
In the tafamidis–tafamidis group (n = 38) there were no
statistically significant differences in the monthly rate of
change in measures of neurologic function (NIS-LL, largefiber function, and small-fiber function) or TQOL between
the last 12 months and first 18 months of tafamidis administration (Fig. 2a–d). Similarly, monthly rates of change in
clinical/neurophysiological endpoints NIS-LL ? R3
(p = 0.56) and NIS-LL ? R7 (p = 0.69) were stable over
the same period. Following an increase in mBMI during the
randomized trial, the monthly rate of change dropped in the
tafamidis–tafamidis population after entry into the extension
study (Fig. 2e). The reason for this observation is not known
but it is not expected or desirable for patients to continuously increase their weight. Importantly, mBMI levels
remained higher than those observed prior to treatment.
Taken together, these results indicate that the treatment
effect of tafamidis was sustained over 30 months.
Efficacy of tafamidis in patients previously given
placebo
The efficacy of tafamidis in patients previously given
placebo was assessed by comparing the rate of disease
progression (as measured by the monthly rate of change or
slope) for each endpoint during the last 12 months of
treatment (study Fx-006) with the first 18 months of
treatment (study Fx-005) in the placebo–tafamidis group
(Fig. 3). To place these results into perspective, the rate of
disease progression in the 64 patients who received tafamidis in the ITT group in study Fx-005 is also displayed
for each endpoint in Fig. 3.
In the placebo-tafamidis group there was a significant
reduction in the rate of neurologic deterioration following
the initiation of tafamidis in the extension study, as quantified by the NIS-LL (monthly rate of change, study Fx-005:

Long-term effects of tafamidis on disease progression
To assess the effects of tafamidis on disease progression
over a period of 30 months, the changes from study Fx-005
baseline in efficacy measures at 6, 12, 18, 24, and
30 months in each treatment group were examined (Fig. 4).
Compared with patients originally given placebo, neurologic function (NIS-LL, NIS-LL muscle weakness, largeand small-fiber function) in the tafamidis–tafamidis
patients remained relatively stable, and pre-treatment
TQOL and mBMI were preserved.

deterioration than the patients who began tafamidis
18 months later (i.e., the placebo–tafamidis group) [Fig. 5],
suggesting that early initiation of tafamidis treatment has
long-term beneficial effects on neurological disease progression. Thus, there were significant treatment group differences in the mean change from study Fx-005 baseline at
30 months for NIS-LL (3.0 vs. 6.8 points; Wilcoxon’s rank
sum test p = 0.04) and for R7 NTs nds (1.6 vs. 4.7; Wilcoxon’s rank sum test p\0.01) [Fig. 5]. There was no
statistically significant difference between treatment groups
for the mean change from study Fx-005 baseline at
30 months for TQOL and mBMI. The lack of a significant
difference in the mBMI may be primarily due to the
worsening in the placebo group in study Fx-005 being
reversed following delayed initiation of tafamidis
treatment.
TTR stabilization
At month 12 of the extension study, TTR stabilization was
demonstrated in 94.1 % of patients in the tafamidis–

tafamidis group. The results at month 12 were similar to
those at week 6 (94.6 and 96.8 %, respectively), which
suggests that tolerance did not develop to the TTR-stabilizing effects of tafamidis.
Long-term safety and tolerability of tafamidis
No new safety or tolerability issues were identified
during the extension study, and the overall incidence of
AEs was similar in both groups (Table 2). The incidence
of serious AEs (SAEs) was also similar in both groups,
with five patients in the tafamidis–tafamidis group having a total of nine SAEs and four patients in the placebo–tafamidis group having a total of 14 SAEs. No
patient reported deterioration in renal function that
required therapeutic measures. No SAEs were life
threatening. No patients died or discontinued treatment
due to an AE.
Discussion
The combination of the double-blind trial (study Fx-005)
and the present open-label extension study resembles the
design of a delayed-start trial. In such trials, patients are
assigned to either receive study drug for the entire length of
the study (early-start) or to receive placebo in phase I and
study drug in phase II of the trial (delayed-start). This
design has been developed to try to distinguish between
long-term effects on disease progression and symptomatic
effects [30]. With both cohorts receiving drug therapy for
an extended period of time, confounding short-term effects
on disease symptoms may be identified by a persistence of
benefit that may be consistent with disease modification for
the treatment group receiving a longer duration of active
therapy. The delayed start design has been used successfully in trials of other neurodegenerative diseases [31–34],
such as ADAGIO, which assessed neuroprotection by rasagiline in Parkinson’s patients [32, 33]. The results of the
current extension study provide support for the efficacy and
safety of tafamidis in the treatment of patients with TTRFAP, and demonstrate that treatment benefits are sustained
over 30 months, corresponding to one-fourth of the average disease duration of 10 years [7, 8]. The sustainability
of the tafamidis treatment effect in delaying neurologic
deterioration was demonstrated using a variety of efficacy
measures, and may account for the observed preservation
of QOL.
The findings of the original double-blind trial and the
present open-label extension study demonstrate that the
tafamidis treatment benefits that were accrued over
18 months could be sustained for an additional 12 months.
The design of these studies (in which only the initial
18 months were placebo-controlled) precludes direct
assessment of the extent to which tafamidis preserved
neurologic function and QOL over 30 months, compared
with placebo.
In addition to deterioration in neurologic function,
weight loss is a characteristic complication of TTR-FAP,
and mBMI has been shown to be a useful indicator of
disease severity [28]. The finding that mBMI was maintained at pretreatment values for 30 months in the

tafamidis–tafamidis patients provides further support for
the long-term efficacy of tafamidis in delaying disease
progression.
The extension study also provided the opportunity to
evaluate tafamidis in the group of treatment-naı¨ve patients
who were randomized to receive placebo in study Fx-005.
During study Fx-005, this group had greater disease progression than the group randomized to tafamidis, and
demonstrated worse neurologic function at the time of
tafamidis initiation in the extension trial. Nevertheless,
even the delayed introduction of tafamidis significantly
slowed the rates of change in NIS-LL, Norfolk TQOL, and
mBMI compared with placebo [25]. Interestingly, while
TTR stabilization is evident at week 6, there was a delay in
the onset of the stabilizing effect of tafamidis on the rate of
deterioration in NIS-LL and large nerve fiber function in
the placebo–tafamidis cohort. The underlying reason for
this delay is unknown, but the more severe disease stage at
the start of the treatment of placebo-tafamidis patients is a
conceivable explanation.
The mechanism of action of tafamidis in kinetically
stabilizing TTR and thereby preventing tetramer dissociation leading to amyloidogenesis should be expected to slow
disease progression rather than just provide symptomatic
benefit. This is based on the observation of T119M interallelic kinetic stabilization of the TTR tetramer, which
inhibits onset and progression of Val30Met TTR-FAP [10,
24, 35, 36]. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that starting
tafamidis earlier in the course of the disease would provide
long-lasting effects on neurologic function and QOL. This
hypothesis was tested by comparing the various efficacy
endpoints between the tafamidis–tafamidis and placebo–
tafamidis groups from the study Fx-005 baseline to the
extension study month-12 assessment. Patients who started
tafamidis treatment earlier had less neurologic impairment
and large-fiber dysfunction compared with patients who
started tafamidis 18 months later. Although the difference
was not statistically significant, patients who began tafamidis 18 months earlier had numerically lower TQOL
scores, indicating a relative preservation of QOL compared
with patients who started later. As improvements in
nutritional status have been demonstrated in patients with
TTR-FAP who undergo liver transplant [37], the finding
that the deterioration in mBMI in patients who received
placebo could be reversed following 12 months of treatment with tafamidis is noteworthy.
Tafamidis was safe and well tolerated during long-term
treatment, with no apparent differences in AEs reported
between the tafamidis–tafamidis and placebo–tafamidis
groups. The type and incidence of AEs were consistent
with those expected in patients with TTR-FAP, with most
reported as mild or moderate in intensity and none resulting
in treatment discontinuation or death. These findings
confirm the safety of tafamidis that was demonstrated
during the 18 months of treatment in study Fx-005 [25].
It is important to acknowledge several limitations of the
present study. First, it was intended that patients who
completed study Fx-005 would continue treatment without
interruption at entry into the extension study. However,
delays in regulatory approval led to treatment interruption in
patients enrolled at three sites. Removal from the ITT
population of 14 patients who had treatment interruptions of
[2 months (due to the inability to assess a sustained treatment effect) resulted in a reduced sample size for evaluating
the tafamidis treatment benefit. Treatment was interrupted in
six patients in the tafamidis–tafamidis group and eight
patients in the placebo–tafamidis group; all completed the
12-month extension study. Second, the open-label design of
the extension study introduced bias into the study assessments, in that all patients received active drug and were
expected to show at least some benefit. This may have
influenced the assessments of the sustainability of the
tafamidis treatment effect and the efficacy of tafamidis in
slowing disease progression in patients previously given
placebo. However, as the treatment assignment of study
Fx-005 remained under double-blind conditions during the
conduct of study Fx-006, with investigators and patients
unable to distinguish between the tafamidis–tafamidis and
placebo–tafamidis groups, the open-label design would not
be expected to influence the evaluation of early-start versus
delayed-start treatment benefit. Longer-term data are
expected from an open-label extension study
(NCT00925002) that enrolled patients from the current trial
and patients who completed a separate 12-month, open-label
trial of tafamidis. In addition, patients will be followed in the
Transthyretin Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS), an
observational registry established to improve understanding
of the disease (http://www.thaos.net).
In summary, several conclusions can be drawn from the
results of this extension study. First, tafamidis is safe and
well tolerated over 30 months. Second, the effect of tafamidis in slowing neurologic progression and preserving
QOL is sustained over this time. The finding that patients
who started tafamidis early had less neurologic impairment
at 30 months than those who started treatment after an
18-month delay supports the value of the early initiation of
this disease-modifying approach.
