Abstract
Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan (GM) assay has been used for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis
(IA). We aimed to derive a definitive estimate of the overall accuracy of BAL-GM for diagnosing IA.
Methods and Results: We undertook a systematic review of thirty diagnostic studies that evaluated the BAL-GM assay for
diagnosing IA. PubMed and CBM (China Biological Medicine Database) databasees were searched for relevant studies
published in all languages up until Feb 2012. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating
characteristic (SROC) were constructed for each cutoff value. Additionally, pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and
positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR, respectively) were calculated for summarizing overall test
performance. Thirty studies were included in this meta-analysis. The summary estimates of pooled DOR, SEN, SPE, PLR, and
NLR of the BAL-GM assay (cutoff value 0.5) for proven or probable IA were 52.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31.8–87.3), 0.87
(95% CI 0.79–0.92), 0.89 (95% CI 0.85–0.92), 8.0 (95% CI 5.7–11.1) and 0.15 (95% CI 0.10–0.23) respectively. The SROC was
0.94 (95% CI 0.92–0.96). Compared with cutoff value of 0.5, it has higher DOR, SPE and PLR, and similar SEN and NLR with
cutoff value of 1.0, which indicated the optimal cutoff value might be 1.0. Compared with BAL-GM, serum GM has a lower
SEN and higher SPE, while PCR displays a lower SEN and a similar SPE.
Conclusion: With the optimal cutoff value of 1.0, the BAL-GM assay has higher SEN compared to PCR and serum GM test. It
is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of proven and probable IA.

Introduction
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a potentially lethal infection, caused
by Aspergillus fumigatus as well as other Aspergillus species which are
widely distributed in soil and other organic matter[1,2]. Currently,
the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with IA infections
are increasing as more and more number of patients undergo
organ transplantation or allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell, and
are treated with immunosuppressive agents [3,4,5].
Antifungal drugs, such as posaconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole and echinocandins, have greatly improved the therapeutic
option for the treatment of IA[6]. Although the favorable clinical
outcome in patients is largely influenced by the early initiation of
effective treatment by antifungal drugs [7], early clinical diagnosing
IA is still a critical problem and microbiological proof of IA is rarely
feasible [3,8]. Recently, GM, which is a heat-stable polysaccharide
found in the fungal wall of most Aspergillus and Penicillium species[9],
test has been developed to combat this issue[10], because diagnostic
techniques using GM enzyme immunoassay performed on BALF
have the potential to provide evidence of IA infection[11].
So far, several studies have assessed the diagnostic yield of GM
testing in BAL for diagnosis of IA. A recent meta-analysis
evaluated the quality of thirteen clinical studies that used the of
BAL-GM test for diagnosing IA among patients, and concluded
that, the BAL-GM test can be used as a major diagnostic method
with excellent accuracy, however the BAL-GM test is not
absolutely sensitive and specific[12]. Our research team performed a more systematic review of these and more recent
clinical studies by meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of BALGM test method for diagnosing IA.
Materials and Methods
Literature Search
To identify eligible studies for this meta-analysis, two investigators (Zijin Zhao and Luyao Chen) searched the PubMed and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e43347

CBM (China Biological Medicine Database) database in all
languages which were published up to Feb 2012. The search
strategy was based on Boolean combinations of the keywords
((Galactomannan or GM) AND (invasive aspergillosis or aspergillus) AND (bronchoalveolar lavage or pulmonary lavage)). As the
review progressed, we improved the search strategies when
necessary. All references cited in these studies were also reviewed
to identify additional studies.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
All relevant case-control or cohort studies were included,
irrespective of publication status and language. In this metaanalysis, the following inclusive selection criteria were set and
reviewed by two independent investigators: (1) full-text publications, (2) presenting original data for two-by-two tables: when
multiple publications from a particular research group reported
data from overlapping samples, the study reporting the largest
dataset was included, (3) inclusion of patients according to the
diagnosis standard of European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/
MSG)[13], revised EORTC/MSG criteria14] or slight modification EORTC/MSG according to the research population as a
reference standard. Results which were double-checked were
arbitrated by a third investigator (Mingxiang Zou).
Exclusion criteria included: (1) duplicate publications, (2)
insufficient data, such as meeting abstracts and conference
proceedings, (3) studies with fewer than 20 patients.
Data extraction and quality assessment
The data was extracted independently by two of the reviewers
(Jun Li and Peng Chen), using a pre-designed form, and the
information was subsequently entered into Epidata (Odense M,
Denmark), or STATA 12.0 (Stata Corp, College station, TX)
software. Discrepancies were discussed between investigators and
resolved by consensus. For each study, the following information
was recorded: first author, year of publication, country or region of
origin, ethnicity, mean age, study design, data collection, data for
two-by-two tables and so on. Discrepancies between the extracted
data were resolved by discussion, and, if required, referred to a
third investigator. When the data for a study was not clear and/or
not presented by the author in the full-text publications, we
contacted the authors for further details. Quality of studies was
assessed by using the revised tool for the quality assessment of
diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool[15] and the
standards for reporting diagnostic accuracy (STARD) tool[16].
Each item scored a ‘‘yes’’, ‘‘no’’, or ‘‘unclear’’ if there is not
sufficient information to make an accurate judgment.
Statistical analysis
In this meta-analysis, patients were classified into four groups
according to the revised EORTC/MSG: proven IA, probable IA,
possible IA, and no IA [14]. For each study, we constructed a twoby-two table cross-classifying BAL-GM test results and the IA
((proven or probable IA vs. possible or no IA) AND (proven IA vs.
probable, possible, or no IA)). Because several cutoffs were
reported in some studies, we mainly evaluated the cutoff values of
0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 based on the included studies. As to the
studies aiming at comparing Aspergillus PCR and BAL-GM test for
the diagnosis of IA, we also investigate the pooled SEN and SPE
between PCR and BAL-GM by meta-analysis.
As a single indicator measure of the accuracy of a diagnostic
test[17], the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) describes the odds of
positive test results in patients with the disease compared with the
odds of positive results in those without disease, and corresponds to
particular pairings of SEN and SPE [18]. By using a bivariate
regression approach, the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed to visualize data, and the
pooled estimates of SEN and SPE were calculated as the main
outcome measures. Meanwhile the summary positive/negative
likelihood ratios (pooled PLR and pooled NLR, respectively) were

also calculated. A value of pooled PLR greater than 10 and of
pooled NLR less than 0.1 were noted as providing convincing
diagnostic evidence, while those value more than 5 and less than
0.2 respectively providing strong diagnostic evidence [19,20]. The
between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by the I-square
statistic. The DerSimonian Laird method was used for pooled
analyses if the value of heterogeneity was more than 50% [21,22].
To explore the sources of between-study heterogeneity, a metaregression was used according to the characteristics of the included
studies. Subgroup analyses were also performed if necessary. All
the analyses mentioned above were conducted in RveMan 5.1 and
STATA 12.0 (College Station, TX, USA) with the MIDAS and
METANDI modules.
Results
A total of 276 potentially useful relevant articles were initially
identified (Figure 1). Then after reviewing the titles by two
independent review authors (Zijin Zhao, Luyao Chen), 232 papers
were excluded. Furthermore, six studies were excluded after the
abstract review (five were not human studies and one was not
relevant to BAL-GM test). Eventually, 38 studies were retrieved for
further evaluation. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
30 studies[23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,
41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52] were ultimately included for
this meta-analysis. The remaining studies were excluded because of
lack of sufficient data (n = 3)[53,54,55], duplicate publications
(n = 2)[56,57], other diagnosis standard (n = 2)[58,59] and fewer
than 20 patients (n = 1)60].
The main characteristics of the studies included in the metaanalysis are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1. We
included 23 cohort studies and 7 case–control studies. No
randomized study was included. A total of 3344 patients or
control cases were included, of whom 614 (18.4%) patients were
diagnosed with proven or probable IA. The STARD score of each
study varied from 10 to 21. The included studies were mainly
performed in American, European and Asian countries. Fourteen
studies were prospectively designed and seven were case-control
studies. The index cutoff of BAL-GM varied from 0.5 to 8.0 in
individual studies. The most common value of cutoff was 0.5.
Quality assessment is shown with a bar graph according to the
QUADAS-2 tool in Figure 2.
BAL-GM for patients with proven or probable IA
Of all the included studies, 24 studies [23,24,25,26,27,28,29,
30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,39,40,41,42,44,47,48,49,50] provided the
BAL-GM diagnostic data with a cutoff value of 0.5. Heterogeneity
in sensitivities and specificities were observed among the studies
(Q-test = 78.35, P,0.01, I
2= 0.65% and Q-test = 140.39, P,0.01,
I
2= 83.20%), which indicated significant heterogeneity for these
included studies. The mean DOR was 52.7 (95% CI 31.8–87.3).
The pooled SEN was 0.87 (95% CI 0.79–0.92) while the pooled
SPE was 0.89 (95% CI 0.85–0.92) (Figure 3, Figure S1). Figure 4
(The corresponding between numbers and the studies could be
found in Supplementary Table S2) presents the SROC curve for
the including studies. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.94
(95% CI 0.92–0.96). The pooled PLR and NLR were 8.0 (95% CI
5.7–11.1) and 0.15 (95% CI 0.10–0.23) respectively(Figure S2, S3,
S4, S5, and S6).
The proportion of heterogeneity likely due to threshold effect
was 44%, which meant a moderate influence of a diagnostic
threshold effect. However, the Spearman correlation coefficient
was 0.313 and the P value was 0.136. To explore other potential
heterogeneities, meta-regression and subgroup meta-analysis were
conducted (Figure 5). Overall, the test performances varied by
patient population, study design and drug treatment. The pooled
SEN and SPE were 0.85 (95% CI 0.78–0.93) and 0.89 (95% CI
0.85–0.94) for studies Cohort designed respectively. The pooled
SEN of BAL GM test for patients who were given the antibiotic
and antifungal treatment were 0.85 (95% CI 0.76–0.94) and 0.85
(95% CI 0.78–0.92), while the pooled SEP were 0.86 (95% CI
0.80–0.92) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.85–0.94) respectively. The pooled
SEN changed significantly with some covariates, such as study
design(cohort and consecutive), antibiotics using, sample numbers
and neutropenia status. The pooled SEP changed significantly
with some covariates which are study design(cohort, consecutive,
prospective and blinded), patients status(age, hematologic malignancy and neutropenia), treatment(antifungal and antibiotics) and
financial support. More detail data is in Supplementary Table S3.
The Fagan plot demonstrated that the BAL-GM test raised the
probability of IA from 17% to 62% and decreased the probability

to 3% when negative (Figure 6). According to the Deek’s funnel
plot asymmetry test, the p value was less than 0.01 for the slope
coefficient, which showed there was a high likelihood of
publication bias (Figure 7).
Twenty one [24,25,27,28,29,30,32,36,39,40,41,42,43,44,46,
47,48,49,50,51], ten[24,25,30,36,39,41,44,48,49,52], eight [24,25,
36,39,41,44,48,49] and six [24,36,39,44,48,49] studies demonstrated the BAL-GM diagnostic data with a cutoff value of 1.0, 1.5,
2.0 and 2.5 respectively. The mean DOR, pooled SEN, SPE,
PLR, NLR and the AUC were summarized in table 2.
BAL-GM for patients with proven IA
Of the studies that investigated BAL-GM for diagnosing proven
IA, Only 12 studies [23,25,28,29,33,35,36,41,44,45,48,49] reported the data with a cutoff value of 0.5. The mean DOR was 8233
(95% CI 4.7–143631.6). The pooled SEN and SPE were 1.00
(95% CI 0.55–1.00) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.64–0.86) respectively.
The AUC was 0.93. The pooled PLR was 4.3 (95% CI 2.7–6.8)
while the pooled NLR was 0.00 (95% CI 0.00–1.03).
The percentage of heterogeneity likely due to threshold effect
was 10%, indicating a slight in£uence. Meta-regression and
subgroup meta-analysis were performed, showing only the study
design and diagnostic standard varied the test performances. The
pooled SPE, which were lower with those covariates, were 0.67
(95% CI 0.51–0.84) and 0.71(95% CI 0.57–0.85) for prospective
studies and studies using the revised EORTC/MSG criteria as
gold standard respectively.

The Fagan plot demonstrated that the BAL-GM test raised the
probability of IA threefold when results were positive and
decreased the probability to 0% when negative. According to
the Deek’s funnel plot, no publication bias was found (p= 0.06,
figures not shown).
A few studies investigated the BAL-GM diagnostic data with a
cutoff value of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 respectively. The mean DOR,
pooled SEN, SPE, PLR, NLR and the AUC were summarized in
table 2.
Comparison the diagnostic accuracy of serum GM and
BAL-GM for patients with IA
Sixteen articles
[23,25,26,28,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,39,44,48,49,51] reported both
the serum GM and BAL-GM test (cutoff value 0.5) diagnostic data
for the proven or probable IA vs. possible or no IA. The pooled
SEN of serum GM and BAL-GM test were 0.65 (95% CI 0.54–
0.75) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.72–0.92), while the pooled SPE were
0.95 (95% CI 0.90–0.97) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.78–0.92) respectively
(Figure 8, Forest plots of SEN and SPE were in additional file).
Eight studies [23,25,33,35,44,45,49,51] demonstrated both diagnostic data for the proven vs. probable or IA possible or no
IA(Figure S7, S8, and S9).
Comparison the diagnostic accuracy of PCR and BAL-GM
for patients with IA
Of all the studies included in the review, only eight papers
[23,27,29,43,46,50,52,57] including nine studies evaluated the
diagnostic accuracy of PCR and BAL-GM test for prove or
probable IA. Four studies [23,26,27,50] reported the BAL-GM
diagnostic data with a cutoff value of 0.5 while the others
[29,43,46,50,52] with 1.0. The pooled SEN of BAL-GM (0.5 and
1.0) and PCR were 0.78 (95% CI 0.67–0.87), 0.94 (95% CI 0.68–
0.99) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.61–0.93), while the pooled SPE were
0.91 (95% CI 0.84–0.95), 0.97 (95% CI 0.91–0.99) and 0.98 (95%
CI 0.85–1.00) respectively(Figure 9, Figure S10).

Meta-Analysis of BAL-GM for Diagnosing IA
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e43347

Discussion
IA remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
immunosuppressed patients[61]. As pulmonary involvement is a
hallmark of IA[24], culture or direct microscopic examination of
BAL fluid is widely used for evaluation of patients with suspected
IA [62]. However, these two methods are limited because they are
time-consuming and may produce falsely negative results[11].
Since it is difficult to diagnose IA, many tests have been developed
to overcome this problem, including the Platelia GM enzyme
immunoassay(Bio-Rad)[10]. Although the kit have been approved
by the FDA in 2003 for use with patients with neutropenia and
undergoing stem cell transplantation, controversy still exists[1].
To explorer the accuracy of BAL-GM test for diagnosing IA
according to the EORTC/MSG definitions or similar criteria, the
results of 30 studies were included and analyzed in this metaanalysis. In all, we came to the conclusion that BAL-GM test was
an appropriate technique for diagnosing IA, using the cutoff value
of 1.0. Compared with GM detection in serum, BAL-GM test has
a higher SEN but a lower SPE, and with PCR assay, BAL-GM test
has a higher SEN and a similar SPE. Although Guo et al[12] have
performed a systematic review that evaluated the accuracy of
BAL-GM in diagnosing IA, this review included more clinical
studies and evaluated the head-to-head comparison of the
accuracy of serum GM test, PCR assay and BAL-GM.
Guo et al[12], in which proven or probable IA vs. possible or no
IA cases were analyzed, performed meta-analysis and obtained a
high accuracy, with both the SEN and SPE $90%. However, with
the different cutoff value, the increasing threshold form 0.5 to 2
decreased the pooled SEN from 0.86 to 0.61, and increased the
pooled SPE from 0.89 to 0.96. Comparing with the pooled SEN
and SPE in Guo’s study, this current meta-analysis obtained a
similar SEN and SPE with the cutoff value of 0.5 and 1.0, but a
higher SEN and similar SPE with the cutoff value of 1.5 and 2.0,
in which the pooled SEN and SPE were from 0.87 to 0.84 and
0.89 to 0.95 respectively. This higher SEN may have resulted from
more studies included. Likelihood ratios are also investigated as a
metric that incorporate both the SEN and SPE in this systematic
review. It has been suggested that a PLR more than 10 and NLR
less than 0.1 provides convincing diagnostic evidence, and a PLR
more than 5 and NLR less than 0.2 provides strong diagnostic
evidence to rule in/rule out diagnoses respectively in most
circumstances[20,63]. The conclusion of Guo’s meta-analysis
showed that the PLR and NLR succeeded in passing the threshold
index and provided convincing diagnostic evidence to rule in/rule
out IA with the result of overall analyses. However no results of
meta-analyses with different cutoff values passed. Our metaFigure 8. Summary ROC plot of SEN and SPE of serum GM and BAL-GM. (Dotted ellipses around the spots represent the 95% CI around the

analyses got the similar PLR and NLR with Guo’s, but only strong
diagnostic evidence was suggested based on results of individual
meta-analysis. Apart from SEN, SPE, AUC, PLR and NLR, we
also reported another indicator of test performance, which is
DOR. The DOR combines the strengths of SEN and SPE and has
the advantage of accuracy as a single indicator[17]. Not only are
the DORs estimated by classic meta-analytic approach, but also
DORs are produced by bivariate approach. Bivariate approach
was used in this meta-analysis because it maintains any correlation
between SEN and SPE, while conventional meta-analysis splits the
assessment of these at study level[18]. The DOR varied from 52.7
to 143.4 with different cutoff values, which were all high.
According to results mentioned above, the optimal cutoff value
was not 0.5 but 1.0, because, compared to 0.5, it has higher DOR,
SPE and PLR, and similar SEN and NLR.
Serum GM has been approved by FDA for diagnosing IA[64],
and meta-analysis found it was moderately useful for surveillance
of IA in patients with hematological malignancy or hematological
transplant recipients[65]. Studies showed that BAL-GM test was
superior than serum GM test, however, no direct meta-analysis of
comparison of serum GM and BAL-GM has been done. This
study firstly performed comparison of serum GM and BAL-GM
test by meta-analysis, and the results showed that, for proven and
probable IA, the pooled SEN and SPE of serum GM were 0.65
(95% CI 0.54–0.75) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90–0.97) respectively.
The results of summary estimates of serum GM were similar to the
meta-analysis conducted by Pfeiffer et al[65]. Compared with
serum GM, BAL-GM has a higher SEN [0.85 (95% CI 0.72–
0.92)] and lower SPE [0.86 (95% CI 0.78–0.92)]. The higher SEN
of BAL-GM test may have two reasons. One is that the bronchial
tree of patients with pulmonary IA, which is the most common
presentation of IA, has a larger fungal burden. The other one is
that hyphae secrete more quantities of antigenic GM than
conidia[42,56]. The lower SPE may result from that the airway
and vascular compartments are involved in different stages of
disease[28]. Studies have showed that the appearance of GM in
the BAL fluid correlated with the airway cellular invasion of
Aspergillus[66], while the presence of GM in serum correlates with
the later penetration of hyphae through the endothelial cell
layer[66,67]. So it is suggested that BAL-GM and serum GM
testing are complementary based on the our meta-analysis.
PCR assay for the detection of fungal nucleic acids in BAL fluid
was investigated. Studies indicated that PCR had variable SEN
which ranged from 40 to 100% [23,26,27,29,43,46,50,52]. The
variety may be due to differences in assay characteristics, certainty
of diagnosis and types of patients evaluated[50]. More and more
studies evaluated PCR on BAL fluid for diagnosing IA, however
lack of standard assay platform hampered its wide use. To our

knowledge, this systematic review is also the first study which
conducted meta-analysis of comparison of PCR assay and BALGM test for diagnosing IA. In contrast to BAL-GM with the cutoff
value of 0.5, PCR has a slight higher SEN and a significant higher
SPE. Compared with BAL-GM (cutoff value 1.0), PCR displays a
lower SEN and a similar SPE. One of questionable points in this
part of study are the increasing threshold of BAL-GM test from 0.5
to 1.0 increased the SEN from 0.78 to 0.94. It may be because of
study designed, type of patients evaluated or other biases. So more
high quality, well-designed studies are needed to estimate the
comparison between PCR assay and BAL-GM test for diagnosing
IA.
This current study shows that BAL-GM has a better capacity for
diagnosing IA than both serum GM test and PCR assay test, but it
has its own inherent limitations. The high SEN of BAL-GM might
be counterbalanced by the occurrence of false positive results[45].
False negativity has been reported in several studies[34,41,54] and
is a major drawback of this technique[54]. Firstly, the b-lactam
antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, which are likely to be given to the patients, have been
reported to caused false positive results at different rates[54].
Secondly, it is reported that some fungi contained cross-reactive
GM[68,69]. Last but not least, some other factors such as
antifungal prophylaxis, airway colonization with Aspergillus species
and even laboratory contamination may result in false positive
results[41]. So physicians should be aware of the false positive
results mentioned above when interpreting GM results.
There are several limitations to our study. First, significant
heterogeneity existed in most of the analyses. To investigate the
sources of heterogeneity, sensitivity, subgroup and meta-regression
analyses were performed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after
deleting the studies with outlier results[30,33,36,37,44], however,
the heterogeneity still exist and the pooled results has slight
changes. The subgroup and meta-regression analyses found some
study characteristics including patients status, age, study design,
reference criteria, antibiotic and antifungal treatment that account
for the heterogeneity. The difference in patient status had
statistical significance for the SEN and the difference in age,
study design and reference criteria had statistical significance for
the SPE. Despite this, most of the pooled SEN and SPE were still
above 85%, indicating that BAL-GM test has excellent accuracy.
Secondly, although we search the studies published in any
languages, we didn’t search for unpublished data. Diagnostic
studies are easy to undertake and are not usually recorded on
research registries, so it is difficult for researchers to search for
unpublished data[70]. Therefore, some missing and unpublished
data might not have been included in the current study, which
may have overestimated the pooled results. Thirdly, misclassification bias can occur[12]. At present, the gold standard for the
diagnosis of Aspergillus infection is isolation and culture of the
organisms in the laboratory[71], but it is limited by complications
and low SEN. According to the reference criteria which most of
included studies used, the proven and probable IA were not
diagnosed by either cytopathologic and histopathologic examination. So it is unavoidable that the accuracy of diagnosis cause
misclassification and discrepancy, which resulted in biased results.
Conclusions
In summary, despite the limitations mentioned above, this
current systematic review suggests that the BAL-GM test is a useful
adjunct in the diagnosis of IA and the optimal cutoff value is 1.0.
The BAL-GM test has higher SEN compared to PCR and serum
GM test with the cutoff value of 1.0.
