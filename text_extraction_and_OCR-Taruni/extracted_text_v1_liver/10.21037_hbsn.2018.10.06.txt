Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the 
second most frequent cause of cancer-related death globally. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents nearly 90% 
of primary liver cancers, and constitutes a major health 
problem worldwide (1). When diagnosed at an early stage 
of the disease, HCC may benefit from potentially curative 
treatments such as liver resection, liver transplantation 
or local ablation. Despite effectiveness of treatment in 
early and very early stages, most patients are diagnosed or 
progress to an intermediate or advanced stage, in which 
treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor (2). 
Up to now the only systemic therapy in first line that 
has shown to confer survival advantage in patients with 
advanced HCC is sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor 
(3,4). Sorafenib has become the reference treatment for 
HCC patients in the advanced stage of the disease, and in 
those patients at the intermediate stage refractory or not 
amenable to locoregional treatments (5). However, the 
survival advantage provided by sorafenib is relatively small 
(in the range of 2–3 months), radiological responses are 
rare and discontinuation and dose reduction of the drug 
are frequently necessary because of adverse events such as 
diarrhoea, fatigue, and hand-foot skin reaction (3,4). 
Radioembolization (RE) with yttrium-90 (90Y) 
microspheres is a form of brachytherapy delivered via the 
hepatic artery, that allows targeted delivery of high-dose 
radiation to liver tumours. Several retrospective and large 
cohort studies showed an acceptable safety profile of RE, 
and good results in terms of local control of the disease 
and long-term survival in patients with unresectable HCC 
limited to the liver in the intermediate and advanced stages 
(6-8). No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing 
the efficacy of RE with respect to sorafenib had been 
published until recently, and as a consequence RE is still not 
recommended in international guidelines.
SIRveNIB (selective internal radiation therapy vs.
sorafenib) is a recently published open-label phase III trial 
that compared 90Y-resin microspheres RE with sorafenib 
800 mg/d in patients with locally advanced HCC, in a 
two-tailed study designed for superiority/detriment; the 
primary end point was overall survival (OS). The trial 
randomised 360 patients (182 to RE, 178 to sorafenib) 
across 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The study 
failed to meet the primary endpoint: in fact, median OS in 
the intention-to-treat population was 8.8 and 10.0 months 
with RE and sorafenib, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.1; 
95% CI: 0.9–1.4; P=0.36). Similarly, no differences in OS 
were demonstrated in the treated population (11.3 and 
10.4 months in the RE and sorafenib arms, respectively, 
P=0.27), nor in subgroup analyses. Tumor response rates 
(TRR) were significantly higher in the RE arm, however 
disease control rates were similar and no differences in 
progression-free survival were observed. Fewer patients in 
the RE group (20.8%) than in the sorafenib group (35.2%) 
had serious AEs, and mean duration of side effects was 
shorter in the RE arm. These results, however, did not

translate into significant differences in patients’ quality of 
life since the EQ-5D index between the RE and sorafenib 
groups was similar throughout the study (9).
The SARAH trial (SorAfenib versus Radioembolization 
in Advanced Hepatocellular carcinoma) enrolled 467 
patients (237 RE, 222 sorafenib) from 25 centers in France. 
Similiarly to SIRveNIB, it was a phase III trial designed for 
superiority that compared 90Y-resin microspheres RE with 
sorafenib 800 mg/d in patients with locally advanced HCC. 
Also this Western-based trial failed to meet the primary 
endpoint since median OS was 8.0 months in the RE group 
vs. 9.9 months in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio, 1.15; 
95% CI: 0.94–1.41; P=0.18) (10). 
As stated elsewhere, failure of rejecting the null 
hypothesis in a superiority trial should be distinguished 
from the concept used in a non-inferiority trial, in which a 
non-inferiority margin is set a priori and generally larger 
sample sizes are needed (11). Consequently, neither the 
results of SIRveNIB nor the results of SARAH trials could 
be instrumental to claim for an equivalency between RE and 
sorafenib. Thus, how should the results of these two recent 
RTCs be interpreted in the light of the previously published 
studies and clinical experience, that showed a promising 
efficacy of RE even if at a lower level of evidence? Should 
RE be abandoned as a treatment for HCC or should it be 
pursued in some specific subsets of patients? To answer 
these questions, we think that the difficulties and potential 
biases undermining trials that compare an interventional 
procedure (RE) to a drug (sorafenib) should be carefully 
analysed. 
Radioembolization is a sophisticated technical procedure 
that requires high skills and a multidisciplinary management 
involving several medical and non-medical figures, after 
a considerable learning curve. The expertise in managing 
such treatment might have been highly heterogeneous 
in both the SIRveNIB trial (which was conducted at 11 
centers, among which only 5 had facilities to perform RE) 
and the SARAH trial (which was conducted at 25 centers). 
Most of the cohort studies reporting promising results of 
RE were conducted on single center series, from highly 
experienced centers (12): the relatively poor results of RE in 
both RCTs might be partially explained by a diluting effect 
of the multicentricity of the design, with some contributing 
centres having little experience of administering RE. In such 
view, a subgroup analysis evaluating the results according to 
center expertise or number of procedures performed might 
have helped to clarify this issue. 
Considering that RE is a form of radiotherapy, 
dosimetric considerations should be further elucidated. In 
the two RCTs, the planned activity and dose 90Y treatment 
were based on the body surface area: no endpoints regarding 
tumour-absorbed dose and liver-absorbed dose were planned, 
while a clear tumour dose-response relationship with glass 
microspheres had been demonstrated in several studies (13). 
In both the SIRveNIB and the SARAH trial, patients 
waited after randomization a median time of 21 and 29 days 
to receive RE, and a median time of 3 and 7 days to receive 
sorafenib respectively. This discrepancy of nearly 3 weeks 
of “no treatment” between the two treatment arms was 
not accounted in the ITT nor in the per-protocol analyses, 
which calculate OS from the time of randomization. In the 
view of post-treatment survival, this is a lead time likely to 
impact on patients with a short life expectancy. Moreover, in 
both trials there were more patients who did not receive the 
assigned treatment in the RE than in the sorafenib group. 
This discrepancy was partially explained by the fact that 
some patients had worsening of the disease during the preRE work-up that contraindicated SIRT, and clearly acted as 
a negative selection bias. 
Finally, the appropriate population in which a benefit of 
RE over sorafenib could be shown still needs to be defined. 
The most promising results of RE had been observed in 
cohort studies focused only on a specific population, such 
as patients with HCC and tumoral portal vein thrombosis 
(PVT) (8,12). A local treatment such as RE, as well as 
surgical resection, demonstrated to be particularly effective 
in those patients with PVT limited to primary or secondary 
order branches of the portal vein, and less or noneffective in 
patients with occlusion of the main portal trunk (12,14,15). 
In both the SIRveNIB and SARAH trials, subgroup analyses 
did not demonstrate a significant survival benefit in patients 
with PVT undergoing RE. Apart from being underpowered 
by definition, subgroup analyses in both studies were not 
designed to target survival differences according to PVT 
extension. To better evaluate the effectiveness of first-line 
RE with respect to sorafenib in the specific subset of HCC 
patients with PVT, only one RCT (Yes-p, NCT01887717) 
was run but it was prematurely terminated because of poor 
accrual. In retrospective the Yes-p, would it be supported in 
its premise by both interventional radiology and oncology 
communities, remains the only study with intact hypothesis 
of superiority of RE over sorafenib. 
In conclusion, the SIRveNIB and the SARAH trial failed 
to prove a superiority of RE over sorafenib in patients with 
advanced HCC. However, these trials were pivotal since 
they were the first RCTs confirming the safety and efficacy

of RE in patients with locally advanced HCCs. Both studies 
suggested that RE might be better tolerated than sorafenib 
in that patients, and these results are in line with what is 
felt by most clinicians dealing with RE. A clear superiority 
of RE with respect to sorafenib in inducing tumor response 
was confirmed: the reasons why such a result did not 
translate into a benefit in OS nor in PFS should be probably 
researched in a better and more restrictive patients selection for 
the procedure. In particular, until new trials will be designed, 
we think that the results of large cohort studies demonstrating 
that RE provides a significant survival benefit in patients with 
HCC and PVT (12) should not be disregarded because of the 
present two negative RCTs, that included a broader spectrum 
of intermediate and advanced HCC patients.
