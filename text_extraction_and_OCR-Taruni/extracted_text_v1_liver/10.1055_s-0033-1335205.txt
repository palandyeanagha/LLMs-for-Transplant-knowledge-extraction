Introduction
!
Palpation is an ancient diagnostic technique. It is
mentioned in the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus
dating from the seventeenth century B. C. [1],
and Hippocrates was reported to use it for battle
injuries, identifying that if the bone is not visible
then palpation can assist in locating the weapon
mark and, for head injuries, determine whether
the cranium beneath the flesh is strong or weak.
Palpation is of course still valuable and is essentially used in the same way that it has been for
thousands of years, both clinically and in self-examination. Tactile feedback is also a seamless,
routine and essential component of effective surgery. However, its application is limited to accessible organs, it provides limited disease detectability and spatial discrimination, and the
interpretation of the information is subjective.
Elastography, the science of creating noninvasive
images of mechanical characteristics of tissues,
aims to overcome these limitations and has been
rapidly evolving in recent years. Therefore, in
2011 the European Federation for Ultrasound in
Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) felt the need to
develop a set of recommendations for the use of
elastography, given the growing general interest,
number of available techniques and level of scientific evidence in this field, following a process
similar to that utilized for Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound [2, 3]. The steering committee formed in
2011 selected the topics to be included and invited a team of experts with significant publication
records and skill in the field, from throughout
Europe. The manuscript, which was prepared by
e-mail and telephone communication, was discussed in a consensus meeting held in Bologna in
September 2012.
The project was partially supported by the ultrasound industry, as mentioned in the acknowledgements. The industry, however, had no influence in deciding the content of the manuscript,
which is solely under the responsibility of the authors.

Abstract
!
The technical part of these Guidelines and Recommendations, produced under the auspices of EFSUMB, provides an introduction to the physical
principles and technology on which all forms of
current commercially available ultrasound elastography are based. A difference in shear modulus is
the common underlying physical mechanism that
provides tissue contrast in all elastograms. The
relationship between the alternative technologies
is considered in terms of the method used to take
advantage of this. The practical advantages and
disadvantages associated with each of the techniques are described, and guidance is provided
on optimisation of scanning technique, image display, image interpretation and some of the known
image artefacts.

The current set of guidelines is divided into two parts. Part 1,
which follows below, introduces the technical background and
principles. This is important since various different techniques
exist which may all be described as elastography, and yet each
operates in a different way and might therefore have different applications. Part 2 [4] reports the main clinical applications of the
various elastographic methods as of 2013 and is published in the
next issue of this journal. EFSUMB hopes these recommendations
will help users and would-be users of elastography to understand
the basic principles and limitations of the method, and to apply it
and successfully interpret the findings across the most commonly used clinical applications.
Despite the plethora of different elastography methods that have
become available they all aim to display contrast for, or measure
quantities related to, the shear elastic modulus of tissue (described on p. 171 and in the online appendix). In this sense, all of
the methods are unified, justifying the use of the common term,
elastography. A second unifying feature is in the signal processing
used; for all of the methods in common use the signal processing
to create an elasticity measurement or image begins with an ultrasound measurement of time-varying tissue displacement. The
methods are then classified according to what they do with this
measurement, either displaying it directly as the imaged quantity, using it to calculate and display strain, or using it to calculate
and display an image of shear-wave speed. The last of these is a
quantitative image and is the only one that requires the creation
of a shear-wave, which in turn requires the use of a dynamic
force. The others may use a dynamic force but can also work
with a static, or nearly static, force. All of these terms will be explained in this article.
Basic principles of elastography
!
The mechanical properties sensed by palpation and elastography
are associated with the elastic restoring forces in the tissue that
act against a type of deformation (shape change) known as shear.
Two types of shear may be defined. Referring to ●
" Fig. 1: in a
“simple shear” results from a simple shearing force (arrow) such
as that applied to displace a single location on or within the body
– an object of square cross-section (dashed outline) is deformed
to one that has a trapezoid cross-section (solid outline) without a
change in its volume. b depicts “pure shear”, resulting from a
compressive force (arrows) such as that applied to displace the
whole surface of the body – the same object as in a will be compressed axially (vertically), resulting in a lateral (horizontal) expansion that conserves volume (solid outline). In the case of
pure shear, the shearing nature of the deformation is less obvious
than in the case of simple shear. It can be seen, however, by observing the deformation of an element of the medium that has a
different shape to the rectangular grid normally used to illustrate
the lateral expansion that is created when an incompressible
medium is compressed axially. The inner diamond (dotted outline) in the undeformed case in b is a shape that is useful for visually revealing pure shear; the shear deformation becomes apparent if one rotates the deformed element (the flattened
diamond drawn with the solid outline) so that its bottom-left
boundary is parallel to that of the undeformed element, and if
one then rotates the whole diagram clockwise by 45 degrees, as
shown in c. The actual tissue deformations generated in elastography are more complex than these simple idealisations, although those produced by acoustic radiation force most closely
approximate simple shear and those produced by using the ultrasound transducer to displace the tissue surface most closely approximate pure shear.
No method directly images the shear elastic properties of tissue;
elastography methods use an existing modality, such as ultrasound, to observe the internal tissue deformations that occur in
response to an applied force, and convert the resulting information to a suitable form for display. A wide variety of approaches
has evolved, both for applying the force and for measuring and
displaying the tissue’s response.
Elastography uses ultrasonic imaging to observe tissue shear deformation under conditions of one or both of the types of shear
illustrated in ●
" Fig. 1, currently in a real-time two-dimensional
image sequence, after applying a force that is either dynamic (e.
g. by thumping or vibrating) or varying so slowly that it is considered “quasi-static” (e. g. by probe palpation). The deformation
may be represented in an elasticity image (elastogram), or as a local measurement, in one of three ways:
1. tissue displacement may be detected and displayed directly, as
in the method known as acoustic radiation force impulse
(ARFI) imaging,
2. tissue strain (defined on p. 174) may be calculated and displayed, producing what is termed strain elastography (SE), or
3. in the dynamic case only, the data may be used to record the
propagation of shear-waves, which are used to calculate either
a) regional values of their speed (without making images)
using methods referred to herein as transient elastography
(TE) and point shear-wave elastography (pSWE), or
b) images of their speed using methods referred to herein as
shear-wave elastography (SWE) which includes 2 D SWE
and 3 D SWE.
These shear-wave speed methods could all be grouped under the
term SWE. However, the literature uses SWE to describe methods
that make images of shear-wave speed using excitation by acoustic radiation force, which is a convention broadly used in this paper. For the same reason, the term pSWE has been used for the
(non-imaging) regional measurement of shear-wave speed using
acoustic radiation force excitation, even though the term ARFI
quantification has been used in the literature to describe this
method.

outline) so that its bottom-left boundary is parallel to that of the undeformed element, and then rotating the whole diagram clockwise by 45
degrees (see the text for a more detailed description). (Inspired by Steven

ARFI, SE, TE, pSWE and SWE are explained in detail below. Elastograms may be displayed separately from B-mode scans, or the
two superimposed, using colour to distinguish them.
Shear propagation in soft tissues
!
In this section the relationship between ultrasonic imaging and
elastography is explained.
In ultrasonic imaging [5–11] a varying pressure at the tissue surface causes a change in density, and both perturbations travel together as a longitudinal wave (●
" Fig. 2). Its speed cl (about
1540 ms–1), is determined almost entirely by the tissue’s density
ρ and the bulk modulus of elasticity K (see the online appendix
for equations). The image shows the strengths of echoes, which
are produced by local variations in ρ or K, as a function of tissue
depth estimated from the time of the echo and the value of cl
.
In elastography a directional force is applied to the tissue (arrows
in●
" Fig. 1), which causes shear deformation that propagates as a
shear-wave. An example corresponding to simple shear is shown
in●
" Fig. 3 (shear propagation in reality can be much more complex than this, as described on p. 182 and in the online appendix).
In an ideal situation (an elastically homogeneous medium of infinite spatial extent) the speed of propagation cs of the (transverse) shear-wave is determined by ρ and the shear elastic modulus G. Because in soft tissues G is much smaller than K, shearwaves travel about 1000 times slower than longitudinal waves,
typically in the range 1 – 10 ms1 (see appendix). Unlike longitudinal waves, at ultrasonic frequencies shear-waves are attenuated
rapidly in soft tissue. Hence very low frequencies, often below
1 kHz (which includes static deformations), must be used for
elastography. Importantly, non viscous pure fluids do not propagate shear-waves.
When an ultrasound transducer is used to displace the tissue surface, this is referred to as a quasi-static compression. It generates
a complex pattern of shear deformation, consisting of both pure
and simple shear (●
" Fig. 1), that propagates at speed cs, and can
be regarded as equivalent to a static compression so long as the
palpation rate is slow relative to the propagation time to the
depth of interest.
Why can elastograms be made from ultrasound images?
It is a fortunate coincidence of nature that the above key differences in the propagation properties of longitudinal and shearwaves combine helpfully to make ultrasound elastography possible:
▶ Speckle, ubiquitous in soft tissue ultrasound images, arises
from diffusely distributed variations in K and ρ, and provides
image markers that follow the shear deformations.
▶ The relatively low attenuation of ultrasound allows high-frequency (and hence high resolution) ultrasound imaging,
which can detect tiny shear-wave displacements and resolve
differences in the motion of neighbouring tissue elements.
▶ The relatively high speed of ultrasound allows echo data to be
acquired rapidly enough to observe the tissue displacements
at clearly defined phases of the shear deformation.
Tissue shear properties for elasticity imaging
Measurements of the shear modulus G, and its close relative
Young’s modulus E (see online appendix), may be made noninvasively if one can monitor the displacements of the tissue-elements as a function of time as a shear-wave passes multiple
points along its path. For example, in TE and SWE, G is obtained

from shear-wave speed measured as the difference in shearwave arrival time at two or more points separated by known distances.
In addition, both the percentage deformation (known as strain)
and the displacement generated are directly dependent on the
value of G for a given force, and both have been employed, in different elastography techniques, to display tissue shear modulus
contrast. A common technique is to apply a uniaxial force to the
tissue, and to use ultrasound to measure and map the resulting
displacement. In some techniques displacement is displayed directly as an image. As explained on p. 179, this is convenient
when the displacement is highly localised, such as in ARFI displacement imaging, but where the whole top surface of the
body is displaced it is better to convert the internal tissue displacements to a strain image since, for this situation in a homogeneous medium, strain will be constant whereas displacement decays with depth.
Although a dynamic force is mandatory for generating a shearwave and thus measuring or imaging its speed (as in SWE),
when imaging displacement or strain the force may be dynamic,
quasi-static or static. Usually the force is not known, and neither
are the positions of, or friction at, the tissue boundaries. As a result, techniques that display images of displacement or strain do
not produce values for G. Nevertheless, they generate image contrast that is directly related to G, albeit with influences of other
factors that create artefacts that need to be understood. The
SWE images also contain artefacts, as described on p. 181.
Biological tissues are much more complicated than the above description which assumes a linearly elastic, homogeneous, isotropic, infinite, continuous medium. The practical situation departs
from these assumptions in that:
a) the force-deformation relationship is usually both nonlinear
and time dependent (the latter due to the phenomena of viscoelasticity and poroelasticity, described in the online appendix),
b) elasticity, in fact, varies spatially and with direction (a phenomenon known as anisotropy – see the online appendix),
c) tissue boundaries and structure change the relationship between shear-wave speed and G, due to the phenomena of
guided shear-wave propagation and shear-wave scattering
(see the online appendix), and
d) tissues may be rendered mechanically discontinuous by anatomical features such as fluid collections, organ or tumour
boundaries, and scars.
All these can produce artefacts in the current generation of elastography techniques. Current research aims to take account of
them, to gain additional information and to afford elastography
the ability to image new tissue characteristics, providing considerable potential for future evolution of elastography.
What makes elastograms different from ultrasound
images?
While the bulk modulus K varies by little more than 12 % over the
whole range of soft tissues, the shear modulus G varies by a factor
of more than 105. This provides the potential for images with enormous tissue contrast, if they can be made with relatively good
signal to noise ratio [12]. Furthermore, the speed and absorption
of ultrasound waves in soft tissue are largely determined at the
molecular fluid level. Shear stress is not sustained by fluids, and
is transmitted by the connected structural matrix within tissues
(extracellular matrix, microvasculature, membranes, etc.). The
integrity of this matrix, and the tension placed upon it by microvascular and interstitial pressure, are important for shear-wave
propagation, but not for the generation of ultrasound echoes.
Technology of ultrasound elastography
The various current commercially available ultrasound elastographic methods (●
" Table 1) may be complementary, particularly
in relation to the shear properties of tissues that each is most suited to evaluate. They possess different physical performance
properties, artefacts, limitations and suitability for specific clinical applications.
Tissue displacement estimation
!
All current commercial elastography systems need to measure
tissue displacement. The various systems differ in how the displacement is used; it may be imaged directly, converted to strain,
or used to detect the time of arrival of shear-waves and hence
their speed. The most common methods in use for elastography,
RF echo correlation-based tracking and Doppler processing, are
described in●
" Fig. 4, but tracking of the echo envelope and the
echo-envelope fluctuation rate can also be used [13]. An axial
displacement image is formed by generating a displacement-versus-depth line for all RF A-lines in a two-dimensional (2 D) echo
image sequence, where each line is obtained by repeating the
process explained in ●
" Fig. 4 for multiple (usually overlapping)
reference windows or Doppler gates at different depths. Echocorrelation tracking may also be implemented in the lateral diDoppler shift

Fig. 4 The two main methods for estimating displacement used in elastography are RF-echo correlation tracking and Doppler processing. In this
illustration, stress is applied to the tissue such that an axially compressive
strain, that is constant with depth, is successively generated in equal
amounts from one RF-echo image to the next; the echo signals shown
represent the evolution of the same RF-echo line over 5 images. Doppler
processing uses the correlation between a gated region of the RF-echo
signal and the same region in the same echo line at a previous time to
measure displacement. RF echo-tracking explores a search window (pink)
to locate the position of the echo pattern that best correlates with that in a
reference window (yellow) within the echo line at a previous time; the shift
required to maximise this correlation is the required axial displacement, dx.

3 The term “real time” has been avoided here as, unlike real-time ultrasonography (and as explained in the text), the elastography systems described in this paper are not yet suitable
for rapid searching through large volumes nor for observing rapid tissue motion within a sequence of elastograms.
4 The term shear-wave elastography (SWE) has been used here according to the current literature, where it refers to methods that make images of shear-wave speed using radiation
force excitation. Thus it includes 2 D SWE and 3 D SWE. The term point shear-wave elastography (pSWE) has been used for the method where a regional average only (no image) of
shear-wave speed is measured using radiation force excitation. This emphasises that it is essentially a SWE method, even though in the literature it has been referred to as ARFI
quantification. Transient elastography (TE) also measures shear-wave speed without creating an image but, since it uses a surface mechanical force rather than acoustic radiation
force, it has not been classified here under the term SWE.

rection, and be extended to 2 D reference and search windows (or
even 3 D, for data available from 4 D probes). The lateral displacements that this is designed to follow are measured with much
poorer precision than the axial displacements, due to the lack of
availability of echo phase information. Nevertheless, such tracking is helpful for noise reduction in axial displacement measurement, as described on p. 174.
When stress is applied to tissue, whether static or dynamic,
strains occurs and the echoes do not remain correlated, which
creates displacement noise – the greater the strain, the greater
this decorrelation-induced displacement noise. Under the condition that tissue is nearly incompressible, axial compression results in lateral expansion and thus lateral displacement, which
adds to this noise. Substantial decorrelation noise also occurs in
freehand tissue compression (used in SE, described on p. 174) if
the probe motion is not solely axial, for example, if it rotates or
moves across the tissue either laterally or in elevation. As a result,
estimating displacement from 1 D (axial) tracking with minimal
noise requires careful probe motion in a uniaxial direction only,
and careful choice of palpation rate, RF-frame acquisition rate,
and the sizes of the reference and search windows. In current
elastography systems 2 D tracking is used to improve the precision of axial displacement estimates by reducing decorrelation
noise due to lateral expansion and probe motion; 3 D tracking is
needed to do the same in the elevation direction. Each manufacturer also tends to implement its own preferred method for displacement image optimization.
Quasi-static methods
!
Strain elastography (SE): quasi-static strain imaging
In quasi-static strain imaging, axial and lateral tracking is typically applied between each pair of RF-echo frames, as described
above, and the lateral displacements are discarded leaving a sequence of axial displacement images. Each axial displacement
image is then converted to a strain image by passing a movingwindow (the strain estimator window) down each image line, to
calculate the local axial gradient of displacement at each window
position. The size of the strain-estimating window is chosen as a
compromise between strain image resolution (small window)
and good strain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = the ratio of mean
strain to standard deviation of strain for an elastically homogeneous region). In some systems this choice may be made by the
operator, in others it is preset by the manufacturer. The relationship between strain and displacement is illustrated in ●
" Fig. 5.
The imaging impact of choosing different window sizes is discussed and illustrated on p. 176 in the section on strain image quality.
The imaging of strain generated by palpation with the ultrasound
transducer is illustrated in●
" Fig. 6. Usually the sign of the strain
(i. e. positive for axial expansion, negative for axial contraction) is
discarded and only its magnitude is displayed, because this can
be easily integrated over time; a high level of persistence (time
integration) is generally applied to strain images to improve their
SNR. The transducer may alternatively be held stationary to imForce(F) Displacement

surrounding soft material, causing it to appear dark in an image where high
strain is displayed as bright. The most useful frames for computing strain
images with good signal-to-noise ratio are those with a near constant rate
of surface displacement. Note that the inset strain images are of a real
phantom containing a stiff cylindrical inclusion, and contain decorrelation
noise. Nevertheless, the stress concentrations mentioned in Fig. 5 and in
the section on artefacts on p. 175 are clearly visible.

age strain generated by internal physiological pulsations (e. g.
cardiovascular, respiratory) or muscular contractions. However,
when this is done, in general the origin and direction of the stress
is unknown; therefore only the axial component of displacement
and strain are measured. There are also likely to be more sources
of decorrelation noise than when a simple uniaxial stress is applied by moving the transducer, although techniques for obtaining good quality strain images under such conditions have been
published and are employed in commercial systems.
Although strain images are displayed at frame rates up to the ultrasound frame rate, the need to average over many frames while
moving the tissue means that strain imaging is not as suitable as
real-time ultrasonography for observing tissue motion or for rapidly exploring a volume. The latter problem may be solved by
3 D elastography [14].
Strain-rate imaging (SRI)
Strain-rate imaging is essentially identical to quasi-static strain
imaging; its name comes from being implemented on cardiology
scanners that already possess tissue Doppler capability, by taking
the axial gradient of the tissue velocity image [15]. In fact, all
real-time strain imaging methods display strain per sample-interval and thus are sensitive to strain rate. The sign of the strain
is preserved in strain-rate images, which assists the study of
muscular contraction and relaxation. It can distinguish between
actively contracting and passively moving tissue, such as the gastrointestinal wall, which currently is the only clinical application
[16, 17].
Artefacts – what influences strain, or strain rate, other
than tissue elasticity?
Because the stress is not homogeneously distributed within the
tissue, strain-image contrast (brightness or colour) is influenced
by effects other than tissue elasticity. Friction between the transducer and skin produces less strain close to the surface than
when good lubrication is present; a compressor of limited size
generates stress and strain with limited penetration and poor
homogeneity (●
" Fig. 7); and soft tissue strains more when it is
adjacent to hard tissue than it would do otherwise. The last-mentioned effect is responsible for the so-called stress-concentration
(“Maltese cross”) artefact seen in strain images of a hard inclusion
in a soft background (●
" Fig. 5 – 7). It may also be the source of
“edge-enhancement” effects (●
" Fig. 8), which are generated also
by the existence of slippery boundaries between structures (see
next paragraph). Care is therefore needed to interpret the apparent positions of structures in the strain image, as they may be
slightly displaced relative to the corresponding structures in the
B-scan, as in●
" Fig. 8.
Care is also required when interpreting strain images for other
reasons, including: the stiffness of out-of-plane structures that
influence in-plane strain, a slippery boundary at a tissue discontinuity may show high axial strain at the boundary, as well as low
and heterogeneous strain beyond the boundary [18–20], and
fluid that can be displaced during a slow palpation produces a
time-dependent reduction in the strain in nearby tissue [21].
Although there are many factors other than tissue elasticity that
influence strain contrast, careful technique and image interpretation minimises their influence on judgement, and may even provide additional diagnostic information beyond that related to
simple tissue elasticity; as with ultrasound imaging, a knowledgeable interpretation of artefacts can help extract more information from an image. Examples are artefacts mentioned above,
namely stress concentrations which may increase the visibility of
stiff structures (●
" Fig. 5, 6, 8 – 10, and section on appearances of
cysts on p. 176), and the strain image characteristics at slippery
boundaries (●
" Fig. 9, 10). Another example is that the strain
from a given force decreases with increasing force, i. e. the tissue
gets harder the more force that is applied, because tissues are
mechanically nonlinear (online appendix). It has been shown
that the degree of nonlinearity is potentially a diagnostically useful tissue property [22–24]. Although stress measurement is reFig. 7 a A narrow compressor (upper image) generates strain that is concentrated below the compressor and decays rapidly with depth. A compressor of lateral and elevational width equal to or greater than the lateral
extent of the region imaged is needed to create the most homogeneous
strain distribution (lower image) and to maximise the depth of stress penetration (courtesy of AF Kolen [65]). b A transducer footprint extender
[30], which helps to achieve this in practice. If a footprint extender is not
available then placing a finger of the hand that is not holding the transducer, on the skin on either side of the transducer, and moving these with
the transducer, helps obtain deeper strain penetration.
Fig. 8 Stress and strain concentrations (and possibly high strain at slippery boundaries) appear to exist in the strain image of a turkey breast on
the left as a bright line (i. e. high strain, suggesting soft tissue) superficial
and deep (arrows) to many of the dark bands (i. e. low strain, suggesting
hard tissue) that correspond to many of the echogenic (probably stiff and
possibly slippery) fibrous septa visible in the B-mode image on the right

sense of clinical elastography. See also Fig. 5, 6.

quired for a quantitative assessment of nonlinearity, it can be
qualitatively judged during the periods of near constant rate of
surface displacement with time (●
" Fig. 6) by examining changes
in strain-image lesion-to-background contrast, or graphs of
mean inter-frame strain within a lesion, as a function of frame
number in the absence of time averaging (i. e. with persistence
switched off). Such graphs are plotted on-screen by at least one
commercial SE system. Finally, time-dependent strain changes
during a sustained compression may indicate a poroelastic or a
viscoelastic response of the tissue (online appendix), which have
been shown to provide excellent potential for characterisation of
oedema [25] and as an additional biomechanical feature for distinguishing benign from malignant breast tumours [26], although current commercial SE systems are not optimised to observe these phenomena.
A confounding factor that is more difficult to account for is an intrinsic loss of shear modulus contrast when it is imaged as strain
[27, 28]. This is particularly true for soft regions buried in a stiff
background, which are difficult to see in a strain image, a problem that has been termed the “egg shell” effect, where the stiff
shell prevents the generation of strain inside the egg. In practice
it will be difficult to know when this artefact is present, since it
manifests for example as soft inclusions not appearing as soft as
they really are. In the more complex but likely scenario of a soft
background tissue containing a stiff tumour that has a very soft
(e. g. necrotic) centre, so long as the centre is sufficiently echo
rich to provide a strain image signal, the strain image is likely to
underestimate the contrast for the soft centre and may even suggest that the centre is stiff relative to the background tissue. In
the case of an echo-free tumour centre, shadow, or a cyst, other
artefacts are generated that would obscure this effect. These are
dealt with on p. 177 in the section on cysts.
Strain image quality and factors that influence it
The better the ultrasound image resolution the better the strain
image resolution (though the latter is always slightly worse). It
is determined by a trade-off with strain contrast discrimination,
the trade-off being controlled by the choice of values for variables
such as the window sizes for the displacement and strain estimators and the smoothing window, persistence, strain normalisation, and palpation speed and amplitude, some of which may
not be under user control. A mechanical discontinuity, such as a
slippery boundary at which displacement is discontinuous, can
provide a good indication of resolution potential (●
" Fig. 9).
Image optimisation requires adjustment of many variables, but
palpation speed and amplitude, and persistence, are particularly

breast carcinomas where the tumour boundary is made more visible by

important. The reason for this, as demonstrated by Varghese and
Ophir [29], is that only a limited range of inter-frame strains (in
the region of 1 – 1.5 %) can be displayed with good SNR. It is difficult to predict the inter-frame strain at a given image location,
since soft tissue will strain more than hard tissue. Although it is
possible for a computer to adaptively select the inter-frame interval so as to maximise strain SNR on a pixel-by-pixel basis, it is not
clear that commercial systems have yet implemented such a concept. Instead, accumulation over many frames (persistence) is
commonly employed, which was shown by Doyley et al. [30] to
allow excellent strain SNR to be maintained even at the high total
strains induced at the point of maximum tissue displacement in
freehand strain imaging. In practice therefore, to maximise strain
image quality, palpation speed and amplitude should be adjusted
interactively while viewing the image to achieve an inter-frame
strain that best displays the desired tissue strain contrast, as explained in●
" Fig. 11. Image reproducibility also varies with strain
rate (and improves with use of persistence); Doyley et al. [30]
found that freehand elastograms were most reproducible at low
(2.9 % s–1) strain rates (equivalent to about 0.5 compressions s–1)
and, using a different system, Havre et al. [31] observed best reproducibility in the interval 1.3 – 2.0 compressions s–1.
Filters are usually incorporated in quasi-static strain imaging systems to omit or replace poor quality frames or pixels. Examples of
quality metrics that have been used for this purpose include the
value of the correlation coefficient at the estimated displacement, the local spatial or temporal variation of displacement or
strain, and the deviation of displacement values about the bestfit straight line within the strain estimation window. As the setting of the decision threshold for quality acceptance is arbitrary,
this is under user control in many systems, and is often labelled
as “gain” by analogy to colour Doppler gain or “rejection”. Systems vary on how they deal with rejected pixels or frames which
may, for example, be replaced with a mean or median of nearby
pixels or frames. This type of processing is hidden from the user,
but when combined with persistence it is a powerful way to improve image quality, and when enhanced with sophisticated
strain normalisation methods it can produce extremely robust
and reproducible freehand strain images of good quality regardless of whether the tissue displacement is uniaxial and in the ultrasound beam direction (●
" Fig. 12), as would be the case when
the transducer is held still and internal physiological motion utilised.
Many systems omit regions or frames of inadequate strain quality, with a varying approach to what is displayed instead. When
the strain image is displayed separately from the echogram, inadequate quality regions may be replaced with a zero strain value
(e. g. black) or with a colour mask that indicates that the data are
of inadequate quality. Often the strain image is displayed as a colour overlay, in which case it is common to display the ultrasound
image in regions of inadequate strain quality. (Note that this is
different to the use of a partially transparent colour elastogram
overlaywhich has a different function, as discussed on p. 182).
Strain quality varies cyclically when using the probe to displace
the tissue as shown in●
" Fig. 6; if the transducer speed is adjusted
to produce a good quality image during the periods of steady motion, the quality will be poorest during the periods of minimum
and maximum applied stress. In some systems the strain image
may therefore flicker during palpation if persistence is low, turning off during these periods of insufficient inter-frame strain. In
general, great care must be taken in setting the quality threshold
as it determines the information seen in the strain image.
Cysts and other echo-free regions
SE artefacts may assist the discrimination of cystic from solid lesions by helping the observer perceive the absence of echoes.
Without echoes, the tracking or Doppler algorithms detect random noise which produces strain noise, and when the sign of
the strain is discarded by detecting its magnitude the strain noise
appears as a high and rapidly fluctuating strain. The final appearFig. 11 Limited strain dynamic range requires
palpation technique (speed and amplitude) to be
adjusted so as to display the strain detail of interest.
a Slow palpation is best for showing subtle details in
the soft background material (e. g. stress concentrations and friction at the phantom surface) but
fails to produce a strain signal that is visible above
electronic noise in the stiff inclusion. b Fast palpation begins to show strain in the stiff inclusion but
detail in the soft background is less apparent.

ance of cysts depends strongly on an interaction between the size
of the anechoic region and the combination of variables mentioned above in the section on strain image quality, some of
which may have been chosen by the manufacturer. As a result,
users of different scanners tend to describe different “characteristic” appearances of cysts. For example, if a cyst is stiffer than
surrounding tissue it will appear dark on the SE image during
palpation, possibly with anterior or posterior “bright-ups” due
to stress concentration, and it may fill-in with the bright strain
noise artefact. This may explain the origin of the “target” or
“bull’s-eye” appearance that has been described [32]. Depending
on the system, it can be helpful to stop palpating and (if possible)
switch strain persistence to zero and minimise quality rejection
(or maximise “gain” if that is the label used for the rejection
threshold). In the absence of endogenous tissue motion, this reduces the tissue strain to zero, leaving only rapidly fluctuating
strain in the cyst. Alternatively, some systems allow the quality
metric (e. g. correlation) to be viewed as an image. Again, this is
best viewed in the absence of tissue strain. Some of these appearances are shown in●
" Fig. 13. Note that this “cyst detection” mode
of strain imaging in part uses information already present in the
ultrasound image of rapidly-fluctuating and spatially-fine random noise, which is best perceived in the ultrasound image by
using high gain and zero persistence. It is currently not known
whether strain imaging truly enhances ability to be sure that no
echoes are present: it may simply be that observing the strain image is more convenient than adjusting the ultrasound image settings. Alternatively, strain imaging may be converting a difficult
motion-assessment perceptual task to a simpler grey-scale or
colour assessment, providing a benefit analogous to strain imaging’s improvement over “visual relative motion assessment” of
real-time ultrasonic images for elastic lesion detection [33].
Avoiding confounding factors in clinical quasi-static strain
imaging
Conditions favourable to obtaining good quasi-static strain images representing tissue elasticity include:
▶ Close proximity of the target to the transducer (< 3 – 4 cm)
▶ Near homogeneous tissue (e. g. liver)
▶ No anatomical planes that allow slip movement anterior to or
within the imaged region
▶ Some distance to tissue boundaries
▶ No structures present (e. g. large veins) that would damp the
shear stress
▶ A broad stress source (in 2 D) relative to the width of the imaged region
▶ Knowing the position of the stress source relative to the imaged region
▶ A limited number of diagnostic targets
Semi-quantitative analysis of strain images
Methods for calculating elasticity based on strain observations
represent an example of solving “the inverse problem” in elasticity imaging [34]. The simplest approach is to assume that stress
is uniformly distributed and is everywhere equal to one, making
the elastic modulus equal to the inverse of strain. Unfortunately,
it is extremely difficult to palpate with the same force and, as described above, many different factors contribute to invalidating
this assumption. This invalidates attempts to score or measure
mean image brightness or colour within a lesion, and is important to keep in mind for the use of (a) scores of lesion-to-background strain contrast, (b) calculated strain ratios, (c) scores of
the pattern of strain distribution and (d) calculated strain heterogeneity with a lesion, e. g. by strain histogram analysis. That is,
the reference tissue selected for judgment of contrast or for calculating strain ratio should experience similar stress to the target
[31, 35] and the judgement of strain pattern or heterogeneity

Strain images are on the left, conventional images

time), no palpation (causing very little tissue strain),

imaged with persistence, during palpation (causing
the cyst boundary to show low strain and other tissues to show strain structure), and small window
sizes for tracking and strain estimation. Strain noise
is seen in the centre of the cyst which, in combination with the low strain boundary, generates the
“target” or “bull’s eye” appearance reported for
some systems. Recognition of this appearance may
be assisted if there is high (real) anterior or posterior
strain due to stress concentrations, which reinforce
the deduction that despite the apparently high (artefactual) strain in the centre of the cyst, it is
nevertheless a stiff structure.

should account for the expected stress distribution, both of
which are difficult.
Dynamic methods
!
Dynamic methods also use the tissue displacement estimation
techniques employed in SE but differ in the method of applying
the force or in the way that displacement is used (●
" Table 1). The
brief localised displacement induced by a focused acoustic radiation force impulse may be displayed directly. Alternatively, propagation of a transient displacement may be used to determine
shear-wave speed. The dynamic nature of the force is essential
in both cases.
Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging:
imaging tissue displacement induced by radiation force
Acoustic radiation force can create a localised displacement of a
few microns in the ultrasound axial direction, which decays in a
few ms [36]. Sufficient force for this purpose can be generated
with a standard ultrasound scanner at depths of many centimetres by a sequence of rapid bursts of long (tens of μs) focussed
ultrasound pulses [37]. The displacement is measured at a known
time after cessation of the push using RF-echo tracking, and
displayed as a qualitative elastogram within a small box [38]
(
●
" Fig. 14a). As the ultrasound beam creates the displacements,
they are less user-dependent (i. e. more uniaxial) than those in
hand-induced strain imaging. Compared to SE images, ARFI images have also been shown in phantoms to have better resolution,
suffer less from stress concentration artefacts, possess better
transfer of shear modulus contrast to image contrast, exhibit improved SNR at depth and be less influenced by the presence of
slip movement anterior to the imaged region [39]. Some of these
properties are illustrated in the images shown in●
" Fig. 14. Cysts
appear very bright on ARFI images with a dark halo, i. e., similar
to the appearance on SE when palpating (●
" Fig. 13), although this
is without the stress concentration “bright-ups” anterior and
posterior to the cyst and it seems to be independent of whether
the cyst contains internal echoes [40]. It seems that ARFI imaging
does more than detect whether there is a lack of echoes (the radiation force may cause fluid to move) although displacement
noise may well be displayed in the absence of echoes. Drawbacks
to this technique include: although the displacement contrast is
related to the elastic contrast, it depends also on absorption and
reflection of the pushing beam (although artefacts from this can
be useful, e. g. in highlighting calcifications); the contrast depends on the delay between the push and the displacement
measurement; and transducer heating from the high power
needed to create the pushing beam limits the frame rate with
present technology. A commercial system, provided by Siemens,
is based on this technique.
Transient elastography (TE): shear-wave speed measurement using a surface impulse
This method is known as transient elastography even though all
of the dynamic methods use transient excitations. It employs a
brief push (a small “thump”) applied with an automated movement of the ultrasound transducer, which acts like a piston at
the skin surface (●
" Fig. 15). The strongest shear-wave arises
from the edge of the piston: thus a disc-shaped piston approximates a ring source. A component of the wave from this ring converges on the ultrasound axis and after some distance travels
down the axis at a speed close to the shear-wave speed. Its propagation may be followed on a single RF A-line at high pulse repetition frequency [41]. The shear displacement (in the ultrasound axial direction) versus depth may then be measured
using 1 D correlation tracking methods, and the speed of the
wave obtained from a displacement “M-mode” (
●
" Fig. 15) as the
slope of a straight line (the oblique white line in the figure) that is
automatically fitted to the approximately linear portion of the
shear-wave arrival time versus depth. The definition of arrival
time is arbitrary but the speed measurement will be accurate so
long as the same reference point on the time-varying displacement is used for all depths and so long as the shape of the
shear-wave does not change as it travels. The straight line avoids
both the deep region where the displacement SNR is poor, due to
the decay of the shear-wave amplitude with depth, and the superficial region where the apparent wave speed varies with
depth (it is strongly influenced by the wave convergence angle
which is determined by the size of the piston). A special algorithm rejects displacement M-modes that are not linear enough,
and the display allows the quality of the measurement to be
judged.

noise, and freedom from stress concentrations, despite the presence of the

pixel concerned (Image in a courtesy of Siemens. Images in b, c and d reproduced with permission from [39].).

The shear-wave speed can be converted to a Young’s modulus
value using the relation E = 3 ρcs
2 (see online appendix), and the
measurement given in kPa [41]. The system from Echosens is designed for easy use and measurement of liver tissue elasticity
[42–45]. It provides a regional elasticity measurement (within
the width of the ultrasound beam and the depth of shear-wave
penetration of several cm); it is not an ultrasound scanner and
provides no conventional ultrasound anatomical images or elastograms. The system lacks 2 D image guidance of the measurement, and it is not possible to propagate the shear-wave beyond
fluid collections (ascites). It may be difficult to obtain sufficient
signals in obese patients with the standard probe (3.5 MHz,
2 mm vibration amplitude) although the failure rate has been reduced by the introduction of a dedicated obese-patient probe
(2.5 MHz, 3 mm vibration amplitude). On the other hand, the
use of the ribs for support when generating the intercostal transient shear-wave limits the amount of prestress, which may be a
confounding factor in elastography because tissue is elastically
nonlinear, i. e. the more it is stressed the stiffer it gets. The transient surface displacement is also tightly controlled, as a single-cycle of a 50 Hz wave. This is expected to help reproducibility of the
measurements because, as described in the online appendix, tissue elasticity and hence shear-wave speed depends on the frequency of vibration. Finally, since the shear-wave is not generated by acoustic radiation force, it is relatively easy to keep the
ultrasound thermal and mechanical indices low.
Point shear-wave elastography (pSWE): shear-wave
speed measurement at a location using acoustic radiation force
The type of localised transient displacement generated by ARFI,
described on p. 179, creates a transient shear-wave propagating
with cylindrical symmetry away from the pushing-beam’s axis
and focus, being strongest at the depth of the pushing-beam’s focus. The shear displacement (●
" Fig. 3) is along the ultrasound
imaging beam, allowing the use of correlation tracking or Doppler to measure the small displacements of the shear-wave and
detect its time of arrival at lateral positions.
In the method of Nightingale et al. [46] the shear-wave is generated using ARFI, and its arrival time at nearby A-lines is measured
to provide the average shear-wave speed between two points
bounded by a measurement region of interest (ROI). The speed
can be measured to depths of up to about 8 cm [47] and, as with
TE, is reported in units of ms–1 or converted to Young’s modulus.
Although ultrasound imaging is used to guide placement of the
ROI, no elasticity images are produced. Nevertheless, the underlying concept is the basis for SWE described below. It is thus herein referred to as point SWE (pSWE), although it has been described in the literature as ARFI quantification. Commercial
systems by Siemens and Philips are based on this technique.
An important application is in characterising diffuse liver disease
where, unlike TE, there are no problems with propagating
through ascites, and potentially fewer problems with obese patients and with patients with dysmorphic livers, given the guidance of conventional ultrasound.
Shear-wave elastography: shear-wave speed imaging
(SWE, 2 D SWE or 3 D SWE) using acoustic radiation force
SWE can be utilized to produce two- or three-dimensional quantitative images of shear-wave speed with a useful field of view
(2 D SWE or 3 D SWE). One such technique is implemented by SuperSonic Imagine. The acoustic radiation force focus is swept
down the acoustic axis faster than the shear-wave speed, so as
to generate tissue displacements (tens of μm) at all positions
along the acoustic axis almost simultaneously. This produces a
shear-wave in the shape of a cone with a shallow angle (and
hence is almost cylindrical), known as a Mach cone, that travels
away from the push line, which spreads less and thus decays
less rapidly with distance than that from a single pushing focus.
An ultrafast scanner achieves an ultrasound frame rate of up to
20 kHz by transmitting a plane wave and focusing only on receive, so that each ultrasound echo image is created with a single
transmit pulse. This high frame rate allows the shear-waves to be
followed in real time in 2 D, and RF-echo tracking over a grid of
points produces a displacement movie (●
" Fig. 16) from which a
small map of shear-wave time-of-arrival can be created. Its size
depends on displacement SNR and the attenuation of the shearwave. It is then analysed by detecting the differences between arrival times at different lateral positions to create a part of the final
image of shear-wave speed. The process is repeated for a number
of different push lines to create a final quantitative elasticity image in a box, which is presented as a colour overlay on the Bmode image in units of ms-1, or converted to Young’s modulus in
kPa as for TE [48, 49]. The maximum size of the elastogram box is
approximately 2 – 3 cm of side length with a linear transducer,
and 9 x 4 cm with a convex transducer. Thus the system uses
three frame rates: the standard B-mode echo image, a hidden ultrafast echo image used to track the displacement, and the shearwave elastogram. Elastograms are created at 3‑4 Hz although the
Fig. 15 Upper: The Echosens applicator contains a piston which includes
the ultrasound transducer. Lower: a displacement “M-mode” image which
shows axial displacement (brightness) as a function of depth and time.
Shear-wave speed is measured as the slope of a straight line (in white) of
best fit to the depth dependence of a suitable reference point (the “timeof-arrival”) on the time-varying displacement.

persistence needed for noise reduction reduces the SWE frame
rate. Spatial resolution is a little worse than in strain imaging
and ARFI displacement imaging but the elastograms are quantitative and display no stress concentration artefacts (●
" Fig. 17).
Penetration in the breast [50] is about 3.5 cm with a linear transducer, and in the liver about 8 cm with a convex transducer [51,
52]. A quality-factor masking of SWE noise allows the B-mode
image to show through, the threshold for which is under user
control labelled as SWE gain. The potential for measuring the viscous component of the shear modulus of tissue elements, by
measuring the frequency dependence of shear-wave speed, has
also been demonstrated [50, 53].
The Siemens Acuson S3000 also provides a two-dimensional
SWE image. The image is acquired in under 700 ms by translating
the pushing focus to cover up to 256 acquisition lines (38 mm
elastogram-box width) where, for each, pSWE is carried out at a
number of positions around the pushing focus. A static quantitative SWE image is therefore displayed. As with ARFI imaging, at
present, after acquiring an image, time is need to allow the transducer to cool before another image may be generated.
Operator dependence of SWE is small, although care is needed to
minimise probe pressure when imaging superficial tissues so as
to avoid a high shear-wave speed artefact near the surface due
to localised pre-stress which causes the superficial tissue to stiffen because of the nonlinear stress-strain character of tissue. For
SWE of the liver, as with TE, intercostal imaging may help prevent
pre-stress as pressure on the ribs is not easily transmitted to the
liver. Factors affecting data quality and producing speed errors or
loss of signal, include: strength of the push, variations in attenuation, absorption and reflection of the pushing beam, ultrasound
scatterer density, tissue continuity, very high or very low shearwave speed, and shear-wave scattering, reflection or refraction.
Thus, although shear-waves do not propagate through clear
non-viscous liquids, care is needed in interpreting lack of SWE
signal as indicating a cyst. Partial volume effects also need to be
considered when interpreting the images. Finally, shear-wave
propagation near boundaries and within thin layers may invalidate the assumed relationship between their speed and elastic
modulus. More detail on these phenomena may be found in the
online appendix of this paper. A full characterisation of the artefacts associated with SWE has yet to be conducted.
Fig. 17 Example of SWE of same phantom as imaged in Fig. 9, 11. Lower:
a B-scan showing a hyperechoic and attenuating inclusion (axial distance
scale in centimetres). Upper: overlay of a transparent coloured SWE on the
B-scan, showing that the inclusion is homogeneously hard within a background that is homogeneously soft (colour scale shows Young’s modulus in
kPa). Note: the images have been cropped from the originals.
Fig. 16 Top row: four example frames (at 2, 3, 4
and 5 ms after the start of the radiation force push)
from an axial displacement movie showing a conical
shear wave developing and then propagating in the
breast in vivo. The graph lower left shows the displacement-versus-time waveforms observed as the
shear wave passes the three points, A, B and C, in
the upper-left image. The difference in the times of
arrival of the shear wave at each of these different
locations allows the average shear-wave speed to
be determined for each of the paths between each
of these locations. (Adapted from Tanter et. al. [50],

Recommendations for display
!
A semi-transparent overlay of the elastogram onto the B-mode
echogram assists judgement of the spatial relationships of ultrasound imaging and elastographic information. Judgements of
elastographic detail, contrast or stiffness are best made using a
side-by-side display or by setting the elastogram to be opaque,
to avoid confusion between elastographic and ultrasound imaging detail and brightness.
Selection of grey-scale display for the elastogram, or a colour
scale with a monotonically increasing intensity, avoids artefactual contouring structure in the image and is best for judging
elastographic detail. A colour scale in which hue varies helps judgement of hardness or contrast; a commonly used scale of this
type runs from red to blue via intervening colours such as yellow
and green. Currently, however, there are differences between
manufacturers, and greater standardisation is needed as to
whether red or blue means soft and whether the top of the scale
bar indicates soft or hard. Clearer indication, with larger fonts
where necessary, of hard and soft on the scale would also be
helpful. Finally, care is needed when interpreting displays that
code the elastogram as black where quality is poor since this
may cause poor quality to be confused with a low value of the
quantity imaged if a colour scale is used in which black represents the bottom of the scale.
Safety considerations
!
Quasi-static strain imaging and shear-wave methods based on
force applied by dynamic surface displacement have identical ultrasound safety considerations to conventional ultrasound imaging modes. Radiation force based elastography operates with
higher TI but is measured to be within AIUM limits and safety
considerations are similar to Doppler mode, i. e. normal due diligence should be employed concerning sensitive tissues such as
the eye and fetus, and when bone may be present in the pushing
beam [54–56].
Conclusion
!
Effective use of elastography requires knowledge of the underlying physics and technology, which is made difficult by the complexity of the subject and the variety of technologies available.
This complexity, however, brings opportunities, which the research community is pursuing with enthusiasm. As a result, the
technology for elastography is likely to undergo considerable development beyond the current techniques available. Substantial
improvements can be expected in image quality, ease of use,
quantification and range of tissue characteristics that are measurable. For further reading, reviews include Doyley et al. [33], Palmeri and Nightingale [38], Wells and Liang [57], Parker et al. [58],

[62] and Ophir et al. [27, 63, 64].
