The gut microbiota has been linked to the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes
(T2D). The underlying mechanisms as to how intestinal microbiota may contribute to T2D
are only partly understood. It becomes progressively clear that T2D is characterized by
a chronic state of low-grade inflammation, which has been linked to the development of
insulin resistance. Here, we review the current evidence that intestinal microbiota, and
the metabolites they produce, could drive the development of insulin resistance in obesity
and T2D, possibly by initiating an inflammatory response. First, we will summarize major
findings about immunological and gut microbial changes in these metabolic diseases.
Next, we will give a detailed view on how gut microbial changes have been implicated
in low-grade inflammation. Lastly, we will critically discuss clinical studies that focus on
the interaction between gut microbiota and the immune system in metabolic disease.
Overall, there is strong evidence that the tripartite interaction between gut microbiota,
host immune system and metabolism is a critical partaker in the pathophysiology of
obesity and T2D.

INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, which is in large driven by the obesity pandemic, is increasing
with alarming rates. In 2019, it was estimated that 463 million people were suffering from diabetes
worldwide; these numbers are expected to continue to rise toward 578 million patients in 2030
(1). T2D is typically preceded by insulin resistance; a condition in which the actions of insulin
on peripheral tissues including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose, are impaired. This results
in reduced insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, impaired insulin-induced suppression of hepatic
glucose production and lipolysis rates, respectively (2). Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the
endocrine pancreas. In early stages of insulin resistance, the pancreas can compensate for impaired
peripheral insulin action by increasing insulin production. When pancreatic beta cells fail to meet
the increased insulin demand, hyperglycemia develops (3). Hyperglycemia has been extensively
linked to the detrimental micro- and macrovascular complications typically observed in humans
with T2D (4).
In recent decades, chronic low-grade “metabolic” inflammation (local and systemic), also called
metainflammation, has been identified to contribute to the development of insulin resistance and

progression to T2D. As such, metainflammation has been linked
to both impaired insulin action and secretion (5). While a vast
body of research has provided detailed insight into regulation
of glucose homeostasis by inflammatory pathways, the upstream
triggers of these pathways have remained elusive for a long
time. The intestinal microbiota, the collective community of
microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a critical role
in human metabolism, in part by acting as an immunomodulator.
Although this property is critical for human health, it can
also have detrimental consequences. In accordance, the gut
microbiota has been appointed as driver of metainflammation
observed in obesity and T2D, which are also characterized by
an altered gut microbiota composition (6–8). In this review,
we extensively address the tripartite interaction between the gut
microbiota, the mammalian immune system and glucometabolic
pathways (Figure 1). In addition, we propose whether, based on
current evidence, modulation of inflammation via the intestinal
microbiota could form a target for novel therapies to reduce the
current diabetes pandemic.
INFLAMMATION IN OBESITY AND TYPE 2
DIABETES
Low-grade inflammation has been extensively linked to
disturbances in glucometabolic pathways as observed in people
with obesity and T2D. Several cytokines are increased in the
circulation of people with metabolic syndrome (9–11) and have
negative effects on peripheral tissue metabolism. For example,
people with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance had a
higher inflammatory tone and an altered response to respiratory
viral infections compared to insulin sensitive individuals
(12). Similarly, obese subjects had a higher inflammatory
tone and more severe asthma, which was related to the gut
microbiota (13). Interestingly, a 10% weight loss reduced
plasma concentrations of several cytokines in obese women
(10). Further, numerous pharmacological treatments aiming to
reduce inflammation in metabolic diseases have positive effects
on glucose tolerance in mice and human. These include the
novel hybrid cytokine interleukin (IL) 233, which is produced
in a genetically modified Escherichia coli by fusing murine IL-2
and murine IL-33 (14). Other treatment strategies include IL-1
receptor blockage (15), IL-1β antagonism (16), inhibition of the
intracellular pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway (17), and TNF
antagonism (18) (Figure 2). These findings highlight pivotal
roles of metainflammation in the development of T2D and the
opportunities for (pharmacological) interventions. Below, we
review a number of key immune cell types and inflammatory
mediators that have been linked to impaired glucose metabolism.
Adipose tissue was one of the first tissues in which
inflammation was highly correlated with insulin resistance.
It contains a plethora of immune cells including T cells,
eosinophils and mast cells that keep resident macrophages in
an M2 polarized or alternatively activated state (19). Although
these terms have fallen out of favor due to the identification
of various other macrophage subtypes (20), we will stick to
these terms for the sake of simplicity. Importantly, secretion
of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 from M2 macrophages
has been shown to protect lean mice from insulin resistance
(21, 22). Obese mice and people with T2D have lower IL10 expression and higher pro-inflammatory signals (21, 23).
Obese humans with metabolic syndrome had lower levels of
IL-10 compared to subjects without metabolic syndrome (24).
Further, IL-10 overexpression in murine muscle tissue improved
insulin sensitivity even under high fat diet conditions (22).
These findings suggest a pivotal role of IL-10 in prevention of
inflammation in people with metabolic abnormalities.
Other important, but less studied, anti-inflammatory
cytokines include IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 promotes glucose
tolerance and inhibits adipogenesis (25). Further, it promotes an
alternative macrophage activation (26, 27). Genetic variations in
the IL-4 promotor have been associated with T2D susceptibility
(28). However, the literature is scarce to draw conclusions.
IL-13 shares a similar structure to IL-4, has anti-inflammatory
properties (29) and promotes an alternative macrophage
activation (30). Surprisingly, both cytokines were elevated in the
blood circulation of obese humans compared to lean controls,
which was associated with a lower physical activity (31). Another
study supported this findings by showing increased levels in
insulin resistant humans, which positively correlated with
hyperglycemia (32). A study in mice points toward a disturbed
IL-13 receptor activity (32). Obese animals have higher IL-13Rα2
activity, which inactivates and depletes IL-13. Therefore, the
anti-inflammatory characteristics of IL-13 might be abolished
despite high circulating levels. More research is necessary about
anti-inflammatory cytokines in metabolic diseases.
M1 or classically activated macrophages have particularly
been implicated in the metainflammation observed in metabolic
diseases (33). M1 macrophages are generally responsible for
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are associated with
T2D development by altering local and distant tissue functions.
Certain cytokines (called chemokines) are able to attract
immune cells to metabolic active tissues (34). Monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) is a strong chemokine for
monocytes (35), and its expression was increased in obese
human (36) and rodent adipose tissue (37, 38). In rodents,
MCP1 overexpression in adipose tissue increased macrophage
infiltration and mediated insulin resistance, whereas MCP1
knock out in combination with high fat diet feeding augmented
development of insulin resistance compared to wild type mice
(38). Although this observation was not observed in another
study (39), higher chemokine production in obese adipose
tissue has been associated with infiltration of immune cells and
development of insulin resistance.
A recent study suggests that obesity-related insulin resistance
precedes the infiltration of pro-inflammatory macrophages,
giving insights in the cause and consequence dilemma (40). First,
insulin resistance, which was genetically induced by knocking
out mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2),
was shown to coincide with increased MCP1 expression,
monocyte infiltration and differentiation into pro-inflammatory
macrophages (M1). Second, insulin resistance in wild type
mice preceded the accumulation of macrophages during dietinduced obesity. Thirdly, adipose tissue from obese insulin

FIGURE 1 | Three-way interaction between the gut microbiota, glucose metabolism, and the immune system. (1) The gut microbiota influences the host‘s glucose
metabolism and hormone production via the production of several metabolites. Hyperglycemia increases gut permeability and thereby translocation of bacterial
components into the circulation. In turn, bacterial translocation is fueling a (pro) inflammatory response of the immune system. Under normal conditions, the gut
microbiota is training the immune system via several bacterial components and metabolites. (2) The immune system is shaping and controlling gut microbiota to keep
a symbiotic relationship between host and microbiota. Further, it prevents bacterial translocation via promoting gut integrity. Bacterial translocation may lead to
inflammation in several tissues and consequential loss of function (e.g., beta-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance and fatty liver disease). (3) The glucose metabolism
can induce a pro-inflammatory response of the immune system through interplay of metabolic and inflammatory pathways (immunometabolism). Thereby, all three
factors affect each other and may drive metabolic diseases.
resistant patients had lower mTORC2 signaling, high MCP1
expression and high macrophage content (40). Thereby, insulin
resistance might be the consequence of obesity and the cause for
macrophage infiltration, which in turn amplifies the development
toward diabetes.
Human pancreatic islets express and secrete MCP1 as
well. MCP1 expression was increased after exposure to proinflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (41).
Furthermore, overexpression of MCP1 in murine pancreatic
beta cells led to robust macrophage infiltration in islets and
spontaneous development of diabetes (42). These results suggest
a major role of MCP1 in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance
and beta cell dysfunction via immune cell infiltration.
Cytotoxic CD8 T cell infiltration into epididymal adipose
tissue of obese mice precedes accumulation of macrophages. In
fact, genetic depletion of CD8+ T cells lowered macrophage
infiltration, adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance,
whereas adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells aggravated adipose
inflammation (43). Further, T cells in obese adipose tissue
produce more pro-inflammatory mediators compared to lean
controls (44, 45). Moreover, the number of interferon (IFN) γ
producing T helper (Th) 1 cells in human visceral adipose tissue
positively correlates with systemic inflammatory tone, but are not
associated with insulin resistance; though, the anti-inflammatory
Th2 cells negatively correlated with insulin resistance (46).
Further, obese mice lacking IFN-γ display lower adipose tissue
inflammation and better glucose control (47, 48). Therefore, an
interplay between different immune cells takes place, which has
to be further eluted.
Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are recognized as the innate
counterpart of T cells due to similar functionality (49). However,
they miss the adaptive antigen receptors of T cells (50). They
are divided into 5 subsets: Natural killer (NK) cells, ILC1,
ILC2, ILC3, and lymphocytes tissue-inducer cells (LTi) (51).
ILCs protect barrier tissues against pathogens and maintain
immune homeostasis in several tissue types (52). Further, some
of the ILCs have cytotoxic characteristics that are important to
remove transformed cells and keep macrophages in homeostasis
(51). Under steady state, cytotoxic ILCs kill adipose tissue
macrophages to maintain homeostasis (53). However, this is
impaired under high fat diet conditions leading to an increase
of pro-inflammatory macrophages in the adipose tissue of obese
mice and humans.
High fat diet increases NK cell numbers and the production
of pro-inflammatory TNF in epididymal adipose tissue (54).
Depletion of NK cells decreased adipose tissue macrophages,
inflammation, and insulin resistance (54). Further, high fat
diet drove the proliferation of ILC1 in adipose tissue and

FIGURE 2 | Inflammation influences beta cell function and insulin sensitivity. (1) A westernized diet induces insulin resistance and a pro-inflammatory immune
response in metabolic active tissues. T cells (Th1 via IFN-γ and CD8+ T cells) have been discussed a secondary mediator that led to the attraction of macrophages,
which are the main source of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. (2) An active pro-inflammatory response in those tissues enhances and deteriorates the extend of
the insulin resistance via several inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-6, and IL-1β), mainly secreted from M1 macrophages. Several downstream molecules (JNK, IKK, and
SOCS3) interfere with the insulin signaling. Inhibition of those pro-inflammatory pathways led to improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (e.g.,
pharmacological treatments such as anakinra, gevokizumab, and aspirin). Anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (expressed by various immune cell types, but
mainly M2 macrophages) and adiponectin (from adipocytes) can resolve inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity. (3) Chronic high concentrations of
pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to alpha cell expansion and beta cell dysfunction in pancreatic islets, which drives the progression toward T2D in obese subjects. Th,

promoted a pro-inflammatory environment for macrophages
via IFN-γ secretion (52). Similarly, obese subjects had higher
ILC1 counts in adipose tissue and blood, which decreased
after bariatric surgery (55). Therefore, NK cells and ILC1
seem to contribute to obesity phenotype by promoting a proinflammatory environment.
Obesity increased the activity and proliferation of NK
cells, which stimulated the production of IFN-γ (56). That
in turn stimulated the differentiation of macrophages and
promoted insulin resistance (56). In contrast, high fat diet
reduced the numbers of ILC2s in adipose tissue (57). They are
important to sustain metabolic homeostasis in adipose tissue
(58) and to keep macrophages in a M2 phenotype (57). IFN-γ
suppressed the activity of ILC2s (58). Collectively, several recent
studies indicate the involvement of ILCs in (adipose tissue)
inflammation; potentially posing the unknown immunological
trigger that induces a pro-inflammatory environment.
However, the ILC research is relatively young to draw major
conclusions yet.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which is mostly expressed and
secreted by adipose tissue macrophages (59), was one of the
first cytokines shown to be increased in adipose tissue (60)
and circulation of people with T2D and obesity (61). TNF
expression in adipose tissue was inversely correlated to insulin
sensitivity in obese people without T2D compared to heathy
lean controls (62). Interestingly, TNF infusion in rats disturbed
insulin sensitivity already on day one (63). Further, mice deficient
in TNF and TNF receptor 1 & 2 were protected from diet-induced
insulin resistance (64). Neutralization of TNF by infusing reactive
immunoglobulins in rats improved insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake (60). Lastly, weight loss in obese subjects improved insulin
sensitivity and reduced TNF expression in adipose tissue (65),
suggesting a pivotal role of obesity on inflammation and insulin
sensitivity. TNF inhibition has been suggested for the treatment
and prevention of T2D (66, 67). However, large and long-term
clinical studies are warranted.
Several studies addressed the mechanism behind the insulin
disturbing effects of TNF (68). TNF activates the intracellular
IκB kinase (IKK), which comprises two kinases (alpha and beta),
leading to the activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-lightchain-enhancer of activated B cells) (69) and transcription of
inflammatory genes. Interestingly, inhibition of IKKβ by the antiinflammatory agent aspirin or sodium salicylate (70) increased
insulin sensitivity in mice (71) and humans (72, 73). Further,
TNF is able to activate c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (74),
which is a direct inhibitor of the insulin signaling pathway
(75). JNK activity was elevated in several tissue types of obese
mice (76). Absence of JNK1 resulted in decreased adiposity and
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 4 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 571731

Scheithauer et al. Gut Microbiota in Metabolic Inflammation
improved insulin sensitivity in mice (76–78). Both downstream
molecules (IKK and JNK) of TNF interfere with insulin receptor
substrate 1 (IRS1) and thereby stop insulin signaling (69,
79). Furthermore, within pancreatic islets, TNF production
by macrophages drives dysfunction of insulin-producing beta
cells and may directly mediate insulin resistance of pancreatic
beta cells (80, 81). Therefore, TNF plays a crucial role in the
development of insulin resistance in several tissue types with high
glucometabolic relevance.
Adipose tissue macrophages are the main source of the
highly studied pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, with estimated
contributions of 15–35% of the total circulating IL-6 (59, 82).
Mohamed-Ali et al. (82) measured the IL-6 concentration
in arterial as well as venous blood from subcutaneous
adipose tissue. They found two times more IL-6 in the
venous blood compared to arterial blood, indicating major
portions of circulating IL-6 is secreted from the adipose
tissue. Surprisingly, they found no increase in TNF between
both vessel types. Further, Weisberg et al. (59) confirmed
that most of the IL-6 (and TNF) secreted from adipose
tissue is originating from macrophages. Chronically elevated
levels of IL-6 have been shown to decrease hepatic insulin
sensitivity in vitro (83), to induce hyperinsulinemia in mice
(84) and to mediate insulin resistance in murine muscle
tissue (85). Mechanistically, IL-6 increases the activity of
suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which inhibits
several downstream mediators of insulin receptor signaling
(86–88). Interestingly, knocking out the receptor for IL-6 in
immune cells did not protect from insulin resistance, but
disturbed immune homeostasis in mice (89, 90), suggesting a
fine-tuned mechanism.
In the pancreas, the IL-6 receptor is mostly expressed
in the endocrine portion, with higher levels in alpha cells
(91). IL-6 expression was increased in pancreatic islets
from obese mice (92) and associated with expansion of
alpha cells, a known histological observation in the islets
of people with T2D. Indeed, IL-6 knock out in obese mice
inhibited the expansion of alpha cells, accompanied by
reduced glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) (91).
In addition, IL-6 administration in mice enhanced insulin
secretion by increasing the incretin glucagon-like peptide
1 (GLP1) from intestinal L cells and pancreatic alpha
cells (93, 94). Therefore, IL-6 has physiological effects on
pancreatic islets, but the underlying mechanism is yet to
be revealed.
The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β has been implicated
in the development of obesity and T2D (95–97). IL-1 receptor
knockout mice are protected against high-fat diet induced
glucose intolerance and adipose tissue inflammation (98).
However, IL-1β has been shown to have physiological roles
in glucose metabolism. Feeding increased IL-1β secretion
from peritoneal macrophages in a glucose depended manner,
which contributed to postprandial insulin secretion. Lack
of endogenous IL-1β reduced postprandial insulin (99).
Therefore, although IL-1β plays a physiological role in
glucose metabolism, chronically elevated levels might lead
into T2D.
In T2D, pancreatic islets are infiltrated by pro-inflammatory
macrophages (92, 100), which drive the production of IL1β (101) via the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domainscontaining protein 3) inflammasome (102). Initially, IL-1β at
low concentrations may be beneficial by promoting β-cell
proliferation (103); however, chronically elevated concentrations
might lead to beta cell failure (66, 104). Administration of an IL1 receptor antagonist improved glucose tolerance via improving
beta-cell function and systemic inflammation in humans (15).
Further, chronic IL-1β administration is able to induce insulin
resistance in adipose tissue in vitro (105). The mechanisms by
which IL-1β mediates insulin-resistance have been attributed, at
least in part, to downregulation of insulin substrate receptor-1
(IRS-1) (95) and aberrant activity of the transcription factors NFκB and FOXO1 (Forkhead box protein O1) (106) during obesity
or inflammatory conditions. Therefore, IL1β has physiological
roles in glucose metabolism with deleterious consequences after
chronic exposure to high concentrations.
Macrophages play a crucial role in liver inflammation.
Resident hepatic macrophages undergo activation and thereby
alter inflammatory pathways in obesity conditions (107). In
addition, there is a pronounced increase in macrophage (and
other immune cell) infiltration in the liver. This leads to
production of inflammatory cytokines that generate insulin
resistance in hepatocytes and drive T2D-related diseases such
as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) (108, 109). Nevertheless, a recent study
in mice and humans with obesity could not confirm that
obesity per se induces a pro-inflammatory phenotypic switch in
liver macrophages (110), although their depletion prevents dietinduced insulin resistance (111). Interestingly, liver macrophages
were shown to contribute to the development of insulin
resistance independent of production of inflammatory factors.
Rather, liver macrophages were shown to produce insulin-like
growth factor–binding protein 7 (IGFBP7), which directly altered
insulin receptor signaling in the liver (110).
Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system
that can be triggered by exposure to pathogens, damaged
cells and toxic compounds. The reaction can be acute or
chronic, potentially leading to damage in several tissues. In
particular, bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria,
have been proposed as a source for metabolic inflammation since
LPS was found to be increased in the circulation of people with
diabetes (112). LPS was postulated to enter the circulation via
chylomicrons or via increased intestinal permeability (113) where
it induces an inflammatory response in systemic sites. In mice,
chronic LPS infusion perturbed glucose tolerance by inducing
hepatic insulin resistance and hampering glucose-stimulated
insulin secretion (114). In humans, associations between LPS
concentrations and several aspects of the metabolic syndrome
were also noted (112, 115).
Two phenomena have been noted: “metabolic endotoxaemia”
(116, 117) and “postprandial inflammation” (118). The former
describes an inflammatory response to increased systemic levels
of LPS due to a “leaky gut” (114). The latter defines the
increase in circulating endotoxins and other inflammatory

Scheithauer et al. Gut Microbiota in Metabolic Inflammation
markers after a meal, particularly meals rich in fat (119–
121). Interestingly, LPS and long-chain saturated fatty acids,
such as palmitate, act synergistically in activating inflammatory
signaling in macrophages (122), highlighting a link between
a westernized diet rich in saturated fatty acids (123) and
postprandial inflammation.
From the present data, it is clear that a dysregulated immune
system is strongly associated with obesity and T2D. Moreover,
several inflammatory components directly alter glucose tolerance
and insulin sensitivity, which provides evidence for a causal role
of inflammation in these pathologies. The intertwined relation
between metabolic disorders and low-grade inflammation has
been coined “metainflammation.” This illustrates that, in
contrast to an instrumental acute inflammatory response to
pathogens and tissue damage, chronic low-grade inflammation
as observed in obesity and T2D has detrimental consequences for
human metabolism.
THE INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA IN
METABOLIC DISEASES
Within the human intestine, a complex mutualistic relation
exists between trillions of microorganisms, collectively known
as the gut microbiota, and the host (124). While much focus is
on the bacterial component of this community, recent studies
highlight the importance of other microorganisms such as
bacteriophages (125, 126) and fungi (127, 128) in human health.
It is beyond the scope of this review to cover the role of other
members of the microbial community in human metabolism.
We will here focus on the bacterial component that we will
refer to as microbiota. The gut microbiota is critical for human
health (129–131). It plays a key role in digestion, production
of metabolites with the potential to alter human metabolism
(e.g., short chain fatty acids) and development of the immune
system. The immunomodulatory properties of the gut microbiota
are of particular interest in the context of metainflammation as
observed in obesity and T2D (132).
Germ-free mice housed in aseptic conditions, have an
underdeveloped immune system. These mice typically have
impaired development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues
(GALT), decreased serum immunoglobulin levels, smaller
spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes with low levels of tissue
resident macrophages (133). In line, the mice have an insufficient
immune response to pathogens (134, 135). Introducing bacteria
into germ-free mice restores immune system formation and
functioning which exemplifies the critical and dynamic relation
between host immunity and the gut microbiota (136). These
findings have not only been related to presence of bacteria
but also to the microbial metabolites such as SCFA (137)
or components such as commensal DNA containing CpG
(unmethylated cytosine phosphate guanosine dinucleotides)
motifs (138) and polysaccharide A (PSA) (139). The development
of a symbiotic relationship during early years may determine the
development of several diseases (140).
Importantly, germ-free mice are resistant to diet-induced
obesity (141, 142). Introducing a single bacterium that has
been associated with obesity (Enterobacter cloacae) into germfree mice led to weight gain, a disturbed glucose tolerance,
higher systemic lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP)
concentrations and lower adiponectin levels (143). Similarly,
germ-free mice that received the microbiota from obese donors
gained more energy from the diet compared to germ-free mice
that received the microbiota of lean donors (144, 145). These
studies were the first to show that an obese phenotype can be
transferred via the gut microbiota and hence indicate causality.
Although a definition of a “healthy gut microbiota” is generally
lacking, a plethora of disease conditions are associated with
a microbiota composition that is different from a healthy
control group (124, 146). The most preferred term in this
context is microbial “dysbiosis,” which can describe a bloom
of pathobionts, loss of commensals or/and loss of diversity
(147). However, the term falls out of favor due to lack of
a clear definition. An altered microbiota is present in people
with obesity (144, 148) and T2D (6, 149) (Figure 3). It is
generally characterized by expansion of usually underrepresented
microorganisms (often opportunistic pathogens) (6, 143) and
lower phylogenetic alpha diversity (8, 150, 151). Diet (152)
and antibiotic use (153) have been identified as drivers of
these changes.
The obesity-associated microbiota has been shown to extract
more energy from the diet compared to lean controls, proposing
a role in the development of excessive energy stores (144,
145, 154). Further, an enrichment of pro-inflammatory bacteria
(e.g., Escherichia coli) at the expense of anti-inflammatory
bacteria (e.g., Fecalibacterium prausnitzii) in T2D has been
reported several times (6, 7, 149). An increase in typical proinflammatory Gram negative bacteria might be a plausible source
for the metainflammation seen in metabolic diseases (155, 156).
However, this is only confirmed in animal studies and in
associative nature in humans.
A reduced number of anti-inflammatory bacteria such
as F. prausnitzii has been related to a disturbed SCFA
production of the gut microbiota (6). SCFAs, which result
from microbial degradation of fibers, have several beneficial
effects on host metabolism (157). Surprisingly in obesity, an
increased SCFA production has been observed (158, 159), which
was proposed to be responsible for higher energy extraction
(160) and was dependent on the diet (161). It is estimated
that 5–10% of our daily energy is provided by fermentation
processes by the gut microbiota (162). However, in diabetes
a reduced SCFA production or uptake, in particular the antiinflammatory acting butyrate (163), has been suggested (6).
However, strong evidence for this concept is still lacking. A
recent study found a causal relation between a host geneticdriven increase in butyrate production which was associated
with an improved insulin response. Vice versa, abnormalities
in the production or absorption of propionate were related
to increased risk of developing T2D (164). Absorption of
intestinal SCFAs is very efficient, leaving only 5–10% in
feces (165). Large amounts of the intestinal butyrate is
directly used by the colonic enterocytes as an energy source
(166, 167). However, it is difficult to measure real turnover
and concentrations of SCFAs due to rapid utilization by

FIGURE 3 | Alterations in the obese and diabetic gut microbiota. (1) Under healthy conditions (lean), the gut microbiota lives in symbiosis and provides the host with
several beneficial functions. For example, it produces short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are used as an energy source and have effects on several host tissues.
However, several bacteria are able to induce an inflammatory response and can even breach the intestinal barrier, which has to be prevented by a proper immune
response. (2) The gut microbiota in metabolic diseases is often described as “dysbiotic,” meaning that there is an expansion of normally underrepresented bacteria (in
particular opportunistic pathogens) and a lower diversity. A disturbed intestinal immune response and a westernized diet is discussed as causes. Further, a
westernized diet induces a “leakiness” of the gut. Parts of (opportunistic) bacteria are able to cross the intestinal barrier and induce a pro-inflammatory response in the
host. Lastly, people with obesity show an increased energy harvest by the gut microbiota and a different SCFAs profile as lean people, which might have deleterious
consequences for the host health.
intestinal cells and microorganism. Thus, although SCFAs are
involved in host metabolism, the mechanism and extent are
still elusive.
In summary, changes of the gut microbial composition and a
lower microbial diversity in obese subjects has been associated
with higher inflammatory tone (8, 168, 169). This implicates
a role for the gut microbiota in the low-grade inflammation
observed in people with metabolic syndrome (170, 171).
GUT BARRIER FUNCTION AND
METABOLIC INFLAMMATION
A proper gut barrier function is critical to prevent
bacterial infiltration from the gut into the circulation
and periphery. Many pathologies, including inflammatory
bowel disease (172), liver diseases (173), and metabolic
syndrome (114), show signs of a disturbed gut barrier
function leading to bacterial translocation (174). A
“leaky” gut can facilitate translocation of bacterial
components form the intestine into the periphery (174).
The following part summarizes evidence of bacterial leakage in
metabolic diseases.
Intestinal Barrier Integrity
One of the first papers implicating a link between gut barrier
function, insulin resistance and increased levels of circulating
levels of LPS were derived from a study in obese mice (114)
(Figure 4). Antibiotic treatment reduced intestinal and systemic
LPS along with an improved glucose tolerance, underscoring the
gut microbiota as the endotoxin source (155). Mechanistically,
these findings were related to high-fat diet (HFD) induced
reduction in expression of tight junction genes, which was linked
to increased intestinal permeability (155, 175). Tight junctions
are protein complexes that prevent leakage of various compounds
along paracellular spaces (175). LPS directly increased intestinal
permeability in vitro and in vivo in mice, suggesting a link
between increased intestinal LPS and the gut tight junction
expression (176).
Interestingly, hyperglycemia directly drives intestinal
barrier permeability though Glut2-dependent reprogramming
of intestinal epithelial cells (177). Loss of gut integrity
increased influx of bacterial products in the periphery of
mice and potentially humans, proposing an interplay between
inflammation and a disturbed glucose tolerance. Further,
systemic toll like receptor (TLR) ligands were positively
correlated with the long-term glucose marker HbA1c in humans
(177). Although metabolic endotoxemia in obesity and T2D
becomes more evident, human studies showing a higher
intestinal permeability and disturbed tight junction expression
are still lacking.
Several groups tried to identify “translocating” bacteria in
peripheral organs and tissues by measuring or sequencing the 16s
ribosomal RNA of bacteria. First, more bacterial DNA was found
in the circulation of diabetic subjects and obese mice compared
to healthy controls, with predominantly Proteobacteria identified
(178). Secondly, DNA from Gram-negative bacteria was detected
in adipose tissue of obese women and correlated with a
decrease in adiponectin levels, suggesting a link between
bacterial translocation and activation of inflammatory pathways
in (adipose) tissue (179). Further, an increased adherence of
pro-inflammatory bacteria to the epithelium might indicate
that bacteria are passing the epithelium (178). However, the
concept or bacterial translocation is still very controversial due
to technical limitations to detect small amounts of bacteria in
systemic tissue sides.
Immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulins control the gut microbiota and prevent
bacterial invasion by binding to microorganisms directly

FIGURE 4 | The intestinal barrier is disturbed in people with obesity and diabetes. (1) A high fiber diet supports intestinal barrier function by improving intestinal tight
junction expression and immune cell function. Antigen presenting cells (e.g., dendritic cells) are probing the intestinal environment, present the antigens to T and B
cells, which may lead into immune tolerance or an inflammatory response (cytokine and antibody expression). (2) The intestinal integrity is affected in people with
metabolic syndrome. They have a thinner mucus layer, which leads to penetration of opportunistic bacteria; lower levels of IgA positive B cells and a lower IgA
secretion, which may end into microbial alterations (outgrowth of opportunistic pathogens). A westernized diet decreases intestinal tight junction expression, which
results into translocation of bacteria and pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). High glucose levels (hyperglycemia) reduces tight junction expression via
GLUT2, promoting bacterial translocation in people with diabetes. PAMPs in the periphery induce inflammation in several other tissues such as the adipose tissue,
where macrophages proliferate and accumulate. In particular, adipose tissue macrophages are responsible for low grade inflammation (high pro-inflammatory cytokine
levels and less anti-inflammatory cytokines).
to block the attachment to the host. In addition,
immunoglobulins binding marks (so called “opsonization”)
bacteria for phagocytosis and antigen presentation to
dendritic cells. Moreover, immunoglobulins neutralize
microbial toxins (180). A proper induction in childhood
is essential to build up an immune tolerance against gut
bacteria and to prevent microbial changes (181, 182).
Particularly, secretory IgA are pivotal players in shaping
gut microbiota composition, both in mice and humans, and
defective IgA secretion has been shown to shift microbial
communities (183–185). An altered intestinal immunoglobulin
response has been noted for several diseases including
undernutrition (186), inflammatory bowel disease (187),
and obesity (188).
A recent study reported fewer IgA+ immune cells and
less IgA secretion in obese mice (188). Further, IgA deficient
obese mice had impaired glucose tolerance, higher macrophage
content in adipose tissue and more systemic endotoxins.
Antibiotic treatment improved glucose tolerance, suggesting the
involvement of the gut microbiota in this phenotype. The antidiabetic drug metformin improved IgA response in obese mice
and bariatric surgery increases fecal IgA in human subjects (188).
Further, a higher flagellin expression of motile bacteria and a
disturbed antibody response against flagellins leading to bacterial
encroachment on the intestine has been discussed in obesity and
inflammatory bowel diseases (189).
Immunoglobulins are produced by B cells, which had
impaired function in T2D (190). B cells accumulated in visceral
adipose tissue of obese mice (191) and produced more proinflammatory cytokines compared to B cells in adipose tissue
of lean controls (192). B cell depletion in obese mice decreased
inflammation and improved glucose tolerance (192), suggesting
that disturbed B cell function in obesity is linked to inflammation
and glucose metabolism.
T cells, particularly follicular helper T cells, are important
players in the induction of a proper immune and antibody
response (193, 194). Depletion of their function led to a disturbed
intestinal IgA activity and the development of metabolic

syndrome with age. IgA inappropriately targeted Clostridia
species and allowed for the outgrowth of Desulfovibrio. The
former suppresses and the latter enhances host lipid absorption
via CD36 modulation (194), which plays essential role in fatty
acid uptake (195). This study gave insight in the development
of microbial alterations, which are present in metabolic diseases,
via IgA. It is clear that immunoglobulins play a major role in
gut homeostasis (196), but only a few recent studies show the
involvement of immunoglobulins in the disease progression of
metabolic diseases.
Bacterial translocation, as discussed above, might be an
interesting concept to explain inflammatory changes in obese
and diabetic tissues that leads into insulin activity loss (betacell dysfunction and insulin resistance). However, bacterial
translocation as a concept is still very controversial due to lack of
strong evidence in humans. There currently is a trend to look into
the role of bacterial metabolites as causative in the development
of metabolic diseases rather than presence or absence of bacterial
strains. In the following part, we will discuss evidence of
metabolites involved in metabolic disease progression.
MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS IN
MICROBIOTA-INDUCED METABOLIC
INFLAMMATION
Low grade chronic inflammation in obesity and T2D has been
studied for more than 25 years (60), with several pathways
to a large extend disentangled (197). In contrast, observations
on changes in the gut microbiota of obese and diabetic
people were revealed no longer than 15 years ago (6, 144,
198). Particularly a westernized lifestyle is known to change
not only the immunemetabolism, but also the gut microbiota
(199). The connection between gut microbial changes and
metainflammation in metabolic diseases was established even
more recently. The following part addresses mechanistic insights
from rodent studies and the few causal relationships found
in humans.
Pattern Recognition Receptors
The intestinal epithelium is the first line of defense against
intestinal microorganism (200). A tight intestinal wall with
a properly working immune system is necessary to avoid
invasion. Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) are expressed
on most cells of the innate immune system. PPRs recognize
microbial components and hence are crucial parts of the
immune system. They include the widely-studied membranebound TLR superfamily. These receptors are mainly expressed
on epithelial cells and cells of the innate immune system (201).
TLRs detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS)
such as LPS or flagellin and facilitate an inflammatory response
(202). Acute inflammation is important to clear of infected,
abnormal or damaged tissue. The process needs to be resolved
to avoid unnecessary damage on healthy tissue. Usually this
resolution is disturbed in conditions of chronic inflammation
(203) (Figure 5).
TLRs are a crucial tool of our immune system to detect
invading microorganism. Several TLRs have been associated with
the development of the metabolic syndrome, in particular TLR2
and TLR4 (204). TLR4 recognizes several ligands, but most
predominantly LPS (205). Monocytes from people with T2D
showed higher expression of TLR4, along with higher cytokine
and LPS levels (206). Interestingly, insulin infusion for several
hours is able to suppress the expression of TLRs on monocytes
from people with T2D (207), suggesting that insulin resistance
promotes higher expression of TLRs (and thereby inflammation).
Further, TLR4 has been suggested to play a role in beta cell
failure during diet-induced obesity in mice, as HFD-fed TLR4
knock out mice exhibit preserved insulin secretory function,
lower inflammatory markers and no macrophage infiltration in
pancreatic islets (208). Further, a combined knockout of TLR4
and TLR2 in mice increased proliferation of beta cells, but not
glucagon-producing alpha cells, and improved glucose tolerance
in obese mice (209). Interestingly, absence of CD14, a co-receptor
of TLR4, protected mice from most of HFD and LPS induced
metabolic deteriorations (114). Thereby, TLR4 might be an
interesting treatment target and an important mediator of insulin
resistance, metainflammation and beta cell failure.
TLR5 has been associated with the development of metabolic
diseases (210). TLR5 is expressed on several cell types and
recognizes mainly flagellins, a protein involved in the motility of
bacteria (211). Knock out of TLR5 in mice led to the development
of metabolic syndrome, which correlated with changes in the
gut microbiota. Transfer of feces from TLR5 knockout mice
to wild type mice conferred many features of the metabolic
syndrome (210). Importantly, follow-up studies suggest that
the observed metabolic changes were likely due to housing
techniques rather than the genetic profile (212). TLR5 knock
out in intestinal epithelial cells induced low grade inflammation
and metabolic syndrome, which was reversed by antibiotics,
implying a connection with the gut microbiota (213). TLR5 is
likely involved in the development of a metainflammation.
Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88) is a downstream
target of most TLR- and IL-1 receptor-mediated signaling
pathways and a central player in innate immune signaling
(214). Myd88 knock out in mice induced metabolic syndrome
with an increase in bacterial translocation (178). Further,
hepatocyte specific deletion of MyD88 predisposed mice to
glucose intolerance, inflammation, hepatic insulin resistance and
induced gut microbiota alterations (215). In contrast, inducible
deletion of Myd88 in intestinal epithelial cells partially protected
against diet-induced obesity, diabetes and inflammation. The
protective phenotype was transferred by transplanting feces from
intestinal Myd88 knock out mice into germ-free mice. Targeting
MyD88 (inducible knock out) after onset of obesity reduced fat
mass and inflammation, suggesting a link between microbiota
and MyD88 in the development of obesity (216). A finely tuned
MyD88 activation therefore is crucial for the homeostasis of
several tissues and is involved in metabolic diseases.
Similar to TLRs, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domaincontaining protein 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 recognize PAMPs

FIGURE 5 | Molecular mechanism involved in microbiota promoted metainflammation. (1) The acute inflammation has to be resolved to avoid chronic inflammation
that can induce tissue damage. Genetic and environmental factors can disturb this system leading to a chronic (low-grade) inflammation. Several of following
pathways are disturbed during obesity and diabetes: (2) Tolle like receptors (TLRs) and their adapter molecules are important for recognizing bacterial components.
Activation triggers different inflammasomes to initiate an inflammatory response. Similarly, interleukin (IL) 36 leads to the activation of the inflammasomes and a
pro-inflammatory response that can be inhibited by the endogenous IL-36 antagonist. (3) Inflammasomes consists of different proteins: NACHT, LRR, and PYD
domains-containing protein (NLRP), Apoptosis-associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and pro-caspase. Upon activation they
can mature IL-1β and IL-18. NLRP12 has dual roles: It acts pro-inflammatory response via maturation of IL-1β and anti-inflammatory by inhibiting down-stream signals
of several TLRs. NLRP6 is important for the maturation of IL-18 and antimicrobial protein expression in the intestine. Its activity can be increased by the microbial

FIGURE 5 | metabolites taurine and decreased by Spermidine as well as Histamine. It is important for maintaining a gut symbiosis and intestinal barrier function.
NLRP3 activity can be increased during lipid accumulation. Further, hexokinases can detect intracellular particles of Gram positive bacteria and activate NLRP3, which
leads to the maturation of the pro-inflammatory acting IL-1β. (4) Pro-inflammatory signals can increase the intracellular enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO),
which in turn metabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine. Kynurenine can activate the transcription factor Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which induces the release of
IL-22. IL-22 is important for the intestinal barrier function, which can be promoted via IL-23. Obesity interferes with that response, but the exact mechanism is not
clear. (5) Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein (NOD) 1 can be activated by bacterial diaminopimelic acid (DAP). DAP can be cleaved by
intestinal Lyzozyme (lyz) 1 enzymes from bacterial peptidoglycans. NOD1 has dual roles: It induces insulin resistance and insulin trafficking in beta cells. NOD2 can be
activated by bacterial muramyl dipeptide (MDP). NOD2 inhibits the development of insulin resistance.
inside of the cell. NOD1 and NOD2 are cytosolic receptors
that respond to bacterial peptidoglycans (217) and have been
associated with the development of insulin resistance (218, 219).
Interestingly, NOD1 and NOD2 double knock out protected
mice from inflammation and peripheral insulin intolerance.
Direct NOD1 activation led to insulin resistance (218) and gut
microbial derived NOD1 ligands promoted insulin trafficking
in beta cells (220). The latter is most likely a compensatory
mechanism after the development of an insulin resistance. On the
contrary, NOD2 signaling is protective against T2D. Defective
NOD2 sensing promotes diet-induced inflammation, microbial
changes and insulin resistance (221). NOD2 activation via
bacterial cell wall-derived muramyl dipeptide (MDP) improved
insulin resistance (219). From the present data it seems that
NOD2 signaling is beneficial whereas NOD1 is deleterious for
insulin sensitivity and beta cell function.
Inflammasomes
Inflammasomes are a central component of the innate immune
response and have been implicated in several metabolic diseases
(222). Inflammasomes are intracellular multimeric complexes
composed by NLRs (NOD-like receptors), ASC (Apoptosisassociated speck-like protein containing a CARD), and procaspase-1. They are formed in response to PAMPs and
DAMPs (damage associated molecular patterns) and control the
activation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 (223). Thereby,
they act as intracellular sentinels of inflammatory and metabolic
cellular disturbances. Knocking out of several NLRs in mice led
to changes in the gut microbiota (224–229) and aggravation of
diet-induced metabolic syndrome (229).
NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing
3) is one of the most studied NLRs. It responds to a
wide range of infectious and endogenous molecules, such as
several bacterial cell wall components (222, 230) and saturated
fatty acids (97). However, none of these molecules seem
to directly interact with NLRP3. Common cellular signals
might activate NLRP3 (231). That priming process leads to
the activation of caspase-1 and subsequent IL-1β secretion
(232). Several studies linked increased NLRP3 expression in
adipose tissue and monocytes to obesity (233) and T2D
(234), respectively. Interestingly, calorie restriction in obese and
diabetic subjects reduced activation of NLRP3 in adipose tissue
and coincided with reduced inflammation and improved insulin
sensitivity (232).
Further, there is a direct connection between cell metabolism
and inflammation. Hexokinases, enzymes that are mainly
involved in glucose metabolism, were able to detect bacterial
peptidoglycans and thereby activated NLRP3 (230). Several
studies disclosed that an ablation of NLRP3 or of the
inflammasome components ASC and caspase-1 in mice
prevented obesity-induced inflammation in fat depots and liver,
ameliorated insulin signaling, increased energy expenditure
and prevented liver steatosis as well as pancreatic damage
(225, 232). Mechanistically, NLRP3 inflammasome participated
in metainflammation and lipotoxicity by sensing intracellular
rise of the sphingosine ceramide (232), the saturated fatty acid
palmitate (97) and reactive oxygen species (235). Therefore,
NLRP3 is a major component in the inflammatory processes
deranged in metabolic diseases.
Further, ablation of ASC, a common adapter molecule to all
inflammasomes, on a db/db (leptin-deficient mice) background
resulted in increased obesity and loss of glycemic control
under high fat diet conditions. Moreover, this phenotype was
transmissible to wild type mice by co-housing and abrogated
by antibiotic treatment pointing to an essential role of gut
microbiota in the phenotype. In the same paper, the authors
found that deficiency in components of the inflammasome
(caspase-1, ASC, NLRP3, or NLRP6) aggravated the progression
from NAFLD to NASH and disease severity, and that this
phenotype was transmissible to wild type mice by co-housing.
These effects were attributed to a different cologenic microbiota
in inflammasome deficient mice that increased the amount of
TLR4 and TLR9 bacterial agonists into the portal circulation,
driving hepatic TNF induction and, hence, NASH (225).
However, the authors used unrelated wild-type mice instead of
littermate controls. Two later studies highlight the importance
of using proper controls, namely related littermates from the
knock out mice, to exclude the influence of housing conditions
and other genetic variations in the littermates (236, 237).
Nevertheless, these findings suggest a role of inflammasomes and
their components in several comorbidities of obesity.
Interestingly, Levy et al. provide evidence of a direct
link between commensal-derived metabolites and NLRP6
inflammasome activity (227). The authors found that histamine
and spermine inhibited NLRP6-dependent IL-18 production,
while taurine enhanced it and consequentially stimulated the
IL-18 driven production of antimicrobial peptides in the
intestinal epithelium. However, a two later papers disputed
the impact of NLRP6 and ACS-associated inflammasome in
shaping the microbiota composition using littermate-controlled
experimental design in two geographically separated vivarium
to compare the phylogenetic composition of wild type,
NLRP6−/−, ASC−/− mice microbiota and minimize non-genetic
confounders (236, 237). Therefore, NLRP6 and its components

Scheithauer et al. Gut Microbiota in Metabolic Inflammation
are involved in metainflammation via the gut microbiota, but the
exact mechanism is still elusive.
The NLRP12 inflammasome has more recently been
implicated in the development of metabolic diseases.
Interestingly, it was first though to induce a pro-inflammatory
response, but recently a dual role became evident (238). It has
been shown to dampen and resolve inflammation, in particular
in the intestine, in a microbiota dependent manner (228) and
by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria (228). NLRP12
expression in adipose tissue was reduced in obese compared to
lean subjects. In mice, deletion of NLRP12 increased weight gain,
adipose tissue deposition, blood glucose and pro-inflammatory
macrophage expansion. Interestingly, NLRP12 knock out in mice
induced gut microbiota alterations with decreased number of
SCFA producing bacteria. Depletion of the microbiota, germ-free
condition or co-housing with wild type mice was sufficient to
restrain inflammation, obesity, and insulin tolerance in knock
out mice, highlighting a direct link of the gut microbiota
in obesity and inflammation (229). Overall, these findings
form a strong link between microbiota, inflammasomes, and
metabolic diseases.
Cytokines
Several cytokines are associated with the development of the
metabolic syndrome (as discussed above), but only a few studies
found direct links between cytokines and the gut microbiota. IL22 is essential for maintaining an antimicrobial response and
intestinal barrier function (239). Its production is induced by
intestinal type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and influenced by
bacterial tryptophan metabolism (227, 240, 241). Induction of IL22 was impaired in obese mice, in particular during infection with
Citrobacter rodentium (242), suggesting an impaired immune
response against pro-inflammatory bacteria. Mice lacking the IL22 receptor on a high fat diet are prone to develop metabolic
syndrome and administration of IL-22 in obese mouse models
reversed several symptoms such as hyperglycemia and insulin
resistance (242, 243).
Protective effects of IL-22 on pancreatic islets may explain
these findings. Administration of IL-22 reduced ER stress
and inflammation with a restored glucose tolerance in mice
(244). Some bacterial metabolites such as butyrate were able
to induce IL-22 secretion from pancreatic innate lymphoid
cells, which improved beta cell proliferation and inflammation
(245). Next, inactivation of IL-22 (and IL-23) signaling in
mice deteriorates intestinal barrier, microbial alterations and
expansion of pathogenic bacteria causing systemic increase in
LPS and Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), showing direct
connection of those particular cytokines, the gut microbiota and
obesity related comorbidities such as atherosclerosis (246). On
the other hand, T cell derived IL-22 amplified IL-1β driving
inflammation in human adipose tissue (190), suggesting either
a tissue specific activity of IL-22 or a disturbed action in
metabolic syndrome.
Further mechanistic insights of the IL-22 signaling were given
in a recent studies, where indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO),
an enzyme that is present in many immune cells and activated
during inflammation, was linked to the gut microbiota and
obesity (247). IDO metabolizes tryptophan along the kynurenine
pathway, which is a potent AhR ligand and shown to disturb
an anti-tumor response (248). Interestingly, it becomes more
evident that the tryptophan metabolism plays an important
role in metainflammation (249) and energy homeostasis (250).
Although IDO activity is important for a proper regulatory T
cell function (251), a high enzymatic activation is associated
with cardiovascular complications and inflammation (252). The
enzyme activity was shown to be increased in obesity (247).
Deletion or inhibition of the enzyme improved insulin sensitivity,
improves gut barrier and chronic inflammation. Neutralization
of IL-22 abrogated the protective effects of IDO deletion,
highlighting the beneficial roles of IL-22 in intestinal health and
glucose tolerance (247). More studies are needed to elucidate the
dysregulation of the tryptophan metabolism and its metabolites
in metainflammation.
ILC3s are an important source of IL-22 in the intestine, which
is regulated by the adaptive immune system (CD4+ T cells)
(253). The lack of CD4+ T cells led to an upregulated activity
of intestinal ILCs that disturbed the host-microbe interaction and
reduced intestinal lipid metabolism (253). Further, elevated levels
of IL-23 and IL-22 in young mice decreased the production of
pancreatic enzymes, explaining the disturbed lipid metabolism
to some extend (254). However, inactivation of both cytokines
led to deterioration of the intestinal barrier, dysbiosis and a proatherogenic environment (increase in LPS and TMAO) (246).
These findings highlight a fine tuned interplay between various
immune cell types and mediators. Generalizing them as pro- or
anti-inflammatory as well as beneficial or deleterious is in most
cases not possible.
IL-23 has mainly pro-inflammatory activities (255), which is
mostly secreted from activated macrophages and dendritic cells
(DCs) located in peripheral tissues (256). Further, it induces
the production and secretion of IFN-γ from various cell types,
upon recognition of bacterial, viral and fungal components (257).
Further, IL-23 is important for the development of T helper
17 cells (Th17) (258), which are in turn critical players in the
homeostasis within the gut (259). Interestingly, obese women
had higher circulating levels of IL-23 compared to healthy
controls (260), supporting the assumption of a pro-inflammatory
environment in metabolic diseases. Surprisingly, mice lacking IL23 on a high fat diet, gained more weight and were more glucose
intolerant than the controls (261). These mice also exhibit an
increased gut permeability and bacterial translocation compared
to wild type mice, underlining the important of IL-23 in the
gut homeostasis.
Recently, IL-36 has been discovered and associated with
obesity. IL-36 belongs to the IL-1 receptor family (262) and
promotes the resolution of intestinal damage (263). IL-36
expression was increased in obese patients and negatively
correlated with high blood glucose levels (264). Mice lacking an
endogenous inhibitor for the IL-36 receptor had better glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to controls. Lack
of IL-36 inhibition increased the abundance of Akkermansia
muciniphila, mucin formation and intestinal integrity (264).
However, this is the sole study indicating a role of IL-36 in
metabolic diseases.
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 12 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 571731

Scheithauer et al. Gut Microbiota in Metabolic Inflammation
Lastly, typical anti-inflammatory cytokines (as discussed
above) have essential roles in maintaining the intestinal
homeostasis. For example, IL-10 is important to dampen
an inflammatory response against intestinal bacteria (265).
Particularly, microbiota derived SCFAs can stimulate the
protection of IL-10 (266). Knock out of IL-10 induces
colitis in mice, which is dependent on the microbiota
since germ-free mice do not develop colitis (267).
However, studies in metabolic diseases focuses mostly
on the circulation than the intestine of obese humans
or rodents.
Although several cytokines have been associated with
metainflammation in obesity and T2D, only a few show
direct connection to the gut microbiota such as IL-22, IL23, and IL-36. However, several others have been discussed
in the context of intestinal health and immune function
(268), which have not been associated with metabolic
inflammation yet. It is plausible that more cytokines are
involved in all three processes. The ongoing discovery of
new bacterial metabolites will shed more light into the
complex pathways.
MICROBIOTA-PRODUCED METABOLITES
AND HOST INFLAMMATION
The hypothesis that bacteria physically translocate to tissues,
where they may invoke an inflammatory response has generated
mixed results in literature as described above. A more recent
line of reasoning, which relates gut microbiota to inflammation
and cardiometabolic disease, includes the production of gutderived metabolites that enter the systemic circulation to
induce several effects. These metabolites have been linked
to specific intestinal microbiota. Several of these metabolites
have received much attention in recent years (269). Recently,
metabolites such as imidazole propionate were discovered and
shown to be involved in insulin resistance (270), however
only for a few bacterial metabolites a direct connection
between metabolism, immune system, and gut microbiota has
been made.
Fibers and Short Chain Fatty Acids
The most widely studied metabolites include the short-chain
fatty acids (SCFA) acetate, butyrate and propionate, generated by
gut microbiota which ferment indigestible dietary components
such as complex carbohydrates (fibers) (165). In that regard,
high fiber intake was associated with a protection from
several metabolic diseases such as T2D (271). Further, fiber
intake promoted the expansion of SCFAs producing bacteria
and improved glucose tolerance (partly via GLP-1) in people
with T2D (272) (Figure 6). Inulin (high fermentable fiber)
supplementation increased insulin sensitivity in human subjects.
Inulin propionate ester improved insulin sensitivity as well as
reduced IL-8 (273), suggesting beneficial effects on inflammatory
parameters. Furthermore, high fiber intake promoted gut
barrier integrity in mice, which was associated with the SCFAs
production (274).
SCFAs have been linked to a several metabolic processes
including induction of appetite regulation (275, 276) and
improving insulin resistance in muscle and adipose tissue
(165, 277, 278). However, not all SCFAs seem to have
beneficial effects. Acetate was shown to increase glucosestimulated insulin secretion and weight gain in mice (279).
Administration of low concentrations of propionate reduced
insulin sensitivity in mice and humans by stimulating glucagon
and FABP4 production (280). Instead, butyrate promotes
gut epithelial integrity (281), an anti-inflammatory milieu,
resistance to enteropathogens and regulatory T cell generation.
Further, butyrate can inhibit the epigenetic modulator histone
deacetylases (HDACs) (282) and thereby induce an antiinflammatory response particularly in intestinal cells (283, 284).
Importantly, butyrate-producing bacteria are less abundant in
fecal microbiota of T2D individuals (6), which might have
deleterious effects on the intestinal immune system. Fiber
intake is associated with a decreased risk for metabolic diseases
via increased SCFAs production, however the mechanism and
extend is still elusive.
Trimethylamine-N-Oxide
Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has attracted a lot of attention
in the context of cardiometabolic diseases. TMAO is produced
by the liver from trimethylamine (TMA), which on its turn is
produced by intestinal microbiota from choline and carnitinecontaining nutrients. TMAO has been linked to vascular
inflammation (285, 286), e.g., via activation of NLRP3, and
atherosclerotic plaque development, which could explain the
increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart
failure in people with higher levels of TMAO (287). Inhibition
of the gut microbial TMA formation reduced macrophage
foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesions development in
mice (288).
Further, a recent human trial found that energyreducing diets decreased choline and L-carnitine. Those
changes were associated with an improvement in fasting
insulin and insulin resistance in overweight and obese
adults. Further, there was a link between dietary fat intake
and TMAO: increase in TMAO was related to lower
improvements concerning glucose tolerance. All three
metabolites (TMAO, choline and L-carnitine) were associated
with changes in amino acids, in particular branched-chain
(BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (289) that have been
associated with diabetes (290, 291) and changes in the gut
microbiota (292).
Bile Acids
Bile acids have been proposed to be involved in glucose
metabolism (293). They include different molecules that are
essential for nutrient absorption in the intestine and are
transformed by the microbiota (293). Bile acids are end
products from cholesterol that are formed in the liver
and excreted in the intestine via the gall bladder. In the
intestine, the bacteria transform primary into secondary

FIGURE 6 | Microbial metabolites that affect glucose tolerance and inflammation. (1) A high fiber consumption has several beneficial effects on the gut microbiota and
host health. They are degraded by the gut microbiota in short chain fatty acids such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate. SCFAs can be taken up by the enterocytes,
used as an energy source or bound to free fatty acid receptors to stimulate varies responses (e.g., GLP-1 release from intestinal L-cells). Intracellularly, it can stimulate
epigenetic changes via histone deacetylase (HDAC). It supports the expansion of beneficial bacteria and keeps opportunistic pathogens in control, improves glucose
and appetite control, supports intestinal barrier integrity and induces an anti-inflammatory immune response in intestinal as well as systemic tissue sides. (2) Primary
bile acids (pBA) are produced in the liver from cholesterol and secreted into the intestine via the gall bladder. There, they can change the gut microbiota and are
transformed by bacteria to secondary bile acids (sBA). Bile acids can activate intestinal and systemic TGR5 as well as FXR, which increases the energy expenditure,

acid (BCAA) catabolism of the host, which in turn inhibits the insulin signaling. (4) Further, a westernized diet is commonly rich in choline and carnitine, which the gut
microbiota can metabolize to trimethylamine (TMA). After intestinal uptake, the liver transforms TMA into Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) via flavin-containing
monooxygenase (FMO). TMAO inhibits bile acid synthesis, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), induce macrophage foam cell formation and inflammation via NLRP3.
That in turn leads to cardiovascular complications.
bile acids (293). Further, bile acids have an effect on the
microbiota composition, for example, cholic acids changed
the gut microbiota and reduced systemic adiponectin levels
in rats (294). Bile acids are efficiently absorbed in the
enterohepatic circulation. Small parts leave the circulation
and are either excreted in feces or end in the systemic
circulation (293).
In the blood circulation, bile acids can bind to the farnesoid
X receptor (FXR) and G protein coupled bile acid receptor
1 (TGR5), which are involved in glucose metabolism (295)
and liver regeneration (296). Using an intestinal agonist for
FXR induced amongst others GLP-1 secretion, change in
the gut microbiota and improved glucose tolerance in mice
(295). Antibiotic treatment reversed this metabolic phenotype
(295), suggesting the gut microbiota to be involved. However,
effects of FXR activation are rather contradictory. It seems
to improve insulin sensitivity (297, 298), but also promotes
obesity (299, 300). Knocking out the FXR receptor prevented
obesity and metabolic changes in mice (301). Interestingly, FXR
is expressed by various immune cells and is a modulator of
the intestinal innate immunity and intestinal integrity (302).
More studies are needed to disentangle the role of FXR
in metainflammation.
Although these metabolites have given novel insight
into the interaction between nutrient intake-gut microbiota
composition—host metabolism and immunity, many data
are derived from rodent models and require confirmation in
humans. In addition, it remains to be proven that modulation
of these metabolites in fact can alter metabolic disease and
inflammation in humans.
INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT RESTORING
GUT MICROBIOTA BALANCE AND
INFLAMMATION
Several interventions were partially able to restore gut microbiota
symbiosis and associated metabolic function. In particular,
dietary interventions have shown effects on microbiota function
and meta-inflammatory effects. However, results from dietary
interventions are complex and difficult to interpret since
subjects show a low adherence and have high inter-individual
variations. Therefore, other more specific approaches have
been pursued to alter gut microbiota composition. Most
commonly, supplementation of specific selective fermented
ingredients that may alter microbiota composition (prebiotics)
or supplementation of beneficial bacterial strains (probiotics)
has been carried out, while in two studies, the metabolic
effects of replacement of host microbiota by fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT) was investigated.
Diet
Modulation of gut microbiota has been speculated to be a
novel tool to improve the metabolic abnormalities associated
with obesity and T2D. As was shown in a recent study, the
success of a dietary intervention could be predicted based on
baseline microbiota composition (151, 303). A higher microbial
gene richness was associated with a lower inflammation (151).
As diet is an important factor shaping the gut microbiota
(304), dietary interventions (such as increasing plant-based
fibers intake and reducing food additives such as artificial
sweeteners) have been put forward as an attractive target
to improve functional and compositional aspects of gut
microbiota (146). A dietary intervention study which included
whole grain products and prebiotics to particularly target the
gut microbiota decreased typical pro-inflammatory bacteria
belonging to Enterobacteriaceae taxa and lowered levels of LPS
binding protein (LBP), several inflammatory markers and it
increased systemic adiponectin concentrations (305) (Table 1). A
meta-analysis shows that fiber intake leads to a higher abundance
of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp., which might
contribute to an increase in fecal butyrate concentration (306).
Although only associative in nature, these results suggest an effect
of dietary intake on the gut microbiota and inflammatory read
outs (305).
Changes in diet, especially the amount of indigestible
food components such as fibers change the gut microbiota
composition (319). A low-fiber westernized diet was associated
with decrease in beneficial Firmicutes bacteria and an increase
in mucosa penetrating Proteobacteria (320). Further, several
different types of fibers improved gut permeability and colitis
in mice (304). The diversity is only partially restorable after
reintroducing fibers into the diet, which leads to increasing
permanent loss of bacterial strains in mice over multiple
generations (152, 319). As a result of selection in favor of
particular bacteria during western diet, this loss in diversity
is mostly a loss of Bacteroides, known for their capacity
to break down fibers (152, 320). This permanent loss of
specialized bacteria may harbor vast consequences. Indeed, a
rapid reduction in SCFAs was observed after low carbohydrate
intake (307). Supplementation of butyrate directly, improved
insulin sensitivity in mice (277), but failed in several human
studies. Therefore, fibers are positively associated with the
glucose tolerance, potentially via SCFAs production; however, the
mechanism is still elusive.
Prebiotics
Prebiotics have been described as selectively fermented
ingredients that allow specific changes in the composition
and/or activity of the gastrointestinal microflora that

confers benefits upon host wellbeing and health (321).
Current prebiotics are mainly complex carbohydrates,
but also other compounds such as polyphenols and
polyunsaturated fatty acids exert prebiotic effects (322).
Next to improving stool consistency, prebiotics can be fermented
to SCFAs that have various beneficial function on the host
health (322).
Several prebiotics have been studied already in metabolic
diseases. For example, oligofructose treatment in genetically
obese mice, improved glucose homeostasis, inflammation
and leptin sensitivity (308). Further, it increased L-cell
content in rats with higher production of GLP-1 (323) and
improved gut integrity, reduced endotoxemia as well as lowered
inflammation in genetically obese mice (155). In humans,
oligofructose-enriched inulin changed the gut microbiota
in obese children, reduced body fat and decreased systemic
IL-6 (309). Similarly, Berberine, a component of a Chinese
herb, have shown beneficial effects on gut microbiota and
glucose tolerance by increasing intestinal SCFA production and
reducing inflammation in obese rats (310). A vast amount of
animal studies suggests beneficial effect of prebiotics on the
host glucose tolerance, however human studies fail to provide
enough evidence (324). Further, only a few studies focused on
inflammatory markers. More research is needed to assess the
potential of prebiotic treatment to reduce metainflammation
in humans.
Probiotics
Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when
administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host. The probiotic candidate must be a taxonomically
defined. Further, safety and health benefits must be supported
by reproducible human studies (325). When combined with
prebiotics, they may be referred to as synbiotics. Given
the associations between altered gut microbiota and T2D,
and more specifically, a reduction in beneficial, butyrate
producing bacteria, several trials have been performed in
humans to improve metabolic health supplementing these
bacteria, most commonly Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium
species (326).
In mice, Lactobacillus reuteri improved insulin sensitivity,
gut permeability and aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand
production (327). Administration of a mixture of different
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains improved glucose
homeostasis, macrophage infiltration and changed the gut
microbiota (314). Similarly, a multi-strain treatment (VSL#3)
improved liver function, inflammation and insulin sensitivity
in genetically obese mice (328). These rodent studies point

Scheithauer et al. Gut Microbiota in Metabolic Inflammation
out several beneficial roles of probiotics in metabolism and
inflammation; however, probiotics are only moderately effective
in humans.
The randomized clinical trials that were performed up-todate however, were mostly of short duration and included
a relatively small number of participants, and as such,
generated contrasting effects. In an attempt to provide more
clarity, several meta-analyses have been performed focusing
on different outcomes. Two meta-analyses observed small
improvements in fasting glucose levels (0.3–0.5 mmol/l) and
reported conflicting results on fasting insulin levels or insulin
sensitivity indices, dependent on the studies included in the
meta-analysis given the significant heterogeneity (329, 330). In
general, effects were more pronounced on glucose metabolism
when interventions were performed in T2D patients (331, 332)
as compared to normoglycemic obese participants and when
a probiotic cocktail using several strains was administered
instead of one. Other meta analyses reported no effect
of probiotics on weight (333) and small improvements in
total and LDL-cholesterol (329) with most benefits again in
studies using multiple bacterial strains. The effects on systemic
inflammation were only investigated in a handful of studies,
where reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP), but not TNF were
observed (329, 334).
Akkermansia muciniphila has been extensively studied in
metabolic diseases (316) and has recently been tested in humans
as a probiotic. Importantly, this strain inversely correlates with
body weight in humans and rodents (316). First, administration
of A. muciniphila in obese mice improved insulin sensitivity,
metabolic endotoxemia and adipose tissue inflammation (316).
Further, a sole purified membrane protein of that particular
strain was able to improve metabolism and gut barrier function
in obese as well as diabetic mice (335). Supplementation in
humans improved insulin sensitivity and inflammation, however,
the effects were rather small, but the authors concluded from
this proof of principle study that the treatment is safe and has
therapeutic potential (317).
A rather new strategy is the modification of exiting bacteria
to produce biological active compounds. For example, in mice
L. reuteri genetically modified to produce IL-22 improved liver
function, inflammation and bacterial translocation (336). These
findings give completely new treatment options that might be the
future for the use of probiotic.
Thus, several studies point toward a beneficial effect of preand probiotics in people with metabolic diseases. However, the
absolute improvements in clinically relevant outcomes such as
fasting glucose levels or HbA1c have been very modest, especially
when compared to the efficacy of commonly used glucose
lowering agents. On the other hand, definitive conclusions
cannot be drawn yet due to the small studies with short duration
and heterogenic treatment groups. Further, it is still not clear
whether probiotics colonize the gut during consumption (334).
A recent study demonstrates that the colonization of probiotic
depends on the host; thus, questioning the universal usage
of probiotics and highlighting the importance of personalized
medicine (337).
Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
A drastic way to alter gut microbiota composition is by fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT). In this procedure, donor
feces (obtained from a healthy donor following an extensive
screening process) is transplanted into the recipient by upper
GI (duodenal) infusion or lower GI (colonic) infusion. While
anecdotally used in the past (338, 339), in more recent
decades, the FMT procedure has become more common. More
recently, two studies have been conducted to investigate whether
transplantation of lean donor feces could improve glucose
metabolism in obese metabolic syndrome patients. In a pilot
study, lean donor FMT into nine obese males with metabolic
syndrome induced a small but significant improvement in
peripheral insulin sensitivity and a trend toward improved
hepatic insulin sensitivity when compared to participants that
underwent autologous gut microbiota infusion. Lean donor
FMT resulted concomitantly in increased bacterial diversity and
increased presence of butyrate producing bacteria (340).
The results from this pilot study were confirmed in a trial
in 38 participants. Again, allogenic FMT improved insulinstimulated glucose disposal in skeletal muscle after 6 weeks of
treatment; this effect was most striking in patients with lower
fecal microbiota diversity at baseline (341, 342). However, after
18 weeks, no effects could be observed on insulin sensitivity. Also,
the microbiota composition had returned to the composition
prior to the allogenic FMT (342). The mechanisms that underlie
this beneficial effect remain to be investigated, as the FMT
studies did not point to solid mechanisms responsible for
these improvements. Thus, whether a reduction of bacterial
translocation and/or low-grade inflammation contributes are
involved remains hitherto unclear. The plasma levels of shortchain fatty acids such as butyrate were not altered.
However, a recent study compared FMTs from patients after
bariatric surgery and patients with metabolic syndrome. Both
donor feces were infused in people with metabolic syndrome.
The latter decreased insulin sensitivity, along with an increase
of several secondary bile acids (318). In contrast, the former
led to a decrease in the macrophage attracting factor (MCP1) in adipose tissue and in plasma. These results highlight the
role of the gut microbiota in insulin tolerance and metabolic
inflammation (318).
Future research in this area should focus on further
standardization of the FMT technique (development of standard
operating procedures) as well as validation in larger populations,
including T2D patients. In addition, various refinements
should be explored, including the transfer of specific strains
(preferably in pill form) rather than feces, combination with
prebiotics or antibiotics, and a better match between donors
and receivers, thereby tailoring microbiota-based precision
treatment. It is very likely that FMT into the upper GI
tract might induce an inflammatory response since this
part usually does not see fecal microbiota, however this
has never been tested. Further, other microorganisms (e.g.,
viruses and fungi) than bacteria have been in the focus of
gut microbiota related effects on host metabolism. Therefore,
more studies are necessary to deceiver their role. Finally, the

mechanisms that may drive the metabolic should be explored
in depth.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
It is accepted already for several decades that an increased
inflammatory tone has major influences on the glucose
metabolism (60, 65). For example, expansion and infiltration of
pro-inflammatory immune cells is present in several metabolic
active tissues during the development of T2D (21, 92). This
pro-inflammatory milieu has vast consequences on the organ
function as seen in the development of insulin resistance (73),
beta cell dysfunction (343), and fatty liver disease (344). The
trigger or origin of this inflammatory response is still elusive.
Only recently, we started to understand the role of the gut
microbiota in those processes.
There is a great afford to identify and describe the underlying
metabolic and inflammatory pathways; however, studies are
often contradictory. Particularly, murine knock out models
frequently give inconclusive results (216, 237, 298) and numerous
inflammatory mediators have dual roles (93, 103, 228). Further,
players of the immune system serve important physiological
functions (other than purely inflammation) and have tissue
specific responses (9, 345). These findings highlight that the
immune system is a complex organization, which is often neither
pro- nor anti-inflammatory per se. Additional, a controlled
(acute) inflammatory response is important for the host to
fight invading pathogens and remove damaged tissue. However,
this resolution is disturbed in metabolic diseases leading to
metainflammation. Environmental factors such as the diet (346)
and genetics (347) appear to be the main drivers for those
deviations. Lastly, research in metainflammation focuses on
typical pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF,
with less work done on anti-inflammatory mediators. Future
treatment strategies could aim to increase anti-inflammatory
cytokines in obese and diabetic humans.
To sustain a symbiotic relationship with the gut microbiota,
a controlled and appropriate immune response is essential to
benefit from the gut microbiota’s numerous functions (348).
Recent studies suggest a disturbed immune intestinal immune
response in obesity (188). Further, the host influences the
microbiota via the diet. By ingesting a diet rich in fiber,
we promote the production of SCFAs that can improve the
hosts energy homeostasis (275), glucose tolerance (277) and
particularly the regulation of an adequate inflammatory response
(349). Not only a reduced fiber intake (271), but also a genetically
dependent lower butyrate update is present in T2D (164). Both
functions, the gut microbiota (6) and the intestinal immune
system (188), are disturbed in metabolic diseases. However, it is
not clear which disturbance comes first.
Several potential mechanisms on how the microbiota
influence glucose metabolism and inflammation have been
described (114, 225, 247). Though, numerous contradictory
reports make it difficult to make a clear conclusion (237, 280).
Understanding housing techniques and the vivarium of animals
are important for the research field (350). Further, lack of
technical understanding might explain several contradictory
findings in microbiota research. Omics and (bio) informatical
strategies are getting more complex and difficult to grasp for the
majority of scientists. Standardized and transparent protocols are
important to move the field forward (351).
The concept of bacterial translocation is a good example for
the lack of technical understanding (178, 179, 352). Although it is
a reasonable concept, low amounts of bacteria in systemic tissue
sides make it difficult to trust histology or sequencing techniques
due to background noise. The identification of small bacterial
metabolites is more plausible (114, 270, 353). We are only at the
beginning to understand the effects of microbial metabolites on
the host health.
Techniques to identify and describe microorganism are
getting more affordable and available for the majority of
research groups (354). Thereby, several bacterial species
have been discovered and were associated with metabolic
abnormalities (6, 143). Identification of single relevant
strains is important to decipher mechanistic interactions,
however the gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem with
thousands of different groups of microorganisms. For
example, the role of the virome (355) or mycobiome (356)
is less explored. In that respect, a recent study highlight the
influence of the fecal virome on glucose tolerance during
FMT (355). More effort is needed to understand the whole
microbial ecosystem.
Lastly, treatments targeting the gut microbiota to expand
beneficial bacteria or exchange a “dysbiotic” microbiota
with a symbiotic one show promising result. FMTs display
moderate effects in metabolic diseases, however with a
limited duration (342). Similarly, probiotic treatment only
show moderate to no success (284). Individual microbiomes
and responses to bacterial treatment are major challenges
that have to be further evaluated (337, 342). Some of
these findings might be explained by regional and ethnical
differences (357, 358). Modifying existing bacteria might be
a novel way to improve the response and help to regulate
inflammation (336).
The field of microbiota research is very young
with several challenges, but enormous potential. The
complex relationship between millions of different
microorganism, thousands host cell types and
molecular mediators make it difficult to grasp the
mechanism, but technical advantages are moving the
field forward.
