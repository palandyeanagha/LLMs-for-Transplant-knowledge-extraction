Abstract
Background: Alcoholic hepatitis is the most florid presentation of alcohol-related liver disease. In its severe form,
defined by a Maddrey’s discriminant function (DF) ≥32, the 28-day mortality rate is approximately 35%. A number
of potential treatments have been subjected to clinical trials, of which two, corticosteroids and pentoxifylline, may
have therapeutic benefit. The role of corticosteroids is controversial as trial results have been inconsistent, whereas
the role of pentoxifylline requires confirmation as only one previous placebo-controlled trial has been published.
Methods/design: STOPAH is a multicentre, double-blind, factorial (2 × 2) trial in which patients are randomised to
one of four groups:
1. Group A: placebo / placebo
2. Group B: placebo / prednisolone
3. Group C: pentoxifylline / placebo
4. Group D: pentoxifylline / prednisolone
The trial aims to randomise 1,200 patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis, in order to provide sufficient power to
determine whether either of the two interventions is effective. The primary endpoint of the study is mortality at 28
days, with secondary endpoints being mortality at 90 days and 1 year.
Discussion: STOPAH aims to be a definitive study to resolve controversy around the existing treatments for
alcoholic hepatitis. Eligibility criteria are based on clinical parameters rather than liver biopsy, which are aligned with
standard clinical practice in most hospitals. The use of a factorial design will allow two treatments to be evaluated
in parallel, with efficient use of patient numbers to achieve high statistical power.

Background
Alcohol-related illness places an enormous burden upon
health services. A recent review of the burden of liver
disease in Europe confirms the prominence of alcohol as
the most important cause of cirrhosis and liver-related
mortality in Europe. In the UK it has been estimated by
the Royal College of Physicians of London that the inpatient costs in 1998-1999 arising from the consequences of alcohol misuse were as high as £2.9 billion
[1]. Overall, alcohol-related deaths in the UK have more
than doubled since 1979, and in Scotland have increased
by 236% between 1980 and 2002 [2,3]. Throughout the
UK deaths from cirrhosis have risen dramatically between 1987 and 1991 [4]. Alcohol-related liver disease
(ALD) accounts for majority of alcohol-related deaths in
the UK [5]. While many patients presenting with alcoholic liver disease will have cirrhosis, as many as 60%
will have evidence of an alcohol-related hepatitis [6]. Alcoholic hepatitis is the most florid manifestation of
alcohol-related liver disease, but is potentially reversible.
However the short-term mortality of alcoholic hepatitis
is particularly high among those with indicators of severe disease. The 28-day mortality of patients who have
a Maddrey’s discriminant function (DF) ≥32 is 30% to
40% [7-9]. The 28-day mortality of patients who have a
Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS) ≥9 is approximately 60% [10]. Alcoholic hepatitis affects a relatively young population (average age, 50 years; patients
may present in their 20s and 30s). Despite the increasing
prevalence and the severity of this disease, there is no
consistency in its management.
Since 1971 there have been 13 randomised studies and
four meta-analyses investigating the role of corticosteroid
therapy for alcoholic hepatitis [11]. Despite this apparent
wealth of evidence, controversy persists. There remains
deep division with regard to the use of corticosteroids. Advocates of the treatment cite significant improvement in
the short to medium term mortality, while detractors cite
the risks of sepsis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage with
corticosteroid therapy. Many of the published studies have
been plagued by widely varying inclusion and exclusion
criteria. The largest placebo-controlled study treated 90
patients and found no benefit with prednisolone compared with a similar placebo-treated group [12]. This study
was hampered by the inclusion of patients with both moderate and severe alcoholic hepatitis, as well as end-stage alcoholic liver disease. In the only study to require
histological confirmation of alcoholic hepatitis in all patients, prednisolone was associated with a short-term improvement in mortality in patients, although this benefit
was not apparent after 2 years [13,14]. However, on review
of the published studies, none of these reach an adequate
statistical power to make a statement with 80% confidence. The most recent meta-analysis by the Cochrane
Group, of all of the available trials, demonstrated that although there was a trend of benefit with corticosteroids,
the results were not statistically significant (P=0.2) [15].
However, a re-analysis of the five most recent studies indicated a significant benefit from corticosteroid [16]. In this
study, patients with DF ≥32 treated with prednisolone had
a 28-day mortality of 20%, as opposed to a mortality of
34.3% among placebo-treated patients (P=0.006).
Pentoxifylline has also recently been studied in the
treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. It is believed to act, in
part, by inhibiting the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory
cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha. There has been
one randomised placebo controlled trial which showed
significant benefit [17]. One hundred patients were enrolled, all with a DF >32. Pentoxifylline was administered
for 4 weeks, at a dose of 400 mg TDS. A total of 12/49
(24.5%) in the pentoxifylline group died compared to 24/
52 (46.1%) in the placebo group during the index hospitalisation (P=0.037). The principal benefit for the agent
appeared to be a reduction of deaths attributed to
hepatorenal syndrome.
One study has compared prednisolone with pentoxifylline
and suggested a survival benefit with pentoxifylline at 3
months (85.3% compared to 64.7%; P=0.04). Hepatorenal
failure again appeared to be less in the pentoxifylline group.
However, this was a small study with only 34 patients in
each group [18]. The comparison of prednisolone alone
against prednisolone plus pentoxifylline has been assessed
in two studies. The COPE Trial studied 70 patients and
found similar 28-day survival for steroid treated patients
with or without pentoxifylline (73.5% and 72.2%, respectively) [19]. A further study published in abstract form was
similarly unable to show a difference in the rate of 28-day
mortality [20]. In addition, one study looked at the effect of
switching from prednisolone to pentoxifylline in those patients who showed no evidence of a response after 7 days
of steroid treatment [21]. Again there was no difference in
mortality between these groups.
The primary objective of this study is to determine
whether corticosteroids or pentoxifylline reduce the
mortality associated with severe alcoholic hepatitis at 28
days, 90 days and 1 year. In order to avoid the controversies caused by underpowered studies in this field, we
aim to conduct a well-powered definitive study.
Methods/design
The study design is a multicentre, double-blind, factorial
(2 × 2) trial in which patients are randomised to one of
four groups:
1 Group A: placebo / placebo
2 Group B: placebo / prednisolone
3 Group C: pentoxifylline / placebo
4 Group D: pentoxifylline / prednisolone

Patients admitted to participating hospitals with a clinical diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis are screened using the
inclusion and exclusion criteria below. Clinical and demographic data are transmitted to the TENALEA web-based
registration/randomisation service, which randomises the
patient to a treatment group stratified by disease severity
and geographical region.
Clinical study endpoints
The primary endpoint is mortality at 28 days; this time
point represents the end of the peak period of mortality
for alcoholic hepatitis and is consistent with other trials
in the field [22]. Secondary endpoints will look at mortality at 90 days and 1 year, outcome relative to GAHS,
rates of recidivism, hospital re-admission rates for liver
or non-liver related events, rates of gastrointestinal
haemorrhage and sepsis, and rates of new or recurrent
renal failure (serum creatinine >500 μmol/L or requiring
renal support) and any other adverse events or serious
adverse events recorded using NCI CTCAE v4.0). In
addition incremental NHS costs and quality of life
(QOL) using SF36 and EQ-5D will be collected to facilitate health economic analysis.
Patient population
Patients, at least 18 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of
alcoholic hepatitis on admission to hospital are considered
for inclusion in the study. Eligibility criteria (Appendices A
& B) are used to select those patients with severe alcoholic
hepatitis (defined by a Maddrey’s DF >32) and to exclude
patients with other hepatological diagnoses. As the trial is
being conducted in more than 60 hospitals across the UK,
many of which do not have access to transjugular liver biopsy, it was decided not to make liver histology an entry
criteria. However, in order to exclude patients with decompensated cirrhosis, a strict time limit was set on the duration of jaundice.
In the majority of published trials, patients with
gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis and renal failure prior to
randomisation have been excluded from the study. In
this trial, patients with gastrointestinal bleeding are eligible for randomisation once they have been stabilised
for 48 h. All patients are carefully screened for infection,
by clinical examination, chest radiology, blood and urine
cultures and, if found to have evidence of sepsis, are
treated with appropriate antibiotics for a minimum of 2
days. Once the local investigator considers the infection
to be under control, the patient is then eligible for randomisation. This strategy is justified by the recent observation that the outlook of patients with AH receiving
corticosteroids is unaffected by their having had a recent
infection treated with antibiotics [23]. Patients who are
oligo-anuric (urine output < 400 mL / 24 h), have a creatinine >500 uM/L or who require renal support, are
given appropriate resuscitation therapy for up to 1 week.
These patients may then be re-screened and considered
for randomisation, once they meet eligibility criteria.
Consent
Patient information sheets are given to potential patients
at least 24 h before consent is sought. Potential patients
for the trial who present with hepatic encephalopathy may
be unable to consent for themselves, but are not excluded
from the trial. Special arrangements are in place to ensure
that the interests of such patients are protected. When
considering a patient who is unable to consent for themselves for suitability for the trial, the decision on whether
to consent to, or refuse, participation in a trial is taken by
a ‘legal representative’ who is independent of the research
team and who acts on the basis of the person’s presumed
wishes. The legal representative is generally the next of
kin but where the next of kin is not available or unwilling
to take the decision, a hospital-appointed medical practitioner unconnected to the trial is asked to provide consent. The consent given by the legal representative
remains valid in law until such time as the patient recovers
capacity. At this point, the patient is informed about the
trial and asked to decide whether or not they want to continue in the trial, and consent to continue is sought from
the patient themself.
Randomisation
After consent is given, patients are registered in the trial
via TENALEA, a web-based registration and randomisation system, and then undergo screening assessments. If
eligible for the study, patients are randomised via the
ALEA system to a study treatment group, which is
blinded to the site staff and the patient, by means of a
unique four-digit patient pack number.
Randomisation is block stratified and performed using
the following two stratification factors:
1. Geographic region (12 in total)
2. Risk group: either high or intermediate risk (high
risk is defined as either sepsis or history of GI
bleeding in the previous 7 days or creatinine
>150 μmol/L or any combination of the these;
intermediate risk is defined as no sepsis and no
history of GI bleeding in the previous 7 days and
creatinine ≤150 μmol/L).
Intervention
Each patient is provided with two bottles labeled ‘Bottle
A’ and ‘Bottle B’ containing the investigational medical
products. Bottle A contains opaque gelatin capsules
filled either with tablets of pentoxifylline 400 mg or
identical placebo capsules filled with microcrystalline
cellulose. Patients are instructed to take one capsule
Forrest et al. Trials 2013, 14:262 Page 3 of 7
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/262

from bottle A three times daily. Bottle B contains
opaque gelatin capsules filled either with tablets of prednisolone 40 mg or identical placebo capsules filled with
microcrystalline cellulose. Patients are instructed to take
one capsule from bottle B once daily. Both medications
are administered for 28 days.
Alcohol withdrawal therapy is administered if required. All patients receive supportive nutritional therapy with nutritional supplements in the first instance. If
they are unable to take these, they are offered enteral
nutrition via a nasogastric tube with the aim of providing
35 to 40 kcal/kg/day non-protein energy with 1.5 g/kg/
day protein.
Evaluations during and after treatment
Patients are evaluated while an inpatient on treatment
days 7, 14, 21, and 28 and at each time point recordings made of vital signs, WHO performance status,
concomitant medication and adverse events. Blood
samples are taken for liver function tests, prothrombin
time, full blood count, urea and creatinine. Patients
are assessed for the presence of hepatic encephalopathy and the occurrence of GI bleed or sepsis in previous 7 days. If patients are discharged from hospital
before the end of treatment, assessments are made at
28 days by telephone interview. A complete schedule
of procedures is given in Additional file 1 (Trial Procedures;
Schedule of procedures).
After discharge from hospital, patients are evaluated at 90
days and at one year. At each time point recordings are
made of vital signs, WHO performance status, concomitant
medication and adverse events. Blood samples are taken for
liver function tests, prothrombin time, full blood count,
urea and creatinine. Patients are assessed for the presence
of hepatic encephalopathy and the occurrence of GI bleed
or sepsis since previous assessment. In addition, patients
are asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire (Short
Form 36 and EQ-5D) and an assessment is made of their
current alcohol consumption. At registration patients are
asked to consent to follow-up via medical research information service, now called the NHS Information Centre
Data Linkage service. This ensures that if patients are lost
to follow-up should the patient die, we would obtain their
date of death for analysis via this service.
Statistical considerations
Power calculation
In order to estimate the required trial sample size a
power calculation was performed in nQuery Advisor
using a two group continuity corrected χ2 test and the
following parameters:
 Power = 90% (to allow for secondary outcomes)
 Two-sided significance level of 5%
 Estimated 28-day mortality rate in each treatment
group is given in Table 1.
Based on a reduction in the 28-day mortality rate at
the margins from 30% to 21%, a sample size of 513 per
group of single agent versus no single agent would be required. Thus in total the trial would require 1,026 patients. We have allowed for an approximate 10%
withdrawal/lost to follow-up rate and will therefore aim
to recruit 1,200 patients to the study, with patients being
evenly allocated to each treatment arm.
The sample size for this trial has not been powered to
assess for any observed treatment interaction and in fact
assumes no interaction between the two treatments (that
is, that receiving prednisolone in addition to pentoxifylline
does not change the effect of pentoxyfylline and vice
versa). To be able to assess the interaction of two treatments, while keeping power at 90%, generally requires an
increase in the sample size by four-fold [24]. As assessing
the size of any interaction was not of primary interest as it
was assumed to be small or non-existent, it was deemed
appropriate to not power for assessing an interaction.
Statistical analyses
Analysis will be on the basis of intention to treat (ITT).
In order to determine the efficacy of prednisolone, the
28-day mortality rate in those treated with prednisolone
(that is, Groups B and D) will be compared with the
mortality rate in control groups (Groups A and C). Similarly, the efficacy of pentoxifylline will be assessed by
comparing the 28-day mortality rate in Groups C and D
with the mortality rate in Groups A and B.
Although the study is not powered to detect a difference between two active treatments and single agent
therapy, we will make this comparison for 28-day mortality rates. Logistic regression will be used to compare
28-day mortality between the treatment groups. The impact of pre-treatment variables such as gastrointestinal
bleeding, sepsis or renal impairment on admission will
be estimated by adding these covariates to the logistic
regression analysis. Mortality rates at 90 days and 12
months will be compared using the same strategy. All
analyses will be adjusted for the stratification variables
and assessed at the two-sided 5% significance level.

However, the impact of recidivism and hospital readmission will also be assessed in relation to these
outcomes.
Overall mortality will also be analysed as a secondary
endpoint using the method of Kaplan-Meier and a coxproportional hazards model adjusting for the same variables as explained above.
Rates of gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis and renal failure will be summarised over time and by arm.
Stata for Windows (StataCorp) and SAS (SAS insititute
inc) will be the statistical packages of choice. The study
will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT
(Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement.
Trial organisation
Trial funding
The trial is funded by the UK National Institute for
Health Research Health Technology Assessment Board
(NIHR-HTA): 08/.14/44 http://www.hta.ac.uk/project/
2015.asp.
Trial management group
The Trial Management Group (TMG) is composed of a
chairperson, vice chair, trial statistician, trial manager and
12 of the principal investigators. The TMG is responsible
for approval of the trial design, reviewing and advising on
trial recruitment, reviewing the final results, approving publications and approval of secondary studies.
TMG executive group
The TMG Executive Group (TMG EG) is composed of
the chairperson and vice chair of the TMG, one additional principal investigator, the trial statistician and the
trial manager. The TMG EG is responsible for the conduct of the study, implementing decisions of the full
TMG and ensuring that recruitment and data collection
occur at an acceptable rate.
Data monitoring and ethics committee
The Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) is
composed of a clinical chair, an independent hepatologist
and an independent statistician. The DMEC, in accordance
with ICH-GCP guidelines is responsible for safeguarding
the interests of trial participants, monitoring the main outcome measures including safety and efficacy, and monitoring the overall conduct of the trial. The DMEC receive, on
a periodical basis, unblinded data on trial recruitment and
data quality, outcome measures and safety data. The
DMEC is required to assess emerging external evidence
which might influence the ethical position of the trial. The
committee is also expected to advise on any protocol modifications and whether the trial (or specific treatment
groups) should be stopped early.
In agreement with the DMEC pre-planned interim analyses will be carried out after 200, 400 and 800 patients have
reached the primary endpoint. Pre-specified stopping guidelines based on the Peto-Haybittle rule will be used at these
interim looks. Namely, a two-sided P value <0.001 for harm
or benefit (symmetrical stopping boundary) would indicate
the DMEC recommend that the study or certain trial arms
should be stopped. This method is being used because the
treatments are already in use in practice and should evidence of harm or benefit arise, it needs to be convincing to
ensure that others will change their practice accordingly. A
P value of 0.001 is sufficiently small that the sample size
does not need to be adjusted for these interim analyses [25].
Ethical approval
Ethical approval was provided by the Wales Research
Ethics Committee (Reference 09/MRE09/59) and a clinical trials authorisation issued by the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (Reference 11709/0227/001-0001).
Discussion
An objective review of the literature on the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis inevitably encounters the controversy over
the use of corticosteroids and the lack of confirmatory data
on the use of pentoxifylline. Current international guidelines
recommend the use of corticosteroids except in patients
with sepsis, where pentoxifylline is the first choice of treatment [26]. These recommendations are attributed a lower
grade of evidence acknowledging the controversies outlined
above. Given the importance of this condition, a definitive
large trial was required to settle the dilemma. If corticosteroids prove to be successful in this trial, it would still be reasonable to expect a mortality rate of 20% in treated patients
based on the analysis of recent trials. There will remain an
unmet medical need in this field, but at least future trials
will legitimately use a steroid (or pentoxifylline) control arm
based on solid evidence.
At the heart of the controversy over the use of corticosteroids is susceptibility to infection. Although 40 mg
daily of prednisolone is considered a moderate dose, this
group of patients is already highly susceptible to infection and corticosteroids are likely to exacerbate this
problem. The emergence of infection during treatment
is associated with a significant increment in the mortality rate [23].
Optimally, all patients enrolled in a treatment trial for
alcoholic hepatitis would have a liver biopsy to confirm
the diagnosis histologically [26]. However, the group of
patients addressed by this study invariably have a
coagulopathy and cannot be subjected to percutaneous
biopsy. Transjugular liver biopsy is only available in specialist centres but alcoholic hepatitis is not usually considered as an indication for transfer to tertiary care. In addition
Forrest et al. Trials 2013, 14:262 Page 5 of 7
http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/14/1/262

even in specialist centres adequate histological samples may
not be obtained in up to 4% of patients and biopsies may
not be undertaken for a week after admission [27]. Previous
studies which have a defined minimum level of bilirubin
have confirmed histological features of alcoholic hepatitis in
98% of patients [28] and 96% of patients with acute-onchronic liver alcoholic liver disease [29]. It was therefore decided to use strict clinical criteria including a minimum
threshold of bilirubin to define the eligible patient group.
This is a pragmatic decision which aligns the trial with the
clinical practice that it should influence. Histology data will
be collected from participating centres which have access to
transjugular liver biopsy and used to validate the clinical
criteria.
The primary endpoint of ‘mortality at 28 days’ was selected to align the study with previous trials in this area.
As one previous trial showed important divergence between treatment groups after the 28-day time point arising due to increased rates of infection in the steroid
arm, we believe that the 90-day mortality comparison
will also be of interest to clinicians [30]. Previous studies
have demonstrated that mortality beyond this time point
is predominantly influenced by recidivism rather than
the initial treatment choice [20].
Factorial 2 × 2 design is a well-established technique for
concurrently assessing the benefit of two active treatments
and is particularly appropriate in this situation where doubt
exists over the efficacy of both medications. Factorial design
trials are generally more powerful in detecting treatment effects unless there is a strong synergistic or inhibitory interaction between the two active medications. This is not
considered to be likely in the current trial and it has rarely
been observed in published trial results [31]. The two studies which have compared treatment with corticosteroids
alone against the combination of corticosteroids and
pentoxifylline have failed to demonstrate any difference in
mortality rate between the two groups despite reasonable
patient numbers. If the same is found in the current study
then the assumption around no interaction between prednisolone and pentoxifylline may be challenged, in which
case the trial will need to be analysed as a four-arm, which
will inevitably reduce the study power and increase the
width of any estimated confidence intervals.
