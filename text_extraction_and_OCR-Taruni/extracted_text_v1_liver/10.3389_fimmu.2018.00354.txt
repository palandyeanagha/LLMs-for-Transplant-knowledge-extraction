Solid organ transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage organ 
dysfunction. Despite improvements in short-term outcome, long-term outcome is 
suboptimal due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with the toxicity of 
immunosuppressive regimens and chronic rejection (1–5). As such, the attention of the 
transplant community has focused on the development of novel therapeutic strategies to 
achieve allograft tolerance, a state whereby the immune system of the recipient can be 
re-educated to accept the allograft, averting the need for long-term immunosuppression. 
Indeed, reports of “operational” tolerance, whereby the recipient is off all immunosuppressive drugs and maintaining good graft function, is well documented in the literature 
for both liver and kidney transplantations (6–8). However, this phenomenon is rare and 
in the setting of liver transplantation has been shown to occur late after transplantation, with the majority of patients maintained on life-long immunosupression to prevent 
allograft rejection (9). As such, significant research has focused on immune regulation 
in the context of organ transplantation with regulatory T cells (Tregs) identified as cells 
holding considerable promise in this endeavor. This review will provide a brief introduction to human Tregs, their phenotypic and functional characterization and focuses on our 
experience to date at the clinical translation of Treg immunotherapy in the setting of solid 
organ transplantation.

Tregs: PHENOTYPE AND HETEROGENEITY
Tregs are characterized by the expression of CD4 and CD25 molecules and more specifically the transcription factor FOXP3, a master control gene underpinning Treg development and function. More 
recently, the inverse expression of the α-chain of IL-7R, CD127, combined with the expression of 
CD4 and CD25 has been shown to demarcate a pure population of Tregs demonstrating stability and 
optimal function (10, 11). Tregs are far from homogenous and over the years have been characterized 
into several subsets, most of which have been associated with various facets of Treg function (12).

Treg subsets can firstly be stratified according to their origin: 
thymus-derived and peripherally derived Tregs (tTregs and 
pTregs, respectively). While there have been phenotypic markers 
which have suggested differentiation between the two subsets, 
such as Helios and Neuropilin-1, to date these are still contentious 
(13–16). The only way to reliably differentiate tTregs and pTregs 
has been to interrogate the Treg-specific demethylated region 
(TSDR). Here, tTregs display a fully demethylated TSDR, whereas 
pTregs are only partially demethylated (17–20). Furthermore, 
Tregs have also been delineated on account of their antigen 
naivety in relation to their differential expression of CD45RA 
and FOXP3. The seminal work of Miyara et  al., described the 
heterogeneity of the Treg population in three phenotypically and 
functionally distinct subpopulations: Population I (P1) naive 
or resting Tregs (CD45RA+FOXP3Lo); population II (P2) effector Tregs (CD45RA−FOXP3Hi), both of which are suppressive 
in vitro; and population III (P3) the “non-suppressive,” cytokine 
secreting non-Tregs (CD45RA−FOXP3Lo) (21). However, we and 
others have previously shown that population III is indeed suppressive, and within this population, identified a subpopulation 
of Tregs that express the C-type lectin CD161 and produce the 
proinflammatory cytokine, IL-17 (22–24).
In support of the heterogeneity of the Treg compartment, using 
a new technology, the single-cell mass cytometry (cytometry by 
time-of-flight) we have conducted an in-depth characterization 
of Tregs, further demonstrating the true extent of their heterogeneity, with 22 different clusters identified (25). In the clinical 
setting and through utilizing the same principles and technology, 
Kordasti et al. identified the Treg subset that predicted response 
to immunosuppressive therapy in patients with aplastic anemia 
(26). Additionally, we have recently extended the analysis of 
T helper-like subpopulations of Tregs, demonstrating that Th2-
like Tregs are enriched in the tumor sites (27). There is no doubt 
that the future will see the discovery of many more markers heralding Treg purity. For an in-depth review into Treg phenotype 
subsets the reader is directed to the following reviews (12, 28, 29).
Treg MECHANISM OF ACTION
Tregs are defined by their immunoregulatory suppressive 
qualities. However, no one mechanism defines Tregs. Instead, 
it is believed that several mechanisms behave in concert, which 
promote immune regulation. All T  lymphocytes rely on IL-2 
for their survival and proliferation. By their expression of the 
interleukin 2 receptor, CD25, Tregs deplete stores of IL-2, curbing the survival of surrounding T lymphocytes (28). In a more 
active mechanism of suppression, the Treg surface molecule, 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), is known to bind 
the costimulatory molecules CD80/86 with a higher affinity 
than its proinflammatory competitor CD28, expressed on conventional T effector cells, thus preventing T effector activation. 
This negative costimulatory molecule has also been proposed to 
upregulate indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase expression on dendritic 
cells, responsible for the catabolism of tryptophan, which in turn 
suppresses immune responses through the generation of the 
immunosuppressive molecules, in particular kynurenine (30). 
Further in-depth investigation into the mechanism of action of 
CTLA-4 has revealed that CD80/86 ligands on antigen-presenting 
cells (APCs) are captured by a process of trans-endocytosis, in 
turn impairing further T cell activation (31–33). Deficiencies in 
CTLA-4 have been associated with lymphoproliferative disorders 
and the development of severe T-cell-mediated autoimmune 
diseases, which is why CTLA-4 is recognized as a key molecular 
target governing Treg-mediated suppression (33, 34).
The ectoenzyme, CD39, is abundantly expressed on Tregs, its 
expression allows Tregs to hydrolyze the proinflammatory danger 
signal, adenosine triphosphate, to the anti-inflammatory mediator, adenosine, which following interaction with the adenosine 
A2A receptor, has been reported to have immunosuppressive and 
anti-proliferative effects (35). CD39+ Tregs have also been found 
to suppress the release of IL-17, alongside IFN-γ and IL-2, from 
Th17 cells, while CD39− T cells had an increased propensity to 
produce IL-17 (36). Furthermore, the reconstitution of positively 
selected CD39-null mouse models of colitis with soluble apyrase, 
a mediator with enzymatic activity identical to CD39, reversed 
their increased susceptibility to develop auto-immune diseases 
and prevented a Th-1 skewed immune response. Further studies by Gibson et  al., have highlighted the importance of CD39 
expression for Treg mechanism of action in a T  cell transfer 
model of colitis (37). Additionally, we have established a further 
mechanism by which Tregs function through the release of 
exosomes, expressing ectoenzyme CD73, which regulate target 
cells through the purinergic generation of adenosine (38).
Reports have also suggested a cytotoxic role of Tregs in depleting 
T effector numbers through a perforin-dependent and granzymedependent manner (39). Similarly, there have been reports of 
Tregs expressing Galectin-9, which following binding with the 
T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 receptor CD44 on effector T cells, has been shown to induce apoptosis 
(40). More recently, this mechanism of suppression has been 
proposed to be limited to pTregs (41). It has also been postulated 
that Tregs have the capacity for cytokine-mediated suppression 
involving the regulatory cytokines: IL-10 (42), TGF-β (43, 44), 
and more recently IL-35 (45).
Treg ISOLATION AND EXPANSION
Clinical trials of Treg therapy in transplantation are focused on 
tipping the balance of immune homeostasis in favor of regulation. 
However, in order for this to occur the in vivo Treg pool needs 
to be expanded significantly in order to drive immune tolerance 
(46). As such, there has been huge interest in either the in vivo
expansion of these cells or their adoptive transfer. Here, we focus 
on the prerequisites that need to be fulfilled in order to permit the 
adoptive transfer of these cells.
Firstly, Tregs need to be isolated from the peripheral blood and 
this is by no means an easy feat. As mentioned earlier, Tregs are 
highly heterogenous and as such, the debate of which population of 
Tregs would serve as optimal cell product in adoptive transfers is a 
highly discussed topic. Isolation to date has largely been governed 
by magnetic bead isolation, a process whereby depletion of CD8+
T  cells and positive selection of CD25+ T  cells using magnetic 

3

beads allows isolation of Tregs (47, 48). This process results in 
the separation of a consistent number of cells from whole blood 
using an approach that has been utilized by us in the two clinical 
trials aimed at testing the safety of expanded autologous Tregs in 
patients receiving either kidney (ONE Study, NCT02129881) or 
liver (ThRIL, NCT02166177) transplants. However, this process 
does not allow for enrichment based on multiple parameters and 
isolating Tregs based upon CD25+ expression alone results in 
contaminating T effector cells which express low levels of CD25 
molecules. Methods to overcome this have been explored in Treg 
expansion. One such strategy is the ex vivo expansion of these cells 
in the presence of the mTOR-inhibitor, rapamycin (RAPA) (49).
We and others have shown that RAPA is an ideal treatment 
strategy for preferential expansion of Tregs (50–52). RAPA confers a proliferative advantage to Tregs by affecting the Akt/mTor 
pathway. Indeed, the molecular signal controlled by this pathway 
is not essential for Tregs, but crucial for the activation and proliferation of conventional T cells (51, 53). Using this approach, 
we have shown that large-scale expansion of functionally potent 
Tregs is possible when starting from a population of cells with 
low purity (48). In our studies, another potential candidate drug 
for the expansion of Tregs is the vitamin A metabolite, all-trans 
retinoic acid (ATRA). Some studies have shown that ATRA can 
be a good treatment for the induction of adaptive Tregs (54) or 
very pure Tregs (55). Our data showed that ATRA favors the 
ex vivo expansion of a population of highly suppressive Tregs 
from magnetic bead purified Tregs, although these cells produce 
a significant amount of IL-17 and IFN-γ following stimulation. 
However, further characterization of Tregs cultured with ATRA 
has shown the expansion of FOXP3+CD161+ Tregs (51), which is 
encouraging based on our previous work reporting that CD161 
identifies a specific sub-population of IL-17-producing FOXP3+
Tregs with a strong capacity to suppress conventional T  cell 
proliferation (22). In contrast, Tregs expanded in the presence of 
RAPA show decreased expression of CD161, as well as reduced 
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The combined treatment of Tregs with RAPA and ATRA demonstrated that the suppressive function and stability of Tregs is maintained (decreased 
CD161 expression and lack of IL-17 production).
This analysis was extended to the subtypes of Tregs and while 
P2 Tregs did not expand in vitro, P1 Tregs expanded well in the 
presence of RAPA, ATRA or the combination of the two drugs. 
In contrast, RAPA (alone or in combination with ATRA) strongly 
reduced P3 Treg proliferation, while the treatment with ATRA 
alone showed a negligible inhibitory effect on the expansion of 
this subset (51). In support of this observation, we have unpublished data showing that when P1 and P3 were cultured together 
at 1:1 ratio, the presence of RAPA, but not ATRA, gave a much 
stronger proliferative advantage to P1 on P3 Tregs. At the end 
of culture, P1 could overgrow P3 Tregs. Additional experiments 
showed that RAPA treatment could inhibit the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines in the P3 subset and negatively affect 
the expansion of FOXP3+CD161+ Tregs (51). Finally, we have also 
demonstrated that these treatments can influence the migratory 
ability of expanded Tregs. Our findings showed that the treatment 
of Tregs with RAPA led to the expression of skin-homing receptors 
cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen and CCR4 (51), as well 
as CXCR3, a chemokine receptor which enables homing to the 
liver (48). Instead, Treg cultures in the presence of ATRA resulted 
in a high percentage of cells coexpressing gut-homing receptors 
such as CCR9 and α4β7 (51).
TECHNICAL TRANSFER OF THE Treg 
MANUFACTURING PROCESS INTO 
THE GOOD MANUFACTURING 
PROCESS (GMP) UNIT
One of the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of translating the extensive research carried out in the laboratory to the 
clinical setting is the transfer of research protocols into a GMP 
unit. This process, referred to as technical transfer, requires 
careful management to ensure the resulting product maintains a 
consistently high level of quality, while achieving the aim of the 
researcher. In this pursuit, a manufacturing process was developed 
with the aim of creating a Treg Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) that could be used in the ONE Study (NCT02129881) or 
ThRIL (NCT02166177) clinical trials.
There are many factors to consider during the technical transfer (Figure  1), and important milestones include: the sharing 
of technical information from the research department to the 
GMP facility, process development, preparation of the product 
specifications, process validation and finally authorization of the 
process by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency (MHRA) through the submission of a Clinical Trials 
Authorization (CTA). The process initially starts with the sharing 
of a detailed description of all process raw materials, manufacturing methods, equipment used, specifications, and test methods 
from the transferring research department to the GMP unit. 
It is important to ensure that all raw materials, reagents and 
consumables that were used in the research laboratory are GMPcompatible. During the technical transfer stage of these Treg trials, 
different GMP-compatible reagents and culture conditions were 
compared, ensuring that the final protocol resulted in phenotypically stable Tregs that could be isolated and expanded consistently 
while maintaining their suppressive function (Table 1).
The transfer of the Treg process into the GMP unit also provided the opportunity to optimize the manufacturing method 
and introduce automated processes to increase the levels of 
consistency between batches. The original research process 
included a peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolation using density gradient centrifugation with Ficoll® Paque Plus 
(GE Healthcare, Switzerland) and 50 ml centrifuge tubes. In order 
to close out and automate this process, the SEPAX system (Biosafe, 
Switzerland) was adopted. The SEPAX device is an automated 
cell separation system which processes within closed single-use 
disposable tubing sets. The maximum blood input volume to run 
the NeatCell Programme (SEPAX density gradient cell separation 
using Ficoll® Paque Plus) is 120 ml, therefore the SEPAX volume 
reduction programme (SmartRedux) was introduced to ensure 
the full initial blood sample could be processed. The data generated from these initial runs identified that the volume reduction

step alone was sufficient, as the erythrocytes did not interfere with 
the CliniMACS Plus (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) magnetic cell 
selections.
The specifications of the final product are set by the research 
team and from this information, a product specification file (PSF) 
can be written. The PSF contains, or refers to files containing, all 
the information required to draft the standard operating procedures, batch manufacturing records, and the quality control assay 
forms. These documents ensure standardization and traceability 
of the process for every batch manufactured.
With these documents in place, scale-up runs can be performed 
allowing the manufacture process to be tested within the GMP 
unit and ensuring enough Tregs could be generated to produce 
the dose required for the patients, perform all QC assays and to 
create the required reference and retention samples. During the 
scale-up runs, the opportunity to further close out the system and 
minimize the risk of contamination was taken. For example, Tregs 
were cultured using plates and T-flasks in the research laboratory. 
During the scale-up process, this method was adapted to utilize 
closed-system culture bags. However, it was found that transferring the process into bags reduced the expansion rate of the Tregs. 
In spite of this, the required numbers of Tregs were still achieved 
and so this closed system modification was incorporated into the 
final manufacturing process.
With the manufacturing methods finalized during the scaleup runs and following the validation of the QC assays, the entire 
process was validated by performing six engineering runs. These 
engineering runs provided documented evidence that the GMP 
unit could routinely and consistently produce the Treg product 
that met the required specifications.
The data, from both the research experiments and GMP unit, 
was compiled to create the IMP Dossier (IMDP). This document 
contains information on the quality, manufacture and control 
of the IMP. This is one of the essential documents, along with a 
EudraCT number and approval from an ethics committee, that 
form the CTA submission to the MHRA.

RECRUITMENT AND MANUFACTURE
OF Treg BATCHES IN THE ONE STUDY 
AND ThRIL TRIAL
The ONE Study (NCT02129881) initiated in 2014, a dose-escalation 
phase I/II trial carried out under a large EU consortium. The 
aim of The ONE Study was to evaluate different regulatory cells 
in kidney transplant recipients allowing the direct comparison of 
the safety, practicality and therapeutic effect of each cell type. In 
the UK, in collaboration with The University of Oxford, our group 
manufactured sixteen batches of polyclonal Tregs, of which 12 were 
certified for administration. A dose escalation design was implemented with four escalating doses of 1 × 106
, 3 × 106, 6 × 106, and 
10 × 106
/kg, with the last patient being treated with the maximum 
dose in January 2016. Four of the batches could not be certified 
and dosed, three of which were due to insufficient cell numbers to 
formulate the dose and one batch failing the release criteria due to 
bacterial contamination. High levels of variability were observed 
in the expansion capability of the Tregs obtained from different 
patients. Due to this, a substantial amendment was made to the 
IMPD allowing flexibility in setting a date for the harvesting of Treg 
culture. This amendment reduced the risk of failing batches during 
the manufacture of an expensive and time-consuming product.
The last patient in the ThRIL trial (NCT02166177) was dosed in 
July 2017. This was a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of Treg immunotherapy 
in the setting of liver transplantation initiated at King’s College 
London. Here, the safety, tolerability and efficacy of polyclonally 
expanded Tregs in combination with depletion of alloreactive T cells 
(ATG) and short-term immunosuppression was assessed. For this 
trial, patients awaiting a liver transplant were recruited with the aim 
of administering the cell therapy 2  months after transplantation. 
Out of an initial 23 patients enrolled, 7 of these patients received 
a transplant and the manufacture of the Treg IMP was initiated. 
Of these seven batches, three were completed and certified by a 
qualified person for administration. Two patients were removed 
during manufacturing, one due to proteinuria and the other due 
to death unrelated to the transplant. The other two batches did not 
meet the specifications (cell number and purity). The complications 
in patient retention lead to a substantial amendment to the MHRA 
to allow the recruitment of patients 6-month posttransplantation 
rather than while they were on the waiting list. This delay in recruitment was made as the transplanted patients were deemed to be more 
stable, and hence more amenable for cell therapy application. After 
this amendment was approved, a further six batches of the Treg IMP 
were manufactured and these patients were successfully treated.
Although these two trials are still in the patient follow-up 
stage, no serious adverse events have been observed suggesting 
that polyclonal Treg therapies are safe. We are now in the preparation stages of Phase II clinical trials in renal, liver, islet and heart 
transplant patients.
THE RELEVANCE OF SPECIFICITY 
FOR Treg THERAPY
While the polyclonal expansion of Tregs using anti-CD3/antiCD28 
beads is relatively straightforward and readily translatable into the 
clinic, extensive data from preclinical animal studies have demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of Tregs with direct or indirect 
allospecificity are superior to polyclonal Tregs at reducing graft 
rejection (56–58). However, the expansion of antigen-specific 
Tregs presents an additional set of parameters that need to be 
addressed, including the origin of APCs and the dose required. 
Initial studies by Taylor et  al., used allogeneic splenocytes to 
enrich for murine allo-specific Tregs, which were more efficient 
at reducing graft versus host disease in a murine model compared 
to anti-CD3 stimulated Tregs (59). More recently, we have shown 
in a murine transplant model that Tregs need to have both direct 
and indirect allospecificities to induce indefinite survival of heart 
transplants (57). Furthermore, using a humanized transplant 
mouse model, in which immunodeficient mice were reconstituted 
with PBMCs, we show that human Tregs with direct allospecificity 
significantly reduced alloimmune-mediated injury of human skin 
grafts, when compared with polyclonal Tregs. As part of the ONE 
Study Consortium, Tregs with direct allospecificity are currently 
being evaluated at two different sites in the USA (NCT02244801 
and NCT02091232). GMP regulations are far more rigorous in 
Europe compared to USA and the investigators have been able to 
use a standard cell sorter in their manufacturing process to purify 
Tregs, which is not possible in Europe. Few patients have been 
treated to date, but the completion of the trials will undoubtedly 
be very informative with regards to the safety of allospecific Tregs 
and provide possible clues on how well they compare against 
treatment with polyclonal Tregs.
In recent years, the transduction of chimeric antigen receptors 
(CAR) on T cells has shown great promise in the field of cancer 
cell therapy, particularly for B cell lymphomas where there is a 
clear target antigen such as the B lymphocyte antigens, CD20, 
and CD19. This has paved the way for its potential use in Tregs. 
We and others have shown that the expression of CAR in Tregs 
can potentially be used for the treatment of xeno-GVHD and 
allo-graft rejection (60–62). In a human skin xenograft transplant 
model, the adoptive transfer of CAR Tregs were more effective 
at alleviating the alloimmune-mediated skin injury caused by 
transferring allogeneic PBMCs compared to polyclonal Tregs. 
Recently, the US Food and Drug administration approved two 
CAR T cell therapies, the first one, Kymriah (Tisagenlecleucel) 
was developed for the treatment of patients up to 25  years of 
age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 
Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) for the treatment of adults 
with refractory large B cell lymphomas. These approvals signify 
an important development and no doubt will pave the way for 
continued commercialization of cell therapies.
CONCLUSION
A key breakthrough in the translational potential of Treg cell 
therapy was the demonstration that human Tregs could be 
successfully isolated and expanded ex vivo while maintaining 
immunoregulatory function. This has enabled the application 
of these cells in the clinic, leading to Treg adoptive transfer in 
phase I clinical trials of bone marrow transplantation and type I 
diabetes (63–66) and more recently in the setting of solid organ 
transplantation (67, 68). The success of these trials is reliant on

a highly reproducible process for the sustained manufacture of 
autologous patient-derived Tregs. In the setting of solid organ 
transplantation, we are faced with the challenge of a more 
targeted approach to suppress the immune system, and as such 
efforts have focused on the expansion of allo-antigen specific 
Tregs for cell therapy application. Here, we have highlighted 
our experience to date. However, whether a generalized effect 
of immunosuppression by the adoptive transfer of polyclonal 
Tregs could potentially be diminished by more targeted Treg 
therapy requires further investigation. The major drawback of 
the two phase I clinical trials completed by us is that the isolation technique for regulatory T cells relies on first generation 
magnetic bead isolation. The inability of this technique to select 
cells based on stricter criteria (CD25hi) or multiple parameters 
(low expression of CD127) has led to the development of a 
GMP compliant FACS cell sorter (MACSquant Tyto cell sorter, 
Miltenyi Biotech). The validation of the MACSQuant Tyto 
and its GMP accreditation has now meant that we can isolate 
Tregs based on several markers, further enhancing the purity 
and quality of the infused product. The high level of purity 
achieved with the MACSQuant Tyto will allow us to generate 
donor-specific Tregs either by using donor-derived APC or 
by transduction with CAR. Finally, the selection of the most 
favorable Treg population, which will give the best therapeutic 
advantage, will likely be further enhanced by the advent of new 
technologies.
With scientific knowledge and technology rapidly advancing 
in the field, the future of Treg cell therapy is set to only progress 
further. As such, our ultimate aim of immune tolerance in transplantation is soon to become a reality.
