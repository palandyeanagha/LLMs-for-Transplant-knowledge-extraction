Background: Despite improvements in techniques and management of liver transplant 
patients, numerous perioperative complications that contribute to perioperative mortality 
remain. Models to predict intraoperative massive blood transfusion, prolonged mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital mortality in liver transplant recipients have not been identified. In this study we aim to identify preoperative factors associated with the above mentioned complications. 
Methods: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on data collected from 
124 orthotopic liver transplants performed at a single institution between 2014 and 2017. 
A multivariable logistic regression using backwards elimination was performed for three 
defined outcomes (massive transfusion ≥ 10 units packed red blood cells (PRBC), prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h, and in-hospital mortality) to identify associations 
with preoperative characteristics. 
Results: Statistically significant (P < 0.05) associations with massive transfusion ≥ 10 units 
PRBC were hepatocellular carcinoma and preoperative transfusion of PRBC. Significant 
associations with prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h were hepatitis C, alcoholic hepatitis, elevated preoperative alanine aminotransferase, and hepatorenal syndrome. Male 
gender was protective for requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. End-stage renal disease and hepatitis B were significantly associated with increased in-hospital mortality. 
Conclusions: This study identified risk factors associated with common perioperative 
complications of liver transplantation. These factors may assist practitioners in risk stratification and may form the basis for further investigations of potential interventions to mitigate these risks.

Introduction 
Liver transplantation has become an effective life-saving procedure for patients with 
acute liver failure, end-stage liver disease, and hepatic malignancy. Despite this, there are 
many perioperative complications that arise during liver transplantation that contribute 
to perioperative mortality [1]. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has 
been useful in predicting mortality in patients awaiting liver transplantation [2,3]. However, the MELD score has been shown to have non- or low-predictive value for many complications, including intraoperative massive blood transfusion [4,5] and prolonged mechanReceived: March 18, 2019

ical ventilation [6]. Models similar to the MELD score to predict intraoperative massive blood transfusion, prolonged mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital mortality in liver transplant recipients have 
not been identified [7–10]. We aimed to identify preoperative factors associated with massive transfusion ≥ 10 units packed red 
blood cells (PRBC), prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h, and 
in-hospital mortality in liver transplant recipients by conducting a 
retrospective review of comorbidities, preoperative abnormalities, 
and laboratory values. We hypothesized that specific pre-operative 
patient characteristics would be associated with the above mentioned complications. 
Materials and Methods 
Study sample 
Data were collected retrospectively from the data warehouse of 
the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Healthcare Systems. All data from surgical patients undergoing orthotopic liver 
transplantation from April 2014 to August 2017 were extracted. 
The resulting dataset remained de-identified and did not contain 
sensitive patient-health information as defined by the UCSD Human Research Protections Program, and therefore, was exempt 
from the informed consent requirement and approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB), IRB number 171557. During the 
study period there was no change in surgery or anesthesia leadership of the liver transplant program. 
Data and outcomes 
The outcomes studied were intraoperative massive transfusion 
≥ 10 units PRBC, prolonged mechanical ventilation > 24 h, and 
in-hospital mortality. Through literature review and expert discussion, we pre-determined factors potentially associated with 
these outcomes. Characteristics collected for analysis included patient age, sex, body mass index, MELD score, etiology of liver failure (hepatitis C, hepatitis B, alcohol use, hepatocellular carcinoma 
[HCC], primary biliary cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
[NASH], cryptogenic, and ‘other’), comorbidities (hepatorenal 
syndrome, hepatopulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive 
heart failure, portopulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease, diabetes mellitus, coagulopathy, cardiac valve abnormality, pulmonary hypertension, and diastolic 
dysfunction), preoperative laboratory values, and need for preoperative transfusion of PRBC, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, 
and platelets. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed using R, a software environment for statistical computing (R Core Team [2013]. R: a language 
and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. Available from http:// www.
R-project.org/). A multivariable logistic regression using backwards elimination was performed for each of the three outcomes 
(transfusion ≥ 10 units PRBC, prolonged mechanical ventilation 
> 24 h, and in-hospital mortality) to identify associations. All 
variables were included in the initial model building process of 
the multivariate analysis. In a step-by-step fashion, we removed 
one variable at a time from the model that had the highest P value 
greater than 0.05. This was performed until all variables in the 
model had P < 0.05 in its association with the outcome. None of 
the variables that were not statistically significant in its association 
with the outcome were included in the final model. The odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% CI were then reported. Multicollinearity was assessed with variance inflation factor (VIF). We 
determined that if VIF < 5, correlation between predictor variables were not high. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, all predictors demonstrated a VIF < 5. When summarizing 
demographic data, categorical variables were summarized as 
count and percentages, while continuous variables were reported 
as mean and standard deviation (SD). 
Results 
The patient demographics of the 124 patients included in the 
study are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 55.3 years old (SD 
10.7 years). Of the patients, 59.7% were males. Etiologies of liver 
failure are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Common co-morbidities 
include diabetes type II, hepatorenal syndrome, congestive heart 
failure, end-stage renal disease, and coronary artery disease. All 
liver transplants during the study period were performed by a single primary surgeon. Postoperative outcomes are shown in Table 3: 
55.6% of patients required intraoperative massive transfusion ≥ 
10 units of PRBC, 53.2% of patients required prolonged ventilation > than 24 h, and 10.5% of patients died during the hospitalization. The mean number of days for postoperative ventilation 
was 7.8 days (SD 15.5 days). The mean number of days for ICU 
and hospital length of stay were 8.9 days (SD 13.8 days) and 25.7 
days (SD 23.4 days), respectively. 
The results of the final multivariable logistic regression model 
are listed in Table 4 with OR, 95% CI, and P value. Significant risk 
factors for massive transfusion were HCC and preoperative transfusion of PRBC. Increased preoperative hematocrit, increased prehttps://doi.org/10.4097/kja.19108 31

operative fibrinogen, and increased alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) were protective for preventing massive postoperative transfusion. Risk factors for postoperative ventilation greater than 24 h 
included hepatitis C, alcoholic hepatitis, elevated preoperative ALT, 
and hepatorenal syndrome. Male sex was protective for postoperative ventilation greater than 24 h. End-stage renal disease and hepatitis B were associated with increased in-hospital mortality.

method for survival of liver failure, it carries significant risks of 
morbidity and mortality. The main findings of our study are: the 
presence of HCC and preoperative transfusion correlated with intraoperative massive transfusion of ≥ 10 units of PRBC. Hepatitis 
C, alcoholic hepatitis, and hepatorenal syndrome correlated with 
an increased risk of postoperative mechanical ventilation greater 
than 24 h. Male sex correlated with a reduced risk of prolonged 
mechanical ventilation greater than 24 h. Hepatitis B and endstage renal disease correlated with an increase in in-hospital mortality.

ciated with higher mortality, prolonged length of stay, and increased rate of infectious complications [11]. Improvement in intraoperative management has significantly decreased transfusion 
needs and improved overall mortality and morbidity [12]. Current research has primarily concentrated on intraoperative management. In contrast, we have concentrated on preoperative factors influencing morbidity and mortality of liver transplant recipients. Our statistical analysis demonstrates that patients with HCC 
and preoperative transfusion have an increased risk for massive 
transfusion. 
The increased risk of bleeding in HCC patients is likely due to 
the rich blood supply of the tumor. The high pressure of arterial 
vascularization of the tumor is associated with increased rate of 
hemorrhage and difficulty obtaining hemostasis [13]. While this 
is not a modifiable risk factor, the presence of HCC should alert 
the transplant team for potential higher transfusion needs. 
A recent study by Massicotte et al. [14] revealed that preoperative anemia was associated with a higher risk of transfusion during 
liver transplant and suggests that optimizing hemoglobin before 
surgery could be potentially valuable. This is consistent with our 
finding preoperative anemia and preoperative transfusion to be 
significantly correlated with high transfusion requirement. This 
could be that transfusion increases central venous pressure, which 
has been found to be associated with increased bleeding [14]. 
We report herein that hepatitis, C alcoholic hepatitis, and hepatorenal syndrome are correlated with mechanical ventilation 
greater than 24 h. Male sex was found to have reduced the risk of 
mechanical ventilation greater than 24 h. In a previous analysis of 
a nationwide database prolonged mechanical ventilation has been 
associated with increased mortality and graft failure [7]. In this 
study female gender was also associated with increased need for 
prolonged mechanical venation and the authors attributed this to 
the fact that female liver transplant patients seem to be older, 
more frail, and potentially have more advanced liver failure [7]. 
Numerous studies have examined the association of post-transplant mortality with postoperative decline in kidney function 
[15–17] and preoperative hepatorenal syndrome [18]. However, 
these studies did not note the association of hepatorenal syndrome and prolonged ventilation, which we found to be statistically significant. The etiology of this association deserves closer 
investigation, but one hypothesis may be that the relative hypervolemia and increased capillary permeability of patients with 
hepatorenal syndrome may lead to increased work of breathing 
and poor gas exchange post-operatively. This may suggest that increased attention to fluid status intraoperatively may be beneficial. 
Prior study of the association of hepatitis C and alcoholic cirrhosis with prolonged ventilation was not found in any of the literature reviewed for this study. Despite the unclear etiology of this 
association, the presence of hepatitis C or alcoholic cirrhosis may 
assist with risk stratification and patient planning. 
Finally, our data analysis found hepatitis B and end-stage renal 
disease to have significant association with post-transplant 
in-hospital mortality. Impaired kidney function and post-transplant mortality has been frequently reported, though most studies 
found a postoperative decline in kidney function to have a higher 
association with long-term mortality than measurements of preTable 4. Multivariable Logistic Regression Modeling Various Outcomes

operative function [15–18]. Our finding of an association between 
end-stage renal disease and in-hospital mortality is not unexpected, given the common postoperative complications seen in patients with end-stage renal disease. A large study of dialysis patients undergoing general surgery utilizing the American College 
of Surgeons NSQIP database found significantly increased rates of 
death, thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections [19]. 
Prior studies of liver transplant outcomes have not found increased mortality rates in patients with hepatitis B as compared to 
hepatitis C, alcoholic cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis, and malignancy [20]. The etiology of our finding of significant association 
between hepatitis B and in-hospital mortality is unclear. One hypothesis may be that fulminant hepatic failure represents an increased proportion of the hepatitis B patients. 
Our results have to be seen within the context of its limitations. 
This is a retrospective single center study. Though all results may 
not be generalizable, the study period was chosen due to the stable 
surgical, anesthesiology, and medicine transplant teams, which allowed us to focus on the variables in question without having to 
account for significant differences in patient care. The study population size of 124 is relatively small, which may have left the 
study underpowered to identify perioperative associations of 
smaller effect. 
In summary we hope that this study prompts further attempts 
to improve methodologies for predicting perioperative complications in orthotopic liver transplant patients. Though some conclusions were consistent with the known pathophysiology of comorbidities, such as an association between end stage renal disease 
and in-hospital mortality, other etiologies remain elusive, such as 
an association between hepatitis C and prolonged mechanical 
ventilation. These associations prompt many questions deserving 
of closer investigation. Further investigations should include a 
more in-depth analysis, including removal of confounding variables, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and further analysis of 
postoperative events leading to mortality and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Our goal in this and in future studies is to define 
and refine specific predictive values, allowing practitioners to 
have a preliminary system of predicting which patients may have 
an increased risk of massive transfusion, prolonged mechanical 
ventilation, and in-hospital mortality.
