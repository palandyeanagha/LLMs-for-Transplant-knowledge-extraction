Abstract
Background: Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a rare complication of liver diseases of
different etiologies and may indicate a poor prognosis. Therefore, a simple non-invasive screening
method to detect HPS would be highly desirable. In this study pulse oximetry was evaluated to
identify patients with HPS.
Methods: In 316 consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis (n = 245), chronic hepatitis (n = 69) or
non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (n = 2) arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was determined using
a pulse oximeter. In patients with SaO2 ≤92% in supine position and/or a decrease of ≥4% after
change from supine to upright position further diagnostic procedures were performed, including
contrast-enhanced echocardiography and perfusion lung scan.
Results: Seventeen patients (5.4%) had a pathological SaO2. Four patients (1.3%) had HPS. HPS
patients had a significant lower mean SaO2 in supine (89.7%, SD 5.4 vs. 96.0%, SD 2.3; p = 0.003)
and upright position (84.3%, SD 5.0 vs. 96.0%, SD 2.4; p = 0.001) and had a lower mean PaO2 (56.2
mm Hg, SD 15.2 vs. 71.2 mm Hg, SD 20.2; p = 0.02) as compared to patients without HPS. The
mean ∆SaO2 (difference between supine and upright position) was 5.50 (SD 7) in HPS patients
compared to non-HPS patients who showed no change (p = 0.001). There was a strong correlation
between shunt volume and the SaO2 values (R = -0.94).
Conclusion: Arterial SaO2 determination in supine and upright position is a useful non-invasive
screening test for HPS and correlates well with the intrapulmonary shunt volume.
Background
In 1884 Flückiger first described a women with liver cirrhosis, cyanosis, and digital clubbing [1]. The term 'hepatopulmonary syndrome', the triad of liver disease, anincreased alveolar-arterial gradient while breathing room
air, and evidence of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations,

was coined in 1977 by Kennedy and Knudson [2]. These
vascular abnormalities predominate in the lower lung
fields. As gravity induces increased blood flow to the
lower lung fields hypoxemia is increased when changing
from supine to upright position. Mild hypoxemia occurs
in approximately one third of all patients with chronic
liver disease and often is multifactorial [3,4], because
other cardiopulmonary abnormalities (e.g., pleural effusions, ascites) are common in these patients and may
coexist with HPS. The special qualities of HPS are platypnea [5], defined as dyspnoe induced by the upright position and relieved by recumbency and orthodeoxia [6],
defined as arterial deoxygenation induced by the upright
position and relieved by recumbency. Although these
phenomena are not pathognomonic for HPS, they
strongly suggest this diagnosis in the setting of liver dysfunction [7].
The aim of our open prospective study was to evaluate
arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) as a non-invasive screening test for HPS in patients with chronic liver disease or
non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Furthermore, clinical
manifestations of HPS were analyzed. Further we wanted
to find out, whether it was possible to estimate the shunt
volume by this non-invasive procedure.
Methods
316 in- and outpatients with liver cirrhosis (n = 245),
chronic hepatitis (n = 69) or non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (n = 2) were enrolled in a prospective study.
The clinical characteristics of the patients participating in
the study are summarized in Table 1. The majority of
patients were male (194/316). The mean age was 54.5
years (SD 12.9). The etiology of chronic liver disease was
alcohol use in 51%, chronic hepatitis B in 15% and
chronic hepatitis C in 22%. Rare aetiologies were hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, primary biliary cirrhosis
(PBC) or autoimmune hepatitis. Two patients had noncirrhotic portal hypertension due to nodular regenerative
hyperplasia (NRH) and portal vein thrombosis of
unknown origin, respectively.
The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on clinical, biochemical and ultrasound criteria. In 69/245 patients liver
cirrhosis was confirmed histologically. 71 patients had
chronic hepatitis or non-cirrhotic portal hypertension
without evidence for cirrhosis. The patients with liver cirrhosis were classified according to the Child-Pugh classification [8] as follows: A: 36.3%, B: 42.5% and C: 21.2%.
Measurement of SaO2 was performed with a portable
pulse oximeter (Onyx, Nonin, USA or Sirecrust 610, Siemens, Germany). In all patients, the measurements were
performed at ambient O2 partial pressure in supine position. A second reading was taken after 10 minutes in
upright position. A pathological test result was defined as:
(i) SaO2 ≤92% in supine position, (ii) a decrease in SaO2
of ≥4% after change from supine to the upright position
(∆SaO2) [9]. In patients with a pathological test the following additional studies were performed: chest x-ray,
pulmonary function tests, transthoracic contrastenhanced echocardiography (CEE) and perfusion lung
scanning.
For CEE, 10 ml of 5.5% oxypolygelatine (Gelifundol®,
Biotest Pharma, Dreieich, Germany) were injected intravenously. This technique is based on the formation of
microbubbles that are normally retained by the pulmonary capillaries and therefore do not appear in the left
heart [10]. In the presence of intrapulmonary or intracardiac right-to-left-shunts, however, microbubbles will
opacify the left heart. Depending on the time elapsing
between contrast medium injection and the appearance of
microbubbles in the left heart intracardiac and intrapulmonary shunts can be discriminated. In case of intracardiac right-to-left shunts, microbubbles appear within
three heart beats after the appearance in the right chambers. In patients with intrapulmonary shunts contrast
medium appears in the left heart after four to six heart
beats [11]. To date, there is no satisfactory shunt calculation with the CEE technique [12,13].
Perfusion lung scanning was performed with technetium
99 m (99 mTc)-labeled macroaggregated albumin to
directly demonstrate intrapulmonary vascular shunts
[14]. Albumin macroaggregates are larger than 20 µm in
diameter and are normally trapped in the pulmonary capTable 1: Characteristics of the 316 Study Patients

illaries (diameter 8 to 15 µm). Uptake of radionuclide by
kidney, brain etc., therefore, indicates pathological passage through intrapulmonary or intracardiac shunts. The
extrapulmonary shunt fraction, assuming that 13% of the
cardiac output is delivered to the brain, was calculated
using the geometric mean of technetium counts in the
brain and lung as described by Abrams and others
[12,15]. The shunt fraction was considered positive if the
value was >6%.
The diagnosis of HPS was established when the following
criteria were fulfilled: arterial deoxygenation (measured
by a SaO2 ≤92 or a ∆SaO2of ≥4%), positive CEE and positive perfusion lung scanning using according to the definition of the European Task Force [16].
Statistical analysis
In our study, quantitative variables are presented as means
and standard deviations (SD), qualitative variables as
absolute and relative frequencies. Clinical characteristics
of HPS patients were compared to those of patients without HPS by a Wilcoxon rank test for quantitative and
Fisher's exact test for dichotomous variables. In HPS
patients the relationship between CEE and shunt volume
was determined by linear regression analysis and estimation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. All tests were
two-sided with a p-value of <0.05. Data analysis was performed with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The study protocol was approved by
the ethics committee of the Albert-Ludwigs-University of
Freiburg. Written informed consent was obtained from all
the participants.
Results
Among the 316 patients seventeen patients (5.4%) had a
pathological SaO2 according to the criteria described
above. These patients underwent CEE analyses (n = 17),
perfusion lung scanning (n = 13) and pulmonary function
tests (n = 17). On the basis of these analyses 4 patients
with HPS were identified. In the 13 non-HPS patients 11
patients had a SaO2 < 92 but no remarkable change in
upright position and two had a SaO2 > 92 combined with
a drop of >= 4 in upright position. CEE demonstrated in
all four HPS patients the appearance of microbubbles in
the left heart 4–6 heart cycles after the appearance in the
right heart. In one additional patient microbubbles
appeared within three heart beats due to an atrial septum
defect. CEE was well tolerated by all patients.
The mean SaO2 levels in patients with HPS as compared to
patients without HPS were significantly lower in supine
(89.7%, SD 5.4 vs. 96.0%, SD 2.3, p = 0.0034) and upright
position (84.3%, SD 5.0 vs. 96.0%, SD 2.4, p = 0.0006,
Table 2). Most importantly, not all HPS patients had a
pathological SaO2 in the supine position but all showed a
significant SaO2 decrease after changing from supine to
upright position (Fig. 1). The mean ∆SaO2 in the HPS
patients was 5.50 (SD 7) compared to non-HPS patients,
who showed no change (p = 0.001). In the 13 patients
without HPS the pathologically reduced SaO2 was caused
by chronic obstructive lung disease (n = 9), large volume
ascites, atrial septum defect, the fall of SaO2 with normal
initial value was seen in a patient with large volume
ascites and a patient with portopulmonary hypertension,
respectively.
In 13/17 patients with a pathological SaO2, including the
4 HPS patients, a perfusion lung scanning was performed.
In all HPS patients extrapulmonary radionuclide uptake
was detected. The shunt volume was estimated to be
between 7% and 34% (mean 20%) of the cardiac output.

The patients without HPS showed no extrapulmonary
radionuclide uptake. The shunt volume in the 4 HPS
patients correlated very well with the SaO2 values (r = -
0.94, Fig. 2) and with the pO2 values (r = -0.69, Fig. 3).
HPS patients showed pronounced hypoxemia (mean
PaO2 = 56.2 mm Hg, SD 15.2) in capillary blood gas analyses under ambient O2 partial pressure compared to the
patients without HPS but a SaO2 below 92% (mean PaO2
= 78.1 mm Hg, SD 10.7).
In all 17 patients with pathological SaO2, pulmonary
function tests were performed. CO diffusion capacity
(HPS: mean 42%, SD 4.1 vs. non-HPS: mean 75.3%, SD
17.7; p = 0.038) and residual volume (2.0 l, SD 0.75 vs.
3.3 l, SD 1.2; p = 0.036) were significantly reduced in HPS
patients. Vital capacity, pCO2, base excess, HCO3 and pH
were not significantly different in patients with and without HPS, although there was a trend for FEV1 being lower
in non-HPS patients.
In HPS patients there was a trend towards higher mean
respiration and pulse rate as well as a lower mean systolic
and diastolic blood pressure. Cyanosis, dyspnea and digital clubbing were more frequent in HPS patients. The frequency of skin manifestations of chronic liver disease,
e.g., spider naevi, palmar erythema, and ascites or hepatic
encephalopathy were not different between patients with
and without HPS.
Hematologic analyses showed a trend towards higher
hemoglobin (14.1 g/dl, SD 2.2 vs. 12.5 g/dl, SD 2.2) and
hematocrit values (42.5%, SD 6.6 vs. 37.5%, SD 12.1) in
patients with HPS compared to patients without HPS.
Clinical chemistry (bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin
time) and Child-Pugh-Score were not different between
patients with and without HPS. Chest radiographs
showed no abnormalities, such as increased interstitial
markings [17], in either group of patients.
Discussion
Hypoxemia is common in patients with chronic liver disease [17,18]. A rare cause is HPS that may cause dyspnea,
platypnea, and orthodeoxia and poor prognosis [19].
Because other abnormalities, (e.g., hydrothorax, ascites)
may coexist in HPS patients and contribute to respiratory
insufficiency, measurement of a lowered paO2 or SaO2
alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of HPS. The
diagnostic criteria of HPS include liver disease, hypoxemia with a paO2<70 mmHg and evidence for intrapulmonary vascular dilation. This study was conducted to
evaluate pulse oximetry as a non-invasive screening for
HPS in patients with chronic liver disease. Therefore, arterial blood gas analyses were only obtained from patients
with a SaO2 below the threshold value of 92% or a
decrease in SaO2 of ≥4% after change from supine to the
upright position (∆SaO2). In liver transplant candidates a
threshold level of SaO2 of 94% detected all subjects with
an arterial pO2 <60 mm Hg [20]. A patient with a SaO2
>92% and no significant decrease in this value in the
upright position is unlikely to have a paO2 <70 mm Hg
and pulmonary shunts without these being detected by
our screening. There may be a small subgroup of patients
with positive contrast echocardiograms and essentially
normal or slightly changed oxygenation due to form
fruste or subclinical HPS. We cannot determine how
many patients we missed to detect due to a lack of a position change in SaO2. The incidence and clinical significance of these forms of HPS is not clear. However, patients
with clinically apparent HPS have a significant mortality
and have to be identified, because HPS is an indication
and not a contraindication for liver transplantation [21-
23]. Our intention was not to determine the true prevalence of HPS including minor forms but to detect clinically relevant cases by a simple screening algorithm.
In our study of 316 patients almost 80% had liver cirrhosis; the remaining patients had chronic hepatitis or noncirrhotic portal hypertension. The majority of patients had
compensated liver function. Only 17 patients (5.4%) had
a pathological SaO2 or a decrease in SaO2 of ≥4%. This is
a relatively small percentage compared to other study
populations, such as liver transplant candidates [12]. Four
patients (1.3%) in our prospective study met the diagnosCorrelation of Shunt Volume and SaO Figure 2 2

tic criteria for HPS. 11 patients without HPS had a SaO2
≤92 and two a ∆SaO2 of ≥4%.
Data regarding the incidence of HPS are limited and estimations of prevalence vary as different definitions for HPS
are used. Based on the prospective design of our study, the
1.3% prevalence of significant HPS appears realistic in
patients with chronic liver disease.
HPS patients in our study were younger than patients
without HPS. Similarly, Rydell and Hoffbauer in 1956
described a 17-year old patient with liver cirrhosis and
dilated pulmonary vessels and arteriovenous fistulas,
found at autopsy [24]. At the same time, Hales described
some very young patients with similar pulmonary findings and liver disease [25]. Even in childhood HPS may
occur [26].
Two of our 4 HPS patients had liver cirrhosis due to
chronic viral hepatitis. One of these patients also had a
hepatocellular carcinoma. The two other HPS patients
had portal hypertension due to NRH and portal vein
thrombosis of unknown origin, respectively. Both acute
[27] and chronic [28,29] liver diseases have been associated with HPS. Most commonly, HPS appears in patients
with chronic liver diseases progressing to liver cirrhosis,
especially in cryptogenic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis,
PBC and chronic viral hepatitis B or C. However, the
occurrence of HPS in patients with noncirrhotic portal
hypertension [28,30], as in 2 of our HPS patients, suggests
that cirrhosis is not a prerequisite for the development of
HPS.
In our patients there was no correlation between the
occurrence of HPS and liver function tests (bilirubin,
albumin and prothrombin time), similar to previous findings [28,31]. Different from other studies [32,33] we
found no association between spider naevi or other skin
manifestations of liver disease and HPS. The most impressive physical findings in HPS patients were cyanosis, dyspnea and digital clubbing, which were more frequent in
HPS patients than in non-HPS patients. The pathogenesis
of digital clubbing is not completely understood. One
hypothesis is based on the fact that megakaryocytes and
platelet aggregates are normally retained by the lung capillaries. In patients with a right-to-left-shunts megakaryocytes reach the digital capillaries [34,35], there releasing
platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF is known to
cause increased capillary permeability and proliferation of
fibroblasts that may result in clubbing [36].
Since hypoxemia and orthodeoxia are not pathognomic
for HPS, CEE is necessary to discriminate between
intrapulmonary or intracardiac right-to-left shunts. All
patients with pathological SaO2 or elevated ćSaO2 underwent CEE in our study. In 5 patients microbubbles
appeared in the left heart. In one patient this was caused
by an atrial septum defect. In the remaining four patients
HPS was diagnosed, because microbubbles appeared
already after 4–6 heart beats in the left heart.
99mTc-labeled macroaggregated albumin scanning is
another technique to detect and to quantify intrapulmonary vascular shunts [12,15]. In all 4 HPS patients
extrapulmonary radionuclide uptake confirmed the existence of intrapulmonary shunts. The estimated shunt volume was between 7% and 34% (mean 20%) of the cardiac
output and correlated well with the SaO2 (r = -0.94) and
the arterial pO2 (r = -0.69). Abrams and coworkers
described a similar correlation between arterial pO2 and
shunt volume (r = -0.73) however, SaO2 was not determined [15].
Patients with end-stage liver disease may have various pulmonary abnormalities, including restrictive and obstructive lung disease. HPS patients tend to have a decreased
CO diffusion capacity with normal pulmonary capacity
and expiratory flow rates [17,37]. These findings were
confirmed in our study.
Conclusion
Combined SaO2 determination in supine and upright
position using a pulse oximeter is a simple test to identify
HPS in patients with chronic liver disease or noncirrhotic
portal hypertension. In our prospective clinical study only
in 4 out of 316 patients (1.3%) with chronic liver disease
had HPS. Shunt volumes can be quantified by lung perfusion scanning and correlate better with the values of

SaO2 than pO2. This correlation may allow an estimation
of the severity of the shunt volume without performing
lung perfusion scanning. In clinical practice determination of arterial oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter
can be used as a simple screening test and may help to
identify more HPS patients with the aim to study the
pathogenesis and to develop therapeutic strategies.
