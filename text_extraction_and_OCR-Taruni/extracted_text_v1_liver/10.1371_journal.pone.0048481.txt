Abstract
Background: Renal transplant patients often have severe bone and mineral deficiencies. While the clinical effects of
immunosuppressive agents like calcineurin inhibitors (CIs) and sirolimus on bone turnover are unclear, bisphosphonates are
effective in bone recovery in these patients. Gender is significantly associated with osteoporosis and affects bone turnover,
which is different in women and men. The effective gender-related site of action of bisphosphonates is unknown.
Methods: Initially, we enrolled 84 kidney recipients who had received their transplants at least 5 months ago; of these, 8
were excluded and 76 were finally included in the study. First bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, hip, and
femoral neck was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) between September 2008 and March 2009.
These 76 patients underwent a repeat procedure after a mean period 14 months. Immunosuppressive agents,
bisphosphonates, patients’ characteristics, and biochemical factors were analyzed on the basis of the BMD determined
using DXA.
Results: After the 14-month period, the BMD of lumbar spine increased significantly (from 0.9 g/cm2 to 0.92 g/cm2,
p,0.001), whereas that of the hip and femoral neck did not. Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to show that
Fosamax improved bone condition, as defined by WHO (p = 0.007). The use of immunosuppressive agents did not affect
bone turnover (p.0.05). Moreover, in subgroup analysis, Fosamax increased the BMD at the lumbar spine and the hipbone
in males (p = 0.028 and 0.03, respectively) but only at the lumbar spine in females (p = 0.022).
Conclusion: After a long periods after renal transplantation, the detrimental effects of steroid and immunosuppressive
agents on bone condition diminished. Short-term Fosamax administration effectively improves BMD in these patients. The
efficacy of Fosamax differed between male and female renal transplant patients.

Introduction
Patients maintained on dialysis for end-stage renal disease
exhibit severe mineral and bone deficiencies. While renal
transplantation restores defective kidney function in patients with
chronic renal disease, the associated steroid and other immunosuppressive therapies continuously damage the bones [1,2]; the
expected correction of established bone lesions does not occur.
Although transplantation can resolve many biochemical imbalances, such as hyperparathyroidism, associated with chronic renal
failure, progressive loss of BMD in the trabecular bone often
occurs early after renal transplantation [3]. Investigators have not
agreed on the risk factors that are most strongly associated with
reduced BMD [4,5] after renal transplantation, except on an
accumulated dose of steroid. At present, the use of biochemical
markers of bone turnover in the serum or urine is not
recommended for diagnosis [6]. The World Health Organization
(WHO) defines osteoporosis as a condition in which the difference
between the mean BMDs for the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck
(FN), or hip (H) of the patients and healthy young adults is more
than 2.5 standard deviations (SDs), as measured by dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA). Further, osteopenia is defined as a
condition in which the difference between the mean BMDs of the
patients and healthy young adults is between 1 and 2.5 SDs [6].
Several studies have shown the beneficial effects of bisphosphonates on post-transplantation osteoporosis [7–9]. Other studies
have shown that calcineurin inhibitors (CIs) have deleterious
effects on bone mineral metabolism in rats [10–12], and that at
least one cyclosporine has a protective effect on bone [13]. Other
immune-modifying drugs, such as azathioprine, mycophenolate
mofetil, and sirolimus, which are used in conjunction with
glucocorticoids and CIs, have not been shown to promote bone
loss, neither experimentally nor clinically [14,15]. Osteoporosis
caused by portosystemic shunting [16], or by steroid or CIs
through receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand

(RANKL)-dependent pathways, may be partially ameliorated
using sirolimus [17]. Moreover, the physiology of bone turnover
differs according to gender, particularly in menopausal women
[18–21], and the efficacy of alendronate in the treatment of
postmenopausal osteoporosis has been well established [22]. To
our knowledge, the gender-related efficacy of alendronate in renal
transplant subjects has rarely been reported. The aim of this
randomized case-control study was to assess the impact of
immunosuppressive agents and alendronate on BMD, as estimated
by DXA, and to determine whether the response to alendronate in
renal transplant subjects is gender-dependent.
Materials and Methods
This case-control study complied with the guidelines of the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a tertiary referral
center located in the northern part of Taiwan. Since this study
involved retrospective review of existing data, the Institutional
Review Board approval was obtained, but without specific
informed consent from patients. In addition, all individual
information was securely protected (by delinking identifying
information from main data set) and available to investigators
only. Furthermore, all the data were analyzed anonymously. On
the other hand, if this study involved retrospective review of
existing data plus retrospective analysis of remaining biological
samples, both Institutional Review Board approval and specific
informed consent must be obtained from all patients. The
Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
has specifically waived the need for consent. Finally, all primary
data were collected according to strengthening the reporting of
observational studies in epidemiology guidelines. The form
described above was referenced from the Liu et al.’s publication
[23].
Study population
We randomly enrolled 84 kidney recipients (40 men and 44
women) who had undergone transplantation at least 5 months ago.
We used DXA to obtain BMD measurements of the lumbar spine
(LS), left hip (H), and femoral neck (FN) between September 2008
and March 2009 [24]. Bone condition was defined on the basis of
the WHO criteria: a BMD value .2.5 standard deviations (SD, T
score) below the young adult mean indicated osteoporosis and that
between 1.0 and 2.5 SDs below the mean indicated osteopenia.
The immunosuppressive agents that the patients had received
included prednisolone (5 mg/tablet), cyclosporine (25 mg/tablet
and 100 mg/tablet), tacrolimus (0.5 mg/tablet and 1 mg/tablet),
sirolimus (1 mg/tablet), and mycophenolate (250 mg/tablet).
Fosamax (alendronate sodium; 70 mg/tablet, 70 mg per week)
was administered to the patients who were initially diagnosed with
osteoporosis. Fasting blood levels of serum creatinine (Cr), blood
urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, inorganic phosphate, and uric acid
were obtained. The patients’ medical records were studied for the
history of diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking frequency, alcohol
intake, and hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. All the doses of immunosuppressive
agents administered between the 2 BMD measurements were
considered as the accumulated dose. After 1461.6 months of
follow-up, the 76 remaining patients (8 of the 84 patients were
excluded—2 subjects had died, 2 had graft failure, and the initial
BMD measurements of 4 patients was lost) received a second
measurement of BMD and fasting blood tests.
Precautions and contraindications for the use of Fosamax
The first DXA report was obtained between September 2008
and March 2009. Fosamax (70 mg per week) was administered to
the patients diagnosed with osteoporosis based on this DXA report
unless 1 or more of the following conditions was present:
bisphosphonate allergy; blood calcium levels ,8 mg/dL; active
stomach problems (e.g., esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcers); renal
insufficiency (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]
,30 mL/[min?1.73 m2
] or serum Cr level .3 mg/dL); difficulty
swallowing or the inability to stand/sit upright for at least 30 min,
and pregnancy and breastfeeding. The patients did not receive
Fosamax prior to obtainment of the first DXA data. Furthermore,
the patients were informed that they should take the drug only
upon rising for the day with 3 to 4 swallows of water and that they
should stand, walk, or sit and fast for 30–45 min afterwards, and
then eat breakfast. Lying down or reclining after taking the drug is
prohibited. At least 30 min should pass after the intake of
alendronate before taking supplements or other drugs.
Immunosuppressive protocol
In our hospital, we mainly use a CI-based immunosuppressive
regimen in the initial months of transplantation. Most of our
patients also receive mycophenolic acid plus prednisolone during
this stage. Immediately after transplantation, the targeted cyclosporine concentration at 2 h post-dose (C2) is approximately
1300–1100 ng/mL and the tacrolimus trough level is maintained
at approximately 12–10 ng/mL. These concentrations are tapered
gradually in the first year. In patients that have been transplanted
for more than 12 months, the cyclosporine C2 level is maintained
at approximately 500–600 ng/mL and tacrolimus level at 3–4 ng/
mL. Prednisolone is maintained at 1.25–10 mg per day, according
to patient’s condition. An mTOR inhibitor is added to the
regimen if the patient’s condition is suitable (proteinuria
,800 mg/day and eGFR .40 mL/[min?1.73 m2
]). The trough
level of the mTOR inhibitor is maintained at approximately 3–
8 ng/mL. Once the mTOR inhibitor has been added, the CI and
mycophenolic acid dose are cut by 50% overnight, while
prednisolone is maintained at the same dosage. Subsequently,
the CI dose is tapered as much as possible. Most of the patients in
this study received only 25 mg cyclosporine or 0.5 mg tacrolimus
per day if an mTOR inhibitor was used.
Statistical analysis
The data, given as median and interquartile ranges in nonnormal distribution variables, are expressed as mean 6 SD in
normal distribution variables. The paired t test and the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test were used to compare data of the patients at
presentation and follow-up. The Kruskal–Wallis test and one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to compare data of
the different bone conditions defined by the WHO criteria.
Comparisons among groups were performed using the Mann–
Whitney test and Student’s t test. We used multivariate ordinal
logistic regression to test the expected value between clinical
variables and the change of bone condition (grade 1: change to
better, grade 2: no change, and grade 3: deterioration; change to
better: from osteoporosis to osteopenia or normal, or from
osteopenia to normal; no change: no change in bone condition
at start and follow-up; deterioration: from normal to osteopenia or
osteoporosis, or from osteopenia to osteoporosis), as defined by
WHO. The Chi-square test was used to determine the correlation
between the 2 binary variables; a p value ,0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 12.0
for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results
Characteristics of the study population
After a follow-up period of 1461.6 months, 76 subjects received
a second BMD measurement. Among these patients, 12 had a
medical history of DM; 10 were infected with HBV, 15 with HCV,
and 13 with CMV; 10 men were habitual tobacco users, and 8
men and 1 woman regularly consumed alcohol. Thirty-four
patients received Fosamax, 57, prednisolone; 55, mycohenolate;
30, tacrolimus; 26, cyclosporine; and 34, sirolimus. Eight patients
(11%) received a single immunosuppressive agent, 21 patients
(28%) received 2 immunosuppressive agents, 36 (47%) received 3,
and 11 (14%) received 4.
Bone mineral density (BMD) at baseline and at follow-up
Table 1 shows the changes in BMD and blood biochemistry
after 1461.6 months of follow-up. In the 76 patients, calcium level
decreased from 9.4560.51 mg/dL to 9.2960.52 mg/dL
(p,0.001) and albumin from 4.4260.29 g/L to 4.3460.4 g/L
(p = 0.009), both levels were still within the normal range.
However, BMD of the lumbar spine increased from 0.9 to
0.92 g/cm2
, (p,0.001). No correlation between the use of
Fosamax and that of the immunosuppressive agents could be
demonstrated, as determined by the Chi-square test (p.0.05). No
patient who received Fosamax exhibited a deterioration in the
condition of his bone structure, as defined by WHO criteria.
Thirty patients showed no change in their bone condition, but 4
showed improvement. In patients who had not received Fosamax,
6 (14%) showed deterioration and 1 (2%) showed improvement.
BMD in patients with osteoporosis and without
In 41 patients with and 35 without osteoporosis at baseline, the
lumbar spine bone density increased (from 0.83 to 0.86 g/cm2
[p,0.001] and from 0.99 to 1.0 g/cm2 [p = 0.02]; respectively)
after the mean 14-month follow-up period, but hip and femoral
neck densities did not (Table 2). In order to detect any difference
in BMD due to the use of immunosuppressive agents in different
conditions of the bone, the patients were divided into 3 groups:
normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis, on the basis of the initial
DXA findings. The osteoporosis group received a greater
cumulative steroid dose than the osteopenia group (1326.5 mg
vs. 724.5 mg; p = 0.005; Figure 1A), and the increase in the
lumbar spine BMD was greater in the osteoporosis group
(0.033 g/cm2 vs. 0.009 g/cm2
; p = 0.028; Figure 1B). Otherwise,
the cumulative dose of immunosuppressive agents among the 3
groups did not differ significantly (p.0.05; Figure 1A). Interestingly, of our 41 osteoporosis patients, 7 did not receive Fosamax
due to their intolerance of the side effects. Among those 41
patients, those administered Fosamax showed a greater increase in
BMD (0.035 g/cm2 vs. 0.003 g/cm2
) but not significant (p.0.05).
Factors associated with bone turnover
To deepen our investigation of the influence of clinical features
on bone condition, we used a univariate binary logistic regression
to evaluate the association between bone condition (osteoporotic
and not osteoporotic at follow-up) and the clinical variables in 76
patients. The use of both prednisolone (odds ratio [OR], 5.18;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–16.4; p = 0.005) and Fosamax
(OR, 18.75; 95% CI, 5.42–64.76; p,0.001) showed an association
in patients with osteoporosis (Figure 2A). In an ordinal logistic
regression with multivariate analysis of the change in bone
condition (grade 1, improvement; grade 2, no change; and grade
3, deterioration; as defined by WHO criteria) and the clinical
variables, after adjusting for age, sex, status of diabetes, smoking,
alcohol consumption, time since transplantation, age at transplant,
and use of prednisolone, the use of Fosamax (OR, 23.115; 95%
CI, 25.364; 20.866; p = 0.007) was found to be associated with a
positive prognosis (Figure 2B).
Gender differences in the effect of Fosamax on bones
In our study, we found no gender-related differences in bone
turnover of renal transplant patients during the mean 14-month
follow-up period. Seeking a gender-related difference in the
physiology of bone turnover, we examined the bone response to
Fosamax in the 2 sexes. We found no differences in bone turnover
with respect to age, time since transplant, or the changes in blood
values for creatinine, albumin, or calcium, and neither was the
change in BMD or the cumulative immunosuppressive agents
different in the 2 sexes. However, when we compared BMD before
and after Fosamax treatment within the male and female groups,
we found Fosamax to be more effective in men than in women.
Among the patients who received Fosamax, BMD in the lumbar
spine and the hip (p = 0.028 and p = 0.03, respectively) increased
in 14 men; however, the increase in the BMD was observed only

in the lumbar spine (p = 0.022; Table 3) in 20 women. Among the
above-mentioned men and women who used Fosamax, the BMD
difference values were not different (p.0.05). Thus, we find that
the sites of action of Fosamax differ across the 2 sexes.
Discussion
In this study, we have shown that short-term weekly use of
Fosamax can improve both BMD and bone condition, in
accordance with the WHO criteria, regardless of effect of
immunosuppressive agents after a long period after renal
transplantation. In renal transplant subjects with osteoporosis,
Fosamax improved the BMD of the lumbar spine. Although the
bone condition after renal transplantation did not vary according
to gender, the bone regions in which Fosamax was effective did
vary.
An increase in bone mass loss is multifactorial and is affected by
age [21], sex [19–21], renal function, and duration of time for
which the patient was on dialysis before transplantation [20]. A
major influencing and well-known factor causing increased loss of
bone mass is high-dose steroid therapy during the early period
after transplantation and continuous long-term steroid administration [2]. CIs such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus also are
known to have serious effects and cause rapid and severe bone
losses in both animal models and humans. The role of Tlymphocyte action via RANKL seems to be of essence in triggering
bone loss [14]. Other immune-modifying drugs such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and sirolimus, which are used in
conjunction with glucocorticoids and CIs, have—neither experimentally nor clinically—been shown to promote bone loss. Recent
studies [17,25] suggest that sirolimus could promote an osteoclastic
balance between the effects of steroid and of calcineurine
inhibitors. Moreover, under sirolimus-based maintenance immunosuppression [26] after bone surgery, no radiologic advantage or
disadvantage to bone healing was noted. Therefore, in our clinical
estimation, a bias may exist between the biochemical markers and
DXA–WHO criteria in osteoporosis to evaluate bone condition.
Interestingly, the lumbar spine BMD in our 35 non-osteoporotic
patients increased slightly. As was true with the steroids, the
cumulative dose of immunosuppressive agents in the nonosteoporosis and osteoporosis groups did not differ. In the past
decade, the use of corticosteroids in the peritransplantation period
has been dramatically reduced and replaced by CIs and other
adjunctive agents. To our knowledge, the first 3 to 6 months after
transplantation is the critical period for the loss in bone mass
[4,27,28]. In a long-term study, the ongoing accelerated lumbar
bone mass loss was 1.762.8% per year [29], but in the 12 months
following cardiac transplantation, the LS BMD value was restored
to that at the time of transplant [30]. Twenty-four months after
transplantation, the yearly loss of absolute BMD was parallel to the
age-dependent physiological decline in absolute BMD [5]. In our
study, the time since transplant of non-osteoporotic subjects was
78660 months. From the studies cited above and from our
observations during the long post-transplantation period, we can
explain the slightly increased BMD of lumbar spine in our patients
who did not receive Fosamax. Otherwise, as the use of
immunosuppressive agents changes in the long period of renal
transplantation, the effective power of steroid on bone turnover
may be increasingly minor.
In this study, when we analyzed the subgroups of the subjects
with osteoporosis, we observed that Fosamax was not equally
effective in men and women in the different bone regions. Several
previous studies have shown that bisphosphonates continued to
improved bone mineral density after renal transplantation [7–
9,31,32] and most of them showed the effect on both lumbar spine
and femoral neck BMD. In a meta-analysis review of 1209 patients
[33], treatment with bisphosphonates increased BMD in lumbar
spine and femoral neck. No measurable change in the BMD of the
hip area was observed. In another population-based longitudinal
study [18], both the bone turnover and the sites of bone loss

WHO. The patients were divided, according to their baseline DXA, into normal (n = 5), osteopenia (n = 30), and osteoporosis (n = 41) groups. The
osteoporosis group received a significantly greater cumulative prednisolone dose than did the osteopenia group (1326.5 mg vs. 724.5 mg; p = 0.005;
Figure 1A), and the increase in lumbar spine bone mineral density was also significantly greater in the osteoporosis group (0.033 g/cm2 vs. 0.009 g/
cm2
; p = 0.028; Figure 1B). The drugs included in the analysis of cummulative immunosuppresive therapy were prednisolone, 5 mg; mycophenolate,
250 mg; tacrolimus, 0.5 mg; sirolimus, 1 mg; and cyclosporine, 100 mg. Abbreviations: L, lumbar spine; H, hipbone; F, femoral neck. *Statistical

differed according to gender. In a 2-year double-blind trial of men
with osteoporosis (mean age, 63 years), alendronate significantly
increased bone mass of spine and hipbone and helped prevent
vertebral fractures [34]. Iwamoto et al. [35] have suggested that
although alendronate treatment in men effectively increased
lumbar BMD from baseline, its efficacy appeared to be no greater
than that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Studies on
the comparative effects in a renal transplant population of
bisphosphonates according to gender and bone site are limited.
In our study on men and women who presented no significant
differences in the increase in their BMD with Fosamax, the 14
osteoporotic men showed improved BMD at the hip and lumbar
spine and the 20 osteoporotic females responded well only at the
lumbar spine.
Fosamax is absorbed and partitioned rapidly, with approximately 50% binding to the exposed bone surface and the
remainder being excreted unchanged by the kidneys [36].
Therefore, Fosamax should be used carefully in patients with
renal insufficiency or in anuric patients because of concerns
regarding drug accumulation. The major side effect of Fosamax is
ulceration of the esophagus, which may require hospitalization
and intensive treatment. Gastric and duodenal ulceration may also

Figure 2. Clinical variables associated with bone condition change. A binary (non-osteoporosis and osteoporosis in follow-up) logistic
regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with osteoporosis. The dependent variable was non-osteoporosis or
osteoporosis. The independent variables were age, sex, DM, smoking, alcohol consumption, age at transplantation, time since transplant, use of
immunosuppressive agents and use of Fosamax. Both the use of prednisolone (odds ratio [OR], 5.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–16.4; p = 0.005)
and the use of Fosamax (OR, 18.75; 95% CI, 5.42–64.76; p,0.001) were associated with the symptoms of osteoporosis (Figure 2A). In an ordinal
logistic regression with multivariate analysis of the change of bone condition (grade 1, changed to the better; grade 2, no change; and grade 3,
deterioration, as defined by WHO criteria and clinical variables), after adjusting for age, sex, status of diabetes (DM), smoking, alcohol consumption,
time since transplant, age at transplant, and use of prednisolone, the use of Fosamax (OR, 23.115; 95% CI, 25.364 to 20.866; p = 0.007) was found to
be associated with a positive prognosis (Figure 2B).

occur [37,38]. The co-administration of Fosamax and calcium,
antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations
interferes with the absorption of alendronate [38]. The shortterm use of a low dose of Fosamax (40 mg per week) was safe in
hemodialysis patients [39]. Alendronate treatment safely and
effectively increased BMD and decreased fractures in women with
normal to severely impaired renal function [40], and no
differences in adverse events were observed in these women
according to their renal function. The use of Fosamax for a mean
of 14 months did not deteriorate renal function in male and female
renal transplant patients (Table 3). To our knowledge, studies on
the interaction between Fosamax and immunosuppressant agents
are limited. The studies cited above and our own observations
suggest that the interaction between these agents is subtle.
Although the limitations of our study with regard to its
retrospective design and small sample size are evident, to our
knowledge, these are the first data reporting the differences
between men and women with regard to the sites at which
Fosamax is effective in renal transplant patients; these findings
refer to short-term treatment after a long post-renal transplantation period.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this randomized case-control study has shown
that short-term use of Fosamax increased BMD and that the effect
of concomitant steroid was not significantly correlated with bone
turnover. Moreover, Fosamax increased the BMD of the lumbar
spine and hip significantly in men, but only in the lumbar spine in
women. Immunosuppressive agents such as CIs, sirolimus, and
mycohenolate were not correlated with any change in BMD.
