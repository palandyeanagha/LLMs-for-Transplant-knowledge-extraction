Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are significant human pathogens and are
responsible for a substantial proportion of cases of severe acute hepatitis worldwide.
Genetically, both viruses are heterogeneous and are classified into several genotypes that
differ in their geographical distribution and risk group association. There is, however, little
evidence that variants of HAV or HEV differ antigenically or in their propensity to cause severe
disease. Genetically more divergent but primarily hepatotropic variants of both HAV and HEV
have been found in several mammalian species, those of HAV being classified into eight
species within the genus Hepatovirus in the virus family Picornaviridae. HEV is classified as
a member of the species Orthohepevirus A in the virus family Hepeviridae, a species
that additionally contains viruses infecting pigs, rabbits, and a variety of other mammalian
species. Other species (Orthohepevirus B–D) infect a wide range of other mammalian species
including rodents and bats.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus
(HEV) show moderate genetic diversity,
both being classified into several genotypes infecting humans, and several additional species
infecting a wide range of other mammalian
hosts. The genetic diversity of both viruses has
been extensively used as a tool to investigate
their molecular epidemiology and transmission.
Further studies have sought to determine the
existence of differences between genotypes in
their clinical presentations and pathogenicity
and will be reviewed.
CLASSIFICATION
HAV and HEV are positive-stranded RNA viruses that share a propensity to cause liver disease in humans. However, the two viruses are
quite distinct in terms of their replication strategy, virion structure, and taxonomy (see Kenney
and Meng 2018; McKnight and Lemon 2018).
HAV is classified as a member of the Hepatovirus genus in the large family Picornaviridae(Zell
et al. 2017). Although HAV is spread by the
fecal–oral route, it is not known whether HAV
replicates within tissues of the gastrointestinal
tract, and its disease manifestations arise from
the spread of virus infection to the liver.
HEV is classified as a member of the Orthohepevirus genus in the family Hepeviridae (Emerson and Purcell 2003; Purdy et al. 2015). Virions of hepeviruses are structurally distinct
from picornaviruses (see Kenney and Meng
2018) and their structural proteins are translated

from a separate subgenomic RNA expressed
during virus replication rather than as part of
a single polyprotein as in the picornaviruses.
Although there is detectable homology between
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase genes of picornaviruses and hepeviruses,
they have been assigned to different RNA virus
supergroups (I and III, respectively) (Koonin
1991), indicating an extremely distant evolutionary relationship between them.
DIVERSITY AND TAXONOMY OF HAV
AND RELATED VIRUSES
Hepatovirus Species
Until very recently, the genus Hepatovirus included a single species, HAV, whose members
comprise a group of viruses known to infect
humans and various nonhuman primate species. The species was renamed Hepatovirus A
in 2014 for consistency with nomenclature
conventions adopted elsewhere in the picornavirus family. Since 2015, however, a wide range
of further, genetically divergent hepatoviruses
have been described in seals (Anthony et al.
2015), shrews, and hedgehogs (order Eulipotyphla), several different rodent (Rodentia) and
bat (Chiroptera) host species (Drexler et al.
2015), and, most recently, woodchucks (Yu
et al. 2016; and see Sander et al. 2018). Collectively, these viruses are substantially more divergent from each other and from HAV than are
existing human and nonhuman primate HAV
strains, consistent with them being assigned to
several additional species. Using translated sequences from the structural gene region, VP2,
variants showing >7% divergence from all other
variants might be assigned to as many as 13
new species (Drexler et al. 2015). In 2017, the
ICTV accepted the proposal to create new species to classify those hepatovirus variants for
which (near-) complete genome sequences
were available and that clustered separately on
phylogenetic analysis. Accordingly, the genus
Hepatovirus now includes nine species (Hepatovirus A–I) based on phylogenetic groupings
(Fig. 1). Although distance thresholds have not
been specified in the current species definition,
nucleotide sequence divergence ranges from
3.8% among members of Hepatovirus A to
29% among members of Hepatovirus G (mean
intraspecies divergence of 16%), compared with
30%–42% among members of different species
(mean, 38%). The respective amino acid sequence divergence ranges are 0.8%–26%
(mean, 11.6%) compared with 31%–48%
(mean, 41%).
Members of these new hepatovirus species
share a number of genome characteristics with
HAV, such as low G+C content (37.0%–37.8%
within HAV genotypes) compared with 33.7%–
39.3% in members of the new species. They also
share the massive suppression of CpG dinucleotide frequencies (10%–34% of frequencies expected from their G+C content). Although there
is some variability in genome length and positions of cleavage sites for the different structural
and nonstructural proteins, members of all hepatovirus species generally show comparable genome organization and features. The latter includes their universal possession of internal
ribosomal entry sites (IRES) in the 50
-untranslated region (50
UTR), of which most resemble
the type III IRES of HAV in sequence and predicted structure (Anthony et al. 2015; Drexler
et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2016). However, viruses
belonging to Hepatovirus C and Hepatovirus E
(infecting a bat and rodent species, respectively)
possessed a type IV IRES (Drexler et al. 2015),
structurally resembling those of certain other
picornavirus genera (e.g., Tremovirus,Duck hepatitis virus, and Sapelovirus). Hepatovirus species are hepatotropic (Drexler et al. 2015), infect
a wide range of hosts, but show limited evidence
for host specificity. Although members of the
species Hepatovirus A are restricted to humans
and primates (macaques and African green
monkey), related hosts such as hedgehogs and
shrews (order Eulipotyphla) are infected with
members of other hepatovirus species (Hepatovirus H and Hepatovirus I), as are rodents and
bats. Conversely, members of a single species
(Hepatovirus H) can infect three quite different
hosts—hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), tupias
(Tupaia belangeri chinensis), and bats (Eidolon
helvum). Although the distribution of hepatovirus species is consistent with frequent jumps

Figure 1. Phylogeny and sequence divergence of hepatitis A viruses (HAVs). (A) Phylogenetic analysis of the
complete coding sequences of representative variants of HAV (species A) and of all available sequences of other
nonhuman hepatoviruses infecting other mammalian species, labeled as in the key. (The coding region spans
positions 723–7407 in the HAV-MBB sequences, M20273 [Paul et al. 1987].) The tree was constructed by
maximum likelihood using an optimal substitution model (general time reversible and γ distribution). Robustness
of branches was indicated by bootstrap resampling supported by ≥70 from 100 replicate samples. The tree was
rooted using sequences from the most closely similar genus of picornaviruses (Tremovirus: KT880668, AY275539,
KF979338,AJ225173, andAY517471). The host origins of the different species are indicated diagrammatically and
correspond to the following species: Hepatovirus B, seals (Phoca vitulina vitulina); Hepatovirus C, bats (Miniopterus cf. manavi);Hepatovirus D, rodents (Microtus arvalis,Myodes glareolus);Hepatovirus E, bats (Lophuromys
sikapusi); Hepatovirus F, rodents (Marmota himalayana, Sigmodon mascotensis); Hepatovirus G, bats (Rhinolophus landeri, Coleura afra); Hepatovirus H, hedgehogs, tupias, and bats (Erinaceus europaeus, Tupaia belangeri
chinensis,Eidolon helvum); andHepatovirus I, shrews (Sorex araneus). (B) Scan of amino acid sequence divergence
between HAV and hepatovirus species B–I, and comparison with between and among genotype divergence of

among hosts, it has recently been shown that
host range may be restricted by incompatibilities
in the interaction of the virus and the host innate
immune system (Hirai-Yuki et al. 2016). HAV is
unable to replicate in mice because it is unable to
evade the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor,
MAVS (see Hirai-Yuki et al. 2018), suggesting
that major jumps in host species may require
substantial adaptive changes in the virus. It is
very likely that a much wider range of HAVlike viruses will be found in other mammalian
species in the future and animal-associated hepatoviruses may conceivably represent zoonotic
sources of infections in humans.
HAV Diversity and Genotypes
Most information on diversity within hepatovirus species is available for Hepatovirus A. HAV
shows a modest degree of genetic diversity, with
an average of ∼10% nucleotide sequence divergence (2.2% amino acid sequence divergence)
among coding region sequences of available
(nearly) complete genome sequences. Somewhat higher estimates are obtained once epidemiologically linked HAV variants are excluded
(12% and 3.7%, respectively). Using sample
dates to estimate substitution rates of HAV
over time, it was concluded from Bayesian analysis of complete genome sequences that the
common ancestor of all variants belonging to
Hepatovirus A might have existed 2000–3000
years ago, while the subset of HAV variants infecting humans were somewhat less diverse and
may have a more recent common ancestor
(∼1500 years ago) (Kulkarni et al. 2009). Underpinning these historically relatively remote
dates was a substitution rate of 1.7–2.0 × 10−4
substitutions per site per year (SSY) for wholegenome sequences (Kulkarni et al. 2009) and
9.8 × 10−4 SSY for VP1 (Moratorio et al. 2007).
These rates are lower than estimates for VP1
genes of other picornaviruses, for example, 4–
14 × 10−3 SSY for foot and mouth disease virus
(genus Aphthovirus) (Cottam et al. 2006) and
13.5 × 10−3 for EV-A71 (genus Enterovirus)
(Brown et al. 1999) and indeed most other
RNA viruses. The reasons for such a low substitution rate in HAV are not known. Putting these
estimates into historical context, whether the
dating of the divergence of currently circulating
strains of HAV to some time after the collapse of
the Roman Empire and before the rise of Islam
has any epidemiological or historical correlates
remains undetermined.
Phylogenetic analysis of all available HAV
VP1 sequences on GenBank (June 14, 2017)
shows clustering of variants into the previously
assigned genotypes (gt)I–III infecting humans
and IV and V infecting nonhuman primates
(Fig. 2) (Robertson et al. 1992; Costa-Mattioli
et al. 2002). The original assignments were
based on a 168-nucleotide sequence at the
VP1/2A boundary, but the subsequent use of
whole VP1 sequences produces a more robust
phylogenetic tree and has led to the incorporation of what was originally described as gtVII
from Sierra Leone as a member of gtII (Lu et al.
2004). Variants of HAV infecting humans are all
assigned to gtI–III and are phylogenetically distinct from nonhuman primate HAV strains, assigned as gtIV, V, and VI (Fig. 2; no VP1 sequence is available for the macaque-derived
gtVI). Although sampling of primates is highly
limited, current evidence indicates that a wide
range of Old World monkey (OWM) species
may carry simian strains of HAV. gtIV was
isolated from a cynomolgus macaque in the
Philippines (Nainan et al. 1991), whereas variants classified as gtV have been found in three
different OWM species and locations (African
green monkey, Kenya; olive baboon, Uganda;
rhesus macaque, India) (Nainan et al. 1991;
Arankalle and Ramakrishnan 2009; Bennett et
al. 2016). gtVI originated from a cynomolgus
macaque originally from Indonesia (Costa-Mattioli et al. 2002).
The phylogenetic clustering of sequences
into different genotypes is supported by differences in sequence divergence between and within genotype groupings. Analyzing available
(near-) complete genome sequences, pairwise
nucleotide distances between gtI–III range
from 12.2% to 21.9% (mean, 18.2%), whereas
diversity within genotypes ranges from 0.3% to
6.5% (mean, 4.3%). Mean distances among subtypes IA/IB, IIA/IIB, and IIIA/IIIB are intermediate (9.3%, 9.6%, and 11.8%, respectively).

These ranges are comparable to those determined previously for different subgenomic regions, such as VP1 (Endo et al. 2007).
Genotype Distributions
Geographically and numerically, infections with
gtIA predominate worldwide, with a smaller
number of gtIB and IIIA sequences represented
in the VP1 dataset (Fig. 2). gtIA predominates in
almost all countries where surveillance data is
available, and includes North and South America, Europe, and large areas of Asia and Africa
(Robertson et al. 1992; Costa-Mattioli et al.
2003; Nainan et al. 2006). gtIB circulates extensively in the Middle East (Normann et al. 2008;

mental surveillance samples in Brazil. gtII was
identified among samples from France and Sierra Leone in the 1990s (Robertson et al. 1992),
but has only been rarely reported since. Although less frequently detected than gtI, gtIIIA,
and gtIIIB, variants of HAV are also distributed
globally, being reported throughout the United
States, Europe, and Asia (Robertson et al. 1992;
Nainan et al. 2006; Endo et al. 2007). The underlying reasons for the unequal frequencies of
infections with different HAV genotypes and
their somewhat different geographical distributions are uncertain.
Biological Significance of Hepatovirus
Diversity
There is very limited information currently
available on the existence of possible biological
differences among viruses belonging to different
hepatovirus species. They are all hepatotropic,
judging from the detection of high levels of viral
RNA and replication intermediates in the livers
of seals, bats, rodents, hedgehogs, and shrews
(Anthony et al. 2015; Drexler et al. 2015; Yu
et al. 2016). There is, however, some preliminary
evidence for a broader tissue distribution in bats
(Drexler et al. 2015). There is substantial amino
acid sequence divergence among capsid genes of
members of different species (Fig. 1B), greater
than 15%–20% over most of P1, although with
some variability among genotypes. This degree
of divergence is consistent with the general lack
of serological cross-reactivity described among
rodent, shrew, hedgehog, and bat sera and HAV
antigens (Drexler et al. 2015). The strong serological cross-reactivity of a small number of bat
sera could potentially be attributable to their
previous exposure to HAV or a close relative.
Compared with the extensive divergence
among sequences of viruses belonging to different hepatovirus species, variants of HAV
(Hepatovirus A) show only minimal amino acid
sequence divergence within and between genotypes. It is generally considered that human genotypes of HAV are a single serotype (Lemon
et al. 1992); even the relatively divergent HAV
gtIB and V showed almost identical neutralization profiles with panels of monoclonal antibodies (Brown et al. 1989; Crevat et al. 1990).
Vaccines for HAV may thus be equally effective across the range of genotypes documented
to date.
There is similarly little evidence for major
differences in clinical outcomes of infections
with different HAV genotypes, as might be expected from their high degree of genetic conservation. However, severe fulminant hepatitis associated with a particular genotype IA variant
been described in a number of Japanese patients,
suggesting the potential existence of strain-associated differences in pathogenicity (Fujiwara
et al. 2001; Miura et al. 2017). A cohort study
of Korean HAV-infected patients reported that
gtIII may be associated with higher levels of biochemical markers of liver damage and lower
platelet counts than gtIA, even though the overall disease severity (duration of hospital stay,
liver failure, mortality) were comparable (Kim
et al. 2013).
DIVERSITY AND TAXONOMY OF HEV
AND RELATED VIRUSES
When hepatitis E was first described as an enterically transmitted epidemic in New Delhi in
1955, following fecal contamination of drinking
water (Viswanathan 1957), the causative agent
was presumed to be a picornavirus. Subsequent
studies of virus particles revealed it to be more
like a calicivirus, but once a complete genome
sequence was obtained (Tam et al. 1991; Huang
et al. 1992; Tsarev et al. 1992), the virus was
reassigned to its own genus Hepatitis E-like viruses (renamed Hepevirus in 2004, and Orthohepevirus A in 2015), and placed in its own family, Hepeviridae, in 2009.
Like HAV, HEV has a nonenveloped virion
and a positive-sense RNA genome, but unlike
members of the Picornaviridae, it encodes a single capsid protein and its genome comprises
multiple, separately transcribed genes. A short
50
-noncoding region is followed by a long open
reading frame (ORF)1 that encodes methyltransferase, Y, papain-like cysteine protease, X,
helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
domains (see Kenney and Meng 2018). ORF1 is
immediately followed by ORF2, encoding the

capsid protein, while overlapping the 50
-end of
ORF2 is another, shorter reading frame, ORF3,
which encodes a protein with multiple functions, including one possibly acting as an ion
channel. At the 30
-end is a short noncoding region of variable length followed by a poly(A) tail.
Orthohepevirus Species
The current taxonomy of viruses within the genus Orthohepevirus is based on the phylogenetic
analysis and distribution of sequence distances
for subgenomic regions of the virus genome
(Purdy et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2015b). For example, phylogenetic analysis of a conserved region of the capsid protein supports the assignment of viruses into four species, named
Orthohepevirus A–D, together with additional
unassigned variants (Fig. 3). HEV, in the species
Orthohepevirus A, includes isolates from humans, pigs, and deer. At present, the only hepeviruses known to infect humans are those belonging to Orthohepevirus A. Human infection
is normally asymptomatic or very mild, with few
individuals developing an acute, self-limiting
hepatitis. Severe or fulminant hepatitis is a rare
outcome except in pregnant women in which
mortality can be significant. Infection can become chronic when immune function is suppressed. Infection of pigs is asymptomatic, but
HEV-infected dolphins had elevated liver transaminase levels and signs of malaise (Montalvo
Villalba et al. 2017).
Related viruses with a similar genome structure have been isolated from adult chickens with
an epidemic disease variously described as big
liver and spleen disease or hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome and associated with weight loss,
increased mortality, and decreased egg production (Payne et al. 1999; Haqshenas et al. 2001,
2002; Huang et al. 2002). These avian HEVs are
members of the species Orthohepevirus B. More
recently, additional viruses have been detected
in the rat (Johne et al. 2010a,b), musk shrew,
ferret, and mink (all members of the species
Orthohepevirus C) and in bats (Orthohepevirus
D) (Drexler et al. 2012).
Additional variants with similarities to
members of the Orthohepevirus genus, but that
do not appear to belong to these four species
(Fig. 3), have been described from moose (Lin
et al. 2014), fox (Bodewes et al. 2013), kestrel
(Reuter et al. 2016a), and little egret (Reuter
et al. 2016b), although these have yet to be
formally classified into individual species. An
incomplete virus genome obtained from a metagenomic study of sewage (hepalivirus) may represent an additional group of viruses (Ng et al.
2012). It seems likely that diversity within the
Orthohepevirus genus will be revealed to be even
more extensive as studies are extended to a wider
range of host species.
A more distantly related virus isolated
from salmonids (Hedrick et al. 1991; Batts
et al. 2011) has been assigned to the species
Piscihepevirus A, the sole member of the genus
Piscihepevirus.
HEV Diversity and Genotypes
Sequence analyses of Orthohepevirus A isolates
from humans around the world and from different host species have revealed the presence of
distinct variants that have been classified into
several genotypes (gt) and subtypes (Fig. 4).
These comprise HEV gt1–4 that have been detected in humans (Lu et al. 2006), gt5 and gt6
that have only been isolated from pigs (Takahashi et al. 2014), gt7 obtained from dromedary
camels (Woo et al. 2014) (although there is also
one report of human infection) (Lee et al. 2016),
and gt8 reported from Bactrian camels (Woo
et al. 2016). Numerous subtypes have been described within gt1–4 (Lu et al. 2006), but it is
difficult to provide consistent criteria that discriminate viruses that are members of the same
subtype from those of different subtypes (Smith
et al. 2013a). A particular difficulty applies to
variants first isolated from rabbits (Zhao et al.
2009), but now shown to also infect humans
(Izopet et al. 2012; Abravanel et al. 2017), and
that include characteristic insertions in ORF1.
These viruses group phylogenetically with gt3
isolates, but are more divergent from human
gt3 variants than these are from each other
(Smith et al. 2013a) and are currently considered
as belonging to gt3. A similar difficulty applies

Diversity of Enterically Transmitted Hepatitis Viruses

to gt5 and 6, which could alternatively be considered as subtypes of a single genotype.
A recurring problem in the description of
HEV subtypes has been the fact that several
were first defined on the basis of subgenomic
sequences (Lu et al. 2006). A result of this has
been uncertainty about the relation of these
variants to viruses sequenced in other genomic
regions; there are several examples in the literature in which the same subtype name has been
used to identify phylogenetically distinct viruses or where different names have been used for
viruses that belong to the same subtype. To
address this problem, a list of reference complete genome sequences for each subtype has
been proposed by the ICTV Hepeviridae study
group and others with an interest in the variation of the Orthohepevirus species (Smith et al.
2016b).
Sequence variability across the HEV genome
is relatively constant with few sites of insertion/
deletion and a strong bias against nonsynonymous substitution. However, there is a region of
unusual nucleotide and amino acid variability
within ORF1 between the papain-like cysteine
protease and X domains, termed the hypervariable region, which includes an intrinsically disordered region (Purdy et al. 2012) composed of
20%–30% proline and which evolves by both
mutation and duplication (Smith et al. 2012).
Another notable region is where ORF2 and
ORF3 overlap in different reading frames leading to a marked suppression of genetic variability. Finally, attempts to grow HEV in cell culture
have led to the identification of HEV strains in
which different human coding sequences have
been incorporated in frame with ORF1; these
can produce viruses that show an enhanced replication ability in vitro compared with that of the
virus strains before passage (Nguyen et al. 2012;
Shukla et al. 2012).
Diversity within other Orthohepevirus
species is much less well characterized. Four
closely related genotypes have been described
within Orthohepevirus B; two divergent genotypes within Orthohepevirus C are confined
to rodents and mustelids, respectively, and it
seems likely that multiple genotypes exist within
Orthohepevirus D.
Genotype Distributions
The genotype distribution of human isolates of
Orthohepevirus A is still incompletely known,
with sparse information about virus diversity in
many parts of the world, but particularly in Africa where the genotype(s) responsible for epidemic and sporadicinfections remains unknown
for several countries (Kim et al. 2014). gt1 is associated with epidemics of enterically transmitted hepatitis in the Indian subcontinent and Africa, with cases elsewhere apparently deriving
from recent travel to those regions. gt2 has been
reported from Mexico and Africa, where it also
associated with epidemic spread, but very few
isolates are known. To date, gt1 and 2 have only
been detected in humans. gt3 is widely distributed in Europe, Africa, North and South America,
and in Northeast and Southeast Asia. In these
regions, acute (non-travel-associated) infection
occurs sporadically with a strong bias toward
older men (Lewis et al. 2008), although serological evidence suggests a more general risk of subclinical infection in the whole population, with
25% of blood donors in the Netherlands and
Austria having evidence of past infection by the
age of 50 (Slot et al. 2013; Fischer et al. 2015). gt4
occurs in Northeast Asia with only occasional
reports in Europe (Colson et al. 2016), possibly
reflecting the recent introduction of infected pigs
from Japan (Nakano et al. 2016). These genotype
distributions are mirrored by those in domestic
pigs, wild boar, and deer in these regions, the
presumption being that human infection results
from transmission from these animal reservoirs
through consumption of undercooked meat.
Such transmission has been shown directly in a
few cases (Takahashi et al. 2004; Colson et al.
2010) and suggested by epidemiological studies
(Said et al. 2014). This simple picture has been
complicated in recent years by the detection of
HEV gt3 in goats (Di Martino et al. 2016), rats
(Kanai et al. 2012), and, unexpectedly, in bottlenose dolphins (MontalvoVillalba et al. 2017); gt4
has been detected in cows (Hu and Ma 2010;
Huang et al. 2016) and sheep (Wu et al. 2015).
That patterns of transmission are more complicated than they might seem is suggested by a
study of virus diversity among pigs in India.

This revealed that all isolates belonged to gt4,
whereas human isolates from the same region
were all gt1 (Arankalle et al. 2002). In most cases
of nonepidemic hepatitis E, the source of human
infection is unknown; addressing this should be a
priority for future research.
A complication to this description is evidence that the distribution of virus genotypes
can change over relatively short time scales.
The first isolates of HEV identified in China
before the year 2000 were gt1, but this genotype
now represents <10% of human infections, with
gt4 predominating (Liu et al. 2012). This change
may partially reflect improvements in detection
methods and interest in HEV.
However, there is also evidence for changes
in the distribution of variants within a genotype.
For example, in the period 2003–2005, subtype
3f represented 90% of infections in Southwestern France, but by 2012–2014, this had decreased to 65% with the frequency of subtype
3i ( previously described as 3c) rising from 5%
to 25% (Lhomme et al. 2015). Similarly, a new
subtype of gt3 (3c) was introduced to the United
Kingdom from about 2008, where within 5 years
it became the predominant source of infections
(Ijaz et al. 2014). This rapid shift in virus variants may reflect changes in food sourcing and
processing, although specific events have yet to
be identified. For example, the new variant was
not obviously derived from pigs from the United
Kingdom; the most closely related, although still
distinct, viruses were isolated from a German
wild boar and from Italian and French pigs
(Grierson et al. 2015).
Biological Significance of HEV Diversity
gt1 and 2 of HEV appear to differ from gt3 and 4
in their ability to be transmitted by the fecal–
oral route; only the former genotypes are associated with epidemic spread in the Indian
subcontinent and Africa, despite the presence
of the other genotypes in these regions. Similarly, although HEV gt3 can be readily detected in
human sewage (see references in Smith et al.
2016a), epidemiological studies of HEV infection in Europe do not usually report working
with water or contact with untreated sewage as
a risk factor. Another difference is that infection
with gt1 has been associated with an increased
risk of mortality in pregnant women (Jin et al.
2016), but no such association has yet been reported for gt3 or 4, despite the increased awareness of HEV infection as a leading cause of liver
disease with a potential impact on pregnancy
(Renou et al. 2014; Tabatabai et al. 2014).
There have been occasional reports of HEV
genotypes or variants associated with severe
outcomes of infection (Takahashi et al. 2009;
Jeblaoui et al. 2013). However, a study of virus
diversity in hepatitis patients with one or more
clinical sign of overt disease, compared with
that in blood donors revealed no difference in
the distribution of virus subtypes between these
two groups for separate studies in France, Germany, the Netherlands, or the United Kingdom
(Smith et al. 2015a). An assumption made in this
study, that blood donors were asymptomatic, is
qualified by the results of a follow-up of HEVinfected U.K. blood donors (Tedder et al. 2016).
Although most individuals were healthy at the
time of donation, 10% had some signs of illness
(fatigue, dark urine, pale stools, or diarrhea),
whereas for another 20% these symptoms developed subsequently, with some having elevated
transaminase levels. Among these blood donors,
there was evidence that those infected with viruses of subtypes 3a, 3b, 3c, 3h, 3i, and 3j (mostly
3c), had a lower virus load and less severe disease
than those infected with subtypes 3e, 3f, and 3g.
Nevertheless, it does not seem to be the case that
virus strains that cause overt hepatitis are distinct from those that result in asymptomatic or
relatively mild infections.
A rare outcome of HEV infection is progression to fulminant hepatitis, and there have been
suggestions that this might be related to particular genotypes, subtypes or strains of virus
(Inoue et al. 2009; Pujhari et al. 2010; Miyashita
et al. 2012; Mishra et al. 2013). However, a survey of such reports concluded that fulminant
hepatitis could occur after infection with any
genotype of HEV, and that once epidemiological
linkage of viruses was accounted for, there was
no evidence for an association with particular
subtypes or with particular mutations or strains
(Smith and Simmonds 2015).

There have been few reports of mixed infections with different subtypes of HEV (Moal et al.
2012; Smith et al. 2013a) and it is not yet known
whether there is any effect on disease outcome.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Our understanding of the diversity of HEV has
passed through phases of expansion and confusion to what may now be a period of stability in
which most virus isolates can be assigned unambiguously to a particular genotype and subtype.
In combination with diagnostic methods that are
capable of detecting viruses of different genotypes, it should now be possible to address two
important questions that relate toHEV variation.
First, it should be possible to establish the source
of human HEV infections by phylogenetic analysis of virus genomes by relating the subtypes
and variants found in human populations with
those present in contaminated foods, farmed animals, and environmental sources, with conclusive identification of sources obtained by comparison of hypervariable region sequences.
Second, increased awareness of HEV as a major
source of acute hepatitis (Kokki et al. 2016) together with more frequent analysis of virus genome sequences may reveal whether particular
virus variants are associated with specific disease
outcomes. For example, a not-infrequent outcome of HEV infection is the development of
neurological symptoms such as Guillain–Barré
syndrome, neuralgic amyotrophy, and meningoencephalitis (McLean et al. 2017), but it is
unknown whether specific virus variants are responsible for this pathology. Similarly, although
the usual treatment for HEV infection is ribavirin, there are currently no reports of theinfluence
of virus genotype on treatment outcomes; this
contrasts with hepatitis C virus where the influence of virus genotype on the efficacy of interferon and antiviral treatment has been afertile topic
of research for three decades.
