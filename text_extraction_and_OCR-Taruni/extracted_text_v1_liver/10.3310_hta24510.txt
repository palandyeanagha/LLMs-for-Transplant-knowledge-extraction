Criteria for inclusion in the Health Technology Assessment journal
Reports are published in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA programme,
and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the reviewers and editors.
Reviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed ‘systematic’ when the account of the search appraisal and synthesis
methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication of the review by others.
HTA programme
Health Technology Assessment (HTA) research is undertaken where some evidence already exists to show that a technology can
be effective and this needs to be compared to the current standard intervention to see which works best. Research can evaluate
any intervention used in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease, provided the study outcomes lead to findings that
have the potential to be of direct benefit to NHS patients. Technologies in this context mean any method used to promote
health; prevent and treat disease; and improve rehabilitation or long-term care. They are not confined to new drugs and include
any intervention used in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease.
The journal is indexed in NHS Evidence via its abstracts included in MEDLINE and its Technology Assessment Reports inform
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. HTA research is also an important source of evidence for
National Screening Committee (NSC) policy decisions.

Background: There have been no licensed treatment options in the UK for treating thrombocytopenia
in people with chronic liver disease requiring surgery. Established management largely involves platelet
transfusion prior to the procedure or as rescue therapy for bleeding due to the procedure.
Objectives: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two thrombopoietin receptor
agonists, avatrombopag (Doptelet®; Dova Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC, USA) and lusutrombopag
(Mulpleta®; Shionogi Inc., London, UK), in addition to established clinical management compared with
established clinical management (no thrombopoietin receptor agonist) in the licensed populations.
Design: Systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis.
Setting: Secondary care.
Participants: Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of < 50,000/µl) in people with chronic liver
disease requiring surgery.
Interventions: Lusutrombopag 3 mg and avatrombopag (60 mg if the baseline platelet count is
< 40,000/µl and 40 mg if it is 40,000–< 50,000/µl).
Main outcome measures: Risk of platelet transfusion and rescue therapy or risk of rescue therapy only.
Review methods: Systematic review including meta-analysis. English-language and non-English-language
articles were obtained from several databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, all searched from inception to 29 May 2019.
Economic evaluation: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.
Results: From a comprehensive search retrieving 11,305 records, six studies were included. Analysis
showed that avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior to no thrombopoietin receptor agonist
in avoiding both platelet transfusion and rescue therapy or rescue therapy only, and mostly with a
statistically significant difference (i.e. 95% confidence intervals not overlapping the point of no

v

difference). However, only avatrombopag seemed to be superior to no thrombopoietin receptor agonist
in reducing the risk of rescue therapy, although far fewer patients in the lusutrombopag trials than in the
avatrombopag trials received rescue therapy. When assessing the cost-effectiveness of lusutrombopag
and avatrombopag, it was found that, despite the success of these in avoiding platelet transfusions prior
to surgery, the additional long-term gain in quality-adjusted life-years was very small. No thrombopoietin
receptor agonist was clearly cheaper than both lusutrombopag and avatrombopag, as the cost savings
from avoiding platelet transfusions were more than offset by the drug cost. The probabilistic sensitivity
analysis showed that, for all thresholds below £100,000, no thrombopoietin receptor agonist had 100%
probability of being cost-effective.
Limitations: Some of the rescue therapy data for lusutrombopag were not available. There were
inconsistencies in the avatrombopag data. From the cost-effectiveness point of view, there were several
additional important gaps in the evidence required, including the lack of a price for avatrombopag.
Conclusions: Avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior to no thrombopoietin receptor agonist
in avoiding both platelet transfusion and rescue therapy, but they were not cost-effective given the
lack of benefit and increase in cost.
Future work: A head-to-head trial is warranted.
Study registration: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019125311.

Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment;

Plain English summary
Thrombocytopenia, which is a reduction in platelet numbers in the blood, is a common complication
of chronic liver disease. It increases the risk of bleeding during procedures including liver biopsy and
transplantation. It can delay or prevent procedures, leading to illness and death. Established treatment
largely involves platelet transfusion before the procedure or as rescue therapy for bleeding. This report
aims to systematically review the clinical effectiveness and estimate the cost-effectiveness of the first
two recently licensed treatments, thrombopoietin receptor agonists avatrombopag (Doptelet®; Dova
Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC, USA) (60 mg if platelet count is < 40,000/µl and 40 mg if platelet count is
40,000–< 50,000/µl) and lusutrombopag (Mulpleta®; Shionogi Inc., London, UK) (3 mg if platelet count is
< 50,000/µl), compared with established treatment.
From a comprehensive search, six studies were included. Clinical effectiveness analysis showed that
avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior to no thrombopoietin receptor agonist in avoiding both
platelet transfusion and rescue therapy. Only avatrombopag seemed superior to no thrombopoietin
receptor agonist in reducing rescue therapy alone.
Cost-effectiveness analysis found that lusutrombopag and avatrombopag were more expensive than
no thrombopoietin receptor agonist over a lifetime, as the savings from avoiding platelet transfusions
were exceeded by the drug cost, and without long-term health benefits. The probabilistic sensitivity
analysis, which examined the effect of uncertainty, showed that no thrombopoietin receptor agonist
had 100% probability of being cost-effective. Uncertainty about the price of avatrombopag and
the content and costs of platelet transfusions and the potential under-reporting of use to estimate
platelet transfusion-specific mortality had the greatest impact on results. If the price of avatrombopag
was (confidential information has been removed) below the price of lusutrombopag, avatrombopag
would become cost saving in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup. However, although in some scenarios
avatrombopag costs could decrease in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup to around 10% more than
the cost of no thrombopoietin receptor agonist, there would be negligible health benefits and the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios would remain very high, meaning that lusutrombopag and
avatrombopag would still not be considered cost-effective.

Scientific summary
Background
Platelets play a critical role in haemostasis, a process that causes bleeding to stop. A reduction in
platelets circulating in the blood is referred to as thrombocytopenia. It is usually defined as a platelet
count of < 150,000 per microlitre of blood.
Thrombocytopenia occurs frequently in chronic liver disease, either directly or as a result of
interferon-based antiviral treatment of liver infection. Severe thrombocytopenia arising from the risk
of excessive bleeding during and after surgery can significantly affect the clinical management of
chronic liver disease, leading to delay and, potentially, to increased morbidity and mortality.
Until this assessment, to our knowledge there were no licensed treatment options in the UK for
treating thrombocytopenia in people with chronic liver disease requiring surgery. Treatment for severe
thrombocytopenia can include platelet transfusion, splenic artery embolisation and surgical splenectomy.
The interventions studied are small-molecule thrombopoietin receptor agonists avatrombopag (Doptelet®;
Dova Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC, USA) and lusutrombopag (Mulpleta®; Shionogi Inc., London, UK).
The licensed dose of avatrombopag will be dependent on baseline platelet count (i.e. 60 mg if the
baseline platelet count is < 40,000/µl and 40 mg if it is 40,000–< 50,000/µl). The recommended dose
of lusutrombopag is 3 mg once per day for 7 days, and the elective procedure should be performed
from day 9 after treatment initiation.
Objectives
l To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of avatrombopag and lusutrombopag
within their marketing authorisations in comparison with no thrombopoietin receptor agonist
(established clinical management without either thrombopoietin receptor agonist, including, but not
limited to, platelet transfusion) for treating thrombocytopenia in people with chronic liver disease
needing an elective procedure.
l Because the licensed dose for avatrombopag is dependent on baseline platelet count (i.e. 60 mg
if the baseline platelet count is < 40,000/µl and 40 mg if it is 40,000–< 50,000/µl), both clinical
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted in each of these two subgroups.
Methods
Throughout the review, the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook and
the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, York, were applied to reduce the risk of bias and error.
Literature searches were conducted to identify relevant information about the clinical effectiveness,
safety and cost-effectiveness of avatrombopag and lusutrombopag. The searches also identified studies
of the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of established clinical management of
thrombocytopenia in people with chronic liver disease. English-language and non-English-language
articles were obtained from several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, all of which were searched from inception. Grey literature was also
searched, and reference checking of included studies was carried out. The following inclusion criteria
were applied for screening: adults with thrombocytopenia associated with chronic liver disease needing
an elective procedure, avatrombopag or lusutrombopag as intervention and any one of a range of

clinical effectiveness outcomes. Titles and abstracts identified through electronic database and other
searches were independently screened by two reviewers. During this initial phase of the screening
process, any references that it could be determined from the title or abstract did not meet the
inclusion criteria were excluded. Full-paper copies were obtained of all of the remaining references.
These were then independently examined in detail by two reviewers to determine whether or not
they met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Data extraction and quality assessment using the
Cochrane Collaboration Quality Assessment Tool for randomised controlled trials was carried out
by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was conducted using both fixed-effects and random-effects models,
and forest plots of effect sizes were presented for each of the main outcomes, which were the
proportion of patients receiving no platelet transfusion prior to the elective procedure or rescue
therapy for bleeding, and the proportion of patients receiving no platelet transfusion prior to the
elective procedure. These outcomes were determined on the basis that they were the primary
outcomes in all but one of the trials. Another outcome of interest was the proportion of patients
receiving no rescue therapy for bleeding (referred to as ‘rescue therapy’). Neither quality of life nor
survival was an outcome in any study, although mortality was reported. Subgroup analysis according
to degree of thrombocytopenia (< 40,000/µl or 40,000–< 50,000/µl) was performed in order to match
the expected licensed doses of avatrombopag. Sensitivity analysis according to clinical and statistical
heterogeneity (I
2) was conducted.
The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for the subgroups separately (patients with a platelet
count of < 40,000/µl and patients with a platelet count of 40,000–< 50,000/µl), using a decisionanalytic model, which included a short-term decision tree to model the clinical trial period (35 days)
and an appended Markov model to model the life expectancy of a person with chronic liver disease
over the long term (50 years). The short-term decision tree model has the following chance nodes:
(1) receiving/not receiving platelet transfusion, (2) rescue therapy/no rescue therapy, (3) receiving/not
receiving the elective invasive procedure within the 35-day study period and (4) death/no death due
to platelet transfusion, surgery or rescue therapy. In addition, adverse events resulting from treatment,
platelet transfusion and surgery were included in the model. The primary efficacy and safety inputs
for the no thrombopoietin receptor agonist, lusutrombopag and avatrombopag treatment arms were
obtained from an indirect treatment comparison that was performed using Bayesian meta-analysis.
The utility, cost and mortality inputs were sourced from the literature and detailed data from the
trials. The deterministic base-case results from the cost-effectiveness analysis were presented together
with the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. This incorporates the parametric uncertainty surrounding the
input parameters utilised in the economic model as well as the results from scenario analyses, which
focused on the economic model’s structural uncertainty.
Study results
From a comprehensive search that retrieved 11,305 records, 35 references pertaining to six studies
were included after screening. All six studies were rated as being at low risk of bias in both sets of
the trials for each of the thrombopoietin receptor agonists: ADAPT-1, ADAPT-2 and Study 202 for
avatrombopag, and L-PLUS (Lusutrombopag for the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Patients with
Chronic Liver Disease Undergoing Invasive Procedures), L-PLUS 2 (Lusutrombopag for the Treatment
of Thrombocytopenia in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease Undergoing Invasive Procedures 2) and
the JapicCTI-121944 study for lusutrombopag.
The main finding was that both avatrombopag (for both platelet subgroups) and lusutrombopag were
clearly clinically effective in comparison with no thrombopoietin receptor agonist in terms of primary
outcomes, including that for three of the main trials, ADAPT-1, ADAPT-2 and L-PLUS 2, that is avoidance
of platelet transfusion or rescue procedure for bleeding. Neither avatrombopag nor lusutrombopag was
unequivocally better than no thrombopoietin receptor agonist in terms of adverse events, and a small
amount of evidence showed a higher percentage of deaths with both thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

The main outcomes of avoidance of the composite outcome no platelet transfusion before the elective
procedure or rescue therapy, or avoidance of platelet transfusion only, were analysed according to
the subgroups that matched the expected licensed doses of avatrombopag (< 40,000/µl for 60 mg
or 40,000–< 50,000/µl for 40 mg). Both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior to placebo
and mostly with a statistically significant difference (i.e. 95% confidence intervals did not overlap the
point of no difference). However, when the outcome of avoidance of rescue therapy was considered
alone, albeit only in those who did not receive platelet transfusion before the elective procedure,
the lusutrombopag trials were revealed to have a much lower frequency than the avatrombopag
trials regardless of treatment arm, the explanation for which is not obvious. They also show that there
was no statistically significant difference between lusutrombopag and placebo. However, there was
a statistically significant difference for avatrombopag in the < 40,000/µl subgroup of ADAPT-1 and
the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup of ADAPT-2. This did imply an advantage of avatrombopag over
lusutrombopag in the risk of avoiding rescue therapy from meta-analysis using an indirect comparison,
but this was statistically significant only in the fixed-effects analysis on the relative risk scale of the
< 40,000/µl subgroup (Table a).
Clinical heterogeneity was found between the lusutrombopag trials as well as between the lusutrombopag
and avatrombopag sets of trials. However, statistical heterogeneity was no more than moderate, and
the robustness of outcomes in terms of the extent of difference between thrombopoietin receptor
agonist and no thrombopoietin receptor agonist and between both thrombopoietin receptor agonists
was demonstrated in sensitivity analyses. Survival was not an efficacy outcome, and mortality data were
provided for only very short-term follow-up, although there appeared to be little difference between
treatments. No quality-of-life data were provided, although it is plausible that thrombopoietin receptor
agonists have little clinical impact other than reducing the need for platelet transfusion.
When the cost-effectiveness of both thrombopoietin receptor agonists compared with no thrombopoietin
receptor agonist was assessed, it was clear that, in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, thrombopoietin
receptor agonists has only a marginal benefit over care as usual (Table b). When uncertainty is taken
into account, both lusutrombopag and avatrombopag have about 50% chance of being more effective
than no thrombopoietin receptor agonist. This essentially reduces the cost-effectiveness analysis to a
cost-minimisation analysis. For both subgroups, no thrombopoietin receptor agonist clearly has the
lowest costs, even uncertainties are taken into account.
In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, it was shown that, for all thresholds below £100,000, no
thrombopoietin receptor agonist had 100% probability of being cost-effective.
Various scenario analyses showed that the results are most sensitive to the (currently unknown) price
of avatrombopag.

xxii

In 3 of the 15 other scenarios, ‘number of adult therapeutic doses per platelet transfusion’, ‘cost of platelet
transfusion’ and ‘under-reporting factor for serious hazards of transfusion data platelet transfusion-specific
mortality’, the avatrombopag costs would decrease in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup to values
around 10% more than no thrombopoietin receptor agonist in the most extreme scenarios. However,
even then, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios would remain very high and clearly out of the range
of acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
Conclusions
If the aim of service provision is to reduce platelet transfusion prior to elective procedures in patients
with chronic liver disease, then both lusutrombopag 3 mg and avatrombopag, 60 mg or 40 mg for
the < 40,000/µl or 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroups, respectively, would seem to be able to do that
safely. The evidence suggests that avatrombopag might also be able to reduce the need for rescue
therapy for bleeding. However, given the large difference between the rates of rescue therapy in the
lusutrombopag and avatrombopag trials, it is uncertain what the circumstances are under which this
might be observed in clinical practice. The assessment of the cost-effectiveness of lusutrombopag and
avatrombopag confirmed that, although both were successful in avoiding platelet transfusions prior
to surgery, this did not translate into additional long-term health benefits over placebo in terms of
quality-adjusted life-years. Therefore, cost minimisation becomes the focus. For both platelet count
subgroups, no thrombopoietin receptor agonist was clearly cheaper than both lusutrombopag and
avatrombopag, as the cost savings from avoiding platelet transfusions were more than offset by
the cost of the drugs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that, for all thresholds below
£100,000, no thrombopoietin receptor agonist had a 100% probability of being cost-effective.
Uncertainty surrounding the price of avatrombopag, the content and costs of platelet transfusions and
the potential under-reporting in the data used to estimate platelet transfusion specific mortality had
most impact on results. However, even when extreme values were tested, incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios comparing lusutrombopag and avatrombopag with no thrombopoietin receptor agonist remained
substantially higher than National Institute for Health and Care Excellence thresholds.
Given the need to compare the two thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the potential lack of
comparability of the extant trials, a head-to-head trial is warranted. Ideally, this should measure all
relevant outcomes, including risk of platelet transfusion separate from rescue therapy and with a
longer follow-up, at least of mortality and quality of life. The trial should be of a size that permits
subgroup analysis according to baseline platelet count as well as in terms of type of chronic liver
disease and elective procedure. Any future trials in this area should focus on the consistent collection
of data on the content of platelet transfusions in terms of the number of platelets transfused or
consistently and clearly defining terms such as units or doses so that accurate costs can be calculated.
This is particularly important given that the avoidance of platelet transfusion does not seem to translate
into differences in quality-adjusted life-years. Therefore, accurate costing is crucial for decision-making.

Chapter 1 Background
Description of the health problem
Platelets play a critical role in haemostasis, a process that causes bleeding to stop. A reduction in
platelets circulating in the blood is referred to as thrombocytopenia. It is usually defined as a platelet
count of < 150,000 per µl of blood.1
Thrombocytopenia occurs frequently in chronic liver disease (CLD), either directly or as a result of
interferon-based antiviral treatment of liver infection. Severe thrombocytopenia, because it increases
the risk of excessive bleeding during and after surgery, can significantly affect the clinical management
of CLD, leading to delay and, potentially, to increased morbidity and mortality.1
Adults with thrombocytopenia associated with CLD can undergo various types of elective procedure.
These procedures might be classified by associated bleeding risk, based on the published literature,
into one of three categories:2
1. low risk (paracentesis, thoracentesis, gastrointestinal endoscopy)
2. moderate risk (liver biopsy, bronchoscopy, ethanol ablation therapy, chemoembolisation)
3. high risk (vascular catheterisation, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, dental procedures,
renal biopsy, biliary interventions, nephrostomy tube placement, radiofrequency ablation,
laparoscopic interventions).
Between 2016 and 2017, Hospital Episode Statistics showed that 27,927 people were admitted to
hospital with liver disease in England.3 The prevalence of thrombocytopenia among people with CLD
varies from 15% to 70% depending on the stage of liver disease and the platelet count cut-off value
used to define thrombocytopenia.
Current service provision
Until this assessment, no licensed treatment options had been recommended by the National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for treating thrombocytopenia in people with CLD requiring
surgery. Typical therapies include stimulation of megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production.
Treatment for severe thrombocytopenia can include platelet transfusion, splenic artery embolisation
and surgical splenectomy.
The NICE clinical guideline CG244 recommends that for anyone having an invasive procedure or
surgery, apart from those with a low risk of bleeding, a platelet transfusion is considered in order to
raise the platelet count to above:
l 50,000/µl in any type of patient
l 50,000–75,000/µl in patients with a high risk of bleeding, depending on procedure, aetiology,
if platelet count is stable and any other cause of abnormal haemostasis
l 100,000/µl ‘. . . in critical sites, such as the central nervous system (including the posterior segment of
the eyes)’ (reproduced with permission © NICE 2015. Blood Transfusion. Available from www.nice.org.

Description of the technology under assessment
Avatrombopag (Doptelet®; Dova Pharmaceuticals, Durham, NC, USA) is a small-molecule thrombopoietin
receptor agonist (TPO-RA) that targets the c-MpI thrombopoietin cell surface receptor on megakaryocytes
to stimulate platelet production. Avatrombopag is administered orally. It has been compared in clinical
trials with placebo in people with thrombocytopenia associated with CLD requiring an elective procedure.
It received marketing authorisation in the UK on 25 June 2019.5 The full indication is ‘Doptelet is
indicated for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who
are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure’ (reproduced with permission; © European Medicines
Agency).5 The European Medicines Agency6 recommends that avatrombopag be administered for 5 days
at a dose of:
l 60 mg if the baseline platelet count is < 40,000/µl
l 40 mg if the baseline platelet count is 40,000–< 50,000/µl.
The elective procedure should be performed 10–13 days after treatment initiation.
Lusutrombopag (Mulpleta®; Shionogi Inc., London, UK) is a small-molecule TPO-RA that targets the c-MpI
thrombopoietin cell surface receptor on megakaryocytes to stimulate platelet production. Lusutrombopag
is administered orally. It has been compared in clinical trials with placebo in people with thrombocytopenia
with a platelet count of < 50 × 109/µl associated with CLD requiring elective invasive surgery. It received
marketing authorisation on 14 March 2019.7 The following indication was agreed: ‘Treatment of severe
thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease undergoing invasive procedures’ (reproduced
with permission; © European Medicines Agency).7 The European Medicines Agency recommends a
dose of 3 mg once daily for 7 days and that the elective procedure be performed from day 9 after
treatment initiation.8
Patient and public involvement
There was no patient and public involvement in the study because this was a multiple technology
appraisal for NICE, which does not require patient and public involvement. However, patient and public
involvement is part of decision-making by NICE, including during appraisal committee meetings with
invited patient experts.

Chapter 3 Assessment of clinical effectiveness
This report contains reference to confidential information provided as part of the NICE appraisal process.
This information has been removed from the report and the results, discussions and conclusions of
the report do not include the confidential information. These sections are clearly marked in the report.
Methods for reviewing effectiveness
Throughout this review, the methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions9 and by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD),10 York, were applied to reduce
the risk of bias and error. All methods were in accordance with a protocol registered on PROSPERO as
record number CRD42019125311.
Identification of studies
Literature searches were conducted to identify relevant information on the clinical effectiveness,
safety and cost-effectiveness of avatrombopag and lusutrombopag. The searches also identified
studies of the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of established clinical management
of thrombocytopenia in people with CLD, including platelet transfusion, stimulation of megakaryocyte
maturation and platelet production, splenic artery embolisation and surgical splenectomy. All literature
searches were undertaken to the highest standard to meet the best practice requirements of the
CRD10 and the Cochrane Collaboration.9
The search strategies combined relevant search terms comprising indexed keywords [e.g. medical
subject heading (MeSH) terms and EMTREE] and free-text terms appearing in the title and/or abstract
of database records. Search terms were identified from discussions with the review team, by scanning
background literature and ‘key articles’ already known to the review team, and by browsing database
thesauri. Search strategies were developed specifically for each database and the keywords were
adapted for the configuration of each database. Only studies conducted in humans were sought.
Searches were not limited by language, publication status (i.e. unpublished or published) or date of
publication. Methodological study design filters were not included in the search strategies to ensure
sensitivity and the optimal identification of clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness studies.
Full details of the search strategies are presented in Appendix 1.

The bibliographies of identified research and review articles were checked for relevant studies.
Handling of citations
Identified references were downloaded into EndNote X8 [Clarivate Analytics (formerly Thomson Reuters),
Philadelphia, PA, USA] bibliographic management software for further assessment and handling. Individual
records in the EndNote library were tagged with searching information, such as searcher, date searched,
database host, database searched, strategy name and iteration, theme and search question. This enabled
the information specialist to track the origin of each individual database record and the record’s progress
through the screening and review process.
Quality assurance within the search process
For all searches undertaken by the KSR information team, the main EMBASE strategy was independently
peer reviewed by a second KSR information specialist. The search strategy peer review was informed by
items based on the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health checklist.11,12

Abstraction strategy
Study selection
Titles and abstracts identified from electronic database and other searches were independently
screened by two reviewers. During this initial phase of the screening process any references that
obviously did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Full-paper copies of all of the remaining
references were obtained. These were then independently examined in detail by two reviewers to
determine whether or not they met the inclusion criteria. All papers excluded at this second stage of
the screening process along with the reasons for their exclusion are listed in Table 35 (see Appendix 2).
These reasons were categorised as follows:
l not relevant population (i.e. not thrombocytopenia associated with CLD needing an elective procedure)
l not relevant intervention
l not relevant outcome data (i.e. did not assess at least one of the specified outcomes or did not
report relevant data or information that would allow the calculation of relevant data)
l not relevant study (i.e. not a RCT, cohort study or case series)
l insufficient study size (< 20 participants).
At both screening stages, any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through discussion or by
the intervention of a third reviewer.
A flow diagram of the numbers of studies included and excluded at each stage has been provided
following guidance in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) statement.

Data extraction
Data extraction sheets were individually designed and piloted using Microsoft Excel® (Microsoft
Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The extraction process was performed by two reviewers, with one
checking the extraction of the other. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or by the
intervention of a third reviewer. Studies are identified by the trial name. To avoid the duplication
of data where studies (or study populations) have multiple publications, the most complete report is
used as the main reference, but additional details have been extracted from the other publications
as necessary. The following general information and data were extracted from each study, regardless of
review topic:
l EndNote ID
l study ID or name (if reported; otherwise, surname of first author)
l year of publication
l other related publications
l study group (if reported)
l study country/countries
l recruitment dates (if relevant)
l location/setting
l study funding (public/pharmaceutical/not reported)
l study aim
l sample size
l study design
l study methods
l patient characteristics
l treatment characteristics
l results (all outcomes reported in Chapter 2, Decision problem)
l study conclusions.
Critical appraisal strategy
The quality of each individual study was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Quality Assessment
Tool for RCTs.13
The findings of the quality assessment were used to ensure that the conclusions and findings of these
reviews were based on the best available evidence and that any potential sources of bias in the data
were identified.
Methods of data synthesis
Data are summarised in the context of population variation in aetiology of liver disease, degree of
thrombocytopenia, bleeding risk and type of elective procedure. Subgroup analysis by degree of
thrombocytopenia is also presented.
Quantitative analysis and meta-analysis methods (direct ‘head-to-head’ methods)
Forest plots of effect sizes are presented for each of the main efficacy outcomes. Dichotomous outcomes
(e.g. proportion of patients experiencing each type of outcome) are reported as relative risks (RRs) and
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Pooled effect sizes and 95% CIs using random-effects models are presented where two or more trials
are considered to be clinically and statistically homogeneous.
The judgement of clinical homogeneity is based on the baseline characteristics of the trial populations
(i.e. age, sex, aetiology of liver disease, degree of thrombocytopenia, bleeding risk and type of elective
procedure). Statistical homogeneity is assessed using the I
2 statistic.14 This measures the degree of
inconsistency between the study results that is due to genuine heterogeneity rather than chance.

The value of I
2 lies between 0% and 100%. For the purposes of this review, a simplified categorisation of
heterogeneity is used: low (0–25%), moderate (26–75%) and high (> 75%). Studies will be considered to
be sufficiently similar for the purposes of pooling only if I
2 < 75%.14
Publication bias could not be assessed given that there were too few trials to use funnel plots of the
point estimate plotted against the standard error (SE).15
Indirect comparisons
Where the intervention and comparator were not compared in the same RCT (i.e. ‘head-to-head’ trials
of A vs. B), but instead were separately compared with a common comparator, for example placebo,
an indirect comparison of these was performed. Point estimates (with 95% CIs) were estimated using
‘indirect’ methods, for example from A versus C and B versus C, where C is a common control group
(e.g. placebo). All methods are applied with consideration of the basic properties of homogeneity,
similarity and consistency as reported in Dias et al.16 All indirect comparisons are consistent with NICE
methodological guidance for the conduct of direct and indirect meta-analysis,17 which includes indirect
comparisons using the Bucher method.18
Indirect meta-analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel using the Bucher method.18 RRs and ORs with
95% CIs were calculated for each outcome and available treatment comparison.
Heterogeneity was investigated using the I
2 statistic for each of the pairwise comparisons.14 If there were
concerns about heterogeneity, or if any trials appeared to have results that differed substantially from
the others, then one or more trials were removed in a sensitivity analysis.
Bayesian network meta-analysis
As its outputs can be directly integrated into a probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) framework,
network meta-analysis using WinBUGs version 1.4.3 (www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml)
(Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK) was applied using a Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach consistent with international recommendations. This method generates a
set of simulated values in the form of a posterior distribution for each of the ORs between each TPO-RA
and no TPO-RA. The specification of an evidence-based baseline average risk with its SE then permits the
simulation of an absolute risk for each of the three treatments, namely lusutrombopag, avatrombopag and
no TPO-RA, as described in NICE Technical Support Document 2.16 Note that the simulation from the
Bayesian posterior distribution provided both statistical estimation and inference, as well as a platform for
probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty. Each of the simulated absolute risks from the Bayesian
MCMC was consistent and coherent and was used as an input in the CEA model to calculate the expected
values of cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using a Monte Carlo simulation.
Posterior distribution parameter estimates were obtained from 100,000 simulations after a burn-in period
of 30,000 MCMC simulations, using two chains. Vague normal priors (mean 0, variance 10,000) were used
for treatment effects and a vague uniform prior (0, 5) was used for the between-study standard deviation.
Convergence and auto-correlation were assessed by monitoring the trace, Gelman–Rubin statistics
(BGR plot) and autocorrelation plots in WinBUGS. The ORs estimated using this method were almost
identical to those estimated using the Bucher method.
Results
Quantity and quality of research available
As a result of all searching, after deduplication, 11,305 records were screened at the title and abstract
stage. From these, 91 were selected to be rescreened at the full-paper stage. After full-paper screening
of the 91 records was complete, 35 references were included that fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

No additional references were found by reference checking. Therefore, in total, 35 references
pertaining to six studies were included. The results of screening are shown in Figure 1. The list
of included studies is shown in Table 1: ADAPT-1,37 ADAPT-2,37 L-PLUS 139 (Lusutrombopag for
the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease Undergoing Invasive
Procedures), L-PLUS 254 (Lusutrombopag for the Treatment of Thrombocytopenia in Patients With

All studies were generally rated as being at low risk of bias, as shown in Table 2. In addition, both sets
of main trials for each of the TPO-RAs (ADAPT-1, ADAPT-2, L-PLUS 1 and L-PLUS 2) were of high
quality, being found to be at low risk of bias on all criteria.
Study characteristics
As shown in Table 3, all of the studies were multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel
RCTs. Participation was restricted to adults. Three of these trials compared avatrombopag with placebo
(Study 202,51 ADAPT-137 and ADAPT-237), and the other three trials compared lusutrombopag with
placebo (L-PLUS 1,39 L-PLUS 254 and JAPIC CTI-12194453). Patients were recruited worldwide, with
the exception of three studies: one of avatrombopag, Study 20251 (solely based in USA), and two
of lusutrombopag, L-PLUS 139 and JAPIC CTI-12194453 (solely based in Japan). Time was limited to
between 3 and 5 weeks. With the exception of Study 202,51 which was carried out in 2014, all studies
were carried out in 2018 or later.37,39,53,54 As shown in Table 6, the number of participants in individual
arms of the included studies ranged from 15 to 108. The trials studying avatrombopag reported on a
total of 467 participants and the trials studying lusutrombopag reported on a total of 342 participants.

Degree of thrombocytopaenia
As described in Table 4, all six studies restricted patients to those with a platelet count of < 50,000/µl.
ADAPT 1 and ADAPT 237 differed from the other studies in that results were published only according
to the subgroups < 40,000 and 40,000–< 50,000/µl, given the variation in dose of avatrombopag
according to these subgroups. Given the need to compare lusutrombopag with avatrombopag, data in
these subgroups were requested of Shionogi and are presented in Chapter 3, Results, Subgroup analyses.
Disease type
As shown in Table 4, in terms of the type of CLD reported by each study, one study53 reported
including a single type of disease (hepatocellular carcinoma; JapicCTI-121944), whereas five
studies37,39,51,54 reported on a mixed CLD population (ADAPT-1, ADAPT-2, L-PLUS 1, L-PLUS 2, Study
202). Three studies37,51 (ADAPT-1, ADAPT-2, Study 202) reported on a CLD definition based on a
model for end-stage liver disease score of ≤ 24. Two studies39,54 (L-PLUS 1, L-PLUS 2) reported on a
CLD definition based on Child–Pugh class A or B; of note, the exclusion criteria reported in the L-PLUS
1 study39 implied that inclusion was based on Child–Pugh class A or B, but this was not stated
explicitly. By contrast, the percentage of participants in the ADAPT trials who were in Child–Pugh class
C was above zero.37 The proportion was generally low in ADAPT-137 (i.e. no higher than 8.6% in the
avatrombopag arm of the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup), although it was as high as 15.2% in the
placebo arm of the same subgroup in ADAPT-2.37
Elective procedure type
Elective procedures reported in each study were quite varied (Table 5). Only one study53 reported a single
type of procedure (liver radiofrequency ablation; JapicCTI-121944). The other five studies37,39,51,54
reported including mixed types of elective procedures. Only ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 explicitly mentioned
risk of bleeding, stating that they included both ‘low-risk’ procedures, for example liver biopsy, and ‘highrisk’ procedures, for example radiofrequency ablation. Both L-PLUS 139 and L-PLUS 2,54 also according to
this definition, included mixed-risk procedures, such as liver biopsy and radiofrequency ablation.
Decision rule for determining treatment dose
There appeared to be some variation in the decision rules for administering platelet transfusion prior
to the elective procedure. The L-PLUS39,54 studies mandated this on the basis of a drop in platelet count
below the 50,000/µl threshold, whereas this rule was not explicitly reported in the ADAPT trials.37
However, because those eligible for the ADAPT studies37 were at ‘. . . risk of bleeding that would require
a platelet transfusion, unless there was a clinically significant increase in platelet counts from baseline’,
it seems likely that the same rule would be applied. There was also a difference in the decision rules for
administering the intervention. In the ADAPT trials,37 all patients received avatrombopag for 5 days,
whereas in the L-PLUS trials39,54 lusutrombopag was administered for between 5 and 7 days depending
on platelet count (i.e. if the platelet count was at least 50 × 109/l with an increase of at least 20 × 109/l
then no additional dose was given). The implication of this difference is that lusutrombopag was
administered, on average, over a longer period than avatrombopag.
Assessment of effectiveness
Not all studies had precisely the same primary outcome (Table 7). In two studies39,53 (JapicCTI-12194453
and L-PLUS 139) the proportion of patients who did not require platelet transfusion before the elective
procedure was the primary outcome. Three studies (ADAPT-1,37 ADAPT-237 and L-PLUS 254) reported a
composite outcome of the proportion of patients who did not require platelet transfusion or a rescue
procedure for bleeding from randomisation up to 7 days following the elective procedure as the primary
outcome. One study51 (Study 202) reported the percentage of participants with an increase in platelet
count of ≥ 20,000/µl above baseline and at least one platelet count of > 50,000/µl from days 4 to 8 as
the primary outcome.

Despite the differences in primary outcome, both avatrombopag (for both platelet subgroups) and
lusutrombopag were clearly effective in comparison with no TPO-RA in terms of the primary outcome
(Table 8).37,54 The difference between the intervention and comparator groups in the proportion of
patients receiving neither platelet transfusion nor rescue therapy following procedure was generally
greater for avatrombopag at any dose than for lusutrombopag, the only exception being in ADAPT-237
in the < 40,000/µl subgroup where the difference was lowest. However, it should be noted that the
extent to which the outcomes in the two sets of trials are comparable is unclear. There appears to be a
difference in the timing of measurements of platelet transfusion avoided, with the JapicCTI-12194453
and L-PLUS 139 studies specifying that this was prior to the elective procedure and the ADAPT-137 and
L-PLUS 254 studies specifying that it was up to 7 days following randomisation. As the primary outcome
is also a composite of the number of platelet transfusions and the number of rescue procedures in
the ADAPT-137 and L-PLUS 254 studies, the independent contributions of these two variables are also
unclear. As shown in Table 9, lusutrombopag was effective in both the international study,54 L-PLUS 2,
and the Japanese study,39 L-PLUS 1, in avoiding platelet transfusion. However, no such data were
reported in the ADAPT trials37 and no data were reported for rescue procedure separately for either
TPO-RA. However, as described in Chapter 3, Results, Subgroup analyses, these data were obtained by
request for clarification.56,57
Both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were reported to increase the proportion of patients with
increased platelet counts, as shown in Table 10, in terms of the primary outcome for Study 202.51
For lusutrombopag, this was observed in both of the L-PLUS trials.39,54 It was also observed in the
Japanese study53 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The ADAPT trials37 did not use this outcome,
but avatrombopag was shown to be effective in achieving the target platelet level of 50 × 109/µl.
Safety
As shown in Table 11, neither avatrombopag nor lusutrombopag was unequivocally better than no
TPO-RA in terms of adverse events (AEs). In particular, L-PLUS 254 showed a higher percentage of
deaths with lusutrombopag (3/107; 2.8%) than with placebo (0/107; 0%). However, it was judged by
the investigator that none of these deaths was related to treatment with lusutrombopag. Indeed, one
death was a result of a protocol violation in a patient with Child–Pugh class C liver disease, which does
imply a much higher mortality rate. The second patient died from a progression of hepatic cirrhosis,
and the third patient died because of procedurally related vessel perforation. ADAPT–137 also showed

more deaths with avatrombopag 40 mg in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup, although, again,
the investigator deemed that these deaths were not associated with the study drug. One patient
suffered from hepatic coma, which was due to underlying cirrhosis, and the other patient was stated
to have died from multiorgan system failure. However, the clinical study report (CSR) revealed that
the individual had suffered a bleeding event: ‘Bleeding oesophageal varices/Oesophageal varices’.
58
On the other hand, there was only one death in this subgroup in ADAPT-237 and this was in the
placebo arm. There were no deaths in the < 40,000/µl subgroup.
The outcome with regard to serious adverse events (SAEs) was a little more favourable towards
lusutrombopag, with more SAEs reported in the placebo arm in L-PLUS 139 and equal percentages
in L-PLUS 2.54 The outcome for avatrombopag was mixed; there were higher percentages of SAEs in
the placebo arm, except in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup in ADAPT-1,37 where this was reversed.
Discontinuation as a result of AEs was reported only in the < 40,000/µl subgroup in ADAPT-137
for avatrombopag (2/89; 2.2%) compared with placebo (0/48; 0%). There was no clear difference
in the percentage of AEs (of any severity) between TPO-RAs and no TPO-RA.37,39,51,53,54 Specific SAEs
were too rare to allow any inference to be made about the effect of the intervention (see Appendix 3).
Subgroup analyses
As the dose of avatrombopag varies by platelet count, to make a comparison between avatrombopag
and lusutrombopag the outcomes needed to be estimated by subgroup analysis. Therefore, the
assessment group (AG) requested these data from Shionogi and they were provided in its response.
They were first used to estimate the RRs versus placebo, which are summarised in Tables 12–15.
What can be observed is that, for both subgroups, both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are superior
to placebo and mostly with a statistically significant difference [i.e. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) do
not overlap the point of no difference], the only exception being for the very small JapicCTI-121944
study.53 This interpretation does not vary with the use of the OR scale (see Appendix 4). Study 20251 was
excluded from these analyses, and therefore from those reported in Chapter 3, Results, Meta-analysis,
because of the lack of collection of the necessary data, as revealed in the CSR.59
In addition to these outcomes, the proportions of those who required no rescue therapy who received
platelet transfusion were estimated, and these are shown in Tables 20 and 21. These numbers were
calculated by dividing the number who had received neither platelet transfusion nor rescue therapy
by the number who had received no platelet transfusion prior to the elective procedure, and show that
the lusutrombopag trials differ from the avatrombopag trials in frequency of rescue therapy, regardless
of treatment arm. The explanation for this is not obvious. Very few patients received rescue therapy in
the lusutrombopag trials: only two patients and only in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup. In addition,
the only type of rescue other than platelet transfusion was red blood cells.56 This contrasts with the
ADAPT trials,37 in which as few as 42.3% patients did not receive rescue therapy and, in addition, any
of the following rescue therapies was administered:
l platelet
l whole blood, or packed red cell transfusions
l plasma
l cryoprecipitate
l vitamin K
l desmopressin
l recombinant activated factor VII
l aminocaproic acid
l tranexamic acid
l surgical intervention
l interventional radiology.

Regardless of the difference in absolute risk, Table 16 shows that there is no statistically significant
difference between lusutrombopag and placebo. However, there is a difference for avatrombopag in
the < 40,000/µl subgroup of ADAPT-137 and the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup of ADAPT-237 (Table 17).
This interpretation is similar with the use of the OR scale, although the OR for lusutrombopag in the
< 40,000/µl subgroup is not estimable and there is also a statistically significant difference for
avatrombopag in both ADAPT trials37 in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup (see Appendix 4).
The proportion of those who received no rescue therapy given receipt of platelet transfusion was not
available to the AG.
Meta-analysis
In the absence of head-to-head clinical trials of avatrombopag and lusutrombopag, the indirect comparison
approach was used to assess the relative effect of these treatment interventions. On the basis of the
published trials, placebo was used as the common comparator. As the dose of avatrombopag varies by
platelet count, subgroup analyses were performed. Forest plots of each of the interventions compared
with placebo are presented in Appendix 4.

As shown in Tables 18 and 19, the outcome on the RR scale was a little more favourable towards
lusutrombopag in both outcomes that counted platelet transfusions prior to the elective procedure
in all cases regardless of therapies required prior to the procedure and regardless of the subgroups.
Only one statistically significant difference was identified between avatrombopag and lusutrombopag.

This was in a fixed-effect analysis of the ratio of patients who required no platelet transfusion prior to
elective procedure in the subgroup in which patients’ baseline platelet count was < 40,000/µl. It was in
favour of lusutrombopag (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.22). On the OR scale, there was no statistically
significant difference in any subgroup, although there was a reversal in the point estimate to an
advantage for avatrombopag in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup in terms of both outcomes.
By contrast, Table 20 shows an advantage of avatrombopag in terms of avoidance of rescue therapy, but,
again, this is not statistically significant except in the fixed-effect analysis in the < 40,000/µl subgroup.
On the OR scale, the value for the < 40,000/µl subgroup was not estimable and, as for the RR scale and
the other outcomes, there was an advantage for avatrombopag in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup.
Heterogeneity
There was clinical heterogeneity in terms of invasive procedures that patients were undergoing. In both
of the L-PLUS trials39,54 patients were not restricted to the elective procedure, whereas in the study by
Tateishi et al.53 only patients who were undergoing radiofrequency ablation were included. However,
sensitivity analysis by exclusion of this study increased the heterogeneity in all cases. In addition, there
was moderate statistical heterogeneity within each subgroup regardless of the outcome, for example
for no platelet transfusion prior to the elective procedure I
2 = 53% and 34% in the < 40,000/µl and
40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroups, respectively (see Appendix 4). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the
removal of one of the L-PLUS studies would remove this heterogeneity and reduce the I
2 to 0%. However,
the study that needed to be removed to reduce the heterogeneity depended on the subgroup. More
specifically, it was the L-PLUS 1 study39 in the < 40,000/µl subgroup and the L-PLUS 2 study54 in the
40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup. Most importantly, this did not make any substantial change to the results.
For no rescue therapy, there was no statistical heterogeneity in the L-PLUS trials,39,54 but there
was moderate heterogeneity in the < 40,000/µl subgroup. Nevertheless, given no obvious clinical
difference between the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 studies,37 the AG did not consider that exclusion
of either was warranted. As already discussed in Results, Subgroup analyses, the lusutrombopag trials
also appear to be quite different from the ADAPT trials in the much lower frequency of rescue
therapy, regardless of treatment arm. This highlights that caution needs to be exercised in comparing
avatrombopag with lusutrombopag.

Chapter 4 Assessment of cost-effectiveness
This chapter explores the cost-effectiveness of avatrombopag and lusutrombopag for treating
thrombocytopenia in people with CLD needing an elective procedure.
For this purpose, in Systematic review of existing cost-effectiveness evidence, the systematic review of
the existing cost-effectiveness, cost/resource use and HRQoL evidence is summarised. In Review of
the company evidence, the summary and critique of the industry submissions to NICE on the costeffectiveness of avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are provided. Finally, in Independent economic
assessment, the AG provides its own independent economic assessment on the cost-effectiveness of
avatrombopag and lusutrombopag.
Systematic review of existing cost-effectiveness evidence
Search methods
The literature searches described in Chapter 3, Methods for reviewing effectiveness, Identification of studies,
were used to identify cost-effectiveness studies. Identified cost-effectiveness studies were critically
assessed using a published critical appraisal checklist for economic evaluations.60
Additional searches were conducted to identify HRQoL and resource use data related to thrombocytopenia.
Methodological search filters designed to identify HRQoL and resource use data were combined with
search terms for thrombocytopenia. The search strategies were developed using the same methods
described in Chapter 3, Methods for reviewing effectiveness, Identification of studies. Searches were not
limited by language, publication status (i.e. unpublished or published) or date of publication.
Full details of the search strategies are presented in Appendix 1.
The following databases and resources were searched:
l MEDLINE (via Ovid) – 1946–week 3 2019
l MEDLINE In-Process Citations, Daily Update and Epub Ahead of Print (via Ovid) – 22 January 2019
l PubMed (via National Library of Medicine) – up to 24 January 2019

Supplementary searches were conducted to identify data to help populate the economic model:
l PubMed search for National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment
reports with similar economic models
l literature searches to identify rates of procedures with bleeding risk in patients with CLD
l literature searches to identify UK mortality data associated with platelet transfusion
l literature searches to identify platelet transfusion refractoriness studies
l literature searches to identify CLD/thrombocytopenia cost of illness studies.
Handling of citations
Identified references were downloaded into EndNote bibliographic management software for further
assessment and handling. Individual records in the EndNote library were tagged with searching
information, such as searcher, date searched, database host, database searched, strategy name and
iteration, and theme or search question. This enabled the information specialist to track the origin of
each individual database record and its progress through the screening and review process.
Quality assurance within the search process
For all searches undertaken by the KSR information team, the main EMBASE strategy was independently
peer reviewed by a second KSR information specialist. The search strategy peer review was informed by
items based on the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health checklist.11,12
Inclusion criteria
Table 21 presents an overview of the inclusion criteria used for the review.
Results
The cost-effectiveness search identified 3518 records. However, none of the identified records fulfilled
the inclusion criteria. The potentially relevant studies (n = 5) were economic evaluation studies in other
populations [e.g. interferon-based treatment-induced thrombocytopenia of patients with hepatitis C
virus (HCV)], and these were excluded after full-text screening.

The HRQoL search identified 2429 records. However, none of the identified records fulfilled the
inclusion criteria; all of these records were excluded during title/abstract screening.
The resource use/costs search identified 5358 records, from which seven studies fulfilled the inclusion
criteria. Three of these studies were available only as conference abstracts,29,61,62 whereas the other
four were available as full texts; these are summarised in Identified resource use/costs studies.
The PRISMA flow diagrams in Figure 2 depict the flow of the studies through the cost-effectiveness,
HRQoL and resource use/costs search processes.
Identified resource use/costs studies
The systematic review of resource use/costs identified four full-text articles63–66 and three conference
abstracts,29,61,62 discussing five separate studies. Two of the conference abstracts have since been published
as full-text publications (the Poordad 2007 abstract61 corresponds to the Poordad et al. 201263 article and
the Poordad et al. 2008 abstract62 is covered by the Poordad et al. 2011 article64), and, therefore, only the
full-text publications of these studies are discussed. For the remaining conference abstract, no full-text
publication was available and therefore only the content of the abstract is discussed.67
Barnett et al.65 conducted a study to estimate the cost of platelet transfusion for CLD patients with
thrombocytopenia undergoing elective procedures in the USA. The authors developed a conceptual
framework aiming to identify all direct, indirect and intangible costs of platelet transfusion. They then
estimated the costs using the developed framework and cost data from the literature. The framework
included the cost of generating the supply of platelets, the transfusion itself, the adverse events
associated with platelet transfusion and refractoriness. The total direct cost obtained from considering
all framework categories of platelet transfusion in CLD patients with thrombocytopenia scheduled to
undergo an elective procedure was estimated to be in the range of US$5258–13,117. The majority of
costs were attributable to the transfusion itself (US$3723–4436), followed by the cost of refractoriness
(which included the opportunity cost of a delayed procedure and subsequent transfusions with human
leucocyte antigen-matched platelets) (US$874–7578). A potential limitation of this study is that it is
literature based, drawing cost elements from different sources with different study designs. These
sources were not based on CLD patients with thrombocytopenia, as the authors could not identify
published sources on this population. Therefore, the estimate may not well reflect the target population
if differences exist in the costs of transfusion and the rates of related AEs and refractoriness in a
CLD thrombocytopenia population in the UK. It is also noted that this study was funded by Dova
Pharmaceuticals, the owner of avatrombopag.
Brown66 published a review article discussing the pharmacoeconomic analysis of thrombocytopenia
in CLD. The review discussed the negative impact that thrombocytopenia and its treatment can have
on costs and treatment outcomes in CLD. The impact of thrombocytopenia on patient outcomes was
discussed in terms of the increased likelihood of complications during routine medical procedures as
well as the cancellation, delay or prolongation of procedures, which can increase morbidity and mortality.
The negative patient outcomes that can arise from platelet transfusions, such as refractoriness, infection,
allergic reaction, iron overload and other transfusion reactions, were also outlined. The review also
discussed the economic burden of costs associated with platelet transfusion and resulting AEs that
can require further treatment and increased utilisation of health-care resources.
In a conference abstract, Poordad et al.29 conducted a case–control study examining the economic
burden of platelet transfusion in CLD patients with thrombocytopenia. A retrospective analysis was
conducted in a large national US administrative claims database to examine the impact of platelet
transfusion on health resource utilisation and expenditure, including hospitalisations, accident and
emergency (A&E) visits and outpatient visits among CLD patients with thrombocytopenia. Data from
2012 to 2015 were used to match adult CLD patients with thrombocytopenia who received a platelet
transfusion 1 : 2 based on age and sex with CLD patients with thrombocytopenia who did not receive a

platelet transfusion. Among the 1173 CLD patients with thrombocytopenia included in the analysis,
those with thrombocytopenia who received a platelet transfusion had a statistically significantly higher
probability of having an additional outpatient office visit (1.04; p = 0.021), a non-significantly higher
probability of hospitalisation (1.08; p = 0.174) and a significantly lower probability of an A&E visit
(0.86; p = 0.001) than those who did not receive a platelet transfusion. Platelet transfusions were
associated with significantly increased hospitalisation costs (US$25,802, 95% CI US$11,220 to US$40,660),
outpatient office costs (US$3367, 95% CI US$1082 to US$5652) and total costs (US$29,717, 95% CI
US$15,096 to US$44,339) and non-significantly decreased A&E costs (–US$371, 95% CI –US$1019 to
US$277) compared with no transfusion.
In Poordad et al.,
64 the aim was to examine medical resource utilisation and health-care costs in
HCV patients with and without thrombocytopenia from a longitudinal administrative claims database
using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), diagnosis
codes. The prevalence of thrombocytopenia in HCV patients identified was found to be 3.6%, and the
prevalence of thrombocytopenia in the subset of patients for whom platelet count laboratory results
were available was 10.8%. HCV patients diagnosed with thrombocytopenia had a higher incidence
of bleeding events (27.3% vs. 9.9%) and platelet transfusions (8.5% vs. < 1%). HCV patients diagnosed
with thrombocytopenia also had a higher incidence of liver disease-related ambulatory visits (10.4%
vs. 4.4%; OR 2.3, p < 0.001), emergency room visits (OR 8.6, p < 0.01) and inpatient hospital stays
(OR 17.7, p < 0.01) during the year before and the year after HCV diagnosis than HCV patients without
a thrombocytopenia diagnosis. HCV patients diagnosed with thrombocytopenia had significantly
higher overall health-care costs (US$37,924 vs. US$12,174; p < 0.001) and liver disease-related costs
(US$14,569 vs. US$4107; p < 0.001) than those without thrombocytopenia. Overall health-care and
liver disease-related costs in the subset of HCV patients with complete laboratory results also found
significantly higher costs among HCV patients diagnosed with thrombocytopenia than among those
without thrombocytopenia (overall health-care costs US$25,482 vs. US$16,412, p < 0.001; liver
disease-related costs US$23,608 vs. US$7354, p < 0.001). Where results are presented according to
the two different strategies for identifying thrombocytopenia (i.e. coding identification and laboratory
results), they differ quite substantially.
Poordad et al.63 estimated the prevalence of thrombocytopenia and evaluated medical resource use
and costs associated with thrombocytopenia in CLD patients. A retrospective study was performed
on a longitudinal administrative claims database that included 56,445 patients with an ICD-9-CM
diagnosis code for CLD in the period January 2001 to December 2003. For patients with available
laboratory results, including platelet counts (35.7%), the numbers of bleeding events or platelet
transfusions were also determined. The annual prevalence of thrombocytopenia among patients with
CLD ranged from 3.3% to 4.1%. In comparison with patients without a thrombocytopenia diagnosis,
the group of patients with a thrombocytopenia diagnosis included more males (62.6% vs. 49.4%) and
experienced more anaemia (54.2% vs. 18.5%), more neutropenia (20.8% vs. 1.7%), more liver cancer
(5.7% vs. 1.5%), more liver transplants (2.1% vs. < 1%) and more bleeding events (27.8% vs. 10.0%).
They also received more interferon therapy (5.9% vs. 2.0%) and more platelet transfusions (8.1% vs.
< 1%) and, on average, each one had more platelet count assessments (mean 3.68 vs. 2.47). Patients
with a thrombocytopenia diagnosis had 2.5 times more liver disease-related ambulatory visits, 3.9
times more liver disease-related emergency room visits and 12.9 times more liver disease-related
inpatient hospital stays than patients without a thrombocytopenia diagnosis. Overall medical care
costs were 3.5-fold higher in patients with a thrombocytopenia diagnosis, with liver disease-related
costs being 7-fold higher in patients with a thrombocytopenia diagnosis than in patients without a
thrombocytopenia diagnosis. Similar results were obtained for patients with a platelet count that
indicated thrombocytopenia.
In summary, the findings from the literature review that were presented above indicate that the
health-care costs of patients with CLD and thrombocytopenia are substantial. Most notably, the
costs of, and associated with, platelet transfusions make a relatively large contribution to those costs.

This emphasises the importance of evaluating how an alternative strategy through the (additional) use
of TPO-RAs compares with platelet transfusions as the current standard treatment for thrombocytopenia
in patients with CLD.
Review of the company evidence
Review of the avatrombopag submission
In the company submission by Dova, no cost-effectiveness analysis was presented, and no
cost-effectiveness model was provided by the company.68
Relevant details were provided for the costs of thrombocytopenia with references to studies that
were also identified by the AG (see Systematic review of existing cost-effectiveness evidence, Results).
These include the study by Brown66 on increased direct and indirect costs due to thrombocytopenia
and its associated complications, and the studies by Poordad et al.63,64 on costs of HCV patients with
thrombocytopenia compared with those without, and costs of CLD patients with thrombocytopenia
compared with those without (respectively). Subsequently, details were provided on the costs of platelet
transfusions. It was argued that the costs of platelet transfusions are high owing to a combination of
specific storage requirements, a short shelf life and the unpredictability of the demand for platelets, which
causes a high degree of wastage due to expiration issues.69,70 It was also noted that platelet transfusion
refractoriness (i.e. the repeated failure to achieve the desired level of blood platelets in a patient following
a platelet transfusion) generally occurs after multiple transfusions.71,72 Finally, an estimate of the costs of a
platelet transfusion was provided with reference to Barnett et al.,
65 which was also identified by the AG in
its literature review as outlined in Systematic review of existing cost-effectiveness evidence, Results.
Review of the lusutrombopag submission
The lusutrombopag submission included a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, which compared
lusutrombopag (once per day at a dose of 3 mg for 7 days) with no TPO-RA for CLD patients with
severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000/µl) who were scheduled to undergo an elective
invasive procedure. The efficacy data incorporated into the decision-tree model were based on the
results from the three controlled trials of lusutrombopag (L-PLUS 1, L-PLUS 2 and Phase 2b).55 In the
base-case analysis, the company pooled the results of the three trials. In a scenario analysis the model
efficacy data were based solely on the L-PLUS 2 international trial,54 excluding the other two studies,
both of which were undertaken in Japan.
The model combined a short-term decision tree (Figure 3), considering costs and QALYs over a 35-day
period (matching the trial time horizons), and a long-term Markov model, assessing QALYs and mortality
over a lifetime time horizon of 50 years. The short-term decision tree model had the following binary
(i.e. yes/no) chance nodes: receiving platelet transfusion (trial data), death following platelet transfusion
(literature), receiving elective invasive procedure within study period (trial data), death before rescheduled
procedure (literature), bleeding following invasive procedure (trial data), rescue therapy following bleeding
(trial data), death from bleeding for those not receiving rescue therapy (literature) and death from bleeding
for those receiving rescue therapy (literature).
In the short-term model, costs were attributed to any platelet transfusions, procedures and rescue
therapies given, drug acquisition and administration, and AE monitoring. One-off QALY decrements
were included for platelet transfusions, bleeding events, rescue therapies and AEs.
In the long-term Markov model, data from the literature regarding CLD-related mortality and utility
values were used to estimate the number of QALYs that would be accrued over the expected remaining
life of the patient with a cycle length of 1 year. QALYs in the long-term model are discounted at a rate
of 3.5%. No cost discounting was incorporated as costs were included only in the short-term model,
in which discounting was inappropriate.

Efficacy summary
Efficacy inputs in the model included the following for each treatment arm:
1. proportion of patients receiving a platelet transfusion prior to the elective invasive procedure
2. proportion of patients experiencing bleeding events following an elective invasive procedure
3. proportion of patients not receiving their elective invasive procedure during the trial period
(conditional on receipt of prior platelet transfusion)
4. proportion of patients receiving rescue therapy following bleeding (conditional on receipt of prior
platelet transfusion and receipt of elective invasive procedure).
For efficacy inputs 1 and 2, the proportion of patients achieving each outcome in the placebo/platelet
transfusion arm was taken directly from the placebo arm of the pooled lusutrombopag clinical trials
(or from L-PLUS 254 only in scenario analysis). For the lusutrombopag arm, ORs for lusutrombopag
compared with placebo were estimated from the pooled trials (or from L-PLUS 254 alone in scenario
analysis) and were applied to the placebo/platelet transfusion arm data. Inputs 3 and 4 were calculated
as conditional probabilities in the base-case analysis using individual patient-level data from the pooled
lusutrombopag trials. In a scenario analysis, these conditional probabilities could be turned off and
replaced with unconditional inputs calculated using ORs, as seen for inputs 1 and 2.
In the base-case analysis, the company assumed, contrary to evidence from the lusutrombopag trials, that
100% of patients in the placebo/platelet transfusion arm would receive a platelet transfusion prior to an
elective invasive procedure as a result of less intensive monitoring of platelet count prior to procedures
in clinical practice. This assumption was based on clinical expert opinion. In the trials (confidential
information has been removed) of placebo arm patients in the pooled trials and (confidential information
has been removed) in the L-PLUS 2 trial54 received a platelet transfusion prior to surgery.
Mortality in the short-term model could occur as a result of platelet transfusion or bleeding events. The
company identified two different sources for the probability of platelet transfusion-related mortality.
In the base-case analysis, the company adopted values from a study by van Eerd et al.,
73 in which the
base-case mortality risk associated with transfusion was estimated to be 0.3315%. The company also
identified an alternative source of mortality data, from a study by Vamvakas et al.,
74 that estimated an
incidence of transfusion-related death of 0.0004% from UK Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT).
In the base-case analysis, bleeding-related mortality was taken from a study by Takaki et al.,
75 which
estimated that the rate of death from either major or minor bleeding following radiofrequency ablation
(RFA) was 0.83%. Two alternative sources of estimates of bleeding-related mortality were included in
the model. Lo et al.76 estimated a mortality rate of 6% from upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and
oesophageal variceal bleeds (assumed to be a major bleed) and Triantos and Kalafateli77 estimated a
20% mortality rate from acute variceal bleeding (assumed major bleed).
Chronic liver disease-related mortality was incorporated into the long-term model to estimate lifetime
QALYs for those patients surviving the short-term model. In the base-case model, data were used from
a systematic review by D’Amico et al.,
78 with 1-year survival estimated at 84%.
The model included AEs relating to the treatment and to platelet transfusion. SAEs that were possibly or
probably related to the drug were included in the model. Thrombus-related AEs are particularly relevant
to TPO-Ras; therefore, any severe thrombus-related events in any of the three lusutrombopag trials79–81
(3 mg dose) were included in the model. In its submission, the company states that comprehensive data
for all platelet transfusion-specific AEs were not available. Therefore, data for platelet transfusion AEs
were taken from the van Eerd et al.73 study, which reports the incidence of AEs per unit of fresh-frozen
plasma transfused.73

Health-related quality-of-life summary
Health-related quality-of-life data were not collected in the trials. The base-case analysis adopted a
baseline utility value of 0.544 in both treatment groups, estimated for patients with CLD/cirrhosis.
This utility value is from a study by Sullivan et al.82 that provides EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) index
scores for a wide variety of chronic conditions based on UK community preferences (using US-based
panel survey data). One-off disutilities were included in the model for platelet transfusions, bleeding
events, rescue therapy and AEs. In the base-case analysis, a disutility of 0.1 for patients experiencing
serious platelet transfusion-related AEs was applied for one model cycle (4 weeks). This value was
taken from TA293,83 a previous NICE appraisal of eltrombopag for thrombocytopenic purpura. In
the base-case analysis, the company assumed the same disutility for rescue therapy as for platelet
transfusion, stating that clinical experts advised that platelet transfusion would be most common in
clinical practice.
Utilities summary
Disutilities for bleeds were also identified from the literature. The literature provided separate disutilities
for bleeds classified as major and those classified as minor. The company assumed that all bleeds were
major, stating that no studies were identified that reported the proportion of bleeds classified as major
or minor following an elective invasive procedure in this population, and that minor bleeds would be
expected to have a minor impact on costs and QALYs. Therefore, a disutility associated with a major
bleeding event of 0.397 for a duration of 1 week was adopted from Jugrin et al.84 For thrombus-related
AEs, the company incorporated a disutility of 0.029, applied over 1 week, estimated by Jugrin et al.84
for related thrombotic events (index deep-vein thrombosis and index pulmonary embolism).
The baseline utility value for CLD/cirrhosis patients adopted in the short-term model was also used
to calculate QALYs throughout the long-term model. Utility values were adjusted to incorporate the
natural decline in utility observed with ageing using the Ara and Wailoo85 equation to generate utility
multipliers by age and sex.
Costs summary
The drug acquisition cost of (confidential information has been removed) for 7 days of 3 mg of
lusutrombopag was included in the model. As lusutrombopag is an oral medication, no administration
costs were required. The base-case cost of platelet transfusion was based on the TA293 appraisal83
of eltrombopag. In the eltrombopag appraisal, this cost was assumed to comprise the cost of blood
transfusion (weighted average cost of £57.72 in 2011/12, code 821 blood transfusion) and the cost
of 2 units of platelets (2 × £230.393 in 2011/12), which resulted in a cost per transfusion of £517.28
in 2011/12. The company used expert opinion to inform the average number of units of platelets
that would be received per transfusion. The expert stated that most often platelet transfusions would
contain either 2 or 4 units and, therefore, it was assumed that an average of 3 units of platelets would
be received per transfusion. This resulted in a base-case cost of £812.61 (inflated to 2017/18), which
included both administration and platelet acquisition. Two alternative costs of platelet transfusion
were included in the model. One alternative was based on NHS Reference Costs 2017–1886 for single
plasma exchange or other intravenous blood transfusion. Here it was assumed that a single transfusion
was sufficient to transfuse the required number of units of platelets, which resulted in a cost per
transfusion of £517.28. The final option was based on a poster by Varney and Guest,87 which estimated
the cost per unit of adult platelet concentrate to be £347 in 2002/3, resulting in a cost per transfusion
of £1493.21 (inflated to 2017/18).
The costs associated with treating transfusion-related complications were based on the costs of
complications from fresh-frozen plasma transfusion, reported in van Eerd et al.73 The cost of managing
portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in lusutrombopag patients was assumed to be £958.95, based on NHS
Reference Costs 2017–1886 for percutaneous transluminal, embolectomy or thrombolysis, of blood
vessel, with a CC (complication) score of 0–4 in a day-case setting. The same cost of one platelet
transfusion was assumed for all rescue therapies.

All patients in both treatment arms were assumed to have received an elective invasive procedure
and to incur the relevant costs. Although the short-term model allowed for the possibility of delaying
the procedure beyond the 35-day cycle, all patients were assumed to receive their procedure at some
point. Base-case procedural costs were estimated using the pooled proportion of patients receiving each
procedure in the three trials and the relevant NHS Reference Costs 2017–1886 in the elective inpatient
setting. In the base-case analysis, the company included a sunk cost for cancelled or delayed procedures,
assuming that there may not be enough time to reallocate a pre-assigned clinician or hospital bed to
another patient procedure, thus wasting clinician time. A sunk cost of £566.05 for delayed elective
invasive procedures was included, which was based on a study based on an NHS reference cost that
the company had stated had been removed from subsequent years’ NHS reference costs.88
Critique
The AG generally agreed with the model structure and input values included. However, the AG
considered the model to have the following limitations:
l The model did not consider subgroups in terms of thrombocytopenia (a baseline platelet count of
either < 40,000/µl or 40,000–< 50,000/µl), which is relevant because different doses of avatrombopag
are required for each of these two subgroups.
l The model did not incorporate other available drugs such as avatrombopag.
l The AG could not trace back the numbers from the CSRs79–81 to understand from where the
probabilities for bleeding, conditional probability of surgery rescheduling and conditional
probabilities of receiving rescue therapy were derived.
l Considering the lack of a clear definition of the bleeding events used in the Shionogi economic
model, as well as the extremely small numbers and lack of difference between the World Health
Organization grade 2 bleeding rates between two groups from L-PLUS39,54 data (appendix c.5.3 of
the Shionogi submission),55,56 the AG was doubtful about using these conditional probabilities and
also doubtful about incorporating bleeding and rescue events as separate chance nodes of the
decision tree.
l The company assumed that 100% of the placebo arm would receive a platelet transfusion prior
to the elective invasive procedure in the base-case analysis. This is contrary to the evidence from
L-PLUS 1,39 L-PLUS 254 and the JapicCTI-121944 trial,53 in which 12.5%, 29% and 20%, respectively,
of placebo patients did not require platelet transfusion prior to the elective invasive procedure
(see Table 13).
l The company did not follow standard meta-analysis approaches while deriving the transition
probabilities in the economic model; instead the transition probabilities were obtained from simple
pooling of the data without being weighted.
l The model considered that the only mortality due to a surgery is the bleeding-associated mortality,
whereas there are other causes of death (such as infection).
l Platelet transfusion-related mortality can also occur after surgery.
l Two potential values were identified from the literature73,74 for platelet transfusion-related mortality.
Neither study was specific to CLD patients or to patients with thrombocytopenia. In addition, neither
study actually estimated the mortality associated with platelet transfusion, with one investigating
fresh-frozen plasma transfusion and the other investigating whole-blood transfusion. These studies
resulted in substantially different estimates of transfusion-related mortality of 0.33% and 0.0004%.
The choice to go with the higher value was justified as recommended by expert opinion.
l It was unclear why data regarding AEs experienced as a result of platelet transfusion during the trials
were not available to the company. AEs would have had to have been noted and monitored and
therefore data should have been available. Again, by using the van Eerd et al.73 study as a source
for input values, the model used values not specific to the population or to platelet transfusion.
l By assuming that all bleeds were major, the company may be overestimating the utility loss
resulting from bleeding events. The AG did not consider that stating that minor bleeds would be
expected to have a minor impact on costs and QALYs was a sufficient justification for assuming that
all bleeds were major.

l The company assumed an average of 3 units of platelets per transfusion. Data were not provided by
the company on the average number of units used per transfusion in the lusutrombopag trials. The
company stated in its clarification response that there is a lack of standardisation across countries
(and potentially even centres) regarding the size of a ‘unit’ in terms of what volume of platelets this
equates to or how this relates to definitions of units in UK clinical practice.56 Therefore, although
information on the number of units of platelets transfused was collected, the variation in reporting
led the company to question the data’s reliability and their relevance to UK definitions and practice.
The company therefore used expert opinion and the median number of units per transfusion from
the eltrombopag ELEVATE trial,56 both of which resulted in the expectation that an average of
3 units of platelets would be used per platelet transfusion. The AG understood this issue of
variation in the definition of ‘units’ of platelets, which was further supported through contact with
its own clinical expert. In response to clarification questions, both companies provided additional
information on the number of units of platelets transfused per platelet transfusion.56,57 However,
only the data provided by Shionogi came with accompanying information on the content of a
unit by providing the mean number of platelets per platelet transfusion. In the case of the data
provided by Dova Pharmaceuticals, it was not clear the number of platelets to which a unit would
correspond. Therefore, only the data from Shionogi on the mean number of platelets per platelet
transfusion could be translated into a mean number of adult therapeutic doses (ATDs) and were
used for the calculation of the costs of a platelet transfusion.
l The company included a sunk cost for delayed elective invasive procedures. It is considered unlikely
that, in the case of a procedure delay, a clinician could not find another useful way to fill this time.
The fact that this cost was removed from the NHS Reference Costs almost 10 years ago suggests
that this cost is no longer considered appropriate.
Independent economic assessment
The AG decided to adapt the model submitted by Shionogi owing to the limitations discussed in Review
of the company evidence.
Methods
Patient population
The patient population considered is CLD patients with severe thrombocytopenia (i.e. a platelet count
of < 50,000/µl) who are scheduled to undergo an elective invasive procedure.
The patient population is divided into two subgroups:
1. patients with a platelet count of < 40,000/µl
2. patients with a platelet count of 40,000–< 50,000/µl.
This immediate division of the population into platelet count subgroups is necessitated by the fact that
each of these subgroups receives a different dose of avatrombopag, as described below. Therefore, it is
not possible to conduct a direct comparison between lusutrombopag and avatrombopag without this
subgroup separation.
Interventions
Lusutrombopag is administered orally once per day at a dose of 3 mg for up to 7 days, with the first
dose taken a minimum of 9 days prior to the scheduled procedure.8
Avatrombopag for patients with a platelet count of < 40,000/µl is administered orally once per day at a

procedure and the regimen for 5 days (i.e. the procedure is scheduled 5–8 days after the last dose).

For patients with a platelet count of 40,000–< 50,000/µl, the administration and timing of avatrombopag
are the same, but the dose is reduced to 40 mg (two tablets of 20 mg).
Standard of care entails patients being given a platelet transfusion if their platelet count fails to reach
≥ 50,000/µl on the day of the scheduled procedure.
Model structure
The AG model is based on the structure for lusutrombopag submitted by Shionogi. Similar to that model,
the AG model combines a short-term decision tree considering costs and QALYs over a 35-day period
(matching the time horizon of all trials, as shown in Table 7), during which severely thrombocytopenic
CLD patients are scheduled to undergo an elective invasive procedure. Those patients alive at the end of
the short-term model enter the long-term Markov model, which assesses QALYs and mortality over a
lifetime time horizon of 50 years. The AG short-term decision tree model has the following chance nodes:
l receiving/not receiving platelet transfusion (taken from the avatrombopag and lusutrombopag trials)
l receiving/not receiving the elective invasive procedure within the 35-day study period
l rescue therapy/no rescue therapy (taken from avatrombopag and lusutrombopag trials)
l death/no death due to platelet transfusion, surgery or rescue therapy (taken from the literature).
The structure of the AG short-term decision tree model, shown in Figure 4, differs in several ways from
that of the original Shionogi model discussed in Review of the lusutrombopag submission. In the Shionogi
model, a chance node for death due to platelet transfusion was placed directly after the receipt of
transfusion before the chance node for undergoing an elective invasive procedure. In the AG model,
both mortality due to platelet transfusion prior to elective invasive procedure and mortality due to
surgical complications were considered after the chance nodes for undergoing surgery and requiring
rescue therapy.

The Shionogi model also allowed for the probability of delays to scheduled procedures and modelled
the potential impact of delays on quality of life and mortality and the additional costs that may be
incurred as a result of such delays. Additional costs resulting from surgery delays included a possible
additional platelet transfusion, as well as sunk costs resulting from last-minute delays leading to
wasted surgeon and surgical theatre time. The AG did not feel that the inclusion of a sunk cost was
necessary, as surgical theatre slots would usually be filled by other procedures and surgeons could
effectively fill their time with other tasks. In addition, the fact that Shionogi identified a sunk cost
unit cost from the NHS Reference Costs from 2009/10 but this was subsequently removed from the
reference costs suggests that it is no longer considered an appropriate cost to include in a model.
The Shionogi model also contained a chance node for death due to surgery delay. However, this
was assumed to carry a probability of 0 in the base-case analysis and was removed by the AG.
The Shionogi model structure contained a separate chance node for bleeding events and a subsequent
chance node for the requirement of rescue therapy. However, the AG had concerns regarding this
structure and the data it was based on. The AG was unable to trace back the numbers used to calculate
bleeding event efficacy to the lusutrombopag trials’ CSRs.79–81 On clarification request, the company
provided data on the number of bleeding events in each trial and treatment group.56,57 However, in
contrast to how it was implemented in the original Shionogi submission model, these numbers did not
suggest that lusutrombopag substantially reduced the odds of bleeding. In addition, these conditional
probabilities were not available for avatrombopag. The small number of World Health Organization grade
2 bleeding events and the rescue events seen in the trials led to concerns about the confidence that can
be placed in conditional probabilities based on such data. Therefore, the AG felt that bleeding events
were better modelled as a surgical complication rather than as a separate event. Therefore, bleeding
events and their impact on the mortality and quality of life of patients were modelled as a surgicalrelated AE and a source of mortality. The chance node for requiring rescue therapy was retained.
The long-term Markov model presented by Shionogi was utilised without changes in the AG model.
In the long-term model, data from the literature regarding CLD-related mortality and utility values
were used to estimate the number of QALYs that would accrue over the expected remaining life of
the patient with a cycle length of 1 year. QALYs in the long-term model were discounted at a rate of
3.5%. No cost discounting was incorporated as costs are included only in the short-term model, in
which discounting is inappropriate.
Assessment group input parameters
Baseline characteristics
The AG calculated pooled baseline characteristics from the three included lusutrombopag trials (L-PLUS 1,39
L-PLUS 254 and the Phase 2b trial79–81) and two avatrombopag trials (ADAPT-137 and ADAPT-237).
The overall average of each baseline characteristic was obtained from reported trial-specific means,
weighted proportionally to the trial population size. These baseline characteristics, including age, sex
and Child–Pugh category, are outlined in Table 22. As the AG could not find better UK-specific data for
the baseline characteristics of the thrombocytopenic CLD patients in the UK, these values were used
in deliberation with the clinical expert.

Based on the characteristics of patients in all of the trials pooled, mean patient age was 58.6 years
(SD 10.8 years), 62.7% of the patients were male and patients were categorised as Child–Pugh A,
B or C in proportions of 57.5%, 38.9% and 3.6%, respectively.
Efficacy
As lusutrombopag and avatrombopag were not directly compared in a head-to-head trial, indirect
comparisons had to be made. This was possible because both had been compared with placebo.
The methods of the data synthesis of the efficacy outcomes of interest for the short-term model
are described in Chapter 3, Methods for reviewing effectiveness, Methods of data synthesis, of this report
and the results are provided in Chapter 3, Results, Meta-analysis.
From the response to the clarification letters submitted by each company, the AG had data on the
number of patients in each treatment arm and platelet count subgroup who did not require:
l platelet transfusion prior to invasive procedure
l rescue therapy given that there was no platelet transfusion prior to invasive procedure.
From these data, for each outcome, an indirect treatment comparison was performed using Bayesian
meta-analysis methods to obtain estimates for the proportions/probabilities of each of the above
outcomes. First, the proportions for the placebo group (all trials pooled) were obtained for each platelet
count subgroup in a separate Bayesian meta-analysis. As the AG could not find better UK-specific data
for the natural history of the thrombocytopenic CLD patients in the UK, these values were used in
deliberation with the clinical expert. The recommendations from NICE DSU Technical Support Document 589
(Evidence Synthesis in the Baseline Natural History Model) were followed in this step. In line with the
recommendations, the predictive mean and the standard deviation of the log-odds from the randomeffects model were used to inform the baseline probabilities for the natural history (i.e. for no TPO-RA).
They were also combined in a Bayesian evidence synthesis model, with ORs estimated using a logit
function to calculate the corresponding probabilities (absolute risks) for avatrombopag and lusutrombopag.
Owing to the MCMC framework of the statistical software, such a Bayesian model ensures that the
generated probabilities for each of the TPO-RAs remain between 0 and 1 without additional programming.
This could not be guaranteed if an OR was estimated using the frequentist statistical method reported in
Chapter 3, Results, Meta-analysis, and applied to the baseline probability. In addition, ORs were not estimable
in the frequentist analysis for the proportion of patients in the < 40,000/µl subgroup who required no
rescue therapy; however, the Bayesian MCMC model was able to provide stable results for this subgroup.
Both fixed-effect and random-effects models were run in all cases. Random-effects models were used
in the base-case analysis because they provide a better statistical fit. (When assessing the statistical
fit of a model, the global deviance information criteria statistics and the posterior mean residual
deviance statistics are consulted. It is assumed that the model with lower values for these statistics
provide a better fit.) The suggestions for numerical stability, on a WinBUGS (MRC Biostatistics Unit,
Cambridge, UK) convergence error due to the presence of the zero cells in several trials, as outlined
in NICE DSU Technical Support Document 216 (section 6.3), were followed (e.g. using less vague priors
for the variance parameter or continuity correction by adding 0.5/1 to the numerator/denominator).
The WinBUGS code used in the Bayesian fixed-effect and random-effects analyses is provided in
Appendix 5. It should be noted that the base-case Bayesian model ORs were very similar to those
presented in Tables 18 and 19.
The first chance node in the model requires the probability or proportion of patients in each group
who require platelet transfusion prior to an elective invasive procedure. In the base-case analysis, the
proportion of patients in each treatment arm (for each subgroup) not requiring platelet transfusion
prior to an elective invasive procedure was estimated from the posterior distribution parameter
estimates of the Bayesian meta-analysis, derived from the baseline placebo proportions and the ORs

obtained from the random-effects model, using the number of patients who received platelet
transfusion before an elective invasive procedure, as provided in Table 23. These proportions were
then subtracted from 1 to provide the proportion of patients in each treatment arm who did not
require platelet transfusion prior to an elective invasive procedure.
For the second chance node, data on the proportion of elective invasive procedures not performed
during the trial period were provided in tables 11–13 of the L-PLUS 254 CSR,81 which stated that
(confidential information has been removed) and (confidential information has been removed) of
lusutrombopag and placebo patients, respectively, did not receive their planned procedure during the
trial period. L-PLUS 2 was the only trial that provided these data. Therefore, the lusutrombopag value
of (confidential information has been removed) was also assumed for avatrombopag, and the same
values were assumed for both platelet count subgroups. Patients were assumed to go on to receive
their procedure at some point in the near future. Therefore, these patients were assumed to be at risk
of receiving an additional platelet transfusion just before their postponed procedure, and they were
also assumed to be at risk of requiring rescue therapy or of death during the postponed procedure.
These risks of an additional platelet transfusion before the postponed procedure were assumed to
be identical to the risks for placebo patients whose procedures were not postponed. Although these
postponed procedures did not necessarily occur in the first cycle, the costs and impacts on mortality
and quality of life were assigned in the first cycle for simplicity.
Platelet transfusion
There is substantial uncertainty about the mean number of units of platelets in each platelet transfusion
patients received in the trials. This uncertainty is in large part caused by a lack of standardisation
in terminology and definitions used across countries and centres regarding the size of a ‘unit’ in
terms of number of platelets. When Shionogi56 provided, on request, data on the number of platelets
transfused per platelet transfusion, the company pointed out that it became apparent during analysis
that, although all trial centres collect this information, definitions and terms vary among trial centres.
There was no way to standardise this or to understand how these varying definitions related to UK
clinical and unit costs. Therefore, the company felt that it had no better solution than to use expert
clinical opinion. The experts approached by Shionogi55 stated that patients would receive either 2 or
4 units and, therefore, an average of 3 units per transfusion was assumed. This assumption was used in
the estimation of the safety and cost of platelet transfusion, with platelet transfusion AE incidents and
unit costs multiplied by 3 in both cases. Given the importance of the cost of platelet transfusion in the
model, the AG sought to validate this assumption of 3 further units.
First, the AG consulted its own clinical expert (S Ryder, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences,
Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, 2019, personal communication). When asked how many units of
platelets he would expect to be used per platelet transfusion, the clinician stated that he was unfamiliar
with the definition/term ‘unit’ in the context of platelets, as in his experience they were referred to
as ‘pools’. He was not aware of the number of platelets in a pool but stated that one pool was usually
sufficient to increase platelet levels by the required amount. This increased the concern within the AG
about the lack of consistency in the number of platelets usually transfused in a platelet transfusion.
The AG then turned to the literature to investigate UK platelet transfusion practice. The Handbook
of Transfusion Medicine,
90 produced in conjunction with the Joint UK Blood Transfusion and Tissue
Transplantation Services Professional Advisory Committee and NHS Blood and Transplant, provides
some useful information about UK practice. This publication states that an adult therapeutic dose
(ATD) of platelets could comprise either a pool of four units of platelets derived from whole blood
or a single-donor apheresis unit. The handbook also notes that UK blood services aim to provide
> 80% of platelet doses by apheresis to reduce patients’ exposure to multiple donors (a measure
taken to reduce the risk of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease). Therefore, the AG assumed that,
in UK practice, patients would receive platelets by apheresis.
ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS

48

An ATD is described in the publication as containing > 240,000/µl platelets per transfusion, whereas the
mean number of platelets in a unit of platelets donated by apheresis is 280,000 (range 165,000–510,000).90
Although Shionogi had been unable to supply data on the mean number of units of platelets transfused per
platelet transfusion, it was able to supply estimates of the mean number of platelets (i.e. platelet content
per transfusion) transfused across the lusutrombopag trials for each treatment group and platelet subgroup
both prior to surgery and as a rescue therapy. These estimates of mean number of platelets per transfusion
ranged from (confidential information has been removed) to (confidential information has been removed).56
This suggests an estimate of (confidential information has been removed) ATDs per transfusion. The NICE
blood transfusion guideline4 states that clinicians should not routinely transfuse more than a single dose of
platelets per transfusion, suggesting that one ATD may be sufficient per transfusion.
Dova did provide data on the mean number of units transfused per platelet transfusion for each
platelet subgroup and treatment group prior to an elective invasive procedure in the ADAPT trials.37
However, these means, ranging from 3.9 to 7.5, did not correspond well with the aforementioned
expectations of UK clinical practice definitions, and no information was provided on the assumed
platelet content within a unit. Therefore, these data were not used in the calculation of the costs of a
platelet transfusion.
Therefore, in calculating the mean number of ATDs included in each platelet transfusion prior to
surgery, the AG utilised the data provided by Shionogi56 detailing that the mean number of platelets
transfused per transfusion divided by the mean number of platelets in a unit of platelets donated by
apheresis, which is 280,000/µl according to the Handbook of Transfusion Medicine.
90 This provided
an estimate of the number of ATDs per transfusion (as the handbook also stated that an ATD was
equivalent to a single-donor apheresis unit). This calculation resulted in mean numbers of ATDs for
lusutrombopag and no TPO-RA patients in each platelet count subgroup, both prior to surgery and as
a rescue therapy, as shown in Table 24. No clear pattern was seen in these data to suggest to the AG
that the content of platelet transfusions varied substantially according to treatment group, subgroup or
reason for transfusion. Therefore, the AG assumed a pooled estimate of (confidential information has been
removed) ATDs per transfusion across all transfusions given in the model. This figure corresponds well
with recommendations from clinical expert opinion and the NICE blood transfusion guideline4 that a
single ATD should be sufficient per platelet transfusion. This assumed number of ATDs per transfusion
will be tested in a scenario analysis.

In the following paragraph, more detail is provided for each of these sources of mortality.
In the Shionogi submission, the probability of death due to platelet transfusion was based on the
Vamvakas and Blajchman study.74 This study estimated the number of deaths due to allogenic blood
transfusions using the SHOT data from 1996 to 2004. There were 167 transfusion-related deaths during
this period, resulting in an incidence of 0.00035%.74 The alternative value for platelet transfusion-related
mortality provided in the Shionogi submission of 0.3315% was obtained from a study by van Eerd et al.,
73
which in turn cites the incidence of complications due to fresh-frozen plasma transfusion and associated
mortality in critically ill patients on an intensive care unit.91 This value was considered inappropriate by
the AG as it is approximately 1000 times higher than the value obtained by the SHOT data. The AG felt
that this high estimate was probably a result of the critical health status of participants in the Gajic et al.
study91 (all of whom were admitted to an intensive care unit), which does not match this trial population
and would probably lead to an overestimation of the mortality rate among our population.
The AG decided to use neither of these mortality rates, the second being unrealistically high for the
current population and the first being outdated. The Vamvakas and Blajchman study74 used SHOT
data from 1996 to 2004, so the AG decided to also use SHOT data, but from 2012 to 2017 instead
(see Table 29).92–96 As a first step, the probability of an early transfusion reaction was determined
(the transfusion-transmitted infections, which manifest later, do not lead to mortality). FAHR (febrile,
allergic, hypotensive reactions) and pulmonary complications (transfusion-related acute lung injury,
transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-associated dyspnoea) were selected as
relevant. Probabilities were obtained using the following steps:
1. The numbers of reactions per year from 2012 to 2017 were taken and added up. They were
split up into FAHR and pulmonary complications (transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusionassociated circulatory overload, transfusion-associated dyspnoea). FAHR were reported for platelets
specifically; unspecified reactions were not included. Pulmonary reactions were reported over all
components issued.
2. Overall numbers were divided by the total number of platelet units issued (FAHR) or the total
number of blood components issued (pulmonary complications) to get the probability of the reaction
per component issued.
3. These probabilities were divided by the average survey participation to correct for this.
The resulting probability of FAHR was 0.0288% and of pulmonary reactions was 0.00395% per transfusion.
The probability of death from a transfusion reaction was estimated using the number of deaths reported
in the early transfusion reactions by SHOT UK. FAHR resulted in no mortality over 2012–17, so mortality
was based on deaths from pulmonary complications. The probability of dying from an early transfusion
reaction was estimated using the following steps:
1. Take the number of deaths from pulmonary reactions over 2012–17 and divide it by the total number
of pulmonary reactions to get mortality rate from pulmonary reactions.
2. Calculate the proportion of pulmonary reactions in early transfusion reactions and multiply by
the mortality rate from pulmonary reactions to get the probability for death from an early
transfusion reaction.
This yielded a mortality probability, given a transfusion reaction, of 1.4%. By combining this with the
probability of a transfusion reaction, we find an overall mortality rate due to platelet transfusion of
0.0004592% (see Table 29).
There have been arguments in the literature that hemovigilance systems under-report transfusionrelated morbidity and mortality.97 Therefore, in scenario analyses, under-reporting factors were
included for transfusion-related mortality to adjust the base-case estimate of 0.0004592%.

As the rescue therapies given in the trials often took the form of additional platelet transfusions, the
estimate of platelet transfusion-related mortality was also applied to those receiving rescue therapy.
The mortality associated with platelet transfusion is reapplied each time patients receive a transfusion
in the model.
The probability of surgical-related mortality in this population was estimated from the trial mortality
data. As suggested in NICE DSU Technical Support Document 5,
89 a binomial likelihood model was used
to estimate the baseline mortality risk using a random-effects model with the predictive distribution
(see Appendix 5 for the statistical code used). The mortality figures from the five studies are used,
which report mixed types of elective procedures, and the mortality risk from the predictive distribution,
which resulted in the pooled risk of 0.0195 (95% CI 0.0004 to 0.13), was used in the base-case analysis
(Table 25). As this was a scenario analysis, the mortality risk from the posterior distribution, which
resulted in the pooled risk of 0.006955 (95% CI 0.0004 to 0.019), was used (see Table 29). This risk
was incorporated into the model for patients in both platelet count subgroups who received their
planned surgery.
Chronic liver disease-related mortality was incorporated into the long-term model to allow estimation
of lifetime QALYs for those patients surviving the short-term model in the same way as in the Shionogi
submission.55 In the base-case analysis, data were used from a systematic review by D’Amico et al.,
78
in which survival at 1 and 2 years for each Child–Pugh grade was used to estimate an extrapolated
survival curve, weighted based on the proportions of patients with each Child–Pugh grade. An alternative
data source was also investigated by Shionogi using data from UK Medicines Information (UKMi), for
which linear interpolation was used to estimate survival per year based on reported survival at 1, 5 and
10 years for each Child–Pugh category, with survival again weighted according to the proportions of
patients with each Child–Pugh score.98 The D’Amico et al.78 estimate was chosen for the base-case
analysis as Shionogi’s clinical experts considered the UKMi estimates too low, with 1-year survival
estimated at 84%. The AG concurred with this assessment.
Safety
Adverse events due to treatment, platelet transfusion and surgery were included in the model (Table 26).
In the company submission,55 Shionogi stated that comprehensive data for all platelet transfusion-specific
AEs were not available. In the AG model, estimates for the probability of experiencing transfusion-related
AEs were taken from the SHOT reports 2012–17.92–96 Earlier, the probabilities of FAHR and pulmonary
reactions were presented, at 0.0288% and 0.00395% per transfusion, respectively. However, not all
FAHR events are major. SHOT92–96 data show that only 25.6% of all FAHR responses are major, thus
inducing an effect on costs and quality of life. Furthermore, the transfusion-transmitted infections

were extracted from the SHOT reports,92–96 yielding some very small probabilities of bacterial infections,
hepatitis A, B and E virus infection and parvovirus infection. The incidences of the remaining transfusionrelated AEs were multiplied by the assumed number of ATDs per transfusion [(confidential information
has been removed) units, calculated by the AG; the details are explained in Platelet transfusion]. Patients
were assumed to be at equal risk of experiencing a transfusion-related AE each time they underwent a
platelet transfusion, with the risk repeated in the model.
All SAEs that were experienced by at least 1% of the patients in any treatment arm of any of the
randomised lusutrombopag and avatrombopag trials can be found in Appendix 3, Table 36. A large
number of AEs is expected given the severity of the underlying condition. The only AE in Table 36
that was experienced by > 5% of patients in any treatment arm was transfusion reaction, which was
assumed to be accounted for in the transfusion-related AE data outlined above. Thrombus-related
AEs have been judged particularly relevant to TPO-RAs.55 Therefore, any severe thrombus-related
events possibly or probably related to treatment were included in the model. Cases of PVT that
were judged to be severe, possibly or probably related, thrombus-related treatment-emergent AEs
were seen across the trials. Given the severity and probable relationship with the drugs, PVT AEs were
included in the model. The incidence of PVT in each treatment arm (for each subgroup) was estimated
from the posterior distribution parameter estimates of the WinBUGS code derived from the baseline
placebo proportions and the ORs obtained from the random-effects model.
Bleeding events of ≥ grade 2 were incorporated into the model as surgical adverse events. Bleeding
data were provided by both companies in their clarification responses, clarifying the number of bleeds
according to severity in each treatment arm of each trial for each platelet subgroup. The AG interpreted
the moderate/severe bleeding categorisations provided by the companies as in line with the bleeding
severity scale used by Shionogi.55,56 Again, the incidence of bleeding in each treatment arm (for each
subgroup) was estimated from the posterior distribution parameter estimates of the WinBUGS code
derived from the baseline placebo proportions and the ORs obtained from the random-effects model.
It is assumed that around 30% of bleeding events at ≥ grade 2 were ≥ grade 3, because 6 out of 20
bleeding events of ≥ grade 2 were grade 3.
Utilities
Health-related quality-of-life data were not collected in any of the lusutrombopag or avatrombopag
trials. As in the Shionogi submission, the base-case analysis adopts a baseline EuroQol-5 Dimensions,
three-level version (EQ-5D-3L), utility value in both treatment groups, as estimated for patients with
CLD/cirrhosis in a study by Sullivan et al.82 An alternative EQ-5D-3L utility value was incorporated
into the Shionogi model based on a study by Scalone et al.,
99 which compared the performances of
the EQ-5D-3L and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version (EQ-5D-5L), in patients with chronic
hepatic diseases. This was considered in the scenario analysis.99
One-off disutilities were included in the model for platelet transfusions, not receiving a planned
procedure, bleeding events, rescue therapy and AEs (Table 27). In the base-case analysis, a disutility of
0.1 for patients experiencing serious platelet transfusion-related AEs was applied for one model cycle
(4 weeks). This value, included in the Shionogi model, was taken from TA293,83 a previous NICE appraisal
of eltrombopag for thrombocytopenic purpura. An alternative disutility for platelet transfusion of 0.17
was available from van Eerd et al.73 However, the company selected the disutility of 0.1 for the base-case
analysis as it had been previously accepted by the committee in NICE TA29383 and TA221100 and
was more conservative than the alternative value available. The AG concurred with this decision.
An incidence of serious transfusion-related reactions of 0.0114% was assumed based on the sum of
all reactions listed in Table 30. The disutility of 0.1 for a duration of 4 weeks was multiplied by the
incidence of 0.0114%, which equated to a total QALY decrement of 0.000000876. This QALY decrement
was multiplied by the number of times in the model that a patient received a platelet transfusion.

The AG felt that the delay of an elective invasive procedure outside the first cycle would have an
impact on patients’ HRQoL. No established value could be found from the literature for the disutility
associated with surgery delay or cancellation. Therefore, the AG assumed that, although the impact on
the HRQoL of patients could be seen in a number of domains of the EQ-5D, it was most likely that
lengthy delays would increase patients’ worry about their surgery and condition, and therefore would
increase patients’ anxiety/depression. Therefore, the AG investigated the decrements associated with
anxiety and depression in the UK EQ-5D-5L value set.101 The average decrement for a one-level
increase in anxiety and depression was 0.072 (note that the average decrement for a one-level

reduction in any item is 0.064). The AG felt that this value was reasonable as an expected impact of
surgery delay on patients’ HRQoL. In the base-case analysis this value was applied for 4 weeks. This
duration was assumed as it approximated the cycle length and therefore accounted for the fact that
patients would not receive the surgery in this cycle but would receive it one cycle later. These values
will be adjusted in Scenario analysis results.
In its response to clarification, the company clarified that, in L-PLUS 2,54 rescue therapies included
platelet transfusion, other blood product transfusion and volume expanders, whereas in the remaining
two trials (L-PLUS 139 and the Phase 2b trial), platelet transfusion was the only permitted rescue therapy
(despite this, one patient in the lusutrombopag group of L-PLUS 2 received thrombin, and one patient
in the placebo group received thrombin and red blood cells, in addition to platelet transfusion as rescue
therapies).56 In the ADAPT trials,37 rescue therapies included platelet transfusion, fresh-frozen plasma
transfusion, adrenaline injections and tranexamic acid. In the model submitted by Shionogi, the disutility
set for rescue therapy was equal to that of platelet transfusion, following on from the argument that
rescue therapy would be most likely to take the form of platelet transfusion. Although the AG does
not agree with this assumption, especially given the range of rescue therapies seen in the trial, the
disutility of 0.1 was felt to be reasonable to cover the disutility of rescue therapy in general, and this
value was applied.
Disutilities for bleeding events and thrombotic events were also identified from the literature by
Shionogi. Disutilities of 0.397 for major bleeding events and of 0.122 for clinically relevant non-major
bleeding events were identified from Jugrin et al.84 The AG base-case model included only bleeding
AEs of ≥ grade 3, which were assumed to be equivalent to major bleeding events. Therefore, the
disutility of 0.397 for major bleeds was incorporated into the model base case, with a duration of
1 week. When grade 2 bleeding events were included in the model in scenario analysis, the disutility
of 0.122 for clinically relevant non-major bleeding events was applied to these events for a duration of
1 week. For thrombus-related AEs the company incorporates a disutility of 0.029, applied over 1 week,
estimated by Jugrin et al.84 for related thrombotic events (index deep-vein thrombosis and index
pulmonary embolism).
The baseline utility value for CLD/cirrhosis patients adopted in the short-term model was also used
to calculate QALYs throughout the long-term model. Utility values were adjusted to incorporate the
natural decline in utility observed with ageing using the Ara and Wailoo85 equation to generate utility
multipliers by age and sex.
Costs
Costs were attributed to any platelet transfusions, procedures and rescue therapies given, drug
acquisition and administration and AE monitoring (Table 28).
Drug acquisition costs The cost of a 7-day course of lusutrombopag is (confidential information has
been removed). Although not all patients in the trials received the full 7-day treatment course [L-PLUS 1,39
10/96 (10.4%); L-PLUS 2,54 45/215 (20.9%)], the European Medicines Agency recommends that
lusutrombopag be administered for 7 days.8 In addition, in real-world practice it is likely that the full
7-day course would be dispensed and so remaining tablets would be wasted. Therefore, the full cost of
7 days was included in the model.
Avatrombopag is administered orally once per day. For patients with a platelet count of < 40,000/µl the
daily dose is 60 mg (three tablets of 20 mg), with the first dose administered 10–13 days prior to the
scheduled procedure and treatment continuing for 5 days (i.e. the procedure is scheduled 5–8 days after
the last dose). For patients with a platelet count between ≥ 40,000/µl and < 50,000/µl the administration
and timing thereof are the same, but the dose is reduced to 40 mg (two tablets of 20 mg). No price has
yet been provided for avatrombopag. Wastage will again be taken into account, with full pack costs charged.
As both treatments are provided as tablets to be taken orally, no administration costs are required.

Platelet transfusion costs The estimated costs of a platelet transfusion consist of (1) the costs of the
platelets and (2) the costs of the administration of the platelets. This estimate is multiplied by the
number of platelet transfusions a patient receives prior to the elective invasive procedure, which was
calculated from the data provided in response to the clarification letter for each treatment arm for
each subgroup.
For the costs of platelets, the cost price for one ATD of apheresis-derived platelets was sourced from
the NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) Pricing Proposals 2017/18.105 This was multiplied by the
estimate of (confidential information has been removed) ATDs per transfusion (see Platelet transfusion),
which led to a cost of £244.15 per transfusion.
The costs of the administration of the platelets were sourced from Stokes et al.,
102 who provided separate
cost estimates for the first unit administered and for subsequent units administered. The costs of
administration were inflated from 2014/15 to 2017/18 using the Hospital & Community Health Services
indices provided by Curtis and Burns.106 This led to a transfusion cost estimate of £68.96.
In the Shionogi submission, the base-case cost of platelet transfusion was based on the TA29383
appraisal of eltrombopag. In the eltrombopag appraisal this was assumed to comprise the cost of a
blood transfusion (weighted average cost of £57.72 in 2011/12, code 821 blood transfusion) and the
cost of 2 units of platelets (2 × £230.393 in 2011/12). The company used expert opinion to inform the
average number of units of platelets that would be received per transfusion. The expert stated that

most often platelet transfusions would contain either 2 or 4 units and, therefore, it was assumed that
an average of 3 units of platelets would be received per transfusion. This resulted in a base-case cost
of £812.61 (inflated to 2017/18), which included both administration and platelet acquisition.
This assumption will be tested in scenario analysis.
Cost of the elective invasive procedures The AG estimated a weighted cost of procedures conducted
across all the trials, calculated using NHS Reference Costs86 in the elective inpatient setting. The procedurespecific cost estimates and their frequency are provided in Table 32. This cost was incorporated into the
AG model for all treatment arms for all patients, as they were all assumed to receive their planned
procedure at some point in time.
Rescue procedure costs In the Shionogi model, it was assumed that, in clinical practice, rescue therapy
would be an additional platelet transfusion. The AG noted that this assumption was not matched by
the data presented by the companies, which showed that other methods of rescue were also used by
clinicians. However, in the face of uncertainty surrounding what would actually be given in UK practice,
the AG cost of platelet transfusion of £313.83 was used in the base-case analysis.
The AG clinical expert stated that he would consider giving a combination of platelet transfusion,
clotting factors and tranexamic acid. An alternative value for scenario analysis was calculated by
the AG based on this assumed combination. For platelet transfusions given as rescue procedures, a
dosage of one ATD of platelets was costed using the NHSBT Pricing Proposals 2017/18,105 including
administration costs sourced from Stokes et al.102 For clotting factors, recombinant thrombin was
costed using a price (US$104 in 2009) from Plesca,107 which was converted using purchasing power
parities, and inflated from 2009/10 to 2017/18 using the Hospital & Community Health Services
indices from Curtis and Burns.106,108 A dose of 5000 units was assumed (i.e. 5 ml of 1000 units per ml).
For tranexamic acid, a dosage of 2 g was assumed based on CRASH-2 (Clinical Randomisation of
an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage-2)109 and costed using the July 2019 NHS reference
price sourced from the eMIT database.110 The sum of these costs yielded an alternative unit rescue
procedure cost estimate of £370.73. This unit cost is multiplied by the number of platelet transfusions
required per rescue therapy for each treatment arm in each subgroup, calculated from the pooled
estimates from the trials. The remaining alternative value was based on the Shionogi base-case
cost of platelet transfusion of £812.61.
Transfusion-related AE costs Costs associated with treating transfusion-related AEs were taken
from the report by Whiting et al.104 and inflated from 2013 to 2019 (see Table 32). These costs were
multiplied by the incidences of transfusion-related reactions estimated from the SHOT data.92–96
This resulted in an estimated cost of treating transfusion-related reactions of £0.22 per transfusion.
This was added to the cost of platelet transfusion, creating a base-case total cost of platelet transfusion
of £313.83.
In the AG model the proportion of each treatment group experiencing PVT was found for each
subgroup. This was multiplied by the unit price of £958.95 based on the NHS reference code YR23B:
Percutaneous Transluminal, Embolectomy or Thrombolysis, of Blood Vessel, with CC Score 0–4 in the
day-case setting.86 This provided a treatment group-specific expected cost of treating PVT.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analyses
Given the parametric uncertainty surrounding the input parameters utilised in the model, probabilistic
sensitivity analysis, consisting of 2000 iterations, was run to test parameter uncertainty in the model.
All parameters except drug prices, drug doses and discount rates were included in the probabilistic
sensitivity analysis (see Appendix 6). As is standard practice, appropriate distributions were fitted to
included parameters. Beta distributions were used for probabilities, proportions, risks and utilities,
gamma distributions were used for costs, beta tree was used for Child–Pugh categories and normal
distributions were used for age and the number of ATDs per transfusion. Where SEs were unknown,

they were estimated as 20% of the mean value. For efficacy parameters obtained from WinBUGS,
probabilistic values were drawn from CODA (convergence diagnostic and output analysis) output.

Scenarios explained
1. Drug prices.
Given that the AG does not have a price for avatrombopag (with the base-case analysis assuming the
same price as lusutrombopag for both doses of avatrombopag), some scenarios around drug pricing
were thought to be of value. In this scenario analysis, the price of avatrombopag was lowered.
2. Number of ATDs per platelet transfusion.
Given the substantial uncertainty surrounding the number of units/ATDs transfused in each
platelet transfusion, which has already been explained in this chapter, the AG felt that it was
important to examine the impact of different assumptions of number of units/ATDs on the results.
The calculation of the AG base-case assumption of each platelet transfusion containing (confidential
information has been removed) ATDs was explained in the Platelet transfusion section of Methods.
This value was used to calculate the cost of each platelet transfusion, as well as the cost of expected
platelet transfusion AEs, by multiplying the unit cost of platelets and the incidence of AEs per unit of
platelets by the number of ATDs. In the Shionogi model, clinical expert opinion led to the assumption
of an average of 3 units of platelets transfused per platelet transfusion. The AG included this as
an upper bound scenario, although given that the base-case unit cost of platelets identified from
the NHSBT pricing proposals105 is per ATD, the AG notes that a 3-unit assumption will probably
overestimate the costs of platelet transfusion. Scenarios of one and two ATDs per transfusion will
also be included to provide a range of estimates and to investigate the impact on the model results.
3. Cost of platelet transfusion.
In the AG base-case analysis, the cost of platelet transfusion is calculated from Stokes et al.,
111
whereas the unit cost of an ATD of platelets (obtained from apheresis) is taken from the NHSBT
pricing proposals.105 The cost of treating transfusion-related reactions was estimated at £0.22 per
transfusion, using costs from Whiting et al.104 and incidences from the SHOT data.92–96 This resulted
in a cost per platelet transfusion of £313.83. Two alternative sources of costs were taken from the
Shionogi model.
ASSESSMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
60

The first scenario will use the Shionogi base-case cost of platelet transfusion. This estimate was
obtained from the TA293 appraisal, which estimated a cost of blood transfusion from code 821,
blood transfusion, of £57.72 in 2011/12 and a cost per unit of platelets of £230.393 in 2011/12.
The company used expert opinion to obtain the average number of units of platelets that would
be received per transfusion. The expert stated that most often platelet transfusions would contain
either 2 or 4 units and, therefore, it was assumed that an average of 3 units of platelets would be
received per transfusion. This resulted in a cost of £812.61 (inflated to 2017/18), which will be
tested in this scenario.
The second scenario provided by Shionogi used the Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) codes for
single plasma exchange or other intravenous blood transfusion for day-case and elective inpatient
transfusions. These were weighted by the proportions of transfusions that have been conducted as
day-case and elective inpatient cases, resulting in a weighted cost of £517.28.
4. Cost of rescue therapy.
In the Shionogi model, it was assumed that, in clinical practice, rescue therapy would be an additional
platelet transfusion. The AG noted that this assumption was not matched by the data presented by
the companies, which showed that other methods of rescue were also used by clinicians. However,
in the face of uncertainty surrounding what would actually be given in UK practice, the AG cost of
platelet transfusion of £313.83 was used in the base-case analysis. The AG clinical expert stated that
he would consider giving a combination of platelet transfusion, clotting factors and tranexamic acid.
The cost of this combination was used as an alternative, with a value of £370.73. The remaining
alternative value was based on the Shionogi base-case cost of platelet transfusion of £812.61.
5. Inclusion of grade 2 bleeding AEs.
The AG base-case analysis includes only bleeding events of ≥ grade 3 (severe). In the scenario
analysis, grade 2 (moderate) bleeding events are also included, with a disutility for clinically
relevant, non-major bleeding events attached.
6. Probability of requiring platelet transfusion prior to surgery, estimated from international trials only.
In the AG base-case analysis the probability of requiring platelet transfusion was calculated from
all pooled trials. To investigate whether or not there is a difference in efficacy between the two
trials conducted in Japan only and the international trials, the probability of requiring platelet
transfusion will be estimated from only international trials in this scenario. This scenario would
have also been relevant for the following probabilities: grade 3 bleeding events and rescue therapy
required. However, the numbers of events in these cases were too small to generate reliable
results from only the international trials. Therefore, only the probability of requiring platelet
transfusion prior to surgery was adjusted.
7. Efficacy parameters obtained from fixed-effects meta-analysis model.
In the base-case analysis, the efficacy input parameters (i.e. proportion of patients receiving no
platelet transfusion and proportion of patients who did not require a request therapy) were
obtained from random-effects meta-analysis models. In this scenario analysis, the impact of using
efficacy parameters from fixed-effects models will be elaborated.
8. Literature source for long-term Child–Pugh grade-specific mortality.
In the base-case analysis, long-term CLD mortality was estimated using data from a systematic
review by D’Amico et al.,
78 which used survival at 1 and 2 years for each Child–Pugh grade to
estimate an extrapolated survival curve. This was weighted based on the proportions of patients
with each Child–Pugh grade, pooled from all trials.
For the scenario analysis, the alternative data source identified by Shionogi using data from the
UKMi98 to estimate survival, again using the Child–Pugh categories pooled from the trials, was utilised.
9. Under-reporting factor for SHOT data platelet transfusion-specific mortality.
In the AG base-case analysis, platelet transfusion-related mortality was estimated by the AG from
SHOT data from 2012 to 2017. There have been concerns in the literature that the SHOT data
under-report deaths due to transfusion-related acute lung injury.97 Therefore, the AG included
an under-reporting factor relating to this parameter in the model. In the base-case analysis, the
estimate from the SHOT data was unadjusted. However, in the scenario analysis, this value was
multiplied by 2, 5 and 10 to investigate the impact on the model results.

10. Alternative literature source for surgery-related mortality.
The probability of surgical-related mortality was estimated from the trial mortality data. In the
base-case analysis, a binomial likelihood model was used to estimate the baseline mortality risk
using a random-effects model with the predictive distribution, which resulted in pooled risk
of 0.0195 (95% CI 0.0004 to 0.13). As this was a scenario analysis, the mortality risk from the
posterior distribution was used, which resulted in pooled risk of 0.006955 (95% CI 0.0004 to 0.019).
11. Alternative literature source for baseline CLD utility.
In the base-case analysis, a baseline EQ-5D-3L utility value estimated for patients with CLD/
cirrhosis was adopted from a study by Sullivan et al.82 In its original model, Shionogi provided an
alternative baseline utility value from a study by Scalone et al.,
99 which was used as the scenario
analysis value.
12. Alternative literature source for bleeding disutility.
The AG could not find any alternative literature sources for the disutility of a major bleed.
Therefore, the base-case value was increased and decreased by 25%.
13. Alternative literature source for PVT disutility.
The AG could not find any alternative literature sources for the disutility of PVT. Therefore, the
base-case value was increased and decreased by 25%.
14. Alternative literature source for transfusion-related AE disutilities.
In the base-case analysis, a disutility of 0.1 for patients experiencing serious platelet transfusionrelated AEs was applied for one model cycle (4 weeks). This value was taken from TA293,83 a
previous NICE appraisal of eltrombopag for thrombocytopenic purpura. In its model, Shionogi
provided an alternative disutility for platelet transfusion of 0.17, taken from van Eerd et al.73
This value was used in the scenario analysis.
15. Alternative values for elective invasive procedure delay disutility and duration.
In the base-case the AG assumed a disutility for the delay of the planned procedure of 0.072
(calculated from the average decrement associated with a one-level increase in anxiety and
depression on the EQ-5D-5L UK value set).101 This disutility was varied between 0 and 0.144
by halving and doubling the assumed decrement, as well as by assuming no decrement. In the
base-case analysis, this decrement was assumed for 4 weeks to account for elective invasive
procedures being delayed beyond the 35-day initial cycle. This duration was varied between 2 and
6 weeks to investigate the impact on model results.
Results
Assessment group base-case deterministic results
The base-case deterministic model results from the AG model are shown in Table 29. The price of
avatrombopag for both subgroups is assumed to be (confidential information has been removed),
equal to the price of lusutrombopag.
In both subgroups, no TPO-RA incurred the lowest costs and fewest QALYs. In the < 40,000/µl
subgroup, lusutrombopag is the next cheapest option, with an incremental cost compared with no
TPO-RA of £592 and incremental QALYs of 0.00017 (which is equivalent to a gain of 1.5 qualityadjusted life-hours), resulting in a deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of around
£3,400,000. Avatrombopag 60 mg is the most expensive option in this subgroup but incurs a lower
QALY gain than lusutrombopag, with an incremental QALY of –0.000079. Avatrombopag 60 mg
is therefore dominated by lusutrombopag in the < 40,000/µl subgroup. In the 40,000–< 50,000/µl
subgroup, lusutrombopag is the cheapest option after no TPO-RA, with an incremental cost of £624
and an incremental QALY of 0.000000007, resulting in an ICER of > £84,000,000,000 compared with
no TPO-RA. Avatrombopag 40 mg is the most expensive option in this subgroup but provides a higher
QALY gain, with an incremental QALY gain of 0.00041 over lusutrombopag. This results in an ICER of
£21,947 for avatrombopag 40 mg compared with lusutrombopag. However, it should be noted that
the incremental QALYs are extremely small, and in both subgroups all treatments resulted in almost
identical QALYs.

The disaggregated cost results in Table 30 show that, although the costs of platelet transfusion, AE
management and rescue therapy are higher for no TPO-RA than for lusutrombopag and avatrombopag
(except for AE costs in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup), the combined difference in cost is still
substantially lower than the drug costs for lusutrombopag and avatrombopag. This results in incremental
costs of > £500 for both treatments compared with no TPO-RA. In the face of such small incremental
QALYs, this incremental cost has a large impact on the ICER. In both subgroups, the dominance of one
treatment over the other is mostly due to the differences in the QALY decrements as a result of
bleeding, which lead to small but important differences in the total QALYs (Table 31).
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results
The probabilistic results in Table 32 for the < 40,000/µl subgroup follow the same pattern as that of
the deterministic results. Lusutrombopag is more expensive than no TPO-RA by £600 [i.e. (confidential
information has been removed) more expensive] and more effective by 0.0001 QALYs, resulting in an
ICER of approximately £4,000,000. Avatrombopag 60 mg is slightly more expensive and slightly less
effective than lusutrombopag and is therefore dominated. In the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup, no
TPO-RA is again the cheapest option. Lusutrombopag is the next cheapest and most effective option,
with an incremental cost of £626 and incremental QALYs of 0.0004. Avatrombopag 40 mg is £10 more
expensive than lusutrombopag and –0.00054 QALYs less effective and is therefore dominated by
lusutrombopag.
The cost-effectiveness planes (Figures 5 and 6) for both subgroups show that, for the majority of
iterations, both treatments are more costly and more effective than no TPO-RA. However, each
diagram also shows that a substantial proportion of iterations fall in the north-west quadrant,
where the treatments are more expensive but less effective than no TPO-RA. This can be seen

most prominently for avatrombopag in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup, for which it appears that
approximately half of the iterations suggest that avatrombopag is less effective than no TPO-RA
(orange points). This indicates that, given the uncertainties in the model, the treatments should be
regarded as having equivalent effectiveness in terms of QALYs.
The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves in turn (Figures 7 and 8) show that, for all threshold ICERs
up to £100,000, no TPO-RA has 100% probability of being the most cost-effective treatment.

Scenario analysis results
Given the uncertainty surrounding the input parameters utilised in the model, the AG conducted a
series of scenario analyses using various efficacy, mortality, safety, cost and utility parameters. These
scenario analyses are listed below and the results of each are provided in Operational validation efforts
on the assessment group model.
1. drug prices
2. number of ATDs per platelet transfusion
3. cost of platelet transfusion
4. cost of rescue therapy
5. inclusion of grade 2 bleeding AEs
6. probability of requiring platelet transfusion, estimated from international trials only
7. cost of elective invasive procedure taken from international trials only
8. literature source for long-term Child–Pugh grade-specific CLD mortality
9. under-reporting factor for SHOT data platelet transfusion-specific mortality
10. alternative method for calculating surgery-related mortality
11. alternative literature source for baseline CLD utility
12. alternative literature source for bleeding disutility
13. alternative literature source for PVT disutility
14. alternative literature source for transfusion-related AE disutilities
15. alternative values for elective invasive procedure delay disutility and duration
16. cost of elective invasive procedure cancellation
17. proportion of patients requiring platelet transfusion hospitalised the day before elective
invasive procedure.
The description and the results of these analyses are presented in Appendix 7. Among these scenarios,
only the first three (i.e. using different drug prices, different number of ATDs per platelet transfusion
and different platelet transfusion costs) had a substantial impact on the incremental results.
Operational validation efforts on the assessment group model
The AG conducted the following validation efforts:
l comparing the clinical outcomes of the AG economic model with those of clinical trials
l comparing the economic and health outcomes of the AG economic model and the Shionogi
economic model.
Comparison of the clinical outcomes from the model with clinical trials
The model primary clinical outcomes (i.e. the proportion of patients who did not receive a platelet
transfusion and the proportion of patients who received neither platelet transfusion nor rescue
therapy) is compared with the minimum–maximum ranges from the clinical trials (Table 33). The model
generates outputs within the range of the clinical trial results for lusutrombopag and no TPO-RA for
both outcomes. However, for avatrombopag, the model underestimates both the clinical trial outcomes
for the platelet count < 40,000/µl subgroup and the proportion of patients who did not receive a
platelet transfusion outcome in the platelet count 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup.
This gap between the model and trial outcomes can be explained by the fact that in the model the
proportion of patients experiencing each clinical outcome was obtained from meta-analyses. For each
outcome in each subgroup, a common baseline proportion for the placebo arm was required, which
pooled the corresponding placebo proportions from all trials. As the placebo proportions for the two
clinical outcomes from ADAPT-137 and ADAPT-237 were different from those in the lusutrombopag
trials, this difference is accentuated in the difference between the clinical trial outcomes and the model
results based on the meta-analysis results.

Comparison of the clinical outcomes from the assessment group economic model and the
Shionogi economic model
For cross-validity, the model outcomes from the AG model and the Shionogi model are compared.
The placebo arm platelet transfusion proportions were updated to reflect the lusutrombopag trials to
improve the comparability (i.e. in the base-case analysis, the Shionogi model considered 100% platelet
transfusion for placebo arm patients). The resulting differences in model outcomes are shown in Table 34.
The AG model results in fewer life-years and fewer short-term alive proportions than the Shionogi
model. This is because of differing surgery mortality inputs for two models.
The platelet transfusion and recue therapy-related model outputs differ substantially between the
Shionogi and AG models. These differences are mostly due to the difference in how the chance node
probabilities were obtained. The AG model used formal meta-analysis methods, whereas the Shionogi
model used simple pooling.
The QALY difference between the two models is a little more accentuated than the difference in life-years.

Chapter 5 Assessment of factors relevant
to the NHS and other parties
Given that both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are taken orally and would be expected to be
administered in addition to established clinical practice, no additional change in clinical practice
aside from their administration is expected. Indeed, as shown in the cost-effectiveness analysis (see
Chapter 4, Independent economic assessment, Results), there would be a reduction only in the resources
currently allocated to this established practice, most notably platelet transfusion.

Chapter 6 Discussion
Statement of principal findings
From a comprehensive search that retrieved 11,305 records, and after screening, 35 references
pertaining to six studies were included. All six studies,37,39,51,53,54 including both sets of main trials for
each of the TPO-RAs, ADAPT-1, ADAPT-2, L-PLUS 1 and L-PLUS 2, were at low risk of bias.
The main finding was that both avatrombopag (for both platelet subgroups) and lusutrombopag were
clearly effective in comparison with no TPO-RA in terms of primary outcome, including that of three
of the main trials, ADAPT-1,37 ADAPT-237 and L-PLUS 2,54 namely avoidance of platelet transfusion or
rescue procedure for bleeding. Both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were also shown to increase
the proportion of patients who had increased platelet counts or achieved a particular target (i.e.
≥ 20,000/µl above baseline and at least one platelet count of > 50,000/µl from days 4 to 8).37,39,51,53,113
Neither avatrombopag nor lusutrombopag was unequivocally better than no TPO-RA in terms of
AEs, and there was some small amount of evidence to show a higher percentage of deaths with
both TPO-RAs.37,54
When the main outcomes of the avoidance of the composite outcome of no platelet transfusion before
the elective procedure or rescue therapy or the avoidance of platelet transfusion only were analysed
according to the subgroups that matched the expected licensed doses of avatrombopag (< 40,000/µl
for 60 mg or 40,000–< 50,000/µl for 40 mg), both avatrombopag and lusutrombopag were superior
to placebo and mostly with a statistically significant difference (i.e. 95% CIs did not overlap the point
of no difference). The exception was the very small Japic CTI-121944 study.53 However, when the
outcome of avoidance of rescue therapy was considered alone, albeit only in those who did not receive
platelet transfusion before the elective procedure, the lusutrombopag trials were revealed to have a
much lower frequency than the ADAPT trials37 regardless of treatment arm, and the explanation for
this is not obvious. The trials also show that there is no statistically significant difference between
lusutrombopag and placebo. However, there was a statistically significant difference for avatrombopag
between the < 40,000/µl subgroup of ADAPT-137 and the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup in ADAPT-2.37
This did imply an advantage of avatrombopag over lusutrombopag from the indirect comparison,
but this was statistically significant only in the fixed-effect analysis of the < 40,000/µl subgroup. The
proportion of those who received no rescue therapy who received platelets was not available to the AG.
The implications of these results are that both TPO-RAs are effective in reducing platelet transfusion
prior to the elective procedure. However, there seems to be little difference between them and no
TPO-RAs in AEs, including death or in the avoidance of rescue therapy due to bleeding. Neither was
there much difference between the two TPO-RAs in any outcome that included avoidance of platelet
transfusion and in any of the two main platelet subgroups (i.e. < 40,000/µl or 40,000–< 50,000/µl).
It is interesting to note that this was not the case for the avoidance of rescue therapy given no receipt
of platelet transfusion: there was some evidence of an advantage to avatrombopag. However, the
underlying rate of rescue therapy was much higher in the avatrombopag trials and so this cannot be
ruled out as a confounding factor.
When the cost-effectiveness of both TPO-RAs was compared with that of no TPO-RA, it was clear
that, in terms of QALYs, TPO-RAs have only marginal benefit over care as usual. When uncertainty is
taken into account, both lusutrombopag and avatrombopag have about a 50% chance of being more

effective than no TPO-RA in terms of QALYs gained. This essentially reduces the cost-effectiveness
analysis to a cost-minimisation analysis. For both subgroups, no TPO-RA clearly has the lowest
costs, even when taking uncertainties into account. Lusutrombopag is about (confidential information
has been removed) more costly than no TPO-RA in the < 40,000/µl subgroup and avatrombopag
(confidential information has been removed) more costly. For the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup,
avatrombopag and lusutrombopag are (confidential information has been removed) and (confidential
information has been removed) more expensive than no TPO-RA, respectively. In the probabilistic
sensitivity analysis, it was shown that, for all thresholds < £100,000, no TPO-RA had a 100%
probability of being cost-effective.
Various scenario analyses showed that the results are most sensitive to the (currently unknown) price
of avatrombopag. If the price of avatrombopag were to be (confidential information has been removed)
below the price of lusutrombopag, avatrombopag would become cost saving in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl
subgroup.
Three of the 15 other scenarios, namely ‘number of ATDs per platelet transfusion’, ‘cost of platelet
transfusion’ and ‘under-reporting factor for SHOT data platelet transfusion specific mortality’ had a
substantial impact on the cost-effectiveness results. In each of these cases the avatrombopag costs
would decrease in the 40,000 < 50,000/µl subgroup to values of around 10% more than no TPO-RA in
the most extreme scenarios. However, even in these four scenarios, the ICERs would remain very high
and clearly out of the range of acceptable ICERs.
Strengths and limitations of the assessment
Throughout this review, the methods recommended in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook9 and by the
CRD10 were applied to reduce the risk of bias and error. This included the search strategy, which was
designed to be highly sensitive to ensure the lowest risk of missing any relevant studies in either the
clinical effectiveness or the cost-effectiveness section. In addition, all published outcomes in terms of
effectiveness and AEs were extracted. Furthermore, the AG sought and obtained further data from
the companies responsible for each of the interventions to inform subgroup analyses necessary to
compare the interventions in meta-analyses. All available data were pooled in these meta-analyses,
and robustness was tested by comparing fixed- and random-effects analyses as well as sensitivity
analyses to test the effect of excluding particular studies.
The review was limited initially by the lack of many of the data needed to make the comparison of
lusutrombopag with avatrombopag in the < 40,000/µl and 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroups. However, this
has been largely resolved by the company response to the AG request for clarification.56,57 Nevertheless,
some of the rescue therapy data for lusutrombopag were not provided in those subgroups. In addition,
there are inconsistencies in the avatrombopag data, as discussed in Uncertainties. There was also clinical
heterogeneity between the lusutrombopag trials as well as between the lusutrombopag and avatrombopag
sets of trials. However, statistical heterogeneity was no more than moderate, and the robustness of
outcomes in terms of the extent of the difference between TPO-RA and no TPO-RA and between both
TPO-RAs was demonstrated in sensitivity analyses.
From the cost-effectiveness point of view, there were several additional important gaps in the evidence
required to conduct the analysis. Most notably, Dova Pharmaceuticals declined to provide a price for
avatrombopag. This severely hindered the AG’s ability to fairly compare the two treatments in terms
of cost-effectiveness, as it was necessary to assume that the price of avatrombopag was the same as
the price of lusutrombopag. There was also a lack of consistent reporting and data provision on the
content of platelet transfusions, which led to substantial uncertainty when calculating costs and safety
related to platelet transfusion and rescue therapy. This will be discussed further in Uncertainties.

Uncertainties
There appeared to be a difference in the timing of platelet transfusion avoided, with the L-PLUS
studies39,54 specifying prior to the elective procedure and the ADAPT studies37 specifying up to 7 days
following randomisation. It is also not clear what independent contributions are made by platelet
transfusion and rescue procedure, given that nature of the composite outcome.
In the ADAPT trials37 all patients received avatrombopag for 5 days, whereas in the L-PLUS trials39,54
lusutrombopag was administered for between 5 and 7 days depending on platelet count, that is, if the
platelet count was at least 50,000/µl with an increase of at least 20,000/µl then no additional dose
was given. The implications of this difference are that lusutrombopag was administered over a longer
period on average than avatrombopag. However, the implications for clinical practice would depend on
the stopping rule applied in clinical practice. Indeed, it was stated in the European Public Assessment
Report for lusutrombopag8 that there was ‘. . . no clear difference in platelet response for patients
without platelet transfusion was found between the group receiving a fixed dosing regimen of 7 days
and the group where a stopping criterion was applied’ (reproduced with permission; © European
Medicines Agency). However, this same document8 stated ‘The presented data indicate a slightly
improved efficacy of lusutrombopag at a fixed 7-day treatment regimen. Conversely, comparative
assessment of safety data is uncertain due to the sparsity of data. However, it is considered that
the data presented do not implicate a substantial safety issue with regard to a 7-day treatment
with lusutrombopag without the application of a stopping criterion’ (reproduced with permission;
© European Medicines Agency). Nevertheless, this same document8 refers to the absence of a
stopping rule in the summary of product characteristics.114 The European Public Assessment Report
for avatrombopag6 states a fixed time of 5 days, as in the ADAPT trials,37 and so, essentially, no
stopping rule would apply to both drugs in clinical practice. In addition, Dova Pharmaceuticals
responded to our question regarding this by saying that it is expected that all patients who are
treated will receive 5 days of dosing and that patients who have been treated in the USA have all
received 5 days of treatment with the drug.57 It therefore seems plausible that, should no stopping
rule apply, the effectiveness of lusutrombopag might be greater than was observed in the L-PLUS
trials. However, a compromise in terms of safety cannot also be ruled out.
The proportion of patients who received no rescue therapy who received platelet transfusion was not
available to the AG. Shionogi did provide the number of patients who received platelet transfusion as
rescue therapy in each of the subgroups (see Table 5), but it provided only the number of those who
received any rescue therapy per trial arm (i.e. not in each subgroup).56 Dova Pharmaceuticals appeared
superficially to have provided these numbers in each subgroup, but there was a large discrepancy
between the numbers used to inform Table 23 and those reported in the response to clarification.
For example, the number of patients calculated to receive rescue therapy in the avatrombopag arm
of the < 40,000/µl subgroup of ADAPT 137 is 71 – 59 = 12. However, the number reported to have
received rescue therapy in table ‘Summary of Rescue Therapy – FAS’ in the response to clarification
is 1.57 Similarly, the number of patients calculated to receive rescue therapy in the placebo arm of the
< 40,000/µl subgroup of ADAPT 137 is 26 – 11 = 15, but the corresponding number in the response to
clarification is 4.57
Although there appeared to be little difference in mortality between each of the TPO-RAs and no TPO-RA,
as reported in Table 17, follow-up specifically for mortality was unclear and total trial follow-up was short,
at no more than 5 weeks (see Table 8). Therefore, the longer-term outcomes remain uncertain.
The cost-effectiveness analysis was subject to a range of structural and parameter uncertainties. In
terms of cost-effectiveness parameters, one of the biggest uncertainties was the content, and therefore
the cost, of platelet transfusion. The lack of consistent reporting internationally, as well as between
centres, on definitions of terms such as ‘units’ and ‘pools’, and on the number of platelets these terms
correspond to and how these link to UK practice and reference prices led to substantial uncertainty

regarding this parameter. Although the AG was able to estimate a cost based on ATDs through
searching UK guidelines, consulting its clinical expert and using data on the number of platelets
transfused provided by Shionogi in its clarification response, it notes that this cost is much lower
than that estimated by Shionogi in its model.56 As can be seen from scenario analyses of the cost
and size of platelet transfusions, assumptions surrounding these aspects have a large impact on the
ICER. Given the very small QALY gains associated with these treatments, cost minimisation becomes
important. As the main source of efficacy for these treatments is that they reduce the need for platelet
transfusions, this is where the majority of the drug costs are offset. However, the issue is compounded
further by the fact that the other main area of the model in which costs can be avoided is the reduction
in the number of rescue therapies required, whose cost is also largely dependent on the chosen cost of
platelet transfusion. Therefore, the price of platelet transfusion is crucial in determining the price at
which these drugs will be cost-effective.
An additional source of uncertainty in the model is the effectiveness of the TPO-RA agents in reducing
the probability of delays to surgery and the implication that this would have in terms of costs and
QALYs. The treatment group-specific probabilities of delay to surgery were obtained from a single
trial (L-PLUS 254), which provided only overall probabilities for lusutrombopag and no TPO-RA that
were not separated by subgroup. Furthermore, it was not clear if the reason for surgery postponement
was solely thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the AG had to assume that the probability of procedure delay
was the same for both TPO-RAs and across subgroups, which may not be a true reflection of reality.
In addition, assumptions had to be made about the implication of delays to surgery for costs and
utility. The AG assumed a disutility associated with lengthy delays to a procedure as it assumed that
this would have an impact on patients by increasing their worry and anxiety. However, ideally, this
assumption would be based on evidence, as it is uncertain. The AG also felt it inappropriate to include
a sunk cost for cancelled surgeries in the base-case analysis, given that this cost was removed from
the reference costs over 10 years ago and the assumption that surgeon and theatre time would still
be efficiently used for other procedures. Scenario analyses were conducted to examine the impact
of assumptions surrounding sunk costs and disutilities associated with delays to surgery as well
as the impact of additional hospitalisation before surgery due to the platelet transfusion. The cost
scenario had a limited impact on results. The surgery delay disutility and the pre-surgery hospitalisation
scenarios reduced the ICERs; however, the ICERs after these reductions remained outside acceptable
ranges. When combined with the assumption that all patients who require platelet transfusion will be
hospitalised before surgery, a higher cost to the NHS of procedure cancellation or rescheduling or a
more substantial disutility associated with delays would mean that the cost-effectiveness of TPO-RAs,
if they are indeed effective in reducing the probability of delay, would increase. However, this would
probably not be sufficient to make them cost-effective, as the main difference in costs is drug related.

Chapter 7 Conclusions
Implications for service provision
If the aim of service provision is to reduce platelet transfusion prior to elective procedures in those
with CLD, then both lusutrombopag 3 mg and avatrombopag 60 mg or 40 mg for the < 40,000/µl or
40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroups, respectively, would seem to be able to do that safely. The evidence
suggests that avatrombopag might also be able to reduce the need for rescue therapy for bleeding.
However, given the large difference between the rates of rescue therapy between the lusutrombopag and
avatrombopag trials, it is uncertain under what circumstances this might be observed in clinical practice.
Similarly, from the cost-effectiveness point of view, given the lack of difference in long-term QALYs
between TPO-RA options and no TPO-RA, the aim of service provision may become important in
the decision. If the aim is to reduce reliance on platelet transfusion, evidence suggests that TPO-RAs
are successful in safely achieving this. Therefore, careful consideration must be given to the costs of
platelet transfusion compared with TPO-RA drug costs. If the focus is on long-term QALY benefits
rather than reducing reliance on platelet transfusion, the results suggest that the TPO-RA options
assessed are not cost-effective given the current assumptions surrounding costs and effects.
Suggested research priorities
Given the need to compare the two TPO-RAs and the potential lack of comparability of the extant
trials, a head-to-head trial is warranted. This should ideally measure all relevant outcomes, including
risk of platelet transfusion separate from rescue therapy and with a longer follow-up at least of
mortality. The trial should be of a size that permits subgroup analysis according to baseline platelet
count as well as in terms of CLD type and elective procedure.
Any future trials in this area should focus on consistently collecting data on the content of platelet
transfusions in terms of the number of platelets transfused or consistent and clear definitions such as
ATDs so that accurate costs can be calculated. This is particularly important given that the avoidance
of platelet transfusion does not seem to translate into differences in QALYs. Therefore, accurate
costing is crucial for decision-making.

Appendix 7 Cost-effectiveness
scenario analyses
Drug prices
Given that the AG does not have a price for avatrombopag, and given that when both treatments have
such a small impact on total QALYs the costs become very important, some scenarios around the pricing
of avatrombopag were thought to be of value. In this scenario analysis, the prices of avatrombopag
were lowered, in increments of 10%, by 10–80% from the assumed price of (confidential information
has been removed). The results in Table 38 show that these drug price reductions slowly reduce the
incremental costs and ICER comparing avatrombopag with no TPO-RA. At a (confidential information
has been removed) price reduction, avatrombopag 40 mg dominates no TPO-RA in the 40,000
< 50,000/µl subgroup and the ICER is under the NICE threshold for avatrombopag 60 mg in the
< 40,000/µl subgroup.
Number of adult therapeutic doses per platelet transfusion
Given the uncertainty surrounding the number of ATDs per platelet transfusion, scenarios involving
this variable are important. As shown in Table 39, the assumption of one ATD per transfusion results
in the highest ICER, as this results in the lowest cost for platelet transfusion and therefore the biggest
incremental cost difference between the treatments and no TPO-RA. The Shionogi base case of three
ATDs per transfusion (equivalent to treating ATDs as the assumed units in the Shionogi model) provides
the lowest ICER compared with no TPO-RA. However, none of the assumed numbers of ATDs results in
a cost-effective option, with the ICER of £631,735 for avatrombopag 40 mg compared no TPO-RA being
the lowest ICER observed among these scenarios.
Cost of platelet transfusion
The AG also adjusted the costs of platelet transfusion. The AG base-case cost of £313.83 was replaced
by two values calculated by Shionogi in its model. The scenario price of £517.28, based on the HRG
codes for single plasma exchange or other intravenous blood transfusion and the Shionogi base-case
value of £812.61, assuming 3 units per transfusion, both resulted in lower ICERs than the AG base
case (Table 40). However, none reduced the ICER sufficiently to be considered cost-effective, with the
lowest ICER being £620,415 for avatrombopag 40 mg compared with lusutrombopag.
Cost of rescue therapy
In the Shionogi model, it was assumed that, in clinical practice, rescue therapy would consist of an
additional platelet transfusion. The AG noted that this assumption was not matched by the data
presented by the companies, which showed that other methods of rescue were also used by clinicians.
However, in the face of uncertainty surrounding what would actually be given in the UK, the AG
cost of platelet transfusion of £313.83 was used in the base case. The AG clinical expert stated
that he would consider giving a combination of platelet transfusion, clotting factors and tranexamic
acid. The cost of this combination was used as an alternative, at a value of £370.73. The remaining
alternative value was based on the Shionogi base-case cost of platelet transfusion of £812.61. As
shown in Table 41, increasing the cost of rescue therapy decreased the ICER, but not sufficiently to
make any of the comparisons with no TPO-RA cost-effective.

Inclusion of grade 2 bleeding adverse events
The direction and magnitude of the impact on the ICER of the inclusion of grade 2 bleeding events
varied depending on which treatment had the highest probability of bleeding, as can be seen in
Table 42. In the < 40,000/µl subgroup, avatrombopag patients had the highest probability of bleeding.
Including grade 2 events increased the ICER dramatically. A large impact on the ICER was also seen
with lusutrombopag, which resulted in the highest bleeding probability in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl
subgroup, with the inclusion of grade 2 events decreasing the ICER substantially. However, in the
remaining two comparisons, the inclusion of grade 2 bleeding events had little impact on the ICER.
Probability of requiring platelet transfusion, estimated from international
trials only
Using the probability of platelet transfusion estimated from international trials only does not have a
substantial impact on the ICER, as shown in Table 43. The direction of the impact varies, with the ICER
decreasing slightly for the comparison between avatrombopag 60 mg and no TPO-RA, but increasing
for all other comparisons with no TPO-RA.
Efficacy input from fixed-effects model
As can be seen in Table 44, ICERs are very similar between the fixed-effect and random-effects model
for all comparisons.
Literature source for long-term Child–Pugh grade-specific mortality
Although using the UKMi data as the source of long-term mortality estimation substantially reduces the
QALYs gained in all treatment groups, the incremental QALYs remain very similar, as shown in Table 45.
Therefore, the choice of long-term mortality data source has little impact on the ICER.
Under reporting factor for serious hazards of transfusion platelet
transfusion-specific mortality
To test the potential impact of under-reporting of deaths platelet transfusion on the model results,
under-reporting factors of 10 and 50 (corresponding to incidences of platelet transfusion-related
deaths of 0.00046% and 0.023%, respectively) were tested in scenario analyses. As can be seen in
Table 46, these increases in platelet transfusion-related mortality did substantially decrease the ICER.
However, the under-reporting factor of 50 was chosen as a particularly extreme value and it is unlikely
that incidences would in fact be this high.
Alternative method for calculating surgery-related mortality
As can be seen in Table 47, using the alternative posterior distribution method for calculating pooled
surgery-related mortality from the trial data increased QALYs gained by all groups by approximately
0.042 QALYs but did not change the incremental QALYs, as the same surgery-related mortality applies
to all patients and all patients in the model are assumed to eventually receive their surgery. Therefore,
the ICER remained unchanged.

Alternative literature source for baseline chronic liver disease utility
As shown in Table 48, using the Scalone et al.99 baseline utility value of 0.801, compared with the basecase value of 0.544, increased the QALYs gained by all groups by approximately 1.5 QALYs and resulted in
slightly lower ICERs in all comparisons with no TPO-RA. The biggest impact was seen for lusutrombopag
compared with no TPO-RA in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup, with the ICER approximately halving;
however, this could be expected as this is the comparison with by far the fewest incremental QALYs,
and therefore an increase (even a small one) makes a large impact on the very large ICER.
Alternative literature source for bleeding disutility
The AG could not find any alternative literature sources for the disutility of major bleeds. Therefore,
the base-case value was increased and decreased by 25%. The direction of the impact of changes
to the bleeding disutility value on the ICER varied depending on which treatment had the highest
probability of bleeding, as can be seen in Table 49. In the < 40,000/µl subgroup, avatrombopag patients
had the highest probability of bleeding. Therefore, decreasing the disutility for a major bleed decreased
the ICER. The same was seen for lusutrombopag, which resulted in the highest bleeding probability in
the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup. However, in the remaining two comparisons, increasing the disutility
decreased the ICER. However, changes in the ICER were never large enough to change the costeffectiveness decision.
Alternative literature source for portal vein thrombosis disutility
The AG could not find any alternative literature sources for the disutility of PVT. Therefore, the
base-case value was increased and decreased by 25%. In all cases, decreasing the disutility increased
the ICER and vice versa. However, the impact was small for all comparisons, as shown in Table 50.
Alternative literature source for transfusion-related adverse
event disutilities
Increasing the disutility from 0.1 to 0.17 decreased the ICER marginally in all cases, as can be seen in
Table 51. However, the impact of the change was small in all cases.
Alternative values for planned elective inpatient procedure delay disutility
and duration
The ICER is very sensitive to the choice of elective invasive procedure delay disutility and duration,
as shown in Table 52. A 0 disutility results in dominated ICERs for avatrombopag 60 mg compared
with no TPO-RA in the < 40,000/µl subgroup, dominated ICERs for both treatments compared
with no TPO-RA in the 40,000–< 50,000/µl subgroup and an ICER > £30,000,000 for the remaining
comparison with no TPO-RA in the < 40,000/µl subgroup. Doubling the disutility to 0.144 provides
substantially lower ICERs, but they are still not low enough for the treatments to be considered
cost-effective.
Cost of planned elective inpatient procedure cancellation
The addition of the sunk cost for elective invasive procedure cancellation of £566.05 assumed by
Shionogi in its base-case model did not have a substantial impact on the results (Table 53).

Proportion of patient requiring platelet transfusion hospitalised the day
before planned elective inpatient procedure
In this scenario the AG tested the assumption that a proportion of those patients requiring platelet
transfusion to raise their platelet count prior to surgery would be hospitalised the day before surgery
to receive the transfusion. The cost of this extra day was taken from the NHS Reference Costs 2017/18,
86
which provided a cost of £431.11 for an excess inpatient hospital day. This cost was multiplied by the
relevant proportion of patients in each scenario and added to the elective invasive procedure costs of
those patients who received platelet transfusion prior to elective invasive procedure in each treatment
arm. The results show that this scenario does not have a substantial impact on results, even when an
extra day of hospitalisation is included for all patients who receive platelet transfusion (Table 54).
