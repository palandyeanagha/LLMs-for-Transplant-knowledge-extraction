Key questions
What is already known?
► YouTube has been a significant source of misleading 
information during public health crises, including the 
H1N1, Ebola and Zika outbreaks.
► These studies reported that approximately 
23%–26% of YouTube videos were misleading, 
while videos from reputable sources were vastly 
under-represented.
What are the new findings?
► More than one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube 
videos contained misleading information, eliciting 
over 62 million views worldwide.
► Videos from reputable sources remain underrepresented in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
► Strategies that can be employed by government and 
public health agencies to increase the viewership of 
their quality content on COVID-19 were identified.
What do the new findings imply?
► Misinformation about COVID-19 is reaching more 
individuals than in past public health crises, as 
YouTube continues to grow as a source of health 
information.
► As the current COVID-19 pandemic worsens, public health agencies must better use YouTube to 
deliver quality content and minimise the spread of 
misinformation.
Abstract
Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic is this century’s 
largest public health emergency and its successful 
management relies on the effective dissemination of 
factual information. As a social media platform with billions 
of daily views, YouTube has tremendous potential to both 
support and hinder public health efforts. However, the 
usefulness and accuracy of most viewed YouTube videos 
on COVID-19 have not been investigated.
Methods A YouTube search was performed on 21 March 
2020 using keywords ‘coronavirus’ and ‘COVID-19’, and 
the top 75 viewed videos from each search were analysed. 
Videos that were duplicates, non-English, non-audio and 
non-visual, exceeding 1 hour in duration, live and unrelated 
to COVID-19 were excluded. Two reviewers coded the 
source, content and characteristics of included videos. 
The primary outcome was usability and reliability of 
videos, analysed using the novel COVID-19 Specific Score 
(CSS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) and modified JAMA 
(mJAMA) scores.
Results Of 150 videos screened, 69 (46%) were included, 
totalling 257 804 146 views. Nineteen (27.5%) videos 
contained non-factual information, totalling 62 042 609 
views. Government and professional videos contained only 
factual information and had higher CSS than consumer 
videos (mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95%CI 0.10 to 4.32, 
p=0.037); mDISCERN scores than consumer videos 
(MD 2.46, 95%CI 0.50 to 4.42, p=0.008), internet news 
videos (MD 2.20, 95%CI 0.19 to 4.21, p=0.027) and 
entertainment news videos (MD 2.57, 95%CI 0.66 to 
4.49, p=0.004); and mJAMA scores than entertainment 
news videos (MD 1.21, 95%CI 0.07 to 2.36, p=0.033) and 
consumer videos (MD 1.27, 95%CI 0.10 to 2.44, p=0.028). 
However, they only accounted for 11% of videos and 10% 
of views.
Conclusion Over one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube 
videos on COVID-19 contained misleading information, 
reaching millions of viewers worldwide. As the current 
COVID-19 pandemic worsens, public health agencies 
must better use YouTube to deliver timely and accurate 
information and to minimise the spread of misinformation. 
This may play a significant role in successfully managing 
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first 
detected late December 2019,1 2 is the first 
coronavirus (CoV) pandemic of the 21st 
century. It is the most serious CoV outbreak 
in history with 266073 cases and 11183 deaths 
as of 21 March 2020,3
 outnumbering both 
the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome 
epidemic (8096 cases, 774 deaths) and the 
2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome 
outbreak (2494 cases, 858 deaths).4 5
Over 70% of adults search the internet for 
health and healthcare related information.6
YouTube is one of the most dominant sources 
of online information, with over 2billion 
users generating billions of daily views.7 The 
strength of YouTube, as compared with other 
social media platforms, lies in its judicious use 
of audio and visual communication, making

it readily accessible to individuals from all demographic 
backgrounds. Although YouTube is a powerful educational tool that healthcare professionals can mobilise to 
disseminate information and influence public behaviour, 
if used inappropriately, it can simultaneously be a source 
of misleading information that can work significantly 
against these efforts.
Previous studies have shown that YouTube has been 
a source of useful and misleading information during 
public health crises, including the H1N1 pandemic, 
Ebola outbreak and Zika outbreak.8–10 These studies 
found that approximately 23%–26.3% of YouTube videos 
informing viewers about these diseases were misleading 
and that these videos largely originated from independent users.8–10 Furthermore, they demonstrated that 
reputable videos were under-represented.8–10 Although 
these studies provide preliminary insights into the use of 
YouTube during public health crises, the generalisability 
and applicability of their findings to the current COVID-19 
pandemic are limited. First, some studies8 11 did not use 
validated instruments to assess the reliability and quality 
of videos. In addition, given the rapid evolution and 
increasing usage of social media, public viewership habits 
and public health officials’ utilisation of YouTube may 
be substantially different during the current COVID-19 
pandemic, as compared with the time of publication of 
these studies. Currently, the literature lacks evidence on 
YouTube as a source of information in the context of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Insights into the quality of information during the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly 
essential, given that the current scale of COVID-19 has 
greatly surpassed both the H1N1 pandemic and past CoV 
outbreaks.3–5 12
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the 
accuracy, usability and quality of the most widely viewed 
YouTube videos on COVID-19. Based on these results, 
the second objective is to propose immediate recommendations that will enable professional organisations 
to better utilise YouTube and expand the delivery of 
accurate and timely information, as the COVID-19 
pandemic evolves.
Methods
Search protocol
The following search method was developed a priori 
and has been validated in previous studies of YouTube 
content.8–11 13 14 A YouTube search was performed on 
21 March 2020 using the keywords ‘coronavirus’ and 
‘COVID-19’. The search was done using a cleared-cache 
web browser, which consists of the most recent version 
of Google Chrome in incognito mode with all available 
updates installed. Search results were sorted by ‘views’ 
to obtain the most widely viewed YouTube videos in 
descending order at the time of search. The hyperlinks 
of most widely viewed 75 videos for each keyword were 
collected on a spreadsheet for data collection.
Study selection and data extraction
Two reviewers (HO-YL and AB) independently reviewed 
and analysed all 150 videos. The exclusion criteria 
included duplicate videos, non-English videos, videos 
without audio and/or visual information, videos 
exceeding 1hour in duration, livestream videos and 
videos unrelated to COVID-19. This exclusion criteria 
were based on previous studies9 10 13 with the addition of 
livestream videos, as we felt that they are not representative of the majority of YouTube videos represented in our 
sample. Only English videos were included, as English is 
the universal language adopted by many countries globally.15 Any discrepancies between reviewers were resolved 
by discussion with the third reviewer (DH) and senior 
author (JC) for consensus. Descriptive characteristics of 
all videos including video title, video hyperlink, number 
of views, number of likes and dislikes, upload date of 
video, video duration and video publishing category 
were included. Video publishing categories were adapted 
from previous work of YouTube content (online supplementary table S1).11
The reliability and quality of video content was 
assessed using the modified DISCERN score (mDISCERN) (online supplementary table S2) and the modified Journal of the American Medical Association (mJAMA) 
benchmark criteria (online supplementary table S3).16 17
There were not any validated evaluation tools available 
to assess online information regarding COVID-19. 
Thus, to assess the usefulness of video content for the 
average viewer, we created a novel five-point COVID-19 
Specific Score (CSS). One point was awarded if the video 
contained exclusively factual information on the transmission, typical symptoms, prevention strategies, potential treatments and epidemiology of COVID-19 as of the 
video’s publication date, for a total of 5 points (online 
supplementary table S4). This score was developed based 
on previously published work on public health emergencies,8–11 a review of the COVID-19 literature and expert 
input.
Patient and public involvement
No patients and public were involved in any way in this 
study.
Data analysis
Following data extraction, two independent reviewers 
(HO-YL and AB) categorised all videos into factual and 
non-factual videos and into their video publishing category in duplicate, with third reviewer (DH) and senior 
author (JC) consultation for consensus. Videos were 
considered non-factual if they contained one or more 
non-factual statements, as evaluated based on guidelines from major public health agencies (eg, WHO and 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) at the 
video’s publication date. Subsequently, the CSS, mDISCERN and mJAMA scores of each individual video were 
calculated. Interobserver agreement was evaluated with 
the Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Two tailed t-tests were

used to compare factual videos to non-factual videos, 
while a one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett’s post 
hoc test were used to test for differences between video 
sources in comparison with videos from government and 
professional sources (control group), with a significance 
level of p=0.05. Government and professional videos 
were combined in group analysis, as these videos sources 
were considered to have the highest standard of publication. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
software (SPSS V.19.0).
Results
Video characteristics
Of the 150 videos screened and 69 videos (46%) were 
identified for inclusion. The remaining 81 videos (54%) 
were excluded for duplicates (42), non-English language 
(31), over 1hour long (4), live streams (1), no audio (2) 
or unrelated to COVID-19 (1), as shown in figure 1. The 
total viewership of the 69 included videos was 257804146 
views.
Source of videos
The 69 videos were categorised into eight categories as 
shown in figure 2. Cohen’s kappa for the categorisation 
of videos into their respective categories was 0.90±0.04. 
The total viewership of our videos was 257804146 views 
with 29% from network news, 22% from consumers, 
21% from entertainment news, 12% from internet news, 
7% from professionals, 5% from newspapers, 2% from 
education and 2% from government sources.
Factual versus non-factual videos
Of the 69 included videos, 19 (27.5%) contained nonfactual information, while 50 (72.5%) contained only 
factual information. Cohen’s kappa for the categorisation of factual and misleading videos was 0.86±0.07. Nonfactual videos accounted for 24.1% of the total viewership 
for a total of 62042609 views. Factual videos accounted 
for 75.9% of total viewership.
When comparing both groups, there were not any 
significant differences in views per video (p=0.497), likes 
per video (p=0.785), dislikes per video (p=0.104), duration (p=0.462) and days since publication (p=0.230) as 
shown in table 1.
Of the 19 non-factual videos, six were from entertainment news (32%), five were from network news (26%), 
five were from internet news (26%) and three were from 
consumer videos (13%). Within each video category, there 
was a greater proportion of non-factual videos in internet 
news (63%), entertainment news (60%), consumer 
videos (33%) and network news (20%), compared with 
0% for professional and government videos. In addition, 
videos from internet news (MD 0.63; 95%CI 0.07 to 1.19; 
p=0.023) and entertainment news (MD 0.60; 95%CI 0.07 
to 1.13; p=0.021) were significantly more likely to have 
non-factual information compared with professional and 
government videos.
Objective outcome measures of video content
As shown in table 2, professional and government videos 
demonstrated higher CSS than consumer videos (MD 
2.21; 95%CI 0.10 to 4.32; p=0.037), mDISCERN scores 
than consumer videos (MD 2.46; 95%CI 0.50 to 4.42; 
p=0.008), internet news (MD 2.20; 95%CI 0.19 to 4.21; 
p=0.027) and entertainment news (MD 2.57; 95%CI 
0.66 to 4.49; p=0.004), and mJAMA scores than entertainment news (MD 1.21; 95%CI 0.07 to 2.36; p=0.033) 
and consumer videos (MD 1.27; 95%CI 0.10 to 2.44; 
p=0.028).
Descriptive analysis of non-factual statements
Examples of quotations of non-factual statements can be 
classified into four categories: statements related to the 
CSS criteria, recommendations for the general public, 
racist and discriminatory remarks and conspiracy theories, as shown in box 1.
Discussion
This study evaluated the accuracy, usability and quality of 
the most widely viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 in

order to better understand the information viewed by the 
public on a dominant media platform. Our study highlights that over 25% of YouTube’s most viewed English 
videos contained non-factual or misleading information, 
reaching over 62million views and nearly 25% of total 
viewership. There were high proportions of non-factual 
videos in the entertainment and internet news categories 
and moderate amounts in consumer and network news 
categories. In comparison with these sources, professional and government videos demonstrated higher 
accuracy, usability and quality across all measures but 
were largely under-represented in our sample. Our findings, which are consistent with those published in similar 
studies,8 10 11 suggest the lack of access of professional and

Box 1 Examples of quotations from non-factual videos.
Statements related to the CSS criteria:
► ‘Coronavirus only affects immunocompromised, cancer patients, 
and older people’.
► ‘The pharmaceutical companies have a cure but won't sell it so 
everyone is dying’.
► ‘A stronger strain of the virus is in Iran and Italy’.
Statements related to recommendations for the general public:

Racist and discriminatory remarks
► ’Chinese virus’.
► ‘Chinese must understand it’s a sensitive time, do not misunderstand isolation as discrimination’.
Conspiracy theories
► ‘The world is controlled by a cult. This cult wants to control everyone. These people are the 1% and use an underground force to 
control people. This cult uses the mainstream media to tell premade 
versions of a story in order to incite fear and control in the public. 
Coronavirus is an example of one of these control tactics. This is 
done to control the economy to destroy small business’.
government sources to individuals who use YouTube as a 
source of health information and a missed opportunity 
for dissemination of high-quality content.
In addition, descriptive analysis of non-factual videos 
included statements consisting of conspiracy theories, 
non-factual information, inappropriate recommendations 
inconsistent with current official government and health 
agency guidelines and discriminating statements. This is 
particularly alarming, when considering the immense viewership of these videos. Evidently, while the power of social 
media lies in the sheer volume and diversity of information 
being generated and spread, it has significant potential for 
harm. The proliferation and spread of misinformation can 
exacerbate racism and fear and result in unconstructive 
and dangerous behaviour,18 19 such as toilet paper hoarding 
and mask stealing behaviours seen so far in the COVID-19 
pandemic. Consequently, this misinformation impedes the 
delivery of accurate pandemic-related information, thus 
hindering efforts by public health officials and healthcare 
professionals to fight the pandemic.18 19
The education and engagement of the public is paramount in the management of this pandemic by ensuring 
public understanding of and, therefore, adherence with 
public health measures. In current times, social media 
has emerged as a powerful tool in controlling the spread 
of information and in shaping public understanding and 
behaviour. YouTube is a powerful, untapped educational 
tool that should be better mobilised by health professionals 
to control information and influence public behaviour. 
Given that professionals and government organisations 
provide the highest quality content, these groups should 
find strategies to increase the viewership and the impact 
of their videos on YouTube. Many existing marketing 
strategies are static, in the form of published guidelines, 
statistical reports and infographics and may not be as 
appealing or accessible to the general public. Using multimedia and multiple social media platforms, including 
YouTube, will allow for greater impact. Furthermore, past 
research has demonstrated that using different emotional 
tones (eg, humour and anger) to deliver health information may increase public belief in such messages,20 which 
may consequently increase adherence. While members 
of governments and professionals already make appearances on network news programmes, partnerships between 
public health agencies and the creators of consumer and 
entertainment news videos may be an effective strategy to 
broaden their reach and impact. As an example, the most 
viewed video on YouTube at the time of this study, with over 
20million views, was produced by a popular YouTube and 
television celebrity.
There are several strengths of this study. We used a 
combination of objective validated tools as measures of 
reliability, specifically the mJAMA and mDISCERN criteria, 
in comparison with mainly descriptive studies published 
previously.8 11 Additionally, our sample included the top 
69 widely viewed YouTube videos at the time of search, 
capturing over 250million views and allowing for the analysis of video content accessed by many YouTube users. 
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the 
accuracy and quality of the most widely viewed YouTube 
videos and their publishing sources during the COVID-19 
pandemic. As such, this study provides important insights 
into how professional organisations and health agencies 
can collaborate with content creators on YouTube to deliver 
high-quality information to a larger audience. Directing 
future public health efforts to mitigate the spread of misinformation may allow for increased public adherence with 
public health measures.
This study also has limitations to consider. First, this 
is a cross-sectional study at one time point. However, as 
YouTube is a dynamic platform, any search strategy would 
have this limitation. In addition, this limitation is unlikely 
to affect our conclusion given that they are supported by 
other studies at other time points.8 10 11 The search strategy, 
developed a priori, captured the top 75 videos for each 
of the two keywords; however, many of these videos were 
excluded per the reasons noted in figure 1, resulting in a 
final sample size of 69 videos. In future studies, the significant number of potential videos that may be excluded 
should be considered prior to data collection; however, 
this is difficult to predict ahead of time. Regardless, our 
sample size is larger than some other similarly designed 
studies on YouTube content published, such as Radonjic et 
al’s13 analysis of YouTube videos on abdominal aortic aneurysms (n=51 videos). Furthermore, the total viewership of 
our 69 included videos was 257804146 views and greatly 
surpasses the total viewership reported in other studies 
on diseases the WHO has declared as pandemics (H1N1:

content that the most YouTube viewers are watching. We 
achieved this goal well with our sample size, methodology 
and total viewership of 257804146 views. The inclusion of 
only English videos presents a language bias and may limit 
the generalisability of our results to different languages and 
countries. As the literature lacks a validated tool to evaluate 
COVID-19 related content, we developed an unvalidated 
but objective COVID-19 specific scoring system to assess 
the videos included in our study. In addition, our search 
was limited to the YouTube platform and, consequently, 
YouTube videos present on other internet sites were not 
captured.
Future studies should examine YouTube content on 
COVID-19 as the pandemic progresses and YouTube 
content in other languages than English. Furthermore, 
studies to determine the propagation of YouTube videos 
onto other social media platforms such as Instagram, 
Twitter, Facebook and so on will lend additional insights 
into their impact. This information will provide public 
health officials with a better understanding of the sources 
of information the public is using to learn about the 
current COVID-19 pandemic and direct efforts to educate 
the public in future public health emergencies.
Conclusion
Among the most viewed English videos regarding 
COVID-19 on YouTube, 27.5% contained non-factual 
information originating from entertainment news, 
internet news and consumer sources, reaching 62million 
views worldwide. Videos from professional and government organisations were the most informative and had the 
highest quality content but were greatly under-represented 
in terms of viewership. As YouTube is already a dominant 
media platform, we recommend that public health agencies collaborate with a wider range of YouTube producers 
(eg, entertainment news, internet news and influential 
consumers) to disseminate high-quality video content. 
This will be an effective and immediately implementable 
public health strategy to effectively capture a wider audience from all demographic backgrounds, thus educating 
the public and minimising the spread of misinformation. 
Especially considering the worsening progression of the 
current COVID-19 pandemic, this will likely play a significant role in increasing public adherence with public health 
measures and in the collective fight against the COVID-19 
pandemic.
