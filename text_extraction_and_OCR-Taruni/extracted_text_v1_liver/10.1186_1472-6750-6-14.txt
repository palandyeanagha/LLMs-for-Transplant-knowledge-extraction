Abstract
Background: The use of highly reproducible and spatiallyhomogeneous thin film matrices permits
automated microscopy and quantitative determination of the response of hundreds of cells in a
population. Using thin films of extracellular matrix proteins, we have quantified, on a cell-by-cell
basis, phenotypic parameters of cells on different extracellular matrices. We have quantitatively
examined the relationship between fibroblast morphology and activation of the promoter for the
extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C using a tenascin-C promoter-based GFP reporter
construct.
Results: We find that when considering the average response from the population of cells, cell
area correlates with tenascin-C promoter activity as has been previously suggested; however cellby-cell analysis suggests that cell area and promoter activity are not tightly correlated within
individual cells.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates how quantitative cell-by-cell analysis, facilitated by the use
of thin films of extracellular matrix proteins, can provide insight into the relationship between
phenotypic parameters.
Background
Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins can induce diverse
intracellular signals by providing both mechanical and
chemical stimuli to cells. These intracellular signals will
mitigate and be affected by other sources of cell signals.
Because of the importance of ECM cues in signaling pathways, careful control of the ECM is extremely important
when studying downstream signaling events or cellular
response to soluble factors such as pharmaceuticals. In
this study, we demonstrate the use of highly homogeneous and reproducible thin films of collagen at two different concentrations, and thin films of fibronectin, to
provide different extracellular matrix signals to mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (NIH3T3) cells. The high level of
homogeneity of thin films affords the possibility that each
cell in a population has the same microenvironment and
therefore each has very similar stimuli.
We report here the quantification of cellular parameters,
including intracellular green fluorescent protein (GFP)

fluorescence intensity, on a cell by cell basis, for large
numbers of adhered cells. Thin films facilitate the collection of unbiased and quantitative data from many fields
of cells in an automated fashion. Because the films are
very homogeneous in thickness, autofocusing is more reliable; and because they are optically thin, background signal from scattered light is minimal.
We have directly examined the correlation between the
spreading of cells and tenascin-C (TN-C) promoter activity in cells transfected with a GFP-TN-C promoter construct. It has been frequently reported that cell
morphology and cytoskeletal arrangement appear to
influence integrin-dependent induction of gene expression [1-4]. Expression of the extracellular matrix protein,
TN-C, is an example of an apparent linkage between gene
expression and cell morphology. TN-C expression is regulated by a number of mechanisms including growth factors, biomechanical force and ECM proteins, and discrete
sites on the promoter region control these responses [5-7].
TN-C expression in fibroblasts has been shown to be associated with adhesion and spreading on fibronectin, and is
differentially responsive to various collagen preparations
[8-10]. Surfaces that support enhanced cell spreading
(fibronectin and monomeric collagen) have been
reported to induce increased TN-C promoter activity [8-
11]. Furthermore, an intact cytoskeleton appears to be
required for TN-C expression as disruption of the actin
cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D results in a reduction of
TN-C protein production in the population, even when
cells can still actively engage αvβ3 integrin [9,12].
Despite such observations suggesting a link between cell
morphology and gene expression, the precise mechanism
by which this influence occurs remains obscure. If the
pathways that determine cell morphology also influence
TN-C gene expression, we might expect a strong correlation between the two cellular parameters in each cell. To
carry out such an analysis requires assurance that the
extracellular matrix presented to cells is homogeneous
and reproducible, so that all cells are receiving the same
signals across a sample and between replicate samples.
These criteria cannot be assured for collagen gels, which
are difficult to characterize with regard to structure and
homogeneity, and are often fragile and difficult to handle.
Such an analysis also requires quantitative analysis of a
statistically significant number of adhered cells. Thus we
employed thin films of collagen and fibronectin, which
provide the homogeneity, reproducibility, and desired
optical properties.
Thin films of the ECM proteins were formed by allowing
collagen and fibronectin molecules from solution to
adsorb to a hydrophobic alkanethiol surface. Thin films of
fibronectin on alkanethiol have been fabricated and characterized by others [13-17]. We have previously reported
the preparation of thin films of Type 1 collagen, along
with extensive analysis of these films by atomic force
microscopy, ellipsometry and light microscopy [18]. Type
1 collagen readily forms large fibrils on the alkanethiol
surface in the presence of collagen in solution at concentrations >300 μg/mL. At this concentration of collagen the
fibrils formed are predominately 200 nm – 250 nm in
diameter and at least several microns in length, similar to
the dimensions of triple-helical collagen fibrils as
observed with electron microscopy [19]. We have demonstrated by comparison of a number of parameters that A10 vascular smooth muscle cells respond similarly on thin
films of collagen as they do on thick hydrogels of collagen
[18].
In this study, we use thin films of collagen and fibronectin
to collect image data on large numbers of NIH3T3 fibroblasts to quantify the occurrence of multiple parameters in
individual cells. Cell area, cytoskeletal organization, and
TN-C promoter activity as indicated by GFP expression,
are quantitatively determined on a cell-by-cell basis by
fluorescence microscopy. These data show that even
clonal populations on spatially homogeneous thin films
show a range of responses. Although fibroblasts on any
one of the homogeneous matrices show a distribution of
responses across the population, the average response and
the range of responses are distinct according to which of
the different matrices are used. We have observed on a
cell-by-cell basis that the amount of cytoskeletal staining
with phalloidin in individual cells is correlated with their
cellular area. Examination of cell area and TN-C promoter
activity as indicated by GFP intensity shows that on the
average, cell area and average GFP intensity appear to be
correlated, but cell-by-cell analysis indicates at best a very
weak correlation between cell spreading and promoter
activity within individual cells.
Results
Fibroblast morphology on thin films of extracellular matrix 
proteins
Representative images of NIH3T3 cells grown on three different collagen matrices, one hydrogel and two thin films,
and a thin film of fibronectin are shown in Figure 1. In
Figure 1A and 1B, the high density of thick collagen fibrils
is readily apparent by light microscopy. The fibrillar collagen in Figure 1B is in the form of a thick (≈0.4 mm – 1
mm) hydrogel, and is a type of collagen preparation that
has been frequently utilized as a model for in vivo Type 1
collagen [20,21]. Figure 1A depicts collagen fibrils of similar dimension as in Figure 1B, but in the form of a very
thin film of tens of nanometers in thickness, which is
formed by the polymerization of collagen from solution
(0.3 mg/mL collagen) at a surface coated with an
alkanethiol monolayer.

The thin film prepared from the lower concentration of
collagen (≈0.025 mg/mL w/v) is shown in Figure 1C. This
solution concentration of collagen is often used for coating polystyrene and glass coverslips. We have previously
demonstrated by atomic force microscopy [18] that films
of collagen formed from a low solution concentration of
collagen consist primarily of very small fibrils (<50 nm in
diameter and approximately 250 nm in length, which are
too small to be seen by light microscopy) and a very low
density of the larger fibrils that characterize the thin films
prepared from higher concentrations (> 0.3 mg/mL w/v).
The thin film shown in Figure 1D is prepared by adsorbing fibronectin to an alkanethiol monolayer. Thin films of
fibronectin have been used in a number of previous studies [13,14,16,22].
As can be seen by comparing Figure 1A and 1B with Figure
1C and 1D, cells grown on a matrix of dense fibrillar collagen, whether as a thin film or a hydrogel (Figure 1A and
1B) are more compact than cells grown on the thin films
of fibronectin (Figure 1D) or thin films prepared from
lower concentrations of collagen (Figure 1C). The cells on
the dense fibrillar collagen tend to form clusters and
exhibit few but more prominent pseudopod-like extensions. These cells assume a stellate or bipolar morphology
as previously described [23-26]. Fibroblasts cultured on
thin films of fibronectin (Figure 1D) show a well-spread
morphology consistent with previous studies [13-16].
Fibroblasts seeded onto the thin films prepared from the
lower concentration of collagen, which have a low density
of large fibrils, display an intermediate morphology with
small projections and they are more spread than cells on
the substrate of dense collagen fibrils (Figure 1C).
Quantitative analysis of cell morphology
The images shown in Figure 1 provide qualitative evidence of fibroblast morphology on these matrices. To
quantify the morphological changes, cells were stained
and examined using automated fluorescence microscopy
and image analysis software [18,27]. The staining protocol used was developed to allow us to very accurately discriminate cell edges from the background. Figure 2 shows
the distribution of cell area for the NIH3T3 fibroblasts
containing the GFP-TN-C promoter based reporter construct that were cultured for 24 hours on each of the different thin film matrices. Analysis of several hundred cells

on each surface reveals that on thin films of fibrillar collagen, most cells are less spread than most cells on the thin
films prepared from the lower concentration of collagen,
which are less spread than most cells on fibronectin. It is
notable that each cell population, while distinct from the
other populations in the extent of cell spreading, displays
a range of cell areas. This observation indicates a large
degree of heterogeneity in cellular morphology even
though the population is clonal and the surfaces are
highly homogeneous when cells are seeded onto them.
The population distributions for cell area on each of the
matrices are highly reproducible (Figure 2) suggesting that
the distributions reflect inherent variability in cell
response.
Immunofluorescent detection of actin organization and 
associated proteins
To examine some of the signaling events that may connect
morphological differences to promoter activation, we
qualitatively evaluated the presence of integrin-related
signaling proteins, and the presence of filamentous actin
(F-actin) organization. Fibroblast adhesion to native collagen is primarily mediated via interactions with the
integrins α2β1 and α1β1 [28,29], while several integrins
including αVβ3 and α5β1 mediate binding to fibronectin
[30-33]. Integrin ligation and clustering can lead to formation of focal adhesions, reorganization of the actin
cytoskeleton and activation or modulation of intracellular
signaling molecules depending upon the integrin
involved [34-36]. Transcription factors that induce TN-C
expression in response to changes in integrin engagement
have been identified [8,37,38]. Jones et al. have demonstrated a role for the ERK (extracellular signal-regulated
kinase) pathway and in more recent studies they showed
that FAK (focal adhesion kinase) activation is required for
TN-C expression [8,37]. Cells lacking FAK, or cells in
which a dominant negative FAK is introduced, have lower
levels of TN-C expression and deposition [8].
Figure 3 shows representative images of the cytoskeleton,
the focal adhesion associated protein paxillin, and FAK
phosphorylation staining in cells grown on the three different matrices. Cells grown on either the thin films prepared from the lower concentration of collagen or on the
thin films of fibronectin had more extensive plaque-like
paxillin staining localized primarily in the cell periphery
consistent with the formation of classic focal adhesion
complexes (arrowheads in panels H and I Figure 3), and
well-delineated actin stress fibers stained with phalloidin
(Panels B and C). In contrast, cells on the thin films of
fibrillar collagen (Panel G) have few if any paxillin
plaques. Instead, paxillin staining is found to be more diffuse perhaps associating with immature focal complexes
[39]. Cells on the thin film of fibrillar collagen display

very diffuse staining of phosphorylated FAK (FAK Y397)
(Figure 3D) while cells on the thin films prepared from
lower collagen concentrations or fibronectin show staining in focal adhesion-like plaques (arrows in Figure 3H
and 3I). Phalloidin staining of the actin cytoskeleton in
Figure 3 reveals little indication of stress fiber formation
in cells growing on the thin film of fibrillar collagen (Figure 3A), especially compared to those on fibronectin and
the thin films prepared from the lower concentration of
collagen (Figure 3C and 3B respectively).
The representative images shown in Figure 3 suggest that
there is an increase in the number of paxillin- and phosphorylated FAK Y397-containing focal adhesions in cells
that are better spread. The extent of spreading is reduced
on the thin films of collagen fibrils, and the formation of
dense plaques of paxillin and phosphorylated FAK Y397
staining associated with mature focal adhesions is
reduced. These data are consistent with recent reports
showing a relationship between cell spreading and the
formation of focal adhesions in endothelial cells [40,41].
The data in Figure 3 also show that cells on the thin films
of fibrillar collagen do not develop actin stress fibers.
These results are in good agreement with previous studies
of fibroblasts on fibrillar collagen preparations showing
that the cells typically display minimal actin cytoskeletal
stress fibers, a loss of vinculin and talin localization in
focal contacts, and a redistribution of tyrosine phosphorylation and α2 and β1 integrin subunits from focal adhesions [24].
Quantitative analysis of tenascin-C promoter activity
The expression of the extracellular matrix protein TN-C
has been previously linked to extent of cell spreading in
response to collagen and to fibronectin preparations [5-
9]. Cells that were able to actively spread and form focal
adhesions or to generate sufficient tension showed
increased levels of TN-C promoter activity as measured

using promoter-based reporter constructs, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and microarrays [8-10].
To measure TN-C promoter activity, we generated a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter construct consisting of
a 4.1 kilobase fragment of the TN-C promoter driving a
destabilized GFP gene, and derived single cell clonal populations of stably transfected fibroblasts containing this
construct. To quantify GFP in individual cells, cells were
fixed using a procedure that retains cellular GFP (See
Methods section), stained by the procedure used to quantify cell shape, and the image mask that corresponds to
each cell's shape was then used to delineate the area under
which GFP fluorescence was integrated. Thus, this protocol allows us to measure the intensity of GFP within each
cell as defined by the mask that is used for the determination of the morphology of that cell [27]. This protocol
allows us to examine even the cells that are not expressing
GFP. The average GFP intensity of all the cells on each of
the different matrices is shown in Figure 4A. In addition,
the intensity of each cell is plotted as part of a histogram
representation (Figure 5). Examination of hundreds of
cells on each matrix results in reproducible distributions
of GFP intensity, analogous to the distributions seen for
cell area shown in Figure 2.
The data displayed in Figure 4A indicates the average
activity of the GFP- TN-C-promoter in cells on the three
ECM matrices. In cells on fibronectin, the mean intensity
of GFP is more than twice that of cells on the thin films
prepared from the lower concentration of collagen and
more than three times that of cells on the thin films of
fibrillar collagen. Further, the data displayed in Figure 4B
show that the average area of cells on fibronectin is about
twice that of cells on thin films prepared from the lower
concentration of collagen, and about three times that of
cells on thin films of fibrillar collagen. Over all, these data
agree with previous studies suggesting that GFP- TN-Cpromoter activity is correlated with cell spreading. The
data seem to indicate that cells that are more spread
appear to have up-regulated TN-C promoter activity.
The population distribution of GFP-TN-C-promoter activity on the different matrices is shown in Figure 5. Nontransfected control cells are also shown. The intensity of
the control cells is due to autofluorescence. Some or most
of the cells on all three matrices had fluorescence that was
equivalent to the level of autofluorescence (< 100,000
A.U.). The histogram bins that correspond to fibronectin
show the presence of many cells with very high fluorescence intensity (> 400,000 A.U.) indicating that TN-C promoter activity is greatest on fibronectin films (Figure 5
inset). Cells grown on thin films prepared from the lower
concentration of collagen also appear in the higher intensity bins, but fewer of them are in the highest bins, and
more of them are in intermediate intensity bins (100,000
– 400,000 A.U.) compared to the cells on fibronectin.
Cells on thin films of fibrillar collagen show a clustering
of cells in the intermediate intensity bins, and also show
that more of the cells remain at the level of autofluorescence compared to the cells on fibronectin or on the thin
films prepared from the lower concentration of collagen.
The relative fraction of cells that are near background
autofluorescence levels (< 100,000 A.U.) is ≈50% on thin
films of fibrillar collagen, ≈23% on thin films prepared
from the lower concentration of collagen, and ≈19% on
fibronectin. The distribution of GFP intensity for each
population is also distinct from the other populations

grown on the different matrices. The population of cells
on fibronectin contains more high intensity cells
(>400,000 A.U.) compared to the population on thin
films prepared from the lower concentration of collagen,
which in turn has more bright cells than the populations
on thin films of fibrillar collagen (Figure 5 inset).
Correlating cell area and tenascin-C promoter activity and 
cytoskeleton organization
Although the mean GFP intensity and the mean cell area
appear to be correlated on each of the substrates (Figure
4), we examined whether this correlation extends to the
individual cellular level. If morphology and TN-C promoter activity were tightly correlated, we would expect
that the larger cells would express more GFP. Figure 6 panels A-C show plots of cell area and GFP intensity on a cellby-cell basis. Cells on the thin films of fibrillar collagen
(panel A), thin films prepared from the lower concentration of collagen (panel B) and fibronectin (panel C) all
fail to show a strong correlation between GFP intensity
and cell area. The correlation coefficients (R values) of
these plots as measured by the Spearman rank order correlation test are 0.22 and 0.18 with P values of 0.02 and
0.04, respectively for cells on the two collagen substrates,
with no statistically significant correlation for the cells on
fibronectin. A correlation coefficient of R = 1 indicates a
perfect positive relationship between the two variables
and the lower the P value the greater the probability that
there is a direct relationship between the two variables.
These data indicate a lack of a tight correlation between
cell area and TN-C promoter activity.
As a test of our correlation analysis we examined the relationship between cytoskeleton organization and cell
spreading. For this analysis, we used the same protocols
for cell area determination, and the same microscopy and
image analysis protocols, but examined nontransfected
cells stained with fluorescently labeled phalloidin instead
of examining them for GFP expression. These data are
shown in Figure 6 panels D, E, F. Analysis using the Spearman rank order correlation test confirms that a strong correlation on a cell by cell basis exists between cell size and
F-actin staining intensity. The measurement of the
strength of the relationship between cell size and phalloidin staining resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.59,
0.64 and 0.65 with P < 0.0001 for cells grown on thin

suggested [42,43] whether the cells are on collagen or

Discussion
In this study, we examined large numbers of individual
cells, and quantified the extent of cell spreading and the
activity of a reporter construct composed of a fragment of
the TN-C promoter driving a degenerate version of
enhanced GFP. This variant of GFP is reported to have a
half-life in cells of 2 h; this allows prediction that a little

more than 10% of the GFP is remaining in the cell 6 h
after initiation of GFP expression. We used these data to
query the relationship between GFP expression and cell
morphology. The studies that have provided evidence for
the role of integrin-ECM interactions in the modulation of
TN-C promoter activity [8-10], and have reported apparent correlations between cell spreading, actin assembly,
stress fiber formation and FAK activation with TN-C promoter activity [8-12] have largely utilized Western blotting, DNA analysis, and other techniques that provide
data on the average response of the population. When fluorescence microscopy has been used, it has involved a
limited number of cells. Similarly in this study, we
observed that cell populations that exhibit larger average
cell area in response to the extracellular matrix also exhibit
higher average TN-C promoter activity. Interestingly, cellby-cell analysis, which allows us to examine the correlation between TN-C promoter activity and cell morphology on a per-cell basis, reports only at best a weak
correlation between TN-C promoter activity and morphology within individual cells.
The thin film technologies used here provide the means of
producing an ECM that can be quantitatively characterized and systematically modified to vary the characteristics of the ECM presented to cells. The different ECM
surfaces employed in this study vary in chemical moieties
available for integrin engagement (collagen versus
fibronectin) and in the density of large collagen fibrils
(resulting from low and high concentrations of collagen).
The collagen surface preparations used here provide the
same chemical recognition sites to cells as has been shown
previously by anti-beta 1 integrin blocking studies [44],
yet result in different cellular phenotypes. We hypothesize
that these collagen surfaces provide different mechanical
signals to the cells by virtue of the presence or absence of
large collagen fibrils. They also vary in their topography.
We are currently expanding the use of thin films to further
our understanding of the separate roles that topography
and mechanical properties play in cellular response.
Another advantage of the use of thin films of extracellular
matrix proteins is that they facilitate unbiased automated
fluorescence microscopy data collection and analysis. The
three dimensional homogeneity of the thin film and the
low level of scattered light makes it easier to automate the
collection of data from large numbers of cells. Cell by cell
analysis permits direct observation of multiple parameters
within individual cells, allowing statistically relevant cell
by cell correlations to be determined. Flow cytometry can,
of course, also be used to collect multiparametric data
from a statistically significant numbers of individual cells.
However, flow cytometry requires dissociation of cells
from their matrix, eliminating the ability to measure cellsubstrate interactions and cell spreading, which microscopic analysis with thin film matrices allows. The ability
to examine large numbers of adherent cells quantitatively
also provides the potential to examine the development
of intracellular signaling pathway networks in live cells in
the temporal regime.
Our examination of the response of individual fibroblasts
within a population reveals that all cells do not respond
identically, but that the population displays a range of
responses in area of spreading, intensity of F-actin staining and GFP expression. These distribution patterns are
highly reproducible but distinctly dependent on the identity of the ECM matrix. A distribution in phenotypic
response is observed even though cells are daughters of a
single cell clone and the thin film surfaces on which they
are seeded are initially highly homogeneous as verified by
AFM, ellipsometry, and light microscopy. While it not the
immediate focus of this report, our observations beg the
question of how the distributions of responses arise. Preliminary data indicate that the observed distributions do
not arise simply as a result of cells in the population being
in different stages in the cell cycle. Flow cytometry analysis
of propidium iodide stained cells showed that for cells
kept for 16 h in medium containing 0.1% serum, 80% of
the cells were in the G0/G1 phase, compared to cells left
in medium containing 10% serum, in which case 62% of
the population were in G0/G1. Yet when plated on thin
films of collagen, serum starved cells showed nearly identical distributions in cell area and GFP expression as cells
that were not serum starved [see Additional File 1]. Spontaneous instabilities in the cellular genome due to extensive passage does not appear to be a factor, since the
distributions are observed in very early passage cells as
well as in cells examined at later passages. For the results
shown in Figures 2, 4, 5 and 6, the cells were in passage
number 12. The cell cycle experiment shown in Additional File 1 was conducted with cells in passage number
29. We have observed that when these cells are kept in
continuous culture for as many as 86 passages there is a
shift in the distribution of areas relative to the phenotype
of younger cells; however, the population continues to
display a similar shape in distribution of cell areas.
The observed distributions thus appear to be unique
reproducible signatures of the cellular response to the
environment and allow statistical evaluation of population heterogeneity. The distribution may reflect statistical
fluctuations in intracellular reactions. The effect that stochastic fluctuations in intracellular reactions can have on
phenotype has been demonstrated, for example, by
Pedraza and van Oudenaarden [45]. These investigators
treated the distribution of responses within a population
of E. coli cells to model fluctuations in gene expression
and determine the effect of fluctuations in one gene on
expression of other linked or independent genes. Using a

BMC Biotechnology 2006, 6:14 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/6/14

(page number not for citation purposes)
designed gene network, they demonstrated the large
effects that global fluctuations can have on gene expression, including the appearance of increases, step functions
and decreases in gene expression as a function of
upstream noise. In a complex network such as that which
controls TN-C promoter activity, it is perhaps not surprising that correlations between TN-C promoter activity and
other cellular parameters might be observed on the average, but not in each cell. For a complex eukaryotic system
such as TN-C reporter activity in fibroblasts, such noise
could be the result of fluctuations in enzymatic reactions
leading to activation of the TN-C promoter effectors, or
the net response to a combination of promoter effectors
acting at different sites on the TN-C promoter. The TN-C
promoter is composed of discrete response elements for
ECM, stress, and serum, all of which likely play a role in
TN-C promoter expression in this study [5-7].
The 24 h time point examined in this experiment is a
'snap-shot' of cell response to the surfaces. Ideally, full
characterization of the cellular response would involve
quantifying the cell area and GFP intensity in live cells at
many time points over an extended period of time. This is
experimentally challenging, but is something our lab is
currently working on. Non-quantitative examination of
live cells over time indicates that after the first few hours
cells reach their fully spread condition, and the variation
in the extent of spreading of each cell after that time is
small relative to the range of variation seen over the entire
population; this appears to be true for GFP expression as
well [see Additional File 2]. It can be seen that over a 6
hour time frame, each cell exhibits changes in fluorescence intensity and cell area. However, by watching the
least spread cells it is apparent that they never become
large; weak GFP expressers never become bright; the most
spread cells never become as small as the least spread
cells; and the bright cells never return to the level of
autofluorescence. Nevertheless, the population always
exhibits very small cells, very large cells, very bright cells
and very dim cells, and intermediate phenotypes. These
preliminary data suggest that our 24 h 'snap-shot' is relevant to the response of the population at any time after
spreading. It also suggests that the range of variations that
occur over the entire population is not due to temporal
fluctuations experienced by any individual cell. Thus the
distributions reflect a population parameter, and are not
representative of the behavior of an individual cell.
Conclusion
The thin film ECM protein surfaces used in this study possess excellent optical properties for microscopy. This
makes it possible to more accurately measure the response
of cells on Type 1 collagen than is possible with collagen
gels. The use of thin films of ECM proteins provides a high
degree of control over surface reproducibility and homogeneity and increases the likelihood that each cell experiences the same microenvironment. Combined with
appropriate methodologies for fixing and staining cells,
quantitative determination of intracellular fluorescence
can be determined on large numbers of cells in an automated fashion. Our data show quantitatively the range of
responses that cells display in area of spreading, intensity
of F-actin staining, and GFP-TN-C promoter expression.
The highly reproducible distributions in phenotypic
response occur even though all cells are derived from a
single clone and are exposed to a highly homogeneous
ECM environment, suggesting that the distributions may
be the result of stochastic noise in intracellular processes.
In this study, we observed that cell populations that
exhibit larger average cell area in response to the matrix
also exhibit higher average TN-C promoter activity. Interestingly, cell-by-cell analysis indicates at best a weak correlation between TN-C promoter activity and morphology
within individual cells. The quantitative approaches
described here will make possible the further analysis of
stochastic influences on phenotype under various ECM
conditions and better enable delineation of causal relationships between intracellular parameters.
Methods1
All reagents were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) unless indicated otherwise.
Preparation of collagen surfaces
The preparation of millimeter thick hydrogels of native
fibrillar collagen and thin films of collagen on gold coated
coverslips has been described previously [18,27]. Briefly,
purified type I collagen was purchased as a solution of
acid-stabilized monomer (Vitrogen; Cohesion Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The collagen solution (0.8 mL,
≈3 mg/mL, 4°C) was neutralized with 0.1 mL of 10× Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) (4°C) and 0.1
mL of NaOH (0.1 M, 4°C), and was kept at 4°C to minimize polymerization. To generate the fibrillar gels gaskets
(≈16 mm inside diameter, 22 mm outside diameter) were
cut from paper labels (Fasson label material, Avery Dennison, Brea, CA) and adhered onto cleaned coverslips before
sterilization with 70% ethanol. Neutralized native collagen solution (100 μL) was applied to the dried coverslip
making sure that solution fully contacted the paper gaskets. The samples were placed at 37°C overnight to initiate fibrillogenesis. The native collagen hydrogels were
carefully rinsed and stored in DPBS at 4°C until they were
used.
To prepare thin films for collagen and fibronectin, coverslips were coated with a 5 nm layer of chromium and a 15
nm – 20 nm layer of gold by magnetron sputtering. The
semi-transparent gold-coated coverslips were immersed

BMC Biotechnology 2006, 6:14 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/6/14

(page number not for citation purposes)
in 0.5 mM 1-hexadecanethiol (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) in
ethanol for at least 8 hours before being rinsed with ethanol and dried with filtered N2. Thin films of fibrillar collagen were generated by adding neutralized solutions of
native collagen solution (4°C, ≈0.4 mg/mL) to the
alkanethiol-treated gold-coated coverslips and incubating
overnight at 37°C. After incubation, the samples were
slowly lifted out of the gelled collagen solutions, and
rinsed with a stream of DPBS and then water from sterile
Teflon squirt bottles (Nalgene Nunc, Rochester, NY).
Once all loosely adhered gel was removed, the samples
were dried under a stream of filtered N2 and immediately
placed back into a DPBS solution. Thin films were also
produced from a lower solution concentration of collagen
by immersing alkanethiol-treated gold-coated glass coverslips into a solution of ≈0.025 mg/mL collagen in DPBS.
The samples were incubated at 37°C for at least 12 hours,
rinsed in DPBS and water, dried under a stream of filtered
N2 and stored in DPBS at 4°C before they were used with
cells. Ellipsometry studies of the thin films of collagen
show that the preparations generated from the 0.4 mg/mL
native collagen solution have an average thickness of 40
nm while those prepared from the lower solution of collagen (0.025 mg/mL) are 6 nm on average with a standard
deviation of film thickness of less than 10% for both preparations. The homogeneity of surface coverage, evaluated
by comparing the thickness of several areas on each sample by ellipsometry indicated that the standard deviation
across the samples was less than 4% [27]. To produce thin
films of fibronectin, alkanethiol-treated gold-coated glass
coverslips were incubated in the presence of 25 μg/mL
solution of bovine fibronectin for at least 5 hours at 4°C,
rinsed in DPBS and water, dried under a stream of filtered
N2 and stored in DPBS at 4°C. Ellipsometry indicates that
the fibronectin layer has a thickness of 4.5 ± 0.5 nm. Prior
to seeding cells on the ECM substrates, the thin films and
thicker hydrogels were conditioned for a minimum of 30
minutes with cell culture medium containing 5% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Cell culture
NIH3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM;
Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, glutamine, penicillin (100 units/mL),
streptomycin (100 μg/mL), 10% by volume FBS and 25
mM HEPES, and maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 balanced-air atmosphere at 37°C. Sub-confluent cultures
were switched to supplemented DMEM containing 5% (v/
v) FBS 24 hours prior to an experiment. Cells were
removed from tissue culture polystyrene flasks by trypsinization, washed with DMEM/5% FBS, centrifuged for 5
minutes at 200 g and plated in DMEM/5% FBS onto the
ECM preparations at a density of 2000 cells/cm2. Care was
taken to ensure the seeding density was homogeneous
over the surface of the substrates. This level of serum of
5% was chosen due to the results of preliminary experiments to examine the relative strength of the serum
response element of the TN promoter compared to the
biomechanical force and matrix response elements. We
chose 5% serum to assure that cell response to the matrix
was not overshadowed by the response to serum.
GFP reporter construct
The TN-1/pEGFP construct containing a 4.1 kilobase fragment of the TN-C promoter was generously provided by
Dr. Peter L. Jones (University of Pennsylvania) [37]. The
sequences encoding enhanced GFP were removed from
this construct using restriction enzymes Sal I and Not I followed by gel purification. A fragment of DNA encoding a
degenerate variant of enhanced GFP, with a half-life of 2
hours as reported by the manufacturer, was removed from
the vector pd2EGFP-1 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto,
CA) using similar restriction enzymes, was gel purified
and the resulting 860 base pair fragment was ligated into
to the TN-C promoter generating TN-1/pd2EGFP-1.
NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the degenerate
enhanced GFP-TN-C promoter based reporter construct
using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as
per manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, 1.5 × 106
cells were plated into a 6 well plate 16 hours prior to the
transfection in medium lacking antibiotics. A mixture
containing 1.5 μg DNA and 8 μL Lipofectamine was
added dropwise to cells. Following a 6 hour incubation,
fresh medium containing 10% FBS was added to the cells.
Cells were maintained in selection medium containing
G418/Geneticin (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (400
ug/mL) for fourteen days. Two rounds of limited dilution
cloning were used to assure that the resulting cell line was
derived from a single cell. This clonal population was
used for all reporter based experiments. Passage number
was designated from the time of isolation of the final subclone. The clone used for this study has been cryopreserved at low passage numbers to allow us to use relatively
low passage number cells for replicate experiments at different times. In the course of this study, we have also
begun to examine how passage number and cryopreservation quantitatively influence cell response. For the data
shown in Figures 2, 4, 5 and 6, cells were used at passage
number 12. For the data shown in Additional File 1, the
cells were used at passage number 29.
Cell fixation and staining for automated data analysis
Substrates were removed from the incubator after 24
hours, rinsed with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS;
ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) supplemented with 10
mM HEPES and fixed for 24 hours at room temperature in
100 mM PIPES, 1 mM EGTA, 4% PEG [46] containing 100
ug/mL 3-malemido-benzoic acid-NHS ester (MBS, Sigma)
as the cross-linker [47]. Cells were permeabilized in

0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 in DPBS, rinsed in DPBS, and
incubated with DPBS containing Texas Red-C2-Maleimide (1 ng/mL) as a general stain and 0.05% (v/v) 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) as a nuclear
counter stain. After 2 hours at room temperature, 1%
Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was added to quench the
conjugation reaction. The substrates were then rinsed with
DPBS and were mounted onto thin glass slides with 9:1
glycerol:Tris, pH 8.0. In separate control experiments, we
have determined that this fixation procedure results in the
retention of >90% of the original GFP of the cells (Elliott
et al., in preparation). The fixed and stained cells were
examined by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy
using a 10× objective on an inverted microscope (Zeiss
Axiovert S100TV, Thornwood, NJ) outfitted with a computer controlled stage (LEP, Hawthorne, NY), an excitation filter wheel (LEP, Hawthorne, NY), and a CCD
camera (CoolSnap fx, Roper Scientific Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). Hardware operation, and image digitization and
analysis were under software control (ISee Imaging, Cary,
NC) [18,27]. A modular software routine controlled automated movement of the stage, auto-focusing, and collection of data from 50 to100 independent fields (of 870 μm
× 690 μm in size) of cells per sample. Auto-focusing was
performed on each field while examining the Texas Red
fluorescence. The computer-controlled routine involves
sequential steps of moving the objective lens relative to
the sample to find the objective position that results in
maximum variance in intensities within the field. For each
field, cellular fluorescence from Texas Red, FITC or GFP,
and DAPI were collected by automated switching of the
appropriate excitation and emission filters and passing
the emitted light through a multipass beam splitter (set#
84000; Chroma Technology Inc., Brattleboro, VT). The
area of each individual cell, and the numbers of cells in
each field were determined with image analysis software
(ISee Imaging, Cary, NC) as previously described [18,27].
Briefly, appropriate thresholding criteria allowed cell
areas, as determined by areas containing Texas Red fluorescence, to be accurately segmented from the non-fluorescent non-cell areas. Fluorescence background around
each cell in the GFP and FITC phalloidin stained images
was determined by measuring the average background
intensity in a defined region just outside the cell area mask
described above. The defined region around each cell was
generated by systematically enlarging (dilating) the original cell mask The number of nuclei, and therefore the
number of cells, was determined from the corresponding
images collected with the DAPI filter. Total intensity for
the fluorophore in the images was calculated as follows:
mean intensity outside the cell was subtracted from the
mean intensity within the cell, and the result was multiplied by the cell area. It is likely that each entire cell is sampled because, in addition to auto-focusing, the objective
lens used (10× magnification and 2.5 numerical aperture)
has a depth of field of 8.5μm, which is on the order of the
full thickness of the fibroblasts. Images were collected by
moving the stage automatically in 1 mm steps. Morphology and fluorescence intensity were determined for at
least 150 individual cells on each substrate.
Immunofluorescence and phalloidin staining
For immunostaining of actin, paxillin, and phosphorylated FAK Y397, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in DPBS (5
minutes), blocked with DPBS containing 30 mg/mL BSA
(blocking solutions) and 50 mg/mL donkey or goat serum
at room temperature (1 hour). Appropriate samples were
stained overnight at 4°C with 5 μg/mL rabbit anti-phospho FAK Y397 (Biosource, Camarilo, CA) or 20 μg/mL antipaxillin (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), in
blocking solution. The samples were rinsed multiple
times in DPBS and incubated with 10 μg/mL rhodaminelabeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or Alexa 556 goat anti-mouse as appropriate, in
blocking solution at room temperature (1 hour). For filamentous actin (F-actin) staining, cells fixed and permeabilized as above were blocked with DPBS containing 30
mg/mL BSA (30 minutes), stained with Alexa 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) in blocking solution
(250 nM, 1 hour), and rinsed with blocking solution. The
immunostained and phalloidin-stained samples were
rinsed extensively with DPBS and samples were mounted
on slides in Tris buffered saline containing 90% glycerol,
2.5 mg/mL DABCO and 0.05 μg/mL DAPI. Cells were
imaged with phase and fluorescence microscopy using the
appropriate filter sets.
Statistical analysis
Differences between mean values of GFP intensities and
cell area for cells on the various surfaces were tested for
statistical significance using a one way analysis of variance
test in Sigma Stat software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test for pairwise comparison of cellular behavior (area or GFP intensity) on each substrate. A calculated p value of < 0.05 was
considered significant in these comparisons.
The correlation between two variables was tested for statistical significance using Spearman rank order correlation
test in Sigma Stat software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). The
Spearman correlation measures the strength of association between pairs of variables which cannot be described
as having a normal distribution with constant variance,
which is the case for the cell area data, the phalloidin data
and the GFP intensity data The correlation coefficient, r is
a number that varies between -1 and +1 with a correlation
of +1 indicating a perfect positive relationship between
the two variables, with both variables always increasing
together. A P value (the probability of being incorrect in

concluding that there is a true association between the
variables) was calculated and the lower the P value the
greater the probability that there is a direct relationship
between the two variables. P < 0.05 was considered significant in these comparisons.

Live NIH3T3 TN-1/pd2EGFP-1 cells on fibronectin films. Cells were 
kept at 37°C in an incubator chamber on the microscope stage. Images 
were taken after cells were fully spread (after at least 2 hours after seeding) at 5 min intervals for a total time of 6 h. Three cells are outlined in 
several frames in the sequence for ease of viewing.
