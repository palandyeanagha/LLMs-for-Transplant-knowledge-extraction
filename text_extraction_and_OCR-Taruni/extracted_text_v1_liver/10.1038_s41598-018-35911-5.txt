Nonanatomic resection is not 
inferior to anatomic resection 
for primary intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma: A propensity 
score analysis
B. Li, J. L. Song, Y.Aierken, Y. Chen, J. L. Zheng & J.Y.Yang
Whether anatomic resection (AR) achieves better outcomes than nonanatomic resection (NAR) in 
patients with primary intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is unclear. Data were retrieved for all 
consecutive patients who underwent liver resection for primary ICC from January 2007 to July 2017. The 
prognoses of the patients without direct invasion to contiguous organs or extrahepatic metastasis who 
underwent AR or NAR were compared. 85 patients underwent AR, and 65 patients underwent NAR. 
operation time were slightly decreased in the NAR group. The risk of Clavien-Dindo classifcation (CDC) 
IV in the AR group was signifcant higher than that in the NAR group. Cox regression analysis showed 
lymph node metastasis and adjuvant therapy were signifcant prognostic factors for overall survival 
(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively. After 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), 29 pairs 
of patients were compared. The survival curves showed the NAR group had slightly improved DFS and 
OS than the AR group before and after matching. Thus, we conclude NAR was not inferior to AR in 
improving the survival outcomes for patients with primary solitary ICC lesions without direct invasion to 
contiguous organs or extrahepatic metastasis. Furthermore, patients may beneft from NAR.
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common malignant hepatic tumour and accounts for 
5% to 30% of all primary liver malignancies1–4
. Hepatic resection remains the frst-line therapeutic option for cure 
of primary malignant liver tumors, and it is a surgical option for a broad range of patients with various stages of 
disease, as long as the patient has been with adequate liver remnant. Te extent of resection for primary malignant 
liver tumors has been a topic of much interest. Anatomic resection (AR) is defned as the removal of a “hepatic 
segment or sub-segment, which include tumorbearing portal tributaries as well as major branch of the portal 
vein and hepatic artery”5
. In theory, AR may be more efective in removing the entire tumor burden including 
possible satellites, nodules, as well as any high risk area of micro-portal invasion and intra-hepatic metastasis. On 
the other hand, parenchymal sparing or non-anatomic resection (NAR) ofers less extensive liver resection that, 
in turn, may be associated with lower perioperative morbidity, as well as a lower incidence of an inadequate future 
liver remnant (FLR) and liver insufciency6
. Intrahepatic recurrence is regarded as occurring primarily through 
vascular invasion for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with AR considered theoretically efective 
for eradicating these intrahepatic metastases5,7

 originally introduced comparative studies 
AR vs NAR for single HCC lesions, and the potential beneft of AR for HCC lesions has been indicated8–12. For 
example, a systematic review and meta-analysis13 reported AR was associated with a disease-free survival (DFS) 
beneft at 1-, 3- and 5- years (p=0.002, p=0.004 and p<0.0001, respectively) and also was associated with a 
decreased risk of death at 5-years (p=0.01); however, an original study14 showed there was no diference in overall recurrence-free survival between the AR and NAR groups (P=0.290). To our knowledge, the 5-year OS rate of 
ICC patients is reported from 30% to 35% afer hepatectomy7
. However, few studies have investigated the clinical 
outcomes between AR and NAR for ICC. In this study, we aimed to compare the perioperative outcomes and

prognoses of patients between the AR and NAR groups with primary solitary ICC lesions without direct invasion 
to contiguous organs or extrahepatic metastasis using a one to one propensity score matching (PSM) analysis.
Results
Baseline patient and Clinicopathological characteristics. Patients were followed until the date 
of death or the fnal date of the study, December 30, 2017. A total of 150 patients underwent hepatectomy for 
primary solitary ICC lesions without direct invasion to contiguous organs or extrahepatic metastasis. Tese 
patients were followed for 3 to 107 months (median 12 months). Te majority of patients were male (n=93, 
62.0%). More than half of the patients presented with a tumour size ≤5 cm (n=80, 53.3%). Of note, half of the 
patients were positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (n=76, 50.7%), and presented with cirrhosis 
(n=83, 55.3%). Only 9.3% patients had intrahepatic biliary stones (n=14). Specifcally, vascular invasion, periductal invasion, and perineural invasion were only observed in 17.3% (n=26), 2.7% (n=4), and 4.7% (n=7) 
of tumours, respectively. Poorly diferentiated lesions were found in 34.7% (n=52) of patients, metastatic nodal 
disease was observed in 12.7% (n=19) of these patients, and a positive resection margin was found in 8 (5.3%) 
patients. Regarding liver function, as defned by the Child-Pugh classifcation, 131 (87.3%) patients were class 
A, and 7 (4.7%) were class B; Of these 150 patients, 85 (56.7%) underwent AR, and 65 (43.3%) underwent NAR. 
Patients undergoing NAR were younger, more likely to be positive for HBsAg (NAR vs. AR; 60.0% VS 43.5%, 
P=0.046), and more ofen presented with cirrhosis (NAR vs. AR; 66.2% VS 47.1%, P=0.02). NAR was more frequently performed among patients who had small tumors. Patients undergoing NAR were also more likely to have 
advanced disease characterized by poor tumor diferentiation (Table 1). Interestingly, patients who underwent a 
NAR were more likely to have a microscopically positive margin than patients who underwent AR (p=0.001). 
Post-operatively, of these patients, 31 (40.8%) patients received antiviral therapy, and 43 (28.7%) patients received 
adjuvant therapy, including adjuvant chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, and re-operation (Table 1). Notebly, NAR had more tumour distributing in the right liver than AR (NAR 
vs. AR; 73.8% VS 36.5%, P<0.001) (Supplementary Table S1).
Association of surgical procedure with Short and Long-Term Outcomes. Tere were no diference 
of Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intra- and postoperative transfusion, and the length of postoperative hospital stay between the two groups (Table 1). Postoperative complications were stratifed according 
to the Clavien-Dindo classifcation (CDC)15. Consequently, almost three of fve patients (n=40, 61.5%) developed a postoperative complications following NAR versus about three of four patients (n=62, 72.9%) afer AR 
(p=0.138). Moreover, CDC IV was more common afer AR versus NAR (p=0.019), while CDC I, CDC II and 
CDC III were comparable (p=0.138, p=0.057 and p=0.133, respectively, Table 2). Both groups were comparable with surgical technique-related (ascites, bile leakage, liver failure, cholangitis, and intra-abdominal bleeding), 
medical (pneumonia, pleural efusion, respiratory failure, and cardiac events), and infectious (systemic) complications (Table 2). No patients died in the hospital.
During the follow-up period, tumour recurrence developed in 79 (52.7%) patients, with recurrent lesions 
most commonly developing in the remnant liver (n=58, 73.4%), and 70 patients (46.7%) died. Te 1-, 3-, and 
5-year DFS rates were 50.9%, 32.8%, and 32.8% in the NAR group and 48.9%, 27.2%, and 27.2% in the AR group 
(P=0.607, Fig. 1), respectively. Te 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 75.2%, 47.0%, and 25.7% in the NAR group 
and 65.0%, 35.4%, and 29.1% in the AR group (P = 0.477, Fig. 2), respectively. A Cox regression model was 
performed to identify risk factors associated with DFS and OS of these 150 patients. On multivariable analysis, 
adjuvant therapy was associated with better DFS (HR 0.757, [95% CI, 0.605–0.949], p=0.016) (Table 3), lymph 
node metastasis was associated with worse OS (HR 1.972, [95% CI, 1.039–3.743], p=0.038) (Table 4). To better 
account for any residual confounding due to case mix, a sensitivity analysis investigating the association of surgical procedure with DFS and OS was performed within a matched patient cohort. Patients were matched based 
on propensity scores obtained from a logistic regression model accounting for patient, operation and tumour 
characteristics. Based on this 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) approach, 29 NAR patients and 29 AR patients 
were matched (Table 1). In the propensity model, both groups had equivalent DFS (the 1-, 3- and 5-year DFS 
rates (NAR vs. AR; 58.6%, 41.0% and 41.0% vs. 53.2%, 19.2% and 19.2%, p=0.370, Fig. 3)) and OS (the 1-, 3- and 
5-year OS rates (NAR vs. AR; 71.1%, 51.7% and 51.7% vs. 70.2%, 22.9% and 22.9%, p=0.229, Fig. 4)).
Discussion
To date, partial hepatectomy remains the mainstay of curative treatment for ICC16,17. Unfortunately, prognosis 
afer partial hepatectomy is unsatisfactory, with a high incidence of locoregional recurrence and/or extrahepatic 
metastasis and a low 5-year OS rate18–20. In the 1980 s, Muccuchi et al.

 proposed AR in hepatectomy for HCC. 
Previous studies8–12 showed the beneft of AR for single HCC lesions. Both ICC and HCC arise in the hepatic 
parenchyma. However, the extent of hepatic resection and its impact on outcomes among patients with ICC has 
not been well examined. Tus, whether the application of AR or NAR can improve the prognosis of ICC patients 
is worthy to investigate. Selection biases are inevitable in retrospective comparisons of postoperative outcomes in 
patients who underwent AR and NAR for ICC. To better account for any residual confounding due to case mix, 
we adjusted the clinicopathological characteristics of patients to eliminate as much selection bias as possible by 
excluding patients with multiple lesions, adjacent organ invasion, and extrahepatic metastasis. Furthermore, the 
clinicopathological characteristics of patients were adjusted by 1:1 PSM.
In the current study, patients who underwent AR tended to have larger tumors, the NAR group had more 
patients with positivity of HBsAg and liver cirrhosis. Previous study6
 had pointed that the ideal surgical approach 
to hepatic resection of primary liver carcinoma should optimize locoregional control, yet preserve as much nontumorous hepatic parenchyma in the FLR. Teoretically, wider margins may ofer a better chance of disease 
control, whereas a more limited resection allows for the preservation of hepatic parenchyma and mitigation of the

risk for liver insufciency12,21,22. Tus, patients with large tumors may, however, simply be more likely to undergo 
AR versus NAR as larger tumors may necessitate major resections to achieve an negative margin.
As mentioned above about the defnition of AR and NAR. We can see the extent of liver resection is greater in 
AR than in NAR. Teoretically, the risk of postoperative liver failure is higher in AR, especially in patients who 
have comorbidities such as liver cirrhosis, the advantage of NAR is related to the postoperative liver function 
reserve. Decreases in albumin, prothrombin time, and cholinesterase during the frst year afer surgery were 
reported to be lower in patients who underwent NAR than in patients who underwent AR23. Tus, patients with 
hepatic tumours have concomitant injury to the nonmalignant liver parenchyma, a smaller range of resections 
can result in better restoration and/or preservation of the liver function24–26. Meanwhile, for patients with high 
risk of liver failure due to the low FLR, portal vein embolization can be performed to induce compensatory hypertrophy of the remnant liver and thus increase the safety of major hepatectomy27.
Diferent from previous studies12,28, the present study showed that the intraoperative bleeding and intraoperative blood transfusion had no signifcant diference between groups before and afer matching, this may be 
due to AR are ofen performed under infow occlusion of the liver by a Pringle maneuver28 in order to minimize 
bleeding during the transection phase. In addition, operation time were slightly decreased in the NAR group, 
but there were no signifcant diference between groups. Interestingly, in our current analysis, we found NAR 
group had more patients with tumour lesions located in the right liver than AR group, generally, the time spent at 
resection of the right liver tumour is longer than that of the lef liver tomour, this might be explained by the fact 
that the right liver resection was more difcult than the lef. Tat is, operation time in NAR group was less than 
in AR group. Furthermore, hepatic resection can be associated with a certain degree of peri-operative morbidity and mortality. In the current analysis, the length of hospital stay and the overall incidence of complications 
were largely comparable among patients who underwent AR versus NAR. Meanwhile, there were no signifcant 
diferences of CDC I, CDC II, CDC III or CDC V between groups. However, notably, the risk of CDC IV in the 
AR group was signifcant higher than that in the NAR group. In addition, the incidence of postoperative hepatic 
failure, bile leakage and intra-abdominal bleeding as well as perioperative mortality did not difer between the 
two groups. Additionally, the occurrence of a postoperative complication has previously been reported to be an 
independent predictor of worse long-term outcomes29. However, we didn’t fnd the similar result, furthermore, 
a previous study30 found that the impact of major complications on survival was primarily in the immediate

post-operative period rather than in the long term. Tus, these data suggest that the overall perioperative outcomes can be superior for NAR.
Regarding the clinicopathological factors afecting OS and DFS in patients with macroscopically solitary ICC 
lesions, univariate analysis showed that positivity of HBsAg was associated with worse DFS and OS. Tus, positivity for HBsAg was a risk factor for DFS and OS. However, in disagreement with a previous study31, this study 
showed antiviral therapy for HBV-related ICC patients didn’t improve survival outcomes. Tis maybe due to the 
comparable liver function or stable low level of virus reproduction. Consistent with previous studies31,32, vascular 
invasion was associated with worse OS, However, in the current study, the two groups had no signifcant diference of vascular invasion, thus, whether the AR is beneft for ICC patients with vascular invasion needs further

study. Meanwhile, the results of our Cox regression analysis showed lymph node metastasis and adjuvant therapy were signifcant prognostic factors for OS and DFS, respectively. Similar to previous study33,34, lymph node 
metastasis was a risk factor for survival, however, there is no clear consensus on whether lymph nodes should 
be dissected35,36, and this aspect requires further research. Whilst the present study found the adjuvant therapy 
may improve the prognosis. Furthermore, previous study37 suggested that the neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies 
may improve the prognosis of ICC patients especially for those with positive surgical margin. A meta-analysis38
demonstrated that adjuvant therapy benefted biliary cancer patients with node-positive or R1 disease.
In this study, the survival curves showed the NAR group had slightly improved DFS and OS than the AR 
group before and afer matching, yet with no signifcant statistically diferences. Similarly, a Japanese retrospective

exposure may provide longer tumor-free and overall survival. Tat is, the NAR had better survival outcomes than 
the AR especially for the patients with liver cirrhosis. In fact, several previous studies23,40 have noted that preservation of liver parenchyma should take priority, and minor hepatectomy can provide equal OS and DFS compared 
with major hepatectomy for small HCC.
In addition, some previous studies41,42 found that HCC and ICC tended more often to have associated 
micro-metastasis and disseminated via portal venous branches. Tus, local recurrence (LR) may be due to residual intrahepatic metastasis spreading through the portal venous system, which cannot be detected before and 
during surgery. AR based on the Couinaud system requires a complete removal of at least one Couinaud segment

30 found that patients undergoing major resection had 
similar outcomes to patients undergoing minor resection, as long as the surgical margin was wider than 5 mm. 
In contrast, when the surgical margin was narrow (1–4mm), major resection was associated with a decrease in 
tumor recurrence compared with minor resection. Terefore, that is, both surgical margin and resection volume 
can impact the survival outcomes.
Te current study found the NAR group had more patients with positive surgical margin, however, survival analysis showed that the surgical margin had no signifcant efect on DFS or OS before or afer matching. 
Generally, the distance between surgical margin and lesion is greater in AR than in NAR; thus, theoretically, the 
NAR group had a higher potential of positive surgical margin than the AR group. Furthermore, previous studies43,44 reported that the residual tumor on the resection margin may grow and spread in a much more aggressive 
pattern, which may result in the early recurrence and poor OS. A systematic review and meta-analysis45 found 
that Patients with negative surgical margin had signifcantly favorable OS and progression-free survival afer 
surgical resection for ICC. Similarly, Spolverato G, et al.
46 had conclued, for patients undergoing resection of 
ICC, a positive margin was associated with an inferior long-term outcome. In addition, there was an incremental 
worsening DFS and OS as margin width decreased from 1 cm. Tus, one possible explanation for the results of the 
current study is that a higher application rate of adjuvant treatment in the NAR group. And as previous study37
mentioned, the patients with positive margin may beneft more from adjuvant therapy. In other words, the adjuvant therapy may improve the suvrvival of ICC patients especially for those with NAR. However, more studies are 
needed to validate these fndings.
Tis study has several limitations, the main limitation is its retrospective design. And unmeasured diferences 
between the 2 groups could potentially lead to confounding efects. Te results are also limited by the small 
sample size. Tus, randomized controlled trials are needed to further determine whether NAR is superior to AR.
Tese fndings suggest that ICC patients may receive more benefts from NAR than that from AR, especially 
for patients with liver cirrhosis due to the lower risk of CDC-IV such as liver failure. Tus, we conclude NAR was 
not inferior to AR in improving the survival outcomes for patients with primary solitary ICC lesions without 
direct invasion to contiguous organs or extrahepatic metastasis. Furthermore, patients may beneft from NAR.
Methods
Data Sources and Study Population. Data for all consecutive patients who underwent liver resection 
for primary solitary ICC lesions at West China Hospital of SiChuan University, China, from January 2007 to July 
2017 were retrieved from a prospective database for this study. Te Institutional Review Board of West China 
Hospital of SiChuan University approved this study, confrm that the study was performed in accordance with 
relevant guidelines/regulations and informed consent was obtained from all patients and/or their legal guardian/s. A total of 150 patients underwent initial, curative hepatectomy for histologically confrmed primary solitary 
ICC lesions without direct invasion to contiguous organs or extrahepatic metastasis. Te resection margin was 
ascertained based on fnal pathology. Six patients died of some non-tumour-related causes during follow-up – 1 
patient each died of intracerebral bleeding, severe pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute cardiac infarction, 
liver failure, and car accident.

Data on standard demographic, perioperative clinicopathological, and tumour-related characteristics were 
collected. Factors compared in the AR and NAR groups included patient age and sex, positivity for HBsAg, 
intrahepatic biliary stones, Child-Pugh classifcation, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level, blood loss, blood transfusions, and complications. Tumour characteristics were based 
on fnal pathology reports, including liver cirrhosis, tumour size, tumor location, vascular/perineural/biliary/
adjacent organ invasion, lymph node metastasis, and histological grade. Tumor size was defned as the largest 
diameter (in centimeters) for the tumor within the resected specimen. In addition, information on surgery, adjuvant therapy, such as adjuvant chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, 
and re-operation was also collected for each patient. Margin status were determined from the fnal post-operative 
pathological report.
Follow-up. Afer discharge, the patients were followed-up every 3 months for up to 2 years afer the initial 
operation and every 6 months thereafer. Recurrence was defned as the appearance of a new lesion that exhibited 
radiologic features compatible with ICC. DFS was defned as the interval between the date of operation and the 
date of diagnosis of frst recurrence or last follow-up. OS was measured from the date of operation to the date of 
death or last follow-up. Te date of last follow-up and survival status were collected for all patients.
Statistical analyses. Continuous data are expressed as medians and ranges. Qualitative variables are 
expressed as frequencies (percentages). Te Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for intergroup comparisons of quantitative variables as appropriate, whereas the χ2 test or Fisher exact test was used to compare 
categorical data. Two-sided P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically signifcant. A survival analysis was 
conducted using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, and the signifcance of diferences between survival 
curves was determined using the log-rank test. Multivariate comparisons of survival distributions were carried 
out using Cox proportional hazard models. To eliminate selection bias, patients were matched 1:1 by propensity 
score47,48 based on their clinicopathological characteristics. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
