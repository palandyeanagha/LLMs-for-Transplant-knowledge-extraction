Summary. In a population-based survey of 2,930 subjects, 
prevalence rates for obesity, Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) 
diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, 
hypertriglyceridaemia, and hypercholesterolaemia were 
54.3, 9.3, 11.1, 9.8, 10.3 and 9.2%, respectively. The prevalence, however, of each of these conditions in its isolated 
form (free of the other five) was 29.0% for obesity, 1.3% for 
Type 2 diabetes, 1.8% for impaired glucose tolerance, 1.5% 
for hypertension, 1.0% for hypertriglyceridaemia, and 1.7% 
for hypercholesterolaemia. Two-by-two associations were 
even rarer. The large differences in prevalence between isolated and mixed forms indicate a major overlap among the six 
disorders in multiple combinations. In the isolated form, each 
condition was characterized by hyperinsulinaemia (both fasting and 2 h after oral glucose), suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. In addition, in any isolated condition most of 
the variables categorising other members of the sextet were 
still significantly altered in comparison with 1,049 normal 
subjects. In the whole of the subjects who presented with one 
or another disorder (1,881 of 2,930 or 64%), marked fasting 
and post-glucose hyperinsulinaemia was associated with 
higher body mass index, waist:hip ratio, fasting and post-glucose glycaemia, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum 
triglycerides and total cholesterol levels, and with lower 
HDL-cholesterol concentrations (all p < 0.001). We conclude that (1) insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, blood 
pressure, body fat mass and distribution, and serum lipids are 
a network of mutually interrelated functions; and (2) an insulin resistance syndrome underlies each and all of the six 
disorders carrying an increased risk of coronary artery disease. 
Key words: Hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance, syndrome 
X, San Antonio Heart Study. 
It has long been known that both hypertension and Type 2 
(non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus are often associated with overweight [1, 2], and that hypertension is 
more prevalent among diabetic than non-diabetic individuals [3]. Hyperlipidaemia (high serum triglyceride or total 
cholesterol concentrations or both) is found with increased frequency in both diabetic [4] and hypertensive 
patients [5]. Thus, there seems to be a substantial overlap 
of disturbances of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and 
of blood pressure in the general population, although, to 
our knowledge, a formal analysis of such clustering has 
not appeared in the literature. 
Recently, it has been suggested that hyperinsulinaemia 
may be the common element accounting for the association of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and hypertension [6]. 
Obesity and Type 2 diabetes are classic states of insulin resistance [7], and recent evidence has shown that essential 
hypertension per se is often an insulin-resistant condition 
[8]. This has led Reaven [9] to hypothesise that insulin resistance aggregates with glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia in a distinct syndrome (syndrome 
X). 
Diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia 
are unquestioned risk factors for cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) [10], whilst the evidence linking impaired glucose 
tolerance to CVD is less consistent [11]. The Framingham study has also established that high triglyceride 
levels, when coupled with low high-density-lipoprotein(HDL)-cholesterol concentrations, carry an increased risk of CVD [10]. Finally, recent data from a 
large population-based, follow-up study indicate that 
overweight, even of a minor degree, is an independent 
risk factor for ischaemic heart disease in women [12]. On 
the other hand, in two prospective epidemiologic studies 
[13, 14] plasma insulin concentration has emerged as an 
independent predictor of coronary heart disease. On 
these grounds, it is logical to suppose that the putative 
hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance syndrome may be 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity. 

E. Ferrannini et at.: The insulin resistance syndrome 
The present analysis of the San Antonio Heart Study 
database identifies and characterises an insulin resistance 
syndrome. 
Subjects and methods 
Subjects 
The San Antonio Heart Study is a population-based study of diabetes 
and cardiovascular diseases in Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanicwhites. From 1984 to 1988 households from several types of San 
Antonio census groups were randomly sampled: low-income census 
tracts (95% Mexican-American); middle-income tracts (50% Mexican-American and 50% non-Hispanic white); and suburban census 
tracts (10% Mexican-American, 90% non-Hispanic white) [15]. 
Stratified random sampling was used in the middle-income and suburban census tracts to ensure the inclusion of approximately equal 
numbers of each ethnic group in the study sample. All men and nonpregnant women 25 to 64 years of age were eligible for the study. 
Ethnicity was defined on the basis of a previously published algorithm which considered parental surnames and birthplaces, stated 
ethnicity of grandparents, and participant's preferred ethnic identity 
when it indicated a distinct national origin [16]. Persons who were 
identified as belonging to an ethnic group other than MexicanAmerican or non-Hispanic white are excluded from the present 
analysis. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 
and all subjects gave informed consent. 
Procedures 
Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist/hip circumference ratio, WHR) were made with each participant wearing 
only underclothes and an examination gown [15]. Body mass index

(BMI) was calculated as weight (in kg) divided by height (in meters) 
squared. Obesity was defined as a BMI > 27 kg/m 2 ( > 26 kg/m 2 for 
women) [17]. Blood pressure was measured on the right arm of the 
seated participant following at least a 5-min rest using a random-zero 
sphygmomanometer (Hawksley-Gelman, London, UK). Three 
readings were recorded of the systolic (first phase) and diastolic 
(fifth phase) measured to the nearest even digit, and the subject's 
blood pressure was defined as the average of the second and third 
reading. Hypertension was defined according to the Hypertension 
Detection and Follow-up criteria (diastolic blood pressure 
> 95 mm Hg and/or currently taking antihypertensive medication) 
[181. 
Blood specimens were obtained following a 12-14 h fast for 
serum lipid, lipoprotein, and insulin and plasma glucose determinations. A 75-g glucose-equivalent load (Coladex or Orangedex, Cus- 

418 
tom Laboratories, Baltimore, Md., USA) was then administered, 
and blood specimens were obtained 2 h later for plasma glucose and 
insulin measurements. Methods for measurement of glucose, lipid, 
lipoprotein, and insulin have been published previously [15]. 
Diabetes was diagnosed according to the criteria of the World 
Health Organization (WHO) (fasting plasma glucose levels 
_> 7.8 mmol/1 or 2nd h plasma glucose _>ll.lmmol/1 [i9]. In 
previous reports, we have used National Diabetes Data Group 
(NDDG) criteria [2]. However, since the NDDG criteria do not have 
an unambiguous category for impaired glucose tolerance, we utilised 
the WHO criteria in the present report. The concordance between 
WHO and NDDG criteria for diagnosing diabetes in the San Antonio Heart Study is 98%. Subjects who did not meet these criteria but 
who were currently being treated with oral antidiabetic agents or 
insulin were also considered to have diabetes. Impaired glucose 
tolerance (IGT) was defined as a fasting plasma glucose 
<7.Smmol/1 and a 2nd h plasma glucose between 7.8 and 
11.1 mmol/1. Hypertriglyceridaemia was defined as a serum triglyceride concentration > 2.90 mmol/1, and hypercholesterolaemia as a 
serum total cholesterol concentration > 6.50 mmol/1. 
Statistical analysis 
Plasma insulin, glucose and triglyceride concentration values were 
log transformed to improve skewness. Group means were compared 
with the use of Student s t-test. Simultaneous adjustment for other 
variables was carried out by multiple linear regression. Data are 
given as mean + SEM.

Results 
The population sample consisted of 2,930 subjects (43% 
men, 68% Mexican-American), with a mean age of 
42.9 years. Over one-half of the population sample was 
obese; each of the other five conditions was present in 
roughly 10% ofallsubjects (Table 1). Only36% of all study 
subjects were 'normal' in that they were free of all six disorders. The crude prevalence rates of the six conditions in 
their'pure' or isolated form, i. e. associated with none of the 
other five, were much lower than the overall prevalence 
rates, by 50% in the case of obesity, 5-10 fold in the case of 
the others (Table 1). Two-by-two associations of isolated 
forms were even rarer, and in each case less frequent than 
expected by chance (Table 1). As a result, large proportions - ranging from 17% for obesity to 56% for hypertension- of the cases of each of the six conditions occurred in 
combination with three or more of the others. 
When the six groups of patients consisting of all cases 
with a condition were compared with the respective subgroups in which the disease was present in isolation 
(Figs. 1-3), the profile of the 12 measured (physiological 
and metabolic) variables was still qualitatively abnormal in 
the 'isolated' condition subgroups. The clinical characteristics of these latter are shown in Table 2 together with 
those of the normal subjects, while Table 3 lists the corre-

sponding metabolic me asurements. Differences in age, sex 
or ethnicity ratio, and body mass index were present between each patient subgroup and the control subjects 
(Table 2). The waist/hip ratio was significantly higher than 
normal in obese (p < 0.005), diabetic (p < 0.01), glucoseintolerant (p < 0.02), and hypertensive (p = 0.02), but not 
in hypertriglyceridaemic or hypercholesterolaemic, patients. Because age, gender, ethnic origin, and body mass 
were all found to have a significant statistical influence on 
one or more of the metabolic variables (data not shown), 
comparisons between each patient subgroup and the control population were carried out after adjusting, by 
multiple linear regression, for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI. 
The results are reported in Table 4 in terms of percent deviations from the mean reference values. They show that, 
even after the adjustments, each of the six isolated condi419 
tions was characterised by significant changes in several of 
the metabolic variables in addition to the defining variable 
for the condition itself. Thus, raised blood pressure was 
present also in 'pure' diabetic, IGT, or obese subjects, while 
increased fasting and 2nd h plasma glucose concentrations 
also occurred in 'pure' obese or hypertensive subjects. In 
particular, hyperinsulinaemia, fasting or post-glucose, was 
found in all patient groups (although in pure hypercholesterolaemia the adjusted difference from control subjects 
fell just short of full statistical significance,p = 0.11). 
When the 1,881 subjects with one or another disease 
combination (the 'insulin resistant' group) were compared with the 1,049 control subjects, all of the clinical and 
metabolic variables were significantly above normal (or 
below, in the case of serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations) (Fig. 4). Adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI 
did not alter either the size or the level of statistical significance of the differences (Table 5). 
In the control group, numerous simple correlations 
were present among the measured variables, clinical and 
metabolic alike. In particular, when the fasting or postglucose plasma insulin concentration was set to be the dependent variable in a multiple regression model, 23 and 
53%, respectively, of the variance was explained by the 
other 13 measured variables (p < 0.001). In the 'insulin resistant' group, 50% of the variability of fasting insulin, and 
57% of that of post-glucose insulin, was statistically explained by the other measured variables (p < 0.001). 
Discussion 
The first result that stands out in the present analysis is the 
very high degree of overlap among the six conditions considered (obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, impaired 
glucose tolerance, hypertriglyceridaemia, and hyperTable 2. Characteristics of the groups studie@

cholesterolaemia), a degree perhaps not fully appreciated 
until now. Each condition is defined by a conventional cutoff value of a continuous variable (e. g., body mass, glucose concentrations, blood pressure, etc.) rather than by 
the presence of a unique feature. Therefore, the observed 
superimposition pattern is dependent upon the chosen 
cut-off points. Shifting one or the other diagnostic criterion is likely to cause only quantitative, not qualitative differences in the overlap pattern. However, a very different 
prevalence of one condition would probably change the 
rate of occurrence of dual or multiple combinations. With 
regard to this, it is pertinent to note that the prevalence of 
Type 2 diabetes in the biethnic population of San Antonio 
is higher than in most westernised societies, on account of 
the enrichment of the Mexican-American group with 
diabetic individuals [15]. Since obesity, especially of the 
truncal variety, also is particularly frequent in MexicanAmericans [17], the results of the present analysis may not 
fully extend to other populations. 
Also striking is the observation that simple (two-bytwo) associations were all rarer than predicted by chance 
alone; this sort of spurious 'protection' against occurrence 
of two conditions together was actually the result of the 
high prevalence of triple or multiple combinations 
(Table 1). Thus, for all conditions but obesity, occurring as 
an isolated case in the cluster was an exceedingly infrequent event at the population level. One immediate practical corollary of these findings is that diagnosing any one 
of the six conditions in question should be sufficient indication to screen for the other five. Because of the extensive overlap, it was not surprising to find that each of the 
six conditions was characterized by multiple abnormalities (Figs. 1-3). More importantly, the analysis of the 
subgroups in which each condition was present alone revealed that, even in these isolated cases each categorical 
abnormality (e. g., blood pressure in hypertension) was accompanied by significant changes in several of the metabolic variables classifying other members of the sextet 
(after adjusting for age, gender and ethnic ratio, and 
BMI). Thus, lean, normotensive, normolipidaemic 
diabetic patients still had a significantly lower HDLcholesterol concentration and an increased systolic blood 
E. Ferrannini et al.: The insulin resistance syndrome 
pressure value; lean, non-diabetic, normolipidaemic 
hypertensive patients also had slight fasting hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia when compared with the 
control subjects (Table 4). These results, and the fact that 
the 12 measured variables showed a high degree of interrelatedness even in the group of healthy control subjects, 
suggest that the network of connections among the six 
conditions may simply be an amplification of normal links 
among the underlying physiological functions [5]. The 
physiological basis of several such relationships is well established. For example, a rise in piasma glucose levels can 
directly result from tissue refractoriness to insulin action 
on glucose uptake; elevated glycaemia then elicits a 
heightened insulin secretory response, which in turn is a 
stimulus for hepatic VLDL-triglyceride production [20- 
22]. Also, hyperinsulinaemia may raise blood pressure by 
a variety of mechanisms including renal sodium conservation and adrenergic activation [23]. If, then, the physiologic system explored by these parameters is indeed a network, pulling one element out of the normal boundaries 
will act upon the connecting arms to drag other neighbouring elements into the 'abnormal' domain. For 
example, if a strong genetic pressure drives plasma glucose into the diabetic range, blood pressure and lipids will 
trail behind, occasionally crossing the diagnostic

Thus, on a priori grounds it is highly unlikely that any of 
this kindred of disorders will occur in true isolation, i.e. 
with no changes (or opposite changes) in the tied metabolic/haemodynamic functions. 
The other major finding of this study is that, while insulinaemia itself is not a classification variable for any disease, hyperinsulinaemia, fasting or post-glucose, was present in all the subgroups of isolated conditions. It was the 
common denominator of the sextet. Under most circumstances, a raised plasma insulin concentration implies the 
presence of insulin resistance, and, in fact, represents an 
adaptive response to the reduced sensitivity to the hormone [24]. Previous studies using the euglycaemic insulin 
clamp technique [25] have shown that insulin resistance is 
present in non-diabetic, normotensive obese subjects [26], 
in lean, normotensive patients with Type 2 diabetes [27] or 
impaired glucose tolerance [28, 29], in lean, normotensive 
hypertriglyceridaemic subjects [30], and in lean, nondiabetic, normolipidaemic hypertensive patients [8, 31]. 
In these highly selected patient groups, the insulin resistance has been thought of as primary [9]. Direct evidence 
that pure, isolated hypercholesterolaemia may be associated with insulin resistance is lacking, but the data in 
Table 4 suggest that this might be the case. Thus, at least 
five of the six conditions considered here have already entered the list of primary insulin resistant states in humans. 
Therefore, the present data on hyperinsulinaemia very 
likely illustrate the relationship of insulin resistance with 
the physiological and metabolic changes found in the 
member conditions of the sextet. It is legitimate to collectively indicate the sextet as a primary insulin resistance 
syndrome (Fig. 4), in which different features (e. g., hyperglycaemia or high blood pressure) dominate the clinical 
picture in different patients. This concept is an extension 
of the insulin resistance syndrome hypothesised by 
Reaven [9], and alluded to by Lind et al. [32], and certainly 
is not exhaustive: other disorders with genetic imprint, insulin resistance and atherogenic potential may be included. 
The question then arises: is insulin resistance one common result of the six conditions (e. g., via hyperglycaemia 
in Type 2 diabetes, or high blood pressure in hypertension), or is it a basic cellular defect, parent to the conditions? Available evidence appears to be insufficient to 
answer this question. Some information would favour a 
primacy of insulin resistance. Thus, at least in nondiabetic Pima Indians, in vivo insulin action is a familial 
characteristic [33]. Furthermore, non-diabetic relatives of 
Type 2 diabetic patients present hyperinsulinaemia [34] 
and insulin resistance [35], and hyperinsulinaemia predicts the subsequent development of Type 2 diabetes [36]. 
Parental history of Type 2 diabetes is associated with 
higher prevalence of hypertension and lipid abnormalities 
in non-diabetic probands [37]. Hyperinsulinaemic, but 
otherwise healthy, individuals have higher plasma glucose 
and lipid levels and blood pressure values [38]. In at least 
one variant of familial dyslipidaemic hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia is found that is not fully explained by obesity 
[39]. On the other hand, insulin resistance can be entirely 
acquired - as presumably are many cases of obesity in421 
duced by excess caloric intake - and yet display the full 
range of associated abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism and blood pressure. The present analysis of 
cross-sectional data cannot offer any clue as to the nature 
of the observed associations among diseases or the relation of each of them to insulin resistance. Genetic heterogeneity, environmental factors, and gene-environment 
interactions are known to determine the natural history of 
obesity, Type2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemias [40-44]. Their multiple associations may likewise reflect true genetic linkage, cause-effect relationships, or both. At present, it seems both accurate and 
prudent to state that the presence of insulin resistance in 
the sextet can have a variable value - of a predisposing or 
aggravating factor- in the different member diseases and, 
possibly, within the affected individuals of each disease. 
Whatever the case, the general pattern of abnormalities in the insulin resistant group (Fig. 4) is a highly 
atherogenic risk profile, in support of the contention that 
this syndrome is a precursor of CVD. Longitudinal studies 
are needed to address what appears to be the crucial issue: 
is an insulin resistant individual 'bound' to develop a 
string of abnormalities ultimately leading to CVD ?
