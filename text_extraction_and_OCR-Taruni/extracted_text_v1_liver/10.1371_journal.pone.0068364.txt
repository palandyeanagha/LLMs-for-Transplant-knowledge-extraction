Abstract
Background and Aims: Plasma levels of NT-pro-BNP, a natriuretic peptide precursor, are raised in the presence of fluid
retention of cardiac origin and can be used as markers of cardiac dysfunction. Recent studies showed high levels of NT pro
BNP in patients with cirrhosis. We assessed NT pro-BNP and other parameters of cardiac dysfunction in patients with
cirrhosis, with or without ascites, in order to determine whether the behaviour of NT pro BNP is linked to the stage of liver
disease or to secondary cardiac dysfunction.
Methods: Fifty eight consecutive hospitalized patients mostly with viral or NAFLD-related cirrhosis were studied. All
underwent abdominal ultrasound and upper GI endoscopy. Cardiac morpho-functional changes were evaluated by
echocardiography and NT-pro-BNP plasma levels determined upon admission. Twenty-eight hypertensive patients, without
evidence of liver disease served as controls.
Results: Fifty eight cirrhotic patients (72% men) with a median age of 62 years (11% with mild arterial hypertension and
31% with type 2 diabetes) had a normal renal function (mean creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, range 0.7–1.06). As compared to
controls, cirrhotic patients had higher NT pro-BNP plasma levels (365.26365.2 vs 70.8670.6 pg/ml; p,0.001). Left atrial
volume (LAV) (61.8626.3 vs 43.5614.1 ml; p = 0.001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (62.766.9 vs. 65.564%,; p = 0.05)
were also altered in cirrhotic patients that in controls. Patients with F2-F3 oesophageal varices as compared to F0/F1,
showed higher e’ velocity (0.9160.23 vs 0.6660.19 m/s, p,0.001), and accordingly a higher E/A ratio (1.2160.46 vs
0.8960.33 m/s., p = 0.006).
Conclusion: NT-pro-BNP plasma levels are increased proportionally to the stage of chronic liver disease. Advanced cirrhosis
and high NT-pro-BNP levels are significantly associated to increased LAV and to signs of cardiac diastolic dysfunction. NT
pro-BNP levels could hence be an useful prognostic indicators of early decompensation of cirrhosis.

Introduction
The foremost hemodynamic feature of cirrhosis is the hyperdynamic syndrome, a circulatory state characterized by low
arterial pressure, high cardiac output and decreased peripheral
vascular resistance [1–3]. As a consequence of this hemodynamic
profile, a broad spectrum of cardiac abnormalities, such as
impaired myocardial contractility, impaired diastolic relaxation
and electrophysiological abnormalities in the absence of any other
evident heart disease may be found in patients with cirrhosis [1,4–
6]. Both hemodynamic and cardiac profiles denote the pathophysiological scenario known as ‘‘cirrhotic cardiomyopathy’’, a
clinical condition which plays a role in the course of cirrhosis, at a
rate whose relevance is yet partly undefined [1,6–7].
During the past few years, considerable attention has been paid
to the role of markers of cardiac dysfunction, BNP and its prohormone, NT pro BNP, which both are secreted by heart
ventricles in response to massive stretching of muscle cells or to
mild cardiac damage and show capability to reduce blood pressure
and cardiac hypertrophy [8–12]. Further, recent studies revealed
that high serum levels of NT pro-BNP are present in patients with
chronic liver diseases of viral etiology [13–16]. As they seem to be
relate to the severity of liver disease and cardiac dysfunction they
should be useful markers to identify cirrhotic patients with
increased cardiovascular risk and thus, worse prognosis.
In this study we aimed to assess in a well-characterized cohort
of patients with cirrhosis of non-alcoholic aetiology, before or
after the development of ascites, the expression of NT pro-BNP
and of other parameters of cardiac dysfunction in order to
determine whether the behaviour of NT pro BNP is linked to the
stage of liver disease or to a cardiac dysfunction secondary to
cirrhosis.

Patients and Methods
The study was performed in accordance with the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki and its appendices, and with local and
national laws. Approval was obtained from the AOUP Policlinico
‘‘ Paolo Giaccone’’ of Palermo, Institutional Review Board and
Ethics Committee, and written informed consent was obtained
from all patients and controls.
From April 2010 to October 2011, we consecutively enrolled
fifty eight patients with a clinical or histological diagnosis of
cirrhosis, admitted to our liver Unit, which is a tertiary referral
centre for chronic liver disease. All of them underwent, abdominal
ultrasound and upper GI endoscopy in order to determine the
stage of liver disease and the presence of ascites and indirect signs
of portal hypertension.
All patients with known cardiac or renal diseases (creatinine
.1,5 mg/dl) were excluded. The diagnosis of arterial hypertension was based on the following criteria: systolic blood pressure
$135 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure $85 mm Hg
(measured three times within 30 minutes, in the sitting position
and using a brachial sphygmomanometer), or use of bloodpressure-lowering agents. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was
based on the revised criteria of the American Diabetes Association,
using a value of fasting blood glucose $126 mg/dL on at least two
occasions [17]. In patients with a previous diagnosis of type 2
diabetes, current therapy with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents
was documented.

We also evaluated a control group of 28 newly diagnosed
hypertensive patients matched for age and sex and who were
referred to Internal Medicine Unit for clinical investigation. All
had a normal renal function without any signs of major organic
disease, including liver disease. In particular, all were negative for
HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV, and all of them had normal liver
function tests (LFTs).
Echocardiographic assessment
All cirrhotic and control patients underwent echocardiographic
examination to study diastolic and systolic cardiac function.
One experienced observer performed all echocardiograms
according to the recommendations of the American Society of
Echocardiography (a) using a GE VIVID 7 Dimension Cardiac –
Vascular Ultrasound, interfaced with a 2.5 MHz phased-array
probe. All recordings were digitally stored for off-line analyses by
dedicated software.
M-mode echocardiograms of the left ventricle were recorded
from the parasternal long-axis view guided by two-dimensional
image. We measured left ventricular internal diameter (LVID),
interventricular septum (IVS), and posterior wall thickness (PWT)
on this M-mode tracings, as described in the American Society of
Echocardiography guidelines [18]. When optimal orientation of
the M-mode ultrasound beam could not be obtained, we
performed linear measurements on correctly oriented twodimensional images. We determined left atrial (LA) diameter
and aortic root (AO) diameter on M-mode images. All the
measurements of cavities and wall thickness were made by the
leading-edge method (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
2698218) and averaged over three cardiac cycles. The ejection
fraction (EF) was calculated by using the area-length formula as
previously described [19]. We computed LV mass in grams using
the following formula: 0.86(1.04[(LVID + IVS + PWT)32
LVID3]) +0.6 [20]. LV mass was corrected by body surface area
of each patient. Left atrial end-systolic volumes and Left
Ventricular End-Diastolic ones (monoplane area/length from
four chamber view, Dodge correction) were computed. From the
apical window, the sonographer placed the Doppler sample
volume between the tips of the mitral valve to obtain pulsedwave Doppler images of mitral blood flow. From the transmitral
flow signal, he measured peak early diastolic velocity (E) and
peak late diastolic velocity (A) and calculated the E/A ratio. The
observer acquired tissue Doppler images (TDI) of septal and
lateral left ventricle segments. From these recordings, we
determined for each segment peak early (e9) TDI velocities and
calculated the E9/e9 ratio. For the analysis, we averaged e9
measured from septal and lateral sites.
Grading diastolic dysfunction
Assessment of diastolic dysfunction, according to Recommendations for the Evaluation of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function
by ASE [20] take into consideration mitral E, E/A ratio, e9 and
E/e9 ratio. Mild diastolic dysfunction was defined as following
reported according to ASE guidelines [21]: mitral E/A ratio
,0,8; anular e9,8 cm/s and E/e9ratio ,8 (septal and lateral).
Moderate diastolic dysfunction was defined as: mitral E/A ratio
0,8–1,5; anular e9 ,8 cm/s and E/e9ratio 8–12 (septal and
lateral). Severe diastolic dysfunction was defined as: mitral E/A
ratio .2; anular e9,8 cm/s and E/e9ratio .13 (septal and
lateral).
Plasma NT-pro-BNP analysis
Plasma NT-pro-BNP levels were determined by a commercial
assay (Vitros NT-pro-BNP, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.).
Blood samples from cirrhotic and controls have been drained
and then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 minutes at room
temperature. The supernatant plasma was recovered and stored at
280uC until analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were summarized as mean 6 SD;
categorical variables as frequency and percentage. The ANOVA
test, student’s t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square test were
used when appropriate.
Univariate linear regression analysis was used to study
relationships between NT-pro-BNP and clinical, biochemical
and echocardiographic variables of cirrhotic patients.
Logistic regression model was used to identify the factors
associated with the presence of ascites, by assessing the same
independent variables included in the linear model. A two-tailed p
value of p,0.05 was considered significant. STATA/SE, version
12.1 for Windows (Stata Corp, College Station, TX), was used to
analyze the data.

Results
The baseline features of the 58 cirrhotic and 28 control patients
are shown in Table S1.
Cirrhotic patients (72% men) had a median age of 62 years, a
prevalence of arterial hypertension and diabetes of 11% and 31%
respectively, and showed a renal function within the normal range
(range 0.7–1.06) with a mean creatinine levels of 0.9 mg/dl. The
liver disease was due to HCV infection (58.6%), HBV infection
(13.7%), alcohol abuse (3.4%), NASH (13.7%), and cryptogenic
liver damage 6 (10.4%). According to Child-Pugh classification,
patients were divided as follows: 24 (41.4%) in A class; 23 (39.7%)
and 11 (18.9%) in B and C classes, respectively. Further, all 58
patients were subgrouped according to the presence of ascites; 32
out of 58 (55.2%) were cirrhotic decompensated patients being on
therapy with diuretics or paracentesis (refractory ascites); the
remaining 44.8% were compensated (without ascites). For patients
with refractory ascites, echocardiographic assessment was done
after paracentesis. Upper GI endoscopy showed that 10 (17.3%)
patients did not have signs of portal hypertension, while 24
(41.4%) had small (F1) oesophageal varices and 22 (37.9%) had
medium-large (F2/F3) oesophageal varices. Only for two patients
type and dimension of esophageal varices were not assessed.
Twenty five patients (43.1%) were on beta blockers as prophylaxis
of first variceal bleeding or rebleeding. Finally, in 25 (43.1%) cases
a diagnosis of HCC was made during hospitalization, but none of
these patients was on therapy with anti-angiogenic drugs.
The control subjects (mean age of 60.668,4 years, 20 male and
8 female) were comparable for diabetes prevalence to the cirrhotic
population, and had similar creatinine serum levels.

NT-Pro-BNP, Atrial Volume and Cirrhosis
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e68364

NT proBNP plasma level and echocardiographic
parameters
NT pro-BNP plasma levels and echocardiographic parameters
of both cirrhotic and control patients are showed in Table 1.
Cirrhotic patients had significantly higher NT pro-BNP plasma
levels compared to controls (365.26365.2 vs 70.8670.6 pg/ml;
p,0.001) (Figure 1).
Similarly, left atrial volume (LAV) (61.8626.3 vs 43.5614.1 ml;
p = 0.001), and left ventricular ejection fraction (62.766.9 vs.
65.564%,; p = 0.05) were significantly altered in cirrhotic patients
as compared to controls, and a trend was also observed for left
ventricular mass (84.3624 vs. 73.9618.3 g/m2
; p = 0.08) and
Systolic Pulmonary Arterial Pressure (PAPs) (30.464.9 vs.
28.161.7 mmHg; p = 0.08).
Factors associated with NT pro-BNP plasma levels in
cirrhotic patients
By linear regression analysis, in cirrhotic patients, at univariate
analysis, NT-pro-BNP levels were directly related to liver
dysfunction (lower albumin, lower INR, presence of ascites,
cirrhosis stage, higher MELD and Child Pugh scores), and to renal
impairment (higher serum creatinine levels), and to larger atrial
volumes (Table 2).
NT pro-BNP plasma levels, echocardiographic features
and features of portal hypertension
Table 3 shows factors associated with presence of ascites. As
expected cirrhotic patients with ascites had a higher impairment of
both liver (albumin 3.560.5 vs. 2.960.4, p,0.001; bilirubin
1.060.4 vs. 3.163.4, p = 0.005; INR 1.160.1 vs. 1.460.3,

p = 0.007), compared to their counterpart without ascites. They
also had higher NT pro-BNP plasma levels (171.96165.9 vs.
525.26408.1, p,0.001) (Figure 1), and a trend to larger atrial
volumes (54.7621.2 vs. 67.2628.8 ml, p = 0.09) and to a higher
E/A ratio (0.9360.41 vs. 1.1360.45, p = 0.08).
When comparing patients with F2-F3 oesophageal varices to
those with F0/F1 varices (Table 4), regardless of ascites, while NT
pro-BNP plasma levels were similar (385.96329.4, vs.
302.86338.5 p = 0,39), the former had a higher e’ velocity
(0.9160.23 vs 0.6660.19 m/s, p,0.001), and, accordingly a
higher E/A ratio (1.2160.46 vs 0.8960.33 m/s., p = 0.006)
(Figure 2).
Discussion
In cirrhotic patients, NT-pro-BNP serum levels as well as
echocardiographic parameters such as left atrial volumes and
ejection fraction are significantly altered. There is a significant
association between NT-pro-BNP serum levels, parameter of
kidney and liver function, and atrial volumes. We also observed
that cirrhotic patients with ascites, compared to their counterpart
without, had higher NT-pro-BNP serum levels and accordingly
larger atrial volumes, and a paradoxical significant increase in E/
A ratio also observed in patients with large esophageal varices.
In an attempt to investigate the spectrum of cardiac abnormalities involving cirrhotic patients, we found that atrial volumes,
ejection fraction, and partially left ventricular mass and PAPs are
significantly altered, as compared to the hypertensive controls.
These findings could be expression of the physio-pathological
events that lead to the hyperdynamic syndrome, typical of
cirrhosis, and characterized by increased heart rate and cardiac
output and decreased systemic vascular resistance with normal or
low blood arterial pressure [22]. Along this line we also observed
higher NT-pro-BNP serum levels in cirrhotic compared to
controls, this issue being partly explained by the relationship
between the hormone and atrial volumes. Levels of NT pro-BNP
may be related to large atrial volumes as a consequence of heart
wall injury, and myocardiocyte stretching is one of the main factor
stimulating natriuretic hormones production [9]. Accordingly, our
data confirm the hypothesis already reported by Henriksen et al
[12], that NT pro-BNP levels could be a marker of cardiovascular
diastolic dysfunction in patients with end stage liver disease, acting
as mediator of splanchnic vasodilatation in liver cirrhosis [8,9]. In
fact, in our cirrhotic patients NT pro-BNP levels were related not
only to large atrial volumes, but also to indexes of liver and kidney
function.
Another relevant issue of our study, is that high levels of NT
pro-BNP are increased in the presence of ascites as compared to
cirrhotic patients without, probably as a result of increased fluid
retention. We also observed a trend for larger atrial volumes in
ascitic versus no ascitic patients. Overall these data suggest that
NT pro-BNP is a marker of cardiac subclinical dysfunction
participating to liver decompensation. Further studies are needed
to assess the role of NT pro-BNP as a predictor of decompensation
and prognosis in cirrhotic patients.
In this study we also observed that patients with more advanced
liver disease, i.e. those with large varices or with ascites, had a
higher E/A ratio, and a relatively ‘‘better’’ diastolic cardiac
function. This finding is explained by the fact that these patients
usually need of periodic paracentesis and albumin infusion,
determining an improvement of E/A ratio. In fact, it has been
already described that after paracentesis and albumin infusion
cirrhotic patients show an upgrading of diastolic dysfunction as
demonstrated by an increase of E/A ratio [22–23]. Further, it
seems that albumin have a direct effect on the myocardium, as well
[24–26]. In addition, all patients with large esophageal varices are

they showed also a higher E/A ratio as compared to their counterpart.

on therapy with beta-blockers for prophylaxis of the variceal
bleeding, and these drugs, showing a vasoconstrictor effect on
splanchnic compartment, determining an increase of cardiac preload with a more efficacy of the cardiac pump, and the
disappearing of the diastolic dysfunction with a normalization of
E/A ratio [27]. We also found an inverse association between
large esophageal varices and platelet count, being these last a
surrogate marker of portal hypertension as previously reported by
Giannini et al [28].
The main limitation of this study, besides the unavoidable
clinical heterogeneity and the relatively small number of patients,
lies in its cross-sectional nature, unable to identify pathogenic
mechanisms(s) linking cardiac dysfunction, NT pro BNP serum
levels, and severity of liver disease. In addition the use of diuretics
and beta-blockers in cirrhotics and of hypertensive patients as
controls could also bias our results, underestimating the cardiac
alterations of cirrhotic patients.
In conclusion, our study showed that cirrhotic patients have
echocardiographic (larger atrial volumes) and biochemical (higher
NT pro BNP serum levels) alterations expression of cardiac
dysfunction, leading as spectator or actor to liver decompensation
and ascites development. While further physio-pathological studies
should be performed in order to determine whether the high levels
of NT-pro BNP are a consequence of the hyperdynamic syndrome
and volume overload on heart chambers. It is clinically relevant
that NT-pro-BNP plasma levels are increased proportionally to the
severity of cirrhosis. In fact, advanced cirrhosis and high NT-proBNP levels are significantly associated to increased LAV, and to
signs of cardiac diastolic dysfunction, which characterize morphofunctional changes usually found in end stage liver disease. The
correlation between NT pro-BNP levels and cirrhosis stage could
eventually, if confirmed by longitudinal studies, prove useful as a
prognostic indicators of early decompensation of cirrhosis.
