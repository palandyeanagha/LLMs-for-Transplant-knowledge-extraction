Abstract Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis
and primary sclerosing cholangitis are autoimmune liver
diseases characterized by progressive immune-mediated
inflammation leading to the destruction of the hepatocytes
and the biliary epithelial cells, and eventually to cirrhosis
and liver failure. The ultimate treatment of these diseases,
upon the establishment of end-stage liver disease, includes
liver transplantation (LT). Recurrence of autoimmune liver
diseases after LT is an entity increasingly recognized in the
last few decades. The mechanisms driving recurrence
remain poorly understood. The accurate diagnosis of the
recurrence and the proper management of the affected
patients remains a clinical challenge. This review discusses
clinical aspects related to the recurrence of autoimmune
liver diseases after LT. The main goals of this review are to
discuss the reasons explaining the variability of the incidence rates of recurrent autoimmune disease and the outcome and risk factors for recurrent disease. We discuss in
detail the diagnostic criteria and the treatment options of
these disorders.

Introduction
Recurrence of the primary disease after liver transplantation (LT) has become a major focus for clinicians and
researchers. The ultimate goal of the management of these
patients is first, to tailor immunosuppression and second, to
avoid graft dysfunction and recurrence of the original
disease in order to maximize graft survival. Though disease
recurrence can be expected to a certain degree for diseases
such as viral hepatitides, for others it can be largely
unpredictable. This review discusses clinical aspects related to the recurrence of autoimmune liver diseases.
Incidence rates of recurrent autoimmune disease
Recurrence rates of autoimmune disease after LT are variable in different series, which is partly explained by several differences: (a) methods for the assessment of
recurrent disease, (b) criteria used to establish the diagnosis
of recurrent disease, (c) use of immunosuppressive regimen
and (d) duration of follow-up. It should also be noted that
reported rates of recurrence depend on whether routine
protocol biopsies are performed, since recurrence disease
may be present without abnormal liver function tests.

Regarding autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), previous studies
have reported that recurrent AIH (rAIH) ranges from 20 to
42 % after LT [1, 2], while a recent review [3] estimated a
prevalence rate of 23 % after a median of 26.4 months
after LT and a weighted recurrence rate was calculated to
be 22 %. Recurrence of PSC (rPSC) ranges from 9 to 47 %
[4], but in the above-mentioned literature review [3], it was
estimated that 161 (17 %) of 940 patients had rPSC, and
the weighted recurrence rate was calculated as 11 %.
Finally, recurrent PBC (rPBC) has been reported to be
approximately 10–35 % at 5 years [5], but its incidence
increases with time and in recipients with living donor LT,
compared to recipients of cadaveric donor LT [6]. In a
recent review [3], an incidence of 16 % was found after a
median post-LT follow-up of 69 months and the weighted
recurrence rate was 18 % (Table 1).
Outcome and risk factors for recurrent disease
Primary biliary cirrhosis
The consequences of rPBC appear to be relatively small,
since the course of the disease is often, but not always,
slow. Generally, rPBC is not considered a major clinical
problem [7]. As a result, even in studies with long followup, there was no difference in graft survival between
recipients with and those without rPBC. For example, in a
series of 485 PBC transplant recipients, recurrent PBC was
the cause of re-LT in only 3 (0.6 %) patients [8] and in a
recent study including 52 patients with rPBC and extended
follow-up after LT to 20 years, it was found that rPBC had
no impact in patient or graft survival. Although patients
with rPBC may have developed more advanced fibrosis,
compared to patients transplanted for other liver diseases, it
is unclear whether this is clinically relevant. Interestingly,
in another cohort, none of 17 patients with rPBC developed
cirrhosis after a mean follow-up of 4.7 years [9]. Risk
factors for rPBC have not elucidated, but advanced donor
age, recipients’ characteristics and peri-operative factors
have been implicated [10]. Regarding immunosupression,
the data in the literature remains controversial, but some
evidence suggests that cyclosporine-, compared to tacrolimus-based regimen, is associated with reduced rate of
rPBC and slower progression [8, 11, 12]. These reports did
not control for the use of azathioprine often combined with
cyclosporine and used less often with tacrolimus. In addition, a recent review was not able to confirm that either
cyclosporine- or tacrolimus-based immunosuppression
were different with respect to long-term survival for PBC
patients who had LT [3]. Interestingly, some reports have
suggested that steroids may prevent rPBC, but their longterm use is associated with higher rates of hypertension,
diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Similarly to PBC, long-term (more than 5 years) patient
survival seems to be similar in patients with or without
rPSC [13, 14]. However, patients with rPSC underwent
more frequently to re-LT due to recurrent disease. Indeed,
rPSC is second only to recurrent HCV in terms of recurrent
disease after LT. In addition, PSC graft survival is reduced
compared to PBC, which may be related to the slower
progression of PBC, compared with PSC. Interestingly,
Rowe et al. [15] found that graft loss to be highest in rPSC
with a hazard ratio of 6.0 compared to those with rPBC in a
large cohort of patients surviving more than 90 days after
LT. Thus, longer follow-up beyond 10 years may be
required to assess the impact of rPSC on survival. Recurrence of PSC has been associated with many factors, such
as steroid-resistant rejection, OKT3 use, preservation
injury, ABO incompatibility, cytomegalovirus infection,
male recipient gender, donor–recipient gender mismatch
[16–20] and absence of ulcerative colitis. However, an
important issue is the difference in exclusion/inclusion
criteria and methods of rPSC diagnosis, which may be the
reason for the discrepancies among studies regarding the
incidence and the risk factors associated with rPSC [3].
Interestingly, the absence of UC after LT (due to pre-LT
colectomy or not) has been found to be an important factor
preventing rPSC. In addition, a recent study showed that
the presence of severe or de novo UC after LT is a risk

factor for rPSC [14]. This explains the finding that maintenance steroids ([3 months) (which was the only independent factor for rPSC) was given for activity of UC [14].
These findings give support to the hypotheses that UC and
PSC have common pathogenesis [21].
Autoimmune hepatitis
The course of rAIH has not been elucidated. Although
rAIH appears to follow a protracted course with reasonable
long-term survival [22], it may be a significant cause of
graft loss [15]. These findings have led many centres to
suggest long-term immunosuppression with prednisolone
at a relatively low dose (about 5–10 mg/day) for at least
1 year post-LT [23]. However, a recent study has suggested
that early steroid withdrawal does not influence the incidence of rAIH, and most patients with rAIH can be managed without re-LT [24]. No consistent risk factors for
rAIH have been identified, but there are reports that highgrade inflammation in the native liver before LT [25] and
HLA-DR3 haplotype are independently associated with
higher rate of recurrence [26]. The role of immunosuppression is still controversial, but a recent systematic
review by Gautam et al. found no difference in recurrence
rates between recipients on tacrolimus or cyclosporinebased regimen [22, 27].
Diagnosis of recurrent disease
Clinical and serological features
The diagnosis of recurrent autoimmune disease cannot be
based on the same criteria as those in the pre-LT setting.
For example, it may not reasonable to apply the same
scoring system to a LT recipient with suspected recurrent
disease, who is under immunosuppression, since many
other transplant-related causes may be responsible for the
graft dysfunction. On the other hand, the diagnosis of
recurrent disease should be based on a combination of
biochemical, serological and histological (or radiological)
findings. However, abnormal liver tests, detection of autoantibodies and high levels of serum immunoglobulins
(IGs) may follow histological changes [28–30]. For
example, it is estimated that only half of the patients with
rPBC will have abnormal liver tests [9] and the latter may
remain normal several years after histological diagnosis of
recurrence disease. In addition, auto-antibodies and IGs
levels are not useful to establish the diagnosis of recurrence liver disease [2, 31]. This is true not only for
antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in rPBC, but also for
other auto-antibodies in patients transplanted for AIH
[30], since the latter have been detected in patients with
rejection and in those transplanted for causes other than
AIH [30, 32–34].
Primary biliary cirrhosis
Recurrent PBC after LT was first reported in 1982 [35].
Although there was some initial controversy, recurrence of
PBC after LT is now well recognized and its diagnosis is
based on well-accepted criteria (Table 2) [36]. The diagnosis of rPBC should be suspected in patients transplanted
for PBC and who develop a cholestatic pattern of abnormal
hepatic tests or in the presence of typical histopathologic
findings during post-LT surveillance. However, histological features of rPBC are often present without abnormal
biochemical indices. Thus, a liver biopsy performed only
when symptoms or abnormal serum liver tests are present
underestimates the rate of rPBC. Thus, many centres perform protocol liver biopsy in order to identify earlier, the
patients with rPBC. AMA and anti-M2 are not reliable
markers for the presence of rPBC, as they often persist or
may only have a transient fall with reappearance after LT
without recurrence of PBC. Presumably, they reflect the
persistence of the basic abnormality that is associated with
development of the disease [28–30, 37]. The gold standard
for diagnosing rPBC is the liver biopsy, demonstrating the
characteristic histologic features with granulomatous bile
duct destruction with or without plasma cell infiltrate.
However, it is important to exclude other processes that
can lead to graft dysfunction with similar histologic findings, such as acute or chronic rejection.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis
The first case report suggesting disease recurrence in PSC
patients after LT was published in 1988 [38]. The diagnosis

of rPSC is based on clinical, laboratory, histological, and,
mainly, cholangiographic findings, but none of these are
specific for rPSC. In addition, a helpful diagnostic serum
marker in the pre-LT setting, anti-pANCA is not useful
post-LT [39]. The diagnosis is complicated by the fact that
other potential causes after LT leading to bile duct lesions
suggesting PSC have to be excluded, such as recurrent
biliary infection, hepatic artery stenosis or thrombosis,
chronic rejection, donor/recipient ABO incompatibility and
ischemic cholangiopathy and/or non-anastomotic strictures
developed during the first 90 days after LT, which may
mimic PSC in the post-LT setting [39–41]. Day 90 has
been chosen in an attempt to eliminate cases of ischemictype biliary stricture related to reperfusion or preservation
injury during surgery or quality of the donor graft particularly form non-heart beating donors, which typically
develop within that time period [42]. Indeed, rPSC is
considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion [13, 43] and strict
cholangiographic and/or histological criteria diagnostic of
rPSC have been adopted (Table 3) [42]. However, some
studies have based the diagnosis of rPSC only on histological findings [44], but it is known that liver biopsy is
inaccurate for the diagnosis of PSC due to sampling
problems, while other causes, such as ABO incompatibility
between donor and recipient and hepatic arterial occlusion,
lead to histological lesions that can mimic rPSC. Other
studies have been based mainly on radiological demonstration of rPSC with the presence of multiple non-anastomotic strictures seen by magnetic resonance imaging or
percutaneous or retrograde cholangiography [45, 46],
without considering the fact that ischaemic biliary complications are usually seen up to 6 months post-LT, in
contrast with recurrent PSC, which is usually diagnosed
more than 12 months after LT. Thus, because of the lack of
a diagnostic gold standard, the diagnosis of rPSC after LT
remains difficult, and well-defined cholangiographic and
histological criteria are mandatory [3, 40, 42].
Autoimmune hepatitis
The diagnosis of rAIH is based on increased serum
transaminases, and serum IgG and importantly on
appropriate histology showing destruction of liver parenchyma, significant plasma cell infiltration and varying
degrees of fibrosis [2]. Alternative diagnoses, such as
hepatitis B and C, and chronic and acute rejection, should
be considered before AIH recurrence is diagnosed
(Table 4) [22, 47].
Histological features of recurrence
Histological findings are considered very important, particularly in establishing early the diagnosis of recurrent
AIH and PBC. However, the diagnostic criteria for AIH
and PBC in the native liver cannot be applied to the liver
allograft due to the variable effects of immunosuppression.
In addition, there may be histological similarities between
recurrent disease and other graft complications, particularly
acute and chronic rejection. In rAIH, histological features
of a plasma cell-rich mononuclear cell portal infiltrate with
interface hepatitis are helpful [48, 49], while the presence
of acute lobular hepatitis appears to occur more frequently
in rAIH. However, these histological findings should be
differentiated from other causes, such as viral infection,
de novo AIH or late cellular rejection with AIH features
[48, 50, 51].
In both PBC and PSC, the classical bile duct lesions are
not always seen in liver allograft biopsies. The diagnosis of
recurrent PBC or PSC may be made on the basis of compatible histological findings, such as bile duct loss and
features of chronic cholestasis. In PBC, the characteristic
portal tract lesions include mononuclear inflammatory
infiltrate, formation of lymphoid aggregates, epithelioid
granulomas and bile duct damage, but it is important to
examine a sufficient number of portal tracts.

Treatment
Although no standard approach exists for the treatment of
rPBC, most centres offer patients ursodeoxycholic acid
(UDCA) 10–15 mg/kg/day, as recommended in the pre-LT
setting, because of its favourable side-effect profile and
efficacy to improve liver biochemistries. In addition,
UDCA could delay histologic progression, but its influence
on the natural history of recurrent disease requires further
study with randomized controlled trials [52]. For example,
in one study, 3 (43 %) of 7 patients treated with UDCA for
rPBC, had improvement in liver biochemical tests, while in
another study, 13 (75 %) of 17 patients with rPBC treated
with UDCA showed a marked decrease in serum alkaline
phosphatase. However, it is unknown whether the biochemical improvement correlated with a histologic
improvement [5], and there have been no prospective,
controlled trial. Indeed, the precise benefit of UDCA in this
setting remains unknown. On the other hand, since the
incidence of colon cancer increases after LT, similarly to
PSC, UDCA may reduce the risk of dysplasia and thus
colon cancer. The benefit of using UDCA in combination
with corticosteroids (such as budesonide, which has an
90 % first-pass metabolism by the liver) has not elucidated
in the post-LT setting [53]. Although optimal immunosuppression to prevent PBC recurrence remains controversial, it has been reported that recurrence of PBC in
patients receiving tacrolimus is more rapid than with
cyclosporine, but the use of azathioprine was not controlled
in this analysis. Switching to alternative regimes (e.g. those
based on azathioprine, mycophenolate or cyclosporine)
may be an option if recurrence appears to progress rapidly.
In the pre-LT setting, no specific treatment has been
shown to prevent or slow progression of PSC. High dose of
UDCA (15–20 mg/kg/day) may be detrimental [54]. Particularly, UDCA might benefit more those patients with
PSC and UC by reducing the risk of dysplasia leading to
colon adenoma and carcinoma. Based on these data and the
safety of UDCA, UDCA is often used in rPSC, while the
choice of immunosuppression does not seem to have any
influence on recurrence.
In rAIH, the general approach is similar to that of AIH
pre-LT, i.e. to increase corticosteroids up to 20 mg/day
(with or without azathioprine) and in non-responders
switching from a cyclosporine to tacrolimus-based regimen[55]. The addition of mycophenolate 2 g/day had been
effective in some non-responders. The calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and mycophenolate have been used to treat
AIH in the native liver, and may be effective in the graft.
Treatment should be guided by the liver tests, levels
of IgG, auto-antibodies and liver histology. However, not
all patients respond to enhanced immunosuppression.
Eventually, re-LT may be required in some patients.
Transplantation centres commonly maintain AIH patients
on prednisone and/or higher dose immunosuppression than
non-AIH patients after LT in order to reduce rejection and
recurrence rates, but the usefulness of this approach
requires further evaluation.
Conflict of interest None.
