Malignancy has become one of the three major causes of death after transplantation in the
past decade and is thus increasingly important in all organ transplant programs. Death from
cardiovascular disease and infection are both decreasing in frequency from a combination of
screening, prophylaxis, aggressive risk factor management, and interventional therapies.
Cancer, on the other hand, is poorly and expensively screened for; risk factors are mostly
elusive and/or hard to impact on except for the use of immunosuppression itself; and finally
therapeutic approaches to the transplant recipient with cancer are often nihilistic. This article
provides a review of each of the issues as they come to affect transplantation: cancer before
wait-listing, cancer transmission from the donor, cancer after transplantation, outcomes of
transplant recipients after a diagnosis of cancer, and the role of screening and therapy in
reducing the impact of cancer in transplant recipients.

THE POTENTIAL TRANSPLANT
RECIPIENT WITH A PREEXISTING
DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER
With the exception of a number of patients
accepted for liver transplantation because they
have a diagnosis of liver cancer (who will not
be further considered in this work), the goal of
most pretransplant assessment programs is to
avoid transplantation of the patient who has
had a cancer or who has an occult primary or
secondary cancer. The two reasons for avoiding
such patients are
(1) because transplantation does not improve
and may reduce the patients’ prognosis, and

(2) to avoid placing scarce donated organs into
recipients with a limited prognosis.
Patients with chronic kidney, liver, or lung
disease are at an increased risk of having had a
primary cancer. The relative risk of a patient
with chronic kidney disease developing cancer
is increased with a glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) of ,50 mL/min, men having a 29% increase in cancer risk for every 10 mL reduction
in GFR (Wong et al. 2009a). The incidence of
cancer is also increased in patients who are commenced on dialysis therapy. A proportion of
that excess risk of cancer is not because chronic
kidney disease increases cancer risk but because
cancer increases or directly causes end-stage
kidney failure. Examples are multiple myeloma
and renal cell cancers, both of which may lead to
kidney failure or in the case of renal cell cancer,
to bilateral nephrectomy. It is thus important to
remove such end-stage renal failure-associated
cancers and examine the risk of the remaining
cancers. This has been undertaken in a number
of national population-based studies in which
the determination of kidney disease status is
taken from the dialysis and transplant registries
and the cancer data from the national or regional cancer databases, with the two databases then
linked at an individual patient level. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) is a ratio of the
number of cancers seen in the study population compared with an age and sex match general population and is the best measure of increased risk because of the strong sex and age
relationships for most cancers. An Australian
analysis showed that the overall increased risk
of a number of cancers in the Australian dialysis
population (SIR 1.35), with specific cancers increased substantially such as Kaposi’s sarcoma
(SIR 19.6), lip cancer (SIR 1.87), and of course,
the renal failure-associated cancers (Vajdic et al.
2006). Table 1 gives a list of the SIRs for different
cancers in the predialysis, dialysis, and transplant populations in Australia. It is thus important to consider the risk profile of every patient
being assessed for transplantation with particular attention being paid to the past medical history of cancer and any signs, symptoms, or tests
that may suggest cancer, such as iron deficiency
anemia, a breast lump, or past history of multiple skin cancers.
The main problem that transplant units
must contend with is the patient with a definite
history of cancer at some time before consideration for wait-listing for transplantation. Will
the cancer return or metastasize and will immunosuppression increase that chance? These are
the fundamental questions that must be considered for each individual patient. Each cancer is
different and the stage of the cancer and type of
treatment given, as well as the time from the
diagnosis to the proposed transplantation need
consideration. There are no certain answers to
these questions, even when one knows the particular circumstances for an individual recipient, yet each set of transplant assessment clinical practice guidelines provides a clear answer
for the most common cancers (Table 2) (Knoll
et al. 2005; Batabyal et al. 2012). The word
“guideline” must be respected carefully because
these are merely guidelines to the normal behavior of a particular cancer type and the expected outcomes under immunosuppression.
Cancers that are uninfluenced by immunosuppression can perhaps be considered differently to those that are heavily impacted, such as
Kaposi’s sarcoma or lymphomas, but there is
no substitute for the potential recipient’s oncologist defining the chance of recurrence or metastasis.
THE DONOR WITH PREEXISTING
CANCER
There are sporadic reports of cancer being transmitted through organ donation in the 1970s,
with the issue being championed by Penn
(1993) and his colleagues through voluntary
data collection and reporting. The rate at which
different cancers were transmitted from donor
to recipient gave rise to a donor selection strategy, which specifically included deceased organ
donors with, for example, cerebral malignancy,
but excluded all donors with a history of malignant cancer capable of metastasis. The experience of the last two decades has been driven, on
the one hand, by selective risk taking, and on the
other, by risk avoidance. The risk taking has

been through active selection of donors with a
known previous medical history of cancers that
are likely to be cured; for example, a donor with
a resected early-stage colon cancer several years
before the proposed donation. The risk aversion, on the other hand, has been to separate
the various cerebral malignancies into low and
high risk and avoid donors with high-grade gliomas or with prior surgical interventions that
increase the risk of extracerebral metastasis.
Deceased Donors with a History of Cancer
The major problem with an evidence-based
strategy for avoiding the risk of cancer transmission from organ donation has been first that

therewill of course never be a randomized study,
and second, the incidence of any cancer transmission is so low that sporadic case reports are
themain source of information. The publication
bias against single case reports means that this
source of data is highly likely to underestimate
the true incidence, and the low frequency and
very variable stage of cancers mean that definitive risk calculations are impossible. A list of
cancers that are reported to have been transmitted is shown in Table 3. The common features
are cancers of the organ being transplanted—
especially, renal cell carcinomas; and cancers
with a high propensity for metastasis to the organs being donated.
There have been initiatives designed to ensure reporting of cancers that may have been
transmitted by the donated organ in the U.S.
and European environments. At a global level
there is now a World Health Organization
sponsored website (www.notifylibrary.org) to
provide for a curated library of reported donor-related adverse events and incidents, including both transmitted infection and malignancy. These efforts have helped define the
lexicon—for example, what evidence is required
to impute that a cancer in a recipient has been
transmitted from the donor, as opposed to developed in the transplanted organ? A renal cell
cancer in a transplanted kidney may or may not
have been present in the organ at donation. If
there is DNA evidence that the tumor is of donor origin and other recipients of organs from
the same donor have also suffered from the same
renal cell cancer, then one may designate the
event as a proven donor-transmitted cancer. If
the time between transplantation and donation
is short, for example, a matter of weeks, then it is
highly probable that the cancer is donor transmitted. On the other hand, if the time delay is
several years between the donation and the cancer diagnosis, it is more likely that it has developed in situ and thus donor derived.
There have been a number of approaches to
guidance on the acceptance of risk of donorderived disease including the U.S. Donor Transmitted Assessment Committee (DTAC) and the
Council of Europe (Nalesnik et al. 2011). Table 4
shows the DTAC framework for consideration
of risk of donor-transmitted disease that allows
physicians and recipients to consider the specific issues related to a particular donor. The DTAC
has assessed the stratification of different malignancies into the various risk bands and has proTable 3. Cancers known to have been transmitted

vided a useful resource for such decision making (Nalesnik et al. 2011).
Living Donor Assessment for Cancer Risk
The first reported case of cancer transmission
from a living organ donor was a breast cancer
transmitted from a donor wife to recipient husband, but lung, lymphoma, and renal cell cancer have also been recorded (Kauffman et al.
2002). The young age of most living organ
donors provides a degree of protection against
cancer transmission because of the strong ageassociated risk of cancer; however, many of the
common cancers such as breast, colon, prostate,
cervix, and in Australia also melanoma, are
sufficiently prevalent that one case might be
expected to be transmitted unknowingly every
5000 living donations. Screening of living donors for these cancers should thus be part of
routine assessment.
DE NOVO MALIGNANCY AFTER
TRANSPLANTATION
Cancer is a major source of morbidity and
mortality following solid organ transplantation. Overall risk of cancer is increased between
two- and threefold compared with the general
population of the same age and sex. Recipients
of solid organ transplants typically experience
cancer rates similar to nontransplanted people
20 –30 years older, and risk is inversely related to
age, with younger recipients experiencing a far
greater relative increase in risk compared with
older recipients (risk increased by 15 –30 times
for children, but twofold for those transplanted
.65 years) (Webster et al. 2007). Posttransplant
cancer risk is increased 40% for those with a
prior cancer, and similarly by white race. Overall, diabetics may experience fewer cancers, but
this may be owing to the competing risk of an
increased burden of cardiovascular disease (i.e.,
diabetics may succumb to heart disease before
they develop cancer).
However, risk does vary by cancer site, and
in applying evidence in clinical practice it is wise
to be aware that when thinking about absolute
risk, even a small relative risk increase for a common cancer may be more important to consider
for some patients than a large relative risk of an
uncommon cancer (Table 1). Reasons for the
increased risk of most cancers after transplantation are likely owing to the interplay of several
factors: the organ transplanted, prior and new
exposure to viral infections, total load and duration of immunosuppression, perhaps the specific components of the immunosuppressive
regimen, and the recipients accumulated baseline exposures known to increase cancer risk in
the general population.
Variation in Cancer Risk According
to Transplanted Organ
Table 5 summarizes the published standardized
incidence ratios (SIR) for several different cancer sites, stratified by transplanted organ, taken
from national population-based studies (Kyllo¨-
nen et al. 2000; Adami et al. 2003; Vajdic et al.
2006; Villeneuve et al. 2007; Collett et al. 2010;
Jiang et al. 2010; Engels et al. 2011; Na et al.
2013). SIR can be interpreted as relative risk, as
they estimate risk for organ recipients relative to
the cancer incidence experienced by the general
population, after allowing for differences in age,
sex, and year of diagnosis. For each cancer site,
the magnitude of increased risk is largely similar across different countries, and where differences exist, this is largely attributable to era of
study and methodology of calculation. However, although the overall risk for all-site cancer
is of similar magnitude across organ recipients,
the incidence of specific cancers does vary by
transplanted organ. In general, kidney cancer
risk is greatest for kidney recipients (increased
approximately eightfold), and similarly, risk of
lung cancer is highest for lung recipients (approximately fivefold risk), and liver cancer for
liver recipients (although here, given that liver
cancer is an indication for liver transplantation,
interpretation is not straightforward). Risk of
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), is elevated
by .5 times for all organ recipients, but the
magnitude of risk is by far the greatest for lung
and heart recipients compared with those who
receive other solid organs (Table 5) (Opelz and
Do¨hler 2004).

Variation in Risk by Cancer Site
The magnitude of cancer risk varies by cancer
site. Registry data from around the world has
established that the pattern of increase in risk
for cancer at different sites is seen consistently (Kyllo¨nen et al. 2000; Adami et al. 2003; Vajdic et al. 2006; Villeneuve et al. 2007; Collett
et al. 2010; Jiang et al. 2010; Engels et al. 2011;
Na et al. 2013). Cancers that are very greatly increased in the transplanted populations
are nonmelanoma skin cancer and lip cancer
(.10-fold increased risk), Kaposi sarcoma
(.50-fold increased risk), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (greater than eightfold increase), and
cancers of the anogenital tract (greater than
fourfold increase for vaginal, cervical, vulval,
anal, and penile cancers). Other cancers have
only a moderately increased relative risk in
transplant recipients, but because they occur
moderately frequently in the general population, the result of a small relative increase is clinically important. Examples are colorectal cancer
(40% increase), melanoma (approximately
double risk), and lung cancer (.50% increase).
Cancer at more than 20 other sites also show
significant increased risk, including head and
neck, thyroid, esophagus, stomach, leukemias,
and plasma cell tumors. Notable cancers that
do not show an increase in risk for organ transplant recipients are breast cancer and prostate
cancer.
Skin cancers, specifically basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers, are common after transplantation, and incidence increases with time.
Australian estimates in kidney recipients found
50% experienced at least one skin cancer by 10
years and 80% by 20 years after transplantation
(Ramsay et al 2002). Accurate estimates of risk
relative to the general population are challenging to generate, and most national cancer registries do not record skin cancers, thus understanding incidence in the general population
is not straightforward. However, best estimates
are that organ recipients risk of basal cell cancer
is 10-fold, and squamous cell up to 100-fold;
squamous cell cancers exceed basal cell cancers
by 4:1, a reversal of the situation in the general population. This excess risk is modified by
skin pigmentation, such that black recipients
have much reduced risk compared with white
recipients.
The Role of Viral Infection in Carcinogenesis
after Transplantation
It is widely recognized that virus infection is
implicated in a number of cancer sites in the
general population, and also through study in
patients with acquired immune dysfunction
such as those with HIV and AIDS. Transplant
patients are vulnerable to viral infection or reactivation of latent infection. Viruses implicated in carcinogenesis include Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8),
human papillomavirus (HPV), the Merkel cell
polyomavirus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The
rapidity with which some malignancies develop after transplantation also is consistent with
the concept that viral oncogenesis is involved
because initiation of immunosuppression may
promote unchecked viral replication. There is
also evidence in kidney recipients that after
transplant failure and reduction or cessation of
immunosuppression, the risk of virus-related
cancers decreases back to levels seen in pretransplant dialysis patients (Van Leeuwen et al. 2010).
EBV is implicated in the development of
Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkins lymphoma,
and other manifestations of PTLD, as well as
nasopharyngeal cancers and leiomyosarcomas.
EBV is common in the general population, and
in most parts of the world 90% of adults will
show serological evidence of exposure. The classification of PTLD has changed over time as
understanding has evolved. Current classification is the 2008 WHO system (Swerdlow et al.
2008). Lymphoma is among the most frequent
cancers experienced by transplant recipients,
and for the majority (but not all), EBV can be
shown in the tumor tissue. Approximately 80%
of all PTLD arises from B-cell proliferation induced by EBV. The remaining 20% of PTLD
arises predominantly from T cells, about onethird of which have implicated EBV in causation. The majority of PTLD arise within two
years of transplantation, with a further later
peak of incidence beyond five years. Principal

risk factors for PTLD include negative EBV serostatus at the time of transplantation (which
means children are particularly vulnerable), and
the degree of immunosuppression, particularly
anti-T-cell agents, which impair EBV-specific
T-cell-mediated immune surveillance. PTLD
may arise in donor tissue, and it is not uncommon for PTLD to arise in proximity to the transplanted organ. Recipients of kidney transplants
are more likely to get renal lymphoma than
recipients of heart transplants; similarly heart
transplant recipients more commonly get cardiac or thoracic PTLD than kidney recipients
(Opelz and Do¨hler 2004).
HHV8 is associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma,
as well as primary effusion lymphoma, and has
been implicated in multiple myeloma. HHV8
infection prevalence shows geographical variation, being more common in Mediterranean
and African regions where 30%–50% of the general population shows serological evidence of
infection, whereas prevalence is 20% in Southeast Asia and Northern Europe. In the immunocompetent, Kaposi’s sarcoma is an indolent
cutaneous disease that rarely disseminates; however, under immunosuppression disease is more
aggressive, more frequently multicentric, and
visceral involvement is more common. Visceral
involvement is more likely in heart and lung
recipients (up to 50% of cases) compared with
kidney recipients. HHV8 is present in tumor
tissue and there is usually serological evidence
of infection. The main risk factor for posttransplant Kaposi’s sarcoma is origin from an area of
high seroprevalence, but there is also a male:female ratio of 3:1. Tumor cells may also be donor
derived, and HHV8 infection may be transmitted from donor to recipient. Initial treatment of
Kaposi’s sarcoma is reduction of immunosuppression, which usually prompts regression.
HPV is associated with anogenital cancers
including cervical, vaginal, vulval, penile, and
anal cancers, head and neck cancer, and is implicated in squamous cell skin cancers. Cancer
risk at all of these sites is increased in organ
transplant recipients. HPV has multiple genotypes, and different subsets are associated with
different cancers. The role of HPV is supported
by HPV DNA being found in cancers and precancers at these sites. Anogenital cancers often
occur together (for example, cervical and vulval, or penile and anal), and may manifest as
extensive or multiple lesions. Transmission of
HPV is by close personal contact, including sexual contact for anogenital infection, and is commonly asymptomatic.
Merkel cell carcinoma is increased in transplant recipients and people with HIV but is very
rare in the general population. It is an aggressive, predominantly intradermal, neuroendocrine malignancy, known for local recurrence
and lymph node metastases. Merkel cell polyomavirus can be detected in .80% of tumors.
Chronic hepatitis B infection is associated
with development of hepatocellular carcinoma,
risk is exacerbated by coinfection with hepatitis C, and increased further posttransplantation
as immunosuppression promotes viral replication.
THE ROLE OF COMPONENTS OF THE
IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE REGIMEN
Overall cancer risk is moderated by duration
and intensity of immunosuppression, rather
than individual components of the drug regimen. This view is given weight by equivocal
and contradictory findings in a range of studies
of risk factors for cancer after transplantation,
which have failed to consistently show association of overall increased cancer risk with any
specific drug. Indirect evidence for this view is
that some studies have shown that episodes of
acute rejection within the first year posttransplant confer increased risk of subsequent malignancy. Those recipients experiencing acute
rejection are treated by pulses of increased immunosuppression, thus increasing their immunosuppressive burden overall. It is possible that
small differences of effect do exist among drugs,
but that these are outweighed by the far greater
effects of other known risk factors for cancer, such as age, sex, history of smoking, underlying disease leading to transplantation, and
history of prior cancers (Webster et al. 2007;
Gallagher et al. 2010). Given the large effect of
these known risk factors and the need to balance
long-term cancer risk against recipient and graft

survival, any small differences among drugs are
likely to be clinically unimportant.
In vitro studies suggest calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus promote carcinogenesis, potentially through production of
cytokines that regulate tumor growth (such as
transforming growth factor-b), metastasis, and
angiogenesis. However, differences among recipients taking cyclosporine versus those that
are not has not resulted in differences in cancer
in long-term trials (Gallagher et al. 2010).
Azathioprine acts on DNA and RNA mechanisms, inhibiting repair of splicing and ultimately disrupting lymphocyte proliferation.
When used as a single agent to treat autoimmune diseases, azathioprine is associated with
anincreased riskof lymphomas and anincreased
risk of a wide range of solid neoplasms, including squamous cell carcinomas, urinary
bladder tumors, breast carcinomas, and brain
tumors. However, in organ transplant recipients, comparing immunosuppression regimens
with and without Azathipoprine has not resulted in differences in cancer incidence (Gallagher
et al. 2010).Mycophenolatewas originally developed as an anticancer drug, and acts through
blockage of the purine biosynthesis, inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. In
transplant registry studies mycophenolate-containing regimens have not shown differences
in cancer rates compared with mycophenolatefree regimens, but do suggest lower rates of acute
rejection.
Mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors
(MTORi) sirolimus and everolimus act by blocking T and B lymphocytes proliferation by preventing activation of the mTOR, which then
halts the progression from the G1 to the S phase
of the cell cycle. In addition, mTORIs also inhibit the translation of transcription factors
resulting in reduced angiogenesis, preventing
the multiprotein complexes (mTORC1 and
mTORC2) pathway activation, thereby halting
cell proliferation, particularly in the setting of
cancer development (Guba et al. 2004). MTORi
have antineoplastic properties, and show promise in reducing cancer recurrence while permitting ongoing immunosuppression (Law 2005).
However, it is still not clear whether MTORicontaining regimens have any benefit in reducing de novo cancer risk.
For some specific cancers, lymphocyte-depleting antibodies such as antithymocyte globulin preparations may be implicated in causality. These agents appear to consistently increase
risk of early EBV-driven PTLD (Opelz and Do¨hler 2004).
SURVIVAL AND OUTCOMES IN
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS WITH CANCER
Not only does the risk of developing de novo
cancer increase after kidney transplantation, the
prognoses of recipients diagnosed with cancer
is much worse than patients with transplants
or cancer alone. Data from the Australian and
New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry
have shown that transplanted women with
breast cancer have an excess mortality of at least
40% compared with women with breast cancers
in the general population. For men with colorectal cancers and kidney transplant, the overall
5-year survival is 27% compared with 75% for
those in the general population with cancer but
without transplants (Webster and Wong 2008).
In a Dutch kidney transplant population,
the median patient survival after the diagnoses
of cancer was only 2.7 years, compared with an
average survival of recipients without cancer
of 8.3 years ( p , 0.0001) (van de Wetering et
al. 2010). Cancers developed in transplant recipients were often more aggressive and developed at a much later stage than patients without
transplants. Recent data from the Israel Penn
Registry showed that the stage-specific survival
for certain cancer types such as colon, lung,
breast, prostate, and bladder cancers was significantly lower in patients with transplants
compared with those in the general population
(Miao et al. 2009).
On the contrary, using the United States
Renal Data System (USRDS) cohort, a higher
standardized cancer mortality ratio was observed only in younger recipients without a
competing cardiovascular risk factor such as diabetes. Among older transplant recipients with
diabetes, heart disease, and prior stroke, the
overall standard mortality ratios for cancer are

much lower than that in the age and gender
matched general population. The interpretation
is that the potential competing risk of death
from cardiovascular disease dampens the effect
of immunosuppression on cancer risk in older
transplant recipients (Kiberd et al. 2009).
Reasons for the poorer cancer outcomes
in kidney transplant recipients are unclear. Previous studies have shown that patients with
chronic kidney disease are less likely to receive
cancer screening because of the perceived reduced survival benefits compared with people
without kidney disease, leading to the development of aggressive, more advanced stage disease at the time of cancer diagnoses. Transplant
clinicians may also be reluctant to instigate intensive chemotherapeutic treatment and surgical intervention because of coexisting comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. The
fear of rejection and potential graft loss may
also prevent the introduction of immunotherapy and withdrawal/reduction in immunosuppression.
INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE CANCER
OUTCOMES AND SURVIVAL
In view of the higher cancer incidence and poorer prognoses, prevention and screening may play
an important role in reducing the burden of
cancer in kidney transplant recipients. Routine
cancer screening is recommended for all transplant individuals. Recommendations for cancer
screening in transplant recipients are mostly extrapolated from the general populations and are
consistent with screening guidelines in the general population, with the exception of cervical,
skin, colorectal, and renal cancers.
Screening for Cervical Cancer
The overall incidence of cervical cancers in
women who received a kidney transplant is at
least two to three times greater than the age and
gender matched population. Despite the lack
of evidence from screening trials in transplant
recipients, current recommendations suggested
more frequent cytologic screening (annual instead of biannual) because of the belief that
precancerous lesions may progress more rapidly under the influence of immunosuppression. Apart from clinical effectiveness, recent
modeled analyses reported that routine annual
screening is cost-effective in women with kidney
transplants, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the order of $12,000 per
life year saved and total gains of 0.05 life years
per women screened. On the contrary, implementing HPV vaccination in HPV naı¨ve women
under the existing screening program is expensive, and may add only modest benefits. A program of HPV vaccination and screening would
have to vaccinate a total of 1000 HPV naı¨ve
women before transplantation, to save one extra
death from cervical cancers over a screening period of 50 years (Wong et al. 2009b). Although
the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines
appear promising in reducing the incidence of
HPV-16 and -18 cervical dysplasia among the
general population, there is a lack of trial data
showing the immunogenicity and effectiveness
of HPV vaccination in immunosuppressed individuals.
Screening for Breast Cancer
Biennial mammographic screening for breast
cancer is standard practice in the general population. The American Transplant Society (AST)
and the European Best Practice Guidelines
(EBPG) recommend breast cancer screening in
all female transplant recipients between 50 and
69 years of age (Kasiske et al. 2000, 2001; European Best Practice Guidelines for Renal Transplantation 2002). For women between 40 and
49 years of age, transplanted women could still
undergo screening annually or biennially. However, evidence for or against screening in this
group of transplanted women remains unclear.
Transplanted women undergoing screening
mammography should also be aware of the potential false-positive findings, particularly in
women who developed large, dense, and multiple benign breast adenomas from long-term cyclosporine use. False-positive findings will lead
to unnecessary and exhaustive diagnostic procedures such as fine-needle and core biopsies of
the breasts.

Screening for Bowel Cancer
There is now consistent evidence showing an
increased risk of colorectal cancer by at least
two- to threefold among those with renal allografts. However, recommendations for screening bowel cancer are far from being standardized
across the various different transplant practice
guidelines groups. The AST recommends annual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years in the United
States (Kasiske et al. 2000, 2001). In Australia,
biennial screening using the immunochemical
FOBT is the recommended screening tool by
the National Health and Medical Research
Council (NHMRC). In Europe, the EBPG suggested annual screening for all transplant recipients using iFOBTs. All positive screening tests
need to be followed by diagnostic colonoscopies
(European Best Practice Guidelines for Renal
Transplantation 2002).
Although there is to date, no trial-based
evidence for cancer screening in this at-risk
population, early cancer detection is effective.
Previously modeled analyses have shown that
colorectal cancer screening is probably effective
in transplanted patients, but uncertainties exist;
in particular, the costs, the test specificity, and
the patient preferences for screening in patients
with comorbidities (Wong et al 2008). A recent
diagnostic test accuracy study conducted in a
South Australian cohort of transplanted recipients suggested that the test sensitivity of immunochemical FOBTmay be low at 36% compared
with the expected test performance characteristics in the nontransplanted populations (Collins et al. 2012).
Screening for Skin Cancers
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in transplanted patients. Skin cancer prevention with sun-protective behaviors such as using sunscreen (SPF 15þ), sun hats, avoidance
of exposure to ultraviolet radiation during sunpeak hours, and covering up with pants and
long-sleeve tops are effective measures to reduce
the incidence of skin cancers and should be
encouraged. Transplant follow-up combined
with regular skin surveillance by experienced
dermatologists should be advocated for all transplant units. Prophylactic treatment with retinoid acitretin or low-dose capecitabine in the
secondary prevention of skin cancers appears
to be efficacious in reducing the incidence rates
of squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma in
solid organ transplant recipients with manageable toxicity profile, but the use of these agents
remains heterogenous.
Screening for Renal Cancers
Screening for urinary tract cancers using ultrasonography may be useful for high-risk patients
such as those with a history of analgesic use or
acquired cystic disease of the kidneys, but may
not be cost-effective for all recipients of kidney transplants. A major concern associated
with ultrasonographic screening is the test performance characteristics of the screening tool.
The accuracy of ultrasonography is an important determinant of screening efficiency, but is
uncertain in recipients of kidney transplants.
Ultrasonography is not only operator dependent but performance varies with the size and
morphology of the patient, the kidneys, and the
tumor. The difficulties associated with ultrasonographic screening in people with ESKD include the effect of multicystic diseases and small
scarred native kidneys on the overall test accuracy and poor reliability in differentiating small
hyperechoic renal cancers from lesions such as
adenomas and angiomyolipomas (Bunnapradist and Vincenti 2009; Wong et al. 2011).
MANAGEMENT OF CANCER IN KIDNEY
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS
Surgical resection and radiotherapy remain the
preferred treatment for most early-stage and locally invasive tumors among transplanted patients. Although there is a lack of trial-based
evidence, judicious reduction in immunosuppression with regular monitoring of disease
progression and graft function may be warranted, particularly among those with high-grade
and advanced disease.

Over the past decades, mammalian target
of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORI) have been
proposed to have a dual role in transplantation:
immunosuppression and antioncogenic activities for transplanted patients. From the clinical
perspective, retrospective analyses have shown
reduced incidence of de novo cancer among
those who received mTORIs as immunosuppression compared with recipients on calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). Post hoc analyses of immunosuppression trials such as the CONVERT
have shown a reduction in the incidence of skin
cancer in the sirolimus cohort compared with
those remaining on CNIs (Bunnapradist and
Vincenti 2009; Alberu´ et al. 2011).
More recently, two randomized controlled
trials have been conducted in kidney transplant
recipients designed specifically to evaluate the
effectiveness of mTORI as immunosuppressive
agents in the context of malignancy. In the Australian study, a total of 96 kidney transplant
recipients were randomized to receive maintenance CNIs or conversion to mTORIs. With a
median follow-up period of 3.6 years, the overall incidence of new squamous cell skin cancer
(SCC) among patients with a prior history of
skin cancer was significantly lower than those
on CNIs (0.88 versus 1.71 per-patient year, p ¼
0.038) (Campbell et al. 2012). A similar study,
conducted in Lyons, France, randomized 120
high-risk transplanted patients with a prior
history of SCCs reported a lower proportion
of transplant recipients developed new SCCs
in the mTORI group compared with those in
the CNIs group. (47.6% vs. 70.5%, p ¼ 0.048).
However, poor tolerability of mTORI remains
a major concern (Euvrard et al. 2012). More
than 35% of transplant recipients discontinued
mTORI treatment owing to significant side effects such as ankle swelling, acne, pneumonitis,
and proteinuria, and infective complications
have prevented the longer-term use of mTORI
in these high-risk groups.
Therapeutic measures (both preventive and
therapeutic) for melanomas are less well studied. Other novel treatment strategies for metastatic melanoma such as the antiangiogenic and
immunomodulatory drugs, the proteasome inhibitors, and the specific targeted molecular
therapies have been implicated in the general
population (Simeone and Ascerto 2012). However, the efficacy and safety of using these newer
agents are unclear and unproven in the transplant population.
mTORI have also been shown to be effective
in achieving successful clinical and histological
remission of Kaposi sarcoma. Previous studies
have shown that phase II and III trials have
shown antitumor activity and survival advantage in patients with metastatic renal cancers
treated with mTORI (Rao et al. 2004; Baldo et
al. 2008; Amato et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2011). In
the transplant population, the clinical effectiveness of mTORI for the prevention and treatment of renal cell carcinomas remained unclear.
