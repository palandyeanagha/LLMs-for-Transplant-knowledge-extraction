Abstract
Background: The morbidity and mortality associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in
immunocompromised patients (especially in HIV-infected patients and transplant recipients), as
well as with congenital CMV infection are well known. In contrast, relatively little attention has
been paid to the morbidity and mortality that CMV infection may cause in immunocompetent
patients.
Methods: We reviewed the evidence associated with severe manifestations of CMV infection in
apparently immunocompetent patients and the potential role of antiviral treatment for these
infections. We searched in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for the period of 1950–2007
to identify relevant articles.
Results: We retrieved 89 articles reporting on severe CMV infection in 290 immunocompetent
adults. Among these reports, the gastrointestinal tract (colitis) and the central nervous system
(meningitis, encephalitis, transverse myelitis) were the most frequent sites of severe CMV infection.
Manifestations from other organ-systems included haematological disorders (haemolytic anaemia,
thrombocytopenia), thrombosis of the venous or arterial vascular system, ocular involvement
(uveitis), and lung disease (pneumonitis). The clinical practice reported in the literature has been
to prescribe antiviral treatment for the most severe manifestations of monophasic
meningoencephalitis (seizures and coma), ocular involvement, and lung involvement due to CMV.
Conclusion: Severe life-threatening complications of CMV infection in immunocompetent
patients may not be as rare as previously thought.
Introduction
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause severe disease in
immunocompromised patients, either via reactivation of
latent CMV infection or via acquisition of primary CMV
infection. Clinical syndromes that may be observed in this
setting include encephalitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, uveitis, retinitis, colitis, and graft rejection. Furthermore, CMV
infection affecting the human embryo, a host with immature immunologic responses, is often associated with serious complications, such as microcephaly, mental

retardation, spastic paralysis, hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, deafness, and optic nerve atrophy leading to blindness.
To the contrary, in immunocompetent patients, primary
CMV infection typically runs an undifferentiated viral syndrome, or is manifested by a mononucleosis-like syndrome. Infections in the immunocompetent and
immunosupressed are not rare; seroprevalence for CMV
worldwide ranges from ~60%–100% [1]. Symptomatic
CMV infection in non-immunocompromised hosts has
traditionally been considered to have a benign, self-limited course. However, in the medical literature there are a
considerable number of reports of severe clinical manifestations of CMV infection in immunocompetent patients.
An issue that has not been comprehensively resolved is
the potential role of specific antiviral treatment for immunocompetent patients with pronounced clinical manifestations related to CMV infection. Although current
opinion is that CMV infection in immunocompetent
patients does not require treatment, the risks and benefits
of specific antiviral treatment for severely ill patients are
not adequately addressed. In this context, we sought to
review the biomedical literature for reports regarding
severe CMV infections in immunocompetent patients,
and to evaluate, on the basis of existing evidence, the role
of antiviral treatment, if any, for these patients.
Methods
Literature search
We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding serious manifestations of CMV infection in apparently
immunocompetent individuals. Two reviewers (PIR and
EGM) independently searched PubMed, Scopus, and the
Cochrane Library for relevant articles published between
1950 and 2007. Search terms applied were "CMV",
"cytomegalovirus", "severe", "immunocompetent", "fulminant", and "fatal", in various combinations. The reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by the searches were
also reviewed. Reports included in our review were limited to those written in English, German, or French.
Study selection criteria
We included any study that reported severe CMV infection
in immunocompetent patients. We defined as severe any
CMV infection for which the patient was hospitalized
and/or the infection was deemed to be of a life-threatening degree. The various types of CMV infections were
grouped with regard to the afflicted body system or site, as
defined by the authors of the original reports, into infections of: the gastrointestinal tract; the central nervous system; lungs; eyes; or skin. In addition, categories of CMV
infections characterized as severe included any CMV infection causing vascular thrombosis; weight loss of over 10
kg; a vasculitic rash; perineal ulcers; or an eruption consisting of numerous vesicular or pustular lesions, throughout the body; any CMV infection causing liver
involvement of a degree to necessitate hospitalisation, or
a liver biopsy, or accompanied by at least a five-fold rise
of alanine transaminase serum value or jaundice. Immunological competence was defined by the absence of: a
congenital or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; a
history of allogeneic transplantation (except for corneal
transplantation); or immunosuppressive treatment
(including antineoplastic chemotherapy, and long-term
glucocorticosteroid therapy). We excluded cases of congenital CMV infection, patients with inflammatory bowel
disease that had received systemic or topical steroids in
the month preceding the CMV infection, and, patients
with clinical syndromes that are attributed to aberrant
immunological responses triggered by the presence of
CMV, rather than to tissue damage related to active replication of the virus (such as the Guillain-Barré syndrome).
The diagnosis of CMV infection for this review required at
least one of the following laboratory methods: serology,
specific intrathecal antibody production, virus isolation,
direct detection of CMV pp65 antigen in blood, CMV culture, biopsy, positive specific immunohistochemical
staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (mainly
quantitative results examined together with clinical findings as false -positive results are a possibility), confocal
microscopy of the eyes (to detect the "owl's eye" morphology in the corneal endothelium), or in situ hybridization.
Serological studies indicating an acute CMV infection
included the presence of positive IgM anti-CMV antibodies, or of a significant increase in the titre of IgG anti-CMV
antibodies in paired samples obtained during the infection.
Three reviewers (PIR, EGM, ICV) independently assessed
all retrieved articles, on the basis of title and abstract, for
the purpose of determining eligibility for inclusion in the
systematic review. Any differences in the extracted data
between the three reviewers were resolved in meetings of
all authors.
Definition of infection outcomes
Cure was defined as the complete resolution of symptoms
and signs attributed to the CMV infection, in conjunction
with normalization of any related laboratory abnormalities. Improvement was defined as partial resolution of
symptoms and signs attributed to the CMV infection, with
clinical stability of any associated residual organ dysfunction. Failure was defined as lack of improvement, or deterioration, or death attributed to the CMV infection. Death
due to other concomitant illness was not taken into
account in determining infection outcome.

Results
The literature search yielded 273 articles with potential
relevance to our study. After screening these articles on the
basis of title and abstract, we excluded 184 of them, primarily because they did not focus on severe CMV infections in immunocompetent patients. Thus, 89 different
studies, reporting on 290 patients, were identified for our
review [[2-8], Additional file 1]. The table 'review of case
reports of severe CMV infections in immunocompetent
patients' (see Additional file 1) summarizes data extracted
from studies that were not included in previous relevant
reviews, and thus they were first identified in this review.
In Table 1 we summarize the findings of previous reviews
relevant to our study.
The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was the primary site of
involvement by the CMV infection in 91 patients (32
identified in this review plus 59 included in previous
reviews, performed by Galliatsatos et al [3]; and Karakozis
et al [5]). As identified by the diagnostic tests performed
in the respective studies, CMV infection of the GIT was
classified as gastroenteritis, duodenitis, ileitis, colitis,
proctitis, or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease.
Concurrent manifestations of CMV disease regarding
other organ systems than the GIT, e.g. haemolytic anaemia or bleeding diathesis, was identified in a limited
number of cases. The symptoms observed in patients with
CMV involvement of the GIT included fever, diffuse
abdominal pain, or pain located in the lower abdominal
quadrants, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss,
watery or bloody diarrhoea, haematochezia, and
melaena. The signs recorded in the physical examination
of these patients, included abdominal tenderness, or
rebound tenderness and abnormal bowel sounds. The
diagnostic investigations performed in these patients,
included abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography
of the abdomen, GIT endoscopy (gastroscopy, colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy) with biopsy, and stool cultures.
Fourteen out of the 32 cases identified received treatment
with ganciclovir (in 3 cases administered in combination
with valganciclovir), whereas 2 received valganciclovir
alone, and 16 did not receive any antiviral therapy. Two
patients died, one of which was receiving therapy.
Central nervous system (CNS) disorders constituted the
second most frequent manifestations of CMV infection in
immunocompetent patients. Specifically, patients with
involvement of the CNS by cytomegalovirus presented
with various combinations of the following symptoms
and signs: fever, chills, fatigue, myalgia, motor deficits
(localized weakness, paraplegia), sensory abnormalities
(numbness, hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia, dysaesthesia,
anaesthesia), disorientation, confusion, unilateral or
bilateral visual loss, urinary retention, constipation, or
coma.
Fifty-six immunocompetent patients with severe CNS
CMV infection were identified (19 patients first reported
herein plus 37 included in previous reviews performed by
Devetag et al [6]; Eddleston et al [7]; and Cohen et al [8]).
All of these patients presented with symptoms and signs
of myelitis, encephalomyelitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, meningitis, or meningoradiculopathy. Nine of
the 19 patients that were first identified in this review
received specific antiviral treatment (6 with ganciclovir, 2
with acyclovir, and 1 with valganciclovir), whereas 10 of
these patients did not receive any specific antiviral therapy. None of the 19 patients died.
Twenty-five immunocompetent patients were identified
as having haematological disorders caused by CMV infection. These disorders included: symptomatic thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, disseminated intravascular
coagulation, myelodysplastic changes, pancytopenia, and
splenic rupture. This group of patients presented with a
diversity of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, abdominal or chest pain, headache, pain in the extremities,
numbness of the hands, darkening of urine due to the
presence of haemoglobin, epistaxis, easy bruising, purpura, increased incidence of infections, jaundice, and
systolic ejection murmur.
Less frequent manifestations of severe CMV infections in
immunocompetent patients included vascular thrombosis, ocular involvement, and pulmonary disease. Nineteen
patients overall (4 presented herein and 15 reported previously by Squizzato et al. [2] and Abgueguen et al. [4]),
presented with various types of blood vessel thrombosis,
including thrombosis of the portal femoropopliteal veins
and pulmonary embolism. A pro-coagulant status was
identified in the 4 of this group of patients (2 were factor
V Leiden heterozygotes, whereas 2 were receiving oral
contraceptives). These patients presented with symptoms
related to the specific site of vascular thrombosis, such as
abdominal, chest, or pelvic pain, abdominal tenderness,
dyspnoea and cyanosis, or hepatosplenomegaly. Some of
these patients had non-specific symptoms, such as fever,
myalgia, asthenia, chills, or cough.
The virus affected the eyes in 16 immunocompetent
patients, who developed uveitis, retinitis, corneal
endothelitis, or papillitis. Presenting symptoms and signs
in these patients included loss or blurring of vision, as
well as redness of the affected eyes. The diagnosis and the
monitoring of response to therapy were performed by
serum serology, slit-lamp examination, confocal microscopy, or by PCR of the aqueous humour, or of the vitreous. All but one of these patients received specific antiviral
treatment. The outcome of the patient who did not receive
antiviral treatment was not favourable. In addition,
patients were treated with corticosteroids and topical ther-

apy; timolol, atropine, cyclopentolate. Finally, patients
underwent eye surgery when indicated.
Nine immunocompetent patients had lung involvement
caused by CMV infection. Five of them developed pneumonia or interstitial pneumonitis. The symptoms and
signs of CMV pneumonitis were non-specific, and
included the following: chest pain, cough, haemoptysis,
shortness of breath, fever, sweats, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis in these patients was established
with the use of serological tests, PCR in blood, PCR or
immunohistochemistry in lung tissue (obtained through
either transbronchial or open lung biopsy), as well as with
analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Four patients
had a favourable outcome in response to specific antiviral
therapy (3 of them received ganciclovir and one did not),
while an additional patient, who received ganciclovir,
died. The remaining 4 patients were diagnosed with septal
capillary injury syndrome. Three of these patients received
antiviral treatment and showed good response to treatment, while the remaining patient, who did not receive
antiviral therapy, died.
Discussion
While manifestations of CMV infection in immunocompromised hosts have been extensively reported in biomedical literature, those observed in immunocompetent
patients have received comparatively little attention. The
study we performed shows that severe life-threatening
complications of CMV infection in immunocompetent
patients may not be as rare as previously thought. Also,
various considerations should be taken into account that
may lead to underreporting of severe CMV infections. This
may be, at least in part, due to the rather moderate accuracy of some routinely available diagnostic methods, such
as serological tests. On the other hand, molecular diagnostic methods, such as PCR, that are not universally
available, appear to be more sensitive than serological or
virus isolation tests, while they are also more rapid [9]. As
shown in our review severe CMV infections in immunocompetent patients can affect almost every system. In a
decrescendo order of frequency, severe organ involvement
in the herein reviewed reports included: the gastrointestinal tract (colitis), the central nervous system (meningitis,
encephalitis, myelitis, nerve palsies, myeloradiculopathy), haematological manifestations (haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia), the eye (uveitis, retinitis,
liver (hepatitis), lung (pneumonitis) and thrombosis of
the arterial and venous system (deep venous thrombosis,
portal vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism). Our data
regarding severe CMV infections are in concordance with
those of the literature examining cohorts with CMV infection or focusing on a severe organ involvement by the
virus.
Relatively few cohort studies, of an appreciably large size,
evaluating the incidence of severe CMV disease in immunocompetent patients, have been reported to date. In
detail, among 116 immunocompetent adults (of 19–68
years of age) with acute CMV infection, that were studied
retrospectively by Faucher et al., two (1.7%) developed
severe complications (interstitial pneumonitis and
encephalitis, respectively)[10]. In the above described
study CMV infection was diagnosed on the basis of high
initial titres of anti-CMV IgM antibodies in conjunction
with a significant seroconversion in the IgG antibody titre
during the course of illness. In another cohort of 115
patients with acute CMV infection (of 17–80 years of age),
reported by Bonnet et al., 6 (5.2%) developed severe disease (3 of them presented with leg purpura, two with
splenic haematoma and one with cutaneous vasculitis)
[11]. The diagnosis of CMV infection was based on the
initial presence of CMV IgM antibodies, in conjunction
with subsequent seroconversion, or on the detection of
CMV viraemia by blood cultures or of pp65 antigenaemia
by immunofluorescent assay. In an additional cohort
study reported by Wreghitt et al, of the 124 included
immunocompetent patients (of 16–86 years of age) who
were diagnosed with acute CMV infection, 28% suffered
from respiratory symptoms, 24% had jaundice, and 3%
presented with mental confusion, while 15% of the
patients required hospitalisation [12]. The diagnosis was
based on a high level of CMV IgM antibodies (>300 U/
mL) coupled with the appearance of IgG specific antibodies 2–3 weeks after the onset of symptoms.
As is evident in our review, the site of the gastrointestinal
tract most frequently affected by severe CMV disease in
immunocompetent patients is the colon. These data are in
concordance with those reported by Galliatsatos et al. [3]
and Karakozis et al. [5]. The mortality rate however varies
between the patients reviewed herein (6.2%) and those
previously reported (32%). Among the latter group of
patients there was a trend for higher mortality in patients
over 55 years-old, and in patients with diseases affecting
immune responses (diabetes mellitus, renal failure, pregnancy, and untreated non-haematological malignancy).
In a pathologic study including an unselected group of
6323 patients, the rate of CMV identification in gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies was 9 per thousand. Specifically,
characteristic CMV inclusion bodies were identified in 37
immunocompetent, and in 17 immunocompromised
patients [13]. The most frequent gastrointestinal site of
affliction of CMV disease in immunocompetent patients
was the colon and rectum. Of note, characteristic CMV
inclusions were present mainly in stromal and endothelial cells, rather than in macrophages.
It should also be mentioned that a special population
afflicted by CMV disease consists of patients with pre-

Virology Journal 2008, 5:47 http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/47

existing inflammatory bowel disease. It is suggested that
cytokines like TNF-α and IFN-γ that are frequently elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, can
promote the reactivation of a latent CMV infection. This,
in turn, is known to cause additional cytokine release, particularly of IL-6, a fact that may lead to exacerbation of the
inflammatory bowel disease [14]. This sequence of events
may be observed even in patients with inflammatory
bowel disease not having recently received any steroid
treatment. It is noteworthy that CMV colitis in patients
with underlying inflammatory bowel disease has the
potential to cause severe complications, such as toxic
megacolon, colovesical fistula, perforation, and peritonitis.
The central nervous system (CNS) is not spared in CMV
infections observed in immunocompetent patients as
shown in our review. Our data are in concordance with
those of Devetag et al who proposed that two types of
CMV meningoencephalitis can be observed in immunocompetent patients: the paroxysmal type, which is characterized by focal neurological symptoms or signs,
alternating side of neurological deficits, headache, symptoms lasting from minutes to hours, and generally a
benign outcome, and, also, the monophasic type, which is
characterized by more frequent occurrence of seizures,
altered sensorium, symptoms lasting for days, and a less
benign course [6]. In addition, advanced age portends a
worse prognosis [6]. None of the patients in our review
died. Among the 37 patients that were previously
reviewed, 8 patients were treated with acyclovir and 1
died; 4 patients were treated with ganciclovir and 2 died;
3 patients were treated with vidarabine and survived and
22 patients did not receive any antiviral treatment and 4
of them died [6-8].
Thrombosis of the vascular system is another one of the
potential manifestations of CMV infection in patients
with normal immune responses. A variety of veins may be
afflicted as shown in the patients reported in this review
and in those previously reported by Squizzato et al. [2]
and Abgueguen et al. [4]. No comprehensive interpretation of this association is yet available, but data strongly
support a causal relationship, owed to the CMV intrinsic
procoagulant properties. It appears that CMV directly
invades vascular endothelial cells, causing membrane
alterations that promote coagulation [2]. Another plausible explanation is that CMV infection can cause activation
of vascular cells and the expression by the latter of adhesion molecules that react with platelets and leukocytes. In
addition, CMV infection may be associated with overexpression of the platelet-derived growth factor, and of
the transforming growth factor-β, which in turn causes
vascular cell wall proliferation [15]. Finally, one of the
immediate-early gene products of CMV, namely IE84,
binds to p53 and inhibits its transcriptional activity, thus
inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis, and enhancing vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [4].
It is suggested that the suppression of haematopoiesis that
is associated with CMV infection may be due to direct
inhibition by the virus of progenitor haematopoietic cell
growth, as well as to stromal cell dysfunction, or to effects
of inhibitory cytokines produced by CMV infected leukocytes. Furthermore, the detection of specific antibodies
[16], and of other immunological abnormalities [17], in
CMV-infected patients with haemolysis or myelodysplasia
indicates a probable immune-mediated mechanism
responsible for these manifestations.
Ocular CMV disease in immunocompromised individuals
is known to involve more often the retina. Yet, as observed
in our review, in apparently immunocompetent individuals, the retina and the anterior uvea are evenly affected.
The higher rate of confinement of CMV infection in the
anterior segment observed in the immunocompetent
patients compared to immunocompromised ones may be
attributed to the more effective immune response in the
former group [18]. Still, anterior uveitis has been associated with long-term sequelae in some of the immunocompetent patients, such as iris atrophy and glaucoma.
The development of these complications can be attributed
to chronic irreversible trabecular alterations in patients
having low-grade ocular inflammation for many years
before the specific diagnosis of CMV infection was confirmed and antiviral treatment initiated. Of note, the
introduction of anti-CMV therapy controlled secondary
glaucoma in some of these patients [19].
The data identified in this review regarding the need for
specific antiviral treatment in immunocompetent patients
with severe CMV infection, are rather conflicting. No
definitive conclusions can be drawn about the potential
benefit of antiviral therapy for severe CMV disease based
on these uncontrolled reports. The improvement
observed in some of the treated patients may have been
related to the typically self-limiting course of the disease,
and thus cannot be attributed with certainty to a treatment effect. To evaluate the potential role of specific antiviral treatment for immunocompetent patients with
severe CMV disease, randomized controlled trials are
deemed necessary.
It should also be noted that any presumed benefit of specific antiviral treatment in severe cases of CMV infection,
regarding immunocompetent patients, should be
weighed against the potential toxicity of therapy. While
adverse-effects associated with the administration of antiviral treatment against CMV were not reported in the
reviewed cases, one should be aware that ganciclovir can

cause myelosuppression, central nervous system disorders, hepatotoxicity, irreversible infertility (inhibition of
spermatogenesis), or teratogenesis, whereas foscarnet can
cause disturbances in mineral and electrolyte homeostasis, as well as nephrotoxicity. Additionally, long-term
administration of these agents may lead to the emergence
of resistant viral strains.
Conclusion
In summary, severe life-threatening complications of
CMV infection in immunocompetent patients may not be
as rare as previously thought. No conclusive statements
regarding the use of antiviral treatment can be made from
the available data in the literature. However, as it is evident from this review, physicians generally tend to prescribe antiviral treatment for the most severe cases of
monophasic CMV meningoencephalitis, as well as for
patients with severe ocular involvement, and severe lung
involvement, caused by the CMV infection. Randomized
controlled trials are needed for a more conclusive answer
on whether the use of antiviral treatment is indicated for
immunocompetent patients suffering form severe CMV
infection.
