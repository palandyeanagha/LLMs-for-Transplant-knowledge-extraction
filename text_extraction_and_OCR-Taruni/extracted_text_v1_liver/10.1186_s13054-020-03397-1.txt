Abstract
Background: Efective antimicrobial treatment is key to reduce mortality associated with bacterial sepsis in patients 
on intensive care units (ICUs). Dose adjustments are often necessary to account for pathophysiological changes or 
renal replacement therapy. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly being used for the treatment of respiratory and/or cardiac failure. However, it remains unclear whether dose adjustments are necessary to 
avoid subtherapeutic drug levels in septic patients on ECMO support. Here, we aimed to evaluate and comparatively 
assess serum concentrations of continuously applied antibiotics in intensive care patients being treated with and 
without ECMO.
Methods: Between October 2018 and December 2019, we prospectively enrolled patients on a pneumological 
ICU in southwest Germany who received antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, meropenem, or linezolid. All antibiotics were applied using continuous infusion, and therapeutic drug monitoring of serum 
concentrations (expressed as mg/L) was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography. Target concentrations were defned as fourfold above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of susceptible bacterial isolates, 
according to EUCAST breakpoints.

Introduction
Sepsis and septic shock due to pneumonia and infections at other body sites are major life-threatening 
events, which are frequent causes of admission to 
intensive care units (ICUs) for specifc treatment. Rapid 
initiation of an empirical antimicrobial therapy against 
the most likely pathogens is key to reduce morbidity 
and mortality in these patients, as delayed treatment 
was repeatedly demonstrated to be associated with 
increased mortality [1–3]. Te mortality can be further 
reduced if the antibiotic treatment regimen is adjusted 
once the causative agent has been identifed (targeted 
treatment) [4, 5].
Due to increasing rates of multiresistant pathogens and 
the lack of new antimicrobial agents, pharmacokinetic 
(PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of existing antibiotics have been investigated in more detail, 
and diferential dosing schemes were investigated. For 
antibiotics with time-dependent clinical activity, such as 
beta-lactams, both prolonged infusion (>4  h per dose) 
and continuous administration have been proposed to 
improve treatment efcacy. PK/PD studies suggest for 
beta-lactam antibiotics that serum concentrations at 
about 4–6 times above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC, expressed in mg/L) of the causative bacterium are desirable, and these should be maintained for a 
duration of>60% of the dosing interval [6, 7]. In 2014, the 
landmark ‘Defning antibiotic levels in intensive care unit 
patients’ (DALI) trial demonstrated that serum concentration goals were reached more often when continuous 
application was performed [8]. Two years later, the ‘Betalactam infusion in severe sepsis’ (BLISS) study showed a 
survival beneft when piperacillin and meropenem were 
applied continuously in patients with septic shock [9]. 
Insights gained from recent meta-analyses confrmed 
positive efects of continuous application of these antibiotics, although a mortality beneft was not consistently 
seen [10, 11].
Continuous application of anti-infective drugs, however, also carries the risk of constant underdosing if 
the actual serum concentration of the antibiotic is not 
measured regularly [8]. Scientific guidelines for pneumonia, sepsis and septic shock, including those of the 
Surviving Sepsis Campaign [12, 13], thus recommend 
to employ therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), i.e. a 
method to determine antibiotic serum concentrations, 
if continuous application of antibiotics is used. Indeed, 
many standard dosing regimens were developed based 
on data from healthy, normal-weight, mostly male 
individuals, and are thus not representative for most 
ICU patients [2, 4, 14]. Patients with severe infectious 
diseases on ICUs frequently have different PK/PD 
characteristics due to capillary leak, altered volume of 
distribution or renal and hepatic insufficiency [7, 15, 
16].
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is 
increasingly being used as a rescue therapy for severe 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe 
circulatory failure [17, 18]. Tus far, there are only limited data as to whether ECMO treatment afects PK/
PD parameters of ICU patients signifcantly. Preliminary evidence suggests that ECMO support seems to 
alter antibiotic serum concentrations, but standard 
dosing schemes might be sufcient [19, 20]. However, 
subtherapeutic as well as signifcantly elevated, side 
efect-causing serum concentrations of antimicrobial 
agents have also been reported [21]. Of note, dosing 
of the oxazolidinone linezolid seems to be particularly 
challenging in the ECMO setting [22]. Tus far, little 
evidence-based guidance exists as to whether specifc 
dosing recommendations should be employed in critically ill patients on ECMO support to counterbalance 
PK alterations caused by the underlying illness or by 
drug sequestration in the ECMO circuit [23].
Results: The fnal cohort comprised 105 ICU patients, of whom 30 were treated with ECMO. ECMO patients were 
signifcantly younger (mean age: 47.7 vs. 61.2 years; p<0.001), required renal replacement therapy more frequently 
(53.3% vs. 32.0%; p=0.048) and had an elevated ICU mortality (60.0% vs. 22.7%; p<0.001). Data on antibiotic serum 
concentrations derived from 112 measurements among ECMO and 186 measurements from non-ECMO patients 
showed signifcantly lower median serum concentrations for piperacillin (32.3 vs. 52.9; p=0.029) and standard-dose 
meropenem (15.0 vs. 17.8; p=0.020) in the ECMO group. We found high rates of insufcient antibiotic serum concentrations below the pre-specifed MIC target among ECMO patients (piperacillin: 48% vs. 13% in non-ECMO; linezolid: 
35% vs. 15% in non-ECMO), whereas no such diference was observed for ceftazidime and meropenem.
Conclusions: ECMO treatment was associated with signifcantly reduced serum concentrations of specifc antibiotics. Future studies are needed to assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of antibiotics in ICU patients on ECMO 
support.

Objectives
We performed a prospective, comparative clinical study 
to evaluate and assess the median serum concentrations of continuously applied antibiotics in intensive 
care patients being treated with and without ECMO in 
one University Medical Center in southwest Germany.
Methods
Study design and location
Te study was performed as a single-center, prospective, observational study between October 2018 and 
December 2019. Consecutive patients treated for 
severe infections with and without ECMO support 
were recruited on the pneumological ICU of the Saarland University Medical Center in Homburg, southwest 
Germany. Serum concentrations achieved by continuous application of the following antibiotics were analysed in the study population: piperacillin, ceftazidime, 
meropenem, and linezolid. Epidemiological and clinical 
characteristics of study participants were documented 
in a case report form (CRF), and we assessed median 
antibiotic serum concentrations and compared these 
among patients with and without ECMO.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All patients aged ≥ 18  years who were treated for an 
acute and severe infectious disease with one of the 
aforementioned antibiotics on the ICU of our hospital 
during the study period were eligible to be included. 
Severe infection was defned as an individual with a 
sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 at 
admission to the intensive care unit or an increase in 
the SOFA score of ≥ 2 in 24  h. Exclusion criteria were 
an age < 18 years, pregnancy, and/or absence of written 
informed consent.
Fluid management
A prespecifed hemodynamic protocol to standardise the approach to hemodynamically unstable patients 
was used. Part of the protocol included the prediction 
of fuid responsiveness and the restriction of deliberate fuid administration in ARDS patients. Generally, a 
fuid challenge of approx. 5  mL/kg body weight administered as boli of 50 mL volume was given to reach prespecifed aims, one being the increase of venous return 
to increase cardiac output. Mean arterial pressure target is 60–65  mmHg, if physiologic aims are reached. 
Tese include, e.g. capillary refll time (i.e. warm periphery), urinary output (≥0.5  mL/kg/h) or lactate levels (≤2.0  mmol/L). Te need for fuid treatment was 
determined clinically and on an individual patient basis 
as judged by a staf intensivist.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) 
and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
Depending on the clinical indication, patients were either 
treated with venovenous (vv)ECMO or venoarterial (va)
ECMO. Common indications were ARDS, circulatory 
failure or bridge to lung transplant. Te Cardiohelp System (Maquet Cardiopulmonary GmbH; Rastatt, Germany) was used in all patients, combined with either 
Deltastream HC (XENIOS AG; Heilbronn, Germany) 
or HICO-Aquatherm 660 (NUFER-MEDICAL; Bern, 
Switzerland) as thermoregulatory devices. Te oxygenator and tubing used was the HLS Set Advanced 7.0 with 
Bioline Coating (Maquet Cardiopulmonary GmbH; Rastatt, Germany). Oxygenator membranes were allowed to 
be used for up to 30 days and blood fow could reach up 
to 7  l per minute. For the oxygenator membrane, polymethylpenten with a surface area of 1.8 m2
 and a heatchanging surface area of 0.4 m2
 was used. In patients 
requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), 
citrate continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) 
was used throughout the study with a Fresenius mutiFiltrate machine and an Ultrafux1000s flter (Fresenius 
SE&Co; Bad Homburg, Germany). To estimate fow rates 
of ECMO and CRRT for statistical analysis, we calculated 
the mean fow in the 24 h preceding the antibiotic serum 
concentration determination.
Antibiotic treatment modalities
Te empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated by the 
responsible ICU clinician following thorough clinical 
assessment, and microbiology testing results guided 
targeted treatment adjustments. All cases were discussed once weekly in an interdisciplinary infectious 
disease round among intensivists, clinical microbiologists and clinical pharmacists. All patients received a 
loading dose of the selected antibiotic, followed by 
continuous application. Dosing schemes and serum 
target concentrations followed previously published 
recommendations, with slight modifcations [14]. For 
beta-lactam antibiotics, we defned the target serum 
concentrations as being four times above the susceptibility breakpoint for Enterobacterales, adhering to the 
clinical breakpoints recommended by the European 
Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing 
(EUCAST) in the 2019 version, as follows: (i) ceftazidime, resistant > 4  mg/L → target serum concentration: ≥ 16  mg/L; (ii) piperacillin/tazobactam, sensitive 
if ≤ 8  mg/L → target serum concentration: > 32  mg/L; 
and (iii) meropenem, sensitive if ≤ 2  mg/L → target serum concentration: > 8  mg/L. Of note, we 

Kühn et al. Crit Care (2020) 24:664 Page 4 of 11
employed these target concentrations for Enterobacterales and non-fermentative bacteria. To avoid toxicity, the linezolid target concentration was in the range 
6.5–12  mg/L, thus 1.6–3 times above the EUCAST 
breakpoint at 4.0 mg/L.
Therapeutic drug monitoring of selected antibiotics
Blood samples for TDM were taken twice a week (every 
Monday and Tursday) as part of the daily routine blood 
sampling in patients who received antimicrobial agents 
using continuous infusion. In all patients, the frst TDM 
measurements were taken≥24  h after treatment initiation with continuously applied antibiotics. All specimens 
were immediately sent via a pneumatic tube system to 
the local hospital laboratory for further processing. Upon 
receipt, samples were instantly centrifuged and the serum 
was frozen at−80  °C. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay (Chromsystems Instruments 
& Chemicals GmbH, Gräfelfng, Germany) was performed to quantify serum antibiotic concentrations on 
an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies Germany GmbH & Co. KG, Waldbronn, Germany). 
Te laboratory participated regularly in internal and 
external quality assessment activities. When necessary, 
antibiotic dose adaptations were performed, adhering 
to a locally developed standardised operating procedure 
(SOP). While follow-up TDM measurements were performed in such patients undergoing dose adjustments, 
we excluded them from this analysis, as it was our goal to 
assess the efect of standard-dose application (adjusted to 
renal function, if necessary) on ECMO and non-ECMO 
intensive care patients. Target attainment was defned as 
an antibiotic serum concentration above or equal to the 
aforementioned clinical breakpoints for the respective 
bacterial pathogens. TDM target attainment was determined for each measurement.
Clinical microbiology procedures
Microbiological sampling was carried out by the treating clinicians, and samples were immediately processed 
in the local microbiology laboratory, which employed 
standard agar plate cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Pathogen identifcation was carried 
out using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization 
time-of-fight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker 
Daltonics; Bremen, Germany). Blood cultures were incubated in a BACTEX FX (Becton Dickinson; Heidelberg, 
Germany) instrument, and antimicrobial susceptibility 
testing was performed on a VITEK2 (BioMérieux; Marcy 
L’Étoile, France) and by Etest methods, using EUCAST 
breakpoints.
Statistical analysis
We comparatively analysed data for ECMO and nonECMO patients, and we used SPSS 25.0 (IBM; Amonk, 
USA) for statistical analysis. For all continuous variables, either the mean value with standard deviation or 
the median with interquartile ranges were calculated, as 
appropriate. Discrete variables were expressed as absolute numbers and percentage. A two-sided p value≤0.05 
was considered as statistically signifcant. To assess differences between the study groups, we used Chi-square 
test or Mann–Whitney-U test, as appropriate, or t-test 
for two independent samples. To assess the infuence of 
ECMO, renal function, absence or presence of CRRT, 
organ failure scores and body mass index (BMI) on serum 
concentrations, we performed multiple linear generalized 
estimating equation (GEE) analyses. GEE analyses ofer 
an option for longitudinal analyses in diferent settings, 
including repeated measure laboratory experiments [24].
Results
Patient characteristics
Between 1 October 2018 and 31 December 2019, we 
prospectively enrolled 105 consecutive patients on one 
pneumological ICU, of whom 30 individuals (28.6%) were 
treated with ECMO support. Te mean age in the ECMO 
group was 47.7±13.1  years vs. 61.2±12.3  years in the 
non-ECMO group (p<0.001). Tere were no signifcant diferences for sex, weight, height, body mass index 
(BMI) and SOFA score at ICU admission between both 
groups. Patients on ECMO support required CRRT more 
frequently (53.3% vs. 32.0%, p=0.048) and had a signifcantly elevated ICU mortality (60.0% vs. 22.7%, p<0.001). 
Detailed characteristics of the study population are displayed in Table 1.
Antibiotic serum concentrations in patients 
with and without ECMO support
We analysed 112 antibiotic serum concentration measurements from ECMO and 186 samples from nonECMO patients, and found signifcantly lower median 
serum concentrations for piperacillin (32.3 vs. 52.9; 
p=0.029) and standard-dose meropenem (15.0 vs. 17.8; 
p=0.020) in the ECMO group. No signifcant diferences 
were observed for ceftazidime, high-dose meropenem 
(6  g/d) and linezolid (Table  2). Te pre-specifed target 
serum concentrations were not reached for piperacillin and linezolid in 48% and 35%, respectively, of ECMO 
patients, while this rate was≤15% for both antibiotics in 
the non-ECMO group (Fig.  1). Using a multiple linear 
GEE approach to assess the infuence of diferent clinical 
factors on antibiotic serum concentrations while adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and renal function, 

Kühn et al. Crit Care (2020) 24:664 Page 5 of 11
we found a statistically signifcant correlation between 
ECMO and reduced serum concentrations for piperacillin and standard-dose meropenem. Tere was no correlation between the blood fow rate on ECMO and 
decreased antibiotic serum concentrations. Furthermore, 
the duration of ECMO membrane oxygenator use was 
associated with an increase in serum concentration of 
most antibiotics. In contrast to ECMO treatment, CRRT 
was associated with elevated antibiotic serum concentrations of piperacillin and standard-dose meropenem 
(Table 3).
Clinical microbiology fndings
A total of 89 potential bacterial pathogens were detected 
in clinical specimens of 43 patients (17 ECMO patients 
and 26 non-ECMO patients). Most bacteria were 
detected in respiratory specimens (50/89, 56.2%), followed by bloodstream infections (26/89, 29.2%) and 
other foci such as urinary tract or soft tissue infection 
(13/89, 14.6%). Te majority of detected pathogens were 
Gram-negative bacteria (64/89, 71.9%), with Escherichia 
coli (n=22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=13), Klebsiella 
pneumoniae (n=9) and Enterobacter cloacae complex 
(n=7) being most frequently detected. Staphylococcus aureus was the only relevant Gram-positive bacterium recovered from respiratory specimens, whereas 
coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci were 
mainly detected in blood cultures. Most pathogens 
were susceptible to the investigated antibiotics, with 
median MICs below the respective EUCAST breakpoints 
(Table 4).
Discussion
Te aim of this study was to investigate whether continuous administration of beta-lactam antibiotics and 
linezolid achieves sufcient serum concentrations in 
critically ill patients on ECMO support. We found that (i) 
serum concentrations of piperacillin and standard-dose 
meropenem were signifcantly lower in ECMO patients 
than in non-ECMO patients; and (ii) a considerable 
amount of ECMO patients treated with piperacillin (48%) 
and linezolid (35%) did not reach the pre-specifed MIC 
targets. To our knowledge, this is the largest TDM study 
performed on ECMO patients.
Optimal pharmacotherapy is challenging in critically 
ill patients whose complex pathophysiological alterations signifcantly impact on PK/PD characteristics. As 
antibiotics constitute the decisive causal treatment in 
severe infections, several large studies were performed 
to assess the efects of a continuous infusion of betalactams. Two randomized trials [8, 9] elucidated that 
continuous infusion of meropenem and piperacillin 
were more likely to reach serum concentration goals 
in critically ill patients than intermittent infusion, and 
showed that continuous application was associated 
with a better clinical outcome [25]. Many of these studies recommended a high beta-lactam exposure well

above the actual MIC of potential pathogens to account 
for pathophysiological modifcations and the increased 
risk of multiresistant pathogens on ICUs. For piperacillin/tazobactam, our study confrms previous research 
that a total daily dose of 13.5  g frequently does not 
achieve sufcient serum concentrations [26]. However, 
this dosing regimen (divided in three or four applications per day, or administered as continuous infusion) 
is still the most widely used on a global scale, and is 
also endorsed by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign [13],

be inappropriate. Results from the ongoing multicentric

and further substantiate our understanding of the optimal dosing strategy for this drug.
Data pertaining to the continuous application of antibiotics in ECMO patients are scarce, and no specifc 
dosing recommendations have formally been established. A recently published meta-analysis on this topic 
concluded that the impact of ECMO support on nonlipophilic drugs seems to be negligible [25], which contrasts with our study fndings of a signifcant impact on 
serum concentrations of piperacillin and meropenem. A 
TDM study conducted by Donadello et al. on 26 ECMO 
patients and 41 matched controls did not fnd signifcant 
diferences for piperacillin and meropenem serum concentrations between ECMO and non-ECMO patients 
when intermittent infusion was used. Yet, they reported 
that>60% in both patient groups did not reach adequate 
target concentrations (4–6 times higher than the respective MIC breakpoint). Hanberg and colleagues investigated in another TDM study the efects of intermittent 
infusion of meropenem on ECMO patients, and showed 
that a standard dosing regimen (1 g i.v. every 8 h) did not 
achieve serum concentrations above the MIC of Gramnegative pathogens for the entire dosing interval. Hence, 
they concluded that alternative dosing strategies might 
be needed for critically ill ECMO patients with higher 
odds of multiresistant pathogens. In our study, we found 
no insufcient target concentrations (i.e.,<8 mg/L) when 
a higher dose of meropenem (6 g/d) was used.
To our knowledge, our study is the frst to perform 
TDM of continuously applied ceftazidime in ECMO 
patients. We did not observe a single insufcient serum 
concentration (<32  mg/L), which suggests that ceftazidime can safely be used in such patients. Data regarding linezolid in ECMO patients are limited. A case series 
from Italy used intermittent infusion of 600 mg of linezolid every 12 h in three ECMO patients, which did not 
achieve clinically efective serum concentrations [28]. 
Indeed, linezolid dosing on ECMO is challenging [29], 
and our fndings underscore these observations, because 
we used a higher dose of 1800 mg/d of linezolid for continuous infusion, but still did not reach desirable target 
serum concentrations in 35% of ECMO patients.
Even though the design of our study does not allow to 
infer a causal relationship between antibiotic serum concentrations and ECMO, the fndings suggest that ECMO 
support is associated with decreased serum concentrations of piperacillin and standard-dose meropenem. A 
possible reason for this observation might be sequestration in the ECMO circuit with its large surface. Tis has 
been shown for lipophilic and highly protein-bound antibiotics in an ex vivo study and in an in vivo ovine model 
[30, 31]. Additionally, we found a correlation between 
increased serums levels of ceftazidime, meropenem and 
linezolid with a prolonged use of the same ECMO membrane oxygenator. Capillary leak, considerable fuid shifts 
and the increased volume of distribution in critically ill 
patients might further contribute to altered serum concentrations of antibiotics. Indeed, ECMO patients are 
frequently in need of additional fuids to maintain suffcient preload to the extracorporeal system, and commonly have a positive fuid balance [32]. We use a 
restrictive fuid protocol, yet, it is beyond the scope of 
this observational study to unambiguously assign the 
cause for specifc antibiotic serum concentrations to 
patient-specifc characteristics or ECMO modalities. Of 
note, most of the ECMO patients in this cohort were 
treated with vvECMO for severe ARDS, and half of them 
required CRRT, which is in line with observations from 
previous studies [33]. However, our statistical analysis 
using multiple linear GEE analyses did not provide evidence that the considerable amount of piperacillin or linezolid serum concentrations not reaching the MIC target 
might have been attributable to CRRT, thus warranting 
further research on the role of TDM in ECMO settings, 
with particular emphasis on potential drug sequestration 
in the ECMO circuit [23].
Several limitations of our study are ofered for consideration. First, our assessment was monocentric 
and causal relationships cannot be inferred. Second, 
even though the study comprised the largest number 
of patients in a TDM study of ECMO patients thus 
far, the overall number is still relatively small. Tird, 
while we considered both renal function and CRRT 
including specifc parameters such as fow rates (e.g. 
for ultrafltration), we did not quantify the degrees 
of e.g. hepatic insufciency to further characterise 
potential drug clearance efects, thereby acknowledging that, as in many clinical ICU studies, the profound 
pathophysiological alterations in critically ill patients 
cannot be accounted for comprehensively. Previous 
studies revealed the difculties to assign PK alterations 
to either ECMO or CRRT in patients requiring both 
treatment modalities [19], and further studies aiming at 
larger patient cohorts are desirable. Fourth, we measured total antibiotic drug serum concentrations instead 
of free, unbound drug fractions. Hence, as the proteinbound fraction of antibiotics is not clinically active, 
some of the measured serum concentrations might 
overestimate the actual amount of efective antibiotic 
substance in the bloodstream. For example, the proteinbound fraction of piperacillin is estimated at 20–30% of 
the total serum concentration in intensive care patients 
[34], and hence, the ‘true’ risk of piperacillin/tazobactam underdosing might be even higher than reported 
in our study. Indeed, if accounting for a protein-bound 
fraction of 20% for piperacillin, the resulting serum 

Kühn et al. Crit Care (2020) 24:664 Page 10 of 11
concentrations would have been insufcient in 22.2% 
of non-ECMO patients and 54.8% of ECMO patients. 
If considering a protein-bound fraction of 30%, the 
rates of subtherapeutic serum concentrations would 
have been even higher (27.8% in non-ECMO patients 
vs. 64.5% in ECMO patients). Fifth, it remains to be 
elucidated whether the employed antibiotics might 
indeed have been clinically efective in some cases with 
serum concentrations below the pre-specifed target, as 
the measured pathogen MICs were in most cases well 
below the respective EUCAST breakpoints (Table 4).
Conclusions
Our observations suggest that continuous application of beta-lactams and linezolid can be successfully 
employed in ECMO patients. However, TDM is necessary and should regularly be carried out when piperacillin, standard-dose meropenem and linezolid are 
administered. Further studies are warranted to assess 
diferent dosing regimens for anti-infective drugs in 
patients on ECMO support, and these should prospectively compare continuous versus intermittent application of selected antibiotics.
