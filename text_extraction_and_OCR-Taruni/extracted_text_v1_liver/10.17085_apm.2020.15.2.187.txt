Background: Although systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve anterior leaflet is 
well-known to cause hemodynamic perturbation in many anesthetic situations, the prevalence and clinical implication of SAM of mitral chordae tendineae (chordal SAM) in liver 
transplantation (LT) has not been evaluated. We aimed to assess the impact of chordal SAM 
on intraoperative postreperfusion syndrome and short and long-term all-cause mortality. 
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 1751 LT recipients from January 2011 to June 2017 
who had preoperative echocardiography. Echocardiography-derived parameters and the 
prevalence of post-reperfusion syndrome between those with chordal SAM and without 
chordal SAM were compared. The cumulative mortality rate according to the presence of 
chordal SAM was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. 
Results: Of the enrolled recipients, 21 (1.2%) had chordal SAM in preoperative echocardiography. Compared to those without chordal SAM, patients with chordal SAM had a smaller 
end-systolic volume index (median 18 ml/m2 vs. 22 ml/m2, P = 0.015) and end-diastolic 
volume index (median 52 ml/m2 vs. 63 ml/m2, P = 0.011). However, there was no difference in systolic and diastolic function in echocardiography. The prevalence of intraoperative 
post-reperfusion syndrome did not show any difference (42.9% vs. 45.3%, P = 1.000). Over 
the mean 4.8-year follow-up, cumulative 90-day and overall mortality also did not show a 
difference (Log rank P > 0.05, both). 
Conclusions: Preoperative screening of echocardiography in LT recipients detects 1.2% of 
chordal SAM. It is found with small left ventricular volume, but is not related with intraoperative post-reperfusion syndrome and short- and long-term postoperative all-cause mortality in 
LT.

INTRODUCTION 
Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral chordae 
tendineae (chordal SAM) is commonly observed with septal hypertrophy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) 
and may cause severe hypotension by obstructing the left 
ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) during the systole phase. 
However, various patterns of SAM are known to occur even 
in cases other than HCM [1]. This disease has drawn the 
attention of anesthesiologists due to the fact that SAM 
causes an obstruction of the LVOT during anesthesia and 
induces severe hemodynamic instability that may be

low-responsive to the conventional treatment [2]. 
In chordal SAM, the chordae tendineae moves anteriorly 
during the systolic phase and is known to be associated 
with mitral valve prolapse [3]. It is a rare endocardial 
change with a prevalence of 3.9% among patients with mitral valve prolapse and 1% among the normal population 
[3]. However, its hemodynamic impact during anesthesia 
or effects on postoperative clinical outcomes are unknown. 
We hypothesized that the incidence of chordal SAM might 
be higher among patients with end-stage liver disease who 
have hyperdynamic circulation compared to that among the 
general population. Moreover, we also hypothesized that patients with chordal SAM will be more vulnerable to postreperfusion syndrome because of increased hyperdynamic circulation due to a sudden drop in systemic vascular resistance 
during graft reperfusion and the use of cardiovascular drugs 
like epinephrine could induce a structural change of the 
heart. 
Therefore, this study aims to examine the prevalence of 
chordal SAM in echocardiography before liver transplantation (LT), characteristics of patients with chordal SAM, and 
the effects of chordal SAM on reperfusion syndrome during 
LT, postoperative mortality, and liver failure. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This observational study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Asan Medical Center (no. 2019-
0174), and patients with end-stage liver disease who underwent LT at our hospital between January 2011 and June 
2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients under the age 
of 18, patients undergoing a re-transplantation, patients 
who did not undergo echocardiography preoperatively, 
patients with chronic kidney disease, and patients with 
missing data were excluded. At our hospital, all LT patients 
undergo transthoracic echocardiography. In this study, we 
collected information about patients’ state, including 
transthoracic echocardiography results, and laboratory test 
results from electronic medical records and retrospectively 
analyzed them. Transthoracic echocardiography (Hewlett-Packard Sonos 2500 or 5500 imaging system, Hewlett-Packard Inc., USA) was performed by a skilled echocardiography technician using a 2.5 MHz transducer and the 
results were confirmed by an attending cardiologist. The 
incidence of reperfusion syndrome and the epinephrine 
dose during the reperfusion period was collected. The 90-
day mortality as well as overall mortality and graft failure 
during the entire period of observation were assessed. 
Postreperfusion syndrome was defined as a more than 30% 
drop of the mean arterial pressure from the baseline that 
persists for at least one minute during the first five minutes 
after reperfusion of the transplanted liver. Time until graft 
failure was defined as death after transplantation or 
re-transplantation, whichever came earlier. Information 
about the patient’s death was collected from our LT patient 
list and electronic medical records. The mean observation 
period was 4.8 ± 2.0 years, with a mean period of 4.3 ± 2.4 
years for patients with SAM and 4.8 ± 2.0 years for those 
without SAM. 
Statistical analysis 
Continuous variables were described as mean ± SD or 
median (1Q, 3Q), and categorical variables were described 
as the number of patients and percentage. Continuous 
variables were analyzed with the Shapiro Wilk normality 
test followed by the Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test, 
while categorical variables were analyzed with either the 
chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. The differences in 
mortality rates between the two groups were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test. The 
“moonBook” [4] and “survival” [5] R package were used for 
statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.3.1, R foundation for statistical Computing, 
Austria). A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS 
Of the LT patients between January 2011 and June 2017, 
a total of 1,751 patients was enrolled after the exclusion 
and 21 (1.2%) showed chordal SAM. The representative 
manifestation of chordal SAM is presented in Fig. 1 and 
Supplementary Video 1. Table 1 shows the patients’ demographics and cause of liver cirrhosis according to chordal 
SAM. There were no differences in the age, sex, Model for 
End-Stage Liver Disease score, and the prevalence of underlying diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus between the two groups. Table 2 shows the results of 
echocardiography between the two groups. 
There was no difference in the grade of mitral regurgitation (P = 0.815) or in left ventricular systolic and diastolic 
functions between the two groups (Table 2). However, regarding heart volume, patients with chordal SAM had a

smaller end-systolic volume index (median 18 [15, 25] ml/
m2 vs. 22 [19, 27] ml/m2, P = 0.015) and end-diastolic volume index (median 52 [42, 68] ml/m2
 vs. 63 [54, 74] ml/m2, 
P = 0.011) compared to that of patients without chordal 
SAM. 
Table 3 shows a comparison of intraoperative hemodynamic changes (presence of postreperfusion syndrome) 
and the epinephrine dose used as well as 90-day mortality, 
overall mortality, 90-day graft failure, and overall graft failure after LT. There were no differences in the incidence of 
intraoperative reperfusion syndrome (42.9% vs. 45.3%, P = 
1.000) and the epinephrine dose used (P = 0.925) between 
the two groups. Further, the two groups also did not differ 
in the 90-day mortality (4.8% vs. 2.6%, P = 1.000), overall 
mortality (9.5% vs. 10.6%, P = 1.000), 90-day graft failure 
(4.8% vs. 3.1%, P = 1.000), and overall graft failure (9.5% vs. 
12.3%, P = 0.964) (Fig. 2). There were also no differences in 
cumulative 90-day and overall mortality (Log-rank P for 
90-day mortality = 0.548; Log-rank P for overall mortality 
= 0.900) according to the presence of chordal SAM (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION 
The prevalence of chordal SAM discovered in the preoperative echocardiography was 1.2%, and patients who had 
chordal SAM did not significantly differ in the incidence of 
postreperfusion syndrome during LT from patients who 
did not have chordal SAM. Moreover, the two groups of patients did not significantly differ in the 90-day mortality 
and overall mortality during the observation period. 
End-stage liver disease is known to cause cardiac structural impairments and dysfunctions, such as tachycardia, systolic and/or diastolic functions, and/or electrophysiology, 
which is defined as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCMP) [6]. 
Structural changes of the heart generally involve left ventricular enlargement and hypertrophy and cardiac tissues show 
myocardial fibrosis and subendocardial edema. Further, the

increase of heart rate in response to beta receptor agonists, 
such as isoproterenol, is diminished in patients with liver 
cirrhosis, as seen in in rat models [7]. Although the systolic 
functions and cardiac output are generally normal or elevated during rest, patients with CCMP have been reported to 
show reduced cardiac systolic function during stress situations, such as exercise and bleeding [8–11]. Moreover, diastolic dysfunction frequently occurs, and particularly, preoperative diastolic disorder is closely related to increased 
postoperative mortality following LT [12]. 
In our study, a comparison of clinical features between patients with and without chordal SAM revealed that patients 
with chordal SAM had a smaller left ventricle (LV) dimension 
in systole (28 vs. 30, P = 0.048). Considering that LV dimension 
in systole is an indicator of cardiac systolic function, this result 
suggests that chordal SAM occurred in patients with a small 
heart (low end-diastolic volume index) with greater hyperdynamic circulation. However, the two groups did not significantly differ in other systolic indices, such as ejection fraction, 
therefore further research is needed regarding the relationship 
between chordal SAM and hyperdynamic circulation. Furthermore, additional studies are needed to identify the clinical implications of such differences. In addition, whereas previous 
studies reported that chordal SAM is more common among 
patients with mitral valve prolapse syndrome, no significant 
difference was found in our study. The reason behind this 
should also be studied on a larger study population [3]. 
SAM is a phenomenon in which the anterior motion of 
the anterior mitral leaflet causes an obstruction of the 
LVOT, and eventually, a severe cardiovascular collapse. Although SAM is commonly known to be induced by myocardial thickening and asymmetrical interventricular septal thickening, it can be caused by severe hypovolemia, use 
of dobutamine, and/or elevated catecholamine secretion 
caused by stress even in patients without anatomical defects, necessitating close attention. Particularly, LT can 
cause severe hypovolemia due to ligation of the inferior 
vena cava and massive bleeding during surgery. Therefore 
SAM can occur in patients with CCMP, ischemic heart disease, or hepatorenal syndrome who develop a postreperfusion syndrome because high doses of cardiovascular drugs 
are used in such cases. Therefore, it is standard protocol to 
suspect SAM as a cause of unexplained severe hypovolemia during LT, and numerous relevant case studies have 
been reported [13–15]. We hypothesized that chordal SAM, 
though not the typical SAM of the anterior mitral leaflet, 
may have some impact on reperfusion syndrome. However, our results showed no significant differences. Moreover, 
there were no significant differences in the postoperative 
90-day and long-term mortality after LT. 
One limitation of this study is that although we examined 
a relatively large number of LT patients, our specific study

motion of mitral valve. No difference was found between the patients. SAM: systolic anterior motion of mitral valve.

population was small, as chordal SAM is a rare disease. Subsequent studies should recruit a larger study population. 
Further, as this study is a retrospective analysis, we could not 
include the use of echocardiography upon the onset of postreperfusion syndrome. Even if the incidence of postreperfusion syndrome may not differ, the onset of SAM that causes 
hemodynamic changes can be observed, so subsequent 
studies should utilize echocardiography during LT. 
In conclusion, chordal SAM was found in 1.2% of patients before LT, and these patients had smaller cardiac 
systolic and diastolic volumes than those without chordal 
SAM. Unlike with the SAM of the anterior mitral leaflet, the 
incidence of intraoperative postreperfusion syndrome or 
postoperative 90-day and overall mortality did not significantly differ according to chordal SAM. Therefore, it seems 
safe for patients with chordal SAM to undergo LT, but more 
prospective studies with echocardiography data during 
postreperfusion period are needed.
