Abstract
Background: Whether goal-directed fluid therapy based on dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness (GDFTdyn)
alone improves clinical outcomes in comparison with standard fluid therapy among patients undergoing surgery
remains unclear.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant studies. Studies
comparing the effects of GDFTdyn with that of standard fluid therapy on clinical outcomes among adult patients
undergoing surgery were considered eligible. Two analyses were performed separately: GDFTdyn alone versus
standard fluid therapy and GDFTdyn with other optimization goals versus standard fluid therapy. The primary
outcomes were short-term mortality and overall morbidity, while the secondary outcomes were serum lactate
concentration, organ-specific morbidity, and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital.
Results: We included 37 studies with 2910 patients. Although GDFTdyn alone lowered serum lactate concentration
(mean difference (MD) − 0.21 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) (− 0.39, − 0.03), P = 0.02), no significant
difference was found between groups in short-term mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% CI (0.32, 2.24), P = 0.74),
overall morbidity (OR 1.03, 95% CI (0.31, 3.37), P = 0.97), organ-specific morbidity, or length of stay in the ICU and in
hospital. Analysis of trials involving the combination of GDFTdyn and other optimization goals (mainly cardiac
output (CO) or cardiac index (CIx)) showed a significant reduction in short-term mortality (OR 0.45, 95% CI (0.24, 0.85),
P = 0.01), overall morbidity (OR 0.41, 95% CI (0.28, 0.58), P < 0.00001), serum lactate concentration (MD − 0.60 mmol/L,
95% CI (− 1.04, − 0.15), P = 0.009), cardiopulmonary complications (cardiac arrhythmia (OR 0.58, 95% CI (0.37, 0.92),
P = 0.02), myocardial infarction (OR 0.35, 95% CI (0.16, 0.76), P = 0.008), heart failure/cardiovascular dysfunction
(OR 0.31, 95% CI (0.14, 0.67), P = 0.003), acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 0.13, 95% CI (0.02, 0.74),
P = 0.02), pneumonia (OR 0.4, 95% CI (0.24, 0.65), P = 0.0002)), length of stay in the ICU (MD − 0.77 days, 95% CI
(− 1.07, − 0.46), P < 0.00001) and in hospital (MD − 1.18 days, 95% CI (− 1.90, − 0.46), P = 0.001).
Conclusions: It was not the optimization of fluid responsiveness by GDFTdyn alone but rather the optimization of
tissue and organ perfusion by GDFTdyn and other optimization goals that benefited patients undergoing surgery.
Patients managed with the combination of GDFTdyn and CO/CI goals might derive most benefit.

Background
Inappropriate fluid administration in the intraoperative
period is associated with a risk of hypovolemia or overload. It then causes tissue hypoxia and postoperative
organ dysfunction. The postoperative complications have
a huge impact on short-term and long-term mortality.
The occurrence of these complications could reduce median survival by 69% [1]. Moreover, the increased morbidity and mortality is associated with a high healthcare
cost [2]. Correcting tissue hypoxia is a crucial step to
improve the prognosis of patients undergoing surgery.
Occult tissue hypoxia still occurs despite the
normalization of standard physiologic variables, such as
heart rate, blood pressure, central venous pressure (CVP)
and urine output [3, 4]. Goal-directed fluid therapy based
on dynamic variables (GDFTdyn) is defined as a spectrum
of fluid management strategies reaching optimal preload
by monitoring variables derived from cardiorespiratory
interaction. These variables include stroke volume variation (SVV), systolic pressure variation (SPV), pulse pressure variation (PPV) and pleth variability index (PVI).
They have emerged to target tissue perfusion in recent
years. They are believed to be the markers of positions on
the Frank-Starling curve, which are proportional to the
degree of preload dependency. Compared with stroke volume optimization requiring quantification of the percentage change in stroke volume or oxygen delivery
optimization requiring frequent calculations of oxygen delivery related variables, GDFTdyn is perceived to be more
direct and less time-consuming. It is thought to be more
convenient for healthcare providers to know whether a
patient is a fluid responder or not. Moreover, as arterial
cannulation and pulse oximeter are routinely used in
moderate to high-risk patients undergoing surgery, these
dynamic variables are easy to obtain and well-tolerated by
patients. These advantages of GDFTdyn make it possible
to be widely used in clinical practice.
Numerous clinical trials and systematic reviews have
evaluated the efficacy and safety of GDFTdyn in patients
undergoing surgery [5–9]. However, most of these clinical
trials are of small sample size and the results of them
contradict each other. On the other hand, there may be significant heterogeneity and methodological flaws in the previous meta-analyses. Especially, existing meta-analyses have
failed to account for nonuniform application of other combined optimization goals in the GDFTdyn arms. These
combined optimization goals are variables not derived from
cardiorespiratory interaction, such as variables of flow, cardiac output (CO) or cardiac index (CIx). They might serve
to confound the final results. As a result, whether
GDFTdyn alone improves clinical outcomes among patients undergoing surgery or not remains uncertain.
Therefore, we performed the meta-analysis to determine the effects of GDFTdyn in comparison with
standard fluid therapy on clinical outcomes among adult
patients undergoing surgery. Especially, we compared
GDFTdyn alone and GDFTdyn with other optimization
goals separately to better address the question.
Methods
The meta-analysis was conducted following the recommendations of Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [10], and reported following Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines [11] (see Additional file 1). The protocol of the
study has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018106439).
Literature search
A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane
Library and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed independently by two authors (QWD and WCT) to identify relevant studies in any language published from inception to
1 September 2018. Electronic search keywords were goal
directed (goal targeted, goal oriented), and fluid management (fluid optimization, fluid therapy), surgery (operation, intraoperative, perioperative). Additional studies
were identified by reviewing the reference lists of previous
systematic reviews. The search strategy used in PubMed
was as follow: (1) “goal directed”; (2) “goal targeted”; (3)
“goal oriented”; (4) 1 or 2 or 3; (5) fluid; (6) hemodynamic;
(7) haemodynamic; (8) 5 or 6 or 7; (9) management; (10)
optimization; (11) therapy; (12) 9 or 10 or 11; (13) 8 and
12; (14) surg*; (15) operat*; (16) intraoperative*; (17) perioperative*; (18) 14 or 15 or 16 or 17; (19) 4 and 13 and 18.
Study selection
After excluding studies based on title and abstract screening,
two authors (QWD and BCZ) independently reviewed the
full texts of the remaining studies. Consensus was resolved
by the third author (WCT) when disagreement occurred.
Studies were considered eligible if they met the following
inclusion criteria.
Type of participants
Adult patients (> 18 years old) undergoing surgery were
included as participants. The patients were defined as high
risk when they fulfilled at least one of the patient-related
or surgery-related criteria. The patient-related criteria
were age >60 years or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ 3 due to any reason. The
surgery-related criteria were high-risk surgeries defined by
original studies and by European Society of Cardiology/
European Society of Anesthesiology (ESC/ESA) guidelines
[12], including emergency surgery, cardiac surgery, major
vascular surgery, major abdominal surgery, or surgeries
with presumed blood loss >20% of blood volume.
Deng et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:298 Page 2 of 17

Type of intervention
The intervention was defined as GDFT based on dynamic
variables derived from cardiorespiratory interaction, including SVV, SPV, PPV and PVI. Variables not derived from
cardiorespiratory interaction were considered as other
optimization goals, such as CO, CI, and oxygen delivery.
Type of comparison
Comparison of the effects of GDFTdyn with those of
standard fluid management was considered. Standard fluid
management was defined as fluid management based on
standard physiologic variables, such as heart rate, blood
pressure, central venous pressure (CVP) or urine output.
Type of outcome measures
The primary outcomes were short-term mortality and
overall morbidity. Short-term mortality was defined as
30-day or hospital mortality. Overall morbidity was defined as the proportion of patients with one or more postoperative complications. The secondary outcomes were
serum lactate concentration at the end of surgery,
organ-specific morbidity (neurological, cardiovascular,
pulmonary, abdominal and renal complications), and
length of stay in the ICU and in hospital. The
organ-specific morbidity was defined as the proportion of
patients with an organ-specific complication. These complications included neurological (stroke), cardiovascular
(arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure/cardiovascular dysfunction), pulmonary (acute lung injury/acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), pneumonia,
pulmonary embolism), abdominal (gastrointestinal (GIT)
bleeding, GIT obstruction) and renal (acute kidney injury
(AKI), renal failure with dialysis) complications.
Studies were excluded if they did not report any of
these clinical outcomes.
Data extraction
Data were independently extracted to a predesigned form by
two authors (SHW and JTS). The following variables were
collected: first author, year of publication, study design, patient demographics (age, sample size, ASA class, high or
moderate risk), surgical variables (surgical procedure, duration of surgery, estimated blood loss), intraoperative fluid
administration (GDFTdyn, other optimization goals, monitoring devices, fluid management), and outcomes (short-term
mortality, overall morbidity, serum lactate concentration at
the end of surgery, postoperative organ-specific complications, length of stay in ICU and hospital).
Quality assessment
The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of
bias was applied. It focuses upon selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias.
Statistical analysis
We performed two separate analyses by pooling data
from RCTs comparing GDFTdyn alone or GDFTdyn
with other optimization goals with standard fluid therapy (analysis 1: GDFTdyn alone versus standard fluid
therapy; analysis 2: GDFTdyn with other optimization
goals versus standard fluid therapy, respectively). We divided the included studies into these two groups according to the combination of other optimization goals. Note
that we did not take heart rate, blood pressure, CVP, and
urine output into consideration of other optimization
goals because normalization of them could not prevent
the occurrence of occult tissue hypoxia [3, 4]. Sensitivity
analysis was conducted after excluding studies with high
risk of bias. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the type of surgery (cardiac or non-cardiac), patient risk (high or moderate risk), fluid management
(fluid with or without inotropes), and monitoring devices
(minimally invasive or non-invasive).
Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Denmark).
Dichotomous data outcomes were analyzed using
Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model and results presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals
(CI). Continuous data outcomes were analyzed using inverse variance random-effects modeling and quoted as
mean differences (MD) with 95% CIs. A statistically significant difference between groups was considered to be
present if the pooled 95% CI did not include 0 for respective MD or 1 for respective OR. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by I-square test and considered to
be significant if I-square was > 75%.
Results
Study selection and characteristics
After removal of duplicates, a total of 794 studies
remained: 81 studies were reviewed in full and 37 studies
finally met the inclusion criteria. The process of literature searching, screening and selection is presented in
Additional file 2. The 37 studies included a total of 2910
patients, 1456 in the GDFTdyn arm and 1454 in the
standard fluid therapy arm [13–49]. Patients in 27 studies were defined as high risk due to patient-related or
surgery-related reasons. Of all included studies, 20 studies were based in abdominal surgery, 5 in cardiovascular,
3 in neurological, 2 in head and neck, 2 in thoracic, 1 in
orthopedic and 1 in urologic surgery. Analysis 1 included 11 studies and analysis 2 included 26 studies.
SVV, PVV, SPV and PVI were measured as GDFTdyn
endpoints. CO or CI was the common or even the only
goal except for GDFTdyn endpoints in almost all studies
included in analysis 2. The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 1.

Quality assessment
Risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. The methodological quality of the included
studies is summarized in Additional file 3. Random sequence generation was clearly reported in 30 of the included studies and allocation concealment in 22 studies:
17 of the studies clearly stated the blinding of participants, and 24 of the studies clearly reported blinding of
the outcome assessment. Incomplete outcome data were
not clearly reported in six studies. Selective reporting
was found only in one study.
Meta-analyses
Analysis 1: GDFTdyn alone versus standard fluid therapy
Primary outcomes Six studies including 524 patients reported postoperative short-term mortality. The
meta-analysis of these trials showed no significant difference
between the patients managed with GDFTdyn alone and
those with standard fluid therapy (OR 0.85, 95% CI (0.32,
2.24), P = 0.74, I2 = 0%) (Fig. 1). Sensitive analysis excluding
studies with high risk of bias also showed no significant
difference between two groups (Additional file 4). No significant difference was found between two groups among any
subgroup analyses (Table 3).
Three studies including 282 patients reported postoperative overall morbidity. No significant difference was
observed between GDFTdyn alone and standard fluid
therapy group (OR 1.03, 95% CI (0.31, 3.37), P = 0.97,
I
2 = 67%) (Fig. 2). Sensitive analysis excluding studies
with high risk of bias also showed no significant difference between two groups (Additional file 5). No significant difference was found between two groups in any
subgroup analyses (Table 3).
Secondary outcomes
Serum lactate concentration was significantly lower in patients managed with GDFTdyn alone (MD − 0.21 mmol/
L, 95% CI (− 0.39, − 0.03), P = 0.02, I2 = 82%) (Fig. 3).
However, no significant difference was found between two
groups in any organ-specific morbidity (Table 2), length of
stay in ICU (MD -0.26d, 95% CI (− 2.00, 1.47), P = 0.77,
I
2 = 0%) (Fig. 4) and hospital (MD 0.19d, 95% CI (− 1.11,
1.49), P = 0.77, I2 = 41%) (Fig. 5). The reduction in serum
lactate concentration persisted in non-cardiac surgery,
high-risk patients, fluid management without inotropes
and minimally invasive monitoring device subgroups. No
significant difference was found in length of stay in ICU
and hospital among any subgroup analyses (Table 3).
Analysis 2: GDFTdyn with other optimization goals versus
standard fluid therapy
Primary outcomes
Postoperative short-term mortality was reported in 13 studies including 1100 patients. Compared with standard fluid
therapy, a significant reduction in short-term mortality was
observed in favor of GDFTdyn with other optimization
goals (OR 0.45, 95% CI (0.24, 0.85), P = 0.01, I
2 = 0%)
(Fig. 1). Sensitivity analysis excluding studies with high risk
of bias also showed significant reduction in short-term

mortality by GDFTdyn with other optimization goals
(Additional file 4). Subgroup analyses showed that the
reduction in short-term mortality was associated with
high-risk patients, the use of fluid and inotropes, and
minimally invasive monitoring devices (Table 3).
Postoperative overall morbidity was reported in 15 studies
with 1330 patients. Overall morbidity was significantly
reduced in patients managed with GDFTdyn and other
optimization goals when compared with those managed with
standard care (OR 0.41, 95% CI (0.28, 0.58), P < 0.00001,
I
2 = 48%) (Fig. 2). Sensitivity analysis excluding studies with
high risk of bias also showed significant reduction in overall
morbidity by GDFTdyn with other optimization goals
(Additional file 5). Also, subgroup analysis showed that the

concentration and length of stay in the ICU and in hospital
persisted in high-risk patients, and in subgroups receiving
fluid with inotropes and minimally invasive monitoring
devices (Table 3).
Discussion
The current study demonstrated that GDFTdyn alone was
not associated with improved clinical outcomes except for
the reduction in serum lactate concentration. However, further analysis of studies evaluating GDFTdyn with other
optimization goals (mainly CO or CI) in their intervention
arm revealed that the combination was associated with significant reduction in short-term mortality, overall morbidity,
serum lactate concentration, cardiopulmonary complications,
and length of stay in the ICU and in hospital.
Postoperative morbidity is as important as short-term
mortality, for it might lead to loss of organ function and

have an impact on long-term mortality [50]. Currently, evidence for the beneficial effects of GDFTdyn on mortality
and morbidity has been inconsistent. Moreover, there is still
no consensus on the most appropriate goals in GDFT strategies. Interestingly, our study revealed that optimization of
fluid responsiveness by GDFTdyn alone was not associated
with reduced mortality and morbidity. However,
optimization of fluid responsiveness was found to be beneficial when it was in conjunction with other optimization
goals (mainly CO or CI) to optimize tissue and organ perfusion. Increasing cardiac contractility produces an increase
in the slope of the Frank-Starling curve, such that patients
on the flat section of the original curve move to a steeper
section of the new curve [51]. Therefore, by reaching the
goals of GDFTdyn and CO/CI simultaneously, maximal
stroke volume and adequate perfusion is achieved. Subgroup analyses also showed that the beneficial effects of
GDFTdyn and other optimization goals persisted in patients using fluid and inotropes as the intervention. Another explanation for the improved clinical outcomes
with the combination of GDFTdyn and CO/CI goals
might be the gray zone of GDFTdyn endpoints. The
gray zone of these dynamic variables has been considered unable to reliably predict fluid responsiveness [52,
53]. Although we could not identify the exact proportion of patients with a gray zone value in the studies included in our analysis, reaching CO/CI goals might
prevent these patients from organ hypoperfusion. Our
results contradicted a previous meta-analysis, which indicated a benefit of GDFTdyn compared to standard
fluid therapy in reducing incidence of postoperative
morbidity [5]. In their meta-analysis, 8 of 14 studies
combined GDFTdyn endpoints with other optimization
goals as interventions. Mixing studies on GDFTdyn
alone with those on GDFTdyn with other optimization
goals might lead to inaccurate or even erroneous
conclusions.
High-risk patients undergoing surgery are thought to
have higher oxygen demand and limited cardiopulmonary
reserve. There is concern about GDFT-related cardiopulmonary complications in high-risk patients. Opposingly, we
found that the improved clinical outcomes of GDFTdyn
with CO/CI goals persisted in high-risk patients. Especially,
in the analysis of organ-specific morbidity, cardiopulmonary complications were significantly reduced by the combined goals. Another meta-analysis on high-risk surgery
also showed the use of fluid and inotropes reduced the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia without increasing the incidence of acute pulmonary edema [8]. It seems that
maximizing stroke volume and oxygen delivery is beneficial
especially for high-risk patients, which might be attributed
to improved tissue perfusion and cardiac performance.
Serum lactate concentration could serve as a sensitive
biochemical variable of oxygen debt. The association
between decreased serum lactate and a reduction in postoperative complications was found in previous studies
[54]. In the current study, significant reduction in serum
lactate and postoperative morbidity were also observed in
the group with GDFTdyn and other optimization goals.
However, in the GDFTdyn-alone group, serum lactate was
lowered but reduction in postoperative morbidity was not
observed. The reduction in serum lactate by GDFTdyn
alone (− 0.21 mmol/L) was much less than that by
GDFTdyn with other optimization goals (− 0.60 mmol/L).
It might imply that GDFTdyn alone was less effective in
correcting tissue hypoperfusion without other
optimization goals.
Length of stay in the ICU and in hospital were also
shorter in patients managed with GDFTdyn with other
optimization goals but not in those managed with
GDFTdyn alone, which was similar to the results for
postoperative morbidity. It is possible that the significant
reduction in length of stay mostly is attributed to the
lower incidence of postoperative complications. The heterogeneity of length of stay in the ICU and in hospital in
the group with GDFTdyn and other optimization goals
was greater than 75%. It might be attributed to the enormous change in the protocols and discharge criteria in
the ICU and in hospital in recent years. Additionally, different units of measurement (days or hours) of length of
stay in the ICU reported in different studies might also
contribute to the heterogeneity.
Since the meta-analysis has several notable limitations,
the results should be interpreted with caution. The main
limitation was the clinical heterogeneity among different
populations, surgical procedures, and monitoring devices. We tried to address the issue by the following
measures. First, we divided the interventions into two
groups and conducted two separate analyses (GDFTdyn
alone versus standard fluid therapy and GDFTdyn with
other optimization goals versus standard fluid therapy).
Second, we conducted subgroup analyses according to
the type of surgery (cardiac and non-cardiac), patient
risk (high or moderate), fluid management (fluid with or
without inotropes), and monitoring devices (minimally
invasive or non-invasive). Finally, we used a random effect model to guarantee the robustness of the results
and conclusions. Another limitation was failing to demonstrate a relationship between the year of publication
of the included studies and the treatment effect. The included studies in the current meta-analysis spanned a
long period of time. During this period, goal-directed
fluid therapy has evolved rapidly and changed drastically.
Also, fluid management in the postoperative period also
has an important impact on clinical outcomes. However,
postoperative fluid therapy regimes were not stated
clearly in the included studies, making it difficult to
evaluate the effects of them on perioperative outcomes.

Conclusions
Based on the available data, we conclude that optimizing
fluid responsiveness by GDFTdyn alone is not sufficient to
improve clinical outcomes among patients undergoing surgery. However, the combination of GDFTdyn and other
optimization goals to improve tissue and organ perfusion is
associated with improved clinical outcomes. Patients managed with the combination of GDFTdyn and CO/CI goals
might derive most benefit. High quality evidences with adequate statistical power and rigorous methodology are urgently needed to verify the beneficial effects of GDFT
combined goals on clinical outcomes of patients undergoing surgery. Further researches are required to determine
the most beneficial protocol and timing of GDFT strategies
among different type of surgery (cardiac and non-cardiac)
and different surgical populations (high or moderate risk).
