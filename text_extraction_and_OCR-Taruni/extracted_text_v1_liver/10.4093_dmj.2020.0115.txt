The worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is around 25%, and that of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
ranges from 1.5% to 6.45%. Patients with NASH, especially those with fibrosis, are at higher risk for adverse outcomes such as cirrhosis and liver-related mortality. Although vitamin E, pioglitazone, and liraglutide improved liver histology in randomized trials, 
there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for NASH. Five pharmacologic agents—obeticholic acid, 
elafibranor, cenicriviroc, resmetirom, and aramchol—are being evaluated in large, histology-based phase 3 trials. Within 2 to 4 
years, new and effective drugs for the treatment of NASH are expected. Additionally, many phase 2 trials are ongoing for various 
agents. Based on the results of phase 2 and 3 trials, combination treatments are also being investigated. Future treatment strategies 
will comprise drug combinations and precision medicine based on the different phenotypes of NASH and treatment response of 
the individual patient.

INTRODUCTION
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be classified histologically into nonalcoholic fatty liver or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The worldwide prevalence of NAFLD is 
around 25%, and that of NASH ranges from 1.5% to 6.45% [1]. 
Patients with NASH, especially those with fibrosis, are at higher risk for adverse outcomes such as cirrhosis and liver-related 
mortality [2-7]. The most important histological feature of 
NAFLD associated with long-term mortality is fibrosis (stage 
2–4) [2,8,9]. Therefore, one of the following two surrogates 
must be satisfied in phase 2b or 3 trials for conditional approval of drug development: (1) resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis or (2) a reduction in fibrosis by one or more 
stages without worsening of NASH [10,11]. Although there are 
currently no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
drugs for NASH, vitamin E, pioglitazone, and liraglutide improved the liver histology of patients with NASH in randomized trials [12-16]. Despite its potential benefits, vitamin E has 
been associated with conflicting reports of increased overall 
mortality [17,18], in haemorrhagic stroke [19] and prostate 
cancer in males older than 50 [20]. Pioglitazone causes weight 
gain [12-14], and its usefulness for NASH is still under investigation. Therefore, these risks must be balanced with the potential benefit in NASH patients, who have no options for treatment other than lifestyle modification. At present, weight loss 
and lifestyle modification with diet and exercise is recommended as the first-line therapy [21-24]. However, long-term 
compliance with lifestyle modification is difficult to achieve 
and maintain in the target population. Therefore, a major unmet need for a new drug to resolve NASH and reverse liver fibrosis exists. Recent main therapeutic targets for NASH are 
bile acid pathway, insulin resistance, inflammation, thyroid 
hormone receptor (THR)-β stimulation, hepatic lipid metaboReview

lism, anti-fibrosis, and so on. Five pharmacologic agents—
obeticholic acid (OCA; farnesoid X receptor [FXR] agonist), 
elafibranor (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
[PPAR] α and δ agonist), cenicriviroc (CVC; an dual antagonist of C–C chemokine receptor [CCR] types 2 and 5), resmetriom (THR-β agonist), and aramchol (stearoyl-CoA desaturase [SCD] 1 inhibitor)—improved liver histology in phase 2 
studies [25-29], and are undergoing phase 3 studies to evaluate 
their long-term efficacy and safety. Additionally, multiple novel 
agents targeting NASH-related pathways are the subjects of 
phase 1 and 2 trials, and approximately 200 pharmacologic 
agents are being evaluated for NASH treatment. This review 
summarizes the mechanisms of action of the main pharmacologic agents and outlines the pivotal phase 2 and 3 studies that 
have been completed or are ongoing.
DRUG CLASSIFICATION BASED ON THE 
ACTION OF MECHANISM
Bile acid pathways
Farnesoid X receptor agonist, obeticholic acid
OCA is derived from the primary human bile acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, which is a natural FXR agonist [30]. As a result 
of synthetic modification, OCA stimulates FXR activity 100-
fold more intensely than chenodeoxycholic acid [30]. FXR is a 
nuclear receptor that is highly expressed in the liver and small 
intestine, and plays an important role in the synthesis and enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (Fig. 1) [31]. FXR activation reduces bile acid synthesis by inhibiting the conversion of 
cholesterol to bile acids, and it possesses antiinflammatory and 
antifibrogenic activity [32]. Activation of FXR in the ileum also

inhibits the uptake of bile acids by downregulating the sodium-dependent bile acid transporter. Finally, OCA exerts anticholestatic and hepatoprotective effects by regulating the metabolism of cholesterol and bile acids [33]. 
In a phase 2a clinical trial on OCA, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and NAFLD were randomly assigned 
to groups given placebo (n=23), 25 mg OCA (n=20), or 50 mg 
OCA (n=21) once daily for 6 weeks (NCT00501592) [34]. Insulin sensitivity increased by 24.5% (P=0.011) in the combined OCA groups, whereas it decreased by 5.5% in the placebo group. The OCA groups had significant reductions in the 
levels of γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and dose-related weight loss. Also, the levels of 
markers of liver fibrosis decreased significantly in the group 
treated with 25 mg OCA. In a phase 2b clinical trial, non-cirrhotic patients with NASH were randomly assigned 1:1 to 
groups given placebo (n=142), and 25 mg OCA (n=141) once 
daily for 72 weeks (FLINT, NCT01265498) [25]. Fifty (45%) of 
110 patients in the OCA group had improved liver histology 
compared with 23 (21%) of 109 patients in the placebo group 
(relative risk, 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.8; 
P=0.0002). Also, 23% of the OCA group developed pruritus 
compared with 6% of the placebo group. OCA improved the 
histological features of NASH, but its long-term benefit and 
safety need further clarification.
In the interim analysis of an ongoing, phase 3 study of OCA, 
patients with NASH, an NAFLD activity score (NAS) of at least 
4, and fibrosis stages F2–F3, or F1 with at least one accompanying comorbidity were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive oral placebo, OCA 10 mg, or OCA 25 mg daily (GENERATE, NCT02548351) (Table 1) [35]. The primary analysis 
involved 931 patients with stage F2–F3 fibrosis (311 in the placebo group, 312 in the OCA 10 mg group, and 308 in the OCA 
25 mg group). The fibrosis improvement endpoint was achieved 
by 37 (12%) patients in the placebo group, 55 (18%) in the 
OCA 10 mg group (P=0.045), and 71 (23%) in the OCA 25 
mg group (P=0.0002). The NASH resolution endpoint was not 
met. However, the results of this interim analysis showed that 
OCA 25 mg significantly improved fibrosis and key components of NASH activity.
In the safety population (1,968 patients with fibrosis stages 
F1–F3) of this trial, the most common adverse event was pruritus, which occurred in 51% of the OCA 25 mg group, 28% of 
the OCA 10 mg group, and 19% of the placebo group. Pruritis 
was generally mild to moderate in severity; however, 9% of the 
OCA 25 mg safety population discontinued the drug because 
of pruritus. The lipoprotein profile was also monitored in the 
safety population. The mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels peaked at 3 months in 
the OCA group. Also, 17% of the OCA group and 7% of the 
placebo group needed statin treatment.
A recent phase 2 trial (CONTROL, NCT02633956) evaluating the use of OCA combined with a statin for NASH showed 
that use of OCA at 5, 10, or 25 mg daily increased the LDL-C 
level after 4 weeks of treatment, and the addition of atorvastatin 10 mg decreased the LDL-C level to below baseline in all 
OCA groups by week 8 [36]. The combination of OCA and 
atorvastatin was generally safe and well tolerated.
The scope of OCA has been expanded to cirrhosis, and a 
phase 3 trial of OCA in patients with compensated cirrhosis due 
to NASH is ongoing. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 
groups given 10 mg OCA, 10 mg with titration to 25 mg OCA at 
3 months, or placebo for 18 months (REVERSE, NCT03439254) 
(Table 1). The REVERSE study uses a dose-escalation approach 
as hepatic decompensation arises in patients with advanced 
cholestatic liver disease treated with OCA [37]. The primary 
endpoint is the proportion of subjects with improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH.
Non-bile acid FXR agonist 
1) Tropifexor (LJN-452)
Tropifexor (TXR; LJN452) is a highly potent, non-bile acid FXR 
agonist that induces the expression of target genes at very low 
doses without significant Takeda G-protein coupled receptor 
clone 5 activation [38]. A 48-week phase 2 trial on TXR in patients with NASH is ongoing (FLIGHT-FXR, NCT02855164) 
(Table 2) [39]. In an interim analysis after 12 weeks, similar to 
OCA, TXR demonstrated unfavorable lipid changes with a 
dose-related increase in the LDL-C level and a decrease in the 
high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level, in addition 
to pruritus, at higher doses compared with placebo. There was 
also a relative decrease in liver fat content by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) of 
−9.8% in placebo, −16.9% with TXR 60 mg, and −15.6% with 
TXR 90 mg, in the interim analysis. Further analysis demonstrated that TXR was more efficacious in patients with a lower 
body mass index (BMI), suggesting that a weight-based dosing 
approach may be necessary [40].

2) Cilofexor (GS-9674)
Because OCA has problematic side effects such as pruritus, hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic decompensation, selective 
non-bile acid synthetic FXR agonists have been developed. 
Cilofexor (GS-9674) is a potent, selective, nonsteroidal agonist 
of FXR that primarily functions to activate FXR in the intestine 
and does not undergo enterohepatic circulation [41]. Intestinal 
FXR agonism by cilofexor accentuates the physiologic release 
of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19, and may mitigate the detrimental effects of systemic FXR activation, including dyslipidemia, pruritus, and hepatotoxicity [41,42]. In a proof-of-concept study, 10 patients with NASH and F2–3 fibrosis who received 30 mg of cilofexor once daily for 12 weeks experienced 
decreased hepatic fat level and stiffness, and improved liver 
biochemistry [43]. 
In a phase 2 trial, 140 non-cirrhotic and NASH patients were 
randomized to cilofexor 100 mg (n=56), cilofexor 30 mg 
(n=56), or placebo (n=28) for 24 weeks (NCT02854605) (Table 2) [44]. The results indicated that 100 mg of cilofexor reduced the hepatic fat content and was reasonably well tolerated. Pruritus was not common but was more frequent in the 
100 mg (14%) versus 30 mg (4%) cilofexor and placebo groups 
(4%). No difference in pruritus was seen at the 30 mg dose 
compared with placebo but, like many other FXR agonists, 
cilofexor caused pruritis dose dependently, with more moderate to severe pruritus in those receiving 100 mg daily compared 
with placebo. Cilofexor for 24 weeks resulted in significant reductions in hepatic steatosis, liver biochemistry, and serum 
bile acids in patients with NASH. Other FXR agonists (nidufexor [45], and EDP-305 [46]) have been developed and are in 
phase 2 trials.
Fibroblast growth factor 19 analogue, NGM282
The FGF family of hormones mediate metabolic functions and 
tissue repair and regeneration [47]. FGF19 is a downstream 
target of FXR activation, with FXR initiating FGF19 secretion 
by the intestine. FGF19 is a hormone that regulates bile acid 
synthesis and glucose homeostasis [48], and NGM282 is an 
engineered analogue of FGF19 (Fig. 1). 
In a phase 2 study, 82 patients with biopsy proven NASH were 
randomly assigned to receive 3 mg (n=27) or 6 mg subcutaneous NGM282 (n=28) or placebo (n=27) (NCT02443116) [49]. 
The primary endpoint was the absolute change in liver fat content from baseline to week 12. Responders were patients who 
achieved a 5% or greater reduction in absolute liver fat content 
as measured by MRI-PDFF. At 12 weeks, 20 (74%) patients in 
the 3 mg dose group and 22 (79%) in the 6 mg dose group 
achieved at least a 5% reduction in absolute liver fat content 
from baseline versus two (7%) in the placebo group. NGM282 
produced rapid and significant reductions in liver fat content 
with an acceptable safety profile in patients with NASH. In a recent open-label study, the histological efficacy of NGM282 in 
patients with biopsy proven NASH was assessed [50].
Paired liver biopsies from 43 patients who received subcutaneous NGM282 (1 mg, n=24; 3 mg, n=19) once daily for 12 
weeks were evaluated, blinded to time point, subject, and clinical information. At week 12, NGM282 improved the histological features of NASH, with significant reductions in the NAS 
and fibrosis scores, accompanied by improvements in noninvasive imaging and serum markers. A larger phase 2 study 
with a target of 250 participants with biopsy proven NASH is 
currently actively recruiting (NCT02443116) (Table 2).
Pegylated fibroblast growth factor 21, pegbelfermin 
(BMS-986036)
FGF21 has also been implicated in bile acid pathways. Activation of FXR, together with PPARα, induces hepatic expression 
and secretion of FGF21 [51]. FGF21, a non-mitogenic hormone, is a key regulator of energy metabolism [52]. Endogenous FGF21 has a short half-life of 1 to 2 hours, but various 
modification strategies have been used to create longer-acting 
FGF21 analogues [53]. Pegbelfermin (BMS-986036) is a polyethylene glycol-conjugated recombinant analogue of human 
FGF21 with a prolonged half-life that enables up to weekly 
dosing.
In a randomized, double-blind, phase 2a study, 75 patients 
with a BMI of at least 25 kg/m², biopsy-confirmed NASH (fibrosis stage 1–3), and a hepatic fat fraction of at least 10% by 
MRI-PDFF were randomized into three groups (25 patients to 
receive 10 mg pegbelfermin once daily; 24 to receive 20 mg 
pegbelfermin once weekly, and 26 to receive placebo) [54]. 
There was a significant decrease in the absolute hepatic fat 
fraction in the group receiving 10 mg pegbelfermin daily and 
in the group receiving 20 mg pegbelfermin weekly compared 
with the placebo group. Most adverse events were mild; the 
most common was diarrhea in eight (16%) of 49 patients treated with pegbelfermin. Treatment with pegbelfermin for 16 
weeks was generally well tolerated and significantly reduced 
the hepatic fat fraction in patients with NASH. Currently, two 
large phase 2 trials (FALCON 1, n=160; FALCON 2, n=152) 

Jeong SW
646 Diabetes Metab J 2020;44:640-657 https://e-dmj.org
are ongoing to assess the safety and efficacy of pegbelfermin 
(NCT03486899 and NCT03486912, respectively) (Table 2).
Insulin resistance 
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist
1) Elafibranor 
PPARs are nuclear receptors playing key roles in cellular processes regulating metabolic homeostasis, immune-inflammation, and differentiation. There are three nuclear receptor isoforms, PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ, which are encoded by 
different genes [55]. Elafibranor (GFT505) is a dual a PPARα
and δ agonist, and it regulates lipid and insulin metabolism. 
PPARα is most prominently expressed in the liver and is activated by hypolipidemic fibrates. PPARα controls the lipid flux 
in the liver by modulating fatty acid transport and β-oxidation 
and improves plasma lipids by decreasing the triglyceride level 
and increasing that of HDL-C [56]. In advanced NASH, the 
PPARα level is reduced but recovers after improvement [57]. 
PPARδ (also called PPARβ) regulates metabolism in the liver 
and peripheral tissues. PPARδ agonists enhance fatty acid transport and oxidation, increase the HDL level, and improve glucose homeostasis by enhancing insulin sensitivity and inhibiting 
hepatic glucose output [58]. In a pilot trial, a selective PPARδ
agonist reduced liver fat content, improved insulin sensitivity 
and plasma lipid levels, and decreased the γ-GT level [59].
In a phase 2b clinical trial on elafibranor, patients with 
NASH without cirrhosis were randomized to receive elafibranor 80 mg (n=93), elafibranor 120 mg (n=91), or placebo (n= 
92) daily for 52 weeks (GOLDEN-505, NCT01694849) [26]. 
The primary outcome was resolution of NASH without fibrosis 
worsening, using protocol-defined and modified definitions. 
In an intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference between the elafibranor and placebo groups in the primary outcome. However, in a post hoc analysis of patients with 
NAS ≥4 (n=234), elafibranor 120 mg resolved NASH in a 
larger proportion of patients than placebo based on the protocol definition (20% vs. 11%; odds ratio, 3.16; P=0.018) and the 
modified definitions (19% vs. 9%; odds ratio, 3.52; P=0.013). 
Also, patients in whom NASH resolved after receiving elafibranor 120 mg had reduced liver fibrosis compared to those without NASH resolution. The levels of liver enzymes, lipids, and 
markers of systemic inflammation, as well as the glucose profile, were significantly reduced in the elafibranor 120 mg group 
versus the placebo group. Elafibranor was well tolerated and 
did not cause weight gain or cardiac events, but did produce a 
mild, reversible increase in the serum creatinine level.
A phase 3 trial on elafibranor in 2,000 NASH patients (NAS 
≥4) with stage 2/3 fibrosis is ongoing (RESOLVE-IT, NCT0270-
4403) (Table 1). The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis 
at 72 weeks. The trial also evaluated a composite long-term 
outcome composed of all-cause mortality, cirrhosis, and liverrelated clinical outcomes at 4 years. The trial began in March 
2016, and the results are due in December 2021.
2) Lanifibranor 
Lanifibranor (IVA337) is a moderately potent agonist of all 
three PPAR isoforms, with well-balanced activation of PPARα
and PPARδ and partial activation of PPARγ [60]. While other 
PPAR agonists target one or two PPAR isoforms, lanifibranor 
is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development.
In a phase 2b clinical trial on lanifibranor (IVA337) in 
NASH patients with liver steatosis and moderate to severe 
necroinflammation without cirrhosis, 247 patients were randomly assigned to receive lanifibranor 800 mg, 1200 mg, or 
placebo per day for 24 weeks (NATIVE, NCT03008070) (Table 
2). The primary endpoint was a decrease from baseline in the 
SAF (steatosis, S; activity, A; and fibrosis, F) activity score. The 
study began in January 2017 and was completed in March 
2020. Initial results are expected in the first half of 2020.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide
No pharmacotherapies have been established for patients with 
NASH and T2DM. The main point is to determine the best antidiabetic drugs for treatment of NASH, to prevent the progression of hepatic fibrosis and cardiovascular or renal events. 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are expected to ameliorate NASH and NAFLD. GLP-1 is a gut-derived incretin hormone that induces weight loss and insulin 
sensitivity. GLP-1 analogs are approved for use in patients with 
T2DM and obesity. These analogs provide the benefits of 
weight loss, improved glycemic control, fewer hypoglycemic 
events, and a reduced frequency of major cardiovascular events 
[61,62]. There is interest in the therapeutic role of GLP-1 RAs 
for NAFLD and NASH [15,63-66].
In a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 
52 patients with biopsy-proven NASH, 1.8 mg of liraglutide 
administered subcutaneously daily for 48 weeks was associated 
with greater resolution of NASH and less progression of fibro-

sis [15]. However, the American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases practice guidance 2018 recommended that it is 
premature to consider GLP-1 agonists for treating liver disease 
in patients with NAFLD or NASH [24]. 
Semaglutide is a novel GLP-1 analogue with an extended 
half-life of approximately 1 week. In a phase 2 study of the effect 
of semaglutide on NASH, 320 patients with NASH were randomly assigned to placebo or three dose levels of semaglutide 
subcutaneously for 72 weeks (NCT02970942) (Table 2). The 
primary endpoint was NASH resolution without worsening of 
fibrosis. Initial results from the study are expected in May 2020, 
with completion anticipated in July 2020. Another phase 2 study 
of semaglutide involves once-weekly injection of semaglutide, 
2.4 mg, for 48 weeks. The primary outcome is improvement of 
liver fibrosis by at least 1 stage with no worsening of NASH after 
48 weeks (NCT03987451) (Table 2). Semaglutide is the most 
promising of various GLP-1 analogues for the treatment of diabetic NASH. However, whether GLP-1 analogues improve hepatic inflammation or fibrosis in NASH is unknown.
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin 
SGLT2 inhibits glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, 
leading to glucouria and a reduction in the plasma glucose level. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors have therapeutic potential for 
NASH and NAFLD. Small studies have shown the effect of 
dapagliflozin in patients with NAFLD and T2DM [67,68]. Although the possibility cannot be excluded that the reduction in 
body weight or visceral adipose tissue caused by dapagliflozin 
may be associated with a decrease in liver steatosis or fibrosis, 
dapagliflozin showed a beneficial effect in patients with NAFLD. 
A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing to assess the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin for treating NASH (DEAN, NCT03723252) (Table 1). 
The primary endpoint is improvement of the liver histological 
score at 12 months. One-hundred patients with NASH were 
randomly assigned to placebo or 10 mg of dapagliflozin. The 
study began in March 2019, and the results are due in November 2021.
Mitochondrial target of thiazolidinedione, MSDC-0602K
First-generation insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones directly 
bind to and activate the PPARγ nuclear hormone receptor and 
are used to treat T2DM [69]. However, they are associated with 
significant side effects including edema, bone fractures mediated by PPARγ, and hypoglycemia. The second-generation insulin sensitizer MSDC-0602K was designed to reduce these 
side effects, while still producing insulin sensitizing pharmacology in animal models of diabetes [70] and NASH [71]. It 
modulates the effects of over-nutrition at the level of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) with minimal PPARγ binding (Fig. 1) [72]. Initial studies showed that MSDC-0602 could 
increase lipid oxidation and reduce de novo lipid synthesis and 
gluconeogenesis in the liver, both in vivo and in vitro, without 
the side-effects of first-generation insulin sensitizers [73].
In a 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
phase 2b study, patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis (F1–F3) were randomly assigned to placebo (n=94), or 
62.5 mg (n=99), 125 mg (n=98), or 250 mg (n=101) of MSDC-0602K (EMMINENCE, NCT02784444) (Table 2) [74]. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was hepatic histological improvement of ≥2 points in NAS with a ≥1-point reduction in 
ballooning or lobular inflammation and no increase in fibrosis 
stage at 12 months. In that study, MSDC-0602K did not exert a 
significant effect on liver histology. However, MSDC-0602K 
significantly decreased the levels of fasting glucose, insulin, 
glycated hemoglobin, and markers of liver injury without 
dose-limiting side effects. A phase 3 study will be initiated in 
2020 (MMONARCh, NCT03970031).
Inflammation 
C-C chemokine receptor types 2 and 5 antagonist, cenicriviroc 
CVC is an oral, dual antagonist of CCR2 and CCR5. Blockade 
of CCR2, a chemokine receptor predominantly expressed on 
monocytes and macrophages, results in reduced recruitment, 
migration and infiltration of these cells to the injured parts of 
the liver [75,76]. Parallel CCR5 inhibition impairs the migration, activation and proliferation of activated hepatic stellate 
cells [76,77].
In a phase 2b trial on CVC in patients with NASH (NAS ≥4) 
with fibrosis (stages 1–3), patients (n=289) were randomly assigned CVC 150 mg or placebo. The primary outcome was a 
≥2-point improvement in NAS and no worsening of fibrosis at 
1 year (CENTAUR, NCT02217475) [27,78]. The primary endpoint of NAS improvement in the intention-to-treat population and resolution of NASH was achieved in a similar proportion of subjects on CVC (n=145) and placebo. However, the fibrosis endpoint was met in significantly more subjects on CVC 
than placebo (20% vs. 10%, P=0.02). Treatment benefits were 
greater in those with higher disease activity and fibrosis stage 
at baseline. After 1 year of CVC treatment, twice as many sub-

jects achieved improvement in fibrosis and no worsening of 
NASH compared with placebo.
AURORA (NCT03028740), a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 study is ongoing to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of CVC for the treatment of liver fibrosis in 2,000 NASH patients with stage 2/3 fibrosis (Table 
1). The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will examine the surrogate endpoint of improvement in fibrosis of at 
least one stage and no worsening of NASH at 12 months. Subjects from part 1 will continue into part 2 and additional subjects will be newly randomized in part 2 to determine longterm clinical outcomes—histopathologic progression to cirrhosis, liver-related clinical parameters, and all-cause mortality. The trial began in April 2017, and the results are expected in 
December 2024.
Thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist 
1) Resmetirom (MGL-3196) 
The THR-β is highly expressed in hepatocytes. NASH might be, 
in part, a condition of diminished liver thyroid hormone levels 
or hepatic hypothyroidism, and the incidence of clinical and 
subclinical hypothyroidism is higher in patients with NAFLD 
or NASH relative to age-matched controls [79,80]. THR-β
stimulation is responsible for the beneficial metabolic effects on 
triglycerides and cholesterol levels as well as improvements in 
hepatic steatosis [79]. With a favorable cardiometabolic profile 
and the alleviation of hepatic steatosis, THR-β agonists are being investigated for the treatment of NASH.
Resmetirom (MGL-3196) is a liver-directed, orally active, 
selective THR-β agonist designed to improve NASH by increasing hepatic fat metabolism and reducing lipotoxicity. In a 
phase 2 study, patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH (fibrosis 
stages 1–3) and a hepatic fat fraction ≥10% by MRI-PDFF, 
were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive resmetirom 80 mg or 
matching placebo, orally once daily (NCT02912260) [28]. 
The primary outcome was the percentage of change from 
baseline in hepatic fat fraction assessed by MRI-PDFF at 12 
weeks. Resmetirom treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the hepatic fat fraction after 12 and 36 weeks. Resmetirom was well tolerated but caused an increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, which were self-limited and did not result 
in study withdrawal.
A phase 3 trial involving 2,000 NASH patients with stage 2/3 
fibrosis is ongoing (MAESTRO-NASH, NCT03900429) (Table 
1). The primary outcome is the effect of resmetirom 80 or 100 
mg compared to placebo on liver histology, and there is a composite long-term outcome of the number of patients with onset 
of any of the adjudicated events—cirrhosis, all-cause mortality, 
and liver-related clinical parameters. The trial began in March 
2019, and the results are due in March 2024.
2) VK2809
VK2809 is a small-molecule prodrug of a potent THR-β agonist. VK2809 is selectively cleaved in hepatic tissue by cytochrome P450 isozyme 3A4, to release a pharmacologically active metabolite. In a phase 2a trial, patients with a liver fat content of ≥8% as assessed by MRI-PDFF, an LDL-C level of ≥110 
mg/dL, and a triglyceride level of ≥120 mg/dL were randomized to receive oral VK2809 at 5 mg once daily, 10 mg once every other day, 10 mg once daily, or placebo for 12 weeks [81].
Patients receiving VK2809 experienced a significant reduction in liver fat content by MRI-PDFF, relative to placebo. The 
median relative change from baseline in liver fat content was 
53.8% for VK2809 5 mg once daily (P=0.0001), 56.5% for 
VK2809 10 mg once every other day (P=0.0018), and 59.7% for 
VK2809 10 mg once daily (P=0.0004), versus 9.4% for placebo.
Based on these results, a phase 2b study is ongoing in 337 
patients with biopsy proven NASH, to assess the efficacy and 
safety of VK2809 (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10 mg) versus placebo for 52 
weeks. The primary outcome is the relative change in liver fat 
content (assessed by MRI-PDFF) from baseline to 12 weeks 
(VOYAGE, NCT04173065). The study began in November 
2019.
Hepatic lipid metabolism
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 inhibitor, aramchol 
Arachidyl amido cholanoic acid (aramchol) is a novel synthetic 
lipid molecule that is a conjugate of cholic acid (a bile acid) and 
arachidic acid (a fatty acid). It inhibits SCD1, which converts 
saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 1) 
[82]. Aramchol has been studied in a phase 2a trial over 3 
months at doses of 100 and 300 mg daily. This study demonstrated a reduction in liver fat by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) after 3 months of treatment in the group receiving 
aramchol, 300 mg, compared with placebo, but not in the 
group receiving 100 mg. There was also a reduction in the ALT 
level and the compound was well tolerated [83]. Higher doses 
of aramchol (400 and 600 mg) were administrated to patients 
with biopsy proven NASH (n=247) without cirrhosis in a 
phase 2b trial that evaluated their effect on the hepatic triglyc-

The NAFLD drug revolution
https://e-dmj.org Diabetes Metab J 2020;44:640-657 649
eride content using MRS and liver biopsy (ARREST, NCT02279524) [29]. There was a significant ≥5% reduction in liver 
fat content with 600 mg aramchol, 47%, compared with placebo, 24%. According to liver histology, NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis occurred more often with aramchol, 
600 mg, than placebo (16.7% vs. 5%; odds ratio, 4.74; 95% CI, 
0.99 to 22.66). Although the study was underpowered for histological assessment, a dose-response trend toward NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement was seen. A phase 3/4, multinational, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aramchol in subjects with 
NASH (fibrosis 2 or 3) who are overweight or obese and have 
prediabetes or T2DM (ARMOR, NCT04104321) has been 
proceeding since September 2019 (Table 1).
Liver X receptor-α inhibitor, oltipraz
Oltipraz, is a synthetic dithiolethione that functions as an antisteatotic agent by inhibiting liver X receptor α (LXRα) activity 
(Fig. 1) [84]. Dithiolethiones, a novel class of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activators, prevent insulin resistance by inhibiting AMPK-dependent p70 ribosomal S6 kinase-1 (S6K1). AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of carbohydrate 
and fat metabolism, and it may modulate LXRα activity and 
decrease the expression of sterol regulatory element binding 
protein 1c (SREBP-1c), a key regulator of lipid production 
[85]. Oltipraz possesses therapeutic potential for steatosis by 
activating AMPK and inactivating S6K1. It also expedites lipid 
oxidation by inhibiting LXRα activity and decreasing the expression of SREBP-1c in the liver [84]. In a current phase 2 
study, patients with a liver fat content of >20% and hypertransaminasemia were randomized to three groups: placebo 
(n=22), 30 mg of oltipraz (n=22), or 60 mg of oltipraz (n=24) 
twice daily for 24 weeks (PMK-N01GI1, NCT01373554) [86]. 
The primary outcome was the change in the liver fat content 
assessed by MRS from baseline to 24 weeks.
Compared with the placebo group, oltipraz significantly reduced the liver fat content in a dose-dependent manner. However, the absolute changes in insulin resistance and the levels of 
liver enzymes, lipids, and cytokines were not significantly different among the groups. Also, the incidence of adverse events 
was comparable among the groups.
A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of oltipraz in 144 patients with NAFLD 
(NCT04142749) (Table 1). The primary outcome is the variation in liver fat content by MRS at 24 weeks compared to baseline. The trial began in December 2019, and initial results are 
expected in October 2021.
Acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase inhibitor, firsocostat 
(GS0976)
The regulation of de novo lipogenesis (DNL) plays a central 
role in fatty acid synthesis and catabolism. The rate-limiting 
step in DNL is conversion of acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) 
to malonyl-CoA by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(ACC). ACC has two isoforms. The ACC1 isoform catalyzes 
the formation of malonyl-CoA, the main substrate for fatty 
acid biosynthesis in the cytosol. ACC2 is localized in mitochondria, where malonyl-CoA serves as a potent allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase (CPT) 1, the carrier 
protein of fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation 
[83,87]. Inhibition of ACC1 and ACC2 would be expected to 
reduce DNL and enhance mitochondrial β-oxidation, respectively, supporting ACC inhibition as a therapeutic target in 
NASH [88-90]. Firsocostat (GS-0976) is a liver-targeted, smallmolecule allosteric inhibitor of both ACC1 and ACC2 in development for the treatment of NASH (Fig. 1).
In a recent phase 2 trial, 126 patients with hepatic steatosis of 
≥8% based on MRI-PDFF and liver stiffness of ≥2.5 kPa, based 
on MRE, or historical biopsy consistent with NASH and F1–F3 
fibrosis, were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive GS-0976 (20 
mg), GS-0976 (5 mg), or placebo daily for 12 weeks. In that 
study, administration of 20 mg of GS-0976 was safe and led to a 
significant reduction in hepatic fat content by MRI-PDFF and a 
decreased serum level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 
(TIMP1), a marker of fibrogenesis (NCT02856555) (Table 2) 
[91]. 
Anti-fibrotic agents
Galectin-3 antagonist, belapectin (GR-MD-02)
Galectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins belonging to the 
family of non-integrin β galactoside-binding lectins [92]. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is the most prominent galectin secreted in disease, mainly by macrophages. Gal-3 via its intracellular (antiapoptotic, macrophage differentiation) and extracellular (chemokinetic/chemotactic factor) effects is relevant to the physiopathology of hepatic fibrosis caused by various chronic liver 
diseases [93-96]. Galectin inhibitors are a new class of agents 
that target both secreted and membrane-associated galectins 

Jeong SW
650 Diabetes Metab J 2020;44:640-657 https://e-dmj.org
by virtue of their high molecular weight [97]. Belapectin (GRMD-02, galactoarabino-rhamnogalacturonate) is a complex 
carbohydrate molecule derived from a natural plant compound, which has oligosaccharide chains containing galactose 
residues and binds to galectin-3 and, to a lesser extent, galectin-1. A phase 1 study has shown that belapectin is safe and 
well tolerated at single and multiple doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg/kg 
in patients with well-characterized NASH and advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis [98].
In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial, 162 patients with NASH, cirrhosis, and 
portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] 
≥6 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to receive biweekly infusions of belapectin 2 mg/kg (n=54), 8 mg/kg (n=54), or placebo (n=54) for 52 weeks (Table 2) [99]. The primary endpoint 
was the change in HVPG (−28) at the end of the 52 week period compared with baseline. Belapectin was safe but was not associated with a significant reduction in HVPG or fibrosis, 
compared with placebo. However, in a subgroup analysis of 
patients without esophageal varices, 2 mg/kg belapectin did 
reduce HVPG and the development of varices. A phase 3 study 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of belapectin for the prevention of esophageal varices in patients with NASH cirrhosis 
without esophageal varices is being initiated (NCT 04365868).
COMBINATION THERAPY
NASH is a multifactorial disease involving different contributing mechanisms, with no approved therapies. As a future therapeutic direction, drug combinations are promising because of 
targeting multipul NASH pathways. Most drug combinations 
comprise metabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic agents; alternatively, an antidiabetic may be included. Recently, there are 
various combination therapeutic options for NASH (Table 3).
TXR and CVC
A recent randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase 2b 
study is ongoing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of TXR and CVC in 200 patients with NASH fibrosis 
(stages 2/3) (TANDEM, NCT03517540) (Table 3) [100]. Patients are randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive TXR 140 μg 
once daily, CVC 150 mg once daily, TXR 140 μg+CVC 150 mg 
once daily, or TXR 90 μg+CVC 150 mg once daily. The study 
comprises a 48-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up. 
The primary objective is evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy compared with the monotherapies over 48 weeks. The secondary objective is efficacy, as defined by a ≥1-point improvement in liver fibrosis versus baseline or resolution of steatohepatitis after 48 weeks. This combination treatment targets the steatotic, inflammatory, and/or fibrotic pathways implicated in NASH.
Selonsertib, firsocostat, and cilofexor 
A recent phase 2 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a 
selonsertib, firsocostat, and cilofexor combination in patients 
with bridging fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis caused by 
NASH (ATLAS, NCT03449446) (Table 3). The primary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of selonsertib, firsocostat, and cilofexor, administered alone or in combination, 
and the changes in liver fibrosis without worsening of NASH. 
The data will be presented in 2020.

Semaglutide, firsocostat, and cilofexor 
In a phase 2 study of the combination of semaglutide, firsocostat, and cilofexor, 109 patients with NASH fibrosis (stages 2/3) 
were randomly assigned to the semaglutide group, semaglutide+firsocostat group, semaglutide+cilofexor 30 mg group, 
semaglutide+cilofexor 100 mg group, or semaglutide+firsocos
tat+cilofexor group (NCT03987074) (Table 3). The primary 
objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study 
drug(s) in adult patients with NASH.
TXR and licogliflozin
Licogliflozin is a once-daily, oral, SGLT1/2 dual inhibitor. A 
phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study is assessing the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
oral TXR and licogliflozin combination therapy, compared to 
the monotherapies, in patients with NASH and liver fibrosis. 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with resolution of NASH and no worsening of fibrosis or improvement 
in fibrosis by at least one stage without worsening of NASH at 
week 48 compared with baseline (ELIVATE, NCT04065841) 
(Table 3).
CONCLUSION
Although vitamin E, pioglitazone, and liraglutide improve liver 
histology, there is a no FDA approved drug for NASH. Therefore, weight loss by lifestyle modification, including diet and 
exercise, is the mainstay of NAFLD treatment. This review 
summarizes the pivotal phase 2 and 3 studies based on the 
mechanisms of action in NASH treatment (Fig. 2). Five pharFig. 2. The classification of phase 2,3 trials based on mechanism of action in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) treatment.

macologic agents—OCA, elafibranor, CVC, resmetirom, and 
aramchol—are under evaluation in large, histology-based 
phase 3 trials. Based on the results of these trials, new and effective drugs for NASH are expected within 2 to 4 years. Several phase 2 trials are ongoing for various agents, including nonbile acid FXR agonists, FGF19 and 21 analogues, GLP-1 RA, 
SGLT2 inhibitors, pan-PPAR agonists, MPC inhibitors, ACC 
inhibitors, and Gal-3 antagonists. Combination treatments are 
also being evaluated. Because NASH is a multifactorial disease, 
drug combinations show therapeutic potential. Finally, future 
treatment strategies will comprise combination treatments and 
precision medicine based on the different phenotypes of 
NASH and treatment response of the individual patient.
