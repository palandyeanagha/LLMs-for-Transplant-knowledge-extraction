Abstract
Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor afecting angiogenesis, oncogenesis, metastasis, and tumor immunity. As a systemic treatment, it has been shown to provide survival benefts in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients progressing on 
sorafenib treatment. We report herein a case of HCC with hepatic vein tumor thrombosis protruding into the inferior vena cava 
(IVC-HVTT) which was successfully treated by surgery following second-line chemotherapy with regorafenib. A 79-year-old 
man with chronic hepatitis was diagnosed with HCC. Computed tomography revealed a solitary tumor in segments 7 and 8 
and an IVC-HVTT from the right hepatic vein. Since IVC-HVTT removal is a difcult procedure, the tumor was diagnosed 
as unresectable, and administration of sorafenib was started. Five weeks later, the lesion had increased in size by 15.3%; 
subsequently, regorafenib was given as second-line therapy for 12 months. After shrinkage of the IVC-HVTT, the patient 
was referred to our hospital for surgery. One month after the cessation of regorafenib, an extended resection of segment 8 
and total removal of the IVC-HVTT was successfully performed without using total hepatic vascular exclusion. There were 
no serious postoperative complications. Additionally, there has been no recurrence for about 2 years since the initial therapy.

Introduction
The treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
is well established by the American Association for the 
Study of Liver Diseases [1] as well as the European Association for the Study of the Liver-European Organization for 
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EASL-EORTC) guidelines [2]. While surgical resection, ablation, or transplantation are potential curative options for early-stage HCC, 
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization is recommended 
for intermediate-stage HCC. Sorafenib is recommended for 
advanced-stage HCC which involves vascular invasion or 
extrahepatic spread [3]. Sorafenib is recognized as the frst 
line of chemotherapy for systemic treatment [3, 4]. However, 
in cases where the efcacy of sorafenib is not confrmed, the 
use of regorafenib as second-line chemotherapy is recommended [4]. Regorafenib has been approved for unresectable/advanced colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal 
tumors [5, 6]. In addition, its efcacy has been demonstrated 
for patients who progressed on sorafenib treatment. In Japan,

insurance covers the treatment of unresectable HCC exacerbated after cancer chemotherapy. However, there have been 
no reports of conversion surgery for HCC performed after 
the use of regorafenib as second-line chemotherapy. We 
report a case of locally advanced unresectable HCC with 
hepatic vein tumor thrombosis protruding to the inferior 
vena cava (IVC-HVTT), which was treated successfully by 
conversion surgery following second-line chemotherapy 
with regorafenib.
Case report
A 79-year-old man with hepatitis B virus-associated chronic 
hepatitis was diagnosed with HCC at his previous clinic. 
Computed tomography (CT) revealed a solitary tumor, 
13 × 9.5 cm in diameter, located in segments 7 and 8. In 
addition, an IVC-HVTT, 18 × 20  mm in diameter, was 
detected from the right hepatic vein (Fig. 1). The tip of the 
tumor thrombosis did not extend beyond the diaphragm but 
occupied the entire IVC lumen. Distant metastasis was not 
observed. Based on the 8th Union for International Cancer Control classifcation of HCC, the tumor was graded as 
T4N0M0 and stage III B. The following tumor markers were 
detected: alpha fetoprotein (3.8 ng/mL) and protein induced 
by vitamin K absence/agonist-II (PIVKA-II) (145,000 mAU/
mL). The patient was diagnosed with unresectable HCC at 
his previous hospital because total hepatic vascular exclusion (THVE) would be necessary for the removal of the IVCHVTT and it was judged technically difcult to perform; in 
addition, the clinical beneft of resection therapy was doubtful. Therefore, administration of sorafenib (800 mg/day) 
was started as frst-line chemotherapy. Lenvatinib was not 
available at that time because it was not covered by insurance. Five weeks of sorafenib administration (total 23.2 g) 
resulted in stable disease (SD) based on the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). However, 
the tumor size had increased by 15.3%, and the PIVKA-II 
levels had increased to 444,000 mAU/mL (Fig. 2). Based 
on these outcomes, sorafenib was judged to be inefective, 
and regorafenib was started as second-line chemotherapy. 
Regorafenib was started at 160 mg; however, grade 3 liver 
dysfunction appeared based on the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0), and this drug was 
withdrawn for 1 week. Thereafter, it was restarted at 40 mg, 
increased to 120 mg, and maintained. It was administered 
for 12 months (total 28.74 g) and resulted in stage III B SD. 
The tumor and IVC-HVTT decreased by 18.6% and 56%, 
respectively (Fig. 3). PIVKA-II levels also decreased from 
the maximum 649,000 mAU/mL to 2420 mAU/mL (Fig. 2). 
Furthermore, CT revealed that 75.4% of the tumor became 
unstructured at the core, and the outcome was evaluated as 
partial response (PR) based on the modifed RECIST (mRECIST) [7]. However, grade 2 anorexia occurred during the 
course of the treatment, and the patient did not wish to continue with the chemotherapy. Therefore, he was referred to 
our hospital for conversion surgical treatment.
At his frst visit to our hospital, the patient’s Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0. 
The preoperative liver-function tests showed the following: 
total bilirubin, 0.5 mg/dL; albumin, 3.4 g/dL; prothrombin test, 1.06 INR; and indocyanine green retention rate 
at 15 min (ICGR15): 32.63%. The Child–Pugh score was 
A with 6 points, and the liver damage score was B. Blood 
tests revealed (1) peripheral white blood-cell count: 5,900/
mm3
, (2) neutrophils: 3670/mm3, (3) platelets: 21.6×103/
mm3, and (4) C-reactive protein: 1.93 mg/dL. One month 
after the cessation of regorafenib, an extended resection of 
segment 8 including partial resection of segments 7 and 1 
and total removal of the IVC-HVTT were performed. An 
intraoperative transesophageal echo was used for monitoring the pulmonary embolism caused by the IVC-HVTT. 
For the removal of the IVC-HVTT, the IVC was clamped 
in half, and the use of THVE was avoided (Fig. 4). The 
duration of the surgery was 318 min and involved 650 mL 
of intraoperative hemorrhage without blood transfusion. 
There were no serious postoperative complications, and 
the patient was discharged on day 16 after the surgery. The 
PIVKA-II level dropped and was within the normal range 
after the operation. The resected specimen had 20% viable 
cancer cells in the main tumor of the liver and 30% in the 
tumor thrombus (Fig. 5). The resected margin of the cut 
surface of the liver did not show any cancer cells, indicative

of potentially curative resection. It has been 2 years since 
the initial therapy, and the patient is surviving with no recurrence for 8 months following the hepatectomy.
Discussion
The incidence of HCC with IVC-HVTT is only about 
1.4% based on Japanese nationwide surveillance [8]. 
Generally, HCC associated with macroscopic vascular 
invasion is regarded as an advanced stage of the disease 
[9]. For patients with HCC accompanied by vascular invasion, embolization, hepatectomy, hepatic arterial infusion 
chemotherapy, and molecular targeted therapy are recommended. Each treatment is selected according to the 
individual situation, i.e., liver function, the condition of 
HCC, and the extent of vascular invasion. Because it is 
currently difcult to provide a universal ranking for these 
four treatments, they are recommended in parallel with 
the treatment for HCC accompanied by vascular invasion 
[10]. For our case, a molecular targeted drug was selected. 
Sorafenib as well as lenvatinib are recommended as the

frst-line therapy for unresectable advanced HCCs; however, only sorafenib could be used at that time. In contrast, following the recent advances in surgical techniques 
and perioperative management, surgical resection for 
IVC-HVTT has been proposed [8]. However, the median 
survival rate after resection is reported to be 1.37 years, 
which is comparable to that following chemotherapy [8]. 
Therefore, instead of straightforward hepatectomy, efective perioperative therapy is recommended in such cases. 
Furthermore, the 90-day mortality rate following resection of HCC with IVC-HVTT is as high as 9.9% [8]. This 
high mortality rate may be related to the use of THVE. 
Although THVE is needed for the resection of liver tumors 
involving IVC [11], it is technically complicated and may 
cause liver damage due to the prolonged ischemia and 
circulatory instability caused by the absence of venous 
return via the IVC [11]. These conditions cause congestion 
of the kidneys and intestine, which may explain why the 
damage and morbidity after THVE are much greater than 
under infow occlusion alone [12]. Therefore, it is better 
to remove the tumor completely without THVE. For these 
reasons, HCC in our patient was diagnosed as unresectable at frst and was treated with sorafenib followed by 
regorafenib. Although regorafenib and ramucirumab are 
recommended as second-line therapy for HCC [13], the 
only regorafenib was available at that time. Following the 
regorafenib treatment, the IVC-HVTT decreased in size, 
eliminating the need for THVE during hepatectomy.
Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks 
the activity of protein kinases involved in angiogenesis, 
oncogenesis, metastasis, and tumor immunity [4]. It also 
induces apoptosis in hepatocytes [14]. Though the pharmacological activity of regorafenib is similar to that of 
sorafenib, the former has been shown to be efective in HCC 
that does not respond to sorafenib treatment [4]. One of the 
underlying mechanisms that account for this diference in 
efcacy is the inhibition of tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor-like homology 
domain 2 (TIE2) activity by regorafenib and not sorafenib 
[15]. TIE2, a receptor expressed on vascular endothelial 
cells, is activated by binding to angiopoietin 2 and contributes to angiogenesis. Furthermore, monocytes expressing 
TIE2 have been reported to have tumor angiogenic activity [16]. The inhibition of TIE2 reduces TIE2-expressing 
monocytes in HCC and angiogenesis [17]. Therefore, the 
sequential use of sorafenib and regorafenib is efective in 
HCC where the infuence of tumor vessel application by 
TIE2 is large.
The median survival in HCC patients treated with 
regorafenib is only 10.6 months [4]. Conversion surgery is 
the next-best strategy to improve the long-term survival in 
these patients. Recent studies have shown that the 5-year 
survival rates after downstaging followed by conversion hepatectomy are comparable to those after primary 
liver resection [18]. One study has reported survival for 
4 years after a multidisciplinary therapy, including frst-line 
sorafenib and subsequent conversion surgery [19]. However, 
there are no reports on conversion surgery after second-line 
chemotherapy using regorafenib for HCC that was initially 
diagnosed as unresectable. According to previous reports 
of hepatectomy after sorafenib, the drug was interrupted for 
7–45 days from hepatectomy and no adverse efects of preoperative administration of sorafenib were observed during 
and immediately after hepatectomy for HCC [19, 20]. Based

on these reports, regorafenib was suspended for 1 month 
before hepatectomy in our case.
Although the tumor could not be downstaged based 
on the RECIST evaluation, tumor size and PIVK-II level 
decreased following regorafenib treatment in our case. Furthermore, after chemotherapy, 75.4% of the tumor became 
unstructured and was evaluated as PR based on mRECIST 
evaluation. In fact, 70–80% of the tumor appeared necrotic 
microscopically. These CT-based morphological changes 
were reported to have a statistically signifcant association 
with pathologic response and overall survival [21]. Although 
the prognosis of HCC patients with IVC-HVTT is poor, in 
patients who respond well to chemotherapy, conversion 
surgery could help to improve their long-term survival. A 
large-scale observational study to evaluate the benefts of 
conversion surgery should, therefore, be considered for such 
patients who respond well to chemotherapy.
In conclusion, we reported a case of locally advanced 
HCC which was treated with conversion surgery after 
regorafenib as second-line chemotherapy. The shrinkage of 
IVC-HVTT by regorafenib treatment was essential for conversion surgery; however, our case may have been uniquely 
suited to this treatment because the intrahepatic HCC was 
solitary and IVC-HVTT extension into the vein was relatively limited. However, multidisciplinary therapy, including 
conversion surgery, may be an efective strategy for treating 
HCC diagnosed as unresectable and for improving long-term 
survival.
