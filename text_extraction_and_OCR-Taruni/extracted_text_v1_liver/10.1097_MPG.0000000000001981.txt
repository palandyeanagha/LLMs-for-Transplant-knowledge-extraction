Abstract
Objectives: To determine the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with liver 
diseases based on a systematical review of the literature.
Method: a literature search according to the PRISMA statement was conducted using 
predefined search terms in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO. The inclusion 
criterion was studies published from 2000 onwards that reported on the 
neurodevelopmental outcomes of term-born children with liver diseases. A narrative 
synthesis was done to appraise the studies.
Results: Twenty-five studies were included (1913 children), 19 of which described 
children after liver transplantation (LTx) (1372 children). 67% of the studies on children 
with liver diseases who survived with their native livers showed low-average or abnormal 
scores on specific subscales of cognitive and behavioral measures. In studies on 
children after LTx, this was 82%. After LTx, 83% of studies demonstrated impaired 
outcomes on behavior, while 42% of children received special education. Motor 
development was impaired in 82% of studies in children with native liver and after LTx. 
Limitations: Studies were heterogenic due to sample sizes, aetiology of liver disease and 
type of assessment tools used.
Conclusions: More than two-third of included studies showed neurodevelopmental 
deficits in children with liver diseases, affecting all neurodevelopmental areas. 
Knowledge on risk factors for impaired neurodevelopment is limited and lack of long 
term follow-up is worrying, especially considering the increasing survival rates, resulting 
in more at risk patients. Studying early predictors and risk factors of abnormal

4
developmental trajectories of children with liver diseases is indicated to assess 
strategies to improve their long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
What is known: 
- Treatment possibilities for children with liver diseases have improved over the last 
decades which has led to increased survival 
- Children with liver disease are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopment 
before and after liver transplantation (LTx)
What is new:
- Children with liver diseases are at increased risk of deficits in all 
neurodevelopmental domains: cognitive, behavioral and motor outcome
- During follow-up of children with liver diseases special attention to
neurodevelopment is warranted
- Relatively little is known on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with liver 
diseases with their native livers compared to children after LTx

Introduction
The structural morphology of the brain is well-established at birth, while vital 
functional maturation continues postnatally.(1) Intellectual functioning and motor 
development develops rapidly during the first years of life and this maturation is 
influenced by neuronal input, such as environmental and experiential factors.(1)
Nevertheless, several pediatric patient groups are known to be at risk of 
neurodevelopmental delays during this period. Early risk factors for neurodevelopmental
delays in children include preterm birth and subsequent intensive neonatal care, 
complications during birth, infections, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, anesthesia, major 
surgery, malnutrition, growth restriction, and environmental deprivation.(2–5) Accordingly, 
severe disease, hospitalization, and surgery during early childhood are also thought to 
interfere with the healthy development of children’s central nervous systems. 
Infants with congenital liver diseases are often exposed to one or more of the 
above risk factors. Previous studies primarily explored the influence of liver 
transplantation (LTx) on neurodevelopmental outcomes.(6–9). The outcomes, however, 
of children with liver diseases prior to LTx might already be impaired due to existing 
morbidities.(3,9,10) To date, the exact interaction or role of risk factors on
neurodevelopment is not yet fully delineated. As survival rates are increasing, it is
essential to explore the possible adverse consequences of early liver diseases, in order 
to grow up to productive, independent young adults.
Our aim was:
- to determine the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with liver diseases 
based on a systematical review of the literature.

6
- to identify neurodevelopmental deficits and related risk factors in children with liver 
diseases, both in children with liver diseases who survived with their native livers 
and after LTx, in order to identify fields of neurodevelopment that are most affected 
and that could possibly benefit from intervention programs at an early stage.

Methods
The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, the international prospective 
register of systematic reviews, under number CRD42016039074. Studies on the 
neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with liver diseases were retrieved from 
PubMed, the Cochrane database, and PsycINFO from January 1, 2000 until March 31, 
2017 and structured literature search was performed according to the PRISMA 
statement. The following predefined search terms were used: infant, newborn, child, 
youth; liver disease, liver failure; cognition disorders, psychomotor disorders, problem 
behavior, neurodevelopment, developmental outcome, learning disorder, IQ, motor 
outcome, neuropsychology, psychomotor, and the different etiologies of liver diseases, 
as described in our research protocol. 
All articles were screened independently and blindly by three authors (LHR, JLB, 
and AEDH). Firstly, one author (LHR) screened all articles on title and abstract. 
Similarly, the other two authors (JLB and AEDH) both blindly screened half of the 
articles. After the initial search, duplicates and articles published before 2000 were 
excluded and articles were screened on title and abstract. In case of a discrepancy the 
three authors discussed the matter until consensus was reached. In addition to the 
articles found through the literature search, the reference lists of the included studies 
were examined to identify possible additional studies eligible for inclusion. 
Inclusion criteria were: studies that reported on liver diseases in childhood and 
described neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with respect to cognition, socialemotional, behavioral and motor functions were included. Only studies that used
standardized tests or validated questionnaires were included. Studies eligible for 

8
inclusion described term-born children aged between 0 and 18 years. Exclusion criteria 
were: articles not written in English, or when they did not match domain, determinant or 
outcome, i.e. when they did not use standardized tests or validated questionnaires.
Studies that did not describe the etiology of liver diseases were also excluded. All types 
of study designs were included, except reviews, case series and case reports on fewer 
than ten cases, abstracts, posters, and books.
A narrative synthesis was conducted and the following data extracted from the
included articles: study design, duration of follow-up, types of liver disease, patient 
characteristics, assessment tools, neurodevelopmental domains, cognitive, behavioral
and motor outcomes, and possible risk factors for neurodevelopmental impairments.
Also, data on school performance was extracted from the articles. In order to obtain a 
clear overview of the differences between studies in children with their native livers and 
studies in children after LTx, these studies were displayed separately. In LTx studies
age at LTx, duration of follow-up after LTx, and whether the donor liver came from a 
living or a deceased donor was also included. 
Table 1 and 2 display information on the included studies: study design; 
participants; etiology of liver disease; used assessment tools; cognitive, behavioral 
and/or motor outcomes and risk factors for impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
When classifying in borderline and abnormal neurodevelopmental scores, included 
studies used cut-off values following the criteria of test manuals (e.g. for the WISC, cutoff values for IQ were < 85 for borderline IQ (-1SD) and < 70 for abnormal IQ (-2SD)).

Results
Figure 1 shows the inclusion chart. After literature search 1276 related 
publications were included. Ultimately, upon analysis of eligibility, 25 papers were 
included amounting to 1913 patients with liver diseases, of whom 541 not-transplanted
and 1372 transplanted children. Table 1 and 2 provide a detailed overview of the 
included studies. 
All studies described neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with liver 
diseases of different underlying etiologies. Nineteen of these studies were on children 
after LTx. The children who participated in the various studies represented a 
heterogeneous group of liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis, metabolic etiologies, 
biliary atresia, and liver tumors. The number of patients varied between 11 and 823 
children. Control groups were used in 11 studies.
All of the used test batteries and questionnaires were validated and internationally 
accepted. There was a high diversity in used test batteries and questionnaires, all 
displayed in Table 1 and 2. To assess cognition, mostly used were versions of the 
Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WISC), i.e. in 14/23 studies, according to different age 
categories. For behavioral outcome and executive function the following assessments 
were predominantly used: Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in 4/13 studies and Behavior 
Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) in 6/13 studies respectively. Motor 
outcome was assessed with Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) in both studies 
assessing motor outcomes in children with native liver disease. In children after LTx, the 
most used test was the movement ABC. 

10
The neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with liver diseases who still had their 
native livers
Table 1 provides an overview of the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children 
with liver disease who still had their native livers. In children with viral hepatitis and 
hepatic encephalopathy due to acute liver failure, significantly lower scores on cognition 
tests were observed, both in acute and under more chronic conditions (IQ (mean ± SD) 
61.8 ± 13.6 in children with chronic viral hepatitis vs 106.2 ± 12.8 in controls).(11,12)
The results of children with acute liver failure normalized during follow-up, approximately 
five months after discharge, when the hepatic encephalopathy resolved.(11) Children 
suffering from chronic viral hepatitis, with normal liver function tests, obtained lower 
scores on vocabulary, total verbal relation, the bead memory test, total short-term 
memory, and IQ, in comparison to healthy controls.(12) In other studies, children with 
viral hepatitis showed neither impaired outcomes on cognitive tests, nor differences in 
behavioral outcomes in comparison to the norm population or uninfected controls (i.e. IQ 
mean 103.9).(13,14)
In children with biliary atresia (BA), who were being evaluated for LTx, lower 
scores on cognitive outcomes were reported in comparison to the norm population
(visual reception 89.90 ± 8.42, expressive language 90.60 ± 19.91, receptive language 
79.90 ± 13.25 compared to norm scores with a mean of 100).(10,15) Motor development 
was also impaired in children with BA (gross motor 71.80 ± 13.14, fine motor 94.53 ±
19.80 compared to norm scores with a mean of 100).(10,15) Thus far, no studies have 
been published on behavioral outcomes in children with BA, without LTx. 
School performance (% special education or repeated classes) was not reported 
in studies on children with liver diseases who still had their native livers.

11
The neurodevelopmental outcomes of children after liver transplantation
Table 2 provides an overview of the studies on the neurodevelopmental 
outcomes of children with liver diseases after LTx. In most studies on children after LTx, 
intelligence scores were below the average of the norm population, but still fell within the 
average range (i.e. FSIQ 86.6-98).(9,16–24) Kaller and colleagues found that all scores 
on cognition abilities fell in the low-average range in children at least one year after LTx. 
Almost 10% of these children had an abnormal total IQ (<70) in comparison to 4.7% of 
their healthy peers. Furthermore, 16% of children with liver diseases scored within the 
borderline IQ range (70-84) in comparison to 6% of their healthy peers.(18) In the 
subcategories of the cognitive tests, such as attention abilities, executive functioning, 
visuospatial functioning, and language development, the mean scores fell within the 
average range, but below the population mean (Table 1 and 2).(6–
8,15,17,19,20,23,25,26) Moreover, Sorensen and colleagues found no improvement in 
cognition after LTx, only reading was likely to improve.(20) Stevenson and colleagues
found, in their longitudinal cohort, impaired cognitive outcomes pre-LTx and a significant 
decrease at three months post-LTx.(9) At one year post-LTx the scores had returned to 
the pre-LTx level with no further improvement at two years after LTx.(9)
Children receiving LTx for liver diseases showed more total behavioral (12%
borderline scores, 32-50% abnormal) and externalizing problems (4-31.2% borderline 
scores, 32-31.2% abnormal) in comparison to the norm population or in comparison to 
children with stable chronic liver diseases.(7,19,27)
Motor outcomes were impaired in children with LTx in comparison to healthy 
children.(6,28) Almaas and colleagues found in their longitudinal cohort with 4 year 
follow-up no improvement in motor scores with time after transplantation.(28) In contrast, 

12
Van Mourik and colleagues found that individual motor scores improved gradually after 
LTx and reached the average range within four years after LTx.(29) In metabolic 
patients, psychomotor functions were delayed at -2 SD before transplantation.(9) The 
scores of patients who had received a transplant at less than 42 months of age, 
improved over 2 years of time to the low-average range.(9)
School performance was reported in 8/19 studies on children with liver disease 
and LTx. Of included children, up to 42% needed special education and 6-55% had 
repeated one or more classes at school (Table 2).(8,9,16,19,22,23,30,31)
Children with liver diseases before or after LTx show impairments on all domains 
of neurodevelopment in comparison to the general pediatric population. Although the 
mean subscores often fall within the average range, the shift in distribution to lower 
scores implies that a larger fraction of children have abnormal scores at individual level.

13
Risk factors associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes
In Table 1 and 2 an overview is provided of risk factors for neurodevelopmental 
impairments in children with liver diseases. Cognitive outcomes in children with liver 
diseases before and after LTx were negatively correlated with low weight and height zscores at the time of surgery (Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy or LTx) (8,10,15,20,21,26), 
age at LTx, blood transfusion volume during LTx, days spent in hospital less than one
year post-LTx, and number of pre-LTx, peri-LTx, and post-LTx complications.
(7,8,17,20,26) Also, in a multi-center study, one-person households were associated 
with impaired cognitive outcomes.(20) Some studies performed multiple regression 
analysis and reported higher scores on late postoperative (between three and ten years) 
achievement scales in patients who had a living-related donor in comparison to a 
cadaveric organ.(8,26) In children with viral hepatitis and hepatic encephalopathy due to 
acute liver failure, cognitive test results were negatively correlated to elevated blood proinflammatory cytokines and liver changes on MRI.(11,12) Furthermore, more impaired 
scores on cognition were reported in children after LTx for genetic-metabolic induced 
liver disease in comparison to children after LTx with BA or other cholestatic diseases, 
both before LTx and during follow-up.(9,18,21)
Risk factors for impaired motor outcomes in children with liver diseases were 
impaired nutritional status peri-LTx, shorter disease period before LTx, and LTx at older 
ages. (23,29)
Concerning school performance, the most striking risk factor for special education 
post-LTx was requirement for special education pre-LTx.(31) Use of calcineurin 
inhibitors or cyclosporine/other non-calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppression was 
associated with impaired scores on cognition and special education.(21,31)

Discussion
The aim of this systematic review, executed in accordance to the PRISMA 
guidelines, was to provide an overview of the current literature on the 
neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with liver diseases who still had their native 
livers and/or after LTx and to identify possible risk factors for impaired outcomes. The 
treatment possibilities of children with liver diseases have improved significantly over the 
last decades and survival rates are increasing, making it a chronic rather than a fatal 
disease. It is therefore essential to gain insight into the long-term sequel of liver 
diseases in childhood. 
All studies reported deficits in one or more areas, be it in the cognitive, motor, or 
behavioral domains. The majority of the studies reported cognitive deficits in children 
with liver diseases with their native livers (4/6 studies; 67%) and in children after LTx
(14/17 studies; 82%). In children with their native livers, as well as after LTx, low IQ
scores were the most predominant outcome. All studies in children surviving with their 
native livers, and most studies including children after LTx, showed low-average and 
significantly abnormal scores on subscales of cognitive and behavioral measures. Also,
a remarkable percentage of children after LTx received special education or had already 
repeated one or more classes (up to 42%). Of nine studies describing motor outcomes, 
seven described impairments in one or more subtests of motor development (82%). The 
two other studies described average scores on motor development, with slightly higher
scores in children with native livers compared to children after LTx.(24) Remarkably, 
there are more studies on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with LTx compared 
to children with liver diseases who still had their native livers. There is little to no data on 

15
behavioral outcomes nor on school performance of children with liver diseases who still 
had their native liver. 
Factors that appeared to be associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes were 
variable to some extent. The impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with 
liver diseases without LTx or before LTx suggest that a liver disease itself influences 
neurodevelopment, which might or might not be aggravated by surgical therapy and its 
sequelae. Gilmour et al. showed that children at highest risk for special education postLTx were those who already received special education pre-LTx or those who were too 
young and not yet in school at time of LTx. This suggests that neurodevelopmental 
deficits were, to some extent, already present before LTx. Etiology of liver diseases
plays an important role in neurodevelopmental impairment. Cognitive outcomes were 
more impaired in children with metabolic disorders than in children with BA or other 
cholestatic diseases. We have to bear in mind that in some liver diseases, for example,
the metabolic induced liver diseases, impaired neurodevelopment might be explained by 
brain damage due to the underlying disease. Poor adherence to therapy could also 
influence neurodevelopmental outcome in certain liver diseases.(21) In some children 
with liver failure, either acute or chronic, the neurodevelopmental deficits recovered 
following adequate treatment and LTx.(11) This is in line with previous studies that 
reported improvement in neurodevelopment after LTx.(3,32) Results on whether motor 
outcomes improved over time after LTx were inconsistent; two studies showed 
improvement after LTx and one study did not.(9,28,29)
Other studies showed that LTx itself is an important contributory factor to
neurodevelopmental impairment.(19,24,27) Nevertheless, Stevenson and colleagues
showed that negative effects of LTx on neurodevelopment can be reversible within one

16
year after LTx.(9) The factor most associated with neurodevelopmental outcome was 
growth failure at the time of LTx. Growth failure might be caused by malnutrition which, 
in early childhood, is associated with dendritic spine abnormalities, short apical 
dendrites, fewer spines and altered neurotransmitter function and responsiveness.(33)
Recently Lurz et al. showed that children with end-stage liver disease had a significantly 
lower psoas muscle surface area when compared to age-matched healthy controls. This 
suggests an impaired nutritional status in children with end stage liver disease.(34)
Improved nutritional status peri-LTx was associated with increased muscle bulk and 
subsequent improvement in motor scores.(29) Based on current data, nutrition seems to 
be the only risk factor amenable to a short-term potential intervention to improve 
neurodevelopmental outcome. 
The effect of general anesthesia in early childhood on neurodevelopment is still 
unclear. Numerous cohort studies found conflicting evidence for an association between 
exposure to general anesthesia and neurodevelopmental outcomes.(35–37) To the best 
of our knowledge the association between general anesthesia and neurodevelopmental 
outcome in children with liver diseases has not been investigated yet. Furthermore, 
exposure to general anesthesia was not found as a risk factor for impaired 
neurodevelopmental outcome in the included articles of this review. 
In one of the multi-center cohort studies, Gilmour et al. showed that both 
treatment with calcineurin inhibitors and with non-calcineurin inhibitors post-LTx was 
associated with impaired cognitive outcomes and special education.(21,31) Calcineurin 
inhibitors and non-calcineurin inhibitors, as well as exposure to steroids at young age, 
are known for its neurotoxicity.(38–40) More research is needed to explore the potential 
risk of immunosuppressive regimens post-LTX for neurodevelopmental impairments. 

17
Other factors associated with impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes concerning 
LTx were younger age at LTx and longer duration of hospitalization. Studies on children
with BA showed that younger age at LTx is associated with better cognitive 
development. (8,10,15,18,23,26) This might be due to a better nutritional status and 
growth, shorter exposure to the liver disease and earlier normalization of toxic liver 
values after transplantation at a younger age, possibly also at an age period in which the 
brain has higher plasticity to adapt. Other studies showed that children who underwent 
transplantation in the first six months after birth have more impaired neurodevelopmental 
outcomes in comparison to controls or the norm population.(3,17,41) The children who 
underwent LTx before the age of six months are predominantly children with BA with 
insufficient therapeutic effects of hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai procedure) 
necessitating LTx at this young age. It is tempting to speculate that the worse outcomes 
in these children are due to the underlying liver disease and not to the surgical 
intervention per se.
Our conclusion is that this review shows that children with liver diseases are 
prone to neurodevelopmental impairments. The studies included in this review show that 
children with liver diseases are at risk of deficits in all areas of neurodevelopment, i.e.
cognition, behavior, and motor development. Even though the mean scores 
predominantly fall within the average range, most scores are lower than scores in the 
norm population or control groups. Moreover, it is obvious that a remarkably larger
number of children have abnormal scores on neurodevelopment when compared to 
control groups or norm population. The limited number of studies in this field suggests
that this population is struggling in growing up to productive, independent young adults. 
It might be that both adequate medical and/or surgical treatment of liver diseases and 

18
more ‘aggressive’ nutritional management contribute to better neurodevelopmental 
outcomes. Both are of great practical importance in the day-to-day lives of children and
their families who experience many problems because of neurodevelopmental 
impairments. Furthermore, the findings emphasize that special attention to 
neurodevelopmental sequelae in children with liver diseases needs to be given during 
follow-up and possible intervention programs with neuropsychologists, physiotherapists,
and rehabilitation consultants are warranted. Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate 
neurodevelopmental outcomes in homogenous groups of adequate sample sizes, as 
pediatric liver diseases are (relatively) rare. In consequence, the knowledge gap is 
worrying, especially when one takes into consideration that survival rates are improving 
and that as a consequence the number of at-risk patients is increasing. We believe that 
this patient group might benefit from intervention programs in analogy to preterm infants. 
Previous research in preterm born infants has shown the benefits of an early 
intervention program to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.(42,43) However, liver 
disease often is a more chronic condition. Research is needed to explore the potential 
benefits of neurodevelopmental intervention programs to improve long-term outcomes in 
children with liver disease. This systematic review forms the basis for a prospective 
study that should provide more insight into the steps that have to be taken to improve 
neurodevelopmental outcome in children with liver diseases.
Limitations
Even though there was a reasonable overlap in the findings of the studies 
described in this review, there were notable differences too. These differences are 
probably due to the heterogeneity of the studies and in the types of liver diseases. 

19
Sample sizes in the majority of the studies were small. Due to the nature of retrospective 
cohort studies, confounders may have biased results on risk factors of deficits. As 
presented in Table 1 and 2, studies were highly divergent with respect to: 
1. Target population, in sense of age of patients (0-18 years) and etiology of liver 
diseases (over 30 different etiologies). 
2. Measurement of outcomes, i.e. 28 different test batteries and questionnaires were 
used to measure cognition, behavior and/or motor outcome. 
Given these differences in applied design and methods, the outcome per each outcome 
(cognition, behavior and motor outcome) from one study may not be the same as in the 
other included studies. This hinders comparability of results across studies and hence a 
meaningful statistical analysis of combined results becomes infeasible. Well-designed 
randomized controlled trials are essential for more reliable results. 
Future implications 
We conclude that children with liver diseases are at increased risk of deficits in 
one or more areas of neurodevelopment be it in the cognitive, motor, or behavioral
domains. In our opinion, adequate long-term follow-up studies to investigate the 
developmental trajectories of children with liver diseases are urgently required. Future 
research is necessary to determine early predictors and risk factors, and to explore the 
possibilities with regard to interventions that could eventually improve the long-term 
neurodevelopmental outcomes in order to support these vulnerable patients in growing 
up to productive, independent young adults.
