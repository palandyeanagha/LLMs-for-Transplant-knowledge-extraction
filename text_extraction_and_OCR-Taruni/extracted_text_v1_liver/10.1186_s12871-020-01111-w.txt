Abstract
Background: Whether anesthesia type is associated with the surgical outcome of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
patients with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) remains to be determined. This study aims to investigate the
impact of volatile inhalational anesthesia (INHA) versus total IV anesthesia (TIVA) on the survival outcomes in HCC
patients with PVTT.
Methods: A cohort of in-patients whom were diagnosed of HCC with PVTT in Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery
Hospital, Shanghai, China, from January 1, 2008 to December 24, 2012 were identified. Surgical patients receiving
the INHA and TIVA were screened out. The overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and several
postoperative adverse events were compared according to anesthesia types.
Results: A total of 1513 patients were included in this study. After exclusions are applied, 263 patients remain in
the INHA group and 208 in the TIVA group. Patients receiving INHA have a lower 5-year overall survival rate than
that of patients receiving TIVA [12.6% (95% CI, 9.0 to 17.3) vs. 17.7% (95% CI, 11.3 to 20.8), P = 0.024]. Results of
multivariable Cox-regression analysis also identify that INHA anesthesia is significantly associated with mortality and
cancer recurrence after surgery compare to TIVA, with HR (95%CI) of 1.303 (1.065, 1.595) and 1.265 (1.040, 1.539),
respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that in more severe cancer patients, the worse outcome related to INHA
might be more significant.
Conclusion: This retrospective analysis identifies that TIVA is associated with better outcomes compared with INHA.
Future prospective studies clinical and translational studies are required to verify this difference and investigate
underlying pathophysiology.

Background
Volatile inhalational (INHA) and IV anesthesia (TIVA)
are two methods commonly used in general anesthesia
maintenance. Currently, several researches reported that
INHA was associated with worse postoperative outcomes compare to INHA in certain types of cancers. Dr.
Wigmore et al. [1] did a retrospective analysis which
firstly compared long-term survival in more than 7000
patients undergoing elective cancer surgeries, and reported that mortality of patients accepted INHA is approximately 50% greater than those accepted TIVA.
Since then, more studies reported similar results in different cancers [2]. Besides from these clinical evidences,
animal researches also reported that administration of
volatile inhalational agents was associated with upregulation of tumorigenic growth factors including
hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and insulin-like growth
factor (IGF) [3, 4], which are highly associated with progression angiogenesis and cell proliferation in tumor.
Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear,
these results have drawn due attention that anesthesia
technique might be an independent risk factor for postoperative outcomes of most cancers, including liver cancer. Of note, previous studies also reported that the
MAC of sevoflurane is lower in patients with end-stage
liver cancer [5]. Thus, we hypothesize that INHA might
be associated with lower 5-year overall survival (OS)
compared with TIVA in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) patients with portal vein tumor thrombus
(PVTT), an end-stage liver cancer with a high recurrence
rate and reduced median survival time (MST) [6–9], in
considering that in these end stage cancer patients, even
subtle differences in medication might lead to significant
effects on long-term outcome.
Methods
Study design
We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent
aggressive surgical liver resection for selected HCC patients with PVTT at Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital from January 1, 2008 to December 24, 2012.
Exclusion criteria including: (1) no surgical treatment
performed; (2) received mixed inhalational and intravenous anesthesia; (3) received additional procedures with
different anesthesia or for other diseases afterwards; (4)
received extra sedation in ICU or in general ward after
surgery; (5) less than 18 years old; (6) had an urgent or
emergence surgery and (7) incomplete follow-up data.
The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgical Hospital of China.
Written informed consents to record clinical follow up
data were obtained from participants or their surrogates
during hospitalization.
Baseline data retrospectively extracted including
anesthetic technique, year of surgery, age at the time
of surgery, sex, American Society of anesthesiologists’
(ASA) physical status classification, pre-existing diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension, HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HCV anti-body (HCV-ab). Data
related to patients’ preoperative liver function, cytonecrosis and cancer statue were also documented, including Child-Pugh score, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),
type of PVTT, tumor diameter as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) levels.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was 5-year OS. Secondary outcomes were (1) recurrence-free survival (RFS); (2) 30-
day mortality; (3) a set of major adverse cardiac
events (MACE) that included myocardial infarction
(MI), cardiac arrest, or newly diagnosed malignant
arrhythmia; (4) multiple organ dysfunction (MOD)
primarily induced of acute hepatic failure postoperatively; (5) blood loss and blood transfusion; (6) hospital length of stay (7) postoperative ALT and AST
were also recorded.
Anesthesia techniques
Patients were divided based on INHA or TIVA they
received for maintenance of anesthesia. Patients in
the TIVA group received continuous infusions of propofol, and those in the INHA group received sevoflurane. Supplementary opioid for maintaining were
used at the discretion of the anesthetist in all patients, including sufentanil and/or remifentanil, with
the highest dose no more than 50 mg and 2 mg, respectively. No other sedative-hypnotic drugs were
used during maintenance.
Type of anesthesia was according to the anesthetist’s
decision, mainly depending on their preference and proficiency of the anesthesia technique. Details of the surgical process as previously described [10].
Statistical analyses
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate the
overall survival and recurrence-free survival of patients
from the date of surgery to the date of events. A univariable Cox regression analysis was applied, and for variables with P less than 0.1 were then included into the
multivariable model to identify risk factors.
Secondary outcomes were compared using chisquare or Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests as appropriate. Missing values (all less than 5%) were filled by
the average value of the variable. Significant difference
defined as P < 0.05 in all analysis (SPSS version 22.0;
IBM Inc., USA).

Results
Baseline characters and survival for all patients
A total of 1523 patients whom are diagnosed of HCC
with PVTT are delivered in the study period. After
exclusions applied, 471 patients are included in the
analysis, with 263 patients in the INHA group and
208 in the TIVA (Fig. 1). The mean age is 48.6 years
old; The majority of patients are male (90.6%), had a
grade of ASA II (88.3%) and Child-Pugh A (88.4%);
410 (87.0%) of patients have large hepatocellular carcinoma (> 10 cm).; 408 (86.6%) are identified with
HBsAg−+, including 4 with both HBsAg− + and HCVab+. Only 4 patients are identified with HCV-ab− +
alone, which is not enough for effective analysis. Fiveyear survival rate for all patients is 14.8% (95% CI,
11.3 to 17.6), with median survival time of 9.0 month
(95% CI, 7.9 to 10.0). The patient characteristics in
two groups are described in Table 1.
Five-year OS and RFS
Results of Kaplan–Meier survival analysis show that,
compare with TIVA, INHA is associated with a worse 5-
year OS rate [17.7% (95% CI, 11.3 to 20.8 VS. 12.6%
(95% CI, 9.0 to 17.3)); P = 0.024, Fig. 2a], as well as a
worse 5-year RFS rate[15.4% (95% CI, 12.6 to 18.1) VS.
11.7% (95% CI, 9.7 to 13.8); P = 0.032, Fig. 2b]. On univariable analysis, 6 potential risk factors have P < 0.1 are
included in multivariable model (Supplementary table
1). Results of multivariable analysis also suggest that
INHA is an independent risk factor for mortality [HR
(95%CI), 1.303 (1.065, 1.595)] and cancer recurrence
[HR (95% CI), 1.265 (1.040, 1.539); Table 2] in 5 years
after surgery.
Other secondary outcomes
Other outcomes including 30-day mortality rate, postoperative MACE and MOF rate, as well as blood loss,
blood transfusion and length of stay in hospital are similar in both groups (Table 3). Postoperative serum biomarker of ALT and AST are compared (with incomplete
data), the results suggest a minor liver cytonecrosis of
TIVA after surgery (Supplementary Figure 1).
Subgroup analysis
In multivariable model, four more variables are screened
out as independent risk factors for 5-year OS and RFS:
Child-Pugh, AFP level, diameter of hepatocellular carcinoma and PVTT type. We then did a subgroup

Kaplan–Meier survival analysis to estimate the association of anesthesia type on postoperative OS and RFS in
different sub-variable groups, there were Child-Pugh A;
Child-Pugh B&C; tumor diameter < 10 cm; tumor
diameter ≥ 10 cm; AFP < 400μg/L; AFP ≥ 400μg/L; PVTT
typeI; PVTT typeII; PVTT typeIII (Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6).
The results suggest that INHA was associated with significant lower OS and RFS rate compare with TIVA in
several sub-variable groups indicating more severe liver
cancer status, including tumor diameter ≥ 10 cm (Fig. 4b,
d); AFP ≥ 400μg/L (Fig. 5b, d); PVTT typeIIand PVTT
typeIII (Fig. 6c, e, f).
Discussion
This retrospective analysis evaluates long-term OS,
RFS and several short-term postoperative adverse
events in 1513 HCC patients with PVTT receiving
INHA and TIVA. We identify that patients receiving
INHA using sevoflurane had a lower 5-year OS and
RFS rate than that of patients receiving TIVA using
propofol. On multivariable Cox regression analysis,
we identify that INHA is an independent risk factor
for mortality and cancer recurrence in 5-year after
surgery. In subgroup analysis, our results suggest that
patients accepted INHA, compare with those who accepted TIVA, have worse survival rates when there
are in severe liver cancer status. No significant differences in postoperative adverse events and 30-day
mortality are found between the two groups in this
study.
Clinical evidence of anesthesia type on surgical outcomes
Recently, several clinical studies have been investigated for anesthesia type on postoperative outcomes
in elective cancer patients. Enlund et al. [6] did a
retrospective analysis based on 2838 patients with
breast, rectal, and colon cancer, they reported that
the overall survival for patients receiving propofol
anesthesia is 4.7% higher at 1-yr and 5.6% higher at
5-yr than those receiving sevoflurane. But after balance for confounders, this differences are not significant. In another study, Wigmore et al. [1] analyzed
7030 patients who underwent elective cancer surgery
over a 3-yr period, They reported a worse outcome in
patients receiving volatile anesthesia, with a HR of
1.46 (95% CI, 1.29 to 1.66) for death, compare with
TIVA. In addition, Yan et al. [7]. designed a randomized controlled trail in 80 breast cancer patients, they
reported that the total intravenous anesthesia can inhibit the release of vascular endothelial growth factor
C (VEGF-C) in breast surgery, yet with no significant
benefice in the short-term recurrence rate of breast
cancer. Importantly, a recent meta-analysis with 9
retrospective studies and 1 RCT concluded that, the
use of TIVA was associated with improved RFS in all
cancer types and improved OS in several certain types
of cancers [2]. These studies have achieved consistent
results that TIVA anesthesia has a better long-term

prognosis for patients undergoing tumor resection
compared with INHA. However, the population these
studies enrolled varies a lot. Yet meaningful conclusions on whether TIVA is superior to INHA for all
cancer patients or just for certain types of cancer are
difficult to define. To this end, the current study sort
to compare the long-term survival rate in TIVA and
INHA in HCC patients with PVTT.
Laboratory evidence of anesthetics on tumors metastasis
and recurrence
Over the years, numerous animal and laboratory studies have been investigated for the mechanism of
anesthetic agents on primary tumors metastasis and
recurrence. Cellular immune system and tumor
proliferation-associated factors are considered to play
a key role in it. For instance, propofol has been demonstrated to have a preservation effective on T
lymphocyte activity and Th1 cytokine secretion, or
even inhibits tumor growth in animal model [8, 9,
11]. Of note, T lymphocytes and NK cells are two
major cytotoxic effector cells that participate in cellmediated immune responses. Meanwhile, researches
also proved that sevoflurane could inhibit primary
leukocyte integrin lymphocyte function and could induced lymphocyte apoptosis through downregulation
of Lymphocyte Function-associated Antigen 1 (LFA1), thus promoting tumor recurrence and metastasis
[12]. Moreover, studies both in vivo [13] and in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery [14] have reported an inhibitory effect of anesthetic agents on
natural killer cell function, and further promotes
tumor recurrence. This inhibitory effect is probably
related to the dysfunction in CD16 cell and CD107α
NK receptor after exposure to sevoflurane [15]. More
recently, Bellanti et al. [16] demonstrated that

propofol, but not sevoflurane, prevents mitochondrial
dysfunction and oxidative stress by limiting hypoxiainducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) activation in hepatic
ischemia/reperfusion injury. According to their description, this change could be beneficial for liver
function, as HIF-1α governs the transcription of genes
controlling proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells
[17, 18]. Additionally, previous researches already
demonstrate that isoflurane administration could result in an up-regulation of HIF-1α in tumor [19].
However, there have no solid evidence to prove those
theory in human body, while the molecular
mechanisms of the different outcomes of the two
anesthetic methods remains to be determined yet.
HCC with PVTT
HCC ranges as the fifth most common malignancy
tumor [20]. Indeed, even worse prognosis is reported
in HCC patients with PVTT, with a reported rate of
20% and a reduced median survival time (MST) of
around 2–4 months compared to HCC patients without PVTT [21–24]. According to the Asia-Pacific
guideline, surgery is recommended as one of the
beneficial multidisciplinary treatments for PVTT.

Moreover, aggressive surgical resection is associated
with a longer survival outcome, and even provide
chances for complete cure with type I and II PVTT
[10, 25]. Meanwhile, recent studies reported that
under advanced perioperative management and skilled
surgical operation, the in-hospital mortality of HCC
patients with PVTT arrives an acceptable rate ranging
from 3.7 to 10% [26, 27]. However, the knowledge
about risk factors for postoperative mortality, cancer
recurrence and other side events of HCC patients
with PVTT still remains insufficient. Our result provides with extra evidence that anesthesia type might
be a risk factor for surgical outcomes of HCC patients with PVTT.
Limitations
Several methodological discrepancies and limitations
of this study should be discussed. First, there might
be inclusion bias exist in our cohort, as more than a
thousand patients were excluded with only 471 enrolled. Meanwhile, the majority of included patients
are male, with ASA score of II, Child-Pugh score of
A, and tumor size over 10 cm. Second, certain clinical
data of treatment are not collected, including perioperative chemoradiotherapy, detailed surgical techniques, and usage of opioids during surgery. Opioids
have been reported to have an effect on tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis, as well as on tumor
recurrence and metastasis. However, it’s hard to

accurately record and compare total amounts of opioid used in both groups during surgery, as they were
administered both continuously or intermittently. In
this study all patients accepted at least one of remifentanil or sufentanil treatment in standard dose. Besides, since this is a retrospective analysis based
clinical records and follow up data, the reason for the
choice of anesthesia type at that time point, as well
as potential factors affecting this choice, are not recorded or balanced. Thus, prospective researches with
rigorous study design and large sample size on this
field are in urgent need.
In conclusion, this retrospective analysis of longterm outcomes identifies that INHA is associated with
worse survival rate compare with TIVA, and the
choice of anesthesia type might be an independent
risk factor for survival of HCC patients with PVTT.
For some sub-variable groups (including PVTT type I,
Child-puge B&C, tumor diameter < 10 cm, AFP <
400μg/L) there was no difference in outcomes between TIVA and INHA. Future prospective researches
are urgent to verify this difference and figure out
underlying causes of it.
