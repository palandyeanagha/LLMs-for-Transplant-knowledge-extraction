Light chain amyloidosis: the heart of the problem

n this issue of Haematologica, Dinner et al. report the
outcome of a pilot study of an oral regimen of lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone and low-dose
melphalan in 25 patients with light chain amyloidosis (AL),
most of them with cardiac involvement.
1 The treatment
proved to be toxic and unable to improve survival in
patients with advanced amyloid cardiomyopathy and poor
performance status. High rates of early cardiac deaths
(42%) and of cardiac arrhythmias (33%), probably triggered
by high-dose dexamethasone, drug myelotoxicity limiting
the duration of treatment to 3 cycles, and a mere 9% cardiac response rate, contributed to a highly disappointing
median overall survival of 1.75 months in patients with latestage heart damage. The outcome of this study highlights
the urgent need for novel approaches in order to improve
the prospects of AL amyloidosis patients with advanced
cardiomyopathy.
Light chain amyloidosis is the most common systemic
amyloidosis, with an incidence of 10 patients per million
per year, resulting in approximately 5,000 new
patients/year in the European Union. It is sustained by a
usually small, indolent, plasma cell clone whose biological
features, shared by less proliferative plasma cell dyscrasias,
make it more sensitive to chemotherapy. The clonal plasma
cells synthesize an excess of light chains (LC) with specific
mutations and unique structural features causing systemic
proteotoxicity. Interactions of the misfolded LCs with cells,
extracellular matrix components and other constituents
commonly found in amyloid deposits, such as serum amyloid P (SAP), and other molecules, play an important role in
the disease process and are potential targets for therapy. AL
amyloidosis is also the most severe systemic amyloidosis
because over 70% of patients present with cardiac involvement, which results in the development of rapidly progres-

sive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias and over 50%
mortality within one year.
2 The incidence of cardiac
involvement continues to rise, owing to increasingly effective detection.
3 Advanced echocardiographic techniques,
such as tissue Doppler and strain imaging, allow the identification of early, subtle changes and provide prognostic
information. Cardiac magnetic resonance proves useful in
diagnosing and possibly monitoring amyloid deposits.
Cardiac scintigraphy with bone tracers helps differentiate
AL from non-AL (hereditary, senile) amyloidosis.
The molecular mechanisms involved in amyloid cardiac
damage are the subject of intensive investigation. A substantial body of experimental evidence has recently altered
the hypothesis underlying the etiology of AL cardiomyopathy, shifting it from a disease of simple passive amyloid
infiltration to one in which the direct cardiotoxic effects of
amyloidogenic LC proteins play a critical role. Previous and
recent research have demonstrated that AL-LC precursor
proteins, independent of cardiac fibril formation and passive restriction of cardiac function, trigger a direct cardiotoxic response causing impaired cardiomyocyte function
in vitro.
4,5 More recently, it has been shown that injection of
amyloid LC causes cardiac dysfunction and early death in
zebrafish.
6 The toxic effect of the LC described in these
model systems is supported by clinical observations that
cardiac stress, as measured by circulating levels of type B
natriuretic peptides (BNP or NT-proBNP) may be reduced in
parallel with the reduction in free LC (FLC) levels following
chemotherapy and such reductions translate in improved
survival.
7 The extent of cardiac damage, staged using the
cardiac biomarkers NT-proBNP and troponins8 is a powerful predictor of survival, and the burden of the amyloid LC
also has a significant impact on outcome.
9 It is, therefore,
vital to promptly reduce the concentration of cardiotoxic
LCs.
Two studies reported the use of the same oral regimen of
lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone and
melphalan described in the current study by Dinner et al.
1
Moreau et al., in 26 patients (12 of whom were in cardiac
stage II or III), reported a 58% hematologic response rate,
with 40% cardiac response, and 81% survival at two
years.
10 Sanchorawala et al. reported a 44% hematologic
response rate (no cardiac response) with significant toxicity
and a 19% mortality in the first three months in a series
including 69% of patients with heart involvement, 81% of
whom were in cardiac stage II and III.
11 These discordant
outcomes depend on the variable percentage and severity of
cardiac involvement in the patient populations. A recent
European collaborative study analyzed treatment outcomes
of 346 patients with cardiac stage III AL amyloidosis from
the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Greece.
12 The
results show that cardiac stage III AL amyloidosis is actually
a heterogeneous disease, comprising both patients with less
advanced cardiac damage, in whom response to therapy
conferred survival improvement dependent on the depth of
hematologic response, and patients with severe amyloid
cardiomyopathy (characterized by extreme elevation of
NT-proBNP above 8500 ng/L and systolic blood pressure
<100 mm Hg) who die within a few weeks. Several studies
evaluated the efficacy of front-line conventional and novel
therapies in patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy.
However, most of them were retrospective and some were
performed before cardiac risk stratification was available,
making them hardly comparable and prevented solid conclusions being drawn. Thus, we focused our analysis on the
studies reporting cardiac staging and including only patients
treated frontline (Table 1). The outcome of these studies is
invariably dismal, with 20-40% early mortality rates, median survival ranging from 5 to 17 months depending on the
proportion of patients with severe heart failure. The overall

response rates seem almost unaffected by the addition of
novel agents, although bortezomib combinations probably
give a higher rate of complete response that may translate
into better cardiac outcome.
12 Improvement of cardiac function is infrequent, being observed in less than 20% of cases.
Collectively these data indicate that current therapy for
patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy is largely unsatisfactory and calls for better approaches. As reported in the
European collaborative study, patients with less advanced
cardiac damage tolerate chemotherapy better and are significantly more likely to respond to treatment.
12 In addition,
patients with early heart involvement and only moderately
elevated cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP < 5000 ng/L and
troponin T < 0.06 μg/L) can safely undergo autologous stem
cell transplantation (ASCT)
13 with satisfactory outcomes.14
These findings highlight the critical importance of early
detection of amyloid cardiomyopathy. Furthermore,
although the survival of patients with AL amyloidosis has
been significantly improved over the last two decades by
effective regimens and novel agents,
15,16 the 25-30% rate of
early deaths (within one year of diagnosis), almost invariably cardiac, still represents the major impediment for further improvements in survival. Investigators involved in the
care of patients with AL amyloidosis have deployed several
lines of intervention to tackle this vital problem.
A) Early diagnosis. The cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP has
100% sensitivity in detecting amyloid cardiac involvement,
anticipating echocardiographic abnormalities and preceding
the onset of cardiac symptoms by several months.
17 The
great majority of patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy
have an abnormal FLC κ/λ ratio. Therefore, we have recently proposed routine adoption of a simple strategy, i.e.
checking NT-proBNP levels during monitoring of patients
with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance with abnormal κ/λ ratio, in order to detect heart
involvement at a very early stage.
18 Increasing knowledge
and awareness of these rare diseases, through national and
international collaborative networks and patients’ associations, is also fundamental for improving early recognition of
these rapidly progressive diseases in which ‘time’ is ‘life’.
B) Synergize treatment and improve tolerability. Several lines
of evidence indicate that a profound and early reduction of
cardiotoxic LC is critical to improving survival. Achieving
this aim remains difficult in these frail patients extremely
sensitive to the toxicity of therapy. A possible strategy
would be to combine agents with synergistic mechanisms
of action, thereby allowing lower doses of each individual
agent to be used, thus improving tolerance while producing
rapid and deep responses.
12 Recently, an over 90% survival
at two years was reported in a retrospective series in 20
stage III patients receiving cyclophosphamide, bortezomib
and dexamethasone. However, this study also included previously treated subjects.
19 Prospective trials of regimens
based on rapidly acting proteasome inhibitors in association
with alkylating agents and low-dose dexamethasone in
stage III patients are ongoing to validate this strategy.
Silencing the amyloid LC isotype gene could be an alternative and less toxic strategy.
20
C) Accelerate recovery of cardiac function. The most advanced
stage III patients, with extreme elevations of NT-proBNP
and hypotension, pose an extremely difficult challenge.
These very ill patients cannot withstand even attenuated
regimens and achieving good quality response (≥ VGPR)
may not be sufficient to rescue heart function.
12 Strategies
directed at promoting the resorption of amyloid deposits,
such as immunotherapy21 or small molecules like doxycycline22 in combination with effective, attenuated
chemotherapy, could potentially accelerate the recovery of
cardiac function, improving the quality of life and extending
survival. Drugs counteracting the proteotoxicity of the
amyloid light chains, such as epigallocatechin-gallate,
23 can
also improve heart performance. Several trials are ongoing
to test these novel strategies.
D) Supporting cardiac function. Careful control of body
weight and judicious diuretic use are fundamental. Devices
that assist ventricular function have been used in patients
with terminally compromised cardiac function, with disappointing results, mostly due to high morbidity.
24 Cardiac
transplantation represents a life-saving approach, particularly in young patients without significant extra-cardiac organ
involvement. Sequential ASCT can warrant extended survival and quality of life.
25 However, the feasibility of this
approach is limited by the availability of organ donors.
Reduction of morbidity and mortality in patients with
cardiac AL amyloidosis requires the development of innovative and more effective remedies. Basic research into the
molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac injury caused by
amyloid proteins is essential to direct therapeutic efforts. In
the near future, new treatment options targeting multiple
steps in the process of amyloidogenesis, from reducing the
amyloid precursor protein to accelerating the clearance of
amyloid deposits and counteracting proteotoxicity, have
the potential to improve clinical efficacy while reducing
treatment-related complications.

Hemophilia defines a group of hereditary bleeding
disorders: hemophilia A (deficiency of Factor VIII,
FVIII), hemophilia B (deficiency of FIX), and parahemophilia (deficiency of FV). These result from mutations
in clotting factor genes. As in the large majority of bleeding
disorders (Table 1), replacement of deficient coagulation
factor protein is required to prevent or reverse acute bleeding episodes. This is achieved by the administration of
recombinant or plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates
(PDCFC), e.g. FVIII or FIX; or inhibitor-bypassing agents
such as rFVIIa or Factor VIII inhibitor bypass activity
(FEIBA). Being effective at preventing and treating bleeding
in patients with hemophilia, and enabling self-administration at home, PDCFC has replaced cryoprecipitate and
