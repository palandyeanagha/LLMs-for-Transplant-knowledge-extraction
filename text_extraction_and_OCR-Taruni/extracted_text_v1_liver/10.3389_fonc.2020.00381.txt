Background and aim: Liver transplantation (LT) is a validated treatment for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC recurrence occurred between 8 and 20% of
patients and lung is the most frequent site. Pulmonary metastases resection (PMR)
prolongs survival, however in LT-setting the impact on survival is unclear. To give new
lights on this issue, we report the experience of three Italian LT Centers.
Methods: All consecutive HCC transplanted patients in three Italian LT Centers, who
developed pulmonary metastasis from HCC (PM-HCC), as first metastasis, from 2008 to
2018, were included whenever treated with PMR.
Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled (median age 58 yrs, 84% male, 3%
cirrhotics). HCC recurred after 34 months (9–306) since LT and PMR was performed
after 2.4 months (0–43.1). A total of 28 PMR (19 single resections; 9 multiple resections;
16 right; 2 left) have been performed on 24 patients while in one case percutaneous
microwave ablation (MWA) was preferred. Four patients have been re-operated due
to pulmonary HCC-recurrence after surgery. The majority of surgical resection type
was wedge resection (26, 89%). Surgical access was: video-assisted thoracic surgery
(VATS) in 17 cases (59%); thoracotomy in 11 (38%); MWA in 1 (3%). The 48% of
nodule was in right lower lobe. Perioperative in-hospital mortality and 30 days mortality
were nil; median surgical time 90 min (50–365); median post-operative overall stay
5 days (2–11). Post-operative ICU treatment was necessary in 1 case (3%) for 3
days; blood transfusions in 2 cases (7%). Overall, 5 complications (2 bleeding; 1
AKI; 1 major cardiac; 1 wound dehiscence) occurred, with an overall complications
rate of 23%. Eight (32%) patients died during a follow-up after HCC recurrence of
32 months (7–213): 7 for HCC progression, 1 for severe liver failure due to chronic

rejection. The 1 and 5 year cumulative probability of OS from recurrence were 100 and
43% (95%CI 12–74), respectively, with a median OS of 51 months (95%CI 24–78).
Conclusion: Selected patients with isolated pulmonary HCC-recurrence after LT and
with preserved hepatic function showed that a pulmonary metastasectomy could be
efficacious in managing a PM-HCC and could give an opportunity for long-term survival.

INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation (LT) is a validated treatment for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1, 2). The risk of HCC
recurrence varies between 8 and 20% depending on pretransplant-variables such as the tumor burden and the
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level (3–7). Moreover, HCC recurrence
after LT is an accepted and not exceptional clinical challenge
(8). In fact, it reduces LT curative intention, being the survival
reduced as low as 3.3 months when only best supportive care is
offered (9). Surveillance and administration of HCC recurrence
after LT is exciting and complicated. More frequently, recurrence
occurs within the first 2 years (10), although cases of very late
recurrence after a 10 year period have been reported (11, 12).
Regarding the sites of HCC recurrence, the first revelation
is more frequently extra-hepatic (as high as 71%), followed
by intra-hepatic and simultaneously intra- and extra-hepatic
(13). In addition, intra- or extrahepatic recurrence, or the
combination of both, did not result in different outcomes.
Among the extrahepatic sites of recurrence, the lung is the
most frequent metastatic site (5). Pulmonary metastases resection
(PMR) for HCC improves survival in patients treated by
liver resection or ablative procedures (14). Although some
investigators recommend PMR also for HCC recurrence after
LT (15, 16), in this setting the impact on survival is unclear
and today pulmonary metastases for HCC (PM-HCC) after LT
are infrequently resected due to their multiplicity and multiorgan involvement.
To give new lights on this issue, we report the experience of
three Italian LT Centers regarding pulmonary metastasectomy
for HCC after LT in terms of safety, complication, risk of
recurrence, and survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design, Patients, and Endpoints
This is a retrospective evaluation of a cohort of prospectively
enrolled patients in three different Liver Transplant Centers
in Italy (two in Milan and one in Padua). All consecutive
HCC transplanted patients, who developed PM-HCC, as first
metastasis, from 2008 to 2018 were included in this study
whenever treated with lung surgery resection. The database
was locked in June 2019. Baseline corresponded to first HCC
recurrence after LT with lung metastases. Each patient signed a
written informed consent in conformity with the ethic committee
and the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as
updated in 2004.
A contrast-enhanced thoraco-abdominal computed
tomography (CT)-scan was performed every 6 months for
the first 5 years, and then annually in all HCC transplanted
patients. Serum AFP was quantified every 3 months during the
first year and every 6 months thereafter. In case of suspected HCC
recurrence, biopsy was performed when the site of recurrence
is reachable. Otherwise, the diagnosis was obtained by imaging
associated with AFP levels increase. Once the diagnosis was
obtained, surgery treatment was performed whenever judged
appropriate, with a curative or palliative intent. For the analysis,
treatments were considered with a curative intent if the removal
of the neoplastic lesion led the patient HCC-free.
Once the diagnosis was obtained, in one of the three centers
sorafenib was started as soon as became available and its use
safe (i.e., after healing of surgical wound in surgical patients)
and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTORi)-
based immunosuppression regimen (sirolimus or everolimus)
was considered.
The following data were collected: demographics and
pre-LT history, native liver histological tumor staging,
immunosuppressive regimens, time, characteristics and
treatments of HCC recurrence, surgery procedures,
and complications.
The primary endpoint was safety of surgery on lung metastasis
in HCC recurrent patients after LT. Secondary endpoints were
feasibility of surgery in these patients, recurrence after the first
surgical treatment and survival.
Surgery safety was assessed with evaluations of multiple
parameters: perioperative in-hospital mortality (considered
as death for any causes during post-operative in-hospital
course), 30 days mortality (considered as death for any
causes within 30 days after thoracic surgery), surgical skin-toskin time, post-operative hospital stay, need of post-operative
intensive care unit (ICU), blood transfusions, readmission rate,
post-operative complications. We considered as complication
any of the following: bleeding, pneumonia, major cardiac
complications (atrial fibrillation or acute myocardial ischemia),
persistent air leak >7 days, wound infection or dehiscence,
acute kidney injury (AKI). A CT-scan every 2 months
after surgery and during follow-up was used to assess
tumor response, according to modified Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (17). Time to
radiological progression was defined as the time elapsed
from baseline to disease progression according to modified

RECIST criteria for HCC. Overall survival (OS) was measured
from the date of first surgical intervention until the date
of death from any cause or date of the last visit. Baseline
variables were also analyzed in order to identify predictors
of OS.
Surgery
Patients with suspected or diagnosed thoracic metastasis from
HCC have been referred to thoracic surgery department.
Firstly, all referred patients were screened and judged suitable
or unsuitable for metastasectomy from surgical anatomical
point of view. Considering the metastatic nature of the
thoracic nodules, the intervention proposed was a minimally
invasive lung-sparing resection, whenever possible. If positively
judged for surgery, patients were functionally evaluated
by cardio-pulmonary tests and, finally an anathesiological
risk was formulated, according to the American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system.
The intraoperative and post-operative management was carried
out in a standard way.
Statistical Analysis
We used standard statistics (median and range for continuous
variables, percentage for categorical variables) to describe
baseline series characteristics and safety data. Survival time was
computed as the interval between first HCC recurrence and death
(survival after recurrence). Survival time was censored at the date
of last contact in living patients. Survival curves were estimated
with the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method. Calculations
were done using SPSS Statistics Program.
RESULTS
Twenty-five patients were enrolled. Patients’ baseline
characteristics are shown in Table 1. HCC recurred after
a median of 33.6 months (8.9–306.4) since LT. PM-HCC
treatment was performed after a median of 2.4 months (0–
43.1) following HCC recurrence. A total of 28 PMR (19 single
resections; 9 multiple resections; 16 right; 2 left) have been
performed on the 24 enrolled patients. In additional patient,
transthoracic percutaneous microwave thermoablation (MWA)
was preferred, due to the high risk for surgery. Four patients
have been re-operated due to pulmonary HCC-recurrence
after the first PMR. The majority of surgical resection type was
wedge resection (n = 26, 89.2%), while only one segmentectomy
and one lobectomy were performed. The surgical access was
as follows: video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in 17 cases
(58.6%); thoracotomy (11 cases, 37.9%); MWA (1 case, 3.4%).
None conversion from VATS to thoracotomy was needed. The
presence of pleural adhesions was observed in 7 cases (24.1%).
The average of nodules treated per procedure was 1.5 (1–4). The
majority of nodule treated was in right lower lobe (12), followed
by left lower lobe (7), left upper lobe (6), right upper lobe (4),
and right middle lobe (3). In Table 2 per-patient’s characteristics
were presented.

Safety Analysis
Perioperative in-hospital mortality and 30 days mortality were
nil. Median surgical time (skin-to-skin) was 90 min (range 50–

2–11). Post-operative ICU treatment was necessary in 1 case
only (3.4%), for 3 days. Blood transfusions were necessary in
2 cases (6.9%). Readmission was required in 1 case (3.4%). A
total of 5 complications (2 bleeding; 1 AKI; 1 major cardiac; 1
wound dehiscence) were observed, with an overall complications
occurrence of 22.7% (detailed in Table 2).
Effectiveness and Survival
The median follow-up after HCC recurrence was 32.5 months
(7.4–213.0). Eight (32%) patients died: 7 for HCC progression,
1 patient for severe liver failure due to chronic rejection. The 1-,
3-, and 5 year cumulative probability of OS from recurrence were
100, 66% (95%IC 44–88) and 43% (95%CI 12–74), respectively,
with a median OS of 51 months (95%CI 24–78) (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1 | Cumulative survival (1, 3, and 5 year) of the 25 patients enrolled in the study after hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence following liver transplantation.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to specifically
evaluate the impact and management of lung metastases in
HCC recurrence after LT. We observed a low occurrence of
complications, no surgery-related mortality and a good feasibility
of surgery in those patients judged operable after first RPM
whenever HCC recurred in lung. We observed that the majority
of recurrences were in the right lower lobe. This is probably due
to the proximity of this site to the liver at the time of hepatectomy
and to the lymphatic drainage. Finally, we detected good longterm survival outcomes, with a 1-, 3-, and 5 year cumulative
probability of OS from recurrence of 100%, 66% (95%CI 44–88)
and 43% (95%CI 12–74), respectively, and a median OS of 51
months (95%CI 24–78).
Our study would have a great impact in the setting of LT for
HCC, since the second most common site of HCC recurrence is
the lung. Whenever the lesions were limited to the lung, we were
able to show that complete resection can be safely performed,
which may have contributed to the long-term survival of these
patients, while some reviews advocated more aggressive surgical
intervention (5, 6). This is of great importance, since tumor
recurrence would have obviously decreased the opportunity of
long-term survival after LT for HCC (6, 15). To the best of
our knowledge, only few reports of resection for pulmonary
metastasis from HCC after liver transplantation are available
(15, 16, 18–22). In particular, Bates et al. (16) reported five
cases of metastatic HCC resection after liver transplantation, with
a survival period of 44 months after LT and 28 months after
pulmonary resection.
Finally, our results in terms of OS are comparable to those of
patients following metastasectomy after liver resection for HCC
in patients without history of LT (14, 23–25).
Although prognostic indicators are not known, several
clinical or pathological factors have been published (14, 23, 26,
27). Generally, patient selection and metastasis characteristics
(such as number and side of lesions) are indispensable for
a surgery survival benefit. In additional, good liver function
might be essential for better survival (28, 29). As confirmation
of this, in our study population was well-selected (only lung
metastasis) with a good liver function (no patients with
decompensated disease).
After the metastasectomy, recurrence may be managed by a
repeated metastasectomy (23, 30–32). In our series, 4 patients
(3 cases for recurrence, once case to complete the resection)
underwent to a second pulmonary resection for a recurrent PMHCC after a metastasectomy. Multiple metastases or repeated
metastasectomies are not risk factors for long-term survival, as
shown in this and previous studies (31, 33), although patients
with a single metastasis or single pulmonary surgery might show
better survival (23, 26).
Limitations of our study are: the retrospective design, the
lack of a control arm and the limited number of patients. The
impact of surgical access on outcome cannot be assessed, due to
the limited number of patients. However, the study has several
strengths: this is the largest consecutive series of patients affected
by lung HCC-metastasis treated surgery in the post-transplant
setting. Moreover, despite the retrospective design of the study,
the cohort is homogeneous regarding the baseline features and
the patient management.
In conclusion, selected patients without intrahepatic HCCrecurrence after LT and with preserved hepatic function showed
that a pulmonary metastasectomy could be efficacious in
managing a PM-HCC and could give an opportunity for longterm survival.
