Abstract
Background and Aims: Lifestyle (exercise and dietary)
modification is the mainstay of treatment for non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is paucity of data
on effect of intensity of exercise in management of NAFLD,
and we aimed to study the effect of variable intensities of
exercise on NAFLD. Methods: The study was performed in
the Department of Gastroenterology of the SCB Medical College, Cuttack and the Biju Patnaik State Police Academy, Bhubaneswar. The subjects were police trainees [18 in a
moderate intensity exercise group (MIG) and 19 in a low intensity exercise group (LIG)] recruited for a 6-month physical
training course (261.8 Kcalorie, 3.6 metabolic equivalent in
MIG and 153.6 Kcalorie, 2.1 metabolic equivalent in LIG).
NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonography, with exclusion of
all secondary causes of steatosis. All participants were evaluated by anthropometry (weight, height, body mass index
(BMI), waist circumference), assessed for blood pressure
and biochemical parameters (blood glucose, liver function
test, lipid profile, serum insulin), and subjected to transabdominal ultrasonography before and after 6 months of physical
training, and the results were compared. Results: Both the
groups had similar BMI, fasting plasma glucose, AST, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (known as HOMA-IR) (p>0.05).
However, subjects in the LIG were older and had lower alanine
transaminase, higher triglycerides and lower high-density lipoproteins than MIG subjects. There was a significant reduction in BMI (27.0±2.1 to 26.8±2.0; p=0.001), fasting blood
glucose (106.7±21.6 to 85.8±19.0; p<0.001), serum triglycerides (167.5±56.7 to 124.6±63.5; p=0.017), total cholesterol (216.8±29.2 to 196.7±26.6; p=0.037), low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (134.6±21.4 to 130.5±21.9;
p=0.010), serum aspartate transaminase (39.3±32.2 to
30.9±11.4; p<0.001), serum alanine transaminase (56.6
±28.7 to 33.0±11.3; p<0.001) and HOMA-IR (2.63±2.66 to
1.70±2.59; p<0.001) in the MIG. However, changes in these
parameters in the LIG were non-significant. Hepatic steatosis
regressed in 66.7% of the NAFLD subjects in the MIG but in only
26.3% of the LIG NAFLD subjects (p=0.030). Conclusions:
Moderate rather than low intensity physical activity causes significant improvement in BMI, serum triglycerides, cholesterol,
serum transaminases and HOMA-IR, and regression of ultrasonographic fatty change in liver among NAFLD subjects.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most
common hepatic disorders, with macrovesicular fat accumulation in more than 5% of hepatocytes in the absence of any
secondary cause of hepatic steatosis, such as significant alcohol
abuse (more than 10 g/day for women and 20 g/day for men),
hepatotropic viral infection, drugs which can cause fatty liver, or
any other etiologies.1 In the last couple of decades, NAFLD has
emerged as the most common liver disease in adults.2 Its prevalence varies in different parts of the world, ranging from 5-40%.
However, its occurrence is even higher in individuals with obesity
(30-100%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (42.6-69.5%).3 Despite
the benign natural course in the majority, 10% of the NAFLD
patients may progress to cirrhosis later on in their lives.4 It contributes to formation of a pro-inflammatory environment that
accelerates atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of ischemic
heart disease and its severity, which itself correlates with the
degree of inflammation.5 In addition, these individuals are at a
high risk for developing diabetes mellitus. Hence, patient education about the entity, need for treatment and compliance are
necessary to avert future complications.

Lifestyle modification is still the treatment of first choice for
NAFLD patients and is recommended for all patients with
NAFLD.6 This aims at weight loss and reduction of insulin resistance (IR). Further, it is also directed at managing obesity and
the features of metabolic syndrome which are frequently associated with NAFLD. Low-calorie diet and increased physical
activity are the cornerstones of lifestyle modification. Patients
are encouraged to lose at least 10% of their initial body weight
to achieve maximal benefits. Weight loss improves patients’
cardiovascular risk profile and steatosis,7 and probably
reduces hepatic inflammation as well as hepatocellular
injury.8 Exercise is a major component of treatment for
NAFLD, as recommended by the American Gastroenterological
Association,9 the American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases and the European Association of Study of Liver. As
compared to type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is a paucity of
data supporting the role of physical activity in management of
NAFLD. This may be due to the invasive nature of grading
hepatic steatosis by needle biopsy and histology, which limits
the capacity for repeated measurement of hepatic steatosis
and degree of necroinflammation. The federal guidelines of
the USA’s Department of Health and Human Services and the
USA’s Department of Agriculture recommend that adults should
perform 150 min or more of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, 75 min or more of vigorous intensity physical
activity per week, or a combination, to improve and maintain
health.10 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
the World Health Organization11 recommendations are also the
same. For additional health benefits, the amount of physical
activity recommended should be doubled.11 However, controversy remains over the role of exercise intensity and total
volume of exercise responsible for final health outcomes.
The aim of this study was to compare the beneficial effects of
low and moderate intensity exercise for 6 months, on NAFLD.
Methods
This study was performed in the Biju Patnaik State Police
Academy, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India which conducts 6
months of physical training before recruitment or promotion.
The subjects were middle-aged male police recruits selected
for 6 months of physical training.
Inclusion criteria
The police trainees who had fatty liver detected on ultrasonography were included in this study. These participants
were in good health and had no abnormal findings on general
and systemic physical examinations and for blood count and
transabdominal ultrasonography (except for fatty liver).
Exclusion criteria
Patients with organic gastrointestinal disease revealed by
ultrasonography or gastroduodenoscopy were excluded. Participants who had history of alcohol consumption exceeding
20 g⁄day, subjects with other liver diseases [hepatitis viruses
A through E (by viral serologies: hepatitis B surface antigen,
anti-hepatitis C virus antibody), autoimmune disease (autoimmune markers: anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle
antibody, anti-liver kidney microsome type 1 antibody) and
Wilson’s disease (serum ceruloplasmin)] and those on drugs
which can induce fatty liver or insulin sensitization
(estrogens, amiodarone, methotrexate, tamoxifen, glitazones, metformin) were also excluded from the study.
An informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Detailed anthropometric assessment, including measurements
of weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences, was
conducted before and after 6 months of physical exercise. The
waist circumference was measured at a level midway between
the lowest rib and the iliac crest and hip circumference at the
level of the greater trochanter. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated by the formula of weight (kg) / height2 (m2
).
The measurements of fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postglucose load plasma glucose, serum triglycerides, serum total
cholesterol, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
liver function markers were performed by standard laboratory
methods both before the beginning and after the completion
of 6 months of physical exercise. The estimation of serum
insulin was performed by using the electrochemiluminescence method (Roche-Diagnostics, USA) with an autoanalyzer, Elecsys 2010 (Roche-Hitachi, Japan). IR was computed
by using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) method
via a mathematical model derived from fasting plasma
glucose and plasma insulin. The value of HOMA was calculated by the following equation: [fasting insulin (mU/mL) 3
fasting blood glucose (mg/dL)]/405, and depicted as the
HOMA-IR value.12 For the purpose of the study, a HOMA-IR
value above 2 was considered to indicate IR.13
Transabdominal ultrasonography was performed independently and blindly by two experienced radiologists (AAP
and SJ; 5-10 years’ experience) to identify and grade fatty
changes in liver; in case of any conflict, the discrepancy was
resolved by consensus after examination by a third senior
radiologist (RKS; 15 years’ experience). The diagnosis of fatty
liver was made as per the standard criteria adopted by the
American Gastroenterology Association,14 i.e. an increase in
liver echogenicity as compared to renal echogenicity as a
reference, as well as lack of differentiation in periportal intensity and vascular wall due to hyperechogenicity of the liver
parenchyma.
All the participants were subjected to aerobic physical training for 6 months, which included brisk walking, jogging, marching drill, ‘lathi’ drill, and yoga. The duration of each session of
the physical activity was 50-60 m per day with a frequency of
5-6 sessions per week. The duration of physical activity and
total calories burnt during exercise (volume of exercise) were
estimated by accelerometers. The intensity of exercise was
deducted by the equation for metabolic equivalent (MET) as
follows: (total calories)/(kg body weight)/(hours of exercised
performed). Activities with MET values below 3 were labelled as
low intensity exercise, those with MET between 3 and 5.9 were
classified as moderate intensity, and activities with MET values
$ 6 were classified as vigorous intensity.
The subjects of the study were classified into the following
groups:
1. Low intensity exercise group (LIG) and
2. Moderate intensity exercise group (MIG).
None of the study participants were subjected to vigorous
intensity exercise. All the trainees were provided with a diet of
2400 to 2700 kcal/day. This study was approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee of SCB Medical College, Cuttack.
Statistical analysis
Normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as
mean±standard deviation. Student’s t-test for unpaired data

was used to compare the groups when the variables were normally distributed. Chi-square test was used to compare differences between categorical variables. All the anthropometric
and biochemical parameters before and after 6 months of
physical activity were compared by Student’s t-test for paired
data. All calculations were performed using the statistical software, SPSS version 16. A p value of less than 0.05 was taken
as significant.
Results
Out of 62 police recruits, a total of 37 subjects were to found
to have NAFLD, out of which 18 performed moderate intensity
exercise and 19 performed low intensity exercise for 6
months (Fig. 1). Baseline comparison between the two
groups is depicted in Table 1. The mean intensity of physical
activity in the MIG was 3.6 MET (with mean total volume of
exercise: 261.8 Kcalorie), whereas that of the LIG was 2.1
MET (with mean volume: 156.6 Kcalorie).
Patients in the LIG were older (53.3±3.7 years vs. 37.3
±8.2 years; p<0.001), with significantly higher systolic blood
pressure (156.6±18.9 mmHg vs. 132.2±13.2 mmHg;
p<0.001), lower serum total cholesterol (181.4±34.8 vs.
211.2±30.0; p=0.018), lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol (102.5±29.9 vs. 30.5±22.0; p=0.007), lower
serum aspartate transaminase (AST; 23.9±7.9 vs. 39.2
±29.5; p=0.039) and lower serum alanine transaminase
(ALT; 26.3±13.1 vs. 61.8±30.2; p<0.001). However, both of
the groups had comparable BMI, diastolic blood pressure,
fasting and 2-h post-glucose load plasma glucose, serum triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl

transpeptidase (GGT), HOMA-IR, 24-h dietary intake, and total
duration of physical activity. On the other hand, subjects with
moderate intensity exercise had significantly higher total calories burnt in exercise (261.81±37.18 Kcalorie vs. 153.58
±29.10 Kcalorie; p<0.001).
In the LIG, there was significant decrease in waist hip ratio
and waist height ratio, whereas decrease in mean BMI was
modest (0.2) and non-significant (p=0.623) (Table 2).
Besides, there was a significant reduction in blood pressure,
serum total, high-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum GGT. However, changes in all
other parameters, including serum transaminases (AST and
ALT), were non-significant. Furthermore, only 5 out of 19
(26.3%) had resolution of fatty change in liver on
ultrasonography.
Similarly, for the subjects who were subjected to moderate
intensity exercise—although they showed modest improvement in BMI, waist hip ratio and waist height ratio, these
changes were non-significant. However, there was significant
reduction in blood pressure (Table 2). Further, there was significant improvement in lipid profile (except LDL cholesterol)
and serum GGT. Unlike the LIG, subjects with moderate
intensity exercise had elevated serum ALT at the baseline,
and there were significant drops in serum levels of the transaminases (both AST and ALT) and decrease in HOMA-IR. Similarly, fasting glucose and triglycerides were normal/
borderline normal at baseline in the MIG, which decreased
significantly after intervention; whereas, in the LIG, these
parameters were abnormal, with no significant change. Moreover, the fatty changes in liver disappeared in 12 out 18
(66.7%) subjects. The percentage of non-significant
(p>0.05) decrease in weight was higher in those who
achieved resolution of fatty change in liver (Table 3).
Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to
assess the risk factors for resolution of fatty change in liver
after physical training (Table 4). Out of all demographic,
anthropometric, biochemical parameters and exercise
indices, serum triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein,
presence of metabolic syndrome and exercise intensity were
found to be significant predictors for response (sonographic
resolution of fatty change in liver) to physical exercise in
NAFLD participants. A multivariate logistic regression analysis
was performed including the above risk factors (Table 4) and
only exercise intensity was found to be an independent factor
for resolution of fatty changes in liver on ultrasound. The noninvasive scores of fibrosis [NAFLD fibrosis score, fibrosis-4
score, and AST to platelet ratio (commonly referred to as
APRI)] as well as fatty liver index (FLI) were computed for
all study subjects. Participants in the MIG showed significant
improvement in APRI score (p=0.005) and FLI (p<0.001)
(Table 5). However, in the subjects belonging to the LIG, no
significant improvement was observed in any of the scores,
except for reduction in FLI (p=0.031) after physical training
(Table 5).

Nath P. et al: Effect of exercise intensity on NAFLD

Discussion
The MIG had an elevated ALT and borderline normal fasting
glucose and serum triglycerides at baseline, with significant
improvement in these parameters at the end of the 6-month
period. However, the LIG had normal ALT and abnormal
fasting glucose and serum triglycerides at baseline but no
significant change after intervention. The basic principle
underlying use of physical exercise in treatment of NAFLD is
improvement in insulin sensitivity. Moderate to vigorous
physical activity leads to reduction in total body fat, especially
in visceral adipose tissue.15 Decreased visceral adiposity leads
to reduced fatty acid delivery to the liver, thereby decreasing
hepatic steatosis and resultant necroinflammation.
In our study, moderate intensity aerobic exercise resulted
in significant resolution of fatty change in liver and improvement in serum aminotransferases (AST and ALT). The role of
physical activity in NAFLD has been investigated in various
studies. Suzuki et al.16 demonstrated that regular exercise
was associated with ALT reduction. Further, for every 5% in

Nath P. et al: Effect of exercise intensity on NAFLD

weight loss, a 3.6 greater likelihood of ALT normalization was
observed in their study.16 Studies employing magnetic resonance spectroscopy (known as 1H-MRS) also confirm these
reports.17,18 In our study, although the degree of weight loss
in both the groups was not significant, there was a significant
fall in serum transaminases in the MIG. However, in the LIG,
the reduction in transaminases was not significant.
The effect of exercise with or without hypocaloric diet on
NAFLD patients has been studied in various clinical
trials.8,19–27 Most of these studies had smaller number of subjects, absence of measurement of volume (calorie) and intensity of exercise, and some lacked histological endpoints. A
comparison of the results of eight studies, including the
present study, is shown in Supplementary Table 1. All trials
showed significant improvement in BMI, serum enzymes
(AST/ALT), and degree of fatty liver. There are several
studies that have demonstrated a dose-dependent improvement in liver histology27 and intrahepatic triglycerides26
dependent on the degree of weight loss achieved. However,
the improvement in transaminases, HOMA-IR, FLI and resolution of ultrasonographic fatty change in liver was independent of the degree of weight loss in our study. Further studies
are required, with longer duration and with more intense
physical activities, to demonstrate changes in fibrosis score.
Recently, the intensity rather than duration of exercise and
total calorie expenditure during physical activity has caught
the attention of researchers. Kistler et al.23 in a retrospective
study examined the effect of exercise intensity on histological
severity of NAFLD. In this study, the exercise volume and
intensity was calculated by self-reported physical activity
data from adult patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD enrolled
in the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research
Network, and the NAFLD patients were classified into moderate and vigorous exercise groups as per the federal recommendations. The study demonstrated an inverse relationship
between the intensity of physical activity and severity of
NAFLD. However, this study was limited by its cross-sectional
nature, measurement limitations, and misclassification due to
reporting and recall bias. On the contrary, in our study, we
measured the exercise intensity prospectively with objective
methods (by accelerometers).
Our study had several limitations. The two study groups
were not entirely comparable as there were significant differences in age, baseline levels of serum AST and ALT, serum
total cholesterol, and serum LDL cholesterol. Besides, the
sample size was small and only male NAFLD subjects were
included. Furthermore, the diagnosis of NAFLD was based on
transabdominal ultrasound, which can miss fatty liver when
the degree of steatosis is less than 30%.28
Conclusions
Moderate intensity of physical activities for a duration of
6 months helps in improvement in hepatic steatosis, serum
transaminitis, glycemic and lipid profiles as well as IR, as
compared with low intensity exercise. All individuals with
NAFLD should perform moderately intense physical activities
for maximum benefits. More rigorous, controlled studies, of
longer duration and with defined histopathological end-points
are the need of the hour for better evidence-based lifestyle
modification guidelines.
