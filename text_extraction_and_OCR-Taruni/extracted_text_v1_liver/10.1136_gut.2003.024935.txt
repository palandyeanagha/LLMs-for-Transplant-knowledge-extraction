‘‘PRIMARY’’ NASH AND THE DYSMETABOLIC SYNDROME
Histopathological characteristics distinguish steatohepatitis from other causes of chronic liver
injury. For years, the main cause of steatohepatitis was thought to be excessive consumption of
alcohol. Increasingly, steatohepatitis is being diagnosed in individuals who deny alcohol abuse.
Arbitrarily, ‘‘non-alcoholic’’ steatohepatitis (NASH) is subcategorised into ‘‘primary’’ and
‘‘secondary’’ NASH.1
Primary NASH refers to steatohepatitis that is associated with the dysmetabolic syndrome (that
is, obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia).2 Primary NASH is thought to be the predominant form
of NASH, afflicting at least as many individuals in the USA as chronic hepatitis C. Secondary
NASH refers to steatohepatitis that accompanies other syndromes (for example, lipodystrophy) or
that is caused by certain drugs (for example, amiodarone).3 Accumulating evidence suggests that
common mechanisms may mediate the pathogenesis of alcohol induced steatohepatitis and
primary NASH.4 Although unproven, it is likely that primary and secondary NASH also share
common pathogenic mechanisms.
c PATHOGENIC RELEVANCE OF NASH ASSOCIATED DISORDERS
Obesity
Obesity, especially visceral adiposity, is a major risk factor for NASH in humans.5 Even if they do
not have an elevated body mass index, patients with NASH are very likely to be insulin resistant.2
Basic research on fat cell (adipocyte) biology provides some clues about why obesity, insulin
resistance, and NASH may be interrelated.
Obesity increases adipose tissue mass. It has long been known that adipose tissue is a source of
free fatty acids that are delivered to the liver and a depot for triglycerides that are synthesised by
hepatocytes and released into the blood. Only recently however has the neuroendocrine role of
adipose tissue been appreciated. Fat produces hormones, such as leptin, resistin, and adiponectin,
that regulate metabolism in other tissues, as well as fat itself. Fat is also a source of
neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline and angiotensin II. In addition, because adipocytes
produce immunomodulatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin
(IL)-6, fat is a component of the immune system.6–8
Given the neuroendocrine and immunomodulatory functions of fat, it is not surprising that
absolute increases in adipose tissue mass influence systemic energy homeostasis, intermediary
metabolism, and immune function. The situation is further complicated by the likelihood that
there are both qualitative and quantitative differences in the factors (aka, ‘‘adipokines’’) that are
produced by different fat depots. For example, visceral fat, which appears to be less ‘‘mature’’
than subcutaneous fat, produces more TNF-a and free fatty acids but less adiponectin than
subcutaneous fat, which produces large amounts of leptin.7 Thus the ultimate consequences of
obesity may differ depending on which fat depots predominate.
Visceral fat depots, TNF-a, hepatic insulin resistance, and fatty liver
Visceral adiposity in particular has been strongly associated with the dysmetabolic syndrome and
NASH.9–12 Visceral fat promotes fatty liver disease by several mechanisms. Firstly, intra-abdominal
fat provides an immediate source of free fatty acids that are delivered directly into the portal
vein.11 In mice, situations that increase the delivery of free fatty acids to tissues, including the
liver, induce localised insulin resistance.13 In addition, gene disruption studies in mice have
proven that interference with insulin signalling in hepatocytes (that is, hepatocyte insulin
resistance) activates fat synthesising enzymes in these cells and results in hepatic steatosis.14
Secondly, individuals with truncal obesity have extremely low levels of adiponectin and relatively
high levels of TNF-a.
15 TNF-a is known to activate intracellular signalling molecules, including
stress related kinases such as Jun N-terminal kinase and inhibitor kappa beta kinase beta, that

make cells resistant to the actions of insulin.13 16 17
Adiponectin antagonises both the production and activity of
TNF-a.
18–21 Therefore, TNF-a actions are potentiated when
adiponectin is scarce.22 In addition, TNF-a itself inhibits
adiponectin.23 24 Adiponectin acts directly on hepatocytes to
inhibit fatty acid synthesis and uptake while stimulating
fatty acid oxidation.25–27 Therefore, adiponectin itself also
enhances hepatocyte sensitivity to insulin.28 29 The combination of low adiponectin and high TNF-a levels in the context
of increased hepatic exposure to free fatty acids results in
hepatic steatosis and severe hepatic insulin resistance.30–32 The
importance of visceral fat in the pathogenesis of hepatic
insulin resistance and steatosis has been demonstrated in
Zucker fatty fatty (fa/fa) rats. In these animals with inherited
leptin resistance, surgical resection of intra-abdominal fat
depots reverses both conditions.33
Cytokines, adipokines, and steatohepatitis
As mentioned previously, similarities in the histopathology of
alcohol induced steatohepatitis and obesity related NASH
suggest that common mechanisms may mediate both
diseases. In non-obese experimental animals in which
chronic ingestion of alcohol containing diets was used to
induce steatohepatitis, various treatments that inhibit TNF-a
activity prevent alcohol induced steatohepatitis (reviewed by
Tsukamoto and Lu34). Work by Sasaki and Wands35 and Mohr
and colleagues36 has also suggested that chronic consumption
of ethanol causes insulin resistance in rats and mice. Given
evidence that the cellular mechanisms for insulin resistance
also activate TNF-a production,16 it is not so surprising that
insulin sensitising drugs that inhibit TNF-a37 38 protect mice
from alcohol induced steatohepatitis.39 Recently, in a mouse
model of NASH (for example, leptin deficient ob/ob mice), we
showed that anti-TNF-a antibodies improve hepatic insulin
sensitivity and NASH.40 Xu et al reported that non-obese
ethanol fed mice and obese ob/ob mice both exhibit increased
TNF-a and reduced adiponectin levels. Injections of recombinant adiponectin inhibited TNF-a, improved insulin sensitivity, and reversed steatohepatitis in lean (leptin sufficient)
ethanol fed mice, as well as in obese mice with genetic leptin
deficiency.41
Obese humans almost always have high serum levels of
leptin.10 Therefore, it has been argued that results from
studies of leptin deficient ob/ob mice may have little
relevance to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and
NASH in obese humans.3 42 While there is no question that
leptin levels in ob/ob mice and obese humans differ
dramatically, both ob/ob mice and obese humans with the
dysmetabolic syndrome have low levels of adiponectin and
relatively high levels of TNF-a.
10 41 In humans, various
treatments that improve the dysmetabolic syndrome (for
example, diet and exercise, thiazolidinediones) have been
shown to increase adiponectin levels and reduce TNF-a.
38 43
Therefore, it is becoming apparent that similar factors (that
is, TNF-a and adiponectin) mediate NASH pathogenesis
when leptin levels are increased and when leptin levels are
reduced. Given this insight, it will be interesting to determine
if supplementing adiponectin directly improves human
insulin resistance and NASH.
NASH, FIBROGENIC FACTORS, AND CIRRHOSIS
In most liver diseases, including NASH, liver related
morbidity and mortality are greatest in the subpopulation
that progresses to cirrhosis.44 45 Because the epidemiology of
fatty liver diseases in humans demonstrates that cirrhosis is
more likely to occur in those with NASH than in those with
simple steatosis,46 it has been suggested that the severity of
chronic hepatic necroinflammation dictates the ultimate
outcome of NASH in humans.3 Interestingly, this does not
appear to be the case in rodents. Many genetically altered
mice with severe steatohepatitis (for example, MAT-1a null
mice, PPARa null mice) do not develop cirrhosis47 48 while
cirrhosis is common in other strains (for example, microsomal triglyceride transferase deficient mice) that have
significant steatosis but relatively trivial steatohepatitis
(reviewed by Koteish and Diehl49). Studies of ob/ob mice
have identified two obesity related factors that regulate
hepatic fibrosis.
Leptin
Direct comparison of ob/ob mice with steatohepatitis and
wild-type mice with steatohepatitis induced by feeding
antioxidant depleted methionine choline deficient (MCD)
diets, demonstrates that hepatic oxidant stress and necroinflammation are comparable in mice with and without
genetic leptin deficiency.50 However, leptin deficient mice
develop significantly less hepatic fibrosis than wild-type
mice, even when challenged by hepatotoxins, such as
thioacetamide, or infections, such as schistosomiasis.51–55
Leptin replacement therapy normalises the hepatic fibrogenic
response of ob/ob mice, demonstrating unequivocally that
leptin is a critical regulator of liver fibrosis.55 However, the
mechanisms by which leptin promotes hepatic fibrosis are
poorly understood. Direct effects of leptin on hepatic stellate
cells have been demonstrated by several groups.56 57 Although
the particular type of leptin receptor that is involved remains
controversial, there appears to be consensus that leptin
induces PI3 kinase, promotes the growth of cultured stellate
cells, and upregulates their collagen gene expression.58 59
Th-2 cytokines
Our group has suggested that leptin may also regulate hepatic
fibrosis indirectly by modulating the production of cytokines
and neurotransmitters. As mentioned previously, leptin
deficient mice are relatively resistant to schistosoma induced
hepatic fibrosis.54 In wild-type mice, the balance of Th-1
(proinflammatory) and Th-2 (anti-inflammatory, profibrogenic) cytokines regulates this process. Schistosoma infected
mice with targeted disruption of the genes for both IL-4 and
IL-10 do not develop liver fibrosis despite having a severe
hepatic necroinflammatory response to infection. In contrast,
schistosoma infected mice with targeted disruption of both
IL-4 and IL-12 develop severe hepatic fibrosis despite having
only trivial hepatitis.60 Leptin deficient ob/ob mice have
reduced hepatic production of both IL-4 and IL-10, similar to
leptin sufficient mice that are protected from schistosoma
induced hepatic fibrosis. We showed that treating ob/ob mice
with leptin (which normalises their fibrogenic response to
liver injury) also increases their production of Th-2 profibrogenic) cytokines, including IL-10.61
Natural killer T (NKT) cells
Components of the innate immune system, particularly NKT
cells, play a key role in balancing the types of cytokines that
are produced in the liver.62 We found that with age, the livers
of leptin deficient ob/ob mice become selectively depleted of
NKT cells due to increased rates of hepatic NKT cell
apoptosis.63 Treatment with leptin increases hepatic NKT cell

populations in ob/ob mice, suggesting that leptin directly or
indirectly regulates NKT cell viability.61 Consistent with this
concept, we showed that leptin increases IL-15, a cytokine
that is known to expand NK T cell populations in the liver.
Treating ob/ob mice with IL-15 dramatically increases their
numbers of hepatic NKT cells despite persistent leptin
deficiency. However, the effects of IL-15 are not restricted
to NKT cells (IL-15 also dramatically expands NK cell
populations). Moreover, IL-15 only slightly reduces NKT cell
apoptosis, suggesting that other factors may play a more
important role than IL-15 deficiency in mediating the
reductions in hepatic NKT cell populations that occur during
leptin deficiency.
Neurotransmitters
Recent studies in our laboratory suggest that the neurotransmitter noradrenaline is likely to be a key regulator of
hepatic NKT cell viability (unpublished data, see below).
Leptin induces the production of noradrenaline. Thus leptin
deficient ob/ob mice have reduced levels of noradrenaline.64
Recently, noradrenaline deficiency has been implicated in
several of the peripheral consequences of leptin deficiency.65
In this regard, it is interesting that NKT cells express
adrenoceptors66 because changes in noradrenaline might
influence these cells. We have explored this possibility by
studying both leptin sufficient and leptin deficient mice.
Our preliminary studies suggest that wild type mice with
targeted disruption of the gene that encodes dopamine beta
hydroxylase (Dbh, the enzyme catalyses the synthesis of
noradrenaline from dopamine) have reduced hepatic NKT
cell populations. Noradrenaline deficiency underlies depletion of hepatic NKT cell populations in Dbh null mice because
treatment with adrenergic agonists restores their hepatic
NKT cell numbers. This finding suggested to us that
noradrenaline deficiency may also contribute to the
decreased hepatic NKT cell populations in ob/ob mice.
Therefore, we treated ob/ob mice with noradrenaline. This
significantly reduced apoptosis of hepatic NKT cells and
restored liver NKT cell populations to normal levels.
Moreover, noradrenaline induced reconstitution of liver
NKT cell populations terminated the overproduction of Th-1
cytokines (for example, TNF-a and interferon c) by other
types of cytokine producing cells, re-establishing balanced
hepatic production of Th-1 and Th-2 cytokines despite
persistent leptin deficiency (unpublished data). Therefore,
both leptin (which increases noradrenaline) and noradrenaline itself enhance the activity of Th-2 cytokines. Th-2
cytokines are necessary to antagonise the activity of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a. However, as demonstrated by studies of schistosoma infected mice with targeted
disruption of Th-2 cytokine genes, Th-2 cytokine activity is
also necessary for hepatic fibrosis to develop during liver
injury.
Noradrenaline, hepatic fibrosis, and leptin deficiency
Given this, we wondered if enhancing adrenergic activity in
ob/ob mice might permit these animals to develop hepatic
fibrosis despite ongoing leptin deficiency. To test this
possibility, we gave ob/ob mice (which have mild chronic
steatohepatitis) continuous infusions of noradrenaline for
2–4 weeks and evaluated the effects on hepatic stellate cells,
transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), a key profibrogenic
cytokine, collagen gene expression, and hepatic fibrosis.67
Noradrenaline treatment increased the numbers of activated
stellate cells, induced TGF-b mRNA, upregulated collagen
gene expression, and led to the pericellular and perisinusoidal
accumulation of fibrous tissue in ob/ob mice. Enhancement
in hepatic fibrogenesis occurred despite noradrenaline
associated reductions in proinflammatory cytokine production by liver mononuclear cells and accompanying decreases
in serum alanine aminotransferase levels. The mechanisms
by which noradrenaline promotes hepatic fibrosis are likely to
be complex. In addition to its effects on hepatic cytokine
production, adrenergic activity is necessary for leptin to
activate cultured stellate cells because prazosin, an alpha
adrenergic antagonist, partially blocks leptin mediated
increases in the growth of cultured stellate cells.67
SUMMARY
The pathogenesis of NASH is being unravelled by studies of
animal models and humans with this disorder. The necroinflammatory component of NASH appears to be modulated
by interactions among various factors (for example, cytokines, hormones, neurotransmitters) that regulate the
biological activity of TNF-a and other proinflammatory
(Th-1) cytokines. Hepatic necroinflammation is necessary,
but not sufficient, for progression to cirrhosis. Factors such as
leptin and certain leptin inducible factors (for example,
noradrenaline), that regulate the activity of profibrogenic
cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-b, dictate the extent of
fibrosis that occurs during liver injury. A better understanding of how these and other soluble and cell associated
factors regulate the phenotypes of different types of liver cells
should help us to develop rationale treatments for NASH and
other disorders in the dysmetabolic syndrome.
