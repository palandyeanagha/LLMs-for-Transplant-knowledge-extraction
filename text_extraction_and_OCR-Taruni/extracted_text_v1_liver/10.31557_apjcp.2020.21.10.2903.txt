Resection Criteria for Intermediate Stage HCC
Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 21 (10), 2903-2911
Introduction
Approximately 0.7 million people develop 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) annually worldwide 
(Forner et al., 2012; Bruix et al., 2014). HCC is a common 
disease in Asia and Africa and shows an increasing trend 
in Europe and America (Torre et al., 2015). With the 
establishment of staging systems and treatment guidelines 
that stratify patients according to tumor characteristics, 
such as tumor size and number, and patient conditions, 
including patient background and hepatic functional 
reserve, the prognosis of patients with HCC has 
improved. Moreover, the particular systems and treatment 
guidelines have provided better knowledge that helps to 
predict prognosis more accurately and to select the most 
appropriate treatment approach (de Lope et al., 2012; 
Kudo et al., 2016). The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
Abstract
Background: Hepatic resection (HR) is not recommended for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer criteria. We examined the prognostic factors of HR for intermediate-stage HCC 
and developed new HR criteria for intermediate-stage HCC. Methods: A total of 110 patients who underwent HR 
without any prior treatment for intermediate-stage HCC between January 2007 and December 2012 were enrolled at 
eight university hospitals. The outcomes and prognostic factors of HR were evaluated to develop new HR criteria. 
Results: In terms of tumor size and number, the most significant prognostic factors were within the up-to-seven criteria. 
Furthermore, serum albumin level ≥35 g/L and serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level <100 µg/L were prognostic factors 
in multivariate analysis. The 5-year cumulative survival rate of patients based on the new HR criteria (i.e., up-to-seven, 
AFP <100 µg/L, albumin ≥35 g/L) was 81.4% and the area under the curve was 0.653. Conclusions: HR can improve 
the prognosis of patients with intermediate-stage HCC who meet the up-to-seven criteria and have serum albumin levels 
≥35 g/L and serum AFP levels <100 µg/L. These factors could serve as new HR criteria for intermediate-stage HCC.

New Hepatic Resection Criteria for Intermediate-Stage 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Can Improve Long-Term Survival: 
A Retrospective, Multicenter Collaborative Study
(BCLC) staging system is most commonly used for HCC 
staging and developing therapeutic strategies (Yamakado 
and Kudo, 2014). This system primarily includes the 
following stages according to patients’ physical status 
(PS) and Child-Pugh score: stage 0 (PS 0, Child-Pugh 
A), stage A–C (PS 0–2, Child-Pugh A–B), and stage D 
(PS >2, Child-Pugh C). According to the tumor size and 
number, presence/absence of portal invasion, and PS, stage 
A (early) is characterized by single or three nodules ≤3 
cm, PS 0; stage B (intermediate) by multiple nodules, PS 
0; and stage C (advanced) by portal invasion, extrahepatic 
metastasis, and PS 1–2. Therefore, the range of the 
intermediate-stage HCC is quite extensive and the need 
for some subclassification of the BCLC staging system 
has been advocated (Yamakado and Kudo, 2014; Bolondi 
et al., 2012; Kudo et al., 2015; Hiraoka et al., 2016).

arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended 
as the standard treatment option in the BCLC staging 
system. Hepatic resection (HR) is indicated only for 
patients with early-stage HCC (BCLC A) with satisfactory 
liver function. In Japan, although TACE is the first-line 
treatment for patients with HCC in the intermediate-stage, 
local treatments, such as HR or radiofrequency ablation 
(RFA), are also recommended depending on hepatic 
functional reserve and tumor number and size (The Japan 
Society of Hepatology, 2013). Recently, several reports 
showed the effectiveness of HR for intermediate-stage 
HCC (Torzilli et al., 2013) (Zhong et al., 2013; Zhong 
et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2016). However, the indication of 
HR for intermediate-stage HCC is still unclear. In this 
study, we attempted to develop new resection criteria 
for intermediate-stage HCC considering tumor stage, 
biological malignancy of HCC, and liver function. In 
particular, the novelty of this study is that it was conducted 
using several liver transplantation criteria.
Materials and Methods
The subjects were 112 patients with intermediate-stage 
HCC who underwent curative HR without any prior 
treatment, such as RFA, TACE, hepatic arterial infusion 
therapy, or systemic chemotherapy, between January 
2007 and December 2012 at eight university hospitals. 
Two patients who died postoperatively were excluded. 
Thus, 110 patients were included in the final analysis. 
Data were obtained retrospectively. This multicenter, 
retrospective study conformed to the Clinical Research 
Guidelines and was approved by the ethical committee of 
each institution (approval number in principal institution: 
29-086). Informed consent was obtained by opt-out from 
all patients or members of their families at each institution. 
The following factors were evaluated: age, sex, 
presence/absence of diabetes mellitus, history of 
alcohol abuse, levels of albumin, alanine transaminase, 
aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin, platelet 
count, prothrombin activity (PT), indocyanine green 
retention rate at 15 min (ICGR-15), and Child-Pugh 
score. Of tumor-related factors, the maximum tumor 
size, tumor number, tumor types, and sites of tumors 
were evaluated. Furthermore, serum concentrations of 
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein-induced by vitamin 
K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were assessed. 
For the evaluation of tumor status, various criteria for 
liver transplantation in HCC, such as Kyoto criteria, 
5–5-500 rule (Japan criteria), and up-to-seven criteria were 
used, because HCC beyond these criteria progresses to a 
systemic disease. The Kyoto criteria include the following 
standards: maximum tumor size ≤5 cm, tumor number 
≤10, and PIVKA-II level ≤400 mAU/mL (Takada et al., 
2007). The 5–5-500 rule sets criteria as follows: maximum 
tumor size ≤5 cm, tumor number ≤5, and AFP level ≤500 
µg/L (Shimamura et al., 2019). In the up-to-seven criteria, 
the sum of the maximum tumor size (in cm) and the 
tumor number must be <7 (Mazzaferro et al., 2009). The 
outcomes and prognostic factors after HR were evaluated 
to develop new HR criteria.
Statistical analysis
The mean ± standard deviation of age and maximum 
tumor size and the median value and quartile range of other 
factors were evaluated. The survival rate was calculated 
by the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test. 
Moreover, using the Cox proportional hazards model, 
multivariate analysis of factors with p<0.1 in the univariate 
analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors. The 
cut-off values of continuous variables, such as albumin 
level and tumor markers, were selected by receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In addition, 
we finally decided the cut-off values that were close to 
the most significant difference and easy to memorize and 
apply clinically (e.g., a cut-off value for albumin level 
of 35 g/L is also used in the Child-Pugh classification). 
P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
All statistical analyses were performed with R version 
3.5.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 
Vienna, Austria; https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
Results
The clinical characteristics of study patients are 
shown in Table 1. The average age was 70.1 ± 7.9 years, 
and 90 of 110 patients were men. Liver function was 
relatively good, with a median albumin level of 40 g/L 
and median PT activity of 91.6%; the median ICGR-15 
value was 13.7%. However, only 14 (12.7%) patients with 
Child-Pugh B were included in the study. Moreover, the 
average maximum tumor size was 5.6 cm, and 66 patients 
had 2 tumors and 14 patients had more than 5 tumors. The 
median serum concentrations of AFP and PIVKA-II were 
35.3 µg/L and 237 mAU/mL, respectively. Regarding 
operative factors, the median intraoperative blood loss and 
operation time were 665 mL and 307 min, respectively. 
Thirty-eight patients underwent blood transfusions and 
29 patients had Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III complications 
(Dindo et al., 2004) (Table 1).
The results of univariate and multivariate analyses 
are shown in Table 2. Albumin level ≥35 g/L, AFP <100 
µg/L, PIVKA-II level <100 mAU/mL, and maximum 
tumor size <5 cm were associated with a significantly 
improved prognosis in univariate analysis (p<0.05). 
Multivariate analysis was performed by using several 
factors of age <77 years old, albumin level ≥35 g/L, 
ICGR15 <20 %, Child-Pugh classification A, AFP <100 
µg/L, PIVKA-II level <100 mAU/mL, and maximum 
tumor size <5 cm, which were p<0.1 in univariate analysis. 
The result showed that albumin level ≥35 g/L and AFP 
<100 µg/L were independent prognostic factors of HR in 
intermediate-stage HCC and that tumor size and tumor 
number were not independent prognostic factors in 
multivariate analysis (Table 2).
Next, we performed examinations using various liver 
transplantation methods: the Kyoto criteria, 5-5-500 rule, 
and up-to-seven criteria. Patients who satisfied each of 
these criteria had good prognoses (Figure 1a, 1b, 1c). 
Forty-six of 110 patients satisfied the Kyoto criteria and 
had a 5-year survival rate of 60.9% (p = 0.065). For the 
5-5-500 rule, 53 patients satisfied the criteria and showed 
a 5-year survival rate of 61.0% (p = 0.085). Although

Figure 2a, 2b, 2c).
New HR criteria were created using the above results 
and the prognosis was examined. The cumulative and 
recurrence-free survival rates were significantly higher 
in patients who satisfied the up-to-seven criteria, serum 
albumin level ≥35 g/L, and serum AFP level <100 µg/L 
(p = 0.000204, p = 0.00069, respectively). Moreover, the 
5-year cumulative survival rate of patients who satisfied 
the new HR criteria was 81.4%. In addition, the 5-year 
recurrence-free survival rate was 24.7% (Fig. 3a, 3b). 
The AUC of patients satisfying these new HR criteria 
was 0.653, which was significantly better than for the 
Kyoto criteria, 5-5-500 rule, and up-to-seven criteria (vs. 
Kyoto criteria, p = 0.006; vs. 5-5-500 rule, p = 0.014; vs. 
up-to-seven criteria, p = 0.005; Figure 4).
Discussion
In this study, we propose new HR criteria for patients 
with intermediate-stage HCC consisting of the up-to-seven 
criteria, serum albumin level ≥35 g/L, and serum AFP 
level of <100 µg/L.
Although TACE is the only recommended treatment 
for intermediate-stage HCC based on the BCLC guideline, 
several studies have demonstrated the necessity to modify 
the current treatment strategy (Kudo et al., 2015; Hiraoka 
et al., 2016; D’Avola et al., 2011; Ciria et al., 2015; 
Furukawa et al., 2017; Bell et al., 2017; Galle et al., 2017). 
Recently, several reports indicated the effectiveness of 
HR for intermediate-stage HCC. Observational data 
obtained from a study performed in 10 Western medical 
institutes on 2,046 consecutive patients with HCC who 
underwent HR suggested that HR would be effective 
for the treatment of patients with BCLC stage B or C 
HCC (Torzilli et al., 2013). Moreover, an investigation 
in Asia of 1,259 consecutive patients with BCLC stage 
B or C HCC who underwent HR (n = 908) or TACE (n 
= 351) demonstrated the effectiveness of HR (Zhong et 
al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2014). One randomized clinical 
trial (RCT) from China including patients with BCLC 
stage B and C HCC suggested that the prognosis of 
HR is significantly better than that of TACE (Yin et al., 
2014). A meta-analysis of HR for intermediate-stage HCC 
including a total of nine studies with 4,958 patients also 
demonstrated a favorable hazard ratio of 0.433 (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.394–0.475) for 5-year overall 
survival compared to TACE (Liu et al., 2015). Similarly, 
in another meta-analysis, the overall survival rate (hazard 
ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.55–0.66) was significantly higher in 
the HR group than in the TACE group (Qi et al., 2015). 
In a similar investigation of 18 high-quality studies, 
including one RCT, five propensity score-matching (PSM) 
studies, and 12 non-RCT and PSM studies, HR for BCLC 
stage B HCC demonstrated a significantly better survival 
rate (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.43–0.65) (Hyun et al., 
2018). Based on the aforementioned results, HR could 
improve the prognosis of some patients with BCLC stage 
B HCC. Several studies performed subgroup analyses to 
specifically determine which patients with intermediatestage HCC could have an improved prognosis with HR. 
One study showed that HR could improve the prognosis 
the number of patients who met the up-to-seven criteria 
was 56, the 5-year survival rate was 63.0% (p = 0.013). 
Further, the ROC curve and area under the curve (AUC) 
for each set of criteria were investigated; the up-to-seven 
criteria yielded the most favorable result (AUC = 0.586,

of patients with Child-Pugh A HCC (Lin et al., 2010). 
Another report demonstrated more favorable survival rates 
in patients with fewer than three tumors who underwent 
HR; however, no significant difference was found between 
HR and TACE for patients with more than three tumors 
(Jianyong et al., 2014). 
Recently, the need for HR criteria for intermediate-stage 
HCC has been advocated. Tada et al. concluded that HR 
in patients with intermediate-stage HCC contributes more 
significantly to prognosis improvement than TACE in 
patients with a Child-Pugh score of 5 and three or fewer 
tumors (Tada et al., 2017). Wada et al., (2016) subdivided 
patients with intermediate-stage HCC according to tumor 
number and size. Patients were classified into three groups

Figure 2a, 2b, 2c. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves Using Different Liver Transplantation Criteria. The 
area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each set of liver transplantation criteria (Kyoto criteria; Figure 2a, 5-5-
500 rule; Figure 2b, and up-to-seven criteria; Figure 2c). The up-to-seven criteria had the best accuracy (AUC = 0.58). 
based on radiological findings regarding tumor number 
and maximum tumor diameter: type 1, up to 3 lesions <5 
cm; type 2, up to 3 lesions ≥5 cm or 4 nodules of any size; 
and type 3, >4 nodules. They concluded that type I is an 
appropriate indication of HR. Kamiyama et al., (2017) 
demonstrated that BCLC stage B HCC should be divided 
based on the serum concentration of AFP multiplied by 
that of PIVKA-II to determine the patients that would 
benefit from HR. Thus, the criteria proposed by Tada et al., 
(2017) included tumor number and liver function, those 
proposed by Wada et al., (2016) included tumor number, 
tumor size, and tumor location, and those proposed by 
Kamiyama et al., (2017) included tumor number and tumor 
markers as malignant potential. The criteria in this study 
included the up-to-seven criteria, which include tumor 
number and size, albumin concentration as a measure 
of liver function, and tumor marker (AFP) as malignant 
potential. Therefore, the new criteria in this study cover 
all factors used as markers in previous reports. The 
5-year cumulative survival rate in previous studies was 
54.2% (Tada et al., 2017), 75.2% (Wada et al., 2016), and 
69.5% (Kamiyama et al., 2017). The 5-year cumulative 
survival rate based on the new criteria in this study was 
81.4%, which indicates that the new criteria can select 
more favorable candidates for HR from patients with 
the intermediate-stage HCC. Furthermore, the 5-year 
cumulative survival rate in this study was better than that 
of HR for multiple HCC within ≤3 cm and ≤3 nodules 
reported by a recent Japanese nationwide survey (70.7%) 
(Fukami et al., 2019).

Resection Criteria for Intermediate Stage HCC
Figure 3a, 3b. Overall Survival and Recurrence Free Survival Rate of the New Hepatic Resection Criteria. The 5-year 
survival rate for the new hepatic resection criteria (up-to-seven criteria, albumin level ≥35 g/L, and alpha-fetoprotein 
level <100 µg/L) was 81.4% (Figure 3a) and the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 24.7% (Figure 3b).
In this study, we used various liver transplantation 
criteria to determine the criteria for resection of 
intermediate-stage HCC. These criteria consisted of 
different combinations of tumor size, number, and 
malignant potential. When these criteria are exceeded, the 
disease is considered to have become systemic. Similarly, 
Kudo et al., (2015) and Yamakado et al., (2014) evaluated 
the criteria for molecular targeted drugs and TACE not by 
tumor number or size alone, but in combination. Therefore, 
the up-to-seven criteria (a combination of these factors), 
are an important indicator for intermediate-stage HCC. 
In addition, tumor number and tumor size were examined 
in multivariate analyses. As a result, only albumin level 
≥35 g/L and AFP level <100 µg/L were significantly 
prognostic. Since the up-to-seven criteria contain these 
overlapping factors (tumor number and size), they were 
not included in multivariate analysis.
The main points of this paper are that the up-to-seven 
criteria (the combination of tumor size and number), AFP 
level as malignant potential, and albumin level as liver 
function can be used to select patients with intermediate 
Figure 4. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) 
Curves According to the New Hepatic Resection Criteria. 
The area under the curve (AUC) of the new criteria was 
0.653, which was significantly better than for the Kyoto 
criteria, 5-5-500 rule, and up-to-seven criteria.

HCC for HR. 
The AUC when the three factors of up-to-seven 
criteria, albumin level ≥35 g/L, and AFP level <100 µg/L 
were satisfied was 0.653 (95% CI 0.56–70.74), which 
was significantly better than the three AUCs shown in 
Figure 2. Of course, there may be various treatments after 
recurrence, but it is useful that the criteria in this study 
can predict the prognosis and determine the indication for 
HR regardless of those treatments.
The novelty of the HR criteria for intermediate-stage 
HCC revealed in this study was to utilize the criteria for 
liver transplantation. The new criteria might be practical 
and meaningful because HCC becomes a systemic disease 
if it exceeds the criteria for liver transplantation.
This study has some limitations. The subjects in this 
study were selected from patients with intermediate-stage 
HCC patients because HR was the only treatment option. 
In addition, the results of HR were not compared with 
those of other treatments such as TACE. This study was 
a retrospective study with a relatively small number of 
patients. Therefore, further studies with larger numbers of 
patients, including patients who underwent other treatment 
modalities, are necessary. The need for validation of 
criteria due to advances in chemotherapy is an important 
limitation of this study. In addition, as described above, 
only one RCT for intermediate-stage HCC between HR 
and TACE has been performed to date. Therefore, since 
some background selection biases in meta-analysis cannot 
be avoided, a high quality RCT is needed in the future.
In conclusion, HR can improve the prognosis of 
patients with intermediate-stage HCC who satisfy the new 
HR criteria consisting of the up-to-seven criteria, serum 
albumin level >35 g/L, and serum AFP level <100 µg/L.
