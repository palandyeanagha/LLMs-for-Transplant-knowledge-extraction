We analyzed the clinicopathological features and therapy in 19 patients with kidney disease
accompanied by hepatitis C viral infection, including 12 patients with mesangial proliferative
glomerulonephritis (including eight with IgA nephropathy), six with membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis (MPGN),and one with membranousnephropathy. Persistent hematuria and/
or proteinuria (10 patients) was the most commonfinding, followed by nephrotic syndrome (8
patients). Cryoglobulinemia was detected in six of 19 patients examined (four of six patients with
MPGN).Analysis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNAgenotype in 13 patients revealed that nine of
them had type II genotype. All four patients with MPGN,who had serum positive for HCV-RNA,
had type II genotype. Five patients were treated with interferon-a (IFN-a) without a demonstrable
effect on renal impairment, whereas five of ll patients treated with steroids showed improvement
of the renal impairment. During the course of steroid therapy, the serum titer of HCV-RNA
decreased in 5 of7 patients. These observations suggest that HCVinfection may be associated with
several forms ofglomerulonephritis. Type II HGV-RNAmayhave a strong association with MPGN
in Japan. Steroid therapy is not contraindicated in patients with HCV-associated nephropathy if
they are resistant to IFN-a treatment.

Introduction
Following the identification by Choo et al (1) of CDNAof
hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a major cause of non-A-non-B
hepatitis, several investigators have reported a relationship
between HCV infection and glomerulopathies such as
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and IgA nephropathy (2-17). However, it is still unclear whether nephropathies are related to
HCV-RNAgenotypes, which are currently classified into at
least four groups based on their differences in the nucleotide
sequence for the core gene (18). Although several researchers
have emphasized that interferon-a (IFN-a) is effective for
HCV-infected patients with MPGN,clinical relapse is common
after cessation of the therapy (19, 20). There are few reports on
the second-line therapy for IFN-oc-resistant or IFN-oc-contraindicated patients with nephropathy.
Wedescribe herein the clinicopathological analysis of 19
HCV-infected patients with renal disorders. Moreover, we
discuss the relationship between HCV-RNAgenotype and
nephropathy, as well as the role of steroids as the second-line
therapy for IFN-oc-resistant or IFN-a-contraindicated patients
with nephropathy.
Patients and Methods
Weselected 19 patients with various kidney diseases having HCVantibodies, who were admitted to Akita University Hospital and its affiliated hospitals after it became possible for us to
detect anti-HCV antibodies in 1989. For inclusion in this study,
the classification as a clinical syndrome of renal diseases,
except for persistent hematuria and/or proteinuria, was based
on the World Health Organization (WHO)recommendation
(21). Chronic renal failure was defined as a rise in serum

creatinine of more than 2 mg/dl over a 6-month period.
Cryoglobulins were isolated from serum samples after they had
been stored for 48 hours at 4°C. The cryoglobulins were
characterized by immunoelectrophoretic studies (22).
Percutaneous needle biopsy was performed in all patients
after consent wasobtained from each patient. Renal tissue was
examined by light microscopy, immunofluorescence study, and
electron microscopical examination. The histological classification used in this study was based on WHOrecommendations
(23), although IgA nephropathy was included in the category of
primary glomerular disease. Hepatic glomerulonephritis was defined as focal capillary collapse, mesangial and lobular
sclerosis and capillary wall thickening with IgA deposition in
patients with liver cirrhosis.
Antibodies for HCVwere assayed by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay as assessed by reactivity to three HCV
regions (Core, NS3, and NS4) (24). HCV-RNAin serum was
detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 5 '-noncoding
regions as primers, as described by Okamoto et al (25); HCVRNAgenotypes were analyzed by their method as well (18).
The patients were divided into three groups according to the
therapy. The first group, the IFN-a group, consisted of two
patients with MPGN,two patients with IgA nephropathy, and
one patient with MN. Weselected IFN-a therapy for these
patients, whenthe degree of their liver dysfunction was more
severe than that of their renal symptom. IFN-a (600 MU/day)
wasadministered following the protocols approved by the
Japanese Welfare Ministry after obtaining informed consent.
The second group was the prednisolone group (40 mg/day for
4 weeks) consisting of six patients with MPGN,four patients
with IgA nephropathy, and one patient with MN.Based on renal pathological activity, including crescent, and clinical syndrome, including nephrotic syndrome, we selected prednisolone
therapy for this group. The third group was the anti-platelet
drugs or conservative treatment group. The responses to therapy
for the nephrotic syndromewere classified into three categories
according to urinary protein excretion examined at later than six
months after the renal biopsy: as complete remission (CR);
trace or negative, incomplete remission type (ICR); less than
3.5 g/24h, or no remission (NR); 3.5 g/24h or more. Both CR
and ICR were defined as "effective". The responses to the
therapy for glomerulonephritis were classified into two groups
according to the urinary protein and serum creatinine values
examined at more than six months after the renal biopsy.
"Effective" was defined as an improvementof these data
following therapy.

nosed as having MPGN.One of the patients with IgA nephropathy had mixed cryoglobulins. At the time of renal biopsy, 12
patients showed elevation of liver enzymes. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and/or ultrasound studies revealed
liver cirrhotic pattern in Patient 12, who was diagnosed as
having Banti syndrome. There was a history of blood transfusion in 7 patients, but five of six patients with MPGNhad not
received blood transfusion.
The patient distribution according to clinical presentations
and histological findings is shown in Table 2. Persistent hematuria
and/or proteinuria was the most commonfinding, with an
incidence of53 %, and nephrotic syndromewas the second most
frequent (42%). Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis,
including IgA nephropathy and hepatic glomerulonephritis, was the most commonhistological finding (12 out of 19
patients; 63%). MPGNwas diagnosed in six patients (32%).
HCV-RNAgenotypes were studied in 1 3 patients. As shown
in Table 3, type II was detected in nine of them. All fourpatients
with MPGNexamined had type II HCV-RNA.They also had
mixed-type (type II) cryoglobulinemia. Type III was noted in
three patients, all with IgA nephropathy, and type IV was
observed in one patient with IgA nephropathy.
The results of follow-up evaluations of therapeutic response
of all patients who were treated with IFN-oc or steroid at least 6
months after the renal biopsy are summarized in Table 4. No
patient showed any response to IFN-oc therapy. Moreover, four
of them still had serum positive for HCV-RNAafter IFN-oc
therapy. Onthe other hand, steroid therapy was effective in two
of five patients with MPGN,two of four patients with IgA
nephropathy, and in one patient with MN,as shown in Table 5.
Table 6 shows the changes of HCV-RNAlevel in the prednisolone therapy group. After prednisolone therapy, none of
these patients showed liver injury, and five of seven patients
demonstrated a decreased level of serum HCV-RNA,as measured by PCR.
Discussion
The present study demonstrated several clinicopathological
characteristics in HCV-antibody-positive patients with renal
diseases. First, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis including IgA nephropathy and MPGNwere the most common
histological diseases. Second, HCV-RNAgenotype type II was
the most commonform, having an incidence of 70%. All of the
HCV-RNA-positive patients with MPGNalso had type II
genotype. Third, cryoglobulins were found in four MPGN
patients and one patient with IgA nephropathy. Finally, steroids
were effective in improving renal impairment in patients resistant or refractory to IFN-oc therapy. Most of the patients examTable 2. Clinical Symptoms and Renal Pathological Findings in

ined showed a decrease in the amount of HCV-RNAin serum
after steroid therapy, unaccompaniedby any exacerbation of
liver function.
Several studies have revealed an association in HCV-infected patients with MPGN(2-1 0). The pathogenesis ofMPGN
is thought to depend on complement activation by immune
complexes or cryoglobulins containing HCVantigen, antiHCVantibodies and rheumatoid factors, although the mechanisms in the formation of cryoglobulins have not been entirely
clarified in detail (2, 3, 26). The present rinding that 67% of the
patients with MPGNhad mixed-type cryoglobulins corroborates the previous reports as to the relationship between MPGN
and cryoglobulinemia due to HCVinfection. All of the present
patients with MPGNhad type II HCV-RNA.These findings
suggest that type II HCV-RNAis strongly linked with MPGN
in Japan. Interestingly, Johnson et al (27) demonstrated that
type I and type II HCV-RNAswere the most commongenotypes in HCV-associated glomerulonephritis including MPGN
in the United States. MNas well as MPGNhave been associated
with HCV,although the pathogenetic mechanism of HCVrelated MNalso remains unclear (ll-14). Davda et al (13)
described two patients with MNin association with HCV
infection; HCVgenome was detected on the RNAextracted
from their renal tissues by PCR. Several cases ofIgA nephropathy and HCVinfection have also been reported by other
researchers (15-17). Gonzalo et al (16) described two patients
with cryoglobulinemic IgA nephropathy and HCVinfection.
They speculated that the mechanism of glomerular injury is
similar to that described for HBV-associated glomerular diseases. We have also encountered one HCV-RNA-positive
patient with cryoglobulinemic IgA nephropathy. These observations support the premise that HCVinfection mayin some
way be related to IgA nephropathy.
Manyinvestigators have reported that IFN-a is useful in the
treatment of HCV-associated glomerulonephritis (2, 3). However, HCV-RNAlevels have become undetectable in only 30 of
96 patients (3 1%) by treatment with IFN-a in Japan (28). This
resistance to IFN-a is thought to partly depend on the HCV
genotype, because type II HCV-RNAis the most common
genotype and it shows poor response to IFN-a (28). Clinical
relapses also occur in at least 50%of patients after IFN therapy
(19, 20). Indeed, the present study supports these data. It is
therefore necessary to consider the second-line therapy for
patients who are either IFN-a-resistant or IFN-a-contraindicated. Wetried steroid therapy for these patients. Fong et al (29)
investigated the effect of a course of short-term high-dose
prednisolone on HCV-RNAlevels in 10 patients with chronic
hepatitis C in the United States. HCV-RNAlevels using the
branched DNAtechnique increased in 9 patients during prednisolone therapy. HCV-RNAlevels decreased to pretreatment

values after discontinuation of prednisolone. They did not
observe any symptomsor clinical change in their patients
during this study. On the other hand, most of the patients in the
present study showed a decrease in the serum titer of HCVRNAafter steroid therapy. Zeniya et al (30) described that
patients with HCV-related autoimmune-typechronic active
hepatitis treated with corticosteroids showed no significant
elevation in the titers of HCV-RNAduring the treatment
course. Although the reason for this difference is unclear, it may
depend on the initial dose of prednisolone, race, and HCV
genotypes. These findings indicate that steroid therapy may be
preferable as a first- or second-line agent for HCV-associated
active glomerulonephritis.
