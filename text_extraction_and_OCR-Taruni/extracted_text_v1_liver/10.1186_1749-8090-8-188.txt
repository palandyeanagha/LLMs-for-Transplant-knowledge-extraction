Hybrid debranching and TEVAR of the aortic arch
off-pump, in re-do patients with complicated
chronic type-A aortic dissections: a critical report
Klaus Brechtel1†, Günay Kalender2†, Ulrich A Stock3 and Stephen M Wildhirt4*
Abstract
Background: Patients suffering from acute type A aortic dissection undergo replacement of the ascending aorta,
the proximal hemiarch or complete aortic arch, depending on the extent of the individual pathology. In a subset of
these treated patients, secondary pathologies of the distal anastomosis or the remaining distal part of the aorta
occur. The treatment of these pathologies is challenging, requiring major surgical re-do procedures with aortic arch
replacement under extracorporeal circulation and hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Methods: We report our experience of five patients with complex aortic pathologies after previous aortic surgery
treated with a single stage re-do hybrid procedure, consisting of bypass grafting of the supraaortic branches offpump, stent graft placement for endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and surgical debranching of the aortic arch.
Results: In all patients the surgical vascular grafts and stent grafts were deployed successfully, there were no
intraoperative deaths. Four out of five patients were discharged from hospital in good clinical condition. One
patient died postoperatively due to cardiac tamponade. In one patient a type I endoleak persisted leading to
occlusion of a bypass branch requiring surgical revision at one year after debranching.
Conclusion: We discuss the prerequisites, all steps and potential pitfalls of this hybrid aortic arch replacement. The
current procedure avoids cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest, which may benefit early patient outcome;
however, patient and device selection plays a key role for immediate success and midterm outcomes. In addition,
precise procedural planning and development of customized stents may help to develop this procedure into a true
alternative for conventional aortic arch replacement.

Background
Acute aortic dissection type A (AADA) remains a challenging and often fatal disease. Patients are mostly treated
under emergency conditions. Depending of the extent of
the injury, surgery consists of resection of the aortic tear
and replacement of the ascending aorta, the hemiarch or
arch replacement using extracorporeal circulation and
hypothermia with or without circulatory arrest. The surgical procedure has a favorable mid- and long-term prognosis of approximately 90% survival at one year, 72-77% at
five years, and 53-56% at ten years [1-4]. However, lifelong follow-up of these patients is manadatory because
they are prone to procedure- or dissection-related short-,
mid- and long term complications. Indeed, most of the
patients suffer from hypertension, a major risk factor that
often remains insufficiently treated post-surgery.
Typical procedure related complications are pseudoaneurysms or development of true aneurysms at the
proximal or distal sutureline and re-dissections. These
problems have been repeatedly reported with the use
of various surgical techniques including the use of glue
or Teflon-felt reinforcement of the suture lines [5,6].
Although these pathologies may occur at both, the
proximal and/or distal anastomosis of aortic replacement,
the present report focuses on distal aortic pathologies. * Correspondence: wildhirt@gmx.net †

Following aortic surgical procedures, aneurysmatic
dilatation of the residual aorta with the subsequent risk
of rupture remains the main problem long-term. An
important goal in resecting the (all) aortic tear(s) is the
occlusion of the false lumen distal to the repair. However,
in the majority of patients a chronically dissected false
lumen within the distal aorta remains perfused [1,3]. As
long as there is no clinical sign for organ malperfusion, extravasation of blood or signs for progression of dilation/
dissection no further intervention may be required. However, the treatment of these secondary pathologies is challenging, requiring major surgical intervention (aortic arch
replacement, i.e. ‘frozen elephant trunk procedure’) with
hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective antegrade
cerebral perfusion. As redo procedures these interventions
are associated with a high risk of bleeding, cerebral ischemia/stroke, visceral malperfusion and death.
The procedure and device development for thoracic
endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) led to the development of hybrid procedures for aortic (arch) repair in the
last decade. Their common concept is bypass grafting of
the supraaortic branches and ligation of the native
branches (“debranching”) followed by endovascular stent
grafting of the aortic arch with or without subsequent
TEVAR of the descending aorta. The term “partial
debranching” refers to operations with revascularization
of just the left carotid artery and subclavian artery, i.e.
by carotid-carotid bypass whereas “total debranching”
also includes revascularization of the brachiocephalic
trunk.
We adopted the concept of hybrid aortic arch repair
for the subpopulation of patients with chronic dissections after ascending aortic- and hemiarch replacement
with significant pathologies of the remnant distal aorta
and with an excessive risk for conventional repair. To
our knowledge this is the first series specifically dealing
with this particular subset of patients treated with singlestage hybrid arch repair off-pump.
Methods
Patients’ enrollment
Annually, approximately 30 patients with AADA are referred to our institution for emergent surgery. Postoperatively, all patients were enrolled in a follow-up program
including clinical examination and imaging studies to assess changes in the chronical disease process. In August
2010 we introduced the strategy of hybrid aortic arch
repair consisting of debranching and endovascular stent
grafting described herein as a complementary strategy of
our conventional redo aortic arch surgery program.
All patients requiring redo arch procedures were
discussed in a multidisciplinary board to decide for the
appropriate therapy. Prior to surgery all patients underwent
computed tomography (CT) scan, coronary angiography,
echocardiography and duplexsonography of the carotid arteries. Both procedures, conventional redo aortic arch replacement and hybrid aortic arch repair were discussed
with the patients. Based on the individual risk profile (age,
secondary organ dysfunction, vascular access site as well
as technical and anatomical considerations regarding stent
placement) the multidisciplinary board recommended the
one or the other. Between August 2010 and April 2011
five patients were enrolled for redo arch procedures applying the hybrid procedure. All patients were informed
about their complex disease process and the nonestandardized nature of the surgical procedure and gave
their written informed consent. All procedures and techniques applied are in accordance and compliance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Anesthesia and monitoring of the patients
All procedures were performed under general anesthesia
with Sufentanil, Sevoflurane and Recuronium after induction with Midazolam. Standard cardio-circulatory
monitoring with an arterial line in the right radial artery,
and central venous- and pulmonary artery catheters was
supplemented by transesophageal echocardiography.
During the entire procedure near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS) was used for neuromonitoring.
Surgical procedure: aorto-bicarotid bypass grafting and
aortic debranching
The chest was opened with redo sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) standby. In two patients (#s 1
and 3) CPB was initiated femo-femoral during sternotomy
only to empty the heart but was terminated immediately
after opening of the chest. The remaining procedures were
performed off-pump in all cases. The aortic structures
including supraaortic vessels and the right aspect of the
heart were dissected. Care was taken to dissect the aortic
prosthesis as much as possible beyond the proximal suture
line. Epicardial pacemaker wires were placed in standard
fashion. Heparin (5000 IE) was administered systemically.
An Y-shaped Dacron® prosthesis (Uni-Graft®, Braun,
Melsungen, Germany) was chosen (Table 1). With a side
biting clamp placed as proximal as possible on the ascending aortic prosthesis the first anastomosis was performed
end-to-side. Next the brachiocephalic trunk (end-to-side),
the left carotid artery (side-to-side) and the left subclavian
artery (end-to-side) were anastomosed to the smaller
branches of the prostheses using side biting clamps to
ensure residual perfusion (Figure 1). Intraoperatve angiography was employed to assess the quality of the anastomoses. The native supraaortic vessels were left open until
completion of the stent placement (see below). After
successful placement of the stent graft was confirmed by
angiographic control, the supraaortic vessels were ligated.
After placement of chest tubes and haemosthasis, the

chest was closed in standard manner and patients were
transferred to the intensive care unit.
Transfemoral endovascular stent grafting of the aortic arch
Pre-interventional CT-scan was performed using ultrafast
multi detector CT (Somatom Definition FLASH, Siemens,
Erlangen, Germany) using contrast media (Imeron 400,
Bracco, Konstanz, Germany). For interventional procedure
planning measurements were performed from axially
reconstructed 1 mm arterial phase CT images (SyngoVia,
Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Centerline measurements
were used for length detection. Orthogonal diameters

according to centerline measurements were applied for
diameter sizing. Sizing priority was focused on the proximal sealing zone within the ascending aorta. Oversizing
of the stent graft was about 10-20% with respect to the
proximal diameter. Overstenting of the aorto-bicarotid
bypass with the proximal bare stents was considered
acceptable as long as the fabric did not cover the bypass
anastomosis and the landing zone was at least 10 mm
according to pre-interventional CT. However, the origin
of the aorto-bicarotid bypass could not always be predicted and required reevaluation during the intervention.
Strong aortic kink or angled course of the ascending aorta
was accepted as relatively contraindication as long as the
stent graft delivery system reached the ascending aorta
and the proximal cone passed the aortic valve. Stent grafts
chosen for each individual patient are specified in Table 1.
Three stent grafts were standard off-the-shelf devices
(pts. #1, #2, and #5), one stent graft was customized
within two weeks prior to the procedure (pt. #3), and
one stent graft was customized during the procedure by
shortening the distal part by 20 mm. Stent placement
was performed under fluoroscopy guidance (Arcadis Varic,
Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). One common femoral
artery was punctured and a 5 french sheath (Radiofocus,
Terumo; Leuven, Belgium) was inserted. A calibrated
angiography catheter (Performa, Merit Medical, Eschborn,
Germany) was placed in the ascending aorta and the aortic
arch. The contralateral common femoral artery was
approached via surgical cut down. After placing a 11 F
sheath (Radiofocus, Terumo, Leuven, Belgium) a superstiff
wire was advanced into the aortic arch. The tip of the
wire passed through the aortic valve and was placed
into the left ventricle. The stent graft was retrogradely
advanced into the desired position. Before stent graft
deployment, rapid pacing via epicardial pacemaker wires
(160-180 bpm) was initiated to obtain a short period of
tachycardiac low output. After final correction of the
position, the stent graft was deployed. Figure 2 illustrates
the process of delivery of the endovascular prosthesis.
Stent graft placement was followed by angiographic
assessment for endoleaks and Y-graft patency. In case of
type Ia endoleak post-dilatation of the landing zone was
performed using a compliant balloon (Reliant, Medtronic,
Meersbusch, Germany). Type II endoleak was corrected
surgically by occlusion of the native supra-aortic vessels.
Low flow endoleaks were accepted in order to monitor the
hemodynamic effect.
Results
Patient demographics, preoperative status and
indications for redo surgery
Between August 2010 and April 2011, five patients
were identified with a significant pathology of the distal
aortic anastomosis. Patient demographics are depicted
in Table 2.
Each patient presented with a complex individual
disease progression. In all patients the proximal aortic
anastomosis and valvular function was intact.
In two patients (#1 and #3), the dissected arch had developed into an aneurysm. In patient #1, the arch had enlarged to a maximum diameter of 7.1 cm with alteration
of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (Figure 3a) six months
after replacement of the ascending aorta and hemiarch. In
patient #3 surgery for AADA was performed more than
seven years before. In patient (# 2), the aortic arch showed
a significant true aneurysm formation (Figure 3b). In the
two remaining patients, formation of a pseudoaneurym
at the distal aortic anastomosis was found (#s 4 and 5)
(Figure 3c). Time point of occurrence of pseudoaneurysm
was within 4 weeks following initial surgery (#5) and more

than 8 years after initial surgery (#4). Detailed descriptions
of the primary aortic pathologies and initial surgical
procedures performed as well as the secondary aortic
pathologies which developed subsequently are presented
in Table 3.
Intraoperative results
In all patients simultaneous surgical and interventional
procedures were performed successfully. In two patients
(#s 1 and 3) short periods of CPB where required for
safety reasons during redo sternotomy because of severe
adhesion of the heart to the posterior aspects of the sternum. The complete bypass- and debranching procedures
were performed off-pump.
In all patients bypass grafting between the preexisting
ascending aortic prosthesis and both supraaortic arteries
and stent graft placement was achieved without complications. All patients returned to spontaneous sinus rhythm
with stabke hemodynamics after terminating rapid pacing.
Intraoperative angiographic control revealed type 1a
endoleaks in two patients (#s 1 and 5). In patient #5 the
endoleak was successfully treated by reballooning of the
proximal aspects of the stent graft (Figure 4). However,
in patient #1 reballooning failed. The stent graft prostheses buckled at the inner curvature of the preexisting
hemiarch replacement. The resulting wrinkles caused a
migration of the stent graft distally, resulting in the persistence of a typ Ia endoleak despite repeat reballooning
(Figure 5). The endoleak persisted at 3 and 6 months
follow-up. Because of the risk of further progression the
patient was informed and treated surgically with an
elephant-trunk (Table 4).
All patients survived the procedure and where
transferred to the intensive care unit on low dose
catecholamines.
Perioperative results
One patient, #3, unexpectedly died fife hours postoperatively. During weaning from the respirator, therapyrefractory ventricular fibrillation occurred. After mechanical
resuscitation for 10 minutes, massive intrathoracic bleeding
occurred, most likely due to injury of the right ventricle
(this patient had severe retrosternal adhesions requiring
extensive dissection during surgery). There was no hint
that the bleeding occurred primarily. The actual cause
of her death however remains unclear as an autopsy
was denied by the relatives.
All other patients survived the perioperative period. In
Table 4 the durations of intensive care unit- and total
hospital stays are depicted.
Patients #1, 2 and 4 experienced an uneventful early
postoperative period, where transferred to the normal
ward after a one day ICU-stay and where discharged

from hospital 10 to 13 days after surgery in excellent
general condition. In Patient #1, the endoleak persisted
through the perioperative period without any symptoms
with otherwise uneventfull clinical recovery.
Patient #5, who had undergone initial aortic repair with
a biological valve conduit 4 weeks earlier had already
presented with multiple cerebral infarctions after the first
operation. After the debranching procedure, she developed a delirium and a viral pneumonia, both resulting in
delayed weaning from respirator. However, no new signs
for neurological impairment were found. The patient was
referred to specialized neurological rehabilitation after
successful weaning after 23 days.
Short-term follow up
All surviving patients where seen in our outpatient -
clinic three, six and twelve months after surgery.
Patients #2 and 4 had recovered properly. In Patient
#2, a small and insignificant type II endoleak via the
brachiocephalic trunk was evident despite ligation of
the vessel. As this endoleak shrank significantly during
the first six postoperative months and the diameter of
the aneurysm was consistent it was judged as irrelevant.
One year after hybrid aortic arch replacement, both
patients presented in excellent clinical condition.
Patient #5 recovered initially with the preexisting leftsided hemiparesis and a slight dysphagia. However, she died
six months after the aortic procedures due to pulmonary
embolism, apparently unrelated to the debranching procedure. All bypass grafts in Patients #2, #4 and #5 were
patent six months postoperatively.
In patient #1 weakness of the right arm was observed
3 months postoperatively. After referral to our institution on CT imaging, partial obstruction of the left
sided branch of the Y graft was diagnosed treated with
tromboembolectomy of the bypass. However, in the
further period the bypass branch occluded, likely due
to the persisting Type-1 endoleak. The patient underwent
redo surgery with replacement of both, the aorto-bicarotid
bypass and the endovascularprostheses and by a frozen
elephant trunk (E-vita open, Jotec, Hechingen, Germany)
eleven months after the debranching procedure. Recovery

of the Patient was uneventful, he was discharged from
hospital in excellent condition after 2 weeks.
Outcome classification
According to the reporting standards for thoracic
endovascular aortic repair of the society for vascular surgery [7], the outcome was classified as follows: Severe
complication occurred in two patients, #1 with endoleak
type I and branch occlusion of the aorto-bicarotid bypass,
and patient #3 with early a perioperative death (likely to
be classified as TEVAR-related).
Table 5 summarizes patient’s outcome results. The postinterventional neurological impairment and prolonged
need for intensive care in patient #5 was related to the
first aortic surgery.
The insignificant endoleak type II in Patient #2 is only
classified as a mild complication.
Technical success was not achieved in two out of five
patients, due to the endoleak in patient #1 and the early
perioperative death in patient #3.
In the remainig patients #s 2, 4 and 5 technical- and
clinical success was achieved.
Discussion
The need for re-operations for distal aortic pathologies
after repair of aortic dissection may be around 25%
within the first 5 years and even higher. In adition, reoperations bare a high risk for complication including
stroke, prolenge bleeding and death (4).
We report our experience of five patients with complex
aortic pathologies secondary to previous aortic surgery
for type-A acute aortic dissection. We performed a single
stage, re-do hybrid procedure off-pump, consisting of
bypass grafting of the supraaortic branches, stent graft
placement for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR)
and surgical debranching of the aortic arch.
To our knowledge this is the first series of re-do patients
with this complex subset of aortic pathologies treated with
single stage off-pump hybrid aortic arch repair.
The conceptional development of hybrid aortic arch
replacement is of growing interest, particularly in patients
with excessive risk for conventional redo aortic-arch surgery. While we focused on secondary pathologies after ascending aorta replacement for AADA, most series report
the outcome of hybrid aortic arch repair for miscellaneous
pathologies.
In 2010 Milewski et al. compared two cohorts undergoing either conventional or hybrid aortic arch replacement.
They presented similar outcomes and concluded that
debranching is a safe alternative for high risk and elderly
patients (>75 years) [8]. Similarly, Lee at al. compared two
cohorts undergoing either the elephant trunk procedure with endovascular completion or aortic debranching
followed by endovascular arch replacement. The authors
found similar outcomes of both procedures but reported
reduced requirement for cardiopulmonary bypass in the
debranchig group [9]. Ferrero et al. came to a similar conclusion by reviewing their series of 27 Patients with a 30-
day mortality of 11.1% and just one Type I endoleak [10].
However, these series deal with multiple aortic arch pathologies such as true aneurysms, penetrating aortic ulcers
and dissections. Marullo et al. described a series of 24 patients with DeBakey I dissections, which underwent urgent
ascending aorta and –arch replacement with debranching
as the initial procedure, 15 of whom in a second stage
underwent endovascular stent graft implantation. He
reported a low mortality of just one patient, a neurological
dysfunction rate of just 12.6% and excellent mid-term
results with respect to false lumen thrombosis [11].
These are encouraging results. However, others have
reported more critical data: Geisbüsch et al. reported a
series of 47 patients undergoing mostly staged complete
or partial debranching. The authors found an overall in
hospital mortality of 19%, even 27% among those patients with total debranching. Type I endoleaks appeared
in almost 15% and the rate of neurological complications
was 12%. They recommended hybrid arch procedures to
be performed only in high volume centers [12].
Similar with Geisbüsch’s experience, we also saw relevant complications in our patients, but these may differ
from the complications seen with conventional aortic
surgery. For instance, intra- und prolonged postoperative bleeding is a major risk for conventional and staged
hybrid arch replacement were extended cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia is required. This may be
reduced when avoiding CPB, as described here. However, due to the risk of increased bleeding in redo procedures during sternotomy standby of extracorporeal
circulation is mandatory. In fact, in two patients we
performed resternotomy using preload reduction on CPB.
Cerebral ischemia due to unstable hemodynamics,
hypoperfusion or (air) embolic events is another risk of
the conventional procedure. In contrast, in the off-pump

approach, we found very stable hemodynamics throughout
the entire procedure, even under placement and removal
of the side-biting clamp at the ascending aorta prosthesis.
We performed neuromonitoring by NIRS in every patient
(which in our opinion is mandatory) and saw no significant alterations during the procedure.
Branch obstruction may be the main risk for cerebral
malperfusion in the chronic phase after hybrid aortic
arch replacement, and may be caused by two important
aspects. First, anatomic positioning of the branch directly behind the sternum predisposes to compression.
Second, the increasing diameter of the false lumen of
the native aorta through the Type-1 endoleak may have
had an impact on branch compression. This clearly
shows, that the success of this procedure is only given
with the success of each individual step. In this particular patient, the angulation of the distal part of the
previously implanted aortic prosthesis and the native
dissected aorta was steep. Therefore, the landing zone
for the stent graft was short and the angulation
resulted in strong radial forces on the stent graft
resulting in malposition and insufficient radial expansion. We believe that the occlusion of one bypass
branch in patient #1 was due to these two factors. This
complication also has been observed and described by
others [12]. Consequently, compression of a bypass
branch after sternal closure has to be carefully avoided
and Type-1 endoleaks have to be treated early.
Optimal placement of the proximal end of the endovascular stent graft in the landing zone is the most critical point in the endovascular part of the intervention.
Positioning to far proximally may impair perfusion of
the proximal anastomosis of the aorto-bicarotid bypass
or even the coronary arteries. Placement to far distally
may result in dislocation of the prostheses and endoleak
type I. Most authors recommend a landing zone of at
least 1.5 to 2 cm to enable for secure delivery of the
prosthesis. To avoid dislocation during deployment of
the endovascular prosthesis, lowering cardiac out-put is
highly recommended, in our case achieved by rapid
pacing. Despite all these maneuvers, in two of our patients significant type I endoleaks were observed. In one
patient it resulted from incomplete unfolding of the
prostheses and was successfully treated by reballooning.
In the second patient it resulted in incomplete radial
expansion of the prosthesis due to steep angulation of
the original arch and a short landing zone of less than
15 mm resulting after implantation of the aorto-bicarotid
bypass.
With respect to long-term outcome patients require a
thorough follow-up mostly by repeated contrast enhanced CT. Stabile stent positioning, possible progression of remaining aneurysm, secondary type I endoleaks

Conclusions
The described procedure of single-stage aortic arch
debranching after implantation of an aorto-bicarotid bypass and subsequent endovascular stent grafting represents an alternative to conventional redo aortic arch
replacement and the frozen elephant trunk in patients
with chronic AADA after ascending aorta replacement.
In selected cases it can be performed completely offpump. However, the described procedure remains a major
surgical intervention with relevant risks. The main difference as compared to traditional surgical arch repair is
the avoidance of circulatory arrest and hypothermia. The
procedure requires precise interdisciplinary planning by
an experienced team of cardiac and vascular surgeons,
interventionalists and imaging specialists. The continued
development of (customized) stent grafts will reduce the
risks for endoleaks, ongoing perfusion of the aneurysm
and stent migration. Criteria for patient selection should
include the interpretation of the arch anatomy and angulation, precise measurement for placement of vascular grafts
and landing zone determination.
Conventional arch surgery, even in redo patients may
also be performed with acceptable risks. Given the development of improves cerebral protection during recent
years and the excellent results achieved with conventional
aortic arch replacement, it remains to be determined
which patient will be the optimal candidate for one or the
other procedure.
Based on our experience, we believe that this hybrid
procedure represents an alternative treatment option in
selected patients if conventional arch surgery is associated
with an inappropriate risk. Future studies with precise, individualized procedure planning using customized stents
may improve the hybrid off-pump technique to become a
true alternative to the established surgical procedures.
