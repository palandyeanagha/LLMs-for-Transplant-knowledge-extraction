Abstract
Heritable factors account for approximately 35% of 
colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, and almost 30% of the 
population in the UK have a family history of CRC. 
The quantification of an individual’s lifetime risk of 
gastrointestinal cancer may incorporate clinical and 
molecular data, and depends on accurate phenotypic 
assessment and genetic diagnosis. In turn this may 
facilitate targeted risk-reducing interventions, including 
endoscopic surveillance, preventative surgery and 
chemoprophylaxis, which provide opportunities for 
cancer prevention. This guideline is an update from the 
2010 British Society of Gastroenterology/Association of 
Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (BSG/ACPGBI) 
guidelines for colorectal screening and surveillance in 
moderate and high-risk groups; however, this guideline 
is concerned specifically with people who have increased 
lifetime risk of CRC due to hereditary factors, including 
those with Lynch syndrome, polyposis or a family history of 
CRC. On this occasion we invited the UK Cancer Genetics 
Group (UKCGG), a subgroup within the British Society 
of Genetic Medicine (BSGM), as a partner to BSG and 
ACPGBI in the multidisciplinary guideline development 
process. We also invited external review through the 
Delphi process by members of the public as well as 
the steering committees of the European Hereditary 
Tumour Group (EHTG) and the European Society of 
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE). A systematic review 
of 10189 publications was undertaken to develop 67 
evidence and expert opinion-based recommendations
for the management of hereditary CRC risk. Ten research 
recommendations are also prioritised to inform clinical 
management of people at hereditary CRC risk.
Objective
To provide a clear strategy for the management of 
people at hereditary risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), 
which includes diagnosis, endoscopic management, 
prevention and surgical care.
Aims and methods
An estimated 35% of CRC is due to heritable factors,1
with approximately 29% of the UK population 
having a family history of a first-degree relative
(FDR) or second degree relative (SDR) with CRC.2
While highly penetrant syndromes such as Lynch 
syndrome (LS), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) 
and other polyposis syndromes account for account 
for only 5–10% of all CRC diagnoses, advances 
in genetic diagnosis, improvements in endoscopic 
surgical control, and medical and lifestyle interventions provide opportunities for CRC prevention and 
effective treatment in susceptible individuals.
The purpose of this guideline is to provide an 
evidence-based framework for the optimal management of hereditary CRC for clinicians involved in 
their management, including gastroenterologists, 
nurse practitioners, physicians, colorectal surgeons, 
clinical geneticists, genetic counsellors and pathologists. This guideline was commissioned by the 
Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) 
of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), 
via the colorectal section, and a guideline chair 
selected. It is an update of the previous iteration 
of the BSG/Association of Coloproctology of Great 
Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) guideline published 
in 2010 and developed in accordance with the BSG 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE)-compliant guideline process.
The Guideline Development Group (GDG), 
which included gastroenterologists from the BSG, 
clinical geneticists from United Kingdom Cancer 
Genetics Group (UKCGG), colorectal surgeons 
from the ACPGBI, a pathologist, a genetic counsellor and a patient representative, was selected to 
ensure wide-ranging expertise across all relevant 
disciplines. Members of the GDG, and participants 
in the eDelphi process, completed a Declaration 
of Conflict of Interests (COI) form which was 
reviewed and vetted by the BSG.
A scoping meeting was held on 13 October 2017, 
and in advance of this meeting the GDG was asked 
to develop key priorities and questions.
The GDG determined that the primary measure 
of effectiveness of any intervention was a reduction of the lifetime risk of CRC, and the following 
secondary outcome measures:

Guidelines
i. Reduction in the incidence of advanced adenomas at 
colonoscopy
ii. Prevention of CRC
iii. Reduced morbidity related to CRC, or morbidity secondary 
to complications of surveillance and treatment
iv. Improved identification of hereditary CRC syndromes
v. Improved pathways from diagnosis to treatment in susceptible populations.
We sought a consistent approach in our assessment of the relative effectiveness of interventions. In principle we agreed that 
surveillance should only be offered to individuals who remain 
at higher risk of developing CRC than the general population. 
As CRC risk is not always clearly defined, as a surrogate we 
accepted that advanced adenoma yield on surveillance should be 
approximately double that in susceptible populations compared 
with the average risk population.
A relative threshold for genetic testing was agreed for people 
with a 10% or greater probability of having a germline pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene in accordance with 
previous UK guidelines.3 4 However the GDG agreed that the 
arbitrary nature of this threshold meant that it could be modified 
in cases where objective risk assessment was difficult to attain, 
and clinicians had sufficient clinical suspicion of risk.
Key questions we sought to cover included the following:
1. Which aspects of the previous guidelines require updating?
2. What is the lifetime CRC risk and optimal surveillance for 
those with a family history of CRC (where LS and polyposis 
syndromes have been excluded)?
3. What is the diagnostic yield of genetic testing and/or surveillance for high-risk populations?
4. What is the optimal gastrointestinal (GI) surveillance for patients at hereditary risk GI cancer?
5. What is the impact of high-quality endoscopy in patients 
with known or suspected hereditary cancer syndromes?
6. Should we develop gene- or gender-specific guidelines for 
surveillance?
7. What is the optimal diagnostic assessment and surveillance 
interval for ‘Lynch-like’ syndrome patients?
8. How can we improve recognition, diagnosis and treatment 
of patients at hereditary risk of CRC?
9. Which diagnostic genetic tests should we offer serrated 
polyposis syndrome (SPS), multiple colorectal adenoma 
(MCRA) and early onset CRC (EOCRC) patients (if any)?
10. When should colonoscopic surveillance for familial risk 
patients stop, because it is no longer necessary, or because 
the patient should be referred for surgery?
11. Which are the optimal surgical approaches in patients with 
hereditary CRC syndromes?
12. What is the evidence for chemoprophylaxis in patients who 
are at hereditary risk of CRC?
13. What is the evidence for the effect of lifestyle modification 
on hereditary risk of CRC?
14. What information do we need to share with our patients at 
inherited risk of GI cancer?
Twenty-three PICOs (Patients, Interventions, Controls and 
Outcomes) were developed which considered these questions. 
The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation 
(AGREE II) instrument provided a methodological framework.5
A literature search was commissioned externally, with search 
strategies agreed, and was performed by the Yorkshire Healthcare Consortium, which returned 10189 publications. Returned 
abstracts were reviewed for relevance. Additional references were 
obtained by cross-referencing and by recommendation from the 
GDG. Relevant published national and international guidelines 
were also scrutinised. After each round of Delphi, and before the 
guideline was finalised, the search was repeated and any important 
studies published since the initial evidence search were incorporated.
A modified electronic Delphi process6
 was used to develop and 
refine statements. Initial draft statements formulated by the writing 
committee were reviewed by the GDG to allow for modification 
and to identify additional references. After a preliminary discussion, formal anonymous voting rounds were undertaken using 
SurveyMonkey. Each statement was scored by each member of the 
GDG using a five-point scale. We also invited key national and 
international opinion leaders from the UKCGG steering group, 
ACPGBI, BSG, the European Hereditary Tumour Group (EHTG) 
and the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) 
to participate in the modified Delphi process. We included additional patient and public involvement in the Delphi process by 
inviting participants through the national charities Bowel Cancer 
UK and Lynch Syndrome UK. Consensus required at least 80% 
agreement, and consensus of over 70% was accepted if the GDG 
felt a statement was required for clinical practice. Where consensus 
was not reached, feedback from the GDG members was disseminated after each round to allow members to reconsider their original position.7
 Where appropriate, revisions to statements were 
made and a further voting round was undertaken in second and 
third rounds. A final (fourth) round of voting for statements where 
consensus had not been reached for 11 statements was performed 
within the GDG only.
Surveillance and molecular testing recommendations are 
summarised in table 1 and table 2 respectively. The GDG also 
developed 10 research recommendations (online supplementary 
file 1) which were prioritised by electronic voting.
The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development and Evaluations) tool8
 was used to evaluate the 
strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations made 
(see executive summary). The GRADE system specifically separates the strength of evidence from the strength of a recommendation. While the strength of a recommendation may often 
reflect the evidence base, the GRADE system allows for occasions where this is not the case—for example, where it seems 
good sense to make a recommendation despite the absence 
of high-quality scientific evidence such as a large randomised 
controlled trial (RCT).
Executive summary of key recommendat ions
Service provision, communication and management principles
► We recommend that the moderate risk category of family 
history of CRC (FHCC) is the minimum threshold for 
referral from primary care (GRADE of evidence: very low; 
Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that individuals with a FHCC, which meets 
this referral criteria, be referred to a specialist familial CRC 
clinic in secondary or tertiary care (GRADE of evidence: 
low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We recommend that patients should be referred to a specialist 
service which includes access to constitutional genetic testing 
in the presence of either deficient mismatch repair (MMR) 
(with no evidence of MLH1 promoter methylation or BRAF
V600E), or polyposis. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength 
of recommendation: strong)
► There are insufficient clinical data to develop specific 
guidance for patients with very rare conditions such as 
polymerase proofreading associated polyposis (PPAP), or 
NTHL1-associated polyposis (NAP); therefore, we suggest 
patients with these syndromes should be referred to

Prevention and lifestyle modification in familial CRC
► We recommend that individuals with LS should be advised 
that regular use of daily aspirin reduces CRC risk. (GRADE 
of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that people with LS should be offered research 
opportunities to take aspirin daily at different dosages. If 
they decline research participation they may be advised on 
their choices regarding dose of aspirin, risks and benefits of 
long-term aspirin use and ensure their medical practitioner 
is aware of their intake. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength 
of recommendation: weak)
► There is insufficient evidence of the benefit of chemoprophylaxis in polyposis syndromes. (GRADE of evidence: 
moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that individuals at increased familial risk of CRC 
should be strongly encouraged not to smoke, to maintain a 
normal body mass index (BMI), to moderate their consumption of red and processed meat, and to exercise regularly. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Quality and advanced endoscopic imaging in colonoscopic 
surveillance
► We recommend that colonoscopy is the gold standard 
diagnostic and preventative method of surveillance for 
people with hereditary risk of CRC. (GRADE of evidence: 
moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that all surveillance colonoscopies are 
performed by endoscopists who consistently achieve BSG 
colonoscopy KPI (key performance indicators) minimum 
standards, specifically caecal intubation rate, adenoma/polyp 
detection rate and comfort score. (GRADE of evidence: low; 
Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest high-quality, high-definition white light endoscopy as the preferred modality for colonoscopy surveillance. 
Chromoendoscopy (virtual or dye-based) does not offer a 
clear advantage over high definition white light examination for colonoscopic surveillance, apart from in the context 
of determining the multiple polyp phenotype. (GRADE of 
evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We suggest a repeat colonoscopy performed by an expert 
endoscopist is indicated in the event of a previously failed 
colonoscopy, with efforts made to both improve patient 
experience and to ensure procedure completion, given the 
advantages of colonoscopic surveillance. If colonoscopy is 
not possible then consider CT colonography. (GRADE of 
evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We suggest that if the bowel preparation for colonoscopy is 
inadequate or if the examination is incomplete then a repeat 
colorectal surveillance procedure should be arranged within 
3 months. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► There is insufficient evidence to recommend other methods 
of surveillance for those with familial CRC risk such as FIT 
(faecal immunochemical test), MR or CT colonography. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Lynch syndrome (LS)
► We recommend that for all people when first diagnosed 
with CRC, testing using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 
MMR proteins or microsatellite instability is used to identify 
tumours with deficient DNA MMR, and to guide further 
sequential testing for LS. (GRADE of evidence: moderate; 
Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that colonoscopic surveillance should be 
performed at a 2 yearly interval for all LS patients. (GRADE 
of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that age of onset of surveillance colonoscopy should be stratified according to the LS-associated 
gene. We recommend colonoscopy from age 25 years for 
MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers and 35 years for MSH6
and PMS2 mutation carriers. There are insufficient data to 
support stratifying age of onset of surveillance by gender.

Guidelines
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that for LS patients with MLH1 or MSH2 mutations who develop colon cancer or colonic neoplasia not 
amenable to endoscopic control, the decision to perform 
segmental versus total/near total colectomy should balance 
the risks of metachronous cancer, the functional consequences of surgery, the patient’s age and patient’s wishes. 
(GRADE of evidence: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that for LS patients with MSH6 or PMS2
mutations there is insufficient evidence for oncological 
benefit of extended colectomy over segmental resection. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
► We suggest that when abdominal-perineal excision can be 
avoided, a standard low anterior resection is a reasonable 
option to treat rectal cancers in LS patients, even though 
the residual colon is at high-risk of metachronous neoplasia. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
► We recommend that gastric, small bowel, or pancreatic 
surveillance in LS patients is only performed in the context 
of a clinical trial. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of 
recommendation: strong)
► We recommend screening for Helicobacter pylori in patients 
with LS and subsequent eradication therapy if indicated. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Lynch-like syndrome (LLS)
► We recommend that deficient MMR tumours without hypermethylation/BRAF mutation and without a germline pathogenic variant in MMR genes should undergo somatic tumour 
testing with a CRC gene panel. (GRADE of evidence: low; 
Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that if double somatic MMR pathogenic 
variants are identified, manage proband and their FDRs 
based on the FHCC. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of 
recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that if no or one somatic mutations are identified, the proband and their FDRs should be managed as per 
LS. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Early onset CRC (EOCRC)
► We recommend that in patients under 30 years of age with 
dMMR CRC, an LS constitutional panel test should be 
performed, followed by tumour testing for somatic testing if 
constitutional testing is negative. (GRADE of evidence: low; 
Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that in patients under 30 years of age with 
pMMR CRC, a constitutional CRC multiple gene panel test 
should be performed. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of 
recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that people diagnosed with CRC under age 
50 years, where hereditary CRC syndromes have been 
excluded, undergo standard post-CRC surveillance for 3
years, then continue 5 yearly colonoscopic surveillance 
until the age they are eligible for national screening. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Serrated polyposis syndrome (SPS)
► We recommend a diagnosis of SPS should be made in 
accordance with the new WHO 2019 criteria for SPS. Since 
causative gene pathogenic variants for SPS have not been 
identified, a definitive diagnosis of SPS should be phenotypedriven. (GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► Other intestinal polyposis syndromes may present with 
serrated lesions. If (i) the patient is under 50 or (ii) there 
are multiple affected individuals within kindred or (iii) there 
is dysplasia within any of the polyps, then we suggest that 
other polyposis syndromes should be excluded by gene panel 
testing before making a definitive diagnosis of SPS. (GRADE 
of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We recommend the cumulative number of serrated polyps 
from all endoscopic examinations should be used when 
applying the WHO 2019 diagnostic criteria for SPS. 
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that patients with SPS should have colonoscopic surveillance yearly once the colon has been cleared 
of all lesions >5mm in size. If no polyps ≥10mm in size 
are identified at subsequent surveillance examinations the 
interval can be extended to 2yearly. (GRADE of evidence: 
moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend all FDRs of patients with SPS on the basis 
of the new WHO 2019 SPS criteria, one or two should be 
offered an index colonoscopic screening examination at age 
40 years or 10 years before the diagnosis of the index case. 
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest all FDRs of SPS patients have a surveillance examination every 5 years unless polyp burden indicates an examination is required earlier according to post-polypectomy 
surveillance guidelines. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength 
of recommendation: strong)
Multiple colorectal adenoma (MCRA) patients
► We suggest an individualised approach to germline testing 
of patients with MCRA (defined as having 10 or more 
metachronous adenomas). Consider this testing for:
– Patients under 60 years of age with lifetime total of ≥10 
adenomas; or
– Patients from 60 years of age with lifetime total of:
– ≥20 adenomas, or
– ≥10 adenomas and a FHCC or polyposis
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
► We suggest that patients with a finding of 10 or more polyps 
(adenomas or serrated lesions) should, at their next colonoscopy, have a high-quality colonoscopic assessment with 
pancolonic dye spray in order to define accurately the 
multiple polyp phenotype. (GRADE of evidence: very low; 
Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We suggest that the endoscopic management of patients with 
10 or more metachronous adenomas, without MUTYH or 
APC gene mutations, should be individualised according 
to phenotype. (GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of 
recommendation: weak)
► We suggest annual colonoscopic surveillance for patients 
with 10 or more metachronous adenomas after the colon has 
been cleared of all lesions >5mm in size. If no polyps 10mm 
or greater in size are identified at subsequent surveillance

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)
► We recommend that colonic surveillance should normally 
commence age 12–14 years in those confirmed to have FAP 
on predictive genetic testing. (GRADE of evidence: low; 
Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that for those with FAP, intervals between 
surveillance colonoscopy may be individualised depending 
on colonic phenotype every 1–3 years. (GRADE of evidence:

► We suggest that colonoscopy screening is performed for 
individuals who have an FDR with a clinical diagnosis of 
FAP (ie, “at-risk”) and in whom an APC mutation has not 
been identified, starting at age 12–14 years, and should 
continue on 5 yearly surveillance until either a clinical diagnosis is made and they are then managed as FAP, or they 
reach the age at which they can enrol in national screening.

► We recommend upper GI surveillance for FAP patients 
starting at age 25 years. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength 
of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that for those considered at risk, where predictive genetic testing is not possible, screening with upper GI 
endoscopy is not routinely recommended but should be 
started if/when a clinical diagnosis of FAP is made based 
on colorectal phenotype. (GRADE of evidence: very low;

► We suggest that patients with congenital hypertrophy 
retinal pigmentation epithelium (CHRPE) be referred for 
a specialist ophthalmic review. Patients with bilateral and 
multiple CHRPE lesions should be referred for screening 
for FAP and considered for genetic testing and colonoscopy. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation:

FAP: Surgery, and desmoid disease
► We recommend that for patients with FAP who are undergoing colonoscopic surveillance, relative indications for 
surgery are: polyps >10mm in diameter, high grade dysplasia 
within polyps and a significant increase in polyp burden 
between screening examinations. (GRADE of evidence: low; 
Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that absolute indications for immediate 
colorectal surgery in FAP include: documented or suspected 
cancer or significant symptoms attributable to the polyposis. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
► We suggest that FAP patients should be counselled about the 
risk of postoperative desmoid disease formation. (GRADE of 
evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► Consider, for FAP patients before colectomy, determining 
genotypes or family history of desmoid disease which may 
be predictive of desmoid formation. (GRADE of evidence: 
very low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We suggest that sulindac in combination with high-dose 
selective oestrogen receptor modulators may be effective in 
FAP patients with intra-abdominal desmoids and desmoids 
located at the abdominal wall. (GRADE of evidence: low; 
Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We recommend the role of elective surgery for intraabdominal desmoids should be restricted to treating 
secondary effects of the desmoid disease, and this surgery 
should be performed in expert centres. (GRADE of evidence: 
low; Strength of recommendation: strong)
MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)
► We recommend that colorectal surveillance is commenced in 
MAP commencing age 18–20 years. If surgery is not undertaken then annual surveillance is suggested. (GRADE of 
evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We recommend that for monoallelic MUTYH pathogenic 
variant carriers, the risk of CRC is not sufficiently different 
to population risk to meet thresholds for screening and 
routine colonoscopy is not recommended. (GRADE of 
evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: strong)
► We suggest that upper GI surveillance should be considered 
starting at the age of 35 years in MAP. We recommend that 
the surveillance interval is determined as outlined for FAP. 
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak).
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS)
► We suggest that in an asymptomatic patient with PJS, GI 
surveillance by upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy and video 
capsule endoscopy commence at age 8 years. We recommend 
that small bowel surveillance should continue 3yearly. If 
baseline colonoscopy and oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy
(OGD) are normal, then they can be safely deferred until age 
18 years; however, if polyps are found at baseline examination, then they should be repeated 3yearly. Earlier investigation of the GI tract should be performed in symptomatic 
patients. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We suggest elective polypectomy to prevent polyp related 
complications. Small bowel polyps greater than 1.5–2cm 
in size (or smaller if symptomatic) should be considered for 
elective resection to prevent intussusception. (GRADE of 
evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS)
► We suggest colonoscopic surveillance should commence 
from the age of 15 years or earlier if symptomatic. The 
surveillance interval should be 1–3 yearly, personalised 
according to colorectal phenotype. (GRADE of evidence: 
low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We suggest that for those with a confirmed clinical or genetic 
diagnosis, upper GI endoscopic surveillance should start at 
the age of 18 years for SMAD4 mutation carriers and 25 
years for BMPR1A mutation carriers and those without an 
identified constitutional. The surveillance interval should be 
1–3 yearly, personalised according to upper GI tract phenotype. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
► We suggest that for those with an FDR with a clinical diagnosis of JPS and in whom a mutation has not been identified, 
screening of the upper GI tract is not required routinely but 
should be initiated if/when a clinical diagnosis is made on the 
basis of colonic phenotype. It may, however, be considered 
if there is a family history suggestive of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), even in the absence of colonic 
polyps. (GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)

Service provision, communication and 
management principles
We recommend that moderate risk of FHCC is the minimum 
threshold for referral from primary care
(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
We recommend that individuals with an FHCC, which meets 
this referral criteria, be referred to a specialist familial CRC 
clinic in secondary or tertiary care.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 82% agreement.
We recommend that patients should be referred to a specialist 
service which includes access to constitutional genetic testing 
in the presence of defective MMR (with no evidence of MLH1 
promoter methylation or BRAF V600E), or polyposis.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
There are insufficient clinical data to develop specific guidance for patients with very rare conditions such as polymerase 
proofreading associated polyposis (PPAP), or NTHL1 associated polyposis (NAP), therefore patients with these syndromes 
should be referred to multidisciplinary expert centres for clinical management.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 91% agreement.
We recommend that hospitals that diagnose or manage 
patients at hereditary CRC risk should ensure clinical pathways 
to facilitate their care, and processes to monitor the quality of 
the service.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
We recommend that individuals at increased familial CRC 
risk receive specialist knowledge and are aware of patient/
support organisations and discussion with regard to lifestyle 
and participation in research projects.

Consensus reached: 95% agreement
People at hereditary CRC risk require coordinated, timely and 
high-quality care to reduce their cancer risk and should have 
access to a full range of management options that minimise the 
risk of morbidity and mortality.9
 A structured referral pathway 
may ensure better inter-specialty communication and timely, 
efficient management of hereditary risk from primary through to 
tertiary care provision. It also facilitates an audit trail and subsequent monitoring of performance. Patients should have access 
to a full range of management options that minimise the risk of 
morbidity and mortality.9
Moreover, studies consistently report that high quality 
screening and surveillance services result in a reduction of CRC 
incidence and mortality in individuals with FAP and LS.10 Registries of high-risk patients should be linked to robust quality 
assurance mechanisms for interventions, such as colonoscopy, 
with effective recall mechanisms in place to ensure high-risk 
individuals receive surveillance procedures on schedule.
Awareness of hereditary conditions may be inadequate, 
resulting in an inconsistent approach to the management of 
these individuals.9 11 Many patients do not have personalised 
management strategies and there is a failure to provide adequate 
follow-up.12 13 Patient advocacy organisations recommend 
improvements in the detection of pre-cancerous polyps, early 
diagnosis of CRC, and personalised treatment options for LS 
individuals, who should be seen by a team of specialists.14 The 
relevance of genomics is growing in clinical practice, and is 
increasingly relevant across the cancer multidisciplinary teams, 
with improving access to constitutional genetic testing.15 Genetic 
testing and/or counselling may resolve uncertainty about personal 
and familial cancer risk and provide information to guide and 
personalise decisions about future health care in anyone with 
an FHCC.16 17 It has been recommended that a dedicated clinical champion for hereditary CRC should be established in each 
colorectal multidisciplinary team (MDT) to oversee service 
coordination and to ensure patient pathways.9 18 The establishment of these champions will be another critical component in 
establishing equity of care. We recommend the establishment of 
family cancer specialist services by CRC teams in secondary care 
to ensure local pathways for patients at hereditary risk of CRC, 
and which can arrange testing of relatives for MMR status. This 
service should be supported by commissioners and incorporate 
a multidisciplinary approach involving geneticists, gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons with links between secondary 
and tertiary care. Adherence to surveillance recommendations 
should be monitored at least annually. We suggest a minimum 
standard of ≥90% compliance. Non-compliant cases should 
be reviewed to determine whether reason for deviation from 
surveillance recommendations was clearly documented and clinically appropriate. Thus patients with a family history of CRC 
may be managed by their local hospital, and patients who require 
constitutional gene testing be managed by a tertiary care clinic, 
for example, in clinical genetics, either locally or regionally.
Family history of CRC (FHCC)
Definitions and terminology
A substantial proportion of the UK population have an FHCC 
without evidence of an inherited CRC syndrome. These individuals have a moderately increased relative risk (RR) of CRC (2–6 
fold) compared with the general population.19 Lifetime CRC 
risk may be inferred from the age of onset of CRC in affected 
relatives, and familial aggregation, that is, the number of family 
members affected with CRC.
This section refers to asymptomatic patients referred for 
optimal management of a family history of either CRC or 
multiple polyps. The GDG agreed three categories of familial 
risk (in the absence of known hereditary CRC syndromes) which 
were determined according to lifetime CRC risk and the diagnostic yield of colorectal surveillance (box 1). Familial clusters 
(or aggregations) are of affected family members with CRC 
who are FDRs of each other. The individual referred for assessment should be an FDR of at least one affected member of such 
families.
Patients with average risk include those without an FHCC, 
or with an FHCC which does not significantly increase their 
lifetime CRC risk, that is, below the level of the moderate risk

Box 1 Categories of risk in patients with a family history 
of colorectal cancer (FHCC)
Categories of risk – FHCC
► Average risk: No FHCC, or a FHCC which does not fulfil 
moderate or high-risk categories.
► Moderate risk FHCC:
– One FDR diagnosed with CRC under 50 years, or
– Two FDRs (in first degree kinship) diagnosed with CRC at 
any age, of whom the patient under assessment is an FDR 
of at least one affected individual.
► High risk FHCC: Families with a cluster of at least three 
affected FDRs with CRC diagnosed at any age, across at least 
two generations, of whom the patient under assessment is 
an FDR of at least one affected individual.

be effectively managed via national bowel cancer screening 
programmes. Those people in moderate- or high-risk categories require additional surveillance above and beyond national 
screening however (figure 1).
Assessment of tumours in the affected relatives of those with 
an FHCC
We recommend that for all patients referred from primary care 
for assessment for an FHCC, MMR status should be assessed in 
tumour tissue from a close affected family member.
(GRADE of evidence: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 82% agreement.
We recommend that a reported family history of polyposis 
should be verified by review of histopathology and/or endoscopy reports which confirm the presence of a minimum of 10 
adenomas or serrated lesions in an FDR.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 90% agreement.
Histopathological confirmation of CRC alters management of 
familial CRC surveillance in 20% of UK patients through verification of a diagnosis of CRC, multiple adenomas or other relevant features.20 Similarly review of endoscopy reports may assist 
in identification of patients with suspected familial risk such as 
those with polyposis syndromes.
When LS and Lynch-like tumours are excluded in families, 
their lifetime risk of CRC decreases. To quantify familial CRC 
risks associated with MMR deficient (dMMR) or MMR proficient (pMMR) tumours, a UK group analysed 2941 populationbased cases of CRC.21 CRC risks in FDRs were strongly 
associated with dMMR tumours, early-onset disease and more 
than one affected FDR.
In a study by Bapat et al of 3143 CRC patients, dMMR 
tumours were associated with increasing numbers of FDRs with 
CRC (p=0.002); this association disappeared, however, when 
dMMR cases meeting Amsterdam criteria were removed from the 
analysis.22
A multicentre international registry based study23 assessed 
MMR status in 33 496 FDRs of 4853 cases of CRC. In comparison with the FDRs of pMMR CRC cases the FDRs of CRC

cases with suspected ‘Lynch-like’ syndrome and with LS had a 
higher risk of CRC, but not those with dMMR non-LS. There 
was a greater risk of CRC in FDRs if CRC cases were diagnosed 
under 50 years of age, or if the tumours had clinicopathological 
features suggestive of LS.
Surveillance for colorectal neoplasia in those with a 
moderate risk FHCC
We recommend that patients with a moderate familial CRC risk 
should have a one-off colonoscopy at the age of 55 years.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 85% agreement.
We recommend that subsequent colonoscopic surveillance 
should be performed as determined by post-polypectomy 
surveillance guidelines.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
An important question is whether the adenoma detection rate 
in those with an FHCC is higher than the detection rate in the 
general population. Most CRCs develop from adenomas and 
“advanced” adenomas (AAs, defined as either an adenoma size 
of at least 10mm, villous architecture of at least 25%, or high 
grade dysplasia24) are considered to be the precursors of CRC. 
The term “advanced neoplasia” (AN) refers to the identification 
of either AAs or CRC.
The effectiveness and requirement for familial risk surveillance may be best determined by comparing the long-term 
CRC risk of a defined cohort of at-risk patients not undergoing 
surveillance with that of the general population. Theoretical 
relative risks of CRC <2may be dominated by other genetic or 
environmental effects (and may require complex and validated 
risk modelling tools to determine suitability for surveillance).25
Where long-term CRC data are not available, the findings at 
surveillance may be used as a surrogate means to determine the 
need for post-polypectomy surveillance, although this method 
is inferior. In this context, that surveillance procedure may not 
have been warranted where the AA yield on that surveillance was 
less than doubled compared with a comparable yield in a control 
population.
There is a low prevalence of CRC in studies of surveillance in 
familial risk populations. There are limited data suggesting that 
metachronous CRC risk may be higher in patients at moderate 
familial risk versus population risk.26 As AAs are strongly associated with CRC development, AAs may be considered a proxy 
for CRC risk. In studies of patients with a moderate familial risk 
there is considerable heterogeneity in the prevalence of AA with 
a typical prevalence of between 8% and 10%; approximately 
double that of those without a family history (online supplementary tables 1-GRADE table 1). There is evidence from observational studies that the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy has 
increased in familial CRC risk cohorts over the past two decades, 
consistent with improvements in endoscopic technique, equipment and quality assurance.27
In the German bowel cancer screening population (an average 
risk population) the prevalence of AAs measured between 2003 
and 2012 increased from 7.4% to 9.0% among men, and from 
4.4% to 5.2% among women.28 29 In meta-analysis,30 the prevalence of adenomas is significantly higher in individuals with 
an FHCC than in controls (OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.4 to 3.5). Many 
observational control studies of surveillance colonoscopy for 
familial risk report a lower prevalence of AAs in the average risk 
population compared with the data from this German screening 
cohort. This may be related to lower ages of familial risk populations studied, and that many of the studies pre-date improvements in colonoscopic quality standards.
There is some observational evidence that colonoscopic 
surveillance mitigates this increased risk. In a German casecontrol study of CRC patients with an FHCC, those who had 
had a prior colonoscopy had a lower CRC risk that individuals 
without a family history who had not undergone colonoscopy. In 
the E3N French prospective study of 92078 women, 692 CRCs 
were diagnosed after a median follow-up of 15.4 years31 ; women 
with FHCC who had not had a previous colonoscopy had a 80% 
higher CRC risk than those without FHCC. In women who had 
had a previous colonoscopy, CRC risk was similar in women 
with and without FHCC.
Age and risk of AAs in those with an FHCC
Projected annual transition rates from advanced adenomas to 
CRC strongly increase with age, with annual transition rates 
increasing from 2.6% in patients in their 50s to >5% in their 
80s.28 In an influential prospective study from 199432 FDRs of 
CRC patients had a risk of CRC at the age of 40 years equivalent 
to that of the average risk population aged 50 years. Notably, 
this historical study did not exclude patients with LS, and the 
increased risk conferred was predominantly in individuals with 
an affected FDR diagnosed under of 45 years.
Age is a strong predictor for adenomas and AAs in both 
familial risk individuals and controls in a series of observational 
studies. The incidence of AAs in patients aged 40–49 years in a 
surveillance cohort is equivalent to the general population,27 33
although the age of diagnosis of CRC in the affected FDR is not 
a predictor of risk of AAs. While adenomas but not AAs are more 
common in these studies, this may reflect the natural history of 
the adenoma to carcinoma sequence, whereby patients derive 
more benefit from surveillance colonoscopy from the age of 50 
onwards, due to resection of AAs.
The subdivision of FHCC risk into those with 2× FDRs who 
were affected over or under 60 years of age is not associated 
with any difference in the diagnostic yield on colonoscopic 
surveillance.34 Although this age criterion was used in previous 
iterations of this guideline35 to subdivide into “low-moderate” 
and “high-moderate”risk, no evidence was identified to support 
this differentiation.
Several studies of cohorts of patients with moderate FHCC 
have demonstrated a negligible incidence in AAs in colonoscopic 
surveillance before the age of 50 years, but an increased risk 
after this age.36–41 There is little evidence in case-control series 
of significant differences in AA incidence between patients with 
one FDR diagnosed under the age of 50 years, and those families 
with a cluster of two FDRs diagnosed at any age.
The prevalence of AAs under the age of 50 years is not 
significantly increased in patients under surveillance for FHCC 
compared with the average risk population. This supports 
commencing colonoscopic surveillance at the age of 50–55 years 
for those at moderate familial risk. As the incidence of CRC is 
increasing in younger patients, this age recommendation may 
need to be reviewed in future guideline iterations—pending 
further relevant data specifically in those with a FHCC.
Surveillance in patients with a moderate familial risk of CRC
To exclude LS in those with an FHCC, a close affected relative’s 
tumour should undergo MMR tumour testing. A pathology 
review of the relative’s tumour should also be undertaken to 
ensure that there is no evidence of multiple polyps. After this risk

Guidelines
assessment a decision about colonoscopic intervention should be 
considered.
The risk of AAs in surveillance colonoscopy (ie, after index/
screening procedure) is largely determined by the presence of 
advanced neoplasia at the index procedure.
In a surveillance programme from St Mark’s Hospital, 
London, with well-organised recall of high and moderate risk 
families, AAs and cancer were more common in families who 
fulfilled Amsterdam criteria compared with those at moderate 
risk (on initial colonoscopy 5.7% and 0.9%, respectively).42 In 
families with moderate risk, advanced pathology was particularly uncommon under the age of 45 (1.1% and 0%) and on 
follow-up colonoscopy if AAs were absent initially (1.7% and 
0.1%). With colonoscopic surveillance the incidence of CRC 
was substantially lower (80% in families with moderate risk 
(p=0.00004) and 43% in families with LS (p=0.06)) than the 
expected incidence in the absence of surveillance.
Registry data from other populations also suggest a benefit in 
selected moderate familial risk populations undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. These studies also confirm an association of 
AAs at the index procedure with advanced neoplasia in subsequent surveillance procedures (GRADE online supplementary 
tables 1-GRADE table 1). In a Swedish moderate familial risk 
cohort43 the risk of future AAs was associated with the prevalence of advanced lesions at the screening colonoscopy (multivariate analysis OR 5.22, 9%CI 2.3 to 9.94). It is of interest 
that adenomas and advanced lesions were not associated with 
the same risk factors: family history was predictive of advanced 
adenomas but not adenomas at the index screening colonoscopy.
The FACTS (Familial CRC Surveillance) randomised controlled 
trial compared intervals of surveillance in familial CRC.44 Individuals aged between 45 and 65 years with moderate familial 
CRC risk, where LS had been largely excluded, were randomly 
assigned to either a colonoscopy at 6 years or a colonoscopy at 
3 and 6 years. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no significant 
difference in the proportion of patients with AAs (the primary 
outcome measure) at the first follow-up examination at 6 years 
(6.9%) versus 3 years (3.5%). The presence of AAs at the index 
colonoscopy was the only significant predictor for the presence 
of AAs at first follow-up (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 16.87). Thus 
a 6 yearly interval was non-inferior to a 3 yearly surveillance 
interval, with the exception being that an AA at index colonoscopy predicts further advanced neoplasia at 3 years.
Surveillance for colorectal neoplasia in those with a high 
familial risk of CRC
We suggest that in high-risk families (a cluster of 3× FDRs 
with CRC across >1 generation) a 5 yearly colonoscopy should 
be performed from the age of 40 years until the age of 75.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 86% agreement.
Families who fulfil Amsterdam criteria but who do not have 
evidence of dMMR do not share the same cancer incidence as 
families with LS (ie, hereditary MMR deficiency).45 46 Relatives 
in such families were found to have a lower incidence of CRC 
than those in families with LS, and incidence was not increased 
for other cancers. These families should not be described or 
counselled as having LS. To facilitate distinguishing these entities, the designation of “familial CRC type X” was suggested 
by Lindor et al to describe this type of familial aggregation of 
CRC.45
In a prospective surveillance study of a high familial risk population32 there was no significant difference in the prevalence of 
AAs in LS individuals versus FCC-X individuals. However on 
follow-up there were no incident cancers in the FCC-X group 
versus 4.4% CRC in Lynch patients, indicating lower risk of 
interval CRC in FCC-X despite equivalent AA risk.
In a prospective pooled cohort study of 1585 patients from 
eight international centres37 families were classified as FCC type 
X if they fulfilled the original Amsterdam criteria and late onset 
(LOFCC) if they fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria apart from not 
having a cancer diagnosed aged under 50. The results for FCC 
type X and LOFCC were very similar. At baseline, 22 prevalent 
asymptomatic CRCs were diagnosed, 120 (7.6%) individuals 
had high-risk adenomas and 225 (14.2%) simple adenomas. On 
follow-up high-risk adenomas were detected in 92 (8.7%) and 
multiple adenomas were detected in 20 (1.9%) individuals, from 
approximately 35 years of age onwards. Again the presence of 
AA at index colonoscopy was predictive of advanced neoplasia 
at subsequent procedures—33% of patients with an AA at index 
colonoscopy had an AA or cancer on follow-up.
This study by Mesher et al37 indicated patients at high familial 
CRC risk should be managed similarly with 5 yearly colonoscopies undertaken from between 30 and 40 years of age with 
more intensive surveillance in individuals developing multiple or 
high-risk adenomas.
Amsterdam criteria families, where MMR testing of a CRC 
from an affected individual is not possible, may be offered 
surveillance as per LS. However such patients should be reviewed 
by a specialist service who may consider alternative testing strategies such as panel testing of affected individuals, or unaffected 
testing.
Prevention and lifestyle modification in familial
CRC
We recommend that individuals with LS should be advised that 
regular use of daily aspirin reduces CRC risk.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 90% agreement.
Long-term data from the CAPP2 RCT suggests that aspirin 
reduces this risk by approximately half as compared with 
placebo.47 The benefits of regular aspirin intake take at least 
3 to 5years to become evident. Taking aspirin for less than 2 
years’ duration does not seem to confer any benefit in reducing 
the incidence of cancer, or increasing survival in patients with 
LS.47 48
We recommend that people with LS should be offered research 
opportunities to take aspirin daily at different dosages. If they 
decline research participation they may be advised on their 
choices regarding dose of aspirin, risks and benefits of long-term 
aspirin use and ensure their medical practitioner is aware of 
their intake.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 90% agreement.
There is uncertainty about the optimum dosage of aspirin to 
recommended to individuals with LS. There is some evidence 
that long-term intake of daily 600mg aspirin can reduce the risk 
of all cancers including CRC in LS from the CAPP2 randomised 
control trial.47 There is no other high quality evidence for any 
other dose of aspirin/ length of treatment but there are studies 
ongoing (CAPP3 trial49) which aim to identify optimum dosage. 
Evidence for the optimum dose will inform awareness and 
education among health professionals to mitigate the reluctance 
to prescribe higher doses of aspirin within primary care.50 In the

interim clinicians may consider 150mg aspirin in the context of

There is insufficient evidence of the benefit of chemoprophylaxis in polyposis syndromes.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have 
been the most commonly studied chemoprophylaxis agents in 
patients with FAP, predominantly for lower GI tract disease, 
with some RCTs. Aspirin and tiracoxib have been found to be 
ineffective,51–53 although sulindac, celecoxib and rofecoxib have 
been demonstrated to reduce adenoma burden in the short 
term.54–57 A number of small series provide further support for 
these drugs and have also shown benefit from topical indomethacin.58 However long-term cancer prevention as an end point 
has not been adequately addressed.59 60 In the largest cohort of 
54 patients, published in abstract form, 10% developed cancer 
while on chemoprophylaxis.61
Other classes of agents have also been assessed, such as omega 
3 fish oils, but again the results are only short term with reduction in polyp size and number as the main endpoint.62
Celecoxib and the combination of sulindac and erlotinib 
have been reported as being beneficial63 64 for those with FAP 
and advanced duodenal disease; this was a short-term study
using polyp number and size as the primary endpoint. A 
cohort study reported outcomes of the use of Eviendep, which 
was observed to reduce polyp number and size.65 However, 
no studies have demonstrated an effect on duodenal cancer 
prevention in FAP.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression may be increased in 
JPS.66 67 There exists a theoretical potential benefit in the use of 
selective COX-2 inhibitors in JPS or PJS,66–68 but to date there 
are no trials demonstrating efficacy.
We recommend that individuals at increased familial risk 
of CRC should be strongly encouraged not to smoke, to maintain a normal BMI, to moderate their consumption of red and 
processed meat, and to exercise regularly.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
moderate)
Consensus reached: 81% agreement.
Diet and lifestyle factors are well established as significant 
contributors to up to half of all CRCs.69 70 A systematic review 
of epidemiological studies investigating the associations between 
nutritional factors, FHCC and CRC risk71 suggests that combinations of FHCC and higher consumption of alcoholic beverages, red or processed meat, or overweight/obesity increases the 
risk of CRC. There is evidence that LS individuals who smoke 
(particularly males with MLH1 mutations) have an increased risk 
of CRC. Data suggest current smokers are at significant increased 
risk of CRC irrespective of the age of initiation of smoking. Risk 
in former smokers decreased with each non-smoking year.
72–75
CAPP2 study data from 29month follow-up also indicate that 
overweight individuals with LS were more likely to develop CRC 
than those normal/underweight.76–79 Though modifiable environmental risk factors such as weight and exercise80 are common 
to both sporadic and familial CRC, individuals with familial risk 
may benefit from discussion about modifiable factors in order 
to potentially reduce their level of risk.81 82 There is emerging 
evidence of the benefit of targeted lifestyle modification in those 
with an FHCC.83
Quality and advanced endoscopic imaging in 
colonoscopic surveillance
We recommend that colonoscopy is the gold standard diagnostic and preventative method of surveillance for people with 
a hereditary risk of CRC.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
We recommend that all surveillance colonoscopies are 
performed by endoscopists who consistently achieve BSG colonoscopy KPI minimum standards, specifically caecal intubation 
rate, adenoma/polyp detection rate and comfort score.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 94% agreement.
We suggest a repeat colonoscopy performed by an expert 
endoscopist is indicated in the event of a previously failed colonoscopy, with efforts made to both improve patient experience 
and to ensure procedure completion, given the advantages of 
colonoscopic surveillance. If colonoscopy is not possible then 
consider CT colonography.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 90% agreement.
We suggest that if the bowel preparation for colonoscopy is 
inadequate or if the examination is incomplete then a repeat 
colorectal surveillance procedure should be arranged within 3 
months.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
We suggest high-quality, high-definition white light endoscopy as the preferred modality for colonoscopy surveillance. 
Chromoendoscopy (virtual or dye-based) does not offer a clear 
advantage over high definition white light examination for colonoscopic surveillance, apart from in the context of determining 
the multiple polyp phenotype.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 89% agreement.
High quality colonoscopy has been recognised as a core 
element of successful cancer prevention in sporadic patients.84
There are limited data that this may also be relevant to cancer 
prevention in LS.85 Therefore colonoscopic quality indicators 
in endoscopists performing surveillance in LS patients should at 
least reach if not exceed the KPIs required for sporadic colonoscopy, using validated measures, in particular caecal intubation 
rate, adenoma/polyp detection rate and, given that patients may 
require serial colonoscopic procedures, comfort score.86 87
Colonoscopy is less effective for cancer prevention if the 
procedure is not complete to the caecum or the bowel preparation is inadequate. Where caecal intubation is not achieved, a 
repeat examination with an expert colonoscopist is appropriate. 
Inadequate bowel preparation reduces adenoma and advanced 
adenoma detection rates.88 89 Inadequate preparation at initial 
colonoscopy led to a threefold increase in miss rate in adenomas 
5mm or smaller.90 Therefore, repeat colonoscopy within 3 
months seems appropriate for individuals at high familial risk.
Advanced imaging techniques have been proposed to help 
reduce missed lesions, especially small and flat lesions. More 
non-polypoid lesions are found in LS compared with sporadic 
patients.91 Chromoendoscopy, both dye-based and virtual, 
was recommended in recent ESGE guidelines on colonoscopic 
surveillance in LS.92

Guidelines
Tandem studies with chromoendoscopy show a consistent 
benefit (online supplementary 1 GRADE table 2)93–98; however, 
a study comparing a second pass with chromoendoscopy to a 
second white light pass did not show improved adenoma detection.94 Meta-analysis of data in sporadic patients shows an 
OR for at least one neoplastic lesion of 1.53 (95% CI 1.31 to 
1.79).99 Real world cohort data comparing white light to chromoendoscopy provides some support for improved detection 
in high familial risk patients (39% LS) (15/24 (63%) adenomas 
with chromoendoscopy versus 15/77 (19%) white light endoscopy).100 A recent large, multicentre, Spanish randomised 
parallel group study, using high definition endoscopes and with 
high adenoma-detecting endoscopists, did not demonstrate a 
significant increase in adenoma detection with chromoendoscopy in 256 Lynch patients (OR 1.34, 95%CI 0.79 to 2.28).98 A 
similar sized multi-centre parallel group RCT study in the Netherlands had similar results using chromoendoscopy in the proximal colon (overall adenoma detection rate (ADR) 33% vs 27% 
with white light endoscopy).97 At 2year follow-up there was no 
difference in ADR between the two groups, but there were four 
cancers in the chromoendoscopy group versus one in the white 
light endoscopy group. Simply combining the results for ADR 
of these two studies gives a risk ratio of 1.23 (95% CI 0.94 to 
1.60, p=0.14; Fisher exact, n=497; our calculation) suggesting 
a limited clinical benefit in terms of ADR for considerable extra 
effort, which may not translate into improved cancer prevention.
Virtual chromoendoscopy, narrow band imaging (NBI, second 
generation, Olympus) and I-SCAN (Pentax) have shown some 
benefit in tandem studies (online supplementary tables 1-GRADE 
table 3); however, this improved detection is not consistent with 
meta-analysis data from sporadic patients,101 and NBI performed 
less well than chromoendoscopy in a cohort, tandem study.102
In a study comparing different forms of colonoscopic imaging, 
chromoendoscopy was superior to white light colonoscopy, autofluorescence imaging, and narrow-band imaging for detection of 
diminutive colorectal lesions in adenomatous polyposis.103
Advanced colonoscopic imaging can assist in making a diagnosis 
of polyposis by revealing additional lesions required to meet diagnostic criteria: diagnoses of adenomatous polyposis may be missed 
if dye spray is not used,104 and there is similar evidence from the 
CONSCOP study that the identification of serrated polyps is 
enhanced through the use of pancolonic dye spray.105
In summary, a high quality, high definition white light colonoscopic examination, by an endoscopist who meets all colonoscopy KPIs, seems adequate for LS and high familial risk patients, 
with the exception of those with multiple polyps where chromoendoscopy may help define the phenotype.
Non-invasive surveillance methods for people with FHCC
There is insufficient evidence to recommend other methods of 
surveillance for those with familial CRC risk such as FIT, MR 
or CT colonography
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
In meta-analysis of 12 published studies of patients at increased 
risk of CRC (predominantly familial risk), the average sensitivity 
of FIT for advanced neoplasia was 48% (95% CI 39% to 57%) 
and the average specificity was 93%.106 A subgroup analysis of 
patients with familial risk only was performed, and the sensitivity for CRC was 86% and for advanced neoplasia 46%. Thus, 
although FIT may be close to equivalence to colonoscopy for 
the detection of CRC, AAs would be missed by surveillance with 
FIT alone.
Patients with an FHCC no longer on colonoscopic surveillance should participate in national bowel cancer screening 
programmes designed for the average risk population. Some 
indirect evidence suggests that FIT or other forms of stool 
testing methods alongside colonoscopy may potentially be a 
useful adjunct in surveillance in patients after discharge from 
colonoscopic surveillance.107
Other methods such as colon capsule108 or MR colonography109 lack efficacy in this population. Although there is some 
evidence of the efficacy of CT colonography,110 it is not clear 
how effective CT may be in the identification of serrated or 
non-polypoid lesions. Repeated CT scanning in particular may 
be inappropriate due to the risk of radiation damage to patients 
with inherited DNA repair defects. However, if total colonoscopy is not possible despite expert referral, low radiation-dose 
CT colonography with quality assurance111 is the preferred 
modality, as it has similar test performance to colonoscopy for 
CRC.110
Lynch syndrome
We recommend that for all people when first diagnosed with 
CRC, testing using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR 
proteins or microsatellite instability is used to identify tumours 
with deficient DNA MMR, and to guide further sequential 
testing for LS.
(GRADE of evidence: strong; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
LS is a condition defined by the presence of pathogenic variants in the coding sequence or regulatory domains of the four 
MMR genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Patients with 
EPCAM mutations which embrace the regulatory domain of 
MSH2 should be managed as those with MSH2 pathogenic variants. Selection methods based on family history of cancer, or 
other clinical parameters, such as the Amsterdam or Bethesda 
criteria,112 113 were used historically to identify high-risk 
patients who may benefit from interventions and/or genetic 
testing; however, advances in constitutional testing in the past 
two decades have facilitated the accurate genetic diagnosis of 
LS. A comprehensive review performed by NICE of the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of universal diagnostic testing for LS 
was published in 2017.18 We recommend the use of colonoscopic biopsies as the preferred source material for tumour MMR 
testing.114
Colonoscopic surveillance and LS
We recommend that colonoscopic surveillance should be 
performed at a 2 yearly interval for all LS patients.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 85% agreement.
Surveillance colonoscopy in LS does not completely eradicate the risk of CRC, with the well-recognised phenomenon of 
interval cancers related to multiple factors including adherence 
and timeliness of colonoscopy. However, the optimal interval for 
surveillance colonoscopy is yet to be established.
The literature around colonoscopic surveillance is mixed with 
few studies reporting on recognised key performance indicators 
including adenoma detection rate, or caecal intubation rate or 
compliance with the screening interval. A study in the UK identified that hospital recall systems, clinician or patient related issues 
affect compliance with LS surveillance intervals.115 In this study 
variable colonoscopy quality indicators were highlighted with a

Guidelines
caecal intubation rate was 92%, and approximately 10% had 
inadequate bowel preparation. In a retrospective, two centre 
Dutch study 31 interval CRCs were diagnosed in 29 patients 
with LS, within 2 years of previous colonoscopy, all of whom 
were MLH1 and MSH2 pathogenic variant carriers, and 84% 
were located in the proximal colon.85 In three of a total of five 
patients where colon examination was not achieved during 
the previous colonoscopy, the interval CRC was found in the 
unexamined proximal segment. In six of nine patients with a 
previous adenoma, the interval CRC was detected in the same 
colon segment, raising the possibility of incomplete endoscopic 
resection.
There is some evidence that earlier tumour stage may be 
observed in those with more frequent colonoscopy.116 117 More 
recent prospective data have described cancer incidence and 
survival in LS in patients undergoing surveillance.118–121 The 
incidence of CRC was influenced by the LS-associated gene; 
cumulative CRC incidence at 70 years by gene was greater 
in those with MLH1 (46%) or MSH2 (35%) constitutional 
pathogenic variants compared with those with MSH6 (20%) 
or PMS2 (0%) pathogenic variants (although with wide confidence intervals). The prognosis from interval CRC was good, 
with a 5year survival of 94% (90–98%), and a 10year survival 
of 91% (84–95%). This concords with an earlier Dutch study 
which reported a non-significantly increased risk of interval 
CRC in those with MLH1 or MSH2 constitutional pathogenic 
variants.122 In the prospective data published by Moller and 
colleagues, the interval between last surveillance colonoscopy 
and CRC was analysed; 100/145 (69%) CRCs were diagnosed 
>2 years after last colonoscopy (interval post colonoscopy range 
0–125 months).121
An observational study by Engel et al123 compared prospective 
colonoscopic data from three countries with different LS surveillance policies (Germany: annual surveillance; Netherlands: 1–2 
yearly surveillance; Finland: 2–3 yearly surveillance) and found 
no significant difference in cumulative CRC incidence or stage 
at detection among the countries. The study included data from 
16327 colonoscopic examinations of 2747 LS patients (MLH1, 
MSH2, MSH6 pathogenic variant carriers) over 23309 personyears of cumulative observation time. The 10year cumulative 
CRC incidence ranged from 4.1% to 18.4% for patients with 
low- and high-risk profiles, respectively, and was influenced by 
age, gender, LS gene, and prior detection of CRC or adenoma. 
The authors conclude that a 2year surveillance interval might 
be appropriate, and short surveillance intervals may only be 
beneficial to LS patients with high-risk factors. The findings 
of this study should be interpreted with caution, however, as 
there are some limitations including unavailable data regarding 
key performance indicators and non-compliance with countryspecific surveillance protocols.
The largest study to date has recently reported cancer risk estimates for PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers,124 demonstrating a 
small increased risk of CRC (cumulative risk to age 80 years of 
13% for males and 12% for females, compared with the general 
population risk of 6.6% and 4.7%, respectively). Based on this 
finding and data from the prospective LS database, the authors 
have suggested that extending the colonoscopic surveillance 
interval may be justified in PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers. 
However, most guidelines recommend surveillance colonoscopy 
between 1 and 2 yearly.35 117 125 126 The data regarding differences between the LS-associated genes are not sufficiently robust 
such that the surveillance interval can be stratified by LS gene. 
A lower penetrance of CRC in those with an MSH6 pathogenic 
variant is likely to account for the lower risk of interval CRC on 
surveillance. The surveillance interval is determined by tumour 
biology and the accelerated pathway of carcinogenesis in LS.127
There are no data to suggest that the speed of carcinogenesis in 
those with PMS2 or MSH6 constitutional pathogenic variants is 
different from those with MLH1 or MSH2 constitutional pathogenic variants; therefore until such data exist, the surveillance 
interval should be the same for all patients with LS, irrespective 
of the underlying LS-associated gene pathogenic variant.
Lynch syndrome: gene and gender specific guidelines
We recommend that age of onset of surveillance colonoscopy 
should be stratified according to the LS-associated gene. We 
recommend colonoscopy from the age of 25 years for MLH1 
and MSH2 mutation carriers and 35 years for MSH6 and PMS2 
mutation carriers. There are insufficient data to support stratifying age of onset of surveillance by gender.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
Outcomes from the Dutch Hereditary Non-Polyposis 
Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) registry showed that only 2/246 
(0.8%) patients with LS developed CRC before the age of 20 
years and another two between the age of 20 and 25 years.128 A 
number of other studies have confirmed that the risk of developing CRC before the age of 25 years is very low.129–132 It is 
largely based on these studies that most groups have recommended starting surveillance colonoscopy at the age of 20–25 
years.35 117 126 However, a meta-analysis of the data for MLH1
and MSH2 pathogenic variant carriers has questioned whether 
surveillance colonoscopy was justified before the age of 30 
years.133
The US multi-society task force guidelines recommend starting 
surveillance colonoscopy at 20–25 years (or 2–5 years younger 
than youngest affected relative if diagnosed <25 years) but to 
consider starting at 30 and 35 years for MSH6 and PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers, respectively.125
Ten Broeke et al described a series of 377 patients with constitutional PMS2 pathogenic variants.124 They observed that the 
median age at first CRC was 52 years (26–86 years), and noted 
gender differences in CRC risk. The cumulative risk (%) in men 
and women up to the age of 69 years was 18.8% and 10.5%, 
respectively. They recommended that commencement of colonoscopic surveillance could be deferred. A nationwide French 
study of patients with LS supports a genotype-phenotype correlation.134 There were no PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers in this 
cohort. Overall there was a cumulative CRC risk by 70 years 
of 38% in males and 31% in females. When analysed by genotype the cumulative CRC risks were 46% MLH1, 48% MSH2
and 12% MSH6. Furthermore, age (years) at CRC also varied 
by genotype: MLH1 45 (15–90), MSH2 44 (16–95), MSH6 54 
(24–85). These data are supported by analyses of a prospective 
LS database.119 121 These reports observed that there was genotype specific penetrance. Furthermore, within each genotype the 
incidence of CRC was age dependent and CRC occurred as a 
stochastic event. In the report addressing first cancer incidence 
and survival in patients with LS receiving surveillance, Moller et 
al observed cumulative CRC cancer incidence to the age of 70 
years was 46% MLH1, 35% MSH2, 20% MSH6 and 0% PMS2. 
Overall, there was no difference between gender. The most 
recent report from this prospective database120 describes cancer 
risk and survival up to age 75 years, analysing the data both by 
gene and gender. The cohort includes 3119 patients with 24475 
observation years. The previously described genotype dependent

penetrance was confirmed; of note the number of PMS2 carriers 
in this cohort is small.
Further studies are required to further stratify risk for MSH6
and PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers. Until such data are available, based on the current sparse literature it appears reasonable 
to defer initiation of surveillance for these patients. The current 
literature is sufficiently robust to recommend that MSH6 and 
PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers should have different ages of 
onset for colorectal surveillance (figure 2).
Surgery in LS patients with CRC
We suggest that for LS patients with MLH1 or MSH2 mutations 
who develop colon cancer or colonic neoplasia not amenable 
to endoscopic control, the decision to perform segmental versus
total/near total colectomy should balance the risks of metachronous cancer, the functional consequences of surgery, the
patient’s age and patient’s wishes.
(GRADE of evidence: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
Strong)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement. We recommend that for 
LS patients with MSH6 or PMS2 mutations there is insufficient 
evidence for oncological benefit of extended colectomy over 
segmental resection.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 89% agreement.
When abdominal-perineal excision can be avoided, a 
standard low anterior resection is a reasonable option 
to treat rectal cancers in LS patients, even though the 
residual colon is at high risk of metachronous neoplasia.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 88% agreement.
The decision to perform a total/subtotal colectomy or 
segmental colectomy involves consideration of:
i. The risk of metachronous CRC
ii. Survival from metachronous CRC
iii. Functional consequences and quality of life (QoL) following 
surgery
This decision regarding which operation is preferable should be 
made on the basis of individual patient factors and preferences, 
with special emphasis on the risk of metachronous CRC, age and 
the preparedness of the patient to continue colonoscopic surveillance. High-quality patient information and shared decisionmaking between patient and surgeon will facilitate this decision.
Risk of metachronous cancer
Parry et al found the cumulative risk of metachronous CRC to 
be 16% at 10 years, 41% at 20 years and 62% at 30 years after 
segmental colectomy. In contrast none of 50 subjects who had 
extensive colectomy developed metachronous CRC. They calculated that the risk of metachronous CRC was reduced by 31% 
for every 10 cm of large bowel removed. Kalady et al reported 
296 patients (253 with segmental colectomy and 43 with total 
colectomy/ileorectal anastomosis). Of the 253 segmental colectomy patients, 55 patients (25%) developed a second CRC at a 
median of 69 months after index surgery. Stages of the metachronous cancers were I-16, II-18, III-12, and IV-2. By comparison, four of 38 patients (11%) who underwent total colectomy 
developed subsequent high-risk adenomas and only three (8%) 
developed metachronous cancer.
135
A Finnish study reported the cumulative risk of subsequent 
CRC to be 20% within 10 years and 47% within 25 years after 
standard resection and 4% and 9% after extended surgery.136 A 
further study showed metachronous CRC in 6.3% of pathogenic 
variant carriers treated with total/subtotal colectomy compared 
with 27% treated by segmental colectomy.137 In meta-analysis 
much of the excess risk of metachronous CRC appears to be in 
carriers of pathogenic variants in the MLH1 and MSH2 pathogenic carriers, with insufficient data to suggest excess risk in 
MSH6 or PMS2 variant carriers.138

Guidelines
Survival from metachronous cancer
Moller et al in an international collaborative study found the 
cumulative incidence of metachronous CRC was 36% from 40 to 
70 years. Five and 10 year crude survival after colectomy for metachronous CRC was 94% and 91%, respectively, with no significant difference between the pathogenic variants of the different 
genes.119
Natarajan et al found no significant difference in survival time 
between patients undergoing extended colectomy and limited 
resection in patients with LS.139 The potential health effects in 
terms of life expectancy for patients undergoing subtotal colectomy or hemicolectomy for CRC were analysed. The 10year 
risk of CRC after subtotal colectomy was 4% and after hemicolectomy was 16% and stages of CRCs detected within a 2year 
surveillance interval were 32% Dukes' A, 54% Dukes' B, and 
14% Dukes' C (derived from two cohort studies). The overall 
LE gain of subtotal colectomy compared with hemicolectomy 
at ages 27, 47, and 67 was 2.3, 1, and 0.3 years, respectively.140
The authors concluded that unless surveillance results improve, 
subtotal colectomy was the preferred treatment for CRC in LS 
in view of the difference in life expectancy and that for older 
patients, hemicolectomy may be an option as there was no 
appreciable difference in life expectancy is this age group.
Functional consequences and QoL
In a Dutch study, no difference in global QoL was noted 
between 51 LS patients who underwent partial colectomy and 
53 patients who underwent subtotal colectomy, although functional outcome (stool frequency and social impact) was worse 
after subtotal colectomy than after segmental colectomy.141
Maeda et al constructed a state-transition (Markov) model 
to compare segmental colectomy and total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis.142 Quality-adjusted life years 
(QALYs) were calculated based on utility states for patients 
based on the colectomy they received. Multiple sensitivity analyses were planned to examine the impact of each assumption 
on model results. For young (30-year-old) patients with LS, 
mean survival was slightly better with total colectomy than with 
segmental resection (34.8vs 35.5 years). When QALYs were 
considered, the two strategies were approximately equivalent, 
with QALYs per patient of 21.5 for segmental colectomy and 
21.2 for total colectomy. They suggested that with advancing 
age, segmental colectomy becomes a more favourable strategy.
The decision regarding which operation is preferable should 
be made on the basis of individual patient factors and preferences, with special emphasis on the risk of metachronous CRC, 
age and the preparedness of the patient to continue colonoscopic 
surveillance.
Patients presenting with rectal cancer
A standard low anterior resection or abdominal perineal resection is a reasonable option to treat rectal cancers in LS patients, 
even though the residual colon is at high risk of metachronous 
neoplasia. A retrospective study of 79 LS patients with rectal 
cancer who had undergone proctectomy found a cumulative risk 
of metachronous colon cancer to be 19% at 10 years, 47% at 
20 years, and 69% at 30 years after surgical resection.143 Kalady 
et al followed 50 HNPCC patients with a primary diagnosis 
of rectal cancer treated by proctectomy. Forty-eight high-risk 
adenomas developed in 13 patients (39.4%) and five patients 
(15.2%) developed metachronous adenocarcinoma at a median 
of 6 years (range 3.5–16) after proctectomy, including three at 
an advanced stage. Overall 17 of 33 patients (51.5%) developed 
high-risk adenoma or cancer after proctectomy.

Gastric cancer
In a retrospective study, Capelle et al estimated lifetime risks of 
gastric cancer in 2014 patients with LS from the Dutch Hereditary Cancer Registry.145 Gastric cancer was diagnosed in 32 
patients (1.6%); 22 of these patients (69%) had a negative family 
history of gastric cancer. The lifetime risk of gastric cancer was 
reported to be 4.8% and 9% for MLH1 and MSH2 pathogenic 
variant carriers, respectively. None of the 378 MSH6 pathogenic 
variant carriers developed gastric cancer. The median age of 
diagnosis was 55 years (range 27–82 years).
In a recent prospective study, Moller et al reported genespecific prospective cumulative cancer risks (up to the age of 75 
years) for gastric cancer in 3119 patients with LS.146 The risk 
of gastric carcinoma was reported to be the highest for MLH1
and MSH2 pathogenic variant carriers: 7.1% (95% CI 3.5% to 
10.8%) for MLH1, 7.7% (95% CI 1.9% to 13.6%) for MSH2, 
and 5.3% (95% CI 0.0% to 13.1%) for MSH6. No gastric 
cancers were observed in PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers. The 
study also reported a 5year overall survival rate of 61% (95% 
CI 33% to 81%) for LS-associated gastric cancer. This compares 
favourably with the prognosis in unselected patients with resectable gastric cancer, who have been reported to have an overall 
5year survival of 10–30%.147
A Finnish study reported the characteristics of 62 gastric 
cancers that occurred in 570 family members from the Finnish 
HNPCC registry. There was an overrepresentation of intestinal 
gastric cancers, which was found in 79% of cases, with only 
13% of cases being diffuse gastric cancers. As the development 
of intestinal gastric cancers is thought to be closely associated 
with H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis, the authors investigated whether atrophic gastritis and H. pylori infection could 
be markers of gastric cancer risk in patients with LS. Twenty 
percent of the LS-associated gastric cancers were H. pylori positive. The median age at diagnosis was 56 years.147
Renkonen-Sinisalo et al assessed the diagnostic yield of 
upper endoscopy in a series of 73 MMR pathogenic variants 
carriers (median age 47 years).148 The authors found no early 
gastric cancers or premalignant lesions (diagnostic yield 0). A 
single screened-detected small bowel cancer was identified: an 
advanced stage duodenal cancer. No additional studies evaluating the benefit of gastric surveillance in LS were identified 
from the literature.
The cumulative lifetime risk of gastric cancer is relatively low. 
Aspirin chemoprophylaxis may reduce the risk of all LS-associated cancers in patients with LS. In conclusion, there is no 
convincing evidence to support the utility of gastric surveillance 
in patients with LS.

Small bowel cancer
The cumulative lifetime risk of developing small bowel cancer 
has been estimated to be 4.2% in patients with constitutional 
MLH1 and MSH2 pathogenic variants.149 Small bowel cancers 
have rarely been reported in patients with constitutional MSH6
and PMS2 pathogenic variants. A recent study has reported genespecific prospective cumulative cancer risks (up to the age of 75 
years) for duodenal carcinoma in 3119 patients with LS. The risk 
of duodenal carcinoma was reported to be the highest for MLH1
pathogenic variant carriers (6.5%, 95% CI 1.7% to 10.2% for 
MLH1; 2.0%, 95% CI 0.1% to 4.0% for MSH2), and no small 
bowel cancers were observed in patients with constitutional 
MSH6 or PMS2 pathogenic variants.146
LS-related small bowel carcinomas have an earlier onset 
compared with sporadic tumours with a median age of onset of 
52 years (range 23–69 years). LS-related small bowel carcinomas 
most commonly occur in the duodenum (49%), and decrease 
in frequency from the jejunum (29%) to the ileum (12%).150
Patients with LS who develop small bowel cancers have been 
demonstrated to have a better prognosis compared with patients 
who develop sporadic tumours. Moller et al, in a recent study, 
reported a 5year survival rate of 67% (95% CI 28% to 88%) in 
LS patients with small bowel cancers diagnosed below the age 
of 65.146 This compares favourably with the 5year survival of 
sporadic small bowel adenocarcinoma, which has been estimated 
to be 25–30%.151
Several studies have investigated the diagnostic yield of 
surveillance for small bowel cancers in patients with LS. In 
2010 Saurin et al compared the use of CT enteroclysis and 
video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) in 35 asymptomatic patients 
with LS.152 Histologically confirmed small bowel tumours were 
identified in three patients (diagnostic yield of 8.6%): one 
jejunal adenocarcinoma (T3N0M0) and two adenomas with 
low-grade dysplasia. VCE identified all three tumours, but CT 
enteroclysis would have missed the two adenomas.152 In a Dutch 
study, Haanstra et al investigated the prevalence of small bowel 
tumours in 200 asymptomatic pathogenic variant carriers (aged 
35–70 years) using VCE.153 Caecal visualisation was achieved 
in 95% of procedures. Histologically confirmed small bowel 
tumours were identified in two patients (diagnostic yield of 1%): 
one adenocarcinoma (TisN0Mx) and one adenoma, both located 
in the duodenum. In addition, another patient was diagnosed 
with a duodenal cancer (T2N0Mx) 7 months after a negative 
VCE (incidence of 1.5%). This suggests that VCE may miss 
some small bowel tumours.153 In a follow-up study, asymptomatic LS patients who underwent a VCE were invited to undergo 
a second VCE procedure 2 years later. A total of 155 (78%) of 
the initial 200 pathogenic variant carriers underwent a second 
VCE. Potentially significant lesions were identified in 17 patients 
(11%), which required further investigations: eight gastroduodenoscopies and nine balloon-assisted endoscopies were carried 
out, but no small bowel tumours were identified.154
In the CAPP2 randomised trial, Burn et al examined the effect 
of aspirin in 861 patients with LS who were randomly assigned 
in a two-by-two factorial design to 600mg of aspirin or aspirin 
placebo or 30g of resistant starch or starch placebo, for up to 4 
years.47 The primary outcome was the incidence of new primary 
CRCs, but the incidence of all LS cancers was also examined. 
Following a re-analysis of the data at a mean follow-up of 55.7 
months, for participants completing 2 years of intervention (258 
aspirin; 250 aspirin placebo), per-protocol analysis yielded a 
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.45 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.79; p=0.005) for 
all LS-related cancers.
The absolute lifetime risk of small bowel cancer in patients 
with LS is 4.2%; this risk is likely to be most significant for 
MLH1 pathogenic variant carriers. LS-related small bowel 
cancers have been demonstrated to have a better prognosis than 
sporadic small bowel cancers. Aspirin chemoprophylaxis has 
been demonstrated to significantly reduce the risk of all LS-associated cancers in patients with LS. Video capsule endoscopy 
has been used to successfully identify small bowel tumours in 
patients with LS. However, there have been a limited number of 
studies and the diagnostic yield has been variable (1–8.6%). VCE 
may have missed some cancers. No small bowel tumours were 
detected on follow-up surveillance after an interval of 2 years. 
In addition, a high false positive rate (11%) has been reported, 
resulting in asymptomatic patients requiring time consuming 
and invasive tests.
Pancreatic cancer
In a retrospective study, Kastrinos et al estimated pancreatic 
cancer risks in individuals (n=6342) from 147 families with 
constitutional MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 pathogenic variants.155
Forty-seven pancreatic cancer cases were reported in 31 families: 
18 patients had a negative family history (38%). The cumulative 
risk for pancreatic cancer up to the age of 70 was reported to be 
3.7% (95% CI 1.45% to 5.88%); this represented an 8.6-fold 
increased risk compared with the general population. Most of 
the pancreatic cases were observed in individuals from MSH2
families (31/47) and MLH1 families (13/47). Only three of the 
pancreatic cancers were diagnosed in the MSH6 families. The 
median age of pancreatic cancer diagnosis was 51.5 years (range 
19–85).
Prospective lifetime risks stratified by the MMR gene have 
now also been reported for pancreatic cancer. Moller et al
reported a cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer (up to the age of 
75) for MLH1 of 6.2% (95% CI 2.6% to 9.8%), for MSH2 of 
0.5% (95% CI 0.0% to 1.5%) and for MSH6 of 1.4% (95% CI 
0.0% to 4.2%). No pancreatic cancers were observed in PMS2
pathogenic variant carriers. The authors also calculated 5year 
overall survival for the LS patients with pancreatic cancer. The 
poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients is well established, 
and none of the affected carriers was alive at 5years.119
Surveillance for pancreatic cancer has been recommended 
in high-risk groups (defined as >5%), including patients from 
familial pancreatic cancer pedigrees with an affected FDR, 
patients with PJS, and CDKN2A (P16), BRCA2 and MMR pathogenic variant carriers with at least one affected FDR.156 The 
goal of screening is to identify and treat early stage pancreatic 
cancers (T1N0M0) and high-risk precursor lesions, high-grade 
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN-3) and intraductal 
papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) with high-grade dysplasia. 
Signoretti et al conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis 
of 16 pancreatic surveillance studies in high-risk groups.157 A 
relatively low diagnostic yield of pancreatic cancers and relevant 
precursor lesions was reported (3.3%) using endoscopic ultrasound and MRI as first line screening tests. A significant proportion (25%) of the screen-detected cancers were also unresectable 
or metastatic. Some patients underwent surgery for precursor 
lesions and were not found to have high-risk precursor lesions. A 
significant morbidity (up to 40%) and mortality (0.5–6%) have 
been reported for the surgical treatment of suspicious pancreatic 
findings.154 Pancreatic surveillance has not been demonstrated to 
reduce pancreatic-cancer specific mortality in patients with LS.
The cumulative lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer is relatively 
low for MLH1 pathogenic variant carriers, and low (<5%) for

MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 pathogenic variant carriers. Aspirin 
chemoprophylaxis has also been demonstrated to significantly 
reduce the risk of all LS-associated cancers in patients with LS. 
The utility of pancreatic screening remains unproven, and there 
is a danger of overtreatment with patients undergoing surgery 
for benign or low-risk lesions. There is a significant morbidity 
and mortality associated with pancreatic surgery.
Lynch-like syndrome
We recommend that deficient MMR tumours without hypermethylation/BRAF pathogenic variant and no pathogenic constitutional pathogenic variant in MMR genes should undergo 
somatic tumour testing with a CRC gene panel.

We recommend that if double somatic MMR pathogenic variants are identified, manage proband and their FDRs based on 
the FHCC.

We suggest that if no or one somatic pathogenic variant is 
identified, the proband and their FDRs should be managed as

LLS describes a subgroup of patients with CRC or other 
LS-related tumours that manifest MMR deficiency (microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or loss of MMR protein expression) 
that is neither explained by somatic MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, BRAF pathogenic variant or a detectable pathogenic 
constitutional variant in an MMR gene or EPCAM LLS cases, 
and therefore cannot be readily assigned to either the sporadic 
or inherited MMR deficiency categories, respectively.158–160
Combining data from published studies, using current diagnostic 
approaches, an estimated 59% (95% CI 55% to 64%) of dMMR 
CRC cases are unexplained and categorised as LLS.23 129 161
Cancer risks
Three studies have investigated CRC risks for patients with LLS 
and their relatives. Overbeek et al compared the characteristics 
of 76 families with a constitutional variant in a DNA MMR gene 
with those of 18 families with unexplained dMMR tumours.162
Although the mean age of CRC onset of the index case was 
comparable at 44 years, a significantly higher proportion of the 
families with LS fulfilled the Amsterdam II criteria compared 
with the families with LLS (66% vs 11%; p<0.0001).
Rodríguez-Soler et al were the first to quantify the risk of CRC 
for FDRs of CRC cases with LLS.161 This population-based study 
examined the risk of CRC in the FDRs of CRC cases with LLS, 
LS and sporadic pMMR tumours. The authors found the highest 
risk of CRC for the FDRs of the LS cases (standardised incidence ratio (SIR) for LS 6.04, 95%CI 3.58 to 9.5), an intermediate risk for the FDRs of LLS cases (SIR for LLS 2.12, 95%CI 
1.16 to 3.56), and the lowest risks for the FDRs of sporadic 
pMMR CRC cases (SIR for sporadic 0.48, 95%CI 0.27 to 0.79; 
p<0.001).
In a large family cohort study, Win et al subsequently 
confirmed that FDRs of LLS cases have a higher CRC risk 
compared FDRs of sporadic pMMR CRC cases, but a lower risk 
compared with FDRs of LS cases .23 Compared with FDRs of 
sporadic pMMR CRC cases, a higher risk of CRC was estimated 
for FDRs of LLS cases (HR 2.06, 95%CI 1.59 to 2.67), and an 
even higher risk for the FDRs of LS cases (HR 5.37, 95%CI 4.16 
to 6.94).23 119 140 155–162
Potential aetiologies
Studies have shown that up 70% of patients with LLS have double 
(biallelic) somatic pathogenic variants in the MMR genes.163–165
In a study of 25 LLS cases with unexplained immunohistochemical absence of the MLH1 or MSH2 protein, Mesenkamp 
et al identified biallelic somatic pathogenic variants (one pathogenic sequence variant and loss of heterozygosity) in 13 cases 
(52%; 8/18 in MLH1 and 5/7 in MSH2).165 Other studies have 
subsequently confirmed the presence of a high proportion of 
biallelic somatic pathogenic variant LLS cases. In a study of 36 
LLS cases, Geurts-Giele et al found double somatic pathogenic 
variants in 21 cases (58%; 16/21 in MLH1 and 5/12 in MSH2).166
In a study of 32 LLS cases, Haraldsdottir et al identified double 
somatic pathogenic variants in 22 cases (69%; seven for MLH1, 
11 for MSH2, three for MSH6 and one for PMS2).164
Biallelic somatic pathogenic variants may be in the form of 
point pathogenic variants coupled with loss of heterozygosity, or 
another point pathogenic variant. Double variant somatic pathogenic variants are likely to be in trans (one on each allele), and 
therefore if identified provide a potential explanation for the 
tumour MMR deficiency in patients with LLS. A recent study 
has shown that a significant proportion of LLS cases may also 
be explained by false positive screening results, caused by an 
incorrect interpretation of MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
results. The authors found discordant findings on IHC and MSI 
in six out 32 LLS cases (19%).164 However, there remains a 
possibility that some patients with LLS may actually have LS, 
due to constitutional pathogenic variants in the MMR genes that 
are not detected using current diagnostic methods, for example, 
pathogenic variants within regulatory/promoter regions and 
complex structural variants.158 Finally some patients with LLS 
may carry constitutional or somatic pathogenic variants in other 
genes, which may explain the deficient MMR tumour phenotype 
and/or occur in conjunction with somatic pathogenic variants 
in the MMR genes.167–169 Jasen et al investigated 62 LLS cases 
using gene panel sequencing including the POLE, POLD1 and 
MMR genes. The authors found somatic (n=7) or constitutional 
variants (n=2) in the POLE/POLD1 exonuclease domain in nine 
tumours (14.5%), which showed an ultramutated phenotype. 
Six of these cases also were found to carry somatic MMR variants.169 In a study by Morak et al, MUTYH diagnostic testing was 
carried out in 85 patients with LLS and biallelic constitutional 
pathogenic variants were found in one patient (1.18%).167
Consequently, LLS cases have been found to have heterogeneous aetiologies, ranging from biallelic somatic pathogenic 
variants to unidentifiable constitutional pathogenic variants in 
MMR genes. This is likely to explain the intermediate cancer 
risks, which have been reported for the FDRs of LLS cases, and 
has implications for the clinical management of LLS families.
Thus double somatic pathogenic variants in the MMR 
genes may explain up to 70% of LLS cases. Therefore, tumour 
sequencing of the DNA MMR genes should be undertaken in 
LLS cases, as this would help guide genetic counselling and the 
management recommendations for LLS cases and their FDRs 
(figure 3). If double somatic pathogenic variants are identified, 
we would recommend that these patients and their FDRs be 
managed based on the FHCC, and not as LS. However, if no 
somatic pathogenic variants or only one somatic pathogenic 
variant or loss of heterozygosity of one allele is identified we

the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines170 and may help reduce variability in practice in the UK.171

Several studies have sought to define the prevalence and 
spectrum of constitutional cancer predisposition gene pathogenic variants among patients diagnosed with early-onset CRC 
(EOCRC), defined most commonly as CRC onset below age 50 
years.172–174
In a retrospective cohort of very young patients (age 35 or 
younger) with CRC referred for genetic evaluation, syndromespecific genetic testing guided by patient phenotype and family 
history, identified highly penetrant CRC syndromes in 35% of 
patients (67 of 193; 23 LS, 22 pathogenic variant-negative LS, 
16 FAP, two constitutional MMR deficiency (CMMRD), two 
MAP, and one Li-Fraumeni syndrome). LS (23.3%; including 
patients with unexplained MMR deficiency, variants of uncertain significance, and incomplete LS investigations) and FAP 
(8.3%) were the most commonly identified CRC syndromes173
In a prospective cohort, panel testing of 25 cancer predisposition genes (APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, 
BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK2, EPCAM, MLH1, 
MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, 
RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11, TP53) was performed in 450 patients 
diagnosed with early-onset CRC (aged <50). Forty-eight patients 
(10.7%) had dMMR tumours and 402 (89.3%) had pMMR 
tumours. Sixteen percent of patients (72 of 450) were found to 
have a pathogenic variant in at least one cancer predisposition 
gene.172
Of the 48 patients with dMMR tumours, 40 patients (83.3%) 
had at least one constitutional pathogenic variant: 37 patient 
had LS (13 MLH1, 16 MSH2, one MSH2/monoallelic MUTYH, 
two MSH6, five PMS2), one patient had the low penetrant APC
c.3920T>A, p.I1307K variant and a PMS2 variant of uncertain 
significance, and two patients had biallelic MUTYH pathogenic 
variants. Of the 402 patients with pMMR tumours, 32 (8%) 
had at least one constitutional pathogenic variant in a cancer 
predisposition gene: nine (2.2%) patients had pathogenic variants in high penetrant CRC predisposition genes (five APC, 
one APC/PMS2, two biallelic MUTYH pathogenic variants), 
13 patients had pathogenic variants in genes not traditionally 
linked with CRC susceptibility (three ATM, one TM/CHEK2, 
two BRCA1, four BRCA2, one CDKN2A and two PALB2), three 
patients had the low penetrant APC c.3920T>A, p.I1307K 
variant, and seven patients had monoallelic MUTYH pathogenic 
variants.172
A constitutional pathogenic variant in a high penetrance CRC 
gene was identified in 22% of patients with CRC diagnosed 
between 20–29 years (4/18): two MSH2 pathogenic variants in 
patients with dMMR tumours and two APC pathogenic variants 
in patients with pMMR tumours.172 Of note, in those patients 
with a pathogenic variant identified in a high penetrance gene 
over the age of 30 years, all either had a significant family history, 
multiple primaries or exhibited dMMR on tumour testing.

CRC (aged <50) reported comparable findings. In this study,

430 patients with early-onset CRC were referred for genetic 
assessment at a single tertiary care cancer centre from 1998 until 
2015. Of the 430 patients, 41 had an dMMR tumour (9.5%), 
161 had an Microsatellite stable (MSS) tumour (37.3%), and 
228 had tumours with an unknown MMR status (53%). Clinical constitutional sequencing in 315 patients, based on their 
personal and family history, identified cancer predisposition 
gene pathogenic variants in 79 patients (18% of entire cohort, 
25% of patients who underwent clinical sequencing), although 
five were in genes not associated with CRC syndromes. Fifty-six 
patients had a pathogenic variant in a DNA MMR gene (25 
MSH2, 24 MLH1, five MSH6 and two PMS2), 10 in APC, eight 
in MUTYH (seven biallelic pathogenic variants) and two in 
SMAD4. Three patients were found to carry pathogenic variants 
in other cancer predisposition genes (one TP53, one BRCA1 and 
one CHEK2).174
In addition, 117 patients who had uninformative clinical evaluations underwent research-based next generation sequencing 
(NGS) using a multigene panel. This identified constitutional 
cancer predisposition pathogenic variants in six other patients 
(one PMS2, one MSH6, one MUTYH, one POLE, one APC
and one TP53). In total, 85 patients (20%; 85/430) with early 
onset-CRC were found to carry a pathogenic variant in a constitutional cancer predisposition gene. However, only 79 were in 
genes associated with bowel cancer. LS was the most common 
genetic diagnosis (58/85; 68%). Seventeen patients with a 
constitutional MMR pathogenic variant had a dMMR tumour, 
37 patients had a tumour with unknown MMR status and four 
(7%) patients had a pMMR tumour.174
In conclusion
► The prevalence of cancer predisposition gene pathogenic 
variants in patients with early onset CRC (age <50) has been 
reported to range from approximately 15% to 20%. LS is 
the most common genetic diagnosis, accounts for up to 68% 
of cancer predisposition pathogenic variants in patients with 
early onset CRC (age <50 years), and the vast majority will 
have dMMR tumours.
► In patients with pMMR tumours, the most common genetic 
diagnosis is an adenomatous polyposis syndrome (FAP and 
MAP), and the prevalence of associated constitutional pathogenic variants has been reported to reach the 10% threshold 
for patients diagnosed with CRC below the age of 30.
► In patients with pMMR tumours between the age of 30 and 
50 years at diagnosis of CRC, a genetic diagnosis may be 
suspected on the basis of FHCC or other clinical parameters. Altering the threshold for genetic testing in this patient 
cohort also needs to be balanced between clinical need 
and the ethical and logistical considerations of population 
testing.
Colonoscopic surveillance in EOCRC
We suggest that people diagnosed with CRC under the age of 50
years, where hereditary CRC syndromes have been excluded, 
undergo standard post-CRC surveillance for 3 years, then 
continue 5 yearly colonoscopic surveillance until the age they 
are eligible for national screening.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 80% agreement.
The risk of metachronous CRC is highest during the 36 months 
after surgery; subsequently this risk decreases.175 The most 
plausible explanation is that many early, apparently metachronous cancers are actually due to prevalent cancers or advanced 
adenomas missed at the time of the primary CRC diagnosis. As a 
consequence, new guidelines (in development) for sporadic CRC 
may recommend that standard post-CRC colonoscopic surveillance cease after 3 years.
Recently published, large, population-based cancer registry 
studies, including ones that specifically excluded patients with 
LS,176 177 recommend closer surveillance in high-risk populations, however.
There have been no studies specifically assessing metachronous CRC risk or the role of colonoscopic surveillance in 
EOCRC patients. However, when patients with hereditary CRC 
syndromes are excluded from CRC cohorts there is no evidence 
that metachronous CRC risk is significantly different from the 
sporadic population. Nevertheless, it may not be appropriate to 
discharge EOCRC cases from surveillance after 3 years in the 
absence of published surveillance outcome data. Thus, it may be 
considered prudent to offer 5 yearly colonoscopic surveillance 
until they are eligible for national screening in patients where LS 
and polyposis have been excluded.
Serrated polyposis syndrome
Definition
► 2019 Updated WHO clinical criteria for the diagnosis of 
serrated polyposis178
Criterion 1
► At least 5 serrated lesions/polyps proximal to the rectum all 
being ≥ 5 mm in size, with 2 or more ≥ 10 mm in size
Criterion 2
► More than 20 serrated lesions/polyps of any size distributed 
throughout the large bowel, with at least 5 proximal to the 
rectum
Any histological subtype of serrated lesion/polyp (hyperplastic polyp, 
sessile serrated lesion without or with dysplasia, traditional serrated 
adenoma, and unclassified serrated adenoma) is included in the final 
polyp count. The polyp count is cumulative over multiple colonoscopies
Diagnosis
We recommend a diagnosis of SPS should be made in accordance 
with the new WHO 2019 criteria for SPS. Since causative gene 
pathogenic variants for SPS have not been identified, a definitive diagnosis of SPS should be phenotype-driven.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
Other intestinal polyposis syndromes may present with 
serrated lesions. If (i) the patient is under 50 or (ii) there are 
multiple affected individuals within a kindred or (iii) there 
is dysplasia within any of the polyps, then other polyposis 
syndromes should be excluded by gene panel testing before 
making a definitive diagnosis of SPS.
(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 90% agreement.
We recommend the cumulative number of serrated polyps 
from all endoscopic examinations should be used when applying 
the WHO 2019 diagnostic criteria for SPS.

SPS most probably comprises a phenotypically and genetically 
heterogeneous group of diseases. The phenotypic criteria for a 
diagnosis of SPS have recently been revised by the WHO in 2019 
to include the following: (1) at least five serrated polyps proximal to the rectum, all >5mm in size with at least two >10mm 
in size; (2) at least 20 serrated polyps (of any size) with at least 
five located proximal to the rectum.178 Fulfilment of either criterion is sufficient for a diagnosis of SPS. Importantly, the previous 
WHO 2010 criterion 2, which required the presence of just one 
serrated lesion in a patient who has an FDR with SPS, has been 
removed. Given that the prevalence of serrated lesions in the 
Western population may be up to 39%, most of which will be 
sporadic, the chances of a false positive diagnosis using this criterion were high.
The prevalence of SPS in the West is generally considered to 
be around 1:3000 in screening populations. This may change as 
awareness of the condition among clinicians increases. Egoavil et 
al179 found that patients with multiple serrated polyps but failing 
to fulfil the WHO criteria had a similar risk of CRC as those 
who did fulfil the criteria. Dovetailing with this to some degree 
(and possibly explaining this), Crowder et al180 concluded that 
SPS was underdiagnosed due to failure to consider cumulative 
polyp numbers (rather than at a single episode). By evaluating 
“cumulative pathology” in a cohort of 927 consecutive patients 
undergoing colonoscopy, they found that up to 1.8% of patients 
with a serrated lesion at first colonoscopy eventually fulfilled the 
criteria for SPS.
Patients with SPS have an overall lifetime risk of CRC of 
approximately 7–70%181 and there is an increased risk in FDRs 
of patients with SPS. The risk of CRC thus may be reduced with 
appropriate management.181 182 There is an increased risk of CRC 
in FDRs of patients with SPS, but it does not follow a classical 
Mendelian pattern of inheritance. A single causative gene has 
not been identified and there is phenotypic overlap with some 
well characterised intestinal polyposis syndromes (MUTYHassociated polyposis, hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome, 
attenuated FAP). Most, but not all, of the tumours arising in SPS 
follow the serrated neoplasia pathway characterised by microsatellite instability (due to MLH1 promoter methylation) and BRAF
pathogenic variant.183 This raises the possibility of accelerated 
tumorigenesis as well as phenotypic overlap with LS. Recently, 
constitutional truncating pathogenic variant in RNF43 pathogenic variant has been identified and shown to segregate with 
phenotype in one kindred with SPS.184 185 The same pathogenic 
variant was also identified in two patients in a separate study.
In the absence of a single causative gene (and the possibility 
that some forms of SPS may be polygenic in nature), the diagnosis of SPS should be phenotype-driven. Given the overlap 
with other well-defined syndromes, these should be excluded 
in all patients in whom a diagnosis of SPS is made. A specific 
gene panel for SPS may include testing for RNF43 and GREM1; 
however the frequency of these pathogenic variants is too low to 
recommend routinely.186
Colonoscopic surveillance in SPS
We recommend that patients with SPS should have colonoscopic surveillance yearly once the colon has been cleared of ALL
lesions >5mm in size. If no polyps ≥10mm in size are identified at subsequent surveillance examinations the interval can be 
extended to 2yearly
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 94% agreement.
Colonoscopic surveillance is currently recommended following 
detection and resection for adenomas in the colorectum due to an 
increased risk of advanced adenomas and CRC in such patients; 
however, there is another major pathway to CRC “serrated 
pathway” which accounts for 15–30% of CRC and has serrated 
lesions as cancer precursors. SPS is common in bowel cancer 
screening programmes which use guaiac faecal occult blood test 
(gFOBT) or FIT as a screening test, with estimates of SPS prevalence ranging from 1:150 to 1:300.187 188 A recent Spanish FIT 
based cohort followed up all their patients with proximal serrated 
polyps, tripling the number of additional cases of SPS, for a final 
prevalence of 1:100.189 Therefore, especially when using FIT in 
bowel cancer screening, colonoscopists should be alert to a diagnosis of SPS.
The BSG position statement on serrated polyps in the colon and 
rectum recommended 1–2 yearly surveillance for patients meeting 
the WHO criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome.190 This recommendation was on the basis that in early cohorts future risk of CRC 
was elevated as much as 7% at 5 years191 192; however in larger 
cohorts with rigorous surveillance performed every 1–2 years, with 
all lesions larger than 5mm in size resected, at academic centres,
the risk appeared much lower with CRC only diagnosed at 1.9 
cases per 1000 years of patient follow-up.181 182 In a US study 
following up SPS patients which extended surveillance intervals 
for SPS patients to 2 years after colon clearance with no lesion 
≥10mm found at surveillance, no cancer developed or surgery was 
needed.193 A similar multicentre European study that individualised surveillance after colonic clearance to 1 or 2year follow-up
dependent on lesion size (≥10mm), number and pathology also 
showed no difference in advanced neoplasia detection with a 2year
surveillance interval once the colon was cleared.194
No new data directly relevant to this area have been published 
since the BSG position statement. However, a study of patients 
with multiple serrated polyps and adenomas, not fulfilling the 
criteria for SPS, also noted that their risk for CRC was equivalent to patients who met the WHO definition of SPS, and that 
their FDRs had a comparable risk of CRC.179
Colonoscopic surveillance in unaffected FDRs of patients with 
SPS
We recommend all FDRs of patients with SPS on the basis of the 
new WHO 2019 SPS criteria 1 or 2 should be offered an index 
colonoscopic screening examination at the age of 40 years or 10 
years before the diagnosis of the index case.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 89% agreement.
We suggest all FDRs of serrated polyposis patients have a 
surveillance examination every 5 years unless polyp burden 
indicates an examination is required earlier according to postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines.

strong)
Consensus reached: 84% agreement.
SPS may be a familial condition with between 1.3% and 7.7% 
of index cases having an FDR who meets the original WHO 
criteria 1 or 3 for 195 196SPS. A further 14.3%–24.4% of FDRs 
meet original WHO criterion two for SPS. Current guidelines 
recommend a one-off screening examination of all FDRs to 
detect these familial SPS cases; however, the majority of FDR 
will not meet the original WHO criteria for SPS after this initial 
examination. The risk of CRC for FDRs of SPS patients is estimated to be substantially elevated above that of the general

population by three- to fivefold.179 197 198 This risk may also 
apply to those with multiple serrated polyps not meeting WHO 
criteria for SPS. It is unclear how this risk is distributed in the 
SPS FDR population.
In three series the mean or median age at diagnosis for CRC 
in FDRs of SPS patients ranged from 55 to 62. CRC was very 
rare in those aged less than 40 years with the youngest case being 
aged 25. Authors have recommended a screening examination 
starting at 35 or between 40 and 50 for FDRs of SPS cases, or 
starting 5–10 years before the index case179 195–197
In a follow-up study of 78 patients, those who did not meet 
any WHO criteria for SPS seem to have low risk for subsequent 
polyp or advanced neoplasia development; however, those who 
meet WHO criteria 2 do seem to develop polyps with five of 
14 patients developing three or more adenomas and two others 
of the 14 developing a serrated lesion ≥10mm in size.196 High 
rates of polyps in patients who met WHO 2 criteria were also 
seen by Hazewinkel et al.
195 Therefore a significant proportion 
of WHO 2 SPS patients would meet criteria for 3 yearly surveillance according to current guidelines. No cancers developed. 
No data are available to look at the colonoscopic yield in FDRs 
of index patients who meet WHO criteria 2, that is, a second 
degree relative of a patient with SPS WHO 1 or 3, although the 
risk of CRC in second degree relatives of index cases of SPS is 
only slightly elevated (SIR 1.38, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.91).198
The WHO definition of SPS has recently changed with criteria 
2 abandoned completely so that FDRs with serrated polyps 
are not considered to meet the definition for SPS. Therefore a 
blanket recommendation for colonoscopic surveillance for FDRs 
of SPS every 5 years based on the three- to fivefold increase in 
SIR of CRC is suggested from age 40 or 10 years before the 
diagnosis for the index case, with more frequent surveillance 
in line with sporadic recommendations if additional polyps are 
detected.
FDRs of patients with multiple serrated polyps (MSP, 10 or 
more polyps in total of which 50% are serrated) but who do not 
meet the 2019 WHO criteria for SPS might be considered for 
similar surveillance approaches for FDRs.
The risk of CRC in FDRs of SPS patients is sufficiently elevated 
that they should be offered colonoscopic screening and regular 
surveillance.
Multiple colorectal adenomas
We suggest an individualised approach to germline testing of 
patients with MCRA (defined as having 10 or more metachronous adenomas). Consider this testing for:
► Patients under 60 years of age with lifetime total of ≥10 
adenomas;or
► Patients from 60 years of age with lifetime total of:
– ≥20 adenomas, or
– ≥10 adenomas and an FHCC or polyposis
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 91% agreement.
We suggest that patients with a finding of 10 or more polyps 
(adenomas or serrated lesions) should, at their next colonoscopy, have a high-quality colonoscopic assessment with pancolonic dye spray in order to accurately define the multiple polyp 
phenotype.
(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 89% agreement.
We suggest that the endoscopic management of patients 
with 10 or more metachronous adenomas, without MUTYH 
or APC gene mutations, should be individualised according to 
phenotype.
(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 91% agreement.
We suggest annual colonoscopic surveillance for patients 
with 10 or more metachronous adenomas after the colon has 
been cleared of all lesions >5mm in size. If no polyps 10mm or 
greater in size are identified at subsequent surveillance examinations the interval can be extended to 2 yearly.

Consensus reached: 80% agreement.
Patients with multiple adenomas but without classical familial 
adenomatous polyposis are frequently encountered in clinical 
practice. Approximately 1.1% of patients undergoing colonoscopy in the English bowel cancer screening programme have 
10 or more adenomas.199 There is an association of adenoma 
multiplicity with metachronous advanced adenoma and/or 
CRC risk, with the degree of risk correlating with increasing 
adenoma number and size. With less than three adenomas as 
reference, Cubiella et al (n=5401) reported a statistically 
increased risk for AN when three or four adenomas (14.8%), 
and also when five to nine adenomas (18.4%), were present at 
index colonoscopy.200
In the largest study to date of individuals with 10–19 
adenomas,172 3789 patients with 10 or more colorectal polyps 
underwent constitutional testing of the prevalence of pathogenic variants with a 17-gene panel. The diagnostic yield of 
pathogenic variants remained above 5% in all ages and cohorts, 
despite a decrease with age. In the multiple adenoma cohort, 
the yield was higher in those patients with a personal or family 
history of cancer. In 1342 patients with 10–19 adenomas, 7.8% 
had a pathogenic variant in one of the panel genes, with 2.2% in 
“traditional”’ polyposis predisposition genes, and 2.8% in MMR 
genes. Thus an unbiased multi-gene panel test approach may be 
associated with a higher diagnostic yield.
In a study of 7225 individuals with MCRA and oligopolyposis, 
pathogenic variants in APC or common European founder pathogenic biallelic variants in MUTYH were identified in 87/970 (9%) 
individuals with 10–19 adenomas and 559/3253 (17%) individuals with 20–99 adenomas.201 There was an incremental increase 
in the odds of a pathogenic variant with an increasing number 
of adenomas and earlier age at adenoma diagnosis, particularly 
under the age of 50 years.
In addition to APC and MUTYH there is an evolving range of 
other multiple adenoma susceptibility genes including NTHL1, 
GREM1, POLE, POLD1 and MSH3. Spier et al in 2015 demonstrated POLE pathogenic variants in 1.5% of individuals with 
greater than 20 synchronous or 40 metachronous adenomas 
although this percentage increased with a family history.202
There is also some evidence of polygenic risk contributing to 
this attenuated polyposis phenotype.203
In summary, it is advisable to consider a diagnosis of a highly 
penetrant syndrome in patients with multiple adenomas. A 
nuanced approach to patient selection for constitutive testing 
should incorporate patient age and personal and family history.
With regard to colonoscopic surveillance in the multiple 
adenoma patient population, the GDG suggests constitutional 
gene testing to rule out known hereditary syndromes. Subsequently an individualised approach should be taken depending 
on adenoma size and number, with the goal of clearance of 
colorectal adenomas >5mm in size. However, surgical resection 
should be considered where surveillance is not feasible.

Guidelines
In patients with 10–99 adenomas without APC or MUTYH
pathogenic variants, the clinical phenotype is similar to that of 
attenuated polyposis, with both an upper GI (21% with duodenal 
adenomas) and colorectal phenotype.204 In a study of 83 patients 
also of 10–99 adenomas without APC or MUTYH pathogenic 
variants from the UK and Holland, the upper GI phenotype 
was reported in a minority of patients (9.6%), all of whom had 
Spigelman I or II disease (ie, early stage).205
For FDRs of MCRA patients, clinicians may consider a colonoscopic assessment of risk at the time of referral, and/or a 
repeat assessment at age 50 years. This is in order that patients 
who may be at risk of high penetrance cancer predisposition 
syndromes may be effectively identified (for example, the children of individuals with unidentified mosaic pathogenic variants 
of the APC gene206). However the GDG did not reach consensus 
on this recommendation, and recommend that multicentre 
outcome data in these patients be collected and published to help 
guide future recommendations.
Familial adenomatous polyposis
FAP is defined by the presence of pathogenic variants in the APC
gene with a prevalence of about 1/8500. It is a dominantly inherited multisystem cancer predisposition syndrome with a characteristic phenotype characterised by colorectal and upper GI 
polyposis.
Colorectal surveillance in FAP
We recommend that colonic surveillance should normally 
commence at the age of 12–14 years in those confirmed to have 
FAP on predictive genetic testing.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
We suggest that for those with FAP, intervals between surveillance colonoscopy may be individualised depending on colonic 
phenotype every 1–3 years.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 94% agreement.
We suggest that colonoscopy screening is performed for individuals who have an FDR with a clinical diagnosis of FAP (ie, 
“at-risk”) and in whom an APC mutation has not been identified, starting at the age of 12–14 years, and should continue on 
5 yearly surveillance until either a clinical diagnosis is made 
and they are then managed as FAP, or they reach the age at 
which they can enrol in national screening.
(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
Current international guidelines207 208 recommend starting 
colonoscopy surveillance or screening at the age of 12–14 years, 
after diagnostic genetic testing has been performed in at-risk 
children. There are no new data to recommend any change 
to this recommendation of age at which to start. The risk of 
CRC under the age of 20 years is very small and under 15 years 
extremely rare.207 In patients with FAP-related symptoms such 
as rectal bleeding, diarrhoea or mucous discharge should lead 
to a colonoscopy at any age, particularly in those with a constitutional pathogenic variant at codon 1309, which is associated 
with a greater risk of a more severe colonic phenotype.
Colonoscopic surveillance has been shown to lead to a reduction in CRC and CRC-associated mortality. Data detailing the 
results of polyposis registries have shown that in symptomatic 
patients the incidence of CRC was 50–70% compared with 
3–10% in those that were identified by registry initiated surveillance.209–211 Surveillance and prophylactic intervention has 
reduced CRC associated mortality.212 213
Colonoscopic surveillance enables assessment of adenoma 
burden and distribution, which can guide the timing of and type of 
prophylactic surgery required. Previous guidelines recommended 
the use of flexible sigmoidoscopy. However, most endoscopic 
procedures are performed under general anaesthesia in children 
and young teenagers; therefore a full colonoscopy is recommended 
in an affected patient, to better determine their phenotype, as 
polyp distribution is not uniform and the rectum and sigmoid may 
be normal despite the presence of more proximal adenomas. It is 
not recommended therefore for flexible sigmoidoscopy to be used 
routinely in screening/surveillance in FAP.
Current guidelines advocate annual endoscopic assessment. 
There is no evidence for accelerated carcinogenesis in FAP and 
the rather scant data that are available do not indicate a rapid 
increase in polyp number in teenagers/young adults.214 Therefore 
it does not seem logical to mandate an annual assessment for all 
affected patients, particularly given that there is significant variability in colonic phenotype. Those with an attenuated phenotype 
(<100 adenomas) may not require such frequent colonoscopic 
surveillance as those with a classical phenotype (>100 adenomas). 
In addition, if an individual only has adenomas of 1–2mm their
surveillance could perhaps be longer than those with larger polyps, 
for example, 8–9mm. Personalising surveillance interval according 
to phenotype, 1–3 yearly would appear safe as long as families are 
not lost to follow-up and this would concord with current paediatric guidelines.208 Extending the interval, however, should be for 
those with an attenuated phenotype, in the setting of good quality 
colonoscopy with robust systems in place to ensure appropriate 
recall.
There are a few patients with a particularly attenuated phenotype. In this group, primary endoscopic management by surveillance and polypectomy may be considered either to defer surgery 
or possibly to avoid the need for surgery altogether. However, 
there are no robust data to support this approach.
At risk patients, where predictive genetic testing is not 
possible, should be screened by colonoscopy every 5 years from 
the age of 12–14 years. If adenomas are identified, the patient 
should undergo repeat colonoscopy at a frequency depending on 
the colonic phenotype as described above. If no phenotype has 
been observed by the age of 50 years, FAP is unlikely and so the 
patient could be discharged from routine colonoscopic screening 
to have continued screening under the auspices of the national 
bowel cancer screening programme.
Upper GI surveillance in patients affected with FAP
We recommend upper GI surveillance for FAP patients starting 
at the age of 25 years.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 90% agreement.
We suggest that for those considered at risk, where predictive 
genetic testing is not possible, screening with upper GI endoscopy is not routinely recommended but should be started if/
when a clinical diagnosis of FAP is made based on colorectal 
phenotype.

in FAP is estimated to be around 5%.216 Because of this, surveillance has been recommended and survival benefit for those 
diagnosed with duodenal cancer by surveillance compared with 
those who presented symptomatically has been demonstrated.217
The Spigelman classification (table 3) is the system that is most 
widely used for staging non-ampullary duodenal disease2182; it 
has been shown to correlate with cancer risk219 and is recommended to determine surveillance intervals.207 There is debate 
about how to incorporate ampullary disease in this classification system. A staging system for ampullary disease has been 
proposed,220 which in one series correlated to the development of ampullary cancer.221 A surveillance interval determined 
by the combination of these staging systems may be the most 
helpful and reliably replicated clinical means of managing 
duodenal surveillance (see figure 1). A duodenoscope is required 
to reliably assess and/or biopsy the periampullary region and 
ampulla itself. Although there are reports of chromoendoscopy increasing duodenal adenoma detection,222 223 its utility in 
clinical practice is not established. It may increase the number 
of adenomas detected but there remains no evidence that dye 
spray increases the pick-up of larger, more clinically meaningful 
lesions.223 There are no data to suggest that it alters the need 
for endoscopic or surgical intervention. The concern is that it 
may increase the pick-up of small lesions and may artificially 
“upstage” the duodenal disease but without reflecting a higher 
cancer risk, compared with white light endoscopy. Recent data 
suggest that it is polyp size and the presence of high-grade 
dysplasia that are the most important predictors of cancer risk, 
polyp multiplicity.
224 It should be noted that the Spigelman classification system was developed and validated using white light 
endoscopy, without high definition.
The role of endoscopic therapy in the duodenum and 
ampullary is not well established. It has an acceptable safety 
profile225 226; however, there are no long-term data to demonstrate it reduces cancer risk or indeed prevents or delays the need 
for prophylactic surgery. Nevertheless, it is widely performed 
in centres dealing with a large cohorts of patients with FAP. It 
would be most prudent for patients being considered for endoscopic therapy for duodenal disease to be referred to their local 
specialist centre, so that assessment and work up to decide as to 
the appropriateness of endoscopic and surgical intervention can 
be performed.
The data regarding endoscopic management of ampullary 
disease are rather scant. However, it appears to be less safe with 
risk of haemorrhage, pancreatitis and perforation, morbidity 
rates up to 45%225 and with high rates of recurrence, up to 
58%.227 It cannot be routinely recommended. Referral to a 
specialist hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) centre should be 
made for those in whom endoscopic ampullectomy is being 
considered.
Gastric lesions are also common in adult patients with FAP. 
Fundic gland polyps (FGPs) are seen in up to 80% of patients 
with FAP228 and although there is some debate they are likely 
to be an entirely benign entity without malignant potential. 
Gastric adenomas are being seen more commonly, as indeed is 
gastric cancer. Although historically gastric cancer risk was not 
thought to be elevated in patients with FAP, there are reports that 
gastric adenomas and cancer are becoming an important clinical 
problem.229 230 There are no data published regarding outcomes 
of endoscopic therapy for gastric adenomas in FAP. Referral to a 
specialist centre for assessment and management seems prudent 
given the lack of evidence and absence of consensus guidelines.
Congenital hypertrophy retinal pigmentation epithelium
We suggest that patients with congenital hypertrophy retinal 
pigmentation epithelium (CHRPE) be referred for a specialist 
ophthalmic review. Patients with bilateral and multiple CHRPE 
lesions should be referred for screening for FAP and considered 
for genetic testing and colonoscopy.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
Up to two thirds of patients with FAP have CHRPE identified at ophthalmoscopy,231 compared with a prevalence in the 
general population of 1–4%. CHRPE lesions associated with 
FAP are most often multiple, bilateral (in 86% of cases) and 
oval or pisciform in shape. Multiple retinal lesions have a very 
high specificity as a phenotypic marker for FAP.232 Referral for 
a specialist ophthalmic review will assist in characterising those 
with lesions which need to be considered for screening for FAP. 
Such patients should be referred to a specialist centre for consideration of screening for FAP by genetic testing and thereafter 
colonoscopy, age 12–14 years, or at time of diagnosis if diagnosed at an older age.
FAP and surgery
We recommend that for patients with FAP who are undergoing 
colonoscopic surveillance, relative indications for surgery are
polyps >10mm in diameter, high grade dysplasia within polyps 
and a significant increase in polyp burden between screening 
examinations.

For most patients the choice of surgery will be between total 
colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) and proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). The choice of 
surgery will depend on rectal polyp number, size and presence of 
high-grade dysplasia, genotype and the functional consequences 
of the surgical procedure. IPAA should also be considered

Guidelines
for those patients who are likely to be poorly compliant with 
follow-up surveillance.
Total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy can be considered 
for patients with poor sphincter function, incontinence, distal 
rectal cancer, cancers requiring radiation, or for those who desire 
to avoid the functional consequences of an ileoanal pouch.
In patients with FAP, colon cancer will inevitably develop if the 
colon is not removed. Total colectomy will prevent colon cancer 
in FAP patients. Prophylactic surgery can usually be planned at a 
time which is suitable to the patient, based on the risk of cancer 
as assessed colonoscopically. The timing and choice of surgical 
procedure should take into account the educational, social, 
family planning and emotional development of the patient and 
their reliability for attending follow-up evaluations.
Indications for surgery include polyps >10mm diameter, 
polyps with high-grade dysplasia, and marked increases in polyp 
number between examinations. Symptoms from polyps should 
be rare in those undergoing regular screening and surgery should 
be performed before symptoms from polyps develop.
Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (TAC-IRA) can be 
offered to patients with relative rectal sparing (<20 polyps) if all 
rectal adenomas are <5mm in diameter and any polyps >5mm 
can be endoscopically removed. However, flexibility with regard 
to a threshold polyp number should be employed with the advent 
of high-definition or chromo-endoscopic techniques.
The decision to retain the rectum is made based on future 
rectal cancer risk, polyposis phenotype in the rectum, functional 
considerations and the genotype.
Bülow et al evaluated 776 patients who had IRA, including 
576 before the ileoanal pouch era, and 200 after the ileoanal 
pouch became available in these centres.233 The cumulative risk 
of rectal cancer by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 10% in the prepouch era versus 2% in the pouch era.
A cohort study from Church et al of 213 patients with FAP 
included 165 patients who had rectal-sparing surgery, with 
128 of these having <20 polyps and 37 having >20 polyps.234
The rectal cancer incidence was 1.6% in the patients with <20 
polyps, compared with 10.8% in the patients with >20 polyps.
Predicting future rectal excision may also aid decision making 
about choice of surgery. A study from St Marks hospital of 
427 patients who underwent IRA found that by the age of 60 
years, half of the patients retained their rectum. Rectal polyp 
count exceeding 20, APC pathogenic variant codon 1250–1450, 
colonic polyp count ≥500 and age <25 years at the time of 
surgery were independent predictors of progressive rectal 
disease.235 Church et al also found rectal polyp count >20to 
predict future rectal excision.236
Genotype can also be utilised specifically when discussing surgical 
options. A study of four national polyposis registries included 475 
polyposis patients with a previous colectomy. Cumulative risks of 
secondary proctectomy 20 years after primary colectomy were 
10%, 39% and 61% in the attenuated, intermediate and severe 
genotype groups, respectively (p<0.05, groups compared separately).237 Patients with a severe genotype have a high-risk of rectal 
excision after primary colectomy and may be better directed to 
proctocolectomy with IPAA. Influence of genotype on survival has 
also been reported by Newton et al.
238
For patients undergoing IRA, 1–3 flexible sigmoidoscopies are 
required as per FAP patients with intact colons.
There have been no randomised trials comparing the functional outcome of IRA versus IPAA. The study by Aziz et al
provides a fair summary of the literature.239 They performed a 
meta-analysis on 12 non-randomized studies published between 
1991 and 2003 and containing over 1000 patients (47% IRA vs 
53% IPAA). Bowel frequency, nocturnal defaecation and use of 
incontinence pads were significantly less in the ileorectal group, 
although faecal urgency was reduced with the ileal pouch. 
There was no significant difference between the techniques in 
terms of sexual dysfunction, dietary restriction or postoperative 
complications.
The fecundity of women with FAP before operation and 
after colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis has been reported 
to be similar to that of the general population. However, 
fecundity dropped to 54 per cent following proctocolectomy 
with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. It is recommended that the 
significant reduction in female fecundity after IPAA should be 
communicated to young women with FAP before surgery.240
The risk of developing postoperative fertility problems is not 
associated significantly with the type of surgery, indication for 
surgery, complications or other comorbid conditions. Postoperative fertility problems appear to be more common among 
women who had their first surgical procedure at a younger 
age.241
Indications for rectal excision following IRA include: the 
development of rectal cancer, polyps >10mm diameter, polyps 
with high-grade dysplasia, and marked increases in polyp 
number between examinations. When conversion of an IRA to 
IPAA is required, functional outcomes appear similar to primary 
IPAA procedures. Complication rates and pouch failure rates 
are reported to be similar, but conversion to IPAA will not be 
possible in a small percentage of patients.242
Proctocolectomy with IPAA is the treatment of choice in the 
presence of: rectal cancer, a large rectal polyp burden (>20 
synchronous adenomas, adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, 
large (>10mm) adenomas) or a severe phenotype (>1000 
synchronous adenomas).
Risk of neoplasia and cancer in the pouch
There is a very small risk of adenocarcinoma after an IPAA. Most 
cancers develop in residual rectal or in the anal transitional zone 
(ATZ) mucosa. Cancer can also develop within the ileal component of the pouch. Currently nearly all pouches are constructed 
with the use of stapling devices which results in the ATZ mucosa 
being preserved. Von Roon reported on 206 patients with a 
median follow-up of 10.3years.243 The risk of adenoma of the 
IPAA at 10 years was 51% after stapled IPAA; no patient developed cancer. van Duijvendijk et al reported the risk of developing a polyp of the IPAA after 7 years was 31% after stapled 
IPAA.244
Of 212 patients followed up in the Dutch polyposis registry, 
the cumulative risk of developing an adenoma in the pouch at 
10year follow-up was 45%. Twenty-five patients (11.8%) developed an adenoma with advanced pathology and four (1.9%) 
developed a carcinoma. The cumulative risk of developing 
a pouch carcinoma at 10year follow-up was 1%.245 A 2013 
review of 24 studies reporting 92 pouch-related cancers found 
that 23 of 92 cancers (25%) developed in the pouch mucosa and 
69 (75%) in the ATZ.246 A Mayo clinic study on 117 patients 
showed a median time to development of dysplasia was 149 
months. Adenocarcinoma developed in one patient after 284 
months. Risk of dysplasia at 10, 20 and 25 years was 17%, 45% 
and 69%, respectively.247
Thus, although the risk of severe mucosal dysplasia and cancer 
is low, annual endoscopic surveillance of any remaining rectal 
mucosa, ATZ mucosa and ileal pouch are recommended for life.

Guidelines
FAP and desmoid disease
We suggest that FAP patients should be counselled about the risk 
of post-operative desmoid disease formation.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
For FAP patients before colectomy, consider determining 
genotypes or family history of desmoid disease which may be 
predictive of desmoid formation.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 78% agreement.
We suggest that sulindac in combination with high-dose selective oestrogen receptor modulators may be effective in FAP 
patients with intra-abdominal desmoids and desmoids located 
at the abdominal wall.
(GRADE of evidence: very low; Strength of recommendation: 
weak)
Consensus reached: 100% agreement.
We recommend the role of elective surgery for intra-abdominal 
desmoids should be restricted to treating secondary effects of the 
desmoid disease, and this surgery should be performed in expert 
centres.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 95% agreement.
Desmoid tumours will develop in around 15% of patients with 
FAP. Risk factors include abdominal surgery, positive family history 
for desmoids and site of the pathogenic variant.248 249 In individuals with APC pathogenic variants in the desmoid region 3' to 
codon 1399, abdominal surgery was associated with a 65% risk of 
developing mesenteric desmoids.249 As desmoids can cause significant complications and pose a low risk of death, genotypes predictive of desmoid formation and family history of desmoids should 
be determined for all patients before colectomy. Identification of 
at-risk patients will enable appropriate counselling and consent 
before surgery and allow informed decision about the timing of 
surgery. This decision should sensibly balance the risk of malignancy with the risk of mesenteric desmoid disease.
Some desmoid tumours spontaneously stop growing, some 
regress and others remorselessly increase in size. In a small 
proportion, this increase may be rapid and uncontrollable. There 
are no proven predictors of growth pattern.
The distinction between intra- and extra-abdominal desmoids 
is important. Abdominal wall desmoids cause pain (variable) 
and mass effect. Intra-abdominal lesions, in addition, are at risk 
of causing secondary effects: ureteric and small bowel obstruction, fistula formation or small bowel ischaemia. The quality of 
data on which to make decisions about treatment of abdominal 
wall and intra-abdominal desmoid disease is limited and largely 
consists of small, non-controlled studies. As such, the treatment 
of patients with desmoid tumours remains controversial. For 
abdominal wall lesions, there is an expanding role of percutaneous ablative treatments and in some institutions ablation has 
become the primary treatment.250
Church et al251 combined symptoms (pain, restriction, hospitalisation and sensation of a mass) with size and growth rate in 
a proposed staging system for intra-abdominal desmoid disease. 
Decisions about treatment are partly based on size and symptoms, but are more often determined by secondary effects of 
the desmoid on the urinary and GI tract. Following diagnosis, 
if no secondary effects are present, serial imaging with CT or 
MRI scanning every 6–12 months depending on growth rate 
is reasonable. Radiological screening at 12 months following 
surgery for those who are at high-risk of desmoid development 
might be appropriate.
If there is concern about the size or growth rate of desmoid 
disease, first line treatment should be with high-dose selective 
oestrogen receptor modulators and sulindac, according to the 
regime outlined by Quast et al.
252 In this observational series all 
desmoid patients treated and followed at their institution had 
completed at least 1year of treatment.252 Response was defined 
as stable size or regression of desmoid size between two CT or 
MRI scans. Of the 134 patients included, half had a confirmed 
diagnosis of FAP. Eighty-five per cent of patients showed regression or had stable desmoid size. The mean time to reach at least 
stable size was 14.9±9.1 months. After regression or stabilisation, medication was tapered in 60% of the treated patients with 
only one long-term recurrence after >10 years.
In patients with progressive intra-abdominal desmoid disease 
that does not respond to this treatment, chemotherapy (eg, doxorubicine and dacarbazine or methotrexate and vinblastine)253 254
or radiation therapy is indicated.
Surgery should be reserved for secondary effects of the 
desmoid disease.
MUTYH-associated polyposis
Colorectal surveillance in MAP
We recommend that colorectal surveillance is commenced in 
MAP starting at the age of 18–20 years. If surgery is not undertaken then annual surveillance is suggested.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 83% agreement.
We recommend that for monoallelic MUTYH pathogenic 
variant carriers, the risk of CRC is not sufficiently different to 
population risk to meet thresholds for screening, and routine 
colonoscopy is not recommended.
(GRADE of evidence: moderate; Strength of recommendation: 
strong)
Consensus reached: 94% agreement.
MAP is a recessively inherited cancer and polyposis predisposition syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the MUTYH
base-excision repair gene, with significant phenotypic overlap 
with FAP. It is classically said to be associated with a more attenuated phenotype than FAP but there is significant phenotypic variation. Past guidelines have suggested that colonoscopy should 
commence at the age of 18–20 years, on the basis that CRC in 
MAP is rare below the age of 30 years207 and be performed up 
to 2 yearly, as the colonic phenotype is usually more attenuated. 
This attenuated phenotype also lead the authors to comment 
that endoscopic management may suffice if there is an attenuated phenotype.
CRC in MAP is more likely to be right sided and synchronous.255 256 A cumulative CRC risk of 63% at 60 years has been 
reported.257 The median age of CRC seems dependent on the 
underlying genotype.256 MAP accounts for up to 29% of those 
patients with 10–100 adenomas but also up to 29% of those with 
a classical phenotype (100–1000 adenomas). Biallelic pathogenic 
variants have also been reported in patients with <10 adenomas 
and also in patients with CRC but no adenomas.258–260 There are 
further data to suggest that CRC risk in MAP may not correlate 
to adenoma number.257
Colonoscopy surveillance may not be effective in MAP and it 
has been postulated that there may be accelerated carcinogenesis. Nieuwenhuis and colleagues reported that of those who 
presented with a polyposis phenotype but without CRC, 9%

developed CRC during 5 years of surveillance. If the presentation was with CRC, then they observed a 5year metachronous 
cancer risk of 11%.257 In light of these data, annual colonoscopy would appear appropriate if colonoscopy surveillance is 
pursued, but it appears that surgery may be the more appropriate management strategy, balanced against age, co-morbidity 
and expected functional outcome.
Upper GI surveillance in patients affected with MAP
We suggest that upper GI surveillance should be considered in 
MAP, starting at the age of 35 years. We recommend that the 
surveillance interval is determined as outlined for FAP.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 94% agreement.
The data regarding the upper GI tract phenotype in MAP is 
far less extensive than in FAP. It is generally suggested that the 
two conditions should be managed in a similar manner.207 261
Duodenal adenomas have been reported in 17–34% of those 
with MAP.262 263 The median age at which duodenal adenomas 
are diagnosed has been reported as 50 years.262 The lifetime 
risk of developing duodenal cancer is estimated to be around 
4%.263 Two patients were diagnosed with duodenal or ampullary cancer in one series, age 83 and 63 years, respectively; both 
were diagnosed at index upper GI endoscopy but no cancer 
arose in patients who were on a surveillance programme.262
Polyps appear to progress through the development of villous 
features and increasing size in this series, rather than progression 
in number or dysplasia.262 Certainly the phenotype does appear 
to be different and polyp multiplicity in MAP does not seem to 
be observed in the same manner as it is in FAP. There appears to 
be scientific evidence to suggest that MAP duodenal polyps may 
behave differently to those in FAP. A higher burden of somatic 
pathogenic variants in MAP duodenal adenomas is reported, 
compared with FAP, despite a lower Spigelman stage disease. It 
is postulated that this may reflect an increased cancer risk in 
the context of apparently less severe benign disease264; however, 
long-term data to support this hypothesis are lacking.
Because of the reduced frequency of duodenal adenomas, 
compared with FAP and the later onset of duodenal adenomas, it 
has been suggested that starting upper GI endoscopic surveillance 
could be deferred until the age of 35 years.262 In the absence of 
more robust data, determining surveillance intervals according 
to duodenal and ampullary staging, as has been recommended in 
FAP, appears to be a pragmatic approach.
There are few data regarding gastric lesions in MAP. FGPs 
have been reported in 6% of a cohort with MAP and gastric 
adenomas in 3%.263 This would suggest that gastric polyposis is 
seen less commonly than in FAP. In the same series gastric cancer 
was observed but the incidence was not statistically different to 
the risk for the general population. Further data regarding the 
gastric phenotype are required to determine risk and how best 
to manage such lesions.
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
PJS is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterised 
by the development of benign hamartomatous polyps in the GI 
tract and hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa 
(which fade with age). The prevalence of PJS is between 1/8300 
and 1/29 000 and most patients have pathogenic variants in the 
STK11 (also called LKB1) gene.
Diagnostic criteria265: A diagnosis of PJS in an individual may 
be made when any one of the following is present:
► Two or more histologically confirmed PJ polyps
► Any number of PJ polyps detected in one individual who has 
a family history of PJS in a close relative
► Characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation in an individual 
who has a family history of PJS in a close relative
► Any number of PJ polyps in an individual who also has characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation
► A pathogenic variant in STK11.
The risk of GI tract cancer in PJS
GI tract carcinogenesis in PJS is controversial. The malignant 
potential of the PJS polyp is unclear. A hamartoma–adenoma–
carcinoma sequence has been proposed but robust supporting 
data are lacking. There are data suggesting that the PJS polyp is 
non-neoplastic, including descriptions of polyclonality and the 
rarity of dysplasia in PJS polyps.266
It is widely accepted that there is an increased risk of malignancy in PJS. However, the risk is difficult to quantify, with the 
majority of the literature being small cohort studies with inherent 
bias, potentially leading to overestimation of risk. A metaanalysis has been performed by Hearle et al creating a cohort 
of 419 patients with PJS.267 This offers the most comprehensive 
data for cancer risk with a luminal GI cancer risk of 1%, 9%, 
15%, 33% and 57% at 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 years, respectively. 
More recent data, although from a smaller cohort, support the 
proposition that GI cancers are less of a clinical problem and that 
pancreatic and breast cancers are the most commonly diagnosed 
malignancies in PJS.266
GI surveillance and PJS
We suggest that in an asymptomatic patient with PJS, GI surveillance by upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy and VCE commence 
at the age of 8 years. We recommend that small bowel surveillance should continue 3yearly. If baseline colonoscopy and 
OGD are normal, then they can be safely deferred until the age 
of 18 years; however, if polyps are found at baseline examination, then they should be repeated 3yearly. Earlier investigation 
of the GI tract should be performed in symptomatic patients.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 82% agreement.
Small bowel polyps resulting in intussusception is the major 
clinical problem affecting children with PJS. The cumulative intussusception risk is estimated at 50–68% during childhood,268 269 with 15–30% requiring surgery before the age of 
10 years with a median age of the first intussusception of 10–16 
years. These data include patients who preceded routine small 
bowel surveillance. They also combine patients with an established diagnosis of PJS undergoing surveillance, with those not 
under surveillance in whom the diagnosis of PJS was made at 
presentation with an intussusception. The recommendation to 
start small bowel surveillance at the age of 8 years, and earlier if 
symptomatic, is based on these data.270
Gastroscopy and colonoscopy are the preferred investigation to assess the upper GI tract and colon, respectively. Barium 
follow through has been replaced by VCE and MRI enterography, both of which are better tolerated by patients, have a 
similar accuracy in detecting clinically significant polyps (>1cm) 
and avoid the need for repeated ionising radiation.271–276 VCE 
and MR enterography may be complimentary. While VCE may 
be better at detecting smaller polyps, MRI enterography is better 
at localisation and accurate sizing.
Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) should not recommended 
as a surveillance tool as it is technically challenging, limited by 
size of the abdomen and requires both oral and rectal approaches;

Guidelines
therefore a general anaesthetic is required to reliably visualise 
the whole length of the small bowel. The main role of DBE is 
therapeutic, for targeted polypectomy.
Role of endoscopic polypectomy in PJS
We suggest elective polypectomy to prevent polyp related 
complications. Small bowel polyps >1.5–2cm in size (or smaller 
if symptomatic) should be considered for elective resection to 
prevent intussusception.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 88% agreement.
Polypectomy at surveillance is recommended in PJS. It is not 
clear whether this approach modifies cancer risk and indeed, given 
the lack of dysplasia in PJS polyps, it is unlikely to do so. The main 
role for polypectomy therefore is to prevent polyp-related complications. Prevention of anaemia and bleeding, however, is difficult 
to quantify and there are no data regarding this. Intussusception is 
the most important clinical problem in children with PJS, with an 
accumulative risk of 50–68% in childhood.268 269
Existing guidelines suggest intervening in small bowel polyps 
which are 1.5–2cm, earlier if symptomatic.270 This is supported 
by data which report a median polyp size of 35mm (15–60mm) 
in cases of confirmed intussusception.269 In addition, in a cohort 
in whom routine surveillance was performed, with intervention 
planned as outlined above, no patient required emergency surgery 
for intussusception during 683 patient-years follow-up.266
Options to remove a PJS polyp include endoscopy, surgery or 
combined approaches. There are no data to state that one modality 
is superior to another and choice will be dependent on patient (eg, 
age, past abdominal surgery), polyp factors (size, location and 
multiplicity) and local availability of techniques. For those who 
undergo surgery for small bowel polyps, intraoperative enteroscopy and a “clean sweep” is recommended and has been demonstrated to reduce the need for subsequent laparotomy.277 Polyp 
clearance by intraoperative enteroscopy in the PJS may be effective 
in the long term.277 278
Juvenile polyposis syndrome
JPS is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by predisposition to hamartomatous polyps in the GI tract. The prevalence is between 1/100 000 and 1/160 000, with the following 
diagnostic criteria279:
► >5 juvenile polyps in the colon or rectum
► Juvenile polyps in other parts of the GI tract
► Any number of juvenile polyps and a positive family history
► A pathogenic variant in SMAD4 or BMPR1A.
About 40% of families have mutations in SMAD4 and a further 
40% in BMPR1A. Some patients have large chromosomal deletions encompassing both PTEN and BMPR1A genes. There is a 
requirement to develop an evidence base for the personalised 
management of JPS-related cancers, which is beyond the scope 
of this guideline.
JPS and colorectal surveillance
We suggest colonoscopic surveillance should commence from 
the age of 15 years or earlier if symptomatic. The surveillance interval should be 1–3 yearly, personalised according to 
colorectal phenotype.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 85% agreement.
The polyps in JPS are thought to have the potential for malignant transformation with dysplasia present in 8% of resected 
polyps in one series.280 The risk of CRC is ill-defined, being based 
on small series, with inherent bias. Such cohorts have reported 
CRC in 14–22% of patients280 281 with a reported lifetime CRC 
risk of 39–68%.281 282 CRC in childhood is not a clinically significant problem. The mean age of CRC in two of the larger studies 
was 44 years.280 282
The risk of CRC is undoubtedly elevated, and the current 
consensus is that colonoscopic surveillance is required, with the 
aim of preventing or detecting early cancers. Colonoscopy and 
polypectomy also has the potential to prevent polyp-related
morbidity (bleeding, anaemia or abdominal pain). There are few 
data regarding the outcomes of surveillance in JPS. In one of the 
largest cohorts, colonoscopy was safe. Two patients developed 
CRC on surveillance—one in the setting of carpeting of polyps, 
and the other arose following what was almost certainly an incomplete colonoscopy in the mid 1970s.280
For those with a confirmed genetic diagnosis of JPS, or individuals with a clinical diagnosis of JPS in whom molecular genetic 
test results were uninformative, colonoscopic surveillance can be 
delayed until the age of 15 years if asymptomatic.
There are no data to guide the most appropriate interval for 
colonoscopy surveillance in JPS. There are no data to support 
accelerated carcinogenesis in JPS. A personalised approach with 
the surveillance interval (1–3 yearly) based on individual colonic 
phenotype appears to be a pragmatic approach and is in line with 
recent paediatric polyposis guidelines.279 Colonic resection may be 
considered for those with a polyp burden not manageable endoscopically. For those unaffected individuals from families with a 
clinical but not molecular diagnosis, 5 yearly colonoscopy would 
seem adequate. If normal, the interval to be reviewed if a JPS 
phenotype is found or other sporadic polyps are identified.
Upper GI surveillance and JPS
We suggest that for those with a confirmed clinical or genetic 
diagnosis, upper GI endoscopic surveillance should start at the 
age of 18 years for SMAD4 pathogenic variant carriers and the 
age of 25 years for BMPR1A pathogenic variant carriers and 
those without an identified mutation. The surveillance interval 
should be 1–3 yearly, personalised according to upper GI tract 
phenotype.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 83% agreement.
We suggest that for those with an FDR with a clinical diagnosis of JPS and in whom a mutation has not been identified, 
screening of the upper GI tract is not required routinely but 
should be initiated if/when a clinical diagnosis is made on the 
basis of colonic phenotype. It may however be considered if 
there is a family history suggestive of hereditary haemorrhagic 
telangiectasia (HHT), even in the absence of colonic polyps.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 83% agreement.
Upper GI endoscopy is not required in those unaffected individuals in whom the diagnosis in the family is clinical without a 
confirmed molecular diagnosis. It is clear that the colon is the 
site most likely to be affected in JPS and therefore any upper GI 
tract assessment can be deferred until a colonic phenotype of JPS 
has been established in that individual.
There is a paucity of data evaluating the upper tract in 
JPS. Historical series report the incidence of gastric polyps

OGD before the age of 15 years and three had changes consistent with JPS, but none had dysplasia. In another series, gastroduodenal polyps were seen in 37%; in this cohort none of the six 
patients who had upper GI endoscopy before the age of 18 years 
had gastroduodenal polyps.280
Due to limited data, it is difficult to determine the exact lifetime risk of gastric cancer in JPS. There were two gastric cancers 
in a cohort of 44 patients with JPS (median age 56 years)280
and a further two (age not specified) in a cohort of 56 patients 
who appear to have been mostly JPS but some of whom had 
phenotypic features overlapping with Cowden syndrome.286 In 
another series, 3/42 patients had either high grade dysplasia or 
cancer in the stomach285 and a further two patients had prophylactic gastrectomy for benign gastric polyp burden.
The risk of severe gastric polyposis and gastric cancer phenotype appears to be increased in patients with SMAD4 pathogenic 
variants.287 288 All patients with advanced gastric polyposis were 
SMAD4 pathogenic variant carriers in one cohort. Aretz et al
reported a significantly higher risk of gastric polyposis in SMAD4
pathogenic variant carriers (73% vs 8%; p<0.001) and again all 
cases of gastric cancer in this cohort occurred in patients with 
SMAD4 pathogenic variants.288
Current published guidelines for the age at which to start 
upper GI surveillance ranges from 12 years261 to 25 years of 
age.35 Given the emerging genotype–phenotype association and 
the lack of significant pathology being found in childhood, it 
is recommended that those with a SMAD4 mutation undergo 
upper GI tract surveillance 1–3 yearly from the age of 18 years, 
and those with a BMPR1A mutation from 25 years of age.
Additional investigations required in patients with a SMAD4
mutation
We suggest that patients with a SMAD4 pathogenic variant 
should be evaluated for haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), 
and that those at risk of, or with a confirmed diagnosis of HHT 
are best managed in conjunction with a specialist HHT centre.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 90% agreement.
The coexistence of JPS and HHT was reported early in the 
1980s.289 It is now recognised that this is due to SMAD4 mutations. Up to 76% of patients with JPS due to SMAD4 mutations 
have features of HHT.290 Thoracic aortic disease and mitral 
valve dysfunction have also been reported.280 290 Aortopathy has 
been described in 38% of patients with a SMAD4 mutation, irrespective of the JPS phenotype.291
Patients may lack overt clinical symptoms of HHT but are at 
risk of asymptomatic arteriovenous malformation (AVMs) which 
can result in life threatening complications. Patients with a SMAD4
pathogenic variant are probably best managed in conjunction with 
a specialist centre with experience in evaluating and managing 
HHT patients. The recent British Thoracic Society guidelines on 
pulmonary AVMs may act as a useful resource.292
PTEN-hamartoma syndrome overlap and additional investigations 
indicated in a patient with microdeletions involving BMPR1A
Patients with JPS and a microdeletion involving BMPR1A and 
PTEN are at risk of the clinical manifestations of both JPS and 
PTEN-hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS). We suggest that 
they should be referred to their local genetics centre for further 
advice and to coordinate their surveillance needs.
(GRADE of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: weak)
Consensus reached: 89% agreement.
PHTS encompasses four major clinically distinct syndromes 
associated with constitutional pathogenic variants in the tumour 
suppressor PTEN. These are associated with macrocephaly, 
dysmorphism, developmental delay and an increased risk of 
extra-intestinal cancers and possibly intestinal cancers. BMPR1A
is located in the same chromosomal region as PTEN and deletions involving both genes have been reported. Microdeletions 
involving both genes have important clinical implications. There 
are numerous case reports suggesting that if the pathogenic 
variant (microdeletion) is found in both genes, these patients 
may present with a severe form of JPS with onset in early childhood and may also have an increased risk of the extra-intestinal 
manifestations of PHTS.293–295
