Background/Aims: Infections following liver transplant (LT) remain a major 
cause of mortality. This study was conducted to evaluate risk factors for infection 
and to review clinical characteristics.
Methods: Medical records of patients who underwent LT from 2010 to 2014 were 
retrospectively analyzed. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate risk factors of infection. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to predict prognosis 
of infected and non-infected groups.
Results: Of 185 recipients, 89 patients experienced infectious complications. The 
median follow-up period was 911 days (range, 9 to 2,031). The infected group 
had higher 1-year mortality (n = 22 [24.7%] vs. n = 8, [8.3%], p = 0.002), and longer 
postoperative admission days (mean: 53.7 ± 35.8 days vs. 28.3 ± 13.0 days, p < 0.001), 
compared to the non-infected group. High preoperative Model for End-Stage 
Liver Disease (MELD) score (odds ratio [OR], 1.057; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.010 to 1.105; p = 0.016), deceased-donor type (OR, 5.475; 95% CI, 2.442 to 12.279; 
p < 0.001), and acute rejection (OR, 3.042; 95% CI, 1.241 to 7.454; p = 0.015) were independent risk factors associated with infection. Intra-abdominal infection (n = 
35, 20.8%) was the major infectious complication. Among identified bacteria, Enterococcus species (28.4%) were major pathogens, followed by Escherichia coli and 
Klebsiella species. 
Conclusions: High preoperative MELD score, deceased-donor type, and acute 
rejection were risk factors associated with infection. To prevent infections following surgery, it is important to determine the appropriate time of operation before 
the recipient has a high MELD score.

INTRODUCTION
Despite continued improvement in clinical management of liver transplant (LT) recipients, infections continue to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and 
mortality [1]. LT recipients are more likely to develop 
bacterial infections than other organ transplant recipients due to the complexity of the surgical procedure 
which includes penetration of the hepatobiliary system 
[2]. Adverse outcomes within the first year after liver 
transplantation are primarily caused by allograft-related 
complications and infections [3]. Diagnosis of infection

in these patients is difficult because the signs and symptoms are usually mild or often absent [2]. Nevertheless, 
even mild infections in immunocompromised patients 
can have catastrophic effects [4]. During the initial period following LT, there is an increased incidence of 
central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) 
or ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) [4]. In addition, the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms 
worldwide in many transplant centers is a major problem requiring aggressive management [4]. The aim of 
this study therefore was to determine factors associated 
with infections after liver transplantation, and to review 
the clinical and microbiological characteristics of those 
infections.
METHODS
Study design and setting
Medical records of 185 patients who underwent liver 
transplantation from May 2010 to December 2014 at 
Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, 
Korea, were retrospectively reviewed. The types of infectious complications and causes of deaths were reviewed 
during a follow-up period until December 2015. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, laboratory 
data, outcomes, and infectious complications were collected. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score 
was calculated using the following formula: 3.78 × loge
(bilirubin, mg/dL) + 11.2 × loge (international normalized ratio [INR]) + 9.57 × loge
 (creatinine, mg/dL) + 6.43 
[3]. Creatinine level was converted to 4 mg/dL the day 
after initiation and at 3 days after the last use of renal replacement therapy if the procedure was done more than 
once [3]. This study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of Pusan National University Yangsan 
Hospital (Approval No. 30-2015-011). Informed consent 
was waived by the board.
Standard post-transplant management
Immunosuppression regimen 
Basiliximab at 1 day pre-LT and 4 days post-LT was used 
for induction of immunosuppression. Tacrolimus or 
cyclosporine with steroid was used as the maintenance 
immunosuppressant regimen in our hospital. The dose 
of tacrolimus was adjusted to maintain a blood level of 
13 to 15 µg/L for 2 weeks postoperatively and 10 to 13 µg/L 
thereafter. Blood levels of cyclosporine were maintained 
at 200 µg/L for 2 weeks after surgery and then maintained at 150 to 200 µg/L. Additionally, methylprednisolone (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously on the 
first day after LT. Its dose was gradually tapered until 
the 11th day after LT.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis
The standard surgical antibiotic prophylaxis regimen at 
our institution varied according to individual patient's 
MELD score. Piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin 
were given as prophylactic antibiotics to patients with 
MELD scores of less than 25, while vancomycin and 
meropenem were administered to patients with MELD 
score of 25 or higher. All patients received prophylactic 
antibiotics for 7 days unless there were other signs of 
infection. For antifungal prophylaxis, amphotericin B or 
liposomal amphotericin B were administered to recipients for 7 days after the surgery followed by administration of itraconazole for 2 weeks. Antiviral prophylaxis 
including ganciclovir was not administered except for 
seronegative recipients who received an allograft from 
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive donor [5]. For recipients with results positive for CMV by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (CMV-qPCR, VERI/MDx System CMV Assay, Beckman Coulter, Danvers, MA, USA) 
in the follow-up period, pre-emptive treatment with 
ganciclovir or valganciclovir was used depending on renal function. All patients were monitored by CMV qPCR 
weekly for the first 2 months and twice monthly up to 6 
months after the transplant. All patients were administered 80/400 mg trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole once 
a day for 3 months post-transplant as prophylaxis for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.
Definitions for infectious complications
Infectious complications were defined and categorized 
according to established consensus recommendations, 
or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria 
[6]. Based on clinical and microbiological documentation from patients’ medical records, all infectious 
syndromes were categorized into one of the following: 
respiratory, bloodstream (due to central line or other 
causes), genitourinary, intra-abdominal (including infection of hepatobiliary system), surgical site, and oth-

ers. Absence or presence of fungal infection and viral 
infection were also reviewed. CMV disease was defined 
following the guidelines proposed by Ljungman et al. [7]. 
It included either viral syndrome or end-organ disease. 
Invasive fungal infection was defined using the criteria 
proposed by the European Organization on Research 
and Treatment in Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group 
[8]. In cases where no microbiological etiology was established, clinical and radiological documentation were 
used to categorize infections.
Outcomes
We assessed the incidence of postoperative infectious 
complications, 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality 
following LT. Patient deaths after one year and during 
the follow-up period was further investigated.
Statistical analysis
Student t test was used to analyze continuous variables 
and chi-square test was used to analyze categorical variables. Variables with p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis 
were included in the multivariate analysis. Multivariate 
analysis used binary logistic regression tests. The Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test was used to analyze the survival of patients with infectious complication 
and those without infectious complications. Statistical 
analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0 for 
Windows (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical significance was considered achieved at p values less than 
0.05.
RESULTS
Demographic features of the infected and non-infected patient groups 
During the study period, there were 188 liver transplantations in 185 patients. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of these 185 patients in the preoperative and postoperative periods are summarized in 
Table 1. The median age of patients was 53 years (range, 
10 to 69). There were 131 male patients (70.8%). Age and 
gender were not significantly different between infected 
and non-infected groups. Of these 185 patients, 110 patients (59.5%) had cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B and 80 
patients (43.2%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 
total of 76 patients received organs from deceased-donors (41.1%). The median follow-up duration of all patients was 911 days (range, 2 to 2,031). The 1-year all-cause 
mortality was 16.2%. A total of 89 patients experienced 
infections (48.1%; 173 infectious episodes) during the follow-up period. There were significant differences in the 
incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HCC 
between the infected and non-infected groups. HBV infection and HCC were more frequently observed in the 
non-infected group (HBV: 72.2% vs. 45.5% in infected, p
< 0.001; HCC: 65.7% vs. 36.3% in infected, p = 0.008). On 
the other hand, hepatitis C virus infection, alcoholic liver diseases, and autoimmune liver diseases did not show 
a significant difference in prevalence rate between the 
two groups. The number of patients who received transplants from deceased-donors in the infected group was 
higher than that in the non-infected group (n = 55, 62.5% 
in the infected group vs. n = 21, 21.6% in the non-infected group, p < 0.001). 
MELD scores and Child-Pugh scores were both higher in the infected compared to the non-infected groups 
(21.60 ± 11.97 in infected vs. 13.87 ± 9.79 in the non-infected, 
p < 0.001; 5.22 ± 4.02 in infected vs. 4.01 ± 3.34 in non-infected, p = 0.029, respectively). There were significant differences in creatinine level (0.91 ± 0.05 mg/dL in non-infected vs. 1.14 ± 0.75 mg/dL in infected, p = 0.021) and 
prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PTSurvial days Survival probability

INR) (1.69 ± 0.79 non-infected vs. 1.92 ± 0.66 infected, p
= 0.029). These two laboratory variables are involved in 
the MELD score. C-reactive protein level (median, 0.61 
mg/dL [range, 0.08 to 2.54] in non-infected vs. median, 
1.28 mg/dL [range, 0.10 to 18.87] in infected, p < 0.001) 
and brain natriuretic peptide level (49 pg/mL [range, 7 to 
2,094] in non-infected vs. 102 pg/mL (range, 12 to 3,728] 
in infected, p = 0.011) also showed significant differences. 
In terms of postoperative clinical features, the group 
with infectious complications had a higher acute rejection rate (n = 23, 26.1% vs. n = 13, 13.4% in non-infected, p = 
0.040), higher 1-year mortality (24.7% vs. 8.3% in non-infected, p = 0.002), longer post-operative admission days 
(53.7 ± 35.8 days vs. 28.3 ± 13.0 days in non-infected, p < 
0.001), and longer intensive care unit (ICU) stays (22.1 ± 
14.3 days vs. 10.0 ± 7.0 days in non-infected, p < 0.001). 
During ICU care, longer ventilator duration was needed for the infected group compared to the non-infected 
group (13.0 ± 12.3 days vs. 4.0 ± 4.9 days in non-infected, p
< 0.001). In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was more frequently applied in the infected group 
(n = 7, 8% in the infected group vs. n = 1, 1.0% in non-infected group, p = 0.027). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, there 
was a significant difference in survival rate between the 
two groups (p = 0.002) (Fig. 1).
Risk factors for infectious morbidity
Based on these results, multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for infectious complications. Results are summarized in Table 
2. As preoperative MELD score increased, the risk of 
infection also increased (odds ratio [OR], 1.057; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.010 to 1.105; p = 0.016). Presence 
of acute rejection (OR, 3.042; 95% CI, 1.241 to 7.454; p = 
0.015) and deceased donor type (OR, 5.475; 95% CI, 2.442 
to 12.279; p < 0.001) were also found to be risk factors 
for infectious complications in this study. However, no 
single laboratory result was found to be an independent 
predictor of infection.
Characteristics of infectious complications in liver 
transplant recipients
A total of 89 patients experienced 168 infectious episodes during the follow-up period (48.2%). The number 
of episodes of infectious complications and the number of pathogens are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. 
Bacteria were the most commonly identified causative 
agents in infectious complications (n = 180, 90.9% of total identified organisms), followed by fungi (n = 15, 7.5%) 
and viruses (n = 4, 2.0%). Intra-abdominal infection (n =

14.2%, 0.026/1,000 patient-month). A small number of 
infections involving other organs were reported, including central nervous system infection and musculoskeletal infection. Of the total infectious complications, 71.4% 
occurred within 1 month of the operation. Infections acquired 3 months after the operation accounted for 8.3% 
of the total. 
Among microbiologically-documented intra-abdominal infections, Enterococcus species were found most frequently (n = 17, 49.3%), followed by Escherichia coli (n = 4) 
and Klebsiella species (n = 4). Among urinary tract infections in 30 patients, Enterococcus species were found in 
10 of them. Klebsiella species and E. coli belonging to enterobacteriaceae were also common causative organisms 
in urinary tract infection. In pneumonia, Gram-negative bacilli were more frequently identified as causative pathogens than Gram-positive bacteria. Among 
Gram-negative bacteria, 57.7% were non-fermenting, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, 
and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. CMV pneumonia (n = 
1, 3.4%), active pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 2, 6.8%), and 
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (n = 2, 6.8%) were reported in a small number of patients during follow-up. 
There was no case recorded of P. jirovecii pneumonia 
during follow-up. Coagulase-negative staphylococci 
(CoNS) were the most commonly isolated organisms in 
CLABSI (n = 13, 50% of total identified CLABSI).
DISCUSSION
LT recipients are especially vulnerable to infections 
due to the technical complexity of the surgical procedure and complications related to abdominal surgery 
and manipulation of the hepatobiliary system [1]. In this 
study, 89 of 185 patients had infectious complications 
during the follow-up (48.1%). This rate is comparable 
with that found in previous reports (37.3% to 76.9%) 
[5,9,10]. In this study we investigated risk factors for infectious complications during the perioperative period. 
By analyzing demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, 
we found that deceased-donor transplantation, high 
MELD scores, and acute rejection were significantly associated with infectious complications. 
In previous studies, a direct association between mortality and severity of preoperative clinical condition including infection and MELD score, has been observed 
[9,11]. The Italian Association for the Study of the Liver 
(AISF) has reported risk factors of post-LT infections, including MELD score > 30, level and type of immunosuppression, and primary non-function [12]. However, they 
did not mention that the risk of infection was increased 
when organs were derived from deceased-donors compared to when organs were obtained from living-donors 
[12]. Saner et al. [13] have reported that higher risks of 
pulmonary and blood stream infections in recipients 
of living donor organs might be due to smaller liver 
volumes and longer warm ischemia times. Their study 
investigated blood-stream infection (BSI) and pneumonia after LT surgery [13] without including other types 
of infectious complications. On the other hand, another 
study reported a higher prevalence of bacterial infection 
in deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT) than 
that in living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) [14]. 
The present study was conducted on a larger number 
of patients with a longer duration of follow-up for each 
patient than the previous study [14]. 
In a recently published Korean study, Kim et al. [15] 
investigated the epidemiology and clinical features of 
post-transplant BSI in LT recipients. In a 1-year period following LT, 112 episodes of BSI occurred in 64 of 
the 222 patients (28.8%) [15]. MELD score was shown as 
a risk factor of BSI in univariate analysis [15]. On the 
other hand, the type of donor did not show a significant 
difference between patients with BSI and patients without BSI [15]. In multivariate analysis, they reported biliary complications and longer ICU stay were significant 
independent risk factors of post-transplant BSI [15]. The 
distribution of identified bacteria was relatively similar to 
our study [15]. On the other hand, our study included not 
only BSI but also other types of infections and so in this 
regard our study provides significant new information.
The higher infection rate in the DDLT group in the 
present study could be due to several reasons. First, most 
of the patients who received DDLT had high MELD 
scores with poor systemic condition. Second, screening 
of transplant donors for infection is limited by available 
technology and the short period during which organs 
from deceased-donors can be used [16]. Patients who 
need liver transplantation have long wait times due to 
the lack of donors, especially in Korea [17]. Because of 
this, the priority for deceased-donor LT is given to pa-

tients with very poor liver function and prognosis [17]. 
Since the Korea organ-distribution law was passed in 
2000, the Child-Pugh score of patients in the waiting 
list has been used to distribute organs. This was before 
the liver donor law which passed recently. Since June 
1, 2016, the MELD score system instead of Child-Pugh 
score has been used, based on various studies [10]. The 
results of the present study provide new data to support 
the clinical importance of using MELD score instead 
of Child-Pugh to obtain better prognosis after surgery 
without infection. This study also showed that the risk 
of infection was increased in patients with acute rejection. Some studies have shown that the level of immunosuppression is a risk factor of infection after LT [2,6]. 
Possibly, patients with acute rejection are more vulnerable to infection because of the increased amount of immunosuppressive agents used. 
 Bacterial infections were the major causes of infectious complications, followed by fungal and viral infections. Among the causative bacterial species identified, 
Enterococcus species were leading pathogens, followed 
by E. coli and Klebsiella species. This is consistent with 
results of recent studies [2,5,6]. The most common infections in this study were intra-abdominal including 
infections of biliary tract. This was followed by urinary 
tract infections, pneumonia, and CLABSI. Although 
bundle approaches have been applied in our institution 
to prevent VAP, CLABSI, and catheter associated-urinary tract infections, these infections were found to be 
common in LT patients.
Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more common compared to Gram-positive bacteria among 
pathogens identified in pneumonia in this study. This 
is similar to results from a previous report about hospital-acquired pneumonia [2,18]. Non-fermenting 
gram-negative bacilli found in hospital environments, 
are reported to be responsible for hospital acquired infections [19]. Interestingly, S. maltophilia and A. baumannii were found to be important causative agents of pneumonia in our institution. The distribution of causative 
organisms of pneumonia in this study may be meaningful when selecting appropriate antibiotics.
CoNS accounted for half of the causative organisms 
in CLABSI. Therefore, better CLABSI prevention approaches are needed to achieve better management for 
LT patients. Kaido et al. [11] have reported that central 
venous catheterization of LT patients is significantly 
lowered through rapid central venous catheter removal 
and rapid intestinal dietary intake. To prevent CLABSI 
and catheter-associated urinary tract infection, it might 
be important to check appropriate implementation of 
bundle approach in all patients and consider rapid removal as soon as possible.
In this study, patients undergoing surgery after 2010 
were included. In a previous study using accumulated 
data from the last several years, a shift toward increased 
Gram-negative bacterial infections and emergence of 
multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens was documented [4]. Enterococcus species were found to be major 
pathogens in LT patients in the present study. From this 
point of view, clinicians should pay close attention to 
Enterococcus, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), in LT patients because the clinical importance 
of infection or colonization during the perioperative period due to VRE has been reported [20]. 
This study has several limitations. First, it was a retrospective study. Second, we included three children 
aged 10 years or older in this study. Third, as a single 
center study, the number of patients participating in the 
study was not as high as we would have liked. Fourth, 
this study did not review surgical techniques or intraoperative transfusions. Despite these limitations, this 
study was meaningful in that it was conducted with a 
considerable number of LT patients in Korea since 2010. 
The number of LTs performed in our institution in 5 
years was more than that in other institutions of Korea 
as single centers. 
In conclusion, high MELD score, deceased-donor 
type, and presence of acute rejection are associated 
with infectious-related morbidity of LT patients in this 
study. Since infection after liver transplantation is closely associated with postoperative prognosis, MELD score 
should be considered as an indicator when determining 
LT (DDLT or LDLT) recipients, before liver function deteriorates further.
