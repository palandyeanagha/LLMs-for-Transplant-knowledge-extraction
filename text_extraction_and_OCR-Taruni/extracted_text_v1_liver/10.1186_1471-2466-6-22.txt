Abstract
Background: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the integrated Practical Approach to Lung Health in South
Africa (PALSA) guideline in identifying patients requiring bacteriological screening for tuberculosis (TB), and to
determine which clinical features best predict suspected and bacteriologically-confirmed tuberculosis among
patients with respiratory symptoms.
Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional study in which 1392 adult patients with cough and/or difficult breathing,
attending a primary care facility in Cape Town, South Africa, were evaluated by a nurse using the guideline. The
accuracy of a nurse using the guideline to identify TB suspects was compared to that of primary care physicians'
diagnoses of (1) suspected TB, and (2) proven TB supported by clinical information and chest radiographs.
Results: The nurse using the guideline identified 516 patients as TB suspects compared with 365 by the primary
care physicians, representing a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71%–79%), specificity of 77% (95%
CI 74%–79%), positive predictive value of 53% (95% CI 49%–58%), negative predictive value of 90% (95% CI 88%–
92%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ARUC) of 0.76 (95% CI 0.74–0.79). Sputum
results were obtained in 320 of the 365 primary care physicians TB suspects (88%); 40 (13%) of these were
positive for TB. Only 4 cases were not identified by the nurse using the guideline. The primary care physicians
diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing bacteriologically-confirmed TB (n = 320) was as follows: sensitivity 90% (95% CI
76%–97%), specificity 65% (95% CI 63%–68%), negative predictive value 7% (95% CI 5%–10%), positive predictive
value 99.5% (95% CI 98.8%–99.8%), and ARUC 0.78 (95% CI 0.73–0.82). Weight loss, pleuritic pain, and night
sweats were independently associated with the diagnosis of bacteriologically-confirmed tuberculosis (positive
likelihood ratio if all three present = 16.7, 95% CI 5.9–29.4).

Conclusion: The PALSA guideline is an effective screening tool for identifying patients requiring bacteriological
screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in this primary care setting. This supports the randomized trial finding that
use of the guideline increased TB case detection.
Background
Tuberculosis (TB) has been declared a global emergency,[1] with the incidence rising by one percent each
year [2]. In 2003 the global TB case-detection rate was
only 45%, falling short of the global target of 75% [3].
One reason cited for the under-detection of TB in highprevalence areas has been the failure of healthcare workers to consider TB in the differential diagnosis of patients
with respiratory symptoms, resulting in diagnostic delays
[4-6].
The Practical Approach to Lung Health in South Africa
(PALSA) initiative is the South African adaptation of the
World Health Organisation's (WHO) Stop-TB Practical
Approach to Lung Health (PAL) strategy [7]. It was developed to improve the detection and management of common respiratory diseases, including TB, through the
integration of vertical respiratory programmes in
resource-poor settings. In South Africa nurses provide
most primary care and often have limited physician support [8]. Many are inadequately skilled and equipped for
accurate diagnosis [9], which includes distinguishing
between several respiratory diseases with similar clinical
presentations. PALSA therefore focuses on enabling primary nurse care practitioners to function as frontline clinicians through the provision of an evidence-based
guideline that integrates TB with other common respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD, and respiratory tract
infections. The guideline identifies syndromes using
symptoms and signs that best predict each disease (see
Additional file 1).
Guidelines have been shown to be effective if tailored to
local circumstances and practices [10]. The PALSA guideline therefore considers conditions in local primary
healthcare facilities and is consistent with national drug
and health department policies. Additionally, it was
developed in consultation with various stakeholders and
key roleplayers to encourage local ownership. This is the
first documented attempt to integrate respiratory diseases
into a single syndromic guideline in South Africa.
The effectiveness of a clinical practice guideline designed
to change professional practice is best evaluated by means
of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, as we have
done before [11]. In this study, we aimed to evaluate how
accurately the integrated algorithmic PALSA guideline
detected respiratory diseases when applied to patients
with cough and/or difficult breathing. We therefore determined the diagnostic accuracy of the guideline, as used by
a nurse, to identify patients requiring bacteriological
screening for TB. The two reference standards were (1)
suspicion of pulmonary TB by a primary care physican
using clinical judgment about symptoms, signs and radiology results (without the results of sputum tests), and (2)
diagnosis of pulmonary TB by a primary care physician
using clinical judgment about symptoms, signs and radiology results, with confirmation by bacteriological testing
of TB suspects. A second objective was to identify the clinical variables that best predicted patients requiring screening for TB, and patients with bacteriologically-confirmed
TB, in this setting.
Methods
The guideline
The PALSA guideline [see Additional file 1] was developed
over a period of one year by a working group comprising
respiratory specialists, primary care and public health
practitioners, a pharmacist, and health systems researchers. Focus group sessions with nurses, primary care doctors, health department managers and local experts
elicited their practices, needs, and views on the content
and practicality of the guideline. National policies and
programmes such as the South African National Tuberculosis Control [12] and Essential Drugs List [13] programmes were adhered to. Literature was reviewed to
determine the individual and combination of symptoms
and signs that best predicted each respiratory condition or
syndrome.
The criteria for entry into the study were cough and/or difficult breathing in patients aged 15 years and older. In the
algorithm, the presence of these symptoms for 2 weeks or
longer distinguished chronic from acute diseases. Features
of a chronic presentation that prompted the need for
screening for TB included cough and/or difficult breathing
for more than 2 weeks with or without fever, pain on
breathing or coughing, sputum production, unexplained
weight loss, loss of appetite, night sweats, fever, bloodstained sputum or frank haemoptysis, and/or known positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test or clinical
acquired-immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Features
of an acute presentation considered to require screening
for TB were cough and/difficult breathing for less than 2
weeks in patients with fever, pain on breathing or coughing, and/or sputum production. To encourage screening
for TB, the algorithm reminds users to consider tuberculosis at several decision points. Instructions in the algorithm

advise on the selection and timing of investigations, referral and follow up. When TB is suspected, the instruction is
to send sputum for bacteriological testing. In the current
validation study, however, the primary care physicians
rather than the nurse using the guideline requested sputum tests on patients they considered to require bacteriological screening for TB.
Patient population
The study was conducted at a large primary care clinic in
Cape Town, South Africa, from November 2002 to
December 2003. This centre is attended by approximately
9000 patients each month, and provides a 24-hour accident and an emergency service, and an outpatient clinic
that operates on weekdays only. Eligible patients were
identified by the study nurse from among patients presenting to the triage nurse in the waiting room by asking,
"Do you have a cough and/or difficulty breathing?".
Those 15 years and older who responded positively were
eligible for inclusion unless they refused to provide written consent, were known to have severe psychiatric problems or required urgent care. Enrolment took place during
usual consulting hours (07 h 30 to 17 h 00 from Mondays
to Fridays).
The diagnosis of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis was
made on-site independently by a nurse using the guideline without radiology, primary care physicians with the
assistance of a chest radiograph and later, off-site by a respiratory physician also with the assistance of chest radiography.
Nurse practitioner diagnosis of suspected tuberculosis
The nurse practitioner obtained a medical history from
each patient, recorded vital signs and made up to three
diagnoses in each subject based upon the PALSA guideline. As the purpose of the study was to assess the performance of the guideline, the nurse was instructed to follow
the guideline's diagnostic algorithms rigidly and not to
employ additional judgement. She remained blinded to
the results of the radiographs and the assessments made
by the primary care and respiratory physicians.
Primary care physician diagnosis of tuberculosis
On completing the interview with the nurse, patients were
assessed by one of two primary care physicians who were
blinded to the nurse using the guideline's diagnoses. Both
primary care physicians had over 6 years postgraduate
clinical experience. They performed flow volume loops
before and after inhalation of 200 μg of salbutamol
administered from a pressurised metered dose inhaler,
using a PM1 Spirometer (Erich Jaeger®, Germany). A chest
radiograph (lateral and postero-anterior views) was performed on each patient. The primary care physicians systematically recorded the patients' clinical details, the
results of spirometry and chest radiography, and their
diagnoses made without the assistance of the PALSA
guideline. They recorded their levels of confidence in each
diagnosis made, using a 5-point Likert scale (1 representing the lowest level of confidence and 5 the highest level
of confidence or certainty). In all subjects in whom even a
low level of suspicion of tuberculosis was recorded, sputum specimens for examination and culture were
obtained. A first specimen was collected immediately and
a second specimen the following day. The sodium citrate
method was used to process the smears, which was examined for Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) by one reader after staining
with Ziehl-Neelsen. A positive smear was reported if at
least one AFB per 100 immersion fields. Sputa were cultured on a slope of Löwenstein-Jensen medium and incubated at 37°C for about six weeks. Bacteriological
confirmation of tuberculosis was accepted if two sputum
smears collected on different days were positive as
reported above, or the presence of a positive culture and
one or no positive smear.
Respiratory physician diagnosis of suspected tuberculosis
All records and investigations collected by the primary
care physicians, were provided off-site to one of two specialist respiratory physicians, who were required to make
clinical diagnoses, including suspected TB. They were
blinded to the nurse using the guideline and primary care
physicians' diagnoses, to whether sputum had been
tested, and to the results of sputum examination. The respiratory physicians recorded up to four diagnoses on each
patient, and recorded the certainty of each diagnosis in the
same manner as the primary care physician (see above).
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint was performance of the nurse using
the guideline as the first part of a two-step screening process. The respiratory physician diagnosis served as the comparator for the identification of patients requiring such
screening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood
ratios, and areas under receiver operating characteristic
curves were calculated for each test compared with reference standards. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals
(95% CI) for proportions were calculated based on binomial distributions.
Logistic regression models identified clinical features that
independently predicted diagnoses of suspected and bacteriologically-proven tuberculosis. Potential predictors
were selected for inclusion in logistic regression models
(after examining cross tabulations between each predictor
and the reference standard diagnosis) if significantly (P <
0.05) associated with the outcome and if the crude odds
ratios were more than 2 or less than 0.5. Variables were
excluded from the models if not independently associated

with the reference standard, and if their odds ratios were
less than 0.5 and more than 2, aiming for a parsimonious
model of powerful predictors. Independent (mutually
adjusted) associations between each predictor and the reference standard diagnosis were then expressed as likelihood ratios instead of odds ratios. This entailed adjusting
crude likelihood ratios with shrinkage factors obtained by
logistic regression, as described by Spiegelhalter and KnillJones [14]. The adjusted likelihood ratios of different predictors can be multiplied by each other because they are
independent. Confidence intervals for adjusted likelihood
ratios were estimated by non-parametric bootstrapping of
logistic regressions, with 2000 replications, and using the
bias-corrected percentile method [15]. Data were analysed
using STATA release 8 statistical software.
The study was approved by the research ethics committee
of the University of Cape Town. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients before participation.
Results
Patients' characteristics
Fourteen hundred patients were enrolled and 1392 were
eligible for analysis (Figure 1). Eight were excluded; 6
withdrew consent, 1 was screened twice and 1 was unable
to give a detailed history. The median age of those analysed was 48 years (range 15–89) and 63% were female.
Most patients were current smokers (48%) or ex-smokers
(29%), and 63% (873) had previously been diagnosed
with obstructive lung disease (asthma in 592 (43%) and
COPD in 241 (20%)), while 38% had a history of cardiovascular disease (including hypertension, ischaemic and
other forms of cardiac disease). Two hundred and two
(15%) reported previously having been treated for tuberculosis (Table 1).
Nurse versus primary care physician
The nurse diagnosed 516 (37%) patients as TB suspects,
whereas the primary care physicians identified 365 (26%)
of patients as suspected TB. The diagnostic accuracy of the
nurse using the guideline as compared to the primary care
physicians' diagnoses (Table 2) was: sensitivity 76%
(95%CI 71%–79%), specificity 77% (95%CI 74%–79%),
positive predictive value (PPV) 53% (95%CI 49%–58%),
and negative predictive value (NPV) 90 (95%CI 88%–
92%).
Sputum for microbiological testing was obtained from
342 (94%) of the primary care physicians TB suspects.
Sputum could not be obtained in 23 (6%) patients.
Tuberculosis was confirmed bacteriologically in 40 (12%)
of the 342 patients investigated by sputum examination.
Twenty four (60%) were smear positive, 5 (12%) smear
and culture positive, and 11 (28%) culture positive only.
The sensitivity of the nurse using the guideline to detect
patients with proven tuberculosis was 90% (95%CI 76%–
97%), specificity was 65% (95%CI 63%–68%), PPV was
7% (95%CI 5%–10%), and NPV was 99.5% (95%CI
98.8%–99.8%) (Table 2). Eight (20%) of the 40 patients
had reported cough and/or breathing for less than two
weeks and 16 (40%) were also diagnosed with asthma or
COPD by the primary care physicians. The proportion of
patients with bacteriological confirmation increased with
increasing certainty of the primary care physicians diagnostic rating (Table 3).
Nurse versus respiratory physician
The respiratory physicians identified 262 (19%) patients
as suspected tuberculosis. The primary care physicians
identified 152 more patients for TB screening than the respiratory physicians, 6 of whom were later proven to have
tuberculosis. The diagnostic accuracy of the nurse using
the guideline compared to the respiratory physicians'
diagnoses of suspected TB was as follows (Table 2): sensitivity 73% ((95%CI 67%–78%), specificity 71% (95%CI
68%–74%), PPV 37% (33%–41%), NPV 92% (95%CI
90%–94%), and area under the ROC curve 0.72 (95%CI
0.69–0.75).

Symptoms predictive of tuberculosis
The most common symptoms in patients proven to have
TB were cough (100%), followed by difficult breathing
(70%), new sputum production (63%), loss of weight
(50%), and night sweats (50%) (Table 4). Three clinical
features independently predicted the diagnosis of TB. In
decreasing order they were pleuritic chest pain, weight
loss, night sweats (Table 5). The presence of all 3
increased the likelihood of TB 17 times, compared to if
none were present. Features associated with the diagnosis
of suspected TB by the respiratory physicians were haemoptysis, weight loss, night sweats, previous TB, pleuritic
chest pain, absence of difficulty breathing, and absence of
wheeze. The presence of all 7 increased the likelihood of
the respiratory physicians diagnosing TB 594-fold.

Discussion
In primary care in many developing countries, the initial
responsibility for identifying patients who require screening for tuberculosis lies with nurse practitioners, especially in rural clinics. The PALSA guideline, which
integrates symptoms and signs predicting tuberculosis
with those of other respiratory diseases, serves as a diagnostic aid and as a potential means of increasing TB case
detection, particularly in settings where the resources,
skills and knowledge base is limited. The current study
confirms that a nurse practitioner using the guideline is
able to perform this task with sufficient accuracy when
compared with the alternative – a primary care physician
with access to more clinical details, and chest radiography.
The diagnostic utility of the PALSA guideline as demonstrated in this study is supported by the results of a pragmatic randomised control trial in which the guideline was
used in rural clinics in the Free State province of South
Africa [16]. In this study, use of the guideline, supported
by illustrated materials and an educational outreach programme was associated with a 68% increase in the rate of
tuberculosis case detection.
The fact that the nurse using the guideline demonstrated a
high sensitivity, negative predictive value, and positive
likelihood ratio when compared to the respiratory and
primary care physicians, validates the approach of using
syndromic 'diagnoses' in primary care for identifying
patients requiring screening for tuberculosis. In such settings, high sensitivity is achieved at the expense of specificity. Thus, while it is unlikely that a 'positive' case will be
missed, the low specificity will result in additional effort
and expenditure on false positive patients. In the case of
tuberculosis this will result in additional use of resources
for sputum examination. This is reflected in the ratio of
suspected to bacteriologically-confirmed cases which for
the nurse using the guideline was 13:1, compared with 9:1
and 5:1 for the primary care and respiratory physicians,
respectively. These values compare satisfactorily with the
ratio for high prevalence populations of 10:1 recommended for high prevalence countries [17].
While the performance of the PALSA guideline was satisfactory in the population in which it was tested, it is recognised that the efficiency of a screening test is influenced
by disease prevalence, which in this study was 3%. If the
tuberculosis prevalence had been higher, the yield from
screening would have been higher. Conversely, in lower
tuberculosis prevalence settings the yield from screening
would be lower. The current guideline therefore appears
appropriate for primary care conditions in South Africa
where notification rates for bacteriologically-confirmed
pulmonary TB was 612 per 100,000 in 2002 [18].
One of the challenges of diagnosing TB in primary care is
distinguishing symptoms of TB from those of other common respiratory diseases [19]. The PALSA guideline
encourages the nurse practitioner to consider more than
one diagnosis, with the aim of not only improving TB case
detection, but also of improving recognition and the care
of patients with other respiratory diseases. A striking feature of our study is the high proportion of our study population (63%) who had previously been diagnosed with
chronic airways disease (asthma or COPD), one of which
was present in 30% of patients in whom TB was confirmed. This has been observed in other countries in
which integrated diagnostic guidelines have been
employed, and illustrates the need for integrated diagnostic guidelines that do not focus on TB alone, but seek to
identify other common respiratory diseases that require
management.

In common with other studies, cough, difficult breathing,
sputum production, weight loss, and night sweats, were
common presenting features in patients with bacteriologically-confirmed tuberculosis [10,21,22]. We also analysed the predictive value of individual symptoms in
patients diagnosed and suspected of TB. The absence of
difficulty breathing best predicted suspected tuberculosis
(Table 4) and suggests that this symptom should not be
included in diagnostic algorithms for TB. The independent predictors: night sweats, loss of weight, and pleuritic
chest pain all formed part of the PALSA algorithmic definition of suspected tuberculosis. The guideline can be
simplified further by removal of criteria that do not add to
the prediction of suspected tuberculosis. The likelihood
ratios (LRs) in our study have been adjusted for their nondependence. They may be applied to individual patients
by multiplication of the LRs of symptoms present in that
patient. For example, a primary care physician was 53
times more likely diagnose tuberculosis if weight loss,
pleuritic pain, and raised temperature were present and
the patient was not producing sputum, than if none of
these predictors was present (Table 4). The LRs, rather
than the sensitivity and specificity, were derived to permit
extrapolation of the results to other settings with different
prevalences of disease [23].
Use of a two-week rather than a three week cut-off for TB
suspects in a general primary care clinic setting in a high
prevalence country has previously been shown to increase
the case-detection rate [24]. In high prevalence areas a
minority of patients with TB present with cough for less
than 2 or 3 weeks. In our study restricting screening to
those with a cough for 2 weeks or longer would have
resulted in failure to detect one-fifth of the confirmed
cases. In an Ethiopian study in a high TB and HIV burden
areas, patients with a cough of short duration (of 1 to 3
weeks), when associated one or more of the following;
weight loss, absence of response to a short course of antibiotics, and/or living in overcrowded place, were associated with the diagnosis of TB [25]. Thirty-five percent of
such patients had TB. Our study confirms that in high TB
prevalence settings, TB should be suspected in all patients
with cough, even when of a shorter duration than 2 weeks.
The methodological strengths of our study are the large
sample of clinically diverse patients, the prospectively
recorded and detailed clinical information on each
patient, and the blinded diagnoses made by the nurse and
the non-specialist and specialist physicians. The sample of
patients was representative of those attending a primary
health care clinic with respiratory symptoms. The fact that
tuberculosis was diagnosed in patients presenting with
other diagnoses emphasises the importance of considering tuberculosis in all patients at each visit in high prevalence areas even when other diagnoses are known. The
study's main limitation was the absence of sputum testing
in patients in whom the primary care physicians did not
suspect tuberculosis. We were therefore not able to use
bacteriological diagnosis of TB as the reference standard.
However, our aim was to examine the performance of the
first stage of a 2-stage screening process; the nurse using a
guideline against the generally accepted approach of a primary care physician who has access to sputum testing and
a chest radiograph. The availability of chest radiography
may be useful in detecting in TB with typical chest radiograph findings, [26] and would have therefore been likely

to have improved the diagnostic accuracy of the primary
care physicians. This is supported by the association of the
certainty of diagnosis of the primary care physicians with
sputum positivity, suggesting that it is unlikely that those
that they viewed as not requiring sputum examination
had active TB.
Conclusion
The study shows that, compared with primary care physicians who had with access to chest radiographs and more
clinical information, a nurse practioner using the PALSA
syndromic respiratory guideline was able to identify
patients who require bacteriological screening for pulmonary tuberculosis, from among those presenting with respiratory symptoms in a high tuberculosis prevalence area.
