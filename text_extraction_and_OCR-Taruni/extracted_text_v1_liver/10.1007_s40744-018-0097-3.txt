ABSTRACT
Introduction: Post-marketing surveillance
(PMS) is an integral part of monitoring adverse
events (AEs) following approval of new drugs.
Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An
analysis of PMS reports was conducted to evaluate the safety of tofacitinib in a post-marketing
setting.
Methods: Worldwide tofacitinib PMS data
received in the Pfizer safety database from
November 6, 2012 (first marketing authorization of tofacitinib) to November 5, 2015 were
analyzed. Serious AEs (SAEs) of interest were
reviewed and reporting rates (RRs) were calculated by dividing the number of SAEs by the
estimated 100 patient-years of exposure. Patient
exposure was calculated based on estimated
worldwide sales and an estimated daily regimen
of tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily.
Results: During the 3-year reporting period,
worldwide post-marketing exposure to tofacitinib since approval was estimated to be 34,223
patient-years. In total, 9291 case reports (82.9%
non-serious) were received and 25,417 AEs, 102
fatal cases, and 4352 SAEs were reported. The
RRs (per 100 patient-years) for SAEs of interest
by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
System Organ Class were 2.57 for infections,
0.91 for gastrointestinal disorders, 0.60 for respiratory disorders, 0.45 for neoplasms, 0.43 for
cardiac disorders, and 0.12 for hepatobiliary
disorders.
Conclusions: Although there are limitations to
these data, no new safety risks were revealed in
this real-world setting compared with the safety
profile identified in the tofacitinib RA clinical
development program. Any risks identified
through the tofacitinib development program
and PMS will continue to be monitored through
pharmacovigilance surveillance.

INTRODUCTION
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic
autoimmune disease associated with joint pain
and inflammation, potentially resulting in joint
destruction. Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase
inhibitor for the treatment of RA. Clinical efficacy and safety of tofacitinib have been established in numerous patient populations with
active RA in phase 2 [1] and phase 3 [2–7] randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and long-term
extension (LTE) studies [8, 9].
Tofacitinib received first marketing authorization in the United States (US) on November 6, 2012 for the treatment of adults with
moderately to severely active RA and an inadequate response/intolerance to methotrexate. As
of November 2015 (data-cut for analysis),
tofacitinib was approved in 46 countries and
marketed in 29 countries. Tofacitinib has since
received marketing authorization in the European Union and is currently approved in over
80 countries worldwide. In most countries, the
approved tofacitinib dose for RA is 5 mg twice
daily (BID); a 10 mg BID dose is approved in
Botswana, Switzerland, and Russia. An extended-release formulation, dosed at 11 mg once
daily, has been approved in the US for the same
indication.
Post-marketing surveillance (PMS) is integral
to adverse event (AE) monitoring following
regulatory approval of drugs. PMS complements
phase 3 and LTE safety data to establish a realworld safety profile. A pooled analysis of tofacitinib-treated patients during phase 1, 2, 3, and
LTE studies (to March 2015) found that AEs
were generally stable over time, with no new
safety risks versus previous reports [10]. PMS
includes spontaneous or voluntary reporting of
AEs, post-marketing observational studies, or
active surveillance.
We aimed to evaluate the safety of tofacitinib in the post-marketing setting using spontaneous/non-interventional solicited PMS
reports (i.e., market research where the product
was not offered but AE data were collected) and
non-study literature cases (i.e., cases not reported in a study but published as a case report)
during the 3 years following first marketing
authorization.
METHODS
Data Sources
This analysis reviewed worldwide tofacitinib
PMS data in the Pfizer safety database from
November 6, 2012 to November 5, 2015. Most
were from post-marketing reports spontaneously submitted to Pfizer by healthcare professionals or patients. Additional data included
non-interventional solicited reports (e.g., Pfizersponsored adherence or consumer support programs) and non-study literature case reports
identified during routine pharmacovigilance
review. The PMS data used in this analysis were
not collected as part of a clinical study and were
non-interventional, therefore ethics approval
was not required.
Estimated Worldwide Post-Marketing
Exposure
Worldwide exposure estimates are based on
audited standard unit tofacitinib sales (SUs)
from IMS Health’s Multinational Integrated
Data Analysis System (MIDAS) database through
June 30, 2015. These were estimated by extrapolating the growth rate from the previous
quarter, which was prorated to the end of the
reporting period and converted into patientdays (days of therapy) using average daily dose.
Patient-years were calculated by dividing
patient-days by 365.25.
The following are important considerations
when utilizing data from the IMS Health databases. Tofacitinib is often sold in specialty
pharmacies, which may not be captured in the
MIDAS audit for all countries, potentially leading to under-reporting of units sold. Unit data
from the MIDAS audit reflects units sold but not
whether the drug was prescribed/taken by a
patient. Furthermore, the IMS Prescriber
Insights medical and prescription data used are
not captured from all markets where tofacitinib
is available. Therefore, total prescriptions are
284 Rheumatol Ther (2018) 5:283–291

estimated by extrapolating from those where
tofacitinib sales are captured. Additionally, the
patient-years metric does not represent unique
patient counts.
Data Analysis
For each case report, the type and frequency of
serious AEs (SAEs) of interest by the Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)
System Organ Class (SOC) were reviewed; SAEs
included infections, neoplasms, and gastrointestinal (GI), hepatobiliary, respiratory, and
cardiac disorders. The seriousness of AEs was
assessed using International Conference on
Harmonisation criteria: an event was considered serious if it resulted in hospitalization or
caused disability. The reporting rate (RR) for
SAEs of special interest per MedDRA SOC by
6-month interval was estimated by dividing the
SAE number by the estimated 100 patient-years
of exposure. Multiple events could be reported
in the same case report and were considered
separate events. Percentages of AEs were calculated by dividing the case number [by MedDRA
Preferred Term (PT) or SOC] by the total number
of cases. Results are reported descriptively.
RESULTS
During the reporting period, the worldwide
post-marketing exposure to tofacitinib, based
on estimated worldwide sales and a regimen of
tofacitinib 5 mg BID, was 34,223 patient-years.
Overall, 9291 case reports were received,
including 56.3% reported by healthcare professionals; 9206 (99.1%) were spontaneous reports,
77 (0.8%) were from non-interventional solicited sources, and eight (0.1%) were non-study
literature cases. Most originated in the US
(73.9%). Other countries with large contributions ([100) included Canada, Argentina,
Colombia, Australia, and Switzerland. Of cases
with reported gender (92.9%) or age (79.2%),
78.2% occurred in females, and median age was
60 years. Of the cases where information on
medical history was available, in addition to RA,
the other most commonly reported ([150 cases
per PT) pre-existing medical conditions by PT
included drug hypersensitivity, hypertension,
drug ineffective, osteoarthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetes mellitus,
hypersensitivity, fibromyalgia, and
hypothyroidism.
Overall, 25,417 AEs were reported through
November 5, 2015; 82.9% were non-serious.
The MedDRA SOCs with the most reported AEs
included general, GI, and musculoskeletal disorders. The most reported AEs by PT (Fig. 1)
included drug ineffective (13.2%), headache
(9.0%), pain (6.4%), fatigue (6.0%), nausea
(6.0%), condition aggravated (5.9%), diarrhea
(5.8%), and arthralgia (5.2%).
Overall, 4352 SAEs were reported; RRs for
SAEs of special interest by SOC are presented in
Table 1. The most reported SAEs by PT (Fig. 2)
included RA (4.5%), condition aggravated
(3.4%; any condition [RA or other] that worsened), pneumonia (1.7%), and arthropathy
(1.2%).
Infections
Serious infections were the most reported SAEs
by SOC (879 events), with an RR of 2.57 per 100
patient-years. Estimated RR was highest in the
first year and generally decreased over time. The
most common serious infections by PT (number
of events) were pneumonia (158), lower respiratory tract/respiratory tract infection (71), urinary tract infection (53), diverticulitis (37),
kidney infection (35), sepsis (31), Staphylococcal infection (28), cellulitis (25), lung infection
(24), and infection (21).
Several SAEs with PTs (events) indicative of
potential opportunistic infections (OIs) were
identified, including disseminated herpes zoster
(HZ; seven), tuberculosis (six), pneumonia
cryptococcal (three), Candida infection/esophageal candidiasis/oropharyngeal candidiasis (two
each), histoplasmosis (two), cytomegalovirus
colitis/gastritis/esophagitis (one each), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (one), and unspecified
OI (two). Two histoplasmosis events (not previously reported in tofacitinib RCTs) were
reported.
Rheumatol Ther (2018) 5:283–291 285

Neoplasms
The most reported neoplasm SAEs by PT
(events) included lymphoma (13), neoplasm
malignant (11), skin cancer (ten), lung neoplasm malignant (eight), basal cell carcinoma
(eight), breast cancer (six), squamous cell carcinoma (six), malignant melanoma (six), brain
neoplasm (five), squamous cell carcinoma of the
skin (four), prostate cancer (four), uterine cancer (four), and colon cancer (four).
Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was the
most reported malignancy in RA patients
receiving tofacitinib in PMS, with 16 serious (as
assessed by case processor) cases of NMSC
reported, including basal cell carcinoma (eight)
and squamous cell carcinoma (ten; two cases
had both basal and squamous cell carcinoma).
Ten cases with unspecified skin cancer were
reported.
There were 15 reported cases of lymphoma
by PT (events), including lymphoma (13), B-cell
lymphoma (two), and extranodal marginal zone
B-cell lymphoma (one). One case was reported
with systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
with central nervous system involvement.
Three others were reported with lymphoma and
unspecified brain neoplasm, however it was
unclear whether the brain neoplasm events
were secondary to the spread of lymphoma.
There was no increase in reporting frequency of
lymphoma over time.
Estimated RRs for neoplasm events by
6-month interval ranged from 0.14 to 0.69 per
100 patient-years, with an overall rate of 0.45
per 100 patient-years (Table 1). The RR was
highest after the first year and stabilized
thereafter.
GI and Hepatobiliary Events
The most reported GI-related SAEs (events)
included diarrhea (24), nausea (24), abdominal
pain/abdominal pain upper (21), vomiting (20),
hematochezia (15), GI perforation (nine), GI
hemorrhage/GI disorder (eight each), and pancreatitis (eight). RRs appeared to decrease over
time, with an RR of 0.91 per 100 patient-years.

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal
pain represent identified adverse drug reactions
(ADRs; AEs caused by the drug) of tofacitinib.
Most patients with GI hemorrhage reports had
pre-existing GI conditions, or were receiving
concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs or anticoagulants. Of the eight cases of GI
hemorrhage/GI disorder reported post-marketing, two involved the same patient who was
hospitalized twice (1 month apart) due to the
same event. The patient recovered from both
episodes. Although a possible causal

relationship between the event and tofacitinib
could not be excluded, concomitant
methotrexate, prednisone, and naproxen may
have contributed. Limited information was
available for the remaining cases.
There were 25 cases reported with PTs
(events) indicative of potential GI perforation,
including GI perforation (nine), large intestinal
perforation (four), intestinal perforation (three),
diverticular perforation (three), appendicitis
perforated (two), gastric perforation (two), gastric ulcer perforation (one), small intestinal
hemorrhage (one), and GI hemorrhage (one).
One patient recorded GI perforation and
intestinal perforation. In two cases with reported intestinal hemorrhage, concomitant drugs
(e.g., methotrexate, ibuprofen, prednisone,
meloxicam) or medical history/concurrent
conditions (e.g., diverticulitis, bowel infection)
could not be excluded from contributing to
these events, together with tofacitinib
treatment.
Respiratory Events
Overall, 207 respiratory SAEs were reported (estimated RR: 0.60 per 100 patient-years). The
most reported SAEs by PT (event) were dyspnea
(44; tofacitinib ADR), pulmonary embolism
(15), interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pulmonary
fibrosis (15), chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (13), pulmonary edema (ten), pulmonary thrombosis (nine), epistaxis (eight),
pulmonary mass (seven), cough (six), and
pleural effusion (six).
ILD events are an important potential risk for
tofacitinib. Of the 207 respiratory SAEs by PT,
nine cases were ILD and six were pulmonary
fibrosis; two reported previous history of ILD.
Cardiac Events
Overall, 147 cardiac events were recorded, with
a numeric decrease in estimated RR over time,
from 1.55 to 0.29 per 100 patient-years at the
first 6-month interval and final 6-month interval, respectively. The most reported events by
PT (events) included myocardial infarction (29),
cardiac failure/cardiac failure congestive (21),
cardiac disorder (19), atrial fibrillation (17),
cardiac arrest (five), coronary artery disease
(four), pericardial effusion (four), and tachycardia (three).

Deaths
There were 102 deaths during the reporting
period, giving an overall mortality rate of 0.3
per 100 patient-years, which was stable over
time (Table 1). Of the 36 events with available
cause of death information, reported causes
(events) were infection-related AEs (15), cardiovascular events (eight), stroke (four), pulmonary embolism (two), ILD (two),
demyelination (one), Stevens–Johnson syndrome (one), and procedure complications
(one). Efforts to obtain additional information
for the remaining cases are ongoing; cases will
be re-assessed as information becomes available.
DISCUSSION
It is estimated that, as of August 2017, 102,214
patients worldwide have received tofacitinib
(data on file); it is therefore important that
tofacitinib safety is evaluated in patients with
real-world experience. This analysis evaluated
PMS reports for tofacitinib in RA over a 3-year
period after first marketing authorization. AEs
were consistent with the safety profile observed
during RCTs [1–8, 10].
AEs were presented by PT, as opposed to
SOC; however, some of the PTs relate to loss of
efficacy rather than ADRs. For example, ‘drug
ineffective’ was the most reported AE. The most
recorded SAEs by SOC also related to loss of
efficacy of tofacitinib, followed by serious
infections; however, the RR of these events
decreased over time. A small number of potential OI SAEs included disseminated HZ and
tuberculosis, consistent with the incidence of
HZ [11], tuberculosis, and other OIs [12]
observed across tofacitinib RA RCTs. Baseline
tuberculosis screening status was not included
in the PMS reports. Two histoplasmosis cases
were recorded in the PMS; this was not reported
during tofacitinib RA RCTs, but both cases
originated in US regions where histoplasmosis is
endemic.
Consistent with the tofacitinib label, the
most common GI SAEs by PT were diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; all
known ADRs for tofacitinib. Pancreatitis and GI
perforations were reported in PMS and risk of
these events is monitored though pharmacovigilance surveillance; however, potential
contributory factors include concomitant medications (e.g., methotrexate and prednisone).
Although pancreatitis has been reported in RA
RCTs and PMS, data do not indicate an
increased risk of pancreatitis with tofacitinib.
The types of malignancies reported in PMS
were consistent with tofacitinib RA RCTs. The
most common neoplasms reported in both settings were NMSCs. Overall neoplasm rates in
the tofacitinib RA clinical program and PMS did
not increase with increasing tofacitinib exposure [13]. In PMS, 15 lymphoma cases were
reported over approximately 34,000 patientyears of exposure as of November 5, 2015. The
RR of lymphoma did not increase over time.
Risk of lymphoma with tofacitinib continues to
be monitored through routine and enhanced
pharmacovigilance activities. Consistent with
data from tofacitinib RA LTEs, PMS data do not
suggest an increased risk of cardiac events with
tofacitinib.
Review of reported deaths did not suggest an
increased risk of death with tofacitinib; no new
safety information was identified versus RCTs.
The most reported causes were consistent with
those observed during tofacitinib RA RCTs,
including infections and cardiovascular events.
The following limitations should be considered. Case reports are often submitted voluntarily; the magnitude of under-reporting is
unknown. Importantly, some clinical information is often missing or incompletely recorded.
Patients’ age, pre-existing comorbidities,
underlying RA, and concomitant medications
could not be excluded as contributing to AEs,
and due to the limited information on medical
history captured in the spontaneous reports, it
is not feasible to analyze the reported events by
patients’ pre-existing conditions to tease out
any confounding effects. The spontaneous
reporting system utilized in PMS yields RRs
rather than incidence rates, limiting betweendrug comparisons.
Furthermore, RRs were calculated at the
event level; there may have been correlations
for events that occurred within the same
patients. The RR may therefore be different at
Rheumatol Ther (2018) 5:283–291 289

the patient level, and it cannot be adjusted for
patient demographic characteristics. Patient
exposure in PMS is calculated based on sales
data rather than clinical trial data; comparisons
between PMS and integrated safety database
rates cannot be made. Additionally, it is difficult
to make age- and gender-adjusted comparisons
with the non-tofacitinib RA population. PMS
data for other biologic therapies for RA have
been published in patients with RA; however, in
contrast to the worldwide tofacitinib data presented here, these reports only present countryspecific data [14, 15]. Additional disproportionality analysis (e.g., proportional reporting
ratios) or Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinkage
would enable between-drug comparisons,
although these are beyond the scope of this
analysis. Furthermore, reported rates are based
on estimated exposure based on commercial
records, rather than actual exposure (i.e.,
exposure time was not censored at time of
event). A known phenomenon in drug reporting is the Weber effect, which predicts higher
AE RRs within the first 2 years of drug approval,
decreasing thereafter, possibly due to reduced
reporting of mild AEs. The data analyzed here
were recorded within 3 years of marketing
authorization; therefore, the Weber effect
should be considered when interpreting early
estimated RRs. Finally, an accumulation of AE
reports may not necessarily indicate causation
by the drug, and may relate to underlying diseases, comorbidities, or other factors. Despite
these limitations, PMS data are important for
characterizing safety profiles of medications in a
real-world setting, including possible detection
of new safety signals.
CONCLUSIONS
Based on this review of PMS data for tofacitinib
in RA, the types of AEs and RRs were consistent
with the known tofacitinib safety profile, with
no new safety risks identified. Risks identified
during the tofacitinib development program
continue to be monitored through pharmacovigilance surveillance.
