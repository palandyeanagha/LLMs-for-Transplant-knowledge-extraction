Vasoplegic syndrome following
cardiothoracic surgery—review of
pathophysiology and update of
treatment options
Laurence W. Busse1,2* , Nicholas Barker3 and Christopher Petersen4
Abstract
Vasoplegic syndrome is a common occurrence following cardiothoracic surgery and is characterized as a highoutput shock state with poor systemic vascular resistance. The pathophysiology is complex and includes
dysregulation of vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive properties of smooth vascular muscle cells. Specific bypass
machine and patient factors play key roles in occurrence. Research into treatment of this syndrome is limited and
extrapolated primarily from that pertaining to septic shock, but is evolving with the expanded use of
catecholamine-sparing agents. Recent reports demonstrate potential benefit in novel treatment options, but large
clinical trials are needed to confirm.

Background
Vasoplegic syndrome, a form of vasodilatory shock following
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), may affect up to half of all
patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery [1–6].
The pathophysiology of vasoplegic syndrome is similar to
that of sepsis. A large number of patients require vasopressors post-operatively to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.
The need for escalating vasopressors is associated with a
higher incidence of morbidity and mortality. Research describing the use of agents in refractory vasoplegic syndrome
is limited primarily to case series and case reports. The
present review discusses the pathophysiology of vasoplegic
syndrome and evaluates the various treatment options with
insight from personal experience with novel noncatecholamine therapies.
Vasoplegia is characterized by a normal or augmented
cardiac output with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
causing organ hypoperfusion. The exact definition has varied but typically is considered when shock occurs within
24 h of CPB in the setting of a cardiac index (CI) is greater
than 2.2 L/kg/m2 and SVR less than 800 dyne s/cm5
. These
criteria are relatively non-specific and found in other disease
states such as sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and hepatic failure, among others, with the distinction being the etiology of
the shock (infection in the case of sepsis and exposure to
extracorporeal circulation in the case of vasoplegia) [7].
Treatment of this syndrome is usually limited to the initiation of vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion pressures via the targeting of a specific mean arterial pressure
(MAP). Due to the similarity in between vasoplegic syndrome and sepsis, along with paucity in supporting evidence,
many of the treatment options used in septic shock have
been extrapolated to use in vasoplegic syndrome.
Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiovascular surgery accounts for less than 5% of all circulatory shock [8]. Despite
this, between 5 and 50% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery may experience vasoplegic syndrome with high morbidity and mortality rates in those patients [9, 10].
Incidence is higher in patients with preoperative risk factors
including preoperative use of antihypertensive medications,

a large number of comorbidities, warmer core temperatures
while on bypass, and a longer duration on bypass [10].
Pathophysiology
The mechanism by which CPB leads to vasoplegia is
multifactorial and depends on several patient characteristics as well as the nature of the surgical procedure. A
simplified schematic of the pathophysiology of vasoplegia is presented as Fig. 1. In healthy humans, contraction
of vascular smooth muscle occurs as a response to rising
levels of intracellular calcium. Increased levels of intracellular calcium cause a cascade of events starting with
myosin phosphorylation leading to myosin-actin filament crosslinking and vasoconstriction. The influx of
cytoplasmic calcium is generated by agonism of Gprotein coupled receptors via catecholamines (alpha-1
adrenergic receptor), arginine vasopressin (vasopressin-1
receptor), and angiotensin II (angiotensin type-1 receptor) [11]. This mechanism is dysregulated during CPB,
as the exposure of blood to foreign surfaces inside of the
CPB circuit stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). These cytokines
stimulate the locus coeruleus and the hypothalamic
pituitary-adrenal axis in the paraventricular nucleus
which over time leads to adrenoreceptor desensitization
and a proinflammatory state [11]. These inflammatory
mediators can also potentiate the production of nitric
oxide (NO), which is vasodilatory, and in excess, can result in vasoplegic shock. Consequently, norepinephrine
is released from sympathetic nerves located in lymphoid
organs, epinephrine and cortisol are released from the
adrenal cortex, arginine vasopressin (AVP) is released
from the hypothalamic axis, and angiotensin II is upregulated as part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis
[12]. As shock persists, there is subsequent depletion of
these hormones. This has been elucidated with AVP specifically [13–15]. Landry et al. found that endogenous
Fig. 1 Pathophysiology of vasoplegia. Physiologic contraction of vascular smooth muscle occurs in response to intracellular calcium, which cause
myosin phosphorylation leading to myosin-actin filament crosslinking and vasoconstriction. Cytoplasmic calcium is increased through alpha-1
adrenergic receptor, vasopressin-1 receptor, and angiotensin type-1 receptor activation. Inflammatory mediators released during cardiopulmonary
bypass can lead to adrenoreceptor desensitization, an immediate increase in vasoconstrictive mediators with subsequent depletion, and the
production of nitric oxide (NO). NO leads to an increase in cGMP, which inhibits calcium into cells, leading to muscle relaxation. NO also activates
ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP), leading to hyperpolarization and inhibited vasoconstriction

vasopressin acutely increases in a hypotensive state
followed by decreasing concentrations leading to relative
AVP deficiency [13]. AVP is of particular importance in
vasoplegic syndrome, due to its ability to neutralize the
effects of NO and decrease NO production [6].
NO is produced from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. NOS enzymes are differentiated
based on location and levels of activity. Constitutive
endothelial NOS (eNOS) provides a baseline constant
production of NO in endothelial cells which can rapidly
diffuse into vascular smooth muscle cells and exert its
effects. Inducible NOS (iNOS) is stimulated via inflammatory cytokines and can lead to significantly higher
levels of NO compared to eNOS, up to 1000-fold [11,
16]. NO increases vasodilation via multiple methods. It
activates guanalyl cyclase, an enzyme found in the vascular smooth muscle that catalyzes the dephosphorylation
of guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), by binding to the heme moiety of the
enzyme. cGMP inhibits calcium entry via voltage-gated
channels and activates cGMP-dependent protein kinases
leading to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains,
leading to muscle relaxation [7]. NO also activates ATPsensitive potassium channels (KATP), which creates a
hyperpolarized state [15]. In a hyperpolarized state, the
secondary intracellular cascade leading to vasoconstriction is inhibited despite activation of G-protein coupled
receptors.
CPB-induced inflammatory mediators stimulate iNOS
and cause increased release of NO, leading to profound
vasodilation [17–19]. This inflammatory response is
similar to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(SIRS) that occurs most notably in sepsis and is further
compounded by the innate inflammatory response to
surgical trauma, yielding increased inflammation and
subsequent loss of vascular tone [18]. As CPB continues,
a secondary immune response occurs as a result of the
reinfusion of blood from the thoracic cavity through
the CPB circuit [5]. A combination of hemolyzed red
blood cells, platelets, and recirculated denatured proteins stimulates a secondary immune response. When
non-pulsatile CPB is discontinued and pulsatile tissue
reperfusion re-occurs, a microvascular ischemiareperfusion injury leads to further NO production
and vasodilation [5, 6].
In severe cases of vasoplegia, norepinephrine responsiveness may be blunted by a number of mechanisms. Adrenergic receptors become phosphorylated
inhibiting binding of catecholamines, and increased
production of NO interferes with adrenergic receptor
activation [11]. These factors in combination with
AVP deficiency, acidosis, and cell membrane hyperpolarization secondary to KATP channel stimulation all
contribute to the vasoplegic state.
Patient- and treatment-specific factors also contribute
to the development of vasoplegia following CPB. Argenziano et al. examined 145 patients undergoing CPB and
found that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <
35% was independently associated with the development
of post-CPB vasodilatory shock [20]. This correlation
may be due in part to a sustained inflammatory state
caused by chronic tissue hypoperfusion and ischemia
that is common in patients with heart failure with reduced LVEF. The authors also found the use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prior to
CPB to be an independent predictor of post-CPB vasodilatory shock [20]. ACE inhibitors are commonly used
medications in this patient population, and other common medications include beta blockers and calcium
channel blockers, which may also be associated with increased risk of vasoplegia [4, 20–22]. The use of vasodilatory inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone,
common both before and after cardiac surgery, may contribute to vasoplegic shock [23]. In addition, patients receiving vasopressors prior to cardiac surgery are also at
increased risk [4].
CPB circulatory strategies may contribute to the vasoplegic state. Recirculated blood intraoperatively is associated with increased inflammatory mediators [24].
Cytokine release can occur as a result of hemolysis and
the release of free hemoglobin and can be minimized
using blood purification techniques [25]. Blood washing
can be accomplished using a number of mechanisms, including hemodialysis, adsorption, absorption, and antibody-mediated removal and have been previously described [26, 27]. Some of these technologies (e.g., CytoSorb®, CytoSorbents Corporation, New Jersey, USA) are
not universally available. Circuit characteristics may also
mitigate or exacerbate vasoplegia, and strategies such as
smaller circuit size or biocompatible circuit coatings
have been postulated as ways to reduce inflammation.
Reduced circuit exposure using minimal extracorporeal
circulation (MECC) was compared to conventional
extracorporeal circulation in a meta-analysis of 24 studies and found to be associated with improved short-term
outcomes [28]. However, a 2014 systematic review found
that only 3 of 8 studies evaluating MECC cited a clinical
benefit [29]. Coated circuits mimic the body’s innate
endothelial surface via different types of biocompatible
molecules (e.g., heparin, poly2-methoxyethylacrylate)
and are hypothesized to reduce cytokine activation
resulting from blood cell contact with the circuit surface.
There is some evidence that supports the use of biocompatible circuitry. A systematic review by Ranucci et al.
concluded that coated circuits were associated with a
lower rate of transfusion, atrial fibrillation, and a shorter
ICU length of stay [30]. A more recent review noted inflammatory suppression in 12 studies, with six reporting
Busse et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:36 Page 3 of 11

a clinical benefit [29]. Despite this, in clinical practice
most bypass circuits are not heparin bonded.
Treatment
Non-mechanical (i.e., blood purification or CPB circuit)
treatment options for vasoplegic syndrome include elements of the sympathetic nervous system (catecholamines), the arginine-vasopressin system (vasopressin),
and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin II), as well as moderators of NO and/or inflammation (methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, vitamin C,
thiamine and corticosteroids). A comprehensive list of
all of these agents is presented as Table 1.
Catecholamines
Catecholamines (specifically norepinephrine) have long
been considered first-line therapy in shock. Data supporting the use of these agents is primarily focused on
the septic shock population, with limited evaluation in
the vasoplegic population. Norepinephrine and epinephrine agonize the alpha-1 receptor located on vascular
smooth muscle resulting in an influx of calcium and
subsequently vascular contraction. Compared to norepinephrine, epinephrine has a more potent agonistic effect on the beta-1 receptor which may increase inotropy
but may also increase the risk of tachycardia, which is
not desirable in patients following cardiac surgery. With
regard to the optimal catecholamine agent for the vasoplegia population, norepinephrine may be most tolerated. Norepinephrine has been shown to be less
arrhythmogenic than dopamine [31]. Epinephrine,
conversely, may worsen heart rate, myocardial oxygen
consumption, and the likelihood of arrhythmia, and
phenylephrine may worsen systolodiastolic function and
ventriculoarterial coupling [32]. A 2006 systematic review that compared multiple agents for treatment of
vasoplegia including norepinephrine, dopamine, and
phenylephrine concluded that no particular vasopressor
was superior to any other, but did recommend that a
second agent with a different mechanism of action
should be used if blood pressure goals could not be
achieved [33]. The use of norepinephrine specifically for
vasoplegia was evaluated as part of the Vasoplegic Shock
after Cardiac Surgery (VANCS) trial, which compared
norepinephrine to vasopressin as first-line therapy in patients recovering from cardiac surgery [34]. In this trial,
the primary endpoint of a composite of mortality or severe complications (stroke, requirement for mechanical
ventilation for longer than 48 h, deep sternal wound infection, reoperation, or acute renal failure) within 30
days was more likely in the norepinephrine group 49%
vs. 32%, unadjusted hazard ratio 0.55; 95% CI 0.38 to
0.80; p = 0.0014). However, norepinephrine did not differ
from vasopressin with respect to mortality, and the differences in this endpoint were driven by more
arrhythmia and acute kidney injury specifically. Be this
as it may, higher doses of any catecholamine may be associated with immunosuppression, an increase in myocardial oxygen demand, interference with cellular energy
metabolism, oxidative stress, arrhythmias, and risk of necrosis secondary to severe peripheral vasoconstriction
[35]. All of these factors have led cardiac surgeons to

attempt to minimize catecholamines in lieu of noncatecholamine options.
Vasopressin
Vasopressin is a synthetic form of AVP, also known as
anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), with selective activity for
the V1 receptor located on vascular smooth muscle. It
causes smooth muscle contraction via a G-protein
coupled receptor agonism, which stimulates a
phosphatidylinositol-calcium signaling pathway and
water reabsorption via aquaporin-2 water channels
through an increase in cyclic AMP [36]. Vasopressin
may also modulate the production of NO as well as potentiate the adrenergic response to stress [5]. ADH is
synthesized in the pituitary gland and released in response to hypotension or increased osmolarity [37].
Vasopressin may be particularly attractive in vasoplegia
due to the depletion that occurs during CPB. Argenziano
et al. evaluated 145 post-CPB patients and found a significantly lower AVP level in those patients with vasoplegia (12.0 ± 6.6 vs. 29.3 ± 15.0, P = .004) [20]. Reasons
for reduction in AVP during CPB are multifactorial, but
may include the neurohumoral effects of elevated cardiac filling pressures pre-operatively, elevations in atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP), or autonomic dysregulation
[20, 38, 39].
Like catecholamines, vasopressin has been evaluated
primarily in patients with septic shock and has not
shown a benefit in mortality [40, 41]. However, a recent
meta-analysis found a significantly lower incidence of
adverse events such as atrial fibrillation and need for
renal replacement therapy [42]. As part of the aforementioned VANCS trial, Hajjar et al. evaluated vasopressin
versus norepinephrine as first-line therapy in the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome post-cardiothoracic surgery. The composite outcome of mortality or severe
complications was significantly lower in the vasopressin
group, which was driven by a lower incidence of atrial
fibrillation and acute renal failure [34]. The incidence of
atrial fibrillation in the catecholamine group was greater
than 80%, higher than a recently reported randomized
trial comparing percutaneous coronary intervention to
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) [43]. This may
be due to higher catecholamine maximum ranges compared to typical practice patterns. Prior to VANCS,
smaller trials have demonstrated an improvement in
MAP and a decrease in catecholamine vasopressor requirements without an increase in adverse effects [20,
44]. Argenziano et al. showed that vasopressin administered to 40 post-CPB patients with vasoplegia increased
MAP and reduced the requirement for catecholamine
pressor agents in all patients [20]. Likewise, Morales
et al. showed that in patients receiving ACE inhibitors
preoperatively, vasopressin reduced the need for
catecholamines after CPB as well as duration of vasopressor therapy [44].
Lower doses (0.04 units/min) of vasopressin may act to
replete deficient stores of AVP in the post-operative
period, but escalating doses of vasopressin are used frequently. Higher doses have questionable benefit and
carry an increased risk of ischemia [45]. Despite this,
doses higher than 0.06 units/min are often used in place
of escalating catecholamines and may reflect the emerging belief in the benefit of de-catecholaminization.
Ascorbic acid, thiamine, and corticosteroids
A combination of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), thiamine,
and corticosteroids may mitigate vasoplegia via a number of mechanisms. Ascorbic acid is a cofactor for production of endogenous catecholamines, but is not
synthesized by humans [46]. Its antioxidative properties
may counteract excessive production of reactive oxygen
species, which are known to cause decreased vascular
tone and endothelial injury [47, 48]. .In animal models,
intravenous ascorbic acid was shown to improve arteriolar responsiveness to vasoconstrictors and decrease
microvascular permeability [49, 50]. However, when
given at high doses, ascorbic acid may result in hyperoxaluria. Thiamine has been shown to decrease the conversion of ascorbic acid to oxalate preventing hyperoxaluria
and also improves clearance of lactate by acting as a cofactor for metabolism of lactate by lactate dehydrogenase
[51]. Glucocorticoids inhibit the arachidonic acid pathway, nuclear translocation of NF-kB transcription factor,
synthesis of iNOS and COX2, and increase genetic expression of adrenergic receptors which have previously
been downregulated [52–54]. They may also work synergistically with ascorbic acid to increase catecholamine
synthesis, improve endothelial function, and increase
vasopressor sensitivity [55–57].
This three-drug regimen was recently evaluated in a
retrospective study of patients with sepsis or septic
shock [58]. Marik et al. demonstrated a significant improvement in mortality as well as a rapid and significant
reduction in vasopressor requirements in a retrospective
cohort of patients receiving 6 g of ascorbic acid, 200 mg
hydrocortisone, and 400 mg thiamine daily in divided
doses. Large-scale evaluations of ascorbic acid, thiamine,
and corticosteroids are currently ongoing. Evidence supporting the use of ascorbic acid in the setting of CPB is
scant. A recent pilot trial evaluating intravenous vitamin
C after cardiac surgery showed no statistically improved
time to resolution of vasoplegia, norepinephrine dose, or
ICU stay [59]. Extracorporeal circulation is known to reduce levels of ascorbic acid [60]. In a case series of three
cardiac surgery patients, Wieruszewski et al. noted a reduction in vasopressor requirements in all three patients
Busse et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:36 Page 5 of 11

after the administration of ascorbic acid [51]. Two of the
three patients did not require vasopressor support at 24 h.
Corticosteroids alone may help to re-establish blood
pressure in vasoplegic syndrome, though studies have
primarily focused on a septic shock population [61–65].
Experimental studies have shown restoration of vascular
responsiveness to vasopressors, believed to be due to
multiple pathways both genetic and non-genetic [11].
However, at this time, few clinical trials have evaluated
the use of corticosteroids specifically for treatment of
vasoplegic syndrome. Smaller studies have previously
shown a decrease in inflammatory response associated
with CPB [66]. More recently, two larger clinical trials
demonstrated no benefit with the use of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone intraoperatively, but outcomes
evaluated were not specific to blood pressure response or
vasoplegic syndrome [67, 68]. The use of corticosteroids
in the setting of cardiac surgery may be associated with
delayed wound healing and poor glycemic control [6].
However, hydrocortisone 200 mg daily dose may be reasonable in patients requiring prolonged doses of vasopressors to address any concerns for adrenal insufficiency.
Methylene blue
Methylene blue (MB) is indicated for use in the acute
management of methemoglobinemia, where in low concentrations it facilitates the conversion of methemoglobin
to hemoglobin. However, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests it may have a role in the management
of vasoplegia following CPB, among other vasodilatory
shock syndromes. MB has been shown to increase vascular smooth muscle tone [69]. Lenglet et al. proposed that
the mechanism of action involves the inhibition of both
eNOS and guanylate cyclase which work in tandem with
sympathetic vasopressors to reduce vasodilation and improve hemodynamic stability [70]. However, the use of
MB may cause hemolytic anemia in patients with a
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency,
which is essential for the metabolism of the drug. Likewise, MB is a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, and
patients who are taking other serotonergic medications
may be at risk of serotonin syndrome. Other notable side
effects include interference with co-oximetry, with the potential to falsely lower apparent oxygen saturation due to
the inhibition of light transmission by the blue dye.
Importantly, Leyh et al. noted dose-dependent cardiac
arrhythmias, coronary vasoconstriction, impaired gas exchange, and decreases in cardiac output, mesenteric, and
renal blood flow in patients who receive doses of MB
greater than 2 mg/kg [9]. Despite these risks, MB has been
evaluated extensively for vasoplegic syndrome.
The dosing and administration of MB for post-CPB
vasoplegia varies widely in the available literature, with
some patients receiving the drug prior to CPB initiation,
some during CPB, and yet others postoperatively. The
preoperative administration of MB was formally evaluated by Ozal et al. in 2005 in a cohort of 100 high-risk
patients undergoing CABG who were randomized to either MB 2 mg/kg given 1 h prior to surgery, or control
[71]. SVR significantly improved, norepinephrine requirements were significantly reduced, and clinical signs
of vasoplegia were less common in the MB group versus
control. ICU/hospital length of stay was also reduced. Of
note, this trial excluded patients with LVEF < 35%, a
substantial limitation as this criterion is an independent
risk factor for post-CPB vasoplegia development.
Intraoperative MB administration has been more extensively defined in the literature. Ribeiro et al. prospectively examined intraoperative MB use in a 60-patient
cohort randomized to MB 2 mg/kg administered over 6
h or control [72]. The MB group had significantly higher
diastolic blood pressures and SVR at 3 and 6 h respectively. They also noted lower TNF-alpha and NO levels
post-CPB, suggesting reduced inflammation and vasodilation. Maslow et al. examined a 30-patient cohort taking ACE inhibitors randomized to MB 3 mg/kg given
after initiation of CPB versus placebo. A significant rise
in MAP and reduced phenylephrine use was noted in
the MB group versus placebo, and lower lactate levels
would seem to indicate a favorable effect on peripheral
tissue perfusion. No significant difference in PaO2 was
noted, indicating that MB did not impair gas exchange
in the patients examined [73]. Most recently, Mehaffey
et al. retrospectively examined 118 patients who received
MB for vasoplegia in the setting of CPB and noted that
mortality rates overall are high in patients who receive
MB, but that early administration of the drug (given intraoperatively) demonstrated favorable outcomes in reduced mortality and incidence of renal failure when
compared with late administration (post-operatively)
[74]. Finally, Habib et al. evaluated MB use retrospectively in 28 patients matched to historical controls and
found an improvement in mortality and time to discontinuation of all vasopressors in the MB group [75]. Importantly, no dose-finding studies have ever evaluated
different doses of MB in patients with vasoplegia. The
commonly utilized dose for shock of 2 mg/kg is extrapolated from methemoglobinemia treatment (one intravenous infusion of 1–2 mg/kg).
Hydroxocobalamin
Hydroxocobalamin is indicated in the treatment of cyanide toxicity and is noted to have a side effect of increased
blood pressure (CYANOKIT package insert (single 5-g
vial), Columbia, MD: Meridian Medical Technologies,
Inc.; 2017). The mechanism of hydroxocobalamininduced blood pressure response remains unknown, but
is believed to be related to the NO pathway [76].
Busse et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:36 Page 6 of 11

Hydroxocobalamin is a potent direct inhibitor of NO as
well as NO synthase [77, 78]. Additionally, hydroxocobalamin modifies innate hydrogen sulfide, an endothelialbound endogenous vasodilator, increasing elimination
[79]. Like MB, patients receiving hydroxocobalamin are
at risk for certain side effects, including chromaturia,
nausea, erythema, nephrolithiasis, lymphocytopenia, and
infusion site reactions (CYANOKIT package insert
(single 5-g vial), Columbia, MD: Meridian Medical
Technologies, Inc.; 2017). Chromaturia may last several
weeks and has the potential to interfere with
hemodialysis machines, causing false blood leak alarms
[79]. Importantly, hydroxocobalamin may also be associated with acute renal failure by virtue of increased risk
of oxalate nephropathy [80].
Recently, case reports and series have demonstrated an
increase in MAP in patients with vasoplegic syndrome
when hydroxocobalamin is administered at a dose of 5 g
over 15 min [81–85]. The largest cohort of patients published found a variety of responses when used in refractory cases [76]. Of those 33 patients, nine patients had
no response, and the rest either had an adequate initial
response, prolonged response, or had rebound
hypotension within 2 h. Hydroxocobalamin was also
evaluated in a case report of two patients with vasoplegic
syndrome, in which a positive fluid balance was reversed
after administration [86]. Barker et al. compared the effects of hydroxocobalamin to MB in 58 patients, 29 in
each group, and found similar response in MAP, vasopressor requirements at 1 h, time to discontinuation of
vasopressors, and length of stay, and a higher incidence
of renal replacement therapy in patients receiving hydroxocobalamin compared to MB alone (PENDING PUBLICATION). However, a large number of these patients
also received MB prior to hydroxocobalamin and were
sicker in general. Similarly to MB, no dose-finding studies of hydroxocobalamin in the vasoplegia population
have been completed. Dosing is extrapolated from the
treatment of cyanide poisoning (5 g administered by IV
infusion over 15 min × 1–2 doses).
Importantly, the data on inhibition of NO synthase, the
proposed mechanism of action in both MB as well as
hydroxocobalamin, is equivocal. The direct inhibitor of
NO synthase G-methyl-L-arginine hydrochloride was
shown to resolve shock in patients with severe sepsis [87].
Conversely, Lopez et al. showed that iNOS inhibition was
associated with increased mortality in patients with septic
shock [88]. Accordingly, NO synthase inhibition as a
therapeutic goal should be pursued with caution.
Angiotensin II
Angiotensin II is an endogenous peptide produced by
the liver as angiotensinogen, and subsequently cleaved
by renin in the kidney to angiotensin I and by lung
endothelial-bound ACE to angiotensin II. The numerous
effects of angiotensin II include direct arterial vasoconstriction by engagement of the AT-1 receptor on vascular smooth muscle, stimulation of aldosterone release,
increased ADH secretion, and increase in sympathetic
activity [89]. Potentiation of aldosterone and ADH result
in sodium and water retention which increases intravascular volume and enhance blood pressure. Counterregulatory effects are mediated by engagement of angiotensin II on the AT-2 receptor, which causes vasodilation as well as inotropy, in addition to the metabolism of
angiotensin I to angiotensin 1–7, which is itself vasodilatory [90]. Angiotensin II in the setting of post-CPB
vasoplegia is particularly attractive, as extra-corporeal
circulation would be expected to bypass pulmonary circulation and thereby limit exposure of angiotensin I to
ACE. A phase 3 clinical trial demonstrated a decrease in
need for catecholamine vasopressors and improvement
in MAP in septic patients receiving angiotensin II [91].
A small number of these patients (n = 19) diagnosed
with vasoplegic syndrome post-cardiothoracic surgery
were included in the trial. Of those patients, ten received
angiotensin II with an adequate response in nine of the
ten. Evans et al. described the first case of the use of synthetic human angiotensin II for vasoplegia following
CPB, and a subsequent recent case report described successful down-titration of catecholamines with the use of
angiotensin II in four patients with vasoplegia following
CPB [92, 93].
Approach to treatment
Currently, there are no data supporting one noncatecholamine therapy over the others. A balanced approach in the management of vasoplegic syndrome may
be optimal, allowing for lower doses of both catecholamine and non-catecholamine therapies so as to avoid
the dangers of toxicity [94–96]. Current Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) guidelines refrain from addressing
the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome, though there is a
consensus statement recommending judicious use of
epinephrine in post-surgical arrest [97]. Of relevance,
the authors of this consensus statement argue against
excessive epinephrine so as to avoid hypertension, a concept not totally unrelated to the idea of catecholamine
sparing. Based on the best available evidence, vasopressin may be considered as a first-line non-catecholamine
agent in combination with catecholamines. While evidence is equivocal regarding the blood pressure effect of
vitamin C, thiamine, and steroids, these agents should
be considered when two or more vasopressors are required to maintain adequate perfusion pressures, considering the potential benefit and low risk associated with
these therapies. The initiation of additional therapies is
appropriate when perfusion goals cannot be met with
Busse et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:36 Page 7 of 11

norepinephrine and vasopressin alone. Attempts have
been made to protocolize the approach to treatment of
vasoplegia [98]. Such algorithms highlight an emerging
consensus regarding the dangers of excessive catecholamine use and feature lower doses of catecholamines as
well as various non-catecholamine vasopressors.
Whether this would lead to improved outcomes is to be
determined. Because of the number of options available,
protocols can become complicated, especially when
including dose and titration recommendations, which
anecdotally has been problematic vis-a-vis multiple
titratable options. Importantly, no standard of care exists
regarding the norepinephrine doses at which initiation
of non-catecholamine therapy should begin. In a protocol
by Ortoleva et al., non-catecholamine therapy is
recommended to begin at norepinephrine doses of
0.5 μg/kg/min, which has been associated, at least in
the distributive shock population, with an unacceptable level of mortality [95, 98].
The authors’ approach to vasoplegia is presented as
Fig. 2. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at
lower doses of catecholamines (0.1 mcg/kg/min), with
the first-line non-catecholamine agent being vasopressin,
followed by methylene blue. Thereafter, hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be used once catecholamine doses reach 0.2 μg/kg/min. Care should be taken
to identify potential risk factors for intolerance or adverse reaction, and avoidance or discontinuation of the
offending agent should be made accordingly.
Additionally, the response to each agent should be
evaluated, with discontinuation of any agent which yields
an ineffective response (such as lack of an increase in
MAP or a concomitant up-titration of other agents). Finally, attention should be paid to titration of adjustable
Fig. 2 An approach to the treatment of vasoplegia. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at low doses, followed by non-catecholamine
agents, including vasopressin and methylene blue. Use of hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be considered with increasing doses of
catecholamines. Clinical judgment should guide avoidance of certain agents if there is undue risk of side effects. All agents can be associated
with intolerance, and discontinuation of offending agent(s) should be made accordingly

Conclusion
Vasoplegic syndrome may occur in up to half of all patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, with predisposing patient-specific risk factors combined with
inflammatory response to CPB as precipitating causes.
NO is believed to play a large role in refractory vasodilation and thus is a potential target for therapies. While
catecholamines are considered first-line therapy in vasoplegic syndrome, non-catecholamine agents may be considered early or in place of catecholamines by virtue of
their improved safety profile with regard to cardiac toxicity. Moreover, these agents may be associated with improved outcomes such as reduced kidney injury. Data is
largely circumstantial and hypothesis-generating, but
there is emerging consensus that catecholamine sparing
may lead to improved clinical outcomes after CPB. In
general, the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome should be
rational and balanced, with the judicious use of catecholamine and non-catecholamine agents alike. Further efforts are required to validate the various protocols,
including the one presented here, for effectiveness in
patient-centered outcomes.
