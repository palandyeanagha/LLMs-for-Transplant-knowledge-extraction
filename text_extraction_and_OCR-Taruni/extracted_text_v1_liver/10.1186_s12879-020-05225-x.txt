Abstract
Background: In this study, we aimed to describe the prevalence, clinical presentation and risk factors of
paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) cases in China.
Methods: We performed a descriptive analysis of demographic and clinical data of HIV/TB coinfected patients
receiving ART at Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 2014 and October 2018.
Results: Of 199 patients included, 45 (22.6%) developed paradoxical TB-IRIS, and 19 (9.5%) TB-IRIS cases presented
miliary TB. The pre-ART CD4 count lower than 50 cells/mm3 was found to be significantly associated with
development of TB-IRIS. Similarly, patients with higher than 4-fold increase in CD4 cell count after antiretroviral
therapy (ART) had significantly higher odds of having TB-IRIS. When patients aged 25–44 years were utilized as the
control group, youths (< 25 years old) were more likely to have miliary TB. No significant difference was observed in
the intervals from initiation of ART to IRIS presentation between miliary and non-miliary group.
Conclusions: In conclusion, our data demonstrate that approximate one quarter of patients coinfected with TB and
HIV develop paradoxical TB-IRIS after initial of ART therapy in China. Lower baseline CD4 count and rapid increase in
CD4 count are the major risk factors associated with the occurrence of paradoxical TB-IRIS.

Background
Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common opportunistic
pathogen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
patients [1, 2] As the leading causes of death among people
with HIV, an estimated 0.3 million HIV-infected cases died
from TB in 2017 [2]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is an
essential intervention to improve survival in patients with
advanced HIV/TB [3] However, this strategy also increase
risk for worsening tuberculosis symptoms or development
of new tuberculosis symptoms despite virological efficacy.
This clinical condition is known as TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS)
[3]. It often emerges shortly after ART initiation, and is
characterized by a transient but sometimes severe local
and systemic inflammatory response [1], majorly reflecting
an exaggerated immune response to Mycobacterium

tuberculosis antigens during the reconstitution of compromised immune system [4, 5].
IRIS is characterized by a transient but sometimes severe
local and systemic inflammatory response directed against
a known condition (e.g., opportunistic pathogens or autoimmune diseases) in HIV-1 infected patients shortly after
ART initiation. In HIV-infected patients, rates of TB-IRIS
range between 8 and 54%, and the occurrence of this severe
form of TB is associated with dramatically increased
mortality. With the proposed widespread use of early ART
in HIV/TB coinfected patients, the incidence of TB-IRIS
will likely rise [6].
Although the underlying immunological mechanisms
of TB-RIIS are incompletely understood, a few clinical
studies have demonstrated that risk factors for the development of TB-IRIS include low pre-ART CD4+ T cell
counts, stronger CD4+ T cell increase after ART and
short interval between starting antituberculous therapy
and ART [7, 8], while the other studies did not find the
relationship between these risk factors and developing
IRIS [9]. These contradictory results indicate that the
small sample size of previous studies may negatively
affect the generalization of these conclusions among different populations.
China is currently undergoing a serious TB epidemic,
with an estimated 0.89 million of incidence cases in
2017 [2]. In 2018, there were an estimated 18,000 TB
patients and 2400 TB deaths among HIV-positive people
in this country [2]. An alarming public health threat has
emerged with the concomitant epidemics of HIV and
TB in past decades, especially in sex workers, intravenous drug users, and former plasma donors, thereby
directly leading to an increasing incidence of TB-IRIS.
To date, no specific diagnostic test is available to
confirm IRIS diagnosis. Thus, evaluating the risk factors
associated with developing IRIS could be an alternative
to identify patients at risk for developing TB-IRIS.
Unfortunately, little is known about incidence and
clinical risk factors of TB-IRIS among patients initiating
ART in China. To address this concern, we aimed to
describe the prevalence, clinical presentation and risk
factors of paradoxical TB-IRIS cases in China. A secondary objective was to determine factors associated with an
increased risk of miliary TB among paradoxical TB-IRIS
cases.
Methods
Patients
We performed a retrospective analysis of demographic
and clinical data of HIV/TB coinfected patients receiving
ART at Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 2014
and October 2018. Beijing Ditan Hospital, designated a
National Quality Control Centre on Infectious Diseases,
is a 1158-bed general hospital that delivers specialized
treatment for patients infected with HIV, hepatitis virus
and other infectious diseases, except for TB, whereas the
patients coinfected with HIV and TB were referred to this
hospital for treatment of TB and HIV meanwhile. This
hospital provides a tertiary care service for HIV-infected
patients from Beijing Municipality and surrounding
regions. Patients were clinically assessed, and had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, routine blood counts,
biochemical tests, urinalysis, CD4 count, HIV RNA load
and tuberculosis-specific interferon-gamma release assay
(IGRA) at initial visit. After the primary treatment,
radiological examination and routine laboratory tests were
performed at completion of 2, 4, 8, 16 weeks, and then
every 3 months of treatment, or after onset of progressively clinical TB symptoms for patients coinfected with
HIV/TB. The study inclusion criteria were: i. adult aged
≥18 years; ii. confirmed HIV infection; iii. Patients receiving ART; iv. patients with positive tuberculosis-specific
IGRA test irrespective of clinical presentation of TB
disease. Exclusion criteria were: i. pregnant patients; ii.
those on immunomodulatory agents; iii. Patients infected
with RIF-resistant tuberculosis.
Case definitions
Bacteriogically confirmed TB cases were defined as disease
proven by isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and/or
positive histopathological evidence. Clinically diagnosed TB
cases were defined as those with a suggestive chest radiograph, having clinical symptoms together with an appropriate response to anti-TB treatment. Paradoxical TB-IRIS
was defined as worsening clinical tuberculosis symptoms
and/or worsening radiological features of tuberculosis at
any time after ART initiation. Each suspected case of paradoxical TB-IRIS reviewed by two members of the clinical
coordination team. Miliary tuberculosis was defined as the
presence of military nodules on thoracic radiologic imaging
in patients who presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis such as prolonged fever, night sweats,
anorexia and weight loss.
Data collection and analysis
Demographic and clinical data were collected from
electronic patient record system, including gender, age
group, CD4 count and HIV RNA load. For patients with
TB-IRIS, CD4 count and HIV RNA load were obtained
at baseline and at the onset of TB-IRIS, respectively. For
patients without TB-IRIS, these laboratory data were
obtained at baseline and 3 months post-ART initiation,
respectively. The patients were classified into three
groups on the basis of baseline CD4 T lymphocyte cell
levels as previously described [10]. In primary univariate
logistic regression, patients with TB-IRIS were compared
to patients without TB-IRIS as controls. Multivariable
logistic regression models were built by using forward
Xue et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2020) 20:554 Page 2 of 7

stepwise logistic regression procedures with the inclusion of variables with P < 0.1 in the univariate analysis.
The difference was declared as significant if a P value
was less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
Illinois, USA).
Results
Patient enrolment
Between January 2014 and October 2018, a total of 199
patients coinfected with TB and HIV, who were given
combination antiretroviral therapy, were included in this
study (Fig. 1). 174 (87.4%, 174/199) started a combination of tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz, while the
other 25(12.6%, 25/199) were treated with a combination
of tenofovir, lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. Of these
199 patients, 45 (22.6%, 45/199) developed paradoxical
TB-IRIS. In addition, 19 (9.5%, 19/199) TB-IRIS cases
presented miliary TB.
Risk factors of TB-IRIS
In the multivariate analysis, the patients aged 45–65 years
had lower odds of developing TB-IRIS than patients aged
25–44 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.355, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.127–0.993]. Similarly, patients with
higher than 4-fold increase in CD4 cell count after ART
had significantly higher odds of having TB-IRIS (aOR:
2.614, 95% CI: 1.288–5.303) (Table 1).
Risk factors of miliary TB among TB-IRIS cases
A total of 19 patients met the criteria for miliary TB. As
shown in Fig. 2, a man was diagnosed as lymphatic
tuberculosis at the time of HIV diagnosis. No obvious
abnormal findings were recorded in the lung fields. After
28 days of ART, he had worsening lymph node enlargement and military infiltration of the lungs. We further
analysed the risk factors of miliary TB among TB-IRIS
cases. The distribution of miliary TB among TB-IRIS
cases differed among different age groups. When patients aged 25–44 years were utilized as the control
group, youths (< 25 years old) were more likely to have
miliary TB (OR: 8.167, 95% CI: 1.412–47.221). In
contrast, sex, pre-ART CD4 count and HIV virial load
had no significant influence on the prevalence of miliary
TB (P > 0.05) (Table 2).
Intervals between ART and IRIS diagnosis
The intervals from initiation of ART to IRIS presentation were compared between miliary group and nonmiliary group. The mean interval for patients in miliary
group was 43.7 ± 7.3 days, ranging from 5 to 103 days,
while that for patients in non-miliary group was 35.0 ±

Discussion
To our best knowledge, this is the first study to report
the prevalence and risk factors of paradoxical TB-IRIS in
China. Our data demonstrate that 22.6% of patients
coinfected with HIV and TB develop paradoxical TBIRIS in the Chinese population. The prevalence of paradoxical TB-IRIS is similar to that in Ethiopia (22.4%)
[11] and that in Spain (24.3%) [12], although it is lower
than that in USA (36.4%) [13] and that in Croatia
(40.7%) [14], and higher than that in India (7.6%) [15]
and that in South Africa (11.2%) [16]. A recent metaanalysis reveals that the pooled prevalence in Asian studies (15%) is significantly lower than that in European
studies (33%) [17], which is also lower than our result.
On one hand, the diversity in prevalence may be partly
explained by geographic region and study design [17]. In
most of studies from Europe, the less stringent criteria
were used to define TB-IRIS, thus the ascertainment bias
related to study design may be a major explanation for
the differences observed across studies [17]. On the
other hand, we hypothesize that the combination of unsatisfactory quality and limited access to health care may
be contributed to the missed diagnosis of paradoxical
TB-IRIS, thus resulting in underestimation of its incidence in Asia.
The major risk factors that are reported to increase
the risk of paradoxical TB-IRIS include low baseline
CD4 count and high baseline load [9, 18, 19] In consistent to previous studies, our report also identified an
association between the occurrence of TB-IRIS and the
pre-ART CD4 count lower than 50 cells/mm3
. In
addition, we found that a greater increase in CD4 count
presented a risk factor for the development of paradoxical TB-IRIS. Similar to our observation, a clinical trial
by Breton and colleagues reported that IRIS was associated with increases in the CD4 cell percentage after 1

month of antiretroviral therapy [20]. The change in CD4
count during early ART reflects rapid immunological
recovery among HIV-infected cases [17]. Although an
effective CD4 T cell response is essential to limit tubercle bacilli throughout the body, it can also accelerate the
development of progressively destructive lesions in the
lesions [21]. The rapid increase in CD4 cell count provides better protection against opportunistic infections
in the HIV-infected persons. However, the activation of
CD4 cell response may represent a two-edged sword,
with a damage on the host mediated by an excessive or
inappropriate immune response [22]. Thus, our results
highlight the crucial importance of balance between
protection and immunopathology during the early ART
therapy. The moderate reconstruction of the immune
system will decrease the risk of paradoxical TB-IRIS via
monitoring CD4 T cells.
Miliary TB is a potentially lethal form of tuberculosis
resulting from haematogenous dissemination of M.
tuberculosis, accounting for 1–2% of patients with tuberculosis [23]. In this study, more than 40% of paradoxical
TB-IRIS cases developed miliary TB after initial ART
therapy. The extremely high incidence of miliary TB
supports the previous reports that the risk of developing
military TB is the greatest in patients with altered host
immunity, including HIV-infected patients and individuals with immunosuppressive and immunomodulator
drugs [24]. In addition, we also found that patients
younger than 25 years of age were most likely to have
miliary TB among paradoxical TB-IRIS cases. In consistent
to our observation, Rieder et al. found that patients younger
than 15 or older than 65 years of age had significantly
higher odds of having miliary TB [25]. The difference
remains largely unexplained, but it suggests that there may
be underlying immunological mechanism that contribute
the high incidence of miliary TB in this population.
This study is subject to some limitations. First, this
research only collected data from Beijing Ditan Hospital
rather than from multiple sites nationwide, which may
limit the relevant scope of our study. Second, as a retrospective study, the prevalence of paradoxical TB-IRIS
may be underestimated, as noted in a previous metaanalysis [17] Third, the immunocompromised conditions
and comorbid diabetes and specially increase the risk for
severe form of TB [26, 27]. However, considering that
the HIV epidemic in China is attributed to men who
have sex with men among young adults [28], the low
incidence of comorbidities in the special population hinders the interpretation of correlation between TB-IRIS
and underlying diseases. Finally, the patients enrolled in
this study did not complete the follow-up interview.
Thus we could not assess mortality associated with paradoxical TB-IRIS. Despite these limitations, our results
firstly provide a snapshot of paradoxical TB-IRIS in
Chinese population.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study describes the prevalence and
risk factors of paradoxical TB-IRIS in China. Our data
demonstrate that approximate one quarter of patients

coinfected with TB and HIV develop paradoxical TBIRIS after initial of ART therapy. Lower baseline CD4
count and rapid increase in CD4 count are the major
risk factors associated with the occurrence of paradoxical TB-IRIS. In addition, patients younger than 25 years
of age are most likely to have miliary TB among paradoxical TB-IRIS cases. Further studies are urgently
needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying pathophysiology of paradoxical TB-IRIS.
