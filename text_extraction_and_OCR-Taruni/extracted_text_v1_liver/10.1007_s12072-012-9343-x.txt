Abstract
Purpose To investigate the durability of response to peginterferon alfa-2a up to 5 years post-treatment and factors
associated with response in hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-
negative patients.
Methods HBeAg-negative patients received peginterferon
alfa-2a (180 lg/week) ± lamivudine (100 mg/day) for
48 weeks as part of a multicenter, randomized study. The
planned 5-year efficacy analysis included patients (n =
230) enrolled in the long-term follow-up study. On-treatment
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) decline kinetics were
analyzed retrospectively in a subgroup of patients with
HBsAg data available at baseline, weeks 12, 24, and 48 ontreatment, and 6 months post-treatment (n = 120). Receiver
operating characteristic analyses identified the on-treatment
HBsAg levels associated with response at 1 and 5 years posttreatment.
Results HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL and HBsAg clearance
at 5 years post-treatment were achieved by 23 and 12% of
patients, respectively. High rates of HBsAg clearance at
5 years post-treatment were achieved by patients with
HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment (28%).
Rates of HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment were 47.2 and 43.4% in patients with C10% decline
from baseline at weeks 12 and 24, respectively, compared
with 16.4% (p = 0.0003) and 13.2% (p\0.0004) in
patients with a\10% decline. Rates of HBsAg clearance at
5 years post-treatment were 22.6 and 22.4% in patients
with C10% decline at weeks 12 and 24, respectively,
compared with 7.5% (p = 0.0161) and 3.8% (p\0.0001)
in patients with \10% decline.
Conclusions Peginterferon alfa-2a results in increasing
rates of HBsAg clearance during post-treatment follow-up
in HBeAg-negative patients. On-treatment decline in
HBsAg is significantly associated with long-term posttreatment response.

development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [1].
Serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is usually used
as a qualitative marker for the diagnosis of HBV infection,
and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is defined as persistence of
HBsAg in the circulation for more than 6 months. HBsAg
clearance is considered a marker of complete and definitive
remission of HBV activity [2], because it is associated with
reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and
improved rates of survival, and is the closest outcome to
clinical cure of CHB [3–5].
Previous studies with conventional interferon alfa-2a in
patients with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-negative CHB
demonstrated that HBsAg clearance could be achieved by
this population. Approximately, one-third of patients who
sustained a biochemical response for a median period of
7 years post-treatment achieved HBsAg clearance [6].
Subsequently, a finite course of peginterferon alfa-2a has
been shown to result in HBsAg clearance, which increases
in the years following the completion of the course of
therapy. Indeed, rates of HBsAg clearance have been
shown to reach 9% at 3 years post-treatment in HBeAgnegative patients [7]. Although HBsAg clearance is the
ultimate goal in HBeAg-negative CHB [8], rates of
response in the short-term are low and, therefore, it is not
usually the primary efficacy endpoint in clinical studies.
Alternative markers of response have been identified that
are associated with subsequent increased rates of HBsAg
clearance and long-term clinical benefits. In HBeAg-negative CHB, HBV DNA suppression B2,000 IU/mL is used
to define sustained immune control with pegylated interferon in the shorter term (e.g., 1 year post-treatment) as this
level of HBV DNA is associated with inactive disease and
a low risk of hepatocellular carcinoma [2, 9, 10]. Patients
who achieve sustained immune control following interferon-based therapy are likely to clear HBsAg during longterm treatment-free follow-up [11, 12].
The pivotal study of peginterferon alfa-2a in HBeAgnegative patients showed that approximately one-third of
patients achieve sustained immune control [13]. Identification of responders either before or early during treatment
would be of great benefit as it would not only ensure timely
initiation of treatment in patients likely to respond but also
allow modification of the treatment regimen in those
patients unlikely to respond to the standard duration
(48 weeks) of peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy. Recent
analyses have shown that serologic (e.g., HBsAg) and
virologic (e.g., HBV DNA) markers either before or during
treatment with pegylated interferon may help identify those
patients most likely to respond post-treatment [14]. In a
retrospective study, it was also shown that low pretreatment HBsAg levels and their decline during treatment with
conventional interferon alfa predicted subsequent HBsAg
clearance [15].
The current analysis describes the response rate at
5 years post-treatment in HBeAg-negative patients treated
with peginterferon alfa-2a during the Phase 3 study—this
is the final planned efficacy analysis from this pivotal
trial. In addition, it investigates the potential of HBsAg
quantification during treatment to predict long-term
response.
Materials and methods
Study design
HBeAg-negative patients received peginterferon alfa-2a
(180 lg/week) ± lamivudine (100 mg/day) for 48 weeks
as part of the large, multicenter, randomized Phase
3 study [13]. Efficacy was assessed as part of the longterm follow-up study [7], and results at 5 years posttreatment are reported. Additional retrospective analyses
of data from the initial and long-term study were also
conducted.
HBsAg levels were analyzed retrospectively from
stored samples collected at baseline, during therapy at
weeks 12, 24, and 48 (end of treatment), and 6 months
post-treatment (week 72). HBsAg levels were quantified
using the Abbott Architect HBsAg assay (Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA; dynamic range 0.05–250.0 IU/mL) after
1:100 dilution. Samples with HBsAg[250.0 IU/mL at this
dilution were retested at a final dilution of 1:1,000. Samples with HBsAg levels \0.05 IU/mL at 1:100 dilution
were retested at the same dilution [16]. HBV DNA was
measured using the AMPLICOR HBV test (Roche
Molecular Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; range
71–35,715 IU/mL); samples with HBV DNA[35,715 IU/mL
were retested after 1:100 dilution according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Efficacy endpoints
The original protocol stated that post-treatment efficacy
should be determined at yearly time-points with the final
assessment taking place 5 years post-treatment. The efficacy endpoints included in the current analysis were HBV
DNA B2,000 IU/mL (&10,000 copies/mL)—a marker of
sustained immune control—and HBsAg clearance at 1 and
5 years post-treatment. Both parameters were assessed in
patients enrolled in the long-term follow-up study
(n = 230), and in patients included in the long-term follow-up study with HBsAg values available at baseline,
weeks 12, 24, and 48 of treatment and 6 months posttreatment (n = 120). The HBsAg kinetic analysis was
conducted in the subgroup of 120 patients with HBsAg
levels available at all time-points.

Association of on-treatment HBsAg and HBV DNA
levels with response post-treatment
As HBsAg decline from baseline has previously been
shown to be similar in peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2a ? lamivudine-treated patients [17], data from
both treatment groups were pooled. HBV DNA decline has
been shown to be greater in patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a ? lamivudine compared with patients
treated with peginterferon alfa-2a alone [17] and, therefore,
wherever HBV DNA decline was assessed, the two treatment arms were analyzed individually.
Only patients with HBsAg values available at baseline
and at all other time-points (weeks 12, 24, 48, and 72) were
included in this analysis. The association between HBsAg
decline during treatment and response at 1 and 5 years
post-treatment was investigated. Association between
HBsAg decline and response at 6 months post-treatment
was not investigated, due to the high rate of relapse
between 6 months and 1 year post-treatment [7].
Statistical analysis
Receiver operating characteristic analysis at weeks 12 and
24 of therapy was used to identify levels of HBsAg
decline from baseline associated with high rates of
response post-treatment. The target was to identify a cutoff value that would provide a negative predictive value
(NPV) C95%.
Logistic regression was used to analyze the chance of a
response. In general, missing samples were treated as nonresponse. The only exception was when calculating the rate
of HBsAg clearance, where last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) methodology was used in patients with HBV
DNA B71 IU/mL at the missing time-point.
All statistical tests were considered exploratory and no
adjustment for multiple testing was performed. Mantel–
Haenszel Chi-square (MHv2
) test and Wald Chi-square
(WCv2
) test were used as appropriate. The statistical
analysis software used was SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
Results
A total of 230 peginterferon alfa-2a ± lamivudine-treated
patients were included in the long-term follow-up study. Of
these, 120 (52%) had HBsAg values available at all timepoints (i.e., baseline and weeks 12, 24, and 48 of therapy
and 6 months post-treatment). Of the patients with HBsAg
values available at all time-points, the majority (78%) was
from the Asia–Pacific region. Baseline characteristics were
similar between the two populations (Table 1).
Efficacy of peginterferon alfa-2a at 1 and 5 years
post-treatment
In the long-term population (n = 230), 72 patients (31%)
had HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL at year 1 post-treatment and
11 patients (5%) had cleared HBsAg (Table 2). In the 72
patients with HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL at year 1 posttreatment, 50% (36/72) had sustained suppression of HBV
DNA B2,000 IU/mL at year 5 post-treatment. For comparison, in patients with available data at year 1 and year 5
post-treatment, 88% (36/41) sustained suppression of HBV
DNA B2,000 IU/mL. The rate of HBsAg clearance at

5 years post-treatment was significantly higher in patients
with HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment
(20/72; 28%) than in patients with HBV DNA [2,000
IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment (8/158, p\0.0001). HBsAg
clearance was achieved by 42.4% (14/33) of patients with
HBV DNA\70 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment.
In patients with HBsAg values available at all timepoints (n = 120), 36 patients (30%) had HBV DNA
B2,000 IU/mL at year 1 post-treatment and, of these, 14
(39%) achieved HBsAg clearance at 5 years post-treatment
(compared with 3.6% (3/84) of patients with HBV DNA
[2,000 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment, p\0.0001). Rate
of HBsAg clearance in patients with HBV DNA \70 IU/
mL at 1 year post-treatment was 61.5% (8/13). Rates of
response at 1 and 5 years post-treatment in both populations are shown in Table 2.
Baseline HBsAg as a predictor of response
Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a
baseline HBsAg level of 5,000 IU/mL that was associated
with post-treatment response. This provided a positive
predictive value (PPV) of 34% for HBV DNA B2,000
IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment and a PPV of 30% for HBV
DNA B2,000 IU/mL at 5 years post-treatment. The NPVs
generated were 78 and 84%, respectively.
Association between HBsAg decline and post-treatment
response
The patients were divided into three mutually exclusive
response categories: (1) patients with HBsAg clearance, (2)
patients without HBsAg clearance but with HBV DNA
B2,000 IU/mL, and (3) patients without HBsAg clearance
and with HBV DNA [2,000 IU/mL post-treatment. The
three groups were determined based on response at year 1
(Fig. 1a) and at year 5 (Fig. 1b). HBsAg decline during
treatment (48 weeks) and the initial follow-up period
(24 weeks) was significantly more pronounced in patients
with HBsAg clearance at either 1 or 5 years post-treatment
when compared with patients not achieving HBsAg clearance or HBV DNA suppression. In patients with HBV DNA
\2,000 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment, the pattern of
HBsAg decline was similar to that in patients with HBsAg
clearance at 5 years post-treatment, although the overall
decline was the greatest in patients with HBsAg clearance
at 5 years post-treatment (Fig. 1c).
HBsAg and HBV DNA decline in responders, relapsers,
and non-responders
The decline in HBsAg level in peginterferon alfa-2a ±
lamivudine-treated patients with HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL
at the end of treatment and 5 years post-treatment (virologic responders, n = 31) was compared with that in
patients with a response at end of treatment that was not
sustained until year 5 (relapsers, n = 76) and in patients
with HBV DNA[2,000 IU/mL at the end of treatment and
5 years post-treatment (non-responders; n = 13) (Fig. 2a).
HBsAg clearance was more pronounced in responders
than in relapsers and non-responders. Of the virologic
responders, 17 (55%) achieved HBsAg clearance at 5 years
post-treatment; however, none of the relapsing or nonresponding patients achieved this endpoint.
In peginterferon alfa-2a-treated patients, on-treatment
HBV DNA decline was similar in responders (n = 15) and
relapsers (n = 31). The decline was significantly higher in
responders and relapsers compared with non-responders
(Fig. 2b). There was only one non-responder in the
peginterferon alfa-2a ? lamivudine-treated group, thus,
making comparisons between groups difficult (Fig. 2c).
On-treatment HBV DNA levels did not distinguish
between responders and relapsers in either peginterferon
alfa-2a treatment group.
Association between on-treatment HBsAg level
and response at 1 and 5 years post-treatment
Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified a
C10% log10 HBsAg decline from baseline that was significantly associated with post-treatment response. The
association between on-treatment HBsAg log10 decline and
HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL at 1 or 5 years post-treatment
was investigated, using 10% log10 decline from baseline as
a cut-off at weeks 12 and 24. More patients achieved

C10% HBsAg log10 decline from baseline at week 24
(56%) than at week 12 (44%).
Patients with a C10% log10 HBsAg decline from baseline
achieved significantly higher rates of HBV DNA B2,000
IU/mL at both year 1 and year 5 post-treatment than patients
with a\10% log10 decline from baseline (Fig. 3a). Applying
the identified cut-off level at weeks 12 and 24 provided PPVs
of 47 and 43%, respectively, and NPVs of 84 and 87%,
respectively, at year 1. At year 5, PPVs were 42 and 36%,
respectively, and NPVs were 87% at both weeks 12 and 24.
Rates of HBsAg clearance were also significantly higher in
patients with a C10% log10 decline in HBsAg from baseline at
week 12 (p = 0.0484 for response at 1 year post-treatment
and p = 0.0184 for response at 5 years post-treatment) and
week 24 (p = 0.026 for response at 1 year post-treatment and
p = 0.0038 for response at 5 years post-treatment) than in
patients with a\10% log10 decline (Fig. 3b). The PPV and
NPV for HBsAg clearance at 5 years post-treatment, based on
C10% log10 decline in HBsAg from baseline at week 12, were
23 and 93%, respectively. At week 24, the PPV and NPV were
22 and 96%, respectively.
High rates of HBsAg clearance at 5 years post-treatment
were achieved by patients with a C10% decline in HBsAg
from baseline at week 12 and HBV DNA\2,000 IU/mL at
1 year post-treatment (40.0%, 10/25). Similarly, 44.8% (13/29)
of patients with a C10% decline in HBsAg from baseline at
week 24 and HBV DNA\2,000 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment achieved HBsAg clearance at 5 years post-treatment.
Discussion
The pivotal trial of peginterferon alfa-2a in HBeAg-negative CHB has provided a wealth of information about the

long-term post-treatment effects of a finite course of
treatment. A previous analysis of this study demonstrated
that rates of HBsAg clearance increased after completion
of treatment, with 9% of patients treated with peginterferon
alfa-2a ± lamivudine achieving HBsAg clearance 3 years
after treatment [7]. In the protocol-defined analysis
described, rates of HBsAg clearance were shown to further
increase during longer-term follow-up, with 12% of
patients achieving HBsAg clearance at 5 years post-treatment. HBsAg clearance is the ultimate treatment goal of
patients with HBeAg-negative CHB as it is associated with
improved outcomes [3–5]. Although HBsAg clearance has
been observed during treatment of HBeAg-positive CHB
with some of the newer nucleos(t)ide analogs [18, 19], the
rates of HBsAg clearance in HBeAg-negative patients
during nucleos(t)ide analog therapy are negligible [19]. In
contrast, the current study clearly demonstrates that rates of
HBsAg clearance after peginterferon alfa-2a therapy are
substantial and durable. Patients achieving HBV DNA
suppression at 1 year post-treatment achieved high rates of
HBsAg clearance at 5 years post-treatment. As 28% of
patients with sustained immune control (HBV DNA
B2,000 IU/mL at 1 year post-treatment) achieved HBsAg
clearance at 5 years post-treatment, this endpoint appears
to be a valuable early indicator of long-term response.
The analyses conducted in patients enrolled in this
international, multicenter, randomized trial have considerably increased the knowledge of the potential value of
peginterferon alfa-2a therapy in patients with HBeAgnegative CHB. As a result of the heterogeneous population
enrolled, this study—the largest and the most extensive of
peginterferon alfa-2a in HBeAg-negative CHB to date—
closely reflects the global clinical situation. The long-term
benefits achieved following a finite course of peginterferon
alfa-2a in such a population are clearly encouraging. Early
identification of patients who could benefit from this
treatment approach would be valuable, as it would allow
clinicians to motivate patients likely to achieve a long-term
response to complete therapy while also identifying those
patients for whom an alternative treatment regimen may be
necessary.
Recently, two groups showed that HBsAg levels vary
considerably during the natural history of CHB and reflect
the disease phase [20, 21], and previous results demonstrated that on-treatment HBsAg kinetics and HBsAg levels
at the end of treatment are associated with sustained
response to peginterferon alfa-2a [14, 17]. The observation
that lower levels of HBsAg are associated with greater
immune control has resulted in considerable interest in
HBsAg kinetics during peginterferon alfa-2a therapy.
A difference in HBsAg decline between responders and
non-responders, as occurred in this study, was described
initially by Brunetto et al. [17]. In the current analysis,
differences in HBsAg decline patterns were also observed
in patients achieving a long-term response to treatment
compared with those relapsing after experiencing an ontreatment response. This confirms data from Moucari et al.
[14] that showed the association between HBsAg decline
and short-term post-treatment response. As variations in
HBsAg kinetics between responders, non-responders, and
relapsers to peginterferon alfa-2a therapy have been
established in both short-term and long-term follow-up,
research has focused on whether clinicians can use the
knowledge of HBsAg kinetics to make disease-management decisions.
In the current study, receiver operating characteristic
analysis identified a decline in HBsAg levels at weeks 12
and 24, which was associated with high rates of posttreatment response. Patients with a C10% log10 IU/mL
decline in HBsAg from baseline achieved significantly
higher rates of HBV DNA B2,000 IU/mL and HBsAg
clearance up to 5 years post-treatment than patients not
achieving this level of decline. It is worth noting that
40–45% of patients with this level of on-treatment HBsAg
decline and sustained immune control at 1 year posttreatment achieved HBsAg clearance at 5 years posttreatment. Although PPVs for long-term sustained immune
control were slightly lower at week 24 than at week 12, the
high rates of HBsAg clearance achieved by patients with a
C10% decline during treatment and sustained immune
control 1 year post-treatment suggest that on-treatment
quantification at either time-point provides clinically
important information.
The target was to achieve NPV C95%, as this would
identify patients unlikely to achieve a sustained response
and allow physicians to consider stopping treatment.
However, as the NPVs generated by this analysis did not
reach the target level, using this as a stopping rule would
mean that 13–16% of potential responders would have their
treatment stopped prematurely. Some smaller studies have
identified on-treatment HBsAg cut-off levels that generate
higher NPVs. For example, Moucari et al. [14] showed that
an HBsAg decline of 0.5 log10 IU/mL (68% decline from
baseline) at week 12 generated an NPV of 90% and an
HBsAg decline of 1.0 log10 IU/mL (90% decline from
baseline) at week 24 gave an NPV of 97%. However, these
levels of decline did not produce similar results in the
current analysis (data not shown). The lack of consistent
findings may be explained by differences in the study
design, response parameters, and study populations
between the two studies. For example, Marcellin et al. [7]
defined post-treatment response as undetectable HBV DNA
at 6 months post-treatment, rather than the HBV DNA
\2,000 IU/mL and HBsAg clearance at 1 year and 5 years
post-treatment employed in the current analysis. Given that
relapse is known to occur between 6 months and 1 year

post-treatment [7], 1 year may be a more appropriate timepoint for assessment of sustained response. In addition, the
differences in cut-off levels identified in these two populations may be explained, at least in part, by HBV genotype, which is known to affect post-treatment response [14,
17, 22, 23]. In the current analysis, the patients were
infected predominantly with HBV genotype C (46%) and D
(22%) with very few infected with HBV genotype A
(10%); while in the Moucari et al. [14] analysis, 27% of
patients were infected with HBV genotype A. The influence of HBV genotype on HBsAg kinetics in samples from
patients who were also included in the current analysis was
described initially by Brunetto et al. [17] who showed that
patients infected with all the major genotypes achieve some
level of HBsAg decline, but this was most pronounced in
patients infected with genotypes A and B. Genotype is,
therefore, likely to be a major influencing factor on decline
of HBsAg levels in HBeAg-negative subjects. Further
analyses are needed to elucidate the influence of genotype
on HBsAg kinetics and to determine how knowledge of
infecting genotype combined with HBsAg quantification
can be used to predict response to peginterferon alfa-2a.
While most investigations have examined on-treatment
prediction of response, there is also potential value in
identifying at baseline those patients likely to respond to
peginterferon alfa-2a. In the current analysis, patients with
HBsAg B5,000 IU/mL at baseline achieved the highest
rates of response post-treatment, but the PPVs (approximately 30%) and NPVs (approximately 80%) calculated
were lower than those relating to on-treatment HBsAg
quantification. Consequently, on-treatment HBsAg quantification appears to be a more appropriate predictor than
quantification of HBsAg at baseline.
Unlike on-treatment HBsAg quantification, measurement of HBV DNA levels during treatment does not differentiate between treatment responders and relapsers [14].
This observation was based on response at 6 months posttreatment but was also seen in the current analysis, where a
significant difference in HBV DNA decline between
patients with a response at 5 years post-treatment and
relapsers could not be demonstrated. In addition, there
were differences in HBV DNA decline between peginterferon alfa-2a-treated patients and patients receiving combination therapy with lamivudine. Wherever there was a
difference in HBV DNA decline between responders/
relapsers and non-responders in monotherapy-treated
patients, this was not present in the combination therapy
group. Consequently, HBV DNA quantification may not be
as valuable for identifying long-term responders to therapy
as HBsAg quantification.
A recent analysis of another study of peginterferon alfa2a in HBeAg-negative patients investigated the potential of
combining HBsAg and HBV DNA response during
treatment to improve NPVs [24]. The NPV of 100% was
reported in patients who did not achieve an HBsAg decline
or an HBV DNA decline[2 log10 copies/mL at week 12 of
treatment. The importance of infecting genotype on HBsAg
kinetics was discussed earlier, and as most patients in this
analysis were infected with HBV genotype D, further
analysis is required to determine whether this rule can be
used in patients infected with other genotypes.
It is interesting to speculate how HBsAg quantification
could be used in clinical practice to help individualize
peginterferon alfa-2a therapy. Preliminary data from a
study of extended peginterferon alfa-2a therapy in HBeAgnegative patients have shown that extension therapy
improves sustained response rates as a result of a reduction
in relapse [25]. An important future consideration will be
whether patients likely to benefit from extended therapy
can be identified early during the initial phase of treatment.
Brunetto et al. [26] have studied in-depth HBsAg kinetics
in the HBeAg-negative patients included in the Phase 3
peginterferon alfa-2a study and showed that response rate
is linked to decline pattern. Although patients with a continuous HBsAg decline from baseline (C10% decline from
baseline to week 24 and C10% from weeks 24 to 48)
achieved the highest rates of response, patients with a late
decline (C10% decline from baseline after week 24) also
achieved high rates of response when compared with
patients with a \10% HBsAg decline during the entire
48-week treatment period. It is possible that patients with a
late HBsAg decline will benefit from an extended period of
peginterferon alfa-2a therapy; however, this needs to be
studied in prospective clinical trials, which also consider in
more detail the role of infecting genotype.
The current analysis has limitations. Only a proportion
of patients included in the initial or follow-up studies had
HBsAg levels determined during treatment and 6 months
post-treatment. In addition, only patients with HBsAg data
available at all on-treatment and post-treatment time-points
were included and, consequently, there is the potential for
selection bias. However, baseline characteristics and
response rates in the 230 patients in the long-term analysis
were similar to those achieved by the 120 patients in the
current analysis, and the statistical methods used were conservative as missing samples were taken as non-responders.
Wherever LOCF methodology was used, a secondary
parameter was included (HBV DNA\71 IU/mL) to reduce
the chance of false-positive data.
In conclusion, a finite course of peginterferon alfa-2a
resulted in increasing rates of HBsAg clearance up to
5 years post-treatment in HBeAg-negative patients. Sustained immune control at 1 year post-treatment was an
early indicator of subsequent HBsAg clearance. Analysis
of data from this large, long-term study has shown that
HBsAg quantification may be an appropriate on-treatment

tool for monitoring response to peginterferon alfa-2a in
HBeAg-negative patients, thereby confirming observations
in small-scale studies. Further prospective studies are
required before clear clinical guidance on use of HBsAg
monitoring can be provided for physicians. In the future,
increased understanding of the kinetics of HBsAg decline
in HBeAg-negative patients treated with peginterferon
alfa-2a may help physicians make individualized treatment
decisions that should ultimately increase the rate of
response in patients with CHB.
