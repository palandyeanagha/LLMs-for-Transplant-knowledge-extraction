Abstract
Drug discovery is a time-consuming, high-investment, and high-risk process in traditional drug 
development. Drug repositioning has become a popular strategy in recent years. Different from 
traditional drug development strategies, the strategy is efficient, economical and riskless. There are 
usually three kinds of approaches: computational approaches, biological experimental approaches, 
and mixed approaches, all of which are widely used in drug repositioning. In this paper, we reviewed 
computational approaches and highlighted their characteristics to provide references for 
researchers to develop more powerful approaches. At the same time, the important findings 
obtained using these approaches are listed. Furthermore, we summarized 76 important resources 
about drug repositioning. Finally, challenges and opportunities in drug repositioning are discussed 
from multiple perspectives, including technology, commercial models, patents and investment.
Key words: 
Introduction
Drug discovery is a time-consuming, laborious, 
costly and high-risk process. According to a report by 
the Eastern Research Group (ERG) [1], it usually takes 
10-15 years to develop a new drug. However, the 
success rate of developing a new molecular entity is 
only 2.01% [2], on average. As demonstrated in a 
report by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the number of drugs approved by the FDA has been 
declining since 1995 [3]. Moreover, investment in 
drug development has been gradually increasing, as 
reported by Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) [4] (Figure 1). 
This indicates that the cost of new drug development 
will continue to grow. Hence, it is urgent to find a 
new strategy to discover drugs.
Drug repositioning, also known as old drugs for 
new uses, is an effective strategy to find new 
indications for existing drugs and is highly efficient, 
low-cost and riskless. Traditional drug development 
strategies usually include five stages: discovery and 
preclinical, safety review, clinical research, FDA 
review, and FDA post-market safety monitoring [4, 5]. 
However, there are only four steps in drug 
repositioning: compound identification, compound 
acquisition, development, and FDA post-market 
safety monitoring (Figure 2). Due to the fast growth of 
bioinformatics knowledge and biology big data, drug 
repositioning decreases the time cost of the drug 
development process significantly. Researchers only 
need 1-2 years to identify new drug targets and 8 
years to develop a repositioned drug, on average [1]. 
Furthermore, the research and development 
investment required for drug repositioning is lower 
than that for traditional strategies. Drug repositioning 
breaks the bottlenecks of cost for many countries. It 
only costs $1.6 billion to develop a new drug using a 
drug repositioning strategy, while the cost of the 
traditional strategy is $12 billion [6]. Thus, drug 
repositioning offers an opportunity for many 
countries to develop drugs with lower investments.
In addition to reducing the time cost and 
investment, drug repositioning is also a low-risk

strategy. A risk-reward diagram is often used to 
describe the relationship between a risk and the 
reward on investment [7]. We drew a risk-reward 
diagram to compare repositioning and traditional 
drug development strategies (Figure 3). As shown in 
Figure 3, drug repositioning holds a higher reward 
with a lower risk. Because repositioned drugs have 
passed all clinical tests in Phase I, Phase II, and Phase 
III, their safety has been confirmed. In addition, some
repositioned drugs may be marketed as molecular 
entities and have more opportunities to be pushed 
into the market once a new indication is discovered.

Approaches to drug repositioning
The main issue in drug repositioning is the 
detection of novel drug-disease relationships. To 
address this issue, a variety of approaches have been 
developed including computational approaches, 
biological experimental approaches and mixed 
approaches. 
With the fast development of biology microarray 
techniques, various drug and disease knowledge 
databases such as DrugBank [8], ChemBank [9], 
OMIM [10], KEGG [11], and Pubmed [12] have 
appeared, and massive genomic databases such as 
MIPS[13], PDB [14], GEO [15], and GenBank [16] have 
been built (see Resource section for details). This 
knowledge and data further promoted the rapid 
development of a variety of novel computational 
approaches. Compared to biological experimental 
approaches, computational approaches have much 
lower costs and much fewer barriers [17]. In this 
review, we mainly introduce computational 
approaches.
Most existing computational approaches are 
based on the gene expression response of cell lines 
after treatment or merging several types of 
information about disease-drug relationships [18] that 
can be divided into different types from different 
viewpoints [19-21]. For instance, some researchers 
grouped drug repositioning methods according to the 
biological networks used [19], and others divided 
drug repositioning methods into two types: 
data-driven and hypothesis-driven [21].
However, the above studies did not 
focus on methodology. In this paper, we 
emphasized the core methodologies of 
drug repositioning approaches, so we 
divided them into three categories: 
network-based approaches [22-32], 
text-mining approaches [33-45] and
semantic approaches [46-49].
Network-based approaches
Network-based approaches are 
widely used in drug repositioning due to 
the associated ability to integrate 
multiple data sources. These approaches 
have been proposed in the past few 
decades and became a hot topic 
approximately ten years ago. In this 
section, two types of network-based 
approaches are reviewed: networkbased cluster approaches [22-24, 26] and 
network-based propagation approaches 
[27, 29, 31, 32, 50].
Network-based cluster approaches
Inspired by the fact that biologic entities 
(disease, drug, protein, etc.) in the same module of 
biological networks share similar characteristics, 
network-based cluster approaches have been 
proposed to discover novel drug-disease relationships 
or drug-target relationships. These approaches aim to 
find several modules (also known as subnetworks, 
groups or cliques) using cluster algorithms according 
to the topology structures of networks. These 
modules include various relationships such as 
drug-disease, drug-drug or drug-target relationships. 
The most common network-based cluster approaches,
including DBSCAN [51], CLIQUE [52], STING [53], 
and OPTICS [54], cannot detect overlapping clusters. 
To address this problem, Lu et al. [55] studied the 
drug repositioning of SCLC (small-cell lung cancer) 
using a k-means-based network cluster algorithm. 
Chemical-chemical interactions and chemical-protein 
interactions were utilized to select candidate drug 
compounds that had close associations with approved 
lung cancer drugs and lung cancer-related genes. The 
experimental results revealed that the proposed 
algorithm predicted some drugs for treating SCLC, 
indications which were verified by retrieving 
references.
Tamas´ et al. [22] proposed a greedy network 
cluster approach named ClusterONE with two kernel 
components: cohesiveness score and greedy growth 
process. There are three steps in the approach: (i) 
generating growth groups from the greedy growth

http://www.ijbs.com

process using high-cohesiveness seed nodes, (ii) 
merging highly overlapping group pairs, (iii) 
discarding some complex groups according to the 
threshold. The advantage of the approach is its 
generality, and it can accurately predict not only 
disease-drug relationships in disease-drug networks 
but also protein interactions in protein-protein 
networks. Yu et al. [23] proposed an approach to 
construct disease-protein-drug networks based on a 
symmetrical conditional probability and detection of 
modules on the network via the ClusterONE 
algorithm. As a result, potential disease-drug 
interactions were found—for example, the authors 
discovered that iloperidone could be used to treat 
hypertension. Wu et al. [24] developed a novel 
approach through combining ClusterONE and 
Louvain [25] to detect modules in a heterogeneous 
network built from KEGG [11] disease-drug and 
drug-target data. They found 98 clusters and 1160 
pairs of disease-drug interactions—for instance, 
vismodegib was predicted to treat Gorlin syndrome, 
while its original indication was basal cell carcinoma. 
Luo et al. [26] presented an approach named MBiRW 
with three steps: (i) calculating a comprehensive 
similarity between drugs and diseases; (ii) obtaining 
drug-drug subnetworks, disease-disease subnetworks 
and drug-disease subnetworks; and (iii) finding 
drug-disease relationships using a bi-random walk 
algorithm. Some novel disease-drug relationships 
such as Alzheimer’s-levodopa were found (see Table 
1).
Network-based propagation approaches
Network-based propagation approaches are 
another important type of network-based approach. 
The workflow of these approaches is that prior 
information propagates from the source node to all 
network nodes and some subnetwork nodes. 
According to the different propagation ways, these 
approaches can be divided into two types: local 
approaches and global approaches. Several studies 
have proven that these methods perform well in 
finding disease-targets, disease-genes and 
disease-drug relationships [27]. Local propagation 
approaches only take the limited information of the 
network into account and may fail to make correct 
predictions [28] in some cases. By contrast, global 
approaches containing information from the entire 
network perform better than local approaches. Most 
current researchers concentrate on global approaches 
to achieve outstanding performance. For example, 
Kohle et al. [29] developed a network propagation 
approach based on the global information of a 
network to find novel disease-gene interactions. The 
approach included three phases: (i) extracting 
drug-disease relationships and constructing a 
disease-gene network; (ii) obtaining the global 
information of the network using a random walk 
propagation algorithm [56] in the network; and (iii) 
defining global metrics to predict novel disease-gene 
relationships. The proposed approach performed 
better than other approaches, including the diffusion 
kernel approach, PROSPECTR [30]. In addition, 
cross-validation showed that the accuracy of 
disease-gene predictions is 98%. Vanunu et al. [31]
also proposed a global approach for finding 
disease-gene and disease-protein relationships via a 
network propagation approach called PRINCE. The 
method is based on formulating constraints on a score 
function related to the smoothness of the disease-gene 
network. In the proposed method, gene nodes adopt 
prior information as input and then pump this 
information to their neighbor node until convergence. 
The score function gives a confidence level for each 
predicted disease-gene pair. PRINCE was evaluated 
on 1369 disease data points from OMIM and could 
predict unknown causal genes of some diseases such 
as type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and prostate 
cancer. Martinez et al. [32] presented a 
disease-gene-drug network propagation approach 
wherein two different propagation approaches were 
defined: propagation in homogeneous subnetworks 
(such as gene subnetworks) and propagation between 
subnetworks. They used a prioritization function to 
measure the correlation between drugs and diseases. 
As a consequence, a list of drugs was produced for a 
queried disease. Novel indications of some drugs 
such as methotrexate, gabapentin, cisplatin, 
donepezil, and risperidone were obtained using this 
approach. In addition, Emig et al. [27] proposed a 
comprehensive approach combining 4 local and 
global network approaches through a logistic 
regression model. The approach was evaluated on 30 
different diseases with known drug targets and 
yielded an AUC (area under the curve) above 80%. 
Furthermore, melanoma’s drug target c-Myc was 
successfully predicted, and this finding was also 
confirmed by two other experiential studies. [57, 58]
Network-based approaches are vital for drug 
repositioning. Researchers often need to make a 
decision in selecting appropriate approaches, and we 
summarized these approaches in Table 1 and listed 
their benefits, bottlenecks, key findings, databases 
and other information. The networks employed in 
these approaches can be divided into two classes: 
homogeneous and heterogeneous. As disease 
pathways can be constructed from protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network analysis [59], a 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, as a 
homogeneous network, is often employed in some

1236
approaches [22, 60, 61] used to identify drug targets 
involved with multiple pathways. Along with the 
deeper research associated with the network, the 
accuracy of PPI networks has been enhanced because 
numerous PPI databases have been established and 
updated by experiments. However, PPI networks are 
limited since they only include protein information 
without considering additional information. With the 
advent of the era of big data, the accumulation of 
various medical data (such as drugs, diseases, and 
targets data, among others) has made it possible to 
construct complex heterogeneous networks. 
Heterogeneous networks, which integrate multiple 
sources of information including genomes, proteomes 
and metabolic pathways [62], typically contain 
two-layer (i.e., disease-drug) or three-layer (i.e., 
disease-drug-gene) relationships and have attracted 
researchers’ attention. Different biological entities 
included in the heterogeneous networks not only 
provide an opportunity to improve the performance 
of existing methods but also offer a tool to design 
more efficient and stable approaches [24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 
55, 58] (see table 1).

Figure 4. The workflow of text mining.
From the method perspective, network-based 
cluster algorithms are frequently used to find 
interesting modules, and network-based propagation 
algorithms are often used to infer new relationships 
between biological entities. Network-based cluster 
approaches are general because most network-based 
cluster algorithms can be employed for detecting 
biological modules. For example, some cluster 
algorithms in the social network analysis field can be 
employed for detecting modules in biological 
networks [25, 63]. However, there is a challenge of 
network-based cluster approaches in that there exists 
no gold standard to test associations among biological 
modules. Network-based propagation approaches are 
easy to implement and can make accurate predictions. 
Researchers can obtain an AUC value and estimate 
the prediction results. In addition, network-based 
propagation approaches use not only information 
from the selected components but also information 
from expanding components.
Text mining-based approaches
Along with the exploration of drug 
repositioning, a great deal of medical and biological 
literature containing fruitful novel biological entity 
relationships have been published. There is a large 
challenge in extracting novel and valuable biological 
entity relationships from the literature. Text mining 
(TM) techniques have been widely used to address 
this problem and have been increasingly developed to 
mine new knowledge from scientific literature and 
identify connections between biological concepts or 
biological entities.
Marti Hearst gave a general definition for text 
mining as ‘text mining is the discovery by computer 
of new, previously unknown information, by 
automatically extracting information from different 
written resources’ [64]. The main pipeline of 
biological text mining includes four phrases: 
information retrieval (IR), biological name entity 
recognition (BNER), biological information extraction 
(BIE) and biological knowledge discovery (BKD) 
(Figure 4). In the IR step, relevant documents are 
extracted from the literature. These relevant 
documents need to be filtered because there are some 
useless concepts in documents. In the BNER step, 
valuable biological concepts are identified with 
controlled vocabularies. In the BIE and BKD steps, 
useful information is extracted to discover knowledge 
about biological concepts and build a knowledge 
graph. At the same time, potential associations 
between knowledge, such as drug-disease and 
drug-target relationships, can also be detected.
The origin of text mining methods in the medical 
field is the Swanson ‘ABC’ model, which states that if 
concept A is connected with concept B, and concept B 
is involved with concept C, then concept A may have 
a novel connection with concept C [65]. Based on the 
‘ABC’ model, various text mining methods have been 
proposed to find potential disease-drug relationships 
in the literature. A number of studies have been 
devoted to applying text mining techniques in drug 
repositioning. Li et al. [33] developed an approach to
building disease-specific drug-protein connectivity 
maps combining network mining and text mining. In 
the proposed method, they first extracted 
disease-protein relationships from molecular 
interaction networks using network mining. Then, 
they searched for drug terms indirectly associated 
with certain diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD) in PubMed abstracts through text mining 
techniques. Finally, drugs and proteins could be 
linked through drug-disease or disease-protein 
relationships.
As a result, diltiazem and quinidine are 
hypertension and arrhythmia drugs, respectively, but 
authors have also found that the two drugs could be 
used to cure Alzheimer’s disease, which has been 
confirmed by clinical evidence. Ruggero et al. [34]
proposed an approach to building sentence graph 
networks using text mining techniques. The proposed 
network can be used to discover relationships 
between any drug and any disease. These 
relationships are specific paths among the biomedical 
entities in the graph network. A novel disease target 
of sarcoidosis was identified using this approach. 
Rastegar et al [66] extracted drug-gene and 
gene-disease relationships from medical abstracts to 
obtain drug-disease relationships using a rank score. 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed 
approach, the obtained drug-disease relationships 
were validated in the Comparative Toxicogenomics 
Database (CTD). Experimental results indicated that 
the discovered relationships confirmed in CTD were 
highly confident. Jang et al. [35] developed an 
approach to building dependency graph networks 

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2018, Vol. 14
http://www.ijbs.com
1238
through extracting sentences with genes, drugs and 
phenotypes from biomedical literature. They 
calculated the possibility that a drug treats a 
phenotype based on drug-phenotype associations. 
The authors compared the predicted drug-phenotype 
associations using known drug-phenotype 
associations in databases and proved the good 
performance of their method. Kuusisto et al [36] 
proposed another text mining method named 
KinderMiner to identify potential indications of some 
old drugs. The method is based on co-occurrence 
statistics between drugs and diseases in the literature. 
As a result, new indications of some drugs such as 
Zestoretic, Zebeta, and Tiazac were found. Zhang et 
al. [37] reported an algorithm to prioritize anti-AD 
(Alzheimer’s disease) targets. The authors extracted 
224 genetic variations, 14 epigenetic modifications, 98 
proteins and 86 metabolites associated with AD using 
text mining and integrated these interactions to 
construct a weighted sum model to prioritize
potential anti-AD drug targets.
With the development of natural language 
processing (NLP) techniques, increasing numbers of 
text mining tools have been developed and used to 
discover repositionable drugs (see [38, 39]). Here, we 
summarized the inputs, outputs and characteristics of 
these tools in Table 2. The inputs of these methods are 
usually biological terms extracted from existing 
literature, and the corresponding outputs are lists of 
relationships of biological terms. The confidence 
levels of the relationships are generally evaluated 
using computational approaches or biological 
experiments. These tools can be divided into two
categories: static tools and dynamic tools.
Static tools were built on steady databases or 
documents with large size. Due to the large data size, 
the time performance of these tools was poor. To 
address this problem, indexes for documents or 
records were created to accelerate the query process in 
static tools. For example, DrugQuest [40] is a type of 
query tool for detecting drug-drug relationships. The 
workflow of this tool includes five stages. (i) Query, in 
which users provide a query term to retrieve related 
documents. (ii) Name entity recognition, which 
identifies proteins, chemicals and pathway terms in 
related documents using a biomedical concept 
recognition service named BeCAS [67] and identifies 
significant terms closely associated with the query by 
calculating the TF-IDF score (Term Frequency -
Inverse Document Frequency) to measure the 
importance of terms. (iii) Building document network, 
which uses the similarity of documents. (iv) 
Clustering, in which various clustering algorithms 
(MCL, K-means, hierarchical clusters) are employed 
to cluster documents on the network. (v) 
Visualization, in which the ‘tag cloud’ technique is 
used for representing cluster results. The DrugQuest 
tool is promising for knowledge discovery and 
drug-drug relation prediction. However, the 
proposed tool only supports the DrugBank database, 
which leads to limitations of the query results. Other 
query tools [39, 40, 68, 69] were also designed in a 
similar way (see table 2).

Static tools usually cause outdated result 
problems. To address this issue, many dynamic tools
[41-45] that update their document databases daily 
were developed. However, these tools also need more 
time to handle user queries. To reduce the time cost of 
queries, cache and index techniques were employed 
in dynamic tools. For example, PolySearch2 [41] used 
a cache technique to reduce the response time, and 
BEST [44] used an indexing technique to reduce the 
computation time. BEST is a biomedical search tool 
that returns a list of 10 different types of biomedical 
entities including genes, diseases, drugs, targets, 
transcription factors, miRNAs, and mutations for a 
query. The proposed tool consists of two parts: an 
indexing subsystem and a search subsystem. In the
indexing subsystem, the authors used a 
dictionary-based approach to extract entities from the 
text and create a document-entity to list paired 
indexes. To avoid the outdated results problem, the 
tool automatically downloads abstracts newly 
indexed from the PubMed system and updates the 
document-entity indexes every day. In the search 
subsystem, the proposed tool utilizes the inverted 
index to obtain matched query terms. All entities 
obtained from the query are ranked according to their 
integrated entity scores involving entities and query 
terms included in all documents. BEST is a real-time 
and constantly updated tool, for which the time 
performance and output quality are both considered.
Text mining tools reduce the time complexity of 
drug repositioning and assist researchers in verifying 
their experimental results by returning massive 
amounts of biological entity relationships. However, 
there are still some issues that need to be addressed. 
For example, the limited coverage problem is one 
limitation of text mining tools, which means that 
partially important biomedical entities or 
relationships such as mutations, targets, and drugs 
are not considered. Therefore, there is an urgent need 
to improve the performance of existing text mining 
tools.
Semantics-based approaches
Semantics-based approaches are widely used in 
information retrieval, image retrieval and other fields. 
Recently, these methods have been applied to drug 
repositioning. The workflow of these methods mainly 
includes three steps (Figure 5). First, biological entity 
relationships are extracted from prior information in 
massive medical databases to build the semantic 
network. Then, semantics networks based on existing 
ontology networks are constructed by adding the 
prior information obtained in the previous step. 
Finally, mining algorithms are designed to predict 
novel relationships in the semantic network.
Based on a hypothesis in which similar drugs are 
correlated with similar targets and similar targets are 
connected to similar drugs, Guillermo et al. [46]
proposed an unsupervised algorithm to predict 
drug-target relationships. The authors constructed a 
semantic network including drug-drug, target-target, 
and drug-target relationships. The proposed 
approach, which combines semantics link prediction 
methods and edge partition methods, was evaluated 
on a network. Due to substantial semantics 
knowledge being used, the proposed method made 
accurate predictions about drug-target relationships. 
Mullell et al. [47] presented a semantics data-driven 
algorithm for drug repositioning. The authors used a 
Bayesian statistics approach to rank drug-disease 
relationships according to prior knowledge. Then, 
they integrated ranked relationships with other 
biological entity associations to construct a semantical 
drug discovery network. To infer drug-disease 
relationships, the author applied an algorithm for 
detecting semantic subgraphs. As a result, 
nitrendipine, a potent blocker of the calcium channel 
(CACNA1S) used to treat hypokalemic periodic 
paralysis, was found.
Chen et al. [48] built a semantic linked network 
consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges 
with multisource data including drugs, targets, 
proteins, and disease pathways. Then, the authors 
applied a statistical model to predict drug-target 
relationships. Consequently, the proposed model 
identified some drug-targets pairs and drugs for 
repurposing. For example, barbiturate, a drug used 
for treating migraines, was predicted for use in curing 
insomnia with literature support. Zhu et al. [49]
proposed an automatic reasoning approach for 
heterogeneous semantics networks. Biological entities 
(such as drugs) are converted to labels in a semantics
network. Then, disease-drug relationships are 
obtained from automatic reasoning techniques. As a 
demonstration, the authors reported that tamoxifen, a 
drug used for treating breast cancer, can treat ovarian 
cancer, which was confirmed by the literature [70].
Semantics-based approaches take full advantage 
of semantics information included in massive 
amounts of literature. Therefore, the precision of 
predicting biological entity relationships was 
improved. However, there is a still challenge in 
constructing a semantic network by integrating 
multisource data. It is urgent to construct semantic 
networks that contain fruitful medical data.
Resources
Along with the development of biological 
technology and the accumulation of various omics 
data (genomics, proteomics or metabolomics, etc.), 

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2018, Vol. 14
http://www.ijbs.com
1240
more databases from chemical, medical, 
pharmacological and biological fields have been 
established. We summarized 80 widely used 
databases or resources that can be used for designing 
drug repositioning approaches.
Pharmacological databases [8, 71-76] are crucial 
resources for drug repositioning. These databases 
collect not only drug property data but also data on 
interactions between drugs and other biological 
entities. Pharmacological data lays the foundation of 
various computational approaches. For instance, 
DrugBank [8] is a unique bioinformatics and 
cheminformatics resource that combines detailed 
drug data with comprehensive drug target 
information. Many computational approaches, 
especially network-based approaches [23-26], were 
designed based on this database, which achieved 
excellent results (see table 1).
Proteomics databases [13, 14, 76-78] are another 
type of the data resource for drug repositioning. Most 
important protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
from proteomics databases are the basis of 
Figure 5. The workflow of a semantic network inference.

network-based drug repositioning approaches. In 
addition, proteomics databases are also important 
resources for building heterogeneous networks such 
as drug-protein-disease networks. One of the famous 
proteomics databases is MIPS [13], which includes 
manual high-quality PPI data from scientific 
literature. MIPS can provide PPI information for some 
network approaches [61, 77]. Moreover, it is a good 
resource for evaluating the experimental results of 
some computational approaches.
Chemical features of drugs provide important 
information for designing chemical-based 
approaches. Publicly available databases [9] [79-84] of 
chemical structures contain massive amounts of 
useful information such as 2D topological fingerprints 
and 3D conformations. Chemical information on 
drugs is usually employed for predicting novel drug 
structures to find new indications for drugs having 
similar structures. PubChem [85] is a famous database 
for chemical molecules structures. The database 
contains a massive amount of 2D data that can be 
used to measure the similarity of drugs and to 
construct chemical networks.
With further studies of drug repositioning, 
enormous amounts of medical and biological 
literature that contain novel biological entities 
relations have been published. Collecting massive 
amounts of literature is a necessary task for 
researchers; hence, many medical literature databases 
[10, 12, 86] have been built. Based on these valuable 
medical textual data, text mining approaches were 
proposed for drug repositioning (see Section Text 
mining-based approaches). PubMed [12] is the most 
widely used literature database. It comprises more 
than 27 million citations for biomedical literature from 
MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books. 
Citations may include links to full-text content from 
PubMed Central and publisher websites. Many text 
mining tools and search engines have been built using 
these databases (Table 2).
Although increasingly more databases are being 
established, choosing proper approaches to mine 
novel knowledge is still a large challenge. It is 
necessary to discover the potential value of the 
increasing databases and medical literature for 
designing efficient drug repositioning approaches. 
We collected these resources in supplementary 
materials Tables S2 to help researchers choose proper 
approaches.
Challenges and opportunities
Traditional drug development strategies are 
costly, failure-prone, and expensive ventures. 
Therefore, drug repositioning has recently drawn 
attention and brings drugs out faster for clinical use. 
However, drug repositioning is a complex process 
involving multiple factors such as technology, 
commercial models, patents, investment and market 
demands. Although many medical databases have 
been established, selecting the appropriate approach 
to make full use of massive amounts of medical data is 
still a challenge. It is urgent to develop new 
approaches for drug repositioning. The intellectual 
property (IP) issue is another highlighted issue to be 
solved. For repositioning drugs, IP protection is 
limited [87]. For example, some novel drug-targetdisease associations found by repositioning 
researchers were confirmed by publications or online 
databases; however, it is difficult to seek IP protection 
for such associations because of the law. The IP issue 
prevents some repositioned drugs from entering the 
market. Moreover, some repositioning projects are 
forced to be abandoned, which is a waste of time and 
money [88]. It is necessary to develop a new 
commercial model because the traditional commercial 
model is a serial model and causes overlapping 
investment issues.
Opportunities come with challenges. The first 
example of drug repositioning was an accidental 
discovery in the 1920s. After about a century of 
development, more approaches have been proposed 
for accelerating the process of drug repositioning. For 
this reason, drug repositioning has acquired great 
achievements. In supplementary materials Table S1, 
we list 75 drug repositioning examples collected from 
the comprehensive literature. Massive machine 
learning algorithms were introduced to improve the 
performance of drug repositioning in this scenario. In 
addition to computational approaches, experimental 
approaches that give direct evidence of links between 
drugs and diseases were developed, such as target 
screening approaches [87-91], cell assay approaches 
[92-95], animal model approaches [96-99] and clinical 
approaches [49]. These approaches are reliable and 
credible. In recent years, increasing numbers of 
researchers have combined computational 
approaches and experimental approaches to find new 
indications for drugs, called mixed approaches [59, 
100, 101], wherein the result of computational 
methods was validated by biological experiments and 
clinical tests. Mixed approaches offer opportunities 
for developing repositioned drug effectively and 
rapidly.
Generating secondary patents provides an 
opportunity for researchers to find new indications 
for existing drugs. With the IP problem solved, many 
repositioning projects have been conducted smoothly 
with low cost, which has aroused concern from many 
countries. With regard to the commercial model, 
parallel strategies bring significant improvement in 

Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2018, Vol. 14

1242
the efficiency of drug repositioning. For example, 
multiple tests or studies are conducted for a candidate 
drug, which reduces the time cost for drug 
repositioning.
From the market perspective, a large number of 
diseases require new drugs to be treated, which 
brings potential economic benefits. Taking rare 
diseases as an example, there are over 6000 rare 
diseases that need to be studied. However, only 5% of 
them are being researched [79]. Rare diseases are a 
large potential market to explore.
