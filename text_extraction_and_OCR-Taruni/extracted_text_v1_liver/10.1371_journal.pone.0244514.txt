Abstract
Background
Nut consumption has been associated with reduced inflammation, insulin resistance, and
oxidative stress. However, the influence on the prevalence and severity of non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has yet to be evaluated.
Methods
4655 subjects were included as part of a colorectal carcinoma screening program (SAKKOPI) between 07/2010 and 07/2019 and analyzed 2020. Patients were characterized
using biochemical and metabolic parameters, as well as a detailed questionnaire on dietary
habits. The diagnosis of NAFLD was established using abdominal ultrasound. Consumption
of nuts was graded as: no consumption or <1 time/week, 1–6 times/week, 1 time/day and
�2 times/day.
Results
Mean age was 58.5±9.8years with a mean BMI of 26.5±4.7kg/m2. 2058 (44.2%) patients
suffered from the metabolic syndrome, 2407 (51.6%) had arterial hypertension, 2287
(49.1%) showed prediabetes/diabetes, 1854 (39.4%) had dyslipidemia and 1984 patients
(43.5%) were diagnosed with NAFLD. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome (1219 [48.7%] vs.
605 [40.2%] vs. 189 [37.4%] vs. 45 [31.7%], p<0.001) and NALFD (1184 [48.1%] vs. 594
[40.7%] vs. 158 [31.7%] vs. 48 [34.0%], p<0.001). On multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders and dietary patterns, nut consumption �1time/day
was inversely associated with NAFLD in the overall cohort (adjusted Odds ratio[aOR]: 0.719
[95%CI:0.558–0.926], p = 0.011). However, following subgroup analysis, this inverse association was only confirmed in male patients (aOR: 0.589 [95%CI: 0.411–0.844], p = 0.004)
but not in females (aOR: 0.886 [95%CI: 0.616–1.275], p = 0.515). Moreover, patients who
consumed nuts 1–6 times/week had a significantly lower prevalence of advanced fibrosis

Conclusions
Nut consumption might exert beneficial effects on the prevalence of NAFLD in males. The
negative association with advanced fibrosis warrants further investigation.
Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded the emerging complex chronic liver disease of the 21st century, being significantly associated with increased cardiovascular and liverrelated risk [1–3]. Despite the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, no medical therapy has been
established. Thus, lifestyle and dietary interventions remain the cornerstone of treatment in
these patients.
Nuts are nutrient-dense food containing bioactive compounds regarded beneficial for
health: vegetable protein, unsaturated fatty acids, fiber, minerals, vitamins, tocopherols, phytosterols, and polyphenols [4]. However, each nut type has a unique composition and different
amounts led to different health outcomes in interventional studies [5]. Importantly, most data
supporting a beneficial effect of nuts exist for almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and peanuts, followed other nut types [5]. For instance, two randomized controlled trials could confirm the
lipid-lowering effect of 10/60g almonds/day in patients with coronary artery disease or type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [6, 7]. In large population-based studies not differentiating between
nut types [4], their consumption has been associated with reduced inflammation [8, 9] and
insulin resistance (IR) [10]. Moreover, a large body of evidence exists for the protective effect
of nuts on T2DM [11, 12], metabolic syndrome (MetS) [12–14], obesity [10, 12, 13] and arterial hypertension [15]. Apart from these beneficial effects on aspects of the MetS, their role in
chronic liver disease and especially NAFLD merits further investigation since inflammation,
oxidative stress and IR are considered key drivers of NAFLD [16–18]. Recently, a Chinese
study reported a significantly lower prevalence of NAFLD in patients consuming nuts �4
times/week [19]. However, another Chinese study confirmed this inverse association of
NAFLD and nut consumption only in a small subgroup of men when consuming �8.86g/day
[20] while data from Caucasian subjects addressing this topic is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to
further elucidate the role of nut consumption on the prevalence and severity of NAFLD.
Materials & methods
Patients and design
4655 individuals participating in a screening program for colorectal cancer (SAKKOPI)
between 07/2010 and 07/2019 were included in this analysis. Only patients with established
liver disease (i.e. viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary liver diseases) or with consumption of a significant amount of alcohol (�2 drinks/day for females and �3 drinks/day for
males) were excluded from the analysis. All other patients without established liver disease
were included portraying a representative sample of the general population. Patients were
carefully characterized including laboratory and clinical data, and completed a detailed questionnaire on lifestyle and dietary habits. The study design and details of the clinical and biochemical work-up of included subjects have been reported previously [21]. The study was

approved by the “Ethikkommission fu¨r das Bundesland Salzburg” (approval no. 415-E/1262/2-
2010), and all patients gave written informed consent to participate.
Dietary assessment
Dietary data were collected using a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) which consisted of
69-items and was conducted in line with the questionnaire used in the SAPHIR [22], as well as
the EPIC study [23–25]. Patients completed the FFQ self-administered prior to all examinations. Data on alcohol consumption, intake of fast-food, vegetables, fruits, sweets, red and processed meat, white meat, fish, coffee and consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB)
and nuts were assessed. Specifically, nut consumption was reported semiquantitatively as no
consumption or <1 time (corresponding to ~10g) per week, 1–6 times per week, 1 time per
day and �2 times per day. Different types of nuts were not specified, and legume seeds were
included according to the interpretation of the patient. In order to quantify healthy eating patterns, an adopted version of the “Alternate Healthy Eating Index” (AHEI-2010) was calculated
in accordance with the FFQ being available [26].
Definitions
The diagnosis of NAFLD was established using ultrasound being performed by experienced
operators. The liver was considered”normal” if the echogenicity was homogenous and similar
or slightly higher than that of the renal parenchyma. Portal veins and diaphragm had to be
visualized. The liver was considered as”fatty liver” when areas of significant increased echogenicity in relation to the renal parenchyma were found. The severity of sonographic steatosis
was not graded [21]. Advanced fibrosis (�F3) was assessed using Fib-4 score, NAFLD fibrosis
score (NFS) and Forns-Index [27, 28]. Cut-offs for advanced fibrosis were determined as previously described: >2.67 [27, 29] for Fib-4 score, >0.676 for NFS [30] and >6.9 for FornsIndex [31]. Metabolic characterization included an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as well
as measurement of fasting blood glucose and insulin measurement to assess IR. T2DM was
defined as either blood glucose level of �200mg/dl after 2 hours following oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting blood glucose (FBG) �125mg/dl, HbA1c �6.5%, or previously prescribed antidiabetic medication including insulin. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was defined
as FBG 100-124mg/dl in non-diabetic individuals. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was
defined as a blood glucose of 140-199mg/dl after 2 hours following OGTT in non-diabetic
individuals. Prediabetes was defined as IFG or IGT in non-diabetic individuals. Dysglycemia
was defined as presence of either prediabetes or T2DM. Components of the MetS were defined
according to the revised definition of the International Diabetes Federation (2005) [32]. Visceral obesity was defined as waist circumference (WC) �80cm for women and �94cm for
men. Hypertension was defined as a blood pressure (BP) �130/85mmHg or previous prescription of any antihypertensive drug. Dyslipidemia was defined as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) <40mg/dl in males or <50mg/dl in females, triglycerides �150mg/dl or
previously prescribed lipid lowering drugs. The MetS was defined as at least three of the following components: Visceral adiposity, hypertension, FBG �100mg/dl or antidiabetic therapy,
HDL-C <40mg/dl in males or <50mg/dl in females or antilipidemic drugs, triglycerides
�150mg/dl or antilipidemic drugs. Of note, levels of systolic BP, FBG, blood glucose following
OGTT, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL-C and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) were only considered for comparison in the absence of specific medication. Chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) was defined as history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft or coronary stent.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26 (SPSS Inc., Armonk, New
York, USA) and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA) in 2020.
Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard deviation or median (interquartile
range [IQR]) depending on their distribution, while categorical variables were shown as numbers and proportions of patients (%). Comparisons of continuous variables were performed
using Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test, as applicable. Group comparisons were performed applying Chi-squared test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the associations of nut consumption on the presence of NAFLD and the
presence of advanced fibrosis, using the group with the lowest nut consumption as reference
category. Since the number of individuals in group 4 was too limited to draw firm conclusions,
groups 3 and 4 were combined for logistic regression analyses. P-values were calculated for
each group compared to the reference group, as well as P-values for linear trends. Multivariable models were adjusted for potential confounders including sex, age and BMI, MetS, and
dietary parameters such as alcohol consumption, intake of fast-food, vegetables, fruits, sweets,
red and processed meat, white meat, fish, coffee and consumption of SSB, as previously
described [19, 20]. Analyses on Fib-4 score and Forns-Index were not adjusted for age since
this variable is included in these indices. Subgroup analyses were performed in patients with
NAFLD, male and female individuals. A two-sided p-value �0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
Overall, 4655 individuals were included with a slight preponderance of males (n = 2395,
51.5%), and a mean age of 58.5±9.8. 2058 patients (44.2%) suffered from the MetS with 3278
(76.9%) suffering from visceral obesity, 2407 (51.6%) from hypertension, 2287 (49.1%) from
T2DM or prediabetes, and 1854 (39.8%) from dyslipidemia. Additionally, 280 (6.0%) individuals had previously diagnosed CCS, 152 (3.3%) peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and 148
(3.2%) had previously suffered from stroke. 2502 patients (53.7%) did not consume nuts or
consumed nuts <1 time/week, 1506 patients (32.4%) consumed nuts 1–6 times/week, 505
patients (10.8%) consumed nuts 1 time/day (once daily) and 142 patients (3.1%) �2 times/day
(at least twice daily).
Nut consumption, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular health
The prevalence of the MetS declined with more frequent nut consumption (48.7% vs. 40.2%
vs. 37.4% vs. 31.7%, p<0.001). Importantly, this trend was also observed for all singular components (Table 1). Similarly, the proportion of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases
decreased with increasing nut consumption: 7.5% vs. 4.4% vs. 4.0% vs. 3.5% for CCS
(p<0.001), 4.3% vs. 2.0% vs. 2.6% vs. 2.1% for PAD (p = 0.001) and 4.0% vs. 2.1% vs. 2.8% vs.
1.4% for stroke (p = 0.005).
Dietary patterns including consumption of alcohol, fast-food, fruits, vegetables, sweets, coffee, SSBs, red meat and fish were significantly different among these groups with less frequent
fast-food consumption and consumption of red or processed meat and a higher consumption
of fruits, vegetables and coffee in patients with more frequent nut consumption (Table 2). Consecutively, these subjects had higher scores in the adopted version of the AHEI-2010 (42.4±8.7
vs. 49.3±8.2 vs. 57.6±7.8 vs. 60.6±8.2 points, p<0.001).

Nut consumption and NAFLD
The prevalence of NAFLD decreased among nut consumption groups: 1184 patients (48.1%)
with nut consumption <1time/week, 594 patients (40.7%) with 1–6 times/week, 158 (31.7%)
with 1time/day and 48 patients (34.0%) with �2times/day were diagnosed with NAFLD
(p<0.001, Table 3). The prevalence of a Fib-4 score of >2.67 indicative for advanced fibrosis
was significantly different among groups (3.9% vs. 2.0% vs. 3.2% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.014), concordantly to the prevalence of NFS >0.676 (5.6% vs. 1.9% vs. 3.0% vs. 2.4%, p<0.001) and FornsIndex >6.9 (6.9% vs. 3.4% vs. 4.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001). Finally, patients had less elevated levels
of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT; median GGT/sex-specific upper limit of normal: 0.69
[IQR: 0.46–1.18] vs. 0.64 [0.44–1.08] vs. 0.56 [0.38–0.87] vs. 0.51 [0.37–0.82], p<0.001).
On multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders, patients
consuming nuts �1time/day had a significantly lower risk for NAFLD (aOR: 0.589 [95%CI:
0.558–0.926], p = 0.011) when compared to those within the lowest group (Table 4). However,
a linear trend across all groups was observed (p = 0.016). Interestingly, patients consuming

replacing dietary patterns with the adopted AHEI-2010 for regression analyses, there was no independently association with NAFLD (aOR per point: 0.992 [95%CI: 0.984–1.000], p = 0.063).
Gender differences
In order to address gender differences with regard to nut consumption, we performed genderspecific subgroup analyses in males and females. Differences in baseline characteristics are displayed in S2 Table in S1 File. The negative association with NAFLD was even more pronounced in males consuming nuts �1time/day (aOR: 0.589 [95%CI: 0.411–0.844], p = 0.004).
However, it could not be confirmed in female patients (aOR: 0.886 [95%CI: 0.616–1.275],
p = 0.516; S3 Table in S1 File). Although a trend for decreased odds of having advanced fibrosis
as assessed by Fib-4 score >2.67 was evident both in males and females consuming nuts 1–6
times/week, a significant associated could only be confirmed in males applying the Fornsindex >6.9 (aOR: 0.610 [95%CI: 0.402–0.924], p = 0.020). Again, the adopted AHEI-2010 was
not associated with NAFLD in males (aOR: 0.992, [95%CI: 0.982–1.003], p = 0.156) or females
(aOR: 0.994, [95%CI: 0.982–1.007], p = 0.347).
Discussion
Nuts have previously been associated with a reduced risk for MetS, especially T2DM, hypertension and obesity [11–14], and reduced risk for cardiovascular disease and death [33], while
recently, a potentially protective effect on the prevalence of NAFLD was proposed in two
Asian cohorts [19, 20]. In our study, we show that nut consumption at least once a day was
associated with a significantly decreased risk for NAFLD while any consumption of nuts was
linked to a lower prevalence of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD subjects. Moreover, we confirm
other study results showing a lower prevalence of MetS and cardiovascular diseases among
nut-consumers [13, 14].
Generally speaking, nuts are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA), vegetable protein, fibers, folate, vitamins (e.g. tocopherols) and minerals (e.g. copper),

among other bioactive compounds including carotenoids, phytosterols and polyphenolic compounds including flavonoids [5, 34–36]. Specifically, folate has been associated with counteracting atherothrombotic properties of homocysteine [37] while phytosterols might interfere
with cholesterol absorption [4]. Tocopherol (i.e. vitamin E) and polyphenols have protective
properties against free radicals and oxidative stress [4, 38], with flavonoid intake being linked
to reduced all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality [39], and tocopherol being widely
used off-label to treat NAFLD due to its beneficial effects on liver enzyme elevations and histology improvement [40]. Other important components are omega-3-fatty-acids: Their dietary
supplementation has recently been associated with reduced triglyceride levels and cardioprotective effects [41, 42]. Carotenoids—especially β-carotene–have also been attributed certain
antioxidative effects, and recent study results showed that consuming high amounts of carotenoids lowered the risk of NAFLD [43], and improved lipid profiles in an animal models [44].
Finally, nondigestible components of nuts act as probiotics providing beneficial substrates for
the gut microbiota [45]. Thus, several components and their synergetic interaction could
explain a potential favorable effect on human physiology [4]. Interestingly, copper deficiency
has previously been linked to disturbed iron homeostasis in NAFLD [46], potentially aggravating the natural course of NAFLD [47, 48]. Although copper supplementation by nut consumption might counteract harmful effects of copper deficiency in NAFLD, considerable variations
in copper content of different nuts need to be considered.
Recently, Zhang et al [19] reported on a large retrospective cohort of 23915 patients excluding those with cardiovascular diseases or cancer, and found a significantly lower prevalence of
NAFLD in patients consuming nuts �4 times/week, being equivalent to �200-240g/week.
However, a smaller Chinese cohort study including 1068 patients, could only reproduce this
finding in males within the highest quartile of nut intake [20]. Together, these studies add up
to evidence from small cohort studies (<400 patients) reporting benefits for subjects with
NAFLD [49–51]. Although we confirm these data in a representative cohort of Caucasian individuals, subgroup analyses could only reproduce this inverse association in male individuals.
This is interesting since our findings go in line with previous studies reporting an association
only in males [20, 49]. However, we can only speculate on potential explanations: First, the
benefit of nut consumption might be better discernible in men on the background of more
prevalent NAFLD and more pronounced MetS components [52]. Moreover, men usually have
larger visceral fat mass, being associated with a more pro-inflammatory profile [53], which
directly releases free-fatty acids into the portal vein, thereby promoting fat-accumulation in
the liver [54]. Second, women are considered to have a higher awareness for healthy nutrition
[55], which is also indicated by a higher prevalence of female gender in more frequent nut consumption groups in our study. Thus, the effect of nuts could be mitigated by other healthy dietary patterns.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which proposes a beneficial effect of
nuts on the prevalence of advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Although we cannot
explain why the effect on fibrosis seems to start already when consuming nuts less frequently
(i.e. 1–6 times/week), our data allow speculation that the beneficial effect on subsequent
inflammation in the liver might already be evident at lower levels. Of note, we show that
inflammation markers gradually decline with more frequent nut consumption, presumably
indicating less inflammation, being the most important driver of fibrogenesis [56]. However,
we acknowledge that blood inflammation markers may not fully mirror inflammation in the
liver.
Additionally, it is unclear whether the beneficial effect of nuts follows a linear or U-shaped
curve. Despite the large number of favorable bioactive compounds, nuts are also rich in fat
and calories [4], consequently boosting one’s energy intake if consumed on a daily basis. This

is supported by similar cholesterol and LDL-C levels among our patient groups independent
from their amount of nut consumption. Thus, a frequent consumption might in some terms
limit the beneficial effect of nuts’ healthy components.
This study has strengths with regard to investigating the link between fatty liver and dietary
habits. To begin with, patients underwent careful metabolic and characterization in the
absence of clinical suspicion or indication for diagnostic work-up. Due to the coincidence that
endoscopies are mainly performed at the General Hospital Oberndorf in the local catchment
area, we are confident that we could obtain a representative sample of the general population
at risk for NAFLD (~60 years of age). Importantly, the fact that no other regulations existed on
which patients were included in the study (e.g. type of insurance or comorbidities), mitigated
selection bias, which is often introduced in other liver-centered studies.
However, several limitations need to be considered when interpreting our results. To begin
with, we acknowledge that nut types are unique in their composition and their effect on
human health [5] especially when prepared differently (e.g. roasted, cooked, salted). However,
we did not specifically assess nut types and preparation. Thus, we cannot exclude that differences in preparation (e.g. with chocolate in candy or baked goods) mitigate the associations
reported in this study, and might decrease the study’s impact. This is especially true for peanuts, which are commonly misclassified as nuts despite being legumes, which is likely to have
occurred in our study. However, from the patient’s point-of-view, specifying different nut
types would increase uncertainties on true consumption since their frequency again decreases,
and overreporting. From a statistical point of view, it would decrease statistical power. Therefore, we could not dissect potentially diverse effects of different nut types. Secondly, dietary
habits assessed using FFQ are always patient-reported and therefore subject to response and
recall bias: The correctness of the answers given by the patients can never be verified, nor can
the correct recall from the patients’ memory be verified. Also, FFQ require literacy and can be
subject to overreporting [57].
Data from our study indicate that nuts are part of a healthier dietary pattern with significant
differences among several healthy or unhealthy food types (Table 2). Demonstrated by a higher
score in the AHEI-2020, these patients adhere to a healthier diet, which could accentuate the
associations which were attributed to nut consumption. Nevertheless, the inverse association
of nut consumption with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis remained significant after adjusting
for several confounding food types such as red meat, coffee, and SSB, which have been linked
to NAFLD previously [58–62]. Noteworthy, these significant dietary differences between
patients consuming nuts and those who do not can also be observed in the majority of studies
investigating the role of nuts [14], especially in those investigating NAFLD [19, 20].
Specific limitations of this study include the retrospective design which can only generate
associations, but never causalities. Unfortunately, physical activity was only inconsistently
reported and therefore could not be included as a covariate in regression models. Finally,
NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in our study. This is a limitation since
hepatic steatosis can only be graded qualitatively, with particular weakness for lower degrees of
liver fat. Therefore, a modest effect of any nut consumption might not be detected as a resolution of hepatic steatosis in our study.
Nevertheless, we demonstrate an inverse association of nut consumption with the prevalence of NAFLD in a large European cohort. In line with the literature, we confirm a stronger
association in male gender. Moreover, we are the first to report a potentially favorable effect
on the prevalence of advanced fibrosis. Our findings support recommendations for regular
nut consumption as part of a Mediterranean diet, especially in patients with NAFLD [63].
Future dietary interventional studies investigating lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory

properties of nuts in patients with NAFLD are needed to investigate the full potential of this
unique food type as an add-on treatment of NAFLD.
