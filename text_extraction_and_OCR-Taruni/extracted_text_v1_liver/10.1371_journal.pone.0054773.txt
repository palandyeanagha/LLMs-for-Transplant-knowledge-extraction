Abstract
Purpose: The effectiveness of nucleoside analogue on patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure is still
controversial. To address this issue, we did a review of the literatures and analyzed the data with emphasis on the survival
and reduction in serum HBV DNA level.
Methods: We searched 11 randomized controlled trials that included 654 patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver
failure. 340 patients adopted nucleoside analogue, such as lamivudine (LAM), entecavir (ETV), telbivudine (LdT), or tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and the remaining 314 patients adopted no nucleoside analogue or placebo. A meta-analysis was
carried out to examine the survival, HBV e antigen serologic conversion, and reduction in serum HBV DNA level. The pooled
odds ratio (OR) was used to reflect the treatment effects.
Results: The overall analysis revealed nucleoside analogue significantly improved 1-month(OR = 2.10; 95% CI, [1.29, 3.41];
p = 0.003), 3-month (OR = 2.15; 95% CI, [1.26, 3.65]; p = 0.005), 12-month survival (OR = 4.62; 95% CI, [1.96, 10.89]; p = 0.0005).
Comparison of 3-month HBV DNA showed significant reduction for adoptive nucleoside analogue patients (OR = 54.47; 95%
CI, [16.37, 201.74]; p,0.00001). Comparison of 3-month HBV e antigen serologic conversion showed a highly significant
improvement of HBV e antigen lost for patients received adoptive antiviral therapy (OR = 6.57; 95% CI, [1.64, 26.31];
p = 0.008).
Conclusions: The benefits of nucleoside analogue on patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure is significant
for improving patient survival, HBV e antigen serologic conversion, and rapid reduction of HBV DNA levels.

Introduction
Chronic hepatitis B(CHB),caused by the hepatitis B virus
(HBV), is a serious health problem worldwide, especially in China
and other parts of Asia[1]. Chronic HBV infection is the most
common cause of liver failure, which can develop as acute liver
failure (ALF) (in the absence of any pre-existing liver disease),
acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) (an acute deterioration of
known or unknown chronic liver disease), or a chronic decompensation of an end-stage liver disease[2]. Liver failure is a clinical
syndrome that the major liver functions, particularly detoxification, synthetic functions and metabolic regulation, are impaired
and it can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, jaundice,
cholestasis, bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)[3]. If the
patients could not received effective treatments, they get poor
prognosis because of the severity of the disease and the presence of
active viral replication, which is considered as a determinant of
prognosis recently[4].
As oral antiviral agents, nucleoside analogue, including
lamivudine (LAM), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), entecavir (ETV),
telbivudine (LdT), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), have
activities conferring biochemical, virological, and serological
improvement in CHB patients[5,6], and then generate the
function of preventing cirrhosis and, consequently, liver failure
and hepatocellular carcinoma, even for the decompensated liver
disease patients[7].
Recently nucleoside analogue have been proved efficacious in
improving the status of patients with severe decompensated
chronic liver disease and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)
related with CHB[8–13]. However, some effects for these patients
are less conclusive, like the effect generated by using nucleoside
analogue for a short-term time. Some studies reported they did not
produce significant biochemical changes and slow down the
progression of liver failure on patients with severe CHB liver
disease and acute exacerbation of CHB[14–16]. Hence, we
selected some randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and then
conducted a review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of
nucleoside analogue treatment on chronic liver failure patients.

Methods
Selection criteria
In the meta-analysis, we included studies from randomized
controlled trials that compared the antiviral therapy adopted
nucleoside analogue (included LAM, ADV, ETV, LdT, TDF) with
no antiviral treatment for patients who were undergoing chronic
hepatitis B-associated liver failure.
Though the concept of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is
well identified and the diagnostic criteria are unified[2], there isn’t
a clear general definition of liver failure induced by chronic
hepatitis B. According to the consensus recommendations of the
Asian Pacific Association for the study of the liver (APASL) about
the acute-on-chronic liver failure, the criteria of chronic hepatitis
B-associated liver failure and severe chronic hepatitis B formulated
by Chinese Medical Association[17,18], we made a criteria for the
patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated liver failure in the
selected studies. Studies were included when the patients met the
following criteria:
(1) previously diagnosed CHB or HBV induced cirrhosis;
(2) progressively raising in serum bilirubin level (.85 mmol/L or
.5 mg/dL);
(3) prothrombin activity,40% or international normalized ratio
(INR)$1.5;
(4) HBV DNA level .103 copies/ml;
And the exclusion criteria were:
(1) superinfection with human immunodeficiency virus(HIV)
and/or other hepatitis viruses (hepatitis E, A, D, or C);
(2) other causes of chronic liver failure, like drug hepatitis,
autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, et al;
(3) patients were receiving antiviral therapy at the moment when
they were recruited or had received antiviral therapy in 6
months before the studies;
(4) evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC);
(5) patients had received artificial liver treatment during the
studies
Search strategy
The investigators wrote a protocol and carried out a comprehensive search of Medline, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane
Center Register of Controlled Trials, Biological Abstracts, China
National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the Chinese BioMedical
Literature Database without language, publication, or date
restrictions. However, when the Chinese literatures have no
English abstracts, they would be excluded. In addition, reference
lists of the trials selected before and relevant reviews were
examined for other eligible trials. We also searched http://www.
ClinicalTrials.gov website for the information of prospective and
ongoing trials. Through the searching task, we used the terms
‘nucleoside analog’,’ nucleoside analogue’,’ nucleotide analog’,’
nucleotide analogue’,’ lamivudine’,’ adefovir dipivoxil’,’ entecavir’,’ telbivudine’,’ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate’,’ liver failure’,’
hepatic failure’,’ chronic hepatitis B’, and ‘severe chronic hepatitis
B’.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data were extracted independently by two authors, Feng Xie
and Long Yan. We screened abstracts of all retrieved articles and
then matched the full texts of all articles selected during screening
against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements on which articles met
the inclusion criteria were resolved by discussion until a consensus
was reached. Feng Xie and Long Yan completed the data
extraction using a standardized approach that gathered the
publication details and study characteristics: year of publication,
the first author, number of patients, sex, methods and design,
serum HBV DNA level and HBV DNA negative patients,
seropositivity and seronegativity for HBV e antigen (HBeAg),
alanine transarninase, albumin, serum bilirubin, prothrombin
activity or international normalized ratio (INR), number of
patients assessable for 1-, 3- and 12-month overall survival.
We used the Jadad score (maximum number of points is 5)[19]
to assess the quality of the selected studies based on the description
of adequate sequence generation, double blinding, description of
deviations and withdrawals. The score was 4 for one study, 3 for
one study and 2 for nine studies
Statistical analysis
The analyses were carried out using STATA 11.0 and Review
Manager 5. P values at,0.05 were regarded as statistically
significant. Since the study carried out by Yao-Li Cui had a threearm design: it separately compared two regimens (ETV and LAM)
to placebo, each antiviral arm was paired to the control arm
independently[32].
The data of 1-, 3- and 12-months survival, patients with
negative HBV DNA level, HBV e antigen serologic conversion in
each arm were extracted from each study and combined using
analysis method named Mantel and Haenszel [20] to calculate the
pooled odds ratio (OR). The odds ratios (ORs) reflected the
treatment effects. A pooled OR.1 indicated higher survival, HBV
DNA negative and HBV e antigen serologic conversion in the
antiviral arm. In order to identify the differences of effect of each
nucleoside analogue, the subgroup analyses were adopted when
the analysis was carried out.
Cochran’s Q test(Chi-square X2 test) and I2 test were used for
across studies to assess the variation across study results that is due
to heterogeneity rather than chance. I2 can be readily calculated
from a typical meta-analysis as I2= 100%6(Q2df)/Q, where Q is
Cochran’s heterogeneity statistic and df is the degrees of freedom.
Negative values of I2 are equal to zero. A value of 0% indicates no
observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing
heterogeneity[21]. In our meta-analysis, P.0.01 in Cochran’s Q
test and I2
,25% would be considered as there was no or low-level
heterogeneity, and the fixed-effects model was adopted when the
data across studies was pooled. Otherwise, the random-effects
model was used. I2
.50% was considered as significant heterogeneity. In addition to the use of subgroup and the random-effects
model, some explanation would be made. Publication bias was
assessed visually using a funnel plot.
Results
Selection of studies
A total of eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for this
review[22–32], including 654 patients. The strategy summarized
in Figure 1. Ten of these studies were from mainland China[22–
30,32], and the remaining one[31] was from India. The patients of
control arm in ten studies were required to take no nucleoside
analogue, and only one[31] adopted placebo as the treatment of
control arm. The oral antiviral agents adopted for the patients of
the test groups were: 6 studies used ETV[22–26,32], 3 used
LAM[27,28,32], 2 used LdT[29,30], and 1 used TDF[31]. One
study[32] was three-arm design, and it had two test groups: one
used LAM, another used ETV. In addition, excepted liver

transplantation and artificial liver treatment, all patients were
given standard medical treatment: intensive and care monitoring;
supplements of enteral or parenteral nutrition; intravenous drop
infusion albumin and plasma; maintenance water, electrolyte and
acid–base equilibrium; prevention and treatment complications;
etc. The characteristics of each study are listed in Table 1.
Survival
Four studies[24–26,32] reported the information of 1-month
survival contained 332 patients (179 patients took nucleoside
analogue). 145 patients in four studies used ETV and 34 patients
used LAM. There was no person died in one study during the first
1 month[26]. The only test arm using LAM presented the same
survival rate compared to control arm. The estimated pooled OR
for both four studies showed a highly significant survival rate for
patients receiving adoptive antiviral therapy (OR = 2.10; 95% CI,
[1.29, 3.41]; p = 0.003; Figure 2). To assess the heterogeneity, the
Cochran’s Q test showed P = 0.32 and I2 test had a value of 14%,
what indicated the degree of variability between studies was
consistent with what could be estimated to occur by chance. In
order to identify the difference of treatment effectiveness between
LAM and ETV, the subgroup analysis was adopted. The study in
LAM subgroup showed no different survival rate between the test
and control arms. The ETV subgroup presented even more highly
significant survival rate for patients receiving antiviral therapy
(OR = 2.66; 95% CI, [1.51, 4.68]; p = 0.0007), and the P = 0.69 in
Cochran’s Q test and I2 = 0% when evaluated the heterogeneity.
Five studies[23,27,28,31,32] reported the information of 3-
month survival including 282 patients (156 patients took nucleoside analogue). Among these studies, LAM was used in three
studies (69 patients), ETV was used in two studies (73 patients),
and TDF was used in one study (14 patients). The study carried
out by Zhao Rui had no person died in the first 3 months. The
estimated pooled OR for five studies showed a highly significant
survival rate for patients receiving antiviral therapy (OR = 2.15;
95% CI, [1.26, 3.65]; p = 0.005; Figure 3). The assessment of
heterogeneity acquired P = 0.32 in Cochran’s Q test and I2= 15%,
meaning there was no significant variability of these studies. The
subgroup of ETV and TDF had individual OR value of 1.38 (95%
CI, [0.54, 3.56]) and 7.33 (95% CI, [1.16, 46.23]). The OR value
was 2.24 (95% CI, [1.11, 4.51]) in the LAM subgroup, and it had
no evidence of significant heterogeneity (P = 0.34 in Cochran’s Q
test and I2= 7%).
There were only two studies[22,23] reported the information of
12-month survival contained 140 patients. All the two studies
adopted ETV as the oral antiviral agents for 70 patients. The
result also indicated higher survival rate compared nucleoside
analogue arms with control arms (OR = 4.62; 95% CI, [1.96,
10.89]; p = 0.0005; Figure 4).It had no evidence of significant
heterogeneity (P = 0.25 in Cochran’s Q test and I2 = 24%).
Reduction in serum HBV DNA level
Four studies[27–29,31] reported the information of 3-month
HBV DNA reduction. The concept of negative HBV DNA was
used to assess the effects of reduction in serum HBV DNA, which
meant the patients with undetectable HBV DNA level follow the
lowest detection limit of the test equipment. The lowest detection
limit was not mentioned in one study[27]. There was one
study[31] used the lowest detection limit of 50 IU/mL (about
280 copies/mL), and at 3 months, undetectable HBV DNA was
achieved in three of eight (37%) patients in the TDF-treated group
(eight persons were survival at the end of 3 months), whereas none
in the placebo group. The remaining two studies used the lower
detection limit of 103 copies/mL (about 178 IU/mL). The pooled

study used LdT (including 30 patients). The remaining one having
14 patients used TDF. According to patients lost HBV e antigen in
these three studies, the estimated pooled OR value showed a

highly significant improvement of HBV e antigen lost for patients
received adoptive antiviral therapy (OR = 6.57; 95% CI, [1.64,
26.31]; p = 0.008; Figure 6). It had no evidence of significant
heterogeneity in these three studies (P = 0.32 in Cochran’s Q test
and I2= 12%).
Safety
None of these studies reported patients developed significant
adverse reaction, or need for dose modification, early discontinuation. Only one study observed two patients had mild
gastrointestinal reaction after they took ETV[25], and that was
tolerated well and did not disturb the therapy.
Publication bias
A funnel plot of the studies used in the meta-analysis reporting
on 1-month survival is shown in Figure 7. None of the studies lay
outside the limits of the 95% CI, and there was no evidence of
publication bias.
Discussion
The result clearly indicated nucleoside analogue significant
improve survival, HBV e antigen serologic conversion, and rapid
reduction of HBV DNA levels. The effects of nucleoside analogue
for severe liver disease have been demonstrated by plenty of
previous trails. But most of them were not RCTs, and the
conclusions of many articles, even guidelines, originated from
them. What we wanted to do was to get a stricter conclusion. Now
that liver failure is considered as a complication of chronic
hepatitis B infection, and of course it would provoke concern in
recruiting a sufficient number of patients to conduct a controlled
trial using no antiviral treatment (even in areas of high
endemicity). What’s more, for patients with chronic hepatitis Bassociated liver failure, liver transplantation is currently regarded
as a primary and complementary measure[33], and withholding
antiviral treatment would have been considered as unethical,
which also made the RCTs have not enough participants.
However, in China and India, liver transplantation is not readily
available nor feasible due to the lack of organs and facilities for
liver transplantation. This had made some RCT studies were
conducted in these areas.
For patients with severe liver disease associated with CHB, the
severity of liver disease at the time of initiating antiviral therapy,
like elevated base-line serum bilirubin and creatinine levels and
detectable baseline serum HBV DNA level, is a more relevant
determinant of short-term mortality than the virological response[34] That may be the reason for not all patients got
benefits from nucleoside analogue treatment.
In our selected RCTs, eight of the eleven searched studies
published the survival data after using nucleoside analogue for a
short-term time. All of the eight studies showed positive results.
Nucleoside analogue can markedly suppress HBV replication by
suppression of HBV-polymerase activity, leading to improvement
of liver function and reduced incidence of fibrosis, cirrhosis in
CHB patients[7,35]. Recent data suggest that the prognosis of
patients with chronic hepatitis B-associated severe liver disease
may be related to pretreatment HBV DNA load[36]. The rapidly
suppression of HBV DNA load can stabilize or halt disease
progression, and thereby improves prognosis, despite when the
heightened immune response in the liver is ongoing[32]. From our
analysis we found nucleoside analogue also had significant positive
effects for the short-term HBV DNA reduction. Probably it caused
the improvement of liver function and even the benefit of survival.
Data regarding the efficacy of long-term treatment with
nucleoside analogue for those patients with liver failure was lack
in previous literatures. The severity of liver disease, the poor
prognosis of patients and the high mortality rate[37] has restrict
the conducted of long-term trails. One previous study followed up
patients who suffered from severe acute hepatitis B for at least one
year to observe the effect of LAM, found that there was no
significant difference in the clinical outcome, biochemical and
HBV e antigen serologic conversion between the LAM treated and

the placebo treated groups[13]. Two of our selected studies had
the data of 12-month survival, and when compared with no
antiviral treatment group, the nucleoside analogue treated group
had a higher survival rate (OR = 4.62). However, these two studies
were insufficient. Definite conclusion should be further studied and
discussed. Especially the risks of drug resistance on these patients
could only be acquired from long-term studies.
When we compared the effects of nucleoside analogues, the
strategy of subgroup was adopted in our statistical analysis. But the
selected studies can only provide the data of two or three
nucleoside analogues during the same period of time, the
comparision of effects brought by each drugs could not obtain a
definite conclusion. Previously some nonRCT studies had
provided information about the effects of nucleoside analogue
drugs for patients with HBV-related decompensated liver
disease[8,12,13,16,38]. Though all of these nucleoside analogue
drugs have been confirmed having positive effects of improvement
on survival rate, liver functions, reduction of HBV DNA, for the
severe liver disease patients, When taking efficacy and drug
resistance into consideration, ETV and TDF would be chosen for
the first-line therapy[38]. Due to the weaker activity against LAMresistant hepatitis B virus of ETV, and the fact that patients with
LAM resistance would get a high rate of drug resistance if using
ETV 1 mg/day for long-term, TDF could be considered as a
better choice than ETV for LAM experienced patients.
When initiating antiviral therapy, the severity of liver disease,
like elevated base-line serum bilirubin and creatinine levels and
detectable baseline serum HBV DNA level could affect the results
of patients[14,16,34]. It suggested us that antiviral therapy should
be initiated as early as possible before the liver disease become too
severe to be rescued.
In conclusion, though liver transplantation is currently regarded
as a primary measure for patients with chronic hepatitis Bassociated liver failure, the early initiation of adaptive nucleoside
analogue drugs for antiviral therapy is also necessary.

Finally, we had to mention the weaknesses of these selected
studies. The low quality and the conducted areas must be the main
shortages. When they were assessed using the Jadad score, the
score was 4 for one study, 3 for one study and 2 for nine studies.
And all the studies belonged to Asia (ten studies belonged to the
mainland of China, and one belonged to India). Obviously these
weaknesses could bring some limitations. Under ideal conditions,
more double blinding, and large scale randomised control trials
should be carried out.
