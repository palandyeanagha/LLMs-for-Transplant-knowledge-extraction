Reduction of blood product transfusions during liver transplantation
To the Editor:
We wish to suggest a technique for reducing red blood
cell (RBC) transfusions during liver transplantation.
Previously, correction of coagulation defects with plasma transfusions did not decrease the need for intraoperative RBC transfusion during liver transplantations.1
On the contrary it had produced a hypervolemic state
that resulted in an increase of shed blood. As well,
plasma and RBC transfusions have been associated
with a decreased one-year survival rate.2–4 The aim of
the present prospective survey was to evaluate whether
anesthesiologists could reduce intraoperative RBC
transfusions during liver transplantation by changing
their anesthesia practice, more specifically by maintaining a low central venous pressure (CVP), by
restricting volume replacement, by eliminating all
plasma transfusions and by using intraoperative phlebotomy during the transplantation.
With the approval of our hospital Ethics
Committee, 61 liver transplantations were prospectively studied during a one-year period and were compared to a retrospective series (1998-2002).1 A low
CVP was maintained in all patients prior to the anhepatic phase. Coagulation disorders were not corrected.
Phlebotomy and cell savers (CS) were used following
pre-established criteria (Hb $ 85 g·L–1, normal renal
function, hemodynamic stability and enough potential
blood loss to prime the CS). The purpose of the phlebotomy at the beginning of the case was to reduce the
CVP. Hemodilution was not used, which also avoided
coagulation factor dilutions.
The mean number of intraoperative RBC units
transfused per patient was 0.3 ± 0.7. No plasma, nor
platelets, nor cryoprecipitate were transfused. Seventynine percent of the patients received no blood products during their liver transplantation. The CVP was
lowered significantly from an average of 12.0 ± 3.9

mmHg at the beginning of the procedure to an average of 8.1 ± 4.2 mmHg. In 28 patients (45.9%), intraoperative phlebotomy and CS were used either
together or separately. The median for transfusion of
all blood products for the 72 hr postoperatively was
zero. There were neither cardiac complications nor
any neurological complications. There was no intraoperative death nor any death in the 30-day period postoperatively. The one-year survival rate was 91.4%.
The avoidance of plasma transfusion was associated
with a decrease in RBC transfusion during liver transplantation. Previous reports5 indicating that it is neither useful nor necessary to correct coagulation
defects with plasma transfusions prior to liver transplantation are further corroborated by this prospective
survey. Our data indicate that this novel practice does
not result in any deleterious effect.

The effects of prostaglandin E1 or oral
clonidine premedication on blood loss
during paranasal sinus surgery 
To the Editor:
In order to reduce blood loss during radical operation of
paranasal sinus surgery, we conducted a study approved
by our Institutional Review Board, comparing mild
hypotensive anesthesia induced by prostaglandin E1
(PGE1 group), normotensive anesthesia with oral clonidine premedication (clonidine group) and normotensive
anesthesia (control group). Twenty-four consenting ASA
physical status I patients were randomly allocated to the
three groups. The clonidine group received 5 µg·kg–1 of
clonidine as oral premedication and the other groups
received 10 mg of oral diazepam. 
General anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane
or sevoflurane in oxygen and 66% nitrous oxide. The
target range of mean arterial blood pressure was 80 ±
10 mmHg in the control and clonidine groups, and
70 ± 10 mmHg in the PGE1 group. Mean arterial
blood pressure (MABP) was controlled by volatile
anesthetics in the control and clonidine groups,
whereas in the PGE1 group, MABP was controlled
primarily by PGE1 at 0.05 to 0.2 µg·kg·–1min–1 and
secondarily by volatile anesthetics. The end-tidal concentration of volatile anesthetics was maintained
between 0.7 to 1.5 minimum alveolar concentration
(MAC) for the control and PGE1 groups, but between
0.4 to 0.8 MAC for the clonidine group because of
clonidine’s anesthetic sparing effect.1 All patients were
placed in a 5°reverse Trendelenburg’s position and the
same two surgeons performed all of the operations.
