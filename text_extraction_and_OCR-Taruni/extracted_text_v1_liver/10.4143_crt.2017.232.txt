Sarcopenia Predicts Prognosis in Patients with Newly Diagnosed
Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Independent of Tumor Stage and
Liver Function
Original Article
 Purpose
The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the prognostic significance of changes in
body composition in patients with newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Materials and Methods
Patients (n=178) newly diagnosed with HCC participated in the study between 2007 and
2012. Areas of skeletal muscle and abdominal fat were directly measured using a threedimensional workstation. Cox proportional-hazards modes were used to estimate the effect
of baseline variables on overall survival. The inverse probability of treatmentweighting (IPTW)
method was used to minimize confounding bias.
Results
Cutoff values for sarcopenia, obtained from receiver-operating characteristic curves, were
defined as skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar vertebra of  45.8 cm/m2 for males
and  43.0 cm/m2 for females. Sarcopenia patients were older, more likely to be female,
and had lower body mass index. Univariable analysis showed that the presence of sarcopenia and visceral to subcutaneous fat area ratio (VSR) were significantly associatedwith prognosis. The multivariable analyses revealed that VSR was predictive of overall survival.
However, in the multivariable Cox model adjusted by IPTW, sarcopenia, not VSR, were
associated with overall survival.
Conclusion
The presence of sarcopenia at HCC diagnosis is independently associated with survival.

Introduction
Sarcopenia is defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass and
strength [1]. It usually occurs as part of the normal aging
process in an elderly population, but is also associated with
various health problems, including liver cirrhosis [2], metabolic syndrome [3], chronic kidney disease [4], inflammatory
bowel disease [5], and cognitive impairment [6]. Sarcopenia
may also be associated with cancer, which is a leading cause
of death in many parts of the world and will be a far bigger
health issue due to increasing life expectancy.
Previous studies demonstrated that changes in body compositions were associated with poor outcomes in cancer
patients. For example, Kumar et al. [7] reported that computed tomography (CT)–measured muscle mass was associated with overall survival in patients with advanced ovarian
cancer [7]. Similar results were reported for various solid
organ malignancies including lung cancer, pancreas cancer,
renal cell carcinoma, and esophageal cancer, and for hema-

tologic malignancies such as lymphoma [8-12].
Among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), sarcopenia was associated with poor outcome after various
treatments [13-15]. A recent Japanese study found that
changes in body composition, including sarcopenia, were
predictive of overall survival in a large number of HCC
patients, more than one third of whom had previously
received anticancer therapy [16]. However, cancer treatment
itself can have either a positive or negative effect on skeletal
muscle mass, depending on the treatment response [17,18].
In addition, the severity of liver disease, assessed by tumor
stage and hepatic impairment, may affect sarcopenia status.
In this study, we evaluated the impact of sarcopenia on survival of patients newly diagnosed with HCC, after adjustment for multiple covariates which might have influenced
skeletal muscle mass.
Materials and Methods
We identified patients who are newly diagnosed with
HCC and whose first treatment plan (including supportive
care) was made at our center between 2007 and 2012. Patients
who did not have CT images appropriate for the evaluation
of skeletal muscle mass and abdominal fat area were
excluded. Patients who had other malignancies in the five
years before their HCC diagnosis were also excluded. Clinical characteristics included in the study were age at HCC
diagnosis, sex, body mass index (BMI), presence of diabetes,
etiologies of liver disease, presence of cirrhosis and ascites,
and level of functioning, measured by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale of performance status.
Laboratory characteristics included liver function tests, creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood count, fasting glucose,
lipid profiles, C-reactive protein, and tumor markers, including -fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K
absence/antagonist-II. Tumor features were assessed with
baseline CT imaging and included tumor size, number, type,
presence of vascular invasion, and Barcelona Clinic Liver
Cancer (BCLC) stage. Child-Pugh score, Model for End-stage
Liver Disease (MELD) score, and MELD-Na score were calculated at baseline for the evaluation of liver function.
Patients were diagnosed with HCC by their managing
physicians using the American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases guidelines. The diagnoses were confirmed by
the authors of the study during enrollment. Liver cirrhosis
was diagnosed either by a combination of medical history,
physical examination, liver function tests, and CT imaging,
or by histology when available.
Baseline data, follow-up information and mortality records
were fully accessible.
1. Measurement of skeletal muscle mass and abdominal fat
area
The unenhanced axial CT images (5 mm thickness) for each
patient were sent to a three-dimensional workstation (AW
5.5, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). A radiologist (D.K.)
with > 10 years of experience measured the skeletal muscle
mass and abdominal fat area.
For the measurement of the skeletal muscle mass (cm2
), a
cross-sectional image at the level of the third lumbar vertebra
(L3) was selected. At this level, the rectus abdominis, external
and internal oblique muscle, transverse abdominis, psoas
major, quadratus lumborum, and erector spinae were identified. Any intra-abdominal structure inside the inner boundCancer Res Treat. 2018;50(3):843-851

ary of aforementioned skeletal muscle was erased by manual
demarcation to maximize the accuracy of the measurement.
Then, the Hounsfield Units (HU) of 30 to +150 were applied
to confirm the L3 skeletal muscle mass (Fig. 1) [19].
For the measurement of the abdominal fat area (cm2), a
cross-sectional image at the L3 level was selected. A line was
drawn outside of the patient’s body and the total fat area was
measured with the attenuation value of 250 to 50 HU
(Fig. 2A) [19]. Then, an internal line along the outer boundary
of the skeletal muscles was manually drawn and the visceral
fat area was measured with the same HU range (Fig 2B). The
area of subcutaneous fat was calculated by subtracting the
visceral fat area from the total fat area.
All of the measured values were normalized to height (m2
)
and expressed as total fat area index, visceral fat area index,
and subcutaneous fat area index. The visceral to subcutaneous fat area ratio (VSR) and skeletal muscle mass to total
fat area ratio were calculated from the measured values.
2. Statistical analysis
The data were presented as mean±standard deviation for
continuous variables and the number and percentage for categorical variables. The relationships between sarcopenia status and continuous variables were assessed by Student’s t
tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. The relationships between
sarcopenia status and categorical variables were analyzed by
chi-square or Fisher exact tests, depending on the distribution of the variable. The optimal cutoff values used to define
sarcopenia in males and females were determined by the
receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.
The primary endpoint of this study was overall survival.
The duration between the date of HCC diagnosis and death
was calculated. Patients were followed up until death or
December 31, 2015, whichever came first. In the event of loss
to follow-up, censoring occurred at the date of the last visit
to the clinic.
The association between the baseline variables and overall
survival were determined using Cox proportional-hazards

models. Next, we performed the same analyses with the data
weighted to the population of eligible patients. To adjust for
observable differences between sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia patients, we used the inverse probability of treatment
weighting (IPTW) method with all baseline variables. The
IPTW uses weights based on the estimated propensity score
for sarcopenic patients and the inverse of one minus the
propensity score for patients without sarcopenia. The balance of the covariates in the weighted population was evaluated.
We computed standardized mean differences between the
two groups. We considered the covariate distribution to be
balanced if the absolute standardized difference was < 0.2.
All reported p-values were two-sided, and p-values of
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SAS ver. 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R ver. 3.0 (http://cran.
r-project.org/) software were used for statistical analyses.
The covariate balancing propensity score package in R was
used for the IPTW method [20].
3. Ethical statement
The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board of our center. The requirement for written
informed consent was waived.
Results
1. Patients
A total of 216 patients were identified during the study
period. Among them, 38 patients who did not meet eligibility
criteria (27 with no appropriate CT images; and 11 with concomitant malignancies) were excluded. The final study sample included 178 patients.
2. Characteristics of sarcopenic vs. non-sarcopenic patients
The overall c-index for prediction of survival in the entire
cohort was 0.55 (standard error, 0.03). After consideration of
follow-up time and censoring status, the adjusted areaunder-the-receiver-operating-curve (AUROC) was 0.55 for
males and 0.72 for females, for a 1-year observation period.
The cutoff points for sarcopenia were 45.8 for males (sensitivity 0.40, specificity 0.81) and 43.0 for females (sensitivity
0.69, specificity 0.73). Using these cutoff points, 62 patients
(34.8%) had sarcopenia.
Baseline characteristics of the study population according
to sarcopenic status appear in Table 1. The BMI of patients
with  grade 3 ascites was not calculated due to the possibility of overestimation. The mean age of sarcopenic patients
were 62.5 years, compared to 58.3 years for patients without
sarcopenia (p=0.043). There were more female patients in the

(23.9 kg/m2 vs. 21.6 kg/m2
), albumin (3.6 g/dL vs. 3.3 g/dL),
and hemoglobin levels (12.9 g/dL vs. 11.4 g/dL) were significantly higher in non-sarcopenic patients. Total fat area
index, visceral fat area index, and subcutaneous fat area
index did not significantly differ between the two groups. In
addition, the VSR and skeletal muscle mass to total fat area
ratio were also comparable. Other clinical and laboratory
characteristics, tumor features, and liver function, did not
significantly differ by sarcopenic status.

type (p < 0.001), portal vein thrombosis (p < 0.001), tumor
number (p < 0.001), BCLC stage (p < 0.001), and ECOG performance status (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with
overall survival. Multivariable analysis, that included nine
of these variables which were not highly correlated with, was
performed. VSR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.72; p=0.028), AFP level (HR, 2.55; 95%
CI, 1.37 to 4.74; p=0.003), tumor size (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02
to 1.13; p=0.005), infiltrative tumor type (HR, 4.51; 95% CI,
2.08 to 9.76; p < 0.001), and BCLC stage (p < 0.001) remained
statistically significant. The presence of sarcopenia was not
associated with overall survival (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.63 to
2.20; p=0.60).
4. Characteristics associated with overall survival in the
weighted cohorts
To control for potential confounding, propensity score
weighting using the IPTW method was performed. After
weighting, the covariates were generally well balanced
(S1 Fig.).
Contrary to the results of multivariable analysis in the
unweighted cohorts, the presence of sarcopenia was significantly associated with overall survival after IPTW adjustment (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.57; p=0.038) (Table 3).
In the analysis of VSR, which was significant in the multivariable analysis of unweighted cohorts, the ROC plot initially identified 1.5 as the best cutoff for predicting 1-year
survival (AUROC, 0.58; sensitivity, 0.56; specificity, 0.59).
When this cutoff point was tested by IPTW analysis, VSR
was not significantly associated with overall survival (HR,
0.81; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.45; p=0.48).
Discussion
The result of this study suggested that the presence of sarcopenia at the time of HCC diagnosis predicted poor overall
survival, independent of demographics, tumor stage, and the
degree of liver dysfunction. Previous studies demonstrated
that sarcopenia was associated with poor outcomes in HCC
patients. However, there are some points which need to be
considered. First, a recent Japanese study, which investigated
the impact of changes in body composition on survival in a
large sample of HCC patients, demonstrated that sarcopenia
and visceral adiposity were associated with mortality [16]. It
is noteworthy is that about 40% of the patients in that study
had previously received anticancer treatment, which can
affect body composition [17,18]. Therefore, to better understand the role of body compositional changes on patients’
prognosis, we examined the associations in an untreated
sample.
Another challenge was that baselines of untreated HCC
patients were heterogeneous and these factors might have
affected the quantity of muscle and fat. For example, as sarcopenia is an age- and sex-related change, elderly and
women are more frequently affected [1]. In addition, the
presence of cirrhosis and the degree of liver dysfunction
affect the sarcopenic status, even without malignancy [2].
There is no doubt that patients with more advanced cancer
experience “cancer cachexia,” loss of muscle mass and body
fat. Therefore, it should be clarified that poor outcomes in
sarcopenic patients may be due to sarcopenia itself or due to
other factors, which indirectly induce sarcopenia, before we
introduce emerging anti-sarcopenic drugs to HCC patients.
After we performed survival analyses for our sample of
untreated HCC patients, the IPTW method was employed to
reduce the confounding effects of other risk factors. IPTW
analysis is a weighting method based on propensity scores
and is generally considered to be a superior statistical
methodology for the adjustment of potential confounders in
observational studies when there are not enough patients for
matching [21]. The presence of sarcopenia, which was associated with poor overall survival in the univariable analysis,
was shown to increase the risk of death by 18% in the multivariable analysis, although this increase was not statistically
significant. However, subsequent IPTW analysis indicated
that the presence of sarcopenia was a statistically significant
risk factor for overall survival.
In addition to sarcopenia, we included other assessments

of change in body composition, such as skeletal muscle mass
to total fat area ratio and VSR. While skeletal muscle mass to
total fat area ratio did not predict survival, patients with high
VSR had higher mortality. In fact, recent studies demonstrated that visceral adiposity, represented by CT-measured
VSR values, was associated with poor prognosis in various
malignancies, such as colorectal cancer [22], melanoma [23],
breast cancer [24], and esophageal cancer [25]. However,
some other studies found that high visceral fat did not predict poor outcome [26,27]. After reviewing this literature, we
decided to analyze the clinical significance of VSR using the
IPTW method and the results indicated that high VSR was
not associated with a lower survival rate.
The determination of the independent association of sarcopenia on survival among HCC patients had important
implication for anti-sarcopenic treatment. In 2013, a randomized phase 2 trial which compared the effect of selective
androgen receptor modulator therapy versus placebo in the
treatment of cancer cachexia found that the lean body mass
of patients in the treatment group significantly increased
without serious toxic effects [28]. Studies which evaluate survival are underway for patients with non-small cell lung cancer [29]. A recent study by Sinclair et al. [30] demonstrated
that testosterone therapy increased muscle mass in cirrhotic
male patients without HCC, but no improvement in survival
was observed. Our study results, which demonstrate the
effect of sarcopenia on the survival of HCC patients regardless of cirrhotic status, may justify further studies investigating the use of anti-sarcopenic drugs in patients with HCC.
There are several advantages of our study. First, an experienced radiologist directly measured skeletal muscle mass
and abdominal fat area with a dedicated workstation, in
addition to detailed manual tracing, to maximize precision.
Second, we employed rigorous statistical methodology to
verify the effect of changes in body composition on survival,
adjusting for tumor stage, liver dysfunction, and cirrhotic
status.
Although this study had some limitations, which are
inherent to retrospective studies, we tried to overcome some
of these challenges through the application of rigorous statistical methodology. It is also important to consider the cutoff values for sarcopenia. Because the prognostic cutoffs for
sarcopenia were specific to our patients, who had relatively
leaner body composition than Western patients; further studies are needed to demonstrate whether these cutoffs are
applicable to non-Asian HCC patients.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the presence of sarcopenia was associated with overall survival in HCC
patients, independent of tumor stage, degree of liver dysfunction, or cirrhotic status. The presence of sarcopenia can
be easily determined by a single slice of a CT scan during
routine diagnostic evaluation. Additional studies are needed
to demonstrate whether anti-sarcopenic treatment in HCC
patients prolongs the survival.
