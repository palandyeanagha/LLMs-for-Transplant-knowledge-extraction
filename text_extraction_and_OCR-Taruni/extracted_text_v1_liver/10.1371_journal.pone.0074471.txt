Abstract
Background and Aim: Liver cirrhosis is associated with decreased hepatic cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) activity
but the pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not well elucidated. In this study, we examined if certain microRNAs
(miRNA) are associated with decreased hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhosis.
Methods: Hepatic CYP3A activity and miRNA microarray expression profiles were measured in cirrhotic (n=28) and
normal (n=12) liver tissue. Hepatic CYP3A activity was measured via midazolam hydroxylation in human liver
microsomes. Additionally, hepatic CYP3A4 protein concentration and the expression of CYP3A4 mRNA were
measured. Analyses were conducted to identify miRNAs which were differentially expressed between two groups but
also were significantly associated with lower hepatic CYP3A activity.
Results: Hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhotic livers was 1.7-fold lower than in the normal livers (0.28 ± 0.06 vs. 0.47 ±
0.07mL* min-1*mg protein-1 (mean ± SEM), P=0.02). Six microRNAs (miR-155, miR-454, miR-582-5p, let-7f-1*,
miR-181d, and miR-500) had >1.2-fold increase in cirrhotic livers and also had significant negative correlation with
hepatic CYP3A activity (range of r = -0.44 to -0.52, P <0.05). Notably, miR-155, a known regulator of liver
inflammation, had the highest fold increase in cirrhotic livers (2.2-fold, P=4.16E-08) and significantly correlated with
hepatic CYP3A activity (r=-0.50, P=0.017). The relative expression (2-ΔΔCt mean ± SEM) of hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA
was significantly higher in cirrhotic livers (21.76 ± 2.65 vs. 5.91 ± 1.29, P=2.04E-07) but their levels did not
significantly correlate with hepatic CYP3A activity (r=-0.43, P=0.08).
Conclusion: The strong association between certain miRNAs, notably miR-155, and lower hepatic CYP3A activity
suggest that altered miRNA expression may regulate hepatic CYP3A activity.

Introduction
Cirrhosis is associated with altered drug disposition and
often requires dosage adjustments in order to prevent adverse
effects resulting from excessive drug/metabolite accumulation
[1-4]. Although altered drug distribution and impaired renal
elimination could contribute to overall drug disposition, altered
activity of drug metabolizing enzymes is the predominant factor
determining drug disposition [4-6]. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A
is the most abundant hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme and
accounts for the clearance of more than 50% of those drugs
that undergo biotransformation in the liver including calcium
channel blockers, protease inhibitor anti-retrovirals, most
statins and macrolide antibiotics [7]. Although there is
considerable inter-individual variability (~ 50 fold) in the CYP3A
activity in healthy humans [8], it is variably and non-uniformly
reduced in cirrhosis [9-12]. Prior studies evaluating the CYP
activity in cirrhosis have also shown that the loss of CYP
activity is selective and dependent on the etiology (cholestatic
vs. noncholestatic) and severity of liver disease [13]. George et
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e74471

al. showed CYP3A activity (using testosterone β-hydroxylase
activity) and protein reduction only in livers of patients from
cirrhosis due to non-cholestatic liver disorders [13]. Frye et al.
proposed a “sequential progressive model of hepatic
dysfunction” to explain their data demonstrating selective
impairment of CYPs with severity of liver disease [5].
Unfortunately, CYP3A activity was not evaluated in their study
[5]. Our group has previously reported a 2-fold reduction in
CYP3A activity in patients with cirrhosis [14].
In healthy humans, the genetic variability in CYP3A activity
could to a certain degree be explained through cis-acting
elements e.g. genetic polymorphisms [8] and/or trans-acting
factors such as pregnane X receptor (PXR, or nuclear receptor
subfamily 1, group I, member 2 [NR1I2]) and constitutive
androstane receptor (CAR, or nuclear receptor subfamily 1,
group I, member 3 [NR1I3]) [15-19]. Wolbold et al. have also
shown a positive correlation between PXR and CYP3A4 mRNA
and protein expression in a collection of human liver biopsy
tissue samples, suggesting that PXR strongly regulates the
expression of CYP3A4 [20]. Some studies have suggested pretranslational regulation of CYP3A mRNA expression and
activity through modulation of PXR [13,21]. Others have
suggested epigenetic modification for CYP3A4 gene promoters
[22]. More recently, Klein et al., have reported that peroxisome
proliferator–activated receptor-α (PPAR α or nuclear receptor
subfamily 1, group C, member 1 [NR1C1]) is also involved in
the regulation of CYP3A protein in liver [23]. However, in
pathological situations like cirrhosis, inflammatory signaling
pathways may interfere with constitutive expression, leading to
significant downregulation [24]. The exact mechanisms behind
these translational or posttranscriptional regulations of hepatic
CYP3A in cirrhosis are currently not well understood.
Recently discovered, microRNAs (miRNAs / miRs) are small
(18-25 nucleotides), non-coding RNAs that bind to the 3’-
untranslated region (3’-UTR) of mRNA and negatively regulate
gene expression. These miRNAs regulate gene expression by
one of the two following mechanisms - by blocking protein
translation or by cleaving the mRNA and thus could at least in
part contribute to post-transcriptional regulation of gene. The
physiological and biological significance of miRNAs in liver
function is well illustrated through down regulation of
hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), a key transcription
factor regulation of endogenous, xenobiotic metabolizing
enzymes and transporters [25-28]. Similarly, in-silico [29] and
experimental analysis have also suggested that miRNAs are
important regulators for CYP3A as well as PXR [21,30-34]. For
example, miR27-b and mmu-miR298 decreased CYP3A4
mRNA and protein expression level in human embryonic
kidney cells in transient transfection experiment [32].
Furthermore, down-regulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) by
the two miRNA led them to conclude that CYP3A4 gene
expression could be regulated by miRNAs at both the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional level [32]. Takagi et al.
investigated the interindividual variability of CYP3A4 mRNA
reported that miR-148a post-transcriptionally regulated human
PXR, resulting in the modulation of the inducible and/or
constitutive levels of CYP3A4 in human liver [21]. On the other
hand, earlier studies profiling miRNAs in liver diseases have
identified a number of miRNAs significantly up- or downregulated in human liver diseases including cirrhosis (for
review: Gastroenterology. 2012 Jun; 142(7):1431-43.),
suggesting that miRNAs are critical regulators for liver function
in liver disease. It is thus plausible to expect significant hepatic
miRNA changes in cirrhosis that could potentially mediate the
altered CYP activity, via transcriptional or translational
regulations. We hypothesized in this study that the decreased
CYP3A activity in cirrhosis is associated with significantly
upregulated miRNAs that regulate CYP3A4 gene expression
by targeting nuclear receptors (PXR, CAR or PPARα) mRNA or
directly targeting CYP3A4 mRNA. The purpose of the current
study is to determine the differentially expressed miRNAs in
cirrhosis that are significantly associated with decreased
CYP3A activity and examine the relationship with the nuclear
receptor gene expression.
Materials and Methods
Human liver samples
This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IUPUI # 0504-58 and EX0904-11) at Indiana
University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA. The
institutional review board waived the need for consent. This
study is based on 40 human liver tissue samples collected from
individuals with cirrhosis and those with normal liver tissue
(Table 1). Liver tissue was collected from individuals with
established cirrhosis (n=28) at the time of their liver
transplantation procedure in the operating room. Demographic
data, etiology of cirrhosis and other relevant information such
as medication, alcohol use, and smoking history were captured
at the time of enrollment. Normal liver tissue (n=12) was
obtained from patients undergoing liver resection for
metastatic/benign liver lesions with no underlying chronic liver
disease. Histopathological evaluation with hematoxylin and
eosin staining was used to assess tumor adjacent normal liver
tissue in order to exclude occult chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
Liver tissue samples were snap frozen using liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C until use. All samples were collected and
handled equally except for duration of storage.
CYP3A activity in cirrhosis and normal liver tissue
Liver homogenates were prepared and suspended in buffer
and stored in a -80°C freezer until use. The protein
concentration of the homogenates was assayed using Lowry
method [35]. Hepatic microsomes were prepared as published
previously [35] and stored at −80°C until used. The CYP3A
activity was quantified in human liver microsomes using
midazolam 1’-hydroxylation as probe reaction. In brief,
midazolam (0.25-75 µmol/L) was incubated with human liver
microsomes (0.25-800 µg total protein), 100 mmol/L phosphate
buffer pH = 7.4, and 2 mmol/L reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate for 2 minutes. The reaction was
stopped with an equal volume of acetonitrile. 1’-OH midazolam
was quantified from the supernatant with HPLC-UV (λ = 254)
using alprazolam as the internal standard. The maximum
velocity of metabolite formation (Vmax, pmols*mg
protein-1*min-1), and the Michaelis constant (Km, µM) were

intrinsic clearance (CLint) of CYP3A was given as Vmax / Km.
miRNA microarray
Global microRNA expression analysis (485 miRNA probes
passed statistical filtering) was performed by Thermo Scientific
Dharmacon RNAi Discovery and Therapeutic Services
(Lafayette, Colorado, USA). The Thermo Scientific Dharmacon
microRNA expression profiling platform utilizes a proprietary,
two-color high-density 8-plex slide comprised of probes to
capture all human, mouse and rat mature microRNAs in the
Sanger database (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk). The microRNA
expression data has been uploaded to Gene Expression
Omnibus archive and is set for data release as of August 15th
2013 (Accession number GSE49012).
Confirmation of candidate microRNA and quantification
of mRNA expression using qRT-PCR
Total RNA including miRNA was isolated from the liver tissue
using mirVana™ miRNA isolation Kit (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY). To eliminate residual genomic DNA contamination,
the RNA samples were incubated with DNase I (RNase-Free
DNase Set, QIAGEN) on columns according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA quantity and quality were
measured using both Nano drop and Agilent bioanalyzer to
ensure the good quality of RNA. The amplification primers for
PXR, CAR and PPARα were designed using Vector NTI. With
the ABI 7300 qPCR system, TaqMan chemistry was used for
microRNA quantification and the SybrGreen was applied to
quantify mRNA levels. Following reverse transcription of the

RNA (Life Technologies), an aliquot of each reverse
transcription reaction was amplified in triplicate in an ABI 7300
qPCR system. This system generates quantitative data based
on the PCR at early cycles when amplification is in the linear
range and PCR fidelity is the highest. GAPDH and 18s rRNA
were used as internal controls for mRNA quantification and U6
was used as internal control for miRNA quantification. We
quantified CYP3A4, PXR, and CAR mRNA and miRNA levels
using comparative method (ΔΔCT method) and PPARα mRNA
levels using relative standard curve method (Life Science
htpp://www.appliedbiosystems.com) [36,37].
Western Blotting of CYP3A4
Randomly selected cirrhotic (n=5) and normal liver samples
(n=5) were used to measure the hepatic CYP3A4 protein
expression. Briefly, 10mg of liver tissue was homogenized
using the Mini-Beadbeater-16 (Biospec Products, OK, USA).
The homogenates were centrifuged and the supernatant was
collected. Total protein concentration of each supernatant
sample was measured using Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life
Technologies, CA, USA) and normalized to same concentration
prior to western blotting. For western blotting, 500ng total
protein of each sample was separated using 12% SDS-PAGE
gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes,
and then blotted with anti-CYP3A4 (XenoTech, KS, USA) and
anti-GAPDH (Abcam, MA, USA) as an internal control. The
blotted proteins were detected and visualized using the ECL
Western Blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences, NJ, USA).
Quantification of the intensity of blotted band was conducted
using ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The relative expression
of CYP3A4 was determined by normalizing the CYP3A4 band
intensity to that of GAPDH of the same sample.
Statistical and bioinformatics analyses
Batch effect in the miRNA microarray samples was removed
statistically. ANOVA analysis with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
and multiple test correction were performed to identify
differentially expressed miRNAs between cirrhotic and control
liver tissue samples. Comparisons of mRNA expression were
made between groups by using Student’s t-test. Pearson’s
correlation test was utilized to assess the correlation between
miRNA expression and CYP3A activity and between mRNA
expression of PXR, CAR or PPARα and CYP3A4 mRNA.
Nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the
difference in the relative CYP3A4 protein expression between
cirrhotic and normal livers. Results from correlation analysis
and ANOVA analysis were merged to identify a subset of
differentially expressed miRNAs which are significant
upregulated in the cirrhotic group (P<0.05) and yet had
significant negative correlation with CYP3A activity (P<0.05). A
P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
To predict the potential binding sites of the miRNAs identified
to control the CYP3A4 gene in this study, we first obtained the
transcripts encoded by this gene’s locus. Current annotations
from the Ensembl [38] suggest that two major transcripts
ENST00000336411 and ENST00000354593 are responsible
for the protein expression of CYP3A4. So we obtained the 3’
UTR sequences of these transcripts using Ensembl biomart.

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 September 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e74471

The 3’ UTR sequence of ENST00000336411 comprised of 464
base pair while that of ENST00000354593 was 1172 base pair
in length. Fasta sequences of 14 microRNAs found to correlate
with CYP3A activity were obtained from miRbase [39].
Genomic targets for microRNAs were predicted by using
microRNA Target detection software miRanda [40]. Miranda is
a machine learning method for ranking microRNA target sites
by a down-regulation score by integrating gene expression and
sequence level features. The algorithm trains a regression
model on sequence and contextual features extracted from
high confidence miRanda-predicted target sites and hence can
predict non-canonical and non-conserved sites. Target sites
and their locations were identified for the miRNAs of interest
using the max score threshold set to 110. A total of 55 sites
were identified on the 3’ UTRs of these two transcripts. Target
sites predicted by miRNA were formatted into a General
Feature Format (GFF) file using the binding co-ordinates with
respect to the UTR regions, to visualize the location of the
binding sites using GFF2PS tool [41].
Results
Hepatic CYP3A activity and protein expression
Hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhotic liver samples was
significantly lower compared to normal liver tissue by 1.7-fold
(0.28 ± 0.06 vs. 0.47 ± 0.07mL* min-1*mg protein-1 (mean ±
SEM), P=0.02) (Figure 1A). Similarly, CYP3A protein level in
cirrhotic liver samples was significantly lower than in control
liver samples by western blotting (P=0.01) and a quantitative
image analysis showed a 2.5-fold lower level of CYP3A protein
in cirrhotic livers (Figure 1B).
Differential hepatic miRNA expression and their
relationship to hepatic CYP3A activity
A total of 183 miRNAs were differentially expressed in
cirrhotic liver tissue compared to normal liver tissue with
P<0.05 and a fold-change ranging from -2.47 to 2.27. Several
miRNAs had significant correlation with hepatic CYP3A activity
and also had significant differential expression between
cirrhotic and control liver tissues (Figure S1). To generate a list
of miRNAs that potentially regulated hepatic CYP3A activity,
we merged the results of the ANOVA and correlation analyses
which identified a subset of miRNAs with significantly higher
expression in cirrhotic livers and also had significant negative
correlation with hepatic CYP3A activity (Figure 2). This merged
analysis revealed 14 miRNAs with higher expression in
cirrhotic livers but had negative correlation with hepatic CYP3A
activity (Table 2). Among the miRNAs, miR-155, miR-454,
miR-582-5p, let-7f-1*, miR-181d, and miR-500 had > 1.2-fold
increase in cirrhotic liver samples (Table 2). Of particular
interest is miR-155 which had the highest fold increase in
cirrhotic livers (2.2-fold, P=4.16E-08) and negatively correlated
with CYP3A activity (r = -0.50, P=0.017). There was a
significant negative correlation between mean expression of all
14 miRNAs combined and hepatic CYP3A activity (r = -0.53,
P=0.012).
Relationship between CYP3A4 and selected nuclear
receptor gene expression
The CYP3A4, PXR, CAR and PPARα mRNA were detected
in all liver samples and they exhibited significant variability in
their expression both in cirrhotic and normal liver tissue (Table
3). Their relative expression was significantly higher in cirrhotic
livers compared to normal liver samples (Table 3). To
investigate the association between selected nuclear receptors
(PXR, CAR and PPARα) and CYP3A4 gene expression, their
correlation was examined in cirrhotic and control groups
separately. CYP3A4 mRNA tightly correlated with PXR mRNA
(r=0.91, P= 2.50E-08), CAR mRNA (r=0.93, P= 5.42E-09) and
PPARα mRNA (r=0.92, P= 9.56E-09) in the control group.
Although not as stronger, this relationship was still apparent in
cirrhotic livers where CYP3A4 mRNA correlated with PXR
(r=0.46, P=0.01), CAR (r=0.51, P=0.006) and PPARα (r=0.54,
P=0.003) mRNA expression.

Relationship between selected nuclear receptors
mRNA, CYP3A4 mRNA and CYP3A activity
The negative correlation between CYP3A4 mRNA and
hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhotic liver samples failed to reach
statistical significance (r = -0.43, P=0.08). In cirrhotic liver
samples, there was generally a negative correlation between
CYP3A activity and CAR, PXR and PPARα mRNA expression,
but the association was significant only for PXR mRNA (r=
-0.54, P=0.02). Interestingly, in the normal liver tissue there
was no significant association between hepatic CYP3A activity
and CYP3A4, CAR, PXR or PPARα mRNA expression.
Relationship between miRNAs and mRNA expression
of selected nuclear receptors mRNA and CYP3A4
mRNA
In order to examine the potential role of the selected 14
miRNA in the regulation of hepatic CYP3A activity through
post-transcriptional regulation, a correlation analysis was
performed in normal and cirrhosis groups separately between
miRNA and mRNA expression of CYP3A4 and selected
nuclear receptors. In the normal liver tissue, the majority of
miRNA correlated with mRNA expression of CYP3A4 (57%)
and nuclear receptors (up to 93% for PPARα). In contrast, this
degree of correlation was not seen in cirrhosis (Table 4). Only
two miRNA (has-let 7f 1* and has-miR 500) correlated with
CYP3A4 mRNA and only one miRNA (has-miR 181d)
correlated with PXR mRNA.
In silico verification of CYP3A binding by miRNAs
In this study, to identify the binding locations of the 14
miRNAs found to be associated with CYP3A4 gene, we used
miRanda algorithm [40]. A total of 55 binding sites were
identified in the 3’ UTRs of the CYP3A4 transcripts (see Table
S1 and Figure 3). Figure 3 shows the distribution of these
binding sites across the UTRs of the two transcripts. While 14
miRNAs were detected to have a binding site in the UTR of the
longer transcript ENST00000354593, a total of 8 miRNA
binding sites were detected in the untranslated regions of the
second transcript.
Discussion
It has been long recognized that hepatic CYP3A activity is
decreased in cirrhosis and this reduced hepatic CYP3A activity
is a very clinical relevant issue because nearly 50% of all
prescribed medicines are CYP3A substrates. But it is not well
understood why cirrhosis is associated with lower hepatic
CYP3A activity. Intuitively, one might consider decreased
hepatic synthesis of CYP3A protein as the most likely
explanation for this phenomenon, but there has not been a
consistent relationship between hepatic CYP3A mRNA
expression and hepatic CYP3A protein concentration or
CYP3A activity. We examined if hepatic miRNAs influence
hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhosis and in fact we found
evidence to suggest that certain miRNAs may play a role in the

and the correlation of the expression of the same miRNA with CYP3A activity in the normal liver group (Y-axis). Each point

pathogenesis of decreased hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhosis.
The main observations are our study are: (a) it confirms that
cirrhosis is associated with lower hepatic CYP3A activity as
well as protein concentration; (b) some miRNAs are associated
with lowered hepatic CYP3A activity in cirrhosis; and (c) the
expression of CYP3A4 mRNA as well as a number of nuclear
receptors (PXR, CAR and PPARα) known to regulate CYP3A
expression is higher in cirrhosis. Based on these observations

we speculate that cirrhosis is associated with increased
expression of certain miRNAs which interfere with translation of
CYP3A4 mRNA and synthesis of CYP3A protein. There may
be a resulting compensatory increase in the expression of
nuclear receptors and CYP3A4 mRNA. The increase in the
expression of nuclear receptors and CYP3A4 mRNA is
suggestive of post-transcriptional regulation of hepatic CYP3A
activity by miRNA in cirrhosis.
We observed 14 miRNAs which had significantly higher
expression in cirrhotic livers but also had significant negative
correlation with hepatic CYP3A activity (Table 2).
Computational methods have played an important role in the
prediction of miRNAs from the very beginning. Traditionally,
some major features such as the hairpin-shaped stem loop
structure, high minimal folding free-energy, gene expression
relationships between miRNA-mRNA pairs and high
evolutionary conservation of the seed regions have been used
in the computational identification of miRNAs. A previous study
from our institution had predicted eleven of these fourteen
(79%) miRNAs (hsa-miR-454, has-miR-582-5p, has-miR-181d,
has-miR-500, has-miR-181c, has-miR-411, has-miR-363, hasmiR-381, has-miR-302c*, has-miR-652 and has-miR-452), to
target CYP3A4/5/7 3’-UTR using in silico approach [29]. In this
study, to identify the binding locations of the 14 miRNAs found
to be associated with CYP3A4 gene, we used miRanda
algorithm [40]. A total of 55 binding sites were identified in the
3’ UTR of the CYP3A4 transcripts (Figure 3). While 14 miRNAs
were detected to have a binding site in the UTR of the longer
transcript ENST00000354593, a total of 8 miRNA binding sites
were detected in the untranslated regions of the second
transcript. We found several combinations of miRNAs including
miRNA-155, miRNA-181 and miRNA-652 as well as
miRNA-363, miRNA-532 and miRNA-582 which clustered or
overlapped in their binding locations on these UTRs,
suggesting possible competition for binding to control gene
expression in a combinatorial fashion.
Importantly, several of the differentially expressed miRNAs
have previously been suggested to have a role in the
pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. Of significant interest are
miRNAs with pro-fibrotic effect (miR-32, miR-155 and
miR-15b*) exhibiting an increased expression, and miRNAs
with an anti-fibrotic effect (miR-18a, miR-18*, miR-19a*,
miR-19b-1*, miR-200a* and miR-335*) showing lower
expression in cirrhotic livers (data not shown) [42-44]. Among
these differentially regulated microRNA, miR-155 appears to be
the most prominent regulator as it was significantly associated
with lower hepatic CYP3A activity and > 2-fold higher
expression in the cirrhotic livers. Previous studies have shown
miR-155, a regulator of inflammation, to be increased in
different types of chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic liver
disease, drug induced liver injury and hepatocellular cancer
[45-48]. Our study is unable to discern why miR-155 and
miR-32 (and other 12 miRNAs) are overexpressed in cirrhosis,
but it is possible that underlying etiological factors (e.g.,
hepatitis C, alcohol, insulin resistance), hepatic inflammation or
liver fibrosis may play a role. Our findings suggest that
inhibiting these miRNAs by antisense oligonucleotides might be
an approach to correct hepatic CYP3 dysregulation in cirrhosis,

although admittedly the clinical relevance of such a strategy is
debatable.
Certain aspects of our study need further discussion. Our
study used microarrays to investigate the miRNAs and we
admit that next generation high-throughput, high-resolution
sequencing technology may discover new miRs and bring
added value, but the costs were still prohibitive when this study
was planned. Currently, microarray (microchip) profiling and
quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) are
the two most common methods. However, the results from
microarray and qRT-PCR do not always concur. In order to
address this concern, the top 5 candidate miRNAs from the
microarray profiling were further confirmed by qRT-PCR to
validate the accuracy of our microarray findings (Table 2).
Second, CYP3A5 mRNA was not measured in the current
study. However, it is unlikely that the differential expression of
CYP3A5 mRNA would affect our conclusions since its
contribution to total liver CYP3A activity is minor [49].
Moreover, subjects enrolled in our study are all but one nonHispanic Caucasian and are less likely to express CYP3A5 *1
 allele which leads to substantially expression of CYP3A5
protein and greater contribution to the total CYP3A activity. Our
study could not confirm the previously reported relationship
between miR-27b, mmu-miR298 and miR-148a and CYP3A
activity. We speculate that difference in the study design i.e.
human liver tissue expression vs. cell line transfection
experiments may account for the disparity. In addition to
miRNA regulation, post-transcriptional/translation regulation
may also be due to the altered protein synthesis, modification
and/or trafficking which we have not investigated in this study.
Conclusions
CYP3A activity is significantly lower in cirrhosis and was
associated with differential expression of hepatic miRNA. The
significant association between decreased CYP3A activity and
up-regulation of select hepatic miRNA in cirrhosis is strongly
suggestive of their regulatory role. Our study points towards
miR-155 and miR-32 as two potential miRNA which may a play
