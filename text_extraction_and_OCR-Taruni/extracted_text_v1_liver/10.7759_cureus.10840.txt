Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency has become a global pandemic affecting approximately one billion people worldwide.
Much attention has been paid to the association of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and
various chronic diseases, especially heart failure (HF). A clear role of vitamin D deficiency has been
established, with increased mortality and morbidity in heart failures. However, previous randomized control
trials have failed to show improvement in clinical outcomes with calciferol supplementation in these
patients. Therefore, it is still unclear whether calciferol therapy can be added to the standard care in
congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with deficiency. Hence, to evaluate the role of vitamin D
supplementation in CHF patients with low serum 25(OH)D, we conducted an extensive search in the PubMed
and Google Scholar databases using various combinations of keywords. All potentially eligible studies that
evaluated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes in HF patients were retrieved and
extensively studied. We also checked the references of all eligible studies to identify additional relevant
publications. In this study, we reviewed various mechanisms of vitamin D affecting the cardiovascular
system and examined the impact of deficiency on heart failures in terms of mortality and hospitalizations.
In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation has failed to improve the clinical outcomes in HF patients. The
possible long-term benefits of supplementation cannot be excluded. Therefore, for future clinical trials, we
recommend considering large sample sizes, longer follow-up durations, along with optimal dosage and
appropriate dosing frequency.

Introduction And Background
Over the last two decades, vitamin D deficiency is a major topic of debate even though a remarkable amount
of research has been done in the past. Indeed, according to recent research, 90% of physicians believe that
they overprescribe calciferol supplements, considering the lack of side effects [1]. This overprescribing is due
to the lack of specific guidelines for screening and treating patients with low serum cholecalciferol
levels. Nearly one billion people worldwide are affected by either a vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) or
insufficiency (21-29 ng/ml) [2]. A 2018 study that took data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) estimated that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 28·9% [3].
Researchers are aware that the role of vitamin D is not just limited to bone health, however, its role outside
bone health is poorly understood. Research has shown that vitamin D deficiency has a negative impact on
morbidity and mortality outcomes in patients who have chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes
mellitus, cancer, pulmonary hypertension, and auto-immune disorders [4-5]. Unfortunately, none of the
current evidence was able to explain the association between vitamin D deficiency and these chronic
diseases. A study by the Agency for Health Research and Quality reviewed nearly 250 studies and concluded
that the results of these studies are inconsistent, making it difficult to establish a possible link between
vitamin D and health outcomes [6]. Although a few studies have found a statistically significant reduction in
all-cause mortality with supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), further evaluation of these
results did not show such reduction [7-8].
Among these chronic diseases, cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the world and
accounts for 30% of deaths, leading to a huge burden on health care systems [9]. Although there are a variety
of cardiovascular diseases affected by vitamin D deficiency, congestive heart failure is the major one,
accounting for the healthcare burden in terms of hospitalizations, healthcare usage, morbidity, and
mortality primarily affecting middle and old age people [10-11]. As of 2017, almost 6.5 million adults have

heart failure and contribute to one in every eight deaths [12]. To be more specific, outcomes in these
patients can be changed and, in some cases, can prevent life-threatening events with simple lifestyle
changes such as the intake of foods rich in vitamin D, dietary supplements, and exposure to sunlight.
A recent study reported that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of hospitalization and mortality in these
patients, but it is still unclear whether supplementation improves the outcome or not [13]. Results from the
current literature have shown a wide range of variations and inconsistencies [14-19]. Thus, the effectiveness
of supplementation is still unclear. Therefore, no specific guidelines were made for the inclusion of vitamin
D therapy in the standard care of HF patients.
From this review, we are trying to assess the benefits of giving vitamin D supplements to CHF patients and
its effects on clinical outcomes of CHF patients with low vitamin D. This study aims to summarize the
results from previous studies, compare the conclusions, and finally draw inferences on whether vitamin D
supplements improve the outcomes. We are also trying to summarize the underlying pathogenesis and
mechanism of cardiac dysfunction in these patients. This summary of evidence will provide an update for
current clinical practice; it will also help to counsel HF patients regarding misconceptions of vitamin D use
and provide recommendations for future researchers.
Review
Effects of vitamin D on the cardiovascular system and its role in heart
failure patients
Extensive research has established a clear role of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in promoting the health of the
cardiovascular system. Of the various functions of vitamin D, regulation of the Renin-Angiotensin activation
system (RAAS) is the major cardiac protective action. Therefore, the deficiency can lead to uninhibited RAAS
activation and contribute to the worsening of heart failure by the retention of salt and water. Data from a
study conducted by Resnick et al. have shown an inverse relationship between vitamin D and serum renin
levels. This relationship is mainly due to the suppression of the renin transcription with the help of vitamin
D receptors (VDRs) [20]. Coming to the defensive role of cholecalciferol in controlling cardiac hypertrophy,
in-vitro evidence has shown that VDRs in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts are upregulated as a counterregulatory mechanism to hypertrophy [21]. The absence of this role favors hypertrophic response leading to
cardiac decompensation and heart failure. Another important role of vitamin D is its immunomodulatory
mechanism, which decreases inflammatory effects by promoting anti-inflammatory T-helper cells like Th2
cells and inhibiting Th1 and Th17 cells that are responsible for inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-
1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Few studies also reported that vitamin D suppresses the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [22]. Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between serum
25(OH)D levels and these cytokines, resulting in an inflammatory state in deficient patients [23]. Vitamin D
also regulates the metabolism of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and, in fact, these two also play a
major role in cardiac contractility and remodeling, respectively. Low 25(OH)D levels lead to decreased
calcium thereby effecting contractility leading to systolic dysfunction. In addition, deficiency may cause an
increase in PTH, which, in turn, causes myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy affecting LV systolic function.
So, fluctuations in vitamin D can lead to alterations in serum levels of calcium and PTH, thus affecting the
function of cardiac muscle indirectly. Taking into consideration all these different actions of 25-
hydroxycholecalciferol on cardiovascular health, researchers believe that improving the vitamin D status in
deficient patients may improve the clinical outcomes and overall mortality in heart failures. However, few
recent clinical trials have found that there was no added advantage even with supplementation of vitamin D
in these patients [14-17]. Therefore, the role of vitamin D as standard therapy in CHF patients is still
unclear. But there are few studies that have shown some positive impacts on these patients appealing to
researchers in need of further studies in the future to have a clear picture. Figure 1 below gives an overview
of different mechanisms that are affecting cardiac muscle either directly or indirectly.

Role of vitamin D supplementation in CHF patients
Several investigators have attempted to examine the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in CHF patients
and their results have suggested few recommendations for the current standard of care. A variety of
regimens (such as high dose and low dose) for different durations (long-term and short-term) and different
frequencies (daily, weekly, and monthly) were used in several clinical trials.
A recent study evaluated the effects of short-term vitamin D supplementation in heart failure patients for
eight weeks [24]. They studied its relation to blood pressure (BP) and physical activity and concluded that
supplementation has failed to improve BP and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) [24]. However, these results
should be taken with caution, as the sample of this study was very small, and therapy was given for a short
period without maintenance [24]. In contrast to this, a long-term clinical trial was conducted for three years
on 400 HF patients who received daily 4000 IU with all-cause mortality as the primary endpoint [15]. No
difference in mortality was observed between the treatment and control groups, with 19.6% of deaths in the
treatment group and 17.9% of deaths in the placebo group, concluding its importance in advanced HF [15].
Their data also revealed no difference in hospitalizations, the need for cardiac resuscitation, and
transplantation [15]. Furthermore, they noticed a greater need for mechanical circulatory support implants
in the intervention group indicating caution with respect to long-term vitamin D supplementation [15]. In
fact, this was the only RCT that provided evidence for the detrimental effects of moderately high-dose
cholecalciferol in HF patients. They cited high plasma calcium concentrations as a reason for the adverse
effects in these patients [25]. Coming to the limitations, this study has restricted their analysis to male
patients only, and further, it could not prove the causal association [25]. A clinical trial was conducted by
Scragg and his colleagues to examine whether a monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation can prevent
cardiovascular disease in the general population regardless of their serum 25(OH)D status [26]. A total of
5108 participants were selected, and half of them were randomly given oral D3 in an initial dose of 200,000
IU followed by a monthly 100,000 IU for a median of 3.3 years. Their primary outcome revealed no purpose
of giving supplements, and it did not prevent any cardiovascular disease (CVD) events [26]. They stated that
this non-significance may be due to their monthly regimen, however, a daily or weekly regimen can be more
effective [26]. This suggests the importance of dosing frequency. To understand its effects better, Witte et al.
conducted a randomized controlled trial with 229 patients with CHF and vitamin D deficiency [27].
Participants received either 4,000 IU of oral D3 or placebo for one year, the results showed clinically
significant improvements in ejection fraction, LV dimensions, and volumes highlighting the role in the
reversal of cardiac remodeling [27]. But supplementation had no effect on their primary endpoint of 6MWT
[27]. Similar results were also found in another RCT conducted by Dalbeni et al., in addition to an increase in
ejection fraction, the study also reported a beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure [28]. But when
compared to Witte et al., the major drawback of this study was its small sample of 23 CHF patients and

supplements given for only a short duration of six months [28].
Coming to the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum renin levels, a study by Schroten et al.
reported that there was a drastic decrease in renin levels in the treatment group [29]. They concluded that
this reduction in renin cannot be translated as improved outcomes in these patients, as the absolute
reduction was small [29]. But from the fact that sustained elevation in plasma renin activity (PRA) is an
independent factor that predicts adverse outcomes in HF patients [30], we can consider reduced PRA as a
positive interaction. They found no significant effect on natriuretic peptides that correlate with the severity
of CHF [29]. The short duration of six weeks could be a limitation of this study. Another study showed a
dramatic increase in serum 25(OH)D levels within six months of weekly high-dose therapy with a
proportional decrease in PTH [31]. However, this increase could not be correlated clinically, as they found no
difference when compared to the placebo [31]. The relatively small sample size of 30 subjects and short
duration of six months were the drawbacks of this study. A unique study from 2011 tried to evaluate optimal
treatment options for the adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency in heart failure patients [32]. In this study,
weekly high-dose cholecalciferol of 50,000 IU along with daily calcium was supplemented. Their major
finding was a decrease in plasma 8-isoprostane, which is a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation
[32], and this reduced oxidative stress was clinically correlated with improved LVEF (Left Ventricular
Ejection Fraction). Nevertheless, this study had its own limitations, first, the subjects recruited were
restricted to African Americans with heart failure and vitamin D deficiency and followed up for 14 weeks
only. Second, as the treatment regimen includes both cholecalciferol and calcium, their results cannot be
applied to cholecalciferol alone, and, importantly, they did not have a control group to compare the findings
[32].
A compelling amount of evidence has shown that inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of HF.
Few studies tried to evaluate the effects of supplementation on inflammatory markers [17,33]. A study
published by Witham et al. found no significant difference in TNF-a levels in the treatment group when
compared to placebo [17]. No changes were noticed in renin or aldosterone levels, but they found a clinically
significant drop in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels when compared to placebo, demonstrating the
effects of vitamin D on the cardiovascular system [17]. Although BNP levels were reduced, they found no
improvement in ejection fraction [17]. Another randomized control trial by Schleithoff et al. assessed the
role of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in reducing pro-inflammatory markers [33]. A higher level of IL-10 (antiinflammatory) and lower levels of TNF-a (pro-inflammatory) were noticed, thereby improving the
background inflammatory state in CHF patients [33]. Table 1 summarizes several clinical trials that
evaluated the role of vitamin D supplementation in CHF patients.

Role of Vitamin-D as a predictor for risk of hospitalization and poor
clinical outcomes
A considerable amount of literature has established the association of vitamin D deficiency and poor clinical
outcomes in patients with HF. The majority of these studied the outcomes in terms of hospitalizations, risk
of mortality, impact on LVEF, and effect on physical activity. A recent study reported vitamin D deficiency as
an independent risk factor for hospitalization in patients with CHF [13]. Furthermore, this risk was more
consistent in frail veterans when compared to non-frail veterans. An important aspect of this study was that
its results failed to show any relationship between mortality and deficiency [13]. The main reasons for this
lack of effect on mortality may be due to the small sample size and short follow-up period [13]. Another
interesting study tried to determine the role of 25(OH)D levels on the clinical outcomes of HF patients
undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) [34]. They concluded that serum calciferol levels less
than 24.12 ng/ml has a significant impact on heart failure patients [34]. Deficient patients were more likely
to show a lack of response to CRT and deficiency also predicts long-term mortality in these patients. This
evidence convinced that the monitoring of vitamin D levels in HF patients could be of greater clinical
Published via California Institute of

significance by identifying high-risk groups. Similarly, another clinical trial also tried to demonstrate a
response to CRT in HF patients with vitamin D deficiency [35]. Although the sample size was small, their
results indicate that adequate levels of cholecalciferol can significantly improve the functional capacity of
HF patients after undergoing CRT [35]. To understand its effects better, a key study from 2019 studied the
pattern of mortality rates and the risk of hospitalizations in HF patients with respect to vitamin D status
[36]. Findings from this study demonstrated a significant increase in rates of cardiovascular hospitalizations,
but no association was found in terms of mortality, ejection fraction, and diastolic dysfunction [36]. Another
longitudinal study examined the reason for increased hospitalizations and mortality rates in vitamin Ddeficient HF patients [37]. Data from this study revealed no association with the risk of hospitalizations,
however, they found significantly higher mortality in deficient patients when compared to non-deficient
subjects [37]. This study also stated that a 2.72-fold increase in serum 25(OH)D levels can lower mortality by
14% [37]. A more interesting study attempted to assess the risk of readmission and infection rates after left
ventricular assist device (LVAD) in HF patients with vitamin D deficiency [38]. They concluded that low
vitamin D levels were independently associated with a higher risk of readmission and driveline infection risk
[38]. Similarly, a cohort study investigated the relationship between serum vitamin D and the incidence of
hospitalization in heart failure patients [39]. A greater risk of hospitalization was observed in deficient
patients with a hazard ratio of 1.61 when compared to those with normal levels [39].
Due to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in elderly patients, Porto et al. conducted a unique
randomized clinical trial that evaluated the risk of heart failure in the elderly population [40]. A significant
association was found between low levels of 25(OH)D and incidence of heart failure, this was significant
especially in male patients and obese subjects. The higher incidence of heart failure in male subjects was
strongly supported by the fact that vitamin D is positively associated with testosterone levels [41].
Testosterone, in turn, also has a protective effect on the myocardium, decreasing the risk of heart failure
[42]. Thus, the combined effect of decreased testosterone levels and increased prevalence of vitamin
D deficiency in elderly males led to a higher risk of HF [43]. In the same way, obese people are more prone to
vitamin D deficiency, both obesity and vitamin D deficiency were independent risk factors for heart failure
[44]. Another well-organized RCT from 2016 examined the role of vitamin D in predicting the rate of
hospitalizations and mortality in HF patients [45]. This study finally concluded vitamin D as an independent
predictor of hospitalizations and the risk of mortality [45]. The limitations of this study were the small
sample size and small control group. Similar results were found by a study conducted by Liu et al. in 2012 and
concluded that inadequate serum calciferol levels have a higher risk of mortality not only in HF patients but
also in all cardiovascular diseases [46]. In another major study, vitamin D was found to be an independent
factor in predicting survival rates in HF patients [19]. In this study, they evaluated the role of oral D3
supplementation and its effects on mortality. The treatment group was followed for 518 days and stated that
vitamin D supplements improved the survival rates in these patients [19], thus highlighting the importance
of including vitamin D therapy in the standard care of heart failures. Coming to the prognostic role of
vitamin D in HF patients, a study by Liu et al. suggested that a low vitamin D concentration is associated
with poor prognosis [47]. They also found high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and increased renin activity in
patients with low serum 25(OH)D [47]. Therefore, we can consider high levels of CRP and increased plasma
renin activity as poor prognostic factors in HF patients. Table 2 summarizes studies that have evaluated the
clinical outcomes in HF patients with vitamin D deficiency.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our current review evaluated the role of vitamin D supplementation in CHF patients and
explained various consequences of low serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol in these patients. No significant
difference was noticed with daily supplementation of vitamin D and similar results were observed with
high-dose monthly or weekly supplements. We also found that deficiency of vitamin D is associated with
increased risk of hospitalizations, mortality, and poor clinical outcomes. However, residual confounding
lifestyle factors could also explain this inverse association. Possible long-term benefits from vitamin D
supplementation cannot be excluded. To demonstrate effects on mortality and hospitalization more
efficiently we require clinical trials with larger sample sizes along with longer follow-up durations.
Therefore, further studies are essential in the future to comment on optimal dosing, frequency, and ideal
serum target levels to improve outcomes in HF patients.
