Abstract An intrahepatic arterioportal fistula is a rare
cause of portal hypertension and variceal bleeding. We
report on a patient with an intrahepatic arterioportal fistula
following liver biopsy who was successfully treated by
hepatectomy after unsuccessful arterial embolization. We
also review the literature on symptomatic intrahepatic
arterioportal fistulas after liver biopsy. A 48-year-old male
with bleeding gastric varices and hepatitis B virus-associated liver cirrhosis was transferred to our hospital; this
patient previously underwent percutaneous liver biopsies 3
and 6 years ago. Abdominal examination revealed a bruit
over the liver, tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and
splenomegaly. Ultrasonographic examination, computed
tomography, and angiography confirmed an arterioportal
fistula between the right hepatic artery and the right portal
vein with portal hypertension. After admission, the patient
suffered a large hematemesis and developed shock. He
was treated with emergency transarterial embolization
using microcoils. Since some collateral vessels bypassed
the obstructive coils and still fed the fistulous area,
embolization was performed again. Despite the second
embolization, the collateral vessels could not be completely controlled. Radical treatment involving resection
of his right hepatic lobe was performed. For nearly
6 years postoperatively, this patient has had no further
episodes of variceal bleeding.

Introduction
It is not surprising that intrahepatic arterioportal fistula
(APF) occurs following interventional procedures to the
liver. Most small, peripheral APFs caused by liver biopsy
are usually asymptomatic and generally thrombose within
1 month [1]; however, an APF is a rare cause of portal
hypertension and gastric variceal bleeding.
At present, radiologic intervention is the treatment of
first choice for most APFs, and surgery is needed only
rarely. We report on a patient with APF following liver
biopsy who was successfully treated by hepatectomy after
unsuccessful arterial embolization. We also review the
literature about symptomatic APFs after liver biopsy.
Case report
A 48-year-old male was admitted to a local hospital complaining of hematemesis and melena. The patient was
diagnosed as having bleeding gastric varices and hepatitis
B virus-associated liver cirrhosis. The gastric varices were
obliterated by an injection of isobutyl 2-cyanoacrylate and
ethanol. After clinical stabilization, he was transferred to
our hospital for further treatment.

At 42 and 45 years of age, this patient underwent percutaneous liver biopsies from the right anterosuperior area
using a Tru-cut needle under ultrasound guidance before
interferon therapy; however, no complications were
encountered during the procedures. He had been regularly
followed up at another regional clinic after interferon
therapy but no abnormal findings were detected on ultrasonographic examination of the liver.
At the time of admission to our hospital he was not
icteric, had a pulse rate of 72/min, and was normotensive
(BP 116/66 mmHg). Abdominal examination revealed a
bruit over the liver, tenderness in the right upper quadrant,
and splenomegaly. Laboratory examination showed
hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, platelets 7.5 9 104
/lL, serum
albumin 3.8 g/dL, total serum bilirubin 0.69 mg/dL,
aspartate aminotransferase 30 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 25 IU/L, prothrombin time 11.2 s (control 10.5 s),
and a-fetoprotein in the normal range. Endoscopy showed
severe esophagogastric varices (Li, F2, Cw, RC0, Lg-f, F3,
Cb, RC2) (Fig. 1).
Ultrasonographic examination of the liver revealed a
dilated tubular vascular structure with a diameter of 17 mm
in the right anterosuperior area (Fig. 2a) and a dilated right
hepatic artery.
Color Doppler ultrasound of the tubular vascular lesion
demonstrated an area of color cloud with turbulence
(Fig. 2b) and localized high velocity blood flow; the
direction of the flow in the portal vein was hepatofugal
(Fig. 2c).
A triphasic computed tomography (CT) scan showed an
enlarged right hepatic artery and pooling of contrast
material in the right anterosuperior area of the liver. The
pooling image had pronounced enhancement in the arterial
phase (Fig. 3). The diagnosis of an intrahepatic APF was
suggested.
Angiography confirmed an APF between the right
hepatic artery and the right portal vein (Fig. 4a), with
immediate retrograde filling of the portal vein and reflux to
the left gastric vein, as well as extensive collateral
circulation through the esophagogastric and perisplenic
vascular beds (Fig. 4b).
On the 23rd day after admission, the patient suffered a
large hematemesis and developed shock. He was treated
with blood transfusions and a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube.
Since the right hepatic fistula feeder seemed rather narrow,
emergency coil embolization was performed with 19
fibered platinum microcoils (VortX, Boston Scientific,
Natick, MA, USA). Control hepatic arteriography at the
end of the procedure showed complete occlusion of the
distal right hepatic artery (Fig. 4c) and hepatopetal flow in
the portal vein.
When the patient was reviewed 29 days later, he was
asymptomatic, and endoscopy revealed less prominent
esophagogastric varices. The second angiography showed
revascularization of the APF. Since some collateral vessels
from the right and left hepatic arteries bypassed the
obstructive coils and still fed the fistulous area (Fig. 4d),
transarterial embolization was performed again with 9
fibered platinum microcoils. Despite the second embolization, the collateral vessels could not be controlled completely. After the second procedure, color Doppler
ultrasound of the left portal vein demonstrated hepatopetal
flow, but the direction of the flow in the right portal vein
was hepatofugal.
Since the remaining APF had a risk of variceal bleeding,
the patient underwent an uncomplicated resection of his
right hepatic lobe to remove the fistula shortly thereafter.
Surgical findings of the liver showed mild blunt edge,
slight irregular surface, atrophic right lobe and enlarged
left lobe. Because the general condition of the patient
worsened due to repeated hematemesis and treatments,
portal vein pressure was not measured before and after
surgery.
An endoscopy performed 7 months postoperatively
showed the esophageal varices had disappeared and the
gastric varices (Lg-f, F1, Cw, RC0) had improved (Fig. 5).
For nearly 6 years postoperatively, this patient has had no
further episodes of variceal bleeding.

Discussion
Sachs [2], in 1892, was the first to report an intrahepatic
APF which had been found at autopsy in a patient who died
of hemorrhage from esophageal varices. APFs have been
said to result from congenital arteriovenous malformation,
ruptured hepatic aneurysm, trauma, iatrogenic causes, liver
cirrhosis, or liver tumor. Preger [3] first described an APF
occurring after liver biopsy in 1967.
APFs probably develop following liver biopsy when the
biopsy needle causes a branch of the high-pressure hepatic
artery and a branch of the low-pressure portal vein to
communicate [4]. The frequency of APFs following liver
biopsy was reported to be 5.4% by Okuda et al. [5] when
they performed hepatic arteriography within 4 weeks of the
procedure. Most of these APFs were small in size and
closed spontaneously; none of these shunts caused portal
hypertension. In rare cases, as in the present patient, the
fistula grows in size and becomes clinically symptomatic
with portal hypertension.
We searched PubMed and the Igaku-chuou-zassi (Japana Centra Reveuo Medicina) database (1983–2010)
using keywords ‘arterioportal fistula’, ‘arteriovenous fistula’ and ‘liver biopsy’ for reports documenting APFs
following liver biopsy. From among the English language
reports, clinically symptomatic cases following percutaneous liver biopsy were selected (Table 1) [4, 6–29]. A
case observed in our unit was also added to the review.
The common manifestations of intrahepatic APFs
include gastrointestinal bleeding (33%), ascites (26%),
congestive heart failure (4.5%), and diarrhea (4.5%) [30].
In the present review of cases after percutaneous liver

biopsy, gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 14 of 30 cases
(47%), with ascites in 10 of 30 cases (33%). While most
documented cases of gastrointestinal bleeding occurred
with esophageal varices, this is the first report of gastric
variceal bleeding caused by APF following percutaneous
liver biopsy. Intrahepatic APF, although rare, should be
kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses when there
are cirrhotic bleeding varices with a past history of liver

biopsy. On physical examination, the presence of an
abdominal bruit or thrill is often an important clue [1]. In
the present review, a bruit was detected in 7 of 30 cases
(23%).
Since the biopsy needle, specimen, site, and procedure
were not stated in detail in most case reports, the trends
about them are unclear; as can be seen in Table1, some
important factors are missing. However, some reports
demonstrated that biopsy was performed without ultrasonography, and biopsy specimen revealed the structure of
vessels. For safety, liver biopsy under ultrasonography
would be desirable [31]. The use of ultrasound-guided
needle biopsy can avoid laceration of vessels and formation
of APFs. Examination of puncture site by Color Doppler
ultrasound is useful in addition to B-mode ultrasound before
the procedure [32]. In the present review of cases, liver
transplant recipients were shown in 10 of 30 cases (33%).
Needle biopsy is a useful and indispensable procedure for
assessment and diagnosis of liver damage in patients after
liver transplantation as well as other liver diseases.
It has been reported that the interval between the formation of an APF and its recognition can range from hours
to 42 years [33]. In the present review, the interval was
from 1 h to 43 years. Careful long-term follow-up is recommended for patients after liver biopsy.
Recently, transarterial embolization has been attempted
as the first-choice treatment because of its low invasiveness
and success in some cases. Some unsuccessful cases following transarterial embolization have been reported. In
the unsuccessful cases, a surgical procedure, such as ligation of the hepatic artery, a mesocaval or portocaval shunt,
or hepatic resection, was chosen. To avoid the risk of
hepatic infarction in the present case, radical treatment
involving right hepatic lobe resection was performed
because of the two failed attempts to close the fistula by
transarterial embolization. Since the recurrence rate after
transarterial embolization for intrahepatic APFs is unclear,
close long-term observation is needed after treatment.
