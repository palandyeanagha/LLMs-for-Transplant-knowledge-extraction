Abstract
Background and aims Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is ongoing. Except for lung injury, it is possible that 
COVID-19 patients develop liver injury. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the incidence, 
risk factors, and prognosis of abnormal liver biochemical tests in COVID-19 patients.
Methods PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wanfang databases were searched. The incidence of abnormal liver biochemical tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and 
albumin (ALB), was pooled. Risk ratio (RR) was calculated to explore the association of abnormal liver biochemical tests 
with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Results Forty-fve studies were included. The pooled incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission 
and during hospitalization was 27.2% and 36%, respectively. Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed 
at admission, abnormal ALB was the most common, followed by GGT, AST, ALT, TBIL, and ALP (39.8%, 35.8%, 21.8%, 
20.4%, 8.8%, and 4.7%). Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators observed during hospitalization, abnormal ALT 
was more common than AST and TBIL (38.4%, 28.1%, and 23.2%). Severe and/or critical patients had a signifcantly higher 
pooled incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators at admission than mild and/or moderate patients. Non-survivors 
had a signifcantly higher incidence of abnormal liver biochemical indicators than survivors (RR=1.34, p=0.04).
Conclusions Abnormal liver biochemical tests are common in COVID-19 patients. Liver biochemical indicators are closely 
related to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Until May 6, 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
has posed a serious threat to global public health with a 
total of 3,272,202 confrmed cases and 230,104 deaths 
documented in 212 countries [1]. Its pathogen is named the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) [2]. Except for fever, cough, and dyspnea as the 
major clinical presentations [3], COVID-19 patients may 
also develop diferent degrees of liver injury [4, 5]. The 
major mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 patients 
is thought to be the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [6], which is 
highly expressed in bile duct cells [7], and then damages 
bile duct cells, thereby resulting in abnormal liver biochemical tests refected by elevated alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) [8]. In 
addition, liver injury in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be 
caused by either systemic infammation response or drug 
hepatotoxicity, which is supported by the frst autopsy 
pathological analysis of a COVID-19 patient showing 
moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and 
portal activity in the liver tissue [9]. Multiple organ failure 
(MOF) is another possible cause of liver injury in COVID19 patients, as SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) and MOF, thereby leading to 
hepatic ischemia, which could be worsened by the use of 
vasopressor medications, and hypoxia reperfusion injury 
in critically ill patients [10, 11]. Indeed, evidence also 
suggested that critically ill patients have a higher proportion of liver enzyme abnormality than patients with mild 
disease [8].
It is important for physicians, especially hepatologists, to 
appreciate the epidemiology and potential risk of liver injury 
in COVID-19 patients [12, 13]. However, the data regarding 
abnormal liver biochemical tests in COVID-19 patients are 
often heterogeneous among studies, and assessing the risk 
of liver injury in such patients remains challenging. In this 
study, we have systematically collected the current evidence 
with two major objectives: (1) to achieve more generalizable 
conclusions regarding the incidence of abnormal liver biochemical tests in COVID-19 patients; and (2) to explore the 
relationships of abnormal liver biochemical indicators with 
the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Methods
This meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) Statement and the Meta-analysis Of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. The MOOSE and PRISMA checklists are shown in 
the Supplementary Materials.
Search strategy
All published literature which reported liver biochemical 
tests in COVID-19 patients were identifed via the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, and Wanfang databases. 
The search terms were (“2019 novel coronavirus-infected 
pneumonia” OR “COVID-19” OR “2019 novel coronavirus” 
OR “2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia” OR “severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” OR “SARS-CoV-2” 
OR “novel coronavirus pneumonia”) AND (“liver” OR 
“hepatic”). The last retrieval date was April 27, 2020.
Study selection
There was neither publication language nor publication status restriction. All eligible studies reported the incidence 
and/or risk factors of abnormal liver biochemical tests in 
COVID-19 patients. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 
duplicates; (2) case reports, reviews or meta-analyses, guidelines, consensus, experimental or animal studies, comments 
or letters, notes, and correspondences; (3) irrelevant papers; 
(4) absence of detailed data; (5) duplicate study population.
Data extraction
Data extraction was performed by 2 investigators. The following data were extracted from the included studies: the 
frst author, publication year, region, source of cases, enrollment period, cases with COVID-19, age, gender, history of 
pre-existing liver diseases, treatments, clinical outcomes, 
and liver biochemical tests at admission or during hospitalization. Liver biochemical indicators analyzed included 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), ALP, GGT, total bilirubin (TBIL), and albumin 
(ALB).
Study quality
The quality of cohort studies was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), which includes study selection 
(four items), comparability (two items), and exposure/outcome (three items). The highest score is 9 points, and a score 
of more than 6 points is considered high quality.
Defnitions
The definition regarding the severity of COVID-19 
patients was inconsistent among these included studies. 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:621–637 623
1 3
Among them, 36 studies employed the defnitions from the 
Chinese practice guidelines regarding diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia, in which patients 
were divided into four subtypes (mild, moderate, severe, 
and critical); 4 studies employed the defnitions from the 
American Thoracic Society guidelines, in which patients 
were categorized into severe and non-severe types; and the 
remaining 5 studies did not clearly report the defnition 
regarding the severity of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, as 
for the present systematic review, the severity of COVID19 patients was mainly dependent upon the defnitions 
from each individual study.
The time when liver biochemical indicators were measured during hospitalization was not strictly defned in the 
present systematic review, because it was not strictly or 
consistently defned among these included studies. Generally, liver biochemical indicators at admission refer 
to those measured at admission or within 24  h after 
admission; and liver biochemical indicators during hospitalization refer to those measured at any time during 
hospitalization.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using StatsDirect 
statistical software version 2.8.0 (StatsDirect Ltd., Sale, 
Cheshire, UK), STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp., College 
Station, Texas, USA), and Review Manager software version 
5.3 (Cochrane collaboration, the Nordic Cochrane Centre, 
Copenhagen, Denmark). First, the incidence of abnormal 
liver biochemical tests from each study were pooled, and 
the pooled proportion with 95% confdence interval (CI) was 
calculated. Second, we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) or 
mean diferences (MDs) with 95% CIs. The meta-analyses 
were performed by using a random-efect model. Heterogeneity among the studies was also assessed. I
2
 >50% and/
or p<0.1 were considered to have statistically signifcant 
heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed with Egger test. 
p<0.1 was considered as a statistically signifcant publication bias. Subgroup analyses were performed according to 
the source of cases (single-center versus multiple-center), 
sample size (≥100 versus<100), NOS (≥7 versus<7), 
proportion of male (≥50% versus<50%), and proportion 
of patients with pre-existing liver disease (≥ 10% versus<10%). Meta-regression analyses employed the covariates that were the same as the strata of subgroup analyses, 
including the source of cases, sample size, NOS, proportion 
of male, and proportion of patients with pre-existing liver 
disease. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by sequentially 
excluding one study at a time. These analyses were performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity among 
studies.
Results
Study selection
Overall, 2281 papers were identifed via the 6 databases, 
and 11 papers were identifed via a manual search. Finally, 
45 studies were included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1) 
[14–58].
Study characteristics
Characteristics of the included studies are summarized 
in Table 1. Among them, 30 studies [15, 16, 19, 21, 23, 
25–30, 33–37, 39–41,43–46, 49, 50, 52–56] were formally 
published as full texts, 9 studies [18, 24, 31, 32, 38, 42, 47, 
48, 51] were published in press, and the remaining 6 studies [14, 17, 20, 22, 57, 58] were preprinted. The number 
of COVID-19 patients ranged from 18 to 1099 among 
these included studies. Nearly all of these included studies 
(44/45) were conducted in China, and the remaining one 
in Singapore; 33 [14–16, 18, 20–22, 24–26, 28–35, 38, 39, 
41, 43–47, 49–52, 54, 56, 58] and 12 studies [17, 19, 23, 
27, 36, 37, 40, 42, 48, 53, 55, 57] were single-center and 
multi-center studies, respectively. Treatment and clinical 
outcomes of COVID-19 patients are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
Study quality
The NOS score ranged between 3 and 8 points. Eight studies [15, 16, 21, 23, 29, 36, 40, 50] were considered to be 
of high quality (Supplementary Table 2).

Meta‑regression analyses
The results of meta-regression analyses are summarized in 
Supplementary Table 4. As for any abnormal liver biochemical indicator observed at admission, meta-regression analyses indicated that the source of cases (p=0.000) might be 
a potential source of heterogeneity. As for abnormal ALT

that the sample size (p=0.019) might be the potential source 
of heterogeneity. As for any abnormal liver biochemical 
indicator observed during hospitalization, meta-regression 
analyses indicated that the proportion of patients with preexisting liver disease (p=0.028) might be a potential source 
of heterogeneity. However, no source of heterogeneity could 
be identifed for other liver biochemical indicators observed 
at admission or during hospitalization.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses did not identify any study as the potential source of heterogeneity.

Risk factors
Non‑severe versus severe according to the American 
Thoracic Society guideline
Two studies [17, 19] compared the incidence of abnormal ALT, AST, and TBIL at admission between severe 
and non-severe patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated that 
severe patients had a significantly higher incidence of 
abnormal AST at admission (RR=2.91, 95% CI 1.36–6.22; 
p=0.006). The incidence of abnormal ALT (RR=2.32, 
95% CI 0.78–6.88; p=0.13) and TBIL (RR=1.95, 95% CI 
0.68–5.58; p=0.21) at admission were not signifcantly different between severe and non-severe patients.
Mild and moderate versus severe and critical according 
to the Chinese practice guideline
Only one study [38] compared the incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission between mild 
and moderate patients versus severe and critical patients, 
and demonstrated that severe and critical patients had a signifcantly higher incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission (RR=2.78, 95% CI 1.28–6.06; 
p=0.01). Three studies [49, 51, 55] compared the incidence 
of abnormal ALT at admission between mild and moderate patients versus severe and critical patients, and demonstrated that severe and critical patients had a signifcantly 
higher incidence of abnormal ALT at admission (RR=3.03, 
95% CI 1.76–5.23; p<0.0001). Four studies [35, 49, 51, 
55] compared the incidence of abnormal AST at admission between mild and moderate patients versus severe and 
critical patients, and demonstrated that severe and critical 
patients had a signifcantly higher incidence of abnormal 
AST (RR=3.84, 95% CI 2.53–5.82; p<0.00001) at admission. Two studies [49, 51] compared the incidence of abnormal TBIL at admission between mild and moderate patients 
versus severe and critical patients, and demonstrated that 
severe and critical patients had a signifcantly higher incidence of abnormal TBIL at admission (RR=3.16, 95% CI 
1.24–8.09; p=0.02).
Eight studies [16, 20, 30, 35, 49, 51, 55, 57] compared the 
ALT level at admission between mild and moderate patients 
versus severe and critical patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated that ALT level was signifcantly higher in severe 
and critical patients than in mild and moderate patients 
(MD=7.64, 95% CI 1.94–13.35; p=0.009).
Seven studies [16, 20, 30, 35, 49, 51, 55] compared the 
AST level at admission between mild and moderate patients 
versus severe and critical patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated that AST level was signifcantly higher in severe 
and critical patients than in mild and moderate patients 
(MD = 13.20, 95% CI 7.57–18.82; p < 0.00001). Seven 
studies [20, 30, 35, 49, 51, 55, 57] compared the TBIL level 
at admission between mild and moderate patients versus 
severe and critical patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated 
that TBIL level was lower in severe and critical patients 
than in mild and moderate patients (MD = − 0.22, 95% 
CI −5.08 to 4.63; p=0.93). Five studies [16, 30, 35, 55, 
57] compared the ALB level at admission between mild 
and moderate patients versus severe and critical patients. 
Meta-analyses demonstrated that ALB level was signifcantly lower in severe and critical patients than in mild and 
moderate patients (MD=−4.84, 95% CI −6.68 to −3.00; 
p<0.00001).
Moderate versus severe and critical according 
to the Chinese practice guideline
Only one study [18] compared the incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission between moderate patients versus severe and critical patients, and demonstrated that severe and critical patients had a signifcantly 
higher incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission (RR=1.91, 95% CI 1.17–3.1; p=0.009).
Three studies [15, 34, 52] compared the ALT, AST, TBIL 
and ALB levels at admission between moderate patients and 
severe and critical patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated 
that the ALT (MD=9.76, 95% CI 4.64–14.89; p=0.0002), 
AST (MD=6.32, 95% CI 2.90–9.74; p=0.0003) and TBIL 
(MD=3.14, 95% CI 1.14–5.14; p=0.002) levels were signifcantly higher in severe and critical patients than in moderate 
patients, and the ALB level was signifcantly lower in severe 
and critical patients (MD=−7.30, 95% CI −8.69 to −5.90; 
p<0.00001).
Moderate versus severe according to the Chinese practice 
guideline
Five studies [26, 28, 29, 45, 54] compared the ALT and AST 
levels at admission between moderate and severe patients. 
Meta-analyses demonstrated that the ALT (MD=11.99, 95% 
CI −3.59 to 27.57; p=0.13) and AST (MD=10.30, 95% CI 
0.11–20.49; p=0.05) levels were higher in severe patients than 
in moderate patients. Three studies [26, 28, 54] compared the 
ALB level at admission between moderate and severe patients. 
Meta-analyses demonstrated that ALB level was signifcantly 
lower in severe patients than in moderate patients (MD=-4.62, 
95% CI −8.12 to −1.13; p=0.01). Two studies [26, 45] compared the TBIL level at admission between moderate and 
severe patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated that the TBIL 
level was lower in severe patients than in moderate patients 
(MD=−0.12, 95% CI −0.87 to 0.62; p=0.75).

At admission versus during hospitalization
Two studies [32, 47] compared the ALT level detected at 
admission versus during hospitalization, and demonstrated that 
the ALT level detected during hospitalization was signifcantly 
higher than that obtained at admission (MD=20.30, 95% CI 
16.51–24.06; p<0.00001).
The frst week after admission versus the second week 
after admission
Only one study [38] compared the ALT level at the frst week 
after admission versus the second week after admission, and 
demonstrated that ALT level detected at the second week after 
admission was signifcantly higher than that detected at the frst 
week after admission (MD=130.75, 95% CI 116.14–145.36; 
p<0.00001).
Number of drug products combined
Only one study [38] compared the proportion of drug products≥3 between patients with liver injury and those with 
normal liver biochemistry, and demonstrated that the proportion of drug products≥3 was signifcantly higher in patients 
with liver injury than in those with normal liver biochemistry 
(RR=9.00, 95% CI 1.28–63.26; p=0.03).
Efect of liver biochemical indicators on prognosis 
of COVID‑19 patients
Survivors versus non‑survivors
Three studies [43, 44, 50] compared the incidence of any 
abnormal liver biochemical indicator between survivors 
versus non-survivors. Meta-analyses demonstrated that 
non-survivors had a signifcantly higher incidence of any 
abnormal liver biochemical indicator (RR=1.34, 95% CI 
1.02–1.77; p=0.04).
With versus without composite endpoint
Two studies [19, 50] compared the incidence of abnormal 
ALT and AST between patients who achieved the composite 
endpoint versus those who did not achieve the composite 
endpoint. Both of them employed the same composite endpoint defned as admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation, or death. Meta-analyses demonstrated that patients who 
achieved the composite endpoint had a signifcantly higher 
incidence of abnormal ALT (RR=1.96, 95% CI 1.54–2.49; 
p < 0.00001) and AST (RR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.81–2.92; 
p<0.00001).
Discussion
Our study suggested that the pooled incidence of any abnormal liver biochemical indicator detected during hospitalization seemed to be higher than that detected at admission 
(36% versus 27.2%). Except for the disease progression of 
COVID-19 during hospitalization, this might be partly due 
to the toxicity of drugs used during hospitalization. Patients 
are often given empirical antiviral therapy for COVID-19 
after admission, of which some can be potentially hepatotoxic. At the time of this writing, recent studies have 
reported that lopinavir might be potentially efective against 
SARS-CoV-2 [59], but lopinavir/ritonavir is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P 450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzymes in the 
liver, which is likely to cause elevated serum transaminases 
[60]. In addition, some patients may be treated with antipyretic agents during hospitalization, of which most contain 
acetaminophen that can be hepatotoxic in high doses and/or 
combination with other drugs and even cause liver failure 
[61].
Among the abnormal liver biochemical indicators 
observed at admission, abnormal ALB (39.8%) was the most 
frequent, followed by abnormal GGT (35.8%), AST (21.8%), 
ALT (20.4%), TBIL (8.8%), and ALP (4.7%). Decreased 
ALB level is usually considered to indicate that the synthetic 
function of the liver be damaged to some extent. However, a 
decline of ALB level may be related to the disease severity 
of COVID-19, as COVID-19 can cause pulmonary exudation, thereby leading to abnormal ALB distribution, and an 
insufcient intake of nutrients or impairment of normal utilization/metabolism of nutrients may also decrease the ALB 
level in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 is prone to damage bile duct cells where the ACE2 is highly expressed [7]. 
Thus, abnormal GGT and ALP levels should have been more 
common. However, in the settings of liver injury, the de-differentiation and proliferation of ACE2-expressing bile duct 
epithelial cells are involved in liver tissue repair, and some 
newborn hepatocytes retain the characteristics of ACE2 
expression and may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 [62], 
thereby afecting hepatocytes and presenting with abnormal 
AST and ALT levels. Both ALP and GGT are considered 
as cholangiocyte-related enzymes, but the pooled incidence 
of abnormal ALP seems to be remarkably higher than that 
of abnormal GGT (35.8% versus 4.7%). This counter-intuitive phenomenon may be attributed to a diference in the 
distribution of ALP and GGT. ALP is present in bile duct, 
bone, intestine, kidney, and placenta, while GGT is widely 
distributed in the cell membranes of many tissues, such as 
bile duct, kidney, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, heart, brain, 
and seminal vesicle. Thus, GGT, as an indicator of bile duct 
injury, may be less sensitive than ALP.

Severe and critical COVID-19 patients and non-survivors 
are more prone to have abnormal liver biochemistry. This 
fnding might be explained by several points, as follows. 
First, infammatory factor storm is suspected to be associated with abnormal liver biochemistry in severe and critical 
COVID-19 patients. It has been recognized that the occurrence of MOF is mainly associated with the sudden initiation of an infammatory storm in the critically ill patients 
[63]. The release of numerous inflammatory cytokines 
induces ARDS and systemic infammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and subsequently causes hypoxia in the body, 
thereby leading to an injury in lung, liver, myocardium, and 
kidney. This may be aggravated by the use of vasopressor 
drugs to maintain blood pressure in an ICU setting. Second, 
hepatic ischemia and hypoxia reperfusion dysfunction may 
be one of the main mechanisms of liver injury in severe 
and critical COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients often 
have varied degrees of hypoxemia, of whom more than 40% 
need to receive oxygen therapy [19]. COVID-19-related 
complications include ARDS, SIRS, and MOF, which may 
cause hepatic ischemia and hypoxia reperfusion dysfunction. Both in vivo and in vitro models of liver ischemia and 
hypoxia suggested that liver cell death and infammatory cell 
infltration could be caused by ischemia and hypoxia [11]. 
Meanwhile, oxygen reduction and lipid accumulation in liver 
tissue during shock and hypoxic conditions may further promote the release of multiple infammatory factors and then 
lead to liver injury [64]. Third, drug toxicity may contribute 
to liver damage in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. 
Compared with patients experiencing a mild or moderate 
clinical course, severe and critical patients require longer 
duration of antiviral therapy and multiple drugs combined. 
Our fndings found that the number of drugs products≥3 
might be related to liver injury. Additionally, it has been 
reported that antiviral medications (lopinavir/ritonavir, 
arbidol, hydroxychloroquine), antipyretics (acetaminophen), 
antibiotics (macrolides, quinolones), and traditional Chinese 
medicine can cause liver damage [60, 65–67]. Also, some 
critical patients would be treated with steroids, which are 
mainly metabolized in the liver and could cause mild hepatotoxicity. In the setting of steroids combined with HIV protease inhibitors (such as lopinavir), the risk of liver damage 
could be further increased [68]. Notably, at the beginning 
of the COVID-19 crisis, in the complete absence of known 
antiviral/disease modulating medications, many drugs and 
combinations of drugs, which would have been previously 
considered for use only in a controlled experimental setting, 
may have been used empirically in clinical practice. Fourth, 
our subgroup analysis suggested that the incidence of any 
abnormal liver biochemical indicator at admission seemed 
to be higher in the subgroup where the proportion of preexisting liver disease was≥10% than in the subgroup where 
the proportion of re-existing liver disease was<10%. This 
fnding suggests that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing 
liver diseases may be more prone to have abnormal liver 
biochemical indicators and that monitoring liver function 
should be more intensive in such patients. Notably, this may 
not be a direct consequence of pre-existing liver diseases, 
but related to the dysfunction of innate immune response 
against the virus [69].
Our study has several limitations. First, the heterogeneity remained statistically signifcant in most of our metaanalyses. Despite this, we performed subgroup analyses, 
meta-regression analyses, and sensitivity analyses, but the 
potential source of heterogeneity could not be clearly identifed. Indeed, among the proportion meta-analyses, a statistically signifcant heterogeneity is often unavoidable [70, 5]. 
Second, the follow-up duration was diferent among these 
included studies. Third, all but one included study was from 
China and even that study was also from its neighboring 
country. Thus, the present fndings might be more appropriate for the Chinese population or Asian population and it 
remains to be seen whether our fndings can be generalized 
to European or American populations. In the future, it will 
be interesting to conduct a similar systematic review with 
papers that are likely to be forthcoming from Europe and 
America. However, at the time of writing this meta-analysis, 
the papers from Europe and America have yet to appear in 
the literature. Fourth, most of these included studies were 
retrospective, which might cause a recall bias, especially 
about data entry. Fifth, abnormal liver biochemical test, 
rather than liver injury, was assessed, because the defnition of liver injury was unclear or inconsistent among these 
included studies.
In conclusion, abnormal liver biochemistry, primarily 
characterized as decreased ALB and elevated GGT, AST, 
and ALT, is common in COVID-19 patients. Abnormal liver 
biochemical indicators are closely related to the severity and 
prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, a higher incidence of abnormal liver biochemistry in COVID-19 patients 
during hospitalization warrants that liver biochemical tests 
should be closely monitored and timely measures should be 
taken. In future, it is necessary to extrapolate these fndings 
to patients who have advanced chronic liver diseases or liver 
cirrhosis, because there is a potential chance for co-incidental COVID-19 infection to result in hepatic decompensation 
in patients with little hepatic reserve.
