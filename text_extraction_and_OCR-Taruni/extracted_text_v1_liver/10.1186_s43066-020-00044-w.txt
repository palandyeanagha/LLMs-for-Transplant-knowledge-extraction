Abstract
Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as the most common liver disease in the twentyfirst century, and a condition leaving individuals at increased risk of extra-hepatic morbidity. Liver biopsy has long been
regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis and prognostication of patients with NAFLD. However, due to its invasive
nature and potential complications (e.g., bleeding), other methods for non-invasive laboratory and radiological
assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD have evolved and include scores such as AST/Platelet Ratio Index
(APRI), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and fatty liver index (FLI), in addition to radiological methods
such as transient elastography (TE), which is a well-validated non-invasive ultrasound-based technique for assessment
of hepatic fibrosis. Recently, novel development of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in TE allowed simultaneous
assessment of hepatic steatosis. This provided a chance to assess both hepatic fibrosis and steatosis in the same setting
and without any unwanted complications. This study aimed at assessing the role of TE and CAP versus other noninvasive assessment scores for liver fibrosis and steatosis in patients with NAFLD.
Results: This study included 90 patients diagnosed with NAFLD based on abdominal ultrasonography, body mass
index, and serum liver enzymes. All patients were assessed with TE and non-invasive scores (APRI score, FIB-4 score,
NFS, and FLI). There was a highly significant positive correlation between fibrosis and steatosis grades assessed by TE
and other non-invasive respective scores. Both TE and CAP achieved acceptable sensitivity and specificity compared to
other non-invasive assessment methods.
Conclusions: TE with CAP can be used as a screening method for patients suspected with NAFLD or patients without a
clear indication for liver biopsy. CAP allows a non-invasive method of assessment of hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD.

Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is regarded as
the most common liver disease in the twenty-first century [1], a growing risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading indication for liver transplantation
[2], and a condition leaving individuals at increased risk
of extra-hepatic morbidity and mortality [3].
Over the past 2 decades, NAFLD has grown from a relatively unknown disease to the most common cause of
chronic liver disease in the world. In fact, 25% of the
world’s population is currently thought to have NAFLD
[4]. The clinical spectrum of NAFLD ranges from a relatively benign fatty infiltration to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to liver cirrhosis, liver cell
failure, or HCC [5]. NAFLD is also associated with an increased risk of mortality due to liver disease and cardiovascular disease. The distinction of different forms of
NAFLD is important in the clinical management of patients due to very different prognoses. Furthermore, liver
fibrosis has emerged as the strongest predictor of longterm outcomes in patients with NAFLD [6].
The evaluation of liver fibrosis severity has become the
main issue to verify the prognosis of NAFLD patients,
and liver biopsy has long been regarded as the gold
standard in this aspect. However, histological interpretation of liver biopsy is subject to micro-inhomogeneity,
sampling errors, presence of un-fragmented cores, and
observer variability among pathologists. Moreover, the
invasive nature of this procedure in addition to its potential life-threatening complications such as bleeding,
hematoma, and pain necessitated the identification of alternative non-invasive tools to replace liver biopsy in
diagnosis and prognostication of NAFLD patients [7].
Non-invasive laboratory and radiological assessment
methods for hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in NAFLD
have evolved during the past decade, and these methods
may be able to overcome the limitations of liver biopsy.
These methods include scores such as AST/platelet ratio
index (APRI) score, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score, NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), and fatty liver index (FLI), in
addition to radiological methods such as transient elastography (TE), which is an ultrasound-based technique
and considered as one of the most extensively used and
well-validated non-invasive methods for assessment of
hepatic fibrosis [8].
Presently, non-invasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis
may be conducted using both combined biochemical
markers such as cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and specific devices such as TE [9]. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM)
by TE (FibroScan, Echosens, Paris) uses ultrasoundbased technology for quantitative assessment of hepatic
fibrosis. It has been shown to be sufficiently accurate to
predict the fibrosis stage in NAFLD patients [10].
Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE)
measures the speed of a mechanically induced shear
wave using pulse-echo ultrasonic acquisitions in a much
larger portion of the tissue, approximately 100 times
more than a liver biopsy core. However, prior studies
evaluating the performance of VCTE in NAFLD have
been limited by medium (M) size probes with an ultrasound probe frequency of 3.5 MHz to measure LSM at a
depth of 2.5 and 6.5 cm from the skin. LSM assessed by
VCTE has been shown to be an easy to perform, noninvasive test to reliably estimate the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with NAFLD [11].
The newer version of VCTE had several features that
not only overcome its prior limitations, but also enhance
its role as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients
with NAFLD. It is currently approved by the regulatory
authorities to measure a 3.5 MHz ultrasound coefficient
of attenuation, known as the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP).
CAP is a new technology based on the principle of the
ultrasonic attenuation of transient elastography depending on the viscosity [fat] of the medium [liver] and the
distance of propagation of the ultrasonic signals into the
liver, providing a useful method for the quantitative detection of liver fat content and is considered a better assessment method for hepatic steatosis. Compared with
ultrasound, this technology improves the sensitivity and
specificity for the diagnosis of fatty liver and can be used
for universal screening, diagnosis, and follow-up in
NAFLD patients [12].
While LSM is measured in kilopascals (KPa), CAP is
measured in decibels per meter (dB/m) and reflects the
decrease in the amplitude of ultrasound signal in the
liver [13]. Therefore, a higher CAP is reflective of the
higher degree of steatosis. CAP is displayed only when
LSM is valid, as it is only computed from the ultrasound
signals used for acquiring LSM. The shear wave speed
with an estimation of stiffness and CAP currently allows
for simultaneous assessment of both liver fibrosis and
steatosis [14].
This study aimed at the evaluation of the role of TE
and CAP in the assessment of both liver fibrosis and
steatosis in comparison to other non-invasive assessment
scores such as APRI, FIB-4, NFS, and FLI in patients
with NAFLD.
Methods
This study included 90 patients with NAFLD recruited
from the outpatient clinics of Ain Shams University
Hospitals and Theodor Bilharz Research Institute over a
6-month period from June to December 2019. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Written consents were approved by the ethical
committee of both institutions.
Mansour et al. Egyptian Liver Journal (2020) 10:33 Page 2 of 10

All patients were subjected to thorough history taking
and clinical examination with special emphasis on the
presence of risk factors, previous history, signs or symptoms, or complications of chronic liver disease or viral
hepatitis. All patients with causes of liver disease other
than NAFLD (e.g., viral hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, Wilson’s disease, and hemochromatosis) were excluded. Physical measurements were done and included:
 Body mass index (BMI): weight (kg)/height (m)2
(normal: < 25)
 Waist circumference (WC): measured horizontally
at the level of the navel without compressing the
skin. (Normal: males 78:94 cm, females 64:80 cm).
Routine laboratory investigations were done for all patients participating in the study, including complete
blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests,
lipid profile, blood glucose levels, thyroid function tests,
and coagulation profiles.
Pelviabdominal ultrasound was done to all patients
using the Philips Envisor C HD device. Measurements
were performed after overnight fasting with the patient
in a supine position with emphasis on measuring the
span of the right hepatic lobe in the mid-clavicular line
on oblique view and classified as shrunken (< 11 cm),
average (11–15 cm), or enlarged (> 15 cm). Hepatic texture as regards fat infiltration was also noted.
The diagnosis of NAFLD in recruited patients
depended on high BMI, abnormalities in liver enzymes,
detection of hepatic steatosis on pelviabdominal ultrasonography, features of metabolic syndrome, and noninvasive assessment scores for hepatic fibrosis, e.g., FIB4, APRI, NFS, and hepatic steatosis, e.g., FLI [15].
VCTE was done for all patients using FibroScan 502
(Echosens, Paris, France) device using two probes: M+
and XL+, which was available at the participating institutions, for measuring LSM and CAP.
All studies were performed by a dedicated study coordinator using standardized protocols as provided by
the manufacturer. Two scans were performed during the
same visit several minutes apart by the same coordinator
(intra-operator assessment) or by a second coordinator
(inter-operator assessment) in a subset of participants.
Only patients with 10 valid measures were included, and
poor results were excluded from the analysis. According
to the manufacturer’s instructions, in addition to previous studies, the stages of fibrosis (F0: 1–6, F1: 6.1–7, F2:
7–9, F3: 9.1–10.3, and F4: ≥ 10.4) were defined in kPa
[15, 16]. Moreover, steatosis stages (S0: < 215, S1: 216–
252, S2: 253–296, S3: > 296) were defined in dB/m [17].
Fibrosis and steatosis scores were also calculated for
each patient using standardized equations (APRI [18],
FIB-4 [19], NFS [20], and FLI [21]).
The results were tabulated and statistically analyzed
using computer software (SPSS version 25 for Windows,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics included
mean and standard deviation for quantitative variables, in
addition to number and percentage for qualitative variables. Correlation between dependent and independent
variables was done using Pearson’s and Spearman rank
correlation coefficients. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed
through sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using receiver
operator characteristics (ROC) curve. Significance levels
were determined based on the level of probability (p)
where p < 0.05 indicated a significant difference and p <
0.001 indicated a highly significant difference.
Results
This cross-sectional study included 90 adult patients
(Table 1) with NAFLD, divided into 62 females (68.9 %)
and 28 males (31.1 %), aging 18–72 years (mean age
45.53 ± 11.5), who have either abnormal serum transaminases or GGT levels, or steatosis at ultrasonography, or
have one or more of the following features of metabolic
syndrome:
 Fasting blood glucose greater than 110 mg/dl or a
previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.
 BMI of 27 or higher or WC greater than 102 cm in
males and 88 cm in females.
 Blood pressure greater than 130/85 or current antihypertensive treatment.
 Triglyceride levels greater than 150 mg/dl or current
use of fibrates.
 HDL-cholesterol lower than 40 mg/dl (males) and
50 mg/dl (females).
There was a highly significant positive correlation between fibrosis grades assessed by TE and other noninvasive scores and lab parameters (APRI, FIB-4, NFS),
ALT, AST, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), in
addition to a highly significant negative correlation between fibrosis grades and platelet count (Table 2).
As regards grades of hepatic steatosis, there was a statistically significant positive correlation with BMI, WC,
FLI, and presence of diabetes mellitus, in addition to a
highly significant positive correlation with lab parameters such as ALT, AST, GGT, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Detailed correlation and regression results are
summarized in Table 3.
Evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of TE showed
that the best cut-off value for fibrosis detection by TE
(LSM) vs. APRI, FIB-4, and NFS scores is overall average
5.2 which fulfills the highest sensitivity, specificity, and
accuracy (85.30%, 47.70%, and 85.48%, respectively,
AUC 0.742). Detailed results are summarized in Table 4.

On the other hand, evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of CAP showed that the best cut-off value for steatosis detected by CAP vs. FLI score is 220.5 which fulfills
the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (86.00%,
65.0%, and 85.65%, respectively). Detailed results are
summarized in Table 5.
Discussion
NAFLD is regarded as the most common liver disease in
the twenty-first century, and it is present if at least 5% of
the liver weight is fat without excess alcohol consumption or secondary causes of fat accumulation in the
background. Approximately 25% of adults around the
world have NAFLD, and the prevalence is still
increasing.
The majority of patients in this study had no or mild
liver fibrosis [F0: 52 (57.78%), F1: 20 (22.22%)], while 16
patients showed moderate fibrosis [F2: 16 (17.78%)], and
only 2 patients showed advanced fibrosis [F4:2 (2.22%)].
These results come against the results of another study
done by Fallatah and his colleagues assessing the role of
FibroScan compared to other non-invasive assessment
scores in 122 Saudi patients with NAFLD. In his study,
there was a high percentage of patients showing advanced liver fibrosis by FibroScan [F4: 40 (32.8%)]. These
contradicting results can be possibly attributed to demographic differences between patient populations of the
two studies, where there is a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Saudi
population, explaining the high prevalence of advanced
NAFLD-related liver fibrosis [16].
On the other hand, our results agree with Fallatah
et al. study which concluded that there was a significant
positive correlation between LSM detected by TE as
compared to APRI and FIB-4 results (r = 0.51, r = 0.50,
p < 0.001) [16]. This also agrees with Sumida et al. who
compared the results of 6 non-invasive markers of liver
fibrosis based on data from 576 biopsy-proven NAFLD
patients and found the sensitivity and specificity of FIB-4
score for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis was 90%
and 64%, respectively, with diagnostic accuracy 87.1%
(AUROC 0.871) [22]. Our study also goes with Boursier
et al. who found the diagnostic accuracy of FIB-4 score
for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis was 70.4%
(AUROC 0.704) [23].
Moreover, the current study showed that there was
statistically highly significant correlation between NFS
score and LSM by TE (r = 0.60, r = 0.53, p < 0.001),
which goes with results of another study done by Samy
and colleagues who evaluated 60 patients with NAFLD
and assessed fibrotest, NFS, FIB-4 score, and LSM by TE
in the detection of liver fibrosis depending on liver biopsy and showed there was a statistically significant association between fibrosis and NFS value [24].
We also found that there is statistically highly significant negative correlation between platelet count and
LSM by TE (r = − 0.81, r = 0.70, p < 0.001), and this
agree with Fallatah et al. who found a strong negative
correlation between platelet count and stiffness, as
thrombocytopenia in liver disease is associated with advanced fibrosis and even cirrhosis [16].
Moreover, there was a highly significant statistical correlation between ALT, AST, and LSM measured by TE
(r = 0.54, r = 0.52, p < 0.001 and r = 0.52, r = 0.59, p <
0.001, respectively), which agrees with Fabrellas and his
colleagues who evaluated 215 subjects with metabolic
risk factors without known liver disease identified randomly from a primary care center. A control group of
80 subjects matched by age and sex without metabolic
risk factors was also studied. CAP and LSM were
assessed using TE and found that there was a good statistical correlation between liver transaminases and increased LSM, suggestive of liver fibrosis [25].
As regards GGT, the current study showed a highly
significant statistical correlation between GGT and LSM
by TE (r = 0.60, r = 0.87, p < 0.001), which goes in accordance with other study done by Mansour et al. who

analyzed 108 patients with NAFLD and found a statistically significant correlation between GGT and LSM by
TE (r = 0.242, p < 0.05) [26].
As regards liver steatosis grades, the current study
showed that most patients had marked hepatic steatosis
as demonstrated by CAP [S2: 31 (34.4%), S3: 30
(33.3%)], while the rest showed mild steatosis [S0: 11
(12.2%), S1: 18 (20%)]. This comes against the results of
another study by de Lédinghen and his colleagues which
concluded that the majority of patients showed no or
mild steatosis [S0: 58 (51.8%), S1: 21 (18.8%)], while the
rest of the patients showed more advanced steatosis
grades [S2: 16 (14.3%), S3: 17 (15.2%)]. The discrepancy
in the results between the two studies can be attributed
to differences in the study population, where in his
study, the mean BMI of patients was 26 kg/m2
, while in
our current study, the patients had mean BMI of 35.59 ±
5.77. It is clear from this data that the patients in the
current study had higher mean body weight and thus are
expected to be more liable to hepatic steatosis [17].
We also found that there is a statistically highly significant correlation between FLI and steatosis measured by
CAP (r = 0.60, r = 0.53, p < 0.001), and this revealed that
FLI has a high discriminatory power in the diagnosis of
NAFLD. This result agrees with Motamed and his colleagues who analyzed 5052 subjects and found that there
was a significant positive high correlation observed between serum FLI and NAFLD (AUC = 0.8656, 95% CI
0.8548–0.8764) which was also confirmed by binary regression, to the point that a one-unit increase in FLI led
to a 5.8% increase in the chance of developing NAFLD
and showed good predictive performance in the diagnosis of NAFLD [27]. Additionally, this agrees with Dehnavi et al. who analyzed 212 patients with NAFLD and
found that FLI was significantly associated with NAFLD
(OR = 1.062, 95%CI 1.042–1.082, p < 0.001), and that
mean FLI, BMI, WC, TG, and GGT were all significantly
higher in NAFLD patients than in non-NAFLD participants, and that a one unit increase in FLI elevated the
chance of developing NAFLD by 6.2% [28].
We also found that there is a statistically significant
correlation between GGT and steatosis measured by
CAP (r = 0.60, r = 0.53, p < 0.001) which goes with the
findings of Dehnavi et al. who concluded that there is a
statistically significant correlation between GGT and
steatosis (AUC = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.58–0.75, p < 0.001)
[28]. This also agrees with Motamed et al. who found
that there was a significant positive high correlation was
observed between serum GGT and NAFLD (AUC =
0.6927, 95% CI 0.6772–0.7081), p < 0.0001) [27].
We also found that there is a highly significant statistical correlation between TG and serum cholesterol as

compared to steatosis measured by CAP (r = 0.56, r =
0.58, p < 0.001, and r = 0.64, r = 0.78, p < 0.001, respectively). This agrees with Kwok et al. who examined 1918
patients with CAP and LSM and found that increased
CAP ≥ 222 dB/m was associated with higher body
weight, BMI, WC, TG, fasting plasma glucose, and ALT.
It was also associated with lower HDL cholesterol [13].
We also found that there is a statistically significant correlation between BMI and WC in comparison to steatosis

this agrees with Dehnavi et al. who found that there is a

The current study also found that there was a statistically
significant correlation between DM and steatosis grades
and values obtained by CAP (r = 0.46, r = 0.49, p < 0.026),
which goes with Kwok et al. who found that there is a significant positive high correlation observed between serum
fasting blood glucose and steatosis and that around 32–
62% of diabetic patients were found to have NAFLD [13].
We also found that the best cut-off value for fibrosis
detection by TE (LSM) vs. NFS is 4.10 KPa, which fulfills
the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (Table
4). A study by Samy and his colleagues found that, depending on liver biopsy, the sensitivity, specificity, and
accuracy of NFS to detect liver fibrosis are good, with
AUROCs of 0.94. For mild fibrosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of NFS was 89.47%, 90.24%, and
94.7%, respectively. On the other hand, the sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy of NFS in cases of severe liver
fibrosis were found to be 100%, 89.8%, and 98.1%, respectively [24].
We also found that the best cut-off value for fibrosis
detection by TE (LSM) vs. FIB-4 score is 6.95 KPa, which
fulfills the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
(Table 4). This also agrees with the results obtained by
Samy et al. who concluded that, depending on liver biopsy, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FIB-4
score to detect liver fibrosis are good, with AUROCs of
0.992 (94.7%, 97.6%, and 99.2%, respectively) [24]. Similarly, another study by Sumida et al. found the sensitivity
and specificity of the FIB-4 score for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis was 90% and 64%, respectively, with
diagnostic accuracy 87.1% [22].
Our results show that the best cut-off value for fibrosis
detection by TE (LSM) vs. APRI score is 4.5 KPa, which
fulfills the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
(Table 4). This agrees with Kolhe et al. who analyzed
histological and clinical data of 100 consecutive urban
slum-dwelling patients with NAFLD and showed that
APRI had sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV,
and AUROC of 85.2%, 87.7%, 95%, 58.33%, 96.05%, and
0.95, respectively, with a statistically high significant correlation between APRI and biopsy-proven fibrosis [29].
Our study shows that the best cut-off value for fibrosis
detection by TE (LSM) vs. APRI, FIB-4, and NFS scores
has an overall average of 5.2 Kpa, which fulfills the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (85.30%, 47.70%,
and 85.48%, respectively, AUC 0.742) (Fig. 1). Similarly,
Önnerhag and his colleagues who included 144 patients
with biopsy-proven NAFLD showed that FIB-4-index
had the highest NPV (91%) and APRI the highest PPV
(71%). The AUROC for FIB-4-index, NFS, and APRI acceptably predicted advanced fibrosis with values between
0.81 and 0.86 [30].
Our study results are close to Hashemi et al. who performed a meta-analysis that enrolled the literature published about LSM detected by TE for the diagnosis and
staging of NAFLD and found the sensitivity and specificity of FibroScan in the detection of fibrosis to be 87.5%
and 78.4%, respectively [31]. This also agrees with Boursier et al. who evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of LSM
by TE in a cross-sectional study including 452 NAFLD
patients; found that its accuracy was 83.1% [23].
Our study also agrees with Aykut et al. who compared
the diagnostic performances of three different nonTable 5 Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for steatosis by CAP
and non-invasive assessment scores

invasive methods including TE for the detection of liver
fibrosis in a total of 88 patients with biopsy-proven
NAFLD and found the diagnostic accuracy 90.2% [32].
Our results show that the best cut-off value for steatosis detection by CAP vs FLI score is 220.5 dB/m, which
fulfills the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
(Table 5) (Fig. 2). Motamed et al. also showed that FLI
showed good performance in the diagnosis of NAFLD
with accuracy equal to 86.56% (AUC = 0.8656) and revealed that FLI has a high discriminatory power in the
diagnosis of NAFLD [27]. This could be somewhat anticipated due to the fact that FLI is composed of four quantities related to NAFLD, including BMI, WC, GGT, and
TG. A high BMI or WC, the main obesity indices, is considered an essential risk factor for NAFLD, and the prevalence of NAFLD substantially increases in obese
individuals.
Similarly, Dehnavi et al. investigated the relationship
between FLI and NAFLD based on logistic regression
and their findings revealed a highly significant positive
relationship between FLI and NAFLD, so that even a
one unit increase in FLI elevated the chance of developing NAFLD by 6.2% (OR = 1.062, 95%CI 1.042–1.082, p
< 0.001). Even after adjusting for confounding factors
such as sex, age, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), FBS,
ALT, and LDL, the logistic regression analysis showed a
significant positive association between FLI and NAFLD
(OR = 1.059, 95%CI 1.035–1.083, p < 0.001) [28].
These findings go also with Siddiqui et al. who performed a prospective study of 393 adults with NAFLD
who underwent VCTE within 1 year of liver histology
analysis and found that the CAP value is positively associated with severity of hepatic steatosis and the crossvalidated AUROC is 76% for classifying patients with ≥
5% steatosis on histology [33]. This also goes with
Eddowes et al. who evaluated 450 patients and assessed
the diagnostic accuracy of CAP and LSM against liver
biopsy and found that CAP by TE is accurate noninvasive methods for assessing liver steatosis in patients
with NAFLD with an AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.82–
0.92), sensitivity of 0.80, and specificity of 0.83 [34].
Conclusions
 TE including LSM and CAP has the advantages of
being a simple, non-invasive, inexpensive, painless,
and operator/machine-independent method and displays good application prospects.
 Our study shows a highly significant positive
correlation between LSM by TE and other noninvasive assessment scores of liver fibrosis (APRI,
FIB-4, and NFS), in addition to ALT, AST, and
GGT.
 Moreover, our study shows a highly significant
positive correlation between hepatic steatosis
measurement as obtained by CAP and other
parameters, including BMI, WC, FLI, presence of
diabetes mellitus, ALT, AST, GGT, cholesterol, and
triglycerides.
 The best cut-off value for liver fibrosis detection by
TE (LSM) vs. APRI, FIB-4, and NFS scores is overall
average 5.2, which fulfills the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (85.30%, 47.70%, and 85.48%,
respectively, AUC 0.742).
 On the other hand, the best cut-off value for steatosis detected by CAP vs. FLI score is 220.5 which fulfills the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
(86.00%, 65.0%, and 85.65%, respectively).
 The possibility of concomitant assessment of liver
fibrosis (using LSM) and of steatosis (using CAP)
makes TE a promising non-invasive tool for assessing and quantifying both steatosis and fibrosis in
patients with NAFLD.
