Abstract In Switzerland, organ procurement is well
organized at the national-level but transplant outcomes
have not been systematically monitored so far. Therefore, a
novel project, the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS),
was established. The STCS is a prospective multicentre
study, designed as a dynamic cohort, which enrolls all solid
organ recipients at the national level. The features of the
STCS are a flexible patient-case system that allows capturing all transplant scenarios and collection of patientspecific and allograft-specific data. Beyond comprehensive
clinical data, specific focus is directed at psychosocial and
behavioral factors, infectious disease development, and
bio-banking. Between May 2008 and end of 2011, the six
Swiss transplant centers recruited 1,677 patients involving
1,721 transplantations, and a total of 1,800 organs
implanted in 15 different transplantation scenarios. 10 % of
all patients underwent re-transplantation and 3% had a
second transplantation, either in the past or during followup. 34% of all kidney allografts originated from living
donation. Until the end of 2011 we observed 4,385 infection episodes in our patient population. The STCS showed
operative capabilities to collect high-quality data and to
adequately reflect the complexity of the post-transplantation process. The STCS represents a promising novel
project for comparative effectiveness research in transplantation medicine.
This study is conducted on behalf of all members of the Swiss
Transplant Cohort Study.

Introduction
In Switzerland, solid organ donor evaluation and organ
allocation have been well organized at the level of six
transplantation centers since 1985. However, no countrywide structure existed to systematically monitor transplant
outcomes and to coordinate multicenter studies during the
post-transplant process. Each transplant program collected
its own data, and no monitoring or auditing was performed.
In 2006, several Swiss investigators from different disciplines decided to launch a prospective multicenter cohort
project, the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), aiming
at a nationwide comprehensive and structured data collection in all solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. After
a 2-year set-up period the STCS started to be operative
with the first patients enrolled in May 2008.
In a parallel development, a new transplantation law was
enforced in 2007, requiring a mandatory life-long follow
up of all transplanted patients in Switzerland. In a collaborative effort of the Swiss transplantation centers with the
Federal Office of Public Health, the cohort ensures compliance with the requirements of the law.
Other national and international transplant registries have
previously shown their value by generating a large body of
knowledge in transplantation medicine. Examples are the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) in the
US [1, 2], the Heidelberg-based Collaborative Transplant
Study (CTS) in Europe [3, 4], the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry [5], as
well as the Spanish Resitra cohort [6, 7]. These large registries focus on specific biomedical factors but are often
limited in regard to the integration of psychosocial and
behavioral factors, infectious disease occurrence, immunologic factors and a variety of long-term outcome. Moreover,
most of these registries are based on the willingness of the
centers to contribute patient data. One of the aims of the
STCS is to provide a complete nationwide long-term followup and embracing a comprehensive bio-psychosocial perspective in its data collection providing a unique instrument
for comparative effectiveness research [8].
This article describes the rationale and design of the
STCS, provides preliminary descriptive results and aims to
integrate this new project into the environment of other
existing observational studies.
The main objectives of the STCS are to:
• Record all SOTs within one unique database system in
order to have a complete assessment of all patient-,
transplant-, and center-specific activities in Switzerland.
• Prospectively collect high quality longitudinal clinical and
laboratory data of transplant recipients at the Swiss national
level, to evaluate the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of
SOT in order to support patients, health care professionals
and policy makers with informed decision-making.
• Implement a bio-bank sampling scheme to integrate
biological and clinical information.
• Reflect the complexity of the post-transplant patient
care in an appropriate data model and integrate this
complexity into research hypothesis and methodology.
• Collect selected psychosocial and behavioral data at
time of listing and during follow-up.
• Systematically capture relevant infectious diseases
episodes.
• Record and periodically update specific risk profiles to
reflect changes in disease- and treatment status.
• Assess determinants of poor short- or long-term
outcome and allow studying alternative pathways that
contribute to the understanding of patient – and
allograft survival [6, 7, 9–11].
Materials and methods
Study design and setting
The STCS is a prospective multicenter cohort which was
designed as a dynamic cohort study where SOT recipients
move in and out as time progresses [12]. We define prospective in the sense that data definitions were made in
agreement with the rationale of the study prior to the
enrolment period, and that measurements are made in
agreement with these definitions [13]. A version control
strategy has been implemented that ensures data consistency over time, should changes or an updating of the data
definitions become necessary.

A patient is considered as transplanted and therefore
enrolled at the moment of transplantation, i.e. when the surgeon releases the clamps to start reperfusion of the allograft.
For islets transplantation, we defined transplantation as the
moment when the islets are injected into the recipient. At the
time point of transplantation, the ‘‘patient clock’’ is set to zero
initiating prospective follow-up of both the patient and the
corresponding allograft(s). Any subsequent transplantation
that may occur for a patient is prospectively registered within
the patient-case system. Patient follow-up ends with death or
definitive drop-out. Non-fatal graft failure does not truncate a
patient’s follow-up (e.g. kidney transplant recipients).
Participants
All recipients of SOTs in Switzerland are prospectively
registered since May 2008. No particular eligibility or
exclusion criteria exist for enrolment. Patients with grafts
implanted before the start in May 2008 are not recruited
retrospectively, unless such a patient presents for a re- or a
second transplant. Tissue transplantations are not considered.
Switzerland has compulsory health insurance and
transplantation is part of basic health care. Patients pay
premiums with co-payments for medications.
Patient-case system
The core data structure of the STCS is the patient-case
system, a framework that reflects the post-transplant patient
process involving a multitude of information on patients
and allografts, including function and interventions from
transplantation until end of follow-up (Fig. 1).
The STCS patient-case system allows distinguishing
data that accrue in relation to the patient from data related
to the transplanted organ(s). We therefore define a ‘‘case’’
as any SOT of a given patient. A patient may have one or
several cases, and one case can involve one, or more than
one allograft. Each case nested within a patient has its own
time axis and follow-up (‘‘case clock’’, Fig. 1).
Patient-data captures information which is of systemic
nature and that relates to the patient, but not to the transplant
itself. In contrast case-data captures information restricted to
the allograft(s). The first case is the transplant event that leads
to enrolment in our study. Later cases are termed re-transplants
or second transplants. A re-transplant is a repetition of the
same SOT after failure of the previous transplant; e.g. a kidney
re-transplanted after loss of function of the previous kidney
allograft. A second transplant refers to a subsequent transplantation of a different type of allograft; e.g. a pancreas
transplantation following a successfully implanted kidney
allograft. Each instance can either be a single or a double
transplantation. Double transplantation refers to concomitant
transplantation of two organs originating from the same donor.
Thus three classification layers can be distinguished: (1)
the patient; (2) the SOT (classified into single or double/
complex SOT and into first, second- or re-transplantation);
(3) the implanted organ. E.g. both allografts of a kidneypancreas double transplantation are treated as separate
instances. Patients are usually classified by their first STCS
(enrolment) transplantation.
Our patient-case system assigns unique patient and case
identification numbers. Linkage of patient and case data
allows reconstructing the transplantation process (Figs. 1
and 2) with longitudinal updating of both patient and case
information, as well as capture of intermediate events.
Donor-recipient linkage is ensured via the unique Swiss
organ allocation number (SOAS-ID), which is generated
within the national Swiss Organ Allocation System
(SOAS) and is transferred to the STCS. Donor data specification is detailed in the Appendix (in ESM).

part of the STCS patient-case system (Fig. 1). After

transplantation, all patients are mandatorily followed in
their respective transplant centers. After baseline assessment, STCS follow-up assessments take place at 6-,
12 months and yearly thereafter. In the case of a second or
re-transplantation, we perform three extra assessments of
the new case at baseline, 6-, and 12 month and we update
the patient data in regard to the new case. After completion
of these three extra visits, the schedule is synchronized to
the initial patient visit schedule (‘‘patient clock’’).
Biological samples are collected in relation to the case at
baseline, and at 6-, and the 12-month visits. Psychosocial
assessments are performed at time of listing, at 6-,
12 months and yearly thereafter along the ‘‘patient clock’’.
Specific data forms exist to track samples and to record
infectious events, death and drop-out.
Data definitions and measurements
On the patient-level, data collection extendedly focuses on
psychosocial questionnaire (PSQ)-, infectious disease-,
cancer, and causes-of-death data; on the case-level on biosampling, organ function, immunologic events and causes
of graft failure. A separate repository exists for medication
data, including induction, maintenance immunosuppression; infectious disease prophylaxis and a selection of other
relevant drugs. Where appropriate, data are collected longitudinally and are thus updated over time. All details on
STCS data including data definitions and measurements are
given in the Appendix (in ESM).
Data processing, management and data quality
assurance
The local transplant coordinators have full access to the
SOAS and they are informed about all listings and transplantations. They work in close collaboration with the
STCS local site data managers (LDM) and provide information about enlisted patients and all recent transplantations performed at their center.
Local site data managers are responsible for data collection pertaining to a certain follow-up period (e.g. baseline,
6 month, yearly). All LDM have an STCS local transplant
physician at their side for support in data access and medical
content support. All data are entered into patient- and organspecific online case report forms (CRF) and all data are
electronically transferred to a central database system.
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) establish the
working standards, address legal aspects of consent handling,
bio-sampling and on updating of the STCS infrastructure.
Under the mandate of the Swiss federal office of public
health [14], nationwide data quality audits are performed
to improve data quality and enhance between-center
standardization.
The STCS implemented an endpoint committee that
reviews all death registered within the STCS database on a
regular basis. Causes of death are determined at the site by
two physicians independently. Disagreement in coding is
resolved by consensus. We code causes of death according
to the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention

(CDC) system based on immediate and underlying causes
of death [15].
The database is maintained by the Division of Medical
Information Sciences, University Hospitals of Geneva. The
system is entirely based on ‘‘attribute-values’’ entities [16]
that avoids to use conventional relational techniques.
Attribute-values approaches are perfectly adapted to
answer evolving data models and heterogeneous data representation [16].
Structure and organization
The STCS is a scientific project with a primary interest in
clinical research and with a strong secondary interest in the
control of quality of care requested by the Swiss law on
transplantation. The study is investigator-initiated. All
participating centers and epidemiologists contributed to the
design of the STCS. The STCS does not pursue financial
interests. The institutional review boards of all transplanting centers approved the participation in the STCS.
The STCS is operationally led by an Executive Office
(EO). The STCS steering committee, called the board of
representatives (BOR) includes representatives from all
centers. Various working groups provide expert advice.
The STCS scientific committee, assembled from representatives of all participating centers and the various
medical specialties involved in transplantation, covers all
aspects regarding the conduct of scientific research projects
nested within the STCS. The STCS regularly reports to the
Swiss federal office of public health [17, 18] in order to
comply with the national requirements on quality control.
The conduct of the STCS was approved by the independent ethic committee of each Swiss transplant center.
Written information about the STCS is distributed to
patients during listing. To obtain the full cohort data
including bio-samples, patients are asked to provide written
informed consent while listed or latest at the time of
enrollment. For patients who deny consent, the law mandates collection of a set of mandatory data (‘‘minimal
dataset’’) involving a restricted number of transplant-relevant baseline and endpoint data [19].
Results
First descriptive data for the period May 2008 until end
of 2011
Between May 2008 and end of 2011, all six STCS centers
recruited 1,677 patients that underwent 1,721 transplantations involving a total of 1,800 implanted organs (Tables 1
and 2). 93% of all SOT recipients consented to STCS
participation. The monthly patient recruitment rate varied
between 10 and 60 patients over time. By end of December
2011, we had recruited patients with e.g. 981 single kidney,
346 liver, 164 lung, 119 heart, and 27 islets transplantations. The classification of these patients is according to the
first STCS (enrolment) transplantation. The most frequent
enrolment double transplantations were kidney-pancreas
(n=41) and kidney-liver (n=16). 10% percent of all patients
underwent re-transplantation and 3% had a second transplantation, either in the past prior to the initiation of STCS
or during STCS follow-up. We prospectively registered 15
different transplantation scenarios, including seven single,
and eight double or triple transplantation scenarios.
A total of 34 % of all single kidney transplants originated from living donation, of which 55% were from living-related, and 45% from living-unrelated donation.

Thirteen liver transplantations arose from living-related
and 7 from living-unrelated donation.
The median follow-up duration was 1.7 years (IQR
0.7–2.6) for the stated period. Overall, 136 patients died,
102 had allograft failures and four patients were lost to
follow-up; three moved away and one did not respond to
repeated contact. Figure 2 shows the overall patient survival stratified by the four most frequent STCS first
transplantations.
We observed 4,385 infection episodes in our patient
population during the observation period. 1,048 patients
(62%) showed at least one bacterial, viral, fungal or parasite infection episode. 521 (31%) had at least one proven
bacterial or fungal disease, or a viral syndrome (Table 3,
Appendix in ESM). Figure 3 shows the rate of proven
diseases due to the mentioned pathogen groups in patients
stratified by their STCS first transplantation.
In consenting patients, we moreover harvested 3,630
plasma-, 3,570 viable cell—and 1,663 extracted DNA
samples. Samples could be obtained in 98% of all consenting patients (see sampling scheme Fig. 1).
Table 4 shows the number of case-report forms where
the mandatory data were complete, partially complete or
missing. Overall, 96.6% of CRFs with a closed follow-up
period were complete. The highest number of missingness
was observed in liver transplantation.
Discussion
The STCS is a novel prospective cohort study that comprehensively monitors all SOT activities in Switzerland.
The current experience shows that the STCS has become
an operating cohort that allows highly complete and adequate capture of important transplant-related events.
Transplant scenarios of any complexity can be reflected in
detail along with the collection of psychosocial, infectious
disease and transplant-relevant outcome data.
What makes the STCS unique among the existing
registries?
In the past, large collaborative studies have provided
important knowledge in the field of transplantation. These
include the Heidelberg-based Collaborative Transplant
Study (CTS). This registry is based on the voluntary
cooperation of more than 400 transplant centers in 45
countries, which has included more than 4,00,000 recipients of kidney, heart, lung, liver, and pancreas transplantations [3]. In the US, national data on solid organ
transplantations are collected through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) [20]. The
National Institute of Health furthermore sponsors the
‘‘Adult to adult living donor liver transplantation cohort
study’’ (A2ALL), including data from 9 US transplant
centers. The International Registry for Heart and Lung
Transplantation (ISHLT) provides information on the thoracic organ transplant experience around the world [21].
Since 1968 the European Liver Transplant Registry
(ELTR) collected data regarding over 71,000 liver transplantations performed in 137 European centers [22]. The
Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant
(ANZDATA) [5] and the Australian and New Zealand
Cardiothoracic Organ Transplant Registry (ANZCOTR)
[23] are comprehensive, population based registries.
All these large cohorts suffer to some extent from the
heterogeneity of clinical follow-up data and none implemented clear-cut definitions of transplant related outcomes
such as rejection and infections. Most registries provide
their data on a voluntary basis and data monitoring activities according to a priori defined quality standards are
limited. Moreover there are differences in immunosuppressive regimens, in prophylaxis and therapeutic infectious strategies, differences in availability of patient care

due to large distances between transplant centers and
patient homes, as well as differences between centers
within and between different countries.
Many registries and large cohort studies focus only on
one type of solid organ transplant population (e.g. USRDS,
ELTR, A2ALL, ANZDATA) or are limited to thoracic
organs (ISHLT), thus limiting the options for comparisons
among different transplant populations. Some registries
include several types of organ transplants (e.g. CTS), but
are limited to centers who volunteer in participation [3, 24]
with the uncertainty about potential selection and information bias. Further issues may relate to data quality: a
comparison of OPTN/SRTR with A2ALL supported this
hypothesis and claimed center-specific data monitoring to
substantially improve the data [25].
Findings from large registries often result in interesting
hypotheses, which in turn need to be validated in subsequent studies because of the lack of systematic collection
of recipient serum and cell samples, and/or prospective
outcome data [26]. None of the cohorts monitors prospectively from time of listing the life-long post-transplant
course by means of clinical and selected patient reported
outcome data.
The STCS is a unique and novel prospective, comprehensive cohort study that attempts to fill these gaps. Indeed
the STCS follows by law all transplanted patients at the
Swiss national level, therefore preventing patient selection
processes and potential selection bias. Furthermore the
STCS was designed to collect ample clinical, psychosocial,
immunologic, infectious diseases, metabolic and cancer data,
paralleled by the harvesting of genomic DNA, plasma and
live peripheral blood mononuclear cells in consenting
patients (currently 93%). In addition database cross-matching with the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS) ensures
complete patient enrolment and transparently shows all solid
organ transplantation activities in Switzerland. Also the
linkage with the Swiss Monitoring of Potential Donors
(SwissPOD) study potentially allows access to an extended
range of donor data. The relatively small geographic characteristics of Switzerland as a country with short distances
allow adequate long-term follow-up for almost all SOT
recipients across the country. Working groups in all transplant-related medical specialties continuously cooperate on
data definitions and on homogeneous data collection.
Moreover these working groups defined appropriate diagnostics tools (e.g. CMV viremia detection), as well as prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for infectious events. A
well-recognized example for the success of Swiss cohorts
based on similar characteristics is the Swiss HIV cohort
study (SHCS) [8, 27] which has become a worldwide reference in HIV research.
A key strength of the STCS is its rigorous longitudinal
data structure. Changes in exposure to risk factors (e.g.
smoking, medication non-adherence) or medication use are

infectious diseases by type of

registered, and in parallel changes in the patient’s health
status, physical functioning, work ability or organ function
are longitudinally updated. It is one of the priorities of the
STCS to focus on chronic disease burden beyond the mere
transplant outcomes, and to reflect the complexity of the
post-transplant process in the population of Swiss SOT
recipients. Along an inherently consistent data structure,
the STCS priorities are high-data quality and minimization
of attrition by standardized data management processes
(SOP’s) and site monitoring for data quality. In line with
this cohort architecture, the STCS endorses the reporting
according to the STROBE statement [13].
The STCS allows for a comprehensive capture of all
transplanted patients on the country level. This is only
possible since the consent barrier for minimal data collection can be overruled by law in Switzerland, with the
potential to address scientific hypotheses based on real-life
and long-term data. Future STCS projects will provide
novel insight on e.g. infectious disease occurrence, comparison of STCS patient—and organ survival with existing
registries, the influence of center effects and genetic
association studies.
Limitations of the STCS and sources of bias
Compared to other national and international large registries,
the STCS is a relatively small-sized cohort study, with the
limitation of small numbers particularly in uncommon
transplant scenarios. However the restricted size was an
advantage for the creation of the described cohort. In larger
countries it would have been very difficult to create a
nationwide cohort initiative with a comprehensive and high
quality data structure, bio sampling and with the possibility
of consistent longitudinal data structure.
All routine laboratory and sampling procedures are
processed in local transplant centers, what may be seen as a
limitation. However, standards, laboratory methods, units
and detection limits differ only slightly between these local
laboratories and will therefore likely be small and not lead
to important center effects regarding patient care.
Conclusion
The Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) is a new prospective collaborative multicenter cohort, which systematically monitors all SOTs on the Swiss national level, and
puts into place a novel patient-case system that allows reconstructing and operationalizing all post-transplant scenarios, thus reflecting the complexity of the post-transplant
process. The unique geographic characteristics of Switzerland are an advantage in regard to high quality longterm prospective observation. The comprehensive clinical
data aligned with bio sampling makes the STCS unique as
a longitudinal transplant cohort. It is suggested that the
longitudinal nature of the study design provides the basis
for advanced modeling of the interplay of biological,
psycho-social and system factors with the potential to
improve transplant outcomes.

According to standard operating procedures, a 90 days’ time span is
allowed for data capture and entry. CRFs of patients who died or who
lost their graft within a follow-up period were removed for this
analysis. 176 CRFs were removed from the analysis since the followup period was not yet completed
* Completed: [80% of all mandatory data captured

significantly to the operation of the STCS. The help of the Swiss HIV
cohort study (H. Gu¨nthard and M. Rickenbach) in allowing to profit
from its expertise is thankfully acknowledged. The STCS has been
funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant
33CS30_134267/1) and by the six Swiss hospitals with transplant
centers. Data quality audits (2011–2012) have been funded by the
Federal Office of Public Health of Switzerland.
