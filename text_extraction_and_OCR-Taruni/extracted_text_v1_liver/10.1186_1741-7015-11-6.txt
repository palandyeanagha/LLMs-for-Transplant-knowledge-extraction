Abstract
Background: Since 2009, several studies have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near the gene
encoding for interleukin (IL)-28 (IL28B) that are strongly associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced
hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance. Because this large amount of data includes some inconsistencies, we consider
assessment of the global estimate for each SNP to be essential.
Methods: Relevant studies assessing IL28B polymorphisms associated with sustained virologic response (SVR) and
spontaneous clearance (SC) were identified from a literature search of PubMed up to 9 July, 2012. Studies were
eligible studies if they included patients infected with HCV or HCV/HIV, or assessed any SNP located within or near
the IL28B gene, SVR data available under standard treatment, and/or SC data in patients with acute HCV infection.
Pooled odds ratios were estimated by fixed or random effects models when appropriate. Variables such as HCV
genotype, ethnicity, and type of co-infection were studied.
Results: Of 282 screened studies, 67 were selected for SVR and 10 for SC. In total, 20,163 patients were studied for
SVR and 3,554 for SC. For SVR, we found that all SNPs showed strong associations in patients with HCV genotypes
1 and 4, whereas the pooled ORs were almost three times lower for genotypes 2 and 3 (rs12979860 and
rs8099917). Regarding ethnicity, the SNP most associated with SVR was rs12979860 in white patients, whereas in
East Asians it seemed to be rs8099917. The most studied SNP (rs12979860) showed similar results for patients coinfected with HCV/HIV, as for those infected with HCV only. Finally, rs12979860 and rs8099917 both appeared to be
associated with SC.
Conclusions: IL28B polymorphisms influence both the outcome of interferon treatment and the natural clearance
of HCV. However we did not identify a universal predictor SNP, as the best genetic markers differed depending on
patient ethnicity, genotype, and type of infection. Nevertheless, our results may be useful for more precise
treatment decision-making.

Background
Currently, over 200 million people worldwide are
chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) [1].
HCV is an important cause of acute and chronic hepatitis, with only 20% of patients have spontaneous clearance (SC) of the virus. Unfortunately, around a quarter
of all patients will progress to develop cirrhosis. Other
complications such as co-infection with HIV are common among patients infected with HCV, because both
viruses share the same routes of transmission [2].
To date, the mechanisms underlying HCV infection
have not been completely defined. Over the past few decades, several host and viral factors have been found to be
associated with differences in HCV clearance or persistence. However, an unexplained variability in treatment * Correspondence: majimenezsousa@yahoo.es; sresino@isciii.es

outcome still exists, suggesting that the genetic background of the host plays an important role [1].
Nowadays, the standard of care for chronic HCV infection consists of pegylated interferon -a plus ribavirin
(PEG-IFN/RBV). However, this treatment produces sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in only about 40 to
50% of patients with HCV genotype 1 and approximately
60% in those infected with genotype 4, whereas over 80%
of patients with genotypes 2 or 3 achieve SVR [2]. PEGIFN/RBV treatment is prolonged and costly, and is associated with dose-limiting side-effects, highlighting the
need for accurate prediction of treatment failure.
Recently, three independent groups discovered several
strongly correlated single genetic polymorphisms (SNPs)
that, together with standard therapy, seem to play a role in
clearing the virus [3-5]. These polymorphisms are located
close to the interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene on chromosome
19. IL28B encodes IFN-l3, which induces antiviral activity
by itself and through the Janus kinase-signal transducer
and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) complex,
which induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that also have
antiviral activity against HCV [6]. Beyond their identification, little is known about the mechanisms involved
between these genomic variants and viral clearance. However, it has been shown that unfavorable IL28B genetic
variations are associated with higher pre-activated levels of
ISGs, which could explain the poor response in these
patients [7,8].
Interest in this gene has led to a large number of publications showing IL28B polymorphisms as having an influence on HCV clearance. However, conflicting conclusions
have been reached in some cases, with some studies
reporting significant associations, and others reporting no
such associations [9-11].
The aim of this study was to elucidate the pooled estimated effect of IL28B polymorphisms on PEG-IFN/RBV
treatment response and SC, by conducting a meta-analysis
of all eligible studies published up to 9 July 2012.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
Relevant studies were identified by a literature search of
PubMed without imposing study-period restrictions, using
the following terms: ‘hepatitis C’, ‘IL28B’, ‘SNP’, ‘spontaneous clearance’, ‘treatment’, ‘ribavirin’ and ‘interferon’
(for the complete electronic search strategy, see Additional
file 1). The information contained in this report is based
on articles published before 9 July 2012 in any language.
The meta-analysis was conducted following the guidelines
published by Sutton et al. [12], and the data are reported
in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [13].
We developed strict inclusion and exclusion criteria
before reviewing the studies and extracting the data in
order to ensure maximum possible homogeneity
between studies. Only articles satisfying the following
criteria were further evaluated by two independent
reviewers: 1) patients infected with HCV or HCV/HIV;
2) any SNP located within or near the IL28B gene; and
3) SVR data available for patients receiving standard
treatment or d) SC data available for patients with acute
HCV infections. Exclusion criteria were: 1) treatment
duration of less than 24 weeks; 2) co-infection with
HBV; 3) studies that included patients with organ transplantation; 4) studies with sample sizes of less than 40
subjects; 5) SVR data reported by methods other than
PCR; 6) HCV genotypes other than 1, 2, 3 or 4.
To select the candidate studies, we carefully screened
the title and abstract of each citation. When articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, we examined the full text and
extracted data from the study. When studies included
several subgroups that did not all fulfill the inclusion criteria, we only incorporated into the meta-analysis those
subgroups that did meet the inclusion criteria.
Data extraction
Two investigators independently assessed the selected
papers and extracted all data. When data were unclear or
required assumptions to be made, another investigator was
consulted, so that a consensus could be reached before
recording an entry in the database. When more than one
paper studying the same cohort was found, only the study
with the most extensive cohort was reviewed, excluding
the remaining overlapping studies or data (for the extracted
data from each study, see Additional file 2). When incongruent data were detected for one particular variable, they
were discarded. We only included those data that could be
confirmed by their appearance in different parts of the text
(for instance in the main text and the tables).
When articles provided data from patients of different
ethnicities, HCV genotypes, and/or types of infection
(HCV and HCV/HIV), these data were divided into subgroups, with each subgroup identified by a sequential letter. Regarding ethnicity, subjects were grouped into the
main racial group of the study population based on their
geographical origin or ancestry [14]. Studies with more
than 99% of the study population described as Caucasian
were considered to be Caucasian. For data presentation,
genotypes 1 and 4 were considered to be in the same
subgroup because of their similarity in response and the
same applied for genotypes 2 and 3 [15].
To compare results between studies on fibrosis, we
used 4 to 6 Ishak levels for the scale of fibrosis corresponding to a METAVIR score of 3 to 4. HCV viral load
data were collected at pre-treatment.

Only patients who had an absence of detectable serum
HCV RNA by PCR 24 weeks after treatment cessation
were considered to have achieved SVR. For SC, patients
with acute HCV infection who had undetectable levels
HCV RNA on repeated examination without prior IFN
therapy were considered to have spontaneously resolved
the infection.
In an attempt to include the majority of studies and to
complete any missing data, we contacted some authors
of individual studies.
Quality appraisal
To evaluate the quality of the included studies, two
investigators appraised them independently using a
checklist based on the Graphic Appraisal Tool for Epidemiological studies (GATE) [16]. Each item was rated
as +1 (well reported and reliable), 0 (unclear, insufficient
detail provided) or -1 (poorly reported, not useful or
reliable). The overall validity of each study was also
rated by a similar system: +1 (most of the quality items
were fulfilled), 0 (some criteria were not fulfilled), or -1
(few or none of the items were fulfilled).
Statistical analysis
We calculated whether all studied SNPs in the present
meta-analysis concurred with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) [17] using the c2 test, with equilibrium
considered at P > 0.05.
Overall, meta-analyses were performed only when two
or more papers studying the same SNP were available. In
all analyses, pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated (favorable homozygous versus heterozygous plus unfavorable homozygous). The significance of the pooled OR was calculated by the Z-test,
and was considered significant at P < 0.05. A fixed effect
model (the traditional Mantel-Haenszel test) was used for
homogeneous studies [18]. The heterogeneity of each
group of ORs was assessed by the c2 test, which suggests
the presence of heterogeneity when P < 0.1. Heterogeneity
was quantified with the I
2 metric, which provides a measure of the degree of inconsistency in the studies’ results
(I
2 > 50% indicated considerable heterogeneity). When significant heterogeneity existed, a random-effects model (the
DerSimonian and Laird method [19]), was used, and a
subgroup meta-analysis and forest plot based on ethnicity,
HCV genotype, and co-infection data (HCV or HCV/HIV)
were performed to identify the effect modifiers [20].
Moreover, the Galbraith plot was used to detect possible
outliers of the heterogeneity, which could have biased the
combined estimate. This graphical method allowed those
studies that had a strong influence on the pooled results
to be checked [21,22]. Trials outside the Galbraith limits
were trials where the 95% CI did not contain the pooled
estimate.
In addition, when heterogeneity was detected, metaregression analysis was also performed, with the aim of
defining the potential effect of the covariates on spontaneous or treatment-related clearance. The regression coefficient obtained describes how SC or SVR changes with
each unit increase in the covariate. Significance of the linearity relationship between SC or SVR and the covariate
was identified by the P-value; the adjusted R2 term indicates the proportion of between-study variance explained
by the included variable. The evaluated variables were as
follows: genotype (1/4 versus 2/3), ethnicity (Caucasian
versus other, and Caucasian versus East Asian), type of
viral infection (HCV mono-infection versus HCV/HIV coinfection), viral load (HCV RNA < 6 log10 versus HCV
RNA ≥ 6 log10), advanced fibrosis F3/F4 (≤ 30% versus >
30%), and prior HCV treatment (naive versus previous
HCV treatment failures).
Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and the
Egger linear regression test [23,24], which detects funnel
plot asymmetry. When the Egger test reported a P < 0.05,
publication bias was assumed to exist.
Sensitivity analyses [24] were also conducted to assess
the consistency of results and to investigate the influence
of one study on the overall meta-analysis. It was carried
out by sequential omission of individual studies.
All analyses were performed using Stata software (version 11.0; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Studies and data included in the meta-analysis
The literature search identified 282 publications (Figure 1).
After initial screening and removal of duplicates (n = 1),
207 articles were rejected based on the title/abstract (n =
82) or the full text (n = 125), because they did not meet
the inclusion criteria. This left 74 studies that were eligible
for inclusion (see Additional file 2), comprising 67 that
were selected for SVR meta-analysis [5,9-11,25-87] and 10
for SC meta-analysis [26,28,65,88-94].; 3 of these studies
were included in both analyses [26,28,65]. Regarding the
quality appraisal of the included studies for SVR, 21 were
rated as +1, 43 as 0, and two as -1 (see Additional file 3),
and for SC, four studies were rated as +1 and six as 0 (see
Additional file 4).
To date, 21 polymorphisms within or near IL28B have
been investigated in relation to SVR (rs688187, rs4803
219, rs4803221, rs4803223, rs4803224, rs7248668, rs724
8931, rs8099917, rs8103142, rs8105790, rs8109886, rs10
853727, rs10853728, rs11881222, rs12972991, rs1297
9860, rs12980275, rs12980602, rs12982533, rs28416813,
rs35790907). Those polymorphisms genotyped only in
one study had to be discarded from the meta-analysis
because of the impossibility of performing statistical
analysis. This was the case for two SNPs from Chen et
al. (2011) [37] (rs28416813 and rs4803219); and ten

from Smith et al. (2011) [52] (rs12980602, rs12982533,
rs35790907, rs4803221, rs4803224, rs688187, rs7248931,
rs8109886, rs12972991, and rs10853727). With respect to
SC, one SNP from Renda et al. (2011) [90] (rs8103142)
and five from Rao et al. (rs10853728, rs11881222,
rs4803219, rs4803223, rs8105790) were excluded. In summary, eight polymorphisms were analyzed in the present
study (see Additional file 5). All of the studied SNPs
fulfilled the HWE, except for rs12979860, rs11881222,
rs8103142, and rs10853728.

The most studied IL28B SNPs and their favorable genotypes for SVR were: rs12979860 (CC), rs8099917 (TT),
and rs12980275 (AA). The rs12979860 polymorphism
was assessed in 12,184 patients from 42 studies;
rs8099917 was assessed in 11,839 patients from 39 studies; and rs12980275 was assessed in 2,786 patients from
6 studies. For the SC analysis, 2,340 patients from 7 studies and 1,783 patients from 4 studies were analyzed for
rs12979860 and rs8099917, respectively.
Baseline characteristics
The publication year of the studies ranged from 2009 to
2012 (see Additional file 2 for a summary of the baseline
characteristics of the included publications for SVR (n =
67) and SC (n = 10), respectively). The studies were mostly
conducted with Caucasian and Asian populations. Nearly
50% of the studies included only patients with genotype 1,
whereas patients with genotype 4 were infrequently studied. As regards the type of infection, most of the articles
studied patients infected with HCV only, whereas patients
co-infected with HCV/HIV were assessed for SVR in only
seven articles and for SC in only one article, which was
mixed.
When articles were divided into subgroups, each one
was identified by a sequential letter (see Additional file 6).
Publication bias test results
Following recommendations for correct funnel-plot interpretation, SNPs found in less than 10 articles should not
be evaluated for publication bias [95], thus, publication
bias was only analyzed for rs12979860 and rs8099917 for
SVR. Funnel-plot results (Figure 2) and Egger test results
(see Additional file 7) showed that there was statistical significance in publication bias only for rs8099917 (P =
0.005) in the SVR meta-analysis.
Overall and subgroup meta-analysis
We performed two overall meta-analyses separately for
SVR and SC, with all data grouped by polymorphism.
When heterogeneity was identified, we stratified the data
into subgroups according to ethnicity (African, African
American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and North African),
HCV genotype (1/4, 2/3, and mix) and type of viral infection (HCV or HCV/HIV) (Table 1). In parallel, we performed meta-regression analysis to investigate the possible
influence of several variables on the heterogeneity. Genotype and allele frequencies from all analyzed IL28B SNPs
were also stratified by ethnicity (see Additional file 8).
Sustained virologic response
Sensitivity analysis was carried out using sequential
omission of individual studies to investigate the influence of each individual study on the overall meta-analysis (Figure 3).
rs12979860 In total, 42 studies reported data for
rs12979860 (Table 1; see Additional file 9). The pooled
OR for overall data was 3.77 (95% CI = 3.25 to 4.37)
and there was heterogeneity (P < 0.001; I
2 = 52.3%).
When the Galbraith plot was analyzed, two outliers of
heterogeneity were identified (Moghaddam et al. [11]
and Thompson et al. [25]) (Figure 4). A forest plot
omitting the mentioned outlier studies was constructed,
which reduced heterogeneity (I
2 = 47.54%), but the significance of the OR was not altered (P < 0.001; OR =
3.78; 95% CI = 3.36 to 4.24). In addition, sensitivity analysis showed that none of the 42 studies should be
omitted from subsequent statistical analysis. Based on
these results and population characteristics, we did not
find enough reasons to discard the papers of Moghaddam et al. [11] and Thompson et al. [25] from subsequent analysis.
When forest plots were constructed based on ethnicity,
HCV genotype, and type of viral infection, we obtained
the following data:
• Ethnicity: Africans (OR = 3.75; 95% CI = 1.60 to
8.79), African Americans (OR = 3.19;; 95% CI = 0.99 to
10.29), Asians (OR = 3.27; 95% CI = 2.21 to 4.84), Caucasians (OR = 3.63; 95% CI = 4.01 to 4.37), Hispanics
(OR = 7.17; 95% CI = 0.56 to 92.34), North Africans
(OR = 1.67; 95% CI = 0.52 to 5.38), and mixed (OR =
3.95; 95% CI = 2.68 to 5.83) (see Additional file 10).
Note that the subgroup results for Africans (n = 1) [62],
African Americans (n = 2) [25,59], Hispanics (n = 2)
[9,25], and North Africans (n = 1) [78] are based on
analysis of a very small number of studies, therefore
there is uncertainty associated with the estimates
reported.
• HCV genotype: genotype 1/4 (OR = 4.20; 95% CI =
3.61 to 4.90), genotype 2/3 (OR = 1.59; 95% CI = 1.14
to 2.21), and mixed (OR = 3.97; 95% CI = 3.30 to 4.77)
(see Additional file 11). The difference between genotypes 1/4 and 2/3 was significant.
Data for OR (95% CI) were separated by both HCV
genotype and ethnicity simultaneously (see Additional
file 12). These data can only provide limited insight,
because very few articles presented data independently
for both variables.
• Type of viral infection: HCV mono-infected (OR =
3.55; 95% CI = 3.04 to 4.14) and HCV/HIV co-infected
(OR = 4.07; 95% CI = 2.66 to 6.21) (see Additional file 13).
Subgroup analysis showed that HCV genotype was the
only significant cause of heterogeneity between all the studied variables, as the overall analysis was heterogeneous,
whereas the subgroup analysis was homogeneous. These
data were confirmed by meta-regression, where only the
variance between studies attributable to HCV genotype
was significant (adjusted R2 = 83.61%; P < 0.001).

rs8099917 There were 39 eligible studies reporting data
on rs8099917 (Table 1, see Additional file 14). The pooled
OR for overall data was 3.86 (95% CI = 3.18 to 4.69) and
the overall heterogeneity was also significant (P < 0.001;
I
2 = 71.9%). When the Galbraith plot was constructed
(Figure 4), six outliers of the heterogeneity were identified:
five studies grouped together (all Asians with genotype 1
and most Japanese patients) and one study (Moghaddam
et al. [11]), which was also an outlier for the rs12979860
analysis. By excluding these six studies from the analysis,
similar pooled OR and significance was obtained (OR =
3.28; 95% CI = 2.81 to 3.83; P < 0.001) and heterogeneity
was still detected (I
2 = 56.23%). Likewise, sensitivity analysis showed that none of the 39 studies should be omitted
from subsequent statistical analysis.
When forest plots were performed based on ethnicity,
HCV genotype, and type of viral infection, we obtained
the following data:
• Ethnicity: Africans (OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 0.88 to 4.65),
Asians (OR = 4.82; 95% CI = 3.80 to 6.11), Caucasians
(OR = 2.71; 95% CI = 2.07 to 3.54), Hispanics (OR =
11.25; 95% CI = 3.51 to 36.00), and mixed (OR = 2.27;
95% CI = 1.52 to 3.38). There was only one publication
dealing with a Hispanic population [9], therefore the result
relates entirely to this study (Additional file 15). With
regard to the Asian and Caucasian subgroups, there was
still heterogeneity (I
2 = 60.3% and 50.8 respectively),
which could be due to the mixture of HCV genotypes
within each group.
• HCV genotype: genotype 1/4 (OR = 4.55; 95% CI =
3.76 to 5.52), genotype 2/3 (OR = 1.59; 95% CI = 1.22 to
2.08), and mixed (OR = 3.43; 95% CI = 2.36 to 5.00) (see
Additional file 16). Again, as was shown for rs12979860,
the difference between genotype 1/4 and 2/3 was
significant.
• Type of viral infection: HCV mono-infected (OR =
3.78; 95% CI = 3.14 to 4.57), HCV/HIV co-infected (OR =
3.70; 95% CI = 0.96 to 14.31), and mixed (pooled patients
with HCV mono-infection, and patients with HCV/HIV
co-infection; OR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.10 to 3.92). It must be
taken into account that heterogeneity within the monoinfected subgroup was still high (I
2 = 65.3%). Regarding
HCV/HIV co-infected and mixed subgroups, only a few
studies were included (n = 3 and n = 1, respectively),
therefore care needs to be taken with the estimates
reported (see Additional file 17).
Meta-regression analysis indicated the proportion of significant variance accounting for each different covariate:
ethnicity (Caucasians versus Asians: adjusted R2 = 26.00%;
P = 0.002), HCV genotype (adjusted R2 = 51.57%; P <
0.001), and advanced fibrosis (adjusted R2 = 32.64%; P =
0.016). Type of infection and baseline HCV viral load did
not seem to influence the heterogeneity (P = 0.992 and
P = 0.087 respectively).
rs12980275 The pooled OR for overall data was 3.95;
95% CI = 2.39 to 6.53) and the heterogeneity was significant (P < 0.001; I2 = 77.7%) (Table 1, Additional file
18). Galbraith plot identified Tanaka et al. [5] as an outlier of the heterogeneity (data not shown); however, the
low number of studies prevented us from drawing firm
conclusions about this analysis.
Subgroup analysis was performed based on ethnicity,
HCV genotype, and type of infection. We obtained the following data:
• Ethnicity: Asians (OR = 5.00; 95% CI = 1.65 to
15.11), Caucasians (OR = 3.44; 95% CI = 1.38 to 8.57),
Hispanics (OR = 8.84; 95% CI = 2.76 to 28.34), and
mixed (OR = 1.46; 95% CI = 0.50 to 4.24). However, it
has to be noted that only two studies were available for
the Asian (n = 2 [5,37]) subgroup and only one each for

the Hispanic [9] and mixed [28] subgroups (see Additional file 19).
• HCV genotype: genotype 1/4 (OR = 6.33; 95% CI =
2.64 to 15.16), genotype 2/3 (OR = 1.78; 95% CI = 0.38 to
8.25), and mixed (OR = 2.44; 95% CI = 1.38 to 4.32). With
respect to the 2/3 and mixed genotype, the data came
from only two subgroups and two studies respectively (see
Additional file 20).
Regarding type of viral infection, all rs12980275 studies dealt with patients with HCV mono-infection,
except the report by Grebely et al. [28], in which data
from patients with HCV mono-infection and HCV/HIV
co-infection were pooled. For this reason, subgroup analyses by type of infection were not carried out.
Using sensitivity analysis (Figure 3), we found that the
Fischer et al. study [67] on rs12980275 apparently influenced the overall results, and thus a new statistical analysis was performed excluding that paper (data not
shown). This influence seemed to affect only genotype
1/4, where heterogeneity was reduced to 0%. Results for
genotype 1/4 varied slightly (OR = 9.13; 95% CI = 5.84
to 14.26), although the significance of the OR was not
altered. Based on these results and on the population
characteristics, we cannot offer any explanation for
excluding the Fischer et al. study.
Other single-nucleotide polymorphisms Five polymorphisms (rs11881222, rs7248668, rs8103142, rs8105
790, rs10853728) were only described in three studies or
fewer, leading to less robust meta-analysis results (see
Additional files 21 to 25). The pooled OR data were 2.99
(95% CI = 2.31 to 3.87) for rs11881222, 3.87 (95% CI =
2.74 to 5.47) for rs7248668, 2.62 (95% CI = 1.97 to 3.49)
for rs8103142, 2.15 (95% CI = 1.61 to 2.86) for rs8105790,
and 1.20 (95% CI = 0.82 to 1.76) for rs10853728. There
was no heterogeneity except for rs10853728 (P = 0.061;
I
2 = 64.3%), but we could not perform heterogeneity analysis by subgroup and/or meta-regression because
rs10853728 was genotyped in only three of the studies.
We also recorded all the polymorphisms that were studied in only one study each. Twelve SNPs were reported,

with ORs ranging from 1.19 to 9.96; however, only eight
of these were significant (rs35790907 (AA), rs12972991
(AA), rs12982533 (TT), rs688187 (GG), rs4803221 (CC),
rs8109886 (CC), rs12980602 (TT), and rs4803219 (CC);
see Additional file 26).
Spontaneous clearance
rs12979860 The overall pooled OR was 3.20 (95% CI =
2.03 to 5.05) (Table 1; see Additional file 27). Heterogeneity was detected (P < 0.001; I
2 = 81.8%), therefore,
subgroup analysis was performed based on ethnicity and
HCV genotype.
• Ethnicity: Asians (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 0.79 to 2.15)
and Caucasians (OR = 3.78; 95% CI = 2.60 to 5.50) (see
Additional file 28).
• HCV genotype: genotype 1 (OR = 5.66; 95% CI =
3.28 to 9.77), mixed (OR = 2.34; 95% CI = 1.48 to 3.69)
and unknown (OR = 2.96; 95% CI = 1.75 to 5.02) (see
Additional file 29).
It must be taken into consideration that the results for
Asian patients and for genotype 1 correspond to one
and two studies, respectively. For Caucasians, a high
level of heterogeneity was detected (I
2 = 67.9%).
Sensitivity analysis (Figure 3) showed that the study by
Dring et al. [88] might be influencing the overall statistical analysis. For this reason, we also analyzed the data
after removing this study. The results were similar and
the significance of the OR was not altered. Based on
these results and to the population characteristics, there
was no reason to exclude this study.
rs8099917 Only four studies reported data for rs8099917
(Table 1; see Additional file 30). Sensitivity analysis
showed that none of the four studies should be omitted
from subsequent statistical analysis. Pooled OR was 3.60
(95% CI = 2.70 to 4.81), and there was no heterogeneity.
rs12980275 Two studies reported very different data for
rs12980275, leading to non-significant results (OR =
2.73; 95% CI = 0.33 to 22.38) and high heterogeneity
(I
2 = 81.5%) (Table 1; see Additional file 31).
Other single-nucleotide polymorphisms We also
recorded all the polymorphisms for SC that were analyzed

sequential omission of individual studies.

in only one study each. In total, seven SNPs were reported,
with ORs ranging from 1.19 to 14.88; however, only four
of them (rs10853728 (CC), rs12980275 (AA), rs8105790
(TT), rs8103142 (TT)) were significant, although most of
them had very high CIs (see Additional file 32).
Discussion
There is growing evidence that polymorphisms can contribute to differences in complex disease traits between individuals. Since 2009, several studies have shown that there
is an important association between IL28B polymorphisms
and HCV clearance. However, the mechanism of this association remains unclear, and is still under study.
To our knowledge, a total of five reviews containing
data from meta-analyses have been published to date
about the relationship between IL28B polymorphisms
and SVR [96-100]. The reports of Romero-Gomez et al.
and Li et al. are limited because they involved literature
searches only up to January and May 2010, respectively,
leading to the selection of a low number of studies in
both cases (only seven studies). In addition, all metaanalyses were performed for rs12979860 and rs8099917
only. The other three meta-analyses were broader, ranging from 17 to 36 studies. However, all of them analyzed only the effect of the IL28B polymorphisms
rs12979860 and rs8099917 on SVR by ethnicity and
HCV genotype, while the study by Scheiber et al. was
limited to HCV genotypes 2 and 3. In addition, the literature searches of these meta-analyses included publications only up to the end of 2011. Consequently, our
meta-analysis provides the most up-to-date compilation
of studies, including 74 articles, a larger number of
SNPs, and association analysis with other clinical situations such as SC. In addition, this is the first metaanalysis investigating the association between IL28B
polymorphisms and SC, to our knowledge. Therefore,
because there has been a very large increase in the number of papers, especially in 2012, it is necessary to assess
all data and elucidate controversial or inconclusive
results. This meta-analysis has allowed us to estimate
the overall OR of all studies, and functions as a robust
tool to investigate discrepant results.
Based on the global analysis, there was a significant
association between the favorable genotype of seven studied SNPs (rs12979860, rs8099917, rs12980275,
rs8105790, rs11881222, rs8103142, and rs7248668) and
SVR. In most of the cases, the probability of achieving
SVR in patients with a favorable genotype was more
than double that in patients with an unfavorable genotype. Although the majority of results had similarities,
the magnitude of the association was different in many
cases. This could be caused by the different criteria considered in each individual study. For this reason, our
meta-analysis focused on displaying general conclusions
about the trend of this association. Moreover, we investigated several variables that might contribute to the different magnitude of associations found in different
studies.
IL28B and ethnicity
The significant genetic association of all IL28B SNPs
seems to be due to the high linkage disequilibrium (LD)
of this genomic region [3-5], which varies across ethnicities. Regarding the Asian population, some authors have
described strong LDs between rs12980275, rs8105790,
rs11881222, rs8099917, rs7248668, rs10853728, and
rs12979860 [5,37]. For Caucasian populations, the results
are slightly more diverse depending on the genotyped
Figure 4 Galbraith plot. Detection of studies acting as possible sources of heterogeneity for rs12979860 and rs8099917 for sustained virologic
response (SVR). Trials outside the Galbraith limits were trials where the 95% confidence interval did not contain the pooled estimate.

platform used. Thus, Ge et al. [3] reported a strong LD
between rs12979860 and rs12980275, whereas Suppiah et
al. [4] reported that rs12980275 is strictly linked to
rs8105790, rs8103142, rs8109886, and rs8099917. Finally,
there was a low LD between rs12979860 and rs12980275
for African Americans (r2 = 0.56), whereas for Hispanics,
a higher LD (r2 = 0.88) was obtained [3]. Our results
have shown that in respect to the favorable IL28B genotype frequency of rs12979860, there was a marked differential distribution between racial groups (in order from
highest to lowest frequency): Asian, Caucasian, North
African, Hispanic, African, and African American.
Regarding rs8099917, the order was similar, except for
African populations, which showed frequencies that were
intermediate between Asians and Caucasians, as shown
by Thompson et al. [25]. This differential distribution
seems to explain much of the observed clinical differences between ethnic groups in response to treatment
[101].
We found similar association for rs12979860 for
Asians (OR = 3.27) and Caucasians (OR = 3.63). The
strength of the association in Asians was almost double
that for Caucasians for rs8099917. Similarly, in the case
of rs12980275, a larger OR was seen for Asians than for
Caucasians. However, rs12980275 was only represented
by two studies in Asians and four in Caucasians, therefore the most reliable results and the most robust conclusions were obtained for rs12979860 and rs8099917.
It is also important to note that in our study, the significant association between favorable genotypes and
SVR was lost in several instances, such as for
rs12979860 in African American and Hispanic patients.
However, these data should also be interpreted with
caution, because only two studies were included for
each ethnicity [9,25,59]. Regarding African Americans,
the results were right at the limit of significance (OR =
3.19; P = 0.052), which may be related to the low LD
described for African Americans. Owing to the scarcity
of available results, new studies in these populations are
necessary, especially ones that investigate the effects of
different SNPs. For Hispanics, both studies individually
showed a significant association, but this significance
was lost upon performing the meta-analysis. This could
be due to the extremely wide confidence interval of the
Venegas et al. study [9]. On the other hand, rs8099917
and rs12980275 seem to be strongly associated for Hispanic populations; however, these results corresponded
to only one study, which prevents us from drawing any
firm conclusions.
IL28B and hepatitis C virus genotype
To date, a broad association between favorable IL28B
genotypes and SVR has been described in patients
infected with HCV genotype 1 [50,102], with a similar
association described for genotype 4, although this has
been less studied. However, conflicting results have been
published about HCV genotypes 2/3 [33,41]. One of our
goals was to discern the pooled significance of such an
association, which would have relevance to the decision
of initiating therapy. As expected, we found that the
favorable genotypes of polymorphisms rs12979860,
rs8099917, and rs12980275 were positively associated
with SVR for HCV genotypes 1 and 4. Regarding the
HCV genotypes 2 and 3, the polymorphisms rs12979860
and rs8099917 showed significant associations. However,
the strength of this association was almost three times
lower than for genotypes 1 and 4, and in addition, we
found that the Asian population was solely responsible
for this association in rs8099917. The generally reduced
association for patients with HCV genotypes 2/3 could
be related to the high rate of SVR present in these IFNsensitive genotypes, for which larger sample sizes are
required to find significant differences [7]. In summary,
our findings show that IL28B polymorphisms are a
strong pre-treatment predictor for SVR in patients with
HCV genotypes 1 and 4, but its usefulness is limited for
other genotypes.
IL28B and type of viral infection
The predictive value of IL28B polymorphisms has been
extensively studied in patients with HCV mono-infection,
but only seven eligible studies included patients with
HIV/HCV co-infection [28,29,35,42,61,63,85]. After stratifying by type of infection, we found that in patients coinfected with HIV/HCV, the strength of association
between rs12979860 and SVR was similar to that for
patients with HCV mono-infection. For rs8099917, only
the study by Aparicio et al. [29] provided data for
patients with HIV/HCV co-infection, which was also
divided by HCV genotypes (1, 3, and 4). This study did
not show any overall significant association, but when we
analyzed the data in more depth, we found differences
related to HCV genotype, with only HCV genotype 1
being significantly associated with SVR. Therefore, the
benefit of IL28B genotyping seems to apply to both
patients with HCV genotype 1 mono-infection and coinfection. HIV/HCV co-infection could play a significant
role in treatment response, but further studies are necessary to confirm this. Again, results should be interpreted
with caution.
IL28B polymorphisms and spontaneous clearance of
hepatitis C virus
The identification of markers predicting the persistence
of HCV infection is very important to distinguish
between patients whose acute hepatitis C resolves and
those who develop a chronic hepatitis C infection.
Roughly, 20% of patients infected with HCV have SC of
Jiménez-Sousa et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/6
Page 11 of 18

the virus. The mechanism of this is not clear, but epidemiological, viral, and host factors have all been associated with the difference in HCV clearance likelihood.
Thomas et al. [103] showed that rs12979860 strongly
enhances the likelihood of clearance of HCV among
individuals of either European or African ancestry. However, to date, few articles about the IL28B polymorphisms involved in SC have been written. Owing to the
low number of published articles, we could perform
meta-analyses only for rs12979860 and rs8099917. In
both cases, a clear association was detected. These
results seem completely plausible because all individual
studies analyzed showed significant associations for
rs12979860 and rs8099917, except for Asian populations, which were represented by only one study [94].
Stratification was possible only for rs12979860. Regarding ethnicity, significant results were obtained only for
Caucasians, with similar pooled OR as for SVR.
With respect to HCV genotype, a strong association was
detected for rs12979860 in HCV genotype 1. It has been
shown that HCV genotype influences hepatitis C chronicity, as patients infected with genotype 1/4 who harbor
favorable IL28B genotypes are less likely to have chronic
HCV infection. By contrast, this protective effect is not
seen for infections with either genotypes 2 or 3 [1]. Because
of insufficient data, we could not perform a stratified study
on other HCV genotypes or ethnicity. Additional studies
on these variables are needed to clarify this association.
IL28B polymorphisms as clinical predictors
During the past number of years, the main focus in HCV
infection has been the identification of markers or factors
predicting the likelihood of achieving SVR. Recently, some
countries have incorporated IL28B genotyping as a diagnostic criterion in clinical practice [7]. In those patients
with unfavorable IL28B genotypes, which result in
response rates of less than 40%, clinicians may consider
deferral of treatment until novel therapies are licensed,
something likely to occur soon [7]. However, IL28B genotype is not solely responsible for therapy response. Indeed,
our meta-regression data suggested that several other factors such as ethnicity, HCV genotype, and stage of fibrosis
might have a significant effect on SVR and/or SC.
Recently, a model including IL28B genotype (rs12979860)
and four clinical variables (pre-treatment viral load, ratio
of alanine and aspartate transaminases, Ishak fibrosis
score, and previous treatment with ribavirin) has been
developed [51]. This model predicts SVR in patients of
European ancestry with HCV genotype 1 who have failed
to respond to previous treatment [51]. This algorithm has
shown a high predictive ability, but as the authors pointed
out, it could be improved in future studies by including
other relevant variables such as ethnicity and HCV genotype. Another predictive model has been described for
patients with HCV/HIV co-infection, including two hostrelated variables (the IL28B SNP rs12979860 and the level
of liver stiffness) and two HCV-related variables (genotype
and viral load) [104]. This model was found to have an
adequate predictive index, but it could also be enhanced
by incorporating HIV variables such as viral load. Apart
from the aforementioned variables, it would be of great
value for clinical practice if future algorithms could be
designed that were applicable to different circumstances,
such as naive patients or patients with SC, for instance.
Future directions
The number of studies on new antiviral therapies have
risen in the past few years. Therefore, it would have
been interesting to investigate whether IL28B polymorphisms also play a predictive role in novel therapies
such as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). However, it was
not been possible here because only a few studies have
been published that include data on novel therapies.
Our literature search returned five studies involving triple therapy. Three of them involved standard of care
(PEG-IFN/RBV) with inclusion of telaprevir in the same
cohort [105-107], while the fourth studied the inclusion
of danoprevir [108], and the fifth studied the inclusion
of boceprevir [109]. As we could not perform meta-analysis on these, all of these were excluded. These therapies, which are based on protease inhibitors, are the
most advanced DAAs in clinical development. However,
any influence of IL28B polymorphisms on the outcome
of these novel therapies is not clear. These few studies
have shown that, regardless of treatment history, IL28B
SNPs seem to enhance rapid, early, and SVR when combined with PEG-IFN/RBV in patients with chronic HCV
genotype 1 infection [109,110]. Further studies are
needed to clarify this association.
Finally, to properly interpret our results, some considerations have to be taken into account. Our meta-analysis
was performed by using the unadjusted raw data provided from each study, whereas most of the results given
by the authors were previously adjusted by age, fibrosis
stage, HCV viral load, and/or other factors. For this reason, our ORs may differ slightly from those cited by the
original articles. For rs8099917, we identified publication
bias, which could indicate that smaller studies dealing
with this SNP could have been more likely to be published if their results were significant than if their results
were negative or inconclusive. When heterogeneity was
evaluated, studies were stratified by ethnicity, genotype,
and type of infection, but in some cases heterogeneity
remained, indicating the possibility that different causes
of heterogeneity may exist. As we have previously mentioned, the number of studies in some subgroup analyses
was too small, which led to weak results. As for the five
least studied polymorphisms (rs11881222, rs7248668,
Jiménez-Sousa et al. BMC Medicine 2013, 11:6
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/6
Page 12 of 18

rs8103142, rs8105790, rs10853728), results are limited
and new studies are still needed. Consequently, these
results should be interpreted with caution.
Conclusions
IL28B polymorphisms influence both IFN treatment
outcomes and the natural clearance of HCV infection.
However, although we cannot provide a biological explanation, our findings indicate the most adequate genetic
marker seems to vary depending on ethnicity, HCV genotype, and type of viral infection. Taking into account the
most robust analyses, the SNP most associated with SVR
in Caucasians was rs12979860, whereas in Asians it
seemed to be rs8099917. However, for Africans, African
Americans, North Africans, and Hispanics, extensive studies are still needed. After analyzing the conflicting
results described above for genotypes 2 and 3, our data
seem to indicate that rs8099917 is apparently the most
adequate predictive marker for SVR with these genotypes. For patients with HCV/HIV co-infection, the most
studied SNP (rs12979860) gave similar results to those
seen for patients with HCV mono-infection patients.
Finally, both rs12979860 and rs8099917 were clearly
associated with SC. Moreover, because IL28B genotyping
needs be performed only once in a patient’s life, it is relatively cheap and provides high predictive value. IL28B
polymorphisms could thus be used to perform personalized treatment in clinical practice, which could play a
substantial role in the selection of candidates for standard
treatment versus triple therapy with DAAs.
