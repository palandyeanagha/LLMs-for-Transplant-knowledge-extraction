Abstract
Beneficial microbes and probiotic species, such as Lactobacillus reuteri, produce biologically active compounds that can
modulate host mucosal immunity. Previously, immunomodulatory factors secreted by L. reuteri ATCC PTA 6475 were
unknown. A combined metabolomics and bacterial genetics strategy was utilized to identify small compound(s) produced
by L. reuteri that were TNF-inhibitory. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-high performance liquid
chromatography (HILIC-HPLC) separation isolated TNF-inhibitory compounds, and HILIC-HPLC fraction composition was
determined by NMR and mass spectrometry analyses. Histamine was identified and quantified in TNF-inhibitory HILIC-HPLC
fractions. Histamine is produced from L-histidine via histidine decarboxylase by some fermentative bacteria including
lactobacilli. Targeted mutagenesis of each gene present in the histidine decarboxylase gene cluster in L. reuteri 6475
demonstrated the involvement of histidine decarboxylase pyruvoyl type A (hdcA), histidine/histamine antiporter (hdcP), and
hdcB in production of the TNF-inhibitory factor. The mechanism of TNF inhibition by L. reuteri-derived histamine was
investigated using Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-activated human monocytoid cells. Bacterial histamine suppressed TNF
production via activation of the H2 receptor. Histamine from L. reuteri 6475 stimulated increased levels of cAMP, which
inhibited downstream MEK/ERK MAPK signaling via protein kinase A (PKA) and resulted in suppression of TNF production by
transcriptional regulation. In summary, a component of the gut microbiome, L. reuteri, is able to convert a dietary
component, L-histidine, into an immunoregulatory signal, histamine, which suppresses pro-inflammatory TNF production.
The identification of bacterial bioactive metabolites and their corresponding mechanisms of action with respect to
immunomodulation may lead to improved anti-inflammatory strategies for chronic immune-mediated diseases.

Introduction
Microbes that colonize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract produce
diverse extracellular signals such as p40/p75 from Lactobacillus
rhamnosus GG and AI-3 from commensal E. coli. A majority of the
low-molecular weight molecules produced by beneficial microbes
have not been characterized biochemically, but these compounds
modulate specific host immune and physiologic responses [1,2].
Lactobacillus reuteri is a beneficial microbe that is indigenous to the
GI tract of diverse mammalian species including humans, and at
least two different strains are considered probiotics [3,4]. L. reuteri
ATCC PTA 6475 (strain 6475) confers multiple potential benefits
to the human host including the production of antimicrobial
compounds [5,6], biosynthesis of B complex vitamins [7], and the
secretion of immunomodulatory factors [8,9].
Relatively few probiotic-derived compounds with immunomodulatory properties have been identified. Known strain-specific
probiotic immunomodulins include lactic acid, the surface layer A
protein of L. acidophilus NCFM, peptidoglycan-derived muropeptides, and capric acid [10–13]. TNF-inhibitory molecules or
immunomodulins produced by L. reuteri 6475 were previously
unknown. Because probiotic species, including L. reuteri, can target
specific signaling pathways and immune responses, these bacterial
strains may represent future therapeutic agents that could serve to
suppress chronic inflammation. Limited mechanistic studies are a
current barrier to targeted application of probiotics for specific
immune-mediated human diseases, despite the fact that numerous
probiotics have been linked to effects on specific intracellular
signaling pathways in different human and murine cell types [14].
The central limitation is the lack of well-defined molecular signals
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e31951

that are produced by beneficial microbes, and the discovery of
these microbial metabolites will enable the development of new
drugs and probiotics.
Probiotics may affect the disease course of patients with chronic
immune-mediated diseases such as pouchitis or necrotizing
enterocolitis via modulation of the immune system [15–17]. For
example, select probiotic strains suppress secretion of Th1, Th2 or
Th17 cytokines by various immune cells, which may correspondingly diminish patterns of mucosal inflammation in the GI tract
[18,19]. L. reuteri 6475 inhibits production of TNF, a proinflammatory cytokine, from monocyte-derived macrophages
isolated from children with Crohn’s disease as well as TLR2-
and TLR4-activated human and murine monocytoid cell lines
[8,18]. Similar to other probiotics [14], L. reuteri 6475 suppresses
activation of the AP-1 transcription factor, which regulates the
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes in response to
activation of Toll-like receptors [8]. The effects of L. reuteri strains
and other probiotic species on signaling pathways between cell
surface receptors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-
regulated transcription factors, such as AP-1, are unknown and
deserve further exploration.
Engagement of TLRs by microbial-derived signals results in the
activation of the MAPK pathways, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. Activation
of ERK or JNK results in translocation of AP-1 and transcription
of pro-inflammatory genes [20]. ERK signaling affects TNF
production [21]. TLR stimulation results in Ras/c-Raf-dependent
activation of the MEK/ERK pathway [22]. This Ras/c-Rafdependent activation of ERK can be modulated by the cAMP/
protein kinase A (PKA) signaling cascade induced by engagement
of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), and defects in GPCR
signaling may result in chronic colitis [23–25]. In the intestine,
destructive inflammation driven by TNF requires activation of
MAPKs, ERK and p38 [26]. These MAPK signaling pathways
are potential targets for modulation by beneficial microbes,
resulting in suppression of TNF and inflammation.
In this study, we employed a combination of metabolomics and
bacterial genetics approaches to identify potential immunomodulins (TNF-inhibitory factors) produced by L. reuteri 6475. TNFinhibitory compounds were isolated by HILIC-HPLC and
identified by NMR and mass spectrometry. The biogenic amine,
histamine was identified and quantified in TNF-inhibitory HILICHPLC fractions. L. reuteri 6475 possesses three genes potentially
involved in histamine production from the essential amino acid Lhistidine - histidine decarboxylase pyruvoyl type A (hdcA),
histidine/histamine antiporter (hdcP), and hdcB. Gene inactivation
demonstrated that each gene contributes to the TNF-inhibitory
phenotype of strain 6475. Mechanistic studies in human
monocytoid cells revealed that L. reuteri-derived histamine potently
inhibited TNF production via signaling through the histamine H2
receptor, a GPCR that is linked to downstream PKA activity and
MAPK signaling.
Results
Lactobacillus reuteri produces histamine
Compounds with TNF inhibitory activity were isolated from L.
reuteri cell pellets treated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) acidified
water and supernatants from liquid cultures of L. reuteri 6475.
Components of the aqueous TFA-treated cell pellets were
separated based on relative hydrophobicity using HILIC-HPLC.
The fractions were tested for retention of TNF-inhibitory
compounds by activating human monocytoid cells (THP-1) with
a TLR2 agonist in the presence of individual HILIC-HPLC
fractions and monitoring TNF levels by quantitative ELISA. L.
reuteri 6475 grown in a defined medium with glucose (LDMIIIG) as
the sole carbon source produced TNF-inhibitory factors that were
retained in three separate HILIC-HPLC fractions, B3, B5 and B6
(Figure S1A). The B4 fraction consistently lacked TNF-inhibitory
activity.
The TNF-inhibitory HILIC-HPLC fraction B3 was analyzed by
one-dimensional (1D) 1
H NMR and compared to the neighboring
non-TNF-inhibitory fraction B4. A unique series of peaks with a
chemical shift between 7.0–8.0 ppm, which indicate the presence
of aromatic or heterocyclic compounds, were observed in fraction
B3 (Figure 1A, top spectrum) but not in fraction B4 (Figure 1A,
bottom spectrum). To identify the compounds yielding these
peaks, two-dimensional (2D) 1
H-13C-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) data were acquired with fraction B3, and
compounds were identified using MetaboMiner software [27].
The compounds present in fraction B3 were tryptophan (Trp),
phenylalanine (Phe), histamine, and one unknown peak (Figure 1B
and 1C). All observable 1
H-13C cross peaks of these three
compounds are labeled in Figure 1B and 1C, which were identical
to those compounds listed in the database of MetaboMiner.
Compound identification was further confirmed using an
additional 2D NMR method, total correlation spectroscopy
(TOCSY), as shown in Figure 1D. Tryptophan and phenylalanine
were components of the defined bacterial growth medium.
Histidine, but not histamine, was part of the bacterial growth
medium, suggesting that histidine may be converted to histamine
by L. reuteri.
The presence of histamine in the aqueous TFA cell pellet
extracts was confirmed by electrospray time-of-flight mass
spectrometry (ESI qTOF MS). Analysis of fraction B3 from strain
6475 grown in LDMIIIG revealed histamine detected at m/z of
112.09 (Figure 2A). The TNF-inhibitory phenotype of strain 6475
can be altered by different growth conditions. For example, strain
6475 grown in a sucrose-based medium (LDMIIIS) did not
produce identifiable TNF inhibitory factors and demonstrated a
diminished TNF-inhibitory phenotype. Strain 6475 cultivated in
LDMIIIS served as a negative control for these studies (Figure
S1B). Fraction B3 from strain 6475 grown in LDMIIIS did not
contain histamine at m/z of 112.09 (Figure 2B). Histamine was
confirmed as the unique compound in fraction B3 from 6475
grown in LDMIIIG via MS/MS analysis of m/z 112.08
(Figure 2C). Finally, histamine was detected in bacterial cell-free
supernatants from liquid cultures of L. reuteri 6475 grown in
LDMIIIG, suggesting bacterial secretion of histamine (Figure 2D).
Quantification of Lactobacillus reuteri-derived histamine
by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry
Triple quadrupole mass spectrometry is an established method
of quantifying small molecular compounds [28]. This method was
used to quantify histamine in a restricted set of HILIC-HPLC
fractions from aqueous TFA-treated cell pellets of L. reuteri 6475
grown in LDMIIIG. The standard curve used to quantify
histamine is shown in Figure S2. All TNF-inhibitory HILICHPLC fractions (B3, B5, and B6) contained elevated concentrations of histamine (.500 pg/mL), while non-TNF-inhibitory
HILIC-HPLC fractions contained less than 200 pg/mL histamine
(Figure 3). The ‘‘gap’’ in immunomodulatory activity at fraction
B4 correlated with low histamine content when compared to the
neighboring fractions B3, B5, and B6. It is not entirely clear why
histamine eluted in two peaks from the HILIC-HPLC column.
The supernatant from liquid cultures of L. reuteri 6475 grown in
LDMIIIG contained measurable quantities of histamine (approximately 300 pg/mL), whereas the culture supernatant of the same
Histamine Inhibits ERK Activation

strain grown in LDMIIIS had minimal amounts of histamine
(Figure 2D).
The histidine decarboxylase gene cluster contributes to
the TNF-inhibitory phenotype of L. reuteri 6475
Three genes, histidine/histamine antiporter (hdcP), histidine
decarboxylase pyruvoyl type A (hdcA), and hdcB (hdcB) (thought to
catalyze the maturation of HdcA [29]), are clustered together in
the chromosome of L. reuteri 6475. The histidine decarboxylase
gene cluster has been characterized in other Lactobacillus species
[30,31]. Relative expression of the histidine decarboxylase genes in
wild-type 6475 was increased in vitro by supplementing the growth
medium with histidine (Figure S3A). Transcriptomics studies
comparing L. reuteri 6475 grown in LDMIIIS (lacking TNF
inhibition) versus LDMIIIG (retained TNF inhibition) demonstrated significant down-regulation of all three genes in the
presence of sucrose (hdcP: 5.5 fold down-regulated, hdcA: 30.1 fold
down-regulated, hdcB: 11.8 fold down-regulated, p-value,0.05).
Using RecT-dependent recombineering, we introduced in-frame
stop codons in hdcP (locus tag HMPREF0536_1229), hdcA (locus
tag HMPREF0536_1230), and hdcB (locus tag HMPREF0536_
1231) [32,33]. Inactivation of any one of the three genes in the

H NMR of TNF-inhibitory fraction B3 and

histidine decarboxylase gene cluster was sufficient to cause a
partial reduction (approximately 40%) of TNF-inhibition compared to the wild-type 6475 strain (Figure 4), suggesting that each
gene contributes to the TNF-inhibitory phenotype of L. reuteri
6475. No effect on TNF inhibition was seen with inactivation of a
control gene not involved in histamine production (in-frame stop
codon in the RNA polymerase b subunit gene, rpoB; locus tag
HMPREF0536_0828) (Figure 4). Histamine production was
significantly reduced in the histidine decarboxylase mutants
compared to wild-type 6475 despite supplementation with
histidine in the growth medium (Figure S3B). A partial, rather
than complete abrogation of activity in the L. reuteri 6475 histidine
decarboxylase mutants suggests that other active TNF-inhibitory
factors are being produced.
Histamine inhibits TNF production via the H2 receptor
Histamine significantly blocked TNF production (80% inhibition compared to medium control, p-value,0.05) by TLR2-
activated THP-1 cells (Figure 5A). Histamine can activate four
different GPCRs; H1, H2, H3, and H4 receptors. Myeloid cells in
the gut express H1 and H2 receptors and, to a lesser extent, H4
receptors [34]. Previous studies demonstrated that histamine
inhibits TNF production via the H2 receptor [35], and flow
cytometry analysis with histamine receptor-specific antibodies
confirmed that THP-1 cells express H1 and H2 receptors (Figure
S4). Histamine receptor-specific antagonists were used to determine which receptor was mediating the effect of histamine on
TNF production. H2 receptor-specific antagonists, ranitidine and
cimetidine, suppressed TNF-inhibition by histamine in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 5A). H1 receptor-specific
antagonists, chlorpheniramine and pyrilamine, had no effect on
TNF-inhibition by histamine (Figure 5A). L. reuteri 6475 conditioned media (CM) containing histamine significantly inhibited
TNF compared to the medium control (81%, p-value,0.05), and
this effect was partially blocked by antagonists of the H2 receptor
(44–46% TNF inhibition compared to medium control), but not
H1 receptor antagonists (Figure 5A). L. reuteri 6475-derived, TFAtreated, unfractionated cell pellet (CP) containing histamine
suppressed TNF production (92%, p-value,0.05) (Figure 5B).
As seen with strain 6475 CM, H2 receptor antagonists partially
blocked (55–64% TNF inhibition compared to medium control)
the effect of extracellular, cell surface-derived components of strain
6475 (Figure 5B), suggesting that multiple immunomodulins may
be present in the bacterial supernatant and unfractionated cell
Figure 2. The production of histamine by L. reuteri 6475 was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Examination of TNF-inhibitory HILIC-HPLC
fractions from L. reuteri 6475 grown in LDMIIIG confirmed the presence of histamine by ESI qTOF MS. A. ESI qTOF MS of TNF-inhibitory HILIC-HPLC
fraction B3 from strain 6475 grown in glucose. Histamine was detected at m/z 112.08. B. ESI qTOF MS of non-TNF inhibitory HILIC-HPLC fraction B3
from strain 6475 grown in sucrose. Histamine was not detected at m/z 112.08. C. MS/MS analysis of m/z 112.08 confirmed that the compound is
histamine. D. L. reuteri culture supernatants from sucrose or glucose-containing media were analyzed for histamine concentration by triple
quadrupole mass spectrometry. Histamine (pg/mL) was detected only in culture supernatants from glucose-containing medium cultures.

surface preparation. The effect of TNF-inhibitory HILIC-HPLC
fraction B3 (70% inhibition compared to medium control), which
is enriched for histamine, was markedly abrogated by addition of
H2 receptor antagonists (2–17% TNF inhibition compared to
medium control) (Figure 5B). Histamine receptor antagonists alone
did not affect TNF production by TLR2-activated THP-1 cells
(Figure 5C). In addition, H1 receptor antagonists did not prevent
H2 receptor antagonists from blocking the TNF-suppressive
activity of histamine and L. reuteri 6475 CM (Figure 5C).
Histamine increased intracellular cAMP and triggered
PKA signaling that yielded TNF-inhibitory activity
The H2 receptor is a GPCR that can activate adenylate cyclase
(AC) and increase intracellular cAMP [36]. TNF can be inhibited
at the level of transcription by cAMP and cAMP analogs [37].
Therefore, we wanted to determine if stimulating the H2 receptor
in THP-1 cells with L. reuteri-derived histamine would increase
intracellular cAMP and if increased amounts of cAMP would be
sufficient to inhibit TNF production. THP-1 cells were stimulated
with a TLR2 agonist in the presence of medium control, L. reuteri
6475 CM or histamine. These experiments were conducted with
or without an H2 receptor antagonist (ranitidine), and intracellular
levels of cAMP were measured by ELISA. Addition of L. reuteri
6475 CM yielded significantly increased quantities of cAMP in
human monocytoid cells (Figure 6A), whereas treatment with
ranitidine blocked the cAMP-stimulatory effect by L. reuteri. A
similar inhibitory effect of ranitidine was observed with respect to
the ability of histamine to elevate cAMP concentrations
(Figure 6A). To determine if elevated cAMP could suppress
TNF, a synthetic analog of cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP (dcAMP), was
added to TLR2-stimulated THP-1 cells at varying concentrations.
The addition of 10–1000 nM dcAMP significantly inhibited TNF
production (Figure S5). Stimulation of the histamine H2 receptor
resulted in increased cAMP, which blocked downstream TNF
production in activated monocytoid cells.
The signal transduction cascade from cAMP to PKA has been
linked to inhibition of the ERK MAPK signaling pathway. PKA
can inhibit c-Raf activity, an upstream MAP3K to MEK1/2,
which activates ERK [23,24]. To determine if PKA activity was
important for TNF suppression by L. reuteri-derived histamine,
activated THP-1 cells were treated with a specific chemical
inhibitor of PKA, H89, in the presence of either L. reuteri
6475 CM, HILIC-HPLC fraction B3, histamine or varying
concentrations of dcAMP. The addition of H89, which inhibited
PKA activity, partially blocked TNF inhibition by all of the TNFinhibitory compounds (Figure 6B), demonstrating that PKA
activity was important for suppression of TNF by histamine and
dcAMP.
Histamine signaling through the H2 receptor blocks
activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 and downstream TNF
production
Previous studies demonstrated that PKA inhibits Ras/c-Raf
activation of MEK/ERK MAPK signaling [23,24]. Therefore, the
phosphorylation states of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 were examined
by immunoblot to determine if histamine was, in fact, suppressing
activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Treatment of
activated THP-1 cells with L. reuteri 6475 CM, histamine or
U0126, a specific chemical inhibitor of MEK activity which served
as the positive control, blocked activation (phosphorylation) of
both MEK1/2 and downstream ERK1/2 compared to the
medium control (Figure 7 and Figure S6). Treatment with
ranitidine partially restored activation of MEK1/2 and completely
restored activation of ERK1/2 (Figure 7 and Figure S6),
suggesting that inhibition of the MEK/ERK MAPK pathway
occurred via H2 receptor activation. MEK1/2 and ERK1/2

activated human monocytoid cells. The concentration of histamine (pg/mL) is indicated above each bar graph. Elevated levels of histamine correlated
with TNF inhibition.

protein quantities did not differ following these treatments. In
summary, histamine derived from L. reuteri 6475 inhibited
activation of MEK and downstream ERK, resulting in diminished
TNF production by TLR2-stimulated monocytoid cells.
Engagement of TLRs results in activation of MAPK signaling
cascades and downstream transcription factors such as AP-1 [20].
ERK is activated by the upstream MAP2K, MEK. To determine
the role of ERK in TLR2-stimulated TNF production, THP-1
cells were treated with a specific MEK inhibitor, U0126, for
varying amounts of time prior to stimulation with a TLR2 agonist,
and the effect on human TNF production was monitored.
Treatment with U0126 for a minimum of 30 min was sufficient
to prevent TNF production (Figure S7). ERK1/2 is activated
following TLR2 stimulation of THP-1 cells and is essential for
stimulating TNF production in our model system.
Discussion
This report highlights the identification of the biogenic amine,
histamine, as an immunoregulatory factor linking diet, the
microbiome (L. reuteri strain 6475), and the innate immune system.
For the first time, histamine is described as a probiotic
immunomodulin that potentially explains the suppression of
innate immunity by intestinal bacteria. Mechanistic studies
demonstrated that L. reuteri-derived histamine inhibited human
TNF production via signaling through the H2 receptor. Signaling
through the H2 receptor increased intracellular cAMP, and PKA
activity was necessary for TNF suppression by histamine. Finally,
histamine blocked activation of the MEK/ERK MAPK signaling
pathway and presumably suppressed transcription of the TNF
gene by inhibition of AP-1 translocation to the nucleus (Figure 8).
It has been demonstrated previously that L. reuteri 6475 suppresses
transcription of TNF by inhibiting activation of c-Jun and AP-1
[8].
Histamine is well known for its pro-inflammatory effects in
allergy and anaphylaxis; however several studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory or immunoregulatory functions of
histamine. In vitro studies have shown that histamine can inhibit
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1, IL-12, and TNF
from LPS-stimulated human monocytes and macrophages and this
effect is reversed by H2 receptor antagonists [35,38,39]. Additionally, histamine can stimulate production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, via the H2 receptor [39]. Signaling
through the H2 receptor results in decreased expression of the
CD14 receptor, a receptor involved in LPS recognition, on the
surface of human monocytes. This potential mechanism may be
one explanation for the suppression of TNF production by
histamine [40]. In vivo studies have also revealed an antiinflammatory role for histamine. Treatment with dimaprit, a
specific H2 receptor agonist, reduced plasma TNF levels in mouse
models of endotoxin shock (LPS challenge) and hepatitis (LPS plus
galactosamine challenge) [41]. Histamine was protective in a LPSinduced liver injury mouse model, and these effects were
attenuated in a H2 receptor knock-out mouse [42]. In the gut,
histamine may help protect against bacterial infection. Signaling
through the H2 receptor in Peyer’s patches helps prevent infection
by Yersinia enterocolitica [43].
How does histamine exert both a pro- and anti-inflammatory
effect on host cells? One possibility is that a structural modification
distinguishes histamine as a pro- or anti-inflammatory compound.
However, the fragmentation pattern of histamine in our MS/MS
analysis revealed that histamine produced by L. reuteri is not
covalently modified (Figure 2C). Another possible hypothesis
is that the pro- or anti-inflammatory effect of histamine is
concentration dependent. However, this possibility seems unlikely
in the host since histamine is rapidly degraded by two intestinal
enzymes, histamine-N-methyl transferase and diamine oxidase
[44]. A more intriguing hypothesis for histamine’s anti-inflammatory property is that the effect of histamine is determined by the
expression and activation of histamine receptors on the target host
cell [45]. In T lymphocytes, for example, the effect of histamine
appears to be dependent on the class of histamine receptor that is
activated. By signaling through the H1 receptor, histamine
enhances Th1-type responses but suppresses both Th1 and Th2
responses via the H2 receptor [46]. Many cell types in the human
GI tract express multiple histamine receptors. For example,
immune cells including macrophages, mainly express H1 and H2
receptors with relatively low quantities of the H4 receptor, while
intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) express both H1 and H2 receptors
[34]. The distribution of histamine receptors in the GI tract
indicates that the gut microbiota can signal to IECs and
underlying immune cells. Locally produced histamine from L.
reuteri may be activating H2 receptors on IECs as well as immune
cells to suppress host mucosal immunity via inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines.
Blocking the H2 receptor with specific antagonists may
exacerbate the disease course of some chronic inflammatory
conditions since activation of the H2 receptor is responsible for the
anti-inflammatory activity of histamine. H2 receptor antagonist
treatment was associated with an increased incidence of
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in very low birth weight infants
[47]. Guillet et al. proposed that decreased gastric acid and
changes in pH caused by H2 antagonist treatment may contribute
Figure 4. The histidine decarboxylase gene cluster contributed
to the TNF-inhibitory phenotype of L. reuteri 6475. The histidine
decarboxylase gene cluster consists of three genes, hdcP (RPRB3004),
hdcA (RPRB3005), and hdcB (RPRB3006). The organization of the cluster
is depicted above the bar graph. Inactivation by targeted mutagenesis
in any one of these genes resulted in a partial loss (approximately 40%)
of TNF suppression by L. reuteri 6475. Results represent the mean 6 SD

to NEC; however, the data presented here suggests an alternative
pathogenic mechanism of inhibiting histamine’s immunosuppressive properties via blockade of H2 receptors [47]. In the future, it
will be important to evaluate closely the effects of histamine
receptor antagonists in certain disease processes, such as NEC and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), given our growing knowledge
of the anti-inflammatory effects of L. reuteri-derived histamine.
Histamine is produced by decarboxylation of histidine, an
essential amino acid for humans that is present in many dietary
foods [48]. Histamine production by L. reuteri 6475 is increased by
supplementing the bacterial growth medium with histidine.
Supplementing the diet with certain amino acids, such as histidine,
may modulate intestinal inflammation associated with IBD [49]. In
vitro studies demonstrated that histidine inhibited production of the
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 from TNF-stimulated IECs [50].
Additionally, the effects of histidine were examined in vivo using an
IL-10-deficient (IL-102/2) cell transfer colitis model, and histidine
exerted a protective effect against colitis [51]. Histidine is
converted to histamine by the gut microbiota [52], and this
bioconversion may be one explanation for the anti-inflammatory
effects of histidine. The conversion from dietary histidine to
histamine by L. reuteri could take place in the gut lumen in close
proximity to cells, such as IECs and immune cells expressing the
H2 receptor, resulting in an anti-inflammatory effect. Mice
deficient in murine histidine decarboxylase activity demonstrate
increased quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines in intestinal
tissue and augmented infiltration of activated myeloid cells in
tissues [53].
Histidine supplementation increased expression of histidine
decarboxylase genes and production of histamine by L. reuteri
(Figure S3). In addition, histamine production can be modified by
carbon sources present in the environment or growth media in the
laboratory. Interestingly, these studies demonstrate that histamine
production by L. reuteri is dependent on the presence of glucose in
the growth media. L. reuteri loses the ability to inhibit TNF and
produce histamine when grown in a sucrose-based medium:
however, the TNF-inhibitory phenotype is retained if lactobacilli
are grown in a glucose/fructose-based medium (Figure S8). The
specific links between carbon sources and histamine production
are currently unknown, but such knowledge will facilitate an
improved understanding of diet-microbiome-host connections.
Based on the results of these in vitro studies, examining the impact
of diet on the production of histamine in vivo will be important for
enhancing immunomodulation by L. reuteri.
Analysis of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and the
reference genomes of gastrointestinal bacteria [54] for histidine
decarboxylase gene homologs revealed that out of 349 reference
genomes, only four genomes (all Lactobacillus) contained the
complete histidine decarboxylase gene cluster (L. reuteri JCM
112, L. reuteri MM2-3, L. reuteri 6475, and L. vaginalis ATCC 49540
(Figure S9)). Additionally, histamine production appears to be a
host-specific trait as only L. reuteri strains isolated from human
hosts possess the histidine decarboxylase gene [55]. The limited
distribution of the histidine decarboxylase gene cluster in the
human gut microbiome suggests that L. reuteri has evolved to
occupy a unique niche within its human host.
Probiotics produce active enzymes during their transit through
the GI tract, and this production can be modified by diet. For
example, Streptococcus thermophilus produced active b-galactosidase in
vivo, and production was increased with dietary supplementation of
lactose [56]. Transcriptomics studies of the complex gut microbiome are in their infancy. However, in vivo gene expression studies
of probiotic strains such as L. reuteri and L. plantarum have been
performed using in vivo expression technology (IVET). Genes
induced in vivo were primarily involved in nutrient acquisition,
stress response, and extracellular protein production [57,58].
Mixed-species genomic microarray analysis of infant fecal samples
demonstrated transcription of bifidobacterial genes involved in
carbohydrate metabolism and exopolysaccharide and folate
production in vivo [59]. The in vivo relative activities of bacterial
promoters present in gut bacteria, including the promoter for the
histidine biosynthetic pathway, were demonstrated by measuring
luciferase activity in germ-free mice monoassociated with
Lactococcus lactis. The activity of the histidine biosynthetic pathway
promoter was dependent upon the concentration of histidine,
indicating that histidine can regulate bacterial gene expression in
vivo [60,61]. The relative expression of genes in the histidine
decarboxylase gene cluster by L. reuteri in vivo and the effects of
histidine concentration are currently unknown.
Production of histamine by certain bacterial strains has caused
alarm as a health risk in food and as a marker of food spoilage. For
example, scombroid poisoning, a form of non-infectious foodborne
disease, is due to production of highly elevated quantities of
histamine and other biogenic amines by bacteria in spoiled food,
particularly fish [62]. Fermented foods and beverages naturally
contain small quantities of histamine due to the conversion of Lhistidine by bacteria in food substances prior to ingestion, and
histamine-producing strains have been excluded from foods due to
secondary concerns about allergic reactions. The results of the
current studies support the possible importance of dietary amino
acids like histidine in foods, and subsequent biological conversion
to active metabolites in the intestine at the site(s) of action. The
localization of bacteria in the intestine and the relative distribution
of histamine receptors in the intestinal mucosa will determine the
efficacy and potency of immunomodulation by the microbiome.
These studies do not advocate for oral ingestion of histamine, but
rather for luminal conversion of dietary components to bacterial
metabolites. Combining an essential amino acid, histidine, with
indigenous bacteria like L. reuteri results in conversion to histamine

at the site of activity and modulation of the host immune response
in the gut.
We hypothesize that L. reuteri 6475 produces multiple immunomodulatory factors, including but not limited to histamine.
Additional bioactive compounds may have co-eluted with
histamine in the TNF-inhibitory HILIC-HPLC fractions B5 and
B6. One-dimensional NMR identified several unique peaks that
were not histamine in fractions B5 and B6 compared to
neighboring non-TNF-inhibitory fractions. The identification
and characterization of these unique peaks is an ongoing effort.
The presence of multiple immunomodulins is supported by the
observation that the histidine decarboxylase mutants did not
completely lose the ability to suppress TNF production. In
addition, the activity of L. reuteri CM and CP washes was partially
blocked by H2 receptor antagonists, suggesting the presence of a
second factor and/or pathway. The loss of TNF-inhibitory activity
was comparable between the mutants and treatment with specific
H2 receptor antagonists. In comparison, the activity of the B3
fraction, which contained histamine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, was completely blocked by H2 receptor antagonists,
suggesting that histamine was the only active immunomodulin
present in that fraction. Mouse studies are being performed to
understand the importance of histamine as an immunomodulatory
factor in vivo. In the future, it would be ideal to perform in vivo
studies in which immunomodulins could be selectively added and
removed via targeted mutagenesis to determine the importance
and mechanism of action of each secretory factor produced by
probiotic strains.
In addition to the role of histamine in immunomodulation,
histamine is a known neurotransmitter [63]. Production of
histamine by L. reuteri 6475 may influence signaling in the enteric
nervous system, potentially impacting pain perception and gut
motility. In vivo studies are needed to gain a greater understanding
of the role of L. reuteri-produced histamine in the gut and its impact
on gut health and disease. The production of microbial
metabolites in the intestine and different mucosal surfaces may
provide compounds involved in inter-kingdom signaling that
promote mammalian health and immunologic homeostasis.
Facilitated conversion of dietary components by bacterial species
of the gut microbiome may provide an important bridge for
enhancement of our understanding of the impact of diet on human
health and disease.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
All bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table 1.
L. reuteri strains were cultured under anaerobic conditions for 16–
18 h in deMan, Rogosa, Sharpe media (Difco, Franklin Lakes,
NJ), and inoculated into semi-defined media, LDMIII (OD600
adjusted to 0.1), which has been described previously [64]. The
carbon source was either glucose (LDMIIIG) or sucrose
(LDMIIIS). Each culture was grown for 24 h at 37uC in an
anaerobic workstation (MACS MG-500, Microbiology International, Frederick, MD) supplied with a mixture of 10% CO2, 10%
H2, and 80% N2. At stationary phase (24 h), the cells were pelleted
(40006g, 10 min). Cell pellets and bacteria cell-free supernatants
were further processed for HPLC separation and testing in a TNF
inhibition bioassay.
Cell line and reagents
In vitro experiments were performed with THP-1 cells (human
monocytoid cell line, ATCC number TIB-202, ATCC, Manassas,
VA) maintained in RPMI (ATCC) and heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37uC, 5% CO2.
MEK1/2, phospho-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and phospho-ERK1/2
antibodies and MEK inhibitor U0126 were from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA), and the b-Actin, H1R and H2R
antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Ammonium
acetate, glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide were from
Figure 7. Stimulation of the H2 receptor inhibited the ERK signaling pathway. Immunoblot studies were performed to determine the effect
of histamine on activation of the ERK signaling pathway. ERK was activated by phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 (P-ERK). Treatment of TLRstimulated THP-1 cells with L. reuteri 6475, histamine, or U0126 suppressed activation of ERK1/2, an effect that was significantly blocked in the
presence of ranitidine. The b-actin antibody served as the protein loading control.

Mallinckrodt Baker (formerly J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA).
HPLC-grade water, methanol, and chloroform were from Fisher
Scientific (Pittsburg, PA). Formic acid and histamine dihydrochloride were from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). Histaminea,a,b,b-d4 dihydrochloride was from C/D/N Isotopes Inc.
(Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada). All other reagents were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.
HILIC-HPLC separation of cell wall associated factors
Cell pellets from strain 6475 grown in either LDMIIIG or
LDMIIIS were washed with ice cold 0.1% TFA. The cell
suspension was centrifuged for 10 min, 40006g at 4uC. Supernatants were filtered through polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membrane filters (0.45 mm pore size, Millipore, Bedford, MA),
lyophilized, and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. The resuspended sample was size-fractionated with Amicon Ultra-15
centrifugal filter units using ultracel-3 membrane (Millipore).
The filtrate was dried down and dissolved with 100% acetonitrile
before fractionation through a PolyLC Hydroxyethyl column with
a gradient of 100–0% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The sample
was run for 25 min and 25 fractions (A1–C1) were collected at
10 mL/min/tube. Each fraction was lyophilized, resuspended in
0.1% acetic acid, and lyophilized again for testing in a TNF
inhibition bioassay.
TNF inhibition bioassay and TNF ELISA
Bacterial supernatants from 24 h LDMIII cultures were filtersterilized using PVDF membrane filters (0.22 mm pore size,
Millipore) and size fractionated as described above. The filtrate
(,3 kDa) was dried and resuspended in RPMI medium to make
conditioned media (CM). All CM was normalized by volume to an
OD600= 1.5. Lyophilized fractions from the HILIC-HPLC
separation were resuspended in 10 mg/mL ammonium bicarbonate, dried, and resuspended in RPMI. CM and TFA-treated cell
pellet fractions were tested for their ability to modulate TNF
production in monocytoid cells. THP-1 cells (56104 cells) were
stimulated to produce TNF by the addition of 100 ng/mL
Pam3Cys-SKKKK (EMC Microcollections, Tuebingen, Germany). Inhibitors – ranitidine or cimetidine (1–100 nM), chlorpheniramine or pyrilamine (100 nM), U0126 (10 mM), and H89
(10 nM) – were added to the THP-1 cells followed by L. reuteri CM
or HILIC-HPLC fractions (5% v/v), histamine (10 nM), or
dibutyryl cAMP (0.1–1000 nM). Plates were incubated at 37uC
and 5% CO2 for 3.5 h. Quantitative ELISAs were used to
determine TNF according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
NMR analysis of select HILIC-HPLC fractions
Protocols have been developed for characterizing metabolites
using either 1D 1
H NMR [65] or 2D HSQC and TOCSY [27].
The NMR samples were prepared by adding D2O (D, 99.9%,
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and DSS (Sigma-Aldrich) to the
lyophilized HILIC-HPLC fractions. The 1D 1
H, 2D TOCSY, and
natural abundance 1
H-13C HSQC experiments were carried out
at 25uC on Bruker Avance 500 MHz instrument equipped with
triple-resonance z-gradient 5 mm probe. The spectral width,
number of Free Induction Decays and the acquisition points
for the 1D 1
H experiments were 10000 Hz, 512 and 64 k,
respectively. The TOCSY [66] experiment with 3-9-19 WATERGATE [67] was performed with 20486256 data points in direct
(with 160 number of scans) and in-direct dimensions, respectively.
The mixing time was 70 ms with DIPSI-2 sequence [68]. The
spectral widths of direct and in-direct dimensions were 8012 Hz
and 5497 Hz, respectively. The 1
H-13C HSQC experiment [69]
with gradient coherence selection [70] was acquired with
20486100 data points in 1
H (with 1440 number of scans) and 13C dimensions, respectively. The spectral widths of 1
H and 13C
dimensions were 8012 Hz and 6788 Hz, respectively. The 2D
data were processed with NMRPipe [71] and analyzed with
NMRView [72] and MetaboMiner [27] softwares. The 13C time
domain of HSQC was doubled using linear prediction [73] before
Fourier transformation.
Mass spectrometry analysis and quantification of
histamine
HILIC-HPLC fractions were analyzed by ESI-qTOF MS on an
Agilent 6520 mass spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA)
equipped with a 1260 NanoPump and a chip cube ESI source
with a chip for direct sample infusion. To remove interfering TFA,
HILIC-HPLC fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.1%
formic acid. The samples were analyzed in MS and MS/MS.
Figure 8. Pathway diagram of the mechanism of histamine
inhibition of ERK activation. THP-1 cells activated with a TLR2
agonist activated the MEK/ERK MAPK signaling cascade to induce
production of TNF. Histamine produced by L. reuteri 6475 engaged the
H2 receptor on activated THP-1 cells. This G protein-coupled receptor
activated adenylate cyclase (AC) to increase intracellular cAMP, which
subsequently activated protein kinase A (PKA). PKA inhibited MEK/ERK
activation and suppressed production of TNF. It was predicted that PKA
inhibited MEK/ERK activation by inhibiting the activity of c-Raf. Specific
H2 receptor antagonists, such as ranitidine, prevented histamine from
activating the H2 receptor and blocked TNF suppression by histamine.
H89, a specific inhibitor of PKA, prevented TNF suppression by
histamine, demonstrating that PKA activity was necessary for histamine’s effect on TNF. Blocking MEK activity with U0126 suppressed
activation of ERK and downstream TNF production, demonstrating that
ERK activation was necessary for production of TNF.

Culture supernatants were lyophilized and resuspended in HPLCWater. The samples were adjusted to pH 11 using sodium
hydroxide solution (5 M) and equal volumes of chloroform were
added and vigorously shaken for liquid-liquid extraction. The
organic phase was collected, dried and resuspended in 0.1%
formic acid. Quantification of histamine in both types of samples
(HILIC fractions and culture supernatants) was performed on an
ESI triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometer, Agilent 6410
Series equipped with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system and a Zorbax
SB-C18 HPLC column (150 mm60.5 mm, 5 mm particles,
Agilent). Samples were spiked with deuterated histamine (histamine-a,a,b,b-d4 dihydrochloride) as an internal standard (10 pg/
mL) in ammonium acetate (15 mM, pH 3.5). Samples were
injected into the HPLC system and then eluted from the column
using a short gradient of 15 mM ammonium acetate (pH 3.5,
solvent A) and methanol (100%, solvent B). The elution profile for
solvent B was: 0.0–5.0 min, 10%; 5.0–5.1 min, 10–40%; and 5.1–
8.0 min, 40%. For QQQ-MS quantification of histamine [74], the
following fragmentation transitions were used in multiple-reaction
monitoring mode: m/z 112.1 to m/z 95.1 for quantification; the
fragment at m/z 68.1 served as a qualifier. For the deuterated
standard the transitions m/z 116.1 to m/z 99.1 were used as
quantifier and the fragment at m/z 72.1 served as a qualifier. The
ESI probe tip was at 3.5 kV, nitrogen was used as nebulizer at
300uC at 15 psi, the insource fragmentor voltage was 105 V, and
the potentials across the collision cell were 12 V and 24 V for
quantifier and qualifier ions, respectively.
Quantification of histamine by ELISA
Wild-type L. reuteri 6475, hdcA, hdcB and hdcP mutants were grown
as described above in LDMIIIG supplemented with 4 mg/mL Lhistidine. Cultures were harvested at 24 h, centrifuged (15006g),
and filter-sterilized with 0.22-mm PVDF filters. Samples were
diluted in PBS, and histamine concentrations were determined
using the Histamine ELISA kit (Neogen, Lexington, KY) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was measured with a
Spectramax 340PC, and data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
5 software. Data were corrected with values obtained from the
background control (LDMIIIG+1% MRS) and normalized to the
same OD600 of 24 h LDMIIIG cultures.
Transcriptomic comparison of L. reuteri 6475 grown with
different carbon sources
L. reuteri 6475 was cultured in LDMIIIS or LDMIIIG to
stationary phase. For expression analyses, three biological
replicates were performed with dye-swap experiments for each
comparison. Following mRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, labeling,
and hybridization were performed as previously described [75,76].
Information regarding the microarray platforms can be found at
the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under GEO platform GPL7541. The complete
set of microarray data can be found under the GEO series
accession GSE32612. Microarray data analysis was performed as
previously described [75].
Construction of L. reuteri histidine decarboxylase mutants
Mutants were generated using RecT-mediated oligonucleotide
recombineering as previously described [32,33]. L. reuteri expressing RecT (strain RPRB0000) was used to construct mutations in
rpoB (locus tag HMPREF0536_0828 (ZP_03961568)) and the
target genes located in the histidine decarboxylase gene cluster
HMPREF0536_1229 (ZP_03961969), HMPREF0536_1230
(ZP_03961970) and HMPREF0536_1231 (ZP_03961971) to yield
strains RPRB3002, RPRB3004, RPRB3005 and RPRB3006,
respectively. Mutations were verified by PCR, and the integrity
was confirmed by sequence analysis. Oligonucleotides for
recombineering and screening purposes are available upon
request.
Expression studies of the L. reuteri histidine
decarboxylase gene cluster
L. reuteri 6475 was grown as described above in LDMIIIG with
or without 4 mg/mL L-histidine. At 16 h post-inoculation, the

OD600 was measured, and an equal volume of ice-cold methanol
was added to each culture. Half of each culture-methanol mixture
was pelleted by centrifugation (15006g), resuspended in STE
buffer (6.7% sucrose, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA) with
RNaseOUT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and mechanically disrupted using a Fastprep-24 Sample Preparation System (M.P.
Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) with 0.1 mm glass beads at 4.0 m/s for
20 s. Each sample was centrifuged briefly, RTL Plus buffer
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added and mechanical disruption was
repeated. RNA extraction was performed with the AllPrep RNA/
DNA/Protein Mini-kit with on-column DNase I treatment
(Qiagen). DNA was removed using TURBO DNA-free Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA synthesis with
Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was performed
using 3 mg RNA.
Expression of the hdc genes was analyzed using quantitative
real-time PCR. All primers were designed using the Universal
ProbeLibrary Assay Design Center (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN) and are described in Table 1. The RNA
polymerase b-subunit (rpoB) gene was used as a reference gene.
PCR reactions were set up using 26 FastStart Universal Probe
Master (Rox) (Roche Applied Science) and the cDNA described
above, with final concentrations of 200 nM for each primer and
100 nM for each probe. All PCR reactions were performed using
the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. Cycling parameters were as
follows: program 1; 1 cycle of 25uC for 2 min, 1 cycle of 95uC for
10 min, program 2; 50 three-step cycles of 95uC for 15 s, 60uC for
1 min and 72uC for 1 min, program 3; hold at 4uC. Fluorescence
was detected after the extension step in each cycle. The 22DDCT
method was used to calculate relative changes in hdc gene
expression when LDMIIIG was supplemented with L-histidine.
Quantification of cAMP by ELISA
Intracellular levels of cAMP in THP-1 cell lysates were
determined using a quantitative ELISA (R&D Systems). THP-1
cells were stimulated with PCK in the presence of medium control,
L. reuteri 6475, and histamine with and without ranitidine (as
described for the TNF inhibition bioassay) for 10 min. Cell pellets
were collected by centrifugation (30006g, 5 min, 4uC) and
resuspended in lysis buffer 5 (included in the cAMP ELISA kit).
Cells were lysed by two freeze/thaw cycles and centrifuged at
6006g, 10 min, 4uC to remove cellular debris. Quantification of
cAMP was performed by competitive binding ELISA according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 detection by immunoblot
THP-1 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of
50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF,
1 mM Na3VO4, 1% v/v Nonidet P40, 0.2% v/v NaN3, and
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were incubated on
ice for 30 min, vortexed every 10 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 13,0006g for 10 min at 4uC. Protein concentrations were
measured using the Quant-iTTM Protein Assay kit (Invitrogen) and
a Qubit fluorometer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto electrophoresis gels.
Analysis of ERK1/2 activation was performed using specific
phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies. Cell extracts were loaded in a 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membranes
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked overnight at
4uC in blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). After
several washes, membranes were probed with ERK1/2, phosphoERK1/2 or b-Actin specific antibodies diluted in blocking buffer
(Li-Cor) for 1 h at room temperature. After washes, membranes
were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and
blots were developed using chemiluminescent detection. Analysis
of MEK1/2 activation was performed as described above except
primary phospho-MEK1/2 and MEK1/2 antibody incubation
was 17 hrs at 4uC. Pixel density analysis was performed in a
FluorChem HD2 system (Alpha Innotech, Santa Clara, CA).

Figure S1 TNF-inhibitory compounds were isolated in
three distinct HILIC-HPLC fractions. Compounds from
TFA-treated L. reuteri cell pellets were separated based on relative
hydrophobicity. A. TNF-inhibitory compounds from L. reuteri
6475 grown in a glucose-containing medium were isolated in 3
fractions (B3, B5, and B6). Results represent the mean 6 SD
(n = 3), *
p value,0.05. B. No TNF-inhibitory compounds from L.
reuteri 6475 grown in a sucrose-containing medium were isolated
by HILIC-HPLC.

Figure S3 Genes in the histidine decarboxylase gene
cluster were necessary for production of histamine. A.
Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated increased expression of
all three hdc genes, hdcA, hdcB, and hdcP, when L. reuteri 6475 was
grown in LDMIIIG medium supplemented with 4 mg/mL Lhistidine compared to unsupplemented LDMIIIG. Gene expression data were normalized using rpoB as a reference gene.
Expression ratios of each gene (histidine-supplemented versus
unsupplemented LDMIIIG) were calculated. Results represent the
mean 6 SD (n = 3), **p value,0.005, *
p value,0.05 compared to
the theoretical mean of 1.0. B. Quantification of secreted L. reuteriderived histamine by a histamine-specific ELISA demonstrated
decreased histamine production in all three hdc gene mutants,
hdcA, hdcB, and hdcP, compared to wild-type L. reuteri 6475. Results
represent the mean 6 SD (n = 3), ***p value,0.001 compared to
wild-type 6475.

Figure S4 THP-1 cells express the H1 and H2 receptors.
Unstimulated THP-1 cells were examined for cell surface
expression of the histamine H1 and H2 receptors. Cells were
labeled with rabbit anti-human H1R or H2R pAb and FITCconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG pAb or FITC-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG pAb alone (IgG Control) and analyzed with FACS.
Shown is one representative experiment of at least three.

Figure S8 TNF-inhibitory phenotype was modified by
the carbon source in the growth medium. Supplementing
the growth medium with various simple sugars, such as glucose,
glucose+fructose, and sucrose, altered the ability of TFA-treated
cell pellets (CP) from L. reuteri 6475 to inhibit TNF production.

Figure S9 A complete histidine decarboxylase gene
cluster was found only in lactobacilli. Analysis of the
HMP reference genomes (GI bacteria) for histidine decarboxylase
gene homologs revealed that out of 349 reference genomes, only
four bacterial strains contained the complete histidine decarboxylase gene cluster. The strains were L. reuteri JCM 112, L. reuteri
MM2-3, L. reuteri 6475, and L. vaginalis ATCC 49540.
