ABSTRACT
Purpose: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) in one of the most common genetic causes 
of liver disease in children. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 
patients with A1ATD.
Methods: This study included patients with A1ATD from five pediatric hepatology units. 
Demographics, clinical findings, genetics, and outcome of the patients were recorded (n=25).
Results: Eight patients (32.0%) had homozygous PiZZ genotype while 17 (68.0%) had 
heterozygous genotype. Patients with PiZZ genotype had lower alpha-1 antitrypsin levels 
than patients with PiMZ genotype (37.6±7.7 mg/dL vs. 66.5±22.7 mg/dL, p=0.0001). Patients 
with PiZZ genotype were diagnosed earlier than patients with PiMZ genotype, but this was 
not significant (13±6.8 months vs. 23.7±30.1 months, p=0.192). Follow-up revealed the death 
of one patient (12.5%) with a homozygous mutation, and revealed that one patient had 
child A cirrhosis, five patients (62.5%) had chronic hepatitis, and one patient (12.5%) was 
asymptomatic. Nine of the 17 patients with a heterozygous mutation had chronic hepatitis 
(52.9%), two (11.7%) had child A cirrhosis, and six (35.2%) were asymptomatic. Overall, 18 
(72%) of the 25 children had liver pathology in the long-term.
Conclusion: Although prevalence is rare, patients with liver disorders should be checked for 
alpha-1 antitrypsin levels. Moreover, long-term follow-up is essential because most patients 
have a liver pathology.

INTRODUCTION
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a single chain 52 kD glycoprotein belonging to the serpin (serine 
protease inhibitor) family. It consists of 394 amino acids and is primarily synthesized in the 
hepatocytes, in the lung epithelium and in macrophages, and released into the blood [1]. The

main function of alpha-1 antitrypsin is to protect the lung epithelium from the non-specific 
release of proteases (such as neutrophil elastase) during inflammation. Additionally, alpha-1 
antitrypsin inhibits the release of these proteases in the lung epithelium [2].
Alpha-1 antitrypsin is encoded by a gene (SERPINA1) located on the distal long arm of 
chromosome 14 (14q31-32.2) [3]. To date, more than 200 allelic variants have been defined, some 
of them leading to severe liver disease in childhood and pulmonary emphysema in adulthood. 
The most common allele is PiM, which is found in ~95% of the population and encodes normal 
functions and levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. PiS (expressing 50–60% of alpha-1 antitrypsin) and PiZ 
(expressing 10–20% of alpha-1 antitrypsin) alleles are associated with low and aberrant alpha-1 
antitrypsin expression [4]. Rare alleles such as MMalton and MPalermo are also associated with low 
alpha-1 antitrypsin levels [3]. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is a genetic proteinopathy 
that affects the lungs and the liver through different mechanisms and shows an autosomal 
codominant inherence pattern. Pulmonary emphysema develops when alpha-1 antitrypsin is 
low or absent due to the presence of mutant alleles (PiS and PiZ) for the inhibition of the serine 
proteinases, that destroy the lung tissues. In contrast, aberrant protein accumulation inside the 
endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes causes hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis by 
triggering a cascade of hepatocellular apoptosis, regeneration, and injury [5,6].
A1ATD is the most common genetic reason for liver transplantation in children in Northern 
Europe [7,8]. The prevalence of A1ATD in newborns was 1/1,639 in USA and 1/1,575 (PiZZ 
genotype) in Sweden [9,10]. Conversely, the incidence of A1ATD has been reported to be very 
low in Iranian patients with neonatal cholestasis [11]. The incidence of this disease seems to 
be low in our country, Turkey, based on data from the pediatric transplantation center [12]; 
it was reported in 3.6% of infants with cholestasis [13]. In this study, we aimed to analyze the 
(i) demographic and clinical characteristics and (ii) outcome of the patients with A1ATD from 
five pediatric hepatology units in Turkey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study included patients diagnosed with A1ATD since 2005 and selected from five 
pediatric hepatology units (n=25). Demographic characteristics, laboratory parameters 
(serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl 
transferase, total/direct bilirubin, and alpha-1 antitrypsin levels), clinical findings (presenting 
symptoms and physical examination findings), genetic analyses, and outcome of the patients 
were collected from hospital record files.The diagnosis of A1ATD was made based on low 
alpha-1 antitrypsin levels (normal range; 90–200 mg/dL, using the nephelometric method) 
and positive genotype analysis (either homozygous or heterozygous). Patients with: (i) 
secondary A1ATD such as the nephrotic syndrome or protein-losing enteropathy; (ii) low 
levels of A1ATD and normal genotype; or (iii) inadequate file records, were not included 
in this study. All other causes of liver diseases, such as infectious, anatomic and metabolic 
conditions, were excluded in all cases. Outcome of the patients in the long-term were defined 
as chronic liver disease (classified according to the Child-Pugh score), chronic hepatitis (only 
elevated liver enzymes without any signs of chronic liver disease such as growth retardation, 
organomegaly, and osteopenia), and asymptomatic (normal liver enzymes without any signs 
of chronic liver disease). Patients were symptomatically treated according to the presence of 
complications such as portal hypertension (treated using beta blockers or band ligation) or 
ascites (treated using diuretics).

A1ATD in Children

All calculations in our study were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
Version 23.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA), and the continuous variables were expressed as 
mean±standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables as percentage (%). Comparison of 
the quantitative data between the groups was performed using Student t-test in the normally 
distributed variables, and the Mann-Whitney U-test in the non-normally distributed variables. 
Qualitative data were compared using the Chi-squared test. A p-values ≤0.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
The study was approved by the Karadeniz Technical University, Faculty of Medicine, Scientific 
Research Ethics Committee, reference number 2018/236.
RESULTS
Demographic and clinical findings, as well as outcome of the patients have been shown in 
Table 1. Twelve (48.0%) of the 25 patients were female and the mean±SD age of the patients 
at the time of diagnosis was 20.1±2.5 months. A 84% of the patients were diagnosed in the 
infancy period (≤24 months old age) [14].
The main indications for the screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin level were isolated 
transaminase elevation (ITE) in ten patients (40.0%), etiology for chronic liver disease in four

patients (16.0%), etiology for neonatal cholestasis in three patients (12.0%), bleeding due 
to coagulopathy in two patients (8.0%), and chronic hepatitis in two patients (8.0%). One 
patient had intracranial hemorrhage and another had umbilical bleeding due to coagulopathy 
at the time of admission. Alpha-1 antitrypsin level and genotype analyses were performed for 
family screening in four patients (16.0%) (two patients had a sister with a PiZZ-associated 
chronic liver disease and the others had a PiMZ-associated bleeding disorder in siblings). 
Overall, eight patients (32.0%) had a homozygous PiZZ genotype while 17 (68.0%) had a 
heterozygous genotype (eight PiMZ and one MMalton) (Table 1). Patient 25 had chronic hepatitis 
and a low alpha-1 antitrypsin level, and targeted mutation analysis revealed a PiMM genotype. 
After exclusion of all other causes of chronic hepatitis, full gene sequencing of the SERINA1 
gene was performed for A1ATD and reported as a heterozygous MMalton mutation. At the time 
of admission, organomegaly was present in eight patients (32.0%), icterus in four patients 
(16.0%), and failure to thrive was observed in two patients (8.0%).
Comparison of the patients with the PiZZ and the PiMZ genotypes revealed that alpha-1 
antitrypsin level was significantly lower in patients with the PiZZ genotype [mean±SD, 
median (range): 37.6±7.7 mg/dL (37.5 mg/dL, 29–50 mg/dL) vs. 66.5±22.7 mg/dL (76 mg/
dL, 30–87 mg/dL), p=0.0001]. Patients with the PiZZ genotype were diagnosed earlier than 
patients with the PiMZ genotype but this was not significantly different (13±6.8 months vs. 
23.7±30.1 months, p=0.192) (Table 2).
Liver biopsy was performed in six patients (three PiMZ, two PiZZ, and one MMalton) (24.0%) 
during the diagnostic process. Histopathological examination revealed globules resistant to 
the periodic acid-Schiff positive diastase in all patients except one patient with MMalton. All 
patients had portal inflammation and hepatic fibrosis, and four had steatosis.
Median (range) duration of follow-up of patients with homozygous and heterozygous 
mutations were 49 months (6–144 months) and 38 months (4–97 months), respectively. 
One patient (12.5%) with a homozygous mutation died during the follow-up (patient no 
4) due to decompensated liver disease and pulmonary emphysema at age of 11 years. Liver 
transplantation could not be performed, because this patient had severe neurological 
sequelae due to intracranial hemorrhage. One patient had Child A cirrhosis and five patients 
(62.5%) had chronic hepatitis. Another patient (12.5%) with a homozygous mutation was 
asymptomatic (normal liver function tests). Nine of the 17 patients with a heterozygous 
mutation had chronic hepatitis (52.9%), two patients had Child A cirrhosis (11.7%), and six 
(35.2%) patients were asymptomatic (four of these patients were diagnosed during the family 
screening and had transient liver enzyme elevation during the follow-up, but all had normal 
enzyme levels in the last visit). Overall, 7 (28.0%) of the 25 children were asymptomatic with 
normal liver enzymes in the final visit.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we analyzed the clinical features and outcome of children with A1ATD in Turkey. 
We found that: (i) patients may be admitted with a variety of liver pathologies ranging from 
asymptomatic or ITE to chronic liver diseases from early infancy to the adolescent age; 
(ii) alpha-1 antitrypsin level was lower in patients with the PiZZ genotype compared to the 
heterozygous genotype; (iii) full-gene sequencing of the SERPINA1 gene must be performed 
in children with low alpha-1 antitrypsin level and normal genotypes with targeted mutation 
analysis; and (iv) A1ATD caused a liver pathology (ranging from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis) 
in approximately 75% of the children during long-term follow-up.
Liver pathology in children with an A1ATD has bimodal characteristics. It is generally 
presented as neonatal hepatitis or prolonged cholestasis in the neonatal period and transient 
elevation of liver enzymes or chronic hepatitis in the adolescent period. Comba et al. [15] 
studied 20 children with A1ATD, and found that 65% of the children presented with elevated 
liver enzymes and 15% had neonatal hepatitis. Prolonged cholestasis in the neonatal period 
was reported in 11% of the Swedish children who were homozygous with the mutation 
(n=122), while 6% of the patients presented with the clinical signs of liver disease without 
jaundice in the adolescents [10,16]. Although we could not make an analysis due to the 
small number of patients, it seems that patients with homozygous mutations presented 
with an advanced disease at an early age. However, patients with heterozygous mutations 
are generally asymptomatic and this may cause delays to diagnosis. Additionally, we found 
that the alpha-1 antitrypsin level was lower in patients with a homozygous mutation. The 
pathogenesis of liver involvement in A1ATD is related to the accumulation of defective protein 
inside the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, which triggers apoptosis and injury [5,6]. 
The level of alpha-1 antitrypsin is only related with the pulmonary involvement, but the role of 
low alpha-1 antitrypsin levels must be investigated in the severity of pathophysiology of liver 
diseases in homozygous patients. It may be related to the difference in severity of apoptosis 
and hepatocellular injury at various levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin.
Bleeding problems may be the initial presentation of A1ATD, as found in our study. van 
Hasselt et al. [17] analyzed the vitamin K deficiency and risk of bleeding in infants with 
A1ATD and found that the risk of bleeding due to a vitamin K deficiency in infants with 
A1ATD is as high as infants with biliary atresia, and is higher in breastfed-compared to 
formula-fed infants. However, the risk of bleeding is mainly related to the presence of 
cholestasis, and not related to low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Early diagnosis of A1ATD 
and vitamin K treatment in these patients may decrease the risk of bleeding complications. 
Life-threatening late hemorrhagic diseases due to a vitamin K deficiency, such as umbilical 
bleeding, was also reported in patients with A1ATD, showing that 2.8% of the total patients 
in a Swedish study and 5% of the total patients in a Polish study were affected [7,18].
Screening of other siblings for A1ATD is important for an early diagnosis. The heterozygous 
mutation with low alpha-1 antitrypsin level was found in the other siblings in our study, but 
liver enzymes were within the normal limits at initial screening. However, transient elevation 
of liver enzymes was seen during follow-up in all patients. A detailed and timely follow-up of 
these patients will prevent the complications related to liver diseases.
The diagnosis of A1ATD is based on the presence of low alpha-1 antitrypsin levels and 
identification of causal mutations. The analysis of the causal mutations is important in 
https://pghn.org https://doi.org/10.5223/pghn.2020.23.2.146 150
A1ATD in Children

order to distinguish the genetic causes from the non-genetic causes of A1ATD. Current 
routine genetic analysis consists of only the most common mutations including M, S, and 
Z alleles. Rare mutations associated with A1ATD have been reported in recent years [3]. 
Graham et al. [19] reported that 42 (1.2%) of the 3,523 patients with low alpha-1 antitrypsin 
levels had normal genotype with routine genetic analysis, and full-gene sequencing revealed 
rare mutations, such as MMalton, MHeerlen, and PLowell, in 16 of the 42 patients. They suggested 
performing full-gene sequencing in patients with low alpha-1 antitrypsin levels and with 
a normal genotype in routine analyses. One of our patients was diagnosed after full-gene 
sequencing.
Liver biopsy is not needed for the diagnosis but may be performed for assessing the 
progression of liver disease. The Periodic acid-Schiff positive diastase-resistant globules 
are diagnostic markers for A1ATD but may not be seen in liver biopsies if performed during 
an early infancy, in biopsies taken with Menghini or tru-cut, or in patients with advanced 
cirrhosis that may be distributed irregularly [20].
Long-term prognosis of A1ATD is mainly dependent on the genotype; patients with the 
PiZZ genotype exhibited more severe prognosis and developed chronic liver disease in the 
long-term, whereas it is rare in patients with the heterozygous genotype. Liver disease 
developed only in a minority of the patients with heterozygous genotype. In populationbased studies, it was shown that heterozygous patients have an increased risk (2–3-fold) 
of developing a chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in the long-term. Genetic (obesity), 
environmental factors (viral diseases, alcoholism, and drugs), and comorbid conditions 
predispose patients to the development of a chronic liver injury [21]. Teckman et al. [22] 
analyzed the long-term prognosis of 269 patients with A1ATD in the US and Canada, 
and reported that most of the liver abnormalities may improve spontaneously during the 
follow-up. In their cohort study, severe liver disease was reported in 121 patients (44.9%) 
in the long-term. None of the factors, such as age at the onset of symptoms, sex, ethnicity, 
and race, were associated with the development of the severe liver disease. In contrast, 
genotype was not associated with the outcome in previous studies. Presence of jaundice at 
initial presentation and high liver enzymes were predictors of the development of a portal 
hypertension. A small percentage of patients with A1ATD require liver transplantation by 
the time they proceed with the follow-up. A1ATD accounted for 3.5% of all pediatric liver 
transplants in the UNOS database, with a decreasing trend in recent years [8]. Contrary to 
previous studies, we found that the majority of our patients had liver pathology in the longterm follow-up. One patient required liver transplantation but this could not be performed 
due to severe neurological sequelae.
Our study is a descriptive study about the demographic and clinical findings and highlights 
the outcome of liver diseases in patients with A1AT. The limitations of our study are: (i) the 
small number of patients, which may cause a relatively high percentage in some studies, and 
(ii) we may have missed some patients with A1ATD, because it was not routinely tested in all 
patients with liver pathology (depends on the experience of a physician).
In conclusion, we report our findings about A1ATD. Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels should be 
checked in patients with liver disorders. Patients with bleeding disorders may also be 
admitted, and full-gene sequence analyzing may be needed in some cases. Moreover, longterm follow-up is essential because most patients had a liver pathology, the incidence of 
which was high compared to that reported in the previous studies.
