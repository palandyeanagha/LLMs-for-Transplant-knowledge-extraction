Abstract
Background and Aims: Cystic Fibrosis associated liver disease (CFLD) develops in approximately 30% of CF patients.
However, routine sensitive diagnostic tools for CFLD are lacking. Within this study, we aimed to identify new experimental
biomarkers for the detection of CFLD.
Methods: 45 CF patients were included in the study and received transient elastography. Differential regulation of 220
different serum proteins was assessed in a subgroup of patients with and without CFLD. Most interesting candidate proteins
were further quantified and validated by ELISA in the whole patient cohort. To assess a potential relation of biomarker
expression to the degree of hepatic fibrosis, serum biomarkers were further determined in 18 HCV patients where liver
histology was available.
Results: 43 serum proteins differed at least 2-fold in patients with CFLD compared to those without liver disease as
identified in proteome profiling. In ELISA quantifications, TIMP-4 and Endoglin were significantly up-regulated in patients
with CFLD as diagnosed by clinical guidelines or increased liver stiffness. Pentraxin-3 was significantly decreased in patients
with CFLD. Serum TIMP-4 and Endoglin showed highest values in HCV patients with liver cirrhosis compared to those with
fibrosis but without cirrhosis. At a cut-off value of 6.3 kPa, transient elastography compassed a very high diagnostic
accuracy and specificity for the detection of CFLD. Among the biomarkers, TIMP-4 and Endoglin exhibited a high diagnostic
accuracy for CFLD. Diagnostic sensitivities and negative predictive values were increased when elastography and TIMP-4
and Endoglin were combined for the detection of CFLD.
Conclusions: Serum TIMP-4 and Endoglin are increased in CFLD and their expression correlates with hepatic staging.
Determination of TIMP-4 and Endoglin together with transient elastography can increase the sensitivity for the non-invasive
diagnosis of CFLD.

Introduction
Cystic fibrosis associated liver disease (CFLD) has a cumulative
incidence of approximately 30% [1,2] and accounts for 2.5% of
the overall mortality of CF patients, thereby representing the third
most common cause of death in CF patients [3].
Due to the high prevalence, the early onset and the often
progressive course of CFLD, the reliable recognition of CF
patients at risk of developing CFLD is of urgent clinical necessity
[4]. To date, liver histology is still the most commonly used gold
standard for the assessment of chronic liver diseases. However, as
only 1/50000 of the liver volume is evaluated with liver biopsy, it
is controversially discussed in focally distributed liver disease and
thereby not generally recommended for the assessment of CFLD
[4,5]. Further, liver biopsy exhibits a significant intra-/interobserver variability [4,6,7,8] and, due to its invasive nature, is limited
in its acceptance and repetition, especially in children [9,10,11].
Current guideline criteria recommend a combination of physical
examination, liver biochemistry and ultrasound to diagnose CFLD
[4]; however, the reliable identification of CF patients at risk of
developing CFLD remains a major clinical challenge [4].
Consequently, research efforts have been focused on the
development of non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of CFLD.
First studies have successfully evaluated liver stiffness measured by
transient elastography (TE) for the assessment of CFLD
[12,13,14]. Additionally, a growing understanding of the pathoPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58955

genesis of hepatic fibrosis identified non-invasive quantitative
serum biomarkers of hepatic fibrogenesis, which are pathophysiologically derived from extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover and
might directly translate the molecular pathogenesis of fibrosis into
clinical application. Thereby, these so-called class I fibrosis
markers, can act as potentially powerful serum biomarkers of
hepatic fibrosis [14,15,16].
Within this study, we followed a dual intent: First, we aimed to
identify novel serum biomarkers of liver disease in CF patients
using a proteome profiling approach. Based on these results, we
secondly verified increased expression of selected promising
candidate proteins in CFLD by ELISA and further analysed their
diagnostic value for the assessment of CFLD in comparison to that
of TE. Using this approach, our results identify TIMP-4 and
Endoglin as novel and promising serum markers of liver disease in
CF patients that hold the potential to facilitate the non-invasive
assessment of CFLD.
Materials and Methods
Patients
This study has been conducted according to the principles
expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participating patients or their
parents. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the
medical faculty of the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen (Gaffkystrasse 11c, 35392 Giessen, Germany) with the approval no. 75/
09. The diagnosis of CF was established by sweat test and later
confirmed by genetic tests in all subjects. All patients were treated
according to European and U.S. guidelines [17,18]. After
exclusion of other causes for chronic liver disease, the diagnosis
of CFLD was established according to recent guidelines [4] if least
two of the following conditions on at least two consecutive
examinations spanning a one-year period were present: (i)
Hepatomegaly (liver span .2 cm below the costal margin on
the medioclavicular line) confirmed by ultrasound, (ii) two
abnormal serum liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, cGT . ULN),
(iii) ultrasound abnormalities other than hepatomegaly (increased,
heterogeneous echogenicity, nodularity, irregular margins).
To correlate the expression of experimental biomarkers to the
histologic degree of hepatic fibrosis deposition, a cohort of 18
patients with chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection was
studied. In HCV patients, liver biopsy samples were taken via right
intercostal space from the right liver lobe after desinfection and
local anesthesia of the skin with an 18 gauge needle (Menghini
needle, Braun-Melsungen, outer diameter 1.2 mm). An experienced pathologist who was blinded to the patients’ clinical results
analyzed the biopsy specimens. Liver fibrosis stages were evaluated
semi-quantitatively according to the Desmet/Scheuer [16] scoring
system.
Transient elastography (TE)
Liver stiffness by TE was evaluated using the same FibroScanH
(Echosens, Paris, France) device in all patients. Non-invasive
measurements were performed by a single experienced investigator blinded to the clinical status of the patients on the right lobe of
the liver through the intercostal space at a depth of 25 and 65 mm
from skin surface. In children below 15 kg of weight the
FibroScanH S probe, developed for liver stiffness measurements
in children, was used. For each patient, the stiffness value was
calculated as the median of ten successful measurements. TE was
considered valid if 10 successful measurements with a success rate
$ 60% and an interquartile range # 30% of the median were
obtained. Results are expressed in kilopascal (kPa). Total
examination time was approximately 5 minutes per patient.
Routine laboratory tests and determination of
biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis
All patients underwent routine haematological and biochemical
investigations on the day of TE. The following proteome profiling

array kit (Cat. No. ARY007), human cytokine array panel A (Cat.

array were at least repeated twice in two independent experiments
and the volume of serum used ranged from 50 ml to 400 ml. TIMP4, Endoglin, HGF and Pentraxin-3 were further quantified in
undiluted serum (TIMP-4, Pentraxin-3) or in 1:2 and 1:10 diluted
serum (HGF and Endoglin) with using commercially available
ELISA Kits (Pentraxin-3: human Pentraxin-3 ELISA, BlueGene

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill). Normal distribution of the data was tested using the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and visualization of histograms. Failing
to meet criteria for normal distribution, differences in TE values
and serum markers between patients with and without CFLD were
assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples.
Liver stiffness and expression of serum markers are shown in Boxand-Whisker Plots. The upper and lower hinges of the box
represent the 75th and 25th percentile, respectively. The line
indicates the median value; error bars represent the minimum and
maximum. Values deviating from the box by 1.5- to 3-fold
interquartile range were defined as outliers (o). Significant
differences are pointed out (*p,0.05, **p,0.01). Measurement
agreement between clinical markers of CFLD and the novel
diagnostic modalities assessed in the this studies has been
performed in Bland-Altman-Analyses [19]. To directly compare
the concordance of the differently scaled clinical and experimental
markers every measured value ‘‘a’’ of the respective test was
transferred into a commensurable variable ‘‘a9’’ using the
following equation: a9 = (a- a¯)/sa.
The diagnostic performances of TE and fibrosis markers were
assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The
ROC curve is a plot of sensitivity versus (1 – specificity) for all
possible cut-off values for the prediction of different fibrosis stages.
The most commonly used index of accuracy is the area under the
ROC (AUROC) curve with values close to 1.0 indicating a high
diagnostic accuracy.

Results
Patient characteristics and proteome profile screening in
patients with CFLD
From 45 CF patients that were consecutively enrolled between
June 2008 and December 2010, 17 ( = 38%) were diagnosed with
CFLD according to recent guidelines [4]. CF patients with CFLD
had significantly elevated levels of liver transaminases and c-GT
whereas albumin levels and platelet counts were decreased in
patients with CFLD compared to those without CFLD. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the CF study populations are
shown in Table 1.
To identify potential candidate proteins which might act as
biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis we initially screened a broad range
of differentially regulated serum proteins in patients with CFLD
and those without. For this purpose, serum of 4 patients with
CFLD and of 4 patients without CFLD was applied to 4 different
serum proteome profilers, thereby assessing key proteins and
enzymes involved in angiogenesis (Figure 1), soluble receptors and
related proteins released by non-hematopoietic cells and including
key proteins involved in the metabolism of the extracellular matrix
(Figure 2 and 3) and chemokines regulating the migration of
monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (Figure 4). Serum
proteome profiler analyses for each array were at least repeated
twice in two independent experiments. Using this approach, we
comparatively assessed the expression of a total of serum 220
proteins in patients without CFLD and those with proven CFLD.
Based on optical densitometry analyses of the proteome profilers,
36 serum proteins were at least 2-fold increased in patients with
CFLD compared to those without CFLD. Many of the proteins
found up-regulated in CFLD have previously been described in
fibrotic processes of different organs and/or liver fibrosis such as
GM-CSF, ADAMTS-1, IP-10, PDGF-AB/-BB, TGF-ß1 or
Activin A. Another 9 serum proteins were found to be at least
2-fold decreased in our serum proteome analysis.
Due to their relatively high abundance in CFLD patients and
their pathophysiologic relation to the metabolism of extracellular
matrix and/or angiogenesis as key events for the development of
hepatic matrix deposition, we chose to further validate and
quantify the serum levels of TIMP-4, Endoglin, Hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), and Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) in ELISA
measurements in the whole CF cohort of 45 patients.

Relative expression of 62 different soluble receptors and related proteins from non-hematopoietic proteins (A) were determined from pooled sera

densitometry of the corresponding bands (B), proteins were identified that were at least 2-fold differentially regulated in patients with CFLD
compared to those without. A total of 10 soluble receptors and related proteins from non-hematopoietic cells were at least 2-fold increased in CFLD
with highest relative expression observed for MEPE and SREC-II (C). ITGA3, JAM-B, MUCDHL and SDC4 were at least 2-fold decreased in patients with

Expression of serum fibrosis biomarkers in patients with
CFLD
Serum was available from all 45 CF patients for quantification
of the above-mentioned proteins by ELISA. All measurements
were performed in duplicate.
CF Patients with CFLD diagnosed according to recent
guidelines exhibited significantly increased serum levels of
TIMP-4 and Endoglin compared to those without liver disease.
In contrast, serum PTX3 was significantly decreased in CF
patients with hepatopathy. Serum levels of HGF did not
significantly differ between CF patients with liver disease and
those without (Figure 5).
As a further means for the assessment of the expression of serum
fibrosis markers in CFLD, we measured liver stiffness values by
transient elastography (TE) in our patient cohort, which has been
proven to accurately diagnose liver disease and hepatic fibrosis of
various etiologies, including CFLD [13,14,20,21]. For this purpose
we initially assessed the diagnostic value of TE in our CF patient
cohort. As shown in Figure 6, with a median of 9.95 kPa, patients
with CFLD exhibited a significantly higher liver stiffness compared
to patients without liver disease, in which a median liver stiffness of
4.3 kPa was measured. Further, with an AUROC of 0.906, TE
exhibited an excellent diagnostic accuracy in receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis and the sum of diagnostic sensitivity
and specificity for the detection of CFLD was calculated to be
maximal at a cut-off of 6.3 kPa based on ROC analysis (Table 2
and 3).
When serum levels of hepatic fibrosis markers were then
compared in patients with TE values below or above this
threshold, we observed similar results to those obtained from the
comparison of patients with and without CFLD as defined by
recent guidelines: Endoglin was significantly increased in patients
with liver stiffness values above 6.3 kPa whereas PTX3 was again
significantly decreased in patients with TE values above 6.3 kPa
(Figure 7). As seen in patients with CFLD as diagnosed by
guideline criteria, TIMP-4 serum levels were also increased in
patients with stiffness values .6.3 kPa compared to those with
values below 6.3 kPa, although these differences did not reach
statistical significance. Serum expression of HGF was unchanged
between patient with and without CFLD, as diagnosed by TE with
a cut-off of 6.3 kPa (Figure 7).
To address CF lung manifestation and pulmonary fibrosis as a
potential confounder of the above results of a significant regulation
of TIMP-4, Endoglin and PTX3 in the presence of liver disease,
we assessed their serum expression in CF patients with a forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) below and above 70%,
with a vital capacity (VC) of below and above 80%, and with a
ratio between FEV1 and VC below and above 70% (FEV1/VC),
which serve as established indicators of CF lung disease and have
been the primary outcome in many clinical trials [17,22,23,24]. Of
note, none of the above serum markers was different in patients
with and without impairment of lung function as assessed by
FEV1, VC and FEV1/VC (Figure S1). Further, serum marker
levels were unaltered between patients without pancreatic
insufficiency (PI, Figure S2), indicating that the increased

Relative expression of 57 different soluble receptors and related proteins from non-hematopoietic proteins (A) were determined from pooled serum
from patients with established CFLD (n = 4) and those without liver disease (n = 4). All proteins were determined in duplicate and based on optical
densitometry of the corresponding bands (B), proteins were identified that were at least 2-fold differentially regulated in patients with CFLD
compared to those without. ADAM10, BACE-1, CD23, CD147, RECK, TNFRII were at least 2-fold increased in CFLD whereas ITGB3 was at least 2-fold
decreased in patients with CFLD compared to those without (C). PC: positive control, NC: negative control, IC: internal control, OD: optical density

expression of TIMP-4 and Endoglin and the decreased expression
of PTX3 occur indeed relatively specific for the existence of liver
disease without being affected by pancreas and lung disease as
other major manifestations of CF.
As treatment with Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) improves liver
function tests and biliary drainage and thus represents the
guideline recommended therapy for CFLD [4], we further
assessed whether liver stiffness and biomarker expression was
influenced by the treatment with UDCA. While TE values were
slightly increased in patients that received UDCA, the biomarkers
TIMP-4, Endoglin and PTX3 were not significantly altered
between CF patients with and without UDCA treatment (Figure
S3) and there was no association between the duration of UDCA
therapy and liver stiffness and biomarker expression (data not
shown).
Expression of serum markers of hepatic fibrosis correlates
with hepatic staging
Based on the above results we hypothesized that serological
expression of TIMP-4, Endoglin and Pentraxin-3 might correlate
with hepatic staging as determined by liver histology. However,
due to the high percentage of children (35.6%) in our CF patient
cohort and as liver staging by histology has further been
controversially discussed or even to be unreliable in focally
distributed liver disease as seen in CFLD, we did not assess liver
histology in our CF patients. We instead assessed serum expression
of TIMP-4, Endoglin and Pentraxin-3 in 18 patients with HCV
that underwent liver histology during routine clinical care.
Interestingly, serum levels of all three biomarkers were comparable
and without significant differences between patients with CFLD
and patients with HCV liver disease (Figure 8A). When serum
levels of TIMP-4, Endoglin and Pentraxin-3 were then compared
between HCV patients with complete fibrosis/cirrhosis (F = 4) and
those HCV with portal fibrosis with few or numerous fibrotic
septae but without cirrhosis (F = 2/3), significantly increased levels
of TIMP-4 and Endoglin in HCV patients with complete fibrosis/
cirrhosis were found. Pentraxin-3 remained unchanged in the
different HCV fibrosis stages (Figure 8B). Taken together, these
results suggest that increased expression of TIMP-4 and Endoglin
represents a mechanism specific for hepatic fibrosis that correlates
with hepatic staging but is irrespective of the underlying etiology of
liver disease.
Diagnostic performances of biomarkers of hepatic
fibrosis and transient elastography for the detection of
CFLD
Based on these results, we hypothesized that the observed
increased expression of TIMP-4 and Endoglin in CFLD might
well be usable in diagnostic approaches. To provide an outlook on
a potential diagnostic utility of TIMP-4, Endoglin and TE for
CFLD, we first compared the agreement of TIMP-4, Endoglin
and TE measurements to levels of ALT, AST, cGT and ALP as
Figure 4. Assessment of chemokines in patients with CFLD. Relative expression of 31 different chemokines regulating the migration of
monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (A) were determined from pooled serum from patients with established CFLD (n = 4) and those without
liver disease (n = 4). All proteins were determined in duplicate and based on optical densitometry of the corresponding bands (B), proteins were
identified that were at least 2-fold differentially regulated in patients with CFLD compared to those without. CX3CL1, CXCL1, CCL1, IL-16, CXCL10 and
MIP-3b were at least 2-fold increased in CFLD whereas IL-8 and CCL17 was at least 2-fold decreased in patients with CFLD compared to those without

commonly used and established parameters for CFLD diagnostic
in Bland-Altman Analyses. As shown in Figure 9, TIMP-4 and
Endoglin showed very good agreement with ALT (Figure 9A) and
AST (Figure 9B) levels. Comparison of the concordance of TE and
levels of ALT (Figure 9A), AST (Figure 9B) and cGT (Figure 9C)
showed good agreement of the different methods likewise;
however, a greater bias was observed with higher average values.
Further, when clinical cholestasis markers were compared with the
novel modalities for CFLD diagnosis assessed in this report, BlandAltman Analyses revealed the presence of a proportional error in
the agreement of cGT and the biomarkers TIMP-4 and Endoglin
(Figure 9C) and in the agreement of ALP and TE (Figure 9D).
We then aimed to directly compare the diagnostic performance
of TIMP-4, Endoglin and TE as novel diagnostic markers for
CFLD to clinical markers of hepatopathy. Importantly, the liver
enzymes AST, ALT and cGT were part of the diagnostic
algorithm used for identification of patients with CFLD in this
study, thereby making it impossible to assess their diagnostic
performance accurately and objectively within this study. To
counteract this potential selection bias of AST, ALT and cGT in
their assessment of the diagnostic value of common clinical
markers, we instead calculated the diagnostic performances of the
AST/Platelets-Ratio-Index (APRI) as a non-invasive fibrosis index
[25,26] and that of alkaline phosphatase, which also has not been
part of the diagnostic algorithm to diagnose CFLD. As assessed in
ROC analyses, with and AUROC of 0.908 TE exhibited an
excellent accuracy for the detection of CFLD. Further, with an
AUROC of 0.702 and 0.693, Endoglin and TIMP-4 exhibited a
good accuracy for CFLD diagnosis (Table 2). Importantly, TE
exhibited a by far superior diagnostic accuracy for CLFD
compared to APRI and ALP whereas the biomarkers Endoglin

liver disease (n = 28). Pentraxin-3 serum levels were significantly decreased in patients with CFLD whereas serum concentration of hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) was unchanged between CF patients with and without CFLD.

and TIMP-4 exhibited a better (AP) or almost equal diagnostic
accuracy (APRI) when compared to the clinical markers (Table 2).
At a cut-off of 8.6 ng/ml for Endoglin and 1603 pg/ml for
TIMP-4, the sum of sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be
maximal for the detection of CFLD (Table 3).
Importantly, when Endoglin or TIMP-4 at these cut-off values
were then combined with TE for the diagnosis of CFLD, the
diagnostic sensitivity of TE improved considerably: for TE alone, a
diagnostic sensitivity of 82% was calculated; when TE was
combined with TIMP-4 or Endoglin, the sensitivity improved to
100% and 88%, respectively. As a result, the negative predicative
value was also considerably improved when TE was combined
with TIMP-4 and Endoglin compared to TE alone. The
diagnostic performances of TE, Endoglin, and TIMP-4 alone or
combined and in comparison to the clinical markers ALP and
APRI are shown in Table 3.
Discussion
Currently established approaches used for diagnosis and followup of CFLD exhibit certain limitations such low sensitivity (liver
enzymes, ultrasound), invasiveness and sampling error (biopsy),
exposure to radiation (CT scan) or high costs (MRI) [27].
However, as CFLD occurs in approximately 30% of all CF
patients [1,2,28] and in 5 to 10% of CF patients progression
towards multilobular cirrhosis occurs early in life [1,2], reliable
non-invasive diagnostic tests for CFLD are urgently needed.
Regarding the special requirements in children, non-invasive tools
should also enable a fast but still accurate CFLD screening in daily
practice and allow for cost-effective longitudinal follow-up.
With the intention to identify novel candidate protein acting as
serum markers of liver disease, we initially screened a broad range
of serum protein in patients with and without CFLD using a
proteome profiling approach. Based on these results we then
quantified expression of TIMP-4, Endoglin, HGF and Pentraxin-3
as promising and novel serum markers in a larger cohort of CF
patients and comparatively analysed their diagnostic value for the
detection of CFLD compared to that of TE. Our results provide
evidence (i) that serum TIMP-4 and Endoglin are significantly
increased in patients with CFLD compared to those without while
serum Pentraxin-3 levels are significantly decreased in CFLD
patients; (ii) that TIMP-4 and Endoglin show highest expression in
patients with complete liver fibrosis/cirrhosis as exemplified in
HCV patients (iii) that TIMP-4 and Endoglin exhibit a good
diagnostic accuracy for the detection of CFLD; (iv) that the
determination of serum TIMP-4 and Endoglin together with
transient elastography can increase the diagnostic sensitivity for
the non-invasive detection of CFLD.
Our results of elevated liver stiffness in patients with CFLD
corroborate the results of previous studies. In a cohort of pediatric
patients with liver disease of various etiologies, among them 20
patients with CF, Breton and co-workers showed that patients with
liver disease had significantly increased liver stiffness values [29].
Specifically, in CFLD, Witters and co-workers recently demonstrated that adults and children with CFLD had a significantly
elevated mean liver stiffness of 8.8 kPa compared to 5 kPa in
individuals without CFLD [13]. In a very recent report, it was
further shown that CF patients with CFLD had increased TE
values compared to patients without CFLD, with highest liver
stiffness measurements seen in patients with cirrhosis [21].
Interestingly, with a mean liver stiffness of 9.95 kPa in patients
with CFLD compared to 4.3 kPa in those without CFLD, we
found very similar data in our total patient cohort compared to
those described by Witters and colleagues. Furthermore, a cut-off
of 6.3 kDa was calculated to be optimal for the detection of CFLD
within the present study, thereby corroborating the cut-off defined
in previous studies on the detection of CFLD by TE [14,21].
Apart from TE, research has identified potentially powerful
quantitative serum biomarkers of hepatic fibrosis [14,15,16].
Above all, so called class I markers which are pathophysiological
derived from the metabolism of the extracellular matrix, directly
translate the molecular pathogenesis of fibrosis into clinical
application and therefore represent promising fibrosis markers
[15]. Generally spoken, an ideal marker for liver fibrosis should
have a high sensitivity and specificity, and should also be easily
assessable inexpensive, accurate, and reproducible for follow-up
[30]. Serum fibrosis markers are easily obtained and, unlike special
diagnostic procedures such as transient elastography that is mainly

liver stiffness measured by transient elastography, was significantly
increased in patients with CFLD (n = 17) compared to patients without
liver disease (n = 28) (CFLD: 9.95 kPa vs no CFLD: 4.3 kPa). CFLD was
diagnosed according to recent best practice guidelines [4].

limited to larger clinics and centers, are widely available and
therefore represent and an appealing possibility to fulfill these
outlined criteria. Given these considerations, we chose to screen a
broad spectrum of candidate proteins that might serve as serum
markers of liver disease and hepatic fibrosis in CFLD patients
using an unbiased proteome profiling approach. We simultaneously determined the relative expression of a total of 220 serum
proteins in patients with CFLD and those without. Our results
show that 36 serum proteins are at least 2-fold increased in
patients with CFLD. Among these up-regulated proteins, we
found several proteins that have been well described in the context
of hepatic fibrosis, e.g. such as LAP/TGF-ß1 [31,32], members of
the activin family [33], the plasminogen activator system such as
uPA [34], or members of the CX3C chemokine family such as
fractalkine [35]. Apart from that, our study identified further
proteins previously not been described in the context of liver
disease and fibrosis. Based on their relatively high abundance in
the proteome screen and there close pathophysiologic relation to
the metabolism of extracellular matrix and/or angiogenesis as key
events for the development of hepatic matrix deposition, we chose
to further validate and quantify the serum levels of TIMP-4,
Endoglin, Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and Pentraxin-3
(PTX3) in ELISA measurements in the whole CF cohort of 45
patients.
Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been
shown to be critically involved in hepatic fibrogenesis. Their
fibrogenetic potential is believed to be mediated by the inhibition
of ECM degradation and the subsequent accumulation of fibrotic
tissue [36]. Enhanced expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 occurs
in rat models of liver injury [37] and in various human liver
diseases [38]. In patients with chronic HCV infection, TIMP-1
mRNA levels correlate with the grade of liver fibrosis [39] and
HCV itself is able to stimulate TIMP-1 mRNA expression [40].
Serum TIMP-2 and liver TIMP-2 mRNA are also increased in
HCV induced liver disease [40,41]. TIMP-4 mRNA has been
shown to be increased in a model of experimental biliary atresia
[42], but apart from that data on the role of TIMP-4 for liver
disease and hepatic fibrosis are scarce. Due to their prominent role
in hepatic fibrogenesis, members of the TIMP-family have been
utilized in diagnostic panels and indices [43,44]. In this report, we
now show that TIMP-4 as a previously rather unrecognized
member of the TIMP-family is significantly increased in cystic
fibrosis associated liver disease. As a proof of principle in HCV
patients, we also provide evidence that TIMP-4 serum levels show
highest values in patients with complete liver cirrhosis. Further, in
the CF patient cohort TIMP-4 exhibited a high accuracy for the
detection of liver disease and when used in combination with
transient elastography for CFLD diagnosis, the diagnostic
sensitivity and negative prediction was considerably improved.

Thereby, TIMP-4 holds the potential to be a complimentary
serum marker that facilitates the accurate non-invasive assessment
of CFLD.
Endoglin is a TGF-b co-receptor that is involved in the
regulation of the activity of TGF-b signaling, a key cytokine for
hepatic fibrogenesis. Apart from endothelial cells, Endoglin is
expressed on a variety of profibrogenic cell populations such as
mesangial cells, scleroderma and cardiac fibroblasts and hepatic
stellate cells (HSC) [45,46,47,48]. A recent study has shown that
Endoglin expression is increased in transdifferentiating hepatic
stellate cells in vitro and in models of liver fibrosis in vivo [49]. As
mechanism of action, Endoglin interacts with and is phosphorylated by TbRII and it has been shown in vitro that overexpression
of Endoglin leads to TGF-b1-driven Smad1/5 phosphorylation
and a-smooth muscle actin expression in a HSC, thereby
promoting HSC activation [49]. First reports evaluated circulating
Endoglin levels in patients with liver disease of diverse etiologies
[50,51]. Here, high Endoglin levels showed a significant association with the severity of chronic liver disease [50,51], suggesting
an active role for Endoglin in the fibrotic process.
In this report, we observed a significantly increased Endoglin
expression in cystic fibrosis associated liver disease. Similar to our
observations for TIMP-4, Endoglin serum levels were highest in
HCV patients with complete liver cirrhosis, suggesting a close
relation to hepatic staging. Likewise, Endoglin exhibited a high
accuracy for the detection of CFLD and increased the diagnostic
sensitivity and negative prediction considerably when used in
combination with transient elastography. Thereby, our study
identifies Endoglin as a further promising serum marker with the
Figure 7. Increased serum levels of Endoglin and decreased concentration of pentraxin-3 in CF patients with increased liver
stiffness. CF patients with liver stiffness values above a threshold value of 6.3 kPa, indicative for CFLD, exhibited significantly
higher serum levels of Endoglin and significantly lower serum levels of pentraxin-3 compared to CF patients with liver stiffness
values below 6.3 kPa. TIMP-4 was also increased in patients with a liver stiffness above the threshold of 6.3 kPa, although these elevations did not
reach statistical significance. The cut-off value of 6.3 kPa for the identification of patients with CFLD was derived from ROC analyses as value at which
the sum of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the detection of CFLD was maximal (Table 3).

potential to improve the accurate non-invasive assessment of
CFLD.
Hepatocyte growth factor is a mesenchyme-derived growth
factor mainly produced by monocytes and hepatocytes. Although
originally believed to be a liver specific mitogen [52], HGF is now
recognized not only as a potent mitogenic growth factor on
hepatocytes, but rather as a pleiotropic factor that exhibits
mitogenic, motogenic, morphogenic, and antiapoptotic activities
on various cell types. In the liver, HGF is produced by
nonparenchymal cells, such as Kupffer cells, sinusoidal endothelial
cells (SECs), and HSCs and the degree of liver HGF expression
correlates with serum HGF levels [53]. The clinical significance of
serum HGF levels has been assessed in acute hepatic failure and
chronic liver diseases. In this respect it has been shown that HGF
serum levels correlate with hepatic fibrosis and might serve as a
prognostic maker in acute liver failure [54,55,56,57]. Although the
proteome screening within this report showed a relatively high
abundance in patients with CFLD compared to those without, we
were not able to verify this result in ELISA quantifications within
the whole CF cohort. It might be speculated that one of the
reasons for this might be due to the pleiotropic functions and lack
of liver specificity of HGF as discussed above.
Pentraxins comprise a superfamily of evolutionary wellconserved proteins that are characterized by the pentraxin
domains as a characteristic structural motif [58]. The short PTXs
CrP and serum amyloid P are produced in the liver in response to
inflammatory cytokines and therefore are classical acute-phase
proteins. PTX3, as a prototypic member of the long pentraxin
family, is induced primary upon inflammatory stimuli in a variety
of cells, including monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and
adipocytes [59]. Due to the prominent role in the crossroad
between innate immunity, ECM deposition and vascular biology
[59], PTX3 serum levels have been assessed in a variety of diseases
including vasculitis [60], myocardial infarction [61,62] and
systemic inflammation [63]. Importantly, serum PTX3 levels have
been shown to be increased in patients with non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) and also to correlate with the histological
staging in NASH [64]. As a rather unexpected result, we observed
a significantly decreased expression of PTX3 in patients with
CFLD rather an increase in our study. Similarly to HGF, it might
well be that these discrepancies are due to the multiple functions of
PTX3 on the one hand and also the different etiologies of liver
disease, i.e. non-focally distributed NASH compared to focally
distributed CFLD, on the other hand.
In conclusion, we used a proteome profiling based approach to
identify serum markers of CFLD within the current study. Our
results are the first to identify TIMP-4 and Endoglin as novel
serum markers that can accurately diagnose CFLD. Further, their

and Pentraxin-3 were comparable and without significant differences between patients with CFLD and those with HCV liver disease (top row, A). In
the cohort of patients with HCV liver disease, patients with complete fibrosis/cirrhosis (F = 4) exhibited significantly increased serum levels of TIMP-4
and Endoglin compared those HCV patients with portal fibrosis with few or numerous fibrotic septae but without cirrhosis (F = 2/3), whereas
Pentraxin-3 remained unchanged in the different HCV fibrosis stages (bottom row, B).
