Abstract
Aims: To determine the incidence of natural growth or regression of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in the liver. 
Material and Methods: We retrospectively included 120 consecutive patients who were diagnosed to have FNH on MRI. The 
mean follow-up duration was 19 months (range: 6–64 months). There were 25 men and 95 women (age range: 18–80 years; 
mean: 45 years). There were 167 FNH lesions in the 120 patients. MRI images were retrospectively reviewed for interval growth 
or regression of FNH. The maximum size of the lesions was measured on axial arterial-phase images of the initial and the last MRI 
examinations. An interval increase or decrease in diameter of over 10% of the initial diameter was considered as positive growth 
or regression, respectively. The use of Oral contraceptives was also documented. Results: Interval growth was seen in 25/167 
nodules (15%) over 7-48 months (mean: 21 months), with increase in size of 0.2-1.7 cm (mean: 0.6 cm) and percentage change 
of 10.5-340% (mean: 64%). Interval regression was seen in 13/167 (8%) of nodules over 7-63 months (mean: 22 months), with 
decrease in size of 0.2-0.9 cm (mean: 0.5 cm) and percentage change of 10.4-60% (mean: 24%).Five of 17 (29%) female patients 
with growing FNH and 25/78 (32%) female patients with non-growing FNH had a history of intake of oral contraceptives (P=0.83). 
Conclusions: Although FNH is benign and of no clinical significance, a substantial percentage of FNH shows interval growth or 
regression on long-term follow-up with MRI.

Introduction
Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a proliferation of 
normal non-neoplastic hepatocytes that is believed to be 
a local hyperplastic response to a vascular abnormality.[1]
FNH is asymptomatic in most patients and in such 
cases no treatment is necessary. Therefore, an accurate 
differentiation of FNH from other significant focal liver 
masses is important.
Imaging diagnosis of FNH has rapidly improved with the 
introduction of multi-modality imaging techniques such 
as MRI,[2-3] contrast-enhanced USG,[4-5] and CT scan.[6] FNH, 
being a benign entity, can be confidently diagnosed with 
hepatobiliary-specific MRI examination. Most institutions 
do not biopsy FNH as the risks of the procedure outweigh 
the benefits. The use of a hepatobiliary-specific contrast 
agent for MRI studies has been reported to give very high 
specificity in differentiating FNH from hepatic adenomas 
by demonstrating the uptake of the hepatobiliary agent by 
FNH in the hepatobiliary-specific phase.[2]
Increase or decrease in the size of FNH during follow-up 
is reported to be rare. Mathieu et al,
[7] in a 9-year study 
in 216 women with FNH, reported that a change in FNH 
size was seen in only 4 of 136 FNH (2.9%) cases, with size 
reduction in three cases and size increase in one case. In 
our experience, however, FNH with considerable interval 
size increase or decrease is more common than has been 
reported in prior studies.

The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of 
natural growth or regression of FNH in the liver.
Materials and Methods
Our institutional research ethics board approved this 
retrospective study and waived the need for patient consent.
We performed an electronic search of the radiology database 
using the keywords ‘FNH,’ ‘MRI’, and ‘MultiHance’ and 
identified 150 patients diagnosed to have FNH in the 
liver on gadobenatedimeglumine (MultiHance®, Bracco 
Imaging)-enhanced MRI over a 3-year period. Of these, 
120 patients underwent two or more contrast-enhanced 
MRI scans performed at least six months apart and these 
patients were selected for inclusion in in this study. These 
120 subjects included 25 men and 95 women in the age 
range of 18-80 years (mean: 45 years). All patients in our 
study were asymptomatic at initial diagnosis and remained 
symptom free throughout the follow-up period.
Of the 120 patients, 33 patients (28%) had more than one 
FNH nodule, and the remaining 87 patients (72%) had a 
single lesion. In cases with multiple lesions, we included 
up to four of the largest lesions in each patient. Mostly, 
all lesions had typical imaging characteristics for FNH on 
MultiHance® MRI. Thus, our final study sample included 
167 FNH lesions in 120 patients. The interval between the 
first and last MRI examinations ranged from 6 to 64 months 
(mean: 19 months).
The diagnosis of FNH was made by histopathology in 9/120 
(8%) patients. Diagnoses in the remaining 111 patients 
were confirmed by the characteristic MRI findings and the 
absence of risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
Typical signal intensity characteristics on T1W and T2W 
images (i.e., slightly hypointense or isointense to the normal 
liver on T1W images and slightly hyperintense or isointense 
to the normal liver on T2W images) [Figure 1A and B]; 
and marked enhancement in the arterial phase [Figure 1C] 
without later washout [Figure 1D] (negative enhancement 
relative to the normal liver).[3] Characteristic MRI imaging 
findings for FNH include isointensity or hyperintensity 
on 2-h delay gadobenatedimeglumine-enhanced MRI[2]
[Figure 1E].
MRI
MRI was performed on a 1.5-T system (Excite™ HD, GE 
Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI)with an 8-channel phased-array 
torso coil. Imaging sequences included a breath-hold axial 
T1W dual fast gradient-recalled-echosequence (in-phase 
and out-of-phase sequences) (TR/TE, 150/2.3 and 4.5 msec; 
flip angle, 75°; field of view, 35×35 cm; matrix, 256×192; 
section thickness, 5-8 mm; intersection gap, 0 mm); a breathhold axial T2W fast-recovery fast spin-echosequence with 
spectral fat saturation (TR/TE, 2600/90; echo-train length, 17; 
field of view, 35×35 cm; matrix, 256×160; section thickness, 
5-7 mm; intersection gap, 1 mm; one signal acquired); a 
respiratory-triggered axial T2W single-shot fast spin-echo 
sequence with spectral fat saturation (TR/TE, infinite/180 
msec; field of view, 35×35 cm; matrix, 256×192; section 
thickness, 5-7 mm; intersection gap, 0 mm); and breathhold axial three-dimensional LAVA (liver acquisition with 
volume acceleration) dynamic T1W images with spectral 
fat saturation (TR/TE, 4.7/2.2 msec; field of view, 35×35 cm; 
matrix, 384×160; section thickness, 5 mm; intersection gap, 
0 mm) at unenhanced, arterial (15-s delay), portalvenous 
(50-s delay), late portal venous (85-s delay), delayed (300-s 
delay), and late hepatobiliary specific phases (2-h delay). 
Gadobenatedimeglumine (MultiHance®, Bracco Imaging), 
0.1 mmol/kg, was injected intravenously, followedby a 
saline flush.
Analysis
All MRI images were retrospectively reviewed by the author 
who measured the single largest transverse diameter of 
each FNH lesion and identified the presence or absence of 
interval increase in size. The measurement was performed 
on an arterial-phase image of a contrast-enhanced T1W 
sequence, by using a measurement tool in the PACS system 
(eFilm™, Merge Healthcare). A size increase or decrease 
of more than 10% of the initial diameter was considered to 
be interval growth or regression, respectively. To prevent 
miscalculation from technical differences, a size change 
of ≤10% was not considered as growth or regression. 
For lesions showing interval growth or regression, the 
differences in the diameters between the initial and last MRI 
examinations and the percentage increase or decrease of the 
initial diameter were calculated. The growth or regression 
rate was also calculated by dividing the difference of the 
diameters between the initial and last MRI examinations 
by the follow-up period. The initial size of the FNH was 
compared among growing, stable, and regressing FNH 
using the Student’s t-test. In addition, the mean age of the 
patients and the mean interval between the initial and last 
MRI examinations were compared among the three groups 
using the Student’s t-test. Statistical significance was defined 
as P ≤0.05.
A chart review of all 120 patients was also performed 
to document the use of oral contraceptives during the 
follow-up period. The relationship between the use of 
oral contraceptives and the interval growth of FNH was 
evaluated using Fisher exact test.
Results
Among the 167 FNH lesions, 25/167 (15%) in 20 patients 
showed interval growth of FNH [Figure 2A-C] during the 
follow-up of 7-48 months (mean: 21 months). The interval

change in size ranged from 0.2 to 1.7 cm (mean: 0.6 cm) and 
interval percentage change in size ranged from 10.5% to 
340% (mean: 64%). Growth rate was 0.003-0.141 cm/month 
(mean: 0.033 cm/month), with a percentage change of 0.34-
14.6% (mean: 3.34%) per month. Thirteen of the 167 FNH 
lesions (8%) in 11 patients showed an interval regression 
during the follow-up of 7-63 months (mean: 22 months) 
[Figure 3A-C]. The interval change in size ranged from 0.2

rate was 0.004-0.085 cm/month (mean: 0.019 cm/month), 
with a percentage change of 0.36-8.57% (mean: 1.9%) per 
month. The remaining 129/167 (77%) FNH lesions in 110 
patients were stable in size during the follow-up period of

6-64 months (mean: 19 months). Eighteen of 120 patients 
had multiple FNH lesions with different rates of interval 
change. There was no statistically significant difference in 
the follow-up periodsbetween the growing, regressing, and 
stable FNH groups (P>0.43).
The initial size of all FNH lesions ranged from 0.5 cm to 9.9 
cm (mean: 3.3 cm). The initial size of the lesions was 0.5-7 
cm (mean: 1.7±1.7 cm) in the growing FNH group, 0.8-9.9 
cm (mean: 2.8±1.8 cm) in the stable FNH group, and 1.0-4.2 
cm (mean: 2.3±1.2 cm) in the regressing FNH group. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the initial size 
among the three groups (P>0.06). The age of the patients 
ranged from 26 years to 61 years (mean: 43 years) in the 
growing FNH group, from 26 years to 54 years (mean: 44 
years) in the regressing FNH group, and from 18 years to 
80 years (mean: 45 years) in the stable FNH group. There 
was no statistically significant difference in the mean age 
between the three groups (P>0.39).
Only 5 of 17 (29%) women in the growing FNH group were 
on oral contraceptives, whereas 25 of 78 (32%) women with 
non-growing FNH were on oral contraceptives during the 
follow-up period. There was no statistically significant 
difference in the use of oral contraceptives between the two 
groups (P=0.83).
Discussion
There have been conflicting results regarding the natural 
history of FNH. Although the majority of the studies have 
shown that interval growth of FNH is extremely uncommon, 
there are occasional reports of FNH cases with interval 
regression.[7-10] The largest series is by Mathieu et al,
[7]
who followed 216 patients for 9 years and showed a size 
change of FNH in only 4/136 (3%). Three cases with interval 
regression and one with interval growth.
In our study, interval growth of FNH was seen in 20/120 
patients (17%) and interval regression in 11/120 (9%). The 
incidence of growing FNH in our series of 120 cases was 
higher than in the study by Mathieu et al.[7] The reason for 
the difference is not clear. One possible explanation is the 
difference in the sizes of FNH between the two studies. 
In our study, the size of FNH at the time of detection was 
much smaller than in prior studies; the mean size of FNH in 
our study was 2.6 cm, while in the study of Mathieu et al[7]
it was about 6cm.
FNH is believed to be a hyperplastic response to an 
underlying vascular insult.[1] It is reasonable to assume that 
FNH will grow in the early stages of development until it 
reaches its maximum size. Therefore, any interval growth 
of FNH will be more frequently observed if the lesion is 
first detected when it is small and is still growing. Recent 
advances in imaging techniques have enabled the detection 
of small incidental focal liver lesions and therefore there is 
a higher chance of observing a growing FNH.
The growth rate of FNH in our study was 0.003-0.141 cm/
month (mean: 0.03 cm/month), with a percentage change 
of 0.34-14.16%/month (mean: 3.3%/month). This is much 
lower than the growth rate of HCC, which doubles in size 
at an average of 6.5 months according to the study by Ebara
et al.[11] The slow growth rate of FNH can be one of the key 
features differentiating it from hepatic malignancy in these 
occasional cases of growing FNH.
Our study shows that there is no correlation between the 
interval growth of FNH and the use of oral contraceptives, 
suggesting that it is not necessary to discontinue oral 
contraceptives for patients with FNH. This result is in 
agreement with the studies by Mathieu et al[7] and Bonney
et al.[12] In fact, FNH was first described long before the 
advent of oral contraceptives. Also, the incidence of FNH 
remained steady after the introduction of oral contraceptives 
in 1960, whereas there was a dramatic rise in the incidence 
of hepatic adenomas with the widespread use of oral

homogeneously enhancing mass (arrow), with a central nonenhancing scar. The mass measures 4.2 cm in its maximum dimension. Thirty-sixmonth follow-up dimeglumine-enhanced MRI in the arterial phase (B) shows an interval decrease in the size of the mass (arrow) to 3.4 cm. The 
mass (arrow) is isointense relative to the liver in the hepatobiliary-specific phase (2-h delay) (C), with a central nonenhancing scar; the appearance 
is consistent with FNH

contraceptives.[13] Our study also showed that there was 
no significant difference in patient age among the three 
groups (growing, regressing, and stable FNH) at the time of 
diagnosis. The age distribution of growing and regressing 
FNH included a wide range, from young to middle age. It 
is noteworthy that none of the patients in this study group 
were symptomatic or had any complications throughout 
the follow-up period.
A limitation of this study is the lack of histologic 
confirmation of a large proportion of the FNH. We applied 
strict diagnostic criteria in cases without histologic proof, 
including characteristic findings of FNH on Gd-BOPTAenhanced MRI.[3] Positive enhancement on the hepatobiliaryspecific phase of Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI is known to 
be highly specific for FNH diagnosis.[2] Our review of the 
literature on FNH suggests that other researchers have 
encountered a substantial number of FNH lesions that 
were confirmed by imaging alone, without biopsy.[2,4,7,14]
Moreover, histopathological diagnosis with a small biopsy 
sample obtained via percutaneous biopsy can also be 
challenging.[15]
Noninvasive imaging diagnosis of typical cases of FNH is 
now widely advocated[16] and it will not be reasonable or 
ethical to perform biopsy for FNH with characteristic MRI 
findings.
In summary, although FNH is benign and clinically non 
significant, in our study of 167 FNH cases, 17% of FNH 
showed interval growth and 9% showed interval regression.
