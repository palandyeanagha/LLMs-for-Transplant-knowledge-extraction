In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), broke out 
in the Chinese province of Wuhan and rapidly infected hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. Infected patients 
mostly exhibit general signs of pneumonia (fever, dyspnea, 
coughing and desaturation) and a presumably signifcant 
number of infected patients are asymptomatic. Yet, about 
5–10% of patients develop critical oxygen deprivation, needing intensive care and intubation with mechanical ventilation (Huang et al. 2020; Raoult et al. 2020). Typical acute 
phase laboratory fndings are present in admitted COVID-19 
patients, e.g. elevated c-reactive protein and ferritin. Also, 
lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are often elevated in 
COVID-19 patients, indicating liver damage (Zhou et al. 
2020). Recent reports point to the fact that liver injury, by 
means of increased aminotransferase levels, more frequently 
occurred in severe COVID-19 cases compared to patients 
with mild symptoms (Zhang et al. 2020; Guan et al. 2020; 
Liu et al. 2020a, b; Chen et al. 2020).
SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding onto angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Gurwitz 2020). Until today, 
no strong evidence is present that ACE2 is expressed in the 
liver, although a recent, non-peer reviewed, article reported 
its expression in cholangiocytes (Hamming et al. 2004; Chai 
et al. 2020).
Retrospective analysis of the earlier-reported SARS-CoV, 
causing the ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)’ and 
also infecting humans via ACE2, showed that the disease 
was accompanied by abnormal liver function which could 
be due to viral replication in the liver (Cui et al. 2004). It is 
indeed known that multiple (respiratory) viruses can disrupt 
liver functions via (CD8+) immune cell-mediated reactions 
(Adams and Hubscher 2006).
It has been reported that patients sufering from certain viral infections, such as infections caused by hepatitis 
C and human immunodefciency viruses, are more prone 
for developing drug-induced liver injury (DILI), especially 
when associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy 
(Naidoo et al. 2019; Bonacini 2004). Recently it was postulated that liver impairment in COVID-19 patients could also 
be drug-related (Zhang et al. 2020). This may have consequences for patients who are treated with novel, potentially 
hepatotoxic, antiviral drugs and perhaps also antibiotics for 
bacterial superinfections (Xu et al. 2020a, b). Hydroxychloroquine is applied as an antiviral drug, with sparse evidence 
in small clinical settings. Yet, viral replication and disease 
progression would be reduced and overall survival would 
increase. The efect of hydroxychloroquine on hepatic tissue seems ambiguous, since it is used to treat liver infection with protozoa (i.e. malaria) but cases of fulminant 
hepatic failure have been reported (Makin et al. 1994; Liu 
et al. 2020a). Azithromycin would have additional efects 
to hydroxychloroquine. However, there is little evidence 
and the underlying mechanisms are unclear (Gautret et al. 
2020). Furthermore, azithromycin-induced hepatotoxicity 
only appears 1–3 weeks after azithromycin initiation (Martinez et al. 2015).
Patients sufering either from diabetes type 1 or 2, or 
developing hypertension, often receive blood pressure 
reducing ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type I receptor 
blockers, which may lead to ACE2 overexpression. Therefore, although clinical evidence is lacking, it has to be kept 
in mind that ACE2 upregulation might be at the origin of 
a higher susceptibility for developing COVID-19 (Fang 
et al. 2020; Fitzgerald 2020). Furthermore, these patients 
often sufer from the metabolic syndrome, which is a major

risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
NAFLD can sensitize the liver for hepatotoxicants such 
as acetaminophen (Michaut et al. 2014; Massart et al. 
2017), which is the advised and widely used anti-pyretic 
symptomatic drug treatment. Although it is actually not 
known whether a link exists between COVID-19 and 
liver steatosis, it is worrying that in a recent post-mortem
histopathological analysis of a liver biopsy of a COVID19 patient microvesicular liver steatosis was observed 
(Xu et al. 2020a, b). Even though this fnding needs to 
be confrmed in larger studies, it has also been demonstrated that patients sufering from COVID-19 exhibited 
increased serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (Huang et al. 2020), which is a chemokine 
known to exacerbate steatohepatitis (Gao and Tsukamoto 
2016). Consequently, pre-disposing factors for developing steatohepatitis, such as intake of steatosis-inducing 
drugs (e.g. sodium valproate, amiodarone, tamoxifen and 
methotrexate) (Boeckmans et al. 2018), could play a role 
in combined COVID-19 and DILI. Knowing that liver dysfunction and NAFLD are more common in the elderly, 
who are also more prone to develop severe COVID-19, it 
is probably wise to carefully monitor COVID-19 patients 
for drug treatment that could lead to DILI.
In vitro methodologies are well-positioned to study 
potential DILI of compounds currently being developed 
against COVID-19. Relatively simple human-relevant cell 
models can be used to evaluate hepatotoxic properties of 
(novel) drugs in a relatively short time. This has been 
robustly demonstrated for a large series of compounds 
(Rodrigues et al. 2016; Kuna et al. 2018). Also co-morbidities such as NAFLD that increase the risk for developing 
DILI can be modeled using in vitro methodology (Massart et al. 2017; Boeckmans et al. 2019). Recently, Huh7 
and Vero E6 cells in culture have been used to assess the 
pharmacological efects of remdesivir, chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine, all potential anti-COVID-19 treatments under study (Liu et al. 2020a; Wang et al. 2020). 
Hence, in vitro methodologies can be easily explored for 
increasing our knowledge with respect to the pharmacological concern and concomitant toxicological aspects of 
COVID-19 treatment.
Overall, despite the indications that SARS-CoV-2 
infection might have an infuence on normal hepatic functions and the fact that drugs are used for the treatment 
of COVID-19 that have proven hepatotoxic properties 
(whether or not due to overdosing), more mechanistic 
studies regarding SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in 
liver cells and the potential consequences of medication 
for vital organs, including the liver, are warranted.
