Abstract
Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of liver resection in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) patients with preoperative renal dysfunction (RD).
Methods Data from 735 patients undergoing primary liver resection for HCC between 2002 and 2014 were analyzed.
Short- and long-term outcomes were compared between the RD group, defined by a preoperative estimated
glomerular filtration rate of \45 mL/min/1.73 m2
, and the non-RD group.
Results Sixty-two patients had RD. The incidence of postoperative pleural effusion (24 vs. 11%; P = 0.007) and
major complications (Clavien–Dindo III–V; 31 vs. 15%; P = 0.003) were significantly higher in RD patients. In RD
patients with Child-Pugh A, 90-day mortality rate (1.9%) and median survival time (6.11 years) were comparable to
that of non-RD patients. In contrast, RD patients with Child-Pugh B had a very high 90-day mortality rate (22.2%),
and a significant shorter median survival time compared to non-RD patients (1.19 vs. 4.84 years; P = 0.001).
Conclusions Liver resection for Child-Pugh A patients with RD is safe and has comparable oncological outcomes
compared to non-RD patients. However, selection of liver resection candidates from Child-Pugh B patients with RD
should be stricter.

Introduction
With the recent advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management techniques, liver resection has
become a safe surgical procedure with a low mortality rate
[1–3]. Furthermore, liver resection is now performed in
patients with preoperative comorbidities. Renal dysfunction (RD) has been reported as a risk factor for the
development of postoperative complications, such as
massive ascites, respiratory failure, or acute renal failure,
in patients undergoing hepatic resection [4–7]. Another
concern in RD patients is the risk of needing postoperative

initiation of hemodialysis. Until now, only one study [6]
has reported liver resection in preoperative RD patients not
requiring hemodialysis postoperatively.
The prognosis of patients with preoperative RD following resection has remained controversial [4–7]. While
Toshima et al. [6] and Kaibori et al. [4] have reported that
preoperative RD has no influence on long-term outcomes
after liver resection, Orii et al. [5] demonstrated a significantly worse overall survival (OS) in RD compared to nonRD subjects.
Currently, little is known about the impact of preoperative RD on the short- and long-term outcomes of hepatic
resection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The aim of the present study was to establish a set of
criterion for surgical indication for HCC patients with
preoperative RD.
Materials and methods
This study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Ethics Review Board of the University of Tokyo
(No. 2158). Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients.
We enrolled 735 HCC patients who had undergone liver
resection for the first time at a tertiary care hospital in
Japan between October 2002 and July 2014. Of them, 62
had preoperative RD. Disease progression and resectability
statuses were assessed by imaging studies, including contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography. Liver function
impairment caused by an underlying liver disease was
assessed by liver function testing, evaluation of Child-Pugh
class, and estimation of the indocyanine green retention
rate at 15 min [8]. Preoperative ascites was considered a
contraindication to surgical resection. There was no patient
with a history of hepatorenal syndrome. When pleural
effusion was suspected by routine chest X-ray postoperatively, ultrasound examination was performed, and paracentesis was performed when an effusion was detected. A
repeat paracentesis was performed by the same manner
when necessary. The chest tube was removed when the
amount of discharge decreased to less than 200 mL/day. To
evaluate the feasibility of liver resection in HCC patients
with RD, the primary endpoint of our study was short-term
outcomes (postoperative complications and 90-day mortality) after hepatectomy. The secondary endpoint was
long-term outcomes [median survival time (MST)].
Diagnostic criteria for RD
Preoperative RD was defined by a preoperative estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of \45 mL/min/1.73 m2
and chronic kidney disease [9] Stage 3B or higher; Stage
3B chronic kidney disease is reportedly associated with the
sharpest rise in the overall risk profile [10–12]. Non-RD
was defined as an eGFR C45 mL/min/1.73 m2
.
Major liver resection was defined as resection of 3 or
more Couinaud’s segments. Portal hypertension (PHT) was
diagnosed on the basis of the presence of esophageal
varices or splenomegaly associated with a platelet count of
\10 9 104 cells/mL [13–15]. Postoperative complications
were recorded and graded according to the Clavien–Dindo
classification system [16]. Pleural effusions treated by
diuretics were considered as Grade II, while pleural effusion treated by paracentesis was considered as Grade IIIa.
Postoperative mortality was defined as death within
90 days of surgery.
Perioperative management of patients with RD
Application of criteria for liver resection and selection of
surgical procedures were made regardless of renal function.
All RD patients were referred to the nephrology team.
Hemodialysis was performed immediately when the postoperative serum potassium level was [6 mEq/L. For
patients on maintenance hemodialysis, the hemodialysis
was scheduled to be performed the day before surgery,
postoperative day 1 or 2, and then three times per week
thereafter. If pulmonary edema was suspected, continuous
hemodiafiltration was immediately performed. Potassium
canrenoate was routinely administered to reduce ascitic
fluid drainage in patients with normal renal function
[3, 17]; however, this drug was administered with caution
in RD patients while checking the serum potassium or
creatinine level to avoid hyperkalemia or exacerbation of
renal function. The ascitic fluid drainage volume was
measured daily. Patients with normal renal function and
RD patients not requiring maintenance hemodialysis
received a fluid infusion of 40 mL/kg/day (patients with
liver cirrhosis) or 45 mL/kg/day (patients without liver
cirrhosis) [3, 17]. The total fluid infusion volume was
restricted as follows in patients under hemodialysis to
avoid pulmonary edema: total fluid infusion = urinary
output ? ascitic fluid drainage and pleural effusion aspirated volumes ? insensible water loss. Ascitic fluid collection included discharge from the thoracic tube,
abdominal tube, and gauze oozing. Insensible water loss
was calculated as 12 mL/kg/day.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using JMP 11 software
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Categorical variables
were analyzed by the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, as
appropriate. Continuous variables were analyzed using the
World J Surg (2018) 42:4054–4062 4055
123

Mann–Whitney U test; P\ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Overall survival curves were determined
using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the
log-rank test. A multivariate analysis was performed using
a logistic regression and backward elimination procedure;
P \0.10 was set as the cut-off value for elimination.
Because we used the backward elimination procedure, the
multivariate analysis was independently executed. The
following 10 variables were examined as potential risk
factors for postoperative pleural effusion and major complication: a positive serum test for the hepatitis C virus
antibody, Child-Pugh class B, platelet count \10 9 104 -
cells/lL, 15-min indocyanine green retention rate [15%,
liver cirrhosis, blood loss [500 mL, operative time
[300 min, intraoperative red blood cell transfusion, serum
albumin \3.5 g/dL, and eGFR \45 mL/min/1.73 m2
. We
performed a 1:1 match using logit (propensity score)
through the nearest available matching to evaluate the
effect of comorbidities (diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease) on postoperative outcomes. Propensity
scores were created using logistic regression model.
Results
Patient characteristics
Sixty-two patients had RD, and 16 received routine preoperative hemodialysis. Diabetic nephropathy (33 patients,
53%) was the most frequent cause of preoperative RD in
the study participants, followed by hypertensive
nephropathy (nine patients, 15%), glomerulonephritis (four
patients, 6.5%), post hemi-nephrectomy (four patients,
6.5%), drug induced nephritis (two patients, 3.2%), and
IgA nephropathy (two patients, 3.2%). The preoperative
characteristics of non-RD and RD patient groups are
summarized in Table 1. The median age (70 vs. 67 years;
P = 0.0005), the incidence of diabetes mellitus (30 vs.
65%; P \0.001) and cardiovascular disease (11 vs. 37%;
P \0.001) in RD patients were significantly higher than in
non-RD patients. Tumor characteristics are shown in
Table 2. There were no significant differences in tumor
characteristics between RD and non-RD patients.
Intraoperative characteristics of non-RD and RD
groups
As listed in Table 3, intraoperative characteristics were
comparable for all patients, except for blood loss and the
percentage of patients requiring red blood cell transfusion
that were higher in the RD group.
Short-term outcomes
The incidence of pleural effusion and a major complication
was significantly higher in the RD than in the non-RD
group (Table 3). The median postoperative hospital stay
was not significantly different between the groups. There
was no mortality during surgery or within 30 days after
surgery. Three cases in each RD and non-RD group died
within 90 days after surgery. In the non-RD group, two
patients died due to the rapid recurrence of tumor and one
due to cholangitis. In the RD group, two patients died due
to the rapid recurrence of tumor, while one due to pneumonia. Two patients in each group, including the 90-day
mortality evaluation, died during hospitalization. Figure 1
shows the incidence of pleural effusion (Fig. 1a) and
90-day mortality rate (Fig. 1b) according to renal function
and Child-Pugh class. A remarkably high incidence of
pleural effusion and mortality rate were observed in RD
and Child-Pugh B patients. The median eGFR values in
Child-Pugh A patients with RD decreased from postoperative day 7 (37.8 mL/min/1.73 m2
) to days 14 (33.1 mL/
min/1.73 m2
) and recovered to a preoperative level
(36.6 mL/min/1.73 m2
) between days 30 (35.3 mL/min/
1.73 m2
) and 90 (37.4 mL/min/1.73 m2). None of the
Child-Pugh A patients with RD developed postoperative
acute kidney failure requiring emergent hemodialysis. In
RD with Child-Pugh B group, two patients needed
hemodialysis postoperatively. Univariate analysis of pleural effusion is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Multivariate analysis carried out to determine risk factors for
postoperative pleural effusion identified an eGFR\45 mL/
min/1.73 m2 (risk ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval,
1.32–4.70; P = 0.0063) as significant independent risk
factors (Table 4). We also performed univariate (Supplementary Table 1) and multivariate analyses (Table 4) for
major complication. Blood loss [500 mL, an eGFR
\45 mL/min/1.73 m2
, and hepatitis C virus infection were
found to be the independent risk factors for major complication in multivariate analysis.
Long-term outcomes
The median follow-up time was 5.07 (95% CI 4.60–5.42)
years. During the follow-up period, 25 of the 62 RD
patients died. The causes of death were cancer (n =17),
cerebrovascular disease (n =3), acute myocardial infarction
(n = 2), pneumonia (n =1), ARDS (n =1), and a traffic
accident (n =1). There was no death related to liver failure.
MST was 5.48 years in the RD group and 7.66 years in the
non-RD group, with the difference marginally significant
(P = 0.059; Fig. 2a). MST for Child-Pugh A patients
(9.30 years) were significantly higher than that of ChildPugh B patients (4.63 years; P\ 0.001; Fig. 2b). In Child4056 World J Surg (2018) 42:4054–4062
123

Pugh A patients, the OS was similar between RD (MST,
6.11 years) and non-RD groups (MST, 9.74 years;
P = 0.514; Fig. 2c). On the other hand, in Child-Pugh B
patients, the OS in the RD group was significantly worse
than that in the non-RD group (MST, 1.19 vs. 4.84 years;
P = 0.001; Fig. 2d). The median recurrence-free survival
time did not differ between RD patients and non-RD
patients [1.62 years (CI 0.78–5.21 years) vs. 1.78 years (CI

1.45–2.11 years), P = 0.589] (Fig. 2e). We also investigated the effect of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
(MELD) score in RD patients (Supplementary Fig. 1a). OS
was different between high MELD group (MELD score
C10) and low MELD group (MELD score \10) (MST:
3.72 vs. 3.94 years, P = 0.039). However, a model based
on Child-Pugh grade (Supplementary Fig. 1b) showed
better discrimination of OS than a model based on the
MELD score.
Characteristics of hemodialysis and nonhemodialysis groups
We evaluated the effect of preoperative routine
hemodialysis in RD patients with Child-Pugh A. Of the 53
RD patients with Child-Pugh A, 16 (30.2%) were under
routine hemodialysis. There were no significant differences
in postoperative outcomes and MST after resection
between these two groups (Supplementary Table 2).
Impact of portal hypertension in RD patients
with Child-Pugh A
In Child-Pugh A patients with RD, six patients were
diagnosed with PHT (three with splenomegaly with a
platelet count of \10 9 104 cells/mL, two with the presence of esophageal varices, and one with both). There were
no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative
pleural effusion (33 vs. 19%; P = 0.592), major complications (33 vs. 19%; P = 0.592), and MST (6.32 vs.
5.69 years; P = 0.402) between RD patients with and
without PHT in Child-Pugh A patients group.
Impact of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular
disease
Because the occurrence of preoperative diabetes mellitus
and cardiovascular disease was significantly higher in the
RD group, we performed propensity score matching using
these covariates (Supplementary Table 3). After matching,
the frequency of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease was 65 and 37%, respectively, in both groups. The rate
of postoperative pleural effusion was higher in the RD
(24%) than in the non-RD group (8.1%; P = 0.026). The
rate of major complication and 90-day mortality were
higher in the RD group; however, the difference was not
significant. MST was 5.48 and 6.85 years in the RD and
non-RD groups, respectively (P = 0.557). These findings
were similar to those obtained before matching.

Discussion
The current study revealed that liver resection for ChildPugh A HCC patients with RD was safe and had comparable oncological outcomes compared to non-RD patients.
However, selection of liver resection candidates from
Child-Pugh B HCC patients with RD should be more
stringent.
In Child-Pugh A patients with RD, liver resection was
associated with a relatively low 90-day mortality rate
(1.9%) and acceptable 5-year OS rate (61.6%), with no
significant difference in MST after surgery between RD
and non-RD groups (6.11 vs. 9.74 years; P = 0.514).
Conversely, the prognosis of Child-Pugh B patients with
RD was significantly worse than that of non-RD patients.
In RD patients, OS in Child-Pugh B patients was significantly worse than in Child-Pugh A patients (MST, 6.11 vs.
1.19 years, P \0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Moreover, 90-day morality was very high (22.2%) in RD
patients with Child-Pugh B. Thus, while liver resection is a
good therapeutic choice for HCC patients with RD and
Child-Pugh A, it is not the optimal therapeutic choice for
RD patients with Child-Pugh B (Fig. 3).
Furthermore, we also assessed the impact of the type of
resection (major or minor liver resection) and the presence
of liver cirrhosis and found no significant difference in the
short- and long-term outcomes (pleural effusion: 29 vs.
22%, P = 0.740; 90-day mortality: 12 vs. 2.2%, P = 0.180;
and MST: 2.70 vs. 5.69 years, P = 0.057) between major
and minor liver resections. Moreover, liver cirrhosis did
not increase the postoperative risk (pleural effusion: 38 vs.
20%, P = 0.118; 90-day mortality: 0 vs. 6.7%, P = 0.560;
and MST: 5.69 vs. 4.79 years, P = 0.893) compared with
normal liver or chronic hepatitis. In RD patients, the liver
function (Child-Pugh grade) was considered to be the
principal factor. Because we selected the type of resection
based on liver function in addition to the extent of disease
progression [3], major liver resection was not opted in
patients with poor liver function. This selection of the type
of resection possibly affected the analysis of postoperative
outcomes based on the type of resection. Although MELD
score was reportedly to be useful in predicting postoperative outcomes after liver resection, a model based on the
Child-Pugh grade showed better discrimination of OS than
a model based on the MELD score in RD patients.
Postoperative renal function was well preserved in RD
and Child-Pugh A patients, and none of them needed
urgent postoperative hemodialysis. Only two RD patients
with Child-Pugh B required urgent postoperative
hemodialysis due to multiple organ failure caused by
pneumonia or a rapid progression of recurrent cancer.
Toshima et al. [6] reported that none of their patients with
preoperative RD required urgent hemodialysis during
hospitalization. Although Squires et al. [7] reported that
preoperative renal insufficiency was associated with an
increased risk of renal failure requiring initiation of dialysis, the results of Toshima et al., as well as our own,
indicate that surgical resection may not induce acute renal
failure necessitating urgent hemodialysis. The previously

reported median interval from the first diagnosis of RD to
initiation of hemodialysis therapy is 6.1–14.2 months
[18, 19]. In RD patients with Child-Pugh A, postoperative
hemodialysis was initiated in seven out of 37 cases who
were not on preoperative hemodialysis. The median interval from surgery to initiation of hemodialysis was
38.5 months (IQR 16.0–63.2 months). These data suggest
that liver resection may not affect the timing of initiation of
hemodialysis.

is an additional problem (900 mL in RD vs. 650 mL in
non-RD group, P = 0.023). In the RD group, 27 out of 62
RD patients (44%) were treated by antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs for comorbidities such as cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, RD patients had a
higher incidence of preoperative anemia than non-RD
patients. Therefore, the intraoperative blood loss and red
blood cell transfusion might have been higher in RD
patients. To increase serum hemoglobin, administration of
erythropoietin or transfusion might be considered preoperatively in RD patients.
RD was identified as a significant risk factor for postoperative pleural effusion. Nobili et al. [20] demonstrated
four independent risk factors for the development of
pleural effusion; however, they did not identify preoperative RD as a risk factor. This is probably due to the small
number of RD patients in their study (11 patients) compared to ours (62 patients). Toshima et al. [6] demonstrated
that RD was at an increased risk of massive ascites and
pleural effusion. Our results were consistent with this
report. All RD patients developing postoperative pleural
effusion in our study required diuretics or paracentesis [12
patients (80%) required paracentesis]. The incidence of
pleural effusion did not differ significantly in patients with
or without preoperative cardiovascular disease (11 vs. 12%,
P = 0.736). Although patients with pleural effusion had a
longer median hospital stay (23 vs. 15 days, P \0.001), it
was not considered that pleural effusion correlated to
mortality.
Because the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome requires
the presence of ascites [21], and surgery is contraindicated
for patients with ascites at our institution, a major part of
hepatorenal syndrome is estimated to be excluded. However, subclinical hepatorenal syndrome might exist.
Although the rate of Child-Pugh B patients undergoing
liver resection is higher in Japan (10.3%) [22] compared to
those in Western countries or China (3.9–6.4%) [23–26],
the present criteria provide universally useful information
for surgical decision making in Child-Pugh B patients.
One of the limitations of the current study is its retrospective and single-institute design, and the relatively
small number of patients with RD (n = 62). The number of
patients with RD was significantly smaller than patients
without RD, and the results may have been biased because
of limited statistical power. Furthermore, the number of
Child-Pugh B patients with RD was extremely small
(n = 9), which may have affected the statistical significance. Another limitation of this study is the low rate of
laparoscopic liver resection (3.0%), which reportedly
decreases the rate of postoperative ascites and shortens
hospital stay [27–29]. Thus, our proposal of surgical indication needs validation at centers where laparoscopic liver
resections are more frequently performed. The impact of
RD on outcomes after liver resection has been reported in
eight studies [4–7, 30–33]. Of these, four studies deduced
that RD itself was not a surgical contraindication, whereas
one study suggested the need for careful patient selection.
In the present study, we first revealed that preoperative RD
had an important impact on the postoperative outcome,
especially in Child-Pugh B patients. To the best of our
knowledge, our study is the largest single-institution series
of liver resections for HCC patients with RD and impaired
liver function. Further studies are needed using large registry databases.
In conclusion, liver resection for Child-Pugh A HCC
patients with RD is safe and has comparable oncological
outcomes compared to non-RD patients. However, selection of liver resection candidates from Child-Pugh class B
HCC patients with RD should be stricter.
