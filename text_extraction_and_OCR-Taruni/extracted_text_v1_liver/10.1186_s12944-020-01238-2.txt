Abstract
Background: The importance of the lipid-related biomarkers has been implicated in the pathological process and
prognosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Our work was conducted to discuss and compare the predictive
ability of the neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (NHR) with other existing prognostic
indices, for instance, the monocyte to HDL-C ratio (MHR) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to
HDL-C ratio (LDL-C/HDL-C) in elderly patients with AMI.
Methods: Our population was 528 consecutive elderly AMI patients (65–85 years) who were enrolled from Tongji
Hospital and grouped according to the cutoff points which were depicted by the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC). The Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted with the survival data from the follow-up to investigate the difference
between cutoff point-determined groups. Moreover, we assessed the impact of NHR, MHR, LDL-C/HDL-C on the
long-term mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction (RMI) with Cox proportional hazard models.
Results: Mean duration of follow-up was 673.85 ± 14.32 days (median 679.50 days). According to ROC curve analysis,
NHR ≥ 5.74, MHR ≥ 0.67, LDL-C/HDL-C ≥ 3.57 were regarded as high-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis resulted that the
high-NHR, high-MHR and high-LDL-C/HDL-C groups presented higher mortality and RMI rate than the corresponding
low-risk groups in predicting the long-term clinical outcomes (log-rank test: all P < 0.050). In multivariate analysis,
compared with MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C, only NHR was still recognized as a latent predictor for long-term mortality
(harzard ratio [HR]: 1.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 3.75, P = 0.044) and long-term RMI (HR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.04
to 4.79, P = 0.040). Furthermore, the positive correlation between NHR and Gensini score (r = 0.15, P < 0.001) indicated
that NHR was relevant to the severity of coronary artery to some extent.

Conclusions: NHR, a novel laboratory marker, might be a predictor of the long-term clinical outcomes of elderly
patients with AMI, which was superior to MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C.

myocardial infarction
Introduction
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a serious form of
coronary artery disease (CAD), is a significant cause
of death worldwide, particularly in the elderly population [1]. Actually, the elderly AMI patients who may
have poor prognosis could be greatly improved by
timely and appropriate intervention measures [2].
Based on this, the discovery of prognosis-related biomarkers could benefit considerably to the oriented
treatment and the prognostic evaluation in coronary
infarction [3–5]. Thus, to find an efficient predictor is
urgently needed.
Nowadays, the general public have more in-depth
understanding of the correlation between serum lipid
level and CAD [6]. In addition, as for single lipids,
some lipid ratios could be well applied to predict
CAD and the associations were of comparable magnitude [7]. For instance, the ratio of monocyte to highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MHR) [8, 9]
and the ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) to HDL-C (LDL-C/HDL-C) were found to
have correlation with poor prognosis in cardiovascular
diseases [10, 11].
It was showed that the inflammation and the abnormal lipid metabolism took a critical part in plaque
formation and atherosclerosis in the development of
AMI [12–15]. Circulating neutrophils played a causative role in the immuno-inflammatory responses of
the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [16]. Neutrophils
abundance was strongly connected with the incidence
of cardiac adverse events [17]. On the contrary, recent investigations suggested that the HDL-C was inversely related to the risk of CAD and could be
highly predictive of its prognosis [18]. What’s more,
previous clinical and experimental studies indicated
that HDL could regulate the function of activated
neutrophils [19]. In contrast, activated neutrophils
could also affect the composition and function of
HDL [20]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the neutrophil to HDL-C ratio (NHR), a potential new lipid
biomarker, might reflect the inflammation level and
the lipid profile in a quantitative manner. With these
considerations, our work was conducted to compare
the predictive value of NHR with other two
hematological parameters (including MHR and LDLC/HDL-C) in elderly AMI patients.
Methods
Patients
In current work, the data of 528 patients (65–85 years)
with AMI in the Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology
between January 2016 and December 2017 were collected. Permission to accomplish the study was received
from the institutional board review committee (TJC20141112). This study followed the principles of the
Declaration Helsinki.
In our study, the patients were admitted with AMI
within 1 month of symptom onset. The eligible population corresponding to AMI diagnosis standards
mainly included the patients who was defined as STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, typical symptoms of myocardial ischemia lasting for > 30
min, with ST-segment elevation > 1 mm in ≥2 contiguous leads and/or new onset of left bundle branch
block) [21] and without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, a rise of myocardial injury markers in combination with typical symptoms
of myocardial ischemia and without ST-segment elevation) [22].
Here were the exclusion criteria. (1) Patients who were
younger than 65 or older than 85 years. (2) Patients who
had sepsis or trauma. (3) Patients who were diagnosed
as active cancer, hematological proliferative diseases,
autoimmune diseases, pulmonary arterial hypertension,
end-stage liver disease or renal failure. (4) Patients who
took medications including any steroid therapy or
chemotherapy around the diagnosis period, thrombolytic
therapy and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.
Clinical data collection
Current study evaluated the demographic data from
medical records including age, sex, smoking status,
and the anamnesis (such as the history of CAD,
hypertension, diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases).
We collected the vital signs (heart rate, systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure) and Killip class at
admission. Besides, the data of pharmacotherapy during hospitalization were included as well.
In all the patients, a routine blood test was performed immediately after admission. Laboratory results included complete blood cell counts (white
blood count [WBC] and its subtypes, hemoglobin),

aminopherase, creatinine, serum lipid (triglycerides,
total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, and myocardial injury markers. Also, we gathered the result of left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from cardiac
ultrasonography.
Coronary angiography (CAG)
The CAG was performed based on the actual clinical
situation and the results were determined by two professional cardiovascular physicians. Based on the clinical
findings, physicians would select different treatment
strategies (such as percutaneous coronary intervention
[PCI], coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], and medical therapy) in the light of corresponding practice
guidelines [23]. Furthermore, we also collected data of
thrombolysis in myocardial infarction trial (TIMI) blood
flow grade and Gensini score (an angiographic scoring
system assessed the severity of a coronary artery) from
the electronic medical records database.
Clinical follow-up and study end points
The endpoints of present study were all-cause mortality
and recurrent myocardial infarction (RMI) that happened during the follow-up period. All-cause mortality
was defined as death from any cause. RMI was defined
as recurrence of AMI whether the reinfarction area located in the original or other site [24]. Follow-up of all
patients were began from the first day after discharge
until December 2018. The access to information during
follow-up was performed through standard telephone
interview with patients or their relatives at regular
intervals.
Statistical analysis
NHR, MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C were calculated by the
formula respectively: NHR = neutrophil / HDL, MHR =
monocyte / HDL and LDL-C/HDL-C = LDL-C / HDL-C.
In baseline characteristics analysis, continuous variables
were presented as mean ± standard error and tested for
normal distribution by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
For the comparison of variables between groups, the
parametric/nonparametric tests (continuous variables)
or Chi-square test (categorical variables) was selected according to the type of variables. Using Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to find out the optimal
cutoff points of NHR, MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C.
Kaplan-Meier curve for survival analysis was plotted to
assess the prognosis between index-determined subgroups with log-rank test. The Spearman correlation coefficient was computed to calculate the correlation
between two variables. Univariate analyses were performed to determine the significance of prognostic variables. Any variables examined in the univariate analysis
for which the P < 0.10 or several conventional risk factors for AMI (such as age, gender, smoking status, and
previous history of CAD, hypertension, diabetes) were
contained in the forward stepwise multivariate model. A
value of P < 0.05 was supposed to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
Version 22.0.
Results
ROC curve analysis
ROC curve was analyzed in search of the cutoff value of
NHR, MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C for the evaluation of
long-term clinical outcomes in elderly AMI patients. All
of these results were presented in Fig. 1. For NHR, the
area under the curve (AUC) was 0.69 (P < 0.001, 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.63 to 0.76). The cutoff point
was observed at 5.74, with a sensitivity of 77.60% and a
specificity of 50.80%. (Fig. 1a). Accordingly, the AUC for
MHR was calculated as 0.60 (P = 0.004, 95% CI: 0.53 to
0.68; Fig. 1b). The cutoff value for MHR was found to be
0.67, with a sensitivity of 47.40% and a specificity of
73.40%. Moreover, the AUC for LDL-C/HDL-C was 0.59

(P = 0.017, 95% CI: 0.51 to 0.66) with a cutoff point at
3.57 (sensitivity 34.20%, specificity 85.30%; Fig. 1c). Consequently, the AUC for NHR was larger than those for
MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C and it preliminarily presented
better predictive value for the prognosis in elderly AMI
patients.
Baseline characteristics
As shown in Table 1, the total number of 528 patients
were collected and grouped by cutoff points as described
above. 333 of the 528 patients were male (63.07%) and
the population were aged between 65 and 85 years old
(72.66 ± 0.23). Diagnoses included: 268 patients with
STEMI and 260 patients with NSTEMI.
In the groups divided by the NHR < 5.74 and NHR ≥
5.74, results showed that there were clinically statistical
differences among two groups in terms of medical history of diabetes (P = 0.007), vital signs at admission (P =
0.013; P < 0.001), LVEF (P = 0.001). Elevated level of
NHR was associated with increased WBC and its subtypes (P < 0.001, respectively), so was in platelet count
(P < 0.001), but not with lymphocyte count (P = 0.142)
and hemoglobin (P = 0.536). Moreover, patients in
NHR ≥ 5.74 were more likely to have worse hepatorenal
function (P ≤ 0.001, respectively) and decreased concentration of HDL-C (P < 0.001).
In the groups divided by the MHR < 0.67 and MHR ≥
0.67, it was noted that there were statistic differences in
age (P = 0.048), gender (P < 0.001), smoking status (P =
0.021), the function index of heart and liver and kidney
and the level of serum lipid as well as the complete
blood counts (P < 0.050, respectively). In terms of the
data grouped by the cut-off point of LDL-C/HDL-C, no
statistically significant between-group differences for the
primary outcomes were detected, except for the level of
serum lipids (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.002,
respectively).
The angiographic characteristics were reported in
Table 2. When grouping by NHR, no significant differences were discovered in the culprit vessel location and
the CABG therapy, except for the culprit vessel quantity
(P < 0.001), onset to reperfusion time (P < 0.001), tirofiban use (P = 0.038), stent use (P = 0.030), thrombus aspiration use (P = 0.001), the multi-vessel PCI therapy
(P = 0.006), the TIMI grade (P < 0.001) and Gensini
score (P = 0.003). In the groups divided by the MHR <
0.67 and MHR ≥ 0.67, it was resulted that the CAG outcomes were worse in the high-risk group. What’s more,
it was the same in the LDL-C/HDL-C grouping.

Survival analysis
The Kaplan-Meier Curve were plotted with the eventfree surival data from the follow-up. Mean duration of
follow-up was 673.85 ± 14.32 days (median 679.50 days).
The long-term mortality in the high-risk groups were
significantly higher than low-risk groups (log-rank tests:
all P < 0.001, Fig. 2a-c). As shown in Fig. 2d-f, it was indicated that patients in the high-risk groups had significantly worse long-term RMI than patients in the lowrisk groups (log-rank tests: P = 0.002, P = 0.010, P =
0.023, respectively).
Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses
In multivariate regression analysis, Gensini score (hazard
ratio [HR]: 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.01, P = 0.034), Killip
class (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.31, P < 0.001), WBC
(HR:1.09, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.16, P = 0.005), hemoglobin
(HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97 to 0.99, P = 0.001) and the NHR
(HR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.02 to 3.75, P = 0.044) were found as
independent predictors of long-term mortality, but not
with MHR (P = 0.237) or LDL-C/HDL-C (P = 0.092)
(Table 3). Moreover, for predicting long-term RMI, we
found that NHR (HR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.04 to 4.79, P =
0.040) was still the potential predictor along with gender
(HR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.22 to 4.23, P = 0.010), Killip class
(HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.33, P = 0.001) and monocyte
(HR: 3.47, 95% CI: 1.46 to 8.26, P = 0.005), but not with
MHR (P = 0.505) and LDL-C/HDL-C (P = 0.248)
(Table 4).
Correlation analysis between lipid ratios and Gensini
score
As shown in Fig. 3, a weak but significant positive correlation between NHR and Gensini score in our population (r = 0.15, P < 0.001; Fig. 3a), so was in LDL-C/HDLC (r = 0.12, P = 0.007; Fig. 3c). It was found that there
was no correlation between MHR and Gensini score
(r = 0.05, P = 0.259; Fig. 3b).

Discussion
In our work, our results presented that higher level of
NHR was associated with higher risk of long-term mortality and RMI. NHR has a superior prognostic value for
long-term clinical outcomes in elderly patients compared
with MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C. Moreover, there was a
positive correlation between NHR and the severity of a
coronary artery. This study appears to be novel to assess
the prognostic role of NHR for long-term outcomes in
elderly AMI patients. The results of present study mainly
applied to patients aged between 65 and 85 years.
Recent studies have payed more attentions to the linkage between lipid-related biomarkers and cardiac disease. Previous studies reported that the elevated MHR
has greater risk of the worse prognosis in AMI [25–27].
Besides, in a prospective cohort study, the high level of
LDL-C/HDL-C was discovered to be related with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events [28]. From
the survival analysis, our results were consistent with
previous studies. Actually, the etiology of AMI was complicated, included alternated lipid metabolism, inflammatory reaction, oxidation injury, and other pathological
processes [29–32]. Herein, we hypothesized that the
NHR, a novel index composed of inflammatory cell and
lipid cholesterol, might reflect the inflammatory status
and the lipid metabolism more comprehensively. In the
present study, the prediction abilities of NHR and other
two existing ratios (MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C) were
compared in univariate and multivariate analyses. After
adjusting for confounding factors, our results suggested
a possible better prediction ability for NHR levels in
long-term clinical outcomes, compared with MHR and
LDL-C/HDL-C.
From our analysis, we attempted to explain the result
that higher NHR was associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Neutrophil was an indispensable component participating in the immuno-inflammatory response of AMI
[33, 34]. An increase in neutrophil has been verified at the
site of coronary lesion [35]. Recent evidences indicated
that elevated level of myeloperoxidase from the neutrophil
could give rise to coronary atherosclerosis [36, 37]. Yunoki
et al. pointed out that plasma myeloperoxidase levels were
inversely correlated with HDL-C and serum paraoxonase1 (PON-1) concentrations and activities [38]. It was supposed that the interaction between myeloperoxidase and
HDL-C in the circulation may decrease serum PON-1
levels. Besides, Park et al. reported that the risk of cardiovascular death and RMI appeared higher in the patients
with lower level of HDL-C level [39]. Previous studies
showed that HDL-C was engaged in the inhibition of the
inflammation and oxidation [40, 41]. According to the
Murphy’s study, the ability of HDL-C to inhibit neutrophils activation, attachment, diffusion, and migration
might be related to the abundance of lipid rafts [16].
Above all, because of the interaction of increased neutrophils and decreased HDL-C in AMI, an elevated NHR
might be related to the inflammatory activity and the abnormal lipids metabolism. Besides, as for the complex
interactions between neutrophil and HDL-C, the combined indicator of NHR might be more reliable than single parameter. That was consistent with the results from
the present study. On top of all, as a new predictor for
the prognosis of AMI patient, NHR could be calculated
from the complete blood count on admission, which is
quick and convenient.
Gensini score was an indicator to evaluate the severity
of coronary artery disease [42]. Specifically, different
weight coefficients were assigned to different coronary
artery branches according to their severity, which was
conducive to reflect the severity of the disease objectively. Based on our results, NHR was positively correlated with Gensini score and was an effective predictive
factor for long-term clinical outcomes. The combined
application of the NHR and Gensini score might be
more helpful for clinicians to identify the high-risk patients with AMI. Further studies are needed to validate
this hypothesis.
We have to acknowledge that there were some limitations in this study. First, the retrospective design of the
study sets a limit to the convincement of our study. Secondly, we could not compare the lipid ratios with other
conventional inflammatory markers, for instance, Creactive protein, fibrinogen, or myeloperoxidase. Because
they were not routinely obtained in our study population. Thirdly, the patients were admitted with AMI
within one month of symptom onset. Thus, the neutrophil level might not be static across this period of time.
Lastly, our results did not show the well established link
between diabetes and mortality. It might be because of
the differences in sample size, study design, population
selection, statistical method, outcome measurement and
so on.
Conclusion
In summary, we observed that NHR might has a predictive value for prognosis in the long-term mortality and
RMI of elderly AMI patients, which is superior to both
MHR and LDL-C/HDL-C.
