Abstract
Patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are often ineligible for
resection or local ablation therapy due to poor liver function and/or difficult location. The aim
of this study is to evaluate therapeutic outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) compared with TACE alone for
HCC measuring less than 5 cm. From March 2011 to December 2016, 85 patients underwent SBRT with TACE (SBRT-TACE group) and 114 underwent TACE (TACE group) at 4
tertiary hospitals. Local control rate (LCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared after propensity-score matching (1:1 ratio). The SBRT-TACE
group showed significantly higher 1- and 3-year LCR than the TACE group (91.1% and
89.9%, respectively vs 69.9% and 44.8%, respectively; P < 0.001). The SBRT-TACE group
showed better 1- and 3-year PFS than the TACE group (56.5% and 32.3%, respectively vs
42.2% and 21.6%, respectively; P = 0.022). However, 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was not different
between the SBRT-TACE and TACE groups (98.8%, 89.1% and 80.7%, respectively vs
99.7%, 83.3% and 71.0%, respectively; P = 0.206). In multivariate analysis, the overall
SBRT added to TACE did not contribute to extend PFS. However, in patients with less than
2 tumors, the combined therapy was effective (HR 0.590, 95% CI 0.392–0.889, P = 0.012).
SBRT-TACE is superior to TACE in terms of LCR. Particularly, SBRT-TACE may be an
effective alternative in patients with HCC number (�2), which is not indicated for resection
or local ablation.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death
worldwide [1]. Resection is the standard treatment for early-stage HCC [2]. However, many
patients are not indicated for resection or ablative therapy because of advanced cirrhosis or
tumor location [3]. Surgery is not indicated for elderly patients in poor general condition.
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is usually performed as an alternative treatment [4,
5]. The effect of TACE is well established especially in patients with Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage B. Unfortunately, the response rate of conventional TACE is relatively low
(40%), and therefore, regarded as a palliative treatment [6, 7].
Traditionally, radiotherapy (RT) played a limited role due to radiation-induced liver disease
(RILD) [8]. Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a new modality of
HCC treatment. Technological advances allow RT using high doses of radiation to conform to
the target volume safely [9, 10]. Compared with conventional RT as a palliative approach,
which is associated with low local control (LC), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) results
in a high rate of LC, by delivering a high dose of radiation in a few fractions to small HCC
[11]. Further, adjuvant SBRT following TACE is an effective treatment modality in relatively
medium-sized HCC [12]. With advances in radiation technology, RILD after SBRT treatment
was tolerable even in patients with Child-Pugh (CP) score �7 [13].
However, the efficacy of SBRT combined with TACE compared with TACE alone is
unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of SBRT and TACE combination versus
TACE alone on tumor response and patient survival.
Methods
Patients
Data of HCC patients who underwent TACE as an initial treatment between March 2011 and
February 2016 were reviewed at four tertiary referral hospitals (Soonchunhyang University
Seoul, Bucheon, Cheonan Hospital, and Gangneung Asan Medical Center). Patients following
the inclusion criteria were selected: 1) tumor size �5 cm of long diameter, and �3 lesions present; 2) ineligible for resection or local ablative therapies; and 3) CP class A or B. The exclusion
criteria were as follows: 1) previous treatment of resection or radiofrequency ablation or
TACE; 2) extrahepatic metastasis; and 3) presence of vascular invasion or portal vein tumor
thrombosis. The diagnosis of HCC was made by using dynamic imaging technique [14].
One hundred fourteen patients were treated with TACE alone (TACE group) while eighty
five patients were treated with TACE in combination with SBRT (TACE-SBRT group). The
selection criteria for TACE and SBRT were mainly determined by considering tumor vascularity, hepatic angiography, accessibility, risk of bleeding or liver toxicity. We conducted propensity score matching to minimize the differences in underlying confounding factors between
the two groups (1:1 ratio). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Soonchunhyang University Seoul, Bucheon, Cheonan Hospital, and Gangneung Asan Medical
Center, and written informed consent was waived because of the retrospective study.
TACE
TACE was performed via the common femoral artery using an angiographic catheter followed
by selection of feeder vessels of hepatic segments. Patients were treated with a mixture of intraarterial adriamycin (50 mg/m2
) and lipiodol (5 to 10 mL) with gelfoam embolization at Soonchunhyang University Seoul, Cheoan, Bucheon Hospital and Gangeung Asan Hospital [15,
16].

SBRT
SBRT was carried out at Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital using the CyberKnife
Radiosurgery System (Accuray Incorporated, Sunnyvale, CA), Soonchunhyang University
Cheonan using the Novalis TX (Varian Medical Systems and BrainLab), Soonchunhyang University Bucheon using the TomoTherapy device (Madison, WI, USA) and Gangneung Asan
Medical Center using the TrueBeam medical linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo
Alto, CA, USA). SBRT was performed viable tumors that showed incomplete response after
first TACE based on follow-up CT. Patients were immobilized in supine position with arms
above their head. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was measured based on CT images at the endexpiratory phase fused with multi-phase MR images. Extension based on movement within
the gating phase (30–70%) from the GTV was set as the internal target volume (ITV). The
planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the volume with a 5 mm margin added to the
ITV. A total dose of 40–60 Gy (median, 55 Gy) was administered in the PTV of three to five
fractions over consecutive days or twice a week [13].
Liver toxicity
Liver toxicity was defined as worsening of CP score by 2 or more within 3 months or elevated
liver transaminases more than five times the upper normal limit after treatment [17].
Assessment
The primary endpoint included comparison of the overall survival (OS) in the SBRT-TACE
and TACE groups. The secondary endpoint was the comparison of LC and progression-free
survival (PFS).
All patients were followed up every 1 to 3 months. Physical examinations, complete blood
cell counts, biochemical profiles, tumor markers, and three-phasic CT or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scans were performed at every follow-up visit. Complications were assessed
according to version 4 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Liver toxicity
was defined as elevated liver transaminases more than five times the upper normal limit or
worsening of CP score by 2 or more within 3 months after SBRT [17].
Statistical analysis
The OS, PFS and LC in each treatment group were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method
and log-rank test. OS was calculated from the date of diagnosis until the date of final follow-up
or death. PFS was estimated from the date of initial TACE until the date of extra- and/or intrahepatic disease progression, recurrence, or death. LC was defined as the absence of progressive
disease (PD) within the PTV as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
v1.1 in multiphasic CT or MRI. Lesions that developed or progressed outside the PTV in the
liver or lymph nodes were scored as regional PD and those developed in other organs as distant PD. Survival and control times were calculated from the start of SBRT. Time to progression and survival were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method [18]. Cox proportionalhazards model was used to evaluate the factors influencing PFS and OS rates.
To reduce the effect of potential confounding in a retrospective study, we also performed
rigorous adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics of patients using propensity
score methods (R version 3.1.2, ‘MatchIt’ package). The SBRT-TACE and TACE groups were
matched 1:1 to maximize the propensity score match. Age, gender, tumor size, number of
tumors, Child-Pugh score, and BCLC stage were selected on the basis of this score, and calculated from baseline characteristics. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All

statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical package (version 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics before and after propensity score matching
After propensity score matching at a 1:1 ratio, the SBRT-TACE and TACE groups comprised
85 patients, respectively. No significant differences in sex (P = 0.858), age (P = 0.894), tumor
number (P = 0.816), tumor size (P = 0.753), etiology (P = 0.778) and CP score (P = 0.663) were
observed (Table 1).
Local control, progression-free survival and overall survival after
propensity score matching
The SBRT-TACE group showed significantly higher 1-, 3- and 5-year LC rates than the TACE
group (91.1%, 89.9% and 89.9%, respectively vs. 69.9%, 44.8% and 44.8%, respectively;
P < 0.001) (Fig 1). The SBRT-TACE group showed better 1- and 3- year PFS than the TACE
groups (56.5% and 32.3%, respectively vs. 42.2% and 21.6%, respectively; P = 0.022) (Fig 2).
However, 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was not different between the SBRT+ TACE and TACE groups
(98.8%, 89.1% and 80.7%, respectively vs. 99.7%, 83.3% and 71.0%, respectively; P = 0.206)
(Fig 3).
Prognostic factors for progression-free survival and overall survival after
propensity score matching
In multivariate analysis, BCLC stage (stage B) (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.701, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.635–8.379, P = 0.002), number of tumors (n�3) (HR = 2.710, 95% CI 1.494–
4.915, P < 0.001) and CP class B (vs. A) (HR = 1.945, 95% CI 1.183–3.197, P = 0.009) were
associated with poor PFS. After adjusting for other variables, SBRT-TACE showed a marginal
trend toward significance (HR = 0.695, 95% CI 0.480–1.005, P = 0.053) (Table 2).
CP class B (vs. A) (HR = 2.570, 95% CI 1.241–5.324, P = 0.011) and BLCL stage (stage B)
(HR = 5.835, 95% CI 1.719–19.801, P = 0.05) were significantly poor prognostic factors for OS.
Tumor size (HR = 1.179, 95% CI 0.746–1.863, P = 0.482) and tumor number (n�2: HR =
0.582, 95% CI 0.219–1.548, P = 0.278) (n�3: HR = 1.697, 95% CI 0.652–4.417, P = 0.279) were
not associated with OS (Table 3).
Subgroup analysis by tumor number
Based on previous studies, SBRT was more effective in patients with a small number of HCCs.
In our patients with less than two HCCs, the SBRT-TACE group showed better 1- and 3- year
PFS than TACE groups (61.0% and 42.2%, respectively vs. 47.6% and 21.6%, respectively;
P = 0.006) (Fig 4). SBRT-TACE group (HR = 0.590, 95% CI 0.392–0.889, P = 0.012) showed a
significantly increased PFS after adjustment for BCLC stage tumor size and CP class if a patient
had 1 or 2 HCC nodules (Table 4).
Liver toxicity
SBRT-TACE and TACE groups showed no difference in liver toxicity after treatment. Worsening of CP score by 2 or more within 3 months after treatment occurred in 8 out of 85 (9.4%) in
the SBRT-TACE group and 3 out of 85 (5.5%) in the TACE group, respectively (P = 0.119).
Elevated liver transaminases more than five times the upper normal limit after treatment

occurred in 8 out of 85 (9.4%) in the SBRT-TACE group and 4 out of 85 (4.8%) in the TACE
group, respectively (P = 0.239).
Discussion
Only 30–40% of HCC patients undergo curative treatment because many patients with earlystage HCC indicated for resection or local ablation already have advanced liver cirrhosis [19].
SBRT is an emerging technique for patients who are not indicated for radical therapy [20]. In
this study, we compared the therapeutic outcome of SBRT-TACE and TACE with propensity
score matching. The combination therapy of SBRT and TACE may be more effective than
TACE in terms of LC rate. Furthermore, in subgroup analysis, SBRT-TACE in patients with
HCCs less than 2 resulted in better PFS without increased liver toxicity. SBRT-TACE represents a favorable alternative for treatment of patients with HCCs less than 2.

As reported in most published clinical studies, SBRT was associated with a favorable LC
rate [11, 21, 22]. However, complete tumor response after TACE alone was a challenge [6, 7].
In our study, we reported high LC rate (89.9% at 3 years) in the SBRT-TACE group compared
with that of TACE group (44.8% at 3 years). Especially, SBRT resulted in high LC rates in
patients with small HCC similar to previous studies. Yoon et al. have reported that LC rate at 3
years was 100% in patients with tumors � 2 cm, and 93.3% in patients with tumors between

2.1–3 cm [11]. Takeda et al also have shown high local control rate (96.3% at 3 years) in HCC
(� 4cm) patients.[21] In a comparative study of SBRT versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA),
similar LC rates were found in patients with small HCC [23]. However, the LC rate of SBRT
was not satisfactory with increased tumor size [24, 25].

TACE combined with SBRT has been reported to be effective and safe for the treatment of
small- or medium-sized HCC [12, 26, 27]. Jacob et al reported that in patients with HCC
tumors measuring �3 cm, treatment with TACE-SBRT significantly decreased local recurrence in comparison with TACE alone[26]. In a study from Japan, complete response to therapy was noted in 29 (96.3%) patients belonging to the SBRT-TACE group and in only one
(3.3%) patient included in the TACE group (P < 0.001) [27]. In a prospective study,
SBRT-TACE showed a promising LC rate in HCC (<10 cm) [12]. We also suggest that
SBRT-TACE is an effective treatment for both small- and medium-sized HCC with a high LC
rate.
In the current study, we achieved better PFS in the SBRT-TACE group than in the TACE
group. However, in multivariate analysis, SBRT-TACE was not a predictive factor for PFS.
Tumor number (n�3), CP class B and BLCL stage B were associated with worse PFS (Table 2).
According to a previous study, multiple HCC nodules represented an important prognostic
factor in PFS [25]. We performed subgroup analysis with HCC number less than 2 and found
that SBRT-TACE was a significant prognostic factor of longer PFS (Table 4). In a study, which
was limited to patients with HCC carrying 1 to 2 concurrent liver tumors, SBRT resulted in a
better PFS than TACE (P < 0.001) and TACE was associated with worse PFS in multivariate
analysis (HR 3.35, P < 0.01) [28].
The effect of SBRT on survival is disputed. A randomized controlled study investigating the
efficacy of SBRT and SBRT with TACE has never been conducted. Previous studies reported
that OS of SBRT was not inferior to OS following curative treatment. In retrospective studies,
OS of SBRT was similar to that of RFA [23, 29]. Su et al suggested that SBRT and liver resection
provide similar 5-year OS for small HCC (74.3 vs 69.2%, P = 0.405) [30]. However, in this
study we did not show that OS of SBRT-TACE was better than that of TACE alone (P = 0.206)
(Fig 3). Multivariate analysis showed that SBRT-TACE did not increase OS (HR 0.722,
P = 0.324) (Table 3). Similar to our study, Sapir et al reported no difference in OS between
patients treated with TACE or SBRT after propensity score matching [28]. This study did not

show difference in OS between the two groups. Possible reasons for such results are described
below. First, various treatment modalities were performed for recurrence after TACE only or
TACE+SBRT. Second, baseline liver function was similar after propensity score matching. A
retrospective study has shown that long-term survival rates after TACE are comparable to
those after resection and RFA for small single-nodule HCC. That study explained that degree
of baseline liver dysfunction was more important than specific treatment modality itself [31].
Therefore, a prospective controlled trial comparing SBRT-TACE and TACE is warranted to
elucidate the survival effect of SBRT-TACE.
We analyzed the differences in liver toxicity after SBRT-TACE or TACE. The incidence of
worsening CP score or increased transaminase levels was slightly high in SBRT-TACE group.
However, it did not show statistical difference. Many clinical studies have reported that
patients did not experience severe radiation-induced liver damage after combined SBRT and
TACE [27, 32]. Therefore, SBRT-TACE is a safe option for patients with small HCCs.
This study has a few limitations. First, this study is retrospective. However, with propensity
score matching adjusting for potential confounders, this study comparing the benefits of
SBRT-TACE with those of TACE was well-balanced. Second, this study is a multicenter study,
with variation in devices across multiple institutions. All procedures were performed by the
same operator at individual hospitals. However, there was no difference in the treatment methods and response evaluation of HCC between in the four hospitals.
Conclusion
This study showed that SBRT-TACE compared with TACE is a feasible option for patients
with HCC (�5cm) without increased liver toxicity. SBRT-TACE increased LC rate. We suggest that the advantages of SBRT-TACE should be demonstrated in patients with small HCC.
SBRT-TACE is superior to TACE in terms of LCR. Particularly, SBRT-TACE has better PFS
than TACE in patients with HCC number (�2). SBRT-TACE represents an alternative treatment modality.
