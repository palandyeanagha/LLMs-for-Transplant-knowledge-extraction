Expanding bile leaks after blunt liver trauma require more aggressive treatment than contained bile 
leaks. In this retrospective study approved by institution review board, we analyzed if non-invasive 
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography (CEMRC) using hepatocyte-specifc contrast 
agent (gadoxetic acid disodium) could detect and characterize traumatic bile leaks. Between March 
2012 and December 2014, written informed consents from 22 included patients (17 men, 5 women) 
with a median age of 24.5 years (IQR 21.8, 36.0 years) were obtained. Biliary tree visualization and bile 
leak detection on CEMRC acquired at 10, 20, 30, 90minutes time points were independently graded 
by three radiologists on a 5-point Likert scale. Intraclass Correlation (ICC) was computed as estimates 
of interrater reliability. Accuracy was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic curves 
(AUROC). Biliary tree visualization was the best on CEMRC at 90minutes (score 4.30) with excellent 
inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.930). Of 22 CEMRC, 15 had bile leak (8 expanding, 7 contained). The 
largest AUROC of bile leak detection by three radiologists were 0.824, 0.914, 0.929 respectively on 
CEMRC at 90minutes with ICC of 0.816. In conclusion, bile leaks of blunt liver trauma can be accurately 
detected and characterized on CEMRC.
Biliary injuries can occur at the time of blunt liver trauma1–5
. Its frequency has been reported to range from 3% 
in low grade liver trauma to about 15% in high grade trauma1,3–10. However, the frequency may have been underestimated because biliary injuries are initially asymptomatic and manifestation of symptoms is always delayed 
for weeks until biliary injuries are complicated with superinfection or biliary tree obstruction3,5
. Expanding bile 
leaks associated with liver capsular rupture require more aggressive treatment as compared to contained bile 
leaks, similar to liver injuries with extracapsular vascular extravasation11. Terefore, complicated biliary injuries 
ofen require further diagnostic work up as well as complex therapeutic surgical or endoscopic treatment procedures4–7,12–14. Tese result in a higher medical cost, prolonged hospital stay or higher mortality rates in more 
severe cases3,13,14.
Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scan can serve as a test for bile leaks detection15,16. However, the lack of 
anatomical details on planar images can sometimes misinterpret radioactive tracer in duodenum or normal anatomical variant of biliary tree as bile leaks15. Delayed imaging up to twenty four hours is required for biloma 
confrmation and that is not practical among trauma patients15. Te site of biliary injuries and extent of bile leak 
can be directly evaluated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography3
. Tese diagnostic procedures are standard reference for biliary injuries and can also provide therapeutic 
intervention7
. In addition, intrahepatic fuid accumulation can be aspirated and analyzed for bile content, or it 
can be contrasted by percutaneous cavitography for evaluation if the intrahepatic fuid communicates with biliary 
tree17,18. However, all these invasive procedures can pose additional risks to recently injured patients. Terefore, 
they are rarely the frst-line diagnostic procedure for a suspected bile leak.

With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and introduction of hepatocyte specifc contrast 
agents, MRI has revolutionize hepatobiliary imaging. About 50% of the intravenously injected hepatocyte-specifc 
MRI contrast agent such as gadoxetic acid disodium is excreted by hepatocytes into biliary system shortening the 
T1 efect of bile on MRI19,20. Extravasation of this biliary contrast medium from biliary tree to the intrahepatic 
or perihepatic biloma is readily detected and easily diferentiated from other fuid collections21. Consequently, 
the gadoxetic acid disodium contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography (CEMRC) can be used to 
evaluate hepatic excretory function and anatomy of biliary tree19–22. However, most of the published reports on 
CEMRC are focused on liver tumors and post-operative bile leak20,23. Little has been mentioned about its acquisition time and efcacy for blunt biliary injuries detection.
Terefore, optimization of CEMRC for detecting and characterizing traumatic bile leaks was performed in this 
study. Our purpose is to analyze the diagnostic performance of CEMRC for traumatic bile leak and to compare 
diferent characteristics of bile leak (expanding or contained) with clinical parameters, specifc treatment and 
complication.
Results
Trauma characteristics of patients. A total of 22 patients were included in this study. All had recent major 
blunt liver trauma ≥grade III injuries according to scoring scheme of American Association for the Surgery of 
Trauma (AAST). Te initial contrast-enhanced CT showed focal traumatic distortion of liver architecture. Tree 
patients had other associated abdominal organs trauma such as spleen (n=2), kidney (n=1), duodenum (n=1) 
and pancreas (n=1). Te overall median injury severity score was 29 (IQR 17.0, 34.5).
Final decision and characterization of bile leak. Of 22 patients, 15 (68.2%) patients were determined to 
have bile leaks at expert-panel consensus decision. Among 15 of them, 7 were type I and 8 were type II bile leaks 
on CEMRC. Type I bile leak was confned, type II bile leak was expanding in the presence of liver capsule disruption. Additional examinations such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (n=3), percutaneous cavitography and bile stained aspirates (n=5) were available in this group. Of the other 7 patients who were determined to 
have no bile leak at expert-panel consensus decision, one was checked on by laparotomy to exclude biliary injury, 
two were confrmed by a negative result on percutaneous cavitography and aspirates analysis. Four others who 
recovered rapidly were clinically followed up. Tey did not develop any biliary complication and were cleared of 
biliary injury at panel decision.
Biliary tree visualization on CEMRC. In Table 1, the mean score of biliary tree visualization on CEMRC 
acquired at 10, 20, 30 and 90 minutes were 2.96, 4.17, 4.29 and 4.30 respectively. Te inter-rater reliability was 
good to excellent with ICC of 0.921, 0.787, 0.717 and 0.930 on CEMRC acquired at 10, 20, 30 and 90 minutes 
respectively. Te best biliary tree visualization was scored on CEMRC acquired at 90 minutes (Fig. 1) and this 
was substantiated by the best inter-rater reliability test. On the contrary, the poorest biliary tree visualization was 
scored on CEMRC acquired at 10minutes by all readers, and it was also supported by an excellent ICC.
Bile leak on CEMRC. Te median time to perform CEMRC afer blunt liver trauma for the group with a 
positive result of bile leak did not difer signifcantly from the group with a negative result (11th day versus 8th 
day, p=0.750), as well as for the group with type I bile leak from the group with type II bile leak (10th versus 12th 
day, p=0.221).
Te scores on bile leak detection among three readers increased from CEMRC acquired at 10 minutes to 
CEMRC acquired at 90minutes (Fig. 2). Te AUROC of the three readers for bile leak detection on CEMRC of 
diferent acquisition time points tabulated in Table 2 also increased signifcantly from 10minutes to 90minutes. 
Te AUROC acquired at 90minutes by three readers were 0.824, 0.914 and 0.929 respectively and the inter-rater 
reliability was very good with an ICC of 0.816. Although the ICC was higher (0.821 versus 0.816) for CEMRC 
acquired at 30minutes than that acquired at 90minutes, the AUROC for bile leak detection by the three readers 
on CEMRC acquired at 30minutes were not only small but also statistically nonsignifcant.
Comparisons of clinical parameters, specifc treatments for biliary injuries, biliary-related complications and length of hospital stay between groups. As summarized in Table 3, patients with bile 
leak were signifcantly associated with active liver hemorrhage on admission CT (p=0.007) and liver angioembolization (p=0.014) as the initial hemostasis treatment for liver trauma. Data of liver enzymes and bilirubin on 
arrival as well as length of hospital stay between the groups with and without bile leak did not difer (Table 4). 
However, the median bilirubin level on arrival were signifcantly higher (1.80 versus 0.95mg/dL, p=0.022) and

median length of hospital stay was signifcantly longer (23 versus 11 days, p=0.003) respectively in the group 
with type II bile leak than in the groups with type I bile leak.
Among 22 patients, 8 underwent catheter drainage, 14 were treated with observation. Te eight catheter drainage procedures included three endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage and fve percutaneous catheter drainage. Of

these 8 patients, seven (7/8, 87.5%) had bile leak. Te other one patient who underwent catheter drainage did not 
have bile leak and the aspirate yielded old blood. Of the 14 patients treated with observation, eight (8/14, 57.1%) 
had bile leak.
Te diference of treatment choice between groups with and without bile leak was not signifcant. However, as 
shown in Table 3, the diference of catheter drainage between type I and type II bile leak groups was statistically 
signifcant (p=0.041). One (1/7, 14.3%) patient with type I bile leak and six (6/8, 75.0%) patients with type II 
bile leak required catheter drainage (see Supplementary Fig. S1). One patient of type II bile leak who was treated 
with percutaneous and endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage developed severe biliary stricture (Fig. 3). Other 
patients recovered uneventfully afer bile leaks were resolved. None of the 7 patients of the group without bile 
leak developed jaundice, cholangitis, biliary tree stricture or progressive enlargement of intra-abdominal fuid 
(intrahepatic or intraperitoneal).

Discussion
With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging, the diagnostic performance of T2-weighted magnetic resonance 
cholangiography which capitalizes on the long T2-relaxation property of bile is comparable to that of endoscopic 
retrograde cholangiography for biliary cancer, biliary stone and biliary anomaly24. However, other fuid collections 
of the liver are difcult to be diferentiated from bile leak because all are hyperintense on T2-weighted images21.
On the contrary, by using gadoxetic acid disodium as the contrast agent, CEMRC can easily identify 
the T1-shortening bile leak. It has been reported that CEMRC acquired 20 minutes after administration of 
Gd-EOB-DTPA is sufcient for obtaining hepatobiliary phase images25–27 although the acquisition can range from 
20 to 180minutes25. Te best acquisition time of CEMRC using Gd-EOB-DTPA among trauma patients has never 
been investigated. Our main concern in this study is to optimize the acquisition time and expedite the examination 
for trauma patients. We found that CEMRC of 30-minute and 90-minutes acquisitions have higher scores of biliary 
tree visualization on a 5-point scale, as compared to CEMRC of 10-minute and 20-minute acquisitions. Furthermore, 
the reliability test of visualization scores among three radiologists was the best on CEMRC of 90-minute acquisition.
Our study showed that bile leak was also best detected on CEMRC acquired at 90-minute with the highest 
AUROC. Te diagnostic yield for bile leak is better when the biliary tree is more adequately flled up with excreted 
contrast medium. Similarly, depiction of bile leak was also the best reliable with a very good ICC on CEMRC 
acquired at 90-minutes among three radiologists.
Not only a high risk of biliary injuries can occur in patients with major liver trauma14,28, our results showed that 
bile leak was signifcantly associated with active liver hemorrhage on arrival CT. Te severe lacerations of major liver 
trauma not only injure the hepatic vessels, its shearing force can also disrupt bile ducts and portal veins at the portal 
triad. Active arterial bleeding or pseudoaneurysm is ofen treated by angioembolization1,29–31 for patients who are 
transiently responsive to fuid resuscitation. We have found that angioembolization is associated with bile leak. Tis 
is because angioembolization may compromise the vascular supply to the walls of bile ducts, causing a possibility of 
local epithelial ischemia and delayed healing at the site of biliary injuries, therefore resulting in delayed bile leak3,14,28.
Traumatic biliary injuries with type I bile leak can resolve spontaneously. In contrast, the type II bile leak 
is associated with a higher level of total serum bilirubin and catheter drainage. Even though one patient with 
expanding bile leak underwent endoscopic retrograde biliary stenting and percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
drainage, he still developed biliary stricture. Moreover, patients with type II bile leak usually have a longer length 
of hospital stay than those with type I bile leak.
Biliary injury is ofen underestimated because the diagnostic tools are too invasive for asymptomatic patients. 
We have proven that non-invasive CEMRC is feasible to detect and characterize bile leak in trauma patients. 
However, good quality CEMRC depends on liver excretion function of Gd-EOB-DTPA21,25 which is mediated by 
the same transporter system of bilirubin transport.

CT in axial plane shows active extravasation of contrast medium (arrow) at the liver parenchyma, treated 
initially with angioembolization (not shown). (b) Contrast enhanced MR cholangiography acquired at 
90minutes in axial plane shows a type II bile leak (arrows) expanding through the disrupted anterior liver 
capsule to perihepatic space. (c) Percutaneous cavitography through a pigtail catheter (arrow) shows a direct 
communication of the injected iodinated contrast medium (biloma) with the injured intrahepatic bile ducts 
(arrowheads). He was treated with both percutaneous catheter drainage and endoscopic retrograde biliary 
drainage and later developed intrahepatic bile duct stricture.

In this study, we only included patients with major blunt liver trauma who were co-operative and compliant 
with the MRI safety requirements. Te implanted cardiac devices or embedded metallic foreign bodies afer trauma 
can prohibit patients from undergoing CEMRC. Small sample size is therefore the main limitation of this study. Te 
second limitation is that we categorized patients into groups with and without bile leak by expert-panel consensus 
because verifcation by the ideal endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is too invasive for asymptomatic patients. 
Te third limitation is that we did not have patients with very high serum level of bilirubin. Te total bilirubin level 
of our patients ranged from 0.50 to 3.60mg/dL. We do not know whether CEMRC acquired at 90-minute is still 
optimal for bile leak detection if bilirubin level exceeds 3.60mg/dL. Te fourth limitation is that we did not acquire 
CEMRC at longer than 90minutes time points because MRI scheduling is always tight and we cannot aford to 
decrease MRI throughput per day. Fortunately, excretion of Gd-EOB-DTPA can be visualized on CEMRC acquired 
at 90-minutes in all patients in this study. We did not investigate whether or not CEMRC at 60minutes time point 
would have yielded a similar results as 90minutes. Tis has lef us an opportunity for clarifcation in the next study.
In conclusion, CEMRC is feasible to provide both anatomical and functional information for traumatic bile 
leaks among major liver trauma patients with a history of active liver bleeder treated by angioembolization. Bile 
leak is most optimally detected on CEMRC acquired at 90 minutes time point afer intravenous injection of 
Gd-EOB-DTPA. Blunt liver trauma patients with type II (expanding) bile leak are associated with higher level of 
total serum bilirubin, more likely to undergo catheter drainage and a longer length of hospital stay than patients 
with type I (contained) bile leak.
Methods
Subjects. Tis retrospective study on CEMRC for biliary injuries was approved by Chang Gung Memorial 
Hospital’s institution review board and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines (RE: 99–3856B). A written informed consent was obtained from every participant. From March 2012 to 
December 2014, a total of 25 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria (adults ≥20 years old, clear consciousness without intubation, compliant with the MRI safety requirements, recent major blunt liver trauma 
≥grade III injuries according to AAST scoring scheme, and status post stabilized by non-operative management). 
Among them (Fig. 4), one was excluded because of poor cooperation during scanning, two were excluded because 
of incomplete CEMRC examination. Finally, 22 patients with a median age of 24.5 years (IQR 21.8, 36.0 years) 
including 17 men with a median age of 24.0 years (IQR 21.5, 36.0 years) and 5 women with median age of 25.0 
years (IQR 21.5, 47.5 years) were included. A review of the trauma registry documented that their median injury 
severity score was 29 (IQR 17.0, 34.5). Tey constituted 12.4% of patients with ≥grade III blunt liver trauma.
Magnetic resonance imaging technique. Te CEMRC was performed on a median of 10.5 days (IQR 8.0, 
15.5 days) afer blunt liver trauma at the time when the patients had been evaluated by attending surgeons as stable to be transferred to MRI scanning room. All examinations were performed with a 3T MR system (Magnetom 
Trio; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Each patient received intravenous bolus injection of 25 μmol/kg of body 
weight of gadoxetic acid disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist, Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) at a 
fow rate of 2mL/sec, followed by 10mL saline fush. Images of CEMRC in axial plane were acquired at 10, 20, 30 
and 90minutes time points respectively using three dimensional gradient-echo (GRE) T1-weighted volume interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) technique. Coronal plane images of T1-weighted VIBE were acquired at 
30 and 90minutes. Besides CEMRC, axial images of T1-weighted VIBE at arterial phase, portal venous phase and 
equilibrium phase as well as axial T2-weighted images with and without fat saturation were also obtained. Te 
imaging techniques was summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Afer CEMRC of 30 minutes time point were 
obtained, patients were helped getting of the examination table. While they were at MRI observation room being 
re-checked of ftness for delayed scan, the technologists were scanning the next scheduled patient that usually 
took 40 minutes to complete. Subsequently, the technologists would help our patients getting on the MRI table 
again to acquire CEMRC of 90minutes time point.
Optimization of CEMRC scanning time. Te CEMRC of diferent acquisition times were separated into 
diferent sets of images. Each set of images was randomly given a record number without chronological order 
and transferred to a picture archiving and communication system for analysis. Tree radiologists (13, 13, 12 
years of experience in abdominal radiology respectively) who did not have access to the entire dataset were also 
blinded to the clinical course and fnal diagnosis. In a research meeting, these three radiologists were briefed on 
the properties of gadoxetic acid disodium, scoring scheme of biliary tree visualization and imaging features of 
bile leak on CEMRC.
They were asked to independently score biliary tree visualization as well as presence or absence of bile 
leak. Te scores of biliary tree visualization was recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1=very poor visualization 
defned as no opacifcation of bile duct, 2=poor visualization defned as opacifcation of common bile duct 
only, 3=fair visualization defned as opacifcation of common bile duct to confuence of right and lef main bile 
ducts, 4=good visualization defned as opacifcation of common bile duct to frst-order division of either right 
or lef intrahepatic bile ducts, 5=excellent visualization defned as opacifcation of common bile duct to at least 
second-order division of either right or lef intrahepatic bile ducts). Bile leak on CEMRC was defned as extravasation of liver-excreted contrast medium from bile duct. Te detection of bile leak was recorded independently on 
a fve-point Likert scale (1=very unlikely, 2=unlikely, 3=equivocal, 4=likely, 5=very likely).
Final decision and characterization of bile leak on CEMRC. Te fnal decision on whether bile leak 
was present or absent was determined by an expert-panel who had full knowledge of all CEMRC, available additional examinations, laboratory data and clinical information of the patients. Tis expert-panel comprised two

abdominal radiologists and one trauma surgeon who had more than 20 years of experience in trauma radiology. 
None of them was involved or had infuence over the scoring of biliary tree visualization and bile leak detection. 
All data were studied by this expert-panel group to reach a consensus of whether or not bile leak was present or 
absent. Characterization of the bile leak based on morphology of extravasated biliary contrast medium was further categorized by the expert-panel. Te bile leak was characterized as type I if it was confned, and characterized 
as type II if it was expanding in the presence of liver capsule disruption.
Records of clinical parameters, specifc treatments for biliary injuries, biliary-related complications and length of hospital stay. All patients were followed up for a median of 19.8 months (IQR 10.5, 
29.8 months).Teir admission CT reports were reviewed for AAST grading of liver trauma and active extravasation of vascular iodinated contrast medium. Teir admission notes were reviewed for serum liver enzymes and 
bilirubin levels on arrival as well as initial treatment for liver trauma (observation or angioembolization). Teir 
medical records were reviewed for the choice of specifc treatment for biliary injuries, biliary-related complications and the length of hospital stay.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were computed with a sofware package (IBM SPSS Statistics version 21). 
Intraclass Correlation Coefcient (ICC) of scores on biliary tree visualization and bile leak detection were computed to estimate interrater reliability. It was categorized as poor (ICC<0.5), fair (ICC of 0.5–0.7), good (ICC of 
0.7–0.8), very good (ICC of 0.8–0.9) or excellent (ICC of 0.9–1.0). Accuracy of bile leak detection was measured 
by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Diferences of data between the groups of (1) 
bile leak versus no bile leak, and (2) type I versus type II bile leak were compared. Categorical data were compared 
using Fisher’s exact test. Continuous data were compared with Mann-Whitney test. Te diferences were considered signifcant if the 2-tailed p-values were less than 0.050.
