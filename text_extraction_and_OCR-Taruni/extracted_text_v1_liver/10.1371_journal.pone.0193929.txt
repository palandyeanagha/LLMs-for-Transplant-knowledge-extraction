Abstract
Objective
To evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters T2 signal, contrast enhancement (CE), and relative liver enhancement (RLE) of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast
agent (GBCA)-enhanced MRI as a marker for hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in patients
with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
Methods
3.0-Tesla MRI scans and liver biopsies of 40 patients (41.2 ± 17.1 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Biopsies were obtained within a mean time of 54 ± 55 days to MRI scans
and specimens were categorized according to Ishak modified hepatic activity index (mHAI)
and Scheuer staging of fibrosis. T2 signal (N = 40), CE alterations (N = 29), and RLE (N =
29) were assessed by two raters. Mixed-effects regression models were applied to estimate
the association between histopathology and MRI parameters.
Results
No significant association was observed between T2 signal or CE alterations with stages of
fibrosis or mHAI grading. Regression models revealed significant positive associations of
portal venous phase RLE with mHAI grade  7 points [β = 25.5; 95% CI (2.53; 48.62); p =
0.04] and delayed phase RLE with stages of fibrosis [stage 2: β = 35.13; 95% CI (11.35;
58.87); p = 0.007; stage 3/4: β = 69.24; 95% CI (45.77; 92.75); p < 0.001]. The optimal cutoff value of 66.6% delayed phase RLE distinguished fibrosis stages 0–2 from 3–4 with a

sensitivity of 0.833 and specificity of 0.972. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) for quantification of
RLE was ‘excellent’ (r = 0.90–0.98). IRR was ‘substantial’ for detection of T2 signal in the
right liver lobe (RL) (Kappa = 0.77) and ‘almost perfect’ for T2 signal of the left liver lobe (LL)
and CE of both lobes (Kappa = 0.87–1.0).
Conclusion
The simple and reproducible method of RLE quantification on standard extracellular GBCAenhanced MRI may provide a correlate measure of advanced stages of hepatic fibrosis and
potentially also inflammation in PSC patients, if validated in larger cohorts.
Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a cholestatic liver disease characterized by chronic
inflammation, subsequent obliterative periductal destruction and fibrosis, culminating in secondary biliary cirrhosis and liver failure [1–3].
Quality of life and patient survival are reduced due to a markedly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal cancer [4, 5]. The incidence of PSC
varies geographically, where the reported incidence in the United States, Northern Europe,
and Canada ranges from 0.9 to 1.3 per 100,000, and is less than 0.1 per 100,000 in Southern
Europe and Asia [6, 7].
The diagnosis of PSC is usually based on biochemical, clinical, and cholangiographic findings using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP) [8–10]. Histopathological
examination is not standard procedure in current guidelines [9]. However, histopathological
scoring systems for inflammatory activity and fibrosis can provide useful information about disease activity and stage of liver fibrosis as well as the patient´s prognosis [11].
PSC is unique in its patchy distribution of liver parenchyma inflammation and confluent
fibrosis, increasing the risk of sampling error, as biopsy covers only a tiny fraction of the liver
(roughly 1/50,000th) [12]. Furthermore, its invasive nature carries risks such as hemorrhage
with a fatality rate of up to 0.03% [13]. Non-invasive tools to quantify fibrosis and liver inflammation are urgently needed to assess treatment response in clinical trials.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended as the diagnostic modality of choice
in PSC [14]. In recent years elaborate MRI sequences for diagnosis and staging of fibrosis,
such as MR elastography (MRE) have been investigated. MRE non-invasively quantifies the
stiffness of liver in later stages of fibrosis (2 vs. 3 vs. 4) but may be confounded by a variety of
factors, which can alter liver stiffness such as hepatic steatosis, cholestasis, and portal hypertension [15–17].
Conventional extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)-enhanced MRI and
MRCP are routinely performed in PSC patients for diagnosis and surveillance of malignancy
and dominant biliary strictures [18–20]. An additional imaging feature of GBCA-enhanced
MRI is the evaluation and quantification of inflammation and progressive fibrosis using either
hepatocyte-specific or extracellular GBCA [21, 22]. Abnormal perfusion patterns using extracellular GBCA have been observed in patients with hepatic inflammation in acute [23, 24] and
chronic liver diseases [25, 26] with distinct patterns of fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltrates,
necrosis, and micro- or macronodular cirrhosis. A multiphase extracellular GBCA-enhanced
MRI study performed by Martin et al. [27] in patients with hepatitis reported a high correlation of delayed phase contrast enhancement with histological staging of fibrosis (r = 0.96; 95%

confidence interval (CI) 0.941–0.976), but not between arterial/venous/delayed phase imaging
and histological grades of inflammation. In recent years dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)
MRI using the hepatocyte-specific contrast agent gadoxetic acid has been proposed to assess
hepatic function as a surrogate for hepatic fibrosis, by quantifying parameters like hepatocellular uptake rate, input relative blood flow, and mean transit time (MTT) using deconvolutional
analyses [28]. For example Nilsson et al. [28] described a significant lower global median
hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and global median MTT, and larger parenchymal volume
(p< 0.05) in patients with liver cirrhosis compared to healthy controls. Nore´n et al. [29]
reported significant intergroup differences in hepatic contrast uptake rate (K(hep)) between
mild (F0/1) and advanced (F3/4) histopathological stages of fibrosis (p = 0.05) in N = 38
patients with various liver diseases. However the routine clinical application of functional
DCE imaging is limited due to extensive and time-consuming post-processing, as well as to
several confounding factors such as cardiac status, hepatic congestion, and inflammation [30].
The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate the quantitative and qualitative
MRI parameters T2 signal, contrast enhancement (CE) and relative liver enhancement (RLE)
of extracellular GBCA-enhanced MRI as a marker for hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in
patients with PSC using liver histopathology as gold standard.
Methods
Subjects
The retrospective study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Hamburg Medical Association. 40 patients with known PSC according to EASL guidelines were assessed between January 2008 and January 2015. Written informed consent for general use of data and standard
MRI was acquired from each patient. Patients with previous liver surgery, a history of hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma, and a change of the therapeutic regimen for PSC
disease within the time interval of MRI scan and liver biopsy, were excluded. All patients
underwent liver biopsy of the right liver lobe (RL) and/or the left liver lobe (LL) within 6
months (mean ± standard deviation 54 ± 55 days, range 0–180 days) to the MRI scan.
Out of 40 patients, N = 29 patients received intravenous contrast agents. The administration of contrast agents was avoided in N = 8 patients due to renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml/min) and N = 1 patient due to relevant allergic reactions after previous
contrast administration. Two patients received a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent and were
excluded from contrast-based analysis (CE and RLE).
Liver biopsy and histopathological examination
Because of previous reports of higher sensitivity for detection of fibrosis and lower complication rate with mini-laparoscopic versus percutaneous performed liver biopsies [31], all samples
were acquired by mini-laparoscopy as previously described [32]. The location of biopsy was
documented in the laparoscopy report and retrospectively allocated according to liver segments defined by Strasberg et al. [33]. The histopathology was evaluated by two pathologists
with 5 years (SW) and 11 years (TK) experience in histopathological grading/staging of liver
biopsies separately for the RL and LL, using the Ishak modified hepatic activity index (mHAI)
and Scheuer fibrosis staging of chronic hepatitis [34]. The mHAI was chosen since there is no
grading system specific for PSC inflammatory activity. The mHAI grades four major characteristics (sum 18 points) of necroinflammatory tissue changes (A: periportal or periseptal
interface hepatitis; B: confluent necrosis; C: focal lytic necrosis, apoptosis and focal inflammation; D: portal inflammation). In autoimmune hepatitis, a cut-off value of mHAI points  3
represents significant liver inflammation [35], and was found to indicate immunosuppressive

treatment in patients with PSC in a previous retrospective multicenter study [36]. The staging
system developed by Scheuer et al. [37] was used for architectural staging of liver fibrosis and
cirrhosis. This classification system defines liver tissue without architectural changes (0 points)
to cirrhosis (4 points) [37].
MR imaging technique
MRI was performed on a 3.0-Tesla scanner (Ingenia, Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with an eight-channel body coil. Axial T2-weighted imaging was performed covering
the whole liver and subjects were asked to hold their breath at the same depth during each
acquisition. Baseline and contrast-enhanced dynamic images were acquired before and after
intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg (0.2 ml/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Magnevist
Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany) into the antecubital vein using a power injector
(Medrad, Spectris Solaris, EP Injection System, Bayer Healthcare, Berlin, Germany) at an infusion rate of 2 mL/s, followed immediately by a bolus of 20 mL saline (NaCl 0.9%) at the same
infusion rate. A fat saturated T1-weighted imaging of the whole liver in axial orientation was
performed before contrast injection and followed by repetitive sequences 10 seconds (arterial
phase), 90 seconds (portal venous phase) and 5 minutes (delayed phase) after injection. MRI
sequence details are specified in Table 1.
Image analysis
MRI data were analyzed and rated by two independent radiologists (SK and JY) with 4 and 10
years experience in abdominal MRI, respectively, blinded to patients’ history, histology, and
laboratory findings. Images with binary results between both raters were assessed by a third
rater (AM) with 6 years experience in abdominal imaging.
According to the liver segment used for laparoscopically performed biopsy, axial and coronal T2-weighted images and contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted images were analyzed
regarding the visual aspect of T2 signal alterations (T2 hyperintensity = 1; absence of significant T2 hyperintensity = 0) and increased contrast enhancement (CE) (increased CE = 1;
absence of significant CE = 0) of the portal venous and delayed phase imaging (Fig 1).
To avoid sampling errors, three regions of interest (ROI), with a mean size of 1.8 cm2 (± 0.7
cm2 standard deviation) were drawn on adjacent slices of the non-enhanced T1-weighted axial
imaging of the biopsied liver lobe. Each ROI was then copied exactly to the portal venous and
delayed phase axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image. The signal intensity (SI) of the copied ROIs was assessed to derive three replicate values, which were then averaged for further
assessment (Fig 2).
Mean SI obtained from the ROIs of the T1-weighted non-enhanced (baseline) and contrast-enhanced (portal venous and delayed phase) images were used to calculate the RLE using
the following algorithm, adapted for extracellular GBCA and published previously by Nolz

Relevant demographic and clinical data, as well as serum liver function tests of disease activity
(alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine-amino-transferase (ALT), aspartate-amino-transferase

perfect. For binary results of T2 signal and CE rating, the results of an independent third rater
were used.
For continuous variables (RLE portal venous and delayed) Pearson correlation coefficients
(r) and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the IRR of the two observers. The criteria of
Portney and Watkins [41] were used to judge the strength of the correlation coefficients, as follows: little to no relationship (r  0.25), fair degree of relationship (r = 0.26 to 0.50), moderateto-good relationship (r = 0.51 to 0.75), and good-to-excellent relationship (r  0.76).
The dependencies in the data for measurements in the RL and LL were quantified descriptively for mHAI and fibrosis stage. Due to these dependencies we used mixed-effects logistic
and linear regression models with a random intercept by patient to derive effect estimates and
95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between CE, T2, RLE portal venous and RLE
delayed as dependent variables, and mHAI and fibrosis as independent variables. For sensitivity analyses we also performed these analyses also with laboratory parameters as independent
variables, and derived an optimal cut-off value with highest sensitivity and specificity for the
distinction between fibrosis stages 0/1 to 2 and 3 to 4 based on RLE delayed.
For all analyses, the statistical software R [42] was used, Cohen‘s Kappa was based on the
implementation in the irr [43] package, mixed-effects models on the lme4 [44] and the lmerTest package [45], optimal cut-off plots and derivation on ROCR [46], and pROC [47] packages.

Patient cohort and laboratory results
Out of 40 patients included in this study, N = 29 patients received a contrast-enhanced MRI
scan. Their data were analyzed both for signal increase on T2-weighted images, CE alterations
and RLE. The remaining N = 11 non-contrast-enhanced MRI scans were analyzed for signal
alterations only on T2-weighted imaging. Patient characteristics, histopathological and MRI
parameters are included in Table 2.

Liver histology
Histopathological results were available from all patients and obtained either from the RL
(N = 8) or LL (N = 6) or both liver lobes (N = 26). In total, 66 biopsies were analyzed (RL: 34;
LL: 32) (Table 2).
According to histopathological staging of liver fibrosis, 8/66 biopsies obtained from the LL
or RL were classified as liver cirrhosis (stage 4), 21/66 biopsies showed a significant to severe
stage of fibrosis (stage 2 or 3) and 37/66 no or minor fibrotic tissue alterations (stage 0 or 1)
(Table 2).
The highest mHAI of this patient cohort was 9 of 18 points and found in 1 biopsy. 28 biopsies (RL N = 15; LL N = 13) were classified having an elevated mHAI, based on the cut-off
value  3.
We found interdependencies in the data for measurements in the RL and LL for both fibrosis stage and mHAI, quantified with a Spearman correlation coefficient between LL and RL of
r = 0.70 for fibrosis and r = 0.71 for mHAI (Data are illustrated in S1 Table).
Relative liver enhancement in portal venous and delayed phase images
The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of RLE in the portal venous phase was 69.1 ± 25.3% (RL)
and 62.7 ± 24.8% (LL), and 34.0 ± 36.8% (RL) and 33.1 ± 37.6% (LL) in the delayed phase
imaging, respectively (Table 2).

Association between relative liver enhancement and histological stages of
fibrosis
The associations between RLE of the portal venous and delayed phase imaging and fibrosis
stages are depicted in Fig 3. Using regression analysis, no significant associations of the portal
venous phase RLE and stages of fibrosis were observed (p  0.72) (Table 3).
However, there was a consistent positive association between the delayed phase RLE and
fibrosis stage. This association was also found significant based on regression analysis [fibrosis
stage 2: β = 35.13; 95%-CI (11.35; 58.87); p = 0.007); fibrosis stage 3/4: β = 69.24; 95% CI
(45.77; 92.75); p < 0.001)] (Table 3).

Sensitivity analyses
Based on the significant results for RLE delayed, we derived an optimal cut-off value of 66.6%,
with a sensitivity of 0.833 and a specificity of 0.972 for distinguishing between fibrosis grade
0–2 and fibrosis grade 3–4. A higher sensitivity of 0.917 can only be obtained by compromising specificity to 0.583 based on a cut-off of 26.43% for the RLE delayed (Fig 4). Overall, an
area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92 showed that the RLE delayed performed well in distinguishing between these fibrosis stage groups.
Relative liver enhancement and histopathological grade of inflammation
Fig 5 depicts the RLE for activity of inflammation assessed by mHAI grade < 3,  3 and  6,
and  7 points. Linear regression revealed a significant association of the portal venous phase
RLE with mHAI grade  7 points [β = 25.5; 95% CI (2.53; 48.62); p = 0.04]. No association
was observed for portal venous phase RLE with mHAI grade  6 (p  0.74) or mHAI and
delayed phase RLE (p  0.45) (Table 3). Due to the small sample size with mHAI grade  7

The quantification of RLE showed excellent inter-rater agreement both in the RL and LL.
The inter-rater agreement of the portal venous phase was (Pearson correlation coefficient,
95% confidence interval): RL [r = 0.96 (0.10–0.98)], LL [r = 0.90 (0.77–0.96)]. The IRR for
quantification of the RLE in the delayed phase was: RL [r = 0.98 (0.96–0.99)]; LL [r = 0.96
(0.90–0.98)], respectively. A Bland-Altman plot of both observers showed a bias of -2.05 [95%

limits of agreement (-20.94 to 16.84)] and a bias of -1.79 [95% limits of agreement (-20.04 to
16.47)] for the portal venous and delayed RLE, respectively (Fig 6). For delayed phase RLE, the
Bland-Altman plot depicts a wider distribution of data points in RLE measurements over 60%,
while for lower RLE data points are closer to each other.
T2 signal and CE alterations
Visual aspects of T2 hyperintense signal alterations on areas corresponding to the area of liver
biopsy were found in 33 (RL: 19; LL: 14) of 66 histopathologically analyzed areas. A visible
increase of contrast enhancement in delayed phase imaging was detected in 26 (RL: 14; LL: 12)
of 66 areas (Table 2). In total, 7 out of 114 measurements were binary rated by the two operators and independently analyzed by the third reviewer. Binary ratings were predominantly
found for T2 signal of the RL (N = 4) and LL (N = 2). Only one binary rating resulted in assessment of CE alterations (RL = 1; LL = 0). Images with binary ratings were reviewed by a third
rater and decided positive in all cases. The IRR for detection of T2 hyperintense areas within

the biopsy location was ‘substantial’ for the RL [Kappa = 0.77; 95% CI (0.548–0.981)] and
‘almost perfect’ for the LL [Kappa = 0.87; 95% CI (0.699–1.0)]. The IRR for detection of CE
was ‘almost perfect’ for the RL [Kappa = 0.92; 95% CI (0.766–1.0)] and the LL [Kappa = 1.0;
95% CI (1.0–1.0)].
Association of imaging parameters (CE, T2 signal) with histological
inflammation and fibrosis
Using mixed-effects models to assess the association of visual aspects of T2 signal and CE,
there was no statistically significant relationship between these imaging parameters and histopathological stages of fibrosis or mHAI grades (p  0.1 for all analyses). Details are listed in
Table 3.
Association of imaging parameters (CE, T2 signal, and RLE) and
laboratory results
No association of laboratory parameters (Bilirubin, ALT, AST, γGT, AP, and IgG) and imaging
parameters (T2, CE, and RLE) was found (S2 Table).
Discussion
In PSC it is becoming increasingly recognized that non-invasive markers of liver inflammation
and fibrosis are urgently needed for the assessment of disease progression and treatment
response, particularly with respect to upcoming clinical trials [11]. This is the first study to
analyze the association between T2 signal intensity, gadolinium-based contrast-enhanced multiphase MRI, and the histological severity of liver parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis in
patients with PSC.
We propose that the relative liver enhancement in the delayed phase might serve as a valid
marker for liver fibrosis in PSC and that it is superior to the visual assessment of T2 signal
intensity and CE. According to the data in the present study a strong positive association
between histological staging of fibrosis and delayed phase RLE can be observed, but not with
portal venous phase RLE. This association is not observed for visual assessment of T2 signal
intensity and CE. Peripheral wedge-shaped areas of T2 hyperintensity are frequently found in
T2-weighted MRI of PSC livers. Until today no consensus exists whether inflammation or
fibrosis contributes more to this finding. One study conducted on PSC patients found correlations of T2 signal intensity with histopathological signs of inflammation of hilar bile ducts,
which causes obstruction of the venous and lymphatic drainage on biopsy examination [1].
However, the authors of this study also admitted that increased T2 signal is also observed in
areas of confluent fibrosis or cirrhosis. The fact that T2 signal seems to be influenced by fibrosis and also by inflammation could be one more reason that findings obtained in this study
lack a statistically significant association with stages of fibrosis or the modified hepatitis activity score.
A major strength of our study is the use of an extracellular gadolinium-based contrast
agent. Correlations of a hepatocyte-specific (gadoxetic acid) contrast enhancement and liver
fibrosis have been reported previously and describe a negative correlation of contrast enhancement and fibrosis stage (r = -0.79, p < 0.001) [48], (r = -0.545, p < 0.0001) [49]. However, the
administration of a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent might additionally be useful in the setting of hepatocellular malignancy detection and evaluation of the biliary tree using T1 MRC
[38], but at the disadvantage of increased material costs and acquisition times compared to
conventional extracellular GBCA-enhanced MRI. These disadvantages of additional cost and

time also apply for MRE, which has been shown to be able to distinguish between different
stages of fibrosis and has therefore been proposed for evaluation of prognosis in patients with
PSC [50].
In contrast to liver fibrosis, a weaker but significant association of portal venous RLE and
mHAI grades  7 points was observed in this study cohort, whereas no associations of delayed
RLE and mHAI grades were evident. The weak correlation of portal venous RLE and inflammation could possibly be influenced by hemodynamic changes of chronic liver disease (e.g.
hepatic fibrosis or cholestasis in PSC patients) superimposed on the effects of portal venous
phase MRI characteristics.
Our findings of delayed phase RLE are in line with the results of a previous multiphase
GBCA-enhanced MRI study of patients with chronic and active hepatitis by Martin et al. [27].
In this study, arterial and delayed phase images were scored by three readers using feature categorization templates to quantify enhancement patterns. They found a high correlation of
delayed phase liver enhancement scores with histopathological Scheuer stages of fibrosis
(r = 0.96), but no association with histopathological Scheuer grades of inflammation
(r = 0.071). However, enhancement patterns of the portal venous phase were not included in
this study, and data obtained by the three readers were averaged despite only ‘fair’ agreement
(Kappa 0.35 to 0.386). We believe, that the quantification of enhancement via RLE is more reliable than the quantification method applied by Martin et al. [27] with regard to IRR, which
was considered ‘almost perfect’ on correlation analysis of this study. Visual quantification of
T2 signal and CE reached slightly less favorable results.
To our knowledge, an association of extracellular GBCA portal venous phase enhancement
and mHAI grades of liver inflammation have not yet been described. However, a recent study
by Chen et al. [51] of N = 58 cases with chronic hepatitis found a significant association of
gadoxetic acid DCE-MRI derived parameters arterial fraction (p = 0.033) and area under the
curve (p = 0.047) with mHAI grades on liver histology [51]. Another study by Puustinen et al.
[52] reported the feasibility of phosphorus-31 (
31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy for
detection of inflammation in N = 12 autoimmune hepatitis patients. A significant positive
correlation of phosphoenolpyruvate was observed with METAVIR grades of inflammation
(r = 0.746; p = 0.005).
Recent studies published on PSC patients have mainly focused on liver function and not
fibrosis. These studies evaluated T1 mapping and DCE-MRI. The reported T1 relaxation time
decrease correlated with serum liver functional tests (AP, γGT, AST, ALT) as well as with the
clinical scores Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and PSC Mayo Risk Score [53]. Several other studies assessed the efficacy of different gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI-based liver
function indices in correlation with the indocyanine green (ICG) clearance (r = -0.354 to
0.574; p< 0.001) [54]. Another group evaluated the total and segmental liver function and
volume by means of hepatocyte-specific DCE-MRI in a small cohort of N = 12 PSC patients.
Authors reported significant correlations between biliary obstruction and segmental liver
functional parameters (HEF Spearman´s rho -0.24; p < 0.05) and input relative blood flow
(irBF Spearman´s rho -0.45; p < 0.05) [21].
Limitations of this study include the small number of PSC patients, especially those with
histological Scheuer fibrosis staging of 3 or 4, and its single center set-up. In particular, the
weakly significant correlation of portal venous RLE and higher mHAI scoring points must
be interpreted with care, as this result was obtained with relatively small observations
(mHAI  7; RL N = 5; LL N = 3). Before determining cut-off values for diagnostic purposes,
larger follow-up multi center studies are needed to validate our preliminary observations.
Additionally, liver biopsies were obtained up to 6 months before or after MRI scans, which
could make exact relocation of the biopsy side difficult even with documentation in the

laparoscopically performed procedure. An MRI-guided percutaneous biopsy or an even more
precise upcoming technique of real-time MRI/Ultrasound (US) fusion-guided biopsy, which
has already found application in prostate cancer would be of interest for future studies [55–
57]. Lastly, two pathologists assessed liver histology by consensus, making it impossible to consider the effect of the IRR.
Conclusion
The results of our study indicate the potential usefulness of extracellular GBCA enhancement,
quantified by means of the RLE, for the staging of hepatic fibrosis and the identification of
higher grades of hepatic inflammation in patients with PSC. Its easy application and use of
existing equipment means this technique could be an interesting addition to the current imaging armamentarium of non-invasive fibrosis measurements and evaluation of disease activity,
if validated in larger cohorts.

2.0–33 ed2016. p. Different kinds of tests for linear mixed effects models as implemented in ‘lme4’ package are provided. The tests comprise types I—III F tests for fixed effects, LR tests for random effects.
The package also provides the calculation of population means for fixed factors with confidence intervals and corresponding plots. Finally the backward elimination of non-significant effects is
implemented.
