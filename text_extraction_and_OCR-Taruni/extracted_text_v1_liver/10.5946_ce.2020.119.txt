INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation (LT) is a treatment method performed 
not only for acute liver failure but also for almost all liver 
diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.1
Besides, while the number of LTs is increasing annually due 
to the improvement of post-transplant survival and quality of 
life, the imbalance of supply and demand between the donor 
and recipient has not yet been resolved. Recently, living-donor 
LT (LDLT) has been implemented as a solution to this shortcoming.2,3 However, the incidence of duct-to-duct anastomotic 
stricture (AS), one of the important complications occurring 
after LT, is known to be higher in LDLTs than in deceased-donor LTs (19%–40% vs. 15%–20%).4
Usually, endoscopic management has been the first-line 
therapy for AS. In particular, multiple plastic stents (MPS) 
placement through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was used. Recently, treatment using fully 
covered self-expandable metal stent (cSEMS) has been widely 
introduced. In this review, we explore AS treatment using 
SEMS. 
TYPES OF SEMS
Traditionally, the use of uncovered SEMS in benign biliary 
stricture has not been recommended due to the difficulties 
involved in their removal.5 Therefore, for treating AS following 
LT, cSEMS is commonly used to ease the removal of SEMS afterward. However, due to the increased risk of stent migration 
in cSEMS, attempts have been made to use partially covered 
SEMS (pcSEMS).6 Chaput et al. reported that when pcSEMS 
was used in 22 patients with AS after LT, two patients suffered 
from bleeding and fever after removal of the pcSEMS.6 In 
addition, even with pcSEMS, stent migration occurred in two 
patients. Thus, pcSEMS is not recommended in the prevention of stent migration.
REQUIRED NUMBERS OF ERCP

Anastomotic stricture (AS) is one of the complications of liver transplantation (LT) and can occur in up to 40% of living-donor LTs. 
Endoscopic management has become the first-line treatment of AS, and multiple plastic stents insertion has been mainly used in 
the past. Recently, many treatments utilizing fully covered self-expandable metal stents (cSEMSs) have been attempted, and results 
showing adequate treatment outcome have been reported. In this review, we look into the treatment performance and cautionary 
steps needed when using cSEMS as a treatment for AS. Clin Endosc 2020;53:261-265

causes are conditions such as post-operative edema, fibro-inflammatory response, and transient ischemia.7-10 This type of 
stricture has been successfully treated through MPS with one 
to two endoscopic dilatations.8 On the other hand, for AS occurring three months or more after LT, the plastic stent needs 
to be replaced by repeated ERCP, average of three to five times 
every eight to twelve weeks.11
However, since cSEMS has a larger diameter than plastic 
stents and a persistent radial force can be applied after just one 
ERCP, outcomes similar to that of MPS can be achieved even 
when one cSEMS was used. Therefore, cSEMS has the advantage of reducing the need for additional ERCP. Most studies 
demonstrated that patients using SEMS received an average 
of two ERCPs (one to place the SEMS and another to remove 
it).12 Fewer ERCPs are also directly related to reductions in 
treatment costs. Although cSEMS itself is more expensive than 
plastic stents, the total health care cost to treat AS is lower 
when using cSEMS than MPS due to lower numbers of ERCPs 
(in average, $8,288.50 vs. $18,580.00, p<0.001).13
NEED FOR STRICTURE DILATATION & 
cSEMS PLACEMENT
 Selective cannulation of the bile duct is generally performed 
in ERCP, and a guidewire should be passed to the proximal 
portion of AS (Fig. 1A). To increase the success rate of stricture 
resolution, strictures may be dilated before cSEMS placement 
using devices such as balloons, Soehendra dilatation catheters 
or Soehendra stent retrievers (Fig. 1B).14 However, controversy 
exists on whether performing dilatations in treatment methods involving MPS is appropriate.15 It should also be noted

that there is a risk of perforation or bile leak at the anastomosis 
site when dilatation is attempted unreasonably within three 
months of LT. 11 After stricture dilatation, delivery catheter of 
cSEMS can be passed easily through the AS and deployed optimally. (Fig. 1C). 
Several methods of bile duct anastomosis such as end-toend, end-to-side, side-to-side exist; so, the type and level of AS 
also vary. Adjacent intrahepatic bile duct can be occluded after 
cSEMS insertion if AS occurs close to the proximal portion 
of extrahepatic bile duct. Thus, plastic stent insertion may be 
needed into the undrained bile duct after cSEMS insertion 
(Fig. 2).
NEED FOR ENDOSCOPIC 
SPHINCTEROTOMY
Martins et al. reported that eight cases of post-ERCP pancreatitis occurred in 16 patients who had cSEMS inserted 
without sphincterotomy.4 However, only one of the 14 patients 
who underwent sphincterotomy had pancreatitis.4 Theoretically, sphincterotomy increases the risk of cSEMS migration 
because the sphincter of Oddi loses the force to hold the 
cSEMS in place. Although some reports offer support against 
sphincterotomy promoting stent migration,16 these have focused on malignant biliary obstructions. It is hence difficult

to apply these findings to benign strictures such as AS. In 
addition, it should be kept in mind that sphincterotomy causes irreversible functional loss of the sphincter of Oddi, thus 
promoting stent occlusion due to duodenobiliary reflux or 
bacterial colonization.14
DURATION OF cSEMS INDWELLING 
AFTER PLACEMENT
In benign biliary strictures, prolonged indwelling of cSEMS 
can improve stricture resolution rates.17 The same results will 
likely be observed in AS following LT. However, the longer 
the indwelling period, the greater the risk of migration, and 
the higher the risk of secondary bile duct injury. Placement of 
cSEMS for unnecessarily long periods should be avoided because occlusion of the intrahepatic bile duct may occur around 
cSEMS insertion, resulting in bile stasis.18
TREATMENT OUTCOMES (STRICTURE 
RESOLUTION & STRICTURE 
RECURRENCE)
In general, the resolution of the AS after cSEMS removal 
was checked using a cholangiogram (Fig. 1D). The success 
rate of AS resolution ranging from 53% to 100% was reported.4,7,19-23 In studies conducted before 2014, cSEMS dwelling 
usually lasted two to three months, whereas, in relatively 
recent studies, cSEMS lasted four to six months (Table 1). It 
is thought that the placement of cSEMS for longer periods 
helped achieve a higher resolution rate. According to a recent 
meta-analysis, there was no difference in the resolution rate of 
AS between use of cSEMS and MPS.13
Recurrence of stricture after cSEMS removal occurred in 
17%–32% of cases.4,7,19-23 There was no statistically significant 
difference in the recurrence rate between the cSEMS and MPS 
groups.13,24 In addition, Martins et al. reported that in eight patients with recurrence, AS was resolved in six patients after 1 
year of MPS dwelling.4 However, due to the small study group, 
it is difficult to consider this as the standard salvage management for AS. Further studies on this are therefore needed.
MIGRATION OF cSEMS
One of the most common complications of cSEMS treatment is stent migration. Although Kaffes et al. have reported 
the absence of migration with cSEMS,7 only 10 patients were 
involved in that study. With that result, it is hard to define 
cSEMS as the standard treatment for AS. Interestingly, migration does not mean treatment failure. Tal et al. reported 
that while migration occurred in 8 patients, 4 achieved AS 
resolution before the occurrence of migration.19 However, the 
migration of cSEMS may be associated with various adverse 
events and the requirement for additional procedures for stent 
repositioning or removal. Therefore, cSEMS migration is a 
problem that must be overcome.
CONCLUSIONS
So far, we have reviewed the usefulness of cSEMS as a 
treatment for AS that occurs after LDLT. The medical cost 
is lower when using cSEMS because the requirement for repeated ERCP procedures is less than that in MPS. Besides, the 
efficacy of cSEMS in terms of resolution and recurrence rates 
is similar to that of MPS. However, the decision should be

carefully determined whether to perform stricture dilatation 
and sphincterotomy before cSEMS placement. The duration 
of cSEMS in position after placement has also not yet been determined. In addition, cSEMS migration is another hurdle to 
overcome. Therefore, studies on various types of cSEMS and 
management protocols will be needed in the future.
