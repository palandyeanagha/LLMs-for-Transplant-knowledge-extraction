Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a demyelinating lysosomal storage disorder for which new treatments are urgently needed. We previously showed that transplantation of gene-corrected hematopoietic stem
progenitor cells (HSPCs)in presymptomatic myeloablated MLD mice prevented disease manifestations. Here
we show that HSC gene therapy can reverse neurological deficits and neuropathological damage in affected
mice, thus correcting an overt neurological disease. The efficacy of gene therapy was dependent on and proportionalto arylsulfatase A (ARSA) overexpression in the microglia progeny oftransplanted HSPCs. We demonstrate a widespread enzyme distribution from these cells through the CNS and a robust cross-correction
of neurons and glia in vivo. Conversely, a peripheral source of enzyme, established by transplanting ARSAoverexpressing hepatocytes from transgenic donors,failed to effectively deliver the enzyme to the CNS. These
results indicate that the recruitment of gene-modified, enzyme-overexpressing microglia makes the enzyme
bioavailable to the brain and makes therapeutic efficacy and disease correction attainable. Overall, our data
provide a strong rationale for implementing HSPC gene therapy in MLD patients.
Introduction
Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive 
lipidosis caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) and can be considered a lysosomal storage 
disorder (LSD) with predominant neurological involvement (1, 
2). The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of the ARSA 
substrate galactosylceramide I3-sulfate (sulfatide), a major sphingolipid of myelin. The disease is characterized by myelin degeneration in both the CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS), 
associated with the accumulation of sulfatide in glial cells and 
neurons. Despite the fact that the enzymatic deficiency is systemic, 
disease manifestations are restricted to the nervous system. Children affected by MLD display progressive neurologic symptoms, 
including ataxia, seizures, and quadriplegia, culminating in decerebration and eventual death early in infancy (1, 2).
As is true for other LSDs affecting the CNS, there is currently no 
effective treatment for MLD, and the benefits of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are still controversial 
(3, 4). Allogenic HSCT corrects the metabolic deficiency in hematopoietic lineages. Furthermore, some of the progeny of engrafted 
hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) migrate extravascularly and release some functional enzyme in the affected tissues (5). As cells can take up extracellular enzyme by the mannose 
6-phosphate (M6P) receptor and correct their defect in vitro (6, 7), 
it is thought that a similar process of cross-correction may occur in 
vivo. Several preclinical and clinical studies support the notion that 
enzymatic cross-correction of the liver and other visceral organs is 
substantial after HSCT or enzyme replacement therapy in LSDs 
(8). However, a similar bioavailability of functional enzyme in the 
CNS is more difficult to achieve. Consistent with this limitation, 
HSCT has generally had a poor outcome in neurodegenerative storage disorders. Recent clinical studies in globoid cell leukodystrophy 
report clinical benefits of transplanting BM (4) and umbilical cord 
blood (9) HSPCs if the procedure is performed soon after birth, at 
a presymptomatic stage. The same treatment was ineffectual when 
applied to symptomatic patients (9), suggesting either that recruitment of the HSPC progeny to the CNS is too slow to reverse the disease once it is established or that unique permissive conditions for 
CNS cross-correction are in place in the perinatal period. Besides 
its limited efficacy, allogenic HSCT is associated with substantial 
morbidity and mortality and may adversely affect disease outcome 
per se. Moreover, recent in vitro studies have raised the concern that 
macrophages and microglia, which are the HSPC progeny recruited 
to the CNS, may release lysosomal enzymes lacking the M6P recognition marker (10) and thus represent an inadequate source of 
enzyme for in vivo cross-correction. Regarding enzyme replacement 
therapy, studies conducted in murine models indicate that enzyme 
bioavailability is poor in the CNS when the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB) integrity is preserved, as is the case in MLD (11).

Thus, several biological and clinical factors severely limit the 
therapeutic potential of HSCT and enzyme replacement therapy 
for CNS storage disorders, and the development of new effective 
strategies is badly needed.
We and others have proved that HSCT combined with gene therapy (GT) may represent one such candidate strategy, as it combines 
advantages of an autologous HSPC source with the benefits of 
enzyme overexpression in transplanted cells (12–18). We recently 
demonstrated progressive and extensive reconstitution of well-differentiated microglia in the CNS by the transgene-expressing progeny of transplanted HSPCs in Arsa–/– mice (14). Taking advantage 
of lentiviral vectors (LVs) to achieve efficient gene transfer into

HSPCs and long-term overexpression of the ARSA gene in their 
cellular progeny, we prevented the development of major disease 
manifestations in mice treated at the presymptomatic stage (14). 
Interestingly, transplantation of WT cells did not achieve significant clinical benefit, suggesting a critical role of enzyme overexpression in the success of our strategy.
Unfortunately, in most cases, and unless a family history 
is available, the diagnosis of MLD is made after the onset of 
symptoms. Thus, in order for a clinical benefit to be achieved 
in patients with an established neurologic disease, a new therapeutic strategy should be devised (19). Here we report complete 
normalization of established behavioral abnormalities, motor 
conduction deficits, and neuropathological alterations of Arsa–/–
mice after HSPC GT. We demonstrate that microglia is the 
exclusive source of ARSA in the CNS and that enzyme transfer 
and robust cross-correction of neural cell targets occur in vivo. 
Thus, our results strongly support the use of HSPC GT in clinical trials for MLD patients.
Results
Correction of established neurological disease in GT-treated MLD mice. 
The mouse model of MLD, generated by targeted disruption of 
the murine ARSA gene Arsa, is characterized by slowly progressive 
CNS and PNS disease (20) and allows longitudinal evaluation of 
disease evolution. By 5–6 months of age, Arsa–/– mice already display motor coordination impairment, delayed motor conduction 
in the CNS and PNS, neuronal degeneration, and widespread storage of metachromatic material; further deterioration along these 
lines occurs with age (see below).
We transplanted HSPCs from Arsa–/– donors transduced with LV 
expressing either ARSA or GFP into a total of 106 lethally irradiated 6-month-old Arsa–/– recipients (61 with ARSA and 45 with 
GFP in 8 rounds of transplantation), according to a previously 
optimized protocol (14). To permit in situ immunodetection of 
ARSA, in all experiments, we used a C terminal–tagged transgene, 
in which the gene was fused in frame with the sequence encoding the HA peptide from the HA protein of the human influenza 
virus. The HA-tagged enzyme had a specific activity comparable 
to that of the unmodified enzyme and was properly sorted to the 
lysosomal compartment (21).
By measuring ARSA activity with the para-nitrocatechol sulfate (p-NC) assay in PBMCs of treated mice 6 months after transplantation, we demonstrated a complete reconstitution of enzymatic activity and ARSA overexpression with respect to WT levels 
(Figure 1A). Molecular analysis demonstrated efficient engraftment of transduced cells, with 80%–100% of BM CFCs positive 
in LV-specific PCR (not shown) and a mean of 6 ± 3 vector copies per cell (CpC), as assessed by quantitative PCR on total BM 
DNA (Figure 1A). These data indicate that enzyme overexpression 
in hematopoietic cells is associated with multiple vector integrations. We noticed that the average ARSA activity in circulating 
hematopoietic cells and average LV content in BM in mice in the 
first 4 transplantation groups were lower than those for animals 
in the last 4 transplantation groups. This difference could possibly 
be due to variations in the infectivity of the vector batch used or 
in the extent of myeloablation achieved. Based on this difference, 
we retrospectively divided all treated animals (pool) into 2 groups 
(A, with lower average ARSA activity, and B, with higher average 
ARSA activity) and investigated dose-effect relationships for all 
functional parameters analyzed (Figure 1A and Table 1).

By challenging tissue extracts with the natural ARSA substrate 
N-lissamine rhodaminyl–sulfatide (LRh-sulfatide), we observed 
enzyme overexpression in the liver of transplanted mice (Figure 1B). 
Supranormal ARSA activity likely reflected the extensive liver 
infiltration by Kupffer cells and macrophages derived from 
donor-transduced HSPCs, which overexpress the enzyme. Reconstitution of sulfatide metabolism was also detected in the brains 
of treated mice (Figure 1D) at levels corresponding to an average 
10% of WT activity in the pool of treated mice (Figure 1C). As 
expected, whereas ARSA reconstitution was observed in the tissues of all treated mice, its average level was significantly higher 
in group B versus group A (Table 1).
Functional studies were performed 6 months after the transplant and before sacrifice for all treated and control mice. Neurophysiological evaluations demonstrated complete correction of 
the previously established defective motor conduction upon GT. 
Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) showed correction to normal 
range of central conduction parameters (central conduction time 
[CCT], CCT normalized over F wave latency, and cortical MEP 
latency), indicating not only prevention of further deterioration 
that occurs with aging but also a reversal of the already established impairment (Figure 1E). Likewise, electroneurographic 
recordings demonstrated normalization of motor conduction 
velocity and F wave and spinal MEP latencies as compared with 6-
month-old untreated Arsa–/– animals (Table 2). Importantly, both 
group A and group B mice showed normalization of neurophysiological abnormalities.
A rotarod test showed protection of treated mice from further 
impairment of motor coordination and from the development 
of ataxia, which occurs with aging (P = 0.72, comparing the GT 
pool at 12 months with age-matched WT controls) (Figure 1F 
and Table 3). Remarkably, when considered separately, group B 
mice showed significantly improved latency on the rod also with 
respect to the 6-month-old untreated Arsa–/– controls (Figure 1F 
and Table 3), indicating near complete correction of the previously established behavioral deficit.
Histopathological analysis on the CNS and PNS was performed by toluidine blue staining on semithin sections of the 
brain, cerebellum, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and sciatic nerve, 
applying a double-blind scoring system for metachromatic 
deposit accumulation, neurodegeneration, and demyelination. 
At the time of transplantation, Arsa–/– mice already showed signs 
of neuronal damage and lipid storage in the CNS and PNS (see 
Figures 2 and 3 and Table 1). Small lipid storage deposits were 
found throughout the white matter, particularly in the fimbria 
and corpus callosum, and in the cerebellar white matter. Cells 
with pathological features were detectable in the pyramidal cell 
layer of the cornu Ammonis, areas 2–3 (CA2–3) regions of the 
hippocampal cortex and in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum. In the PNS, small metachromatic deposits were detectable in Schwann cell (SC) cytoplasm and in sensory neurons of 
DRG. By 12 months, the neuronal damage in the CNS and PNS 
was more severe, and the number and size of metachromatic 
deposits increased significantly. Furthermore, demyelination 
of nerve fibers in the PNS became progressively more evident, 
as confirmed by electron microscopy (EM) studies. Remarkably, 
in GT–treated mice, we observed a marked reduction of all of 
the neuropathological features described above (Figure 2). In 
the hippocampus CA2–3 and in the Purkinje cell layer of the 
cerebellum, the total number of neurons was higher and the 
fraction of neurons showing signs of degeneration (percentage 
over the total number of neurons) was reduced as compared 
with age-matched mock-treated Arsa–/– mice (Figure 2). Interestingly, when group B mice were considered separately, the

analysis was consistent with a rescue of Purkinje cells from the 
damage already observed in 6-month-old, untreated Arsa–/– controls (Figure 2G). Consistent with the neurophysiological studies, we observed complete protection from demyelination and 
marked reduction of metachromatic granuli accumulation in 
the sciatic nerve (Figure 3D) and clearance of neuronal damage 
and storage in DRG within sensory neurons, satellite cells, and 
SCs in treated mice (Figure 3G). Comparison of the mice in the 
2 treatment groups showed a better outcome of the procedure 
in group B, again highlighting the critical role played by enzyme 
overexpression in correcting already established disease.
Mechanism of disease correction by HSPC GT: occurrence of in vivo 
cross-correction. Subsequently, we wanted to unravel the mechanism responsible for reconstitution of sulfatide catabolism in the 
brains of transplanted mice and the widespread correction of CNS 
pathology. The most relevant issue was to demonstrate whether

active enzyme was secreted by gene-corrected microglia and distributed throughout the brain of treated mice. We performed 
immunofluorescence studies on brain sections to detect the presence of the tagged ARSA and localize it at the cellular and subcellular levels. Confocal analysis showed widespread occurrence 
of tagged enzyme within both F4/80- and isolectin B4–positive 
microglia cells (Figure 4A) derived from donor transduced HSPCs 
(14, 22) and resident, neuron-specific nuclear protein–positive 
(NeuN-positive) neurons in diverse areas of the CNS (Figure 4, C 
and E). The HA-tagged enzyme was particular abundant in the cerebellum, where up to 80%–90% of calbindin-D28k–positive Purkinje cells were positive for HA staining (Figure 4E). In both microglia 
and neurons, the enzyme appeared to be sorted at least in part 
to the lysosomal compartment, as shown by colocalization of HA 
and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) signals 
(Figure 4, D and F). We and others, using intracellular marker genes 
such as GFP, have previously shown that transplanted HSPCs 
contribute almost exclusively to the microglia population of the 
CNS, with up to 25% of the resident microglia made by transgeneexpressing cells 6 months after the transplantation, and that no 
exogenous marker gene expression can be detected in neurons 
following transplantation of transduced HSPCs (14, 22). Therefore, the present finding of HA-tagged ARSA enzyme (ARSA-HA) 
in neurons provides formal evidence for the occurrence of in vivo 
enzyme transfer. Moreover, confocal analysis allowed us to detect 
the presence of ARSA-HA within a large fraction of glial fibrillar 
acidic protein–positive (GFAP-positive) astrocytes (Figure 4G) and 
in rare myelin basic protein–positive (MBP-positive), CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes (Figure 4, H and I), suggesting that these 
other cell types could also be actively cross-corrected by enzymeproducing microglia. Interestingly, we found abundant ARSA-HA 
in adult neural stem cell–containing areas, such as the hippocampus and subventricular zone (Figure 5, A–C). Even though we could 
not detect proliferation in these areas in 12-month-old treated 
mice, as documented by negative Ki67 staining (not shown), it is 
possible that cross-correction of neural progenitors occurred and 
contributed to the observed therapeutic benefit of GT. We also 
found widespread ARSA-HA distribution in different cell types in 
the PNS, including neurons in the DRG, and S100-positive SCs in 
the sciatic nerve of treated Arsa–/– mice, proving the occurrence of 
enzyme transfer and cross-correction also at this critical disease 
site (Figure 5, D and E).
ARSA bioavailability in the CNS is exclusively dependent on recruited 
microglia. To investigate whether microglia cells were the effective 
source of enzyme in the CNS of treated mice or whether the wide 
distribution of ARSA was dependent on its transport from the 
plasma across the BBB, we generated mice bearing a stable source 
of ARSA-HA in the liver. We used as a liver transplant model the 
fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase–deficient (FAH-deficient) mouse 
(23). FAH–/– mice die from liver failure in the neonatal period if 
not fed a specific diet (tyrosine free) or unless they receive pharmacological therapy [2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-
1,3-cyclohexanedione (NTBC), blocking tyrosine degradation]. 
Grompe and coworkers have shown that transplantation of WT 
hepatocytes effectively repopulates the mouse liver, demonstrating their strong competitive growth advantage and allowing longterm survival of the mice and complete rescue of the lethal phenotype (24). We generated transgenic mice for ARSA-HA, using 
the same LVs used for transplantation studies, and established 
a line of mice showing ARSA overexpression. These mice were 
viable, fertile, and without evident signs of pathology, even in 
the presence of high levels of ARSA expression in all tissues (data 
not shown). We used these mice as donors of ARSA-overexpressing, FAH+/+ hepatocytes to be transplanted into FAH–/– mice. To 
avoid immune rejection, we used as recipients FAH/RAG1 doublemutant mice, which lack mature B and T lymphocytes (25). Three 
months after transplantation and periodic discontinuation of 
NTBC treatment to allow donor hepatocyte engraftment, histopathology on liver sections demonstrated massive reconstitution 
of the FAH–/– liver by FAH+ ARSA-HA–transgenic hepatocytes

(Figure 6, A–D). Quantitative PCR for LVs performed on liver 
DNA confirmed high engraftment of transgenic hepatocytes (Figure 6C). Importantly, we found significant levels of ARSA-HA–
specific activity in liver protein extracts and in the serum of transplanted mice, as demonstrated by an immunocapture p-NC assay 
selectively detecting the activity of the tagged enzyme (see Methods for details) (Figure 6E). These results indicated that we had 
successfully established an endogenous source of tagged enzyme, 
which was constantly released into the circulation up to 3 months 
after the transplantation. We then analyzed brain, DRG, and other 
organs for enzyme distribution by Western blot analysis or confocal immunofluorescence for the HA tag. As expected, HA signal 
was detected in the liver of both HSPC-transplanted mice and 
chimeric ARSA-HA/FAH mice (Figure 6B and data not shown). 
Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis demonstrated the occurrence of the tagged enzyme in the kidneys of both 
HSPC-transplanted mice and liver chimeras, indicating enzyme 
biodistribution to visceral organs both from hematopoietic and 
hepatic cell sources (Figure 6, F and G). Similarly, ARSA-HA 
signal was observed in sections of DRG of both HSPC-transplanted and hepatocyte-transplanted mice (Figure 6H), likely 
indicating enzyme uptake from the bloodstream in the PNS. On 
the contrary, whereas positive HA signal was clearly detected in 
confocal images and Western blots of GT-treated mice (Figure 6, 
I and J), both analyses failed to detect HA signal in the brain of 
ARSA-HA/FAH chimeras (Figure 6, I and J).
These data indicate that the BBB is an effective obstacle to ARSA 
biodistribution in the brain and that the enzyme detected in the 
CNS of HSPC-transplanted mice must originate from HSPC-derived 
microglia. Moreover, they demonstrate that transplanting genetically engineered HSPCs represents an effective strategy for establishing 
a source of a bioavailable gene product within the CNS.

Discussion
Our previous work has demonstrated the potential of genetically 
modified HSPCs to target the nervous system and prevent functional and neuropathological manifestations of MLD in the mouse 
model when treatment begins at a presymptomatic stage. These 
encouraging results, however, left several issues unresolved.
With respect to the efficacy of GT, we now provide evidence that 
an HSPC-based approach can correct already established neurologic 
disease manifestations and neuronal damage when applied to symptomatic MLD mice. This is relevant because (a) the mild disease phenotype observed in the MLD mouse model, as compared with the 
human disease, may cause us to overestimate the therapeutic impact

on liver sections (C) and by ARSA-HA activity of liver samples, expressed as fold increase compared with FAH+/– levels (D). LV content in the 
liver is expressed in CpC (right y axes in C and D). (E) ARSA-HA activity was detected in the serum of GT and chimeric mice, indicating that the 
tagged enzyme was secreted into the bloodstream. (F–J) Confocal immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of kidney (F and G), DRG 
(H), and brain (I and J) from representative mice. For Western blots, anti-HA hybridization is shown in the upper panels, anti-GAPDH in the lower 
panels, and MW markers on the right (in kDa). ARSA-HA signal was detected in the kidney and DRG of transgenic, GT, and chimeric mice. In 
contrast, the signal was detected only in the brain of transgenic and GT mice, not of chimeric mice, indicating that ARSA-HA could not reach the 
brain from the bloodstream. Scale bar: 20 μm.

of the proposed strategy if its effect is limited to the most responsive condition; (b) human patients are likely to be diagnosed when 
already symptomatic; (c) clinical experience in LSDs with neurological involvement indicates that HSCT can at best delay disease onset 
and progression if administered at a presymptomatic stage and that 
symptomatic treatment is ineffective (9, 26).
Because the degree of efficacy of GT on symptomatic mice was 
dependent on the level of reconstituted ARSA activity in hematopoietic cells and in target organs, we determined that the major 
advantage of GT is the possibility of expressing functional enzyme 
well above the normal donor’s levels. Regarding the mechanisms 
of disease correction, we prove that gene-corrected, overexpressing 
microglia cells are the exclusive source of bioavailable enzyme in 
the brain; they widely distribute ARSA and cross-correct affected 
neurons and glia. The detection of ARSA in the PNS of treated mice 
together with the correction of functional and histopathological 
abnormalities underlines the relevance of this approach in targeting not only the CNS, but also the widely distributed PNS network, 
the involvement of which is critical to a patient’s prognosis.
Correction of established neurological deficits. Neurophysiological and 
behavioral tests demonstrated the occurrence of CNS and PNS 
dysfunctions already in 6-month-old Arsa–/– mice. The conduction 
deficits in the PNS and CNS might reflect a sporadic demyelination, affecting multiple fibers along their course, thus delaying 
overall conduction, and/or a progressive degeneration of SCs and 
neurons due to intracellular sulfatide accumulation. Furthermore, 
Arsa–/– mice display abnormal motor coordination and ataxia (14, 
20), which may be due to the early and extensive degeneration of 
Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, the massive degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the CA2–3 of the hippocampus, and PNS disease.
These neurophysiological and behavioral deficits were normalized in treated mice along with the major histopathological abnormalities. Sulfatide clearance in SCs and neurons, together with 
prevention of demyelination and/or stimulation of remyelination 
in the PNS, might account for the complete reversal of motor conduction defects and, at least in part, for the improved performance 
at rotarod of the treated mice. More challenging is explaining the 
mechanism of recovery of complex functions, such as motor coordination, that involve multiple brain areas. In the cerebellum, 
Purkinje cells were rescued from degeneration, possibly as a consequence of intracellular ARSA reconstitution by cross-correction 
and progressive sulfatide clearance. Intracellular detoxification 
might interrupt a degenerative cascade and reconstitute functional, normal-appearing Purkinje cells. It was recently reported that, 
despite the lack of evidence for adult neurogenesis in the cerebellum, neural stem or progenitor cells may reside in the postnatal 
cerebellum (27). Recruitment of these progenitors, which possess 
intrinsic regional character, in a detoxified cerebellum after GT 
might provide a possible explanation for the recovery in number 
and phenotype of Purkinje cells that we have documented here. 
Similar considerations apply to the rescue of pyramidal neurons in 
the hippocampal cortex. The presence of the tagged ARSA enzyme 
in adult neural stem cell areas further supports this hypothesis. 
Additional studies are required to establish the actual mechanisms 
of the unexpected neuronal rescue observed in treated mice.
In vivo evidence of ARSA biodistribution in the brain and cross-correction. We provide here a long-sought-after proof of active enzyme 
release from HSPC-derived microglia and the enzyme’s transfer to 
other neural and nonneural cells in the brain. These results are 
even more compelling in view of previous in vitro studies that 
suggested the inability of macrophages and microglia to secrete 
uptake-competent M6P-containing ARSA (10). Because we did not 
investigate the presence of M6P residues on ARSA-HA, we cannot 
rule out whether a mechanism other than M6P-mediated uptake 
could mediate enzyme transfer to neurons and other glial cells. 
Whatever the mechanism of enzyme transfer may be, microglia 
represents an efficient enzyme source for neurons and glia in the 
brains of affected mice. Moreover, the associated correction of 
neuronal damage and, most importantly, of disease manifestations, demonstrates that in vivo enzyme transfer achieved robust 
metabolic cross-correction of the crucial CNS cell targets of the 
disease. Because the phenotype of the Arsa–/– mouse is mild and 
not characterized by extensive demyelination, which is typical of 
the human disease, the contribution of enzyme transfer to the 
functional rescue of oligodendrocytes is more difficult to assess. 
However, the lack of signs of demyelination and the finding of 
ARSA-positive SCs in the PNS of treated animals indicates a likely 
therapeutic benefit provided to myelin-forming cells.
Interestingly, our data show that microglia represents not only 
an effective but also a unique source of enzyme for the CNS, even 
in the presence of a peripheral depot. ARSA-HA/FAH chimeras 
sustain secretion of enzymes in the bloodstream by the repopulated liver. However, the absence of detectable tagged ARSA in the 
brain indicates inefficient enzyme uptake across the BBB. Enzyme 
detection in the PNS, on the contrary, suggests that the bloodnerve barrier may be more permeable. These data, while validating 
our GT strategy for enzyme targeting to the CNS, challenge the 
potential efficacy of protein-based enzyme replacement strategies 
(11) to deliver ARSA beyond the BBB.It should be noted, however, 
that BBB status could be affected by disease conditions, such as 
multiple sclerosis, or perturbed by drug treatments or irradiation, 
which may temporarily allow macromolecules like ARSA to reach 
the brain from the circulation. However, neither in MLD patients 
nor in Arsa–/– mice has BBB leakiness been reported to date.
Safety concerns on LV gene transfer and enzyme overexpression in 
HSPCs. The dose-effect relationship described herein underlines 
the key role played by enzyme overexpression in hematopoietic 
cells and microglia, suggesting a requirement for high engraftment of transduced cells and supranormal levels of enzymes in 
these cells to achieve significant therapeutic effects on the nervous 
system. Extensive engraftment of transduced cells can be achieved 
by coupling a myeloablative conditioning regimen with an efficient transduction of HSPCs. Efficient HSPC transduction and 
enzyme overexpression raise safety concerns with respect to both 
vector integration load and the efficiency of enzyme activation.
In the context of the LVs developed for this application, high 
transgene expression relies on multiple vector integrations into 
HSPCs, a condition that increases the risk of integration-dependent genotoxicity. After the report of adverse events occurring 
in some GT-treated X-linked SCID patients (28), the risk of 
retroviral vector (RV) mutagenesis and leukemogenesis must 
be carefully evaluated. Both RVs and LVs have been shown to 
feature a bias for integration within expressed genes, thus making transcriptional interaction between the vector and flanking 
endogenous genes more likely (28). The advanced self-inactivating design and the moderately active internal promoter of the 
LVs used in our studies provide safety features that should limit 
such interference. In addition, several differences in lentiviral 
and oncoretroviral biology and pathogenesis suggest that the 
risk of insertional mutagenesis may be significantly lower for

LVs than for RVs (29, 30). We have been performing long-term 
follow-up studies of all transplanted mice in this study and, 
using FACS analysis and necroscopy, we never detected hematopoietic abnormalities suggestive of clonal outgrowth or underlying hematologic malignancy.
Regarding the biochemical consequences of ARSA overexpression, the identification of sulfatase-modifying factor 1 (SUMF1) 
as a common activator of sulfatases and a rate-limiting factor in 
the biological activation of these enzymes raises concerns about 
possible adverse effects of enzyme overexpression within certain 
cell types (31). In fact, overexpression of one type of sulfatase may 
lead to its inefficient activation and even to reduced activity of 
the other sulfatases by competition for their common activator. 
To date, we have accumulated substantial in vitro and in vivo evidence, including the study of the transgenic mice overexpressing 
ARSA described here, that indicates efficient enzyme activation 
even at supranormal expression levels, without detectable signs of 
cellular or organ toxicity, thus strongly alleviating these concerns 
(A. Biffi and M.P. Cosma et al., unpublished observations).
In conclusion, the therapeutic benefits observed in affected 
mice together with a detailed understanding of the mechanism of 
disease correction shown here strongly support clinical testing of 
HSPC GT in MLD patients.
Methods
Mouse studies. Arsa–/– MLD mice were bred in the H.S. Raffaele animal 
research facility by intercrossing the homozygous offspring of 2 carrier 
mice obtained by rederivation (embryo transfer) of Arsa–/– males with 
C57BL/6 females. Thus, the MLD mice used in this study have a mixed 
C57BL6/129 genetic background. WT C57BL6/129 hybrid mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and used as the most appropriate 
controls for functional studies. ARSA-HA–transgenic mice were generated as described below and bred in our animal facility. FAH–/–RAG1–/– mice 
were transplanted and housed in a dedicated facility in the Department 
of Comparative Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA. All procedures were approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Oregon Health and Science University and by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fondazione 
San Raffaele del Monte Tabor (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 255) and were communicated to the Ministry of Health and local 
authorities according to Italian law.
Neurophysiological evaluation. Mice were anesthetized with trichloroethanol, 0.02 ml/g of body weight, and placed under a heating lamp to avoid 
hypothermia. Neurophysiological studies were performed as described (14, 
32). An unpaired Student’s t test (2-tailed distribution, 2 samples with equal 
variance, α = 0.05) was performed for statistical evaluation of the data.
Rotarod. Motor learning tasks were performed with an accelerating 
rotarod apparatus (Ugo Basile). This rotarod equipment includes a rotating cylinder, 3.2 cm in diameter, covered with textured rubber. Each section is 6.0-cm wide, allowing 5 mice to be tested simultaneously, 1 per 
section. Mice walk forward on the rotating cylinder at speeds increasing 
from 4 to 40 rpm over a 5-minute test session. Latencies in falling off the 
cylinder were measured once per day for 3 days, with 3 trials per session. 
Statistical analyses were performed by 2-way ANOVA for repeated measurements using Scheffe’s procedure as a post hoc after significant main 
effect of the treatment.
Histopathology and EM. Semithin and ultrathin morphological analyses 
were performed as described (14). Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally 
with avertin and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brain, 
cerebellum, DRG, and sciatic nerve were removed, postfixed in 0.12 M 
phosphate buffer/2% glutaraldehyde, sectioned into 2-mm blocks, postfixed with osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epoxy resin (EPON; MillerStephenson Chemical Company). Semithin (1-μm-thick) sections were 
stained with toluidine blue. For EM, ultrathin sections were stained with 
uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For morphometric analysis, microscopic 
images were taken with a digital camera and processed by Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. Counts were performed in double blind by 2 investigators on slides with a number-code system, and results were analyzed. 
Metachromatic deposits were counted in the hippocampal fimbria and 
cerebellar white matter; neuronal damage was evaluated in the CA2–3 of 
the hippocampal cortex and in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum; 
demyelination was quantified on the sciatic nerve. Metachromatic deposits 
larger than 20 μm were counted at ×20 magnification; demyelinated fibers 
were observed at ×100 magnification and by EM. Pyramidal cell bodies 
in the hippocampal cortex (diameter > 20 μm) were counted between the 
maximal convexity of the CA3 and the transition to CA2. The normal cerebellum contains a single layer of Purkinje cells that runs throughout the 
cerebellum in parallel with the cortical convolutions. Purkinje cell counts 
were obtained for each of 10 successive parasagittal sections per mouse, 
using corresponding sections across mice. To be counted, a cell had to be 
located in the Purkinje cell layer (diameter > 20 μm). Cells with shrunken 
cytoplasm and irregular, darkly stained nuclei were scored as pathological. 
For each experimental sample, 3–6 noncontiguous sections were analyzed 
for Arsa–/– mice (n = 6 at 6 months and n = 6 at 12 months) and GT mice 
(n = 10), and 60–200 cells were scored per section. The average percentage 
of damaged neurons for each sample was considered for each experimental 
group for statistical analysis (Student’s t test, 2-tail distribution, 2 samples 
with equal variance, α = 0.05).
LV production and titration. Vesicular stomatitis virus–pseudotyped LV 
stocks were produced by transient cotransfection of the transfer constructs 
pCCLsin.cPPT.hPGK.eGFP.Wpre or pCCLsin.cPPT.hPGK.ARSA-HA.Wpre, 
the third-generation packaging constructs pMD2.Lg/p and pRSV.Rev, and 
the pMD2.G envelope construct in 293T cells followed by ultracentrifugation of conditioned medium, as described (14). Stocks were titered by endpoint expression titer in HeLa cells and quantified for particle content by 
HIV-1 Gag p24 immunocapture assay.
Transduction of hematopoietic progenitors and HSCT. Six-week-old male Arsa–/–
mice were sacrificed with CO2, and BM was harvested by flushing the 
femurs and the tibias. Hematopoietic progenitors were purified using the 
Stem Sep Separation Kit (StemCell Technologies Inc.). For transduction, 
1 × 106 cells/ml were exposed to PGK-GFP LVs (1 × 108 HeLa transducing units/ml) or PGK-ARSA-HA LVs (1–3 μg p24 equivalent/ml) in StemSpan Serum-Free Expansion Medium (StemCell Technologies Inc.) in the 
absence of serum and with cytokines (100 ng/ml murine SCF, 100 ng/ml 
human FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand [hFlt3L], 100 ng/ml mouse IL-3, 
200 ng/ml human IL-6) for 12 hours. Vector- or mock-transduced cells 
(106 cells/mouse) were injected via the tail vein into 6-month-old lethally 
irradiated (12 Gy in 2 administrations) Arsa–/– female mice.
ARSA assays. Cell pellets were lysed in 0.5 M sodium acetate, pH 5, at 
4°C for 2 hours. For liver and brain samples, the tissues were homogenized in water (250 μl/100 mg of tissue), then sonicated, and centrifuged, 
and the supernatant was collected for ARSA activity and protein quantification. ARSA activity was detected using LRh-(12-aminododecanoyl) 
cerebroside 3-sulfate as substrate (LRh-CS), as described (14). ARSA 
activity on peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also evaluated by 
p-NC assay, as described (14).
PCR analyses. Clonogenic assays were performed by plating 1 × 104 BM 
cells in a methylcellulose-based medium (MethoCult M3434; StemCell 
Technologies Inc.). After 10 days, colonies were plucked and lysed for PCR 
analysis for the detection of LV sequences.

Genomic DNA was extracted (with an equal volume of 100 mM KCl, 
10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 2.5 mM 
MgCl2, 1% Tween-20, 1% NP-40, and proteinase K at a final concentration 
of 50 μg/ml) from plucked hematopoietic colonies and was subjected to 
PCR analysis for the PSI sequence of the LV backbone. GAPDH amplification was used to assess DNA integrity. Primers for the LV amplification 
were as follows: forward, 5′-TGAAAGCGAAAGGGAAACCA-3′, and reverse, 
5′-CCGTGCGCGCTTCAG-3′. PCR product length was 64 bp. Primers for 
GAPDH amplification were as follows: forward, 5′-CGCACTTTCTTGTGCAGTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTTCAGCTCTCTGGGATGAC-3′. PCR product length was 450 bp.
Vector copies per genome were quantified by TaqMan analysis starting 
from 200 ng of template DNA extracted from 1 × 106 total BM cell pellets, 
80 mg of liver tissue, or 100 mg of brain tissue (Blood and Cell Culture 
DNA Midi Kit; QIAGEN). Quantitative PCR was performed by amplifying the same PSI sequence and using the same primers of the described 
qualitative PCR at a final concentration of 750 nmol for forward and 
200 nmol for reverse primers. The probe was 5′-VIC-AGCTCTCTCGACGCAGGACTCGGC-MGB-3′ at a 200 nmol final concentration. As internal reference for normalization, we amplified a fragment of the murine 
β-actin gene using the following set of primers and probe: forward primer, 
5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′ at 300 nmol final concentration, 
reverse primer, 5′-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3′ at 750 nmol final 
concentration; the probe was 5′-VIC-CACTGCCGCATCCTCTTCCTCCCMGB-3′ at 200 nmol final concentration. A standard curve of genomic 
DNA carrying 5 LV copies, validated by Southern blot analysis, was constructed using DNA extracted from transgenic mouse tissue. The standard curve, based on different dilutions of DNA (from 250 to 50 ng), and 
accordingly, of LV copies, was used as standard both for LVs and for β-actin 
amplification. Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl, in 
an ABI Prism 7700 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). 
The number of LV CpC was calculated as follows: (ng LVs/ng endogenous 
DNA) × (number of LV integrations in the standard curve).
Immunofluorescence analysis. Mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia 
by intracardiac perfusion with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% PFA in PBS, pH 
7.4. Organs were fixed for 10–12 hours in PFA, equilibrated for 48 hours 
in PBS containing 15% sucrose, and then embedded in OCT compound 
for quick freezing in liquid nitrogen. From 10- to 40-μm cryostatic sections were processed for immunofluorescent staining. Sections were 
blocked with 5% goat serum (Vector Laboratories) diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). Primary antibodies were 
diluted in PBS-T with 2% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.2% Triton X-100 as 
follows: IgG2aκ isotype control, clone A110-2, 1:200; F4/80 (MCAP497; 
Serotec), clone CI:A3-1, purified, 1:500; lectin from Bandeiraea simplicifolia
(Griffonia simplicifolia) – FITCH (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:100; anti-HA highaffinity, rat monoclonal antibody (clone 3; Roche Diagnostics), 1:100; 
NeuN (MAB377; Chemicon International), 1:100; GFAP (MCA1909; 
Serotec), clone DP46.109, 1:100; MBP (MCA408; Serotec), 1:100; rabbit 
anti–calbindin-D28k (Swant), 1:100; mouse anti-Lamp1 monoclonal 
antibody (VAM-EN001; Stressgen Biotechnologies), 1:100. After incubation for 1 hour at room temperature or 12 hours at 4°C, sections were 
washed in PBS-T and stained for 1 hour with secondary antibodies (Alexa 
Fluor; Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in PBS-T, 1% BSA. Slides were mounted 
with Mount-Quick Aqueous (Electron Microscopy Sciences). HA-stained 
sections from the brain of mice transplanted with GFP-transduced or 
untransduced HSPCs were used as negative controls. Confocal microscopy was performed using 3 laser confocal microscopes (Radiance 2100; 
Bio-Rad; Zeiss and Leica TCS SP2; Leica Microsystems). Fluorescent signals from single optical sections were sequentially acquired and analyzed 
by Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software.
ARSA-HA–transgenic mice generation. ARSA-HA–transgenic mice were 
generated using LV-ARSA-HA as described (33). Pups were genotyped for 
the presence of the Wpre sequence by PCR. Positive mice were bred to test 
germline transmission of the transgene and to generate lines of animals 
expressing ARSA activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tissues at high (>5-fold basal levels) or medium levels (2- to 5-fold to basal 
levels). DNA was extracted from the tail and used to quantify vector copy 
number by quantitative PCR.
Hepatocytes transplantation into FAH–/– recipients. FAH-RAG1 doublemutant mice were generated by crossing 129S4 FAH mutant and a C57BL6 
RAG1 mutant and subsequently used as transgenic hepatocyte recipients. 
All mutant mice received NTBC in their drinking water at a concentration 
of 16 mg/l (estimated dose of 2 mg/kg body weight) until transplantation. 
Hepatocytes were isolated from 2 ARSA-HA–transgenic donors with ARSA 
activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells quantified as 5- to 8-fold 
greater than basal levels. The isolation and transplantation were performed as previously described (24, 34). Briefly, parenchymal hepatocytes 
were isolated by a 2-step collagenase perfusion and resuspended in 100 μl 
of DMEM, then 5 × 105 viable hepatocytes were injected intrasplenically. 
NTBC was gradually discontinued during the week after transplantation, and the weight of the transplanted animals was measured twice a 
week. The drug was briefly reintroduced when body weight reached 80% 
or less of the initial weight, but no more was administered after day 90, 
independently of body weight. Three months after the transplantation, 
following peripheral blood sampling for collection of serum, chimeric 
mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia by intracardiac perfusion with 
0.9% NaCl for 15 minutes to avoid interference with further analysis of 
ARSA-HA present in the peripheral blood. Liver, kidney, DRG, and brain 
were collected and processed as follows: (a) homogenized in 0.5 M Na 
acetate, pH 5, containing protease inhibitors and 1% SDS, for Western 
blot analysis; (b) fixed in 4% PFA and frozen for immunofluorescent staining; (c) stored for later DNA extraction; (d) homogenized in Na acetate for 
ARSA-HA–specific activity determination; and (e) fixed in formalin for 
FAH immunohistochemistry.
Western blot analysis. Tissues were homogenized and electrophoresed 
in NuPAGE polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) (Invitrogen). The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with anti-HA antibody or with mouse 
monoclonal antibody anti-GAPDH, incubated with chemiluminescent 
substrate, and then analyzed.
FAH immunohistochemistry. Liver tissue fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered 
formalin was dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in paraffin wax at 
58°C. Four-micron sections were rehydrated and stained with a polyclonal 
rabbit antibody to rat FAH (kindly provided by Robert Tanguay, University of Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada). The antibody was diluted in 
PBS and applied at a concentration of 1:300,000 at 37°C for 30 minutes. 
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2 and methanol. 
Avidin and biotin pretreatment was used to prevent endogenous staining. 
The secondary antibody was a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG used at a 
dilution of 1:250 (BA-1000; Vector Laboratories). Color development was 
performed with the AEC detection kit (Ventana Medical Systems Inc.).
ARSA-HA–specific activity detection. A p-NC assay was adapted for ARSAHA–specific activity detection. Elisa plates were coated with an anti-HA 
antibody at a concentration of 1:50 in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.9, and incubated overnight at 4°C. After blocking with 10% rat serum in PBS, 100 μl 
of serum or tissue extracts were plated into coated wells and incubated 
at room temperature for 2 hours. After incubation, wells were washed 3 
times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, and 100 μl p-NC was then added. After 
90 minutes of incubation at 37°C, p-NC was collected, the reaction was 
stopped by adding 1 ml/1 M NaOH to each 100 μl collected p-NC, and the 
final product was read at spectrophotometer (515 nm wavelength).

Statistics. Statistical analysis of the data obtained from ARSA activity 
measurement, CpC quantification, neurophysiological tests, and quantitative evaluation of neuronal damage and metachromatic deposits was 
performed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test (2 samples with equal 
variance, α = 0.05). Statistical analysis of the data obtained with rotarod 
test was performed using 2-way ANOVA for repeated measurements. After 
evidence of significant effect of the treatment, we applied Scheffe’s procedure for post-hoc evaluation.
