Fibrosis is an intrinsic response to chronic injury, maintaining organ integrity when extensive necrosis or apoptosis 
occurs. With protracted damage, fibrosis can progress toward excessive scarring and organ failure, as in liver cirrhosis. To date, antifibrotic treatment of fibrosis represents an unconquered area for drug development, with enormous potential but also high risks. Preclinical research has yielded numerous targets for antifibrotic agents, some of 
which have entered early-phase clinical studies, but progress has been hampered due to the relative lack of sensitive 
and specific biomarkers to measure fibrosis progression or reversal. Here we focus on antifibrotic approaches for 
liver that address specific cell types and functional units that orchestrate fibrotic wound healing responses and have 
a sound preclinical database or antifibrotic activity in early clinical trials. We also touch upon relevant clinical study 
endpoints, optimal study design, and developments in fibrosis imaging and biomarkers.
The clinical problem
Fibrosis is the excess accumulation of ECM, which results from 
chronic, nonresolving inflammation. This inflammation triggers a 
wound-healing process that mitigates inflammatory tissue destruction but also leads to scar tissue formation. In the liver, fibrosis 
is mainly due to chronic viral hepatitis B or C, autoimmune and 
biliary diseases, alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and, increasingly, 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (1–5). While mild fibrosis 
remains largely asymptomatic, its progression toward cirrhosis, 
i.e., replacement of functional parenchyma by scar tissue accompanied by severe architectural and vascular distortion, is the major 
cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Clinical sequelae of 
cirrhosis are (a) liver synthetic (functional) failure, including failing 
hemostatic, nitrogen handling, and detoxification systems; (b) portal hypertension with consequent formation of ascites and bleeding 
esophageal or gastric varices; (c) a high susceptibility to infection; 
and (d) a high risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (2). 
Preventive measures, such as antiviral regimens for hepatitis B or C, 
are already decreasing the burden of viral cirrhosis and HCC, but 
other causes, such as NASH (which is linked to obesity and type 2 
diabetes) are taking center stage. Moreover, numerous patients 
present initially in the clinic with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, 
which are largely irreversible. Therefore, antifibrotics that prevent 
progression toward cirrhosis or induce regression of advanced 
fibrosis and cirrhosis are urgently needed (6–9).
Liver fibrosis progression and reversal
Research has delineated key mechanisms and cells that determine 
fibrosis progression (fibrogenesis) and regression (fibrolysis) 
(1–19). Notably, liver fibrosis has much in common with fibrosis 
of other organs, such as lungs and kidneys, leading to a crossfertilization of research across organ boundaries. The structural 
components of the fibrotic ECM, the growth factors, cytokines, 
chemokines, and proteases, as well as central signaling cascades 
implicated in fibrogenesis and fibrolysis, are nearly identical in 
these different tissues (18, 20–22). Importantly, fibrosis is no longer considered static, but the result of a continuous remodeling 
process. Nonetheless, in contrast to kidneys and lungs, the liver has 
an extraordinary capacity to regenerate, even in advanced fibrosis.
Fibrosis is intimately linked to wound healing, serving to prevent tissues from disassembly during inflammation, apoptosis, 
necrosis, and release of lytic enzymes. Fibrosis usually reverses 
within days to a few weeks following the resolution of tissue damage, as demonstrated in less advanced rodent and human liver 
fibrosis (2, 8, 9, 23–25). However, the longer the damage persists, 
often at a low level, the more ECM is deposited. This chronic damage results in increasingly acellular scar tissue and a steep decline 
of potential reversibility, even after elimination of causative triggers (26, 27). Inefficient fibrolysis is due to several factors: (a) 
lack of cues for ordered cell repopulation and regeneration due 
to an atypical ECM and the loss of appropriate cellular context, 
(b) advanced vascular remodeling with architectural distortion, 
(c) extensive crosslinking of ECM components such as fibrillar 
collagen that make proteolytic removal difficult, and (d) the disappearance of cellular elements that digest the scar tissue. Here 
we discuss the cellular and molecular pathways that promote 
fibrosis progression and highlight current clinical trials as well as 
improved methods of monitoring fibrosis.
Cellular targets and multicellular fibrogenic units
Activated myofibroblasts, representing a spectrum of similar 
ECM-producing cells that mainly derive from hepatic stellate 
cells and portal fibroblasts, are the major producers of the fibrotic 
ECM and the most downstream cellular effectors of liver fibrosis 
(Figure 1). Very few hepatic myofibroblasts in fibrosis stem from 
BM-derived fibrocytes (12). Moreover, complete epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelia 
to myofibroblasts may be a rare event — while an “incomplete” 
EMT of these cells with acquisition of a fibrogenic phenotype is 
common (28). Myofibroblasts and their products are primary targets for antifibrotic therapies, which in principle would address all 
types of fibrosis, including advanced fibrosis.
Importantly, additional cellular elements that are either 
upstream of the myofibroblasts or tightly linked to fibrogenic 
activation within cellular units may provide a basis for complementary and more disease-specific antifibrotic approaches. A 
combination therapy approach may be more effective, given that 
crosstalk between different cell types generally underlies fibrogenic activation. Conceptually, three major multicellular functional units can be defined according to their constituent cell 
types: (a) perisinusoidal/vascular — pericytes, i.e., hepatic stellate

cells, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), macrophages/
Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes; (b) stromal inflammatory — 
myofibroblasts, T cells, and macrophages; and (c) portal/periportal — cholangiocytes/ductular cells, portal fibroblasts, and 
various inflammatory cells (ref. 8 and Figure 2, A–C). Altered 
interactions within these functional units give rise to the major 
multicellular fibrogenic pathways.
Fibrogenic effectors
Activated myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts that derive from both activated hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts are the primary 
producers of scar tissue (1, 2, 6–22, 29). Notably, myofibroblasts 
are essential for organ integrity, and their elimination promotes 
tissue necrosis and inflammation (30). Moreover, myofibroblasts 
can also contribute to fibrosis regression via release of ECMFigure 1
Myofibroblasts and their fibrogenic activation. Cells and major factors upstream of quiescent portal fibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells that 
induce transformation to fibrogenic myofibroblasts. This schematic highlights several major targets to treat liver fibrosis. Notably, the ECM itself 
can serve as modulator of fibrogenesis and fibrolysis. Thus collagen fibrils become crosslinked by LOXL2, which contributes to the reduced 
reversibility of advanced fibrosis, and collagen-binding ECM receptors (especially the integrins α1β1, α2β1, and α11β1) confer signals of stress 
or stress relaxation that either maintain fibrogenic activation or induce fibrolytic activity of the myofibroblasts. Additional minor contributors to 
fibrogenic activation are not shown here (see text for details). A2AR, adenosine 2A receptor; AT1R, angiotensin 1 receptor; CBR1, cannabinoid

degrading proteases, when confronted with favorable (e.g., ECMderived and integrin receptor–mediated) stimuli, in a process 
called stress relaxation. Stress relaxation is the basis for limiting 
ECM deposition once the wound is closed: the activated myofibroblasts contract on the accumulated loose collagen matrix, 
which triggers release of ECM-degrading proteases, mainly MMPs 
(31, 32). Consequently, treatment strategies should not eliminate 
myofibroblasts, but rather dampen their fibrogenic activation, 
confer signals of stress relaxation, and induce fibrolytic enzymes. 
Accordingly, two rodent studies demonstrated that approximately 50% of activated hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts undergo 
apoptosis during fibrosis reversal, whereas the rest revert to a quiescent phenotype (33, 34). Quiescence can be induced by inhibition of certain fibroblast integrins, cellular receptors that confer 
mechanical cues in response to ECM attachment (20) with the 
potential of converting activated to fibrolytic (myo-)fibroblasts 
(refs. 31, 32, 35, 36 and Figure 1). Specific integrin inhibitors have 
been developed for cancer therapy, but need better validation for 
treatment of fibrosis (37, 38). Myofibroblast stress relaxation and 
resultant amelioration of both fibrogenesis and portal hypertension has been shown in rats by inhibition of Rho kinase, which is 
downstream of integrin signaling (39).
Several agents that block fibrogenic activation and ECM production by myofibroblasts work well in culture and in some rodent 
models of liver fibrosis but carry a high risk of unwanted side 
effects in patients due to a lack of specificity for myofibroblasts. 
Three major strategies are currently in preclinical development to 
specifically target the pathogenic function of activated myofibroblasts. First, therapies may address fibrosis-relevant pathways that 
are upregulated in these myofibroblasts, such as procollagen type I

or other key structural components of the ECM, or block cellular 
receptors for ECM components and growth factors/chemokines 
that are upregulated upon fibrogenic activation. Current blockers 
of collagen synthesis have unwanted off-target effects, but inhibition of upstream fibrogenic signaling, e.g., PDGFRβ, a strong 
myofibroblast mitogen, with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib or a more specific PDGFRβ-blocking antibody retarded early 
but not advanced liver fibrogenesis (40, 41).
A second approach to targeting activated myofibroblasts is to 
employ refined siRNA delivery techniques, such as liposomal formulations that intrinsically accumulate in liver due to their size, 
shape, and surface charge, and that deliver cargo to myofibroblasts 
as well as other liver cell types (42, 43). For example, biliary and 
parenchymal liver fibrosis was significantly mitigated in mice 
treated with liposomes loaded with procollagen α1(I) siRNA (44). 
Finally, the use of ligands specific to receptors on activated myofibroblasts can target drugs or siRNA, thus increasing efficacy and 
minimizing detrimental off-target effects. Examples supporting 
this approach in vivo include delivery of IFN via a cyclic PDGFRβbinding peptide, of a PDGFRβ-specific kinase inhibitor via mannose-6-phosphate (which addresses the IGF-II receptor), and of 
Hsp47 (which is involved in collagen processing) via vitamin A–
coupled liposomes (45–48). Although these therapies would largely 
need to be given parenterally, such application can be justified in 
situations in which treatment is likely to be highly effective, e.g., 
for reversing advanced fibrosis. Moreover, modifications of delivery systems such as pegylation (49) can be used to increase halflives, permitting once-weekly or once-monthly dosing.
Damaged hepatocytes. Ongoing hepatocyte apoptosis or necroptosis, as occurs predominantly in liver diseases characterized 
by enhanced oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, lysosomal activation, and mitochondrial damage (ASH, NASH), is a 
strong trigger of fibrogenesis (16, 50). Phagocytosis of apoptotic 
hepatocytes by myofibroblasts triggers their fibrogenic activation 
via NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) (51) and the JAK/STAT and PI3K/
Akt pathways (52). Notably, inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis by 
a pan-caspase inhibitor or an antagonist of cathepsin B (a lysosomal trigger of apoptosis) ameliorated (biliary) fibrosis in mice 
Figure 3
Activated cholangiocytes as drivers of fibrosis progression. Activated cholangiocytes are related, if not identical, to biliary progenitor cells. 
These cells proliferate in active biliary diseases and during massive hepatocyte growth arrest or apoptosis, as in severe NASH, ASH, or viral 
hepatitis. Biliary progenitor cells are regularly found in more advanced fibrosis (especially Metavir stage F2 or higher). They replicate ductal 
plate formation by induction of a portal fibrotic matrix via secretion of profibrogenic factors and recruitment and activation of myofibroblasts, and 
also Kupffer cells and monocytes and other inflammatory cells like T and NKT cells. The recruited myofibroblasts (and the inflammatory cells) 
secrete factors and ECM components that maintain these fibrogenic units and support their differentiation into more mature biliary structures 
that are embedded in a collagen-rich ECM.

(53, 54). On the other hand, as mentioned below, engulfment of 
apoptotic hepatocytes and biliary cells by macrophages can induce 
their fibrolytic activation.
Biliary progenitors. The hallmark of biliary fibrosis is the proliferation of biliary progenitor cells (activated cholangiocytes) that tend 
to form small clusters or usually nonfunctional bile ductular structures, termed ductular reaction. These cells replicate early developmental programs of ductal plate formation, which includes 
secretion of several factors that attract and activate hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts to proliferate and deposit ECM. This 
biliary progenitor response is amplified by the surrounding myofibroblasts, but also by inflammatory cells that release molecules 
that sustain ductular cell viability and proliferation (Figure 3). 
With the exception of infant fibrosis (biliary atresia, Caroli’s disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis) and adult primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and secondary 
biliary fibrosis, all liver diseases of other etiologies, once advanced, 
develop into a portal fibrosis with proliferation of biliary progenitors, especially when excessive hepatocyte apoptosis forces the 
stem cell niche to produce biliary progenitors. These biliary progenitors are more resistant to enhanced oxidative stress and hepatocyte death, such as induced by ASH, NASH, or severe post-transplant hepatitis C (55–60). Drugs aimed at the biliary fibrogenic 
progenitors are effective antifibrotic agents in rodent biliary and 
advanced non-biliary fibrosis. Examples are antagonists to the biliary progenitor-specific integrin αvβ6 (a receptor for fibronectin 
and tenascin-C, and an activator of latent TGF-β1) (61–63) or inhibition of the hedgehog pathway, which is primarily upregulated 
in biliary fibrogenesis and in carcinogenesis (56–59, 64, 65). Notably, inhibition of hedgehog signaling suppressed biliary fibrosis 
and even reversed hepatocellular cancer in phospholipid flippase 
(Mdr2) knockout mice (65).
LSECs. Hepatic (neo-)vascularization with LSEC activation and 
proliferation is tightly associated with perisinusoidal fibrosis (capillarization of the sinusoids) (Figure 1 and Figure 2A). During perisinusoidal fibrosis, activated LSECs contribute to ECM production 
(including basement membrane components, fibronectin, and 
interstitial collagen type I), produce cytokines (e.g., TGF-β1 and 
PDGF-BB) that activate hepatic stellate cells, and secrete factors 
(e.g., endothelin-1) that contribute to intrahepatic vasoconstriction, which exacerbates portal hypertension in cirrhosis. Conversely, myofibroblasts activate LSEC via secretion of angiogenic factors 
such as VEGF and angiopoietin-1 (66). Antiangiogenic therapies 
have mitigated experimental liver fibrosis, mostly in models with 
a prominent sinusoidal component. However, antifibrotic effects 
were evident with polykinase inhibitors such as sunitinib and 
sorafenib that, apart from angiogenic VEGF or FGF receptors on 
LSECs, also target numerous other cells and kinases involved in 
proliferation, ECM turnover, and immune regulation (67, 68). 
This lack of specificity may explain the finding that treatment with 
anti-VEGF antibody and an antagonist to integrin αvβ3, therapies 
that inhibit LSEC proliferation (but also affect the proliferation 
of endothelia of larger vessels) may worsen advanced biliary, perisinusoidal, and interstitial kidney fibrosis (69–71). Moreover, specific inhibition of VEGF mitigates biliary fibrosis progression but 
retards fibrosis reversal after jejunoileal anastomosis (72). Therefore, as with many other therapies, the antifibrotic efficacy of antiangiogenic therapies is highly context dependent.
T cells. CD4+ T cells with a Th2 polarization, which are prevalent 
in allergies, asthma, or parasite infections, promote fibrogenesis in 
the liver, lungs, or kidneys (18, 73–75). Th2 cells produce IL-4 and 
IL-13, which stimulate the differentiation of potentially fibrogenic 
myeloid cells and (alternatively) activated (M2) macrophages (refs. 
73, 76, and Figure 2D). Thus rodents with Th2-dominant T cell 
infiltration (e.g., in experimental schistosomiasis or in experimental models skewed toward Th2; ref. 77) display rapid fibrosis progression, whereas CD4+ Th1 cells have an antifibrotic effect (78). 
Accordingly, patients dually infected with HCV and Schistosoma 
show a 6-fold faster liver fibrosis progression than matched HCVmonoinfected patients (79).
Th17 cells are clear drivers of fibrosis in multiple tissues (80, 81). 
Th17 cells are induced by a special inflammatory environment, 
including the cytokines TGF-β1 and IL-6. Th17 cells secrete IL-17A, 
which drives fibrogenesis directly in myofibroblasts and indirectly 
via stimulation of TGF-β1 release from inflammatory cells (80, 82).
Regulatory T cells appear to either favor or inhibit fibrogenesis, 
again in a context-dependent manner. Subsets produce various 
amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 (potentially 
antifibrotic) and TGF-β1 (profibrotic). In most settings of chronic 
inflammation, TGF-β1 prevails.
NK and NKT cells are enriched in the liver and belong to the 
innate (NK) immune system or the interface between the innate 
and adaptive (NKT) immune system. In rodent models of liver 
fibrosis, NK cells repress fibrosis in two ways: (a) by killing earlyactivated or senescent hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts that 
express NK cell ligands and (b) via production of (antifibrotic) IFN 
(83). In rodent studies, the effect of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells on 
liver fibrosis is controversial and modest. At best, iNKTs attenuate 
early but not late toxin-induced fibrogenesis (84), whereas (variable) NKTs worsened fibrosis in the methionine- and choline-deficient diet NASH model (59). Similar to NK cells, beneficial activity 
may be explained by killing of hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts 
and IFN secretion, but subsets of iNKT cells can also produce profibrotic IL-13. Notably, iNKT cells protected against diet-induced 
obesity, insulin resistance, and NASH (85), making them a potential therapeutic target for this common cause of liver fibrosis.
Monocytes. Monocytes, which play a key role in inflammation 
and fibrosis, are also precursors of fibrocytes, macrophages, and 
dendritic cells and share characteristics with myeloid suppressor 
cells (86, 87). At the interface of innate and adaptive immunity, 
monocytes help orchestrate adaptive immune responses, with 
proinflammatory monocytes (Ly6C+Gr1+ in mice; CD14+CD16+
in humans) promoting fibrogenesis (88, 89). Chemokines and 
their receptors are important in monocyte recruitment and activation, representing attractive targets for fibrosis modulation (16, 
90). CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 are central to monocyte recruitment to the inflammatory lesion, and their inhibition ameliorates 
fibrosis progression in rodent models but retards fibrosis reversal 
(86). Conversely, the chemokine CXCL9 (and CXCL10) prevents 
pathological angiogenesis and fibrogenesis via activation of their 
receptor, CX3CR (91–93). Monocytes are also the precursors of circulating fibrocytes, cells that differentiate into collagen-producing 
fibroblasts and are related to BM mesenchymal stem cells (12). On 
the other hand, monocytes are the source of fibrolytic CD133+
cells that home to liver to induce fibrosis reversal after BM transplantation (12, 17). Chemokines and their receptors are important 
in monocyte recruitment and activation, representing attractive 
targets for fibrosis modulation.
Macrophages. These resident cells derive from circulating monocytes as precursors (partly replenishing the liver specific Kupffer

cells). M1 macrophages are induced by IFN or IL-12, while IL-4, 
IL-13, and GM-CSF induce M2 macrophages. Macrophages appear 
to be fibrogenic during fibrosis progression and fibrolytic during 
its reversal, but a detailed functional analysis and assignment to 
M1 or the various M2 subclasses has remained elusive (18, 23, 26). 
While M1 macrophages are activated in immediate defense against 
pathogens or detrimental cellular debris, M2 macrophages are generally thought to promote wound healing (i.e., fibrogenesis) and 
immune suppression (e.g., facilitating cancer growth as tumorassociated macrophages) (18, 94, 95). M2 macrophages respond to 
IL-4 and IL-13 via IL-4 receptor and IL-13 receptor α1 (with IL-13 
receptor α2 serving as negative regulator) and are characterized 
by unique signal transducers (e.g., Stat6), enzymes (e.g., arginase), 
or scavenger receptors (e.g., CD206). However, several subtypes of 
M2 macrophages exist, such as the putatively proinflammatory 
M2a, and the anti-inflammatory M2b and M2c subtypes, which 
have ill-defined roles in fibrosis (20, 74). A recent study demonstrated that fibrolytic macrophages in liver fibrosis derive from 
circulating Ly6Chi-expressing monocytes and develop locally into 
Ly6Clo-expressing macrophages with some classical M2 markers 
and a high expression of fibrolytic MMPs, and this development 
depends on phagocytic activity (96). Notably, MMP release depends 
on phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which is also a driver of biliary fibrosis reversal (23). Given that M1 polarization in liver and 
adipose tissue enhances insulin resistance and promotes inflammation in NASH, whereas M2 polarization is protective (97), the 
targeting of macrophage polarization in liver inflammation and 
fibrosis is an attractive therapeutic option.
Other relevant molecular targets
Several other molecular targets are of interest, and some have 
already entered clinical studies. ECM cross-linking, mainly of 
fibrillar collagen, is largely mediated by lysyl oxidase (LOXL2). 
LOXL2 likely impedes ECM degradation during fibrosis reversal, 
and antifibrotic activity has been seen in a small study of CCL4-
induced liver fibrosis (98). A humanized antibody that blocks 
LOXL2 activity is currently assessed in the largest clinical study 
for liver fibrosis (Tables 1 And 2).
TLRs are sensors of bacteria, viruses, and foreign antigens. TLRs 
are expressed ubiquitously but are prominent on cells of the innate 
immune system, creating a proinflammatory environment and 
activating adaptive immunity to promote pathogen elimination. 
As the major interface between the gut and systemic circulation, 
liver cells are equipped with a variety of TLRs that are central to 
both maintaining immune tolerance and initiating inflammation 
and repair when confronted with (microbial) danger signals (99). 
A direct link exists between liver fibrosis and bacterial LPS, and 
activation of its receptor TLR4. LPS enters the portal hepatic circulation in conditions of enhanced intestinal permeability, such 
as in ASH, NASH, and other intestinal and liver diseases. LPS 
upregulates chemokine secretion of monocytes and macrophages/
Kupffer cells and downregulates the inhibitory TGF-β1 pseudoreceptor Bambi, which cumulatively sensitizes hepatic stellate 
cells/myofibroblasts to fibrogenic activation (99, 100). Prevention 
of excessive TLR4 activation or inhibition of TLR4 are therefore 
attractive strategies to inhibit fibrogenesis. Currently only the parenteral TLR4 antagonist, eritoran tetrasodium, is being studied for 
the treatment of sepsis (101). Other interesting but little explored 
targets include TLR3, a double-stranded RNA sensor whose activation by polyI:C attenuates liver fibrosis via activation of NK cells 
(102), and TLR9, a receptor for double-stranded bacterial DNA 
that enhances fibrogenic immune activation via release of CCL2 
(103). In addition, inhibitors of broadly expressed chemokine 
systems other than CCR2/CCL2, mainly CXCL4 and CCL5 (and 
their receptors CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively) on myofibroblasts, 
T cells, and macrophages, have been shown to attenuate liver fibrosis (104–106). Furthermore, the recent explosion of data related to 
microRNAs (miRs) has uncovered miRs that inhibit (miR-29b) or 
promote fibrogenesis (miR-199, miR-200, and others) (107–109). 
While these miRs appear to have some specificity for myofibroblasts, their efficient in vivo delivery poses a problem.
TGF-β and, to a lesser degree, its downstream mediator, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), are potent profibrogenic 
cytokines for hepatic stellate cells/myofibroblasts (1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 18, 
19). However, their general and untargeted inhibition poses risks, 
especially for TGF-β–neutralizing agents, given that this cytokine 
is central to cellular differentiation, immune regulation (dampening excessive T cell activation), and regulated wound healing, such 
as in vascular plaque stabilization in atherosclerosis (110).
Preclinical proof of concept
Before entering clinical studies, best preclinical proof of antifibrotic activity needs to be obtained in complementary rodent 
models that reflect different aspects of human liver fibrosis (6). 
Moreover, drug testing in cultures of precision-cut human liver 
slices obtained from operations permit a first translation toward 
the human in vivo system (111).
Combination therapies
Combination therapies that address liver fibrosis in a multipronged approach hold much promise for future treatment, ideally targeting interactions between cells, soluble mediators, the ECM 
and its receptors, and/or relevant intracellular signaling. Combinations of targeted antifibrotic agents have yet to be thoroughly 
tested in preclinical studies. Significant expense and effort will be 
required to rigorously validate combinations at different doses 
and in several rodent fibrosis models. However, combinations of 
specific drugs can be anticipated that interfere with fibrogenesis, 
induce fibrolysis, or address different cell types.
Clinical development of combination therapies that could guarantee thorough efficacy and low toxicity is only feasible with the 
advent of improved noninvasive biomarkers and technologies to 
measure fibrosis, and especially fibrogenesis. Moreover, the necessary personalized approach to the patient with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis will only be possible with such biomarkers, permitting the 
adjustment of different medications and their dose according to a 
readily measurable treatment effect.
Testing antifibrotics in clinical trials
Recent clinical trials with efficient causal therapy have demonstrated reversibility of advanced liver fibrosis. Perhaps the best 
example is a study of 348 patients with chronic hepatitis B who 
were treated with the potent antiviral tenofovir (112). After five 
years, regression of fibrosis was observed in 91% of patients with 
significant fibrosis at study entry. Only 12 of 252 patients (5%) 
showed fibrosis progression, while 71 of the 96 patients (74%) with 
cirrhosis at baseline were no longer cirrhotic at year five. Moreover, 
all but one of these individuals had at least a two-unit reduction 
(out of a possible total of six units) in Ishak fibrosis score at year 
five, a difference that strongly rules out biopsy sampling variability.

While some additional human studies also suggested antifibrotic 
activities of tenofovir, others failed to show an effect. Tables 1 
and 2 list past and current clinical studies with liver fibrosis as 
primary endpoint, and Supplemental Table 1 (supplemental material available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI66028DS1) 
shows studies with liver fibrosis as a secondary endpoint. Table 3 
highlights clinical studies for other fibrotic diseases that are relevant for liver. Clinical studies targeting major multicellular fibrogenic pathways are shown in Table 4. We also summarize trials 
employing stem cells, an approach that is attractive in combination with pharmacological therapies (Table 5). Notably, development efforts have largely focused on extracellular targets because 
intracellular targets are less accessible and tend to lack specificity 
for the fibrogenic cells.
Optimal selection and stratification of patients. Subjects should be 
matched according to etiology, age, gender, signs of the metabolic syndrome, medications, and risk factors such as alcohol or 
tobacco consumption (7–9). Preferably, patients should be in an 
intermediate fibrosis stage, where dynamic changes of fibrosis are 
best detectable. Patients with chronic HCV infection following liver 
transplant are considered a preferred study population because up 
to 30% experience an accelerated fibrosis progression to cirrhosis 
within three to five years (60). Patients should be further stratified 
according to their genetic risk to progress to cirrhosis (7, 8, 60, 113).
Assessing fibrosis
Assessment of fibrosis progression is far more difficult for liver 
than for lungs or kidneys because transaminases do not correlate 
with fibrosis or fibrogenesis and liver function parameters such 
as albumin or prothrombin time (protein synthesis) are usually 
only altered in cirrhosis. Liver biopsy remains the standard for 
studies with antifibrotics. However, liver biopsy is invasive and 
risky (2, 6, 8, 60, 114) and prone to considerable sampling error, 
and its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Even 
in well-stratified cohorts, given the usually slow fibrosis progression, conventional fibrosis staging (Metavir, Ishak) may require 
approximately 200 patients studied over a period of two to three 
years to detect a 20%–30% difference in fibrosis between treatment 
groups. However, by including current surrogates of fibrosis progression, it appears feasible to conduct proof-of-concept trials in 
approximately 100 patients within 12 months or less.
Refined liver biopsy readouts. Predictive value may be improved 
using dynamic biopsy-derived parameters, such as semiquantification of activated α-SMA–positive myofibroblasts and the 
fibrogenic cytokine TGF-β after immunostaining (115), or quantitative PCR quantification of transcripts that are related to fibrogenesis or fibrolysis (116).
Radiological imaging. Conventional and contrast ultrasonography, 
computerized tomography, and MRI, PET, single-photon emission 
computerized tomography, and diffusion-weighted MRI cannot 
differentiate fibrosis stages. However, magnetic resonance texture 
analysis, which requires sophisticated instrumentation and software, may permit semiquantitative fibrosis assessment (4, 8).
Elastography. Ultrasound elastography (UE) and axial radiation 
force imaging (ARFI) measure hepatic stiffness and elasticity. 
These techniques sample a 100-fold-larger volume than biopsy 
and can differentiate mild (Metavir F0–F1) from significant fibrosis (F2–F4) and cirrhosis (F4), with diagnostic accuracies (area 
under receiver operating characteristics [AUROC] curves) around 
and above 0.90, which is considered good (8, 114, 116). Magnetic 
resonance elastography assesses the whole liver and may be superior to UE/ARFI, but is not generally available, and studies are

small (8, 117). UE is useful for initial stratification of patients 
according to fibrosis stage.
Serum fibrosis markers. More than 2,000 studies in the last five 
years have employed serological markers to assess liver fibrosis, 
mostly in patients with HCV (2, 6, 8, 60, 118–121). These markers reflect liver function (indirect markers), are related to matrix 
metabolism (direct markers), or both. The best marker panels 
show AUROCs around 0.8–0.85 to differentiate between no/mild 
fibrosis (Metavir F0–F1) and moderate/severe fibrosis (F2–F4). 
Fibrosis markers have almost exclusively been validated as predictors of fibrosis stage, while especially the direct parameters may 
rather reflect the dynamics of fibrogenesis and/or fibrolysis (2, 8). 
Recent studies suggest that certain marker combinations such as 
the (indirect) Fibrotest (122) and the (direct) enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test can predict hard endpoints. Thus ELF was superior to fibrosis stage, the Child-Pugh or the Model for End-Stage 
Liver Disease (MELD) score, to predict hepatic decompensation 
or death in long-term, retrospective follow-up studies of patients 
with advanced chronic HCV or PBC (123–125).
Combination of methods. The combination of serum fibrosis markers with elastography increases diagnostic accuracy, permitting a 
clear allocation to either no/mild (F0–F1) or significant (F2–F4) 
fibrosis in 70% of patients (8, 114).
Measurement of portal hypertension and quantitative liver function. 
The hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG) is an excellent predictor of decompensation or death in patients with cirrhosis (126). A 
non-invasive alternative, the hepatic vein arrival time of an injected 
ultrasound contrast agent, needs further validation (127).
Tests that measure the metabolic capacity of the liver, such as 
demethylation of ingested methacetin and quantification of the 
exhaled metabolite 13CO2, correlate inversely with the severity of 
liver inflammation and fibrosis, and the results of such tests can 
complement antifibrotic drug trials (128).
Quantitative imaging of liver fibrosis and fibrogenesis. Methods that 
employ a small molecular ligand for fibrillar collagen, elastin, or a 
cell-associated molecule coupled to a radio-imaging or MRI agent 
are in development (4, 8). Examples include an elastin-specific 
MRI probe for imaging of fibrosis (129) and probes for quantifying fibrogenic cells via the cholangiocyte integrin αvβ6 or the myofibroblast-specific PDGFRβ (4, 8). When improved, such methodology could serve as a novel gold standard for the assessment of 
fibrosis/fibrogenesis and permit short-term testing of potential 
antifibrotics before and after a single dose of the drug.
Novel biomarkers. Apart from ongoing efforts to find and validate 
better serum markers of fibrosis, fibrogenesis, and fibrolysis (4, 8), 
three methodologies will likely become relevant for antifibrotic drug 
trials: (a) urinary assessment of proteolytic activities in the fibrotic 
liver could be monitored after injection of mass-encoded proteasesensitive peptides conjugated to nanoparticles and multiplexed 
detection of cleavage products by mass spectrometry (2, 130); (b) 
membrane microparticles, which are shed from activated or apoptotic cells, can be quantified in the bloodstream via their cell-specific 
surface molecules; microparticles represent a novel set of quantitative diagnostic markers to monitor cell-specific activation in liver 
inflammation and fibrosis (3, 131); and (c) circulating miRs that can 
reflect liver-specific pathology, including hepatocyte differentiation 
and activation, cancer growth, and liver fibrosis (109).
Conclusions
We have gained remarkable insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of liver fibrosis and reversal, and even reversal 
of cirrhosis appears feasible in preclinical models. Currently, the 
field has progressed toward clinical translation. As antifibrotics 
address mechanisms that are embedded in a complex multicellular network, their efficacy is predicted to be context dependent. 
Combination therapies hold most promise, but their development 
and use require a personalized medicine approach that depends on 
the development and validation of novel noninvasive markers and 
techniques to quantify liver fibrosis and especially fibrogenesis.
