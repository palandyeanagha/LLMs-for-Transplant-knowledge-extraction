To investigate characteristics of hepatitis E cases in the 
United States, we tested samples from persons seronegative 
for acute hepatitis A and B whose clinical specimens were 
referred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
during June 2005–March 2012 for hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
testing. We found that 26 (17%) of 154 persons tested had 
hepatitis E. Of these, 15 had not recently traveled abroad 
(nontravelers), and 11 had (travelers). Compared with travelers, nontravelers were older (median 61 vs. 32 years of age) 
and more likely to be anicteric (53% vs. 8%); the nontraveler 
group also had fewer persons of South Asian ethnicity (7% 
vs. 73%) and more solid-organ transplant recipients (47% vs. 
0). HEV genotype 3 was characterized from 8 nontravelers 
and genotype 1 or 4 from 4 travelers. Clinicians should consider HEV infection in the differential diagnosis of hepatitis, 
regardless of patient travel history.

RESEARCH

Hepatitis E Virus Infection, United States, 2005–2012
Hepatitis E in Africa, southern and central Asia, and Central America causes occasional outbreaks of 
jaundice and, between outbreaks, occurrences of sporadic 
jaundice. Primarily spread by waterborne transmission, the 
disease tends to resolve spontaneously, although fulminant 
hepatic failure can ensue (1). In eastern Asia and Europe, 
sporadic hepatitis E, whether imported after return from 
international travel or acquired indigenously, has been observed; the indigenous form is thought to be foodborne (2). 
Although the disease is largely self-limiting, in Europe, 
chronic hepatitis E, which may lead to cirrhosis, is increasingly recognized among solid-organ transplant recipients 
(SOTRs) (3). 
The causative agent of hepatitis E is hepatitis E virus 
(HEV), of which 4 genotypes are found in humans. Genotypes 1 and 2 circulate in regions where waterborne transmission is common; genotype 3 is prevalent in eastern Asia 
and the West and genotype 4 in eastern Asia. Genotypes 1 
and 2 infect humans, but genotypes 3 and 4 infect humans 
and animals, predominantly pigs (4).
In the United States, HEV imported into the country 
after travel to regions to which waterborne HEV transmission is endemic is well recognized (5–7). Recently, 21% 
of participants of the US-based Third National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey were found seropositive for 
IgG anti-HEV (8). This unexpectedly high prevalence rate 
would not be ascribable to imported HEV infection alone. 
Indeed, cases of hepatitis E unassociated with travel abroad 
have been observed in the United States, implying infection 
by indigenous HEV strains (9–14). Moreover, the increasing number of reports from Europe of hepatitis E among 
SOTRs (3,15) suggests that SOTR in the United States 
might be similarly susceptible to the disease.
We report a study of demographic, clinical, travel-related, and virologic characteristics of persons with hepatitis 
E derived from a diverse patient base. Critical to this investigation was the application of a validated serologic assay for detecting IgM anti-HEV (16), the marker of recent 
HEV infection, as well as a real-time reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR) that had been validated to detect, to high 
sensitivity, HEV RNA (17), which is an indicator of active HEV shedding. Together, these 2 assays enabled us to 
identify patients with incident hepatitis E.
Methods
Samples and Patients
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
conducts HEV testing of serum and stool samples referred 
by health care providers, public health departments, and diagnostic laboratories in the United States (18). Referrers 
are requested to fill out a standardized questionnaire of patients’ demographics, clinical and laboratory test features, 
and risks for HEV infection, including recent international 
travel and destinations visited; the completed questionnaire 
is submitted along with the test specimens (18). Persons 
whose specimens were received during June 2005–March 
2012 and reported as being negative for IgM against hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B core antigen, regardless of positivity for IgG against hepatitis C virus, were considered for 
inclusion into the study.
Assays
An earlier, pangenotypic evaluation by CDC of 6 
serologic assays for IgM anti-HEV identified the assay 
manufactured by Diagnostic Systems (Saronno, Italy) as 
having the best performance characteristics (16). Its diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 95.2%, respectively, and its analytic sensitivity was 9 Walter Reed 
Units/mL. For this study, the assay was used to detect IgM 
anti-HEV in test samples. IgG anti-HEV was tested by applying an assay from the same manufacturer. Serum and 
stool samples were tested for HEV RNA by a real-time 
RT-PCR, capable of detecting HEV genotypes 1–4 to a 
sensitivity of 4 HEV genome-equivalents/mL, to amplify 
a 69-bp fragment in open reading frame (ORF) 3 of the 
HEV genome (19). Application of that assay enabled our 
laboratory to attain perfect detection scores in a recent international evaluation of 20 laboratories conducting HEV 
RNA testing (17). Samples found to be positive for HEV 
RNA were subjected to another RT-PCR to generate amplicons from a 258-bp segment from ORF1, which were 
then processed for nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic 
analyses (20).
Statistics
Distributions of variables were assessed by using the 
Kruskal-Wallis test and the χ2 test with the Yates correction or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Univariate and 
bivariate data analyses were conducted by using Epi Info 
(wwwn.cdc.gov/EpiInfo/html/prevVersion.htm). 
Case Definition 
A case of hepatitis E was defined as illness in a person in whom IgM and IgG anti-HEV in serum or HEV 
RNA in serum or stool samples were detected. A person 
in whom IgM but not IgG anti-HEV was detected in serum was excluded unless HEV RNA was found or IgG 
anti-HEV was detected in follow-up serum samples. A 
person in whom IgG but not IgM anti-HEV was detected 
in serum samples was included if HEV RNA was found in 
serum or stool samples.
Results
Of 154 persons whose specimens fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 26 (17%) met the case definition for hepatitis

E. Case-patients were between 14–67 years of age (median 43 years); 19 (73%) were male. Fifteen (58%) were 
white, 9 (36%) South Asian, and 2 (8%) Hispanic. None 
were seropositive for IgG against HCV. Eighteen (69%) 
case-patients were jaundiced, and 7 (27%) were SOTRs, 
the allografts received being kidney (3), liver (2), kidney 
and pancreas (1), and heart and lungs (1). Fifteen case-patients (58%) who reported not having traveled outside the 
United States in the previous 2 months were classified as 
nontravelers; the remaining 11, who had traveled abroad, 
were classified as travelers. 
The Table summarizes the demographic, clinical, 
and virologic data for individual case-patients. Compared 
with travelers, nontravelers were older (median age 61 vs. 
32 years of age; p<0.05) and more likely to be anicteric 
(not jaundiced; 8/15 [53%] vs. 1/11 [8%]; p = 0.02). The 
nontraveler group also included fewer South Asians (1/15 
[7%] vs. 8/11 [73%]; p<0.001) and more SOTRs (7/15 
[47%] vs. 0; p = 0.02). Differences in sex distribution were 
not significant.
Three case-patients (NT6, NT7, and T9; Table) were 
documented to have fulminant hepatic failure. Two of them 
required liver transplantation; 1 died and 1 survived.
HEV RNA was amplified from 12 case-patients 
(46%). The rate of HEV RNA detection among SOTRs 
(5/7; 71%) was higher than that among non-SOTRs (7/19; 
37%), but this difference was not significant. HEV genotype 1 was characterized from 3 travelers, genotype 3 
from 8 nontravelers (including the 5 SOTRs), and genotype 4 from 1 traveler. The Figure displays the genetic 
diversity of HEV carried.
Discussion
We identified 26 case-patients with hepatitis E in the 
United States. No distinction was made between acute and 
chronic hepatitis E. Whereas acute hepatitis among non220 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 19, No. 2, February 2013

Hepatitis E Virus Infection, United States, 2005–2012 title
SOTRs was readily identifiable (most were jaundiced when 
test specimens were drawn), it was difficult to assess whether 
disease in SOTRs was at the acute or chronic stage during 
specimen sampling, because positivity for IgM anti-HEV or 
HEV RNA could reflect either stage (3). Thus, the case definition was kept broad to identify both stages of disease. As 
the study was not primarily prospective, the natural history 
of hepatitis E among the case-patients was largely unknown. 
Nevertheless, adverse outcomes could be documented for 3 
case-patients, in whom fulminant hepatic failure developed.
Hepatitis E cases were found among persons who had 
not recently traveled abroad and those who had. Nontravelers tended to be older than travelers, a trend consistent with 
the finding recently reported by the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network of 9 patients seropositive for IgM anti-HEV 
whose mean age was 67 years (21) and with similar observations in Japan and Europe (1,2,22). The higher proportion of anicteric persons in the nontraveler group reflects 
its inclusion of all SOTRs, which in Europe have been observed to have largely asymptomatic infections (3).
Nontravelers were infected exclusively by HEV genotype 3 strains. These strains clustered with HEV previously found in case-patients with nonimported acute hepatitis E (9–12,14) in the United States (Figure), suggesting 
that the nontravelers were infected by autochthonously 
circulating HEV. The similarity between HEV genotype 
3 strains identified in nontravelers with those in swine (4) 
(Figure) suggests, but does not prove, HEV transmission 
linkage between humans and pigs (2). Evidence of HEV 
infection acquired after consumption of inadequately 
cooked meat and offal originating from pigs, boars, and 
deer has been reported from Japan (2) and France (23). 
Elsewhere, including the United States, evidence implicating non–travel-associated hepatitis E as a zoonosis remains weak (24).
The patient base from which hepatitis E cases were 
identified was nonselective, broad, and derived from multiple health care provider contexts. Nonetheless, data from 
this study were not generated from an established, systematic program of epidemiologic surveillance. Accordingly, 
the cases identified here may not fully represent the extent 
of hepatitis E in the United States. The larger number of 
cases among nontravelers likely reflects more persons living in the United States who do not travel abroad compared 
with those who do, and the many SOTRs identified with 
hepatitis E could be an overrepresentation resulting from 
increasing awareness among physicians of the predilection of the SOTR patient subpopulation to HEV infection 
(3,15). Future surveillance of hepatitis E may need to sample source populations from more diverse settings, such as 
gastroenterology/hepatology clinics (21), travel clinics (6), 
and the military (7). We recently reported findings from a 
study of HEV infection among immunocompromised patients other than SOTRs (25).
This study has provided insight into nonimported and 
imported hepatitis E in the United States. The nonimported 
form was observed to affect SOTRs, be able to lead to adverse outcomes, and be associated with infection by HEV 
genotype 3. The extent of nonimported hepatitis E in the 
United States merits further investigation, as does the role 
of autochthonous transmission of genotype 3 HEV strains. 
In clinical practice, entry of hepatitis E into the differential 
diagnosis of suspected hepatitis, regardless of the patient’s 
travel history, would be appropriate.
