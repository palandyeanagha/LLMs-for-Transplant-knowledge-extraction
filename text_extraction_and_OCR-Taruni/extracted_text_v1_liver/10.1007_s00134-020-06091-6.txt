Abstract
Purpose: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is increasingly reported in patients with infuenza admitted to the inten‑
sive care unit (ICU). Classifcation of patients with infuenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) using the cur‑
rent defnitions for invasive fungal diseases has proven difcult, and our aim was to develop case defnitions for IAPA 
that can facilitate clinical studies.
Methods: A group of 29 international experts reviewed current insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and man‑
agement of IAPA and proposed a case defnition of IAPA through a process of informal consensus.
Results: Since IAPA may develop in a wide range of hosts, an entry criterion was proposed and not host factors. 
The entry criterion was defned as a patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress with a positive infuenza 
test temporally related to ICU admission. In addition, proven IAPA required histological evidence of invasive septate 
hyphae and mycological evidence for Aspergillus. Probable IAPA required the detection of galactomannan or positive 
Aspergillus culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum with pulmonary infltrates or a positive culture in upper 
respiratory samples with bronchoscopic evidence for tracheobronchitis or cavitating pulmonary infltrates of recent 
onset. The IAPA case defnitions may be useful to classify patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis 
(CAPA), while awaiting further studies that provide more insight into the interaction between Aspergillus and the 
SARS-CoV-2-infected lung.

Introduction
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a well-recognized disease afecting immunocompromised individuals with prolonged neutropenia, inherited neutrophil 
disorders or T cell defects, with the risk depending on 
the patients’ underlying disease and the type and duration of immunosuppressive therapy [1]. Patients at the 
highest risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA) include those 
undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia (AL) or recipients of allogeneic cell transplantation 
(alloHCT) who develop severe graft-versus-host disease, for whom antifungal prophylaxis is currently recommended [2, 3]. With changing treatment modalities, 
new risk groups continue to emerge, such as patients 
treated with ibrutinib [4, 5].
Although over the past four decades a link between 
infuenza and IPA has been noted in single cases [6], 
recent cohort studies provide new insights into the epidemiology and clinical presentation of IPA in intensive 
care unit (ICU) patients with infuenza [7–9]. Patients 
presenting with infuenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) may have classic European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycosis Study Group Education and Research Consortium 
(MSGERC)-defned host factors [10], but a notable proportion of patients was deemed to be at low risk of IPA, 
including previously healthy individuals. In addition, the 
clinical and radiological presentation was often atypical with radiological features that were not considered 
suggestive of invasive fungal disease. As a consequence, 
we cannot classify these patients according to existing 
consensus defnitions, i.e., the EORTC/MSGERC defnitions and the AspICU algorithm for classifcation of IPA 
patients in the ICU [10, 11]. We therefore set out to discuss current insights into the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of IAPA and to propose 
case defnitions that can facilitate homogeneity and comparability in clinical studies.
Participants and methods
Te expert panel is comprised of 29 participants from 
seven European countries, the USA and Taiwan. To 
ensure heterogenicity, participants were selected from 
various felds of expertise: medical microbiology (PEV, 
KL, CL-F, TRR), infectious diseases (BJAR, MB, TC, 
CJC, OAC, DRG, NAFJ, BJK, OL, MH-N, TFP, FLvdV), 
intensive care medicine (EA, SB, PD, PW-LL, IM-L, 
JAS, LV, JW), clinical pharmacology (RJMB, RL, IS), 
public health (TC) and hematology (OAC, JM). Selected 
participants furthermore had specifc expertise in 
epidemiology, diagnosis and management of invasive fungal diseases or fungal disease guideline development. Te meeting was prepared by PEV, RJMB, JW 
and FLvdV. Case defnitions were developed through 
a process of informal consensus. Although a systematic literature review was not performed, experts in 
the feld presented overviews regarding epidemiology, 
pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of IAPA, which 
were followed by a group discussion process designed 
to allow members of the group to voice their opinions 
and contribute equally to the decision-making [12]. 
Te goal of the consensus process was to bring the 
group to general agreement. Presentations and initial 
discussions took place on a single day meeting in April 
2019 in Amsterdam and were continued through electronic exchange of views until consensus was achieved. 
Te chosen framework included host and risk factors, 
clinical factors and mycological evidence, similar to the 
framework in the EORTC/MSGERC defnitions and 
the AspICU algorithm [10, 11]. A medical writer made 
notes of the meeting, which were used as input to write 
the manuscript. A frst draft manuscript was prepared 
by PEV, BJAR, RJMB, JW and FLvdV and circulated for 
comments from all experts. Te experts reviewed and 
commented on the manuscript. Using these comments, 
a fnal version was circulated for approval. Te logistics 
of the meeting were handled by a certifed Congress 
organizer (Congress Care, s’Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands) with fnancial support of Pfzer (Pfzer B.V., 
Capelle aan den IJssel, the Netherlands). Congress Care
and Pfzer had no infuence on the selection of participants, selected topics, discussions, preparation and 
fnal approval of the content of the manuscript.
Conclusion: A consensus case defnition of IAPA is proposed, which will facilitate research into the epidemiology, 
diagnosis and management of this emerging acute and severe Aspergillus disease, and may be of use to study CAPA.

Take‑home message
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is an emerging co-infection in 
patients with infuenza who are admitted to the ICU. An interna‑
tional team of experts proposed consensus case defnitions of 
infuenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in order to facilitate 
clinical studies and the defnition may also be useful to study 
COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.

Expert review
Global epidemiology of infuenza and IAPA
Although fgures vary depending on geographic region, 
season and vaccination rates, approximately 0.1% of 
infuenza patients require hospital admission with 5–10% 
of these requiring ICU admission [13, 14]. Te mortality in patients admitted for infuenza is 4% and 20–25% 
for those admitted to ICU [14–16]. Bacterial superinfection is common, afecting 10–35% of cases, typically with 
Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus [16]. 
However, a recent Dutch–Belgian multicenter study over 
seven infuenza seasons in seven institutes demonstrated 
infuenza as an independent risk factor of IPA (adjusted 
odds ratio 5.19, 95% confdence interval (CI) 2.63–10.26, 
p<0.001) [9]. Results also showed that the 90-day mortality rate for ICU patients with IAPA was almost double that of ICU infuenza patients without IAPA (51% vs. 
28%, adjusted odds ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.05–3.32). IAPA 
was initially thought to be associated with infuenza A/
H1N1pdm09 only [7, 17], but it became clear that IAPA 
is also associated with other infuenza A and infuenza 
B viruses [9]. Te median time between infuenza diagnosis and IAPA was short, often in the frst 5 days [7, 8, 
18]. Studies have shown considerable variation in rates of 
IAPA in diferent countries, with high rates in the Netherlands, Belgium and Taiwan, but lower rates in other 
countries [19], and in some we do not know the incidence (e.g., USA) [20–22]. Potential reasons for these 
regional diferences are related to the underlying conditions, concomitant exposure to corticosteroids, environmental factors, including exposure to Aspergillus, 
use of non-culture-based diagnostic tests for Aspergillus
(e.g., galactomannan (GM)) and diferences in awareness of IAPA [23–25]. Autopsy rates are very low, which 
results in a considerable underdiagnosis in many countries [26]. Other factors that might contribute to regional 
diferences in IAPA rates include infuenza vaccination 
rates, with diferent policies in diferent countries, and 
diferences in infuenza antiviral treatment strategies 
with oseltamivir or zanamivir [27]. Annual vaccination 
reduces infuenza-associated complications (hospitalization, ICU admission, severity of illness, superinfection) 
and improves the outcome in transplant recipients and 
COPD patients [28, 29].
Pathogenesis of IAPA
In pending studies that explore the pathogenesis of 
IAPA and host immune defects, it is likely that damage 
to the epithelium by infuenza and defective fungal host 
responses in the lung due to infuenza and/or infammatory conditions predispose to Aspergillus disease, similar 
as what is seen in bacterial superinfections. Furthermore, 
autopsy studies have shown the presence of sporulating 
heads of Aspergillus inside the bronchi with invasive 
growth occurring into the lung tissue. Sporulation could 
contribute to a high fungal burden and spread of the 
disease within the lung, thus contributing to the rapid 
disease progression and extensive lung damage. Other 
factors that have been implicated in IAPA include the use 
of corticosteroids and of neuraminidase inhibitors, such 
as oseltamivir [7, 30]. Ultimately, these insights may aid 
in identifying patients at risk of IAPA and to design efective antifungal and adjunctive immunomodulatory treatment strategies.
Clinical presentation and diagnosis of IAPA
A retrospective Belgian study of infuenza patients 
admitted to ICU between September 2009 and March 
2011 showed that 9 of 40 (23%) patients had IAPA. Four 
cases (44%) were proven despite not being immunocompromised according to the EORTC/MSGERC consensus 
defnitions [7]. Te median time between infuenza diagnosis and IAPA was 2  days (range 0–4  days). All IAPA 
patients had positive BAL GM, and 78% had positive 
serum GM, despite not being neutropenic. Eighty-nine 
percent of patients had Aspergillus growth in BAL culture (almost exclusively Aspergillus fumigatus), and 55% 
of patients had endobronchial lesions observed during 
bronchoscopy, possibly indicating invasive tracheobronchitis [7]. Similar performance characteristics of BAL 
GM and culture were reported in two other cohort studies [8, 9]. BAL sampling is thus an important diagnostic 
procedure as serum GM can be negative and sputum/tracheal aspirate cultures can remain sterile.
Lesions that are suggestive of invasive mold disease 
on imaging in neutropenic patients, such as the halo 
sign, are often absent in critically ill patients. However, in some IAPA patients with autopsy-confrmed 
Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, chest CT demonstrated 
peribronchial infltrates. Te main diagnostic clue for 
airway-invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis is epithelial 
plaques, pseudomembranes or ulcers that can be visualized via bronchoscopy, as radiological features may be 
subtle [31]. Worsening of radiographic pulmonary infltrates in patients with infuenza is often attributed to 
progression of ARDS or bacterial infection, leading to 
a change of antimicrobial therapy without performing 
diagnostic procedures [32]. Patients who survived IAPA 
received antifungal therapy much earlier than those 
who did not (2  days after diagnosis of infuenza among 
survivors versus 9  days among non-survivors) [8], suggesting that early diagnosis and administration of antifungal therapy may be important. Lateral fow tests have 
recently become available as an alternative for diagnosing 
IPA (AspLFD, OLM Diagnostics and the sōna Aspergillus GM, IMMY) showing overall good performance in 

1527
hematology patients [33]. Te very quick assessment, 
with results available within 30–45 min, makes this type 
of test very attractive for the management of IAPA and 
use in clinical trials. However, lateral fow tests have not 
yet been validated in the ICU population.
IAPA needs to be considered in patients admitted 
to the ICU with infuenza and where indicated these 
patients should undergo early BAL for Aspergillus antigen testing, culture and microscopy. Patients who test 
positive require anti-Aspergillus therapy, and the BAL 
fuid sample should be fast-tracked for azole resistance 
testing by PCR (and culture when positive) in regions 
with high (>5%) azole resistance rates [34]. Tis would 
enable diagnostic assessment and initiation of adequate 
antifungal therapy within 24–48  h of ICU admission. 
Diagnostic workup for IAPA may be repeated in patients 
deteriorating while on antivirals and/or appropriate antibiotics or when initiating corticosteroid treatment is 
unavoidable.
Discussion on clinical presentation and diagnosis of IAPA
If a patient is admitted to the ICU and has infuenza with 
pulmonary infltrates, the diagnosis of IAPA should be 
considered and further investigation performed as appropriate. Ideally, this would include in order of invasiveness, 
serum GM testing, fungal cultures of sputum and/or tracheal aspirate, pulmonary CT, bronchoscopy to visualize 
the large airways and obtain BAL fuid for GM testing 
and fungal and bacterial cultures. Testing is most appropriate in patients who are on mechanical ventilation, but 
the diagnostic strategy is less clear in patients not intubated. As up to 50% of patients may present with tracheobronchitis, the presence of plaques and ulceration might 
be considered for inclusion in the defnition of IPA [35]. 
Policies for taking biopsies of lesions seen on bronchoscopy may vary, mainly because of concerns about the risk 
of bleeding with biopsy in ICU patients. Te use of a fexible brush may also be sufcient to make the diagnosis.
Although a positive serum GM is highly indicative of 
IA, BAL GM can be positive in patients with Aspergillus
colonization. It therefore does not absolutely discriminate between colonization and invasive disease. However, 
it clearly makes it more likely that an invasive disease is 
present [36].
Use of corticosteroids
Corticosteroids should not be given to infuenza patients 
as their use may be associated with increased risk of 
IAPA [7, 37–39]. A recent Cochrane review on this topic 
concluded that the use of corticosteroids in patients with 
infuenza was associated with a worse outcome [40]. 
However, the evidence was almost exclusively observational. Furthermore, patients are often given steroids in 
the frst few days preceding or after ICU admission for 
a variety of reasons including COPD exacerbation or 
complications such as sepsis. With surveys suggesting 
that approximately half of the physicians are not aware 
of IAPA [24], many physicians may additionally not be 
aware of the potential drawbacks of corticosteroids. 
Whenever the use of corticosteroids is unavoidable, more 
eforts (bronchoscopy with GM detection in BAL fuid 
or serum β-D-glucan test) should be made to exclude or 
diagnose IAPA [41].
Rationale for antifungal prophylaxis for IAPA
In settings with high IAPA rates in ICU patients with 
infuenza pneumonia, an antifungal prophylaxis strategy might be appropriate, particularly as IAPA typically occurs early after ICU admission. However, there 
is currently no mold-active antifungal agent licensed for 
prophylaxis of IA in ICU patients. Posaconazole (POS) 
prophylaxis reduces the prevalence of IA in neutropenic 
AML patients and those with graft-versus-host disease 
following alloHCT [2, 3]. Based on this proof-of-principle, it has been hypothesized that POS prophylaxis can 
reduce IAPA prevalence in ICU patients. Intravenous 
(IV) administration of POS prophylaxis in the ICU is 
favored in patients on mechanical ventilation or with a 
high likelihood of malabsorption of oral formulations. 
POS IV formulation should be administered through a 
central catheter due to its acidity (pH 3.2) [42].
Treatment options and challenges for IAPA in the ICU
First-line treatment options for IPA include voriconazole and isavuconazole [35, 43]. Other options include 
echinocandins in combination with anti-mold azoles, 
and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) in regions with 
high rates of azole-resistant A. fumigatus, although 
clinical data with L-AmB in ICU patients are limited 
[43, 44]. Achieving adequate drug exposure is challenging in ICU patients with multiple factors contributing 
to pharmacokinetic variability. Unlike L-AmB and the 
echinocandins, drug interactions are clinically relevant 
for the azoles and pharmacogenetic factors are important in inter-individual drug exposure variability [45]. 
Te impact of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for 
voriconazole shows a clear relation between exposure 
and both efcacy and toxicity. Target plasma trough 
voriconazole concentrations of ≥1.5–2  mg/L are associated with near-maximal clinical response in treatment 
of IA with a wild-type phenotype [46–51], with higher 
exposures (>5.5 mg/L) increasing the risk of (neuro)toxicity. Higher trough concentrations (>2 mg/L) are recommended for treatment of pathogens with elevated MICs 
(e.g.,>0.25  mg/L) [52]. For isavuconazole, there is no 
robust target plasma concentration, and the population 

1528
average exposure of participants that demonstrated a 
favorable response (2–4 mg/L) is commonly used [43].
Discussion on antifungal treatment options and challenges 
for IAPA in the ICU
A specifc drug–drug interaction is relevant for patients 
with IAPA given the fact that co-infections with S. aureus
are frequently observed; undetectable voriconazole levels have been observed in 11 of 20 patients, who were 
concomitantly treated with fucloxacillin [53], but the 
mechanisms of interaction are not yet fully understood. 
Similar interactions have not been seen with other azoles. 
Many other drug interactions with azoles and drugs commonly deployed in the ICU can be expected [45].
Aerosolized antifungal treatment may be a useful 
adjunctive therapy to systemic antifungal therapy for 
patients with confrmed Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, 
to achieve good endobronchial exposure [35, 54]. However, dense lipophilic plaques in the trachea may be difcult to penetrate and more research is needed into when 
and how to use aerosolized antifungals as well as their 
efcacy. Te ECCMID/ECMM/ERS Aspergillus guideline 
reviewed the teratogenic and mutagenic potential of antifungals in early pregnancy and recommends that azoles 
should be avoided, with polyenes being considered the 
preferred therapy [43, 55]. Tus, for pregnant patients at 
risk of IAPA a diagnostic approach was preferred above 
antifungal prophylaxis.
Tere is little evidence on the impact of ECMO on 
antifungal drug exposure [56]. For the echinocandins, an 
impact of ECMO is not expected. Experts felt that, given 
these uncertainties, TDM of any antifungal used would 
be advised to ensure sufcient drug exposure.
Consensus case defnition for IAPA
Te expert panel discussed which case defnition of IAPA 
would be appropriate to use in clinical studies, initially 
considering various aspects regarding four main areas 
of focus: entry criteria of the consensus defnition, host, 
clinical features and mycological evidence similar to the 
currently used EORTC/MSGERC classifcation.
Entry criterion
In addition to having a positive diagnostic test for infuenza, patients would require to have a clinical syndrome 
compatible with infuenza disease as part of the defnition. Tis criterion should be termed the ‘entry criterion’ 
and not ‘host factor’ for clarity. To avoid the risk of missing patients who initially tested negative with a rapid 
infuenza antigen test but subsequently tested positive 
(by PCR) for infuenza when admitted to hospital, a recommendation on a timescale, such as between 1  week 
before ICU admission and 72–96 h post-admission, was 
included. Te consensus on the entry criterion was: a 
patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress 
with a positive infuenza PCR or antigen test temporally 
related to ICU admission.
Host factors
Host factors are considered in the EORTC/MSGERC definition and AspICU algorithm [10, 11], but the system of 
taking host factors into account was a necessity because 
the risk of a false-positive Aspergillus test increases substantially when the test is done in patients at low risk of 
the disease. Clinicians had to take into account the type 
of host in order to increase the pretest probability of an 
invasive fungal disease being present. However, for IAPA 
the key question is whether the disease is present or not, 
and not whether the patient group has a higher risk than 
other patient groups for developing the disease. More 
importantly, the incidence of IAPA in patients admitted 
to the ICU with infuenza may be higher in some centers 
[9, 21]. No further host factors are needed to increase the 
pretest probability in this patient population. Although 
most IAPA cases have at least one underlying condition 
or steroid use, host factors were not be included in the 
case defnition for IAPA.
Criteria to defne proven and probable cases of IAPA
Te distinction between proven and probable IAPA is 
important for clinical trials, while in clinical practice, 
people should not distinguish between proven and probable disease.
Te criteria for proven disease include a patient fulflling the entry criterion plus histological evidence of invasive fungal elements and mycological evidence for the 
presence of Aspergillus (obtained by Aspergillus PCR or 
culture from tissue). Tracheobronchitis (tracheal and/or 
bronchial ulcerations or nodules, pseudomembranes or 
plaques visualized at bronchoscopy), as also described 
in the EORTC/MSGERC defnitions [10], is a separate entity. Although a tissue biopsy would normally be 
required to prove a case of IAPA, in tracheobronchitis 
cases hyphal elements suggestive of Aspergillus seen on 
sloughed-of pseudomembrane, and Aspergillus identifed on culture or PCR, can also be considered proven 
disease (Table 1).
A patient fulflling the case defnition of probable IAPA 
is required to fulfll the entry criterion. A positive serum 
GM (GM index>0.5) is important evidence for the diagnosis of IAPA, in patients with pulmonary infltrates on 
chest X-ray or other imaging modality or bronchoscopic 
evidence of tracheobronchitis (Table 1). In patients with 
tracheobronchitis, an infltrate is not required.

1529
In patients with endobronchial plaques or pulmonary 
infltrates, a positive BAL GM or culture of a tracheal 
aspirate is considered mycological evidence that supports a probable IAPA diagnosis. In patients with bacterial pneumonia where Aspergillus is cultured only from 
a sputum sample, there may be a risk of overdiagnosis 
and thus over-treatment. For clinical practice, clinicians 
should take into account that a positive culture of an 
upper airway sample may indicate IAPA, but that confrmation with serum or BAL GM or BAL culture should be 
pursued. However, one problem is that the background 
incidence varies in diferent regions, making it difcult to 
develop generalized guidelines that apply uniformly. Te 
signifcance of a positive sputum culture thus depends on 
the background incidence in a specifc unit. Although any 
Aspergillus-positive respiratory sample is in itself insufcient to classify patients as probable IAPA, a new pulmonary cavitating infltrate is indicative of IAPA in patients 
who meet the entry criterion. Terefore, any Aspergilluspositive respiratory sample is sufcient evidence to classify patients as probable IAPA provided that a pulmonary 
cavitating infltrate is present (Table 1; Fig. 1).
A BAL GM index cutof of≥1.0 is recommended 
as this cutof value ensures high specifcity, without 
decreasing sensitivity signifcantly, which is also in line 
with other defnitions and recommendations [10, 57]. 
Aspergillus PCR is not recommended as a primary diagnostic tool because of concerns about its reliability and 
positive predictive value for the diagnosis of IPA. However, Aspergillus PCR is recommended in the proven 
category because it enables Aspergillus identifcation in 
tissue samples.
In some patients, discordant results are obtained, for 
instance a positive sputum culture but negative BAL GM. 
For most situations, IAPA classifcation relies on a positive GM test, as a positive sputum culture with a negative 
GM result would be interpreted as a lower probability of 
IAPA (unless a pulmonary cavity or tracheobronchitis is 
present)(Fig. 1).
Conclusion
IAPA has emerged as a severe complication of infuenza, 
especially in ICU patients, and this secondary infection 
may occur in any patient, including those considered to 
be at low risk of developing IPA. Te global epidemiology of IAPA may be variable, which might be partly due 
to underdiagnosis [24]. Te clinical presentation of IAPA 
includes invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, which 
requires bronchoscopic visualization of plaques in the 
airways to make a diagnosis. Aspergillus culture and BAL 
GM are positive in>80% of IAPA cases, and ordering 
such tests is recommended in infuenza cases in the ICU. 
Te proposed case defnition relies on an entry criterion 
based on an infuenza-like illness and the detection of 
infuenza virus. Te case defnition distinguishes between 
invasive tracheobronchitis and other pulmonary forms of 
IAPA, with demonstration of invasive fungal hyphae with 
positive mycology qualifying as proven infection. Detection of GM or positive Aspergillus culture in BAL is the 
main mycological criteria in probable case defnition.
Te expert group acknowledges that to date still limited data exist to support a defnitive approach regarding

defnitions, diagnosis and treatment of IAPA, but the 
proposed case defnition will facilitate clinical research, 
will enable valid study comparisons and is essential for 
surveillance. Awareness of IAPA and early antifungal 
therapy based on high clinical suspicion and Aspergillus
diagnostics remains critical to improve the outcome of 
IAPA.
Can the IAPA defnitions be applied 
to COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis?
Recent reports of IPA cases in coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) patients in the ICU raise the question of whether these IAPA defnitions can be applied to 
COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) 
[58–60]. Although the number of CAPA cases that have 
been reported is still limited, two recent studies reported 
putative CAPA cases in 9 of 27 (33%) and 5 of 19 (26%) 
COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU [59, 60]. 
Although the high number of cases suggests a high risk of 
developing IPA in COVID-19 patients, there are a number of diferences regarding the pathogenesis of SARSCoV-2 infection compared with infuenza (Table  2). 
In infuenza patients, there are several factors that are 
thought to contribute to the risk of IAPA, including the 
local tissue damage caused by infuenza, an immune 
modulatory efect by suppression of the NADPH oxidase 
complex and possible efect of treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir. In SARS-CoV-2 
infection, another receptor is used by the virus to enter 
human cells, which are not commonly found in the large 
airways (Table  2). Tus, the risk of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis may be lower in CAPA compared 
with IAPA. In addition, there is no known direct immune 
modulatory efect of SARS-CoV-2, which suggests no 
virus infection-related increased risk of IPA. While IAPA 
is characterized by rapidly fatal infections with high 
fungal burden, such course of disease progression has 
not been reported for CAPA. On the contrary, eight of 
nine CAPA cases reported from a French cohort did not 
receive antifungal therapy, with a mortality rate similar 
to COVID-19 cases without IPA [59]. As, in contrast to 
IAPA cases, virtually all CAPA cases reported to date are 
serum GM negative, the question remains if COVID-19 
patients develop invasive disease or just become colonized with Aspergillus. It is possible that COVID-19 is in 
itself not a risk factor for IPA, but that the risk is associated with other risk factors related to treatment such

as administration of corticosteroids or underlying host 
factors. Nevertheless, the high rate of Aspergillus recovered from COVID-19 patients suggests that there might 
be conditions that favor growth of the fungus in the lung. 
We think that the proposed IAPA case defnitions may 
be considered for classifcation of CAPA patients, while 
awaiting further histopathological studies that provide 
more insight into the interaction between Aspergillus and 
the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung.

Table 2 Comparison between characteristics of IAPA and CAPA
Factor IAPA CAPA
Host/Risk 57% EORTC/MSGERC host factor negative [9] 85% EORTC/MSGERC host factor negative [59, 60]
IAPA associated with corticosteroid use [7] IPA developed in SARS-2003-infected patients receiving corti‑
costeroids [61]
Lymphopenia and chemokine-producing monocyte-derived 
FCN1+macrophages causing hyperinfammation [62]
Virus Cell entry through sialic acids-2,6Gal: epithelial layer in lung 
including larger airways [63]
Cell entry through ACE2: type 2 pneumocytes and ciliated cells 
[64]
Immune modulation by suppression of the NADPH oxidase 
complex [65]
No evidence for immunomodulatory efect on known antifun‑
gal host defense mechanisms, although this has not been 
extensively studied yet
Fungal infection Invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis in up to 55% of patients 
[7–9]
Invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis not yet reported [59, 60]
Median time between ICU admission and IAPA diagnosis

unknown [59, 60]
Serum GM positive in 65% [7–9] Serum GM positive in 3 of 14 (21%) COVID-19 patients [59, 60]
Secondary infections In 80 of 342 (23.4%) ICU patients, most frequent pathogens S. 
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus [66]

ICU mortality 45% in IAPA compared with 20% in infuenza without IAPA 
(p<0.0001) [9]
33% in CAPA cases compared with 17% in COVID-19 without 
CAPA (p=0.4) [59] (although mortality rates due to COVID-19 
without CAPA vary enormous between countries and we 
have no clear data yet on the true mortality in ICU of COVID19)
