INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation (LT) has become an established 
treatment for properly selected patients with end stage liver 
disease, primary and some secondary hepatic malignancies 
and some rare metabolic liver diseases. Increased use of potent 
immunosuppressive agents has dramatically reduced the 
incidence of rejection in the transplant population, while increasing patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections and 
cancer [1]. Infection and rejection remain the major causes of 
morbidity after LT, together accounting for up to 85% of deaths 
[2].
Many studies have reported that infection is one of the main 
factors influencing morbidity and mortality in posttransplant 
patients. Approximately 80% of solid-organ transplant recipients suffer at least one significant episode of infection 
during the first year following transplantation [3]. Most of the 
infections have a bacterial etiology and they occur early after 
transplantation [4,5]. Infections in this patient population are 
notoriously difficult to diagnose because their usual signs and 
Purpose: Infection remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in liver transplantation (LT) recipients; however 
infection is notoriously difficult to diagnose because its usual signs and symptoms of infection may be masked or absent. 
This study comprises an analysis of bacterial infections in the early period after LT. 
Methods: This is a study of 129 adults who underwent LT from January 2013 to December 2013, and it includes patients 
who were followed daily from the day of transplantation to 1-week posttransplantation using bacteriological cultures of 
blood, urine, sputum, and drained ascites. 
Results: The following factors were significantly different between the positive and negative culture groups: living donor 
LT vs. deceased donor LT (odds ratio [OR], 3.269; P = 0.003), model for end-stage liver disease score (OR, 4.364; P < 0.001), 
and Child-Pugh classification (P = 0.007). Neither positive culture nor negative culture was associated with infection within 
4 weeks of surgery (P = 0.03), and most events were due to surgical complications (75%). 
Conclusion: Since the full effect of immunosuppression is not yet present during the first month after LT, we suggest that 
the number of bacterial culture test could be reduced such that they are performed every other day depending on patient’s 
situation.

symptoms, such as fever and leukocytosis, may be masked or 
absent. Mild infections are dangerous in immunosuppressed 
patients [6].
An investigation of the methods useful for early detection 
of hidden infections is needed. Kim et al. [7] reported that 
periodic microbiologic surveillance is useful for predicting 
posttransplantation pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection.
This study comprises an analysis of bacterial infections that 
occur during the early period after LT in adults. Laboratory 
culture tests were performed every day and the results were 
analyzed to determine if an analysis can improve the detection 
of early infections.
METHODS
This study included 129 adults who underwent LT from 
January 2013 to December 2013 at a single center institution. 
These patients had no symptoms or signs of infection before 
transplantation. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were 
collected from patients the day before transplantation, and 
there was no evidence of infection. Bacterial cultures were 
performed every day from the day of transplantation to 1 week 
after LT. Samples of blood, urine, sputum, and drained ascites 
were collected for culture and identification of the isolated 
microorganisms. Cultures and microorganism identification 
were conducted in accordance with standard microbiological 
procedures [8].
In this study, cultures harboring bacteria were identified as 
positive cultures, while cultures that did not contain bacteria 
were identified as negative cultures. In addition, after the 
operation, infection was defined as the occurrence of fever 
above 38°C, use of antibiotics, positive culture and a sudden 
increase in leukocyte count or C-reactive protein level to 2–3 
times the upper limit of normal.
Antimicrobial prophylaxis
All patients routinely received prophylaxis for antibacterial, 
protozoal, and fungal infections after LT. Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of cefotaxime (3 g/day, IV) 
and ampicillin/sulbactam (12 g/day, intravenous [IV]) for 3 
days. Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis consisted of 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (80 mg/400 mg, oral) from the 
time of the operation to 6 months after LT. To prevent fungal 
infections, itraconazole (100 mg, oral) was given twice a day for 
one month after LT.

Immunosuppression
In our center, immunosuppression was accomplished as 
previously described [9]. Basiliximab (20 mg) was used as an 
induction agent in all recipients during LT and on day 4 after LT. 
Patients were infused with prostaglandin E1, gabexate mesilate, 
and methylprednisolone. Maintenance immunosuppressive 
therapy consisted of corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Corticosteroids were withdrawn at 
3 months after transplantation. Tacrolimus treatment was 
initiated on postoperative day 3, and the optimal blood level 
was adjusted to maintain a trough plasma concentration of 10 
ng/mL during the first month (it was reduced to 5–8 ng/mL 
after the first month). Beginning on postoperative day one, 750 
mg of MMF was administered twice a day.
Statistical analysis
Student t-test was used to analyze continuous variables, and 
the chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to analyze 
categorical variables. We analyzed the risk factors linked with 
bacteremia by univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS ver. 12.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and P-values less than 0.05 were 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Among the 129 LT recipients, 99 (76.7%) were men and 30 
(23.3%) were women. Eighty-eight patients (68.2%) received 
living donor LT (LDLT), and 41 patients (31.8%) received 
deceased donor LT (DDLT). The model for end-stage liver 
disease (MELD) score of 87 patients (67.4%) was less than 20 
points, and the MELD score of 42 patients (32.6%) was more 
than 20 points. Forty-seven patients (36.4%) were classified 
as Child-Pugh Class A, 31 (24%) were B, and 51 (39.5%) were 
C. Thirty-five patients (27.1%) had positive cultures, and 94 
patients (72.9%) had negative cultures (Table 1). The following 
factors were significantly different between the positive and 
negative culture groups: LDLT vs. DDLT (odds ratio [OR], 3.269; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45–7.37; P = 0.003), MELD 
score (OR, 4.364; 95% CI, 1.92–9.93; P < 0.001), and Child-Pugh 
classification (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.22–6.00; P = 0.007). 
Of 129 patients, 30 patients had at least one positive preoperative blood, urine, and sputum culture, and 26 patients 
had antibiotics before the transplantation. Fourteen patients received LDLT and 16 patients received DDLT. The most common 
cause was spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in 11 patients 
followed by urinary tract infection in 3 patients, bacteremia in 
2 patients, pneumonia in 2 patients and other infections in 8 
patients. Fourteen had a negative culture for 1 week after LT, 
and 16 patients had a positive culture.
Table 2 shows the types of bacteria detected in positive cultures. More than 1 type of bacteria were detected in 1 patient.
Fig. 1 shows the number of positive culture samples. The 
results of blood, urine, sputum, and ascites culture performed 
for 1 week after LT are presented. Sputum culture was more

likely to be positive than any other kind of culture.
Fig. 2 shows the incidence (panel A) and proportion (panel 
B) of infections occurring up to 12 weeks after LT. In cultures 
performed within 1 week of LT, there was a statistically 
significant difference in the incidence rate between the positive 
culture group and the negative culture group at 1–2 weeks, but 
the occurrence of infection decreased within 4 weeks and the 
incidence increased again from 4 weeks to 12 weeks. Since 
patients are normally discharged after 3 weeks, it is not clear 
whether infections occurring after 4 weeks are linked with a 
positive culture obtained within the first week after LT. This is 
evident in Table 3. The incidence of infection at 4–12 weeks was 
higher in the positive culture group than the negative culture 
group (n = 12 [28.6%] vs. n = 10 [12.8%]), and most infections 
in both groups were associated with surgical complications (83% 
vs. 73%). Also, cholangitis caused by biliary stricture occurred 
more frequently in the negative culture group. 
DISCUSSION
In this study, statistically significant differences between 
the positive culture group and the negative culture group were 
noted in LDLT and DDLT, MELD score, and Child-Pugh classification. However, the number of patients with positive and 
negative cultures within the first week after transplantation 
did not affect the number of infections within 1 month. Even 
though bacteria were most commonly seen in sputum samples 
in this study, surgical complications (biliary stricture or bile 
leakage) were more common sources of infection than was 
pneumonia after 4 weeks. 
LT recipients are generally given immunosuppressants. Also, 
pretransplant conditions are variable and some factors cannot 
be controlled. Uncontrolled pretransplant variables such as 
underlying liver disease, lymphocyte mismatch, and a history 
of surgery may be associated with posttransplant conditions 
such as the presence of infectious and noninfectious diseases. 
These pre- and posttransplant conditions affect posttransplant 
management and length of stay in intensive care unit and 
hospital. A pretransplant MELD score of more than 25 was 
linked with patient and graft survival [10]. A high MELD score 
was indicative of a poor outcome. Our data revealed that 6 of 
the spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 2 of the bacteremia 
were detected preoperative culture in DDLT patient and that 
patients with positive cultures tended to have higher MELD 
scores than those with negative cultures. This, suggests that 
patients who receive DDLT and have a high MELD score are 
more susceptible to infection during the preoperative period 
and within the first week after LT.
Posttransplant infections occurring after 1 month of surgery 
are primarily attributable to surgical and technical complexity, 
wound infection, urinary tract infection, catheter-related infection, and pneumonia [11]. Opportunistic infections are generally 
uncommon during the early period after transplantation, since 
the full effect of immunosuppression is not reached surgeryrelated infection is most common in the early period after LT. 
Our data revealed that both the positive and negative culture

groups after LT experienced a gradual decrease in the number 
of infection events. Therefore, it is important to consider the 
number of cultures immediately after LT in patients without 
any evidence of pretransplantation infection. However, in patients with a high MELD score, who receive DDLT, and who 
develop infectious episodes in the pretransplant period, it is 
dangerous to reduce the number of serial culture tests for infection monitoring.
A limitation of our study is a retrospective study that included small number of LT patients. Another limitation of our 
study is that we could not identify the operational events and 
techniques that may have influenced surgical complications 
because of the retrospective nature of the study design. We also 
could not evaluate the biliary complexes in living donors compared to those in deceased donors. The biliary system could be 
a critical factor in biliary complications other than infection. A 
future large prospective study could provide more informative 
data.
In conclusion, we suggest reducing the number of culture 
tests performed in patients immediately after LT because full 
immune suppression is not reached and bacterial culture results 
at 1 week after LT are unlikely to be linked to infection. However, in patients with high MELD scores, who receive DDLT, 
or who have evidence of preoperative infection, the option 
of reducing the number of culture test should be seriously 
reconsidered.
