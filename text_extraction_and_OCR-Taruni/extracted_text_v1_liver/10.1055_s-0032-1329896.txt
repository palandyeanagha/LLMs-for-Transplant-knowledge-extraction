The development of the liver results from epithelial and
mesenchymal interactions connected to a network of early
embryonic and then fetal vessels, some of which later involute both inside and outside the liver1; the ductus venosus,
the last vessel to involute, normally disappears after a few
days in term neonates, and after a few weeks in premature
babies.2 The lack of complete involution of one or several of
these primordial vessels may give rise to abnormal vascular
communications between any vein of the portal system and
any vein of the inferior vena cava system; these communications may exist inside or outside the liver, may be single or
multiple, and vary in size. They can cause partial or complete
diversion of the portal blood to the systemic vessel and carry
risks of complications. They differ from the acquired intraand extrahepatic portosystemic shunts occurring as a consequence of portal hypertension. Over the past 30 years, there
has been an exponential increase in the number of children
with congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSSs) reported in the
English language literature (►Fig. 1). The present review is
based on the study of 265 such children aged 16 years or less
at the time of the first symptoms or diagnosis: 250 children
reported in the literature between 1979 and early 20123–140,
and 15 who were investigated at the Bicêtre Hospital since
our publication of 22 patients in 2010.118
Anatomy
It has been customary to classify CPSS into two categories,
extrahepatic and intrahepatic, respectively. Extrahepatic
shunts often called “Abernethy malformations” are further
classified into types 1 and 2 depending on the patency (type
2) or apparent lack of patency of the portal trunk and intrahepatic portal system.21,28 The type 1 extrahepatic CPSS,
sometimes called “congenital absence of the portal vein,”
was thought to require liver transplantation for a
cure,47,86,87,128 whereas type 2 extrahepatic CPSS was amenable to closure, surgically or by interventional radiology
procedures.132 On the other hand, intrahepatic CPSSs are
located inside the liver and were classified into four categories.141 Although useful to some extent, these classifications

Abstract Congenital portosystemic shunts are present in one in 30,000 children. Among the
associated risks of severe complications are neonatal cholestasis, benign and malignant
liver tumors, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, and encephalopathy. They can be detected on prenatal ultrasonograms, during the investigation of
a positive galactosemia screening test in neonates or of a complication, or be found
fortuitously on an abdominal ultrasound. Small intrahepatic shunts may resolve
spontaneously within one year of age, but other shunts such as extrahepatic, persistent
ductus venosus or persisting intrahepatic shunts, must be closed in one or two steps, by
interventional radiology techniques or surgically. The plasticity of the intrahepatic
portal system allows revascularization of the liver after shunt closure, even when no
intrahepatic portal structures can be detected on imaging studies. This leaves little or no
place for liver transplantation in the management of these children.

are no longer fully valid for several reasons: (1) intra- and
extrahepatic shunts carry the same risks of complications;
(2) the intrahepatic classification was described mostly in
adult patients with cirrhosis and may not be adapted to CPSSs
in children; (3) the classifications do not take into account the
persistence of the ductus venosus, a significant type of CPSS
that cannot fit into an intra- or extrahepatic category;
(4) there have been reports in which both extra- and intrahepatic shunts were present in the same child57,110,118; and
(5) as far as extrahepatic shunts are concerned, assessment of
the patency of the portal trunk and of its intrahepatic
branches may give different results depending on the imaging
technique29,70,123,136; (6) successful portal revascularization
of the liver has been reported after closure of the shunt in
children in whom no portal vein had been seen, either during
surgical examination or on an angiogram during an occlusion
test, thus clearly showing the plasticity of the intrahepatic
portal system.44,76,118 Consequently, the term “congenital
absence of the portal vein” is misleading. Based on the results
of imaging studies, we suggest that the PSSs be classified
anatomically, taking the following into account: the part of
the portal system where the shunt originates, including the
afferent veins of the portal trunk (e.g., the splenic or superior
mesenteric vein), the portal trunk itself, or intrahepatic
branches; the systemic vein of termination of the shunt
and the ductus venosus; the type of communication with
the systemic vein (end-to-side versus side-to-side); and the
number of communications (single vs multiple). The respective anatomic types of CPSS reported in the pediatric literature are indicated in ►Table 1.
Liver Pathology
The liver is usually small, and amounts to 45 to 65% of the
estimated standard volume for age.54,134 In children with socalled congenital absence of the portal vein, direct examination of the extrahepatic portal system during surgery or of the
explanted liver at transplantation or autopsy, either did
not show any portal venous structure or remnants3,4,61,82,86,87,93,125 or showed vestigial fibrous remnants
of the portal trunk at the porta hepatis,7,8,67,129 and sometimes showed a patent portal bifurcation with a break after
the emergence of the right and left portal branches58,90; this
does not preclude the presence and plasticity of the intrahepatic portal system: A detailed study of the liver of a child
with a type 1 Abernethy malformation reports the presence
of small caliber portal veins in the large portal tracts although
no portal vein was found in the hilum142; this explains why
closure of the shunt may revascularize the intrahepatic portal
system, possibly through a small portal cavernoma probably
developed from the peribiliary plexus and without significant
portal hypertension.118
Liver histology, described in 62 children, was reported as
normal in 16 children, as a fatty liver with no or little portal
fibrosis in six children, and as a pattern reminiscent of
hepatoportal sclerosis in 40: Minimal or moderate portal
fibrosis, absent or hypoplastic portal vein branches in the
portal tracts, large arterial branches with sometimes a thickened wall, portal and periportal proliferation of thin vascular,
capillary, or lymphatic structures, and in one instance, slight
ductular proliferation. Perisinusoidal fibrosis or early-stage
nodular regeneration was sometimes present. This pattern is
similar to the one described in rats and is probably the
consequence of portal blood deprivation.143
Prevalence and Possible Mechanisms
Two studies use the results of neonatal screening for galactosemia after a few days of feeding to estimate the prevalence of
congenital portosystemic shunts144,145: High concentrations
of blood galactose, unexplained by an abnormal activity of the
enzymes of galactose metabolism, can be found in neonates

with CPSS because galactose from milk bypasses the liver. The
overall prevalence is close to 1:30,000 births and the prevalence of permanent CPSS can be estimated at 1:50,000.
Possible clues to the understanding of the development of
congenital portosystemic shunts include the following: (1) A
genetic origin—of the 265 children who form the basis of this
review, 11 had Down syndrome and 13 had another genetically defined disease or syndrome; all the anatomic types of
shunts were found in these children. In addition a persistent
ductus venosus was found in siblings in five families including
three pairs of twins.27,84,94,96,119 (2) A complex congenital
malformative process—various abnormalities of the kidneys,
bile ducts (including biliary atresia), digestive system, bones,
and brain have been recorded, but a congenital heart disease
is the most frequent, as it was combined with a CPSS in 45 of
the 265 studied, in most cases with shunts originating or
ending outside the liver.37 A polysplenia syndrome with
azygous continuation of the inferior vena cava was present
in 23 children, all with CPSS originating and ending outside
the liver; indeed a recent study of children with the polysplenia syndrome reports the presence of a CPSS in at least 8%
of cases.146 (3) The absence of ductus venosus during fetal
life—occlusion or agenesis of the ductus venosus may be
associated with the presence of abnormal vessels that allow
the oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein to reach the
fetal heart. Some of these vessels may persist, present as CPSS
and may be combined with extreme hypoplasia of the portal
venous system.147–149 In a few such children, the development of the CPSS was followed from the fetal to the postnatal
stage.107,147 Absence of ductus venosus was in fact recorded
in a few children reported for CPSS.7,42,62,63,73,107,118 (4) A
hemangioma of the liver—intrahepatic communications between branches of the portal vein and hepatic veins may be
present in liver hemangiomas in early infancy; a few of them
may persist while the hemangiomas regress and may present
as intrahepatic shunts later in life.68,118,134,145
Clinical Presentation and Investigation
Of the 265 children included in this review, their gender was
reported in 255 cases; there were 113 girls and 142 boys.
There was a female predominance in children with extrahepatic shunts, reported as type 1 Abernethy malformation (sex
ratio: 0.57), and a male predominance in children with
persistent ductus venosus (sex ratio: 2.6). Presenting symptoms are indicated in ►Table 2.
At the time of diagnosis, besides the possible signs of
associated conditions or complications, the liver was not
reported to be enlarged; a large number of cutaneous angiomas were reported in 10 children. Splenomegaly was recorded
in five children with no patent signs of portal hypertension,
excluding the children with biliary atresia. Serum alanine
aminotransferase activity was above normal in 48 of 115
children tested (median value: 1.5  N; range 1.1–11  N),
serum γ-glutamyltransferase activity was above normal in 25
of 50 children reported (median value: 3  N; range 1.5–
15  N), prolonged prothrombin time was reported in 31 of
77 children tested, and the serum albumin concentration was
below 35 g/L in 14 of the 35 tested. High ammonemia was
reported in 123 of 156 children (median: 2  N; range 1.1–
10  N), and high total serum bile acid concentration in 76 of
78 children. Note that one of the two normal bile acids values
was recorded in a child with polysplenia syndrome before the
Fontan operation, whose blood was flowing through the shunt
from the systemic to the portal vein.81
Doppler ultrasonography (US) is the key imaging modality
for the diagnosis, monitoring during the therapeutic procedure, and follow-up of CPSS (►Figs. 2, 3). In all types of CPSS,
the portal and /or hepatic veins anatomy is modified and is
the first obvious finding. Shunts joining a portal branch to a
hepatic vein or the ductus venosus are easily diagnosed from
the enlargement and in some cases tortuosity of both communicating vessels. The hypoplasia of the other portal

branches or their reversed flow is indicative of the size of the
shunt. Compensatory dilatation of the hepatic artery may be
misleading by indicating a more complex arteriovenous
malformation, but the continuous venous flow in the communicating veins helps to reach the correct diagnosis. Shunts
joining the main portal vein to the inferior vena cava, end-toside or side-to-side, may be more difficult to assess, as in most
of the cases there is decreased liver size, sometimes with
dysmorphy. The main finding is the nonvisibility of the
intrahepatic portal branches that often appear as hyperechoic
bands surrounded by hypoechoic stripes, thus giving the
portal space a layered appearance (►Fig. 3). Portal flow
may be slow or even absent, and arterial signal is the
predominant recorded flow in the portal space. Side to-side
shunts usually present with ectasia of the portal vein at the
level of the shunt. Liver tumors may sometimes mask the
causal CPSS. Shunts joining afferent branches of the portal
vein (i.e., the splenic or mesenteric veins) to the infrahepatic
inferior vena cava or its affluent (the renal or iliac vein) may
also be difficult to detect by Doppler US, as they are far from
the liver, and only the effect of the diversion of the portal flow
to the portal vein and its branches and the hyperarterialization of the liver may be observed.
Multidetector computed tomography (CT) with contrast
injection is the next imaging modality to perform, to further
document the anatomy and location of the shunt (►Figs. 2,3).
Together with maximum intensity projection and multiplanar reconstruction, it provides all the necessary information
about the course of the shunt, its size, and orientation; it helps
to define the best therapeutic option and access route for
radiologists or surgeons. It is also useful for the detection of
complicating liver tumors.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen can
also visualize the shunt, but is often less informative in small
children than multidetector CT because of motion artifacts.
However, its main indication is the evaluation of associated
liver tumors, which present with variable signal intensity on
T1- and T2-weighted images and variable contrast enhancement. Characterization of these lesions is difficult and biopsy
is needed for diagnosis.
Angiography is performed either as an attempt to close the
shunt percutaneously, or to detect the nonvisible portal vein
and its intrahepatic branches and thus to provide arguments
for closure in one step or more progressively in two steps.
When portal branches are not visible on the initial opacification of the shunt, the occlusion test with a balloon occlusion
catheter placed in the shunt, or in the inferior vena cava at the
level of the shunt, is essential (►Fig. 3). It helps to calibrate
the venous communication, which is always more distensible
than is thought, and shows the presence and location of the
portal vein and the degree of hypoplasia of the intrahepatic
portal branches. Portal pressure measurement is recorded
before and after occlusion to evaluate the tolerance of the
closure of the shunt.
The results of tests of radiologic or surgical occlusion of the
shunt were reported in the literature in 70 children, including
measurement of portal pressure in 59 and angiography in 30.
Occlusion portal pressures were below 20 mm Hg in 23

regression was observed at one year of age. (B) Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with coronal reconstruction shows a patent ductus

(E) Angiogram showing direct communication between the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and the right iliac vein (RIV). The catheter was inserted
via a transjugular access and its tip (arrow) was placed into the SMV via the following pathway: IVC-RIV-IMV-splenic vein (SV)-SMV. The MPV
and intrahepatic branches are well seen. Closure was performed by interventional radiology.

children, between 20 and 29 in 20 children and 30 mm Hg or
more (range 30–45) in 16. The increase in pressure was
reported to be transient in three children, returning to values
below 20 mm Hg within a few minutes to an hour of occlusion. An intrahepatic portal system, often very hypoplastic,
was seen on angiograms in 26 out of 30 children, including 10
out of 12, whose occlusion portal pressure was between 30
and 45 mm Hg.
Per-rectal scintigraphy allows quantification of the
shunt.150 The shunt ratios reported in the literature in 39
children range from 29 to 99% (median: 55%); the shunt ratio
is significantly related to the level of ammonemia
(p ¼ 0.0009; Student’s t test) and to the presence of clinical
signs of encephalopathy (p ¼ 0.0062; Fisher’s exact test).
Brain MRI may reveal high signals of the globus pallidus
bilaterally (►Fig. 3) and also of the antehypophysis on
T1-weighted images and proton MR spectroscopy abnormalities have also been reported. High signals of the globus
pallidus, initially described in adult patients with cirrhosis
and portal systemic encephalopathy,151 were later related to
the degree of portal systemic shunting rather than the degree
of liver failure,152 and are thought to reflect the presence of
manganese deposits in the basal ganglia.153 The results of
brain MRI were reported in 42 children with various anatomic
types of CPSS: High signals of the globus pallidus were found
in 35 children aged 18 months to 18 years, could be seen in
children with no clinical signs of encephalopathy, and
were associated with high blood manganese
concentrations.33,54,111,154
Outcome
Some small intrahepatic portosystemic shunts located between the portal branches and hepatic veins disappear
spontaneously by age 1 to 2 years,155 but others, mostly the
large shunts as well as the communications involving the
extrahepatic portal veins and ductus venosus, persist
throughout life and carry risks of complications. In the

visibility of the intrahepatic portal branches with a layered appearance of portal spaces consisting of hyperechoic bands surrounded by
hypoechoic stripes (white arrow). Note that the lumen of the left portal branch is not seen (star). (B) Computed tomography with contrast
injection and sagittal reconstruction shows direct end-to-side communication between the confluence of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and
the splenic vein on one side and the inferior vena cava (IVC) on the other. The dotted circle shows the position of the balloon in the IVC during
occlusion test. (C) Occlusion test with injection in the SMV reveals the unexpected presence of an ectopic main portal vein (MPV) arising
from a pancreatic vein (PV) with hypoplastic intrahepatic portal branches. (D) Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed before closure
of the shunt shows on T1-weighted images a high signal intensity in the pallidi (arrows). Surgical closure of the shunt was performed in one step.
(E) Three months later, US showed the patency of the left portal branch (star) and its branches (arrow). (F) One year later, brain MRI showed the
disappearance of the abnormal high signal intensity in the pallidi (arrows). Dramatic clinical improvement of the girl’s behavior occurred
early after closure.

population of children reviewed for this study, spontaneous
shunt disappearance was observed in 14 children: In 12 of
them, the shunt was located between an intrahepatic portal
branch and a hepatic vein; in one, between the portal
bifurcation and the inferior vena cava, and in one it was
described as a persistent ductus venosus.138 Although an
unknown proportion of CPSS may remain clinically silent
for decades,156 many complications can occur in childhood
(►Fig. 4).
Neonatal Cholestasis
Twenty-four infants reported to have a neonatal cholestasis of
an unknown cause also presented with a CPSS; they included
all the anatomic types.15,28,38,48,63,74,103,107,118,138 In 10
cases, the shunt was found during the investigation of jaundice; in the other 14, it was identified by a galactosemia
screening test, a prenatal ultrasonographic examination, or
the investigation of a congenital heart disease. Intrauterine
growth retardation was present in nine of 18 children whose
birth weight and term were reported; premature birth was
recorded in five of 19 children. Significant signs were thrombocytopenia in five children, prolonged prothrombin time
despite parenteral vitamin K administration in eight children
and lasting hypoglycemia in five of the eight in whom
glycemia was reported. Stool discoloration was absent or
transient in all six children in whom it was reported. Spontaneous resolution of jaundice occurred in 16 survivors. One
may postulate that the presence of a shunt reduces the
perfusion of the neonatal liver, a factor known to enhance
the risk of cholestasis in neonates. The search for a shunt
should be part of the investigation of a child with neonatal
cholestasis, but its presence should not preclude the search
for other causes of neonatal cholestasis, including biliary
atresia, which is sometimes combined with a shunt, mostly
with polysplenia,9,21,28,48,61,102,103 and respiratory chain disorders or adrenal insufficiency, which may present with
hypoglycemia. In view of the good prognosis for this type
of anoxoischemic cholestasis, early closure of the shunt is not
necessary, but closure should be considered later if the shunt
does not regress spontaneously.
Liver Tumors
Liver tumors have been reported in 64 children at a
median age of 8 years (range 3 months–18
years).3–6,8,14,17,18,20,25,30,39,43,49,50,53,54,60,61,65,68,70,75,79,83
85,89,90,92,93,103,109,114,118,123,124,128,132,134,135,137 They were
multiple in 38 children and single in 26. Tumor histology was
reported in 38 children and included adenoma in seven
children, focal nodular hyperplasia in 16, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia or “regenerative nodules” in 11. Seven
malignant tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, or sarcoma)3–6,17,61,93,118 were recorded, including
two children in whom the malignant tumor occurred several
years after the diagnosis of an adenoma or of a nodular
regenerative hyperplasia.4,5,118 All anatomic types of CPSS
were combined with liver tumors, but the malignant ones
were combined with extrahepatic shunts. In 27 instances, the
shunt was fortuitously diagnosed together with the tumor.
The results of surgical or radiologic closure of the shunt
without resection of the tumor were available for 21 children
with a benign lesion (mean follow-up: 2½ years; range
4 months–8 years): The disappearance or significant regression of the tumor was recorded in each case, even for very
large tumors and for one patient in whom no portal vein was
visible on the angiogram during an occlusion test.118 Whereas malignant tumors require resection, these results strongly
suggest that closure of the shunt allows regression of benign
tumors.
Pulmonary Arteriovenous Shunting
(Hepatopulmonary Syndrome)
Chronic hypoxemia with clinical characteristics similar to

all anatomic types of CPSS and led to the diagnosis of CPSS in
29 instances. Hepatopulmonary syndrome was a complication in 10 (none with biliary atresia) of the 23 children with
CPSS and polysplenia syndrome and in 22 of the 242 children
without polysplenia syndrome (p < 0.0001; Fisher’s exact
test). Children with CPSS and polysplenia presented with
hypoxemia at a younger age (3 months–2 years; mean: 1 year)
than children without polysplenia (1 year–11 years; mean:
5½ years; p < 0.0001, unpaired Student’s t test). Six of the
children reported in the literature did not undergo any
treatment; follow-up was available for three: One died of a
brain abscess 6 months after diagnosis, one presented with
pulmonary hypertension and is alive after a follow-up of
8 years, and one has stable hypoxemia after 1 year. Eight
children underwent liver transplantation; follow-up is available for seven and shows full regression of hypoxemia
1 month to 1 year after transplantation. Nineteen children
underwent surgical or radiologic closure of the CPSS in one or
two steps: full regression of hypoxemia was observed in all
but one child (range up to 10 years; mean: 2); in this child,
pulmonary arteriography showed the persistence of pulmonary arteriovenous shunts that are considered to be associated arteriovenous malformations118; in another child, the
emergence of additional portosystemic shunts was complicated by pulmonary hypertension 4 years after the regression
of hypoxemia.78,110 These results indicate that CPSS may be
present in children with unexplained hypoxemia and pulmonary arteriovenous shunting and that closure of the CPSS
cures hypoxemia in virtually all cases, but requires careful
follow-up. In addition, one must mention two reports of
hepatopulmonary syndrome disclosing a previously unknown CPSS 8 months and 8 years, respectively, after liver
transplantation for biliary atresia and the polysplenia syndrome.136,157 Search for a congenital portosystemic shunt is
recommended in children with biliary atresia, polysplenia
and hepatopulmonary syndrome and closure of the shunt
might be considered in lieu of transplantation whenever
possible.
Pulmonary Hypertension
Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in 30 children
at ages ranging from the neonatal period to 15 years (mean:
5 years 4 months) with all anatomic types of
shunt.24,35,42,50,51,58,61,99,101,107,109,110,114,118,127,129,130,133,138
Signs of pulmonary hypertension were the occasion of the
diagnosis of CPSS in 19 instances, and consisted of dyspnea,
fainting, screening by clinical examination or echocardiography,
or rapid right heart failure leading to death. The latter was
observed in two children aged 12 and 20 months, who had
extrahepatic shunts.58,130 There was a link between pulmonary
hypertension and hepatopulmonary syndrome in five instances: in two children hepatopulmonary syndrome was followed
by pulmonary hypertension after 3 to 4 years. In the other three
children, the simultaneous presence of hepatopulmonary syndrome and pulmonary hypertension was reported, but the
results of right heart catheterizations were not mentioned.
Fifteen children fulfilled the criteria defined for portopulmonary hypertension158: In two, postmortem study showed lesions of plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy,58,130 and in 13, the
results of right heart catheterization showed elevated pulmonary resistances ranging from 5 to 38 wood units-m2 (median:
7).51,101,118,133 ►Table 3 indicates the outcome for these children: Six children died and pulmonary arterial pressures and
resistances did not return to normal values after treatment in
survivors. These ominous results indicate that CPSS must be
searched for in children who present with unexplained pulmonary hypertension, and that conversely, scrupulous care is
mandatory in children with CPSS to detect the emergence of
pulmonary hypertension early, even in very young children, to
provide the child with the best chances of regression after early
closure before the development of irreversible pulmonary
vascular lesions.
Encephalopathy
Neurologic abnormalities were reported in 64 children with a
CPSS, excluding patients with biliary atresia and portal
systemic encephalopathy.4,5,11,13,16,17,24,27,31,34,35,39,41,43,45,

135,136,138 Because of the malformations, past medical histories and genetic syndromes sometimes associated with the
CPSS, it is not always easy to attribute an abnormal neurologic
sign to the possible consequence of portal systemic encephalopathy and/or to the brain toxicity of ammonia and manganese. The reported abnormalities can be divided into three
main categories: (1) clear-cut signs of portal systemic encephalopathy, including intermittent episodes of lethargy or
confusion after meals, or abnormal or bizarre behavior sometimes combined with irritability, agitation, or disorientation,
slow waves on electroencephalograms (EEGs) and extrapyramidal signs on neurologic examination; (2) speech delay,
mental retardation, sometimes combined with seizures;
and (3) difficulties at school, behavioral problems and attention hyperactivity disorders in older children. The neurologic
symptoms were observed at all ages, could be observed with
all anatomic types of shunt and may be related to the
magnitude of the shunt as measured by per-rectal scintigraphy (see above). Raised ammonemia was present in all but
three children and high signal intensity in the globus pallidus
on brain MRI was present in 15 of 18 children studied. Closure
of the shunt or liver transplantation was performed in 46
children. Follow-up information was available for 28 children: Full regression of neurologic symptoms was observed
in seven children, significant subjective improvement was
noted by the parents in 18, including one child whose seizures
disappeared, and no modification was noted in three children. Ammonemia levels were normal in all 24 children
tested after closure of the shunt. High signal intensity in
the globus pallidus disappeared in all six children studied
3 months to 3 years (mean: 1 year 5 months) after shunt
closure. These data suggest that abnormal neurologic symptoms or behavior, as well as school difficulties, especially
when combined with high ammonemia, abnormal brain MRI,
and improvement after closure of the shunt, could be the
consequence of portal systemic encephalopathy and can be
used as an argument for closure of the shunt.
Other Complications
Other complications have been reported in a few children that
might be consequences of the CPSS: They include heart
failure,7,32,48,84,118 membranoproliferative glomerulopathy,45,118,131,135 hypoglycemia,53,55,77,134 hyperandrogenism,43,52 pancreatitis,101 rectal or vaginal
bleeding,43,67,105,132 autoimmune diseases,64,77,99,101 protein-losing gastropathy,35,132 unforeseen bleeding during
surgery for scoliosis,117 and acute lethal liver failure during
an episode of gastroenteritis in a 1.7-year-old boy with an
extrahepatic shunt.54
Hypoxemia due to pulmonary arteriovenous shunting,
pulmonary artery hypertension, encephalopathy with hyperammonemia, and glomerulopathy are known complications
of cirrhosis, and their occurrence in children with congenital
portosystemic shunts and minimal liver histologic lesions
argues in support of the major role of communications
between the portal blood and the systemic circulation in
the origin of these conditions. The high incidence of liver
tumors or nodules, whether benign or malignant, in children
with congenital portosystemic shunts is reminiscent of what
was described in some strains of rats159 and strengthens the
concept of a portal deprivation syndrome in which abnormal
portal venous flux results in the production of liver nodules of
various kinds, as suggested to occur in patients with hepatoportal sclerosis, focal nodular hyperplasia, and focal regenerative hyperplasia, as well as in patients with portal vein
obstruction after a surgical portosystemic shunt.
In all, with a follow-up ranging from 0 to 20 years, 19 of the
265 children included in this review died, nine possibly of
causes unrelated to the CPSS and 10 of causes very likely to be
the consequence of the shunts, one each of brain abscess with
hepatopulmonary syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma or
acute liver failure, and seven children with pulmonary
hypertension.
Management
Whenever a CPSS is found in a child, either during the
investigation of a complication, during the neonatal period,
or later as a fortuitous finding, one has first to make sure that
the shunt is not the consequence of portal hypertension, or
during early infancy, of a liver hemangioma that would
require a specific treatment. Once the congenital and isolated
nature of the shunt has been ascertained, the recommended
investigations are indicated on ►Table 4.

Because of the severity of its complications, closure of a
congenital portosystemic shunt is necessary.
Techniques for Closure
As a general rule, percutaneous closure can be performed
when an occlusive device can be fixed in position in the shunt,
without compromising the development of the portal
branches, the flow in the inferior vena cava and the normal
hepatic veins and also the venous drainage of the other organs
such as the spleen and kidneys. This therapeutic option applies
to shunts between portal branches and hepatic veins that can
be closed by means of Amplatzer devices or coils, depending on
the size and number of communications. A patent ductus
venosus can be successfully managed in this way, except
when it is too wide or short to safely block the device in its
lumen, in which case surgery must be undertaken. Shunts
joining a splenic or mesenteric vein to an affluent of the
inferior vena cava such as a renal vein or an iliac vein can
also be easily closed percutaneously when they consist of endto-side communications. On the other hand, when the shunt is
side-to-side, surgery is certainly preferable, at least in young
children, to the placement of a covered stent in the lumen of
the efferent vessel, as the latter option would require lifelong
anticoagulation treatment and would probably become inadequate in size with growth. For the same reasons, side-to-side
shunts between the main portal vein and the inferior vena cava
are also indications for surgery, usually performed in one step.
On the contrary, end-to-side shunts between the main portal
vein and the inferior vena cava usually require a two-step
surgical procedure to avoid acute severe portal hypertension.
Figure 5 A schematic proposal for the management in a child with congenital portosystemic shunt. (*with the exception of an early
complication, other than cholestasis, that requires closure of the shunt; **no precise cut-off value of occlusion portal pressure can be given to
decide upon closure in one or two stages, but by and large, a stable occlusion portal pressure above 32 mm Hg should lead to the consideration of
a two-stage procedure, especially if no portal vein is visible on the occlusion angiogram. During surgery, the most important point is the
tolerance of the small bowel during the occlusion (see text).

The first step, consisting of banding of the shunt, allows the
intrahepatic portal branches to progressively develop through
a cavernomatous hepatopetal network. Complete closure a few
months later can then be performed without significant portal
hypertension. In complex forms of shunt, successive radiologic
and surgical procedures are required to tailor the best therapeutic option for the closure of single or multiple shunts and
finally to avoid liver transplantation.
Surgical closure of the shunt is indicated in patients considered unsuitable for endoluminal closure. The rules of this
surgery are as follows: (1) The shunt must be occluded as close
as possible to the caval system to preserve the maximal
number of intrahepatic portal branches; (2) the occlusion
must be checked to see that it does not result in excessive
portal pressure and/or in small bowel cyanosis and edema; and
(3) the thrombosis of blind portal segments must be prevented. The site of occlusion should be chosen after a careful
multidisciplinary work-up. The details of the surgical approach
(open, or rarely, laparoscopic, mobilization of liver, etc.) are
planned according to the route of the shunt. Intraoperative
monitoring of portal blood pressure during a 15-minute
clamping test is strongly recommended. In case of good bowel
tolerance, closure of the shunt may be achieved as a one-stage
procedure by ligation, placement of clips or caval partition. In
case of poor tolerance, a two-stage procedure is necessary, i.e.,
banding of the shunt followed by delayed closure after enlargement of intrahepatic portal vessels, sometimes after
development of a portal network.34,44,118 Heparin is given
before clamping and continued for one to several weeks,
depending on the promptness of intrahepatic portal enlargement and on the possible formation of blood clots in blind
segments. Shunt disappearance and development of intrahepatic portal branches are assessed by repeat Doppler US
sonography, and by CT or MRI angiogram when necessary.
After closure of the shunt, the abnormalities shown by
liver tests and coagulation studies regress. Ammonemia
returns to normal within a day and serum bile acids are again
normal after a few days.71,97 Careful follow-up is necessary
for several years to check for the regression of complications
when present, for long-term management of persistent complications such as pulmonary hypertension, and to detect the
possible emergence of an additional shunt that would require
additional closure108,118; the latter is best detected by a
combination of abdominal ultrasonography and assay for
serum bile acids concentration.
Indications for Closure
With the exception of neonatal cholestasis, which resolves
spontaneously, closure of the shunt is mandatory whenever a
complication is present (►Fig. 5).118 When no complication is
detected, closure of the shunt can be postponed in cases of a
small intrahepatic shunt (i.e., between a branch of the portal
vein and a hepatic vein) found in early infancy because there
is a reasonable hope of spontaneous shunt regression during
the first year. In all other cases, closure of the shunt should be
considered early, to prevent complications from occurring, for
four reasons: (1) hepatopulmonary syndrome and pulmonary hypertension may be present during the very first years
of life; (2) the regression of pulmonary hypertension cannot
be ascertained once irreversible lesions of the pulmonary
arteries are present; (3) chronic hyperammonemia and high
blood levels of manganese have adverse effects on the developing brain160,161; and (4) the plasticity of the intrahepatic
portal system may be better in younger children.121 The
plasticity of the intrahepatic portal system will allow revascularization of the liver even when the intrahepatic portal
system is not detectable on imaging studies and when portal
pressure is high during an occlusion test. The experience
gained over the past 15 years indicates that there is very little
place left, if any, for liver transplantation in the management
of congenital portosystemic shunts in children.
