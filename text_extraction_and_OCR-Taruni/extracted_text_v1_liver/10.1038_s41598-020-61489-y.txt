Prolonged exposure to hyperoxia has deleterious efects on the lung, provoking both infammation and 
alveolar injury. The elements of hyperoxic injury, which result in high rates of lethality in experimental 
models, are thought to include multicellular immune responses. To characterize these alterations 
in immune cell populations, we performed time-of-fight mass cytometry (CyTOF) analysis of CD45-
expressing immune cells in whole lung parenchyma and the bronchoalveolar space of mice, exposed to 
48hours of hyperoxia together with normoxic controls. At the tested time point, hyperoxia exposure 
resulted in decreased abundance of immunoregulatory populations (regulatory B cells, myeloid 
regulatory cells) in lung parenchyma and markedly decreased proliferation rates of myeloid regulatory 
cells, monocytes and alveolar macrophages. Additionally, hyperoxia caused a shift in the phenotype 
of alveolar macrophages, increasing proportion of cells with elevated CD68, CD44, CD11c, PD-L1, 
and CD205 expression levels. These changes occurred in the absence of histologically evident alveolar 
damage and abundance of neutrophils in the parenchyma or alveolar space did not change at these time 
points. Collectively, these fndings demonstrate that pulmonary response to hyperoxia involves marked 
changes in specifc subsets of myeloid and lymphoid populations. These fndings have important 
implications for therapeutic targeting in acute lung injury.
Administration of supplemental oxygen is likely the most common medical intervention in critical care. High 
concentrations of inspired oxygen (up to 100%) are ofen administered to patients during thoracic and cardiac 
surgery and to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in order to achieve adequate 
oxygenation. However, it is now recognized that hyperoxia may have deleterious consequences by promoting 
infammation, acute lung injury and impairing anti-microbial immunity1–10. Recent data also suggest that hyperoxia increases mortality of mechanically ventilated patients and patients with ARDS11,12.
Pulmonary responses to hyperoxia likely involve multiple immune cell populations. Separate studies have 
reported that hyperoxia inhibits macrophage proliferation13,14, heightens the ratio of F4/80lowCD206low (proinfammatory, “M1”) to F4/80highCD206high (anti-infammatory, “M2”) alveolar macrophages15, and promotes infux 
of CD11bhighCD11clow cells (“infammatory monocytes”) and CD11bhighCD11chigh macrophages (“exudative macrophages”) into the bronchoalveolar space16. Increased infltration of parenchyma by invariant NKT cells17 and 
late recruitment of neutrophils18 have also been described. However, an integrative analysis of changes across all 
immune populations of the lung has not yet been undertaken.
To address this gap and develop further potential therapeutic targets, we used time-of-fight mass cytometry 
(CyTOF)19 to deeply phenotype immune cells in lung parenchyma and bronchoalveolar space of mice breathing room air and mice exposed to 48 hours of hyperoxia. At this early experimental time point, the exudative

injurious phase of hyperoxic lung injury has not yet developed20,21 and in keeping with this, there was no histologic evidence of alveolar damage.
Te systems immunology approach utilizing CyTOF allowed us to describe early immune cell compositional 
changes in the lung during hyperoxia. Characteristics of immune subsets (abundance, proliferation, phenotype) were contrasted between normoxia and hyperoxia using appropriate systems biology algorithms (viSNE, 
CITRUS)22–25; as well as traditional biaxial manual gating approaches. Te innovative high-dimensional analysis 
revealed heterogeneous in vivo reactions of alveolar macrophages, parenchymal B cells, myeloid regulatory cells 
and other subsets with a less defnitive lineage specifcation. Collectively, our fndings illustrate the complexity 
of early immune-modulatory efects of hyperoxia and potentially have therapeutic implications for specifc cell 
targeting in acute lung injury.
Results
viSNE analysis delineates immune cell composition of the lungs during normoxia and hyperoxia. Immune cells were isolated from whole lung parenchyma, and in the independent experiment, from 
bronchoalveolar lavage fuid (BALF) of C57BL/6 mice breathing room air (FiO2=21%) and mice exposed to 
48 hours of hyperoxia (FiO2>95%). At this early experimental time-point, there was no histologic evidence of 
lung parenchymal damage (Fig. S1). Single-cell suspensions were stained with a panel of 36 metal isotope-tagged 
monoclonal antibodies (Table S1). Multi-dimensional data were acquired by time-of-fight mass cytometry and 
analyzed with viSNE (visualization of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) algorithm. Live CD45+
immune cells for analysis were identifed by a sequence of gating steps (Fig. S2). ViSNE analysis was run on equal 
numbers of events per each sample and data were pooled to generate fnal 2-dimensional density plots (Fig. 1). In 
tSNE plots, immune cells are clustered based on their phenotypic similarity. Tis unbiased analysis identifed 9 
major clusters in lung parenchyma (Fig. 1A; clusters 1–5 representing myeloid cells and 6–9 lymphoid cells) and 
5 major clusters in the bronchoalveolar space (Fig. 1B; clusters 1–3 representing myeloid cells and 4–5 lymphoid 
cells). Te immune lineage of clusters was determined based on their distinct expression pattern of surface and 
intracellular markers, further validated by overlays of manually gated populations on tSNE plots (Figs. S3 and S4). 
Te same numbers of major immune clusters were identifed in lungs and BALF during normoxia and hyperoxia. 
BALF data revealed that there was no infltration of neutrophils into the alveolar space at this early time-point. 
However, we note that distribution of several density clusters (e.g., alveolar macrophages, B cells) in relation to 
tSNE1 and tSNE2 axis was shifed during hyperoxia, indicating multicellular immune responses. We next sought 
to further characterize specifc changes in these immune cell clusters induced by hyperoxia.
Lung response to hyperoxia involves specifc lymphoid and myeloid subsets. We frst compared frequencies (% CD45+cells) of major immune cell subsets as defned by manual gating strategy between 
normoxia and hyperoxia. Te absolute cell numbers within immune populations are reported in Fig. S6. Tis 
approach identifed signifcant reduction of a distinct immune cell population with a myeloid regulatory cell phenotype (CD172a+CD11bhi CD11clo Ly6C+Ly6G−Siglec-F+F4/80+CD39+) in lung parenchyma (Fig. 2), a 
change further evident in tSNE plots from two independent experiments (Fig. S5).
To further explore whether abundance of other smaller subpopulations (not primarily identifed by biaxial 
manual gating strategy) difers between normoxia and hyperoxia, we utilized an unbiased CITRUS (cluster identifcation, characterization, and regression) analysis of whole lung CD45+cells. Signifcance analysis of microarrays (SAM) association model was selected. When applying the most stringent statistical cutof of 0.01 FDR (false 
discovery rate), CITRUS analysis identifed 6 clusters of interest which distinguished normoxic and hyperoxic 
lungs (Fig. 3A). We next determined the phenotypic identity of these 6 clusters identifed by CITRUS (Fig. 3B,C).
Clusters 1–3 were interpreted as B cells by their expression of CD19 and MHCII. Cluster 3 additionally 
expressed higher levels of PD-L1 and CD69 consistent with regulatory B cell phenotype. Cluster 1 (Sca-1lo) 
was increased, while clusters 2 and 3 (both Sca-1hi) were decreased in hyperoxia (cluster 3 most signifcantly). 
Signifcant reduction of regulatory B cells was further evident in tSNE plots from two independent experiments 
(Fig. S7). Clusters 4 and 5 were interpreted as alveolar macrophages by their high expression of CD68 and 
Siglec-F. Cluster 4, which was signifcantly increased in hyperoxia, expressed higher levels of CX3CR1, PD-L1, 
CD205 and TLR2 as compared to cluster 5. Te abundance of cluster 5 alveolar macrophages was decreased 
in hyperoxia. Cluster 6, which was signifcantly increased, did not exhibit defnitive lineage specifcation (low 
expression of CD3, NK1.1, CD49b and CD11b). Signifcant diferences in the frequencies (% CD45+cells) of the 
6 clusters during normoxia and hyperoxia were additionally confrmed using unpaired t-test (Fig. S8).
We next analyzed ki67 protein expression to compare proliferation rate of major nine immune cell clusters in 
the lungs during normoxia and hyperoxia. We found a signifcantly reduced proliferation rate of myeloid regulatory cells, monocytes and alveolar macrophages during hyperoxia, while proliferation rates of other populations 
did not change signifcantly (Fig. 4).
Hyperoxia promotes an aberrant macrophage phenotype in the alveolar space. Given the complex changes involving populations of alveolar macrophages, we next investigated their phenotype in greater 
detail. Macrophages were the dominant population in the alveolar space during normoxia and afer 48 hours 
of hyperoxia. We compared expression levels of select markers on the entire pool of alveolar macrophages in 
normoxia and hyperoxia. We found signifcant up-regulation of CD44, CD45, CD11c, CD68, CD172a, CD73, 
CD205, PD-L1 in hyperoxia, consistent with an activated macrophage phenotype (Fig. 5). Increased expression of 
these markers at a single cell level during hyperoxia was also confrmed by tSNE plots of CD45+cells from whole 
parenchyma and CD45+cells from BALF, obtained from 2 separate experiments (Fig. 6). Collectively, our data 
indicate that the aberrant macrophages expressing elevated levels of PD-L1, CD68, CD11c and CD205, infrequent 
in normal alveoli, become enriched during hyperoxia.

Small populations of myeloid cells (MHCIIhi), T cells (CD3+) and B cells (CD19+) were present in the alveolar space during both normoxia and hyperoxia. Phenotypic changes of these small intra-alveolar populations 
were not detected in our study.

Discussion
High inspired concentrations of oxygen are frequently administered to anesthetized or critically ill patients to 
ensure adequate tissue oxygenation. However, hyperoxia may promote infammation, contribute to acute lung 
injury and impair antimicrobial immunity. Hyperoxia is thought to trigger a multicellular immune response, 
implicating monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and NKT cells, as noted in separate studies13–18. However, a 
global view of the immune populations during hyperoxia has not been previously studied.
Te key contribution of our study is an unbiased identifcation of immune populations which respond to 
hyperoxia by changes in their abundance, proliferation rate or phenotype. With an intent to identify the early 
responses to hyperoxia, the immune populations were analyzed at 48hours of hyperoxia exposure, before the 
exudative phase of acute lung injury is developed. No evidence of parenchymal damage was found histologically 
at this experimental time point. In the mouse model of hyperoxia used by us and other authors, lung injury 
becomes evident histologically at 72 hours, with further hyperoxia exposure leading to uniformly lethal lung 
injury at 80–90hours17,20.
By applying CyTOF mass cytometry approach, we described previously unrecognized heterogeneous efects 
of hyperoxia, including, 1) reduction of immune regulatory populations (parenchymal regulatory B cells and 
myeloid regulatory cells), 2) diminished proliferation rate of myeloid regulatory cells, monocytes and alveolar 
macrophages, and 3) enrichment of macrophages with an aberrant phenotype in the alveolar space. At this tested 
time point, no increases in neutrophil population were observed.
In our study, myeloid regulatory cells have been identifed as a distinct cluster of CD172a+Siglec-F+CD68− 
F4/80+CD11bhi CD11clo Ly6C+Ly6G− CD39+cells. Te lack of CD68 expression diferentiated these innate 
immune cells from pulmonary monocytes and macrophage subsets, and lack of Ly6G diferentiated them from 
neutrophils. Te expression of Siglec-F and F4/80 on some of these cells indicates close phenotypic similarity with, 
and/or admixture, of eosinophilic granulocytes26–29. Expression of CD39 (ENTPD1), an ectoenzyme hydrolyzing 
extracellular adenosine triphosphate, supports immunoregulatory activity of this population30,31. Our observation 
that hyperoxia adversely afects the size of this population mirrors observations in tumor immunology. Hyperoxia 
has anti-tumor efects, at least in part, by depleting myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) from tumors32. In contrast, hypoxia promotes maintenance of MDSC in tumor tissues33. From these and our studies, we might conclude 
that myeloid regulatory cells are highly sensitive to oxygen tension in vivo. Whether depletion of myeloid regulatory 
cells promotes lung infammation, or is merely a bystander efect, requires further studies.
Regulatory B cells were identifed as a distinct cluster of CD19+ B cells expressing high levels of PD-L1.

PD-1 on target cells34,35. Further characteristics included high levels of CD69 and Sca-1, consistent with an activated/memory phenotype36,37. We speculate that the early depletion of pulmonary immunoregulatory populations such as regulatory B cells and myeloid regulatory cells may facilitate development of tissue-destructive 
infammation (e.g., NKT cell, neutrophil infltration) during later stages of hyperoxic lung injury. Our data infer 
association only but do provide new avenues of study.
Hyperoxia was previously found to inhibit macrophage proliferation in vitro13 and in vivo14. We therefore

proliferation rate of alveolar macrophages, myeloid regulatory cells and monocytes during hyperoxia. Hyperoxia 
did not alter proliferation of other immune populations at the tested time point.
Contributions of alveolar macrophages to the evolution of hyperoxic lung injury are not fully understood. We 
found that hyperoxia promotes an aberrant macrophage phenotype with elevated expression of multiple markers, 
including CD44, CD68, CD11c, CD73, PD-L1 and CD205. Te functional consequences of this phenotypic shif 
have not been investigated in the present study. However, we speculate that the upregulation of PD-L1 by macrophages may be an early adaptive response to counteract oxygen-induced alveolar infammation. PD-L1 delivers 
an inhibitory signal to macrophages and other immune cells38, perhaps contributing to reduced proliferative rate 
of macrophages observed during hyperoxia by several authors13,14. In human ARDS, low expression of PD-L1 by 
alveolar macrophages is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased mortality39, indicating 
importance of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in regulating the evolution of lung injury.
Importantly, we cannot exclude that other populations of lung immune cells undergo signifcant changes during hyperoxia, however, these changes were not captured by our analytic approach. Tis may be due to the limitations of CyTOF, our chosen panel of antibodies, or a chosen time-point. For instance, we found that proportion of 
neutrophils remains unchanged at 48hours of hyperoxia and neutrophils did not migrate into the alveolar space. 
Tis is in contrast with signifcant expansion of neutrophils that we previously described in later stages of hyperoxic lung injury, at 72 hours of hyperoxic exposure17. Te late infltration by neutrophils coinciding with development of lung injury has also been shown by other authors18. In the present study, we did not identify a distinct 
cluster of NKT cells, likely due to small numbers of these cells in normal lungs as well as at 48-hour time point. 
Similar to neutrophils, we have previously reported signifcant NKT cell expansion at 72hours of hyperoxia17.

No targeted therapies currently exist to inhibit lung infammation and injury due to oxidative stress. Clinical 
management of patients with lung failure due to ARDS is currently only supportive and ofen involves administration of supraphysiologic concentrations of oxygen. It is therefore crucial that immune pathways linking hyperoxia, infammation and organ injury are better characterized to allow and hasten development of therapies.
Our fndings highlight the need to consider a variety of potential immune cell targets (macrophages, B cells, 
myeloid regulatory cells) when designing and testing immune-targeted therapies for acute lung injury or ARDS. 
Unbiased, systems immunology approaches like the ones used in this study may accelerate the discovery and 
development of immune-modulating therapies for sepsis and ARDS40–42.
Methods
Animals and exposure to hyperoxia. Eight-week-old male wild-type C57BL/6 mice were purchased 
from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were housed in accordance with guidelines from the American 
Association for Laboratory Animal Care. Mice between ages 9 and 16 weeks were used for experiments. For 
hyperoxia exposure, mice were placed in cages in a customized disinfected Plexiglas chamber, and continuous 
oxygen exposure was performed for 48hours as previously published by our group17. A calibrated oximeter was 
placed in the chamber for a continuous measurement of FiO2. Te inspired fraction of oxygen was maintained at 
above 95% by a fresh fow of oxygen at 2–3L/min. Mice had unlimited access to food and water and the typical 
light-dark cycle was maintained. Te hyperoxia exposure took place in a barrier animal facility. Our previous 
studies have determined that this exposure to hyperoxia results in severe lung injury and respiratory distress that 
would require euthanasia at 70–90 hours of exposure. Te experiments received approval from the Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center IACUC. All procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance to US federal 
guidelines in the AAALAC accredited animal facility.
Histology. Whole lungs were harvested, fxed in neutral bufered formalin and embedded in parafn. Tissue 
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocol43.
Isolation of immune cells from whole lung and bronchoalveolar fuid. To obtain immune cells 
from whole lung, mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine44 and lungs 
were excised through thoracotomy approach. Upon excision, pulmonary vasculature was not perfused in order 
to allow inclusion of potential intravascular immune cells in subsequent analysis. Mediastinal lymph nodes and 
central airways were separated from the lungs because the goal was to analyze pulmonary parenchyma. All lobes 
of the right lung were then subjected to gentle tissue digestion at room temperature for 10minutes with Liberase 
TL enzyme (Roche) and mechanically dissociated through a 40-micron sieve to yield a single-cell suspension 
(~106
 cells). Cells were cryopreserved in Cryostor CS10 (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, WA) following the manufacturer’s protocol to be used for subsequent staining with CyTOF-ready antibodies23. Bronchoalveolar fuid was 
obtained from mice, which were frst euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Lack of respiratory and cardiac activity was 
confrmed and 22G i.v. cannula was inserted into trachea via neck incision. Lungs were lavaged three times with 
1mL of phosphate bufered saline, fuid collected, and cell suspension obtained, as previously described45. Cells 
were cryopreserved as described above for subsequent CyTOF antibody staining.
CyTOF staining method. Cryopreserved cells were thawed at 37 °C, washed by centrifugation, plated, 
and immediately stained. All CyTOF stains were performed at room temperature in 96-well round-bottom 
polypropylene plates (Corning). Afer washing cells by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 minutes, 5 μM cisplatin 
viability staining reagent (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) was added for 5 minutes. Afer centrifugation, 
TruStain FcX Fc receptor blocking reagent (BioLegend) was added for 10 minutes. CyTOF antibodies were 
labeled using purifed antibodies from several diferent suppliers (BioLegend [San Diego, CA], eBioscience 
[Waltham, MA], and R&D Systems [Minneapolis, MN])23. Te CyTOF staining panels used in this study were 
custom labeled using MaxPar labeling kits (Fluidigm). Te list of antibodies is shown in Table S1. Te antibodies for cell surface staining were incubated with cells for 30 minutes. Afer fxation and permeabilization of cells 
using the FoxP3 Staining Bufer Set (eBioscience), cells were barcoded using palladium barcoding reagents and 
combined into a single sample for pooled intracellular antibody staining for 30 minutes23,46. Afer intracellular 
staining, the cells were fxed with 1.6% formaldehyde. To stain DNA, 18.75 μM iridium intercalator solution 
(Fluidigm) was added to the cells. Cells were subsequently washed and reconstituted in Milli-Q fltered distilled water with EQ four element calibration beads (Fluidigm) and then analyzed on a Helios CyTOF Mass 
Cytometer (Fluidigm)23.
CyTOF analysis and statistics. CyTOF data were first normalized and then debarcoded using the 
open-source Normalizer and Debarcoding sofware. Data analysis was performed using Cytobank (Mountain 
View, CA) and the available analysis algorithms (viSNE, CITRUS). ViSNE is a dimensionality reduction algorithm allowing visualization of high-dimensional single cell data mapped onto two dimensions as a tSNE plot22. 
tSNE plots were utilized to visualize all components of lung immune system. To identify diferences in the abundance of cellular subsets between control and hyperoxia in an unbiased manner, we used CITRUS sofware. 
CITRUS (cluster identifcation, characterization, and regression) is an algorithm designed for the fully automated 
discovery of statistically signifcant stratifying biological signatures within single cell datasets containing numerous samples across multiple known endpoints (e.g. normoxia vs hyperoxia)25. Te CITRUS sofware performed 
the statistical analysis of the high-dimensional CyTOF data to identify signifcant clusters. For descriptive statistics (comparison of cell cluster frequencies), unpaired t-test was performed using Graphpad Prism 8.0.0. (La Jolla, 
California). P-values <0.05 were considered statistically signifcant.
