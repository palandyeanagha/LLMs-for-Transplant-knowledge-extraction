Summary. It has been established that successful 
pancreas transplantation in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) 
diabetic patients results in normal but exaggerated phasic 
glucose-induced insulin secretion, normal intravenous 
glucose disappearance rates, improved glucose recovery 
from insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, improved glucagon 
secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, but no 
alterations in pancreatic polypeptide responses to 
hypoglycaemia. However, previous reports have not 
segregated the data in terms of the length of time 
following successful transplantation and very little 
prospective data collected over time in individual 
patients has been published. This article reports that in 
general there are no significant differences in the level of 
improvement when comparing responses as early as 
three months post-operatively up to as long as two years 
post-operatively when examining the data crosssectionally in patients who have successfully maintained 
their allografts. Moreover, this remarkable constancy in 
pancreatic islet function is also seen in a smaller group 
of patients who have been examined prospectively at 
various intervals post-operatively. It is concluded that 
successful pancreas transplantation results in remarkable 
improvements in Alpha and Beta cell but not PP cell 
function that are maintained for at least one to two 
years.

Introduction 
Transplantation of segments of pancreas from living 
related donors or whole pancreases from cadaveric 
donors, when successful, has been demonstrated to be 
the most effective way to maintain normal glucose 
homeostasis in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic 
patients (Sutherland et al. 1989). However, achievement 
of this degree of glucoregulation comes with the cost of 
the operative procedure, patient morbidity and patient 
mortality. Consequently, before accepting this 
operation as being effective over time in individual 
patients, it is essential to examine available data in a 
time-related, cross-sectional and prospective fashion in 
recipients with successfully functioning grafts. Using 
this analytical approach, this manuscript will report the 
results from intravenous glucose tolerance testing and 
insulin-induced hypoglycaemia testing to assess 
secretion of insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, pancreatic 
polypeptide, as well as intravenous glucose tolerance and 
glucose recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. 
Subjects and methods 
The general patient population as wen as the methodology for 
intravenous glucose tolerance tests (Diem et al. 1990) and insulininduced hypoglycaemia tests (Diem et al. 1990) have been recently 
described. Briefly, all recipients were normoglycaemic and had 
normal haemoglobin A1C levels and none were receiving 
exogenous insulin or other medication for diabetes. 
Immunosuppressiun was achieved with the triple-drag regimen of 
azathioprine, cyclosporin and prednisone. The duration of diabetes 
mellitus in the recipients was 22+6 years; the duration after 
pancreas transplantation was 14+15 months with a range of three 
to 24 months. Radioimmunoassays for insulin, C-pepfide and 
pancreatic polypeptide were as previously reported (Diem et al. 
1990). Calculation for hormonal responses involved subtracting 
fasting basal levels of the hormone from the three maximal 
hormone levels following glucose stinmlation in the ease of 
insulin and C-peptide. Glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide 
responses are reported as maximal change over basal encountered 
during the test period. Glucose recovery is given as the maximal 
level of recovery expressed as percent of initial glucose level prior 
to insulin injection. Kg is calculated as the slope of the line 
reflecting the inverse correlation between time and the natural log 
rhythm of glucose concentration at 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 rain. 
after intravenous glucose injection (20 gin).

Results 
R. P. Robertson et al.: Follow-up of islet function after pancreas transplantation 
The acute insulin responses (gU/ml) to intravenous 
glucose at 3, 12 and 24 months were 119+20, 133+31, 
and 110-2-_27 for 15, 25, and 14 recipients when the data 
were analyzed cross-sectionally. None of these values 
differs significantly from one another (Fig. 1). A 
similar trend was observed when individual data from 10 
patients who had been tested on at least two occasions 
post-operatively were examined (Fig. 1). Similar trends 
were observed when C-peptide (nmol/1) responses to 
intravenous glucose (Fig. 2) were observed. In this 
case, the values for the acute C-peptide response were 
0.97+0.15, 1.14+0.27, and 1.40+5.3 in 14, 19, and 8 
patients when data were examined cross-sectionally.

Similar findings were observed in prospectively obtained 
data from eight patients undergoing testing on at least 
two separate occasions (Fig. 2). 
Fasting plasma glucose levels (mg/dl) at 3, 12, and 24 
months post-operatively were 88+11, 86+11, and 80+7 
in 15, 24, and 13 recipients (Fig. 3). None of these 
values were significantly different from one another. 
Stability in fasting glucose levels was observed when 
data from ten individual patients who had been studied 
serially on at least two separate occasions (Fig. 3). 
Similarly, there was a constancy in the glucose 
disappearance rates (%/min) at 3, 12, and 24 months 
with values of 1.49+0.16, 1.53+0.12, and 1.80-2-_3.2 in 
14, 24, and 13 recipients (Fig. 3). Glucose 
disappearance rates also tended to remain stable in ten 
patients who were examined serially post-operatively 
(Fig. 3).

The ability of recipients to recover from insulininduced hypoglycaemia was improved as early as three 
months and they maintained this improvement up to 12 
months when data were examined cross-sectionally. The 
percent recovery in glucose by 60 min. following 
induction of hypoglycaemia pre-operatively, three 
months post-operatively and twelve months postoperatively was 40+2%, 64+3%, and 61+2% in 35, 10, 
and 19 recipients when examined cross-sectionally (Fig. 
4). A similar trend was observed when 15 patients were 
studied prospectively and serially on at least two separate 
occasions (Fig. 4). This improvement in glucose 
recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was 
associated with an improvement in glucagon secretion 
during hypoglycaemia. Cross-sectional data obtained 
pre-operatively, three months post-operatively and 
twelve months post-operatively revealed maximal 
glucagon (pg/ml) responses of 39+7, 166+43, and 
228+46 in 35, 10, and 18 recioients (Fi~. 5).

Improvement in glucagon responses was also observed 
in 14 patients who had been studied prospectively and 
serially during the post-operative periods (Fig. 5).

1987; Secchi et al. 1987; Ostman et al. 1989) and have 
been confirmed by a later lengthier report (Osei et al. 
1990). We have also previously reported that successful 
recipients of pancreas transplantation improve their 
ability to recover from insulin-induced hypoglycaemia 
and that this is associated with improvements in 
glucagon responses to hypoglycaemia (Diem et al. 
1990). In these reports we found no improvement in 
pancreatic polypeptide secretion, The only other earlier 
series reported post-transplant but no pre-transplant data 
for comparison (Bosi et al. 1988). The current 
manuscript combines our (Diem et al. 1990) older data 
with more current data to conduct a time-related, crosssectional and prospective analysis of endocrine pancreatic 
function post-operatively in recipients of successfully 
transplanted pancreas allografts. The results indicate a 
striking constancy in the improvement of insulin and Cpeptide responsivity to intravenous glucose as well as 
improvement in glucose disappearance rates. Similarly, 
the improvement in glucose recovery after insulininduced hypoglycaemia as well as glucagon responsivity 
to hypoglycaemia is remarkably constant. There is no 
indication that pancreatic polypeptide responses to 
insulin-induced hypoglycaemia improve. 
It can thus be concluded that pancreas transplantation 
in Type I diabetic subjects, when successful, results in 
long-term improvements in pancreatic Alpha and Beta 
cell function and, consequently, improved glucose 
homeostasis without the need for exogenous insulin or 
other agents used to improve glucoregulation in the 
patients. However, it should be emphasized that there is 
as yet no concensus as to the medical indications for this 
procedure. It should be borne in mind that it involves a 
great deal of expense, patient morbidity and significant 
patient mortality.

Discussion 
We have previously published that successful pancreas 
transplantation in Type 1 diabetic recipients restores 
their ability to respond with biphasic insulin and Cpeptide responses during intravenous glucose tolerance 
testing (Diem et al. 1990). They also attain normal 
levels of fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1C and 
intravenous glucose disappearance rates. These results 
are consistent with earlier more brief reports (Land et al.
