In a survey of 471 patients, we collected self-reported weight and height data and asked
about self-perceptions of provider support toward weight loss and other weight management concerns. Multivariable analysis found that respondents with higher body
mass index (BMI) were more likely to report that a physician had told them that they were
overweight (OR=3.49, 95% CI 2.06–5.89, P< 0.001). However, this conversation was less
likely to change their personal view of their weight (OR=0.62 per 5 kg/m2
,
95% CI 0.45–0.86, P=0.004), or motivate them to lose weight (OR=0.67 per 5 kg/m2
, 95%
CI 0.50–0.91, P=0.009). Higher BMI was associated with higher weight-loss goals
(P<0.001), while anticipated time to achieve those goals was increased (P< 0.001).
Physician involvement in weight management was important, but the patients’ needs
and experiences differed by BMI. Approaches to addressing barriers and identifying
resources for weight management should be tailored to individuals by considering BMI.

Introduction
In the United States, 37% of adults and 17% of
youth are considered obese (Ogden et al., 2015).
Rates of obesity differ by age, gender, and race
(Ogden et al., 2015). Obesity is a major public
health and clinical concern because of its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and
health care expenditures (Jensen et al., 2014). The
current guidelines for the management of overweight or obese adults call for primary care
providers (PCPs) to identify, counsel, and offer
treatment management for patients with obesity
(ie, ask, advise, treat) (Jensen et al., 2013).
Counseling by the PCP can increase patient motivation to engage in weight loss (Huang et al., 2004;
Bennett et al., 2014; 2015). Currently only one
of three patients who are overweight or obese is
identified as such, and among those identified, only
half are advised to lose weight and only one of five
receive counseling (Bennett et al., 2014). Although
patients with obesity expect their PCPs to discuss and
counsel them on weight loss, many physicians will not
or cannot broach the subject (Huang et al., 2004). For
PCPs, potential barriers to counseling include lack
of time, limited funding for resources, infrastructure,
and training, and concerns about damaging the
patient-doctor relationship (Huang et al., 2004;
Pollak et al., 2012; Gudzune et al., 2014; Bleich et al.,
2015; McGowan, 2016). Focus groups have concluded that if PCPs cannot provide ongoing weight
management support to their patients, they can at
least identify obesity, refer their obese/overweight
patients to a weight management expert, provide
patient accountability, and cheerlead (Bennett
et al., 2014).

Studies of PCPs perceptions of their role in
assisting their patients with weight loss are limited,
and even less is known about the experiences
and expectations of patients in primary care. To
address this gap, we conducted a needs-assessment
survey of patient experiences and expectations
regarding weight management in the primary
care setting to inform weight management in
clinical care.
Methods
The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic
Institutional Review Board; the use of implied
consent (ie, consent was implied if the survey
was completed and returned) was allowed. We
conducted a cross-sectional survey involving
a convenience sample of patients’ presenting to an
office visit at a primary care clinic at Mayo Clinic
(Rochester, MN, USA). From February 2013
through July 2013, all patients seen for a primary
care visit received an anonymous survey, a cover
letter explaining the purpose of the study, and a
stamped return envelope. Patients either returned
the survey to the receptionist or mailed it after
the visit.
The survey included a subset of validated questions from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (Yaemsiri et al., 2011) and
questions (developed by the study team) related to
weight management in primary care. Specifically,
the questionnaire included the following constructs
adapted from NHANES: self-reported height and
weight [to calculate body mass index (BMI)]
(Center for Disease Control, 2015), weight selfperception, current and past weight-loss efforts,
resources used for weight loss, and experience of
discussions about weight with the PCP. We also
assessed expectations regarding the need for weight
loss management in the primary care setting. We
conducted a pilot test before full implementation
of the survey (n = 25).
Redcap database was used (Harris et al., 2009).
Data are summarized using mean ± SD for
continuous variables and frequency counts and
percentages for categorical variables. Respondent
characteristics are summarized overall and stratified by BMI categories. Comparisons across BMI
categories were performed by using analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and
the χ
2 test for categorical variables. The frequency
of various medical conditions was compared across
BMI categories using the Cochran-Armitage trend
test. All other analyses were restricted to respondents whose BMI was ⩾25.0 kg/m2 and who
perceived themselves as overweight. For this subset of patients, previous weight-related health care
experiences, current expectations, perceived barriers to weight loss, and needs from PCP were
summarized and compared across BMI categories
by using ANOVA for continuous variables and the
Cochran-Armitage trend test for dichotomous
variables. Multiple logistic regression analyses
were performed to assess whether health care
experiences were independently associated with
BMI, adjusting for age and sex. Findings from the
multivariable analyses are summarized as odds
ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval
for a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI. In all cases,
two-sided tests were used; P values ⩽0.05 denote
statistical significance.
Results
Of the 500 surveys collected, 29 did not include
enough demographic information to be evaluated
for this study. We report on 471 returned evaluable surveys. For BMI, the mean ± SD for all
survey respondents was 27.9 ± 6.0 kg/m2 (Table 1).
Of the 471 respondents, 167 (35.5%) were underweight or healthy weight (BMI<25 kg/m2
), 164
(34.8%) were overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2
),
and 140 (29.7%) were obese (BMI ⩾30 kg/m2
).
Self-perception of weight differed significantly
(P < 0.001) across BMI categories (Table 2).
Among respondents in the normal BMI range,
15% perceived themselves as overweight and
6.6% as underweight. Among those in the overweight BMI category, 1.2% thought they were
underweight and 25.0% thought they were in the
normal range. In the obese BMI category, 7%
thought they were the in the normal range. As
BMI increased, reported comorbidities increased
significantly. A significantly greater proportion of
obese respondents reported having type 2 diabetes
mellitus, high cholesterol, high blood pressure,
arthritis of the knee/hip, and obstructive sleep
apnea.
The expectation to have weight discussed at the
PCP visit did not differ by calculated BMI

(Table 3). Patients in the overweight category and
those in the highest BMI category had the greatest
interest in having their PCP discuss weight during
the visit (61% and 63%, respectively). Respondents with higher BMIs more frequently reported
being told that they were overweight, but these
conversations were less likely to change their
personal views of their weight status or motivate
them to lose weight. From multivariable analysis,
respondents with higher BMI were less likely to
report that a physician telling them they were
overweight changed their personal view of their
weight status (OR = 0.62 per 5 kg/m2
, 95% CI
0.45–0.86, P = 0.004), or motivated them to lose
weight (OR = 0.67 per 5 kg/m2
, 95% CI 0.50–0.91,
P = 0.009).
A higher percentage of patients with higher
BMIs were trying to lose weight at the time of the
survey (with goals of losing 36% versus 12% of
their total body weight for obese and overweight
respondents, respectively; P <0.001). As BMI
increased, the mean personal goal for weight loss
and anticipated time frame to achieve it increased
and the importance of financial limitations,

physical limitations, lack of overall general
support, and fatigue increased.
A greater proportion of respondents with higher
BMIs expressed the expectation that their PCP
would discuss health consequences of overweight
and obesity, review weight loss medications
options, provide support and follow-up, offer a
weight loss program in primary care, and provide
access to specialists, weight-loss programs, and
weight-management surgery.
Discussion
Most respondents had accurate weight selfperceptions. As calculated BMI increased, respondents reported having more comorbidities and
being told that they were overweight by their PCP,
but those with higher BMI were less likely to indicate that these conversations changed their personal view of their weight status or motivated them
to lose weight. One explanation for this is these
patients may have been previously told they are
obese and may have tried and failed numerous
types of interventions to lose weight. Overweight
patients on average wanted to lose 11% of their
current weight, and patients with obesity wanted to
lose 35% compared with the recommended goal of
2–5% loss from baseline weight (Donato et al., 1998;
Weight-control Information Network (WIN) et al.,
2005). This highlights the importance of PCPs
discussing reasonable goals as increased frequency
of PCP contact has been associated with more realistic weight loss goals(Dutton et al., 2010). As BMI
increased, the most common perceived barriers
were financial, physical, and support limitations and
increased fatigue. As weight increases, the ability to
exercise can decrease leading to a deconditioning
and fatigue (Mehta and Cavuoto, 2017). In addition, many obesity treatments (eg, higher quality of
food, exercise programs, athletic centers, obesity
medications, and bariatric surgery) can be financially prohibitive and may not be covered by
health insurance.
We observed that most patients who were
overweight or obese wanted to discuss their weight
at the current visit with the PCP. Discussions about
weight require consideration of message content
and delivery. In a recent study of 600 patients who
were overweight or obese in a primary care setting,
PCPs who were perceived to ‘judge’ patients had
less success in engaging the patient in weight loss
than those patients with PCPs who discussed but
did not ‘judge’ (13.5% versus 20.1%, respectively)
(Gudzune et al., 2014). Some of the skills and attitudes needed when providing weight management
counseling include awareness of the weight
management literature, use of nonjudgmental

language, and focusing on the patient and not
the obesity diagnosis when discussing possible
management plans. In addition, we recommend
following the five As – ask permission to discuss
weight concerns, assess their BMI, advise on
health risks, agree on realistic weight loss expectations and goals, and assist in identifying, and
addressing barriers (McGowan, 2016).
Many patients who are overweight or obese
want support from their PCPs for weight loss; but
weight concerns are inconsistently addressed and
support is infrequently provided. Whether this is
linked to lack of adequate tools for identifying or
diagnosing obesity or lack of BMI documentation
is unknown. In some clinical situations, patients
with obesity and other co-morbid conditions had
BMI documented compared with otherwise
healthy patients who were obese but otherwise
healthy and did not have their BMI documented
(Melamed et al., 2009). In another study,
obesity was underdiagnosed (14.4% of patients
with BMI ⩾ 30 kg/m2
), and only 5% of the patients
who were overweight or obese recalled being
counseled by their PCP on weight and exercise
(Huang et al., 2004). Patients who recalled the
counseling interaction understood the risks of
obesity and benefits of weight loss, and they were
more confident and ready to lose weight (Huang
et al., 2004). Some barriers to initiating weight
management discussions which have been identified by PCPs included pessimism about their
patients’ desire and ability to lose weight, pessimism about the effectiveness weight loss program
itself, lack of comprehensive obesity management
resources, lack of time, high patient volume,
underuse of clinical resources with expertise
(eg, dieticians), and lack of counseling skills and
knowledge concerning clinical best practice for
weight management (Huang et al., 2004).
In a recent focus group study of 26 PCPs,
recommendations for effective weight management care in primary care included (1) provision of
feedback to PCPs by weight management coaches
in an efficient and actionable manner; (2) integration of weight concerns into practice, with an
intake questionnaire about weight management
that could be quickly reviewed and discussed; (3) a
referral system to have patients receive weight
counseling from expert coaches and to facilitate
telephone support; and (4) improving the financial
feasibility of incorporating weight management
into the clinical encounter (Bennett et al., 2014).
A multidisciplinary model of care (ie, incorporating providers with specialized skills and expertise
from different health care professions) has been
successfully used in many clinical practices as a
way to reduce time and financial burden (Batsis

The US guidelines recommend that PCPs assist
patients with weight management (Jensen et al.,
2014). The treatment algorithm for weight management which could be adapted to individual
practices can be based on resource availability
(Donato et al., 1998). It is recommended that
physicians receive training in motivational interviewing (MI) messaging early in their career
(Huang et al., 2004; Burton et al., 2016; McGowan,
2016). Use of MI may help clinicians facilitate
behavior change in patients who are overweight or
obese, since it has been shown that patients of
PCPs who use MI strategies have lost more weight
(Pollak et al., 2012), this in turn will increase the
clinician’s confidence in their ability to help
patients. Physician confidence in their ability to
help their patients in weight management is crucial
for the effectiveness of the behavioral intervention; conversely, lack of appropriate skills can
compromise the effectiveness of clinical weight
loss interventions and damage the clinician–
patient relationship (Pollak et al., 2012).
Addressing weight management issues in the
clinical setting is challenging and complex. Clinicians may benefit from training in evidence-based
approaches to weight management counseling.
Furthermore, greater connectivity of the clinical
setting to community resources to support weight
management are needed, particularly to address
potential disparities encountered by patients in
socioeconomic conditions associated with overweight and obesity Weight management efforts
must be tailored to individuals’ needs and resources (Overweight And Obesity in the Wester Pacific
Region, 2017).
Our study has several limitations. The survey
was administered at a single clinic and respondents
were predominantly non-Hispanic whites limiting
the generalizability of our findings. The survey was
administered to a convenience sample, which may
also limit generalizability. Weight and height were
self-reported and not confirmed with clinical
measurements, so the calculated BMIs may be
inaccurate. Finally, we did not assess the message

content or quality of message delivery when the
PCP discussed weight management and experience with the PCP past messaging may have
influenced responses.
Involving PCP in weight management is important for patients who are overweight or obese. We
observed that patient needs, perceptions, and
experiences relating to body weight and weight
loss in the primary care setting differ by BMI. Our
results highlight the need for improved resources
and training to support PCPs in an effort to offer
advice and support to patients with body weight
concerns. Our data suggest that approaches to
addressing barriers and provision of resources for
weight management in the primary care setting
could be tailored to BMI category.
