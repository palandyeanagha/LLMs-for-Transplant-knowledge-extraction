Abstract
Sepsis often is characterized by an acute brain dysfunction, which is associated with increased morbidity and
mortality. Its pathophysiology is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes,
which may induce significant alterations in vulnerable areas of the brain. Important mechanisms include excessive
microglial activation, impaired cerebral perfusion, blood–brain-barrier dysfunction, and altered neurotransmission.
Systemic insults, such as prolonged inflammation, severe hypoxemia, and persistent hyperglycemia also may
contribute to aggravate sepsis-induced brain dysfunction or injury. The diagnosis of brain dysfunction in sepsis
relies essentially on neurological examination and neurological tests, such as EEG and neuroimaging. A brain MRI
should be considered in case of persistent brain dysfunction after control of sepsis and exclusion of major
confounding factors. Recent MRI studies suggest that septic shock can be associated with acute cerebrovascular
lesions and white matter abnormalities. Currently, the management of brain dysfunction mainly consists of control
of sepsis and prevention of all aggravating factors, including metabolic disturbances, drug overdoses,
anticholinergic medications, withdrawal syndromes, and Wernicke’s encephalopathy. Modulation of microglial
activation, prevention of blood–brain-barrier alterations, and use of antioxidants represent relevant therapeutic
targets that may impact significantly on neurologic outcomes. In the future, investigations in patients with sepsis
should be undertaken to reduce the duration of brain dysfunction and to study the impact of this reduction on
important health outcomes, including functional and cognitive status in survivors.

Review
Sepsis often is characterized by an early and acute
encephalopathy, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [1,2]. Patients present with fluctuating mental status changes, inattention, disorganized
thinking and therefore match with current criteria for
delirium. Delirium is a multifactorial syndrome and
several risk factors have been identified during critical
illness, including patients’ characteristics (e.g., older age,
cognitive impairment), the severity of illness, environmental factors (e.g., sleep deprivation, noisy environment), medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids),
and common metabolic disturbances, such as fever,
dysnatremias, hypoglycemia, and possibly hyperglycemia
[3-5]. Among the myriad of conditions that can induce
delirium in critical illness, sepsis, in the form of sepsisassociated encephalopathy (SAE), represents the most
frequent and severe cause [6,7]. Diagnosing brain dysfunction in a patient with sepsis implies a systematic
diagnostic approach of all potential factors, in addition
to sepsis, that can contribute to aggravate or prolong
brain dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of brain dysfunction in sepsis focusing
on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and potential strategies
to improve neurologic outcomes.
Pathophysiology
Brain signaling and microglial activation
The encephalopathy in sepsis is considered a diffuse
cerebral dysfunction as a consequence of the systemic
inflammatory response to an infection, with no direct
central nervous system infection (Figure 1). The response to stress is physiologically triggered by an activating signal that is mediated by two pathways. The first
one is the vagus nerve, which can detect visceral

inflammation through its axonal cytokines receptors:
inflammatory products produced in damaged tissues
activate afferent signals that are relayed to the nucleus
tractus solitarius in the brainstem. Subsequent activation
of vagus efferent activity inhibits cytokine synthesis in
damaged tissues through a cholinergic anti-inflammatory
pathway (the inflammatory reflex) [8]. The vagus nerve is
also connected to other autonomic nuclei, notably the
paraventricular nucleus that controls adrenal axis and
vasopressin secretion [9]. The second pathway involves the
circumventricular organs (CVOs), which are located near
neuroendocrine and neurovegetative nuclei. CVOs are
deprived of a blood–brain barrier (BBB) and express components of innate and adaptive immune systems. Once
visceral or systemic inflammation is detected by the first or
the second pathway, the activating signal will spread to behavioral, neuroendocrine, and neurovegetative centers.
Sepsis enhances the transcription of several pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the brain, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-1
beta (IL1β), transforming growth factor beta (TGF β), and
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) [10]. These
mediators modulate the expression of α-amino-3-hydroxy5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs)
and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) on neurons, inducing brain dysfunction [11]. Recent studies have
suggested the novel importances of IL1β and High Mobility
Group Box 1 on the development of cognitive impairment
in sepsis survivors [12,13]. These cytokines also modulate
NMDARs, with functional consequences on cognition and
behavior [14].
Microglial activation may represent one of the earliest
changes observed in sepsis-associated encephalopathy
and prolonged microglial activation may negatively affect
other brain cells [15]. Early microglial activation in
sepsis was evidenced in mice models within 4 hours
following LPS injection, as assessed by the increased
proinflammatory cytokine IL1β level in microglia [16].

Figure 1 The response of the brain to systemic infection is physiologically triggered by an activating signal that is mediated by three
pathways. 1) The neural pathway that requires activation of primary afferent nerves, such as the vagal or the trigeminal nerves, by involving
peripherally produced pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and cytokines. 2) The humoral pathway involves circulating cytokines.
They reach the brain at the level of the choroid plexus and the circumventricular organs that lie outside the blood–brain barrier (BBB). 3) The
blood–brain barrier alterations induced by the activation of cerebral endothelial cells results in the release of various mediators into the brain.
This activation is due to the production, at the early phase of sepsis, of nitric oxide synthase-derived nitric oxide. All of these pathways instigate
the activation of microglial cells, which are the resident immune cells of the brain. When activated, microglial cells may negatively affect the brain
by the production of nitric oxide, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species that lead to cell death within vulnerable areas of the brain. This
production is, in itself, responsible for an increase of the BBB alterations, thus causing a vicious circle of increasing brain dysfunction and injury.
These mechanisms are compounded by common metabolic disturbances that occur in septic patients (such as prolonged hyperglycemia, severe
hypoxemia), hemodynamic failure, use of medications, and iatrogenic and environmental factors. Septic-associated brain dysfunction may be
associated with neurologic sequelae in survivors, including functional and cognitive decline, probably by neurodegenerative and/or
ischemic mechanisms.

microglia activation only 1h after LPS-induced systemic
inflammation [17]. Moreover, experimental studies suggest that aging may increase the intensity of microglial
activation and the production proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus, notably IL1β [18,19]. The
IL1β-mediated inflammatory process in the hippocampus was confirmed in different models of systemic inflammation, including cecal ligation and puncture and
peripheral surgery [20,21]. Numerous experimental studies suggest that these proinflammatory mediators released in the central nervous system at the onset of
sepsis will in turn lead to neuronal loss within vulnerable
areas of the brain, including the hippocampus [22-24].
Collectively, these findings represent a neuropathological
basis for persistent cognitive impairment, hippocampal
atrophy, and electroencephalographic changes observed
in sepsis survivors [25].
Endothelial activation and blood–brain barrier
dysfunction
Sepsis induces activation of cerebral endothelial cells,
which result in BBB dysfunction and release of various
mediators into the brain. Experimental data indicate that
at the early phase of sepsis, endothelial nitric oxide
synthase-derived nitric oxide exhibits proinflammatory
characteristics and contributes to the activation and
dysfunction of cerebrovascular endothelial cells [26].
The activated endothelium relays the inflammatory response into the brain by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and NO that are able to interact with surrounding
brain cells. The other consequences of endothelial activation may include microcirculatory dysfunction, which
might compromise cerebral perfusion [27]. Other studies
suggest that endotoxemia leads to inflammation in brain,
with alteration in BBB, up-regulation of aquaporin 4
(AQP4) and associated edema, neutrophil infiltration,
astrocyte activation, as well as apoptotic cell death, all of
which appear to be mediated by TNF-alpha signaling
through TNF-receptor 1 [28]. Alterations of BBB also
have been evidenced in patients with septic shock, with
help of brain MRI [29]. BBB breakdown can be localized
in the cortex around the Virchow-Robin spaces or have
a more diffuse pattern in the whole white matter. It also
can predominate in posterior lobes, being consistent
with a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
[30]. Noninvasive assessment by MRI allowed the identification of new aspects of brain damage in experimental
models of sepsis, including cytotoxic and vasogenic
edema as well as neuronal damage. These findings highlight the potential applications of MRI techniques for
the diagnostic and therapeutic studies in sepsis [31]. Finally, BBB alterations might facilitate the passage of potential neurotoxic factors from the peripheral circulation
to the brain. For instance, plasma tryptophan levels are
associated with delirium in critically ill patients [32,33].
More recently, increased kynurenine pathway activation,
assessed by plasma kynurenine and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, was found to be associated with fewer days
without acute brain dysfunction [33].
Endothelial activation alters vascular tone and induces
both microcirculatory dysfunction and coagulopathy,
which will in turn favor ischemic and/or hemorrhagic
lesions [34]. Neuropathological studies performed in
nonsurvivors of septic shock suggest that ischemia is
consistently observed in brain areas susceptible to low
cerebral flow and that hemorrhages can be found in
approximately 10% of cases [34,35]. Furthermore, it has
been recently shown that SAE is rather associated with
disturbed autoregulation than with altered cerebral
blood flow or tissue oxygenation [36].
Deficit in cholinergic function and alteration of
neurotransmission
Deficits in cholinergic function have been postulated to
cause delirium and cognitive decline [37]. Global
hypocholinergia result from several mechanisms, including impaired acetylcholine synthesis and cholinergic synaptic dysfunction (impairment of presynaptic, synaptic,
or postsynaptic functions of acetylcholine). Nicotinic receptors within the brain bind acetylcholine to modulate
cognitive functioning, arousal learning, and memory.
Use of anesthetic drugs that decrease acetylcholine release (e.g., isoflurane) may impact on cognitive function
after surgery [38]. Anticholinergic medications and their
metabolites also may induce delirium through competitive antagonism of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors
that are more widely distributed throughout the brain. It
was recently demonstrated that chronic cholinergic
hypoactivity in the basal forebrain represents a major
factor of acute brain dysfunction under systemic inflammation [39].
Other significant neurotransmitter alterations have
been described during experimental sepsis, involving
brain beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and
serotoninergic pathways [40]. These phenomena seem to
predominate in cortex and in hippocampus, and may be
mediated by NO, cytokines and prostaglandins [41].
Neurotransmitter balance also is altered by different
circulating molecules, such as ammonium, tyrosine,
tryptophan, and phenylalanine, whose plasma levels are
increased secondary to liver dysfunction and muscle
proteolysis [42]. Imbalance between dopaminergic and
cholinergic neurotransmission is considered a major
mechanism of delirium in critically ill patients. It also
has been hypothesized that reduced cholinergic inhibition of microglia is involved in delirium [15]. However,
administration of rivastigmine, a pharmacological agent
that may restore cholinergic control of microglia, did

not decrease duration of delirium and might have increased mortality of critically ill patients with delirium
[43]. Data from studies performed in critically ill patients
receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation also suggest
that use of GABA-agonists, such as benzodiazepines, is
associated with an increased risk of brain dysfunction
[44]. Noradrenergic neurotransmission also might be
particularly involved in SAE as dexmedetomidine, a
selective agonist of alpha2-adrenoceptors expressed
in the locus coeruleus, is associated with less brain
dysfunction and better outcomes in septic patients
compared with midazolam [45,46]. These findings
were recently confirmed in a recent, multicenter trial,
where dexmedetomidine compared with midazolam, improved patient’s ability to communicate [47]. Beneficial
effects of dexmedetomidine notably include significant
preconditioning and postconditioning effects against
ischemic brain injury [48,49]. More recent experimental data suggested that neuroprotective effects of
dexmedetomidine against glutamate-induced cell death
were mediated by an increase in astrocyte expression
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent pathway [50].
Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
apoptosis
Experimental data suggest that oxidative damage,
assessed by the thiobarbituric acid reactive species and
the protein carbonyl assays, occurs early (after 6 hours)
in the course of sepsis [51]. Moreover, the combined use
of antioxidants (N-acetyl-cysteine and deferoxamine) attenuates oxidative damage in hippocampus 6 hours after
sepsis induction [52]. Mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis
has been evidenced in experimental sepsis and might be
related to a decrease of intracellular anti-apoptotic
(bcl-2) and an increase of pro-apoptotic (bax) factors
[22]. In patients who had died from septic shock, neuronal and microglial apoptosis have been detected in
neurovegetative and neuroendocrine nuclei as well as in
amygdala [35]. Intensity of apoptosis correlated with expression of endothelial iNOS. Recent data suggested that
Caspase-3 is involved in part in apoptosis in the dentate
gyrus cell layer of the hippocampus in septic rats [53].
Additionally to nitric oxide, other pro-apoptotic factors
have been incriminated, such as glutamate, TNFα, and
hyperglycemia [54].
Prolonged inflammation and other systemic insults
A recent study performed in critically ill patients suggested that high baseline inflammatory biomarkers of
systemic inflammation at admission, such as C-reactive
protein and procalcitonin, predicted prolonged periods
of acute brain dysfunction, irrespective of whether patients had sepsis or not [55]. In another study performed
in 50 patients with systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS), IL-8 was independently associated
with delirium [56]. These findings suggest that sustained
systemic inflammation may contribute to prolong or
aggravate brain dysfunction. Stress hyperglycemia, which
commonly develops in critically ill patients, also may
aggravate sepsis-induced brain injury. In a recent neuropathological study performed in nonsurvivors of critical
illness, hyperglycemia was shown to aggravate critical
illness-induced neuropathological changes [57]. Patients
with uncontrolled hyperglycemia showed increased microglial activation, an important reduction in the density and
activation status of astrocytes, increased neuronal
damage, and apoptosis in hippocampus and frontal
cortex. Most of these abnormalities were virtually
absent with normoglycemia. Interestingly, moderate
hyperglycemia was shown to be associated with adverse cognitive outcomes in survivors of the acute
respiratory distress syndrome [58]. Prolonged hypoxemia also may contribute to brain dysfunction and
injury during sepsis. Recently, in a study performed in
survivors of prolonged critical illness, a low partial
pressure of arterial oxygen during ICU stay was
associated with cognitive and psychiatric impairment
at 12 months [59].
Selective vulnerability
Brain lesions in septic shock have been described in
areas of the brain susceptible to ischemia (including
Ammon’s horn, the frontal junctional cortex, the
lenticular nuclei, the dentate nucleus, and the medullary olive), in the hypothalamic nuclei (supraoptic
and paraventricular nuclei), the amygdala, the locus
coeruleus, and the medullary autonomic nuclei (nucleus tractus solitarii, ambiguous, and parabrachial
nuclei) [34,35]. Hippocampal lesions due to inflammatory but also ischemic, hypoxic, or dysglycemic insults
[57,60] may explain long-term psychological and cognitive disorders observed in survivors of critical illness
[25,61]. Interestingly, reduction of oxidative stress in
hippocampus is associated with less cognitive dysfunction in septic rats [52]. There also are arguments for a
global brainstem dysfunction during sepsis. First, a recent study suggested that abolition of cough reflex and
oculocephalic responses in sedated critically ill patients
are associated with death and delirium, respectively
[62]. Second, the brainstem nuclei are liable to apoptosis [35] and use of dexmedetomidine, which have
antiapoptotic properties [63], is associated with less
delirium in septic patients [64]. Finally, impaired sympathetic control of heart rate is frequent and associated
with increased mortality in septic patients suggesting a
central autonomic regulatory dysfunction [65].

Diagnosis
Clinical examination
Clinical examination
Detection of acute brain dysfunction in ICU is based on
repeated daily neurological examination. Sepsis-associated
encephalopathy is characterized by acute changes in mental
status, cognition, alteration of sleep/wake cycle, disorientation, impaired attention, and/or disorganized thinking [66].
Sometimes exaggerated motor activity with agitation, and/
or hallucinations can be observed and agitation and
somnolence can occur alternatively. Other but less
frequent motor symptoms include paratonic rigidity,
asterixis, tremor and multifocal myoclonus. Physicians
have at their disposal validated clinical instruments for
detecting brain dysfunction of critically ill patients, including the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU
(CAM-ICU) [6], and the intensive care delirium screening
checklist (ICDSC) [67]. Once brain dysfunction is identified, an exhaustive neurological examination assessing
neck stiffness, motor responses, muscular strength, plantar and deep tendon reflexes and cranial nerves is
mandatory. Although the use of sedative drugs may represent a major limitation in the interpretation of clinical
findings, a recent study suggested that assessment of
brainstem responses is feasible in sedated critically ill
patients and loss of selected responses is predictive of
mortality and altered mental status [62]. Assessments of
plasma levels of brain injury biomarkers, such as neuron
specific enolase and S-100 B-protein, have been proposed
for detecting brain dysfunction and injury in sedated
patients with sepsis [68,69]. Occurrence of sudden fluctuations in mental status unexplained by modification of
sedative infusion rate, occurrence of focal neurological
sign, seizure(s) and/or neck stiffness should prompt the
physician to consider neuroimaging, EEG and/or lumbar
puncture to rule out a direct central nervous system
infection.
Brain imaging
In case of focal neurological signs, a brain computed
tomography should be performed to rule out ischemic
or hemorrhagic brain injury [29,34]. Brain MRI should
be considered systematically in case of persistent
encephalopathy after control of sepsis and exclusion of
major confounding factors. With use of diffusionweighted imaging and gradient echo sequences, this
tool has a higher sensitivity than CT for detecting
acute CNS disorders, such as recent ischemic or
hemorrhagic stroke. Several changes have been described in septic patients (Table 1). Moreover,
additionally to the importance of etiological diagnosis,
assessment of the nature, and extent of brain damage
may also influence patient’s treatment.
Electroencephalography
In case of seizure(s), including palpebral myoclonus, an
EEG will be required to rule out subtle status epilepticus.
Several electrographic patterns have been described in
septic patients (Table 2). Sepsis can be associated with
electrographic seizures or periodic epileptiform discharges [73]. In a recent study, generalized periodic
discharges were strongly associated with nonconvulsive
seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus [74]. However, the impact of generalized periodic discharges on
neurologic outcomes remains to be elucidated. Other
EEG abnormalities include increased theta rhythms,
triphasic waves and, less often but more pejorative, burst
suppression patterns [75].
Causes of encephalopathy requiring specific treatment
Standard laboratory tests should be performed systematically to detect and correct common metabolic disturbances that can cause delirium or coma (such as
hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypo- or hypernatremia).
In addition to sedatives and analgesics, many classes of
drugs currently administered in critically ill patients can
induce acute brain dysfunction, notably a number of antibiotics, steroids, and cardiac drugs (Table 3).
Benzodiazepines and opioid withdrawal syndromes
may represent an important cause of delirium after discontinuation of sedation. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome
often is evoked in a patient with a history of alcohol dependence who develops encephalopathy [78]. The predominance of psychomotor agitation and autonomic
signs are suggestive of the diagnosis. The benefit of alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis is unproven. Early and aggressive titration of medication guided by symptoms is
the only feature associated with improved outcomes. In
malnourished or alcoholic patients, Wernicke’s encephalopathy must always be evoked and treated with
intravenous thiamine, especially if there is evidence of
ophthalmoplegia or ataxia [79]. Thiamine deficiency can
be aggravated by infusion of glucose. Tobacco dependency is a risk factor for delirium in critically ill patients,
which may be prevented by use of nicotine patch in

chronic smokers [80]. Numerous iatrogenic and/or
environmental factors also may aggravate brain dysfunction, such as use of physical restraints, excessive
noise, or underexposure to light in the ICU [81,82].
In a patient with unexplained neurologic symptoms
(focal neurologic sign or encephalopathy) and bloodstream
infection, infective endocarditis should be systematically
ruled out as this condition often is associated with neurologic complications [83]. Of note, endocarditis has to be
ruled out in the presence of cerebral microbleeds on MRI
[84]. Finally, air embolism is an iatrogenic cause of sudden
coma, agitation, seizure, or focal neurological signs, and for
which hyperbaric oxygen is recommended. It must be emphasized that SAE often is a multifactorial condition.

Finally, reappearance or persistence of encephalopathy
may indicate that sepsis is not controlled.
Outcomes
Eidelman et al. showed in a landmark study that approximately one-third of patients with sepsis had a
Glasgow coma scale less than 12 and that alteration of
alertness and consciousness was an independent prognosis factor, increasing mortality rate up to 63% when
Glasgow coma scale drops below 8 [1]. More recent
studies have shown that in addition to being highly
prevalent in the ICU, delirium is an independent risk
factor for threefold increase in mortality, with elderly patients being at an increased risk [7]. Number of days of
ICU delirium was associated with higher 1-year mortality after adjustment for relevant covariates in an older
ICU population [85]. Mortality also increases with severity of electrophysiological abnormalities, ranging from 0
when EEG is interpreted as normal to 67% when it
shows burst suppressions [73,76]. Electrographic seizures and periodic discharges also are associated with increased mortality [29,73-75]. The prognosis value of
MRI findings remains to be assessed [29]. The impact of
brain dysfunction during sepsis on secondary outcomes
is not known but is certainly close to that reported for
delirium in critically ill patients, including prolonged
length of stay in ICU and hospital, a longer duration of
mechanical ventilation and at an extra cost [7,86]. Severe
sepsis also is independently associated with substantial
and persistent new cognitive impairment and functional
disability [87]. A cognitive deficit also has been reported
in survivors from the acute respiratory distress syndrome [88-90]. Interestingly, it has been shown that
an elevated level of amyloid-beta in intensive care patients with delirium correlates with long-term cognitive
impairment [56]. In addition, hippocampal atrophy may
represent a determinant of neuropsychological sequelae
[25], including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic
stress syndrome [91].
Therapeutic perspectives
Because there is no specific treatment for SAE yet, treatment should focus on control of infection source and
supportive measures, such as management of organ failure(s), prevention of metabolic disturbances, and avoidance of neurotoxic drugs. Preventive strategies to reduce
occurrence and duration of brain dysfunction should be
applied for every patient admitted to the ICU (Table 4).
Symptomatic treatment of delirium and agitation does
not differ from that propose in critically ill patients and
has been described elsewhere [92]. Adjunctive therapies
of septic shock may protect the BBB or reduce endothelial activation, but their effect has not been established.
For instance, activated protein C in septic shock patients with impaired consciousness significantly reduced
plasma levels of S100-β protein [93]. Steroids have been
shown to reduce posttraumatic stress syndrome [94]
and prevention of prolonged hyperglycemia also may be
neuroprotective [57].
Various therapeutic interventions have been experimentally tested. Inhibition of iNOS reduces neuronal
apoptosis in septic animals but does not improve the
state of consciousness and may even aggravate ischemic
injuries of the brain [105]. Another study showed that
sepsis-induced cognitive impairment at 2 months was
prevented in iNOS knockout mice [24]. Experimental
studies show a protective effect on the BBB with the use
of magnesium [106,107], riluzole [107], hyperbaric
oxygen therapy [108], calcium channel blockers, steroids, or anticytokine antibodies [109]. Intravenous

immunoglobulins, administered before cecal ligation
and perforation, seem to preserve BBB integrity [110].
Regarding oxidative stress, antioxidant treatment with
N-acetylcysteine and deferoxamine prevents cognitive
impairment in septic mice [52].
Conclusions
Brain dysfunction is frequent in sepsis but too often
neglected, despite its dramatic impact on outcomes. Its
pathophysiology is highly complex, resulting from both
inflammatory and noninflammatory processes that affect
all types of brain cells. The diagnosis of encephalopathy
relies essentially on neurological examination, which can
lead to specific neurological tests, including EEG and
neuroimaging. Brain dysfunction during sepsis is frequently entwined with others factors that have to be
screened systematically, including withdrawal syndrome,
drugs overdose, and severe metabolic disturbances.
Currently, the treatment of sepsis-associated encephalopathy mainly consists of general management of
sepsis and prevention of aggravating factors, including
metabolic disturbances, drug overdoses, anticholinergic
medications, withdrawal syndromes, and Wernicke’s encephalopathy. In the future, investigations should be
undertaken to reduce the duration of brain dysfunction
and to study the impact of this reduction on important
health outcomes, including mortality and functional and
cognitive status in survivors. Modulation of microglial
activation, prevention of BBB alterations, and use of
antioxidants represent relevant therapeutic targets that
may impact significantly on neurologic outcomes.
