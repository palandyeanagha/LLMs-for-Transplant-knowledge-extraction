INTRODUCTION
Currently accepted quality indicators for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) limit cannulation 
failure rates to 3% to 5% in the hands of high volume endoscopists.1
 Common reasons for failed biliary cannulation at specialized centers include variant anatomy, malignant luminal 
or biliary obstruction, and periampullary diverticula.2,3 The 
conventional alternate options for management of biliary obstruction after unsuccessful ERCP include percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (BD) or surgery.4-6 However, the 
long recovery times, delays in receiving chemotherapy, and discomfort of percutaneous drains can significantly burden paClin Endosc 2013;46:543-551

tients with limited life expectancies. The significant morbidity and mortality associated with these procedures motivated 
providers to create less invasive means to treat this patient population. 
The first hint that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided BD 
may be a solution to the problem came in 1996 when Wiersema et al.7
 published the first case of EUS-guided cholangiography. Seven years later, Giovannini et al.8
 took the next step 
and reported the first case of EUS-BD in a patient with inoperable hilar obstruction. In 2006, in a small case series, Kahaleh et al.9
 described the first rendezvous procedure using 
EUS as opposed to interventional radiology assistance.
Although EUS-BD has rapidly been gaining attraction and 
popularity in the endoscopic world, the indications and methods have yet to be standardized. A consortium of 40 expert 
endoscopists from around the world met in 2011 to try and standardize definitions, nomenclature, and indications.10 While 
the nomenclature has yet to be set, generally accepted indications for EUS-BD include: 1) failed conventional ERCP, 2) altered anatomy, 3) tumor preventing access into the biliary tree, 
and 4) contraindication to percutaneous access such as large

Currently, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the preferred procedure for biliary drainage for various pancreatico-biliary disorders. ERCP is successful in 90% of the cases, but is unsuccessful in cases with altered anatomy or with tumors obstructing access to the duodenum. Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with surgical or percutaneous approaches in unsuccessful 
ERCP cases, biliary endoscopists have been using endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) more frequently within the 
last decade in different countries. As with any novel advanced endoscopic procedure that incorporates various approaches, advanced endoscopists all over the world have innovated and adopted diverse EUS-BD techniques. Indications for EUS-BD include failed conventional ERCP, altered anatomy, tumor preventing access into the biliary tree and contraindication to percutaneous access (i.e., ascites, etc.). 
EUS-BD utilizing EUS-guided rendezvous technique is conducted by creating a tract from either the stomach or the duodenum into the 
bile duct. Although EUS-BD has rapidly been gaining attraction and popularity in the endoscopic world, the indications and methods 
have yet to be standardized. There are several access routes and techniques that are employed by advanced endoscopists throughout the 
world for BD. This article reviews the indications and currently practiced EUS-BD techniques, including indications, technical details 
(intrahepatic or extrahepatic approach), equipment, patient selection, complications, and overall advantages and limitations.

ascites. 
This review will summarize the principles and methods of 
performing EUS-BD along with the existing published literature on the topic. 
PRINCIPLES OF EUS-BD
Although EUS-BD is still a technique in evolution, there are 
some guiding principles that clarify the justification, approach, and appropriate setting for this procedure. There are multiple benefits of performing EUS-BD over percutaneous or 
surgical routes. One logistical and economic benefit is the 
ability to perform EUS-BD during the same visit as an unsuccessful ERCP without needing to reschedule a subsequent procedure. It also confers physiologic and anatomic advantages 
by tailoring various routes of internal BD depending on the individual’s specific malignant obstruction.10
There are six possible methods of BD by EUS-BD. The first 
decision point is whether to gain biliary access via the intrahepatic or extrahepatic approach. Once access is acquired, biliary 
decompression can be achieved in either a transmural or transpapillary fashion. The transpapillary route can be further 
divided into antegrade or retrograde (i.e., rendezvous) drainage. The choice of approach should be individualized for each 
patient as there are no prospective studies showing superiority of one method over the other. 
Because EUS-BD is a novel, advanced procedure, it requires 
special expertise to perform. A consensus at the 2011 consortium agreed that EUS-BD should be attempted by trained 
pancreaticobiliary endoscopists who successfully complete 200 
to 300 EUS and ERCP procedures annually, meet quality indicators, and have appropriate interventional radiology and 
surgical backup.10
MATERIALS AND INSTRUMENTS
To maximize chances of success, prevent delays, and minimize complications, it is important to have a plan of approach 
along with all the necessary equipment easily available prior to 
beginning an EUS-BD procedure. After access has been gained to the biliary system, the endoscopist must be steady, focused, and deliberate in their actions to maintain wire access, 
minimize manipulations, and prevent complications. 
1) Fluoroscopy: EUS-BD cannot be accomplished safely 
without fluoroscopy as it allows for visualization of the needle 
angle prior to duct puncture and subsequent confirmation of 
biliary access. The needle should enter in the bile duct in the 
caudad direction when attempting transpapillary drainage 
and in the cephalad direction during choledochoduodenostomy (CDS). 
2) Contrast media: contrast used during EUS-BD is usually 
water-soluble, iodine-based. After needle puncture into the 
biliary system, contrast injection allows for confirmation of 
location prior to further manipulation.
3) Water to flush catheters and hydrophilic wires.
4) Echoendoscope with a 3.8 mm working channel (to avoid instrument limitation). If rendezvous procedure is being 
attempted, then a side-viewing duodenoscope should also be 
available. 
5) EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) needles: most 
case series have reported use of a 19 gauge (G) needle for EUSBD over the 22 G needle because of easier manipulation of a 
0.035-inch guidewire. 
6) Hydrophilic 0.035-inch guidewires are preferred due to 
the ease of their manipulation. Uncoated guidewires may be 
safer to prevent any shearing that the EUS-FNA needle may 
have on the wire. 
7) Bougie catheters and dilating balloons: generally the preferred calibers are 6 to 7 Fr for the bougie catheter and 4 to 6 
mm for the dilating balloons. 
8) Rotating sphincterotome with bend capability can allow 
for redirection of the wire towards either the papilla or proximal biliary system depending on the endoscopist’s preference. 
9) Stents: both plastic (straight, double pigtail) or metal (covered or partially-covered) can be utilized. The evidence to 
guide stent selection is discussed in a later section in this article. 
EUS-BD APPROACH AND DRAINAGE 
TECHNIQUES
Access
Intrahepatic
The intrahepatic approach usually involves gaining access 
to the biliary system with either a transpesophageal, transgastric, or transjejunal (in altered anatomy) needle puncture 
into the left hepatic system. Biliary segment III of the left hepatic lobe is usually best visualized from the stomach cardia 
or lesser curvature. Most endoscopists performing this procedure prefer a 19 G needled for initial entry as it allows for 
easier wire manipulation, while maintaining transfer of force.10
Confirmation of biliary access can be obtained by aspiration 
of bile and subsequent injection of contrast to perform a cholangiogram. Wire manipulation is a critical portion of EUS-BD 
as it dictates the subsequent route of drainage (transpapillary 
or transmural) and can lead to complications (shearing, perforation) if not performed in a careful manner.11 Therefore it 
is important to thoroughly flush the instrument channel with 
water to minimize friction and allow for easier passage and

manipulation of the wire into the biliary system. To minimize 
complications, the wire should not be pulled back against resistance. Also, the puncture tract should be dilated with a bougie or balloon in cases where transpapillary positioning is challenging and ongoing wire manipulation is required. 
In most cases, the goal of initial access is to allow direction 
of the wire in the caudad direction towards the ampulla and 
duodenum. If transpapillary access is obtained then BD may 
be performed in the antegrade or rendezvous stent placement. 
If transpapillary positioning is impossible, then drainage should be pursued via the transmural route, which requires fistula tract dilation with subsequent transmural stent placement. 
Extrahepatic
The extrahepatic EUS-BD technique entails needle puncture from the transduodenal or transantral route directly into 
the common bile duct (CBD). Some advantages of the extrahepatic approach include better visualization of the CBD or 
common hepatic duct compared to intrahepatic segments depending on the level of the obstruction. Also because the CBD 
is in the retroperitoneal space, extrahepatic access may be a 
safer option for patients with ascites.10 One limitation of this 
approach however is the difficulty of antegrade stent placement due to the angle of needle entry into the biliary system. 
Therefore, when engaging in extrahepatic EUS-BD, the two 
drainage options that will be most likely successful are rendezvous or transmural (CDS). After needle puncture, the same 
steps outlined above can be used to confirm location and direct further wire access. Generally needle angle in the cephalad direction facilitates CDS while the caudad direction will 
allow for possible rendezvous.
Drainage
Rendezvous
The objective of the rendezvous approach is to perform BD 
with a standard side-viewing duodenoscope in the usual retrograde fashion. The distinction from standard ERCP is that 
the initial wire has traversed the papilla in an antegrade fashion via EUS-guidance rather than by retrograde cannulation 
with a duodenoscope. In cases of failed ERCP, if the duodenoscope can be advanced to the ampulla and a wire can be placed across by the papilla via EUS-guidance, this is the preferred method of BD. The limiting factor in many cases for 
this technique is the inability of the duodenoscope to traverse 
a luminal obstruction. When attempting rendezvous, the initial needle angle prior to puncture should be in the caudad 
direction to direct it towards the duodenum.12 Generally, this 
angle is most often achieved with the scope in a short position, 
but may require several tip deflections and scope position 
manuevers to optimize the needle direction. After needle 
puncture into the biliary system, various calibers (0.035-, 0.021-, 
and 0.018-inch) of long (450 cm) wire can be used to pass 
across the papilla into the small intestines.12 Generally passing enough wire to form loops in the duodenum, which can 
be confirmed under fluoroscopy, is prudent to allow enough 
slack to maintain wire position as the echoendoscope is removed from the patient over the wire. After the echoendoscope has been removed and the wire is successfully maintained in the transpapillary position, a standard side-viewing 
endoscope can be advanced to the major ampulla where the 
EUS-placed wire can be captured with a forceps and pulled 
back into the instrument channel. This allows for the endoscopist to proceed with BD in the conventional retrograde fashion, now that biliary access is secure. 
Antegrade
In cases where transpapillary wire access is obtained with 
EUS-guidance, but rendezvous is not possible because of luminal obstruction, then antegrade placement of a biliary stent 
across an obstruction is feasible. Before deploying an antegrade stent, generally the transmural tract must be dilated with 
either a bougie or dilating balloon to allow for stent passage 
into the biliary system. The stent can be placed across the papilla itself or bridge a malignant stricture to provide an outlet 
for bile drainage by reducing the pressure gradient across the 
biliary system. This technique can be performed with or without an adjunctive transmural (i.e., hepaticogastrostomy) stent. 
Antegrade stent placement from the extrahepatic approach is 
challenging due to the angulation of the wire from this position.10
Transmural
During EUS-BD, if a wire cannot be positioned across the 
papilla either due to difficult position or complete tumor infiltration of the bile duct, then transmural drainage should be 
performed to relieve the biliary obstruction. In the intrahepatic approach this requires creation of a transgastric-transhepatic fistula and in the extrahepatic approach a transenterictranscholechocal fistula.11 After accessing the biliary system 
via needle puncture the fistula tract should be dilated over the 
guidewire with a 4 to 6 mm dilating balloon or a 6 to 7 Fr bougie. In the extrahepatic approach, generally a cephalad needle 
entry toward the hilum (usually obtained with the echoendoscope in the long position in the proximal duodenum) promotes easier passage of the stent due to the less acute angle of 
entry. The objective of proper stent choice and placement are 
twofold: 1) to optimize BD and 2) minimized complications 
such as migration and contralateral luminal injury. Thus the 
use of uncovered metal stents is contraindicated due to the 

546 Clin Endosc 2013;46:543-551
Achieving Efficient EUS Biliary Drainage
risk of bile leak and peritonitis. The choice between covered 
self-expanding metal stents (CSEMSs) and plastic stents is discussed later in this article. 
CHOOSING THE RIGHT TOOLS
Because EUS-BD is a novel and evolving technique, there is 
limited prospective data comparing efficacy and safety outcomes using various instruments such as needles, dilators, and 
stents. Most of the published literature is in the form of retrospective case series, thus the recommendations in this article are based primarily on anecdotal evidence and expert 
opinion. More studies need to be done to determine the optimal tools to ensure the best patient outcomes. 
In thinking about which EUS-FNA needle is best for transmural puncture in EUS-BD, the vast majority of published 
cases report using a 19 G needle. The consortium group in 
2011 stated that this is the optimal needle because of its appropriate stiffness, which allows for an effective transfer of force, 
and also its excellent tip visibility on both EUS and fluoroscopy imaging.10 Although the stiffness of this needle may be an 
obstacle in certain situations when needle positioning or maneuvering is crucial to obtain the proper entry angle. In a recent large multicenter international study with interventional 
endoscopy experts reporting their experience in 240 EUSBD cases, over 99% of the cases were performed with 19 G 
needles.12 That is not to say, however, that this is the only successful approach as a recent prospective single center study reported 100% success rate of biliary puncture using a 22 G needle in combination with a diathermic needle-knife.13 As of 
now, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the outcomes of various needle calibers in EUS-BD. 
Newer devices are being developed, such as diathermic needle 
knives with removable inner needles. These devices provide 
pure cutting current to allow for easy tissue penetration, and 
exchange of the inner needle for a guidewire, however the 
concern is for an increased risk of thermal injury.10
In most cases of EUS-BD, except for rendezvous drainage, 
transmural tract dilation will be required. The most common 
tools for this are bougies and dilating balloons. Bougies require manual advancement through the fistula tract by the 
endoscopist, which gives the operator some tactile sense of the 
degree of tissue resistance. This may be helpful as it provides 
the endoscopist with more information and help prevent excessive tissue injury. However, because a portion of the force 
exerted by the bougie acts tangentially to the plane of the tissue, this may lead to increased tissue separation and complications.10 Generally a 6 to 7 Fr bougie is optimal for dilating a 
transmural fistula to the necessary size for further wire manipulation and stent placement. Dilating balloons on the other 
hand transmit all their force in a radial fashion in the same 
plane of the tissue being dilated, thus minimizing the shearing force. The compressibility of balloons to about a 5 Fr delivery system makes them convenient for passing through the 
fistula after needle puncture. However, because balloons are 
inflated mechanically, the feedback of tissue resistance is lost 
to the endoscopist and the results of the dilation are only seen 
after the balloon is deflated, which may increase the risk for 
complications such as bleeding, perforation and leakage.10
These 4- to 6-mm dilating balloons are usually adequate for 
tract dilation. 
The options for stent placement include plastic (straight or 
pigtail) and metal (covered or partially covered) stents. Uncovered metal stents should not be used for formation of a 
transmural fistula to avoid the risk of leakage and peritonitis. 
Uncovered stents may, however, be appropriate for temporary 
placement in mature fistula tracts. Although no comparative 
studies have been published in EUS-BD, CSEMS are thought 
to provide longer patency rates based on previously published RCTs.14,15 Also retrospective data suggests that CSEMS 
may have lower rates of postoperative cholangitis in EUS-BD 
compared to plastic stents, although this needs to be confirmed in prospective studies.12 The concern with CSEMS is the 
potential to migrate, shorten or occlude secondary ducts (intrahepatic radicals, cystic duct, etc).10 Most case series, however, have reported low migration rates with CSEMS. A large 
retrospective series of EUS-BD including 248 patients with 
either CSEMS or plastic stent placement resulted in an overall migration rate of 3.2%.16 Anecdotal tactics to minimize the 
risk of migration include placing a double-pigtail plastic stent 
through the CSEMs.
CURRENT PUBLISHED LITERATURE
Efficacy
Presently, the majority of the reported outcomes on EUSBD are in the form of small retrospective case series with few 
prospective studies and RCTs. However the data, as seen in 
Table 1, is promising as the cumulative success rate for extrahepatic EUS-BD is approximately 93% over the past 12 years.9,17-55 Table 2 summarizes the published literature on intrahepatic EUS-BD, which shows a cumulative success rate 
of 84%.9,18,21,30,32,34,38,41,46,49-51,56,57
There are no prospective studies comparing outcomes between the various possible drainage approaches in EUS-BD. 
Two large multicenter retrospective studies did not show any 
difference in the success rates between intrahepatic or extrahepatic drainage routes.12,16 One of the reviews could not predict success or complications based on gender, stricture type, 
access point (intrahepatic or extrahepatic), stent route place-

ment, thus implying that treatment should be individualized 
for each case.16 Limited study has been performed in evaluating outcomes of EUS-BD compared to other salvage biliary 
techniques such as precut sphincterotomy, percutaneous BD, 
and surgery. One retrospective comparative study revealed 
that EUS-BD had a significantly higher technical success rate 
compared to precut sphincterotomy in cases of failed ERCP.52
Also, one small, RCT comparing clinical outcomes in patients 
having received EUS-BD versus percutaneous transhepatic 
BD showed no significant difference in success rates, although 
patient satisfaction and pain scores were not reported.45 Further prospective multicenter trials are needed to decipher where EUS-BD should lie in the treatment algorithm for these 
patients.

The performance of EUS-BD is limited by need for endoscopic expertise and training along with the appropriate interventional radiology and surgical backup to manage potential 
procedure failure and complications. Also because of the novelty of the technique, dedicated devices have not yet been developed to improve procedure outcomes. There are multiple 
intricate aspects of EUS-BD such as transmural needle puncture, wire manipulation, tract dilation, stent placement, and 
endoscope exchanges that may lead to complications if not 
performed by an experienced, expert endoscopist. The most 
common complications associated with EUS-BD include: 1) 
infection (peritonitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis), 2) pancreatitis, 3) pneumoperitoneum, 4) bile leak/biloma, 5) bleeding, 6) 
abdominal pain, and 7) stent migration. Rare serious adverse 
events include sepsis and perforation. Based on the currently 
available literature the overall complication rate for EUS-BD 
is around 16%, most of which fortunately can be managed 
conservatively (Tables 1, 2). The clinical significance of some 
events such as pneumoperitoneum have yet to be determined, 
and may eventually become expected consequences like when 
performing percutaneous gastrostomy. Very few comparative 
studies looking at EUS-BD versus alternative drainage procedures exist. Two comparative studies have shown no differTable 2. Published Data on Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Biliary Drainage Using Intrahepatic Approach

Achieving Efficient EUS Biliary Drainage
ence in complication rates when comparing EUS-BD to precut sphincterotomy or percutaneous transhepatic BD.45,52 Larger prospective, preferably randomized multicenter trials are 
needed to substantiate these complication rates. 
CONCLUSIONS
EUS-BD is a novel procedure that has been quickly gaining 
acceptance in recent years as an alternative option for BD in 
patients having previously failed ERCP. Multiple retrospective and some prospective studies have shown it to be an effective and safe procedure in the hands of an expert pancreaticobiliary endoscopist. Based on the currently reported literature, 
the cumulative success rate, regardless of EUS-BD approach, is 
about 90% with an overall complication rate of about 16%. 
Although comparative studies are currently lacking, EUS-BD 
theoretically confers logistical, economic, and anatomic/physiologic benefits compared to more invasive options like percutaneous and surgical drainage. Indications and methods for 
EUS-BD have yet to be standardized therefore the approach 
should be individualized for each patient based on the endoscopist’s assessment. CSEMS may result in longer patency rates 
and lower rates of cholangitis based on existing data. Further 
prospective, multicenter, controlled studies are needed to further delineate appropriate indications, predictors of success 
and complications, optimal approach, and clinical outcomes 
compared to other drainage procedures.
