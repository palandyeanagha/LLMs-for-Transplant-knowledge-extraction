Abstract
Background and aim
HIV-infected individuals are at high risk of developing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
a leading cause of end-stage liver disease in Western countries. Nonetheless, due to the
invasiveness of liver biopsy, NASH remains poorly understood in HIV mono-infection. We
aimed to characterize the prevalence and predictors of NASH in unselected HIV monoinfected patients by means of non-invasive diagnostic tools.
Methods
HIV-infected adults without significant alcohol intake or co-infection with hepatitis B or C
underwent a routine screening program employing transient elastography (TE) with
controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and the serum biomarker cytokeratin-18 (CK18). NASH was diagnosed non-invasively as the coexistence of fatty liver (CAP 248
dB/m) and CK-18 >246 U/L. Identified cases of NASH were offered a diagnostic liver
biopsy. Predictors of NASH were determined by multivariate logistic regression
analysis.
Results
202 consecutive HIV mono-infected patients were included. NASH was non-invasively diagnosed in 23 cases (11.4%). Among them, 17 underwent a liver biopsy, and histology confirmed NASH in all cases. The prevalence of NASH was higher in patients with
hypertriglyceridemia (17.1%), insulin resistance defined by homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (25%), those with detectable HIV viral load (42.9%)
and those with elevated ALT (53.6%). After adjustment, higher HOMA-IR (adjusted odds
ratio [aOR] = 1.20, 95% CI 1.01–1.43; p = 0.03) and ALT (aOR = 2.39, 95% CI 1.50–3.79;
p<0.001) were independent predictors of NASH.

Conclusions
NASH, diagnosed by a non-invasive diagnostic approach employing CK-18 and TE with
CAP, is common in unselected HIV mono-infected individuals, particularly in the presence
of insulin resistance and elevated ALT.
Introduction
Liver disease is the leading cause of non-AIDS related deaths in people living with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)[1]. Although this excess morbidity is mainly driven by coinfections with hepatitis B or C virus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly
being recognized as a common cause of liver fibrosis in HIV mono-infected patients receiving
antiretroviral therapy (ART). In North America, the prevalence of NAFLD in the general population is estimated to be about 25%, compared to 50% in the HIV mono-infected population
[2, 3]. HIV-infected individuals have unique risk factors for NAFLD, including long-term
exposure to ART, dyslipidemia, and a high frequency of insulin resistance[4, 5]. Simple
NAFLD is the first pathophysiological step leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a
state of hepatocellular inflammation and damage in response to accumulated fat within the
liver parenchyma. This process can then lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
and liver failure[6]. NASH occurs in 3–5% of the general population, and it is a frequent indication for liver transplantation in Western countries[2, 7, 8]. NASH may affect up to 55% of
HIV mono-infected patients on ART with chronic elevation of transaminases[9]. However, its
true prevalence is unknown.
Liver biopsy is the gold standard to distinguish NASH from simple NAFLD and to stage
liver fibrosis. However, it is invasive and serious complications occur in 0.6–5% of patients
[10]. Moreover, liver biopsy is costly and prone to sampling errors leading to the misdiagnosis
of cirrhosis[8, 11]. As such, it is not practical to be used as a screening tool in a population like
HIV-infected patients, where the prevalence of the disease is potentially very high[3, 9, 12].
The liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) is a validated non-invasive method to diagnose liver fibrosis, with a reported area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 in
HIV mono-infected patients[13]. Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) is a TE software
able to quantify fat in the liver with high diagnostic accuracy. A recent meta-analysis showed
that CAP had an AUC of 0.82 for the detection of hepatic steatosis involving >10% of hepatocytes[14]. However, TE with CAP cannot differentiate between simple NAFLD and NASH.
Cytokeratin-18 (CK-18) is a marker of hepatocyte apoptosis, which occurs in NASH but not in
NAFLD[15]. CK-18 is the most validated diagnostic biomarker for NASH. Only one study so
far has employed CK-18 in HIV mono-infected patients. However, this study was conducted
in Asian patients, where NASH has different clinical characteristics[16]. No data about CK-18
is available in HIV mono-infected patients from Western countries.
In a clinical cohort of consecutive and unselected HIV mono-infected patients without
known liver disease, we ascertained the prevalence and predictors of NASH diagnosed by combining CK-18 and TE with CAP.

(MUHC), a university-based clinic serving over 2,000 active HIV-infected patients. We
included 202 consecutive HIV mono-infected individuals (positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] with Western blot confirmation), who underwent TE examination and
determination of CK-18 between January 2015 and January 2017, as part of a routine screening
program. In order to be included, patients had to fulfill the following criteria: (a) age 18
years; (b) availability of relevant clinical and biochemical parameters. Exclusion criteria were:
(a) positivity for hepatitis C virus antibody; (b) positivity for hepatitis B surface antigen; (c) evidence of other liver diseases (e.g., auto-immune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease);
(d) significant alcohol intake as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
(AUDIT-C) questionnaire, with a score equal or over 7 being excluded[17]; (e) current or past
history of HCC; (f) prior liver transplantation; (g) failure of TE examination or unreliable
LSM. All patients provided written informed consent. The Research Ethics Board of the
Research Institute of MUHC approved the study (study code 14-182-BMD), which was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence and predictors of NASH. Secondary
outcomes aimed at evaluating factors correlating with CK-18 levels and the prevalence of
NAFLD, significant liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Based on two meta-analyses and a study which
specifically validated TE in HIV mono-infection, NASH was defined by the contemporaneous
presence of NAFLD (hepatic steatosis involving >10% of hepatocytes), diagnosed by CAP
248 decibel/meter (dB/m) and CK-18 >246 U/L; significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were
defined as LSM 7.1 kiloPascals (kPa) and 13kPa, respectively[3, 12–14]. The threshold
used to define significant liver fibrosis was histological stage 2 out of 4 by the Brunt staging
system (F2-4), while the threshold for cirrhosis was stage 4 out of 4 (F4)[18].
TE with CAP examination
The examination was performed after 4-hours fasting by patients. The same experienced operator (>500 examinations before the study) performed all TE examinations as per manufacturer’s specifications. The standard M probe was used in all patients. The XL probe was used in
case of failure with M probe and if body mass index (BMI) >30 Kg/m2
. Examinations with no
successful measurements after at least 10 attempts were deemed failures. The following criteria
were applied to define the result of the examination as reliable: at least 10 validated measures,
an interquartile range (IQR) <30% of the median, and >60% success rate[19]. Patients with
known risk factors for a false positive LSM were also excluded[19]. The thresholds for liver
fibrosis were decreased by -1.5 kPa to interpret the result with the XL probe[20]. Given recent
data on the effect of severe steatosis on LSM, we also analyzed the number of cases at risk for
false positivity due to elevated CAP (>300 dB/m)[21].
CK-18 determination and diagnosis of NASH
A blood sample was obtained in all patients consecutively enrolled. The plasma was stored at
-80˚C until used for quantitative measurement of CK-18 levels by the Human cytokeratin
ELISA kit (MJS Biolynx inc, Brockville Ontario, Canada).
Histological assessment
Patients with a non-invasive diagnosis of NASH were offered a diagnostic percutaneous liver
biopsy, as per standard of care. All biopsies were obtained with 16G Tru-Cut type needle. Liver

biopsies were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The slides were stained with hematoxylin–eosin, Van Gieson’s stain for collagen, PAS- after diastase digestion, and Perls’ Prussian blue. All liver biopsies were interpreted by two experienced pathologists. The stage of
fibrosis and degree of steatosis were reported according to the Brunt classification[18]. A diagnosis of NASH was made by the presence of classic histological features including steatosis,
lobular inflammation, and ballooning[18].
Clinical and biological parameters
Clinical parameters included age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), history of type 2
diabetes mellitus, risk factors for HIV infection, time since HIV diagnosis, detailed history of
ART (grouped by class), and alcohol intake. The diagnosis of diabetes was based on the definition of the International Diabetes Federation or the use of antidiabetic drugs[22]. Biological
parameters were collected within 6 months of LSM and included: CD4 count, HIV viral load
(COBAS Amplicor with lower limit of detection of 40 copies/mL), aspartate (AST) and alanine
aminotransferases (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), platelet count, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL),
triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and insulin. Insulin resistance was determined using the
homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index [fasting insulin
(mIU/l) X fasting glucose (mmol/l) / 22.5][23]. Insulin resistance was defined as HOMA-IR
 2, a cut-off point indicative of insulin resistance in other analyses[24]. The simple fibrosis
biomarker AST-to-Platelets Ratio Index (APRI) was also calculated as follows: [100 x (AST/
upper limit of normality)/platelet count (109
/L)[25].
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean (standard deviation [SD]), and categorical variables were presented as numbers (proportions). We compared characteristics of participants
by outcome status using Student’s T test for continuous variables and Pearson’s chi-squared or
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Correlation coefficients (r) were calculated using
the Spearman rank correlation analysis. Predictors of NASH were determined using logistic
regression analysis, which included covariates that were determined a priori to be clinically
important. Results were reported as adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval
(CI). A complete case analysis was used for the multivariate models and the percentage of
missing data was less than 10%, unless otherwise specified. To establish which of the models
had the best goodness-of-fit measure, the corrected Akaike information criteria (AIC) and the
Bayesian information criteria (BIC) were calculated and compared among the models using
the ‘estat’ command in STATA. A lower AIC and/or BIC indicated a better fit. All tests were
two-tailed and with a significance level of α = 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using
STATA 13.1.
Results
After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig 1), 202 patients with HIV mono-infection and without evidence of other liver diseases were included. The XL probe was used in 67
(33.2%) cases, while the standard M probe was applied in the remaining patients. Our TE failure rate (5.2%) was in line with previous studies[19]. Thirty-three cases (16.3%) had CAP
>300 dB/m but only 6 (2.9%) had a LSM in the range of values that Petta et al reported to be at
risk for false positivity[21]. The main demographic, clinical, biochemical and virological characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. There were 157 (77.7%) males,
and the mean age was 53.8 (SD 10.5) years. The most represented ethnicities were White/

Caucasian and Black non-Hispanic. The main risk factor for HIV infection was men having sex
with men. Obesity, defined as BMI 30kg/m2
, was found in 57 (28.2%) cases. Insulin resistance,
expressed by HOMA-IR 2, was found in 86 (61.4%) out of 140 cases where it was available.
Overall, 109 (54.0%) patients had NAFLD, 22 (10.9%) patients had significant liver fibrosis, and
9 (4.5%) had cirrhosis.
Correlation of CK-18 levels with metabolic and biochemical parameters
The mean CK-18 levels in the whole study population was 122.5 (SD 143.2) U/L. CK-18 levels
showed a significant positive correlation with ALT (r = 0.64, p<0.001), AST (r = 0.74,
p<0.001), and GGT (r = 0.37, p<0.001). In addition, CK-18 levels correlated positively with
triglycerides (r = 0.48, p<0.001) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.24, p = 0.03), and negatively with HDL
cholesterol (r = - 0.15, p = 0.05). A positive correlation with LSM (r = 0.46, p<0.001) and
APRI was also found (r = 0.51, p<0.001). CK-18 levels did not correlate significantly with BMI
(r = - 0.06, p = 0.43).
Prevalence and predictors of NASH
Twenty-three patients had NASH, accounting for a prevalence of 11.4%. Table 1 compares
demographic, clinical, biochemical, and virological characteristics of patients without NAFLD,
patients with NAFLD but without NASH, and patients with NASH. Patients with NASH were
more likely to be of white/Caucasian ethnicity, to have diabetes and detectable HIV viral load,
they had longer time since HIV diagnosis and they were more likely to be on integrase inhibitors. They also had higher AST, ALT, GGT, and triglyceride levels. As indicated in Fig 2, the
prevalence of NASH was 3.6% in patients of Black ethnicity, 17.1% in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, 25% in patients with insulin resistance, 42.9% in patients with detectable HIV

Histologic findings in 17 patients with available liver biopsy
Liver biopsies were obtained in 17 out of 23 patients with a non-invasive diagnosis of NASH.
Two patients refused to undergo the procedure, while the other two had a relative contraindication. The mean liver biopsy length was 18 (SD 5) mm. Significant liver fibrosis (stages F2-4)
and cirrhosis (F4) were present in 10 (58.9%) and 3 (17.6%) cases, respectively. Grade 1 (5–
33%), grade 2 (33–66%) and grade 3 (>66%) steatosis was present in 6 (35.3%), 5 (31.4%) and
6 (35.3%) cases, respectively. Liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of NASH in all patients
identified by CK-18 and TE with CAP. LSM had a high diagnostic accuracy to diagnose significant liver fibrosis, with an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.81–1.00).
Predictors of NASH by multivariate analysis
Table 3 reports the multivariate analysis to assess predictors of NASH. The model incorporating HOMA-IR, detectable HIV viral load, and ALT had lower AIC and BIC values than other

Discussion
Individuals living with HIV are at high risk of developing serious liver diseases[1]. Previously
thought to be mainly related to co-infections with hepatitis B or C virus, NAFLD has recently
emerged as an important cause of liver pathology[3, 5, 12, 26]. Our study, based on a cohort of
unselected HIV-infected patients without viral hepatitis co-infection or significant alcohol
intake, shows that NASH diagnosed by the serum biomarker CK-18 and TE with CAP is frequent. Importantly, when available, histology confirmed the presence of NASH in all patients.
Due to the invasive nature of liver biopsy and its unclear clinical indications, data on NASH
in HIV-infected patients are scarce. In our cohort, NASH was frequent, with a prevalence of
11.4%. In North America, the prevalence of NASH in the general population is 3–5%, meaning
that HIV mono-infected patients may have twice the risk of developing NASH [5, 7]. By evaluating HIV mono-infected patients as part of a routine screening program, we have minimized
the effect of a selection bias. The prevalence we report is a conservative estimate as we have not
biopsied all patients, but only those with non-invasive evidence of the disease. Previous studies
have selected high risk HIV mono-infected patients with either chronic elevation of transaminases or hepatic steatosis on ultrasound. This most likely led to an overestimation of NASH
prevalence, which ranged between 53.3% and 63.6%[9, 27, 28].
Our data indicates that HIV-related NASH is both common and severe. Significant liver
fibrosis (F2-3), was extremely frequent in patients with NASH, affecting 42% of cases, as
opposed to only 10% and 5% of patients with NAFLD but without NASH and those without
NAFLD, respectively. Furthermore, liver cirrhosis was detected in 25% of HIV mono-infected
patients with NASH. Considering that the prevalence of significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis

in patients with NASH in the general population is much lower, it seems that patients with
HIV have a more severe NASH phenotype[29]. This may be due to a specific pathophysiology
in the context of HIV and to the presence of multiple, concurrent risk factors including metabolic dysfunction, chronic treatment with ART, and HIV itself[4]. Insulin resistance was
highly prevalent in our cohort of HIV mono-infected individuals, affecting 61.4% of patients.
The prevalence of insulin resistance in our cohort is similar to what was previously published
in another cohort of Canadian patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus[24]. Insulin
resistance was an independent predictor of NASH after multivariate analysis. Moreover, in
patients with NAFLD without NASH it was associated with significant liver fibrosis. This is in
agreement with previous reports where elevated HOMA-IR was associated with severity of
NAFLD and NASH[30–32]. In previous studies, the presence of insulin resistance has been
associated with other metabolic disturbances including glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, and excess weight[33]. More specifically in patients with HIV, the presence of insulin
resistance has been related to the use of protease inhibitors (PI), and HIV-related hypogonadism. Our findings reinforce the significance of insulin resistance as a driver and potential modifiable risk factor for the prevention or reversal of steatohepatitis in HIV-infected patients[34].
This is particularly significant considering that insulin resistance may also be associated with
more rapid progression of liver disease[24].
We confirmed the pathophysiological link between CK-18 fragments and NASH in HIV
mono-infected patients by finding a positive correlation with insulin resistance, triglycerides,
LSM, APRI and ALT. ALT was also an independent predictor of NASH on multivariable analysis. This indicates that liver enzyme abnormalities in patients with HIV and no known liver
disease should prompt further investigations, including referral for TE examination to evaluate
the degree of liver fibrosis.
Our study has several strengths. First, it is the first study from North America employing
the biomarker of hepatocyte apoptosis CK-18 in the specific context of HIV-related NASH.
Second, we included only consecutive, unselected HIV mono-infected patients without known
liver disease as part of a routine screening program. This approach minimizes the risk of selection bias present in previous studies, which included patients with chronically elevated transaminases or fatty liver on imaging. Third, this is one of the very few histologic studies of
NASH in HIV mono-infected patients. When available, liver histology confirmed the noninvasive diagnosis of NASH in all cases. Finally, we carefully ascertained and excluded the
main causes of false positivity for LSM.
We wish to acknowledge several limitations of our study. First, we estimated the prevalence
of NASH based on surrogate non-invasive methods. However, large-scale studies employing
liver biopsy in HIV-infected patients are unlikely to be performed as this would be ethically
questionable given the invasiveness of the procedure, costs, and lack of a clear clinical indication[35]. Indeed, 26% of our patients refused or had a relative contraindication to undergo
liver biopsy. Second, liver biopsy was available only for positive NASH cases, so we could not
account for false negative cases. Third, we did not examine CK-18 in a control population.
Fourth, given the relative low number of outcomes, we were only able to examine a limited
number of variables to avoid overfitting, a phenomenon resulting in poor predictive performance of models due to excessive fit with a limited set of data points. As a consequence, our
results may in part suffer from imprecision of estimates and inability to tease out individual
metabolic components and specific ART regimens that may drive the pathogenesis. Finally,
HOMA-IR was not available in all patients, but its association with NASH was so strong that it
persisted in all the multivariate models we ran.
In conclusion, in this first study employing CK-18 in unselected North American HIV
mono-infected patients undergoing a routine clinical screening, we found that NASH is a

common comorbidity. Given recent recommendations from the European Association for the
Study of the Liver to screen high risk individuals for NASH, we suggest that HIV monoinfected individuals should be considered as a high risk target population owing to the high
prevalence of disease[35]. Early identification of a subpopulation at higher risk for NASH,
such as those with elevated ALT or a HOMA-IR 2, could optimize the use of local resources
by prioritizing those who need further diagnostic assessment with CK-18, TE or liver biopsy.
This may allow risk stratification and early initiation of cirrhosis surveillance when appropriate[2]. Moreover, it could potentially allow targeted interventions to avoid developing a progressive liver disease by ensuring adequate treatment of parameters of insulin resistance.
Future longitudinal studies aimed at evaluating the impact of early diagnosis using non-invasive diagnostic tools and interventions on long-term hepatic morbidity and mortality are
warranted.
