Abstract
The presence of congenital antithrombin deficiency has been
consistently shown to predispose patients to venous thrombosis.
We have utilized the prothrombin fragment F1+2 radioimmunoassay to quantitate factor Xa activity in the blood of 22
asymptomatic individuals with this clinical disorder not receiving
antithrombotic therapy. The mean level of F1+2 was significantly
elevated in these patients as compared to normal controls (3.91
vs. 1.97 nM, P < 0.001). The metabolic behavior of 131I-F,+2
was found to be similar in antithrombin-deficient subjects and
normal individuals. The hemostatic system hyperactivity as
measured by the F1+2 assay could be specifically corrected by
raising the plasma antithrombin levels of the above asymptomatic individuals into the normal range. This study provides the
first demonstration that the prethrombotic state can be biochemically defined as an imbalance between the production
and inhibition of factor Xa enzymatic activity within the human
circulation. It is known that antithrombin and a1-proteinase
inhibitor (PI) are the major inhibitors of factor Xa in human
plasma in the absence of heparin. To further evaluate the
mechanism by which antithrombin functions as an inhibitor of
factor Xa in humans, we studied five patients who exhibited
severe congenital deficiencies of a,-PI. Our results indicated
that the plasma of these subjects showed virtually identical
decreases in plasma antifactor Xa activity in the absence of
heparin when compared to antithrombin-deficient individuals,
but the plasma F1+2 levels in the a,-PI deficient population
were not significantly different than normal. This data suggests
that a,-PI does not function as a major inhibitor of factor Xa
in vivo, and that a tonically active heparin-dependent mechanism
exists in humans for accelerating the neutralization of this
enzyme by antithrombin.
Introduction
The conversion of prothrombin to thrombin is the central
event in the coagulation of blood. This reaction takes place at
an appreciable rate under physiologic conditions only in the
presence of factor Xa, factor Va, calcium ions, and platelets.
During this process, the amino terminus of the prothrombin
molecule is released as the inactive F,+2 fragment in conjunction

with the generation of thrombin. Once evolved, this serine
protease is able to cleave two pairs of peptides from fibrinogen,
fibrinopeptides A and B, which permits the resulting fibrin to
polymerize into an insoluble clot. Alternatively, thrombin can
be inhibited by its natural antagonist, antithrombin, via the
formation of a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex. Although
other plasma proteins are able to inactivate this enzyme,
antithrombin is the inhibitor of primary physiologic importance
(1-3). Other serine proteases of the coagulation system that
are neutralized by this inhibitor include factors IXa, Xa, XIa,
and XIIa (4-7). Each of these enzyme-inhibitor interactions is
accelerated by heparin (1, 4-7).
We have developed a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay (RIA)' for F,+2 which measures the in vivo cleavage
of the prothrombin molecule by factor Xa (8, 9). Nossel and
co-workers (10-12) have established a similar assay for fibrinopeptide A (FPA), which quantitates the in vivo cleavage of
fibrinogen by thrombin. For the work reported here, we have
utilized these immunochemical techniques to demonstrate that
substantial elevations in factor Xa activity, but not thrombin
activity, regularly occur in the blood of asymptomatic individuals with congenital antithrombin deficiency, an inherited
disorder known to be highly correlated with the subsequent
development of thrombosis. This biochemical abnormality
could be specifically corrected by raising the plasma antithrombin levels of the above asymptomatic individuals into the
normal range. We have also compared our findings in this
population with those in a cohort of patients with low levels
of a,-proteinase inhibitor (PI), a plasma protein which makes
a substantial contribution to in vitro plasma antifactor Xa
activity in the absence of heparin. Based upon the accumulated
data, we suggest that a tonically active heparin-dependent
mechanism exists within the vascular system of humans for
accelerating the neutralization of factor Xa by antithrombin.
Our studies also demonstrate that the prethrombotic state can
be biochemically defined by utilizing techniques, such as the
F,+2 assay, that quantitate the in vivo activity of the coagulation
mechanism in the circulation.

method of Shapiro et al. (13) with minor modifications as described
in a prior communication from our laboratory (8). Human factor Xa,
human antithrombin, human thrombin, and human F1+2 were purified
by techniques established in our laboratory (8, 14, 15). Protein
concentrations were determined from the absorbance of protein solutions
at 280 nm. The molar extinction coefficients for human prothrombin,
human factor Xa, human antithrombin, human thrombin, and human
F1+2 were assumed to be 13.6, 11.6, 6.5, 16.2, and 12.9, respectively
(8, 16).
Collection and processing of blood samples. Venipunctures were
performed atraumatically with 19- or 21-gauge butterfly infusion sets
using a two-syringe technique. Blood samples were drawn into plastic
syringes preloaded with the appropriate solutions as described below.
These included: (a) For all functional assays and immunologic measurements of antithrombin, a,-PI, and prothrombin, 3.8% (wt/vol)
sodium citrate was employed; the ratio of anticoagulant to blood used
was 0.1:0.9 (vol/vol). (b) "F1+2 anticoagulant": citric acid 7.3 mg/ml,
sodium citrate 22 mg/ml, dextrose 24.5 mg/ml, EDTA 2.234 mg/ml,
adenosine 1.602 mg/ml, and heparin 25 U/ml. The ratio of anticoagulant
to blood employed was 0.2:1.0 (vol/vol). (c) "FPA anticoagulant":
This preparation was provided by Mallinckrodt, Inc., St. Louis, MO.
The ratio of anticoagulant to blood used was 0.1:0.9 (vol/vol). After
collection of blood samples, plasma fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 4VC for 15 min at 1,600 g and stored at -80'C before use.
Normal ranges for antithrombin, a,-PI, F,+2, and FPA were derived
from data on control subjects. This population consisted of healthy
individuals who gave a negative history for bleeding as well as
thrombosis, and were not taking any medications at the time of sample
collection. A normal plasma pool was constructed by pooling equal
volumes of plasma from these control subjects.
Coagulation studies. Routine coagulation studies including prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were performed
by standard laboratory methods (17).
Immunoassays. The plasma concentrations of antithrombin, prothrombin, and F1+2 were determined by double antibody RIA as
described in earlier reports from our laboratory (9, 18). The plasma
levels of FPA were established by RIA utilizing a kit provided by
Mallinckrodt, Inc. a,-PI levels were measured employing a nephelometric method (19).
Plasma antithrombin functional assays. An amidolytic assay for
heparin cofactor activity utilizing the chromogenic substrate Tos-GlyPro-Arg-pNA (Chromozym TH, Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis,
IN) was employed as previously described (20), except that the heparin
concentration in the diluent buffer was reduced from 3 to 0.5 U/ml.
A ratio of plasma to diluent buffer of 1:59 (vol/vol) was defined as
100% activity. Normal plasma dilutions and samples were each run in
duplicate. The activity of test samples was obtained by comparison to
a standard curve constructed from dilutions of a normal plasma pool
and their respective absorbance readings (r = -0.99). The interassay
standard deviation for a given plasma sample was 2.9% (30 determinations).
Plasma antifactor Xa functional assays. Plasma antifactor Xa
activity was measured in the presence and absence of heparin by
employing amidolytic methods similar to those described by Odegard
et al. (21). Because human factor Xa and the chromogenic substrate
MeO-CO-D-cyclohexyl-glycyl-Gly-Arg-pNA.AcOH (Spectrozyme FXa,
American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) were utilized in our assay
system, it proved necessary to make several modifications in the above
protocols as outlined below.
Assays of plasma antifactor Xa activity in the presence of heparin
were performed by preparing 1/30 to 1/80 dilutions of normal plasma
in buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCI, 0.18 M NaCl, 0.0075 M Na2EDTA, pH
8.4, containing 3 U/ml heparin). A ratio of plasma to diluent buffer
of 1:49 (vol/vol) was defined as 100% activity. Test samples were
diluted appropriately with buffer, as judged by their probable antifactor
Xa activity. Exactly 200 ul of standard or sample was then transferred
into each of two test tubes and prewarmed in a water bath at 370C
for 2 min. A volume of 100 ul of factor Xa (6 #g/ml in buffer) was
then admixed, and a stopwatch was started. After 10 min of incubation,
50 microliters of substrate (I mM MeO-CO-D-cyclohexyl-glycyl-GlyArg-pNA.AcOH, 0.3 mg/ml polybrene) was added to each tube.
Exactly 10 min later, 200 Ml of glacial acetic acid was added and the
contents were thoroughly mixed. Normal plasma dilutions and samples
were each run in duplicate. Absorbances were read at 405 nm against
a blank containing 200 ul of the corresponding standard plasma
dilution or sample, 150 Ml of buffer, and 200 ul of glacial acetic acid.
The antifactor Xa activity of test samples was obtained by comparison
to a standard curve constructed from the known normal plasma
dilutions and their respective absorbance readings (r = -0.98). The
interassay standard deviation for a given plasma sample was 4.8% (five
determinations).
Assays of plasma antifactor Xa activity in the absence of heparin
were performed by preparing 1/5 to 1/20 dilutions of normal plasma
in buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCI, 0.17 M NaCl, 0.0073 M Na2EDTA, pH
8.4 containing polybrene 0.05 mg/ml). A ratio of plasma to diluent
buffer of 1:9 (vol/vol) was defined as 100% activity. Test samples were
diluted appropriately with buffer, as judged by their probable antifactor
Xa activity. Factor Xa was diluted to a concentration of 4 Mg/ml in
buffer. The assay was then carried out in a manner entirely analogous
to that described for the assay in the presence of heparin except that
the final incubation lasted only 8 min. The activity of test samples
was obtained by comparison to a standard curve constructed from the
known plasma dilutions and their respective absorbance readings (r
= -0.97). The interassay standard deviation for a given plasma sample
was 1.5% (five determinations).
F,+2 preparation for turnover studies. Human F1+2 was purified
from 2 liters of fresh frozen plasma obtained from four healthy donors
who had been carefully screened for hepatitis and acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. The plasma was allowed to warm to 24°C and
clotting was initiated by the addition of CaCI2 (final concentration
32.4 mM). After 90 min of incubation, the clot was removed, heparin
(final concentration I U/ml) was added, and the suspension was stirred
for an additional 5 min. Subsequently, F1+2 was isolated from the sera
by DEAE-cellulose batch adsorption-elution and hydroxylapatite chromatography as described by Aronson et al. (22). Examination of a
series of fractions eluted from hydroxylapatite with a potassium
phosphate concentration of 0.35-0.45 M, revealed that >90% of the
resultant material was F1+2 as judged by the sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) gel electrophoretic technique of Laemmli (23). In order to
remove minor higher and lower molecular weight components which
migrated at rates similar to those of prothrombin and F. respectively,
2 mg of F1+2 in 15 ml of 0.02 M Tris-HCI, 0.05 M NaCI, pH 7.5, was
filtered at 20 ml/h through a column of heparin-Sepharose (0.8 X 13
cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The heparin-Sepharose was
sterilized during its preparation, and had not previously been used for
any other purpose. The matrix was then washed with the above buffer.
This procedure was conducted at 4°C. The recovery of F1+2 by
absorbance measurements averaged 90% of the total amount applied
to the column. Analysis of the resultant product by SDS gel electrophoresis confirmed that the minor contaminating species had been
eliminated. The overall yield from 2 liters of plasma averaged -3.6
mg. All buffers were made in sterile, pyrogen-free water, and all
glassware had been autoclaved prior to use.
'31I-F,+2 preparation and turnover studies. Radiolabeling of antigen
was accomplished by the method of Greenwood et al. (24) utilizing 15
Mg of F1+2 and 0.6 mCi of carrier free Na'3'I (New England Nuclear,
Boston, MA). Upon completion of the iodination, human serum
albumin (Cutter Biological, Berkeley, CA) was added to the reaction
mixture (final concentration 10 mg/ml). Separation of free iodide from
labeled protein was achieved by filtration of samples at 15 ml/h
through a sterile column of Sephadex G-25 (0.8 X 26 cm) equilibrated
with 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions of 0.5 ml were
collected in sterile plastic tubes with screw caps and those within the
first peak of radioactivity were examined with respect to their ability
to be precipitated with 10% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid and specific
Factor Xa Activity in Antithrombin Deficiency 827

F1+2 antisera. Fractions were pooled in which the labeled material was
>95% precipitable with trichloroacetic acid and >80% immunoprecipitable by specific F1.2 antisera. This material was frozen at -80'C and
utilized within four days of preparation. Prior to intravenous injection,
the iodinated F1+2 preparation was brought to a final volume of 3-5
ml in sterile 0.9% (wt/vol) NaCl containing human serum albumin
(final concentration 2 mg/ml) and passed through a 0.22-,sm filter
(Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The labeled material was
demonstrated to be sterile by standard microbiologic techniques, and
pyrogen-free by the Limulus test (25).
Each subject was given Lugol's solution (three drops twice daily)
on the day before injection of 131I-F1+2 and for the next 10 d in order
to prevent uptake of the radioactive iodine by the thyroid. Approximately
40 ACi of 131I-F1+2 was infused as a bolus into a peripheral arm vein
of each volunteer. A 19- or 21-gauge butterfly needle was inserted into
a vein on the opposite arm and serial samples of 5 ml of blood were
drawn by two-syringe technique into F1+2 anticoagulant. During intervals
between specimen collection, a solution of 5% (wt/vol) dextrose was
administered to the subjects through this line at a rate of -50 ml/h.
The blood samples were processed and 0.5-ml aliquots of plasma were
counted in a Beckman Gamma 8000 Counting System (Beckman
Instruments, Inc., Irvine, CA). Exactly 0.25 ml of 20% (wt/vol)
trichloroacetic acid was then added to each of the plasmas. The tubes
were centrifuged at 1,600 g for 10 min, and the 1311 content of the
resultant precipitates was quantitated. Pooled urine samples were
collected for each 24-h period throughout the duration of the study.
Whole body radioactivity measurements were made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Radiation Protection Office utilizing a
chair-type shadow shield detector system (26).
Antithrombin concentrates. Antithrombin purified from pooled
human plasma of normal donors was supplied by Cutter Biological.
After the final purification step, the protein preparation was shown to
be homogeneous by SDS gel electrophoresis and migrated as a single
band on crossed immunoelectrophoresis in the presence of heparin
(27). Each unit of plasma employed in the manufacturing process was
nonreactive for hepatitis B surface antigen. In addition, the purified
antithrombin was heat-treated to inactivate hepatitis B virus (28).
Informed consent. All clinical studies and informed consent procedures were approved by the Committee on Clinical Investigations,
New Procedures and New Forms of Therapy of the Beth Israel
Hospital. The procedures utilized in carrying out the 'I3I-FI+2 turnover
studies were also accepted by the institution's Radioactive Drug
Research Committee.
Analysis of data. Estimation of relative immunoreactivity, computation of the slopes of the dose-response curves, as well as determinations of the various associated indices were obtained by a leastsquares fit of the RIA results to a "four-parameter" model as described
by Rodbard (29, 30). Statistical analyses of data were conducted by
standard techniques (31). In most instances, the means are provided
with associated standard deviations.
Results
The hemostatic system activity in the blood of patients with
congenital antithrombin deficiency was examined. Eight
kindreds were available for study where at least two people in
each family had previously experienced thrombotic events.
The clinical histories and laboratory evaluation of several of
these families (Table I; families II, III, and VIII) have been
reported previously in the literature (18, 32, 33). Seven of the
pedigrees exhibited the "classical" antithrombin deficiency
state which is caused by a reduced synthesis of biologically
normal inhibitor molecules (34). In these cases, both the
immunologic and heparin cofactor activity of antithrombin
were reduced to the same extent. Affected members of family
VIII possessed the other major subtype of inherited antithrombin deficiency. This disorder is produced by a discrete molecular

defect within the protease inhibitor. For this reason, the plasma
level of antithrombin in patient VIII-1 as judged by biologic
activity measurement is greatly reduced, whereas the immunologic assay of this inhibitor is within the normal range.
A total of 22 antithrombin deficient subjects derived from
these kindreds were studied in detail (Table I; Fig. 1). The
median age of this cohort on the date of the initial evaluation
was 22 yr. All of these individuals were asymptomatic and
none were receiving heparin or coumarin derivatives. Only
seven of these patients had a prior history of an overt thrombotic
episode. Routine coagulation studies including prothrombin
time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count
were within normal limits in this population. For comparison,
we also provide data on 12 siblings of our antithrombin
deficient patients who possessed normal antithrombin levels
by immunologic and functional assay (Fig. 1). The median
age of this group was 20 yr with a range of 6-55. Plasma

Figure 1. Plasma F1+2 (.) and FPA (o) levels in patients with
congenital antithrombin deficiency and their unaffected siblings. Horizontal bars represent the mean value of the parameter in each
patient group. The mean F1+2 and FPA levels in the antithrombindeficient subjects (n = 22) and their unaffected siblings (n = 12) were
3.91 nM±1.13 and 1.20 nM±0.36 and 2.07 nM±0.92 and 0.837
nM±0.27, respectively. When concentrations of F1+2 and FPA were
determined in antithrombin-deficient patients at different time points,
the value represents the mean of the two determinations.
prothrombin measurements as determined by RIA in the two
groups of subjects were not significantly different from normal
(data not shown). The mean level of F1+2 in the antithrombin
deficient patients was significantly elevated as compared to
their unaffected family members or normal individuals, 3.91
nM± 1.13 vs. 2.07 nM±0.92 or 1.97 nM±0.97, respectively (P
< 0.001). It should also be noted that 20 of the antithrombin
deficient individuals in this cohort had plasma F1+2 values that
were >2.5 nM, while only three of their unaffected siblings
(ages 28, 42, and 55 yr) had measurements above this level.
The mean plasma FPA concentration of the 22 patients was
also significantly increased as compared to their unaffected
siblings or normal controls, 1.20 nM±0.36 vs. 0.837 nM±0.27
(P < 0.005) or 0.969±0.51 (P < 0.05), respectively. However,
if one performs this last analysis excluding the single antithrombin-deficient individual with an FPA level > 2 nM, there
is no longer a statistically significant difference between the
FPA levels in this group and our normal population.
The levels of F1+2 and FPA within the antithrombindeficient population were not significantly higher among those
who had previously sustained thrombotic episodes as compared
to their clinically unaffected relatives. Plasma antithrombin
activity measurements in the antithrombin deficient patients
were tightly clustered from 28% to 58% of that found in the
normal population. Linear regression analysis of the data for
F1+2 or FPA versus antithrombin activity yielded correlation
coefficients of -0.12 or 0.18, respectively. Thus it was not
possible to make any meaningful correlations between this
latter parameter and the levels of either F1+2 or FPA.
The results outlined above suggest that significant elevations
in the levels of F1+2 occur regularly in patients with clinically
asymptomatic antithrombin deficiency, while substantial increases in the concentration of FPA are uncommon within
this population. In order to demonstrate that the level of F1+2
represents a stable parameter that is characteristic of a particular
individual at a given point in time, we have obtained a second
blood sample from 10 of the antithrombin deficient patients
within 24 mo of the first determination. The second set of
values were similar to those obtained at the initial sampling
(Table I). However, we have observed that two of these
individuals exhibit a greater amount of variation in their F1+2
levels when monitored over a more prolonged period of time
(data not shown).
In order to demonstrate that high values of F1+2 within the
antithrombin deficient population are due to excessive production rather than reduced clearance of this component, the
metabolic behavior of this marker was determined in patients
with this disorder and compared to that observed in normal
individuals. To this end, F1+2 was purified from human plasma
and radiolabeled with "3'I (see Methods). The '31I-FI+2 preparations were first shown to be homogeneous by SDS gel
electrophoresis. However, it is also critical that the labeled
F1+2 be prepared in such a manner that the iodination procedure
does not significantly alter the in vivo behavior of the radioactive
species. We therefore conducted turnover studies of '31I-F1+2
in two dogs employing protein preparations and iodination
procedures which were identical to those subsequently utilized
in the human investigations. The radiolabeled F1+2 was infused
as a bolus into a peripheral leg vein of a dog, and blood
samples were drawn through a catheter placed in the jugular
vein into preloaded syringes containing F1+2 anticoagulant.
Within 5 d of this initial experiment, a second study was
carried out employing 250 ,gg of unlabeled protein to raise the
plasma level to -7 nM in each dog. Samples were obtained
at various time points and assayed for F1+2. We had previously
noted that dog plasma gives no immunoreactive signal in the
RIA. This implies that our F1+2 antibody population has
essentially no ability to recognize either canine F1+2 or canine
prothrombin. The plasma radioactivity and immunoreactivity
data were plotted against time (Fig. 2); '31I-F1+2 plasma radioactivity and F1+2 plasma immunoreactivity can each be described by a two-exponential curve, CIeCr" + C2er'2 (35). The
fractional breakdown rate, kB, was calculated from [C1/r,
+ C2/r2]f' (36). The values for C1, r,, C2, r2, kB in the
radioactive and immunologic studies were 0.781, 0.265, 0.214,
9.75, 0.337, and 0.852, 0.334, 0.161, 9.21, 0.389, respectively.
Similar results were obtained in a second animal. These
investigations revealed that iodination did not affect the metabolic behavior of the native F1+2.
Clearance studies with '31I-F1+2 were then undertaken in
antithrombin deficient subjects and normal individuals. The
results of turnover studies carried out in patients 1-1 and V-2
as well as two normal male controls are shown in Fig. 3. The
antithrombin-deficient patients selected for study each had
plasma measurements of F1+2 that were >4 nM, whereas the
normal individuals both had levels of this fragment that were
under 2 nM. No substantial differences were noted in the
plasma radioactivity measurements of the four individuals.
This impression was confirmed by fitting the data obtained
during the first 6 h to a two-exponential curve which allowed
us to compute several metabolic parameters (Table II). In
addition, the number of non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable
counts in the plasma never exceeded 10% of the total amount
present during this period. Whole body radioactivity measurements revealed similar patterns in the four patients, and the
mean number of residual counts remaining in the subjects at
30 h after the initiation of these studies was 23% of the total
infused dose. The amount of radioactivity excreted in the
urine during the first 24 h averaged 63% of the total 1311-FI+2
administered.

Numerous investigators have postulated that a hypercoagulable
state exists in humans for a prolonged period of time before
the development of thrombotic episodes (39). This hypothesis
is supported to some extent by various clinical trials in which
antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications have been shown
to provide some protection against the recurrence of arterial
and venous thrombotic disease (40-43). However, a clear
biochemical definition of the prethrombotic state has to date
proved elusive because of the complex nature of the hemostatic
mechanism, the lack of reliable techniques for monitoring
pertinent changes in blood coagulability, and the almost exclusive focus upon complicated multifactorial vascular disorders.

biochemistry of the coagulation system, a series of highly
specific immunoassays have been designed that monitor the
in vivo activities of various steps of the hemostatic mechanism.
In this communication, we have utilized the F1+2 and FPA
RIAs to characterize the extent of hemostatic mechanism
activity in the blood of asymptomatic individuals with congenital antithrombin deficiency. This disorder represents a relatively
simple, inherited hypercoagulable state, which is consistently
linked with venous and occasionally arterial thrombosis. Indeed,
it has been estimated that at least 55% of the individuals with
congenital reductions in the levels of this protease inhibitor
experience one or more thrombotic events (44).
Our studies were carried out in an antithrombin-deficient
population that contained a large percentage of young individuals who had not previously sustained any thrombotic events.
The data demonstrate that asymptomatic patients with this
disorder usually exhibit increased concentrations of F1+2 and
that the levels of this species are quite stable over a prolonged
period of time within the blood of a given individual. We have
also shown that the metabolic behavior of F1+2 in antithrombindeficient patients with high concentrations of this marker are
similar to that observed in a normal control population.
Therefore, these results allow us to conclude that most individuals with congenital reductions of the protease inhibitor
have excessive plasma factor Xa activity for several years
before the development of overt vascular disease.
The F1+2 turnover studies also permit us to assess quantitatively the extent to which physiologic or pathologic activation
of the coagulation mechanism contributes to the catabolism
of prothrombin in the circulation of humans. In a steady state,
the rate of F1+2 production, F, must equal the breakdown rate,
B. Under these conditions: F (nanomoles/hour) = B (nanomoles/hour) = kB X V X C, where V is the plasma volume of
the patient, kB is the fraction of plasma F1+2 broken down per
hour in a steady state, and C is the ambient F1+2 concentration
(34). Using this equation, we calculate that a normal 70-kg
individual (plasma volume - 2.8 liters, kB 0.365) with an
ambient F1+2 value of 2 nM would generate 2.04 nmol/h of
this fragment. Shapiro and Martinez (45) have previously
determined that the rate of catabolism of prothrombin in a
normal 70-kg subject is 0.104 gmol/h. Thus, the rate of
production of F1+2 is equivalent to only 2% of the normal
daily catabolism of prothrombin on a molar basis. It is also
clear from the above relationships that an antithrombindeficient patient of 70-kg (plasma volume - 2.8 liters, kB
- 0.365) with an ambient F1+2 level of 4 nM would generate
4.08 nmol/h of this fragment which is twice that of the normal
individual considered above. This rate of production of F1+2
is equivalent to 4% of the normal daily catabolism of prothrombin on a molar basis given that the rate of synthesis of
this zymogen in an antithrombin-deficient patient is similar to
that in the normal population (46). These estimates confirm
the supposition of Shapiro and Martinez (45) that the metabolism of prothrombin in normal and hypercoagulable states is
predominantly controlled by general catabolic pathways, rather
than by the conversion of zymogen to thrombin. Hence,
measurements of prothrombin level or clearance of the labeled
zymogen are unlikely to be of any value in defining the
presence of the prethrombotic state in humans.
The infusion of purified concentrates of antithrombin into
two individuals with a congenital deficiency of the protease
inhibitor resulted in the normalization of the plasma levels of
antithrombin and the concordant correction of hemostatic
system hyperactivity as judged by the F1+2 assay. It is of
particular interest to note that the elevated concentration of
the activation fragment in patient IV-1 decreased at a rate
which is consistent with that predicted from our metabolic
studies of this marker once the plasma concentration of the
832 Bauer, Goodman, Kass, and Rosenberg

protease inhibitor was raised to or above her normal value.
Thus, it is highly unlikely that the increased levels of F1+2
observed in this hypercoagulable population are produced
during venipuncture because of the low ambient concentrations
of antithrombin. Indeed, these data directly support the concept
that factor Xa and perhaps thrombin are continuously generated
within the vascular system of humans.
Marcum et al. (47-50) have provided biochemical, cell
biologic as well as physiologic evidence that heparinlike proteoglycans intimately associated with the vascular endothelium
can accelerate hemostatic enzyme-antithrombin complex formation via a process that is identical to that of commercial
heparin. To provide evidence that this endogenous heparinantithrombin mechanism is of critical importance with respect
to factor Xa inhibition within the circulatory tree of humans,
we have compared the results obtained in six antithrombindeficient individuals with those derived from five patients who
exhibited severe congenital deficiencies of al-PI. The plasmas
of these two groups of patients show great differences of in
vitro antifactor Xa activity in the presence of added heparin
but virtually identical decreases of in vitro antifactor Xa
activity in the absence of the mucopolysaccharide. The F1+2
levels, a measure of in vivo factor Xa activity, within the
antithrombin and al-PI-deficient patients are inversely correlated with the in vitro measurements of antifactor Xa activity
in the presence of heparin but not in the absence of the
mucopolysaccharide. This suggests that anticoagulantly active
heparinlike species on the luminal surface of the vessel wall
activate antithrombin under in vivo conditions, and thereby
permit this plasma protein to act as the principal physiologic
inhibitor of factor Xa as well as thrombin.
Carlson and co-workers (51) have noted that metabolic
turnover studies with radiolabeled antithrombin are consistent
with a model in which 10-20% of the total pool of antithrombin
is associated with a noncirculating vascular compartment
which probably represents the heparinlike proteoglycans of the
vessel wall. We believe that antithrombin bound to the vessel
wall in an activated conformation constitutes the protease
inhibitor population of major physiologic importance whereas
the same protein free within the blood is of minimal functional
relevance. Therefore, we speculate that antithrombin-deficient
patients have an insufficient pool of activated protease inhibitor
to adequately suppress factor Xa generated within the circulation thereby resulting in elevated F1+2 values. It is impossible
at the present time to determine whether this increased action
of factor Xa upon prothrombin observed in antithrombindeficient patients originates on the surface of platelets (52, 53),
endothelial cells (54, 55), or leukocytes (56). We also suggest
that infusions of antithrombin into such individuals in order
to raise their levels of protease inhibitor to >70% of normal
lead to the saturation of the heparinlike proteoglycans of the
vascular luminal surface with antithrombin. This model would
provide an explanation for the decrease in F1+2 values which
occurs when the concentration of antithrombin is raised to
70% of normal and the subsequent plateau of this parameter
despite ambient levels of protease inhibitor that ranged between
70% and 250% of normal.
The antithrombin-deficient individuals also exhibit a mean
plasma FPA concentration which is somewhat elevated when
compared to that of their unaffected siblings or the normal
control population. However, the absolute difference is sufficiently small so that a given assay result in an individual
patient cannot reliably predict the presence of the underlying
prethrombotic diathesis. Furthermore, it should also be noted
that no change in the levels of FPA were observed in either of
the individuals who received infusions of protease inhibitor.
Thus, we may conclude that most asymptomatic antithrombindeficient patients will have augmented prothrombin activation
with only a minimal concomitant increase in the apparent
activity of thrombin upon fibrinogen.
Several factors must be considered in analyzing this apparently paradoxical situation. The survival of F1+2 in the human
circulation is quite prolonged as compared to FPA. Based
upon our data, we estimate that the clearance rate of F1+2
from the plasma is consistent with a t1/2 of '90 min, whereas
Nossel et al. (11) have obtained a t/2 for FPA of 3-5 min.
However, it is unlikely that this difference in marker catabolism
provides the entire explanation for the disparate increase in
the levels of F1+2 as compared to FPA. Our previous studies
of patients with overt thrombotic disease suggest that the F1+2
assay is 1.6 times more sensitive than the FPA measurement
(57). The antithrombin-deficient patients when compared to
the normal population exhibited an average increment in the
levels of F1+2 of 1.94 nM. This augmentation in prothrombin
to thrombin conversion could then be expected to result in a
similar average increment in the concentrations of FPA of
1.21 nM. Given that the observed difference in FPA values
between the antithrombin-deficient patients and the control
population is not >0.23 nM, we must conclude that the action
of thrombin upon fibrinogen is markedly suppressed within
the vascular system of affected individuals.
Based upon the above considerations, it would appear that
antithrombin-deficient patients exhibit a selective defect in the
capacity of the endogenous heparin-antithrombin mechanism
to inhibit the enzymatic activity of factor Xa, but not thrombin.
We are unable at the present time to precisely define the
underlying molecular basis for this paradoxical situation. However, two potential explanations can be offered. On the one
hand, Jordan et al. (58) have demonstrated with purified
components that the rate constant for the neutralization of
factor Xa by the heparin-antithrombin complex is 8-10-fold
less than that for the inhibition of thrombin by the mucopolysaccharide-protease inhibitor interaction product. If the two
hemostatic enzymes were neutralized at similarly disparate
rates by antithrombin bound to heparinlike proteoglycans of
the vessel wall, then a diminished pool of activated protease
inhibitor could result in a significant increase in the concentrations of plasma factor Xa activity without a comparable
augmentation in that of plasma thrombin activity. On the
other hand, Esmon and co-workers (59-61) have obtained
experimental data that indicate that thrombin, but not factor
Xa, produced within the vascular system can bind rapidly to
the endothelial cell receptor, thrombomodulin. The latter
interaction leads to a greatly diminished ability of the bound
thrombin to clot fibrinogen as well as an augmented capacity
of the enzyme to activate protein C (62). Thus, this second
natural anticoagulant mechanism could be responsible for a
selective neutralization of thrombin vis a vis factor Xa and
hence could partially correct the ineffectual inhibition of
thrombin .but not factor Xa within antithrombin-deficient
patients.
It is also important to note that reduced concentrations of
antithrombin and elevated levels of F1+2 are not always causally
linked in a given individual with antithrombin deficiency. This
Factor Xa Activity in Antithrombin Deficiency 833

point is best illustrated by patients III-1 and VI- 1, both of
whom had F1+2 levels < 2.5 nM. Several groups of investigators
have demonstrated that activated protein C functions as an
inhibitor of blood coagulation by specifically cleaving and
destroying factors Va (63-66) and VIIIa (63, 65, 67). It has
also been shown that protein S is able to enhance the binding
of activated protein C to phospholipid-containing membranes
and thereby accelerate the cleavage of the above activated
cofactors (68, 69). Therefore, activated protein C in concert
with protein S is able to inhibit the factor Xa-factor Va-cell
surface dependent conversion of prothrombin to thrombin as
well as the concomitant liberation of F1+2 (70). We have
recently observed that F1+2 levels are significantly elevated in
nonanticoagulated asymptomatic patients from kindreds with
congenital deficiencies of protein C (71) and protein S. These
disorders are also highly correlated with an excessive incidence
of thromboembolic disease and have clinical presentations
similar to that of antithrombin deficiency (72-75). Thus, it
seems possible that an excessively active protein C-thrombomodulin mechanism within antithrombin-deficient patients
could lead to a normal level of F1+2 and the absence of a
thrombotic tendency.
In this regard, it is critical to emphasize that most asymptomatic patients with antithrombin deficiency exhibit hemostatic system hyperactivity for prolonged periods of time as
quantitated by the F1+2 assay and yet the documented occurrence of thrombotic complications within this population is
episodic. A compilation of such vascular events in patients
with congenital reductions of the protease inhibitor reveals
that the first attack occurred in 58% of these patients in
conjunction with a process known to trigger thrombosis, such
as surgery, pregnancy, delivery, trauma, etc., and was spontaneous in only 42% of this population (44). The biochemical
processes which are responsible for the conversion of this
hypercoagulable state into an actively thrombotic one are
poorly understood at the present time. One might surmise
that a variety of events could acutely depress the effective
functioning of the endogenous heparin-antithrombin or protein
C-thrombomodulin mechanisms. These would include minor
alterations in the plasma concentrations of antithrombin or
protein C, transient reductions in the levels of heparinlike
proteoglycans or thrombomodulin on the surface of endothelial
cells, excessive liberation of the platelet inhibitors of these
natural anticoagulant mechanisms such as platelet factor four
(76), heparitinase (77), or protein C antiactivator (78). The
acute dysfunction of the fibrinolytic system may also play an
important role in thrombus formation (79).
Despite our uncertainties about various aspects of the
pathophysiology of antithrombin deficiency, it is clear that
most patients with congenital reductions of the protease inhibitor constitute a population with a true prethrombotic state,
i.e., they have excessive production of factor Xa enzymatic
activity with insufficient generation of thrombin to convert
significant amounts of fibrinogen to fibrin. It remains to be
determined whether acute elevations in the concentrations of
F1+2 will have predictive value in determining the subsequent
development of a thrombotic event in antithrombin-deficient
subjects. However, because increased levels of this marker are
normalized by infusions of antithrombin concentrates in this
population, we should be able to utilize our RIA in designing
optimal therapeutic regimens for suppressing the hypercoagulable state in individuals with congenital deficiencies of the
protease inhibitor. Finally, the ability of the F1+2 assay to
define increased activity of the hemostatic system in a population with a simple inherited hypercoagulable disorder suggests
that this immunochemical tool can be employed to improve
our understanding of other more complex hypercoagulable
states as well as to develop effective treatment strategies in
these situations.
