All hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants reported to infect humans belong to the species Orthohepevirus A (HEV-A). 
The zoonotic potential of the species Orthohepevirus C
(HEV-C), which circulates in rats and is highly divergent 
from HEV-A, is unknown. We report a liver transplant recipient with hepatitis caused by HEV-C infection. We detected 
HEV-C RNA in multiple clinical samples and HEV-C antigen 
in the liver. The complete genome of the HEV-C isolate had 
93.7% nt similarity to an HEV-C strain from Vietnam. The 
patient had preexisting HEV antibodies, which were not protective against HEV-C infection. Ribavirin was an effective 
treatment, resulting in resolution of hepatitis and clearance 
of HEV-C viremia. Testing for this zoonotic virus should be 
performed for immunocompromised and immunocompetent 
patients with unexplained hepatitis because routine hepatitis E diagnostic tests may miss HEV-C infection. HEV-C is 
also a potential threat to the blood product supply.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects 20 million humans worldwide annually (1). HEV-infected persons usually have 
self-limiting acute hepatitis. However, persistent hepatitis 
can occur in HEV-infected immunocompromised patients 
who acquire infection by eating undercooked pork, rabbit, 
deer, camel, or boar meat (2–6). HEV transmission through 
blood product transfusion also has been described (7).
The diverse Hepeviridae family, which incorporates 
all HEV variants, includes members whose primary host 
species are terrestrial mammals (genus Orthohepevirus) 
and fish (genus Piscihepevirus) (8). The Orthohepevirus
genus is classified into 4 species; HEV variants that have 
been reported to infect humans belong to Orthohepevirus
A (HEV-A). Five genotypes within HEV-A (HEV-1–4 and 
-7) cause hepatitis in humans, and 3 genotypes (HEV-3, -4, 
and -7) can cause chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised 
patients after foodborne zoonotic transmission (2,6,9,10).
In addition to HEV-A, the Orthohepevirus genus includes 3 other species: Orthohepevirus B circulates in chickens, Orthohepevirus C (HEV-C) in rats and ferrets, and Orthohepevirus D in bats. HEV-C, also known as rat hepatitis 
E virus, shares only 50%–60% nt identity with HEV-A (8). 
The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is unknown; cases of clinical infection have not been reported. The substantial phylogenetic divergence between HEV-A and HEV-C, especially 
in critical receptor binding domains, forms a theoretical species barrier (11). Serologic and molecular tests for HEV are 
designed primarily to detect HEV-A, and they might miss 
HEV-C infections. Therefore, the threat to human health, 
including blood and organ supply safety, from HEV-C is 
unknown. We aimed to prove definitively that HEV-C can 
infect humans and describe the clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, and serologic features of this new zoonosis.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
We conducted this study in Queen Mary Hospital, a 1,700-
bed tertiary care hospital in Hong Kong. We assessed 518 
solid-organ transplant recipients (kidney, liver, lung, and 
heart transplant) who were followed up in Queen Mary 
Hospital for persistent biochemical hepatitis from January 
1, 2014, or date of transplant (whichever date was later) 
through December 31, 2017. We defined persistent hepatitis 
as elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >1.5 times 
the upper limit of the reference level for a continuous period 
of >6 weeks. For patients whose ALT met this definition, 
we reviewed clinical records, ultrasonogram results, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography results, and 
laboratory results to identify the likely cause of hepatitis. We

considered patients to have hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation if 
any of these viruses were detected in blood during the hepatitis episode. In patients with no identifiable cause of hepatitis, 
HEV IgM ELISA screening was performed, in accordance 
with the usual practice in Queen Mary Hospital. HEV infection was diagnosed if the HEV IgM assay was positive, 
and persistent HEV infection was diagnosed if HEV viremia in patient plasma lasted for >3 months. PCR sequencing 
was performed for speciation of HEV isolate. We obtained 
ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board of the 
University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority West Cluster. 
We obtained written informed consent from all patients with 
persistent HEV infection.
Nucleic Acid Detection for Hepatitis Viruses and 
HEV Complete Genome Sequencing
We designed 3 in-house–developed reverse transcription 
PCRs (RT-PCRs) to detect HEV (online Technical Appendix Table 1, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/24/12/18-
0937-Techapp1.pdf). Hepatitis A virus (HAV) RNA and 
CMV DNA detections were performed using in-house 
nucleic acid amplification tests. HBV and HCV viral loads 
were quantified using commercial kits (COBAS TaqMan, 
Roche, Basel, Switzerland; and RealTime HCV, Abbott, 
Chicago, IL, USA, respectively).
We sequenced the PCR product of the pan-Orthohepevirus RT-PCR using the RT-PCR primers. Because 
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of patient HEV isolates clustered with rat HEV-C strains, 
primers for complete genome amplification were designed by multiple alignment of rat HEV-C genomes in 
GenBank (online Technical Appendix Table 2). We used 
these primers for complete genome sequencing of HEV in 
patient feces (strain LCK-3110). We constructed phylogenetic trees using MEGA6 with the general time reversible plus gamma model (12).
Cloning and Purification of Recombinant HEV-A 
and HEV-C Open Reading Frame 2 Protein
We used specific primers (online Technical Appendix) 
to amplify the genes encoding the 239 aa immunogenic 
recombinant peptides of HEV-A (genotype 4) and HEVC. Cloning the amplified genes into a bacterial expression 
vector, expression in Escherichia coli, and protein purification were performed as previously described (13,14).
Antibodies Against HEV-A and HEV-C
Polyclonal antibodies against the HEV-C recombinant protein were raised in mice (online Technical Appendix). In 
addition, we used 2 murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
against open reading frame (ORF) 2 antigen of HEV-A in 
this study.
Serologic Testing
We conducted HEV antibody screening for patients 
with unexplained persistent hepatitis using HEV IgM 
and HEV IgG commercial ELISA kits (Wantai, Beijing, 
China) and detected hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using the ARCHITECT HBsAg chemiluminescent 
microparticle immunoassay (Abbott). HAV IgM and 
HCV antibodies were tested using VIDAS immunoassay kits (bioMérieux, Marcy-L’Étoile, France). For investigation of the HEV-C transmission event, we subjected patient and donor serum to HEV-A and HEV-C 
Western blots using polyclonal antiserum from mice 
inoculated with HEV-C protein and mAbs as controls. 
ELISAs using recombinant HEV-A and HEV-C proteincoated plates were designed based on the method described by Shimizu et al. with modifications (15). We 
set cutoffs and interpreted results to differentiate HEVA– and HEV-C–specific serologic responses (online 
Technical Appendix).
Virus Culture
We selected cell lines A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), Huh-7 
(hepatocellular carcinoma), and Caco-2 (colorectal adenocarcinoma) to investigate whether human cell lines could 
support HEV-C growth. Cell lines were chosen if they supported growth of patient-derived HEV isolates or HEV infectious clones (16–18) (online Technical Appendix). We 
subjected supernatants and lysates to HEV-C quantitative 
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunostaining.
Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescence Staining
We conducted immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue sections and 
infected A549 cell culture monolayers using HEV-C 
polyclonal serum antibodies and HEV-A mAbs. We performed immunofluorescence staining of permeabilized 
infected cells using HEV-C polyclonal antiserum (online 
Technical Appendix).
Epidemiologic and Environmental Investigation
We retrieved organ and blood donor serum for HEV 
ELISA, Western blot, and HEV-C qRT-PCR. To survey 
density of rat fecal contamination and collect environmental specimens for HEV-C qRT-PCR, we visited the 
patient’s housing estate on November 22, 2017. Furthermore, from deep freezers we retrieved archived Rattus sp. 
liver, spleen, rectal swab, and kidney specimens collected 
during 2012–2017 within a 2.5-km radius around the patient’s residence for preexisting pathogen surveillance 
programs and subjected them to HEV-C qRT-PCR. The 
HEV-C ORF2 fragment of qRT-PCR–positive specimens 
was sequenced using additional primers (online Technical 
Appendix Table 3).

Rat HEV after Liver Transplant
Results
Hepatitis E Incidence in Transplant Recipient Cohort
Of 518 patients, 52 (10.2%) had persistent hepatitis (Table 
1). Five (9.6%) patients with hepatitis tested positive for 
HEV IgM; 4 of these were kidney transplant recipients, 
and 1 was a liver transplant recipient. Together with reactivation of chronic HBV infection, HEV was the third 
most common cause of viral hepatitis in the local transplant 
population. Of the 5 patients, plasma HEV-A qRT-PCR 
of 3 renal transplant recipients was positive; another renal transplant recipient tested negative for HEV RNA. We 
have previously reported the clinical details of the 3 HEVA–infected patients (9). Rat-derived HEV-C infection was 
diagnosed in the liver transplant recipient, which accounted 
for 1.9% (1/52) of persistent hepatitis in our cohort.
Patient History
A 56-year-old man underwent deceased-donor liver transplant on May 14, 2017, because of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating chronic HBV carriage. He received 1,000 
mg hydrocortisone and 20 mg basiliximab (anti–interleukin-2 receptor mAb) as intraoperative antirejection prophylaxis and 4 units of platelets (derived from 4 separate 
blood donors) during the operation. His liver function tests 
(LFTs) reverted to normal, and he was discharged on posttransplant day 11. He was taking mycophenolate mofetil 
(500 mg 2×/d), tacrolimus (1 mg 2×/d), and prednisolone 
(5 mg 2×/d) as antirejection prophylaxis. He was also taking entecavir (0.5 mg 1×/d) for HBV suppression; serum 
HBsAg was negative 6 weeks after the transplant.
Routine phlebotomy on July 12 (day 59 posttransplant) 
revealed mild derangement of ALT to 74 U/L (reference 
8–58 U/L). Other LFTs were normal. One week later, there 
was further derangement of parenchymal liver enzymes: 
ALT was 138 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase was elevated to 65 U/L (reference 15–38 U/L), γ-glutamyltransferase 
was 124 U/L (reference 11–62 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase was within reference limits at 70 U/L (reference 
42–110 U/L). Complete blood count showed lymphopenia, 
at 0.88 × 109 cells/L, although total leukocyte count was 
within reference levels.
The patient was empirically managed for acute graft 
rejection with increased immunosuppression using a 3-day 
course of methylprednisolone. Valganciclovir was prescribed for low-level whole blood CMV viremia of 5.31 
× 102 IU/mL. However, LFTs continued to deteriorate despite clearance of CMV viremia and increased immunosuppression. Liver biopsy showed nonspecific mild to moderate inflammatory infiltrate comprising small lymphocytes 
in the portal tracts. There were no viral inclusion bodies, 
and immunohistochemical staining for CMV and hepatitis 
B core antigens was negative. Results of testing for HBsAg 
in serum, HBV DNA in plasma, HCV antibody in serum, 
HAV IgM in serum, and HAV RNA in plasma and feces 
were all negative. HEV IgM was detected in serum collected on August 22 (day 100 posttransplant). Because of 
the serology result and ongoing LFT derangement, persistent HEV infection was suspected. A qRT-PCR targeting 
HEV-A was performed on patient fecal and plasma specimens; HEV-A RNA was not detected in either specimen. 
An RT-PCR capable of detecting all species within the 
Orthohepevirus genus detected amplicons (online Technical Appendix Figure 1) in plasma, feces, and liver tissue. 
Sequencing confirmed that the products clustered with rat 
HEV-C strains.
Viral RNA Kinetics and Effect of Ribavirin Therapy
The patient’s archived serum, saliva, urine, feces, and 
nonfixed liver tissue samples were retrieved for HEVC RNA load testing using HEV-C qRT-PCR (Figure 1, 
panel A). Two pretransplant serum samples and 1 serum 
sample collected on day 17 after transplant did not contain 
HEV-C RNA. The first specimen with detectable HEV-C 
RNA was a serum sample collected 43 days after transplant, which contained an RNA load of 9.48 × 102
 copies/mL; this result preceded onset of LFT derangement 
by 3 weeks. After heightened immunosuppression in July

and August, the HEV-C RNA load in blood steadily rose 
along with ALT (Figure 1, panel B). Variation in ALT 
correlated with the HEV-C RNA viral load by linear regression (R2 = 0.791). HEV-C RNA was also detected in 
feces, saliva, and liver tissue (Figure 1, panel A); feces 
contained the highest RNA load.
Immunosuppressant dosages were decreased after confirmation of HEV infection. However, ALT and HEV-C 
RNA loads continued to increase despite reduction of plasma tacrolimus levels by 55% and rebound of lymphocyte 
count to 2.27 × 109 cells/L. Therefore, oral ribavirin 400 
mg twice daily was started on September 7. ALT decreased 
within the first week after start of therapy and normalized 
within 1 month after starting ribavirin (Figure 1, panel B). 
HEV-C RNA loads also decreased to undetectable levels 
in plasma obtained on February 13, 2018. Ribavirin was 
stopped in April 2018, and HEV-C RNA in serum remained 
undetectable as of August 21, 2018, confirming sustained 
virologic response.
Serologic Analysis
We retrospectively tested all available patient serum and 
plasma samples for HEV IgG and IgM ELISA using the 
Wantai ELISA kit. The patient’s serum before transplant 
was HEV IgG positive and IgM negative. HEV IgG and 
IgM optical density rose sharply from June 27, when HEVC RNA was first detectable in blood, to July 25, when clinical hepatitis began (online Technical Appendix Figure 2). 
Despite high IgG levels, HEV-C RNA continued to rise 
until ribavirin was started.
To characterize the serologic response, Western blot 
using purified HEV-A and HEV-C recombinant proteins 
(Figure 2, panel A) was performed. Two mAbs raised 
against HEV-A were used: 1 produced a band in HEV-A 
IgG blot but not in the HEV-C blot (lane 8; Figure 2, panels B, C) confirming specificity, and the other was crossreactive against HEV-A and HEV-C (lane 9; Figure 2, panels B, C). Polyclonal serum raised in mice inoculated with 
HEV-C protein reacted in both blots, showing that the serum was cross-reactive (lane 7). Patient serum collected on 
day 100 after transplant (lane 1) was tested against HEVA and HEV-C recombinant proteins. The serum specimen 
showed reactivity in both Western blots.
Two patient serum samples, 1 obtained 3 months before transplant and the other obtained on day 100 after 
transplant, were tested in IgG ELISAs using HEV-A and 
HEV-C protein-coated plates. The pretransplant serum 
(Figure 2, panel D) had cross-reactive antibodies against 
both HEV-A and HEV-C proteins (<2-fold difference in 
titer using OD cutoff of 0.3). However, the posttransplant 
serum (Figure 2, panel E) showed >16-fold rise in HEVA IgG titer and markedly higher reactivity against HEVA than against HEV-C (>4-fold difference in titer using a 
cutoff OD of 0.3).
Liver Histologic and Immunohistochemical Analyses
Serial liver biopsies showed progressively worsening hepatocyte ballooning and degenerative changes (Figure 3, 
panels A, B). Apoptotic hepatocytes were identified in the 
biopsy obtained on day 98 posttransplant (Figure 3, panel B). 
Immunohistochemical staining with the cross-reactive mAb 
showed positive perinuclear cytoplasmic signals (Figure 3, 
panel C), and negative control with bovine serum albumin 
instead of mAb showed no signals (Figure 3, panel D).
Genomic Description
Complete genome sequencing of the patient’s fecal HEV 
isolate (LCK-3110) showed that the genome was 6,942 bp

long (GenBank accession no. MG813927). Phylogenetic 
trees of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ORF1, 
ORF2, and ORF3 of HEV strains showed that LCK-3110 
is most closely related to the Vietnam-105 strain (Figure 
4; online Technical Appendix Figure 3, panels A, B), 
sharing 93.7% nt identity. Because no phylogenetic incongruence was found on comparison of trees of the 3 
genomic segments, recombination was unlikely (Table 2; 
online Technical Appendix). To determine whether commonly used RT-PCRs for HEV nucleic acid amplification could detect HEV-C, we aligned published primer/
probe sequences of HEV RT-PCRs (19–22) with complete genome sequences of HEV-A (genotype 1 reference 
strain) and HEV-C (strains LCK-3110, Vietnam-105, and 
LA-B350) using ClustalX 2.0 (http://www.clustal.org/
clustal2/). Alignment revealed significant lack of homology with HEV-C at the 3′ end of either the forward or 
reverse primer for the assays described by Jothikumar et 
al. and Rolfe et al. (online Technical Appendix Figure 4, 
panels A, B) (20,21). Our in-house HEV-A qRT-PCR is 
based on the primer/probe design of Jothikumar et al. and 
was unable to detect HEV-C in patient specimens (20). 
For the assays described by Mansuy et al. and Colson et 
al. (19,22), there was significant lack of matching of probe 
sequence (40%–45% mismatch) to HEV-C genomes (online Technical Appendix Figure 4, panels C, D), which 
most likely would result in failure to detect any amplified 
nucleic acid.

RESEARCH
Virus Culture
We detected HEV-C RNA in supernatants from all 3 cell 
lines (Figure 5, panel A) inoculated with patient’s feces at 
steady levels from day 3 to day 7 after inoculation. RNA 
loads in cell lysates were ≈1 log higher than concomitantly 
harvested supernatants, suggesting successful viral cell entry. Immunohistochemical staining (Figure 5, panels B, C) 
of A549 cell monolayers and immunofluorescence staining of infected Huh-7 and Caco-2 cells (online Technical 
Appendix Figure 5) confirmed the presence of cytoplasmic 
HEV ORF2 antigen when stained with antiserum against 
HEV-C. These findings suggested abortive viral replication 
of HEV-C in human cell lines.
Epidemiologic Investigation
The first clinical sample with detectable HEV-C RNA was 
obtained 43 days after transplant. HEV-C was not detected 
in serum samples obtained before transplant. Serum samples 
from the organ donor and all 4 platelet donors tested negative 
by IgM Western blot against HEV-C recombinant protein 
(Figure 2, panel C, lanes 2–6) and HEV-C qRT-PCR.
The patient’s house unit was located adjacent to a refuse 
chute. He had noticed rodent droppings but had never seen 
rats inside his home. A site visit to the housing estate was conducted on November 22, 2017. Rodent droppings were found 
around refuse collection bins on the ground floor and the floor 
where the patient lived. Twelve rodent fecal specimens, 2 swab 
samples from the drain, and 2 swab samples from the refuse 
room floor tested negative for HEV-C RNA. To expand the 
investigation, we retrieved archived rodent samples collected 
from the area around the patient’s housing estate (≈2.5-km radius) as part of preexisting pathogen surveillance programs. 
Spleen, kidney, liver, and rectal swab specimens from 27 rats 
were tested by qRT-PCR. The internal organs of 1 street rat 
(Rattus norvegicus) collected in 2012 tested positive for HEVC RNA (strain name SRN-02). The ORF2 aa sequence of this 
isolate had 90.9% identity to LCK-3110.
Discussion
Discovered in Germany in 2010, rat HEV variants have 
been detected in rodent samples in Asia, Europe, and North 
America (23–26). Because of high divergence from humanpathogenic HEV, rat HEV has been classified into a separate species, Orthohepevirus C, within the family Hepeviridae (27). The zoonotic potential of HEV-C is controversial. 
Virus-like protein ELISAs show possible subclinical infection among forestry workers in Germany and febrile inpatients in Vietnam, although interpretation of such studies 
is difficult because of serologic cross-reactivity between 
HEV-A and HEV-C (15,28). Immunocompetent rhesus 
macaques do not appear to be susceptible to experimental 
infection with a North America HEV-C isolate (23).
In this study, we detected HEV-C RNA in multiple 
specimens from a transplant recipient. The HEV-C infection manifested as persistent hepatitis, as shown by temporal correlation between blood HEV-C RNA detection and

and normalization of liver function tests with viral clearance. These findings prove that HEV-C can infect humans 
to cause clinically significant illness and signal a need to 
reevaluate the importance of HEV-C as a human zoonosis 
among both immunocompromised and immunocompetent 
patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology.

RESEARCH
ORF2 protein did not protect them from HEV-A infection 
and low amino acid homology between HEV-A and HEVC in critical immunogenic domains (29), our data suggest 
that HEV-A antibodies do not protect against HEV-C infection. The patient’s postinfection serum showed significantly higher reactivity in an HEV-A–specific ELISA than 
in an HEV-C ELISA; the humoral immune responses of 
persons with past HEV-A infection to de novo HEV-C infection are worthy of further study to identify whether anamnestic responses are mounted.
The patient’s HEV isolate had high nucleotide similarity to the HEV-C Vietnam-105 strain. It shared less homology with the North America LA-B350 strain, especially in 
the ORF3 domain, which is important for viral egress (30). 
Interspecies transmission could not be attributed to specific 
viral mutations. Future studies will need to include differences in zoonotic potential between HEV-C strains from 
Asia and the Americas.
The patient’s immunosuppression possibly enabled 
the virus to surmount the species barrier, as described 
previously for avian influenza (31,32). HEV-C infections 
may go undiagnosed because of amplification failure in 
RT-PCRs, which are designed based on HEV-A sequences (online Technical Appendix Figure 3). The Wantai 
ELISA, based on HEV-A genotype 1, was able to detect 
IgM in this patient, but whether the assay is sensitive for 
HEV-C infection or was detecting only HEV-A–specific 
antibodies is uncertain. Therefore, we believe that specific RT-PCR is the most reliable method to diagnose 
HEV-C infections.
Our findings are also relevant to blood and organ donation safety. Because of the inability of commonly used RTPCRs to detect HEV-C, transmission from asymptomatically infected immunocompetent donors may occur, even 
in countries that screen donated blood for HEV. Studies 
examining frequency of HEV-C contamination in blood 
products are needed to quantify this threat.
The patient lived in a housing estate with evidence 
of rat infestation in the refuse bins outside his home. We 
identified HEV-C in street rodents from the area, but the 
isolate was not closely related to the patient’s isolate. The 
route of transmission is unclear; we postulate that contamination of food by infected rat droppings in the food 
supply is possible. Other possibilities include reactivation 
of a subclinical infection in the patient posttransplant or a 
donor-derived infection from residual HEV-C in the transplanted organ. However, we found no serologic or virologic evidence of HEV-C infection in donor and recipient 
serum before transplant. An occult infection in the donated 
liver, which reactivated after transplant as described previously for HEV-A, cannot be completely excluded. Detailed studies are needed to ascertain the route of HEV-C 
infection in humans.
