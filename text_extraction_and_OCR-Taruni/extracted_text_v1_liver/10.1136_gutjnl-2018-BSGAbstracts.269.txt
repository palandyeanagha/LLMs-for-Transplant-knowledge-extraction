linked by a common source of transmission or a shared
behaviour and that this link could be demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis.
Methods A case definition of men, aged 35–75, presenting
with acute HBV, with no recorded risk factors, was adopted.
The PHE Database ‘HP zone’ was used to compile a line list
of new acute HBV matching the case definition within the
undisclosed county, from January 2012 to January 2015.
Inclusion criteria for all cases required HBV core IgM positive
status with clinical symptoms or biochemical markers consistent with acute hepatitis. Data on risk factors was compiled,
as part of routine investigation, from the PHE acute HBV
questionnaire using open and focussed questioning. Serum
specimens on the line list were sent to the PHE laboratory,
Colindale for phylogenetic analysis.
Results 33 cases of acute HBV were identified with 19 men
fitting the case definition. The line list was expanded to
include the remaining 7 men aged 35–75 in the same region
and timeframe who did report risk factors for HBV exposure
(total=26). 6 cases did not have stored serum for genotyping.
17 cases of HBV Genotype A2 were identified, 14 met the
exact case definition with no risk factors with the remaining
3 reporting high-risk sexual activity with men. 3 Cases of
Genotype D were identified, all of which reported risk factors.14 of the 19 cases that fitted the definition described
themselves as heterosexual and married at the time of diagnosis. All spouses tested negative for HBV.
Of the 17 A2 genotypes 16 were 99%–100% identical and
12 were 99.7%–100% identical at the nucleotide level with
one case differing by a single base pair at the HBsAg region.
All cases were of a single, stable strain known as the ‘Prisoner
Variant’, which has increased in prevalence from 1990, primarily in the prison population of north England.
Conclusions The genotypic link of at least 16 cases with a
non-prevalent strain of HBV indicates a common source of
infection. The lack of confirmed risk factors in so many cases
may indicate a shift in the ‘epi-picture’ with new behaviours
making at-risk groups harder to identify for targeted healtheducation or vaccination. The cluster remains active with further cases being investigated.

Introduction Biliary anastomotic strictures (AS) occur in
around 30% of patients following liver transplantation and are
treated by endoscopic dilatation and plastic stent (PS)
insertion. However, AS frequently recur and patients require
multiple procedures. The Kaffes stent (KS, Taewoong Medical)
is a removable, covered metal stent designed to be deployed
across AS.
Methods To examine outcomes in patients with AS, we compared a recent cohort of patients treated using KS with a historical cohort of patients who received PS.
Results The 22 patients (12 females) treated by KS had mean
age 55 (range 22–69) years; 11 patients had DBD and 11
DCD grafts; mean cold ischaemia time was 9.6±3.3 hours.
Four patients had failed previous treatment with PS. To date,
16 patients have had KS removed. The 69 patients (20
female) treated by PS were similar, mean age 51 (range 28–
79) years; 47 patients had DBD and 22 DCD grafts; mean
cold ischaemia time was 8.9±3.1 hours.
AS resolved after one deployment of KS in 14 out of 16
patients (88%) compared to 26 out of 69 patients (38%)
receiving their first PS (Relative Risk of persistent stricture
(KS vs PS)=0.2, 95% CI 0.05–0.74; p=0.016; number to
treat by KS for one benefit=2, 95% CI 1.3–4.0). There were
no complications, including stent migration, after KS compared to 6 (8.4%) in the PS group (3 cholangitis, 2 pancreatitis, and 1 bleeding). All KS were removed successfully,
although 1 stent needed 2 attempts because of wire migration.
Following initial ERCP, PS patients required more ERCPs
(mean 2.71 vs 1.13 more; p<0.01) and 32% required biliary
reconstruction.
Conclusion Our data indicate that the KS is a promising
Method for managing post-transplant AS because the majority
of strictures are treated by deployment of a single stent at
first ERCP.

Introduction Cholangiography at endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), the reference standard for detecting CBDS, is not practicable as the primary Method for
identifying CBDS as it is invasive and has an associated morbidity. With regard to the non-invasive identification of CBDS,
the current BGS guidance outlines pooled sensitivities of 73%,
69%–87% and 93% for ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography
(MRCP) respectively. In this study we report the real-world
sensitivity of these imaging modalities to detect CBDS.
Method All cases of CBDS confirmed at ERCP over 12
months were identified prospectively. The imaging modalities
employed prior to ERCP were identified and evaluated for
the presence or absence of duct dilatation (>6 mm) or intraductal contents (stone or sludge) thereby defining the sensitivity of these parameters for detecting CBDS. 95% confidence
interval (CI) of the sensitivities was calculated.
Results In total, 102 patients had ERCP for CBDS (female
57%) after presenting with pain (83%) and jaundice (45%.
Liver function tests were abnormal in 82%. 48 patients had
CBDS 1 cm (maximum size 35 mm, mean 9.6 mm). All US
scans in this study were performed by sonographers.
