Activation oflatent TGF-β by the αvβ6 integrin is a critical step in the development of acute lung injury. However,the mechanism by which αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation is regulated has not been identified. We show that
thrombin, and other agonists of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), activate TGF-β in an αvβ6 integrin–specific manner. This effect is PAR1 specific and is mediated by RhoA and Rho kinase. Intratracheal instillation
of the PAR1-specific peptide TFLLRN increases lung edema during high-tidal-volume ventilation, and this
effect is completely inhibited by a blocking antibody against the αvβ6 integrin.Instillation of TFLLRN during
high-tidal-volume ventilation is associated with increased pulmonary TGF-β activation; however, this is not
observed in Itgb6–/– mice. Furthermore, Itgb6–/– mice are also protected from ventilator-induced lung edema.
We also demonstrate that pulmonary edema and TGF-β activity are similarly reduced in Par1–/– mice following
bleomycin-induced lung injury. These results suggest that PAR1-mediated enhancement of αvβ6-dependent
TGF-β activation could be one mechanism by which activation of the coagulation cascade contributes to the
development of acute lung injury, and they identify PAR1 and the αvβ6 integrin as potential therapeutic targets
in this condition.
Introduction
Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins involved in 
cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. There are 24 known human 
integrins, including 8 that generally recognize ligands that contain 
an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) sequence. Two of these integrins (αvβ6 and αvβ8) bind the RGD sequence in the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of TGF-β1 and -β3 and activate latent TGF-β
(1, 2). TGF-β is a pleiotropic cytokine that has crucial homeostatic, 
immunologic, and developmental functions. Activation of the 
latent TGF-β complex is a critical step in regulating the biological 
availability of this molecule and its subsequent actions. Although 
there are numerous mechanisms by which latent TGF-β may be 
activated in vitro (2–7), activation by the αvβ6 integrin has been 
shown to be important in models of a number of disease processes, 
including pulmonary and renal fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, 
and acute lung injury (1, 8–10).
It is not currently known how the αvβ6 integrin activates latent 
TGF-β. It is likely that the αvβ6 integrin needs to be activated 
itself, because tissue-specific overexpression of the β6 integrin 
subunit, in the absence of injury, does not lead to TGF-β activation or tissue fibrosis (11, 12). We have previously shown that 
αvβ6 integrin–mediated TGF-β activity is dependent on cytoskeletal integrity. Inhibition of actin assembly by cytochalasin, and 
β6 subunit cytoplasmic truncation mutants that prevent integrin 
interaction with the actin cytoskeleton, each abolish TGF-β activation by αvβ6 (1). Activation of TGF-β by αvβ6 probably requires 
more than simply binding to LAP, as we have identified cytoplasmic mutants that bind LAP but do not activate TGF-β. Furthermore the αvβ1 (13) and α8β1 integrins (14) are both able to bind 
LAP but do not activate TGF-β.
Thrombin, a serine protease that is involved in hemostasis, is 
generated early during acute lung injury and is thought to contribute to increased lung permeability (15, 16). Furthermore, 
thrombin is a potent activator of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 via 
its actions on the protease-activated receptors (PARs). In mice the 
cellular effects of thrombin are mediated through PAR1 and PAR4, 
with both receptors mediating platelet responses and PAR1 being 
the predominant PAR in lung fibroblasts (17, 18). PAR1 is also 
present in lung epithelium and is upregulated in response to lung 
injury (19). PAR1 is a 7-transmembrane-domain G protein–coupled receptor that couples to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gαi, 
Gαq, and Gα12/13 families.
The purpose of the present study was to define a mechanism 
through which the αvβ6 integrin may be activated following injury. We demonstrate that 3 different ligands for PAR1, including 
thrombin, are able to activate TGF-β in an αvβ6-dependent manner, and that PAR1 signals to αvβ6 through RhoA and Rho kinase. 
Furthermore, we show that this pathway is relevant to the development of pulmonary edema in 2 different in vivo models.

tion, we harvested lung epithelial cells from Itgb6–/– mice that had 
been crossed to a line (Immortomouse) expressing a temperaturesensitive large T antigen transgene. To determine whether the cells 
harvested from the lung of the Itgb6–/– Immortomouse were epithelial in origin, cells were assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 1A) and 
phase-contrast light microscopy (Figure 1B). Before retroviral infection with the β6 integrin subunit, lung epithelial cells expressed no 
β6 but high levels of the β4 subunit. After retroviral infection, the 
β4 integrin was still expressed along with high levels of β6 (Figure 
1A). The epithelial derivation of these cells was confirmed by the 
presence of the epithelial cell marker cytokeratin (Figure 1B). To 
determine whether PAR1 was present, Western analysis was performed on epithelial cell lysates (Figure 1C). A band was seen at 
the expected molecular weight in lysates from both β6-positive and 
β6-negative cells, confirming the presence of the receptor. To determine whether this receptor was functional, calcium mobilization 
studies were performed (Figure 1D). The PAR1-activating peptide 
SFLLRN induced a dose-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity, demonstrating that these receptors function normally in 
Immortomouse lung epithelial (IMLE) cells.
PAR1-activating peptides and thrombin enhance αvβ6-mediated TGF-β
activation. The PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN was used to stimulate the IMLE cells in coculture with transformed mink lung 
(TML) reporter cells containing the TGF-β–responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter driving luciferase expression. 
SFLLRN induced a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity in cells expressing αvβ6 that was completely abolished by αvβ6
blocking antibody (Figure 2A). SFLLRN had no effect on Itgb6–/–
IMLE cells, and no inhibitory effect of the αvβ6 blocking antibody 
was observed (Figure 2A). To determine the proportion of PAR1-
induced TGF-β activity that was mediated by αvβ6, a pan–TGF-β
blocking antibody was used. The effects of blocking αvβ6 or TGF-β
were essentially the same, demonstrating that there was no αvβ6-
independent TGF-β activation by these cells (Figure 2B). Because 
IMLE cells are an immortalized cell line that might not be identical to primary lung epithelial cells, we performed the same experiments in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. SFLLRN also 
induced TGF-β activity in these cells, and all TGF-β activity was 
inhibited by the αvβ6 blocking antibody (Figure 2B).
To determine the time course of PAR1-induced αvβ6-mediated 
TGF-β activity, SMAD2 phosphorylation in IMLE monolayers was 
assessed in the absence of TML cells. Thrombin and the PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN were both used to stimulate IMLE cells, 
and both agonists caused a time-dependent increase in Smad2 
phosphorylation (Figure 3, A and B). A slight increase in Smad2 
phosphorylation was observed after 15 minutes, and the signal 
increased over time, being maximal at 4 hours. Thrombin- and 
PAR1 agonist–induced Smad2 phosphorylation was completely 
blocked by anti-αvβ6 blocking antibody, confirming that PAR1-
mediated TGF-β activation in pulmonary epithelial cells is entirely 
mediated by αvβ6.
The protracted time course of Smad2 phosphorylation in response 
to PAR1 stimulation suggested the possibility that new protein 
synthesis might be required. To test this hypothesis, Smad2 phosphorylation was assessed in response to SFLLRN in the presence 
of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Figure 3C). Cycloheximide did not inhibit PAR1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation, 
despite inhibiting total Smad2 levels, indicating that PAR1-induced 
Smad2 phosphorylation does not require new protein synthesis.
PAR1-activating peptide–induced αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation is 
mediated via PAR1. To confirm that the PAR1-activating peptide 
SFLLRN was acting specifically via PAR1, we assessed αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation in fibroblasts that had been stably transfected with β6, to enable subsequent assessment in fibroblasts from 
Par1–/– mice. In WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts, the PAR1-activating peptides SFLLRN and TFLLRN induced a dose-dependent 
increase in αvβ6-dependent TGF-β activity, but a scrambled peptide 
had no effect (Figure 4A). SFLLRN is known to also activate PAR2 
in some circumstances (20, 21), but there was no effect of the PAR2 
agonist SLIGRL (data not shown). Having demonstrated that 
PAR1 agonists can activate TGF-β via αvβ6 in fibroblasts, we stably transfected Par1–/– lung fibroblasts, as well as fibroblasts that 
had been reconstituted with WT PAR1, with the β6 subunit. Both 
Par1–/– and WT reconstituted fibroblasts expressed similar levels of 
αvβ6 after transfection (Figure 4B); however, only the WT reconstiFigure 1

tuted fibroblasts activated TGF-β in an αvβ6-dependent manner in 
response to the PAR1 agonist SFLLRN (Figure 4C).
PAR1 signals to the αvβ6 integrin via RhoA and Rho kinase. We have 
previously shown that the actin cytoskeleton is critical in αvβ6-
mediated TGF-β activation (1). We therefore hypothesized that 
the signal would be mediated via the small GTPase RhoA, which 
is known to be activated by PAR1 and to be critical for active reorganization of cellular actin. To investigate the role of RhoA, we 
infected β6-transfected fibroblasts with adenoviruses expressing 
either constitutively active or dominant-negative forms of RhoA, 
together with GFP to allow subsequent sorting for infected cells. 
Constitutively active Rho induced a large increase in αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activity that was not further enhanced by stimulation 
with a PAR1 agonist, whereas cells infected with GFP alone had 
the characteristic increase in TGF-β activity in response to PAR1 
stimulation (Figure 5A). Dominant-negative RhoA did not affect 
baseline αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activity but inhibited the increase 
of αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation in response to SFLLRN (Figure 
5A). There was no difference in baseline or induced TGF-β activity following transfection of fibroblasts with GFP compared with 
untransfected cells (data not shown). To confirm that RhoA was 
acting downstream of the PAR1 receptor in mediating signals to 
αvβ6, Par1–/– fibroblasts expressing αvβ6 were transiently infected 
with the adenoviral constructs as described. As with WT fibroblasts, the constitutively active RhoA construct was able to activate 
TGF-β via αvβ6 (Figure 5A), confirming that RhoA is downstream 
of the PAR1 receptor in this pathway.
Because RhoA is known to activate Rho kinase, we assessed 
the effect of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on PAR1-induced

αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation (Figure 5, B and C). In both 
IMLE cells and murine fibroblasts, Y-27632 caused dose-dependent inhibition of αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activity induced by 10 
μM SFLLRN, with an IC50 of approximately 0.8 μM. High concentrations of the Rho kinase inhibitor had a small effect on 
recombinant TGF-β–induced TGF-β activity, as measured by the 
TML cell reporter bioassay. Therefore, we assessed the effect of 
Y-27632 on SFLLRN- and recombinant TGF-β–induced Smad2 
phosphorylation (Figure 5C). SFLLRN-induced Smad2 phosphorylation was inhibited by either αvβ6 blocking antibody or 
Y-27632, whereas TGF-β–induced Smad2 phosphorylation was 
not inhibited by either the blocking antibody or Y-27632, confirming that PAR1-induced αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation 
requires Rho kinase activity.
PAR1 stimulation exacerbates ventilator-associated pulmonary edema, 
and this effect is mediated by the αvβ6 integrin. To determine whether 
PAR1-mediated enhancement of αvβ6-dependent TGF-β activation 
would be relevant in vivo, we examined the effects of a PAR1-activating peptide in a model of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema 
induced by high-tidal-volume ventilation. In preliminary studies 
we determined that in untreated mice, 2 hours of high-tidal-volume ventilation was insufficient to increase either excess lung 
water (ELW; Figure 6A) or the extravasation of 125I-labeled albumin into the lungs (extravascular plasma equivalents [EVPE]; Figure 6B). Under the same conditions, intratracheal instillation of 
PAR1 agonist (TFLLRN) significantly increased both ELW (Figure 
6A) and EVPE (Figure 6B), compared with vehicle and its control 
peptide (FTLLRN). Systemic administration of an αvβ6 blocking

no known PAR1-activating effect. αvβ6-dependent TGF-β activity was 
calculated from coculture bioassays with TML cells, by comparison of

in coculture experiments with increasing concentrations of recombinant 
TGF-β. (B) After infection with a retroviral vector expressing WT human

with unstimulated cells. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting

antibody completely prevented the increases in ELW and EVPE 
induced by the PAR1 agonist peptide but had no effect on either 
variable in mice treated with vehicle or with the control peptide.
Itgb6–/– mice are protected from PAR1-mediated ventilator-associated pulmonary edema, and this is associated with reduced TGF-β activity in the lung. 
To confirm the role of αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation in the development of PAR1-mediated ventilator-associated pulmonary edema, 
we examined the effect of PAR1-activating peptides in high-tidal-volume ventilation in Itgb6–/– mice (Figure 7). Instillation of TFLLRN 
followed by 2 hours of high-tidal-volume ventilation caused a significant increase in ELW in WT mice, whereas the Itgb6–/– mice showed 
levels of protection similar to that observed following administration of the αvβ6 blocking antibody (Figure 7A). A similar effect was 
also measured by EVPE (data not shown). To confirm that PAR1 
could enhance TGF-β activity during high-tidal-volume ventilation, 
nuclear localized phosphorylated Smad2 levels were measured by 
immunohistochemistry. In WT mice instilled with Hank’s solution, 
there was very little baseline TGF-β activity, and this was markedly 
increased following instillation of TFLLRN (Figure 7, B and C). However, there was no significant increase in Smad2 phosphorylation in 
Itgb6–/– mice treated with TFLLRN (Figure 7, B and C).
Par1–/– mice are protected from bleomycin-induced permeability changes 
and in vivo TGF-β activation. Having demonstrated that stimulation 
of PAR1 can lead to αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activity and increased 
lung edema in vivo, we sought to determine whether Par1–/– mice 
would be protected from permeability changes in another model 
of acute lung injury. We used the bleomycin model because the 
effects of bleomycin have previously been shown to be mediated 
by the αvβ6 integrin (9). As expected, bleomycin significantly 
increased lung permeability in WT mice (Figure 8A), but this effect 
was significantly reduced in Par1–/– mice. To determine whether 
this protection was associated with a reduction in TGF-β activity 
in the lung, we assessed the presence of phosphorylated Smad2. 
In WT mice, bleomycin treatment significantly increased nuclear 
phosphorylated Smad2 immunoreactivity, but this effect was significantly reduced in Par1–/– mice (Figure 8, B and C).
Discussion
Previous work from our laboratory strongly suggested that binding of the αvβ6 integrin to the LAP of TGF-β was necessary but 
not sufficient to activate latent complexes of TGF-β, implying 
that this process could be regulated. However, until now the

mechanisms that regulate αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation were 
completely unknown. The data presented here demonstrate that 
αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation can be induced by agonists of 
PAR1. We have shown that the signal from the PAR1 receptor to 
αvβ6 does not require synthesis of new protein but is rather mediated via direct “inside-out” signaling. We have also shown that 
the PAR1 receptor signals to the αvβ6 integrin via RhoA and Rho 
kinase. Because of the well-known effects of RhoA in reorganizing actin, these findings are consistent with our earlier observation that αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activity is completely inhibited by 
an inhibitor of actin polymerization, cytochalasin D (1). Finally, 
we show that PAR1 activation in the setting of high-tidal-volume 
ventilation causes an αvβ6-dependent increase in lung edema, 
whereas in Par1–/– mice there is reduced permeability, and TGF-β
activity, following bleomycin-induced lung injury. These studies 
demonstrate a novel mechanism by which PAR1 stimulation can 
lead to acute lung injury.
Although many mechanisms have been shown to activate TGF-β, 
it appears that in cells where αvβ6 is present it is the predominant 
mechanism by which TGF-β is activated under basal conditions. In 
all the cell types we tested there was complete blockade of TGF-β
activity using an αvβ6 blocking antibody, as assessed by comparison with a pan–TGF-β blocking antibody. There are a number of 
possible explanations for how the pathway we describe here could 
induce αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation. One possibility is that 
PAR1 stimulation could increase the affinity of αvβ6 for LAP, in a 
manner analogous to the effects of a similar pathway on the platelet 
integrin αIIbβ3. However, we do not favor this possibility. In contrast 
to the platelet integrin, which cannot mediate adhesion to ligands 
in the absence of external signals, αvβ6 is constitutively capable of 
supporting adhesion to LAP in all of the cell lines we have expressed 
it in. Another intriguing possibility is that a change in cell shape 
induced by Rho kinase activation exerts a mechanical force on the 
latent complex, inducing a conformational change that allows 
active TGF-β to productively contact its receptors on adjacent cells. 
Recent evidence in support of this hypothesis comes from work 
demonstrating the critical role of latent TGF-β–binding protein-1 
(LTBP-1), another component of latent TGF-β, in αvβ6-mediated 
TGF-β activation (22). That study demonstrated that LTBP-1 was 
absolutely essential to this process and that the requirement for 
LTBP-1 could be satisfied by a short fusion protein containing only 
the regions of LTBP-1 required for disulfide linkage to LAP and 
for cross-linking of LTBP-1 to the ECM. These findings support a 
critical role for LTBP-1 as a mechanical tether for latent complexes 
of TGF-β. There is precedent for integrins modulating the behavior 
of extracellular proteins through mechanical changes in conformation. Previous work has shown that the αvβ1 integrin contributes to 
fibronectin matrix assembly by inducing a conformational change 
in fibronectin that reveals a cryptic site required for formation of 
fibronectin polymers (23). Importantly, those effects were also 
shown to be mediated by RhoA.
It is likely that other agonists could also induce αvβ6-dependent 
TGF-β activation, but none has yet been described. Our data demonstrate that Par1–/– fibroblasts, although unable to respond to 
PAR1 agonists, have a background level of αvβ6-dependent TGF-β
activation similar to that seen in WT fibroblasts and Par1–/– fibroblasts reconstituted with PAR1. Although the cause of this background αvβ6-dependent TGF-β activity is unclear, it is of note 
that it is much greater in fibroblasts than in IMLE cells, and not 
observed in polarized cultures of normal bronchial epithelial cells. 
It is possible that other activators of Rho kinase may be contributing to this observed baseline TGF-β activation, since the inhibitor 
of Rho kinase reduced baseline TGF-β activity.
PAR1 is a G protein–coupled receptor that couples to the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13. The G proteins 
Gα12 and Gα13 are known to be critical in thrombin-induced 
RhoA activation in platelets (24) and have been shown to activate 
RhoA downstream of other receptors, such as lysophosphatidic 
acid receptors (25). Recently, Gα13 has been shown to be the 
critical effector of agonist-induced platelet shape change and, by 
extension, RhoA activation in platelets (26). In astrocytes Gα12 
has been shown to be crucial in thrombin-mediated Rho-dependent cytoskeletal changes (27). To what extent these differences are 
cell type specific or reflect redundancy remains uncertain. Based 
on these results in other cells, we speculate that PAR1 signals via 
either Gα12 or Gα13 to induce αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation.

Our data demonstrate that PAR1 can cause increased lung edema 
when the lungs are ventilated at high tidal volumes, and that this 
effect is mediated by the αvβ6 integrin. However, when the lungs 
are not mechanically ventilated, PAR1 stimulation has little effect 
(data not shown). This suggests that in the absence of mechanical 
ventilation, any increase in TGF-β activity induced by PAR1 is not 
sufficient to cause pulmonary edema. It is possible that in vivo in 
the normal lung, PAR1 is only able to mediate enough intracellular 
“pull” to activate TGF-β in combination with the extracellular 
stretch caused by large-tidal-volume ventilation. We have previously shown that activation of TGF-β by αvβ6 requires binding 
of the integrin to the LAP of the small latent complex and direct 
cell-cell contact between cells expressing the integrin and cells 
expressing the TGF-β receptor (1), which implies very tight spatial 
control of this system. It is also possible that ventilation may lead 
to redistribution of αvβ6 or the TGF-β receptor, thus permitting 
PAR1-induced αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation to occur.
We also show that PAR1 plays a physiological role in the induction of acute lung injury. Like mice lacking the αvβ6 integrin, 
mice lacking PAR1 are significantly protected from the increase 
in lung edema induced by intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. 
In murine models, activation of TGF-β by αvβ6 is important in 
the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and pulmonary and renal 
fibrosis, but until now the mechanisms by which this process is 
regulated have been poorly understood. Here we show, for the 
first time to our knowledge, that a receptor for thrombin, a molecule that is important in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury, 
induces αvβ6-mediated TGF-β activation in epithelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the signal is a direct “inside-out” 
signal mediated via the small GTPase RhoA and its downstream 
effector Rho kinase. Finally, we show that during mechanical 
ventilation, PAR1 stimulation is able to exacerbate lung injury 
by increasing lung permeability, whereas the absence of PAR1 
protects against acute lung injury and reduces TGF-β activation. 
These data illustrate a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of 
both ventilator-associated and acute lung injury. These results 
suggest that targeting the αvβ6 integrin, PAR1, or its downstream 
effectors RhoA and Rho kinase could be an effective intervention 
in acute lung injury or other disorders in which αvβ6-mediated 
TGF-β activation plays an important role.
Methods
Cell lines, antibodies, and reagents. The Par1–/– fibroblasts were a gift of Shaun 
Coughlin (University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA) (17). Adenoviruses encoding either constitutively active (RhoA 
G-V14) or dominant-negative (RhoA T-N19) forms of RhoA that also 
express enhanced GFP were generated as previously described (28). The 
proximal large airway epithelial (normal human bronchial epithelial) cells 
were obtained commercially from Cambrex, and the TML epithelial reporter 
cells stably expressing firefly luciferase under the control of a TGF-β–sensitive portion of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter were a gift 
from Dan Rifkin (New York University, New York, New York, USA). The 
αvβ6 blocking antibody 3G9 (29) was provided by Paul Weinreb and Shelia 
Violette (Biogen Idec). All other reagents were commercially obtained. The 
antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti–TGF-β (clone 1D11; R&D 
Systems), rat polyclonal anti–β4 integrin subunit (BD), mouse monoclonal 
anti-pancytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich), mouse monoclonal anti-PAR1 (BD), 
and rabbit polyclonal anti–phospho-Smad2 and anti–total Smad2 (Cell 
Signaling Technology). The stimulants used were thrombin (Amersham 
Biosciences); the PAR1 agonist peptides SFLLRN, FSLLRN, TFLLRN, and 
FTLLRN (Anaspec); and TGF-β1 (R&D Systems). Inhibitors used were the 
Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and cycloheximide (Calbiochem).
Generation of IMLE cells. The Immortomouse (Charles River Laboratories) is transgenic for a ubiquitously expressed temperature-sensitive SV40 
large T antigen to permit propagation of immortalized cells at permissive 
temperatures (33°C) and reversion to their primary phenotype at nonpermissive temperatures (39°C). The Immortomouse was bred with the 
Itgb6–/– mouse, and isolation of mouse lung epithelial cells was performed. 
Briefly, adult Itgb6–/– Immortomice were sacrificed (50 mg/ml Nembutal 
and 1,000 U/ml heparin) and their lungs perfused with Krebs (–) buffer 
(133 mM NaCl, 5.2 mM KCl, 2.59 mM Na2PO4, 10.3 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM 
EGTA, 5 mM glucose). The lungs were removed en bloc and lavaged 8 times 
with Krebs (–) followed by 2 times with Krebs (+) buffer (133 mM NaCl, 
5.2 mM KCl, 2.59 mM Na2PO4, 10.3 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 1.89 mM 
CaCl2, 1.29 mM MgSO4). The lungs were digested by intratracheal instillation of 40 ml of 4.3 U/ml elastase in Krebs (+) buffer for 30 minutes at 
37°C. The airways were dissected and the lungs minced in 2 mg DNase I 
(Sigma-Aldrich) before elastase inactivation with 10% FCS in DMEM. The 
minced lungs were sequentially filtered before cell culture propagation at 
the permissive temperature of 33°C. To remove any contaminating fibroblasts, cells underwent positive selection using an anti–β4 integrin antibody by fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described below.
Generation of stable cell lines. IMLE cells and mouse fibroblasts were infected with WT human β6 subunit in the retroviral vector pWZL. Retroviruses 
were generated by Lipofectamine-mediated (Invitrogen) transfection of the 
thi-ε replication-incompetent ectropic virus packaging cell line. The viruscontaining supernatant was harvested and filtered through a 0.22-μM filter and then added to 50% confluent cultures in the presence of 5 μg/ml 
Polybrene and cultured for 24 hours. The virus-containing medium was 
removed, and cells were cultured in 5% DMEM-FCS containing 5 μg/ml 
blasticidin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells expressing the αvβ6 integrin were identified by flow cytometry with the anti-αvβ6 antibody 3G9. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed to isolate populations of cells with high 
levels of αvβ6 on their surface. All cell lines continuously expressed high 
surface levels of αvβ6 as determined by flow cytometry with 3G9.
Adenoviral infection. Adenoviruses were amplified by infection of AD293 
cells (Invitrogen) with crude viral lysate. AD293 cells were observed under 
inverse fluorescence microscopy. When all cells were expressing GFP and 
showing cytopathic effects, they were harvested with normal growth media 
as crude viral lysate. The lysate underwent a single freeze-thaw cycle before 
40-μm filtration. Fibroblasts were cultured as described and, before reaching confluence, were harvested by trypsinization. The fibroblasts were 
then resuspended with adenovirus-containing media (10:1 ratio of normal growth medium to crude viral lysate) for 2 hours. The medium was 
replaced with normal growth medium, and cells were replated on tissue 
culture–treated 10-cm dishes for 16 hours before cell sorting.
Flow cytometry. Cultured cells were harvested by trypsinization. Nonspecific binding was blocked with normal goat serum at 4°C for 20 minutes. 
Cells were then incubated with primary antibody for 20 minutes at 4°C, followed by secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with PE (Chemicon International). Between incubations, cells were washed twice with PBS. 
Stained cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and the fluorescence was 
quantified on 10,000 cells with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD).
Calcium mobilization assay. Cultured cells were harvested by enzyme-free 
cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen), and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells 
were resuspended at 2 × 106 per milliliter in RPMI containing 25 mM 
HEPES and 1 mg/ml BSA supplemented with 5% cell dissociation buffer, 
and loaded with the calcium indicator fluo-4AM (Invitrogen) at a final 
concentration of 10 μM for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were 
washed twice by centrifugation and resuspended in indicator-free RPMI

for a further 30 minutes to allow complete de-esterification of intracellular 
acetoxymethyl esters. Fluorescence measurements, reflecting elevations of 
intracellular calcium, were conducted at 24°C using a GENios Pro microplate reader (Tecan), with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission recorded at 530 nm. Fluorescence signals caused by test agonists were 
compared with fluorescence peak heights of replicate cell suspensions 
treated with 10 μM of ionophore A23187 (Sigma-Aldrich)
TML cell assay. Experimental cell lines were plated at 2.5 × 104 cells per milliliter in 10% DMEM-FCS for 4 hours to allow adhesion and cell spreading. 
This medium was then changed to serum-free DMEM overnight. Immediately after sorting, cells infected with GFP-tagged constructs were plated 
at 4 × 104 in serum-free media for 4 hours before stimulation and TGF-β
activity assessments. TML cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in serum-free DMEM at 5 × 105 cells per milliliter. An aliquot of 
TML cells was removed and mixed with αvβ6 or TGF-β antibody. The medium was then removed from the experimental cells, and an equal volume 
(100 μl) of TML cells (with or without antibodies) and medium containing 
experimental stimulant or inhibitor was added. The coculture proceeded 
overnight, and cells were washed once in PBS before cell lysis for 20 minutes 
at 4°C in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The cell layer was agitated with a 
pipette and centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was 
added to luciferin assay buffer (Promega) and the luminescence measured 
at 24°C in a GENios Pro microplate reader (Tecan).
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed on ice for 20 minutes in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVaO3, 1 mM 
EDTA, 1 μM PMSF glycerol, 1% vol/vol Triton X-100, 0.1% vol/vol sodium 
dodecyl sulfate, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Total 
protein was measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology). Approximately 100 μg of protein was fractionated by SDS-PAGE, 
transferred onto PVDF membranes (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Biosciences), and incubated with blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk in 
Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST) (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% 
Tween-20, pH 7.4) for 1 hour. For examination of Smad2 phosphorylation, 
membranes were incubated with a phospho-Smad2 polyclonal rabbit antimouse antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) in 5% skimmed milk TBST 
overnight at 4°C. All blots were then washed with TBST and incubated for 
1 hour at room temperature with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. After 
further washing in TBST, immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL 
(Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For 
examination of total Smad2 levels, the blots were stripped using Restore 
stripping buffer (Pierce Biotechnology) for 30 minutes at room temperature 
before immunoblotting using a total-Smad2 polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse 
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and the protocol described above.
Immunocytochemistry. Immortomouse cells were grown on coverslips 
coated with 10 μg/ml collagen (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 minutes in 0.5% Triton X-100. 
The cell layer was washed twice with PBS before blocking of nonspecific 
binding with Mouse-on-Mouse blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) or 
normal goat serum for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing twice in 
PBS, FITC-labeled primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at a 1:20 
dilution for 2 hours at room temperature. The cell layer was then incubated 
with 1:10,000 DAPI for 10 minutes and washed twice with PBS before airdrying and mounting. Immunofluorescence was visualized by microscopy 
(Leica DM5000B; Leica Microsystems).
Ventilator-induced pulmonary edema model. Itgb6–/– and WT control mice 
were bred at UCSF, and C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from 
Jackson Laboratory. All experiments were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were injected i.p. with either 
anti-αvβ6 mAb 3G9 (1 mg/kg; Biogen Idec) or control antibody (1E6) 16 
hours before the experiment. Mice were anesthetized with i.p. ketamine 
(90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and HBSS (25 ml), TFLLRN (25 mM, 
25 ml), or FTLLRN (25 mM, 25 ml) was instilled into the trachea. Twentyfive minutes later, the trachea was cannulated with a PE-90 cannula, and 
mice were ventilated using a previously validated protocol with minor 
modifications (30). Briefly, mice were ventilated with room air at a tidal 
volume of 24 ml/kg, at a frequency of 40 strokes per minute, by a rodent 
respirator (Harvard Apparatus). Mice were given an i.p. injection of 0.9% 
saline (0.01 ml/g/h) to maintain stable hemodynamics. Body temperature 
was maintained at 37°C with a heating pad and monitored by a rectal thermometer (Fisher Scientific). The right jugular vein was catheterized for 
administration of radioactive label (0.05 μCi 125I-albumin; Iostex Diagnostics Inc.) to evaluate lung vascular permeability.
Bleomycin model of acute lung injury. WT and Par1–/– mice were bred at 
University College London. All animal studies were approved by the University College London Biological Services Ethical Review Committee 
and licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, Home 
Office, London, United Kingdom. Mice (8 weeks old) were anesthetized 
with inhaled halothane (3%) in a stream of oxygen (2 l/min). Mice received 
a single intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (0.05 IU in 50 μl sterile 
saline; Kyowa-Hakko) or saline alone. We have previously shown that αvβ6
integrin–mediated lung permeability changes are maximal at 5 days (9); 
therefore animals were terminally anesthetized, using an i.p. injection of 
100 μl of pentobarbitone sodium (200 mg/ml; sanofi aventis), at this time 
point. Lungs and blood were removed for permeability measurements as 
described below. For analysis of TGF-β, the pulmonary vasculature was 
perfused with PBS and the lungs were inflated by intratracheal instillation 
of 4% paraformaldehyde at 20 cm H2O. The heart and lungs were removed 
en bloc, immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C, and processed to paraffin wax.
Measurement of ELW and lung extravascular plasma equivalents. The mice 
were sacrificed after 2 hours of high-tidal-volume ventilation. The lungs 
were removed, counted in a gamma counter (Packard; PerkinElmer), 
weighed, and homogenized after addition of 1 ml of distilled water. Blood 
was collected through right ventricular puncture. The lung homogenate 
was weighed and an aliquot centrifuged (16,000 g, 8 minutes) for assay 
of hemoglobin concentration in the supernatant. A second aliquot of 
homogenate, supernatant, and blood was weighed and then desiccated in 
an oven (60°C for 24 hours) for gravimetric determination of ELW. The 
lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (lung W/D ratio) was calculated by a standard formula (9). ELW was calculated using the following formula: (lung 
W/D ratioexperimental × lung dry weightexperimental) – (lung W/D rationormal ×
lung dry weightexperimental) × 1,000. Lung extravascular plasma equivalents 
(EVPE; index of lung vascular permeability) were calculated as the counts 
of 125I-albumin in the lung tissue divided by the counts of 125I-albumin 
in the plasma (9).
Measurement of in vivo TGF-β activity. Five-micrometer-thick lung tissue 
sections were cut, dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol, and washed in Tris-buffered saline. Antigens were 
unmasked by microwaving of sections in 10 mmol/l citrate buffer, pH 6.0 
(twice for 10 minutes), and immunostaining was undertaken using the 
avidin-biotinylated enzyme complex method (Vector Laboratories) with 
antibodies against phospho-Smad2 at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, and 
equivalent concentrations of polyclonal nonimmune IgG controls. After 
incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and subsequently with streptavidin solution, color development was performed using 
3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Vector Laboratories). Sections 
were counterstained using Gill-2 hematoxylin (Thermo Electron Corp.). In 
order to quantify TGF-β activity, cells with nuclear localized immunostain 
were counted. Three random sections of lung parenchyma were assessed at 
high power for each of the 5 lobes of each mouse.
