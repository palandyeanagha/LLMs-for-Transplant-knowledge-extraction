A B S T R A C T The serum bactericidal activity (SBA)
of cirrhotic patients was compared with that of normal
individuals using the release of 51Cr from radiolabeled
Escherichia coli as the assay method. 80% (22/27) of
patients were found to have deficient SBA against at
least one of three smooth, serum-sensitive test strains
ofE. coli. Cirrhotic patients were found to have normal
levels of serum lysozyme. Although some patients were
mildly hypocomplementemic, this abnormality did not
correlate with the presence of a bactericidal defect.
Bactericidal antibody in normal and cirrhotics' sera was
limited to the immunoglobulin (Ig)M class. Purified
IgM from patients with deficient SBA against E. coli
0111 had lower concentrations of bactericidal antibody
for that E. coli than did IgM from normal sera; the calculated bactericidal activity of total serum IgM was also
lower. The bactericidal defect in cirrhotic serum could
be completely corrected by either human antiserum to
the homologous strain of E. coli or by purified, normal
human IgM. However, because higher concentrations
of IgM were required to restore normal SBA to a cirrhotic's serum than to agammaglobulinemic serum,
there may be an inhibitor of bactericidal antibody in
addition to a deficiency of bactericidal IgM antibody to
E. coli in the serum of patients with cirrhosis. The
bactericidal activity of the alternative complement
pathway was also assessed. Sera from cirrhotic patients
had no deficit in SBA attributable to the alternative
complement pathway. In fact, in some, the activity of
the alternative complement pathway was supernormal, compensating in part for the deficit in IgMmediated SBA.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with Laennec's cirrhosis are unusually susceptible to infections with Gram-negative bacilli: the
syndromes of spontaneous peritonitis and spontaneous
colon bacillus bacteremia are commonly associated
with this disease (1-4). The high incidence of infection
with both commensal and uncommonly isolated Gramnegative bacteria (5, 6) suggests that patients with cirrhosis have abnormalities in their host defenses against
Gram-negative bacteria. Although the presence of
ascites itself may contribute to the high incidence of
peritonitis and bacteremia, the high frequency of infections at other sites in patients with Laennec's cirrhosis
suggests a more general abnormality in host defenses.
Defective chemotaxis because of a circulating inhibitor
is, to date, the only such abnormality of host defenses
that has been documented (7). In the presence ofcirrhosis, clearance of radioactive particles by the liver is
abnormal (8), but it has not been shown that the clearance of bacteria is similarly depressed.
Normal serum is bactericidal for a wide variety of
Gram-negative bacteria (9); normal bactericidal activity
may be an important host defense against tissue invasion
and septicemia (10). However, serum bactericidal activity has not been systematically studied in patients
with cirrhosis. In this paper we report that the majority
ofpatients with severe cirrhosis have diminished serum
bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli. This abnormality is associated with decreased immunoglobulin
(Ig)M bactericidal activity and not with deficiencies of
complement of lysozyme.
METHODS
Patients. All patients studied were hospitalized at the
Veterans Administration Hospital, San Diego because of ad912 The Journal of Clinical Investigation Volume 63 May 1979 912-921

vanced liver disease. All patients had ascites and(or) pedal
edema. None of the patients had received blood transfusions
in the month before the study, and none was infected or receiving systemic antibiotics. The diagnosis of Laennec's cirrhosis was confirmed by biopsy or autopsy in 50% of the patients. One patient had biliary cirrhosis. The majority of the
patients had evidence of diminished hepatic protein synthesis,
such as hypoalbuminemia and prolonged prothrombin time.
Hyperglobulinemia, which is characteristic of this disease, was found in one-half of the patients. Many also had
hyperbilirubinemia.
Control serum was obtained from healthy volunteers who
were in their third or fourth decade of life. Sera from 10 individuals were combined to make a serum pool. Serum from
patients and the control serum pool were frozen at -70° in 1-ml
aliquots.
Bacteria. E. coli 0111:B4 is a smooth, serum-sensitive,
laboratory strain. E. coli 06 was isolated from the urine of a
patient with pyelonephritis, and E. coli 04 was isolated from
the blood of a patient with Laennec's cirrhosis. Both of the
clinical isolates are smooth, serum-sensitive, motile organisms.
Their K and H antigens have not been characterized. All bacteria were stored in trypticase soy broth at -700.
Bactericidal assay. Bactericidal activity was determined
by measuring the release of 5'Cr from bacteria as previously
described (11). For each experiment, 1 ml of the frozen stock
was added to 10 ml of trypticase soy broth and grown overnight at 37°C. 0.1 ml of the overnight growth was subcultured
into 50 ml of trypticase soy broth and incubated in a shaking
water bath at 37°C for 150 min before labeling with 5'Cr.
The exponentially growing bacteria were then labeled with
150 ,uCi 5'Cr (as sodium chromate, Amersham Corp., Arlington
Heights, Ill.) for 45 min at 370C, washed free of unbound
radioactivity with cold, 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS),' pH 7.4, and then resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 2-5 x 10' colony-forming units per milliliter. The
serum to be tested was mixed with the bactericidal suspension
in a ratio of 9:1 (vol/vol) and incubated at 370C. Aliquots were
removed at intervals and filtered through 0.45-micron filters
(HAWP, Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.). As a control for nonspecific release of 5'Cr, labeled bacteria were suspended in
PBS and processed as above. Radioactivity in the filtrates and
in the unfiltered sera was measured in an automatic gamma
counter (Nuclear-Chicago, Des Plaines, Ill.). The amount of
5'Cr specifically liberated by serumnwas expressed as a percentage ofthe total radioactivity in the serum after subtracting
radioactivity released spontaneously by bacteria incubated in
PBS. %5'Cr release = (cpm serum filtrate - cpm PBS filtrate/
cpm unfiltered serum - cpm PBS filtrate) x 100.
Chromate release was compared with a standard bactericidal
assay in several experiments. The radiolabeled bacteria were
removed from serum at zero time and at intervals thereafter.
Each aliquot was serially diluted in sterile saline, and the
appropriate dilutions were spread, in duplicate, over the surface of the trypticase soy agar culture plates which were then
incubated overnight. Colonies were counted, and the number
of surviving colony-forming units (CFU) was determined.
Anttibody. Antiserum toE. coli 0111 with a hemagglutinating (HA) titer of 1:4,000, prepared by hyperimmunizing human
volunteers vith boiled bacteria, was kindly provided by
Dr. Elizabeth Zeigler, University of California, San Diego

units; HA, hemagglutinating; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline;

(12). Antiserum to E. coli 04 (HA titer, 1:2,000) was prepared
by injecting rabbits intravenously with boiled bacteria every
other day for 2 wk. Animals were bled to obtain serum 1 wk
after the last injection.
Complement. Total hemolytic complement was measured
by the method of Kent and Fife (13). Concentrations of C3 and
C4 were measured by radial immunodiffusion (14) with reagents purchased from Hyland Diagnostics Div., Travenol
Laboratories, Costa Mesa, Calif. C3PA (factor B) concentrations
were measured similarly with reagents purchased from
Calbiochem-Behring Corp., San Diego, Calif.
Serum from a patient (J.L.) with acquired common variable
hypogammaglobulinemia was used as the complement source
for 5'Cr-release studies. This serum had the following
characteristics: no measurable isohemagglutinins; IgG and
IgM concentrations of <50 mg/dl and <5 mg/dl, respectively;
normal total hemolytic complement activity; and normal C3,
C4, and factor B concentrations. Neither diluted guinea pig
serum nor diluted rabbit serum were adequate complement
sources for the 5'Cr release assay.
Immunoglobulin separation. Lipoproteins were precipitated from serum with dextran sulfate (500,000 mol wt) (15).
The supernate was dialyzed against a 0.1-M Tris buffer (pH
7.5); and 8 ml was added to a 2.5 x 100-cm column of Bio-Gel
A-5M (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). The protein
was eluted with Tris buffer in 0.15 M NaCl at 30 ml/h. The
effluent was monitored continuously at a wavelength of 280 nm.
Individual protein peaks were pooled and concentrated with
an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon Corp., Lexington, Mass.). The
IgM in the first peak was further purified and separated from
the dextran sulfate by use of concanavalin A Sepharose
(Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Div. of Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway,
N. J.) (16). IgG from the second peak was separated from
contaminating IgA by use of DEAE-Sephadex (Phannacia Fine
Chemicals) (17). The concentrations of IgA, IgG, and IgM in
each of the purified fractions were determined by radial immunodiffusion. The IgM fractions were free of measurable
IgG, and vice versa. IgM fractions did contain IgA in approximately equal concentrations.
1gM bactericidal activity. The separated IgM fractions
were serially diluted in Dulbecco's buffered saline (18) containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1-ml aliquots added
to an equal volume (0.1 ml) of complement in 12 x 75-mm
glass tubes. 5'Cr-labeled E. coli 0111 (0.5 x 106 organisms in
0.02 ml of PBS) were added and the tubes incubated stationary
at 36°C for 20 min. The percentage of 5'Cr release was determined as usual and compared with a maximum 5'Cr release
(5'Cr release by pooled, normal human serum). A unit of IgM
bactericidal activity is defined as the amount which induces
50% of maximum 5'Cr release. The reciprocal of the concentration of the IgM determined to contain one bactericidal unit
per milliliter is a measure of the concentration of specific
bactericidal antibody in that IgM fraction. That value (units
per microgram IgM), multiplied by the concentration of IgM
present in the starting serum, gives the total serum IgM bactericidal activity.
Hemagglitination titer. Human 0 erythrocytes were sensitized with alkali-treated lipopolysaccharide which was extracted from E. coli 0111 by the method of Westphal et al. (19).
25 Al of a heat-inactivated serum was serially diluted in microdilution trays (25 IAI/well), and 25 ,ul of a 1% suspension of
sensitized erythrocytes was added to each well. The mixture
was incubated at 37°C for 2 h and then held overnight at 40C.
Hemagglutination was then read macroscopically. All HA activity was eliminated when serum was treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, indicating that the HA antibody was IgM (20).

RESULTS
We compared the kinetics of 51Cr release from E. coli
0111 with the kinetics of bacterial killing (as measured
by change in CFU) in both normal and cirrhotic sera.
As shown in Fig. 1, release of 51Cr paralleled bacterial
killing in both sera. In the normal serum, maximum
51Cr release from E. coli 0111 was achieved after 7 min,
by which time >95% of the inoculum had been killed.
In the cirrhotics' serum, the rates of 5'Cr release and
bacterial killing were both decreased compared with
normal serum. Nevertheless, 5tCr release paralleled
bacterial killing. For each of the three test strains of
E. coli, we compared bacterial killing with 51Cr release
by normal (pooled) serum and serum from a patient with
cirrhosis. In every instance, normal 5tCr release was indicative of normal bactericidal activity and decreased 5'Cr
release reflected diminished bactericidal activity. We
therefore used 51Cr release as our assay method to compare the bactericidal activity of different sera.
We measured the capacity of normal and cirrhotics'
sera to release 51Cr from three serotypes of E. coli.
Normal 5'Cr release for each microorganism was defined as +2 SD from the mean of 5tCr release by neat,
normal sera. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the percentage of
5'Cr released from E. coli 0111 was below normal in
44% (12/27) of the cirrhotics' sera; from E. coli 06, in
36% (9/25); and from E. coli 04, in 61% (8/13). All sera
were tested against E. coli 0111 but, because we had
limited quantities of sera from some patients, not all
were tested against the other two serotypes ofE. coli.

FIGURE 1 51Cr release and surviving CFU were determined
at timed intervals after 51Cr-labeled E. coli 0111 were added
to a normal serum and to serum from a cirrhotic patient, 0.1 ml
of saline containing 5 x 107 CFU was added to 0.9 ml of neat
serum.
The kinetics of 51Cr release by sera obtained from
normal volunteers and from patients with cirrhosis
were also compared. Four representative sera from cirrhotic patients are compared with normal serum (pooled)
in Fig. 3. There is very little variation in the rate of
5tCr release by normal serum, and the activity of the
pooled serum was representative of 51Cr release by
individual normal sera (11). While 51Cr release from
E. coli 0111 was accomplished rapidly by the normal
serum, reaching a plateau within 10 min, the rate of
51Cr release by the cirrhotics' sera was so slow that after
20 min the percentage of 51Cr released was still significantly less than that released by normal serum. In fact,
51Cr release by two of the four sera did not achieve
control values even after 60 min. In sera with less pronounced defects, 51Cr release reached control values
after 15-20 min.
To determine whether this decreased rate of 51Cr release was a result of a low molecular weight inhibitor,
serum was dialyzed overnight in Dulbecco's buffered
saline at 4°C. After dialysis, there was a slight decrease
in 51Cr release by both the normal and the patients'
serum, probably because of some loss of complement
activity (Fig. 4). Significantly, there was no increase in
the bactericidal activity of a cirrhotics' serum after dialysis, suggestive that the abnormality was not a result of
a dialyzable inhibitor.
Sera from cirrhotic patients and normal serum were
mixed together in varying proportions to test for the
presence of an inhibitor in the cirrhotics' sera (Table I).
As much as 0.5 ml of cirrhotics' sera did not inhibit
51Cr release by 0.4 ml normal serum. Furthermore, preincubation of bacteria with cirrhotics' sera did not prevent the subsequent release of 5tCr when the preincubated bacteria were washed and then resuspended in
normal serum (Table II).
After failing to demonstrate an inhibitor, we examined
the functional activity ofeach ofthe known components
of the serum bactericidal system. Serum lysozyme was
measured spectrophotometrically with Micrococcuslysodeikticus as the substrate (21) and crystalline egg
white lysozyme (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.)
as the standard. Serum lysozyme values ranged from 6
to 31 U/ml in patients with Laennec's cirrhosis (Table
III). The normal range was 6-12 U/ml. No cirrhotic
patient had a low level of serum lysozyme and one-half
of those tested had concentrations which were higher
than normal.
Total hemolytic complement activity was measured
in sera from 16 cirrhotic patients. Immunoreactive C3,
C4, and factor B (C3PA) concentrations were also measured in most of these sera. As shown in Table III, only
3 of 16 had abnormally low CH50. C3, C4, and factor B
concentrations also were in the normal range in most of
the cirrhotics' sera, and the few abnormal values were
not <75% ofnormal. Furthermore, there was no correla914 J. Fierer and F. Finley

As has been reported (23), Mg-EGTA slows the bactericidal activity of normal serum. We confirmed this
with both 51Cr release and the enumeration of surviving
CFU to measure serum bactericidal activity. As shown
in Fig. 5, the rate of 51Cr release and bacterial killing by
normal serum were markedly decreased by Mg-EGTA.
In contrast, although the rates of 5tCr release and bacterial killing by the patients' serum were already substantially lower than normal, there was no further
decrease when Mg-EGTA was added. In fact, the MgEGTA-resistant bactericidal activity of the patients'
serum (which constituted virtually all of the serum
bactericidal activity [SBA] of this serum) was greater

than the Mg-EGTA-resistant activity of the normal
serum. WithE. coli 04, we compared the effect of 10mM
Mg-EGTA on 5'Cr release by normal and cirrhotics'
sera. Bacteria were incubated in sera for 30 min. The
addition of Mg-EGTA decreased the percentage of 5tCr
released by 7 of 9 normal sera, but only 2 of 11 sera
from cirrhotics showed a measurable decrease in 55Cr
release (data not shown). This is further evidence that
nearly all of the SBA against E. coli of most patients
with cirrhosis is a result of the activity of the alternative complement pathway.
We compared the bactericidal activity of 28 sera from
cirrhotic patients for two serotypes ofE. coli (Table IV).
In 12 of 28 instances there were discordant results:
12 sera had decreased bactericidal activity against either
E. coli 0111 or E. coli 06, but not both. This suggested
that the bactericidal defect in these patients had antigenic specificity which varied from serum to serum. To
further examine this possibility, we measured the bactericidal titers of antibodies isolated from abnormal sera.
Normal and cirrhotics' sera were fractionated to separate
IgG and IgM as described in Methods. Each fraction
was concentrated so that the concentration of the immunoglobulin was equal to that in the starting serum.
The bactericidal antibody titer of the IgG and IgM
from all of the fractionated sera was measured with
E. coli 0111. When added to complement, there was
no release of 51Cr by IgG from any serum except hyperimmune serum. All of the bactericidal antibody activity
in both normal and cirrhotics' sera was found in the IgM
fraction. Fig. 6 illustrates the relationship of IgM concentration to 5tCr release for purified IgM from two
normal sera and one cirrhotic's serum. The concentration of IgM which induced 50% of normal 51Cr release
was determined by interpolation. This value was used
to determine the bactericidal activity of the purified
IgM (units per microgram) and to determine the total
serum IgM bactericidal activity (units per milliliter of
serum). These values for four cirrhotics' and four normal
sera are shown in Table V, where they are compared
with the bactericidal activity and the HA titers of the
corresponding whole sera. In the cirrhotics' sera, serum
bactericidal activity was proportional to both the bactericidal activity of purified IgM and the total serum
IgM bactericidal activity. All four normal sera had essentially identical serum bactericidal activity, even
though total serum IgM bactericidal activity ranged from
10.5 to 129.5 U/ml. Apparently, all of these values were
above the threshold of specific bactericidal IgM activity
needed for maximum 5'Cr release from E. coli 0111.
Total IgM bactericidal activity was roughly correlated
with HA titer, at least at the extremes. However, HA
titers did not discriminate between sera with normal
and decreased SBA as well as did the IgM bactericidal
titers.

ficient in bactericidal antibody, we attempted to correct
the defect with antiserum to boiled bacteria. Antiserum
against the homologous strain (E. coli 0111 in this case)
increased 5tCr release to normal values. Antiserum to
the heterologous strain (E. coli 04) did not increase
51Cr release at concentrations which were effective
when the test bacteria was E. coli 04. IgM but not IgG
from a normal serum (L.T.) also completely restored the
SBA of a cirrhotic's serum (R.S.). However, it required
1,100 ,ug/ml of the IgM to correct the bactericidal deficiency of the cirrhotic's serum whereas 200 ,ug/ml was
sufficient to correct the defect in agammaglobulinemic
serum. These results suggest that, in addition to the
deficiency in bactericidal IgM, there may also be a
"blocking" factor in cirrhotic sera, such as noncomplement-fixing antibody (24). Further work is needed to
clarify this point.
DISCUSSION
In this study we found that most patients with advanced
cirrhosis of the liver had diminished SBA against at
least one of the three test strains of E. coli. This abnormality was manifest primarily as a kinetic defect,
i.e., E. coli were killed more slowly in cirrhotic than
in normal serum. At its extreme, the bactericidal reaction was so slow that the cirrhotics' sera essentially
lacked bactericidal activity. 80% (22/27) had diminished
bactericidal activity against at least one of the three
E. coli strains (Fig. 2). We consider 80% to be a minimal
estimate of the prevalence of the bactericidal defect in
cirrhosis because we used only three test strains of
E. coli and it was not unusual for a serum to have decreased SBA against only one strain. Had we used more
strains, we might have identified a bactericidal defect
in all patients with cirrhosis. Because all sera were
tested undiluted, we believe that these in vitro measurements of SBA are true estimates of in vivo bactericidal capacity.
The measurement of SBA was facilitated by the use of
the 5'Cr-release assay. We have found that with each
strain of E. coli, the percentage of 5'Cr released after
exposure to human serum is proportional to bacterial
killing as measured by decrease in CFU. We have previously shown that in normal serum 5tCr is released
from bacteria almost simultaneously with cell death,

and that 51Cr release is therefore a useful method for
studying the kinetics of the bactericidal reaction (11).
The ease with which serial measurements of 51Cr release
can be made allowed us to compare the initial rates of
bactericidal reactions in serum from cirrhotic and normal individuals (Fig. 3). This is quite difficult to do with
viability assays. Furthermore, the use of 51Cr release
made it practical to measure the SBA of serum from
large numbers ofcirrhotic patients using three different
strains of E. coli.

The abnormality of SBA observed in cirrhotics' sera
might have been a result ofan abnormality ofantibody,
complement, or lysozyme. We found that patients with
14 cirrhosis had a normal or increased activity oflysozyme,
but some were hypocomplementemic, as has been reported (7). In our patients, the complement abnormalities were quite mild and were not well correlated with
deficiencies in SBA. We therefore sought to measure
bactericidal antibody in these patients.
Antibody-mediated humoral defense mechanisms
have not been studied previously in patients with cir30 rhosis, perhaps because it has been shown that these
patients have high titers of agglutinating antibacterial
antibodies (25). Antibodies to Gram-negative bacteria
may promote immunity in two ways: They may be
opsonic or they may be bactericidal. The latter function
always requires complement. In normal individuals,
bactericidal antibodies are limited to the IgM class of
immunoglobulins (26). After immunization or infection
it is possible to detect bactericidal antibody of the IgG
class, even though these are much less efficient bactericidal antibodies than are IgM antibodies (27). In cir30 rhotics, we found that bactericidal antibodies to E. coli
30 were also limited to the IgM class.
More surprising than the absence of bactericidal IgG
were in the serum of cirrhotic patients is the relative deml of ficiency of bactericidal IgM against E. coli 0111. Despite

plus 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 ml of human complement was added to each dilution. Radiolabeled E. coli

tubes were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The percentage of
5'Cr released by pooled, normal serum was used as the 100%
standard, and percentage of 5'Cr release induced by the IgM

of 51Cr by the IgM fractions in the absence of complement.
IgM concentrations were determined by radial immunodiffusion. This figure illustrates the bactericidal activity of IgM
from two normal sera (solid lines) and a cirrhotic's serum

slightly higher serum concentrations of IgM, 75% of patients with deficient SBA had less circulating bactericidal IgM antibody than did normals (Table V). Although
we did not directly measure the concentrations of
bactericidal IgM antibody against E. coli 04 and 06, we
assume that they were also diminished because SBA
against these strains was reduced.
There are several possible explanations for the relative deficiency ofanti-E. coli bactericidal IgM antibody
in patients with cirrhosis. It is possible that these patients preferentially synthesize noncomplement-fixing
IgM antibody in response to bacterial antigens (28). If
this were the case, they should have deficient SBA
against all E. coli, not just against selected serotypes,
the most common pattern observed in this study. Alternatively, it is possible that these patients are hyperimmunized by their current microflora because their
livers do not remove and sequester bacterial antigens
normally (29), and that the resultant hypergammaglobulinemia might suppress the synthesis of antibody to
other bacterial antigens. Finally, the cirrhotic patient
may make more IgG and less IgM antibody in response
to chronic immunization by lipopolysaccharides (30).
Because IgG is a relatively inefficient mediator of SBA
and hemagglutination, we may not have detected such
an increase in IgG antibody with our assays. Very little
is known about the basis for the switch from IgM to
IgG synthesis, but there is some evidence that IgG
antibody can suppress the synthesis of IgM antibody
(31). We did attempt to quantitate anti-E. coli antibody
in each immunoglobulin class using indirect immunofluorescence with an antibody specific for each human
Ig heavy chain (Meloy Laboratories, Inc., Springfield,
Va.), but the technique was too insensitive. All sera,
both normal and cirrhotic, had titers between 0 and 1:4.
In view ofthe deficiency in bactericidal antibody observed in cirrhotic patients, it was ofinterest to examine
the functional activity of their alternative complement
pathway, which does not use IgM antibody (32). We
tested alternative pathway function by chelating Ca++
with Mg-EGTA (21), which slows the bactericidal reaction in normal serum. However, Mg-EGTA did not have
that effect on the bactericidal activity of sera from many
cirrhotics. In many cirrhotics' sera, such as the one
shown in Fig. 5, the SBA of chelated serum and neat
serum was nearly identical. Thus, whereas most of the
SBA of normal serum is a result of the activity of the
classical C pathway, the SBA of many cirrhotic sera is
a result of the activity of the alternative C pathway.
Furthermore, their alternative C pathway is sometimes
sufficiently active to produce normal SBA.
The exact role that serum bactericidal activity plays
in immunity to Gram-negative infections is controversial. It has been shown that acquired immunity to
Haemophilus influenzae (33) and to Neisseria meningitidis (34) correlates with the development of bactericidal antibody. Although normal adults have a high
degree of "natural" immunity to E. coli and normal
serum contains "natural" antibody that is bactericidal
for many strains of E. coli (and other Gram-negative
bacilli), the relationship between immunity to these
Gram-negative bacilli and SBA has not been conclusively established. However, because most strains of
E. coli isolated from the blood of bacteremic patients
are serum resistant (10), whereas many fecal strains
are serum sensitive, it is likely that SBA does play a
role in natural immunity.
The importance of SBA has been demonstrated in
experimental models. Durack and Beeson (35) have
shown that the serum resistance of the bacteria and the
Deficient Bactericidal Activity in Cirrhosis 919

host SBA can both influence the outcome of an E. coli
infection. In their experiments, rabbits with congenital
C6 deficiency developed endocarditis after intravenous
injections of either serum-sensitive or serum-resistant
E. coli. Normal rabbits were resistant to infection with
the serum-sensitive, but not the serum-resistant, E. coli.
Similar results have recently been obtained with a
model of E. coli meningitis (36). Because C6-deficient
rabbits completely lack SBA but have normal opsonic
capacity, these studies support the importance of SBA
as a natural defense mechanism. Cirrhosis may be a
disease which mimics these experimental models.
Under normal circumstances, E. coli remain within the
intestinal lumen and are not pathogenic. In the presence of portal hypertension, bacteria which are ordinarily "noninvasive" may pass out of the intestinal lumen
and gain access to the circulation; this would be analogous to the direct injection of the bacteria in the experimental animal. These bacteria are more likely to multiply in the circulation if they are fully resistant to SBA
or if the bacteria are serum sensitive but the host lacks
normal SBA (which we have found to be the case in cirrhotics). In this regard, it is interesting that 3 out of 10
strains ofE. coli isolated from the blood of patients with
cirrhosis were very serum sensitive (i.e., they exhibited
a 90% decrease in CFU after 20 min in normal serum),
whereas 95% of blood-culture isolates from unselected
patients are serum resistant (10).
We have established that there is a deficiency in
bactericidal IgM antibody activity against one or more
strains of E. coli in patients with advanced cirrhosis.
It is possible that this deficiency has other ramifications
besides the bactericidal defect; it may also affect cellular
defenses. For example, while IgM alone is not opsonic,
it becomes opsonic in the presence ofcomplement (37).
The possibility that cirrhotics have an opsonic defect
in addition to their bactericidal defect is presently
under investigation.
