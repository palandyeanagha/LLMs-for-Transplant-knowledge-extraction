ABSTRACT
Objective Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is 
the leading cause of end-stage liver diseases worldwide. 
Understanding NAFLD prevalence and trends over time 
at the global, regional and national levels is critical to 
understanding the NAFLD disease burden and creating 
more tailored prevention strategies.
Design Population-based observational study.
Setting The study was global, including 21 regions and 
195 countries or territories.
Main outcomes measure The estimated annual 
percentage change for NAFLD prevalence.
Results Worldwide, cases of NAFLD have increased from 
391.2million in 1990 to 882.1million in 2017, with the 
prevalence rate increasing from 8.2% to 10.9% during the 
same period. The increasing trends were consistent across 
sexes. Case numbers were highest in East Asia, followed 
by South Asia, then North Africa and the Middle East. The 
highest prevalence of NAFLD was observed in North Africa 
and the Middle East, while the greatest increase was 
detected in Western Europe, followed by Tropical Latin 
America, then high-income North America.
Conclusion Nearly all countries or territories worldwide 
have experienced a significant increase in NAFLD 
prevalence. The greatest increase was observed in Oman. 
Almost all countries showed a significant increasing trend 
in NAFLD prevalence over the past three decades. This 
drastic increase is alarming and suggests that NAFLD 
has emerged as a new public health concern worldwide. 
As such, more efficient prevention strategies are urgently 
needed.
INTRODUCTION
Over the past three decades, non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has gone from an 
obscure liver disorder to the most prominent 
chronic liver disease worldwide.1 2 NAFLD 
is a growing cause of end-stage liver disease 
and has been recognised as an aetiology of 
hepatocellular cancer (HCC), even in the 
absence of underlying cirrhosis.3
 NAFLD is 
highly prevalent across nearly all continents 
and is geographically heterogeneous in its 
prevalence from country to country, with the 
highest rates, for example, being reported in 
South America and the Middle East, followed 
by Asia, the USA, and Europe; NAFLD is less 
common in Africa.4
In line with the worldwide increases in 
obesity and type 2 diabetes,5 6 in recent 
years, NAFLD has shown novel epidemics 
in both developed and developing countries. Understanding temporal trends in 
NAFLD prevalence is vital to better understanding its disease burden and preventing 
additional cases of NAFLD. Previous studies 
have either focused on individual regions 
had limited time frames.3 7 8 Fortunately, the 
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which 
provides a tool for quantifying health losses 
caused by hundreds of diseases, injuries and 
risk factors, fills the gap when actual data 
on disease burden is sparse or unavailable, 
providing an unprecedented opportunity to 
learn more about NAFLF epidemiology. This 
study uses the data from the GBD study to 
comprehensively describe NAFLD prevalence 
and to quantify its temporal trends between 
1990 and 2017 at the global, regional and 
national levels. Our results are instrumental 
in raising awareness of NAFLD and will be 
invaluable in the establishment of updated 
prevention strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Prevalence data for NAFLD by sex, region, 
and age were retrieved using the online 
Strengths and limitations of this study
► Our study comprehensively investigated temporal 
trends in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
prevalence at the global, regional and national levels.
► We assessed secular trends in NAFLD risk factors, 
according to the Global Burden of Disease study.
► All data used in our study were derived from mathematical estimates rather than surveillance data.

Global Health Data Exchange query tool.9 We used data 
from five Sociodemographic Index (SDI) regions (low, 
low-middle, middle, high-middle and high), 21 GBD 
geographically defined regions (eg, East Asia) and a total 
of 195 countries and territories. The SDI is a composite 
average of the rankings of residents’ incomes per capita, 
average educational attainment and fertility rates in all 
areas for their respective regions, according to the GBD 
study. Prevalence (or the prevalence rate) is a commonly 
used Epidemiological Index that quantifies the degree to 
which a disease or condition exists within a population at 
a particular point in time. We calculated annual NAFLD 
prevalence as: Prevalence = case number
population size, where the case number 
denotes the number of NAFLD cases diagnosed at the 
end of that year. The general methods used in the GBD 
for creating estimates have been detailed in the previous 
studies.10 NAFLD is an umbrella term for a range of 
liver conditions affecting people who drink little to no 
alcohol and is identified by International Classification 
of Disease (ICD)10 code K76.0. NAFLD prevalence was 
estimated by conducting a systematic literature review 
of PubMed, and then adopting DisMod-MR 2.1 models. 
The following inclusion criteria were used: (1) a sample 
size greater than 100; (2) representative of locale or area 
and sufficient methods; (3) does not exclude comorbidities and (4) NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasound scan (USS) 
or other imaging diagnostic. Any hospital or claims data 
that severely underestimated NAFLD prevalence were 
excluded. Data were outliered or excluded if we found 
that they differed significantly when compared with the 
regional, superregional or global rates. Studies using 
serum diagnostics or fatty liver indices and scores to diagnose NAFLD were also excluded. We also retrieved data 
from the National Human Development Index (HDI), a 
composite index created by the World Bank (www.worldbank.org) that measures average achievement in three 
basic dimensions of human development—a long and 
healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of living. To 
assess secular trends in NAFLD risk factors, we retrieved 
prevalence data for type 2 diabetes from the GBD online 
database and prevalence data for obesity (and overweight 
status) from the WHO (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/
view.main.GLOBAL2461A?lang=en). The obesity dataset 
includes estimates of the prevalence of overweight men 
and women aged 18 and over by country, region and globally. A person is defined as overweight if he or she has a 
body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25. BMI 
is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by 
his or her height in metres. We retrieved data spanning 
1990–2016.
Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was used 
to quantify trends in the prevalence of NAFLD, stratified by sex, nation and age, between 1990 and 2017. 
As described elsewhere, EAPC can be calculated using 
a regression line fitted to the natural logarithm of the 
rates, that is, y=α+βx+ɛ, where y=ln (rate), and x=calendar year.
11 All statistical analyses were performed using 
the R program (V.3.3.3, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). 
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
Patient and public involvement
No patients or members of the public were involved in 
designing, conducting, reporting on or dissemination 
information related to our research.
RESULTS
Prevalence in case numbers and prevalence rates of NAFLD 
globally
Worldwide, the prevalence of NAFLD increased from 
391.2million in 1990 to 882.1million in 2017, with the 
prevalence rate increasing from 8.2% to 10.9% during this 
same period (EAPC=1.05, 95%CI 1.04 to 1.07, p<0.001) 
(table 1; figures 1 and 2). Men accounted for approximately two-thirds of all cases; however, women experienced a greater increase in NAFLD prevalence than men 
(table 1). All five SDI regions saw increase in both NAFLD 
prevalence in case numbers and prevalence rate. The 
most pronounced increase was in the high-middle SDI 
region, with the greatest prevalence seen in 2017 (table 1; 
figures 1 and 2). The increasing trends in both NAFLD 
prevalence in absolute case numbers and in prevalence 
rates were consistent across different age groups. Younger 
people (aged 15–49 years) accounted for nearly 50% of 
the total number of cases and accounted for the greatest 
increase in NAFLD prevalence between 1990 and 2017 
(EAPC=1.25, 95%CI 1.22 to 1.28, p<0.001) (table 1).
Prevalence in case numbers and prevalence rates of NAFLD 
regionally
A total of 21 GBD regions were included in our analysis. 
The prevalence in terms of case numbers was highest 
in East Asia, followed by South Asia, then North Africa 
and the Middle East. In these three regions, absolute 
case numbers exceeded 0.1billion in 2017. The highest 
NAFLD prevalence was observed in North Africa and the 
Middle East (19.3%), followed by Oceania, Southeast Asia 
and Central Latin America (table 1). Between 1990 and 
2017, all 21 regions experienced significant increases in 
NAFLD prevalence (figure 3). The greatest increase was 
detected in Western Europe, followed by Tropical Latin 
America and then high-income North America (table 1; 
figure 3).
Prevalence in case numbers and prevalence rates of NAFLD 
nationally
Globally, NAFLD prevalence varied from country to 
country, ranging from 5.2% in Rwanda to 24.9% in Qatar 
in 2017 (figure 4A). The highest prevalence rates were 
observed in Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Oman. Relatively lower prevalence was found in parts of Africa and 
Europe, including Uganda, Mozambique, France and 
Denmark. China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and the USA 
had the heaviest burden of NAFLD in terms of absolute case numbers, with case numbers above 20million

in each of these five countries (figure 4B). Between 
1990 and 2017, nearly all countries or territories experienced a significant increase in NAFLD prevalence rates 
(figure 4C). The greatest increase was observed in Oman 
(EAPC=2.12, 95%CI 1.97 to 2.26, p<0.001), followed by 
Finland, Equatorial Guinea and Nicaragua (figure 4C; 
online supplementary table). Only one country, Bulgaria, 
remained stable in terms of NAFLD prevalence for the

study period. These increasing trends were consistent 
across both sexes and all three age groups at national 
levels (online supplementary table).
Correlations between NAFLD prevalence and risk factors
We assessed the correlations between NAFLD prevalence 
and the prevalence of overweight and diabetic status at the 
national level (online supplementary figure S1). There 
were significant positive correlations between these categories, with a r of 0.664 and 0.354, respectively. We also 
tested the correlations for EAPCs of NAFLD prevalence 
with HDIs at the national level. As shown in figure 5A, we 
found a significant positive correlation between these two 
indices (r=0.310, p<0.001). Over the last three decades, 
more than 90% of countries or territories experienced a 
significant increase in overweight prevalence, while more 
than 80% experienced increases in diabetes prevalence. 
This positive correlation was observed between temporal 
trends in NAFLD and the same trends in overweight 
status and diabetes (figure 5B,C).
DISCUSSION
NAFLD and its histological subtype, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have emerged as the most common 
forms of chronic liver disease in most regions worldwide.

This study comprehensively describes NAFLD prevalence 
and temporal trends in NAFLD prevalence over the past 
three decades at the global, regional and national levels. 
In general, we found that NAFLD prevalence was heterogeneous across the globe, with almost all countries demonstrating significantly increasing trends between 1990 and 
2017. These increases have been consistent across sexes 
and age groups. The highest prevalence overall was 
observed in countries located in North Africa and the 
Middle East. The most significant increases in prevalence 
were observed in Western European countries.
According to a recent study, the estimated prevalence of 
overweight status was highest in several countries North 
African and Middle Eastern countries (including Qatar, 
Libya and Kuwait) across both sexes.6
 The distribution 
of overweight status lines up significantly with NAFLD 
prevalence, as demonstrated in this and other studies.12
The greatest increase in NAFLD prevalence was found in 
Western Europe, which may primarily be ascribed to the 
rapid increase in overweight status in these countries.6
This striking increase in NAFLD prevalence has prompted 
investigators to explore the disease’s risk factors. So far, 
well-established risk factors for NAFLD include obesity, 
type 2 diabetes, an unhealthy diet (eg, high intake of red 
meat and processed meat) and physical inactivity.13–17 Of 
these, an unhealthy lifestyle is deemed to be the most 
important contributor to NAFLD.18 Key lifestyle parameters include an increased intake of glucose, fructose, 
and saturated fat, induced hepatic de novo lipogenesis, 
subclinical inflammation in the adipose tissue and liver, 
and insulin resistance in adipose tissue, the liver, and skeletal muscle. These parameters are also accompanied by 
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.19
Additionally, gut dysbiosis, which is induced in most 
cases by an unhealthy diet, is believed to be a major 
contributor to the accumulation of fat in the liver and 
to the pathogenesis of NASH. There is a set of clinical 
trials currently underway that focuses on liver-specific 
and extrahepatic targets, including the microbiome 
and gut–liver signalling axis, as well as other organs that 
contribute to metabolic syndrome, especially muscle and 
adipose tissue.20 Although there is a great deal of activity 
in terms of drug development targeting NASH—for 
example, with an farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist 
(obeticholic acid), a peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR)α and PPARδ agonist (elafibrinor) and 
a C-C chemokine receptor (CCR)2 and CCR5 antagonist 
(cenicriviroc)—it is too early to prioritise these drugs or 
mechanisms based on which seems most promising. It 
will take time to translate the findings of all these studies 
into long-term safety and efficacy.
20 For these reasons, 
the primary preventative steps in terms of the abovementioned risk factors, including adherence to a healthy lifestyle and maintaining a healthy BMI, remain the optimal 
approach to preventing NAFLD.
Our study found that approximately 0.9billion people 
suffered from NAFLD in 2017. What sets NAFLD apart 
from other common liver diseases is the sheer number 
of patients worldwide. Unfortunately, we also observed 
increasing trends in NAFLD prevalence globally. Consequently, the complications and sequelae of NAFLD might 
also be on the rise. For example, this increasing prevalence of NAFLD is accompanied by increasing prevalence of other non-communicable diseases, including 
cardiovascular disease, obesity-associated and type 2

diabetes-associated cancer and advanced liver diseases 
such as hepatic cirrhosis and HCC.21 As the clinical consequences of NAFLD grow, so too will the economic repercussions. One model based on the populations of the USA 
and four European countries (Germany, France, Italy and 
the UK) estimated the annual burden associated with all 
incident and prevalent NAFLD cases at US$103billion 
in the USA (or US$1613 per patient) and €35billion 
in these four European countries (from €354 to €1163 
per patient).22 Unfortunately, as our results show, we 
found significant increases in both obesity and diabetes 
prevalence in most countries over the last decade. If the 
annual rate of increase in NAFLD-related costs parallels 
annual growth in the prevalence of obesity—and taking 
into account an ageing population—then the expected 
10-year burden for NAFLD could increase to an estimated US$1.005trillion in the USA and €334billion in 
these Europe countries.22 Interestingly, we also found a 
significant positive correlation between national HDI and 
increase magnitude in NAFLD prevalence. This result 
suggests a striking increase in NAFLD risk factors, particularly in developed countries; these factors likely include 
an ever-growing ageing population, physical inactivity, 
increases in consumption of red meat and processed meat 
and other unhealthy lifestyles choices that contribute to 
NAFLD.16 23 Given the observable increases in obesity and 
diabetes prevalence, NAFLD prevalence is anticipated 
to continue to increase in the near future if no effective 
interventions are introduced.3 Moreover, this persistent 
increase in NAFLD also indicates an increasing need for 
medical facilities and improved health systems in these 
countries, given that more NAFLD patients will continue 
to be diagnosed.
NAFLD prevalence has also persistently increased in 
developing regions, including the sub-Saharan Africa, 
a region where NAFLD had previously been a less 
frequent diagnosis. This increase might be ascribed to 
the increasing availability of healthcare and the concomitant rise in accurate NAFLD diagnosis, as well as to transitions in lifestyle. Increased awareness and urgent action 
is needed if we want to control the NAFLD pandemic 
worldwide. Specifically, (1) our governments should play 
a strong leadership role in reinforcing the importance of 
addressing obesity and establishing more effective prevention strategies; (2) funds should be allocated specifically 
to create a culture that promotes healthy eating and an 
active lifestyle, especially for children and adolescents; 
(3) we must create multifaceted interventions aimed at 
motivating behavioural changes, including setting-based 
health promotion and education programmes (eg, in 
preschools, schools, workplaces, religious settings and 
hospitals), mass media campaigns, social marketing to 
share knowledge and skills within our communities and 
routine primary healthcare and counselling appointments to facilitate obesity prevention and management.24
Our study has several limitations that should be noted. 
First, the data we used were derived from mathematical 
models rather than surveillance. Differences in data 
processing approaches between the GBD study and 
previous studies might also contribute to disparities in 
the NAFLD prevalence rates proposed in our study when 
compared with those from the previous meta-analyses.4 25
For example, Younossi et al reported that the global prevalence of NAFLD derived from a meta-analysis was 25.24%, 
which is significantly higher than the estimates in our 
study.
4
 We assume that this difference can be explained 
as follows: (1) Most studies included in the meta-analysis 
were conducted in Europe, Asia and North America, 
where NAFLD prevalence is relatively high. In Africa 
and Australia, where NAFLD is not a major public health 
concern, studies on NAFLD are rare. However, in the GBD 
study, NAFLD prevalence was estimated from country to 
country using mathematical models; (2) The GBD study 
included a wider study population, ranging in age from 
0 to ≥85 years. Children, adolescents and young adults 
are relatively less afflicted by NAFLD than middle-aged 
people and elderly people26 and (3) To ensure the robustness of its estimates, NAFLD prevalence rates that were 
significantly higher than the regional, superregional, or 
global rates were excluded from the GBD study.
Second, NAFLD is a complex and heterogeneous 
disease. The scarcity of histological and stage data in 
the GBD database made it difficult to describe the 
NAFLD disease burden in detail. This type of descriptive 
study also lacks information at the individual level. For 
example, the GBD study did not include information 
on hepatic fibrosis evaluations, which are a key determinant of NAFLD outcomes. Future studies assessing the 
NAFLD disease burden should also take these histological and pathological data into account. Third, NAFLD 
prevalence was estimated using a mathematical model 
that included patients who were diagnosed only by USS 
or another imaging diagnostic tool. Since there are few 
effective diagnostic methods available in daily clinical 
practice—and because we excluded NAFLD diagnosed 
using other methods (eg, non-invasive scores)—our data 
may underestimate the NAFLD disease burden.
In summary, NAFLD prevalence is increasing worldwide and the disease is being diagnosed in all parts of 
the world. The highest prevalence was observed in North 
Africa and the Middle East, while the greatest increase 
was detected in Western Europe and North America. This 
dramatic and significant increase in NAFLD prevalence is 
alarming and suggests that NAFLD has emerged as a new 
public health concern worldwide. More efficient prevention strategies are urgently needed.
