ABSTRACT
Acetaminophen-induced liver necrosis has been studied extensively, but the extrahepatic manifestations of acetaminophen toxicity
are currently not described well in the literature. Renal insufficiency occurs in approximately 1–2% of patients with acetaminophen
overdose. The pathophysiology of renal toxicity in acetaminophen poisoning has been attributed to cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase isoenzymes present in the kidney, although other mechanisms have been elucidated, including the role of prostaglandin
synthetase and N-deacetylase enzymes. Paradoxically, glutathione is considered an important element in the detoxification of acetaminophen and its metabolites; however, its conjugates have been implicated in the formation of nephrotoxic compounds.
Acetaminophen-induced renal failure becomes evident after hepatotoxicity in most cases, but can be differentiated from the hepatorenal syndrome, which may complicate fulminant hepatic failure. The role of N-acetylcysteine therapy in the setting of acetaminophen-induced renal failure is unclear. This review will focus on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management of renal
insufficiency in the setting of acute acetaminophen toxicity.
Case: A 47-year-old female was found lethargic at home and brought by ambulance to an emergency department. History from
family members suggested an inadvertent acetaminophen overdose, and she had last been seen a few hours earlier. She reportedly
ingested 18 tablets of 500 mg acetaminophen (APAP) over the previous two days because she had run out of her prescription pain
medication. Her past medical history was significant for fibromyalgia, arthritis, and a prior gastric bypass procedure. She had no history of alcohol abuse or renal insufficiency. She was lethargic. Vital signs: BP 128/96 mmHg, pulse 112/min, respirations 32/min; pulse
oximetry 98% on 2L nasal cannula oxygen. Laboratory studies: BUN 9 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dl, acetaminophen 12 mcg/mL, AST
5409 u/L and ALT 1085 u/L. A urinalysis was negative for blood with trace protein and ketones. A urine drug screen was positive for
marijuana and opioid metabolites. At the initial hospital, she was treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) orally. Subsequently, she developed fulminant hepatic failure with elevated transaminases, hypoglycemia, and coagulopathy (Tables 1A and 1B). She was transferred

INTRODUCTION
Acetaminophen (APAP) is the most commonly reported toxic
ingestion in the United States. In 2005, there were over 165,000
exposures reported. Approximately 67,000 of these were acetaminophen only ingestions, and 37% occurred in children. The
other 98,000 were combination ingestions, most commonly with
opioids, and were more common in adults [1]. APAP is a known
toxin to both the liver and extrahepatic tissues. Acetaminopheninduced liver necrosis has been studied extensively, but the extrahepatic manifestations are not described comprehensively in the
literature. Overall, renal insufficiency occurs in approximately
1–2% of patients with APAP overdose [2]. Limited data in a retrospective case series of pediatric patients with acetaminophen
poisoning suggests that associated nephrotoxicity may be more
common in children and adolescents [3]. When significant acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity occurs, renal injury is commonly seen. A creatinine elevation 2.0 mg/dL was noted in
43–57% of a prospective study of 275 patients with encephalopathy and coagulopathy secondary to acetaminophen-induced
fulminant hepatic failure [4]. This review will focus on the mechanisms, clinical features, and management of renal insufficiency
in the setting of acetaminophen poisoning.
PHARMACOLOGY/PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The primary toxicity of acetaminophen is the result of drug metabolism in both the liver and extrahepatic tissues [5]. Only 1% of the
drug is excreted unchanged in the urine. With therapeutic dosing
in adults, approximately 63% of acetaminophen is metabolized via
glucuronidation and 34% by sulfation. These phase II reactions
occur primarily in the liver and result in water-soluble metabolites
that are excreted via the kidney. At therapeutic doses, 5% percent
of APAP is oxidized by the microsomal P-450 enzyme system to a
reactive intermediate, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). In
therapeutic dosing, this electrophilic metabolite is then reduced
by glutathione and subsequently excreted as mercapturic acid, a
relatively benign compound. In the setting of excess APAP, stores
of sulfate and glutathione are depleted. This shunts more of the
acetaminophen to the CYP-450 mixed function oxidase system,
generating more NAPQI reactive intermediates. When large doses
of drug are ingested, there is more severe glutathione depletion
as well as massive production of metabolites, which compounds
the toxicity, leaving large amounts of reactive species unbound.
These electrophilic intermediates then form adducts with
sulfhydryl and glutathione moieties on cellular proteins [6]. This
process disrupts homeostasis, with subsequent activation of
caspases and lysosomal enzymes that initiate apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This has been demonstrated in both liver
and kidney tissue in animal models. The resultant cell death leads
to tissue necrosis and ultimately organ dysfunction [7,8]. The
mechanism of acetaminophen toxicity is well described in the
liver, but is less clearly understood in the kidney. There are several potential mechanisms of renal toxicity based on both animal
and human data. Possible mechanisms include the cytochrome
P-450 pathway, as well as prostaglandin synthetase, and Ndeacetylase enzymes [6].
The CYP-450 microsomal enzymes involved in this process
are found in both the liver and kidney, although they differ
somewhat in each organ. The severity of renal damage and the
quantity of reactive adducts in tissues can be significantly
reduced when the CYP-450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide is
administered [6]. In addition, it has been noted that conditions
that are associated with increased activity of the CYP-450 system
enhance acetaminophen toxicity. Examples include chronic alcohol use and ingestion of drugs that induce these enzymes, such
as anticonvulsants [9].
The CYP-450 isoenzyme that is primarily involved in the
biotransformation in the kidney is CYP 2E1, which is inducible
by testosterone. This finding accounts for significant gender
to our facility two days after initial presentation for liver transplant evaluation. At that time, her APAP level was 2.0 mg/L. Oral NAC
therapy was continued after transfer. The patient’s liver function subsequently improved and she ultimately did not require transplantation. She did develop acute renal failure during the course of her hospitalization, with a creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL on transfer,
which increased to 8.1 mg/dL nine days later (approximately 11–13 days post-ingestion). Medical toxicology was consulted by the
intensive care unit team to address whether this was acetaminophen-induced renal failure and if there was a role for NAC in this
setting.

differences in the metabolism and toxicity of acetaminophen in
the kidneys of animal models [10]. It has been observed that
male mice and female mice pretreated with testosterone were
more likely to form toxic metabolites and demonstrate nephrotoxicity than untreated female mice. A definitive link between
gender and nephrotoxicity has not been noted in humans. It has
been suggested that this process is independent of that in the
liver, as renal toxicity has been demonstrated in isolated mouse
kidney slices [11] and in some cases, renal disease has occurred
in the absence of significant hepatotoxicity [12, 13].
Although glutathione has traditionally been considered an
important element in the detoxification of acetaminophen and
its metabolites, its conjugates have been implicated in the formation of nephrotoxic compounds. Animal models have demonstrated that APAP-induced nephrotoxicity can be mitigated by
inhibition of the metabolism or transport of these conjugates. It
is uncertain whether the renal injury is due directly to the acetaminophen-glutathione conjugate or one of its metabolites.
Another possibility is that the formation of these conjugates may
contribute to glutathione depletion, which may inhibit the
detoxification of reactive metabolites. These results have not been
reproduced in the liver, suggesting a discrete, selective mechanism for glutathione conjugates and glutathione depletion in
acetaminophen-induced renal disease [14].
Another potential mechanism of acetaminophen toxicity
is related to prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthetase (PGES),
although its effect may be more substantial in the chronic rather
than the acute setting. PGES is an enzyme found in the kidney
that activates APAP into toxic metabolites, most likely NAPQI.
This process is more pronounced in the medulla of the kidney,
whereas the cytochrome P450 plays a more important role in 
the cortex. Despite these subtle differences, the endpoint of the
two pathways is the same—formation of toxic metabolites, covalent binding to cellular proteins, followed by cell death and tissue necrosis. This process has been demonstrated in both human
and animal models. The association with chronic APAP toxicity
is suggested in the fact that PGES binds APAP with such high
affinity that reactive metabolites are formed even at therapeutic
doses. The clinical implications of this finding have yet to be elucidated. The enzyme N-deacetylase has also been implicated in
acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity, although its role is still
uncertain. It is known that the enzyme acts on APAP or NAPQI,
deacetylating its substrate to p-aminophenol, which is then converted to a free radical that can bind cellular proteins. This process
may occur in combination with the actions of the CYP-450
enzyme system and has been demonstrated in animal models [15].
HISTOPATHOLOGY
Rarely is renal biopsy performed for diagnostic purposes in the
setting of APAP-induced nephropathy, however, the histopathology reflects an ATN-type pattern. At the tissue level, these toxins
affect the proximal tubule most commonly, although disease may
be more diffuse. Light microscopy of renal biopsies in patients
with acetaminophen toxicity and renal insufficiency demonstrate
tubular epithelial cell necrosis in both proximal and distal parts
of the tubules [16]. In some cases, light microscopy demonstrates
normal glomeruli and vessels, but with debris and damage to the
basement membrane. There is no deposition of immunoglobulins
or complement on fluorescent microscopy. Electron microscopy
is significant for the loss of the tubular brush border with tubular
swelling and distortion of mitochondrial organization [16,17].
Acetaminophen-induced renal insufficiency is consistent with
acute tubular necrosis (ATN) [18–20]. Urinalysis can be used to
differentiate this from other causes of renal insufficiency, such as
hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) or prerenal azotemia. In the setting
of ATN, urine sediment will have granular casts with variable
hematuria or pyuria. Other causes of renal toxicity have less
active urinary sediment. Urine sodium and osmolality may provide additional information. In ATN, urine sodium tends to be
20 mmol/L, with an osmolality similar to that of plasma. In
HRS and prerenal etiologies, the urine sodium is 10 mmol/L
and the osmolality is greater than that of plasma (Table 2).
MANIFESTATIONS AND CLINICAL
COURSE
Several case reports have attempted to define patients at increased
risk of acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity. Although the
data is limited, it is reasonable to assume that patients at risk may

be similar to those at risk for hepatotoxicity: patients with
depleted glutathione due to causes such as starvation, fasting, or
alcoholism. In addition, medications that induce the CYP-450
enzyme system may worsen toxicity and outcomes by increasing
the formation of these intermediates [9]. Adolescents and young
adults may be more prone to renal insufficiency in the setting of
APAP overdose; however, the reason for this finding is unclear [3].
These case reports have also provided valuable information
regarding the clinical course of APAP-induced nephropathy. The
onset of renal insufficiency tends to range between 1 and 8 days,
although most cases were reported between 2 and 5 days postingestion. Trends of serum creatinine demonstrated peak levels to
occur at an average of 7 days post-ingestion, with a range of 3–16
days. The majority of patients had a return to baseline renal function within 1 month. Approximately 1% of patients went on to
require dialysis as a temporizing measure. This was more common in patients with multisystem organ failure and other medical comorbidities, and less likely in patients with isolated renal
dysfunction.
In characterizing these trends, one must also consider confounding factors that occurred in many case reports, such as
coingestion of other nephrotoxic drugs, dehydration, preexisting
liver or renal dysfunction, multiple organ failure, chronic APAP
ingestions, and advanced age [21].
RELATIONSHIP TO DOSE AND
HEPATOXICITY
The relationship between dose and nephrotoxicity is not as clearly
delineated as with that of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. APAPinduced nephropathy may occur at lower doses than that seen
with hepatotoxicity. In 1 of 2 limited poison center retrospective
series, almost one third of patients developed renal insufficiency
in the absence of significant hepatotoxicity [21]. The mechanism
of this phenomenon is hypothesized to be independent production of toxins by both organs, but is poorly understood. It is not
surprising that patients with multisystem organ failure tend to
have a more complicated clinical course [13].
MANAGEMENT AND THE ROLE OF NAC
As with any exposure, patients who present with acute acetaminophen ingestion should have a thorough history obtained regarding
details of the ingestion. This should include all over-the-counter
and prescription products, dosages, quantity ingested, illicit substances used, and the time course of the overdose. History of concomitant medical comorbidities as well as risk factors for
nephrotoxicity, including malnutrition or chronic alcohol use,
should be identified. Laboratory data, including an acetaminophen level, liver function tests, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen should be obtained and followed. Patient’s blood pressure
and urine output should be trended as well. If renal insufficiency
develops, a urinalysis may help to delineate ATN from prerenal
azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome [19].
The administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown
to reduce the incidence of hepatic necrosis in the setting of acetaminophen toxicity. Patients may be given NAC via the oral or
intravenous route. NAC is a glutathione precursor that helps to
replete glutathione stores and detoxify reactive intermediates.
NAC has a clear role in preventing acetaminophen-induced liver
necrosis, but it has not demonstrated a benefit in preventing
nephropathy. This further reinforces the concept that discrete
mechanisms of toxicity exist between the liver and the kidney.
The role of NAC in acetaminophen-induced nephropathy is
derived primarily from retrospective studies and case reports.
There have not been any large-scale randomized clinical trials.
Analysis of existing case reports yielded no difference in peak creatinine levels between patients treated with NAC and those who
were not treated [12,19]. It was suggested that NAC may paradoxically augment acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity [22],
however, treatment with NAC did not worsen nephropathy in a
small series of patients [13]. Although NAC has not proven to be
harmful to the kidney, its role in patients without hepatoxicity
and only isolated renal function is uncertain. NAC administered
either intraperitoneally or orally to APAP-poisoned mice did not
protect against nephrotoxicity [23]. Oral NAC is a very safe therapy, but its utility in these patients is unknown. Current data suggests treating with NAC based on the risk of liver necrosis, not on
that of renal dysfunction.
CASE DISCUSSION
When the patient presented to our institution, she was obtunded
and intubated. Her liver function began to improve; however, her
creatinine began to rise. The urine sodium level was 38 mMol/L.
A urinalysis on admission to our hospital was significant for
pyuria, hematuria, and granular casts, all findings consistent with
acute tubular necrosis. Urine output decreased and hypertension
occurred. The patient was placed on hemodialysis, which was discontinued after several days with improved renal function. Her
course was also complicated by aspiration pneumonia, delirium,
and a urinary tract infection. She ultimately improved and was
extubated. She was discharged on day 25 after her admission to a
rehabilitation facility with a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL. Her episode
of renal failure was consistent with APAP-induced nephrotoxicity
including the onset, duration, clinical course and urinary findings. NAC was discontinued when her liver function began to
improve.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Acetaminophen-induced nephropathy occasionally occurs in
patients with acetaminophen ingestion, though is not as well
characterized as hepatoxicity. The mechanisms of necrosis in
both organs are similar, yet there are some subtle differences that
remain unclear. Patients may present with isolated renal toxicity
or in the setting of multisystem organ failure. The clinical course
is generally one of recovery, but hemodialysis may be required as

a temporizing measure. NAC has not shown any proven benefit
in the setting of renal toxicity to date. A thorough history and
physical examination with identification of risk factors, NAC
therapy based on potential for hepatotoxicity, supportive care,
and serial monitoring of urine output, blood pressure, and markers of glomerular filtration are essential to treatment. Future
research should aim to better understand and manage this phenomenon.
