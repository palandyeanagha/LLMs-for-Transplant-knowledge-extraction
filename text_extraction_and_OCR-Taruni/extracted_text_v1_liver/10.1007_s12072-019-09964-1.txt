Abstract
Background and Aim Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has gradually become one of the most common chronic 
liver diseases in the world. More and more evidence shows that low skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) may play a role in the 
development of NAFLD. Our aim was to quantify the association between SMI, sarcopenia and the presence and severity 
of NAFLD.
Methods We systematically searched English relevant studies from PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science and the Cochrane 
Library updated to December 20th, 2018. Studies in which SMI was compared between NAFLD cases and controls were 
included. So were studies concerning the odds ratio (OR) of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and signifcant 
fbrosis in sarcopenia patients. Pooled weighted mean diferences and ORs were calculated.
Results Of the 1331 retrieved studies, 19 articles were included. SMI level in NAFLD patients was 1.77 (95% CI 1.15, 
2.39) lower than that in normal controls. We also found a signifcantly higher occurrence risk of NAFLD (OR=1.33, 95% 
CI 1.20 to 1.48), NASH (OR=2.42, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.57) and NAFLD-related signifcant fbrosis (OR=1.56, 95% CI 1.34, 
1.78) in sarcopenia subjects.
Conclusions SMI level in patients with NAFLD was lower than healthy people, and patients with sarcopenia have higher 
occurrence risk of NAFLD, as well as its advanced stages including NASH or NAFLD-related signifcant fbrosis. Further 
well-designed prospective studies are required to strengthen the arguments.

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has gradually 
become one of the most common chronic liver diseases in 
the world, and approximately 25% of the adult population 
were afected [1]. It is expected that by the year 2025, 
NAFLD (Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) will become the 
dominant cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation [2, 3]. NAFLD contains many disease states, 
ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH (nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis) may develop to liver fbrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and bring a high occurrence risk of

non-liver-associated complications such as cardiovascular 
disease [4]. Therefore, early identifcation and intervention 
of NAFLD patients who are at high risk for progressing 
to NASH and especially to NAFLD-related liver fbrosis 
may help reduce the burden associated with these diseases.
Skeletal muscle has been considered to be an important 
endocrine organ that secretes myokines and participates 
in postprandial glucose utilization, which is a crosstalk 
between muscle, adipose tissue, liver and other organs. 
Relative skeletal muscle mass, represented by skeletal 
muscle mass index (SMI), is the skeletal muscle mass 
(SMM) divided by height squared or weight. Several 
cohort and cross-sectional studies have indicated that SMI 
(skeletal muscle mass index) is associated with the Incidence rate of NAFLD [5–8]. In addition, some researchers found that a reduction in SMM might cause metabolic 
disorders and deteriorate NAFLD [9, 10]. Sarcopenia is a 
condition characterised by a general and progressive loss 
of strength and SMM, often associated with functional 
impairment, physical disability, and increased mortality 
[11]. In the past few years, many high-quality studies have 
emerged to explore the relationship between sarcopenia 
and the presence and severity of NAFLD [12, 13].
Recently, more and more studies are focusing on the 
relationship between relative skeletal muscle mass, sarcopenia and NAFLD, but the answer remains controversial. 
Some studies have reported that patients with sarcopenia 
have a lower risk of developing NAFLD [12, 14], while 
others have reached the opposite conclusion [10, 15]. In 
this meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the association 
between SMI, sarcopenia and the presence and severity 
of NAFLD.
Methods and materials
Search strategy and literature selection
This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted 
based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement 
(Table S4). We retrieved English relevant studies from 
PubMed, Embase database, the Web of Science and the 
Cochrane Library. The latest literature screened was published on December 20th, 2018. The electronic retrieval 
strategy included the following terms: (“NAFLD” OR “Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease” OR “Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis” OR “NASH”) AND (“Skeletal Muscle” OR “Skeletal 
Muscles”). Specifc search strategies for each database can 
be found in supplementary materials. Furthermore, the reference lists of key articles were manually and independently 
reviewed.
Literature inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) observational 
studies or cross-sectional studies; (2) providing a concrete 
analysis on the odds ratio (OR) that measuring the association between NAFLD、NASH、 NAFLD-related fbrosis 
and sarcopenia or the mean SMI in NAFLD cases and controls with 95% CI. Studies exclusion criteria were as follows: 
(1) cell or animal studies, reviews, comments and letters; 
(2) duplicated studies; (3) research on irrelevant topics; 
(4) without necessary data or information. The titles and 
abstracts of the studies were reviewed by two researchers 
(CC and XS) independently, and which met the inclusion 
criteria underwent full-text assessment. Discrepancies were 
resolved by the third reviewer. The information extracted 
from each selected study was as follows: frst author, year of 
publication, country, study design, measurement of SMM, 
calculation of SMI, diagnosis of sarcopenia, diagnosis of 
NAFLD and fbrosis, population characteristics (disease 
stages and number of cases and controls), adjustment for 
confounding variables, adjusted OR with 95% CI and SMI 
with 95% CI.
Article quality and bias assessment
The methodological quality of the enrolled cohort studies was evaluated by the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) 
checklist and determined according to the selection of study 
groups, comparability of groups and ascertainment of the 
outcome. The methodological quality of the cross-sectional 
studies was evaluated by an 11-item checklist, which was 
known as Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
(AHRQ) (Table S2). If it was defned ‘YES’, the item would 
be scored ‘one point’; and the score would be a zero if it was 
defned ‘NO’ or ‘UNCLEAR’. The quality score of the study 
was graded as follows: low quality defned as 0–3; moderate 
quality defned as 4–7; high quality defned as 8–11. The 
supplementary material provides the bias assessment for the 
studies included.
Statistical analysis
The outcome measure of the meta-analysis was conducted in 
fve aspects. First, we calculated the weighted mean diference (WMD) of SMI between NAFLD patients and normal 
controls (NC). Subgroup analysis according to gender was 
performed. SMM measurement methods were divided into 
two types: bioimpedance analysis (BIA) and dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). We also performed subgroup analysis based on the diferent SMM measurement 
methods. Second, we evaluated the strength of association

between the risk of NAFLD, NASH and sarcopenia. Further 
stratifed analyses based on race and sample size were performed. Next, we assessed the risk of signifcant liver fbrosis in NAFLD patients with sarcopenia compared to NAFLD 
patients without sarcopenia. And subgroup analyses that 
based on race and whether the diagnosis of NAFLD-related 
fbrosis was invasive or non-invasive were performed. Relative skeletal muscle mass represented by SMI is the SMM 
divided by weight×100%. We analyzed SMI as a continuous 
variable and calculated the pooled estimates of mean difference between NAFLD patients and NC. To analyze the 
strength of the association between NAFLD and sarcopenia, 
we calculated pooled adjusted OR (odds ratio) with 95% CIs.
The publication bias was evaluated by constructing a 
funnel plot of each study’s efect size against the standard 
error. Funnel plot asymmetry was evaluated by Egger’s 
test, and p value < 0.1 was defned as having signifcant 
publication bias. And we conducted Trim-and-fll analysis 
to evaluate the efect of publication bias on the interpretation of the results. Cochran Q test and I
2
 test were used 
to assess the heterogeneity between the studies. The low, 
medium or high heterogeneity was represented by 25%, 
50% or 75% of the I
2
 value, respectively. The random 
efects model was selected if the p value was less than 0.1 
or the I
2
 value was more than 50%; otherwise, the fxed 
efects model was chosen. All statistical analyses were performed by Stata (version 12.0).
Results
Study identifcation and literature characteristics
A total of 1331 articles were retrieved, of which, 214 were 
from Pubmed, 540 were from Embase, 556 were from Web 
of Science and 21 were from Cochrane. After the exclusion 
of 350 duplicates, 135 reviews and comments, 226 animal 
studies, 586 irrelevant studies, and 17 articles without concrete data (Fig. 1), 19 articles were eventually included 
in our meta-analysis [5–10, 12–24]. Characteristics of all 
the studies included are listed in Table 1, among which, 
2 were in retrospective cohort design and 17 were in a 
cross-sectional design. The bias risk of the cohort studies 
was assessed by NOS in Table S1, while that of the crosssectional studies was assessed by AHRQ in Table S3.

Decreased SMI in NAFLD
In a pooled analysis of seven individual studies, the group 
of NAFLD patients (N=7934) showed a lower mean SMI 
than the group of NC (N=29,533), with WMD −1.77 (95% 
CI −2.39, −1.15) and statistically signifcant between-study 
heterogeneity (I
2=97.8%, p=0.000) (Fig. 2a). In this part 
of the analysis, no signifcant publication bias was found 
(p=0.835) (Figure S1). We performed a subgroup analysis 
based on the diferent SMM measurement methods (Fig. 2b). 
Results showed that in the bioimpedance analysis (BIA) 
diagnostic subgroup, the SMI of patients with NAFLD was 
0.57 (95% CI 0.37, 076) lower than that of the control group, 
while in the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) 
subgroup, the SMI of patients with NAFLD was 0.13 (95% 
CI 0.02, 023) lower than the control group. Besides, subgroup analysis according to gender showed that the WMD 
(weighted mean diference) in male subgroup and female 
subgroup was −2.19 (95% CI −2.63, −1.76) and −2.50 
(95% CI −3.21, −1.92), respectively (Fig. 2b). Further sensitivity analysis indicated that the SMI level in patients with 
NAFLD was lower than that of the NC group, while the 
WMD between the two groups was −1.35 (95% CI −1.45, 
−1.25), with no signifcant between-study heterogeneity 
(I
2=14.4%, p=0.320) (Fig. 2c).
Increased risk of NAFLD in sarcopenia
18 studies (N=48,079 participants) assessed the adjusted 
OR of NAFLD prevalence between sarcopenia patients 
and NC (Fig. 3a). Overall, the pooled adjusted OR suggested that sarcopenia was strongly associated with an 
increased occurrence risk of NAFLD (OR=1.33, 95% CI 
1.20, 1.48), with statistically signifcant between-study

heterogeneity (I
2= 73.9%, p = 0.000). There was no evident publication bias (p=0.113) (Figure S2). We then performed stratifed analyses among Caucasians and Asians. 
An increased risk of NAFLD was observed to be related 
to sarcopenia in the Asian population (OR=1.37, 95% CI 
1.22, 1.55), with signifcant between-study heterogeneity 
(I
2=73.9%, p=0.000) (Fig. 3b). Moreover, we conducted 
stratifed analyses based on the sample size. In the subgroup among which each study enrolled more than 2000 
samples, an increased risk of NAFLD was observed in 
sarcopenia patients (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.14, 1.30), with 
no signifcant between-study heterogeneity (I
2 = 9.3%, 
p = 0.357) (Fig. 3c). Further in the sensitivity analysis 
pooling the studies within the scope of the funnel, OR 
was 1.28 (95% CI 1.26, 1.23), with no signifcant betweenstudy heterogeneity (I
2=0.0%, p=0.454) (Fig. 3d).
Four studies (N = 469 participants) indicated a 
higher risk of NASH prevalence in sarcopenia patients 
(OR = 2.42, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.57) (Fig.  4c), with no 
between-study heterogeneity (I
2= 0.0%, p = 0.954). Signifcant publication bias (p = 0.049) was found in this 
analysis (Figure S3A). However, further analysis with 
trim-and-fll test showed that this publication bias did not 
impact the estimates (Figure S3B).

Increased risk of NAFLD‑related signifcant fbrosis 
in sarcopenia
A pooled analysis of 8 studies (N=25,434 patients) showed 
a higher prevalence of NAFLD-related signifcant fbrosis in 
sarcopenia patients compared to NAFLD patients without sarcopenia, with pooled adjusted OR 1.56 (95% CI 1.34, 1.78) 
(Fig. 4a). In this analysis, no between-study heterogeneity 
was observed (I
2=0.0%, p=0.893), while publication bias 
did exist according to Egger’s test (p=0.047) (Figure S4A). 
However, the further trim-and-fll analysis showed that the 
pooled log OR before and after trimming was 0.472 (95% 
CI 0.372, 0.620) and 0.433 (95% CI 0.333, 0.561), showing 
that the publication bias had little impact on the interpretation of the results (Figure S4B). We then performed stratifed analyses among Caucasians and Asians. An increased 
risk of NAFLD-related signifcant fbrosis was observed in 
sarcopenia patients in both the Asian population (OR=1.52, 
95% CI 1.29, 1.76, I

Discussion
Our study performed a comprehensive evaluation of the 
epidemiologic data focusing on the association between 
SMI, sarcopenia and the presence and severity of NAFLD. 
We conducted four separate meta-analyses to better quantify the relations. This meta-analysis is hitherto the frst 
study to explore whether the SMI of NAFLD patients differed from that of normal people. Besides, we frst ofered 
a pooled estimate and quantitative assessment of the clinical risk of NAFL, NASH and NAFLD-related signifcant 
fbrosis in patients with sarcopenia. We demonstrated that, 
when compared with normal people, NAFLD patients had 
a lower mean SMI, with WMD −1.77 (95% CI −2.39 to 
−1.15). The diference turned out to be more obvious in 
female subgroup than in male subgroup, and the diference in the BIA subgroup was greater than in the DEXA 
subgroup. However, the data of male and female research, 
BIA and DEXA research is consistent in terms of trends 
and meanings, indicating that gender and SMM measurement method does not afect the conclusions of the overall 
pooled results. As was reported before [18], after adjusting 
for some confounders in men, for every 1% increase in 
SMI, the odds ratio for fatty liver disease was 0.80 (95% 
CI 0.64–0.97, p = 0.021). These important fndings suggested that the lower the SMI one has, the higher the risk 
of developing NAFLD. Consequently, we showed that 
sarcopenia subjects having a signifcantly increased risk 
of NAFLD (OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.48). The association was stronger in Asian participants than in Caucasian 
participants, but the meaning of the results is consistent, 
which indicated that the race does not afect the overall 
pooled results. In the robust subgroup with a sample size 
greater than 2000, the pooled OR was 1.22 (95% CI 1.14, 
1.30) with no signifcant between-study heterogeneity 
(I
2 = 9.3%, p = 0.357), indicating that when the sample 
size of the study is larger, the results tend to be more consistent and stable [7, 12, 15, 24]. A higher risk of NASH 
was seen in NAFLD patients with sarcopenia patients 
than in NAFLD patients without sarcopenia, with an 
estimated 2.42-fold. Besides, the risk of NAFLD-related 
signifcant fbrosis was higher in NAFLD patients with 
sarcopenia than in the NAFLD patients without sarcopenia (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.34, 1.78). The pooled results 
were more remarkable in Caucasian participants than in 
Asian participants and in invasively diagnosed subgroup 
than in noninvasively diagnosed subgroup. However, the 
results of the Caucasion subgroup and the Asian subgroup 
had the same trend and signifcance, and the results of 
the invasive subgroup and the non-invasive subgroup have 
the same meaning, indicating that the race and diagnostic 
methods do not afect the interpretation of overall pooled 
data. The results indicated that sarcopenia was associated 
with a higher risk of developing NAFLD, especially of its 
advanced stages such as NASH or liver fbrosis. Two retrospective cohort studies included in our analysis reported 
that decreased muscle mass was an independent predictor 
of NAFLD in both male and female [8] and an increasing SMI over time was benefcial for preventing both the 
occurrence and the progress of NAFLD [6]. It is worth 
noting that some studies have suggested that patients 
with NASH or fbrosis have a relatively poor prognosis 
[25]. The status of skeletal muscle mass in patients with 
NAFLD deserves attention and timely interventions such 
as nutrition supplement and exercise should be taken to 
guard against further development to NASH, fbrosis and 
other events of poor prognosis. In fact, the mechanisms 
by which low SMI and sarcopenia increase the occurrence 
risk of NAFLD, NASH and even signifcant fbrosis are 
not completely elucidated. Possible explanations currently 
under discussion are summarized as the following.
First, skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in insulin signaling as a primary tissue responsible for insulin-mediated 
glucose disposal [26]. A reduction in skeletal muscle mass 
may give rise to insulin resistance and dysglycemia, ultimately leading to NAFLD and its signifcant patterns [27]. 
Second, oxidative stress and chronic infammation have been 
reported to cause muscle atrophy and lead to stress responses 
in hepatocytes, leading to the progression of NASH- and 
NAFLD–related liver fbrosis [28, 29]. Third, skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ secreting peptides called myokines, 
such as interleukin-6, which has a protective efect from 
developing NAFLD [30]. Irisin, another myokines, plays a 
critical role in fatty acid β-oxidation in the liver [31]. Hence, 
it is plausible that decreased skeletal muscle could be the 
cause of NAFLD incidence due to reduced secretion of 
various salutary myokines. Fourth, growing evidence has 
revealed a close association between low SMM and decline 
of vitamin D [32].
Several limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results of our work. First, despite our eforts to analyze comprehensively and accurately, some related studies 
might be omitted. Second, considering that most of the 19 
articles we analyzed were in cross-sectional design and only 
2 of them were retrospective cohort studies, we could not 
fully determine the cause-efect relationship between sarcopenia and NAFLD. Third, the defnition of SMI varies from 
study to study. Most studies defned SMI as SMM divided by 
body weight [6–10, 13, 15, 16, 18–23], while others adopted 
SMM divided by BMI or height [5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 33]. 
Fourth, although liver biopsy is still the gold standard for 
ascertaining NAFL and NASH, some of our original studies 
used imaging methods and predictive models, which are less 
sensitive in the detection of mild steatosis. And although the 
defnition of signifcant fbrosis in classifcation methods and 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:115–126 125

surrogate indices is diferent, these methods are also well 
validated.
In conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that SMI level 
in patients with NAFLD was lower than healthy people and 
sarcopenia is associated with NAFLD and particularly the 
most advanced forms of NASH and fbrosing NAFLD. Restoration of relative skeletal muscle mass may help prevent 
the onset of NAFLD or its progression, both in normal people and patients with sarcopenia. Clinicians need to bear 
in mind a potential diagnosis of NAFLD when confronting 
patients with low relative skeletal muscle mass or sarcopenia. When the diagnosis is made, lifestyle intervention, as 
the cornerstone management, can be implemented as soon 
as possible. Since most of the included studies are cross-sectional, the directionality of our results cannot be completely 
ascertained. Further well-designed prospective studies are 
required to consolidate these conclusions.
