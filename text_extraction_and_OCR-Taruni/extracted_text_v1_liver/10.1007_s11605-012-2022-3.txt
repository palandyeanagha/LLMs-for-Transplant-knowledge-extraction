Abstract
Background With modern multimodality therapy, patients with resected colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases (CLM) can
experience up to 50–60 % 5-year survival. These improved outcomes have become more commonplace via achievements in
multidisciplinary care, improved definition of resectability, and advances in technical skill.
Discussion Even patients with synchronous and/or extensive bilateral disease have benefited from novel surgical strategies.
Treatment sequencing of synchronous CRC with CLM can be simplified into the following three paradigms: (classic colorectalfirst), simultaneous (combined), or reverse approach (liver-first). The decision of whether to treat the CLM or CRC first depends
on which site dominates oncologically and symptomatically. Oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFOX) and irinotecan with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FOLFIRI) are the foundations of modern chemotherapy. Although each regimen has
positively impacted survivals, both have the potential for negative effects on the non-tumor liver. Oxaliplatin is associated with
vascular injury (sinusoidal ballooning, microvascular injury, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and long-term fibrosis) but not
steatosis. Irinotecan has been associated with steatohepatitis, especially in patients with obesity and diabetes. Steatohepatitis from
irinotecan is the only chemotherapy-associated liver injury (CALI) associated with increased mortality from postoperative
hepatic insufficiency. Extended duration of preoperative chemotherapy is also associated with CALI.
Conclusions To determine resectability and to prevent overtreatment with systemic therapy, all patients should receive highquality cross-sectional imaging and be evaluated by a hepatobiliary surgeon before starting chemotherapy. Even as
chemotherapy improves, liver surgeons will continue to play a central role in treatment planning by offering the best chance
for prolonged survival—safe R0 resection with curative intent.

Introduction
An estimated 143,000 Americans will be diagnosed with
colorectal cancer (CRC) this year.1 Over half will develop
metastases, with most developing colorectal liver metastases
(CLM). Unfortunately, many CLM will be unresectable due
to the distribution of intrahepatic disease and/or extrahepatic
disease. As few as 20 % of patients with CLM will be
candidates for resection. However, with modern oncosurgical approaches, patients with resected CLM can experience
up to 50–60 % 5-year overall survival (OS).2–4
Symptoms
CLM are often asymptomatic and diagnosed with surveillance cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography (CT). Because 80 % of metastases are detected in the
first 3 years following the primary diagnosis, for stage III
and high-risk stage II patients, annual CT is recommended
by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for the first

3–5 years after primary resection.5 Imaging is augmented by
interval colonoscopy and serum carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA) measurement. Rarely, patients present with symptoms such as pain, abdominal distention, and liver insufficiency. These patients usually have advanced CLM with
significant hepatic tumor burden. These symptomatic
patients may be less likely to be treated due to cancer burden
and performance status.6
Diagnosis, Staging, and Imaging
For CRC/CLM imaging, there are four main options—ultrasound (US), CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT). US is inexpensive and reliable but has been replaced by cross-sectional
imaging due to limited image capture, user dependence, and
lower sensitivity for small lesions. However, intraoperative
US remains a critically important modality as it can detect
additional tumors beyond preoperative cross-sectional imaging in up to 27 % of patients.7
The current standard for staging, surveillance, and preoperative planning is high-resolution, contrast-enhanced
multidetector CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. For
enhanced liver characterization, MRI abdomen and pelvis
with chest CT is an alternative. CT scan is more useful than
MRI for general imaging, including chest and other abdominal structures. On CT, CLM are hypovascular and more
prominent in the portovenous phase as hypodense lesions.
Concerns about the risks of repetitive radiation dosing do
not apply to this advanced stage cancer population, since
their disease burden is their real life-limiting issue and the
detail of CT clearly guides appropriate life-extending therapy. Although suboptimal for the whole body surveillance,
MRI can be useful for diagnosis and staging of liver tumor
burden. Using multiple contrast agents and dynamic phases,
high-resolution (3-T) MRI offers increased lesion characterization, especially for subcentimeter indeterminate lesions.
Whichever is chosen before chemotherapy, that modality
should be repeated after preoperative treatment and before
CLM resection.
Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of
PET/CT to identify areas of increased metabolic activity.
These areas are often presumed to be metastases in cancer
patients. However, they can also be nonspecific, and the
accompanying non-contrast CT adds little information for
equivocal areas, prompting additional workup. We reserve
PET/CT for the detection of occult extrahepatic disease in
patients with high pretest probability and equivocal crosssectional imaging (e.g., elevated CEA with normal CT)
when detection would change the treatment strategy.
Percutaneous needle biopsies of suspected CLM are unnecessary when imaging identifies new lesions with
characteristic imaging features for CLM. Needle biopsy
may be appropriate when a benign or non-CLM lesion is
suspected and cannot be delineated noninvasively with MRI
and if the treatment plan would change based on the result.
Radiographic evaluation of treatment response has prognostic value and frequently determines resectability. Although traditionally measured by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST
criteria,8 change in tumor diameter may not provide the best
prognostic information. Morphologic change in a treated
metastasis may better reflect tumor response.9 When tumors
change from heterogeneous consistency and irregular borders to homogenous density, clearly demarcated borders,
and no enhancement, this pattern strongly correlates with
pathologic response, margin control, and survival.
Surgical Treatment and Scenarios
Definition of Resectability
Resectability can be defined in the following three domains:
technical, physiologic, and oncologic. Technical resectability is the ability to surgically remove all CLM with R0
(negative microscopic) margins while leaving adequate future liver remnant (FLR) volume. Adequate FLR must have
regenerative capacity and consist of two contiguous hepatic
segments with vascular inflow/outflow and biliary drainage.
Of note, tumor resectability should be differentiated from
patient operability, which can be defined as a patient’s
physiologic and medical ability to undergo and recover from
major abdominal surgery.
Oncologically, patients with limited extrahepatic disease
in controllable sites (e.g., portal lymph nodes or small lung
metastases) can still benefit from hepatic resection. Biologically, these patients are at higher risk of recurrence and thus
require perioperative chemotherapy. Even patients with limited growth of existing CLM while on preoperative therapy,
but whose tumors remain anatomically resectable, should
undergo resection. However, patients who develop new
CLM or interval extrahepatic disease while on therapy
should not undergo resection until their systemic disease is
controlled.
Synchronous Presentation of Resectable Metastases: Three
Approaches
Synchronous presentation of liver metastases, occurring in
up to 25 % of new CRC,10 creates many challenges for the
multidisciplinary team. With synchronous CLM and asymptomatic primary CRC, short course (≤6 cycles) preoperative
systemic chemotherapy should be considered. Frequently,
mild primary tumor symptoms can be palliated with
196 J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:195–202

systemic chemotherapy. The natural history of unresectable
CLM suggests that resection of an asymptomatic primary
tumor without hepatectomy with curative intent offers poor
long-term benefit (<5 % 5-year OS).11
Treatment sequencing can be simplified into the following three paradigms: classic (colorectal-first), simultaneous
(combined), or reverse approach (liver-first).12 The decision
of whether to treat the CLM or CRC first depends on which
site dominates both oncologically and symptomatically,
which requires multidisciplinary discussions. Unilateral
decision-making, often by the first clinician to see the patient, can potentially limit a patient’s curative options.
Patients with asymptomatic primary tumors and CLM
requiring major hepatectomy are candidates for the reverse
approach. For patients needing minor hepatectomy, the extent of CRC resection dominates decision-making. For lowrisk CRC resections, including low anterior resections, a
simultaneous approach can be performed safely with minor
hepatectomy, potentially decreasing length of stay, cost, and
patient disability.12–14 For more extensive CRC resections,
the classic approach is safer. When indicated, patients with
rectal cancer receive preoperative chemoradiation prior to
proctectomy. Using this algorithm, there is a logical balance
of surgical risk and oncologic benefit. The major
hepatectomy rate is, as expected, lower in combined cases
(35 %) compared to the classic (66 %) sequencing.3
In properly selected patients, the reverse approach is oncologically sound with good OS.3,15 Treating the liver first offers
the ability to control metastatic disease early before potential
progression beyond resectability.16,17 Once the metastatic disease is resected, locoregional control is the next priority.
However, if the patient’s disease systemically progresses after
hepatectomy, then the patient is spared an unnecessary CRC
resection and potential ostomy.15 One important caveat regarding the reverse approach is the need for surveillance of the
primary CRC, especially in patients with malignant strictures.
Fortunately, primary site progression during systemic therapy
rarely (5–7 %) requires a strategy change.3,18
Staged resection is recommended for the following scenarios: marginal/inadequate FLR, significant comorbidities precluding longer operative time for simultaneous resection, and/
or complex operations needed at both sites (e.g., major hepatectomy plus proctectomy). When there are bleeding or obstruction concerns at the primary site, priority in sequencing
goes to the CRC. If the liver resection involves <3 segments
and other concerns that trigger the need for staged resection do
not exist (e.g., right hemicolectomy with left lateral sectionectomy), then simultaneous resection can be considered.
Metachronous Presentation of Resectable Metastases
For anatomically resectable CLM, perioperative chemotherapy is often used, but it remains controversial among liver
surgeons. Multiple studies have commented on the utility of
preoperative systemic therapy in selecting patients, improving
margin status, and downsizing metastases to resectable
criteria.19 The most relevant is the EORTC 40983 phase III
trial that compared surgery plus perioperative oxaliplatin with
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (FOLFOX) versus surgery alone for patients with one to four resectable CLM.20
Eligible patients, randomized before treatment sequencing,
had improved 3-year PFS (36.1 vs. 28.1 %, p00.041) if they
completed chemotherapy plus resection. There were more
reversible postoperative complications in the chemotherapy
patients (25 vs. 16 %, p00.04), but no increase in mortality
(1 % in each arm). The study highlighted both the ability of
perioperative chemotherapy to limit nontherapeutic laparotomies and to decrease the 3-year PFS events by one quarter.
Metachronous Presentation of Extensive (Multifocal
and Bilateral) Metastases
Similar to other malignancies, there are a significant number
of patients with CLM who present with advanced disease,
bordering on unresectability. With CLM, the issues that
need to be addressed in this population include questionable
FLR, perivascular locations, and baseline liver parenchymal
function. The ability to treat extensive CLM depends on
institutional resources (i.e., multidisciplinary teams and
interventional radiology).
CT-based volumetrics21 to calculate the FLR can identify
patients with inadequate FLR volume and, through patient
selection, lower the risk of postoperative complications.
Patients with insufficient FLR are at increased risk for
postoperative hepatic insufficiency (PHI), morbidity, and
death. To increase the FLR volume before extended hepatectomy, portal vein embolization (PVE) can be utilized to
stimulate hypertrophy of small left livers. FLR volume
>20 % is the minimum for safe hepatectomy in normal
livers.22 With chemotherapy-associated liver injury
(CALI), PVE should be used for FLR volumes ≤30 %.
The ability to hypertrophy in response to PVE is a critical
predictor of regenerative capacity following hepatectomy.
As such, an absolute percentage point increase of >5 % is
associated with significant reduction in the risk of PHI and
death.23 Frequently, patients with extensive liver disease
require two-stage hepatectomy. Combined with perioperative chemotherapy, two-stage hepatectomy +/− PVE can
result in prolonged 5-year OS of 51 %.4
After downsizing with chemotherapy, the surgical goal
should be an R0 resection of all known sites of CLM, including original sites of any lesions which may have disappeared
with complete radiographic response to preoperative therapy.
Complete radiographic response is not synonymous with
complete pathologic response. Approximately 60 % of “disappeared metastases” will recur if not resected.24
J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:195–202 197

For extensive disease, a one-stage approach using multiple subsegmentectomies (“wedge resections”) has been utilized, but this is associated with higher recurrence rates.
Despite the high recurrence rate, proponents argue that
selected patients can often undergo repeat hepatectomies to
extend survival. It is our bias in patients with extensive
disease that large volume anatomic resections, frequently
facilitated by PVE to grow the FLR, are preferable.
Metachronous Presentation of Unresectable Metastases
When patients present with anatomically unresectable CLM,
the first consideration should be the ability to downsize their
lesions to resectability. Effective chemotherapy may achieve
this goal in 10–20 % of initially unresectable patients, and
these patients who achieve resectability share long-term
survival rates that are far superior to palliative chemotherapy
and approach that of patients with initially resectable
CLM.25,26
To convert patients from unresectable to resectable, maximal tumor response is required, frequently involving the
addition of targeted agents. Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) antibody
used as targeted therapy that supplements traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy in both delaying tumor progression in
unresectable cases and inducing greater pathologic response
versus chemotherapy alone for resected tumors.27 With
these agents, the conversion rate from unresectability to
resectability can be as high as 13–23 %.26,28
Cetuximab and panitumumab are antibodies which block
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor targeted in multiple carcinomas. Cetuximab is effective in a subset (57–63 %) of
patients with KRAS wild-type tumors.29 When cetuximab
was combined with FOLFOX, patients with KRAS wildtype benefited from improved response rate (RR, 57 vs.
34 %, p00.003) and progression-free survival (PFS, 8.3
vs. 7.2 months, p00.006), compared to FOLFOX alone.29
Similarly, when cetuximab was used with irinotecan with 5-
fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRI), patients with KRAS
wild-type benefited from improved RR (57 vs. 40 %, p<
0.001), PFS (9.9 vs. 8.4 months, p00.001), and OS (23.5 vs.
20.0 months, p00.009), compared to FOLFIRI alone.30
Unlike anti-EGFR agents, bevacizumab can be used for
patients regardless of KRAS status.
Ablation
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most common method
of thermal ablation for treatment of many types of liver
tumors. Although appealing as a less invasive treatment
option, RFA is associated with higher local recurrence rates,
especially for tumors >3 cm, multiple tumors, and tumors
close to major vessels due to the heat sink effect. RFA plays
a role in surgical therapy for highly selected patients with
small tumors located away from major abdominal, biliary,
and vascular structures but should be considered inferior to
resection in terms of local control for CLM.31
Risks
Update on Chemotherapy and Chemotherapy-Associated
Liver Injury
The majority of CLM patients are treated with chemotherapy prior to liver resection. FOLFOX and FOLFIRI are the
foundations of modern chemotherapy. Because of their efficacy, clinicians have used both regimens to increase cure
rates in resectable CLM, downsize borderline resectable
cases, and attempt to convert unresectability to resectability.
This has led to longer systemic treatment durations before
surgical referral. However, extended duration (>8 cycles)
chemotherapy only increases the risk of CALI without improving pathologic response.32 Thus, all patients with CLM
should be seen by a liver surgeon before chemotherapy to
implement a multidisciplinary strategy with the goal of
truncating chemotherapy at the point of resectability and
not treating to maximal radiographic response. Further chemotherapy can be given postoperatively.
Before the adoption of FOLFOX33 and FOLFIRI34 in the
early 2000s, 5-FU was the drug of choice for metastatic
CRC.35 5-FU has been implicated with hepatic steatosis, but
the evidence for this finding is unclear. Theorized mechanisms of injury include increased production of free oxygen
species as well as direct injury to mitochondrial
membranes.36 One study in the USA suggested that patients
treated with 5-FU were twice as likely to have >30 %
steatosis versus patients not treated with 5-FU, but this
was not statistically significant.37 Others have suggested
that resected livers with steatosis may have been steatotic
prior to initiation of chemotherapy. Supporting this hypothesis, one Swiss study showed that steatosis was present in
48 % of chemotherapy-treated livers and 50 % of livers
without chemotherapy.38
The evidence implicating oxaliplatin in CALI is more
convincing. Oxaliplatin is associated with a spectrum of
vascular injuries (sinusoidal dilatation, peliosis, centrilobular necrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia), phenotypically presenting as a friable “blue liver”.
39 This
phenotype has been associated with increased transfusions
but not mortality.39 Using immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, the aforementioned Swiss study found that
79 % of patients treated with oxaliplatin had sinusoidal
damage versus 23 % in those who had no oxaliplatin (p<
198 J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:195–202

0.001). The aforementioned study in the USA also showed a
significant increase in sinusoidal injury in patients treated
with oxaliplatin. However, reliable preoperative assessment
of the extent and type of oxaliplatin-induced CALI is not
available. Preoperative liver biopsy, prone to sampling error,
is not a reliable means to detect the sinusoidal injury pattern.
Detailed post-resection pathological assessment is the only
way to confirm the sinusoidal changes.
Irinotecan has been associated with both steatosis and
steatohepatitis, especially in patients with clinical symptoms
of metabolic syndrome (obesity and diabetes).40 Macroscopically, a “yellow liver” is the result. Its mechanism of
injury is also due to mitochondrial damage from reactive
oxygen species.36 Steatohepatitis from irinotecan is the only
CALI associated with increased mortality from PHI.37 This
is a key consideration when choosing between FOLFOX
and FOLFIRI.
With regard to anti-VEGFR/PDGFR therapy, surgeons
have traditionally feared its association with postoperative
complications. However, with a treatment break, there may
be no difference in morbidity between patients using chemotherapy +/− bevacizumab.41 The optimal break has not
been prospectively analyzed, but 4–6 weeks is commonly
recommended. In practice, medical oncologists often hold
bevacizumab from the last cycle of preoperative chemotherapy. On a positive note, bevacizumab may decrease the risk
of sinusoidal injury associated with oxaliplatin.27 The major
toxicity of anti-EGFR therapy is a severe skin rash, but it is
also a marker of efficacy. While chemotherapy remains an
integral part of multimodality therapy for CLM, its clinical
efficacy must be balanced against its potential hepatotoxicity, especially with extended duration.
Quality and Outcomes
National Morbidity and Mortality Benchmarks in Liver
Surgery
Until the most recent decade, with post-hepatectomy 30-day
mortality dropping to 2.5 % nationally42 and 1 % at referral
centers, 4 3 hepatectomies were deemed high-risk
operations44 with frequent hemorrhagic events that impacted both short- and long-term outcomes.45 Outcomes derived
from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical
Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database have become an excellent resource for understanding 30-day morbidity and mortality. Although some argue that 90-day
outcomes more accurately reflect sequelae of PHI,37 multiple important risk factors have emerged from NSQIP.42 As
expected, the extent of hepatectomy correlates with the rate
of major morbidity. Other factors predictive of major morbidity include comorbidity score, smoking, elevated alkaline
phosphatase, low albumin, elevated partial thromboplastin
time, intraoperative blood transfusion, operative time, and
postoperative transfusion.42 While these variables can help
prepare the surgeon and patient for possible complications,
ultimately, the ability to recover and to be rescued from PHI
requires adequate, functional FLR volume with regenerative
capacity and the limitation of infectious complications.
Margins
Before the modern era of effective chemotherapy, when
surgery was our only effective treatment, 1-cm surgical
margins were required. A paradigm shift in chemotherapy
efficacy has changed surgeons’ tolerance for subcentimeter
margins, with data from multiple studies indicating that
simply margin-negative resection was oncologically
acceptable.46–48 Even R1 resections may benefit patients
who are good responders to chemotherapy. However, R1
resections will not benefit those with poor chemotherapy
response, since they likely have poor tumor biology.49
Survival
Survival expectations of patients with CLM over the last
decade have increased dramatically. Before modern chemotherapy, a 37 % 5-year OS was a benchmark.50 But in
modern series, patients with resected CLM can experience
up to 50–60 % 5-year OS, even with two-stage
hepatectomies.2–4 The key point is that these outcomes are
far superior to those of patients treated with chemotherapy
alone, indicating that all patients with potentially resectable
disease should be evaluated by high-quality imaging and a
multidisciplinary group that includes a liver surgeon before
starting chemotherapy. The multidisciplinary strategy goal
should be demonstration of chemotherapy response and an
R0 resection. Delaying resection until after completion of
extended duration chemotherapy (to maximal response) is
contraindicated because prolonged chemotherapy is associated with CALI, PHI, and postoperative mortality. Even
as chemotherapy regimens improve, liver surgeons will
continue to play a central role in treatment planning by
offering the best chance for prolonged survival—safe R0
resection.

Questions
1. One year after low anterior resection, your patient develops bilateral liver metastases which are potentially resectable? You and your medical oncology colleague
decide to start a short course of systemic chemotherapy
preoperatively. Your patient is 50 years old with BMI 35
and diabetes. Which regimen is best?
(a) 5-FU/leucovorin
(b) FOLFOX
(c) FOLFIRI
(d) Bevacizumab alone
2. After six cycles of preoperative chemotherapy, your
patient’s right liver metastases have partially responded.
One lesion is about 1 cm from the middle hepatic vein. In
deciding whether you can preserve the middle hepatic
vein, what resection margin is your goal?
(a) 2-cm margin
(b) 1-cm margin
(c) An R0 (negative microscopic) margin
(d) An R1 (positive microscopic, negative gross) margin
3. In a preoperative CT for a previously planned right hepatectomy, you see a new subcentimeter lesion in segment
IV that would change your operative plan and require an
extended hepatectomy, leaving <20 % FLR volume. The
lesion is too small to characterize according to the radiologist. What is the least invasive yet effective preoperative
diagnostic modality that can be used to characterize this 5-
mm lesion?
(a) Ultrasound
(b) Percutaneous needle biopsy
(c) PET/CT
(d) MRI
4. In a patient who has received preoperative FOLFOX for
six cycles before referral to you, the liver surgeon, what is
the minimum standardized FLR volume required for safe
hepatectomy?
(a) >10 %
(b) >20 %
(c) >30 %
(d) >40 %
5. You have a patient with an asymptomatic T3 rectal
cancer and bilateral liver metastases. As part of his
multidisciplinary team, you decide to use the reverse
approach, or liver-first, treatment sequencing. You
plan on systemic chemotherapy followed by liver
resection. Chemoradiation for the rectal tumor will
be delivered between liver resection and low anterior resection. Since you are delaying the chemoradiation, the patient wants to know the chances that
the T3 rectal cancer will become symptomatic requiring intervention while you are treating the metastatic disease.
(a) <10 %
(b) 10–20 %
J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:195–202 201

(c) 20–30 %
(d) >30 %
6. One year after right hemicolectomy, your patient
develops two 4-cm liver metastases in segments
VIII and VI. The patient’s performance status is
excellent with no comorbidities. What is the best
treatment strategy for prevention of recurrence?
(a) Definitive systemic chemotherapy until complete
response
(b) Open radiofrequency ablation
(c) Perioperative chemotherapy plus hepatectomy
with negative microscopic margins
(d) Hepatectomy with negative microscopic margins
but no chemotherapy
7. Your patient will require an extended right hepatectomy for bilateral liver metastases (segments IV, VI,
and VII). There is only one 3-cm lesion in segment
IV 1 cm from the middle hepatic vein. Your
patient’s calculated liver volumes for segments I, II,
and III add up to 25 %. Six cycles of FOLFOX
have already been completed. What is the best next
step toward long-term local control?
(a) More systemic chemotherapy until complete response
(b) Right hepatectomy with radiofrequency ablation of
segment IV
(c) Portal vein embolization and extended right hepatectomy if FLR reaches >30 %
(d) Partial hepatectomies, or subsegmentectomies, of all
three lesions with negative microscopic margins.
8. In the EORTC 40983 phase III trial which compared
perioperative FOLFOX plus resection versus surgery
alone for potentially resectable colorectal liver metastases,
the FOLFOX plus surgery patients had the following
results compared to their surgery-only control arm.
(a) More reversible complications, no difference in mortality rate, no difference in progression-free survival
(b) No difference in complications, no difference in mortality rate, better progression-free survival
(c) More reversible complications, higher mortality rate,
better progression-free survival
(d) More reversible complications, no difference in mortality rate, better progression-free survival
