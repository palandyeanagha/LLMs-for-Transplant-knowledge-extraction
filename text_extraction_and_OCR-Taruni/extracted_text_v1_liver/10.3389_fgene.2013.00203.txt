ABC transporters represent a large family of ATP-driven transmembrane transporters
involved in uni- or bidirectional transfer of a large variety of substrates. Divided in seven
families, they represent 48 transporter proteins, several of which have been associated
with human disease. Among the latter is ABCC6, a unidirectional exporter protein primarily
expressed in liver and kidney. ABCC6 deficiency has been shown to cause the ectopic
mineralization disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), characterized by calcification and
fragmentation of elastic fibers, resulting in oculocutaneous and cardiovascular symptoms.
Unique in the group of connective tissue disorders, the pathophysiological relation between
the ABCC6 transporter and ectopic mineralization in PXE remains enigmatic, not in the least
because of lack of knowledge on the substrate(s) of ABCC6 and its unusual expression
pattern. Because many features, including structure and transport mechanism, are shared
by many ABC transporters, it is worthwhile to evaluate if and to what extent the knowledge
on the physiology and pathophysiology of these other transporters may provide useful clues
toward understanding the (patho)physiological role of ABCC6 and how its deficiency may
be dealt with.
Keywords: pseudoxanthoma elasticum, ABCC6, ABC transporters, substrate identification, clinical variability,
integrated approach, systems biology, modifier genes
In this paper, we will summarize relevant knowledge and methods
for analysis on ABC transporters which may be useful for the
further study of ABCC6.
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from aberrant mineralization and fragmentation
of elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix of the skin, the eyes
and the cardiovascular system. It is characterized by papular
skin lesions, a retinopathy prone to hemorrhage due to subretinal neovascularisation, and premature occlusive vessel disease,
with considerable inter- and intra-familial variability of severity
(Vanakker et al., 2008). Thirteen years after the discovery of the
causal relation between ABCC6 mutations and PXE, significant
progress has been made in the characterization of the ABCC6 gene
and the transporter it encodes (Bergen et al., 2000; Le Saux et al.,
2000). Nevertheless, ABCC6 remains surrounded by a number of
unsolved enigmas, including its substrates and physiological functions as well as the mechanisms by which it is connected to ectopic
elastic fiber mineralization. Further, the significant variability in
clinical severity of the PXE phenotype cannot be explained by
the ABCC6 mutations, as demonstrated by numerous negative
genotype-phenotype correlation studies (Meloni et al., 2001; Gheduzzi et al., 2004; Chassaing et al., 2005; Pfendner et al., 2007).
This suggested the involvement of modifier genes, influencing
particularly the severity of PXE symptoms (Zarbock et al., 2009).
Despite marked structural resemblance with other ABC transporters, ABCC6 has been considered the odd man out, due to
its unique relation with a connective tissue disease affecting tissues in which it is hardly expressed. Drawing analogies between
ABCC6 and the other ABC transporters has been done in the past,
particularly to gain insights in substrate interactions. While, after
more than a decade, the identification of this substrate is being
further pursued, it may be a good time to evaluate if information
on other ABC transporters as well as the difficulties that were and
are still encountered in their study may point out potential pitfalls,
concepts and approaches on how to deal with the challenges in the
field of PXE.
THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF ABCC6
Perhaps one of the most intriguing questions surrounding ABCC6
is the nature of its substrate and hence the physiological function of the transporter. Following unsuccessful comparisons, it
is doubtful that the function of other members of the ABC transporterfamily will imply anything concerning the actualfunction of
ABCC6 (Madon et al., 2000). It has been previously demonstrated
in plant ABC transporters that – despite phylogenetic similarities and domain homologies – related ABC transporters can in
fact serve diverse physiological functions. In humans, this was
endorsed through the comparison of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ABCC7 or CFTR, the gene for cystic
fibrosis) and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1 or MDR – multidrug resistance protein; Luckie et al., 2003). This however does not imply
that nothing can be learned from previous experiences with functional dissection of ABC transporters. Awareness has risen for
several of these that the complexity of (patho)physiological mechanisms related to the wild type and mutant transporter is much
higher than anticipated; in this respect and based on our current
knowledge, ABCC6 will probably not be an exception to the rule.
This enlarging complexity began with the changing concept of

substrate specificity. For several ABC transporters either one or a
small number of closely related substrates are known. However,
there have been reports of other transporters, such as ABCC1,
ABCC2 or ABCB1, for which multispecificity for a diverse range
of substrates has been shown (Jemnitz et al., 2010; He et al., 2011).
The diversity of (patho)physiological observations in PXE – oxidative stress, the PXE serum factor, vitamin K deficiency, the relation
with ENPP1, does not make it unthinkable that they result from
aberrant transport of more then one substrate, thus influencing more than one physiological process (Le Saux et al., 2006;
Pasquali-Ronchetti et al., 2006; Vanakker et al., 2010; Nitschke
et al., 2011). For many ABC transporters – including ABCC6 – the
specific sequences responsible for substrate recognition have not
yet been identified, which may add to the complexity of substrate
identification (Glavinas et al., 2004). Nevertheless, for some transporters such as ABCC2 and Pgp, binding-site models have been
proposed usingrelatively high accuracy in silico methods. Such
models include the presence of one large binding site and multiple
smaller ones, primary and secondary binding sites or three distinct
sites (Hirono et al., 2005; Borst et al., 2006; Pedersen et al., 2008;
Ferreira et al., 2013).
These in silico approaches such as molecular docking, though
insufficiently reliable to pinpoint with certainty the physiological
substrates, may also have the advantage to generate a list of potential substrates in a cost- and time-efficient manner. Subsequently,
these predictions need to be validated in vivo. Several approaches
can be applied to identify physiological compounds transported
by ABC proteins, such as in vivo hepatobiliairy elimination studies
in mutant animal models, and using membrane vesicles or functional assays based on mass spectrometry (Ci et al., 2007; Katona
et al., 2009; Jemnitz et al., 2010). Though murine model organisms
are commonly used for such experiments and the Abcc6 knockout mouse model largely recapitulates the clinical features of PXE,
there have been reports emphasizing the differences in the physiological mechanisms between rodents and humans, which may
slow down substrate identification (Ivan et al., 2013). This has
been the case for the ABCG2 protein, recently discovered to be
an urate transporter (Nakayama et al., 2011). It should remind
us to be cautious to extrapolate findings (positive or negative)
in other species to the human disease. Remembering the adage
that humans remain the most optimal model to search for substrate(s), an interesting approach for substrate screening has been
reported for ABCC2 (Krumpochova et al., 2012). To determine the
extent of its substrate spectrum, a variant on the classic vesicular
transport experiments has been applied to extract substrates from
body fluids. Classic vesicular transport studies have as a drawback
that an upfront hypothesis about the transported compounds is
necessary and that only one substrate can be evaluated at a time.
Certainly, the necessity of an upfront hypothesis is a major disadvantage with respect to ABCC6. By incubating the vesicles in body
fluids (in the case of Abcc2 murine urine) and analyzing the vesicle
content by LC/MS, several novel compounds were identified. To
apply this technique for ABCC6 would imply the use of human
plasma and/or hepatocytes. This transportomics technique has
great potential with several advantages including a reduced number of experimental animals and would mean that identification
of compounds is not a prerequisite to study their transport in
vesicular transport experiments as one can fish for new substrates.
Combining transportomics with untargeted metabolomics analysis would further increasethe range of potential substrates that
can be identified. Disadvantages of the technique include that it is
less suitable for identifying hydrophobic substrates. The complex
composition of body fluids may require. fractionation to limit the
effect of regulators of the transporter which could mask transport
of some substrates (Krumpochova et al., 2012).
After several years of tranquility, the expression profile of
ABCC6 has again been the subject of debate. ABCC6 is predominantly expressed at the basolateral side of liver and kidney
cells, though the transporter also has differential expression in the
gut and gastro-intestinal tract (Sinkó et al., 2003; Mutch, 2004;
Pomozi et al., 2013). Recently, a supposed intracellular location
in the mitochondria-associated membrane (MEM) – part of the
ER complex – has been described (Martin et al., 2012). Though
the shift in the paradigm linking the expression and function of
ABCC6 to the hepatic and renal plasma membrane (PM), which
is declared in this paper, should be reviewed with skepticism – the
amount of evidence locating ABCC6 in the PM is after all overwhelming – the concept of an additional intracellular localization
is potentially interesting and may further increase the complexity of the pathophysiological enigma at hand. This issue has been
the topic of debate in recent papers by respectively Martin et al.
(2012, 2013) and Pomozi et al. (2013). Demonstrating again the
PM localization of ABCC6, the latter group could not confirm
the MEM localization while the former called on methodological
arguments to defend their findings (Martin et al., 2013; Pomozi
et al., 2013). Challenging the cellular localization of proteins is not
unprecedented in the ABC superfamily. Recently, the position of
the ABCB6 transporter, originally thought to function in mitochondrial porphyrin metabolism, was challenged and extensively
documented with experimental and literature data (Kiss et al.,
2012). Despite the critical review and convincing evidence of the
true physiological function of ABCB6, the authors did not completely exclude a contribution of ABCB6 to porphyrin metabolism
and appealed for further and thorough study of the true pathophysiological function(s) of this transporter (Kiss et al., 2012). The
knowledge on the subcellular localization of a native protein is of
critical importance to model and understand the pathophysiology
of any disease. Therefore, unity should be achieved regarding the
PM localization of the ABCC6 transporter, but as with ABCB6 I
would at this point not completely reject the idea of an additional
intracellular localization of ABCC6. In view of the current contradictory results on the potential MEM localization, further work
should be done to clarify this issue as the abnormal mitochondrial
morphology and membrane potential in PXE – mentioned by
Martin et al. (2012) as supporting evidence is insufficient; indeed,
it has been demonstrated for the renal ABCB1 transporter that
morphological abnormalities of the mitochondria can occur in the
absence of a mitochondrial localization, possibly due to accumulation of toxic products (Huls et al., 2007). It cannot be excluded that
ABCC6 may move between different membrane compartments
under particular conditions, which theoretically may explain the
contradicting findings for MEM localization. This has been shown
for the PM ABCA1 transporter which, in the absence of extracellular Apo-AI, can be sequestered on intracellular membranes or

degraded (Tang et al., 2009). As one particular protein can serve
strictly different functions in separate parts of the same cell – in
view of the complexity of what we know on PXE, this might not
even be so unexpected – a validated intracellular localization of
ABCC6 may help us further to understand the disease (Kumar
and Snyder, 2002).
Though much attention has been paid to the expression of the
ABCC6 transporter in the liver, its presence in the kidney, gut
and the intestinal tract are less frequently the focus of attention.
It has been shown for ABC transporters such as ABCC2 that the
ABC protein may have different organ-specific functions (Jemnitz
et al., 2010). Where in the liver it functions in biliairy transport, in
the kidney it is involved in the excretion of small organic anions.
A similar tissue-dependent function was shown for ABCA1 and
ABCG1 (Tarling et al., 2013). Specifically addressing these extrahepatic ABCC6 proteins is necessary as it is not unconceivable that
for example the mucosal involvement in PXE may depend on or
be modulated by the intestinal ABCC6 transporter.
REGULATION OF ABCC6
Distinct pathways are involved in the regulation of ABC transporters, comprising genetic, epigenetic and nuclear-receptor
mediated mechanisms, as well as post-transcriptional target
repression by microRNAs (miRNAs), which can be triggered by
hormones, growthfactors and exogenousfactors. Several examples
exist of ABC transporters, such as Pgp, MRP4, BCRP, whose regulation depends on a combination of mechanisms (Masereeuw and
Russel, 2012). Nuclear factor regulation and methylation dependent epigenetic regulation has been described for ABCC6 (Arányi
et al., 2005; de Boussac et al., 2010; Ratajewski et al., 2012). So far,
no correlation with the PXE phenotype, its variability or potential
therapeutic approaches has been attempted. The influence of epigenetic changes, such as promotor DNA methylation, on disease
variability has been shown for ABCA1 and coronary artery disease
and various drug transporters such as ABCB1and MDR1 (Baker
et al., 2005; Reed et al., 2008; Guay et al., 2012). Therapeutic consequences may include the use of histone deacytelase inhibitors, as
reported for MDR1 (Jiang et al., 2009).
MicroRNA is a family of short non-coding RNAs involved in
the negative regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level (He and Hannon, 2004). With a few hundred miRNAs
identified, it is estimated that 50% of the protein-coding genes
are regulated by them. Among ABC transporters, miRNA dependent regulation has been documented for CFTR, MRP2 and 4, PgP
and BCRP, either directly or indirectly through nuclear factors
(Borel et al., 2012; Oglesby et al., 2013). In the CFTR gene, variants have been described that may influence the miRNA target sites
in the 3 UTR (Amato et al., 2013). It has been suggested that certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can influence the
affinity for inhibitory miRNAs and may explain the differences
in clinical expression between patients with an identical genotype. Mutations in the 3 UTR have also been described in the
ABCC6 gene, so the involvement of miRNAs in PXE pathophysiology may not be purely theoretical. Identification of such miRNAs
does not only open the possibility of using modulators, such as
chemically engineered oligonucleotides called antagomirs, with
the goal of influencing mechanisms that underlie disease initiation
or progression (Masereeuw and Russel, 2012). Of interest is that
miRNAs have been demonstrated useful biomarkers in kidney disease (Amato et al., 2013; De Guire et al., 2013). The development
of an accurate biomarker set for PXE, which does not yet exist,
will enable clinical studies to determine whether a compound has
a clinically significant effect on the PXE phenotype.
CLINICAL VARIABILITY
The clinical variability of the PXE phenotype remains a challenge
for patients and physicians, making an individualized approach
at this moment nearly impossible. Because of the lack of correlations between the patients phenotype and ABCC6 genotype, the
possibility of modifier genes has been suggested (Hendig et al.,
2007; Zarbock et al., 2010, 2009). The number of potential modifier genes in PXE is currently still limited, which is not totally
unexpected; for many ABC transporters the identification of clinical modulators remains challenging. The clinical variability in
PXE shows similarities with the variability in cystic fibrosis (CF),
the clinical course of which is also difficult to predict using the
ABCC7 mutations. Consequently, the quest for modifier genes
has started and several modifiers of pulmonary outcome in CF
have been described (Blaisdell et al., 2004; Boyle, 2007; Weiler and
Drumm, 2012; von Kanel et al., 2013). The search for CF modifiers
has lead to several recommendations which are equally valid for
ABCC6. First, the importance of an in depth, unambiguous and
universal definition of the phenotype has been deemed extremely
important. Indeed, the description of the clinical features of the
PXE phenotype is often inconsistent in different reports, even
when tools such as the Phenodex® are available (Pfendner et al.,
2007). A more standardized definition of the phenotypic features
will allow a more reliable identification and comparison of modifiers. Further, the limitations of association studies where the
relationship between phenotype and polymorphisms in candidate
modifier genes is examined have become clear, with the possibility
of false positive studies or the causal effect of other genes which
may travel with the candidate gene(s) (Nadeau, 2001; Accurso and
Sontag, 2003). Finally, a study in twins and siblings in CF indicates
that functions directly related to CFTR, membrane ion transport
and/or intracellular trafficking of mutant protein are subject to
modifier effects (Bronsveld et al., 2000, 2001). Identification of
modifiers for functions directly related to the ABC transporter
may also yield further insights in the pathophysiology of PXE
and provide novel therapeutic targets. Next generation sequencing
(NGS), a revolutionizing sequencing technique enabling parallel
sequencing of multiple genes and whole exome sequencing is also
an opportunity to identify modifier genes and variants, particularly in rare disorders in which large cohorts are often difficult
to gather. By combining analysis of extreme phenotypes with
pathway analysis, significant power can still be obtained, as was
demonstrated by using NGS in CF (Emond et al., 2012).
Modifier genes may not be the only mechanism involved in the
variability of PXE. For several ABC transporters, compensatory
mechanisms have been described. These include upregulation of
MRP3 expression in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, thus compensating for the impaired ABCC2 function (Masereeuw and Russel,
2012). Such compensatory mechanisms have also been suggested
for PXE. Gene expression profiling of ABC transporters in dermal
www.frontiersin.org October 2013 | Volume 4 | Article 203 | 3

Vanakker et al. ABCC6: lessons from ABC transporters
fibroblasts revealed increased expression of seven genes, including ABCC2 and several members of the A-subfamily (Hendig
et al., 2008). The latter was further explored in hepatocytes of
a knock-out mouse model where tissue specific upregulation
of Abca4 was demonstrated in the liver (Li and Uitto, 2011).
However, no further studies have investigated other potential
compensatory mechanisms, though they may be of significant
importance in understanding PXE,for aiming a more personalized
follow-up of patients and for the introduction of novel therapeutic
approaches.
AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH FOR PXE RESEARCH
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is one of the diseases where, through
the dedicated work of a relatively small group of researchers, a
large number of data and observations are gathered. To take on
the challenges that we are facing in the field of PXE, integration
of all these data and findings may ultimately be the most difficult though imperative step to move forward efficiently. One
interesting initiative in this respect is the Clinical and Functional
Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) project, which presents a novel
approach to clinical and functional annotation of mutations in
the CFTR gene. Within this project, clinical and molecular data
are gathered from CF registries and centers, in a standardized
way and under the control of data managers. Further, data on
functional assessment of mutations was added (Castellani and
CFTR2 team,2013). Though valuable initiatives have been taken to
establish mutation database for ABCC6, and linking these molecular data to phenotypical characteristics, no such comprehensive
database is currently available. A comprehensive database would
improve our ability to identify biomarkers and interpret underlying mechanisms of disease variability in PXE. This database
would ideally incorporate information on functional mutation
data, potential or established modifier variants, exome sequencing
data, serum measurements of patients, fibroblast observations,
proteomics, metabolomics and other -omics in clinically wellcharacterized patients. This is expected to enhance diagnostics,
carrier testing and screening, genotype-phenotype correlations,
modifier analysis and insights into pathogenesis and therapies. It
can be concluded that the other members of the ABC transporter
family can provide us with valuable information and useful precedents for further characterizing the ABCC6 transporter. Perhaps
the most important lesson to incorporate in current PXE research
is the concept that only an integrative approach will finally enable
us to elucidate this disease completely. To this purpose, it is therefore imperative that joint initiatives can be outlined to merge and
integrate past, present and future research data.
