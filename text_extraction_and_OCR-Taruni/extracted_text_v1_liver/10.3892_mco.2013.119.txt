Abstract. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the 
most common malignant tumors with a high rate of morbidity 
and mortality. HCC affects approximately one million individuals annually worldwide, with the incidence equal to the 
mortality rate. In 2008, HCC was listed as the third most 
lethal cancer. Thus, early diagnosis is crucial for improving 
the survival rate for patients. α-fetoprotein (AFP) together 
with iconography and pathology detection are commonly 
used in the clinical early diagnosis of liver cancer. However, 
the specificity and sensitivity of AFP used in screening for 
liver cancer are not satisfactory. Athough the development of 
molecular biology has led to the identification of new tumor 
markers, including proteantigens, cytokines, enzymes and 
isoenzymes, as well as related genes that can be used in the 
treatment and prognosis of liver cancer, more tumor markers 
are required for effective early diagnosis of diseases and 
monitoring of the curative effect.

1. Introduction
Primary hepatic cancer (PHC) is one of the most common 
malignant tumors with 90-95% of liver cancer being hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver cancer exhibits no symptoms 
in the early stage, whereas clinical symptoms are evident 
in the advanced stage, leading to an unsatisfactory curative 
effect. In 2008, HCC was listed as the third most lethal cancer 
type (1). Findings of a previous study suggested that early 
diagnosis of HCC and effective treatment are likely to prolong 
the lifetime of liver cancer patients (2). Thus, the identification 
of new high sensitivity and specificity markers for HCC are 
essential.
α-fetoprotein (AFP) together with iconography and 
pathology detection are commonly used in clinical early 
diagnosis for liver cancer. However, the widely used marker 
AFP does not yield satisfactory results in the early diagnosis 
of HCC, particularly AFP-negative HCC. These false-negative 
results limit the universality of its application. In recent years, 
the development of molecular biology has led to the successful 
exploration and identification of markers for HCC, which is 
expected to improve the early diagnostic rate, treatment effect 
in addition to curative satisfaction.
2. Embryonic antigen
AFP. AFP is the most widely used tumor biomarker currently 
available for the early detection of HCC. Findings of a previous 
clinical study demonstrated that serum AFP had a sensitivity of 41-65% and specificity of 80-94% when the cut-off 
value is 20 ng/ml (3). However, the following issues should 
be considered with regard to early diagnosis: i) the positive 
rate of AFP in HCC is only 60-80%, making it a limitation; 
ii) false-positive, AFP results are positive during pregnancy, as 
well as for active liver disease, embryonic tumor and certain 
gastrointestinal tumors; iii) false-negative, limitations in terms 
of sensitivity in different detection methods. Additionally, a 
small hepatic tumor results in AFP expression being lower 
than the limit of detection, whereas AFP expression is delayed 
or higher than the limit of detection when the tumor is large, 
yielding AFP-negative HCC.
AFP heterogeneity. The development and applications of 
biological chemistry and related analysis, as well as additional 
study of AFP have revealed that AFP has three glycoforms

(AFP-L1, AFP-L2 and AFP-L3), according to their binding 
ability to the lectin lens agglutinin (LCA). AFP-L1, as a nonLCA-bound heterogeneity, is a major glycoform in various 
benign liver diseases. By contrast, AFP-L3, as an LCA-bound 
heterogeneity, exists only in the serum of patients with HCC 
at a cut-off value of 15%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 
96.9 and 92%, respectively, in detecting HCC (4). The sensitivity and specificity of AFP-l3 are both relatively satisfactory 
as compared with AFP. Moreover, AFP-L3 does not correlate 
with AFP, thus the former can be used as an independent and 
significant factor for the early diagnosis of HCC. Specifically, 
for HCC patients with a total AFP of 10-200 ng/ml, when 
the cut-off value of AFP-L3 is 35%, the diagnostic specificity for HCC reaches 100%, thereby improving the early 
diagnostic rate (5). Using the µTAS method, ALP-L3% was 
detected with high sensitivity in the diagnosis of HCC at 
stage I or when the tumor size was <2 cm (42.5 and 46.0%, 
respectively). When the cut-off value of AFP-L3% is 5%, the 
sensitivity for HCC reaches 47.2% compared with that of 
38% for total AFP (6). Consequently, AFP-L3 is expected to 
be a useful marker for HCC.
3. Proteantigen
HSP. Heat shock protein (HSP) is a highly conserved stress 
response protein. It can protect cells and promote them 
to repair the damage caused by a variety of stimuli. HSP 
is expressed under physiological and stress conditions, 
including carcinogenesis. By immunohistochemical staining, 
Joo et al (7) identified the positive rate of HSP70 and HSP27 
to be 56.3 and 61.9%, respectively, in HCC tissues. The stained 
intensity of HSP70 was positively correlated with tumor size, 
portal vein invasion and tumor stage, while HSP27 was only 
associated with HCC which are infected by hepatitis B virus 
(HBV). In the microenvironment of hepatocarcinoma, the 
overexpression of HSP70 and HSP27 was able to promote 
tumor growth and metastasis (8).
HSP70 may be used as an indicator of prognosis for HCC. 
Its expression was observed in 282 of 392 HCC cases (71.9%), 
whereas only 14 of 115 non-neoplastic liver tissues expressed 
HSP70 (P<0.001) (9). The sensitivity and specificity in 
detecting HCC were identified as 57.5 and 85%, respectively (10). Furthermore, the expression of HSP70 is correlated 
with differentiation and apoptosis of tumor cells. It promotes 
tumor cell growth by stabilizing cyclin D1 and suppresses the 
apoptosis of tumor cells by inhibiting the p53 pathway (11,12). 
Thus, HSP70 and HSP27 are potential markers for HCC and 
should be further investigated.
Glypican-3 (GPC3). GPC3 is a family of the heparan sulfate 
proteoglycans that is linked to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (13). GPC3 is involved in 
the process of regulating cell growth, development, differentiation and migration. sGPC3, which lack GPI, inhibit the 
growth of HCC by removing several pro-tumorigenic growth 
factors including Wnts, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from the surface 
of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo (14). The expression of GPC3 
was upregulated in HCC tumor tissues compared with normal 
and benign liver diseases and contributed to promoting the 
growth of HCC by stimulating Wnt signaling (15). In addition, 
no correlation between GPC3 expression and tumor stage, size 
and AFP level has been observed. The sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of HCC was found to be 77 and 96%, 
respectively (16). On the strength of these results, GPC3 is a 
potential marker for HCC.
SCCA. Squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), a serine 
protease inhibitor isolated from cervical carcinoma, is typically expressed in epithelial tumors and protects tumor cells 
from apoptosis. Guido et al found that the expression of SCCA 
in HCC (93%) and dysplastic nodule (100%) is significantly 
higher than the regenerative nodule (29%), suggesting that 
the expression of SCCA increased in the early stages of HCC 
formation (17). In addition, high SCCA values in the tumor 
were inversely correlated with the nodule size (18), which had 
a sensitivity and specificity of 84 and 46%, respectively, in 
detecting HCC (19). The high sensitivity and low specificity 
were complementary with AFP. Thus, SCCA was a valuable 
supplement marker for the diagnosis of HCC.
SCCA-IgM IC is a circulating immune complex composed 
of SCCA and IgM. It was undetectable in the sera of a healthy 
control population. However, in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis 
and HCC, the detection rates of SCCA-IgM IC were 18, 26 
and 70%, respectively. No correlation was identified with 
AFP level (20). Furthermore, in patients with LC progressing 
towards HCC, SCCA-IgM IC was consistently increased and 
had higher sensitivity compared with AFP (21). Therefore, 
SCCA-IgM IC may be a novel valuable serum marker for 
HCC. A combination of SCCA-IgM IC and AFP can thus 
improve the diagnostic rate.
Golgi protein 73 (GP73). GP73 (also known as Golph2 and 
GOLM1) is a type II Golgi-specific membrane protein that 
is coded by the GOLM1 gene on chromosome 9q21.33 (22). 
It is significantly elevated in various types of cancer, such 
as lung adenocarcinoma (23), seminomas (24) and renal cell 
cancer (25). However, GP73, is closely associated with liver 
diseases, particularly HCC, and has received increasing 
attention. Results of recent studies have shown that the serum 
GP73 is significantly elevated in primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC)(26,27). In liver cirrhosis it is not only elevated, but 
also higher than in HCC, whether infection is caused by HBV 
or hepatitis C virus (HCV) (28). By contrast, in normal liver, 
GP73 is expressed by biliary epithelial cells, but minimally by 
hepatocytes (29). Thus, GP73 is a significant factor in many 
hepatic diseases. In their study, Mao et al (31) demonstrated 
that GP73 in the serum of patients with HCC infected by HBV 
was significantly higher compared with HBV carriers, patients 
without hepatic diseases and healthy adults. The sensitivity of 
diagnosis of HCC (76.9%) was markedly elevated compared 
with AFP (48.6%), suggesting GP73 is a novel and effective 
serum biomarker for the diagnosis of HCC (30,31).
Additional investigations identified fucosylated GP73 
(FC-GP73). Compared with total GP73, FC-GP73 improves 
the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of HCC from 
65-90 to 90-100%, respectively. For GP73-negative or low 
levels, detection of FC-GP73 is a viable option (32). Although 
the study for GP73 is optimistic, there are limitations that 
should be considered such as the fact that the correlation 

MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY 1: 593-598, 2013 595
between GP73 and tumor size, stage, recurrence and prognosis 
should be extensively investigated. Specifically, the mechanism 
for GP73 and HCC development remains to be elucidated. 
Thus, role of GP73 in the clinic remains to be determined.
Tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72). TAG-72 is a macromolecular glycoprotein complex similar to mucin-1 (MUC-1). 
It is overexpressed in the majority of human adenocarcinomas 
including gastric, colon and pancreatic cancer. However, it is 
rarely expressed in normal tissues. Recent studies (33) found 
that the expression of TAG-72 is significantly elevated in HCC 
tissues compared with normal liver tissues. Its increased expression may promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, 
overexpression of TAG-72 is closely correlated with poor 
survival in patients with HCC (33). Thus, TAG-72 is a potential 
prognostic marker for HCC, which has important clinical implications. Moreover, anti-TAG-72 monoclonal antibody has been 
used for the clinical detection of tumors (34).
Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG). ZAG, a soluble glycoprotein, 
is a member of the class Ι major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC-Ι) family. Due to its high homology of the amino 
acid sequence with the lipid mobilizing factor (LMF), we 
considered it a novel adipokine. ZAG is downregulated in 
human obesity (35). By contrast, it is upregulated in several 
types of cancer such as breast, lung and prostate cancer and 
is considered as a potential biomarker for these cancer types. 
By analyzing the serum proteome of the HCC group, liver 
cirrhosis group and healthy adults, we confirmed that the ZAG 
protein is overexpressed in the HCC group, suggesting it is a 
novel candidate biomarker for the early diagnosis of HCC (36).
4. Enzymes and isozymes
Des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP). DCP is an abnormal 
protein induced by the absence of vitamin K. When the 
liver cells are in the process of malignant transformation, an 
obstacle occurs for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation 
system. Insufficient reaction of γ-glutamyl carboxylation 
causes the production of DCP (37). The level of DCP in the 
serum of patients with HCC was significantly higher than that 
in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. The diagnostic 
sensitivity of DCP was weaker compared with AFP when 
HCC was <3 cm in diameter, while it was stronger compared 
with AFP when HCC was >5 cm in diameter (38). However, 
Baek et al recently demonstrated that irrespective of whether 
the diameter of HCC is <3 cm, 3-5 cm or >5 cm, the diagnostic 
accuracy of DCP was higher than that of AFP (39). In addition, the combined detection of DCP and AFP can improve the 
diagnostic sensitivity and can be used to predict the recurrence 
of HCC within 6 months after surgery (40). By contrast, the 
level of DCP is closely associated with a larger tumor, vascular 
invasion and it serves as a more accurate tumor marker 
compared with AFP and AFP-L3 (41).
γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT). GGT, a plasma membranebound enzyme, is synthesized in the microsomes of human 
cells. It is highest in embryo livers and decreases rapidly to 
the lowest levels after birth (42). The activity of serum GGT 
is extremely low in healthy adults, but stimulations such as 
cholestasis and inflammation can improve the level of serum 
GGT to varying degrees. GGT mRNA is widely distributed in 
the liver tissues of healthy adults, patients with liver disease, 
benign liver tumor and HCC (4). The development of HCC due 
to cancer cell inverse differentiation is similar to the embryonic stage, improving the level of serum GGT to a moderate 
or high degree. Therefore, GGT may serve as a marker for 
HCC. However, the sensitivity of GGT to detect small HCC is 
only 43.8% (43). This enzyme is therefore only used to aid in 
the diagnosis of HCC. In addition, it has been previously shown 
that simultaneous determination of GGT, DCP and AFP can 
significantly improve the rate of diagnosis of HCC (44).
α-l-fucosidase (AFU). AFU is a lysosomal enzyme widely 
present in human cells, blood and body fluid. It can be detected 
in the serum of healthy adults, although its activity increases in 
the serum of HCC patients. Additionally, it does not correlate 
with tumor size or the level of AFP (45). It has been reported 
that the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 
AFU at the cut-off value of 2.3005 µmol/l/min were 90, 97.5 
and 94.9%, respectively. The combined detection of AFP and 
AFU can improve the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic 
accuracy of AFP from 70, 85 and 79.7%, respectively, to 95, 100 
and 99.1%, respectively (46). In addition, AFU can reveal the 
case 6-9 months earlier than ultrasonographic visualization (47). 
Thus, AFU may be a valuable supplementary marker in HCC 
detection. However, the specificity of AFU is relatively poor, 
and is also overexpressed in diabetes, pancreatitis and hypothyroidism patients. The activity of AFU is also susceptible to 
ethnicity. Therefore, the clinical value of AFU requires additional investigation.
5. Cytokines
Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). TGF-β1 is a 
pluripotent growth factor involved in the regulation of cell 
proliferation, differentiation, embryo formation, angiogenesis, 
invasion and immune function. It is highly expressed in tumor 
cells, inhibiting the proliferation of tumor specific cytotoxic 
T lymphocytes (CTL) and NK cells, promoting the growth of 
tumor cells. The level of serum TGF-β1 has been reported to 
be elevated in HCC patients compared with healthy adults or 
patients with non-malignant liver disease (48). It could induce 
microvascular abnormalities through the downregulation of 
neural cell adhesion molecules in human HCC (49). TGF-β1 
and TGF-β1 mRNA may be used as sensitive indicators to diagnose HCC which is induced by HBV, with the sensitivity and 
specificity being 89.5 and 94.0%, respectively, when TGF-β1 is 
>1.2 µg/l (50). The study of TGF-β1 demonstrated that TGF-β1 
mediated different biological effects through different signaling 
pathways. The polymorphism of TGF-β1 expression can affect 
susceptibility to tumor. TGF-β1 signaling pathway as a tumor 
therapeutic target has become a hot spot.
VEGF. VEGF is well known to play a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis by inducing new vessel formation and promoting tumor 
invasion and metastasis. The expression of VEGF is higher in 
HCC patients. Xiang et al (51) revealed that VEGF is a type 
of biomarker of lymph node metastasis in HCC. In addition, 
the expression of VEGF is closely correlated with tumor recur-

596 JIE et al: NEWER BIOMARKERS IN HCC
rence and prognosis. Of note, some VEGF receptor expression 
has been found to correlate with the development of tumor (52). 
Knockdown of VEGF165 is able to inhibit the proliferation, 
migration and adhesion ability of HCC cells by increasing 
the expression of p53 signaling molecules (52). Therefore, the 
overexpression of VEGF may be useful as a biologic marker of 
tumor invasiveness and in predicting poor prognosis.
6. Genetic biomarkers
AFP mRNA. AFP mRNA is considered the most valuable 
marker for circulating HCC cells and is only present in active 
HCC cells. If other interferences such as genital tumors and 
peripheral blood are excluded, AFP mRNA could be used as a 
significant marker for spreading of HCC in blood. In advanced 
liver cancer, the rate of AFP mRNA expression reaches 100%. 
Moreover, the value of AFP mRNA serves as a predictor for 
HCC recurrence. However, use of this marker is controversial, 
possibly due to the blood-borne dispersion of normal liver cells 
and tumor cells and the mis-transcription of mRNA encoding 
AFP by peripheral mononuclear cells (4). The positive rate of 
AFP mRNA in the recrudescent patients was 82.4%, significantly higher compared with the group without recurrence (53). 
Thus, AFP mRNA effectively predicts tumor recurrence and 
metastasis following surgery.
MicroRNAs. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that 
effectively block translation by promoting the degradation of 
target mRNAs or binding to complementary sequences in the 
3' untranslated region (UTR). In recent years, the association 
between microRNAs and tumors has becomes a point of debate. 
MiR-500 (miRNA) is a potential candidate biomarker for HCC, 
as proven by Yamamoto et al(54), using a global miRNA expression profile in mouse liver development. This profile was highly 
expressed in embryo liver, downregulated in the process of liver 
development and then upregulated in the process of cirrhosis. 
Based on miRNA microarray, miR-29 was downregulated in 
HCC cells, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker for HCC 
therapy (55). Moreover, miR-199a/b-3p was also downregulated 
in HCC compared with normal liver and hepatitis liver, indicating its role as a prognostic target for HCC (56). MiR-122 is 
a liver-specific microRNA that is downregulated in HCC cells. 
Overexpression of miR-122 maintained cells in G2/M phase 
by regulating MDR expression (57). However, loss of miR-122 
promoted HCC cell migration and invasion, rendering miR-122 
a prognostic target for HCC.
An analysis of the miRNA signatures of a large number 
of tumor samples revealed that only miR-21 is upregulated in 
the tumors (58). Moreover, similar results have demonstrated 
that miR-21 is a central oncomiR (59). Plasma miR-21 level in 
patients with HCC was significantly higher than that in patients 
with chronic hepatitis and healthy individuals. It promoted 
HCC growth by regulating the expression of PENT and PENTrelated pathways (60). ROC analysis revealed the sensitivity and 
specificity to be 87.3 and 92%, respectively, differentiating HCC 
patients from healthy adults. Thus, miR-21 is also a promising 
biomarker of HCC (61).
Related genes. ∆-like 1 homolog (DLK1) is a newly identified hepatic stem/progenitor cell marker in fetal livers which 
is crucial in the oncogenesis of HCC. DLK1 is usually 
only expressed in embryonic, kidney and neuronal tissue.

However, in HCC, DLK1 expression is significantly elevated 
and a similar phenomenon was also observed in small 
cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and leukemia, suggesting 
that DLK1 is important in the occurrence of these tumors. 
Jin et al (62) reported that DLK1 expression does not 
correlate with AFP level and tumor metastasis, suggested 
DLK1 is an independent prognostic marker (62).
Hepatoma-associated gene (HTA) is a tumor differentially 
expressed gene obtained by bioinformatic analysis. Findings of 
a recent study showed that HTA is present only in tumors and 
absent in normal tissues. It is tumor-specific and the positive rate 
is extremely high in HCC in particular, suggesting a key role in 
the diagnosis and treatment of HCC (63).
Villin1 (Vil1) is a newly identified marker for HCC. The 
upregulation of Villin1 mRNA in high serum AFP-associated 
HCC tumor tissues induced poor differentiation, vascular invasion, advanced cancer stage and recurrence-free survival. Thus, 
Vil1 is a potential candidate molecular marker for high serum 
AFP-associated HCC (64).
7. Conclusions
Tumor progression is a complex disease process involving 
various factors, changes of various genes, and the development 
of multiple stages. During tumor progression, the number, 
species, distribution and expression level of tumor markers in 
patients with HCC exhibit variations that are closely associated 
with the occurrence, development, transfer, effect and prognosis 
of tumors. Large numbers of HCC markers exist in the clinical 
setting, however, most single indicators lack specificity of the 
tissues and organs. Furthermore, the single indicator results 
in the varying degrees of false positivity in certain benign 
diseases. Therefore, effective test strategies should be considered to improve the early diagnostic rate of HCC including: 
i) the combined detection of several serum markers that can 
complement each other in order to improve the early diagnostic 
rate. The sensitivity of AFP-L3, FC-GP73, AFU and SCCA 
is superior to that of AFP (Table I). Combined detection can 
increase the rate of diagnosis of HCC and reduce misdiagnosis. 
Other markers including GPC3 and TGF-β1 have a very high 
specificity. Combined detection with AFP can significantly 
improve the ability of identification and diagnosis for HCC. 
ii) Selection of different indices based on different detection 
purposes: for example, AFP mRNA, TGF-β1 and VEGF 
should be the first option in the prediction of HCC metastasis. 
iii) Diagnosis of HCC at the genetic level through the detection 
of the expression of AFP mRNA in peripheral blood, which 
is likely to improve the early diagnostic rate of HCC, as well 
as predict the transfer and recurrence of tumors. iv) The diagnosis of HCC must be combined with clinical manifestation, 
iconography detection and histological examination. Additional 
studies are likely to yield novel markers and adopt more effective combined detection methods to improve the sensitivity and 
specificity of diagnosis of HCC, resulting in improved treatment 
and prognosis.
