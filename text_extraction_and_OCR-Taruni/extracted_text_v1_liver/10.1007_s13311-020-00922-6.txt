Abstract
Myoclonus can cause significant disability for patients. Myoclonus has a strikingly diverse array of underlying etiologies, clinical
presentations, and pathophysiological mechanisms. Treatment of myoclonus is vital to improving the quality of life of patients
with these disorders. The optimal treatment strategy for myoclonus is best determined based upon careful evaluation and
consideration of the underlying etiology and neurophysiological classification. Electrophysiological testing including EEG
(electroencephalogram) and EMG (electromyogram) data is helpful in determining the neurophysiological classification of
myoclonus. The neurophysiological subtypes of myoclonus include cortical, cortical–subcortical, subcortical–nonsegmental,
segmental, and peripheral. Levetiracetam, valproic acid, and clonazepam are often used to treat cortical myoclonus. In
cortical–subcortical myoclonus, treatment of myoclonic seizures is prioritized, valproic acid being the mainstay of therapy.
Subcortical–nonsegmental myoclonus may be treated with clonazepam, though numerous agents have been used depending
on the etiology. Segmental and peripheral myoclonus are often resistant to treatment, but anticonvulsants and botulinum toxin
injections may be of utility depending upon the case. Pharmacological treatments are often hampered by scarce evidence-based
knowledge, adverse effects, and variable efficacy of medications.

Introduction
Myoclonus is defined as sudden, brief, lightning-like involuntary muscle jerks arising from the nervous system. Myoclonus
may result from abrupt abnormal muscle activation or inhibition of muscle activation (negative myoclonus) [1].
Myoclonus can occur at rest, in response to stimulation, upon
muscle activation, or any combination thereof. Such
intrusions into normal movement disrupt activities of daily
living, causing significant disability [2].
Myoclonus may occur in generalized, focal, multifocal, or
segmental distributions. More than one distribution could be
seen in the same patient or disease process. Identification of
myoclonus can be challenging as other conditions cause brief
jerking movements that may resemble myoclonus clinically.
Such conditions could include dystonia, chorea, ballism, motor tics, and functional jerks [3]. Further, myoclonus may be
subtle and can occur in repetitive fashion causing it to resemble other hyperkinetic movements such as tremor. It is critically important to correctly identify myoclonus as well as to
avoid misidentification of myoclonus to ensure proper
treatment.
There are many systems of classifying myoclonus including by etiology, examination findings, anatomical localization, and neurophysiological characteristics. This review will
focus on using physiology-based classification to guide the
treatment of myoclonus. The neurophysiological classification employed here is comprehensive and is designed to place
similar physiology within the same category, allowing a uniform treatment approach of cases with the given electrophysiological characteristics. This approach to classification also

presents the advantage of providing insights into the localization, underlying disease process, and responsiveness to certain
treatments [4]. Understanding the underlying etiology of myoclonus also plays an important role in guiding treatment in
tandem with electrophysiological data.
Regardless of the classification system that is being used,
determining the optimal treatment of myoclonus is guided by
the diagnostic work up and this begins with the clinical history
and physical examination. Thorough diagnostic testing extends the history and physical examination to identify the
etiology. This may include imaging of the brain and spinal
cord as well as laboratory studies to assess for toxic, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, paraneoplastic, degenerative, or
genetic causes. An important goal of the clinical evaluation
and classification of myoclonus is to identify whether a reversible cause exists. Electrophysiological testing is a valuable
component of diagnostic testing, seeking both to confirm the
presence of myoclonus and to determine the neurophysiological classification. Depending upon the clinical situation, the
presence and etiology of myoclonus may be established at
different junctures during the clinical evaluation. The neurophysiological classification can assist in determining the etiology of myoclonus in such cases in which an etiology is not
apparent following initial diagnostic work up [5]. This diagnostic approach and resulting treatment strategy are summarized in Fig. 1.
Pathophysiologic and Etiologic Classification
of Myoclonus
There are numerous causes of myoclonus in terms of disease
processes and pathophysiological mechanisms. Different etiologies may have a known favorable or unfavorable response
to certain treatments. Additionally, knowledge of other potential comorbid features can influence treatment choice.
There are a number of different schemes used to classify
the etiology of myoclonus. The most basic distinction involves determining “primary” myoclonus versus “secondary”
or symptomatic myoclonus. Considering the immense variability in what could be considered a “primary” myoclonus,
further distinctions may be helpful. Marsden et al. [1] proposed categories of physiologic, essential, and epileptic myoclonus in addition to symptomatic or secondary myoclonus.
A modified version of this classification scheme is shown in
Table 1. Physiologic myoclonus includes myoclonus that can
occur in healthy humans. Examples can include hypnic jerks,
fragmentary myoclonus, and startle responses. The frequency
and intensity of physiologic myoclonus shows considerable
variation among individuals. In the vast majority of cases,
physiologic myoclonus does not require treatment.
Identification of the normal nature of the phenomenon and
reassurance of the patient may be all that is needed.
Physiological forms of myoclonus can, however, become exaggerated or excessive and if significantly bothersome or debilitating, treatment could be warranted [6].
The category of essential myoclonus encompasses disorders of relatively isolated myoclonus that are minimally or
nonprogressive and may cause varying degrees of functional
disability. Included within this category are myoclonus–
dystonia syndromes. Often genetically based, these disorders
may be hereditary or sporadic. Mutations of the epsilon sarcoglycan gene (SGCE) are often implicated and display autosomal dominant inheritance [7]. The category of epileptic myoclonus includes seizure disorders with seizure semiology
consisting of myoclonus. Myoclonus may occur as one of
many components of seizure semiology, the sole manifestation of seizure, or may occur as one of multiple seizure types
within an epilepsy syndrome. Symptomatic or secondary myoclonus encompasses a broad and most common category of
myoclonus due to a variety of toxic, metabolic, infectious,
inflammatory, degenerative, and structural causes [1].
Neurophysiological Classification
of Myoclonus
Electrophysiological testing techniques that are useful in determining the neurophysiological classification of myoclonus
include electroencephalogram (EEG) and multi-channel surface electromyogram (EMG), which are of most value when
recorded concurrently. Even in situations in which access to
EEG–EMG polygraphy may be limited, the recording of surface EMG can still be valuable. In addition to distinguishing
myoclonus from other movement disorders, the electrophysiological characteristics of myoclonus discharges on surface
EMG can provide important data as to the physiological classification. Myoclonus discharges recorded via EEG–EMG
polygraphy can be analyzed using EEG–EMG back-averaging. Stimulus-induced EMG reflexes, corticomuscular coherence, and somatosensory evoked potentials are adjunctive
studies that may assist in classifying myoclonus, particularly
when a cortical origin is suspected [4, 8, 9].
Based upon the electrophysiological findings profile, myoclonus may be divided into the following categories: cortical,
cortical–subcortical, subcortical–nonsegmental, segmental,
and peripheral. Although not part of this classification
scheme, functional or psychogenic jerks are an entity that
may closely resemble myoclonus. Electrophysiological testing may give supportive evidence. The neurophysiological
mechanisms, hence electrophysiological results of myoclonus, may vary across different etiologies of myoclonus. It is
possible for more than one subtype of myoclonus to be present
across one disease state and in the same individual [3, 4].
These nuances underscore the importance of properly classifying myoclonus by neurophysiology. The specific

electrophysiological characteristics used to determine neurophysiological classification will be discussed separately for
each myoclonus subtype.
Zutt et al. [5] studied the clinical utility of electrophysiological testing in classifying myoclonus according to anatomical localization. It was found that clinically suspected

myoclonus was confirmed in 91% of cases. However, the
subtype of myoclonus suspected prior to testing was often
either changed or clarified by electrophysiological testing in
over half of the cases. It was further demonstrated that an
underlying etiology of myoclonus was subsequently determined in 53% of the patients in whom myoclonus was confirmed. Given that optimal treatment of myoclonus is heavily
dependent upon properly diagnosing and classifying myoclonus, it follows that electrophysiological testing may aid in
optimizing treatment of myoclonus.
General Treatment Strategy
When approaching treatment of myoclonus, the first consideration is whether a reversible or treatable cause exists.
Examples include excising a spinal tumor causing
propriospinal myoclonus, correcting a metabolic derangement, and withdrawing the offending drug, among others.
This article is devoted to mostly symptomatic treatment.
However, progress in defining new myoclonus etiologies is
being made, which may in turn lead to advances in treatment.
For example, the discovery of inflammatory syndromes that
manifest myoclonus may provide an immune-based treatment
approach for the myoclonus in some instances [10]. In many
cases, treatment of the underlying cause of myoclonus is either
not possible or provides insufficient relief of symptoms. In
situations in which debilitating symptoms remain, symptomatic treatment is undertaken. For the rest of the article, “treatment” will refer to symptomatic treatment of myoclonus.
Due to the diverse etiologies and characteristics of myoclonus, the treatment of myoclonus is often challenging,
and disability may remain after optimal symptomatic treatment occurs. Effective treatments across and even within
different subtypes and etiologies may vary tremendously.
Data are limited, especially with respect to double-blinded
randomized controlled trials, and “off-label” treatments are
often used. Polytherapy is often required for optimal symptom control. For these reasons, it is not possible to determine a precise algorithm for treating myoclonus. An individualized approach is often needed. Understanding comorbid features of the underlying disorder may assist in

selecting an optimal treatment strategy. For example, selection of an agent known to treat seizures would be a reasonable choice for treating myoclonus that occurs in the setting
of a seizure disorder. As will be outlined below in detail,
different neurophysiological subtypes of myoclonus display differing responses to various treatments and therefore
understanding the neurophysiological mechanism is crucial
to determining the optimal treatment.

1670 Pena and Caviness

Cortical Myoclonus
Electrophysiological Testing Features
Cortical myoclonus is electrophysiologically characterized by
brief surface EMG discharges typically less than 50 ms
(Fig. 2). A pattern of agonist–antagonist cocontraction is often
seen (Fig. 3). The distribution is often multifocal, though focal, segmental, and generalized distribution of myoclonus discharges can be seen. These discharges are often arrhythmic
and may occur at rest, with stimulation, and/or with action.
Cortical origin myoclonus is defined by a time-locked EEG
cortical transient. This can be identified over the contralateral
sensorimotor cortex. The latency between the EEG discharge
and corresponding surface EMG discharge is between 6 and
22 ms when recorded from the upper extremity. Although
such cortical transients are at times identified upon gross inspection of the EEG, back-averaging of EEG–EMG
polygraphy is more reliably able to identify a corresponding
cortical discharge (Fig. 4). When identifying myoclonus EMG
discharges to include in back-averaging, it is recommended to
have a motion sensor to assist with “jerk” confirmation [4].
Cortical origin myoclonus may also be induced by a stimulus such as muscle stretch or sensory stimuli, so termed reflex
myoclonus. This results from hyperexcitability of the
sensorimotor integration. This stimulus sensitivity can be
reflected electrophysiologically by finding enlarged cortical
somatosensory evoked potentials, so termed “giant” SEPs.
Single electrical stimulation of the median and/or tibial nerve
can elicit myoclonus EMG discharges, serving as another
means of demonstrating stimulus sensitivity. These enhanced
long latency EMG reflexes, also termed C-reflexes at rest, can
be recorded 40 to 60 ms following median nerve stimulation.
The above findings demonstrating exaggerated cortical reflex
phenomena can serve as supportive evidence of a cortical
physiology of myoclonus [4, 8, 9].
There is considerable overlap between the physiological
mechanisms of cortical myoclonus and focal motor seizures,
both with presumed underlying hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex. The specific locations and mechanisms of
dysfunction within the pathways of the sensorimotor cortex
remain unknown. It has been proposed that cortical myoclonus may exist as part of a spectrum including epilepsia
partialis continua and focal motor seizures [12]. Cortical myoclonus has also been proposed to represent a fragment of
focal epilepsy [13]). Focal motor seizures typically consist
of paroxysmal repetitive focal surface EMG discharges of less
than 100 ms that are confined to a focal distribution and demonstrate corresponding cortical transients that are either grossly visible on EEG or identified using EEG–EMG backFig. 4 Following EEG–EMG
back-averaging, an averaged

averaging (Fig. 4). Typically myoclonus associated with focal
motor seizures will occur in paroxysms, but when occurring
continuously at intervals no longer than every 10 s for periods
of hours or longer, this is termed epilepsia partialis continua
[13, 15].
Treatment
Cortical myoclonus is often responsive to anti-epileptic treatment because these medications address the abnormal intrinsic cortical hyperexcitability that gives rise to cortical
myoclonus.
Valproic acid has been found to be beneficial in cortical
myoclonus. Valproic acid acts through multiple mechanisms,
including increased synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) in the nerve terminals and decreased degradation of
GABA at the level of the synapse. Valproic acid also has some
ability to decrease excitation by glutamate and alter ionic conductance [16]. Many patients need doses of 1200 to 2000 mg/
day for myoclonus treatment [17]. The response of
posthypoxic action myoclonus to valproic acid was reported
in 1978 [18]. A series of eight Huntington disease patients
with predominantly myoclonic movements showed a dosedependent reduction in functional disability [19]. Valproic
acid is often regarded as a first-line therapy in progressive
myoclonic epilepsies [20].
Piracetam and related compounds including levetiracetam
and brivaracetam have demonstrated efficacy in treating cortical myoclonus. These related compounds are believed to
exert anti-myoclonic effect by binding to the synaptic vesicle
protein 2A (SV2A), though the precise mechanism is unknown. Piracetam was shown to be superior to placebo for
treating myoclonus in a double-blinded, randomized, and controlled trial of 21 patients with cortical myoclonus [21]. In an
observational study of 40 patients with myoclonus of various
etiologies, 16 improved clinically with the addition of piracetam, all of whom had cortical myoclonus. A double-blinded
randomized crossover study of 20 patients with progressive
myoclonic epilepsies demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy
of piracetam [22]. An open-label clinical trial of 60 patients
with myoclonus of different etiologies demonstrated effectiveness for treating myoclonus, particularly that of a cortical origin, both as monotherapy and polytherapy [23]. A wide variety of effective doses have been reported ranging from 2.4 to
24 g/day, emphasizing the importance of dosage titration.
Possible side effects include gastrointestinal disturbance and
hematologic abnormalities. Due to the high doses often required, the number and size of pills may limit medication
adherence [24].
Levetiracetam, a related compound to piracetam, also acts
on the SV2A receptor. Levetiracetam may exert anti-epileptic
and anti-myoclonus effects through modulating calcium channels. Levetiracetam is widely used to treat seizure disorders
and is generally well tolerated with few drug interactions,
making this an attractive option for treating myoclonus. An
open-label trial of 14 patients with electrophysiologically defined cortical myoclonus demonstrated evidence of clinical
and electrophysiological improvement with levetiracetam
polytherapy [25]. An open-label trial of 13 patients with myoclonic epilepsy demonstrated clinical improvement in 8 of the
13 patients when treated with levetiracetam [26].
Levetiracetam was reported to be of benefit in combination
with clonazepam for treatment of myoclonic seizures in 17
patients with myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers disease [27]. There have been reports of levetiracetam improving
cortical myoclonus in patients with corticobasal degeneration
and spinocerebellar ataxia [28–30]. Typical doses range from
1000 to 3000 mg daily. Brivaracetam is a derivative of levetiracetam, also acting on the SVA2 receptor with higher affinity compared with levetiracetam. Modulation of NMDA receptors and sodium currents may represent additional mechanisms of action. Brivaracetam has been FDA approved in
recent years for the treatment of focal epilepsy. Brivaracetam
has shown promise for treating posthypoxic cortical myoclonus in rodent models, though data in humans is lacking [31].
Brivaracetam has demonstrated efficacy for treating myoclonus in Unverricht–Lundborg disease and may also have fewer
adverse effects than levitiracetam [32].
The possible mechanism of action in the case of clonazepam
is facilitation of GABAergic transmission by affecting the benzodiazepine receptor and a decrease in 5-hydroxytryptophan utilization in the brain [33]. Clonazepam was reported as effective
in treating myoclonus in a small series of three posthypoxic
patients and two patients with presumed neurodegenerative disease [34]. The longer duration of action of clonazepam offers an
advantage compared with some other benzodiazepine preparations. Relatively high doses of 7 to 18 mg daily have been used
[35]. Clonazepam has been reported to benefit severe action
myoclonus of multiple etiologies and may have some usefulness
in polytherapy [17].
Perampanel is a selective noncompetitive α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid that the FDA approved in 2012 and currently used for treatment of focal and
generalized epilepsy. A 2019 study suggested efficacy of lowdose perampanel in the treatment of cortical myoclonus in 18
patients with seizures and cortical myoclonus of varying etiologies. The mean dosage was 3.2 ± 2.1 mg/day. In addition to
improvement myoclonus scales and measures of activities of
daily living, treatment with perampanel resulted in increased
latency and reduced amplitude of giant SEPs, suggesting that
perampanel may reduce cortical hyperexcitability and
hypersynchronization [3, 36]. There are multiple additional
case reports of perampanel at dosages ranging from 4 to
10 mg improving cortical myoclonus of varying etiologies
including myoclonic epilepsy, postsurgical, and posthypoxic
myoclonus [36–40].
1672 Pena and Caviness

Other pharmacological treatments for cortical myoclonus
have included other various anti-epileptic medications. The
precise anti-myoclonus mechanism of these agents is unknown, but this likely relates to the suppression of excessive
neuronal firing within the neuronal circuits that generate the
cortical myoclonus. Some reports have documented the usefulness of lacosamide and agomelatine in treating posthypoxic
myoclonus [41–43]. Zonisamide has demonstrated effectiveness as adjunctive therapy for treating myoclonus in patients
with Unverricht–Lundborg disease and Lafora body disease
[44, 45]. Progressive myoclonic epilepsies in particular often
require polytherapy [13]. Sodium oxybate has demonstrated
efficacy for the treatment of alcohol-responsive myoclonus in
a rater blinded trial including patients with posthypoxic myoclonus and progressive myoclonic epilepsy [46]. Primidone
and phenobarbital have also been used as adjunctive therapy
in treating cortical action myoclonus [17]. Anti-epileptic medications that are not typically useful in treating cortical myoclonus include carbamazepine and phenytoin, which may in
fact worsen myoclonus. The utility of these medications in
treating myoclonus may be restricted to that which is associated with focal motor seizures [3].
Deep brain stimulation surgery has been performed in refractory cases of posthypoxic myoclonus with two cases demonstrating significant improvement in myoclonus severity
scales after bilateral globus pallidus interna implantation [47,
48]. One case reports significant improvement in posthypoxic
myoclonus due to perinatal anoxic injury following deep brain
stimulation of the bilateral ventral intermediate nucleus
[49].There have also been reports of deep brain stimulation
showing efficacy in progressive myoclonic epilepsy.
Targeting of the subthalamic nucleus has shown reduction in
the frequency of myoclonic seizures. Implantation of the border zone between the subthalamic nucleus and substantia
nigra pars reticularis has produced a beneficial effect upon
cortical myoclonus [50–52]. A single case report demonstrated improvement of myoclonus with stimulation of the
substantia nigra pars reticularis over a follow-up period of
24 months [53]. Although some positive results have been
attained for deep brain stimulation in cases of cortical myoclonus, more study is needed before a consistent recommendation can be made.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used to
study the balance between intracortical inhibition and excitation of motor pathways as well as the sensorimotor neuronal
plasticity in different forms of myoclonus including progressive myoclonic epilepsy, myoclonus dystonia syndrome, and
symptomatic myoclonus. TMS may also present potential for
providing symptomatic treatment of myoclonus by restoring
abnormal intracortical inhibition. It is thought that repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation delivered at a low frequency
(< 5 Hz) may enhance cortical inhibition [54]. A 2018 series
of 9 patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy underwent
low-frequency repetitive TMS. One patient discontinued treatment due to worsening of myoclonus. The 8 patients who
completed the protocol demonstrated a 25% improvement in
myoclonus severity scales [55]. A series of 7 patients with
epilepsia partialis continua of varying etiology were treated
with low-frequency repetitive TMS with or without highfrequency repetitive TMS over the primary motor cortex.
There was sustained benefit of greater than 1 day in 2 patients,
no response in 2 patients, and the remaining 3 patients had
benefit lasting 20 to 30 min [56]. A single case reported a
longer duration benefit of 2 months following treatment with
low-frequency repetitive TMS over the primary motor cortex
for epilepsia partialis continua due to a cortical dysplasia [57].
In a case of childhood-onset cortical myoclonus manifesting
clinically as tremor, clinical and electrophysiological improvement was reported with low-frequency repetitive TMS
over the premotor cortex [58]. Transcranial magnetic stimulation may present a noninvasive and nonpharmacological
method of treating cortical myoclonus, but further study is
needed to address long-term efficacy.
Cortical–Subcortical Myoclonus
Etiology and Electrophysiological Testing Profile
Cortical–subcortical myoclonus most commonly arises in generalized epilepsy syndromes. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy
(JME) is the most common generalized epilepsy syndrome in
which cortical–subcortical myoclonus is seen. It is important to
note that all myoclonic epilepsies are not of cortical–subcortical
myoclonus physiology. Progressive myoclonic epilepsies for
example show cortical localization and physiology as discussed
above. The seizures seen in generalized epilepsy syndromes
arise from abnormal oscillations in bidirectional connections
between cortical and subcortical structures that occur on a paroxysmal basis giving rise to generalized/bilateral myoclonus.
Anterior thalamocortical circuitry has been implicated specifically in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and in generalized absence
seizures [59, 60]. Cortical–subcortical myoclonus usually occurs in paroxysms from rest and may occur in isolation or may
clinically manifest as generalized seizures with a myoclonic
component. The area of involvement of a single cortical–
subcortical myoclonus discharge is much more diffuse and bilateral when compared with cortical myoclonus, owing to the
bidirectional cortical and subcortical neuronal excitation that
takes place. This excitatory discharge produces myoclonus
when the discharge spreads to the primary motor cortices. For
this reason, the clinical myoclonus seen in association with
cortical–subcortical physiology is often bilateral and synchronous. Other symptoms such as loss of awareness may occur in
conjunction with myoclonus when these excitatory discharges
Physiology-Based Treatment of Myoclonus 1673

spread beyond the motor cortices to affect other structures
[2–4].
Electrophysiologically, the prototypical corresponding
findings are spike and/or polyspike activity with an
aftercoming slow wave demonstrated on scalp EEG. Surface
EMG myoclonus discharges are typically brief, often 50 to
100 ms, similar in duration to cortical myoclonus but potentially slightly longer. These surface EMG discharges occur in
time-locked to fashion to a spike or polyspike and wave discharge on EEG. Enlarged cortical somatosensory evoked potentials have been reported in association with cortical–
subcortical myoclonus, but are not consistently seen [4, 45].
Although there is evidence of cortical irritability in cortical–
subcortical myoclonus, the differing clinical phenomenology
and electrophysiological findings support a different pathological mechanism from purely cortical myoclonus. These
important differences underscore the importance of treating
these varieties of myoclonus with the electrophysiological
mechanism in mind.
Treatment
Treatment most often consists of anti-epileptic medication
with a primary goal of alleviating seizures. There are
syndrome-specific treatment guidelines and algorithms that
are often used in generalized epilepsy syndrome. Compared
with the treatment of cortical myoclonus, there is some overlap, but a distinct profile of therapeutic efficacy is seen, largely
owing to the differing neurophysiological generators.
Evidence is limited with respect to the effect of anti-epileptic
medications on myoclonus in these epilepsy syndromes.
Valproic acid has been used as a first-line therapy for juvenile
myoclonic epilepsy due to efficacy in terms of controlling
seizures. The therapeutic effect of valproic acid in cortical–
subcortical myoclonus may relate to the modulation of sodium
and calcium ionic conductance. Lamotrigine has also been
used to treat juvenile myoclonic epilepsy with differing results
as to how this compares with valproic acid treatment. Initial
data suggested superiority of valproic acid; however, subsequent studies have suggested slight superiority of lamotrigine.
Notably, there were fewer adverse effects and events with use
of lamotrigine as compared with valproic acid [61, 62]. There
have also been rare reports of worsening myoclonus in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy treated with lamotrigine [63].
Levetiracetam and topiramate have also been reported to
show efficacy in treating myoclonic seizures in JME [64]. The
treatment of childhood absence epilepsy is typically aimed at
controlling absence seizures. Ethosuximide and valproic acid
are commonly used as a first-line treatment in childhood absence epilepsy. Double-blinded randomized controlled trial
data have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of valproic acid
and ethosuximide in treating childhood absence epilepsy with
fewer adverse effects reported with ethosuximide. Data in
myoclonic variants of childhood absence epilepsy are more
limited, but suggest efficacy of valproic acid as well as
valproic acid and ethosuximide cotherapy. Lamotrigine has
been explored as a treatment of myoclonic absences, suggesting potential efficacy, but with very limited data [65, 66].
Intravenous valproic acid and levetiracetam may be useful in
treating myoclonic status epilepticus [67]. Limited data exists
showing efficacy of deep brain stimulation of the
centromedian thalamic nucleus in treating treatment refractory
generalized epilepsy; however, deep brain stimulation has not
been studied specifically with respect to treatment of cortical–
subcortical myoclonus [68].
Subcortical–Nonsegmental Myoclonus
Subcortical–nonsegmental myoclonus is a more heterogeneous entity in terms of physiological mechanisms and electrophysiological testing characteristics as compared with cortical myoclonus. There are numerous different subcortical locations from which myoclonus may arise yielding a wide variety of neuronal circuits through which myoclonic discharges
may be transmit to descending motor pathways. On electrophysiological testing, the discharges of this myoclonus are
often longer in duration compared with cortical myoclonus,
as long as 200 ms, though this is not invariably the case.
Varying patterns of muscle activation may be observed, including recruitment in a simultaneous rostral–caudal distribution, a purely descending caudal distribution, or in a multifocal distribution. Findings of cortical myoclonus such as EEG
sharp waves, enlarged somatosensory evoked potentials, and
enhanced long latency reflexes are not seen in subcortical
myoclonus due to the lack of a cortical generator of the myoclonus [69]. Although it is important to note that these features are not seen, subcortical myoclonus should not be identified solely based upon the absence of these cortical features,
as the number of technical and physiological factors may influence the recording of these features. Owing to the heterogeneity of mechanisms underlying subcortical myoclonus, a
wide variety of treatments have been found to demonstrate
partial efficacy. Anti-seizure medications used in cortical myoclonus such as valproic acid and levetiracetam are typically
of limited utility in treating subcortical myoclonus [3].
Myoclonus–Dystonia Syndrome
A frequently cited example of subcortical–nonsegmental myoclonus includes myoclonus-dystonia syndrome, in which
varying amounts of the myoclonus occur with or without dystonia. This is also termed hereditary essential myoclonus. One
striking feature that has been seen in these disorders is a robust
response to ethanol. Abnormal basal ganglia and cerebellothalamic circuits through a genetic mechanism are believed
1674 Pena and Caviness

underlie myoclonus–dystonia syndrome. The presence of
GABAergic pathways within the basal ganglia may explain
in part the therapeutic response to ethanol. A randomized
double-blinded crossover trial of 23 patients with a
myoclonus–dystonia syndrome demonstrated efficacy of
zonisamide in treating myoclonus [70]. Clonazepam is anecdotally reported to have some efficacy in myoclonus dystonia
syndromes, though clinical trial data is lacking. A single case
report of alcohol-responsive myoclonus to gammahydroxybutyric acid has been reported [71]. Sodium oxybate,
which is a sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, has
been found to be effective in a single-blinded clinical trial,
which included 3 patients with myoclonus–dystonia syndromes [46]. As previously described above in discussion of
sodium oxybate use for cortical forms of myoclonus, this
medication can have serious side effects including respiratory
suppression and therefore should be approached cautiously.
The lack of a robust response of GABA modulating medications matching that of ethanol suggests involvement of additional neurochemical pathways. Disruptions in serotonergic,
dopaminergic, and cholinergic pathways may also play a role
and present potential therapeutic mechanisms. Tetrabenazine
was reported to effectively treat myoclonus in two patients
with a myoclonus–dystonia syndrome [72].
Deep brain stimulation has been reported as effective for
treatment of myoclonus dystonia syndromes using a globus
pallidus interna (Gpi) [73] or Vim thalamus target [74]. A
systematic review identifying 40 cases of myoclonus dystonia
syndrome treated with deep brain stimulation concluded that
93.5% of patients had a response of 50% or greater on myoclonus severity scales with a mean improvement of 72.6% over
a mean follow-up period of 27/2 months. The improvement
was similar for both Gpi and Vim in terms of myoclonus, but
dystonia improved more with the Gpi target and fewer adverse
events were reported [75]. Included in the above review is a
case series of 10 patients with myoclonus dystonia who
underwent bilateral Gpi and Vim deep brain stimulation.
This showed improvement in myoclonus severity for both
targets when stimulated separately, but more adverse effects
were seen with Vim stimulation. In 6 patients, there was
slightly better efficacy with stimulation of both the Gpi and
Vim concurrently. Although larger scale studies are needed to
validate these results, Gpi deep brain stimulation appears
promising for treatment of myoclonus dystonia syndrome
and a Vim target may provide an additional option for patients
who may be refractory to Vim stimulation [76].
Opsoclonus–Myoclonus Syndrome
Opsoclonus–myoclonus syndrome is an example of
subcortical–nonsegmental myoclonus believed to arise from
brainstem pathways. Although classically attributed to a
paraneoplastic syndrome related to pediatric neuroblastoma,
a variety of inflammatory, infectious, and structural causes
can underlie this syndrome, especially in adults. In the case
of a paraneoplastic etiology, identifying and addressing the
associated malignancy becomes the priority. Inflammatory
or autoimmune causes as expected may be addressed using
immunotherapy. Aside from treating the underlying cause,
clonazepam has been reported as effective in some cases of
opsoclonus–myoclonus syndrome. Other agents reported as
effective in case reports include valproic acid, piracetam,
topiramate, and reserpine [3, 77–79].
Reticular Reflex Myoclonus
Reticular reflex myoclonus is a rare entity that has been reported in the setting of uremia and recovery from hypoxia.
Myoclonus occurs in a generalized distribution, predominantly in the proximal upper extremity and truncal muscles and
may be induced by muscle activation or startle. There may or
may not be accompanying generalized discharges seen on
EEG. The relationship to seizure is therefore uncertain. The
surface EMG may demonstrate sequential activation of muscles innervated by brainstem nuclei. Typical findings of cortical myoclonus such as a focal cortical sharp wave and enlarged somatosensory evoked potentials are not seen.
Intravenous clonazepam and 5-hydroxytryptophan have previously been reported as effective in case reports, though neither is commonly used presently. Reticular reflex myoclonus
in the setting of hypoxia or uremia is often reversible with
correction of the underlying metabolic derangement [79, 80].
Propriospinal Myoclonus
Propriospinal myoclonus is a form of nonsegmental myoclonus resulting in jerking of truncal muscles from a spinal cord
generator. The electrophysiological signature of propriospinal
myoclonus is surface EMG discharges arising from a particular level of the spinal cord with concurrent, contiguous activation of rostral and caudal muscle groups. This may involve
the upper and/or lower extremity muscles. The pattern of activation is typically bilateral and symmetric. The duration of
surface EMG discharges may be variable in length and may be
longer than in cortical or cortical–subcortical myoclonus, possibly lasting in excess of 300 ms. Propriospinal myoclonus is
often refractory to pharmacological treatment. Clonazepam
has been the most consistently reported to be effective.
Zonisamide has been reported as effective, albeit in a minority
of cases. A variety of other pharmacological treatments have
been reported as mildly effective in isolated cases including
piracetam, levetiracetam, valproic acid, oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, and baclofen. Propriospinal myoclonus can be
caused by irritative or compressive lesions affecting the spinal
cord. There are reports of alleviation of propriospinal myoclonus following surgical removal of a causative structural
Physiology-Based Treatment of Myoclonus 1675

lesion. Assessment for such a structural lesion with spinal cord
imaging is therefore important in proposing appropriate treatment [79, 81, 82].
It is essential to maintain awareness that functional jerks
may closely resemble propriospinal myoclonus both in terms
of clinical and electrophysiological characteristics. Studies
have shown that the expected electrophysiological pattern expected in propriospinal myoclonus can be seen in the setting
of functional truncal jerks and can also be effectively mimicked by healthy volunteers [83–85]. The optimal treatment of
functional jerks differs from that of propriospinal myoclonus
(see the section on functional myoclonus below).
Segmental Myoclonus
Electrophysiological Testing Profile
Segmental myoclonus presents with distinct neurophysiological features from subcortical–nonsegmental myoclonus.
Segmental myoclonus arises from a generator at a particular
segment or contiguous segments usually of the brainstem or
spinal cord. The surface EMG therefore shows synchronous
activation of muscles innervated by involved segments of the
nervous system. Spinal segmental myoclonus is distinguished
from other forms of myoclonus by the involvement of muscles
corresponding to 1 to 3 contiguous spinal levels. Segmental
myoclonus in contrast to peripheral myoclonus may also occur bilaterally. The duration of surface EMG discharges may
vary considerably, lasting anywhere from 50 ms up to as long
as 500 ms. The myoclonus discharges are often rhythmic with
frequencies varying from 0.2 to 8 Hz. Segmental myoclonus is
typically persistent and unaffected by state of consciousness,
motor activity, or sensory stimuli. The EEG and somatosensory evoked potentials are generally normal. However,
brainstem auditory evoked potentials have been reported to
be abnormal in some cases of palatal myoclonus. Peripheral
nerve stimulation in spinal segmental myoclonus has been
reported evoke EMG discharges in affected muscles at latencies in excess of 40 ms [4, 86, 87].
Palatal Myoclonus
The most common example of segmental myoclonus is palatal
myoclonus. Palatal myoclonus may be symptomatic, arising
as a result of lesions of the dentato-rubro-olivary pathway
(also termed Guillain Mollaret triangle or myoclonic triangle),
in which case other symptoms or findings localizable to the
brainstem or cerebellum may be seen. Essential or idiopathic
palatal myoclonus may also occur, in which case the palatal
myoclonus may be an isolated finding. Symptoms of bothersome clicking in the ear may be reported. Palatal myoclonus is
often resistant to treatment and there is no agent that has
shown consistent benefit. There are reports of numerous different medications showing efficacy in small numbers of
cases. Medications reported as beneficial include clonazepam,
baclofen [86], sumatriptan [88], lamotrigine [89],
trihexyphenidyl, carbamazepine, and piracetam [90].
Botulinum toxin injections have also shown promise in alleviating palatal myoclonus [91–93]. A 2014 case series of patients with palatal myoclonus who underwent botulinum toxin
injections documents improvement in symptom of 12 of 14
patients. A previous 2005 review demonstrated similar findings with 4 of 5 patients showing symptomatic improvement
after botulinum toxin injections [93, 94]. Surgical intervention
such as tensor veli palatini tenotomy and occlusion of the
Eustachian tube have been used to treat severe, disabling ear
clicking resulting from treatment refractory palatal myoclonus
[95]. It is important to consider the possibility of a functional
disorder, as there have been reported cases of functional palatal tremor reported [96–98].
Spinal Segmental Myoclonus
Numerous etiologies may cause segmental myoclonus including structural lesions (vascular, neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, etc.) as well as idiopathic causes [4, 11]. The pathophysiological generator is believed to be a loss of inhibition of
spinal interneurons leading to hyperexcitability of anterior
horn cells within the affected segment [87]. Spinal segmental
myoclonus, similar to palatal myoclonus, often proves refractory to medical therapy and thus a wide variety of medications
have been reported as useful in small numbers of cases. The
most consistently useful medication has been clonazepam,
others including tetrabenazine, trihexyphenidyl, baclofen, carbamazepine, piracetam, and levetiracetam [99, 100]. Given
the localized distribution of spinal segmental myoclonus, botulinum toxin injections may be beneficial both in terms of
treating involuntary movement and associated discomfort.
There are case reports of botulinum toxin injections successfully treating spinal segmental myoclonus affecting the neck,
shoulder, and lower extremity [101–103]. Spinal segmental
myoclonus may be due to a variety of causes, some of which
are attributable to infectious or inflammatory conditions that
could spontaneously change or resolve over time. Therefore,
care must be taken not to erroneously attribute treatment effect
in such a scenario [3].
Peripheral Myoclonus
Peripheral myoclonus often occurs as localized myoclonic
jerks that arise from a peripheral nervous system generator.
The surface EMG demonstrates discharges of varying length
arising from the same peripheral nerve distribution. Within a
single nerve distribution, multiple muscles may be affected
1676 Pena and Caviness

and these muscles would be expected to show similar electrophysiological firing patterns. The myoclonus may occur intermittently with discharges occurring in a semi-rhythmic or
rhythmic pattern. As expected, the findings associated with
cortical myoclonus such as a cortical transient or enlarged
somatosensory evoked potentials are not seen. Proposed
mechanisms of peripheral myoclonus include direct motor
nerve irritation due to compression or alteration of central
nervous system motor pathways secondary to a peripheral
nerve lesion. The most common example of peripheral myoclonus is hemifacial spasm, which typically occurs in association with vascular compression of unilateral cranial nerve VII.
Peripheral myoclonus is often treatable by botulinum toxin
injections due to the focal distribution of musculature involved. Hemifacial spasm is known to respond well to botulinum toxin injections, demonstrating subjective improvement
of 80% in ~ 80% of patients [104]. Oral medications are best
used as adjunctive therapy for hemifacial spasm, as complete
relief of symptoms is not typical. Carbamazepine has shown
sustained improvement in 35% of patients with complete relief occurring even less often [105]. Gabapentin has also
shown efficacy, with an open-label trial of 23 patients demonstrating at least 70% improvement in 69% of patients [106].
Surgical treatment is a consideration in the presence of a compressive lesion. Favorable results have been seen in up to 90%
of patients who undergo microvascular decompression for
hemifacial spasm, though symptoms may recur following initial success [107, 108].
Functional Jerks
An entity distinct from myoclonus, yet important to recognize
in the differential diagnosis of myoclonus, is that of functional
jerks. Functional movement disorders may closely resemble
myoclonus clinically. However, the more prolonged duration
of functional jerks may be detected visually by the clinician.
Electrophysiological testing can be helpful as supportive evidence in differentiating functional jerks from true myoclonus
with functional movements demonstrating longer duration of
surface EMG discharges, usually greater than 100 ms as well
as marked variability of duration and distribution. A
nonstereotyped pattern of muscle recruitment may also be
seen, though an agonist–antagonist pattern of muscle activation typical of myoclonus can be seen in functional jerks as
well. In stimulus-induced jerks, a response latency of greater
than 100 ms suggests a functional etiology [109].
Importantly, it has been recognized that in some cases,
psychogenic movements may resemble myoclonus even electrophysiologically for those types of myoclonus with longer
EMG discharge duration. This has especially been described
in the case of functional truncal jerks that closely resemble
propriospinal myoclonus. Some cases of palatal myoclonus
have been identified to be functional in etiology [96–98].
The history and physical examination should carefully evaluate for risk factors or other features that may suggest a functional etiology. When diagnosing a functional movement disorder, it is also important to recognize that a functional disorder may co-exist with an organic movement disorder. For this
reason, care must be taken to adequately evaluate for such a
disorder.
Consideration may also be given to performing EEG–
EMG back-averaging for the purpose of identifying a
Bereitschaftspotential [84]. A Bereitschaftspotential is a negative EEG potential reflecting activity of premotor areas that
occurs before a voluntary movement. The early phase of the
Bereitschaftspotential begins 1 to 2 s before a voluntary movement and demonstrates a slowly rising negative polarity that is
widespread in distribution but maximal at the vertex. The late
phase of the Bereitschaftspotential begins at 450 to 650 ms
before a voluntary movement at which point the negative shift
becomes steeper and more lateralized contralateral to the
movement. This may be a useful technique to evaluation of
functional myoclonus; however, the identification of a
Bereitschaftspotential may be technically challenging. For this
reason, the absence of a Bereitschaftspotential should not be
used as evidence to exclude a functional etiology [4, 109].
Event-related desynchronization refers to the reduction of beta
and gamma oscillations that occur prior to either self-paced or
cued voluntary movement, which may reflect attention directed at motor control. This may also serve as a useful electrophysiological marker of functional movements [110].
Once a functional movement disorder has been diagnosed,
the first step in treatment is explaining the functional nature of
symptoms to the patient. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is often needed, which should be individualized to
the patient. Medication treatment is generally not indicated
for functional movement disorders, with the exception of appropriate pharmacological management of psychiatric comorbidities. Successful treatment modalities have included cognitive behavioral therapy, biofeedback, physical therapy, physical activity, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation [111, 112].
Conclusion
Myoclonus of all varieties can cause significant disability.
Treatment of myoclonus is vital to improving the quality of
life of patients with these disorders. Owing to the diverse
etiologies and classifications of myoclonus, a wide array of
potentially effective treatments are reported. Still, the treatment of myoclonus remains challenging in the face of a paucity of large randomized clinical trials, likely owing in large
part to the rarity of these diverse etiologies of myoclonus.
Pharmacological treatments are often hampered by side
Physiology-Based Treatment of Myoclonus 1677

effects, variable efficacy, and a lack of evidence-based guidelines. Neuromodulation appears promising in select cases, but
requires additional study. Determining the etiology of myoclonus as well as the neurophysiological classification are important steps in guiding selection of the optimal treatment
regimen. Electrophysiological testing is of great value in this
regard. Further study of the role of neurophysiological testing
in guiding clinical management of myoclonus would be beneficial in understanding the optimal approach to treatment.
