Abstract. Performing cardiothoracic surgery on patients 
with advanced liver failure and liver cirrhosis is high-risk for 
patients. Coronary artery bypass grafting is the most effective 
treatment for patients with liver failure that is complicated 
with severe coronary heart disease, and who cannot be treated 
using coronary stent intervention. In the current study, one 
case of coronary artery bypass grafting combined with liver 
transplantation was assessed, with the patient exhibiting 
advanced alcoholic liver cirrhosis. A coronary artery bypass 
graft was performed to relieve angina pectoris. Following 
surgery, wound exudation, secondary infection, liver failure, 
pleuroperitoneal fluid leakage, hypoproteinemia and other 
adverse treatment results occurred, and the chest wound did 
not heal. Allograft liver transplantation was subsequently 
performed and, following surgery, the chest wound healed 
gradually after debridement, and the patient recovered.
Introduction
Alcohol consumption accounts for 3.8% of global mortality 
and 4.6% of disability-adjusted life-years lost due to 
premature death (1). Among the various harmful effects of 
alcohol, alcoholic liver disease induces a wide spectrum 
of liver abnormalities, including simple steatosis, alcoholic 
hepatitis/steatohepatitis, progressive fibrosis and ultimately 
alcoholic cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (2).
The latest worldwide survey of coronary revascularization 
shows that 583,000 coronary-artery bypass operations were 
performed in 1995 (3). According to European statistics, the 
annual rate of use of balloon angioplasty is approximately 
739 procedures per million population (4). Approximately 
60 percent of patients treated with balloon angioplasty or 
bypass surgery have multivessel disease that could be treated 
by either procedure. Coronary artery bypass grafting is the 
most effective treatment for patients with liver failure that 
is complicated with severe coronary heart disease, and who 
cannot be treated using coronary stent intervention (5). 
However, coronary artery bypass grafting is contraindicated 
for patients with liver failure. Recently, a case of severe coronary heart disease with liver failure was successfully treated.
Case report
A 62-year old man was admitted to the Tianjin First Central 
hospital following 4 years of xanthochromia and 4 years of 
liver cirrhosis. The patient was admitted to the Department 
of Liver Transplantation in September 2017 with alcoholic 
liver cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. A period of 5 years 
previously, the patient had exhibited skin and scleral xanthochromia with no obvious cause. This was accompanied by 
anorexia, nausea and intermittent fever, although the patient 
exhibited no signs of abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematemesis, 
unconsciousness or other symptoms, and no specific treatment 
was provided.
A period of 4years previously (January2014-December2018), 
the patient had been hospitalized in the Tianjin First Central 
Hospital for anorexia and nausea. Abdominal ultrasonography 
indicated liver cirrhosis, and the patient received discontinuous 
hepatoprotective treatment.
A period of 2 years previously, the patient had exhibited 
abdominal distention and edema of the lower extremities. The 
effect of conservative treatment was poor, leading to the patient 
being admitted to the Department of Liver Transplantation for 
surgical treatment.
Considering that the patient had liver failure, a long-term 
smoking history, poor lung function and poor overall health, 
non-cardiopulmonary bypass treatment was selected, which 
exerts a small effect on lung function and circulation, and can 
be performed via an opening in the middle of the chest under 
routine anesthesia. The left internal mammary artery was 
bridged to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), and the 
great saphenous vein was bridged from the ascending aorta

to the posterior descending branch. Conventional whole-liver 
allogeneic orthotopic liver transplantation was subsequently 
performed during the surgery. The donor liver was anastomosed to the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and portal 
vein, and the hepatic artery and biliary tract were subsequently 
anastomosed. A T-shaped drainage tube was inserted. This 
treatment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tianjin 
First Central Hospital and was in conformity with the guidelines of National Institute of Health. Preoperative written 
informed consent was obtained from the patient.
After hospitalization, a chest and abdominal CT was 
performed for bilateral pleural effusion, cirrhosis and ascites 
(Figs. 1 and 2). The blood routine results obtained on September 
14th 2017 were as follows, normal ranges are displayed in 
brackets: White blood cell count (WBC), 2.72x109 cells/l 
(4-10x109 cells/l); red blood cell count (RBC), 2.56x1012 cells/l 
(3.5-5.5x1012 cells/l); hemoglobin count (HGB), 93.00 g/l 
(120-160 g/l); hematocrit count (HCT), 27.30% (40-48%); and 
platelet count, 50x109 cells/l (100-300 cells/l). The biochemistry 
results obtained on the same day were as follows: Total protein, 
53.0 g/l (60-80 g/l); albumin, 26.1 g/l (35-55 g/l); alanine aminotransferase, 15.3 U/l (10-64 U/l); aspartate aminotransferase, 
25.5 U/l (8-40 U/l); bilirubin, 59.36 µmol/l (5.1-20.5 µmol/l); 
direct bilirubin, 34.49 µmol/l (0-8 µmol/l); indirect bilirubin, 24.87 µmol/l (0-13.6 µmol/l)); potassium, 3.81 mmol/l 
(3.5-5.3 mmol/l); sodium, 137.2 mmol/l (137-147 mmol/l); 
blood urea nitrogen, 2.61 mmol/l (3.1-8.0 mmol/l); chromium, 
71.00 µmol/l (59-104 µmol/l); alkaline phosphatase, 101.1 U/l 
(45-125 U/l); γ-glutamyltransferase, 8.9 U/l (10-60 U/l); and 
Globulin, 26.9 g/l (20-40 g/l). The results of arterial blood 
gas analysis obtained on the same day were as follows: CO2, 
29.5 mmHg (35-48 mmHg); PO2,62.0 mmHg (83-108 mmHg); 
lactate, 3.03 mmol/l (0.5-1.6 mmol/l); and blood ammonia, 
70 µmol/l (18-60 µmol/l).
On November 7, 2017, prior to surgery, the routine blood 
examination results were as follows: WBC, 2.54x109 cells/l 
(4-10x109 cells/l); RBC, 2.46x1012 cells/l (3.5-5.5x1012 cells/l); 
HGB, 88.00 g/l (120-160 g/l); HCT, 26.30% (40-48%); and 
HLT, 53x109 cells/l (100-300/l). The results for preoperative 
coagulation function obtained on the same day were as follows: 
Kaolin partial thromboplastin time, 54.9 sec (26-42 sec); 
prothrombin time, 17.4 sec (8.8-13.8 sec); international 
normalized ratio, 1.54 (0.8-1.2); and prothrombin activity, 
50% (80-120%). The results for preoperative pulmonary function obtained on the same day were as follows: Restriction of 
ventilation function, reduced slightly; obstruction, reduced 
slightly; small airway function, moderately reduced; and 
dispersion function, severely reduced. The results for pleural 
effusion obtained on the same day were as follows: 4.7 cm 
on the right side and 2.1 cm on the left side. The patient was 
in an alcoholic liver cirrhosis decompensation period, so 
symptomatic treatment was administered. Namely, magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate injections (200 mg/day) to improve 
liver function, human serum albumin (10-20 g/day) to treat 
hypoproteinemia and enteral nutrition emulsion (500 ml/day) 
to improve the nutritional status of patients. During hospitalization, the patient exhibited recurrent angina pectoris. On 
October 17th 2017, according to coronary angiography, the 
areas from the left main artery to the anterior descending 
artery were calcified, and left main artery stenosis was at 
50%; the proximal to distal anterior descending artery exhibited diffuse lesions, and stenosis was at 70-90%. Aneurysms 
were also identified in the center of the anterior descending 
artery. The circumflex arteries were small and no obvious 
stenosis was observed. Distal right coronary artery stenosis 
was at 90% (Fig. 3).
The preoperative diagnosis was: i) Alcoholic cirrhosis and 
decompensated liver cirrhosis; ii) coronary heart disease and 
unstable angina; iii) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 
and iv) Grade C liver function (classified via the Child‑Pugh 
classification) (4) with clear indications for liver transplantation. The patient exhibited angina pectoris and could not 
tolerate routine liver transplantation surgery, and no liver 
donor was available. Therefore, the patient was transferred to 
the Department of Cardiac Surgery, and an off-pump coronary 
artery bypass graft was performed on November 8, 2017. 
Three Bridging (5) was built during the surgery (left internal 
mammary artery-LAD; aorta-SVG-posterior descending 
branch; and aorta-SVG-diagonal branch). On day 4 following 
surgery, a hemorrhagic effusion occurred in the middle and 
lower segment of the anterior thoracotomy, and the daily exudate 
amount was ~600 ml. Exudate also effused from the xiphoid 
process when the wound was opened. Following bilateral chest 
drainage, there was still a large amount of exudation from the 
anterior chest wound. Debridement and bilateral pleural repair 
surgery were performed on November 21, 2017 (Figs. 4 and 5). 
Following surgery, the patient received appropriate correction 
of hypoproteinemia and anti-infection treatment (tigecycline, 
50 mg/day, 21 days), however the wound did not heal. General 
anesthesia allograft liver transplantation was performed on 
December 8, 2017. Whole-liver orthotopic liver transplantation 
was performed intraoperatively. The donor liver was obtained 
from a brain-dead donor, and the cold ischemia period was 
240 min. Intraoperatively, the superior vena cava, inferior 
vena cava and portal vein were routinely anastomosed. One 
steel sternum wire was removed, and the wound was fixed. 
Anti-rejection (methylprednisolone 8 mg/day, cyclosporine 
170 mg/day and mycophenolate mofetil 2.0 g/day) and 
anti-infection treatments (Tigecycline, 50 mg/day) were 
provided after surgery, and the condition of the patient was 
stable following comprehensive nutritional treatment (enteral 
nutrition emulsion, 500 ml/day for 60 days). A purulent 
secretion was identified from the anterior chest wound at the 
level of the manubrium, and this was accompanied by a high 
fever. Culture following a wound swab indicated the presence 
of Staphylococcus aureus, and thus wound infection was 
considered. Anterior chest wound debridement was performed 
on January 8, 2018. Local necrotic bone was detected at the 
level of the manubrium. One steel sternum wire was removed 
at the second intercostal space. Recovery was good at the 
lower segment of sternum, and a curette was used to clean the 
necrotic bones. Necrotic bones were also identified at the right 
side of the manubrium, and debridement and gauze packing 
treatments were performed. The patient was transferred to a 
general ward to continue recovery. The sternum wound gradually healed, and there was intermittent purulent exudate near 
the xiphoid. Culturing indicated the presence of S. aureus, so 
chronic osteomyelitis was considered. Wound debridement 
was performed on February 5, 2018 due to the osteomyelitis. 
Sternal and costal cartilage necrosis was identified at the 

EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE 19: 3197-3202, 2020 3199
xiphoid process in the lower segment of the wound. One steel 
sternum wire was removed at the fourth intercostal space, and 
necrotic bone was scraped. A total of three costal cartilages 
on the left side and two costal cartilages were removed on the 
right side. Followings surgery, dressings were changed daily, 
the condition of the patient gradually stabilized and wound 
exudation gradually reduced. At 5 months after surgery, the 
wound had healed and the patient left hospital. The results 
of an abdominal CT (Fig. 6) and an ultrasound test were 
normal. The patient continued to receive methylprednisolone 
(8 mg/day), cyclosporine (170 mg/day), and mycophenolate 
mofetil (2.0 g/day) for anti-rejection therapy.
Discussion
Patients often exhibit coronary heart disease when waiting for 
liver transplantation and some patients cannot receive coronary 
stenting; therefore, coronary artery bypass grafting is the only 
effective treatment (6-9). Coronary artery bypass grafting is 
contraindicated in end-stage liver disease due to symptoms of 
coagulation dysfunction, refractory hypoalbuminemia, pleural 
effusion, edema of the lower extremities, hepatic encephalopathy, hypersplenism, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and 
gastrointestinal bleeding (10,11). In 2004, a study performed 
at Northwestern University (Evanston, IL, USA) reported 
five cases of patients with severe coronary heart disease and 
hepatic failure who received simultaneous coronary artery 
bypass grafting and liver transplantation, with an average 
age of 57.8 years (6). No perioperative death was exhibited 
in the aforementioned patients, and at the 25-month follow-up 
the survival rate was 80% (12). In 1997, Pelosi et al (12) introduced 12 cases of liver transplantation following coronary 
artery bypass graft. To the best of our knowledge, no clinical 
literature report on coronary artery bypass graft surgery for 
alcoholic liver cirrhosis and hepatic failure exists. In the current 
case, the patient exhibited advanced alcoholic liver cirrhosis, 
and life-threatening angina pectoris occurred frequently 
while the patient waited for a donor liver. An emergency 
coronary artery bypass graft was performed subsequently, 
and wound infection (S. aureus) occurred following surgery. 
During wound treatment, orthotopic liver transplantation was 
performed, and the postoperative abdominal wound healed 
well. The chest wound also healed after multiple debridements.
End-stage liver disease is a contraindication for coronary artery bypass graft. If liver transplantation and CABG 
cannot be performed simultaneously, surgery should be 
selected carefully. End-stage liver disease leads to a number 
of complications (13,14), and blood loss is often high; heavy 
heparinization during coronary artery bypass grafting 
will exacerbate the risk of bleeding (15). Hypoproteinemia 
also causes poor nutritional status and poor tissue healing 
ability (16), and coronary artery bypass surgery wounds can 
easily become infected and lead to secondary sternal osteomyelitis (17). Systemic tissue edema and pleural effusion can 
cause a decrease in respiratory function, and pleural breakage 
may be difficult to repair due to thoracotomy and internal 
mammary artery incision (18). Postoperative decompensation 
of liver cirrhosis causes continuous production and outflow 
of pleural fluid, which can lead to slow wound recovery (19). 
Additionally, hypersplenism leads to severe leukopenia, 
anemia and other immune deficiencies, which can lead to 
secondary infections (20). Postoperative blood transfusion 
is also likely to induce hepatic encephalopathy and increase 
infection risk (21). Patients can also exhibit angina pectoris 
during the waiting period for liver transplantation, which may 
not be effectively alleviated using drug therapy. Coronary 
artery lesions can also develop into diffuse coronary calcification stenosis, and medical interventional therapy cannot be 
subsequently performed; in this case, salvage coronary artery 
bypass grafting should be performed (22).
During coronary artery bypass grafting, the damaged 
pleura should be completely closed to prevent pleural effusion, and to prevent interference with wound healing (23).

an abdominal CT indicated bilateral pleural effusion, cirrhosis and ascites, 
as shown by the red arrow.

CT tested bilateral pleural effusion, cirrhosis and ascites as highlighted by 
the red arrow.

3200 CHAI et al: ADVANCED ALCOHOLIC LIVER CIRRHOSIS: A CASE REPORT
The majority of pleura in patients are thin, and it is difficult 
to repair these following pleural breakage (24). Pneumothorax 
occurred after opening the anterior thoracic wound, and 
pleural effusion continued. The anterior thoracic wound was 
opened and repaired, and the wound was sutured after pleural 
effusion catheterization. The middle and lower part of the 
wound was subsequently opened to change the dressing due 
to low protein, malnutrition, secondary infection, persistent 
exudation of pleural effusion, persistent reduction of protein 
and aggravated liver cirrhosis (25-28).
For patients with normal heart function and severe coronary artery disease, simultaneous liver transplantation during 
coronary artery bypass grafting can be selected, to avoid the 
risk of acute myocardial infarction during liver transplantation

chest wound. Exudate effused from the xiphoid process when the wound 
was opened. After bilateral chest drainage, there was still a large amount of 
exudate that effused from the anterior chest wound.

and reduce the impact of liver failure on patient recovery 
following the coronary artery bypass graft (12). In the present 
case, the angina pectoris was life-threatening and could not 
be alleviated, so an emergency coronary artery bypass graft 
was performed. As there was no suitable liver donor, liver 
transplantation and coronary artery bypass grafting could 
not be performed simultaneously. After coronary artery 
bypass grafting, the wound did not heal and liver function 
deteriorated, and a large quantity of pleural fluid leaked. Liver 
transplantation was performed when the anterior thoracic 
wound was unhealed. Immunosuppressive agents were used 
to decrease the risk of infection. Chronic osteomyelitis and 
S. aureus infection occurred in the anterior chest wound. 
The wound healed following two rounds of necrotic tissue 
debridement.
For patients with hepatic failure, when performing thoracotomy, the bilateral pleura should not be opened. If pleural 
damage and breakage is observed, an autologous or allogeneic 
pericardial patch should be used to close the breakage (29), 
and this is essential to prevent postoperative wound dehiscence, exudation and infection (30,31). A sternal incision, 
intercostal incision or a robot can be used to perform coronary 
artery bypass graft. In the current case, the bilateral pleural 
crevasses were not repaired, and pleural fluid continued to 
leak out after the operation. Then, tension pneumothorax 
occurred, and emergent pleural repair and wound suturing 
were performed. After suturing, the wounds could not heal 
due to low protein, anemia and hypersplenism caused by liver 
failure. During the operation, the superior and inferior vena 
cava were exposed, and an abdominal cavity expander was 
used, as the steel wire of the lower sternum was loosened, 
to avoid cutting the sternum. After liver transplantation, the 
wound was sutured after the sternum was fixed. Due to the use 
of immunosuppressive agents after transplantation, S. aureus
infection was indicated in the upper sternum near the second 
costal cartilage at 1 month after transplantation, and debridement of the local sternum and costal cartilage was performed. 
During this period, the healed sternum should be protected 
to avoid cracking. A period of 2 months after transplantation, 
local infection in the lower segment of the sternum occurred, 
and healed after debridement.
Multidisciplinary collaboration and comprehensive 
supportive treatment after liver transplantation is the key to 
successful postoperative recovery. Performing liver transplantation during the period when the anterior chest wound 
is unhealed, combined with the use of immunosuppressive 
agents, can increase the risk of wound infection. After 5 days 
of intensive care treatment, the liver function of the patient 
gradually recovered, and the patient was transferred to an 
intensive care unit. The patient was given adequate nutritional 
support through a naso-intestinal tube; the recovery of gastrointestinal function accelerated, and the liver function became 
normal with treatment. The secretions of the anterior chest 
wound tested positive for S. aureus infection. The wounds 
healed gradually after two rounds of debridement. The patient 
recovered and was discharged 5 months after the coronary 
artery bypass graft and 4 months after liver transplantation. 
During the long course of treatment in the current case, lessons 
can be learnt regarding the surgical choice, wound management, postoperative liver function recovery, heart and kidney 
function maintenance, and nutritional support, and the present 
report may provide a reference for the use of thoracotomy in 
liver failure.
