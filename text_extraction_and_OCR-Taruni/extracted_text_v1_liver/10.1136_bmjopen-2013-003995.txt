ABSTRACT
Introduction: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is
now the commonest cause of chronic liver disease.
Despite this, there are no universally accepted
pharmacological therapies for NASH. Liraglutide
(Victoza), a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
analogue, has been shown to improve weight loss,
glycaemic control and liver enzymes in type 2 diabetes.
There is currently a lack of prospective-controlled
studies investigating the efficacy of GLP-1 analogues in
patients with NASH.
Methods and analysis: Liraglutide efficacy and
action in NASH (LEAN) is a phase II, multicentre,
double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical
trial designed to investigate whether a 48-week
treatment with 1.8 mg liraglutide will result in
improvements in liver histology in patients with NASH.
Adult, overweight (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2
)
patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH were assessed
for eligibility at five recruitment centres in the UK.
Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were
randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily
subcutaneous injections of either 1.8 mg liraglutide or
liraglutide-placebo (control). Using A’Hern’s single
stage phase II methodology (significance level 0.05;
power 0.90) and accounting for an estimated 20%
withdrawal rate, a minimum of 25 patients were
randomised to each treatment group. The primary
outcome measure will be centrally assessed using an
intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of
evaluable patients achieving an improvement in liver
histology between liver biopsies at baseline and after
48 weeks of treatment. Histological improvement will
be defined as a combination of the disappearance of
active NASH and no worsening in fibrosis.
Ethics and dissemination: The protocol was
approved by the National Research Ethics Service (East
Midlands—Northampton committee; 10/H0402/32)
and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency. Recruitment into the LEAN started in August
2010 and ended in May 2013, with 52 patients
randomised. The treatment follow-up of LEAN
participants is currently ongoing and is due to finish in
July 2014. The findings of this trial will be
disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and
international presentations.
Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01237119.
INTRODUCTION
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is
now the commonest cause of chronic liver
disease, affecting up to 30% of the general
population1–3 and 70–90% of high-risk individuals.3 4 This prevalence relates to the dramatic rise in recent years of morbid obesity
and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Even though
simple hepatic steatosis (without fibrosis) is
arguably a benign condition, up to a quarter
of patients with NAFLD have the more
severe, inflammatory condition known as
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).5
Patients with NASH have an increased risk of
progression to cirrhosis, liver failure and
hepatocellular carcinoma,6 and are expected
to become the commonest indication for
liver transplantation in forthcoming years.7
Despite this, there are no universally
accepted pharmacological therapies for
NASH. Therefore the need for novel, safe
agents in NASH is of paramount importance
to prevent disease progression and the
accompanying clinical burden.
The strong association of NASH with metabolic syndromes, in particular central adiposity and insulin resistance, provides a strong
rationale for investigating therapies that
induce weight loss and insulin sensitivity. The
gut-derived incretin hormone, glucagon-like

peptide-1 (GLP-1), is therefore an attractive target
option in NASH. Native GLP-1 has a potent blood
glucose-lowering action mediated through its ability to
induce insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion
in a glucose-dependent manner, as well as suppressing
appetite and slowing gastric emptying.8 Human GLP-1,
however, only has a short half-life (1.5–2 min) as it is
rapidly degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(DPP-4).9 Liraglutide (Victoza) is a long-acting (half-life
13 h) GLP-1 analogue with 97% structural homology to
the native hormone and is administered once daily by
subcutaneous injection.10 Liraglutide has been shown to
cause dose-dependent weight loss,11 12 decrease glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure and
improve β-cell function.13–18 Subsequently, it has been
licensed for glycaemic control in overweight patients
with type 2 diabetes (T2D).19 There is, however, a
paucity of data in patients with liver disease, and in particular histologically defined NASH.
GLP-1 analogues, including liraglutide, have been
shown to improve liver enzymes, oxidative stress and
hepatic steatosis in murine models in vivo and in isolated
in vitro murine and human hepatocyte studies.20–25 To
date, human studies investigating the effect on liver
injury have been limited to case reports,26 27 solitary case
series (n=8)28 and retrospective (liver enzyme) studies in
patients with T2D.29 A large meta-analysis of six phase III
randomised controlled trials (RCT), that comprised the
Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) programme (>4000 patients), highlighted that the 26-week
treatment with 1.8 mg once daily liraglutide was welltolerated and resulted in significant improvements in
liver enzymes compared to placebo control in overweight
patients with T2D.30 However, limitations of this study
were the retrospective nature of its analysis and the lack
of any liver biopsy data.
On this basis, we hypothesised that the 48-week treatment with liraglutide would result in significant
improvements in liver histology in overweight patients
with NASH. To test this hypothesis, we designed a phase
II, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCT,
entitled ‘Liraglutide Efficacy and Action in NASH
(LEAN).’
METHODS
Study design overview
LEAN is a 48-week multicentre, double-blinded, placebocontrolled randomised clinical trial of treatment with the
once daily human GLP-1 analogue, liraglutide (Victoza),
for adults with biopsy-proven NASH. Screening was
undertaken within 14 days of randomisation to assess eligibility and collect baseline data. Patients who satisfied
the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to
receive subcutaneous injections once daily of either
1.8 mg liraglutide (experimental) or liraglutide-placebo
(control). After which, a 12-week washout period is
scheduled.
The primary outcome measure will be assessed using
an intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of evaluable patients achieving an improvement in liver histology
between liver biopsies at baseline (within 6 months of
screening) and after 48 weeks of treatment. Histological
improvement will be defined as a combination of the
disappearance of active steatohepatitis (ie, disappearance of hepatocyte ballooning) and no worsening in
fibrosis (Kleiner Fibrosis score31). A schematic of the
trial design is summarised in figure 1.
Ethical and regulatory approval
The National Research Ethics Service (NRES) East
Midlands—Northampton committee (previously known
as Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland
Research Ethics Committee, UK) and the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)
approved all versions (including current V.7.0) of the study
Figure 1 Schematic of liraglutide efficacy and action in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis trial design. Eligible participants are
randomly assigned to a 48-week treatment of once daily subcutaneous injections of either 1.8 mg liraglutide or placebo control.
Both the trial investigators and the participants are blinded to drug allocation.

protocol. In addition, all five recruitment sites obtained
approval from their respective hospital Research and
Development (R&D) departments prior to the start
of screening.
Treatment groups
Patients who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to a 48-week treatment of
either liraglutide (Victoza; 1.8 mg once daily) or
liraglutide-placebo control (1.8 mg once daily).
Liraglutide (active experimental group)
Liraglutide (Victoza, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd,
Denmark) was supplied in a cartridge contained in a
prefilled multidose disposable pen. Each prefilled pen
contained 18 mg liraglutide in 3 mL of clear, colourless,
isotonic solution (including water for injections, disodium phosphate dehydrate, propylene glycol and
phenol). Liraglutide was administered once daily, at any
time of the day, as a single subcutaneous injection into
the abdomen, thigh or upper arm using the prefilled
pen (30 or 31 gauge needles). Participants were encouraged to inject liraglutide at the same time each day,
according to the most convenient time for them.
Participants were instructed to perform an air shot of
0.2 µL before the first use of each new prefilled pen to
ensure that it functioned correctly.
To improve gastrointestinal tolerability participants
underwent a 14-day dose-titration period in keeping with
previous reports.13–18 The dose was titrated by 0.6 mg
every 7 days from a starting dose of 0.6 mg once daily until
the maximum dose of 1.8 mg once daily was achieved.
Prior to the current trial design, no study had investigated
any form of GLP-1-based therapy in patients with biopsyconfirmed NASH or any other form of liver disease.
Therefore, the rationale for using a dose of 1.8 mg once
daily was based on previous reports in overweight patients
with or without T2D.13–18 Furthermore, a large
meta-analysis of six phase III clinical trials (LEAD programme) of liraglutide therapy for poorly controlled T2D
found that patients with abnormal liver transaminases had
a similar drug safety profile to those with normal liver
transaminases. In addition, greater improvements in liver
transaminases and CT-measured hepatic steatosis were
seen with 1.8 mg liraglutide than 1.2 and 0.6 mg doses.30
Liraglutide-placebo (inactive, placebo-control group)
Liraglutide-placebo (Victoza, Novo Nordisk A/S,
Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was packaged, administered and
dose-titrated in an identical manner to the liraglutide comparator, described above. The composition of the placebo
solution for injection was identical to its comparator, with
the exclusion of the active liraglutide substance. A placebo
was used to provide an assessment of the level of response
with an injectable placebo, which could potentially be
higher than that seen with oral placebo agents.
Concomitant therapy
No dose reductions of liraglutide or placebo were
allowed throughout the 48-week treatment period.
Previous treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (metformin and/or sulfonylurea) was continued at the same
dose in participants with T2D at randomisation. In the
event of recurrent major hypoglycaemic episodes
(requiring medical or hospital intervention), the dose of
the sulfonylurea was reduced by 50% at the discretion of
the investigators. The reported rate of hypoglycaemia in
literature, with liraglutide monotherapy or in combination with metformin, is very low.13–18 However in the
event of recurrent major hypoglycaemic episodes in
which no dose reduction could be undertaken (ie, not
on a sulfonylurea) the participant was withdrawn from
treatment at the discretion of the chief investigator.
Glycaemic control was assessed at each 12-weekly trial
visit with self-measured plasma glucose readings and
HbA1c. In the event that glycaemic control deteriorated,
defined as HbA1c >9% (75 mmol/mol), the participant
was informed and counselled with regard to starting openlabelled long-acting insulin detemir once daily (Levemir).
However, the patient’s participation in the trial was not jeopardised if they did not wish to start insulin detemir. The
insulin detemir dose was titrated by trial investigators in
accordance with European guidelines (http://www.ema.
europa.eu) to ensure that the participant’s standard of diabetes care was not significantly compromised as a result of
participating in the clinical trial. The HbA1c cut-off >9%
was based on the opinions of the TMG (MJA and PNN),
consisting of expert endocrinologists (SCLG and JWT),
and in accordance with previous clinical trial guidance.32
In addition to study medications, participants continued
to receive standard National Health Services (NHS) care
recommendations concerning life-style modifications (ie,
exercise, weight loss and dietary modification) and management of various coexisting illnesses throughout the
trial. Patients were asked to limit alcohol consumption to
less than 20 mg/day for women (ie, 14 units/week) and
30 mg/day for men (ie, 21 units/week). These levels were
consistent with the UK Department of Health recommended daily alcohol allowance (British Medical
Association 1995). Participants were not allowed any new
prescription or over-the-counter therapies (ie, herbal remedies, milk thistle) that may improve or worsen NASH
throughout the duration of the trial. Potential NASH therapies that were not allowed during the trial duration
included thiazolidinediones (TZDs), DPP-4 inhibitors,
other GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, exenatide), vitamin E
and orlistat. Steroids (oral or intravenous), methotrexate
and/or amiodarone were also not permitted based on
their ability to promote hepatic steatosis.
Outcome measures
Primary outcome measure
The primary outcome measure is the proportion of participants with a significant improvement in liver histology
between liver biopsies at baseline (ie, within 6 months of
Armstrong MJ, Barton D, Gaunt P, et al. BMJ Open 2013;3:e003995. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003995 3

screening) and at the end of a 48-week treatment. The
definition of a significant histological improvement
requires both the disappearance of steatohepatitis
(defined as a disappearance of hepatocyte ballooning)
and no worsening of fibrosis, as assessed by the Kleiner
scoring system.31 Hepatocyte ballooning is now widely
recognised as the key lesion for distinguishing NASH
from simple steatosis.
Secondary outcome measures
Secondary outcome measures include changes in; (1)
overall NAFLD Activity Score (NAS)31; (2) individual
histological components of NAS, including lobular
inflammation, steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and fibrosis; (3) serum markers of steatosis (SteatoTest), NASH
(NashTest, caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 (CK-18 M30))
and fibrosis (Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF; iQUR Ltd),
FibroTest); (4) liver stiffness evaluation (LSE) with
Transient Elastography (Fibroscan, Echosens, Paris,
France); (5) insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); (6)
anthropometric measures including body weight, body
mass index (BMI) and waist circumference; (7) lipid
profile and glycaemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma
glucose); (8) serum alanine aminotransferase levels and
(9) health-related quality of life (QOL; SF-26 V.2.0) and
nutrition (Block Brief 2000 Food Frequency
Questionnaire (FFQ) questionnaires).
Analytical methods
Liver histopathology
Two independent liver histopathologists (SGH and
RMB) at the central trial site (Birmingham, UK) will
perform all the histopathological assessments using an
in-house designed proforma (see online supplementary
table S1). Both histopathologists will be blinded to the
clinical, laboratory and study treatment allocation. The
histological diagnosis of NASH will be established using
H&E staining and haematoxylin van Gieson stains of
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue. Both the
baseline and end-of-treatment (48 weeks) biopsies will
be reported as either ‘definite NASH,’ ‘uncertain
NASH’ or ‘not NASH.’ The histological diagnosis of
‘definite NASH’ is defined as a combination of >5%
macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning
(± Mallory’s Hyaline) and lobular inflammation (mixed
infiltrate, related to foci of ballooning).33 The assessment of ballooning is subjective, and thus for ‘uncertain’
hepatocyte ballooning, a key component of the diagnosis of NASH, ubiquitin immunohistochemistry will be
used to identify material compatible with Mallory’s

hyaline (figure 2). To validate the quality of the biopsy
specimen, the core specimen length will be measured
and the number of portal tracts will be recorded.
The NAS will be calculated based on the Kleiner classification.31 The NAS is scored of 8, with 8 representing the
highest activity. The NAS is the sum of scores of the 3 components of the histological scoring system, namely steatosis
(0=<5%, 1=5–33%, 2=>33–66%, 3=>66%), lobular inflammation (0=no foci, 1=<2 foci/×200, 2=2–4 foci/×200, 3=>4
foci) and hepatocyte ballooning (0=none, 1=few ballooned cells, 2=many cells/prominent ballooning). The
Kleiner scoring system for NAFLD fibrosis (F0-F4)31 and a
modified version of the Ishak score34 (F0-F6; see online
supplementary table S1) will be used to evaluate the stage
of fibrosis in each biopsy specimen. The Ishak score was
modified from the original scoring system, reported in
1995,34 in order to include the zone 3 peri-cellular/perisinusoidal fibrosis, which is characteristically seen in
NASH. Portal tract changes (inflammation, interface
hepatitis, ductular reaction), an intrinsic feature of NASH,
will also be recorded.35
The pathologists will assess the biopsies independently
and fill in separate forms. Cases where there is disagreement on the classification, as ‘NASH’ or ‘not NASH,’ will
be reviewed and a consensus opinion given. Also discrepancies of more than 1 point on any of the scoring scales
(NAS, Kleiner fibrosis scoring system and modified Ishak
score) will be reviewed and an amended consensus view
offered. Discrepancies of only 1 point will not be altered.
Clinical and laboratory data
Fasting blood samples will be analysed for full blood
count, urea, creatinine and electrolytes, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), lipid profile (total cholesterol, highdensity lipoprotein, triglycerides), liver function tests, prothrombin time, international normalised ratio (INR),
amylase, α-fetoprotein, C reactive protein, HbA1c, calcitonin and plasma glucose using standard laboratory
methods (Roche Modular system, Roche Ltd, Lewes, UK).
Serum Insulin (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden), nonesterified fatty acids (Zen-Bio, Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina, USA) and CK-18 M30 (M30 Apoptosense
ELISA Kit; PEVIVA AB, Bromma, Sweden) will be measured in-house using commercially available colorimetric
ELISAs. Serum caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18 (CK-18
M30) and the ELF Test were performed at study entry to
assess hepatic apoptosis and fibrosis, respectively. The
FibroMax panel (consisting of the SteatoTest, NashTest,
FibroTest) will be undertaken by Lab 21 Ltd (Cambridge,
UK). The ELF test, which combines three direct serum
markers of fibrosis (hyaluronic acid, pro-collagen III
amino terminal peptide and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1) using an algorithm developed by the European
Liver Fibrosis Group,36 will be performed on fasting serum
stored at −80° by a commercial laboratory (iQUR Ltd,
Royal Free Hospital, London, UK).
T2D was considered present if patients had a recorded
diagnosis in their medical records or if the fasting
plasma glucose was ≥7 mmol/L and/or if the 2 h 75 g
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma glucose was
≥11.1 mmol/L. All patients without a recorded history
of T2D were screened with an OGTT. Impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT) was defined as a 2 h plasma glucose
between 7.8 and 11.1 mmol/L. HOMA-IR, a marker of
insulin resistance, was calculated in the standard
fashion: glucose×insulin/22.5.
Measurements of weight (kg), height, systolic/diastolic
blood pressure and waist:hip circumferences were
recorded. Waist and hip circumferences were defined as
the circumferential measurements immediately above
the level of the iliac crests and at the level of the greater
trochanters, respectively. BMI was defined as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres
(kg/m2
).
LSE was measured using Transient Elastography
(Fibroscan, Echosens, France). The median value and
IQR of 10 validated measurements were recorded within
the range of 2.5–75 kPa. The XL probe was used on individuals who have a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2 or when
the Fibroscan 502 Touch machine (automated) recommends its use over the M-probe. To achieve a valid LSE
(median of successful liver stiffness measurements) the
operator had to obtain all of the following three criteria:
(1) ≥10 successful liver stiffness measurements; (2)
IQR/median ratio <0.30 and (3) ≥60% measurement
success rate.37
Patient questionnaires
QOL was assessed by the Short Form 36 V.2.0 (SF-36v2)
health-related QOL questionnaire (QualityMetric Health
Outcomes Solutions, Lincoln, USA). The SF-36v2 questionnaire was a practical, reliable and valid measure of
physical and mental health that could be completed in
5–10 min. It consisted of 36 questions that assessed the
functional health and well-being from the study participant’s point of view.38 The Block Brief 2000 FFQ (Block
Dietary Data Systems, California, USA) was completed
by each participant to assess the usual and customary
intake of a wide array of nutrients and food groups. The
food list incorporated in the Block questionnaire was
developed from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey III dietary recall data. The Block
Brief 2000 FFQ consisted of a well-validated selfadministered questionnaire consisting of 70 food-related
questions and took approximately 15 min to complete.39
Pictures of standardised serving sizes and an
American-to-English food translation sheet (ie,
‘Catsup’=tomato ‘Ketchup’) were used to aid completion
of the questionnaire.
The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test
(AUDIT) questionnaire was used to assess the frequency
of alcohol consumption and screen out alcohol-related
problems, and dependence symptoms.40 The AUDIT
questionnaire consisted of a 10-item questionnaire that
took 2–5 min to complete. The questionnaire has a positive predictive value of 98% for hazardous drinking, and
Armstrong MJ, Barton D, Gaunt P, et al. BMJ Open 2013;3:e003995. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003995 5
Open Access

a negative predictive value of 97% for alcohol dependence. The overall score ranges from 0 to 40, with a score
of less than 8 being a good indication of insignificant
alcohol consumption.
All questionnaires were completed at baseline (visit 1),
end-of-treatment (visit 7) and 12 weeks post-treatment
(visit 8). Analysis will report the change from baseline
scores to both the end-of-treatment and follow-up scores.
Statistical justification and outcome analysis
Sample size justification
This is an early phase II trial randomising patients
equally between two treatment arms—one experimental
(liraglutide) and one control (placebo). The primary
aim is not to determine the efficacy of liraglutide compared with placebo but to assess whether the efficacy
and safety profile of liraglutide is worthy of further investigation. Recruiting patients into a no-treatment control
group provides simultaneous unbiased assessment of
comparable patient groups.
At the time of the study design there were no available
data to estimate histological response with a 48-week
treatment of liraglutide (Victoza). Based on previous
non-GLP-1 pharmaceutical trials in NASH utilising
improvements in liver histology as a primary endpoint,41 42 it was assumed that 14–17% of patients undergoing current standard of care (placebo) would have an
improvement in NASH by week 48. It was estimated that
20% of the placebo-control arm would achieve an
improvement in liver histology, based in part on the
knowledge that the placebo effect might be exaggerated
by the subcutaneous injection route of administration
(vs oral route in previous NASH trials) in the current
trial. To justify further investigation of liraglutide treatment, a clinically relevant improvement in liver histology
was required in at least 50% of patients. The sample size
was calculated using A’Hern’s single stage phase II methodology,43 with a significance level of 0.05 (type 1 error)
and power of 0.90 (type II error). The design required
21 evaluable patients in the treatment group. The published literature in NASH trials reported on average a
participant withdrawal rate of 10–20%.41 42 44 Therefore,
to account for a 20% withdrawal rate the recruitment
target was inflated from 21 to 25 patients per treatment
group; the total recruitment target being 50 patients
randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio to either liraglutide
or placebo.
Analysis of outcome measures
All evaluable patients will be analysed on the
intention-to-treat principle. Evaluable patients are
defined as those who have had an end-of-treatment
biopsy (visit 7), irrespective of the amount of treatment
they have received. Patients will be categorised as either
achieving the primary histological endpoint (ie, disappearance in NASH) or not. The proportion of
patients with a reported improvement in liver histology
will be presented and compared across treatments
descriptively with 95% CIs. The proposed A’Hern’s
design stipulates that 8 or more evaluable patients of 21
in the experimental treatment group (liraglutide) need
to achieve the defined improvement in liver histology
for treatment with liraglutide to be deemed worthy of
further investigation with a phase III trial. Analyses will
be presented for the subgroups of patients with and
without T2D. Patients who have not had an
end-of-treatment biopsy will be classed as non-evaluable
and will not be included in the primary analysis.
Secondary analysis of the primary outcome measure
will report (1) the number and proportion of patients
that did not have an end-of-treatment biopsy and the
reasons for this (these will be classified as ‘no histological improvement’) and (2) the number and proportion of patients that were considered to have had
sufficient treatment and an end-of-treatment biopsy. In
addition, an analysis that directly compares the two proportions for the separate treatment arms will be performed using the χ2 test.
Secondary measures collected as continuous and categorical variables will be presented with 95% CIs
descriptively across treatments using medians and proportions, respectively. Secondary measures collected as
longitudinal data (including QOL data, scored as per
the questionnaire-specific scoring manuals) will be presented descriptively across treatment groups as changes
over time. A summary of all adverse events (AEs) experienced by patients in both arms will be reported.
CONDUCT OF THE TRIAL
Patient selection
Eligible adults (≥18 years old) were identified and
recruited at the participating trial site centres starting in
August 2010 and by May 2013, 52 patients were
recruited. Participating UK trial centres included the
liver units at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital
(Birmingham, from August 2010), Queens Medical
Centre (Nottingham, from May 2011), Southampton
General Hospital (Southampton, September 2011), Hull
Royal Infirmary (Hull, November 2011) and St James
Hospital (Leeds, from May 2012). All trial participants
gave informed written consent at the beginning of the
screening visit prior to undergoing any tests and procedures needed to assess eligibility.
Eligibility for the trial was determined at screening
visit 1 by standard blood tests, clinical history (including
written-confirmation of drug history where necessary)
and physical examination/observations to identify other
illnesses or contraindications for participation (trial
schedule figure). In addition, after receiving formal
training the patient’s ability to understand and selfadminister the subcutaneous injections using the prefilled treatment pen was assessed by an experienced
nurse specialist at screening visit 2. Patients who satisfied
the eligibility criteria for the 48-week treatment trial at
the Birmingham site were given the option to participate

in a metabolic mechanistic substudy. The substudy
involved two overnight admissions (approximately 22 h)
to the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility
(Birmingham) to undergo a two-step hyperinsulinaemic
euglycaemic clamp with stable isotopes and adipose
microdialysis on visits 2 (pretreatment) and 4 (12-week
treatment). A detailed summary of the metabolic substudy will be published separately. A patient’s decision to
partake or withdraw from the metabolic substudy did
not affect their participation in the main 48-week trial.
Inclusion criteria
The trial entry criteria were based on a diagnosis of ‘definite’ NASH on liver biopsy obtained within 6 months of
screening. Prior to randomisation, two independent
liver histopathologists (SGH and RMB) from the central
trial site (University Hospital Birmingham, UK) reviewed
all of the liver biopsies (internal and external trial sites)
of the potential participants to assess whether a diagnosis of ‘definite’ NASH was present. A ‘definite’ diagnosis
of NASH was defined if all of the following were present
on biopsy: (1) macrovesicular steatosis (>5%); (2) hepatocyte ballooning (± Mallory Hyaline) and (3) lobular
inflammation (mixed infiltrate, related to foci of ballooning). The two independent histopathology case
report forms (CRFs) were reviewed by a trial investigator
(MJA) and in the event that the histopathologists disagreed with regard to the diagnosis of NASH (ie, one
judged ‘uncertain’ and the other ‘definite’) a combined
histopathology assessment was undertaken to determine
the patient’s eligibility status. Only patients with ‘definite’ NASH (either on two independent reports or after
joint review) were classified as eligible.
All participants had to be ≥18 to <70 years of age and
have a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 at screening. Patients with T2D
mellitus at screening had to have stable glycaemic
control (HbA1c <9%) and be managed by either diet
and/or a stable dose of metformin/sulfonylurea.
Patients without a history of T2D prior to the screening
visit underwent OGTT at screening to determine their
glycaemic status and were labelled as ‘non-diabetic’ if
one or more of the following was confirmed
▸ Impaired fasting glucose, defined using the European
Criteria between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/L.
▸ IGT, defined as 2 h plasma glucose levels between 7.8
and 11.0 mmol/L on the 75 g OGTT.
▸ Normal Fasting Plasma Glucose <6.1 mmol/L and
normal 2 h plasma glucose levels <7.8 on the 75 g
OGTT.
Exclusion criteria
A detailed summary of the exclusion criteria is provided
in box 1. In brief, patients with a history or current significant alcohol consumption, poor glycaemic control
(HbA1c >9.0%), Child’s Pugh B or C cirrhosis or other
liver disease aetiology were excluded. The latter was confirmed with a full liver aetiology screen (drug induced,
viral hepatitis B/C, autoimmune and genetic) at the
screening visit. Past and current alcohol consumption
was ascertained by a detailed review of the patient’s
medical, social history and by a self-administered AUDIT
questionnaire with reference pictures to remind participants of drink equivalents. Concomitant use of drugs
reported to be inducers (methotrexate, amiodarone,
steroids) or potential therapies for NASH (TZDs,
vitamin E), or other known hepatotoxins were assessed
during the screening visit (box 1). In keeping with previous clinical trials assessing GLP-1 therapies, patients with
a history of acute/chronic pancreatitis (of any cause),
pancreatic and thyroid carcinoma, and/or a family
history of medullary thyroid carcinoma were also
excluded.
Randomisation
Participants who met all the eligibility criteria and provided written informed consent were randomly assigned
on a 1:1 basis to either of the two-study treatments (liraglutide vs placebo) using computer generated randomisation at the Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit
(CRCTU). The randomisation was stratified to ensure
that there were equal numbers of patients with/without
T2D in each treatment group and that each trial site
had equal numbers of patients on each treatment. Trial
participants were allocated a unique trial identification
number to preserve patient confidentiality and enable
the study to be double-blinded.
Medication preparation and blinding/unblinding
procedures
Both liraglutide and placebo control were packaged and
labelled with a unique identification number (in
keeping with the European Unions Good
Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Product guidelines) by the manufacturer (Novo Nordisk Ltd), to the
extent that the receiving trial site was blinded to the
study drug throughout the duration of the trial. Sealed
parcels (containing electronic information) were sent
with each drug package for the attention of the
unblinded members of the central trial management
group (TMG) nominated statistician, PG and database
programmer, PM, to ensure (1) safe delivery of the
correct drug and (2) blinding of the treatment allocation from the remainder of the TMG and the trial
patient. An independent unblinding service (24/7) was
provided by the Medical toxicology and Information services, Guys hospital (London, UK), throughout the duration of the trial.
Unblinding of treatment only takes place if the identity of the allocated study medication was necessary for
patient safety and care. If a serious adverse event (SAE)
was deemed unexpected and possibly, probably or definitely related to liraglutide (ie, suspected unexpected
serious adverse reaction=SUSAR), a clinical member of
the TMG was unblinded to the medication to evaluate
causality. Subsequently, the event was either labelled as
an unrelated SAE (for patients receiving placebo) or a

Open Access

SUSAR (for patients receiving liraglutide). The latter
were reported to the MHRA and the NRES, and only if
patient safety was jeopardised was the study medication
discontinued and the treating clinician/patient
informed.
AE reporting and analysis
The reporting period for AEs started at screening visit 1
and continued until follow-up visit 8. SAEs were
reported until day 336 (week 48) of the trial treatment
and for 30 days post-EOT. All SAEs and adverse reactions
were evaluated by the investigators and recorded. The
National Cancer Institute’s common terminology criteria
for AEs (CTCAE, V.4.02, 2010) was used to grade each
AE. The central trial office (CRCTU, Birmingham) kept
detailed records of all AEs reported (nature, onset, duration, severity, outcome) and performed an evaluation
with respect to seriousness, causality and expectedness.
Interim analysis of safety data was performed and presented to the independent data management committee
(DMC) on a 6-monthly basis. The unblinded DMC
advised accordingly with regards to the trial conduct
and specifically whether extra/new data monitoring was
required for the remainder of the trial. The DMC operated in accordance with a trial specific charter based on
the template created by the Damocles Group. Specific
attention was given to AEs related to the thyroid
(measures of blood calcitonin, TSH and physical

Study visit overview
The LEAN trial involved eight patient-related visits at
their nearest trial site. The study was divided into four
stages: (1) screening, enrolment, randomisation and
baseline investigations (visits 1 and 2, over a maximum
period of 14 days), (2) 336 days of study treatment (visits
3–6, over 48 weeks), (3) primary endpoint assessment
including liver biopsy (visit 7, within 1 day of the EOT)
and (4) post-treatment follow-up assessment (visit 8,
12 weeks after EOT). If the trial investigating team or
the trial participant suspected an AE, an unscheduled
visit was arranged within 24 h.
The schedule for the study visits and data collection is
summarised in table 1. All participants were asked to
attend each visit under fasting from eating or drinking
(with exception of water) for a minimum of 8 h prior to
each visit. A follow-up liver biopsy (ie, primary endpoint)
was obtained under ultrasound-guidance after completion of the 48-week study treatment. Wherever possible,
a 16-gauge biopsy needle and a specimen length of a
minimum of 15 mm were preferred. The liver tissue was
prepared at the local trial sites in preparation for histological assessment (under light microscopy) at the
central trial site at the Queen Elizabeth University
Hospital Birmingham. On receipt, the two central
‘blinded’ central histopathologists recorded the size and
quality of the histology slides. A minimum of four
unstained slides were available for each liver biopsy to
enable repeat staining (H&E, haematoxylin van Gieson,
Ubiquitin) to ensure adequate quality for interpretation.
Storage of trial samples
Liver biopsy tissue specimens were collected, paraffinfixed and stored at the diagnostic archive of the department of cellular pathology (University Hospital
Birmingham). Serum and plasma samples collected at
visit 1 (screening), visits 4, 5, 7 (EOT) and 8 (12 weeks
post-EOT) were stored frozen in 0.5–1.0 mL aliquots at –
80°C at the Institute of Biomedical Research, University
of Birmingham. Where possible, additional blood
(buffer coat) was obtained at visits 1 and 7 for future
DNA extraction and stored at –80°C. Both specimen
storage banks hold a license from the Human Tissue
Authority to store tissue for research purposes.
Treatment compliance
Treatment compliance was monitored by a review of the
used prefilled treatment pens, participant injection sites
and the participant’s self-filled ‘standardised treatment
and clinical events booklet’ at each study visit. The latter
provided written evidence of dosage, time and date
when each patient administered the study drug.
Data handling, quality assurance, record keeping
and retention
Data management was undertaken according to the
standard operating procedures of the CRCTU at the
University of Birmingham, UK. The CRCTU was fully
compliant with the Data Protection Act 1998 and the
International Conference on Harmonisation Good
Clinical Practice (ICH GCP). The CRCTU was responsible for monitoring the trial and providing annual
reports to the MHRA. The trial was registered with the
Data Protection Act website at the University of
Birmingham. Participant identifiable data were shared
only within the clinical team on a need-to-know basis to
provide clinical care, and to ensure good and appropriate follow-up. Patient identifiable data were also shared
with approved auditors from the NRES, competent
authorities (including MHRA, European Medicines
Agency (EMA) and Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)), sponsor (University of Birmingham), NHS R&D
departments and the primary care practitioner. All
LEAN participants provided specific written consent at
trial entry to enable data to be shared with the above.
Otherwise, confidentiality was maintained throughout
the trial and thereafter. On completion of the trial, data
will be transferred to a secure archiving facility at the
University of Birmingham, where data will be held for a
minimum of 10 years and then destroyed.
Case report forms
CRFs included baseline/follow-up medical history and
physical examinations to capture comorbidities and concomitant medications in the trial’s electronic database.
Other CRFs incorporated in the electronic database
included: laboratory tests and questionnaire results were
recorded for visit 1 (eligibility criteria) through to visit
8; safety monitoring during the treatment follow-up
periods; central site histopathology reports of liver
biopsy specimens; specialist non-invasive markers of liver
disease; AE reporting and study drug dispensing forms
for study treatment adherence and accountability.
Sponsorship, indemnity and monitoring
The University of Birmingham acted as the sponsor of
the trial. As sponsor the University was responsible for
the general conduct of the study and indemnified the
trial centre against any claims, arising from any negligent act or omission by the University in fulfilling the
sponsor role in respect to the study. Both on-site and
off-site monitoring of the trial were performed as per
the LEAN Trial Quality Management Plan.
Sources of funding
The trial was funded by the Wellcome Trust (Clinical
Research Fellowship awarded to MJA, 200), Novo
Nordisk Ltd (free study drug supply, educational grant)
and the NIHR liver BRU.

TRIAL STATUS
Recruitment into the LEAN trial started in August 2010
and ended in May 2013, with 52 patients (104% of
target enrolment) randomised from five trial sites
(Birmingham 31; Nottingham 12; Hull 6; Leeds 3;
Southampton 0). This number is 2 more than planned
so as to allow all participants that had registered/consented and found to be eligible to participate in the
trial. Online supplementary figure S2 summarises the
recruitment rate throughout the trial. A total of 73
patients were registered for the trial, 21 (29%) of whom
were not eligible or withdrew consent before randomisation to the trial. Failure to meet the histological inclusion criteria (after central histopathology review) was the
most frequent reason for ineligibility. The treatment
follow-up of LEAN participants is currently ongoing and
the last trial visit of the last participant is due to take
place in July 2014.
DISCUSSION
Compliance with the trial protocol and safety profile of
liraglutide was reviewed on a biannual basis by an independent DMC, and no concerns were raised.
Challenges in trial design
Despite recent advances in non-invasive markers of liver
injury (eg, transient elastography, serum fibrosis
markers), liver biopsy remains the recommended
method for the assessment of disease activity for phase
II/III trials.33 Liver biopsy is not without its limitations
(such as sampling error, invasive nature and patient
reluctance for repeat sampling47), but until the accuracy
of serial measurements of non-invasive markers have
been formally validated, it will be required for trials in
NASH. The LEAN trial has attempted to minimise these
limitations. First, liver biopsies (<6 months of screening)
performed for routine NHS diagnostic purposes were
incorporated into the eligibility criteria and utilised as
the baseline comparator, rather than performing two
biopsies for the sole purpose of the trial. This approach
is widely accepted in trials of NASH. Second, all of the
liver biopsies (baseline, primary endpoint) underwent a
blinded central review by two independent expert liver
histopathologists (RMB and SGH) at the one site, ensuring that only patients with ‘definite’ NASH were
recruited to the trial and reducing intra/interassessor
variability, which has previously been reported between
trial sites.48
In 2011, Sanyal and colleagues (update from AASLD
research workshop, 2009) published expert guidance on
clinical trial design in patients with NASH.33 Even
though the LEAN trial design preceded this workshop,
the definition of NASH and the outcome measures were
in keeping with their recommendations. Patients with
NASH have a higher risk of liver-related mortality than
those with simple hepatic steatosis (± mild inflammation).49 50 Owing to the long time-span of NASH
progression (ie, 10–20 years) to end-stage liver failure/
death it is impractical to perform therapeutic trials with
mortality as the primary outcome measure. Therefore,
we elected to use the disappearance of NASH with no
worsening of fibrosis as ‘surrogate’ primary endpoint in
LEAN. With this in mind, a 48-week treatment duration
was selected, rather than 2–5 years, which would be
required if we were aiming to demonstrate significant
improvements in fibrosis. NAS has been incorporated as
a secondary outcome measure (including the individual
components of NAS) to represent disease activity,31
rather than as the primary outcome as previously
reported.48 51 NAS alone was not originally designed to
infer absence or presence of NASH,52 which we deemed
a more meaningful clinical outcome.
We elected to recruit patients with and without T2D to
enhance recruitment rates and broaden the safety data
in liraglutide in NASH, but under the provision that
patients with diabetes must have moderate glycaemic
control (HbA1c <9%) on diet ± oral hypoglycaemic
medications (with the exception of TZDs and other
potential confounders, ie, GLP-1 based therapy) prior to
trial entry. With the knowledge that diabetes is a potential confounding factor, randomisation was programmed
to stratify for diabetes to ensure equal numbers in each
treatment arm.
The efficient recruitment for clinical trials in NASH
remains a challenge, mainly due to the requirement for
liver biopsy, which has been compounded by the recent
uptake of non-invasive markers (eg, transient elastography) in the UK resulting in a decline in liver biopsy
requests in some recruiting centres.37
Safety profile of liraglutide
Prior to the start of the LEAN trial, the summary of
product characteristics (SmPc) for liraglutide (Victoza)
stated special warnings and precautions for use in moderate/severe renal impairment, moderate/severe congestive heart failure (NHYA class III/IV), pre-existing
thyroid disease and in patients at risk of pancreatitis/
pancreatic carcinoma.53 In turn, the eligibility criteria
(box 1) reflected these warnings by excluding patients
with or at risk of such conditions. In particular, based on
the preclinical incidence of thyroid C-cell tumours in
rodent models and the manufacturer’s ‘black box’
warning in humans,53 all patients with a personal/family
history of thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 and/or abnormal thyroid examination (goiter, nodules) were excluded from the trial. In
addition, serum calcitonin, thyroid function tests and
clinical thyroid examination were monitored throughout
the trial as a precautionary measure.
In keeping with both the US FDA54 and EMA55
recommendations, all patients in LEAN were given written/
verbal advise about the risks and carefully monitored for
signs and symptoms indicative of pancreatitis. In March
2013, a small study (n=8) by Butler et al56 reported pancreatic cellular changes, consistent with pancreatic duct

metaplasia, in organ donors who had received GLP-1
therapy for diabetes prior to death. In response in July
2013, the EMA’s committee of Medicinal Products for
Human Use (CHMP) critically appraised the study and
all other non-clinical/clinical data available, and concluded that the current evidence did not confirm an
increased risk of pancreatic AEs with GLP-1 based therapies.57 Subsequently, the current safety measures
adopted by the LEAN trial will continue until further
information is made available.
Summary
To the best of our knowledge, the LEAN trial is the first
multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCT
designed to investigate whether the long-acting GLP-1
analogue, liraglutide, is safe and improves liver histology
in overweight patients with NASH. The enrolment of
the required sample size was completed in May 2013
and the final results are expected by the end of 2014.
