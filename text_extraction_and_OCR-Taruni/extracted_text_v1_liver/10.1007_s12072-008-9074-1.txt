Abstract Ectopic varices (EcV) comprise large portosystemic venous collaterals located anywhere other than the
gastro-oesophageal region. No large series or randomizedcontrolled trials address this subject, and therefore its management is based on available expertise and facilities, and
may require a multidisciplinary team approach. EcV are
common findings during endoscopy in portal hypertensive
patients and their bleeding accounts for only 1–5% of all
variceal bleeding. EcV develop secondary to portal hypertension (PHT), surgical procedures, anomalies in venous
outflow, or abdominal vascular thrombosis and may be
familial in origin. Bleeding EcV may present with anaemia,
shock, haematemesis, melaena or haematochezia and should
be considered in patients with PHT and gastrointestinal
bleeding or anaemia of obscure origin. EcV may be discovered during panendoscopy, enteroscopy, endoscopic
ultrasound, wireless capsule endoscopy, diagnostic angiography, multislice helical computed tomography, magnetic
resonance angiography, colour Doppler-flow imaging,
laparotomy, laparoscopy and occasionally during autopsy.
Patients with suspected EcV bleeding need immediate
assessment, resuscitation, haemodynamic stabilization and
referral to specialist centres. Management of EcV involves
medical, endoscopic, interventional radiological and surgical modalities depending on patients’ condition, site of
varices, available expertise and patients’ subsequent management plan.

Introduction
The term ‘‘ectopic varices’’ (EcV) describes dilated portosystemic collateral veins located in unusual sites other
than the gastro-oesophageal (G-O) region including the
ectopic isolated gastric varices type 2 (IGV2). This definition has previously been given to any gastrointestinal
mucosa-associated abnormally dilated tortuous veins that
may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, the term

has also been given to any portosystemic collateral veins
located in the abdominal wall or in the retroperitoneal
space.
As no randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) have previously addressed the therapeutic modalities of EcV, most of
the available knowledge about this entity is obtained from
small case series, case reports and mini-reviews. Awareness of the existence and the therapeutic options of EcV is
essential for any physician dealing with patients with
gastrointestinal bleeding. This is crucial not only because
EcV represent up to 5% of all variceal bleeding episodes
[1] but also because of the difficulty in their management
and the high mortality secondary to their initial bleeding
(up to 40%) [2].
Nowadays, EcV are diagnosed more frequently because
of the recent advances in radiological and endoscopic
techniques such as double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) and
video capsule endoscopy (PillCam). Indeed, about 8.1% of
patients with portal hypertension (PHT) who underwent
capsule endoscopy have small-bowel varices [3]. In this
review, we present the currently available knowledge
relating to the sites, types, pathogenesis, diagnosis and
management of EcV.
Sites
Although EcV occur at several sites (Table 1), the bleeding
EcV are most commonly found in the duodenum (Fig. 1),
jejunum, ileum, colon, ano-rectal region (Fig. 2), biliary
tract, umbilicus, peritoneum or at the sites of previous
bowel surgery including stomas (peristomal varices) and
trans-anastomotic porto-portal varices. Other infrequent
sites include the peritoneum, ovary and vagina.
Norton et al. [4] reviewed 169 cases of bleeding from
EcV. Twenty-six of them were peristomal in origin, 17% in
the duodenum, 17% in the jejunum or ileum, 14% in the
colon, 8% in the rectum, 9% in the peritoneum, and few
were located in other rare sites such as the vagina and the
ovary [4]. Another rare site of EcV include the right
diaphragm. On rupture, these varices present with acute
dyspnoea and right-sided bloody pleural effusion [5].
Trans-anastomotic porto-portal varices are rare. They
usually develop in the presence of extrahepatic PHT and
presumably arise within the peri-anastomotic inflammatory
tissue. Such varices may be difficult to manage and their
prognosis is poor if they are bleeding [6].
Prevalence
EcV account for only 1–5% of all variceal bleeding episodes [1, 2, 7]. EcV represent a relatively common finding
during endoscopy in patients with PHT. The prevalence of
EcV varies according to the modality used for their
detection, the patient population studied and the aetiology
of PHT. For example, duodenal varices were detected in
40% of patients with intrahepatic PHT undergoing angiography [7], whereas ano-rectal varices have been reported
in 10–40% of patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing
colonoscopy [8, 9]. Colonic varices were reported in 3.4%
of patients with intrahepatic PHT [10]. In addition, a recent
study of 37 patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent
capsule endoscopy, 3 (8.1%) were found to have smallbowel varices [3].
On upper endoscopy, most patients with duodenal varices have extrahepatic PHT. In fact, most patients with
portal or splenic vein thrombosis on angiography are likely
to show duodenal varices [4, 11–14]. Intestinal varices
have also been reported in a patient with prehepatic PHT
secondary to cavernous malformation of the portal vein
(portal cavernoma) and were associated with oesophageal
varices (OV) [15]. Varices in other parts of the small bowel
(jejunum and ileum) and in the colon are commonly seen in
patients with intrahepatic PHT who have previously
undergone abdominal surgery [11].
Stomal varices, particularly common in patients with
intrahepatic PHT, are caused by primary sclerosing cholangitis [11]. Because of the low prevalence of extrahepatic
PHT in the western countries, most cases of bleeding from
EcV reported in the West are usually associated with
intrahepatic PHT [11, 16]. These varices usually bleed at
hepatic venous pressure gradients of 12 mmHg or less [17].
Similar to gastric varices (GV), a possible explanation for
the lower portal pressure in patients with EcV could be the
development of spontaneous spleno-renal shunts or a
reduced portal collateral resistance [18]. The bleeding can
be massive enough to cause mortality, and the source in
such cases can only be identified at autopsy [19].

Table 2 shows the estimated prevalence of EcV in different studies. To the best of our knowledge, data regarding
the incidence and/or severity of bleeding in each site are
not currently available. A proposed international Webbased EcV registry would be very valuable in this respect.
Aetiology and pathogenesis
As shown in Table 3, EcV may develop secondary to PHT,
including the idiopathic PHT [20], surgical procedures
involving abdominal organs and vessels, anomalies in the
venous outflow vessels, abdominal vascular thrombosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and may be familial in origin
[21]. It has also been reported that duodenal and rectal
varices develop as a result of band ligation of varices in the
oesophago-gastric (OG) junction [22, 23].
Most of EcV represent natural portosystemic shunts that
develop as a result of high portal pressure anywhere in the
gut, around the ovaries, the biliary tree and the bare area of
the liver. Under normal circumstances, such collaterals
remain collapsed. However, in portal hypertensive patients,
the portosystemic collaterals open in a trial to reduce the
increased intrahepatic vascular resistance.
Any surgical operation involving apposition of abdominal structures (drained by the systemic veins) to the bowel
(drained by the portal tributaries) may result in the formation of collateral vessels at an unusual site. An example
is the development of ileostomy varices (stomal varices) in
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who have
undergone colectomy for ulcerative colitis [24]. In addition, bleeding jejunal varices were detected in a case of
severe extrahepatic portal vein stenosis secondary to pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection and
intraoperative radiotherapy [25].
Colonic varices may develop in the absence of PHT
because of the anomalies in portal venous outflow as in
patients with congenital anomalies of portosystemic

anastomoses [26], abnormal vessel structure [27], arteriovenous fistulae [28] or they may be familial in origin [21,
27]. In addition, rectal varices may occur secondary to
intra-abdominal vascular thrombosis [29].
Because tension in the varix wall is proportional to the
radius of the vessel and the transmural pressure across the
vessel wall, the major determinants of rupture of EcV are
mostly vessel size, portal pressure and varix wall tension
[30]. In addition, the prevalence of haemorrhage from
rectal varices was shown to be significantly higher in
patients with rectal varices of advanced form and/or with a
positive ‘‘red-colour’’ sign [31].
Diagnosis
Table 4 provides a list of the recognized presentations of
patients with bleeding EcV. Fortunately, ‘‘luminal EcV’’,
that is, those occurring within the gastrointestinal tract
lumen, are more common, usually easier to detect and
manifest earlier than the ‘‘non-luminal EcV’’, that is, those
elsewhere in the abdominal cavity or the pelvis.
Patients with duodenal varices may present with haematemesis, or massive lower gastrointestinal bleeding [32].
In addition, EcV located distal to the duodenum present
mostly with melaena or haematochezia [33]. Moreover, the
presence of EcV should be considered in all patients with
PHT and gastrointestinal bleeding if both upper and lower
gastrointestinal endoscopies failed to show a definite
source of bleeding.
Many other cases are discovered accidentally, especially
those presenting with anaemia of obscure origin, melaena
or positive faecal occult blood testing. EcV can also be
detected during routine endoscopy, diagnostic transfemoral
or transhepatic angiography [23], Technetium TC-99m red
blood cell scintigraphy [34], video capsule endoscopy [3],
computed tomography (CT) angiography [35], multislice
helical CT [36], CT-enteroclysis [37], contrast-enhanced
3D magnetic resonance angiography [38], endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) [39], laparoscopy or laparotomy
(Table 5). In addition, colour Doppler-flow imaging has
been used to demonstrate gallbladder varices in three cases
of extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EPVO) and
obstructive jaundice [40]. Occasionally, the presence of
EcV can be confirmed only at autopsy [41]. It should be
noted that EcV can appear as filling defects in barium
studies of the colon or small bowel and may be misdiagnosed as polyps or tumours [21]. This emphasizes the
importance of endoscopic and angiographic modalities.

Varices in the abdominal wall usually rupture externally
and can easily be diagnosed, whereas those located around
the falciform ligament of the liver, in the diaphragm, in the
rectovesical region, or on the splenic ligament may rupture
into the peritoneal cavity causing internal bleeding and can
be fatal [42, 43]. Diagnosis of cases with internal bleeding
needs a high index of clinical suspicion and often presents
with rapid accumulation of ascites associated with signs of
hypovolaemic shock and a reduction in the haematocrit
value. The diagnosis is further indicated by CT scan, which
detects retroperitoneal varices and intra-abdominal bleeding or collections, and can be confirmed by the detection of
a heavily bloodstained ascitic fluid tap.
Various techniques can be used to reveal the extent of
portosystemic collaterals, the direction of flow and the
pressure in the portal venous system. These include splenic
portography, umbilical vein catheterization, percutaneous
transhepatic portography and transjugular transhepatic
portography at the time of or after transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion [44–46]. The last
three modalities allow direct and selective access to the
main tributaries of the portal vein, including the coronaryazygous collaterals, which represent a dominant mechanism in patients with PHT [47].
Role of capsule endoscopy (PillCam)
About 8.1% of patients with PHT who have undergone
capsule endoscopy have small-bowel varices [3]. This
number reflects a prevalence that is generally higher than
expected and points to the role of capsule endoscopy as a
non-invasive tool in the workup of patients with obscure
gastrointestinal bleeding, including those with chronic liver
diseases. Also, a case report by Fix et al. [48] has shown
the significance of PillCam in diagnosing obscure gastrointestinal bleeding from mesenteric varices. It has also
been found to be beneficial in detecting small-bowel
varices in a patient after Whipple’s operation [49]. Furthermore, PillCam as an alternative to upper endoscopy has
been tested in 32 patients with liver cirrhosis for the
detection of OG varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy [50]. In one patient, PillCam detected small varices that
were not seen at endoscopy, and the overall concordance
between both modalities was 96.9 and 90.6% for the
diagnosis of varices and gastropathy, respectively, without
any adverse effects related to PillCam [50]. A large-scale
trial is underway to validate and expand these findings.
Role of DBE
At ileocolonoscopy, 18% of patients with liver cirrhosis
and PHT have ileal varices [51]. DBE has the potential to
visualize the whole small bowel, take biopsy specimens,
and perform all necessary endoscopic interventions [52].
Hekmat et al. [53] have recently demonstrated a successful
obliteration of a jejunal varix by using N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl) in a lesion found *240 cm from the
ligament of Treitz. This signifies the therapeutic benefit of
DBE over capsule endoscopy in small-bowel EcV. The
widespread use of this modality in the future would help
detect such varices and allow therapeutic intervention, and
hence reduce rebleeding, transfusions, and may be
mortality.
Management of bleeding EcV
The management of EcV is difficult and may require a
multidisciplinary team of endoscopists, hepatologists, surgeons and interventional radiologists (Table 6). It is very
difficult to draw guidelines for the treatment of EcV
because of the diversity of their location, presentation,
complications and diagnostic and therapeutic options.
However, the optimal therapeutic modality depends mainly
on the location of varices, patient’s condition, the locally
available expertise and facilities, and the cause of PHT.
Management essentially includes prompt resuscitation,
immediate workup to localize the site/source of bleeding,
followed by application of the suitable treatment modality
or immediate transfer to tertiary referral centres. A proposed systematic approach for any patient presenting with
bleeding from possible EcV is shown in Fig. 3.

Initial management
Similar to acute OG variceal bleeding, clinical assessment,
resuscitation, haemodynamic stabilization, antibiotic prophylaxis and referral to specialist centres should be started
as soon as possible in patients with suspected EcV bleeding.
The use of vasoactive drugs such as octreotide and terlipressin to reduce splanchnic blood flow and variceal
pressure may be of benefit as in patients with bleeding from
OG varices [54, 55]. The role of these vasoactive drugs in
the control of bleeding from EcV has not been addressed.
All subjects with suspected variceal bleeding should
undergo emergency upper endoscopy as a first-line investigation. If it fails to show the source of upper
gastrointestinal bleeding, colonoscopy after a rapid colonic
purge (3 litres of polyethylene glycol solution delivered via
a nasogastric tube) should be the second step of investigation because in a series of 22% of French patients with
EcV, bleeding was reported from the colon or rectum [8].
Colonic and rectal varices appear as serpiginous, dilated
bluish vessels projecting into the lumen. However, if
panendoscopy fails to identify and localize a variceal or a
non-variceal source of bleeding, capsule endoscopy, DBE,
transfemoral angiography or TC-99m red blood cell scintigraphy or other modalities, as mentioned above, would be
the third step of the investigation.
Endoscopic treatment
The use of endoscopic modalities has been reported both in
the setting of controlling acute bleeding from EcV and in
the secondary prophylaxis. Therefore, depending on the
currently available data, primary prophylaxis of EcV
bleeding should not be recommended.
Band ligation
Only a few reports are available regarding the successful
use of band ligation of EcV mainly in the rectum and
duodenum [56–60]. It has also been reported that band
ligation, together with balloon-occluded retrograde
transvenous obliteration (B-RTO), is beneficial in the
management of bleeding duodenal varices [59]. However, if
the entire varix cannot be banded, there might be a high risk
of developing a wide defect in the varix, especially after
sloughing, rendering the banding technique unsafe for large
EcV. It has been recommended that banding can be done
only if the varix diameter does not exceed the diameter of
the endoscope [4].
Injection sclerotherapy
Most EcV are within reach of standard endoscopy [11] or
DBE [54]. Several studies have reported successful treatment of duodenal and rectal varices with sclerosant
injection [61, 62]. The response to injection sclerotherapy
can be unsatisfactory, especially with rectal and colonic
varices, probably due to excessive dilution of the sclerosant
in large varices beyond a concentration adequate to obliterate the varix. Therefore, a combination of sclerotherapy
with banding in such a situation can be attempted [63].
Also, successful control of bleeding from duodenal, jejunal,
colonic and rectal varices after injecting with cyanoacrylate, thrombin or any other combination of sclerosants has
also been reported [53, 64–67].

recurring oesophageal variceal after band ligation has been
shown to be both effective and safe, and better than band
ligation alone [68–70]. APC of EcV has been reported to be
effective in stopping bleeding and eradicating ileocolonic
anastomotic varices in a 65-year-old male patient [71]. The
use of APC in preventing recurrence of endoscopically
accessible EcV should be tested in more patients after
initial eradication with other modalities such as band
ligation or sclerotherapy.
Embolization therapy
Embolization, via intervention radiological techniques, of
steel coils, thrombin, gel foam, collagen or autologous
blood clot [72], either alone or in combination with band
ligation or TIPS, is an effective short-term therapy for
bleeding OG varices. The goal of this therapy is not to
occlude the bleeding site itself but to occlude the feeding
vein (i.e., the vein on the portal venous side) to the EcV.
Steel coils are the preferred embolic materials because they
lead to a permanent focal occlusion and are available in a
variety of sizes, and allow occlusion of large veins without
difficulty. The rate of bleeding control has been reported to
reach 94% [73, 74]. Unfortunately, embolization does not
decompress the portal venous system, resulting in high
1-year rebleeding rates [73]. The feeding veins can be
reached via percutaneous transhepatic or transjugular routes.
Percutaneous embolization of bleeding EcV has been
reported in the literature as case reports or case series [75–
78]. The transhepatic approach is usually preferred, especially in patients with active bleeding, because access to
the portal venous system is faster than the transjugular
approach. On the other hand, the transhepatic approach
may be difficult in patients with portal vein occlusion, but
is usually preferred if a subsequent TIPS is planned after
variceal embolization [79–81]. Macedo et al. presented a
retrospective review of 14 patients, 12 of whom had an
abdominal surgery 2–38 years earlier, who underwent
transhepatic embolization of coils into the draining veins
for the management of bleeding EcV. Rebleeding occurred
within 72 h in two patients, and recurrent bleeding from
23 days to 27 months after initial intervention was identified in nine patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that
percutaneous coil embolization is a simple and safe treatment for bleeding EcV; however, recurrent bleeding is
frequent and repeated intervention is often required. TIPS
usually offers good control of bleeding at the expense of a
more complex procedure and increased risk of encephalopathy [72]. Okasaki et al. [82] have recently reported a
case of obliteration of bleeding giant rectal varices with the
use of modified percutaneous transhepatic obliteration with
sclerosant.
Medical treatment
The role of b-blockers in the primary and secondary
prophylaxis of bleeding from OG varices is well established. However, no solid data exist regarding the use of
b-blockers or nitrates in the long-term management of
patients with EcV. Although an earlier study in 1986 had
shown that b-blocker therapy was not effective in the
management of peristomal varices [22], a recent report of
three cases had shown their effectiveness [83]. Another
case report suggests that b-blockers can be effective as
secondary prophylaxis of duodenal variceal rebleeding,
especially after simple oversewing of duodenal variceal
veins [84]. It seems logical that this modality could be tried
in patients with EcV, especially after the implementation of
emergency endoscopic or surgical modalities or when
patients cannot undergo a surgical shunt [85].
Surgical treatment
If endoscopic modalities or interventional embolization fail
to control bleeding from EcV, creating a TIPS or proceeding
with surgery is the optimal option depending on the availability of expertise, liver function and the cause of PHT.
Direct surgery or local devascularization of the EcV is a
useful minimally invasive procedure that does not take much
time, does not involve resection of long segments of the
small intestine and can be done even if the portal vein is not
patent or if the patient has Child B or C cirrhosis [84, 86].
Surgery is preferred both in patients with Child-Pugh
class A cirrhosis and in patients with an EPVO. Other
surgical interventions reported to control EcV include
simple oversewing of the duodenal varices through a
duodenotomy [87], duodenal dearterialization and stapling
[79], circumferential-stapled anoplasty [88] and double
selective shunting [89].
The non-selective portosystemic shunts, such as mesocaval, portocaval or central splenorenal shunt, adequately
decompress the portal circulation, but because they are
considered major surgical procedures, they are not
commonly used nowadays. Also, non-conventional portosystemic shunts using large collateral vessels may be
performed in patients with EPVO, for example, children
with extensive thrombosis of the portal venous system [90].
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
Many recent publications have addressed the role of TIPS
in the successful control of bleeding EcV caused by
intrahepatic PHT unresponsive to conservative or endoscopic management [17, 40, 91–102]. The largest four
328 Hepatol Int (2008) 2:322–334
123

series involved 12, 9, 24 and 21 patients who received
TIPS for bleeding EcV [40, 100, 101, 103]. Although TIPS
offers a highly effective modality for controlling bleed, the
long-term survival of patients is mainly dependent on their
liver function. The high efficacy of TIPS has to be balanced
against the potential for increased encephalopathy and the
procedure-related morbidity.
TIPS together with variceal embolization has the
advantage of being effective, minimally invasive, can be
performed in one session, does not preclude subsequent
liver transplantation, and therefore may be used during the
acute situation both as a bridge to transplantation and as the
definitive therapy in patients unfit for surgery.
Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration
B-RTO is a recent therapeutic technique for the management of patients with large GV. The technique is valuable in
patients who bleed at lower portal pressures, patients with
hepatic encephalopathy, and when the portal vein is not
patent. Recently, B-RTO—alone or in combination with
transiliocolic obliteration of vein—has also been shown to
be effective in controlling bleeding of duodenal varices that
failed endoscopic therapy in poor surgical candidates,
without complications or recurrence for a period of up to
3 years [104–108]. However, its use is currently limited
because of its low availability and lack of technical expertise, and caution is required in patients with large OV. Most
of the available literature addressing this method originates
from the Far East, mainly Japan, and the early results are
promising. B-RTO might be a difficult procedure, but it
works well if the doctors are familiar with the procedure.
Special types of EcV
Intra-abdominal varices
Varices in the abdominal wall usually rupture externally
and therefore are easily recognized and treated with local
compression and surgical ligation. Many cases of veins
around the falciform ligament of the liver that rupture into
the peritoneal cavity have been reported and are characterized by a rapid increase in ascites, particularly in the
presence of abdominal pain, and associated with a decrease
in the haematocrit value. Management of this situation is
difficult because transhepatic obliteration of the varices is
relatively contraindicated because of the accompanying
ascites. Other modes of therapy include transjugular,
intrahepatic embolization of the portal venous system,
TIPS placement, and emergency surgical ligation of the
bleeding varix, but this results in high mortality [109].
Stomal varices
The term ‘‘ectopic stomal varices’’ refers to abnormally
dilated veins that have developed in the stomal mucosa.
Stomal varices are commonly seen in patients with ileostomies after proctocolectomy for inflammatory bowel
disease associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis and
PHT [24]. Stomal varices are recognized by the purplish
hue around the stoma. As the patient is usually aware of the
bleed early in the clinical course, he or she may be taught
how to control the bleeding with pressure. Therefore,
mortality from bleeding stomal varices is relatively low (3–
4%) [92]. A case report from Korea described the use of 2D
reformatted and 3D volume rendered images by multidimensional-CT in a patient with an episode of acute
bleeding from the colonic stoma [110]. Local measures,
such as epinephrine-soaked gauze, pressure dressings,
suture ligation, gel foam or refashioning the stoma, have all
been applied successfully in controlling the initial bleeding
episode [93, 111]. Injection sclerotherapy has also been
tried, but it may cause mucosal ulceration, stomal orifice
stricture and peristomal skin necrosis [112]. In patients
with uncontrolled or recurrent bleeding, a portosystemic
procedure should be contemplated. TIPS—alone on in
combination with embolization therapy—is preferred to a
surgical portosystemic shunt because patients with stomal
varices may be candidates for liver transplantation [111,
113–116].
Biliary tract varices
The development of biliary tract varices is a rare complication of PHT and sometimes is referred to as
‘‘pseudocholangiocarcinoma’’ or ‘‘pseudosclerosing cholangitis’’ or ‘‘portal hypertensive bilopathy’’. In a series of
42 patients with EPVO, gallbladder varices were detected
by Doppler ultrasonography in 11 patients and choledochal
varices in 9 patients [117]. Another study showed varices
around the gallbladder and/or the biliary channels in 30%
of patients [118]. Biliary varices are usually asymptomatic,
often discovered accidentally, in the absence of other signs
of PHT [119], but can lead to silent fatal outcomes [120].
Occurrence of varices around the common bile duct can
result in extrahepatic biliary obstruction, cholangitis and
haemobilia. The appearances of a biliary tree on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may mimic
those of primary sclerosing cholangitis [121]. Also, EUS
can serve to diagnose biliary varices in patients with EPVO
and jaundice. Although biliary varices are mainly asymptomatic, they may cause obstructive jaundice when they are
located in the wall of the common bile duct. EUS can also
detect unrecognized malignant tumours in patients with
EPVO of undetermined origin [39]. Smith et al. [122]
Hepatol Int (2008) 2:322–334 329
123

reported a case of severe gastrointestinal bleeding due to
jejunal-biliary anastomotic varices. The anastomotic site
was the location of the pressure gradient, from the highpressure small-bowel varices to the low-pressure biliary
tract. This was successfully treated by disconnection of the
anastomosis and bile duct repair. Therapeutic modalities of
biliary varices include surgical portosystemic shunt and
endoscopic, radiological or even surgical biliary drainage
procedures.
Ano-rectal varices
The misdiagnosis of ano-rectal varices as haemorrhoids
can sometimes have devastating consequences. Therefore,
it is important to differentiate anal varices from haemorrhoids. The former collapse with digital pressure, whereas
the latter do not. Rectal varices are enlarged portosystemic
collateral veins, which develop in patients with PHT as a
pathway for portal venous blood flow from the superior
haemorrhoidal veins (portal) to and through the middle and
inferior haemorrhoidal veins (systemic). Massive bleeding
from ano-rectal varices has been reported, but such reports
are infrequent [123–125]. On the other hand, haemorrhoids
represent a common cause of rectal bleeding, but their
prevalence in patients with PHT is not higher than the
general population [126]. Weinshel et al. [127] have published an excellent review of the differentiation,
pathogenesis and management of these two entities.
Ectopic IGV type 2
GV may be primary or secondary in origin. The former
refers to those varices that are present at the initial endoscopic examination in a patient who never underwent
variceal sclerotherapy or band ligation for OV, whereas the
latter refers to GV that develop after endoscopic therapy
for OV. Many classification systems have been proposed
for GV on the basis of their location, size, colour, form and
relation to OV. However, the most widely used classification system is that proposed by Sarin et al. [128, 129]
and recommended by the Baveno III consensus working
group [130], and categorizes GV on the basis of their
location in the stomach and their relationship with OV
(Table 7).
IGV2 are present either in the body or on the antrum of
the stomach or upper duodenum. Sarin et al. [131] have
described the prevalence, natural history and clinical significance of these varices in a prospective study involving
1,128 patients with PHT. Of these patients, 53 (4.7%) had
IGV2. These IGV2 were predominantly (84.9%) secondary
in origin and located in the antrum (53%), duodenum
(32%) or at both sites (11%), and rarely in the corpus or
fundus (4%). Bleeding due to IGV2 was seen only in three
(5.7%) patients during a mean follow-up of
36.3 ± 12.1 months and could be successfully managed
with endoscopic ligation or obliteration [131].
Recommended future research
Because of the low incidence of EcV and the lack of valid
reproduced RCTs addressing this complication, we recommend the establishment of an international Web-based
EcV case registry through which a more precise epidemiologic, diagnostic, prognostic, prophylactic and therapeutic
data can be obtained. Major referral centres should be
encouraged to participate and register their cases and
subsequently be involved in multicentre RCTs concentrating on the management of such patients. Also,
comparative haemodynamic studies between patients with
G-O varices and those with EcV are warranted.
Concluding remarks
• Most of the available data about EcV are obtained from
case reports or short series of cases.
• EcV are being recognized more frequently nowadays
because of the continuous advances in the endoscopic
and imaging techniques.
• Ectopic variceal bleeding is reported in patients with
internal haemorrhage, hypovolaemic shock, occult
gastrointestinal bleeding, anaemia or bleeding from
the gut of obscure origin, especially in patients with
PHT, following abdominal surgical procedures, in cases

with extrahepatic venous obstruction or thrombosis, or
anomalies of the portal venous system.
• It is difficult to recommend general guidelines for the
management of EcV and each case should be dealt with
depending on the site and severity of bleeding and
according to available expertise and facilities.
• Patients with EcV bleeding must be considered difficult, should be managed in specialized canters, and
have to be approached with a multidisciplinary team
involving intensivists, gastroenterologists, surgeons and
interventional radiologists.
