Abstract
Background: The effects of vegetable preference and leisure-time physical activity (LPA) on cancer have
been inconsistent. We examined the effects of dietary preference and physical activity, as well as their
combined effect on cancer risk.
Methods: This prospective cohort study included 444,963 men, older than 40 years, who participated in
a national health examination program begun in 1996. Based on the answer to the question "What kind of
dietary preference do you have?" we categorized dietary preference as (1) vegetables, (2) mixture of
vegetables and meat, and (3) meats. We categorized LPA as low (< 4 times/wk, < 30 min/session),
moderate (2–4 times/wk, ≥ 30 min/session or ≥ 5 times/wk, < 30 min/session), or high (≥ 5 times/wk, ≥
30 min/session). We obtained cancer incidence data for 1996 through 2002 from the Korean Central
Cancer Registry. We used a standard Poisson regression model with a log link function and person-time
offset to estimate incidence and relative risk..
Results: During the 6-year follow-up period, we identified 14,109 cancer cases. Multivariate analysis
revealed that a preference for vegetables or a mixture of vegetables and meat as opposed to a preference
for meat played a significant protective role against lung cancer incidence (aRR, 0.81; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.68–0.98). Compared with the low LPA group, subjects with moderate-high LPA had a
significantly lower risk for stomach (aRR, 0.91; 95%CI, 0.86–0.98), lung (aRR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.75–0.92), and
liver (aRR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.81–0.95) cancer. Among current smokers, the combined moderate-high LPA
and vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat preference group showed a 40% reduced risk of lung
cancer (aRR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.47–0.76) compared with the combined low LPA and meat preference group.
Among never/former smokers, subjects with moderate-high LPA and a preference for vegetables or a
mixture of vegetables and meat showed reduced stomach cancer risk (aRR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.54–0.95).
Conclusion: Our findings add to the evidence of the beneficial effects of vegetable preference on lung
cancer risk and of physical activity on lung, stomach, and liver cancer risk. Additionally, vegetable
preference combined with LPA might significantly reduce lung and stomach cancer risk.

Background
Many studies have investigated the protective effect of vegetable consumption against specific cancers, especially
colon,[1,2] prostate,[3] pancreas,[4] bladder,[5]
lung,[1,6-8] and stomach cancer.[1,9] Moderate-high levels of physical activity (PA) may also have a protective
effect, specifically against breast,[10] colon,[2] prostate,[11] and lung cancer.[12]
Previous studies have suggested that PA may have beneficial impact on reducing the sex hormones or insulin resistance and improving immune system, maintaining a
healthy body weight by balancing caloric intake with
energy expenditure, which could lead to cancer prevention.[13] Vegetables and fruits are known to contain
numerous potentially beneficial anti-oxidants, fibers,
minerals, and phytochemicals that may help prevent cancer and contribute to maintenance of a healthy
weight.[14]
Recently, American Cancer Society (ACS) has released the
recommendation of PA and nutrition for cancer prevention. Their recommendation is "at least 30 minutes or
more of moderate to vigorous activity, above usual activities, on 5 or more days of the week" and "eating five or
more serving of vegetables and fruits each day".[15]
However, findings of the protective effects of vegetable
diet and physical activity on cancer risk from numerous
epidemiological studies have been inconsistent[3,6] and
only few studies distinguished the effect of vegetables and
fruits.[1,8] Moreover, most studies did not simultaneously evaluate the combination effect of diet and physical
activity to cancer risk. As dietary intake and physical activity, like tobacco use, are cancer risk factors that can probably be modified through lifestyle changes.[15] The
relationship of diet and PA to other cancer risk factors,
such as smoking, alcohol, body mass index (BMI), and
glucose intolerance, should be considered in attempts to
identify the effect of diet and PA on cancer risk.
In this study we evaluated the effects of dietary preference
and PA, as well as their combined effect on cancer incidence in a large, population-based Korean male cohort,
adjusting for other known risk factors.
Methods
Study Population
The National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC) has
provided biannual health examinations which was obligatory by law to government employees and private school
faculty members and their dependants. The study subjects
derived to the end of 2002, the National Health Insurance
Corporation Study (NHICS) in Korea enrolled 1,216,041
(901,979 male) older than 20 years who participated in a
national health examination program in 1996.[16] From
the cohort, we enrolled 454,691 men older than 40 years,
excluding those who already had cancer. We excluded
women because the number with cancer was too small for
analysis. Finally, 444,963 men who provided complete
information on dietary preferences and leisure-time physical activity were left for analysis.
Data Collection
The NHIC biannual examinations, conducted by medical
staff at local hospitals, follow a standardized procedure.
The items for test were height, weight, and blood pressure
measurements, chest radiography, and urinalysis. Blood
sample were also obtained under fasting conditions for
blood cell counts and chemistries including serum glucose measurement. Each hospital had internal and external quality control procedures direct by the Korean
Association of Laboratory Quality Control. In addition,
the full self-administered questionnaires included information regarding medical history, current health status,
employment, family history, tobacco and alcohol consumption, dietary preferences, and leisure-time physical
activity (LPA). The questionnaire was designed by NHIC
and reviewed for reliability, validity, and eligibility by an
expert committee, and is regulated by Korean Health Promotion law. Smoking status was classified as current,
former, or never smoker on the basis of the response to
the following questions: "do you smoke cigarettes now?"
When we classified the employment status, white collar
included managers, professionals and teachers, and blue
collar included skilled workers, service workers, plant and
machine operators and elementary occupations.
The incident cancer cases were identified from the Korean
Central Cancer Registry data along with the time of diagnosis and type of cancer. As this study involved routinely
collected medical data, participant consent was not
required. The study was approved by the institutional
review boards of the National Cancer Center. The details
of the cohort study outcome measures were previously
reported.[16]
Classification of Dietary Preference and LeisuretimePhysical Activity
The information on dietary preference and LPA came
from checked-off responses to the initial questionnaire.
Based on the answer to "What kind of dietary preference
do you have?" we categorized dietary preference as (1)
vegetables, (2) mixture of vegetables and meat, and (3)
meats. For evaluation of the effects of dietary preference
on cancer risk, we reduced the levels to 2 – vegetables or
mixture of vegetables and meat, and meat [17]
LPA frequency for vigorous intensity and duration was
based on the answers to, "How many times per week do

BMC Cancer 2008, 8:366 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/366

you have vigorous, sweat-producing LPA?" and "How
long do you have vigorous, sweat-producing LPA per session?" For LPA frequency, the answer was categorized as
(1) none, (2) 1–2 times/wk, (3) 3–4 times/wk, (4) 5–6
times/wk, or (5) every day. For duration of LPA, the
answer was categorized as (1) < 30 min/session, (2) 30
min-1 hr/session, (3) 1–2 hr/session, or (4) ≥ 2 hr/session. We classified LPA by combining frequency and duration with vigorous, sweat-producing LPA and the basic
ACS concepts as (1) low, ≤ 4 times/wk at < 30 min/session, (2) moderate, 2–4 times/week at ≥ 30 min/session
or ≥ 5 times/wk at < 30 min/session, and (3) high, ≥ 5
times/wk at ≥ 30 min/session. For evaluation of the effect
of LPA on cancer risk, we reduced the levels of LPA to 2 –
low and moderate-high.[15]
When we combined these two health behaviors and evaluated the risk of cancer incidence, we found no difference
between the group that had moderate-high LPA and preferred meat and the group that had low LPA and preferred
vegetables or a mixture of vegetables and meat. Therefore,
for evaluation of combination levels, we used only 3 subgroup categories: (1) least favorable lifestyle: low LPA
with meat preference, (2) moderate lifestyle: moderatehigh LPA with meat preference or low LPA with vegetable
or mixture of vegetables and meat preference, and (3)
optimal lifestyle: moderate-high LPA with vegetable or
mixture of vegetables and meat preference.
Statistical Methods
We calculated the person-years at risk for each subject
from the date of enrollment to the date of cancer diagnosis or December 31, 2002, whichever came first. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 personyears for each cancer site according to dietary preference
and LPA. We estimated the adjusted relative risk (aRR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting first for age
at enrollment. For multivariate analyses, we adjusted socioeconomic variables such as age and employment (white,
blue collar) and the following variables, which are known
cancer risk factors: smoking status (current, former, or
never smoker), absolute alcohol consumption (< 51.8,
51.8–124.1, 124.2–289.7, ≤ 289.8 g/week), BMI in kg/m2
(< 25, 25–30, ≥ 30), fasting glucose level in mg/dL (< 110,
110–125, ≥ 126), and dietary preference and LPA, as
appropriate. We used a standard Poisson regression
model, which is suitable for estimating the rate of rare diseases such as cancer, with a log link function and persontime offset to estimate incidence and relative risk.
All statistical tests were two sided and performed with SAS
statistical package version 8.1.
Results
Baseline characteristics
The mean age of the subjects was 49.0 years (SD, 6.5).
During the 6-year follow-up period of 3,124,596.7 person-years, we identified 14,109 cancer cases, including
multiple primary cancers.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the subjects.
More subjects with meat preference or low LPA were current smokers, high drinkers, or white collar workers than
those with a vegetable or mixed preference or moderatehigh LPA. Obese cases, however, were more prevalent in
the moderate-high LPA group and the meat preference
group.
Dietary preference, LPA and cancer risk
We found a significant protective relationship between
vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat preference
and incidence of all cancers combined (RR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.86–0.99) and of lung cancer (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–
0.91) in the age-adjusted model. In multivariate analysis,
these protective relationships were attenuated slightly but
remained statistically significant for lung cancer (RR, 0.81;
95% CI, 0.68–0.98) (Table 2).
As with the age-adjusted model, multivariate analysis
showed that subjects with moderate-high LPA had a significantly lower risk for all cancers combined (RR, 0.91;
95% CI, 0.88–0.95) and for stomach (RR, 0.91; 95% CI,
0.86–0.98), lung (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.92), and liver
(RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81–0.95) cancer (Table 2).
Dietary preference and cancer risk by smoking status
We found a significant protective association between
vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat preference
and risk for lung cancer only in current smokers after
adjusting for age (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93) and for
other potential confounders (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–
0.95) (Table 3).
LPA and cancer risk by smoking status
In the analysis of the effect of LPA on cancer risk by smoking status, moderate-high LPA was associated with
approximately a 10% reduction in risk of all cancers combined in both never/former and current smokers (Table
4). In the age-adjusted model, current smokers with moderate-high LPA had a significantly lower risk of lung (RR,
0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.91) and liver (RR, 0.89; 95% CI,
0.81–0.99) cancer, while never/former smokers with
moderate-high LPA showed a significant decrease in stomach (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98) and liver (RR, 0.82;
95% CI, 0.72–0.93) cancer risk. These associations were
attenuated slightly in multivariate analysis but still
remained statistically significant.

Combination effect of dietary preference and LPA on 
cancer risk
Compared with the least favorable lifestyle group, the
optimal lifestyle group showed additive effect as a significantly lower incidence of all cancers combined and lung
cancer in both age-adjusted (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46–
0.71) and multivariate-adjusted (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.51–
0.79) analysis (Table 5). Similarly, the middle group had
significantly lower lung cancer risk in both age-adjusted
(RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56–0.86) and multivariate analysis
(RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.91) (Table 5). When we
divided the subjects by smoking status, for current smokers, the combined effect of moderate-high LPA and vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat preference on
cancer prevention still remained in all cancers combined
and in lung cancer. The same was true for the middle
group. Interestingly, for never/former smokers, subjects
with moderate-high LPA and vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat preference showed reduced stomach
cancer risk in both age-adjusted analysis (RR, 0.71; 95%
CI, 0.54–0.94) and multivariate analysis (RR, 0.72; 95%
CI, 0.54–0.95).
Discussion
We analyzed the relationship between dietary preference
and LPA and the incidence of major cancers among men
older than 40 years from the National Health Insurance
Corporation Study with a follow-up period of
3,124,596.7 person-years. Of these, 14,109 cases had
been diagnosed with at least one primary cancer. This is
one of the largest cohort studies to examine such associations and the first to examine the combined protective
effects of diet preference and LPA on cancers, including
lung, stomach, and liver cancer. We adjusted for age,
smoking, and BMI and added job, fasting serum glucose
level, and absolute alcohol consumption for multivariate
analysis.
Our study showed that vegetables preference was
inversely associated with lung cancer risk and that LPA
was protective against stomach, lung, and liver cancer. To
our knowledge, this is the first prospective cohort study
suggesting that moderate to high LPA might be associated
with a lower risk of stomach cancer. Our findings also suggested that the combination of both behaviors (vegetable
preference and LPA) was more protective, especially
against stomach cancer among never/past smokers and
lung cancer among current smokers.
Lung cancer was the second common cancer for men in
Korea. [18] Although the major risk factor for lung cancer
is tobacco smoking, diet and physical activity [10,12] can
modify the risk. While some cohort studies found a clear
inverse association between vegetable intake and the risk
of lung cancer in men,[8] others showed little or no association.[6,7] In some studies, a reduced lung cancer risk
was associated not with intake of vegetables, but with
intake of fruits.[7] Here we showed that vegetable preference was inversely associated with the risk of lung cancer,
especially among current smokers, which is in agreement
with other studies,[7,8] but not among former or never
smokers in multivariate analysis. The Netherlands Cohort
Study also found no significant protective effect of vegetables in never smokers.[8]
Our finding that more regular and intense LPA helped
prevent lung cancer, especially among current smokers, is
consistent with other studies suggesting that physically
active individuals have a lower risk of lung cancer.[3,12]
Interestingly, the combination group of both positive
behaviors showed an additive effect in current smokers to

ular and intense LPA could be employed together with
smoking cessation to reduce the risk of lung cancer.
We found that physically active men, compared with inactive men, had a modest reduction in the risk of developing
stomach cancer which is most common cancer in Korean
men.[18] This protective effect was found in never/past
smokers but not in current smoker. Little information
exists on the relationship between physical activity and
risk of stomach cancer, and our results are inconsistent
with the findings of a case-control study in which stomach
cancer was not associated with the Total Activity
Index.[19]

cer,[20] several studies suggest that the consumption of
vegetables or miso soup is significantly associated with an
increased risk of liver cancer.[20] While vegetable preference was not associated with liver cancer risk in our study,
moderate or high LPA reduced the risk slightly (RR = 0.88,
95% CI: 0.81–0.95). The protective effect of LPA against
liver cancer did not seem to depend on smoking status,
even if it was not significant in current smoker. We cannot
exclude the possibility of a confounding effect for chronic
liver disease, i.e., that subjects with chronic liver disease, a
risk of liver cancer, reduced their PA. We had no data on
infection status of hepatitis virus. However, this is the first

prospective study to report that physical activity may
reduce liver cancer risk, suggesting that further study is
called for.
In our study, there was no significant association between
low LPA or meat preference and colorectal cancer risk.
ACS recommends increasing PA and vegetables intake for
the colorectal cancer prevention,[15] however, this guideline depended on only two studies.[21,22] Although several studies[1,2,22] also supported a significant reduction
in the risk of colon cancer associated with vegetable consumption and PA but it was not consistent.[3,17] Furthermore, recent large prospective cohort studies do not
support the hypothesis that PA or vegetables intake is
related to a lower incidence of colon cancer.[2] The heterogeneous results may come from the difference of study
design or confounding factors.[1] Although our study has
the advantage that other important cancer risk factors,
such as smoking, alcohol, BMI, and glucose intolerance
were considered in the analysis, the occupational physical
activity (OPA) total caloric or specific nutritional intake
were not collected.
Until now, especially for PA, there is no definited the cutoff level in guideline to prevent the cancer incidence.[15,24] Our classifcation of moderate-high LPA
based on frequency and duration of sweat- producing
intensity is arbitrary and is different from frequency and
duration of LPA recommended in the ACS or World
Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on physical activity for cancer prevention.[15,24] When We inferred the
intensity of PA from this questionnaire based on the British Columbia physical activity guidelines, one of selfgauging rating factors of intense LPA was "sweat-producing" and "vigorous, sweat-producing LPA" could include
the type of LPA such as jogging (7 Metabolic Equivalence
Task (MET) per hour(hr)) and so on.[25] With the
assumption that "vigorous, sweat-producing LPA" was 7
MET/hr, we could calculated the MET-hr/wk of our LPA
category as follow: low LPA, < 10.5 MET-hr/wk; moderate
LPA, 10.5–17.5 MET-hr/wk; and high LPA, ≥ 17.5 METhr/wk. Recent studies have shown that high physical activity at least 18 MET-hr/wk, which was similar to the category of high LPA in our study, was associated with
decrease in colon cancer recurrence and mortality.[26]
Another study also suggested that physical activity at least
9 MET-hour/week, which was similar to the category of
moderate LPA, might lower the risk of death in breast cancer patients.[27] However, these studies focused on the
survival benefit of PA in cancer patients, and further welldesigned studies was needed to clarify the cut-off level of
PA to prevent the cancer incidence.
Although our study showed that moderate LPA is significantly related with reducing the risk of lung, stomach and
liver cancer, higher level of PA could be required to reduce
the colorectal cancer risk, as the level of PA to show the
survival benefit in colorectal cancer patients[26] was
higher than that of breast cancer patients.[27] However,
the proportion of subjects with high LPA (≥ 17.5 MET-hr/
wk) was few, and the colon cancer incidence of Korea very
lower than that of US,[18] which could lead to dilute the
real associations. Continued monitoring and long-term
follow-up study of our cohort is needed to clarify these
associations.
Data on the role of vegetable intake and physical activity
in preventing other cancers (e.g., head and neck, pancreas,
gall bladder, kidney, and bladder cancer) are limited.[1]
Vegetable consumption was not associated with a lowered
risk of head and neck cancer in this study, regardless of
smoking status. Many case-control studies suggest that
fruit, but not vegetables, have a significant protective
effect against head and neck cancer.[1,28] In our study,
LPA was not significantly associated with a lower risk of
head and neck cancer in current smoker. The combination
of both behaviors showed similar results. Comparison
with other findings is limited by the absence of prospective studies of both behaviors on the risk of head and neck
cancer, and the association warrants further investigation.[1]While neither vegetable preference nor LPA was
associated with gall bladder cancer risk, further studies
need to be done for LPA because there have been inconsistent findings.[17] Evidence for an association between
physical activity and vegetable intake and risk of pancreatic cancer is not consistent. Some case-control study suggest that physical activity and vegetable intake are
associated with reduced risk[3] but that was not suggested
in our cohort study or a recent prospective study.[29]
Thus, the association between vegetable consumption
and physical activity and pancreatic cancer risk warrants
further investigation.[28]
While smoking avoidance is the most important behavior
that can reduce cancer risk,[1] the daily consumption of
vegetables or regular physical activity might also reduce
risk, especially for lung, stomach and liver cancers. Our
findings support the increase of vegetable preference and
physical activity as powerful public health measures to
reducing cancer[1] and its considerable burden on society.[12]
Our study has several limitations. First, there was a possibility of selection bias. In the study population, only government employees/teachers were included and all
women were eliminated, which might have limitation of
generalization. In addition, Korean diet is different from
North American diet, these cultural differences should be
considered to interpret our results. Second, calculating
exact MET-hr/wk for LPA was impossible in this study for

BMC Cancer 2008, 8:366 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/8/366
Page 16 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)
comparison with other studies,[26,27] because the questionnaire included only about the frequency and duration
of sweat-producing activity without specific activity type
or intensity. Third, we could not collect the information
about OPA or usual activity including household. In multivariate analysis, however, we adjusted for employment
status, which might be a surrogate for OPA. In addition,
when we stratified the subjects based on employment status, the results were similar to those for the whole population (data not shown). Only the association between
LPA and stomach cancer (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82–1.12)
was attenuated and not statistically significant in white
collar workers. Forth, we did not collect the diet information in detail. Therefore, we could not analyze the differences in food consumptions between the three diet
preferences groups based on study participant's opinion
into which group he or she belongs to.
The consumption of common foods over the course of a
year, however, is not encoded as a series of discrete episodic events, but preference is inferred from the "liking" of
a specific diet effect on attitude, taste factors, and habit.
[30] Further study is needed to clarify the association
between reported dietary preference and actual food consumed. Fifth, there is a weak scientific evidence for the
classification of dietary preferences as (1) meat, (2) vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat. However, when
we performed the analysis with various classifications, we
couldn't find significant association between other classification of diet preference and cancer risk. Moreover, one
Japanese study also showed that the combined intakes of
meat and vegetables on colon cancer incidence.[17]
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is first study for dietary preference
and cancer risk. As few is known about the association
between dietary preference and cancer risk, further studies
are needed. Despite these limitations, our findings add to
the evidence of the beneficial effects of vegetable preference on lung cancer risk and of physical activity on lung,
stomach, and liver cancer risk. This study suggested that
the additive effect of combined vegetable preference and
LPA might reduce lung and stomach cancers.
