It is a reliable sign of uncertainty in medicine whenever we use
a considerable number of names for what is most likely one
single entity as is the case with cholemic nephropathy (CN),
bile cast nephropathy,icteric nephrosis, and bile acid nephropathy.1 It is, however, a clinical truism that jaundiced patients
are at significantly increased risk for renal failure and patients
with jaundice and renal failure have a dismal prognosis, as
shown in former studies and recently confirmed by the sound
results of the landmark CANONIC study.2–5 Consequently, we
have to ask ourselves whether the resurrection of CN we
currently observe is (1) the end of the hibernation of an
important disease, (2) the reinvention of the emperor’s new
clothes, or (3) the slow emergence of a black box in clinical
hepatology and nephrology that is now hidden in the mixed
bag of acute kidney injury-hepatorenal syndrome (AKI-HRS)?
“A rose of any other name would smell as sweet” (William
Shakespeare): Cholemic nephropathy (CN) – What is in a
name and does the name matter?
The concept that bile constituents, and more specifically
bile pigments, might harm the kidney dates back to 1899
when Quincke noted bile pigments staining the glomeruli in
autopsies of patients with acute onset of jaundice6,7; our
short historical note on that has appeared elsewhere.1 On its
journey through medical literature, kidney injury in cholestatic patients, animals, and corresponding experimental
animal models was referred to with numerous names as
mentioned earlier. Some terms found in literature, such as
the currently widely used bile cast nephropathy, result from
description of presumably characteristic morphological
alterations or still unproven pathophysiological concepts.8
We think that “bile cast” is a misnomer, since bile can be
found either in bile ducts, the gall bladder, or in the intestine
but never in the kidney, and consequently also not in renal
tubular casts. Nevertheless, this term suggests that we know
that tubular casts observed in patients with CN primarily
consist of bile or biliary constituents, most likely bilirubin,
while there is no information on other important biliary
constituents such as phospholipids and bile acids. Other
names, such as bile acid nephropathy, suggest a clarified
etiopathogenesis9–12; however, such an assumption would
currently appear constricting and premature even in the
light of some experimental evidence showing a central role

Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a dreaded complication in patients with liver disease and
jaundice, since it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Cholemic
nephropathy (CN) is thought to represent a widely underestimated important cause of
AKI in advanced liver diseases with jaundice. The umbrella term CN describes impaired
renal function along with histomorphological changes consisting of intratubular cast
formation and tubular epithelial cell injury directed primarily toward distal nephron
segments. In cholestasis, biliary constituents may be excreted via the kidney and
bilirubin or bile acids may trigger tubular injury and cast formation, but as we begin to
understand the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, we become increasingly
aware of the urgent need for clearly defined diagnostic criteria. In the following, we aim
to summarize current knowledge of clinical and morphological characteristics of CN,
discuss potential pathomechanisms, and raise key questions to stimulate evolution of a
research strategy for CN.

for bile acids in CN.13–15 In contrast, we find that the term CN
is more neutral in that it indicates spill-over of biliary
constituents such as bile acids and bilirubin into blood
(i.e., cholemia) leading to renal dysfunction and histological
changes in jaundiced patients. Based on findings in longitudinal studies in common bile duct ligated mice, CN starts
with tubular epithelial injury in distal nephron segments,
accompanied by intraluminal cast formation (the composition of which remains to be determined in detail), leading to
obstruction and dilatation of the tubules.13
We find that harmonizing the nomenclature by using CN
might be most advantageous,1 since CN neither restricts to a
specific histology (which may well not exist) nor to a specific
and so far unproven pathogenetic mechanism (e.g., the
highly controversial issue of whether tubular casts are
the cause or consequence of CN, and the overall impact of
bile acids in CN).
“Cause and effect are two sides of one fact” (Ralph Waldo
Emerson): What causes cholemic nephropathy (CN)?
Although intuitive, as outlined above, the focus on biliary
constituents such as bilirubin and bile acids as potentially
causative for CN1,9 may conceptually be misleading as it
neglects inflammatory processes that may also contribute to
CN (►Fig. 1).16 However, what we know so far on the
pathogenesis of CN still circles around these two molecules.
Bilirubin
Bilirubinuria means that in cholestasis, when less bile reaches
the duodenum, conjugated bilirubin is alternatively excreted
via the urine. The potential nephrotoxicity of unconjugated
bilirubin was ascribed to its accumulation in mitochondria
with subsequent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation with
decreased adenosine triphosphatase activity. This was associated with mitochondrial defects and led to increased permeability of cell membranes, resulting in modified electrolyte
content and cell volume.17–21 However, currently there is no
direct proof for the concept that bilirubin may be causative for
tubular epithelial injury, cast formation, or more generally
speaking CN. Renal bilirubin accumulation in CN may therefore
just be an innocent bystander caused by accumulation through
alternative renal excretion in cholestasis hampered through
cast formation and tubular injury. Interestingly, there seems to
be a certain threshold for serum bilirubinlevels (> 15 mg/dL)in
patients with CN. However, this does not necessarily mean that
high bilirubin levels are causative; rather, it might reflect
the degree of cholestasis and liver disease. Indeed, bilirubin
may even have renoprotective effects,whichwere attributed to
an increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 and increased
activity of this enzyme in kidneys of common bile duct ligated
rodents.22–27 In addition, bilirubin was shown to improve
vascular resistance, tubular function, mitochondrial integrity,
and inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen oxidase and nitric oxide synthase 2 expression,
which all together would be assumed to be beneficial for
stressed kidneys.24–26 There is also increasing clinical evidence
that elevated serum bilirubin levels may be renoprotective. In
line with that assumption, late graft failure in kidney transplant patients was significantly lower in those with higher
bilirubin.27 Moreover, a large-sized cohort study showed
slower chronic kidney disease progression in individuals
with only mild elevations of serum bilirubin levels beyond
the upper limit of normal (ULN).28 In essence, there is currently
no strong experimental evidence supporting a causative role
for bilirubin in the pathogenesis of CN. Nevertheless, increased
urinary excretion of bilirubin may still be an attractive cause of
tubular casts and virtually nothing is known about the physicochemistry of bilirubin within casts or the tubular lumen in
CN. Consequently, several intriguing questions remain such as
whether there is bilirubin crystal formation or cross-reaction
with proteins or alternative molecules in CN.
Bile Acids
Under physiological conditions, glomerular-filtered bile acids
are reuptaken in the distal part of Henle’s loop via active
transport systems, apical sodium-dependent transporter and
organic solute transporter α/β,
29 similar to the quantitatively
much more important reuptake of bile acids in the terminal
ileum during their enterohepatic circulation that starts with
the excretion of hepatic bile acids with bile into the duodenum.30 In cholestatic patients, less bile reaches the duodenum
and bile acids spill over from theliver and accumulate in serum.
Alternative renal excretion of bile acids is currently seen as a
mechanism of compensation under this condition.31–35 It is
therefore tempting to speculate that this mechanism may
exceed the kidneys’ capability for alternative bile acid excretion
at certain levels of cholestasis, resulting in CN.36
The most compelling evidence that bile acids may trigger
CN derives from experimental animal models. In response to
common bile duct ligation (CBDL), serum bile acids peak
around day 3.13,31,36 Notably, this coincides with discrete
alterations in proximal tubule architecture, which may easily
be missed on hematoxylin and eosin stained kidney sections
but may be more easily seen on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)–
stained sections.13,36We showed epithelial injury in collecting
ducts in CBDL mice at day 3 that will hardly be detected in
patients.13 Besides tubular epithelial injury, basement membrane defects leading to leaky tubuli and obstruction of
collecting ducts due to sloughed cells, tubular casts, and
increased urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
levels were found.13–15 There is no evidence in this model that
tubular casts contain plentiful bilirubin; however, CBDLmouse
liver, intriguingly, shows neither bilirubinostasis nor bile plugs
and the species differences remain unexplained. Time course
studies revealed that these early lesions were followed by
interstitial nephritis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis later on.
With long-term CBDL (up to 8 weeks), we were able to model
the typical human histomorphological and functional alterations with CN.13 These findings suggest that full-blown CN in
CBDL mice requires a long-standing and severe form of cholestasis. Evidence that bile acid toxicity is key in this model is
based on two main experimental findings and key experiments: (1) increasing the hydrophilicity of the bile acid pool

with the aid of hydrophilic and nontoxic norursodeoxycholic
acid (norUDCA) significantly ameliorated the renal phenotype14 and (2) CBDL in FXR/ mice (with a much more
hydrophilic bile acid pool in comparison to the wild-type
controls) were protected against CN but showed similar renal
fibrosis in response to unilateral ureteral ligation.13 Accordingly, bile acids might represent a key determinant of CN in
CBDL mice. High concentrations of cholephiles such as bile
acids in the renal tubules (probably in concert with alternative
danger signals or inflammatory mediators) may be toxic to
tubular epithelial cells and consequently trigger inflammation.
Detailed mechanisms, however, still have to be determined
and most importantly currently there is no human evidence
that bile acids have a major role in CN. This is of critical
importance and likely based on the numerous species differences in bile acid biology between rodents and humans that
have to be considered.37,38
There is a lively discussion on the issue whether tubular
casts in CN may be the cause or rather the consequence of a
decreased glomerular filtration rate (please see AJKD blog;
#NephMadness 2019: Hepatorenal Region). Currently, known
cast ingredients in CN include desquamated epithelial cells,
protein precipitates, and bilirubin as evidenced by positive PAS
and Hall’s stain. However, this has to be referred to as indirect
evidence from unspecific staining methods, since a detailed
biochemical analysis of casts in CN is still unavailable. The
enigma also remains as to whether casts themselves are
tubulotoxic or may trigger CN. Such a mechanism could
hypothetically be analogous to cast nephropathies by myeloma or myoglobin release from crushed muscles.39–42 Interestingly, tubular casts in CN are predominantly found in
aquaporin 2-positive collecting ducts in CBDL mice.13 This
key finding was recently confirmed in kidney biopsies of
patients with CN.43 Tubular cast formation at the level of
collecting ducts originate not only from a higher urinary
concentration due to water reabsorption in this part of the
nephron but also from lower pH, both of which may promote
cast formation.44,45 Consequently, the formation of tubular
casts in CN could be due to the poor water solubility of
cholephiles such as bilirubin and specific bile acids and/or
limited proximal tubular reabsorption. Again, detailed biochemical analysis of tubular casts should provide important
results and answers.
Inflammation
Cholestasis and jaundice are frequently seen in patients with
decompensated cirrhosis. CN may in fact be more frequent as
suggested so far in such patients, since several studies showed
that there may actually be renal pathology comparable to CN,
even when patients were clinically classified as having HRS.
Thus, our current diagnostic criteria for HRS do not rule out
CN.8,46 In recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating
that decompensated cirrhosis is associated with persistent
systemic inflammation, which may play an important part in
the progression of cirrhosis and the development of complications, including not only HRS but also CN.16,47–49 Patients
with advanced cirrhosis show bacterial translocation from the
gut to mesenteric lymph nodes, which is associated with
increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition,
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) deriving
from bacterial translocation or bacterial infections and
damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, e.g., highmobility group protein B1) may come into play. It is consequently attractive to speculate that such inflammatory
cascades may also trigger CN, again analogues as to the
pathogenesis of myoglobin nephropathy underscoring the
importance of macrophages and activated platelets in this
disease.50
Figuring out the pathogenesis of CN will be demanding
indeed and will require a multidisciplinary approach including
clinical and experimental nephrologists, hepatologists, and
pathologists.
“The proof of the pudding is in the eating” (English
saying): What is the clinical evidence for cholemic
nephropathy?
The clinical literature on CN published since the early 20th
century was more or less anecdotal, constituting mainly of
case reports or case series and CN did not attract much
attention either in the hepatologists’ or the nephrologists’
camps (►Table 1). This may be related to its overlap with
different medical disciplines and their respective interests,
and general problems with research funding for CN; even a
lack of clinical appeal due to the generally poor prognosis of
jaundiced patients with AKI may be a reason. The pathology
series published by van Slambrouck et al including analysis of
44 patients (classified as 23 cirrhotic jaundice, 14 obstructive
jaundice, 5 hepatic jaundice, 2 hemolytic jaundice) had a
game changing effect, at least with the invention of the new
name “bile cast nephropathy” and suddenly raised considerable interest in the cause and consequences of kidney disease
in jaundiced patients.8,46 In essence, the findings of this
interesting study can be summarized in that the presence
of tubular casts (positive for Hall’s stain indicating bilirubin
content) correlated with higher serum bilirubin levels and
showed a trend toward higher creatinine levels. However, as
we discussed above, changing the name from CN to bile cast
nephropathy may harbor significant disadvantages, but most
importantly, this paper substantially stimulated nephrologists’ and hepatologists’ imaginations and interest in this
most likely underestimated and probably important disease
and stimulated recent research and discussions.8,46
Subsequently, Bräsen et al investigated the frequency and
clinical course of CNin their tertiary care hospital over a period
of more than 15 years (from 2000 to 2016) when a total of 79
patients with liver disease underwent kidney biopsy due to
deteriorating renal function.43 It is important to note that this
retrospective analysis was based on the presumed histomorphological characteristics of CN, specifically the presence of
Hall’s stain-positive bilirubin casts. Out of 79 patients, 45
presented with AKI and in this study the diagnosis of CN
was exclusively observed in patients with AKI (8 of 45, 18%). All
patients with histological findings compatible with CN were
positive for bilirubin in the urine, whereas only 22% of non-CN

patients had detectable urinary bilirubin. An additional univariate logistic regression analysis identified bilirubin > 5
times the ULN and alkaline phosphatase > 3 times the ULN
as independent risk factors. Importantly, this study calls the
specificity of histological findings in CN into question. To
further characterize the histomorphology of CN and to determine the specificity of these findings, the authors developed a
questionnaire and included some CN cases in a group of 20
acute tubular injury cases (7 CN, 7 cases with liver disease and
elevated bilirubin but no CN, and 6 cases with pigment
deposits for different reasons such as lipofuscin, iron, or
porphyria). The authors invited six highly experienced nephropathologists from three different pathology departments to
participate and answer the questionnaire. Neither the evaluation of all six raters nor a subgroup analysis based on theirlevel
of experience (nephropathologists with > 10 vs. > 15 years
of experience) identified discriminating histopathological
features among the chosen entities indicating that the histopathological findings in CN may be less specific than initially
suggested. Moreover, Hall’s stain is known to have a low
sensitivity.8 Of note, this important study confirmed that
kidney biopsy carried a significant risk of bleeding (6 of 79
patients, 8%; 4 underwent surgery or vascular coiling). Therefore, kidney biopsy/histology may not represent the ideal
diagnostic test and the findings of the Bräsen et al study
reinforce the need for noninvasive and alternative diagnostic
methods.
Both studies raise the pivotal question about the estimated number of unreported cases of CN within the group
of patients currently referred to as AKI-HRS, since they may
also fulfill the revised modern criteria for this syndrome.51,52 It is attractive to hypothesize that AKI-HRS
patients with insufficient response to terlipressin or noradrenalin may be most likely to have CN.
Diagnostic Challenges in Cholemic
Nephropathy
A consensus on diagnostic criteria for CN is sorely missed. From
the clinicians’ point of view, the differential diagnosis of CN
arisesin cases with (prolonged) deep jaundice and concomitant
impairment of renal function which may not be primarily
related to or explained by clinical significant portal hypertension (i.e., the situation with only minimal or lack of ascites).
Currently, the diagnosis of CN is solely based upon kidney
histology with Hall’s stain-positive bilirubin casts as the diagnostic corner stone, which are frequently considered as disease
specific. The tubular casts in CN may significantly differ in color
(e.g., greenish yellow, light to dark red), composition (variable
degree of cellular debris), and localization (primarily in the
distal nephron segments, also in the proximal segments in
severe cases). Pathologists use the Hall’s stain (i.e., using
Fouchet’s reagent which converts bilirubin to green biliverdin)
to confirm bilirubin in the casts and Perls’ Prussian blue stain to
rule out ferric iron deposits. It again has to be mentioned that
Hall’s histochemical stain is insensitive. In addition, kidney
biopsy in patients with advanced liver disease may involve a
significant risk of bleeding, as also observed in the Bräsen et al
study.43 Consequently, the benefit–risk ratio for kidney biopsy
in such cases is complicated, especially in the light of the
current lack of therapeutic consequences. Together with the
current evidence that kidney histology in CN might not be as
specific as has been suggested,43 this also raises the critical
question of whether CN is indeed a specific entity in each
individual case. Alternatively, CN may also represent a part of
the spectrum of AKI in jaundiced patients also including those
with advanced chronic liver disease, acute on chronic liver
failure (ACLF), or inflammatory-driven AKI. At least what is
known from published autopsy studies argues for such an
assumption, since there are numerous patients reported showing morphological characteristics of CN in kidney histology but
were clinically classified as AKI-HRS.8,46 A postmortem kidney
biopsy study by Nayak et al included 127 renal biopsies for
analysis obtained from 84 patients with decompensated cirrhosis and 43 patients with ACLF.46 Fifty-seven of the total 127
(45%) biopsies showed CN with Hall’s stain-positive and Perls’
stain-negative tubular casts. Patients with CN had significantly
higher levels of serum total bilirubin, total leukocyte count, and
Model of End-stage Liver Disease score than those without CN.
The authors concluded that CN was found in 72% of patients
with ACLF and 27% patients with decompensated cirrhosis
hospitalized with HRS-AKI. This indicates that a so far undefined percentage of patients fulfilling current AKI-HRS criteria
will show kidney histology compatible with the findings in CN.
Such a concept is further supported by the finding in Bräsen et
al’s study that patients with a unalterableliver problem did not
recover from CN in contrast to those with a treatable liver
disease (e.g., chronic hepatitis B).43 It is attractive to speculate
that the percentage of CN in terlipressin nonrepsonder AKIHRS patients will be high. However, all these intriguing questions have to be resolved in future prospective clinical trials,
since postmortem analysis and retrospective analysis of kidney
biopsies in AKI-HRS patients have several flaws and weaknesses ranging from the problem of potential postmortem
artifacts to the important issue of selection bias. Still, the
studies discussed above are relevant, since they challenge
our current concepts of definition and classification of AKIHRS on one hand and those of CN on the other and will
stimulate further essential research in this area.
The fact that kidney biopsy is risky especially in AKI
patients with advanced liver disease raises the critical issue
of alternative and noninvasive diagnostic methods. One
rather simple method could be urine cytospin and cellblock
analysis,53 but this still has to be evaluated in prospective
trials. In the Nayak et al study, there was no difference in the
(routine) urinary analysis between patients with and without CN; however, they did not use adequate protocols to
detect casts (e.g., centrifugation of 10 mL of urine at 2,000
revolutions per minute for 20 minutes) and the authors
critically discuss this interesting issue in detail.46 Future
prospective studies should therefore evaluate such protocols
for potential noninvasive detection of Fouchet’s or Hall’s
stain-positive casts in CN patients. Moreover, urinary
biomarkers such as NGAL, interleukin-18, kidney injury
molecule-1, and liver-type fatty acid binding protein should
be studied in CN as discussed in detail earlier.1

Management of Patients with Cholemic
Nephropathy
Currently, there is no specific treatment or management
recommendation for CN available. The published evidence
on that issue still has to be referred to as anecdotal and
publication bias is additionally very likely (►Table 1). Since
jaundiced patients are known to be at significantly increased
risk for AKI, potentially nephrotoxic agents should be omitted
to minimize tubular stress and volume status of patients has to
be checked and corrected carefully. In some patients, however,
complete recovery of renal function after successful biliary
drainage was observed, which is again a strong argument for
cholephiles as causing factors of CN. There is currently no
single published prospective clinical trial on the therapeutic
management of CN, which may originate in the ambiguity of
the diagnostic criteria and standards of CN, the discussed
differential diagnostic problems (especially clear discrimination from AKI-HRS), and the mixed patients population.
Animal experiments suggest that bile acids such as norUDCA
may represent attractive candidates for medical treatment.14
Task List for Cholemic Nephropathy
• We need diagnostic criteria and standards for CN.
• One of the most critical issues in the area is the widely
unknown clinical impact of CN in patients with and
without concomitant liver disease and the undefined
but likely overlap with AKI-HRS. For that aim, we urgently
need carefully designed prospective large cohort studies,
which should be performed by powerful study groups.
• Careful retrospective histological analysis of explanted
kidneys from patients with refractory AKI-HRS undergoing combined liver and kidney transplantation should be
most informative.
• Clinical studies should especially aim on theidentification of
triggers, risk factors, and noninvasive diagnostic tests for CN.
• Animal models with cholestatic liver diseases should be
screened for CN, since CBDL in rodents comprises several
limitations.1
• Mechanisms of renal tubular cell injury, impact of bile
acid signaling molecules such as FXR and TGR5 on renal
bile acid transport, and mediators of inflammation in CN
have to be determined.
• Since CN may have numerous parallels to myoglobin
nephropathy where platelets were just recently shown
to play a major role,50 the influence of platelets should be
clarified.
• Impact of activation of inflammatory cells, of DAMPs or
PAMPs, as well as of different cytokines and chemokines has
to be determined and such studies should specifically focus
on the identification of novel potential therapeutic targets.
Main Concepts and Learning Points
• The term cholemic nephropathy (CN) refers to renal
dysfunction with tubular epithelial injury primarily in
distal nephron segments accompanied by intraluminal
cast formation in patients with deep jaundice.
• The mechanisms of tubular cell injury remain elusive and
whether tubular casts in CN are cause or consequence of
the disease is unclear; the role of bilirubin is controversial,
but the role of bile acids is likely pivotal.
• Lack of clear diagnostic criteria and standards as well as
the need for invasive and potentially risky kidney biopsy
currently hinders accurate but exact diagnosis and consequently a clear picture of the clinical impact of CN in the
absence of prospective clinical trials.
• CN frequently resolves if cholestasis can be resolved, but
there is no specific therapy to achieve this.
• Research in CN should focus on its pathophysiology,
identification of noninvasive diagnostic tests, determination of its prognosis and clinical importance, and on the
development of specific treatment strategies.
