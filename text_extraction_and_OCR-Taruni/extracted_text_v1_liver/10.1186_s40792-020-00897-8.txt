Abstract
Background: To treat small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), many procedures
were described for portal flow modulation before, during, or after transplantation. The selection of the procedure as
well as the best timing remains controversial.
Case presentation: A 43-year-old female with end-stage liver disease underwent LDLT with extended left with
caudate lobe graft from her donor who was her 41-year-old brother (graft volume/standard liver volume (GV/SLV),
35.7%; graft to recipient weight ratio (GRWR), 0.67%). During the surgery, splenectomy could not be performed owing
to severe peri-splenic adhesions to avoid the ruined bleedings. The splenic artery ligation was not also completely
done because it was dorsal to the pancreas and difficult to be approached. Finally, adequate portal vein (PV) inflow
was confirmed after portal venous thrombectomy. As having post-transplant optional procedures that are accessible
for PV flow modulation, any other procedures for PV modulation during LDLT were not done until the postoperative
assessment of the graft function and PV flow for possible postoperative modulation of the portal flow accordingly.
Postoperative PV flow kept as high as 30 cm/s. By the end of the 1st week, there was a progressive deterioration of the
total bilirubin profile (peak as 19.4 mg/dL) and ascitic fluid amount exceeded 1000 mL/day. Therefore, splenic artery
embolization was done effectively and safely on the 10th postoperative day (POD) to reverse early allograft dysfunction
as PV flow significantly decreased to keep within 20 cm/s and serum total bilirubin levels gradually declined with
decreased amounts of ascites below 500 mL on POD 11 and thereafter. The patient was discharged on POD 28 with
good condition.
Conclusions: SFSS can be prevented or reversed by the portal inflow modulation, even by post-transplant procedure.
This case emphasizes that keeping accessible angiographic treatment options for PV modulation, such as splenic artery
embolization, after LDLT is quite feasible.

Introduction
Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is a commonly used treatment option for patients with end-stage
liver disease, particularly in eastern countries [1, 2].
Small-for-size syndrome (SFSS) can lead to serious early
graft dysfunction after LDLT. The main clinical presentation is cholestasis, prolonged ascites, coagulopathy,
and encephalopathy [3]. Extra small graft, portal hyperperfusion, severe portal hypertension, and venous outflow obstruction are the main underlying causes of SFSS
[4]. To prevent or reverse this drastic complication,
many procedures were described for portal flow modulation before, during, or after the transplant surgery; however, the selection of the procedure as well as the best
timing is still controversial [5–9].
Herein, we report a case of LDLT recipient who developed early graft dysfunction after LDLT and SFSS with
evident high portal flow. Postoperative splenic artery
embolization (SAE) was done as a post-transplant portal
inflow modulation, and SFSS was successfully treated.
Case presentation
The patient was a 43-year-old female with end-stage
liver disease secondary to HCV hepatitis. Her weight
was 60 kg and her body mass index was 24.3 kg/m2
. Her
blood type was O Rh (+). Preoperative assessment reveals the Child-Pugh score was grade C as 13 pts and
the model for end-stage liver disease score was high as
19. Radiological evaluation revealed partial PV thrombosis in the main trunk. She underwent partial SAE 8
years ago and umbilical hernia repair. Her donor was
her 41-year-old brother who weighted 79 kg and body
mass index was 26.7 kg/m2
. His blood type was B Rh (+).
Preoperative 3-dimensional volumetry revealed that the
extended left with caudate lobe graft volume was 555
mL, which was 49.2% of the recipient standard liver volume (SLV). The donor and recipient have incompatible
blood types, so the recipient was subjected to preoperative rituximab protocol.
The patient underwent LDLT using extended left with
caudate lobe graft. The actual graft weighted 467 g (402
g after UW reperfusion) of which GV/SLV was 35.7%
and GRWR was 0.67%. It had middle and left hepatic
veins, left hepatic artery, left PV, and left hepatic duct.
Upon laparotomy, there was 10,500 mL of ascites as well
as perihepatic adhesions and periumbilical adhesions.
On laparotomy, portal venous pressure (PVP) monitoring was 22 mmHg. The splenic artery was dorsal to the
pancreas and difficult to be approached, and finally, the
upper pole branch of the splenic artery was identified
and ligated at the level of the distal pancreas, by which
only the upper pole of the spleen turned pale. Splenectomy could not be performed due to severe peri-splenic
adhesions to avoid the ruined bleedings. After PV
thrombectomy was done, adequate PV inflow was not
confirmed until left gastric vessel ligation was performed. After graft reperfusion, PVP was 20 mmHg but
PV flow was relatively low, 520 mL/min. At this time, we
choose not to ligate the other branches of the splenic artery nor the lienorenal shunt until postoperative assessment of the graft function and the PV flow for possible
postoperative modulation and boost of the portal flow
accordingly. The point is that safe angiographic procedures for portal flow modulation are accessible postoperatively, such as splenic artery embolization for portal
decompression and balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) for boosting portal flow.
After LDLT, routine abdominal ultrasound screening
revealed that portal flow was 60 cm/s on POD 1, then it
kept as high as 30 cm/s along the 1st week (Fig. 1a). Ascites volume was initially below 1000 mL/day till 6th
POD, however, increased markedly thereafter. Serum
bilirubin levels showed a stepwise gradual increase that
reaches 19.4 mg/dL on POD 9 (Fig. 2). Platelet counts
were lowest (42 × 103
/μL) by POD 8 and INR levels kept
below 1.5 along the whole clinical course. Considering
this relatively insufficient graft volume along with the
clinical and laboratory parameters suggestive of SFSS,
then we decided to do splenic artery embolization (SAE)
for portal decompression. The patient underwent arterial
splenic angiography on POD 10 via percutaneous transfemoral Seldinger’s technique. After angiographic assessment, partial SAE occluding the main branch of the
splenic artery was achieved by trans-catheter coil
embolization (Fig. 1c, d). Dynamic computed tomography comparing the spleen pre- and postembolization
are also shown (Fig. 1e, f).
After SAE, PV flow significantly decreased to keep
within 20 cm/s by US study (Fig. 1b). Additionally,
serum total bilirubin levels gradually declined and ascites
amounts decreased below 400 mL (Fig. 2), and then, the
abdominal drain was removed on POD 21. Platelet
counts showed a stepwise increase thereafter. The patient was discharged on POD 28 in good condition without any infectious complications.
Discussion
SFSS is a catastrophic complication that can lead to graft
failure and retransplantation [10]. The classic postoperative course is graft dysfunction within the first 2 posttransplant weeks with two of the following: prolonged
functional cholestasis (serum total bilirubin levels > 5.0
mg/dL), intractable ascites (1000 mL/day), and/or coagulopathy (INR > 2) [10–13]. SFSS should be differentiated
from graft dysfunction due to other pathological abnormalities [14]. For instance, technical (e.g., arterial or portal occlusion, venous outflow congestion, bile leak),
immunological (e.g., acute rejection after LDLT), and

infectious (e.g., cholangitis, sepsis) abnormalities can
lead to graft dysfunction and overlapped clinical presentation [11, 12]. Moreover, recent studies have documented that GRWR less than 0.8% or GV/SLV less
than 40% do not necessarily lead to SFSS [15–19]. Indeed, multiple variables are attributed including preoperative recipient disease severity, donor age, portal
pressure and/or flow, graft type, and graft regeneration [3, 17, 20, 21].
This case presents a patient who underwent ABOiLDLT using extended left with caudate lobe graft that
was relatively insufficient as the GV/SLV 35.7% and at
high risk of SFSS after the surgery. Early graft dysfunction was imminent giving progressive hyperbilirubinemia
and intractable ascites. Radiological evaluation excluded
technical problems that may be the cause of the clinical
presentation. Liver transaminases were initially high;
however, along the 1st postoperative week, a progressive
decline towards near normal levels precludes possible
acute rejection. Therefore, along with a high postoperative portal flow, SFSS diagnosis was highly suspected.
Coagulopathy, represented by high prothrombin time
and INR, may be along the clinical presentation of SFSS
[10, 14]. However, in their series, Gruttadauria et al. reported that coagulopathy was not a reliable indicator of
SFSS [7]. In the present case, though INR values showed
a slight increase before splenic artery embolization SAE,
they were kept below 1.5 before as well as after portal
flow modulation.
High post-perfusion PVP had been reported to negatively impact graft outcome [22, 23]. In the setting of
small-for-size graft after LDLT, persistent elevation of
PVP causes direct hepatocyte injury due to sinusoidal
shear stress, congestion, hemorrhage, and endothelial activation [24–26]. Indeed, secondary ischemic changes
occur due to adaptive hepatic artery vasoconstriction
[27]. A key management strategy is portal flow modulation with partially diverting portal flow via portosystemic
shunt [28] and/or portal decompression by splenectomy
[3, 29, 30], splenic artery ligation [29, 31], or splenic artery embolization [7, 32, 33]. Following LDLT, maintaining adequate portal inflow is crucial for boosting graft
regeneration [34]. In the setting of portal hypertensive
liver cirrhosis, high sinusoidal resistance diverts portal
flow, via portosystemic collaterals, which may jeopardize
the graft [35]. Portal steal phenomenon can also occur
due to hepatofugal diversion of portal flow through
major (> 1 cm) portosystemic shunts [36, 37] with subsequent graft ischemic injury and possible posttransplantation PV thrombosis [28, 38, 39].
We [40, 41] previously reported the beneficial effects
of simultaneous splenectomy for recipients with PVP
more than 15 mmHg following graft reperfusion. In
addition, we previously described that en bloc division of
large portosystemic shunts along with splenectomy
should simplify and normalize portal hemodynamics
with the best graft outcome [42, 43]. On the contrary,
the Tokyo University group reported that splenectomy
was an independent predictor for postoperative
hemorrhage and sepsis; hence, they restricted simultaneous splenectomy in strictly indicated recipients [44].
Moon et al. compared simultaneous splenectomy to an
innovative technique, splenic devascularization in adult
LDLT. A higher incidence of procedural-related complications was observed in the splenectomy group, as pancreatic fistula, abscess, and hemorrhage, though, did not
reach statistical significance [45]. In the setting of LDLT,
simultaneous splenectomy often leads to higher morbidity. In the present case, extensive peri-splenic adhesions
put the patient at high risk for simultaneous splenectomy. Attempts to ligate the main splenic artery also
make the patient at high risk for distal pancreatic injury
which can lead to post-transplant catastrophic pancreatic complications. Moreover, following PV thrombectomy and reperfusion, as we previously described, PVP
was relatively adequate [46]; however, PV flow was 520
mL/s. As we have the postoperative optional procedures
that are accessible for portal flow modulation, then additional intraoperative procedures were not performed
during LDLT until postoperative assessment of graft
function and PV flow. For instance, SAE can be an alternative for portal decompression [7, 32, 33] and BRTO
can be used for boosting portal hypoperfusion salvaging
against portal steal preventing graft ischemia [47]. Postoperative portal hemodynamics were disturbed as PV inflow kept high along with marked intractable ascites and
serum hyperbilirubinemia, then postoperative SFSS ensued. SAE effectively reversed early allograft dysfunction
and impending SFSS.
Previous reports have already pointed to SAE for posttransplant portal modulation. For instance, Gruttadauria
et al. [7] reported a series of six patients; however, all
were right lobe graft with mean GRWR 1.282 ± 0.276%.
Although the clinical presentation was nearly similar to
this report, they did not refer to portal pressure nor flow
in the peritransplant management. In the present case,
the graft of extended left with caudate lobe was low as
GRWR 0.67%. After graft reperfusion, finally, PVP was
relatively high as 20 mmHg, while PV flow was relatively
low as 520 mL/min. Therefore, we choose to monitor
portal hemodynamics and decide further management
giving accessible angiographic options postoperatively.
Reported rates of complications after SAE, as splenic
abscesses, splenic infarction, infections, bleeding, pancreatitis, or postembolization syndrome (abdominal pain,
fever, and increased levels of pancreatic enzymes), widely
vary [48, 49]. In the setting of post-transplant SFSS, SAE
is a safe and feasible option. Among 54 patients who
Elshawy et al. Surgical Case Reports (2020) 6:164 Page 4 of 6

underwent post-transplant SAE, Presser et al. [32] reported one case of post-splenectomy syndrome (transient leukocytosis and fever which resolve spontaneously
shortly after SAE). The present case did not develop any
post SAE complications.
Giving post-transplantation portal modulation dilemma [6, 9, 32, 50], postoperative portal modulation
can be an alternative to high-risk intraoperative procedures. As portal hyperperfusion is contributed by splenic
flow [7], an angiographic intervention can aid and may
be more effective in post-transplant portal inflow modulation when necessary. For instance, the present case
emphasizes that in the setting of relatively small-for-size
graft, post-transplant portal decompression with splenic
artery embolization can safely rescue from impending
SFSS in case of increased portal inflow postoperatively.
Conclusion
We report here the case of a patient who recovered from
SFSS by the postoperative portal flow modulation by
splenic artery embolization. The present case suggests
that keeping the accessible angiographic treatment options for PV modulation after LDLT is quite feasible.
