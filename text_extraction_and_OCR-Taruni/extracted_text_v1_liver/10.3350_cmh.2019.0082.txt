INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded RNA virus and was 
first discovered in 1983,1
 but the viral genome was cloned in 
1990.2
 It is estimated that HEV causes 20.1 million infections annually, leading to 3.4 million symptomatic cases with acute hepatitis and 70,000 deaths related to acute liver failure.3
HEV has eight genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 2 only infect humans, are detected mainly in Asia and Mexico, respectively and 
they spread through fecal-oral route. Genotypes 3 and 4 are detected mainly in Europe and North America, circulate in animal 
species such as pigs, wild boars and deer and occasionally infect 
humans via consumption of contaminated meat or direct contact.4
Also, genotype 3 has been detected in shellfishes in Scotland and 
in southern Italy.5,6 Genotypes 5 and 6 have been only reported in 
wild boar and genotypes 7 and 8 have been identified in camels.7
The diagnostic tests for HEV infection include detection of antibodies against HEV (IgM anti-HEV and IgG anti-HEV) and detection of HEV RNA. IgM anti-HEV is positive during the first month 
after HEV infection, while IgG anti-HEV represents current or past 
infection.8
 Detection of HEV RNA in blood or stool characterizes 
chronic or acute HEV infection. Chronic hepatitis E is defined as 
Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis E virus:

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a significant health problem with approximately 20 million individuals infected annually. 
HEV infection has been associated with a wide spectrum of extrahepatic manifestations, including neurological, 
hematological and renal disorders. Guillain-Barré syndrome and neuralgic amyotrophy are the most frequent 
neurological manifestations. In addition, HEV infection has been observed with other neurological diseases, such 
as encephalitis, myelitis and Bell’s palsy. Hematologic manifestations include anemia due to glucose-6-phospate 
dehydrogonase deficiency, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia. Membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis and relapse IgA nephropathy with or without coexisting cryoglobulinemia appear to be the most 
common renal injuries related with HEV infection. Also, HEV infection has been associated with acute pancreatitis and 
other immune-mediated manifestations, such as arthritis and myocarditis. However, the pathophysiologic mechanisms 
of HEV-related extrahepatic manifestations are still largely unclear. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2020;26:16-23)

HEV RNA being detectable for at least 3 months. In immunosuppresed patients with chronic HEV infection, antibodies are often 
undetectable.9
 HEV infection is usually self-limiting and causes 
acute mild illness. However, HEV infection during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester may lead to acute liver failure.10
Chronic HEV infection is rare and may develop in immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant recipients.11
In addition, HEV has been associated with a range of extrahepatic manifestations, including a spectrum of neurological symptoms and diseases, hematological disorders, renal diseases, acute 
pancreatitis, myocarditis, arthritis and autoimmune thyroiditis 
(Table 1).12 However, the pathophysiologic mechanism of extrahepatic manifestations remains unclear. It seems that viral infections 
trigger a variety of host-defense mechanisms, which may not be 
restricted to the primary location of infection and can cause crossreactions between viral epitopes and self-antigens, leading to 
multisystemic manifestations. Another possible explanation is that 
HEV replicates not only in liver, but also in other tissues. HEV has 
been detected in neuronal cells,13 human placenta,14 breast milk,15
and urine.16
NEUROLOGICAL MANIFESTATIONS 
Several neurological manifestations have been associated with 
HEV infection and include Guillain-Barré syndrome (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy), neuralgic amyotrophy, encephalitis, myelitis, myositis, vestibular neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, Bell’s palsy and mononeuritis multiplex.17 In a 
prospective multicenter study from United Kingdom, France and 
Netherlands it was found that 2.4% (11/464) of patients with 
non-traumatic neurologic injury had evidence of HEV infection.18
Also, a study from France demonstrated the neurologic disorders 
in patients infected with HEV and found that 16.5% of HEV-infected patients reported neurologic symptoms and neurological 
manifestations were more frequent in immunocompetent patients 
compared to immunosuppressed patients (22.6% vs. 3.2%, 
P<0.001).19 However, a study from China compared the prevalence of acute hepatitis E between 1,117 patients diagnosed with 
neurological illness and 1,475 healthy controls and found that 
there was no difference (0.54% vs. 0.68%).20 A possible explanation is the geographical distribution of HEV. The study from China 
was conducted in an area endemic for HEV genotype 4, while the 
European studies reported cases associated with HEV genotype 3. 
Therefore, HEV genotype 4 seems not to contribute to neurological disorders.21
Guillain-Barré syndrome
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute onset immune-mediated disorder of peripheral nervous system and is characterized by 
acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, causing rapidly progressing symmetric motor paralysis.22 HEV infection 
has been associated with development of GBS. Many studies have 
reported the high prevalence rate of HEV infection among GBS 
patients and several case reports have been documented showing 
the coexistence of acute hepatitis E with GBS. In Netherlands, 
201 patients with GBS were compared with 201 healthy controls 
with a similar distribution in age, sex, and year of sampling and it

was found that the prevalence of acute hepatitis E was higher in 
patients with GBS compared with healthy controls (5% vs. 
0.5%).23 Additionally, in a similar study in Japan, 4.8% (3/63) of 
patients with GBS had acute HEV infection preceding the onset 
illness, while no patients from healthy control group (0/61) suffered from acute hepatitis E. Furthermore, a retrospective cohort 
study in Belgium found that the prevalence of HEV infection in 
patients with GBS was 8% (6/73).24 In all studies, there were no 
differences regarding course and outcomes of GBS between HEVrelated GBS and HEV-unrelated GBS. Also, cases of acute HEV infection have been found in pediatric patients with GBS.25
Neuralgic amyotrophy
Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA), also known as Parsonage-Turner 
syndrome, is an acute and painful unique or multiple mononeuropathy in the upper extremity and is characterized by rapid multifocal motor weakness, amyotrophy and sensory loss.26 It seems 
that HEV infection can trigger the development of NA and several 
studies have been conducted. A cohort study with 64 patients 
from United Kingdom and Netherlands found that 10% of patients with NA had acute hepatitis E, but HEV was not related to 
age, sex, severity, disease course or outcome.27 Also, it seems 
that patients with NA and HEV have a distinct phenotype. A multicenter European study compared 61 HEV-NA patients with 61 NA 
patients and found that, HEV-NA appears more often predominately bilateral asymmetrical involvement (80.0% vs. 8.6%, 
P<0.001) and more extensive damage to the brachial plexus. Involvement outside the brachial plexus is more common in HEVNA (58.5% vs. 10.5%, P<0.01).28
Other neurological manifestations
Other neurological cases associated with HEV infection include 
vestibular neuritis,29 Bell’s palsy,30 acute ataxic neuropathy,31
transverse myelitis,32 acute encephalic Parkinsonism,33 oculomotor 
palsy,34 myositis,35 seizure,36 pseudotumor cerebri,37 bilateral pyramidal syndrome,38 polyradiculoneuropathy,39 and mononeuritis 
multiplex.40 In addition, central nervous system infections, such as 
encephalitis and meningitis, with HEV have been reported and 
HEV RNA has been demonstrated in serum and cerebrospinal fluid 
at the time of acute illness. Also, many patients with CNS infection were immunosuppresed as a result of solid organ transplantation.41
Pathogenic mechanism
The pathogenic mechanism between HEV and neurological disorders has been not clarified, but it seems that HEV is also neurotropic. Shedding of HEV RNA into the cerebrospinal fluid and intrathecal production of IgM anti-HEV has been detected in a 
patient with NA and acute HEV infection.42 Additionally, a study 
demonstrated that human neuronal-derived cell lines such as neuroepithelioma, desmoplastic cerebellar medulloblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme, glioblastoma astrocytoma and oligodendrocytic 
cells can support HEV RNA replication.43
It is recommended that clinicians consider the possibility of HEV 
infection in patients with neurological disorders and concurrent 
liver enzyme alteration, especially those with peripheral nerve involvement.44
RENAL MANIFESTATIONS
Renal disorders have been reported during HEV infection, including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemia. A retrospective study assessed kidney function and histology in 51 cases of solid-organ transplant patients during 
genotype 3 HEV infection and they observed statistically but not 
clinically significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (-5 mL/min, P=0.04) during HEV infection. In renal biopsies, 
glomerular diseases were identified. They included relapse of IgA 
nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The 
majority of these patients had cryoglobulinemia. After HEV clearance, cryoglobulinemia resolved and proteinuria and renal function improved.45 Additional cases of HEV-related membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and membranous nephropathy have 
been reported.46,47 In one case, HEV infection triggered monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance.48
The association between cryoglobulinemia and HEV infection 
has not been fully investigated. In a study with solid organ recipients, who suffered from HEV infection, the prevalence of cryoglobulinemia was increased during chronic phase of infection 
(52.9%) compared to acute phase of infection (36.4%) and HEVnegative solid organ recipients (23.6%) (P<0.01). Also, HEV infection was identified as an independent predictive factor for cryoglobulinemia (odds ratio, 2.3).49 Another retrospective study from 
Germany compared the prevalence of IgG anti-HEV between patients with cryoglobulinemia and healthy controls. They found 
that the anti-HEV seroprevalence rate was significantly higher in

patients with essential cryoglobulinemia than in non-essential 
cryoglobulinemia patients (P=0.043), suggesting that previous 
HEV contact might play a role in some cases of cryoglobulinemia 
that are currently classified as essential.50
HEMATOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS 
Anemia
Different patterns of anemia have been reported during HEV infection, including hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phospate 
dehydrogonase (G-6-PD) deficiency, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and aplastic anemia. Hemolytic anemia may be a 
complication of acute viral hepatitis and the frequency rate of hemolysis has been reported in up to 23% of patients. The prevalence of hemolytic anemia may rise up to 70% in patients who 
have G-6-PD deficiency.51 Patients with G-6-PD deficiency have 
low levels of glutathione in red blood cells, leading to accumulation of oxidants during viral hepatitis and resulting in hemolysis. 
Several cases of hemolysis in patients with G-6-PD deficiency and 
acute HEV infection have been reported.52-54 In some cases of hemolysis in patients with acute HEV infection and G-6-PD deficiency, there was development of renal failure, as a result of possible 
obstruction of renal tubules due to hemoglobulin and bilirubin.55,56
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been described in association with a variety of hepatotropic viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV).57 AIHA is 
diagnosed based on clinical presentation, spherocytosis, laboratory findings and positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT). However, 
DAT was negative up to 15% of AIHA cases. In four published 
cases of AIHA-related with hepatitis E, the treatment was supportive and their outcomes were favorable.58-61
Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia is an uncommon but distinct variant of aplastic in which pancytopenia appears 2 or 3 
months after an acute attack of viral hepatitis. Several viruses, 
such as parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HAV 
and HBV, have been associated with aplastic anemia.62 Three cases of HEV-related aplastic anemia have been reported. In one 
case there was no response to treatment with cyclosporine and in 
the second case, the patient expired due to sepsis and in the third 
case, the patient was treated with thymoglobulin, cyclosporine, 
corticosteroids, filgastrim and transfusions.63-65
Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is a well-recognized complication of infections, including those from hepatotropic viruses. A variety of possible mechanisms of thrombocytopenia have been reported and 
includes hypersplenism, reduced hepatic production of thrombopoietin, bone marrow suppression by hepatotropic virus or treatment and development of anti-platelet autoantibodies and platelet-associated immune complexes.66 Several cases of HEVassociated thrombocytopenia have been documented. In most 
cases, thrombocytopenia was self-limited, while in other cases, 
the patients needed to receive platelet transfusion, intravenous 
globulin and/ or corticosteroid. It is worth mentioning that, antiplatelet antibodies were detected in some cases of HEV-related 
thrombocytopenia.44,61,67,68
Other hematological diseases
HEV infection has been related with other less common hematological disorders. Few cases of HEV-related hemophagocytic 
syndrome have been documented.69-71 Also, HEV infection has 
been detected in patients with CD30 (+) cutaneous T cell lymphoproliferative disorder72 and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). However, the relation between MGUS 
and HEV remains uncertain.73 Additionally in one case, thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura relapse induced by acute hepatitis 
E transmitted by cryosupernatant plasma. HEV infection treated 
with ribavirin and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura remitted 
with remission of HEV infection.74
ACUTE PANCREATITIS 
A wide variety of infectious agents has been associated with 
acute pancreatitis and these include viruses, bacteria and parasites. The association between acute pancreatitis and viral hepatitis is well known and HAV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus have been 
implicated most often.75,76 A proposed pathogenetic mechanism is 
the development of edema of the ambulla of Vater, causing obstruction of pancreatic fluid flow.77 Several cases of HEV-induced 
acute pancreatitis have been reported.78,79 In a single-center study 
from France, 2.1% (16/790) of patients with acute pancreatitis 
had serological evidence of recent HEV infection with no other 
discernible cause of pancreatitis.80 The typical profile of a patient 
is a young male from an endemic area or having recently travelled

to that area, who develops mild to moderate acute pancreatitis.81
However, life-threatening complications, such as, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, pseudocyst bleeding and multiorgan failure, have 
been reported.82-84
OTHER MANIFESTATIONS
Development of many other diseases has been reported during 
HEV infection, but further studies are needed to establish the association. In previous literatures, three cases of HEV-associated 
myocarditis have been reported.85 Furthermore, HEV infection has 
been correlated with thyroid diseases. These include autoimmune 
thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis and Grave’s thyrotoxicosis.86-88 In 
addition, a case of Henoch-Schönlein purpura triggered by 
acute HEV infection89 and another case of HEV-induced myasthenia Gravis have been described.90 Lastly, HEV infection may cause 
acute polyarthritis.91,92
CONCLUSION
Several extrahepatic manifestations and diseases have been 
documented during acute and chronic HEV infection. Neurologic 
diseases are demonstrated to be the most common extrahepatic 
manifestations of HEV infection, followed by hematological disorders and kidney injury. However, the pathophysiology of these 
manifestations and the causal relation with HEV infection remain 
ambiguous. Therefore, further studies are needed to estimate the 
epidemiological characteristics of HEV-related extrahepatic manifestations and to elucidate their underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.
