Abstract
Dysregulated autophagy may be a central player in trehe pathogenesis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) by inducing
autoimmune processes via abnormal expression of mitochondrial antigens such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, E2
component (PDC-E2) and also by inducing cellular senescence in biliary epithelial cells (BECs) in bile duct lesions in PBC.
We examined the association of an impaired “biliary bicarbonate umbrella” due to dysfunction of anion exchanger 2 (AE2)
with dysregulated autophagy and cellular senescence in PBC. The expression of AE2 was examined in cultured BECs
treated with bile acids such as glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC) and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), various
cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IFNγ, TNFα, TGFβ), and serum deprivation. The effect of AE2 knockdown using siRNA on
autophagy, cell surface expression of PDC-E2, and cellular senescence was also examined. The expression of AE2 and its
association with autophagy-related markers and senescent markers p16INK4a and p21WAF1/Cip1 were immunohistochemically
determined in livers taken from the patients with PBC (n = 50) and 69 control diseased and normal livers. The expression of
AE2 was significantly induced in the cultured BECs shortly treated with GCDC and other stresses, whereas it was
significantly decreased in senescent BECs induced by GCDC and other stresses (p < 0.05). Dysregulated autophagy, cell
surface expression of PDC-E2, and cellular senescence were significantly increased by knockdown of AE2 (p < 0.05). The
expression of AE2 was significantly decreased in cholangitis in PBC, compared to control livers (p < 0.05). The decreased
expression of AE2 was correlated with dysregulated autophagy, abnormal expression of PDC-E2, and cellular senescence in
bile duct lesions in PBC. In conclusion, an impaired biliary bicarbonate umbrella may be involved in the pathogenesis of
PBC by inducing dysregulated autophagy.
Introduction
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune cholestatic liver disease presenting with chronic, progressive
cholestasis, biliary fibrosis, and liver failure [1–3]. PBC is
characterized by a high frequency of serum antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) and unique cholangitis
in small bile ducts referred as chronic non-suppurative
destructive cholangitis (CNSDC) [1, 4]. Several genomewide association studies (GWAS) revealed that PBC is
associated with specific HLA and non-HLA genes relating
immune systems, such as T cell activation [5, 6]. However,
there are still many enigmas concerning the pathogenesis of
PBC. For example, how do AMAs play a role in the
pathogenesis of bile duct lesions [1–4, 7–9]? We previously
reported that dysregulated autophagy might be a central
player in the pathogenesis of bile duct lesions in PBC by
inducing autoimmune process via abnormal expression of
mitochondrial antigens and also cellular senescence in
biliary epithelial cells (BECs) in bile duct lesions in PBC
[10–18]. However, the mechanisms of dysregulated autophagy were not explored in our previous studies.
Accumulating evidence suggests that anion exchanger 2
(AE2) plays a central role in maintaining a “biliary bicarbonate umbrella” for protecting biliary mucosa and that
dysfunctional AE2 may be related to the pathogenesis of

PBC [19–22]. An impaired “biliary bicarbonate umbrella”
due to dysfunction of AE2 is supposed to be critical for the
toxicity of hydrophobic bile acids, such as glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC), and other stresses to BECs [19,
23]. For example, Ae2a,b-deficient mouse is reportedly
PBC model mice presenting serum AMA, increase of IgM,
progressive cholestasis, and portal inflammation [22].
Upregulation of miR-506 is reportedly related to the
decreased expression of AE2 in PBC [24].
We hypothesized that an impaired “biliary bicarbonate
umbrella” may be related to dysregulated autophagy, followed by abnormal expression of mitochondrial antigens
and cellular senescence in biliary epithelial lesions in
PBC. In this study, we examined the association of the
expression of AE2 and dysregulated autophagy, abnormal
expression of mitochondrial antigens, and cellular senescence in PBC.
Materials and methods
Culture study
Cell culture and treatments
Mouse intrahepatic BECs were isolated from 8-week-old
female BALB/c mice and were purified and cultured as
described previously [25]. The cell density of the cells was
less than 80% during experiments. In several experiments,
BECs were treated with GCDC, deoxycholic acid (DCA),
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), tauro-UDCA, Etoposid
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), and various cytokines (IL-4,
IL-13, IFNγ, TNFα, TGFβ) (R&D, Minneapolis, MN). In
some experiments, BECs were treated with serum deprivation
for induction of autophagy, as described previously [10].
Knockdown of AE2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
Validated siRNA for AE2 and negative control siRNA were
purchased from Santa-Cruz biotech (Santa-Cruz, CA, USA)
and QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany), respectively. One day before
transfection, BECs were plated in 35-mm dishes (5 × 105 cells)
or Lab-Tek chambers (5 × 104 cells/well), and then the cells
were transiently transfected with either AE2 or control siRNA
(100 nM) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Bafilomycin A1
(Baf, 5 nM) was used to assess autophagy flux.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the cells with a QIAGEN
RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After cDNA was synthesized, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to measure AE2 and βactin mRNA according to a standard protocol using the
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan).
Primers used are shown in Table 1. Each experiment was
performed twice in triplicate, and the mean was adopted in
each experiment.
Immunoblotting
The cell lysate samples (10 μg) were resolved by SDSPAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as
described previously. [26] After transfer, the membranes
were processed for immunoblotting as described previously
[26]. The primary antibodies used are shown in Table 2.
Densitometry of the resulting bands was performed using
Image-J software and normalized to the loading control.
Immunofluorescence staining for cultured cells
The BECs growing in a Lab-Tek chamber were fixed and
immunostained using the primary antibodies for AE2, PDCE2, LC3, or p62 (Table 2), as described previously [10]. A
similar dilution of the control mouse or rabbit Immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Dako) was applied instead of the primary antibody as a negative control. The cells were then
incubated with Alexa-488-labeled or Alexa-592-labeled
anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR)
for 30 min, counterstained with 10 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) and evaluated under a conventional
fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Assessment of cell-surface expression of mitochondrial
antigen
The cell-surface expression of PDC-E2 was detected in the
absence of membrane-perforating agent. Cultured BECs

treated with AE2 siRNA or control siRNA were fixed in
buffered 10% formalin, then immunostained with antiPDC-E2, as described previously [10]. The level of cell
surface mitochondrial antigen expression was evaluated
semiquantitatively by Image J software.
Assay for cellular senescence
SA-β-gal activity was detected by using the senescence
detection kit (Bio Vision, Mountain View, CA) according to
manufacturer’s protocol [27]. The proportion of senescent
cells in each condition was assessed at Day 4 by
counting the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells in at least
1 × 103 total cells using light microscopy. In addition,
cellular senescence was assessed by SenTraGorTM
system (Arriani pharmaceuticals, Attica, Greece) according
to manufacturer’s protocol [28]. This is a sensitive method
for identification of senescent cells using an analog of
Sudan Black B histochemical dye coupled with biotin
(GL13) [28].
Human study
Classification of intrahepatic biliary tree
The intrahepatic biliary tree is classified into intrahepatic
large and small bile ducts (septal and interlobular bile ducts)
by their size and distributions in the portal tracts [29]. Bile
ductules, which are characterized by tubular or glandular
structures with a poorly defined lumen and located at the
periphery of the portal tracts [29, 30], are not included in the
small bile ducts.
Liver tissue preparation
A total of 119 liver tissue specimens (all were biopsied or
surgically resected) were collected from the liver disease file
of our laboratory and affiliated hospitals. The Ethics
Committee of Kanazawa University approved this study.
The liver specimens in this study were 50 PBC, 8
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), 38 chronic viral
hepatitis (CVH), 10 livers with extrahepatic biliary
obstruction (EBO), and 13 “histologically normal” livers.
All PBC were from patients fulfilling the clinical, serological, and histological characteristics consistent with the
diagnosis of PBC [1]. PBC livers were staged histologically [1], and 25 and 15 of PBC were stages 1, 2 (early
PBC) and stages 3, 4 (advanced PBC), respectively.
Fifty PBC livers were divided into 38 CA3 (presence of
CNSDC) and 12 CA0-2 (absence of CNSDC),
respectively, according to Nakanuma classification [31].
Nineteen and 19 CVH were regarded as F0-2 and as
F3, 4, respectively [32]. Eight and 30 of CVH cases
were serologically positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
and anti-hepatitis C viral antibody, respectively. Causes of
EBO were obstruction of the bile duct at the hepatic hilum
or the extrahepatic bile ducts, because of stone or carcinoma, and the duration of jaundice was less than 1 month.
“Histologically normal” livers were obtained from surgically resected livers for traumatic hepatic rupture or
metastatic liver tumor. Normal liver tissues were obtained
from an area apart from the tumor, and carcinoma tissues
were not evaluated. Chemotherapy was not performed
before liver resection in all patients with histologically
normal liver.

Liver tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered
formalin, and embedded in paraffin. More than 20 serial
sections, 4 µm thick, were cut from each block. Several
sections were processed routinely for histologic study, and
the remainder was processed for the subsequent
immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry
We examined immunohistochemically the expression of
AE2 using the primary antibody shown in Table 2, as
described previously [14]. A similar dilution of the control
mouse or rabbit IgG (Dako) was applied instead of the
primary antibody as a negative control. Positive and
negative controls were routinely included. Histological
analysis was performed in a blinded manner. For the
assessment of AE2 expression in small bile ducts, the
extent of expression was evaluated as increase, no change,
and decrease, compared with small bile ducts in normal
liver.
Double immunofluorescence
We also performed double immunofluorescence for AE2
with autophagy related markers (LC3 and p62), senescent
markers (p16INK4a and p21WAF1/Cip1), and mitochondrial
antigen PDC-E2. Antibodies used are shown in Table 2. In
brief, either LC3, p62, PDC-E2, p16INK4a, or p21WAF1/Cip1
was detected using Vector Red Alkaline Phosphatase
Substrate Kit (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA), followed by
second staining for AE2 using Alexa-488-labeled antirabbit IgG. The sections were counterstained with
DAPI and evaluated under a conventional fluorescence
microscope.

less than 0.05, the difference was regarded as significant.
Results
Culture study
Increased expression of AE2 mRNA by GCDC, TUDCA, and
cytokines in BECs
We examined the mRNA expression level of AE2, in cultured
BECs treated with bile acids (GCDC, DCA, UDCA, tauroUDCA) and various cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IFNγ, TNFα,
TGFβ) for 4 h. Supplemental-Fig. 1 summarizes the data. The
expression of AE2 was significantly increased in cultured
BECs treated with GCDC, TUDCA, IL-4, and IL-13, compared with control (p < 0.05).
Decreased expression of AE2 mRNA in senescent BECs
induced by various stressors
Cellular senescence was induced by the treatment with Etoposid, serum deprivation, GCDC, and DCA, as reported
previously (Fig. 1a). The expression of AE2 was significantly
decreased in senescent BECs induced by GCDC and other
stresses in mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.05)(Fig. 1b, c).

PDC-E2, and cellular senescence using AE2 siRNA. An
effective knockdown of AE2 using siRNA was confirmed in
mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2a, b)
AE2 knockdown induced dysregulated autophagy Immunoblotting showed that autophagy was dysregulated in
BECs treated with AE2 siRNA, compared to control
siRNA. Expression of the autophagy marker, LC3-II, in
BECs with AE2 siRNA was greater than in BECs with
control siRNA (Fig. 2c). The expression of LC3-II
was further increased in the presence of Bafilomycin A1
in both BECs with AE2 siRNA and control siRNA
(Fig. 2c). The degree of increase was less in BECs
with control siRNA, compared to BECs with AE2
siRNA, indicating decreased autophagic flux by AE2
knockdown (Fig. 2c). The expression of autophagyrelated p62 was increased in BECs with AE2 siRNA,
compared to control siRNA, indicating dysregulated
autophagy (Fig. 2d).
Immunofluorescent staining disclosed that a granular
expression of LC3 and p62 was observed as dots in BECs
treated with AE2 siRNA, which suggests dysregulated
autophagy (Fig. 3e).
AE2 knockdown increased a cell-surface expression of PDCE2 The expression of mitochondrial antigen PDC-E2 was
absent on the surface of control BECs (Fig. 2f), whereas, the
cell-surface expression of PDC-E2 was increased on the
surface of BECs treated with AE2 siRNA (Fig. 2f). Semiquantitative analysis disclosed that the cell-surface
expression of PDC-E2 was significantly greater in BECs
by knockdown of AE2 using siRNA than BECs with
control siRNA (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2f). The cell-surface
expression of PDC-E2 was significantly increased by the
treatment with GCDC (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2f), as reported previously [12]. These findings suggest that dysregulated
autophagy caused by AE2siRNA may induce the increased
expression of mitochondrial antigen PDC-E2 on the cell
surface of BECs
AE2 knockdown induced cellular senescence Cellular
senescence assessed by SA-β-gal activity was significantly
increased by the knockdown of AE2 using siRNA
even in control culture condition (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2g). The
treatment with GCDC tended to further accelerate cellular
senescence, although there was no significant difference.
Cellular senescence assessed by SenTraGorTM system was
also significantly increased by knockdown of AE2 using
siRNA even in control culture condition (p < 0.01)
(Fig. 2h).

Discussion
The data obtained in this study are summarized as follows:
(1) the expression of AE2 was significantly increased in
cultured BECs treated with GCDC, TUDCA, IL-4, and IL13 for 4 h and it was significantly decreased in senescent
BECs induced by GCDC and other stresses; (2) AE2
knockdown using siRNA induced dysregulated autophagy,
cell surface expression of PDC-E2, and cellular senescence
in cultured BECs; (3) the expression of AE2 was significantly decreased in small bile ducts involved in CNSDC
in PBC, compared to control livers. In contrast, it was
significantly increased in small bile ducts in CVH, compared to PBC and other livers. (4) The decreased expression
of AE2 was correlated with abnormal expression of PDCE2, dysregulated autophagy, and cellular senescence in
PBC.
Several lines of studies indicated that AE2, the principal
bicarbonate secretor in the human biliary tree, is downregulated in PBC [19–22]. A recent study demonstrated that
downregulation of AE2 may sensitize BECs to apoptotic
insults activating soluble adenylyl cyclase [23]. However,
the mechanisms describing how downregulated AE2 participates in the pathogenesis of PBC have not been fully
clarified. In this study, we disclosed for the first time that
the decreased expression of AE2 might be involved in
dysregulated autophagy, followed by abnormal expression
of mitochondrial antigens and cellular senescence in BECs
in PBC (Fig. 5). We have previously reported that
dysregulated autophagy may be a central player in the
pathogenesis of PBC by inducing autoimmune process via
abnormal expression of mitochondrial antigens such as
PDC-E2 and also induction of cellular senescence in BECs
in bile duct lesions in PBC [10–18, 33]. In fact, abnormal
cell surface expression of mitochondrial antigen PDC-E2
was observed by dysregulated autophagy caused by GCDC
with and without Bafilomycin A [12]. Hydrophobic
bile acid such as GCDC, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress, and oxidative stress are candidate triggers of
dysregulated autophagy; however, the exact mechanism of
dysregulated autophagy was not elucidated in our previous
studies [10–12, 33].
The expression of AE2 was significantly reduced in
PBC, especially in the damaged small bile ducts involved in
CNSDC, in agreement with previous studies [21, 34].
Furthermore, this study disclosed for the first time that the
decreased expression of AE2 was closely correlated with
abnormal expression of PDC-E2 and autophagy-related

markers LC3 and p62. The present study also demonstrated
that AE2 knockdown effectively induced dysregulated
autophagy and cell surface expression of PDC-E2 in BECs.
These findings suggest that an impaired bicarbonate
umbrella caused by AE2 dysfunction may be involved in
dysregulated autophagy in the pathogenesis of PBC (Fig. 5).
It is conceivable that bile acid signaling may also participate in dysregulated autophagy and other pathophysiology
of BECs in PBC. Bile acid may regulate BECs through bile
acid nuclear receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), and
plasma membrane receptor TGR5 [35]. FXR suppressed
autophagy in hepatocytes, whereas nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) induced
autophagy [36]. In cholestatic livers, the accumulation of
bile acids caused the accumulation of autophagosomes via
suppressed autophagy flux and accumulation of p62 in
hepatocytes, although the signaling pathway including FXR
and TGR5 was undetermined [37]. It remains to be seen
how bile acids regulate autophagy and cause dysregulated
autophagy and which bile acid receptors participate in the
process in BECs in PBC.
Furthermore, this study demonstrates that AE2 knockdown effectively induced cellular senescence, in agreement
with a recent study [34]. Our group previously reported that
cellular senescence was caused via dysregulated autophagy
[10]; therefore, it is likely that cellular senescence may be
induced via dysregulated autophagy due to AE2 downregulation. Conversely, AE2 expression was decreased in
senescent BECs induced by GCDC, serum deprivation, and
other stresses. Since a short-term treatment with GCDC and
other several factors rather increased AE2 mRNA expression, chronic exposure to GCDC seems to be critical to
decrease AE2 expression together with the induction of
cellular senescence. It is conceivable that impairment of
bicarbonate umbrella, due to senescent BECs, further
exacerbates injuries of BECs (Fig. 5). It has not yet been
determined whether AE2 overexpression could prevent
dysregulated autophagy and cellular senescence and other
injuries in BECs caused by GCDC and other toxic agents.
In addition, it is now well known that senescent BECs
express various chemokines and cytokines as senescenceassociated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) in PBC and PSC,
which modulate inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis in
cholangiopathies, as our group reported for the first time
[17, 18, 38, 39]. Taken together, these studies indicate that
it is plausible that impairment of AE2 in parallel with cellular senescence may participate in the exacerbated
inflammation and other pathologic events via SASPs in
PBC.
It is of interest that allelic variations in AE2 gene have a
significant association with the progression rate of liver
disease in PBC under UDCA therapy in a previous study
[40]. Recent GWAS studies revealed several candidates of
susceptible genes/loci in PBC [5, 6]; however, AE2 has not
been identified as a susceptible gene, so far. Generally, most
susceptible genes/loci are HLA and non-HLA genes relating
adaptive and innate immunity such as cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors in PBC [5, 6]. There were few
genes/loci relating to the susceptibility/vulnerability of
BECs in PBC [5, 6]. Some ER stress-related genes, such as
ORM1-like protein 3 (ORMDL3), which are included in
susceptible genes/loci in PBC [5, 6], might be related to
autophagy of epithelial cells as suggested in inflammatory
bowel disease. Our previous study showed that ER stress
might be involved in dysregulated autophagy and cellular
senescence in BECs. Therefore, ER stress may be associated with an impairment of AE2 in BECs in PBC.
In conclusion, an impaired biliary bicarbonate umbrella
may be involved in dysregulated autophagy followed by
abnormal expression of PDC-E2 and cellular senescence in
BECs in PBC. Therapeutic strategies to relieve the
“impaired biliary bicarbonate umbrella” may be effective
for PBC.
