ABSTRACT
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious opportunistic infection, which has increasingly been
recognized as an emerging disease of nonneutropenic patients. In this group of patients,
the diagnosis of IA can be challenging owing
to the lack of specificity of symptoms, the
difficulty in discriminating colonization from
infection, and the lower sensitivity of microbiological and radiological tests compared with
immunocompromised patients. The aim of this
article is to present to clinicians a critical
review on the management of IA in non-neutropenic patients.

INTRODUCTION
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious opportunistic infection that continues to increase its
incidence in immunosuppressed or hospitalized
patients with severe underlying diseases, with
high rates of morbidity and mortality [1]. Over
the past decades, the population of patients
susceptible to develop IA has expanded significantly and IA has increasingly been recognized
as an emerging disease of non-neutropenic
patients with an incidence varying between
0.33–5.8% [2, 3]. In addition, the classical view
of IA has been modified, since various clinical
syndromes have been considered as a continuous spectrum of the disease, whose manifestations are defined by the complex interaction
between pathogen and host factors [4].
Invasive aspergillosis in non-neutropenic
patients is associated with bad prognosis, with
mortality rates exceeding 80%, mainly due to
delayed diagnosis [2, 3]. Difficulties in achieving a timely diagnosis of IA in non-neutropenic
patients is related to the non-specificity of
clinical presentation and to lower yields with
diagnostic tests compared to neutropenic
patients [2, 3].
The aim of this article is to present to clinicians a critical review on the recognition, risk
factors, microbiological and radiological diagnosis, and management of IA in non-neutropenic patients.

HOST RISK FACTORS
AND SPECTRUM OF DISEASE
Invasive aspergillosis has been traditionally
considered as an opportunistic infection mainly
occurring in patients with well-established risk
factors, such as neutropenia, hematologic
malignancies, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, solid organ transplantation, solid
cancer or HIV [5].
However, an increasing number of reports
have shown that Aspergillus spp. can cause
invasive disease in other categories of nonneutropenic patients, including those with
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) requiring high-dose steroid therapy,
with Child–Pugh C hepatic cirrhosis, and systemic diseases requiring immunosuppressive
therapy, including new monoclonal agents in
patients with autoimmune diseases [6].
An emerging broad group of patients who are
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) may
also be susceptible to IA [3, 7], with previously
reported rates varying widely from 0.017% to as
high as 6.9% [6, 8]. In addition to host underlying conditions (Table 1) [6], immunoregulatory abnormalities following critical illness can
induce a state of immunoparalysis, hampering
adequate host response to fungal disease in the
ICU [9]. Other predisposing risk factors frequently met in ICUs include acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, acute
renal failure, and H1N1 virus infection (especially if CS prior to ICU admission) [8]. Moreover, environmental factors including climatic
variables, airborne mold concentrations, geographic area, remodeling or construction works
and environmental quality of the air may
influence IA development [1].
The nature of the immune suppression (the
degree, duration, and type of immunodeficiency) influences the pathogenesis of disease.
IA thus manifests as a spectrum of disease
involving predominantly airway (tracheobronchitis), lung, or both. Another factor that makes
IA in non-neutropenic patients difficult to
diagnose is its non-specific symptomatology
that makes clinical manifestations of IA (e.g.,
fever, cough, purulent sputum) indistinguishable from other bacterial bronchopneumonia
[10]. Notably in previous studies, non-neutropenic patients have shown to be less

symptomatic than neutropenic patients
regarding fever as well as cough and chest pain
[3].
In this setting, clinical diagnosis of IA is a
challenge, and initiation of additional diagnostic examinations is often delayed because
clinical suspicion is low. Standard diagnostic
definitions by the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
have been developed but have been validated
only for patients with cancer or after
hematopoietic stem cell transplants and cannot
be extrapolated to non-neutropenic patients
[11]. Blot and colleagues validated a clinical
diagnostic algorithm that aims to discriminate
colonization from probable IA in ICU patients
with Aspergillus-positive endotracheal aspirate
cultures [12].
MICROBIOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS
The suspicion of invasive aspergillosis in nonneutropenic patients may be delayed because
paucisymptomatic disease is not uncommon
[3, 13, 14]. Another factor that makes invasive
aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients difficult to diagnose is its non-specific symptomatology that makes clinical manifestations of IA
(e.g., fever, cough, purulent sputum) indistinguishable from other bacterial bronchopneumonia [15]. A high index of suspicion is
required to successfully achieve a positive
diagnosis, and it is advisable to perform fungal
cultures and non-culture-based methods in all
patients with relevant risk factors who present
with an infectious complication. This recommendation would apply even if other agents
had already been isolated or even during
necropsy or because a positive culture result
might have been achieved accidentally (Fig. 1).
The cultures of lower respiratory tract are
easy and cheap and enable Aspergillus species to
be identified and their antifungal susceptibility
testing performed. However, cultures are slow
and their yield in respiratory sample is notoriously low, with a sensitivity ranging between
20% and 50% [16, 17]. In addition, the clinical
significance of isolating Aspergillus from respiratory samples remains unclear, because
differentiating true infection from simple colonization can be difficult [18]. Once the fungus is
detected in respiratory samples, experts in the
field should interpret the isolation in the clinical context of the patient and eventually start
antifungal therapy, if indicated.
In recent years, surrogate markers have been
developed for diagnosis of IA, based on the
detection of fungal cell wall component or
fungal DNA in clinical specimens. The Platelia
(Sanofi Diagnostic Pasterur, Marnes la Coquette,
France) sandwich-enzyme immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) for the detection of galactomannan (GM) is currently one of the more used
methods. It is based on the detection of circulating antigens in biologic fluids, such as serum,
urine, or BAL fluid [19, 20]. A meta-analysis
including 27 studies reported an overall sensitivity of serum galactomannan assay of 71%
and specificity of 89%. However, when oncohematological patients were excluded from the
analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of the
test dropped to 22% and 84%, respectively [21].
In a recent prospective study of IA in nonneutropenic patients, Zhou et al. found a sensitivity of serum GM of 37.8% and a specificity
of 87.1%, with a positive predictive value of
only 60.8% [22]. Other specimens, such as
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), have been proven to be more advantageous in the non-neutropenic population. At the index cutoff value
of 0.5, the test yielded a sensitivity up to 100%
and specificity ranging from 75% to 92%
[22, 23]. Although in hematological patients the
GM test may enable the early diagnosis of IA
[24, 25] and monitoring the treatment response
[26–28], further studies are mandatory in nonneutropenic patients since these aspects remain
to be determined in this population [29].
Another test is the 1-3-b-D-glucan assay, a
polysaccharide component of the cell wall of
many pathogenic fungi other than Mucoraceae
and Cryptococcus. Four previous meta-analyses,
mainly including patients with hematological
disease, reported a good sensitivity but a very
low specificity and positive predictive value for
the diagnosis of fungal infection [30–33]. In
contrast, its negative predictive value was as
high as 80–90%, thus making 1-3-b-D-glucan
Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:17–27 19

potentially useful to rule out the diagnosis of IA
rather than to confirm it [30–33].
However, because the significant heterogeneity in testing strategies, inclusion criteria,
and low number of patients, the role of this
biomarker in the diagnosis of IA in non-neutropenic patients is still unknown and future
studies appear to be appropriate. In addition,
detection is also limited by the high frequency
of false-positive results including semi-syntetic
b-lactam antibiotics, human blood components, cellulose hemodialysis, and exposure to
gauze [34]. A few studies have evaluated the role
of BDG in BAL, indicating a very low specificity
and positive predictive value (& 20%) for IA in
immunocompromised patients [35].
One test that reduces the time required to
diagnose invasive aspergillosis is the amplification of genetic material from Aspergillus spp.,
which detects genetic sequences (18S rDNA,
28SrDNA, 5.8 SrDNA, mithocondrial DNA) in
cultures as well as in direct clinical samples
within a few hours [34]. Unfortunately, PCR is
not yet universally standardized [36, 37], and
cannot yet be included as a mycological criterion in the EORTC/MSG guidelines [11]. In
addition, its usefulness in non-neutropenic
patients is not yet clear, although the
Fig. 1 Diagnostic and therapeutic approach in non-neutropenic patients with suspected IA
20 Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:17–27

information that has been reported seems to be
promising [38–41]. Theoretically, the test
should not be affected either by the immune
status of the patients or by the presence of other
fungal or bacterial pathogens.
With two positive consecutive results, this
kind of test has a specificity close to 95% with a
high positive likelihood ratio (LR 12.8) and
should be considered highly indicative of an
active Aspergillus spp. infection [37]; on the
other hand, a single negative PCR result is sufficient to exclude the diagnosis [42]. In addition, when combined with other fungal
biomarkers in serum (either GM or BDG) or in
BAL (GM), Aspergillus PCR has shown to
increase the diagnostic sensitivity up to 100%,
further supporting the implementation of this
technique in the revised definition of invasive
fungal infection by the EORTC/MSG. Experience with non-neutropenic patients is scarce,
but the efficacy of molecular techniques seems
to be similar to that for the population with
hematological malignancies [43]. Another
application of molecular biology techniques for
the diagnosis and treatment of invasive
aspergillosis is the ability to detect azole-resistant strains earlier than do conventional methods [44]. Finally, it is important to mention the
contribution of molecular techniques in genotyping fungal strains directly from clinical
samples.
Recently, a lateral flow device (LFD), detecting a glycoprotein antigen found in the serum
and BAL of patients with IA [45], has been
proposed as a new point-of care diagnostic
approach for also detecting IPA in non-hematological populations, including SOT and ICU
patients [46, 47]. A recent multicenter study
evaluating the LFD device in BAL from 133 ICU
patients showed a sensitivity, specificity, and
positive and negative predictive values for
probable IA of 80%, 81%, 96%, and 44%,
respectively [48]. However, despite such
promising results, further and larger studies are
warranted before safe conclusions on the performance of Aspergillus LDF can be reached. A
multicenter study evaluating the role of Aspergillus LFD as an alternative to GM in BAL fluid is
currently underway (clinicaltrial.gov identifier
NCT 02058316).
Finally, different technologies detecting
volatile organic compounds exhaled in the
breath of patients infected with IA have recently
been tested [49, 50], with a sensitivity ranging
from 94% to 100% and specificity form 83% to
93% [49, 50]. Also, other tests including gliotoxin, bis(methylthio)gliotoxin, have been
analyzed for diagnosing IA with interesting
results [51, 52]. Despite this, their role in nonneutropenic patients remains to be clarified and
additional analysis with a larger cohort of
patients are needed.
In conclusion, diagnosis of invasive
aspergillosis remains challenging because none
of the available diagnostic tests provides sufficient sensitivity and specificity alone, so the
optimal approach relies on the simultaneous
performance of several diagnostic strategies,
including cultures, fungal biomarkers and
molecular tools.
RADIOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS
Pulmonary lesions caused by Aspergillus spp. can
be responsible for a wide range of radiographic
findings, as with disease manifestations potentially mutating depending upon the immune
status of the host.
Chest radiographs are insensitive for detecting the earliest stages of pulmonary disease, but
computed tomography (CT) scans typically
demonstrate focal lesions. Several thoracic CT
patterns are associated with pulmonary
aspergillosis. Radiological patterns can be nonspecific in non-neutropenic patients [9]. Radiographic signs of IA can vary from a single
nodular lesions or larger masses to diffuse
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. The most typical
imaging findings including the halo sign and
the air crescent sign have shown high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (60–98%) in neutropenic patients. Nevertheless, both signs are
uncommon, have a lower sensitivity (5–24%)
and can be found even in non-infectious lesion
processes in non-neutropenic patients [53].
A large study that included neutropenic and
non-neutropenic patients showed that the more
specific signs (nodules and cavitation) were
infrequent, and that radiographic findings of
Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:17–27 21

consolidation, ground-glass infiltrates, and
pleural effusions were seen more commonly [3].
In addition, many ICU patients have radiologic
abnormalities masked by underlying acute processes (pleural effusion, atelectasis or ARDS) [9].
Of interest, airway-invasive or angio-invasive
radiological patterns have been described in
non-neutropenic heart transplant recipients
with IA and have been associated with different
presentations, time to diagnosis and mortality
rates [13].
Given the current limitations of CT, efforts
to improve diagnostic performance in pulmonary aspergillosis have been pursued. Highresolution CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)
can detect angio-invasion and vessel occlusion
signs (VOS). VOS has been shown to be superior
to classic CT signs observed in non-contrast
enhanced studies to diagnose invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised
patients, including those with hematologic
malignancies and other causes, with a sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.71 and a diagnostic
odds-ratio of 36.8 [54].
Combined anatomic and functional imaging
with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET) is slowly gaining a
foothold in the management of invasive fungal
infections [55]. In current clinical practice,
standalone FDG-PET/CT is not generally sufficient to differentiate IPA from malignancy or
other active inflammatory lesions, such as
active tuberculosis [55]. However, significant
different FDG-PET/CT patterns in invasive and
non-invasive forms of aspergillosis have been
described [56]. Invasive aspergillosis usually
presents with multiple hypermetabolic nodules
and a higher peak (SUV 4.5; range 1.3–8.9),
whereas non-invasive forms presents with isometabolic halo or nodule patterns with a relatively lower SUV peak value 1.6 (range 0.5–3.1)
[56].
In real clinical practice, radiologic follow-up
of aspergillosis is mostly carried out by serial CT
scans and represents a challenge. FDG PET/CT
has been found to be a valuable tool for early
evaluation of treatment response in aspergillosis, particularly in patients with underlying
pulmonary diseases (i.e., chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, previous TB, and cancer)
and for establishing the appropriate treatment
duration [57].
A recent study supported the use of a novel
probe for detection of A. fumigatus lung infection based on antibody-guided positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance
(immunoPET/MR). This promising imaging
technique seems to allow accurate, non-invasive and rapid detection of fungal lung infection
and discrimination of IPA from bacterial lung
infections and general inflammatory responses
[58].
In our opinion, the presence of a persistent
pulmonary infection despite broad-spectrum
antibiotics or abnormal thoracic imaging by CT
scanning together with one of the host risk
factors should trigger further diagnostic exploration through collection of respiratory secretions and/or laboratory markers. There is a
potential role of FDG/PET-TC for radiological
diagnosis and treatment monitoring in IA.
TREATMENT
Despite the many therapeutic options available
today, the mortality rate of IA in non-neutropenic patients continues to be as high as 90%
[6, 52], and is even higher than that reported in
the hematological population, likely reflecting
the lack of strategies of early diagnosis allowing
early appropriate therapy in this population [1].
Indeed, in contrast to neutropenic patients, no
consensus exists about the exact timeframe for
starting empirical therapy in patients at high
risk for Aspergillus infection and no microbiological evidence of IA [59].
In our opinion, non-neutropenic patients at
high risk of IA (i.e., COPD, steroids and
immunosuppressive therapy, hepatic failure,
and ICU-related immunoparalysis) should
receive adequate antifungal therapy upon suspicion of the fungal disease, even if a definitive
proof of infection is still not obtained. Whenever possible, a CT scan, fungal cultures and a
combination of serological biomarkers (GM,
Aspergillus PCR and 1,3-b-D-glucan assay, as a
screening strategy) should be performed and
treatment should be revised and eventually
withheld if the diagnosis of IA is not confirmed.
22 Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:17–27

As for antifungal drugs, there has been considerable research in antifungal drugs targeted
against IA over the past decade [16, 17, 60–62].
To date, the antifungal agents licensed for the
first-line treatment of IA include voriconazole
and isavuconazole or amphotericin B and its
lipid formulations [5]. The severity of the
infection, the clinical form, renal or hepatic
insufficiency, drug–drug interactions, requirement for therapeutic drug monitoring and its
cost are some of the factors that can help in
selecting the best drug.
During the last 10 years, voriconazole use
has progressively become widespread. The largest randomized trial for primary therapy of
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis demonstrated
that voriconazole was superior to amphotericin
B deoxycholate, followed by other licensed
antifungal therapy [63]. At week 12, successful
outcomes among non-neutropenic population
(31 patients) were observed in 50.0% of the
patients in the voriconazole group and in 31.6%
of those in the amphotericin B group. Moreover, patients treated with voriconazole had
significantly fewer adverse events that were
drug-related, except for transient visual disturbances. Therefore, the authors of this study
concluded that voriconazole was more beneficial for the treatment of IA than amphotericin
B.
Other series studying non-neutropenic
patients, with proven or probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, confirmed a favorable
response rate with voriconazole [64, 65]. Particularly remarkable is one study of pulmonary
and disseminated IA, including 103 non-neutropenic patients, in which receiving voriconazole treatment was found to be the only factor
associated with a reduced risk of death [1].
Because of better survival and improved
response of initial therapy with voriconazole,
this agent is now considered the drug of choice
for primary therapy of IA in most patients,
including non-neutropenic patients, by the
recent Clinical Practice Guidelines of the
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
(strong recommendation, high-quality evidence) [5].
Isavuconazole is a new triazole agent that
can be given once daily and offers a wider
spectrum of antifungal activity than voriconazole, including activity against most Mucorales
infections. In addition, the intravenous formulation does not include cyclodextrin, a
nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic compound,
which is included in the intravenous formulations of the other triazoles in order to increase
solubility. Compared to voriconazole, isavuconazole also has the advantages of linear and
predictable pharmacokinetics which is likely to
obviate the need for therapeutic drug monitoring and fewer CYP enzyme-mediated drug
interactions [66]. A large randomized, doubleblind trial has demonstrated non-inferiority or
isavuconazole versus voriconazole in terms of
all-cause mortality when used as primary treatment for invasive fungal disease caused by
Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi,
with a superior safety profile [16].
Another alternative for primary therapy is
represented by amphotericin B that was historically considered the mainstay of treatment for
IA before the introduction of voriconazole.
Development of lipid formulations improved
the poor tolerability associated with the
deoxycholate formulation, but the optimal
dosage remains unconfirmed [67].
All echinocandins have been shown to exert
in vitro and in vivo activity against Aspergillus
spp., but only caspofungin is approved for the
treatment of IA in patients who are intolerant to
first-line therapy [5].
Other azoles such as itraconazole or
posaconazole are considered as second line
agents for the treatment of IA, particularly in
severely ill patients [5]. Use of these drugs in
non-life-threatening infections where the
patient has been already stabilized with a more
potent agent has been described [64]. However,
their applicability in non-neutropenic patients
is limited because of scarce clinical experience,
poor oral bioavailability and restricted access to
the intravenous formulation [64]. A study
comparing intravenous posaconazole versus
voriconazole for primary therapy of invasive
aspergillosis is ongoing (clinicaltrial.gov identifier NTC 01782131).
Although still not approved, the other two
echinocandins (anidulafungin and micafungin)
are used in clinical practice, particularly when
Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:17–27 23

non-neutropenic patients are involved. In
breakthrough IA and in refractory disease,
combination therapy (e.g., echinocandin plus
voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B) may
be considered [5].
Adequate duration of antifungal therapy for
IPA is an unresolved issue. Recent IDSA guidelines recommend treatment for IPA to be continued for a minimum of 6–12 weeks [5],
depending on the clinical condition of the
patients, as well as the extent of resolution of
clinical disease. Different strategies including
clinical evolution, serum biomarkers and CT
scan should be considered for adequately
monitoring therapeutic response for IA.
Some authors, including us, believe that
emission tomography 18fluorodeoxygucose
could be a new useful tool for monitoring
response to IPA treatment [58, 68]. Although
this technique is not specific, it may be helpful
in monitoring clinical evolution of the patients,
especially when biomarkers and CT scan are not
enough.
CONCLUSION
There are several future challenges in the management of IA in non-neutropenic patients.
Since new immunosuppressive regimens and
ICU care are expected to continue increasing
the incidence of populations at risk of IA, new
criteria for diagnosis of IA in non-neutropenic
patients are needed. We believe that there could
be a potential role of FDG/PET-TC for treatment
monitoring in IA. More pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics data on antifungal agents in
non-neutropenic patients are needed to optimize drug exposure and to minimize adverse
events, especially in patients with underlying
severe disease and concomitant medications.
