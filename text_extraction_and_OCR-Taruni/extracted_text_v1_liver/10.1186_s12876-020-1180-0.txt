Abstract
Background: One major etiology of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) in China is the intake of
pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Since PAs-induced HSOS is a rare disease that has not been clearly characterized until
now, the aim of this study was to investigate clinical characteristics, CT features, and pathological findings of PAinduced HSOS.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 116 patients with PAs-induced HSOS and 68 patients with
Budd-Chiari syndrome from Jan 2006 to Sep 2016. We collected medical records of the patients, and reviewed
image features of CT, and analyzed pathological findings.
Results: Common clinical manifestations of PAs-induced HSOS were abdominal distention (98.26%), ascites (100%),
jaundice (52.94%), abdominal pain (36.36%). Abnormal liver function was observed in most of PAs-induced HSOS.
On CT scan, common findings included: ascites, hepatomegaly, the thickening of gallbladder wall, pleural effusion,
patchy liver enhancement, and heterogeneous hypoattenuation. Most of the patients had a low ascitic total protein
(< 25 g/L) and a high SAAG (≥ 11.0 g/L). In acute stage, pathologic features were massive sinusoidal dilatation,
sinusoidal congestion, the extravasation of erythrocytes, hepatocellular necrosis, the accumulation of macrophages,
the deposition of hemosiderin. In subacute stage, complete loss of pericentral hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilatation, the
deposition of pigment granules were observed.
Conclusions: The PAs-induced HSOS patients displayed distinct clinical characteristics, imaging features, and
pathological findings, which provided some evidences for the diagnosis of PAs-induced HSOS.
Trial registration: ChiCTR-DRD-17010709.

Background
Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS), also
known as veno-occlusive disease (VOD), is characterized
by damage to sinusoidal endothelium [1, 2]. A central pathogenic event is toxic destruction of hepatic sinusoidal/central
venous endothelial cells, and then the sloughed sinusoidal
lining cells embolize downstream and obstruct sinusoidal
flow [3, 4]. It results in the necrosis of hepatocytes and portal hypertension. In North America and Western Europe,
HSOS occurs most commonly in the patients who have
received cytoreductive therapy prior to hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT), or oxaliplatin-containing
chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma [3–6]. While, the
intake of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs)-containing herbals or
dietary supplement is a major etiology of HSOS in China
[7–10]. To date, more than 6000 plant species containing
PAs have been identified [11]. One of the most widely used
herbals containing PAs is gynura segetum (ie Tsuanqi) in

China [12–14].In view of the difference in the etiology of
HSOS, clinical profiles and imaging findings of HSOS associated with HSCT or oxaliplatin might be hardly extrapolated to PAs-induced HSOS. In addition, PAs-induced
HSOS is a rare disease and clinical manifestations of PAsinduced HSOS resemble other liver diseases. To get a better
understanding of PAs-induced HSOS, a large sample of the
patients (116 cases) with PAs-induced HSOS and the controls (68 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome) were enrolled
and relevant data were collected. Then, clinical profiles, CT
features, and pathological finding of PAs-induced HSOS
were investigated in our study.
Methods
Study population
In this study, we collected 116 patients with PAs-induced
HSOS at Union Hospital and Tongji Hospital affiliated to
Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and
Technology (HUST) from Jan 2006 to Sep 2016. For PAsinduced HSOS, diagnostic criteria were (i) the patients met
the modified Seattle criteria for HSOS (at least 2 of the following: hyperbilirubinemia (> 34.2 μmol/L), hepatomegaly or
right upper quadrant pain, ascites and > 2% weight gain due
to fluid accumulation) (ii) meeting the criteria for druginduced liver injury [Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment
Method (RUCAM) score > 5] [15, 16]; (iii) a history of ingestion of PAs [13, 14, 17–20]. A history of ingestion of PAs is
essential in defining PAs-induced HSOS. All the enrolled patients ingested PAs-containing gynura segetum (ie Tsuanqi)
in our study. Other possible etiologies of liver injury, such as
viral, alcohol, drug, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Budd–
Chiari syndrome (BCS), congestive heart diseases, autoimmune liver diseases, were evaluated and excluded carefully
(Fig. 1).
PAs-induced HSOS patients should be differentiated from
HSCT-related HSOS, or oxaliplatin-induced HSOS. Fortunately, the incidence of HSCT-related HSOS, or oxaliplatininduced HSOS is very low in China, and medical history
provides a definite evidence for differential diagnosis. Importantly, PAs-induced HSOS should be discriminated from
Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS). Thus, 68 patients with BCS
were enrolled in our study (Fig. 1). Budd-Chiari syndrome is
defined as hepatic venous outflow obstruction at any level
from the small hepatic veins (HVs) to the junction of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the right atrium, regardless of the
cause of obstruction [1, 2, 21]. Digital subtraction angiography was performed in the enrolled BCS patients. Approval
for this retrospective study was obtained from our college
ethics committee, and the requirement for informed consent
was waived.
Data collection
The pertinent data of the patients were extracted from
the medical records and tabulated in a database, which
included the information about demographic data; presenting symptoms and signs; medical history; laboratory
tests (blood test, ascitic examination); pathological
changes, therapeutic process.

Imaging technique and imaging analysis
All CT examinations were performed with one of the
following three scanners: 64-detector spiral row scanner
(Somatom Definition AS, Siemens, Germany), 32-
detector row dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Definition, Siemens, Germany), 320-detector row dynamic
volume CT (Aquilion ONE 640, Toshiba, Japan).
Contrast-enhanced CT was performed after the injection
of contrast medium (iohexol, GE Healthcare Co. Ltd.,
China; lopromide, Bayer Healthcare Co. Ltd., China;
Loversol, Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd., China). Images
were obtained in arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium
phases, respectively, with 25–30 s, 55–70 s, and 90–110 s
after the injection of contrast medium. All CT images
were reviewed in consensus by two experienced observers blinded to clinical data.
Animal models of PAs-induced HSOS
All animals were maintained under specific pathogenfree conditions at Laboratory Animal Center, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, China. Animals
were housed individually in open ventilated cages with
distilled water ad libitum until study started. Room
temperature was monitored and maintained at 20–26 °C
with the light cycle set at 12 h. Monocrotaline (MCT)-
treated rats, senecionine-treated mice were used as experimental models of PAs-induced HSOS [22–24]. Male
Sprague Dawley rats (weight: 200–220 g) were obtained
from Laboratory animal center, Huazhong University of
Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). For MCTtreated rats, the rats (n = 32) were fasted 12 h, and then
the rats were gavaged with monocrotaline (90 mg/kg,
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, n = 16) or PBS (n = 16)
[22, 25, 26]. C57BL/6 male mice were purchased from
Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co.
Ltd. (Beijing, China). In mouse model of senecionine- induced HSOS, male C57BL/6 mice (8-week-old, n = 32)
were fasted 12 h, and then the mice were gavaged with
senecionine (100 mg/kg, Cayman chem., Ann Arbor,
Michigan, n = 16) or PBS(n = 16) [18, 23, 24, 27]. All
animals were euthanized by barbiturate overdose. All the
animals have received human care in compliance with
the institutional animal care guidelines.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were presented as means and
standard deviation and categorical variables as numbers
and percentage. Independent-samples t-test was used for
the analysis of differences between the two groups. The
interobserver agreement for assessment of imaging findings was determined using the κ-statistic. The level of
agreement was defined as follows: poor, κ < 0.20; fair,
−values of 0.2 < κ ≤ 0.40; moderate, 0.4 < κ ≤ 0.60; good,
0.6 < κ ≤ 0.80; and very good, 0.8 < κ ≤ 1.0. A P value less
than .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Results
Clinical presentation
In this study, 116 patients with a diagnosis of PAsinduced HSOS were enrolled in our study. The mean
ages of the PAs-induced HSOS patients were 56.92 ±
12.39 years. In PAs-induced HSOS patients, there were
78 males and 38 females, with a male-to-female ratio of
2.05:1. It indicated that the patients with older age and
male gender were frequently affected. Then, clinical
manifestations of these patients were evaluated. 98.26%
(113/115) of the cases had abdominal distension, a small
proportion (36.36%, 40/110) of the PAs-induced HSOS
patients had right upper quadrant pain. Meanwhile, our
study revealed edema in 39.45% (43/109) of the cases,
jaundice in 52.94% (54/102) and weight gain in 15.53%
(16/103) of the patients. While, 69.12% (47/68) of the
BCS patients had abdominal distension, right upper
quadrant pain in 19.12% (13/68) of the cases, edema in
38.24% (26/68) of the cases.

examination of the patients was investigated. Generally,
the values of erythrocyte and leukocyte were in normal
limit in the PAs-induced HSOS patients (Table 1); the
value of platelet was lower than the lower limit of normal in 46.81% of the patients. Then, the parameters of
clinical chemistry including a panel of liver functional
tests and renal function were evaluated. The median
levels of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP and GGT) and
total bilirubin exceeded upper limit of normal range in
the PAs-induced HSOS patients. Simultaneously, synthetic ability of liver was damaged in most of PAsinduced HSOS patients, which was revealed by the abnormality of albumin and PT. While, biomarkers of
renal function indicated by urea and creatinine showed
that most of the HSOS patients had normal renal function (Table 1). In addition, blood routine examination
and clinical biochemistry were analyzed in the controls
(BCS patients) and the results showed most of BCS patients had normal blood routine examination and normal liver function, which was demonstrated by liver
function test (Table 1).
Recently, new EBMT criteria for severity grading of
HSOS in adults have been established. In clinical practice, the severity of HSOS is classified by five factors
containing bilirubin, liver function enzymes, weight gain,
renal function and rate of change [4, 28]. Thus, we evaluated the severity in the PAs-induced HSOS patients
using new EBMT criteria. ALT exceeding 8 times the
ULN was observed in 13.86% of the cases (Table 2). Besides this, similar pattern was observed in the level of
AST, total bilirubin and creatinine (Table 2). Further
study showed that 22 (21.15%) patients with mild HSOS,
31(29.81%) patients with moderate HSOS, 21 (20.89%)
patients with severe HSOS; 30 (28.85%) patients with
very severe HSOS.
Ascites analysis
Since ascites is the most common clinical presentation of
PAs-induced HSOS, some of the patients received abdominal
paracentesis and the results of ascitic fluid analysis were collected. Firstly, we analyzed ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP)
and serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). Ascitic fluid
total protein (AFTP) belonged to transudate (< 25 g/L) in
74.64% of the patients;100% of the patients had a high SAAG
(≥ 11.0 g/L) (Table 3). Secondly, an ascitic fluid cell count
and differential were analyzed. An ascitic fluid WBC counts
was 134.11 ± 135.62; 100% of the PAs-induced HSOS patients had an ascitic polymorphonuclear (PMN) less than
0.25 × 109
/L, which indicated that no ascitic fluid infection
occurred in the patients (Table 3). Finally, 41 cases received
cytological examination of ascites. The results revealed that
lymphocyte and mesothelial cells were main findings in the
patients (Table 3). However, only 8 patient with BCS received ascitic fluid analysis in our study and the results of
three samples were available, thus the results of ascitic fluid
analysis in BCS patients was not shown in our study.
Imaging findings of contrast CT in the PAs-induced HSOS
patients
Table 4 illustrated radiographic signs seen on contrastenhanced CT in HSOS patients. Firstly, we determined the
findings of pre-contrast CT in the PAs-induced HSOS patients. Ascites, global enlargement of the liver, gallbladder
wall thickening, pleural effusion were common signs of PAsinduced HSOS (Table 4); while, a few of the patients
(25.32%) had splenomegaly. Secondly, we further analyzed
the imaging features of contrast-enhanced CT. On contrastenhanced CT, patchy liver enhancement (93.67%) and heterogeneous hypoattenuation (100%) in portal-venous phase

were two most common radiologic findings (Table 4). Heterogeneous hypoattenuation represented heterogeneous
hypoattenuated, or low-density areas; patchy liver enhancement was liver parenchyma adjacent to heterogeneous
hypoattenuation appeared inhomogeneous enhancement
(Fig. 2). In equilibrium phase of contrast CT, narrowing of
right hepatic vein and narrowing of inferior vena cava were
common signs (Table 4).
Histology
Most of PAs-induced HSOS patients did not receive percutaneous liver biopsy due to ascites, thrombocytopenia,
and coagulation disorders. In addition, the expense and
the unavailability of facility confined the application of
transjugular biopsy in our hospitals. Thus, only 12 patients received biopsy procedure in our study, and PAsinduced SOS exhibited different pathological features.
The patients received liver biopsy within 1–3 months
after the initial presentation. The results of liver functional tests at the time of the liver biopsy were shown in
Additional file 1: Table S1. Pathological features of the
PAs-induced HSOS patients varied from early changes
to subacute changes. In acute phase of PAs-induced
HSOS (6 cases), liver biopsy showed massive sinusoidal
dilatation and sinusoidal congestion predominantly in
zone 3 accompanied by the extravasation of erythrocytes
into space of Disse. In addition, we found hepatocellular
necrosis, the accumulation of macrophages (Fig. 3a). In
subacute stage (6 cases), important features of histopathology were the complete loss of pericentral hepatocytes,
sinusoidal dilatation, the deposition of hemosiderin
derived from destructive erythrocytes (Fig. 3b). The extravasation of erythrocytes and excessive deposition of
collagen were not observed (Fig. 3b). The infiltration of

inflammatory cells was not obvious in acute and subacute stage.
To confirm the findings, animal models of PAsinduced HSOS were created through the administration
of gynura segetum. Seneciphylline, senecionine are
major compounds in Gynura segetum [24, 29]; animal
models of gynura segetum-induced HSOS should be created through the administration of seneciphylline and/or
senecionine. Unfortunately, seneciphylline is not available commercially. Thus, mouse model of gynura
segetum-induced HSOS were established through
administration of senecionine. 24 h after the administration, pathological features of mouse liver were similar to
those of acute HSOS patients (Fig. 3d). Ten days later,
senecionine-treated mice recovered by themselves. To
mimics the human injury, low-dose senecionine was repeatedly injected into mice in our study. However, most
of treated animals died or animal models of PAsinduced HSOS were not established unsuccessfully.
Then, PAs-induced HSOS were created through the administration of monocrotaline. 48 h after the treatment
of monocrotaline, pathological features of rat liver resembled those of acute patients with PAs-induced HSOS
(Fig. 3e). At 2 weeks after the administration of monocrotaline, we found the complete loss of pericentral hepatocytes, sinusoidal dilatation and the extravasation of
erythrocytes in rat liver, which indicated some of pathological changes in rat model resembled pathological
features of subacute PAs-HSOS patients (Fig. 3f). In
addition, chronic model of monocrotaline-induced
HSOS was not created successfully through repeated administration of low-dose monocrotaline.
Follow-up
In this study, follow-up data of the patients were collected.
At the end of 2-year follow-up, 38% (44/116) of the patients (34 patients lost to follow-up, 10 patients with < 2
years of follow-up) should be excluded; 44 patients survived, 28 patients died. Then, baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups (survival group and death group)
were determined and summarized (Table 5). Unfortunately, significant differences were not observed in liver
functional tests and renal function between the survival
group and the death group. It probably resulted from
small sample size. Thus, a prospective multi-center study
should be performed to determine the prognosis of the
PAs-induced HSOS patients.
Discussion
Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) is a rare
vascular disease of the liver. Sometimes, HSOS is caused
by the intake of PA-containing herbs. To get a better understanding of PAs-induced HSOS, a large sample of the
patients (116 cases) with PAs-induced HSOS were
enrolled and we analyzed clinical profiles of PAs-related
SOS in China. In China, PAs-containing plants were
soaked in liquid, such as water, tea, liquor and etc., and
the patients took the liquid containing PAs; thus, we did
not calculate the dosage of PAs precisely. Give this, we did
not determine the correlation between total dosage of PAs
and the severity of the diseases. In addition, the duration
between the use of Tusanqi and first onset of clinical
symptoms ranged from 2 days to 2 years; therefore, we did
not distinguish acute stage from subacute/chronic diseases. Some of the patients with first-episode presentation
received liver biopsy and the histology showed sub-acute
pathological features. The patients with older age and
male gender were frequently affected. In China, old people
trust the effect of Chinese herbals, so the intake of PAscontaining plants occurred frequently to the patients with
older age. Furthermore, metabolic activation of hepatotoxic PAs by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play a key
role in PA-induced liver toxicities. Since hepatic expression of CYP3A1/2 in female rats is lower than that in
males, male animals may be more susceptible to PAinduced toxicity than female animals [30–32].
In view of these, we determined clinical manifestations, CT findings, and pathological features of the
whole PAs-induced HSOS patients. Common clinical
manifestations of PAs-induced HSOS were: ascites
(100%), hyperbilirubinemia (52.94%), and hepatomegaly
(76%). Meanwhile, a panel of liver function tests demonstrated that most of PAs-induced HSOS patients had abnormal liver function. Importantly, we assessed the
severity of PAs-induced HSOS patients for the first time,
which is useful to identify the patients requiring early
therapeutic intervention. The resulted revealed that most
of PAs-induced HSOS patients was in mild or moderate
stage, which indicated that most of the patients who received routine treatment had good prognosis. While,
clinical manifestations of PAs-induced HSOS mimic
other liver disorders, and clinical manifestations did not
provide definitive evidence in the diagnosis of PAsinduced HSOS.
In western countries, HSOS occurs most commonly in
HSCT, or oxaliplatin -containing chemotherapy, and
some studies described their clinical characteristics and
pathological features. Previous studies demonstrated
weight gain (90%), upper abdominal pain (95%), jaundice
(80%) were common clinical manifestations of HSOS
following HSCT; only 35% of the patients had ascites
[33].In addition, raised ALT, AST and ALP level were
observed in the HSOS patients following HSCT [33]. In
addition, some researchers reported that clinical manifestations of the patients appear to be mild or absent in
the HSOS patients who received oxaliplatin-contained
chemotherapy, and the level of ALT, AST, total bilirubin
was in normal range [34–36]. Most of the patients were

identified through imaging modality and/or histological
examination. It indicated that clinical characteristics of
HSOS correlated with the etiology of HSOS which was a
determinant of the severity in the patients with HSOS.
One of clinical characteristic in PAs-induced HSOS is
ascites, thus, we initially collected the results of ascitic
fluid analysis. The result showed transudate (< 25 g/L) in
74.64% of the patients and high SAAG (≥ 11.0 g/L) in
100% of the patients. Most of the patients (95–100%) with
cardiac ascites had high ascitic fluid total protein concentration (AFTP, ≥25 g/L) [37, 38]. It indicated that ascites
in PAs-induced HSOS belonged to portal hypertensionrelated ascites; diagnostic efficacy of SAAG was superior
to that of the exudate-transudate concept. No ascitic fluid
infection occurred in PAs-induced HSOS patients, which
revealed by ascitic fluid PMN counts.
The common features of dynamic CT in the PAsinduced HSOS patients contained: ascites, hepatomegaly,
gallbladder wall thickening, pleural effusion, hepatic vein
narrowing, patchy liver enhancement, and heterogeneous hypoattenuation. In HSOS patients after HSCT,
hematomegaly, periportal edema, ascites, and narrowing
of right hepatic vein were common findings of CT [39,
40]. Heterogeneity of liver parenchyma was observed in
the patients of colorectal cancer who had recieved
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy [34, 41]. All these indicated that the disparity in imaging findings of contrastenhanced CT attributed to the etiology in the patients
with HSOS. The etiology of HSOS is an important determinant of the severity, which may result in the difference in radiologic findings of contrast-enhanced CT.
More importantly, CT sign of Budd-Chiari syndrome
was analyzed, imaging features of BCS patients were
described in our previous study [14]. To avoid self plagiarism, imaging signs were not provided in our
manuscript.
Histological examination provided a definitive evidence of PAs-induced HSOS. However, liver biopsy
was invasive and difficult to perform in routine practice due to thrombocytopenia, clotting abnormalities
and extensive ascites. We firstly demonstrated PAsinduced HSOS exhibited different pathological features upon different phases. In acute stage, sinusoidal
congestion, sinusoidal dilation, the necrosis of hepatocytes and the extravasation of erythrocytes in zone 3
were the characteristics of PAs-induced HSOS. In
addition, macrophages infiltrated into the space of
Disse, and engulfed erythrocytes. Sequentially, macrophages degraded the hemoglobin in erythrocytes, producing hemosiderin. Thus, important pathological
changes in PAs-induced HSOS was the infiltration of
macrophages and the deposition of hemosiderin. In
sub-acute stage, pathologic examination showed
complete loss of pericentral hepatocytes, sinusoidal
dilatation, the deposition of pigment granules. Thus,
it indicated that histological findings of PAs-induced
HSOS were variable, depending upon the stages and
the severity. In addition, different phases of pathological changes (early changes vs subacute changes)
were observed when the patients shared similar periods from onset of illness. The varieties of pathological manifestations depend on age, the PAs dose,
the period, and individual variation.
In clinical practice, PAs-induced HSOS should be
considered when the patients presented with abdominal distension, jaundice, ascites, hepatomegaly. Firstly,
a detailed drug-use history should be obtained. The
detection of pyrrole protein adducts (PPAs) is essential for a diagnosis of PA-induced HSOS when PAs
exposure is obscure. Then, dynamic enhancedcontrast CT scanning and/or MRI examination should
be performed in all suspected patients. If typical signs
of PA-induced HSOS are discovered, then the diagnosis can be confirmed [13, 14, 19, 42, 43]. Other
chronic liver diseases, such as BCS, decompensated
cirrhosis, cardiac insufficiency, should be excluded. In
guideline of pyrrolizidine alkaloid-induced HSOS
issued by Chinese Society of Gastroenterology Committee, supportive symptomatic treatment is the basic
PA–HSOS treatment regimen. Anticoagulant therapy
should be started as soon as possible in acute/subacute stage patients after ruling out contraindications
TIPS should be considered when the patients do not
respond to medical treatment [42]. Public education
programs on potential harms of PAs-containing plants
should be developed through five media (newspapers,
TV, the internet, radio, and magazines). Thus, the ingestion of PA-containing plants should be prohibited
due to the toxicity of PAs.
Obviously, our study had several limitations. Firstly, it
was retrospective study, not prospective study. Selection
bias occurred in retrospective cohort studies. Secondly,
liver biopsy was not performed in most of the patients;
therefore, histological evidences were not available in most
of the patients. A small sample of liver biopsy, sampling
variability and patchy distribution might result in the bias.
Thirdly, some of the relevant data of the patients were not
available. Finally, follow-up data could not be provided
since retrospective study involved 11-year span.
Conclusions
In conclusion: the PAs-induced HSOS patients displayed distinct clinical characteristics, imaging signs, and pathological
features compared with HSOS associated with HSCT and
oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy. Further studies should
be performed to explore histological changes based on large
samples, develop suitable therapeutic strategies, and investigate the prognosis in future.
