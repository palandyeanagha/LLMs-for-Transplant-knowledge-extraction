Abstract
Objective This study describes the first empirical head-tohead comparison of EQ-5D-3L (3L) and EQ-5D-5L (5L)
value sets for multiple countries.
Methods A large multinational dataset, including 3L and
5L data for eight patient groups and a student cohort, was
used to compare 3L versus 5L value sets for Canada,
China, England/UK (5L/3L, respectively), Japan, The
Netherlands, South Korea and Spain. We used distributional analyses and two methods exploring discriminatory
power: relative efficiency as assessed by the F statistic, and
an area under the curve for the receiver-operating characteristics approach. Differences in outcomes were explored
by separating descriptive system effects from valuation
effects, and by exploring distributional location effects.
Results In terms of distributional evenness, efficiency of
scale use and the face validity of the resulting distributions,
5L was superior, leading to an increase in sensitivity and
precision in health status measurement. When compared
with 5L, 3L systematically overestimated health problems
and consequently underestimated utilities. This led to bias,
i.e. over- or underestimations of discriminatory power.
Conclusion We conclude that 5L provides more precise
measurement at individual and group levels, both in terms
of descriptive system data and utilities. The increased
sensitivity and precision of 5L is likely to be generalisable
to longitudinal studies, such as in intervention designs.
Hence, we recommend the use of the 5L across applications, including economic evaluation, clinical and public
health studies. The evaluative framework proved to be
useful in assessing preference-based instruments and might
be useful for future work in the development of descriptive
systems or health classifications.
Key Points for Decision Makers
EQ-5D-5L (5L) is superior to EQ-5D-3L (3L) with
respect to various measurement properties, enabling
improvements in sensitivity and precision in health
status measurement.
5L provides more precise measurements than 3L at
individual and group levels, both in terms of
responses to EQ-5D items and the resultant utilities.
3L systematically overestimates health problems
when compared with 5L, leading to biased utilities.
5L is recommended for use across applications,
including economic evaluation, clinical studies,
quality of care and in public health studies.

1 Introduction
Since the introduction of the original EQ-5D descriptive
system in 1990 [1] and the first value set in 1997 [2], the
EuroQol Group has continuously furthered research aimed
at enhancing the instrument [3, 4]. This entailed refining
the descriptive system, developing new valuation
methodology and also developing new EQ-5D instruments
for specific use. Examples of the latter include the childfriendly EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-Y) as a more comprehensible instrument suitable for children and adolescents
[5, 6], and the exploration of EQ-5D versions with one or
two additional dimensions to the descriptive system [7–10].
Arguably, the biggest change has been in refining the
‘granularity’ of the five dimensions by replacing the three
response options (levels) of the original EQ-5D (now ‘EQ5D-3L’) with five levels. The official EQ-5D-5L descriptive system (for convenience we use the term ‘5L’ from
here) has been available since 2011 [11] and is currently
available in more than 150 translations and multiple modes
of administration [12]. In parallel, a new valuation protocol
for the 5L was developed (EQ-VT) to establish new
country-specific value sets, warranting a high level of
standardisation and quality control as well as introducing
new and improved valuation methods [13, 14].
Several studies have compared the descriptive systems
of EQ-5D-3L (for convenience we use the term ‘3L’ from
here) and 5L in terms of their measurement properties,
including distributional characteristics such as ceiling
effects and evenness, reliability and various types of
validity [15–22]. Most studies showed that the 5L
descriptive system had better or at least similar measurement properties compared with 3L, but two remarks apply.
First, we must establish whether the increased descriptive
richness of 5L will increase measurement precision rather
than measurement error, as this a trade-off. Further, considering that the EQ-5D is a preference-based instrument, it
is essential also to investigate whether the increased
descriptive richness translates into increased sensitivity of
its utility-based index values (hereafter ‘utility values’ or
‘utilities’); again, error may increase due to the increased
difficulty in valuing more refined health states. The final
question is whether the combined descriptive and valuation
effects of 5L improve the discriminatory potential of the
utility instrument in, for example, the estimation of qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) in economic evaluation. As
the measurement of health status with the descriptive system is independent from the derivation of utility values and
involves different methodologies, improved sensitivity and
discrimination of the descriptive system does not necessarily translate into better discriminatory power using
utilities (comparing groups or comparing pre- and postintervention health state). For economic evaluation (e.g.
cost-utility analysis), improved discriminatory performance of the utility values would represent a major
advantage.
To compare the performance of 3L and 5L in terms of
QALYs gained, longitudinal patient-level data on both 3L
and 5L in one or multiple study populations would be
preferred. In the absence of such longitudinal data we
compared 3L and 5L using data from a large multi-country
cross-sectional survey, applying country-specific value sets
for seven countries.
We first compared the distributional characteristics of
the observed utility values by value set, and standard
descriptive statistics by condition group and value set. Our
main analysis consisted of two tests of discriminatory
power. In order to further clarify and explain the results, we
performed an exploratory analysis to determine the factors
responsible for certain patterns in the results. In this analysis, a clear distinction was made between differences
caused by descriptive system results and by the utility
values applied to the descriptive data. The separation of
descriptive and valuation effects has proven to be of use in
an earlier study exploring differences in utilities derived
from different preference-based instruments [23]. We
introduce an evaluative framework consisting of a novel
combination of non-parametric methods to establish
increased measurement refinement (if any), with parametric methods to demonstrate improved discrimination (if
any); 5L is only better than (rather than ‘different from’)
3L if (1) more response levels are efficiently used without a
decrease of uniformity of the distribution and (2) this
increased use is not offset by more measurement error, both
in terms of description and valuation.
Our study had two research questions: (1) Do 5L value
sets perform better than 3L value sets in terms of discriminatory power, as a direct result of the improved
descriptive sensitivity? (2) What are the underlying factors
affecting this performance? Our approach allowed us to
make normative assessments on the performance of both
instruments and to offer recommendations to users of EQ5D instruments.
2 Methods
2.1 Paired EQ-5D-3L–EQ-5D-5L (3L–5L)
Descriptive Data
A large multinational dataset that included paired
descriptive 3L and 5L data for eight patient groups and a
student cohort was used [15, 24]. These data were obtained
with the standard 3L and 5L versions for self-report use in
adults, describing health on the dimensions of mobility,
676 M. F. Janssen et al.

self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The 3L version applied the level descriptors (or
labels) ‘no problems’, ‘some/moderate problems’ and
‘extreme problems/unable to’, and the 5L version used ‘no
problems’, ‘slight problems’, ‘moderate problems’, ‘severe
problems’ and ‘extreme problems/unable to’. For mobility,
the most severe response option was changed from ‘confined to bed’ for 3L to ‘unable to walk about’ for 5L. The
3L classification describes 243 unique health states (or
health profiles) that are often reported as vectors ranging
from 11111 (full health) to 33333 (worst health), whereas
the 5L defines 3125 unique health states, with 55555 as the
worst health state.
Paper-and-pencil versions of the questionnaires were
used in all countries except in England where data collection took place online. Since there were many conditionspecific subgroups with small sample sizes, it was decided
to combine related patient groups, resulting in nine main
condition groups. Only respondents who completed both
the 3L and 5L1 without any missing responses were
included in the analyses (a 3L–5L comparison of missing
values is reported elsewhere [15]). It was assumed that
within a specific condition group country differences were
not important so that descriptive data could be pooled.
2.2 Paired 3L–5L Value Sets
At the time of this study there were seven countries with
both 3L and 5L value sets available, namely Canada,
China, England/UK (5L/3L, respectively), Japan, The
Netherlands, South Korea and Spain [2, 25–37]. All EQ-5D
value sets were obtained using representative samples of
the general public, ensuring that they represented the
societal perspective. A value set is a set of weights that can
convert each health state into an index value on a scale
anchored at 1 (referring to full health) and 0 (referring to a
state as bad as being dead), allowing for negative values
for health states considered to be worse than dead. Most 3L
valuation studies followed similar protocols, although there
were notable differences with regard to the sampling of
respondents (affecting representation), sample size and
health state design (varying from 17 to 101 valued health
states) [38, 39]. All 3L valuation studies were performed
with face-to-face interviews and paper-and-pencil methods
except for Canada where a web survey was used. All 3L
value sets were based on time trade-off (TTO) data. With
the introduction of 5L a standardised valuation protocol
was developed, the EQ-VT (EuroQol Valuation Technology Platform) [13]. In addition to standardisation in terms
of health state design, valuation methodology and a
computer-assisted personal interview mode of administration, a strict protocol of interviewer training and quality
control during the entirety of the data collection process
was developed and implemented [14]. Discrete choice
experiment (DCE) methodology was introduced in the EQVT, along with composite TTO as the main valuation
method. Since there is no standardised analytic protocol,
some 5L value sets were based on hybrid models utilising
both TTO and DCE data while others were based on TTO
data only. After the initial valuation studies were performed using EQ-VT version 1.0 (Canada, China, England,
The Netherlands, Spain) some data quality issues and
interviewer effects were apparent and a cyclic quality
control process was introduced in version 1.1, which led to
a substantial improvement [14].
Usually country-specific utility values are used to conduct analyses in a population or patient sample from that
particular country, reflecting the appropriate preferences.
Since our research questions were of a methodological
nature, aiming at making generalisations across value set
characteristics, we used the pooled multi-country dataset to
compare the characteristics of 14 country-specific 3L and
5L value sets.
2.3 Analyses
2.3.1 3L and 5L Value Sets for Seven Countries
Characteristics of all value sets were reported in terms of
model parameters and model characteristics, such as the
modelled value range, intercept, interaction parameters and
histograms of all possible values (3L: 243; 5L: 3125),
which may be responsible for differences in performance
between 3L and 5L (see Table 1).
2.3.2 Distributional Analyses of 3L and 5L Utility Values
Country-specific 3L and 5L utility values were calculated
for each value set for all condition groups combined and
described numerically and graphically using histograms.
We examined clusters and discontinuities (‘gaps’) in the
histograms as such patterns theoretically diminish the
sensitivity and the accuracy of the instruments and might
lead to estimation problems [40].
In order to assess the frequency and efficiency of use of
the utility scale we applied Shannon’s indices as a means of
assessing distributional evenness [17, 18, 21, 22]. While
Shannon’s H0 captures absolute informativity and is
simultaneously powered by evenness and the number of
categories used, Shannon’s J’ index of relative informativity solely reflects the evenness of a distribution [41].
Since Shannon’s J0 corrects for the total number of possible
categories (here: possible utility values), which could be
1 We use the notation ‘3L-5L’ to refer to ‘3L compared to 5L’, ‘3L
versus 5L’ or ‘3L and 5L’, depending on the context.

potentially close (or equal) to 243 for 3L and 3125 for 5L,
it was not considered to be a fair comparison (we expected
thatJ0 would result in higher values for 3L for this reason).
Hence, we also calculated both indices by subdividing the
scale range in categories (‘bins’) with a width of 0.05,
making the number of categories between 3L and 5L more
comparable.
Subsequently, we presented mean utility values (and
standard deviations [SDs]) by condition group for all 14
value sets, with the addition of an equal weighting score
(Level Sum Score [LSS] transformed to a 0–1 scale) in
order to assess the impact of the descriptive data without
the effect of utility weights. The transformed LSS (tLSS)
was calculated by summing the level scores for the five
dimensions and performing a linear transformation on this
sum score to a 0–1 scale so that the value for 11111 is
equal to 1.0 and 33333 (for 3L) or 55555 (for 5L) is equal
to 0.
2.3.3 Discriminatory Performance of 5L Versus 3L
Two tests of discriminatory power were conducted,
accommodating different distributional assumptions with
respect to utility values: one based on theF statistic
(parametric), the second on receiver-operating characteristics (non-parametric).
Discriminatory power was assessed using theF statistic
derived from analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the
equality of means. TheF statistic is widely used to assess
the relative efficiency of patient-reported outcome measures [21, 42, 43] and is based on differences in group
means divided by the standard error of the difference. A
higherF statistic means a higher likelihood for a measure
to show statistical significance when used to compare
groups. Hence, higherF statistic values indicate higher
discriminatory power. To express the discriminatory power
of 5L relative to 3L we computed the ratio of their F statistics resulting from comparisons of different condition groups, in such a way that a ratio higher than 1.0
indicated that 5L was more discriminative than 3L: relative
efficiency=F statistic5L
/F statistic3L.
Comparisons were made between (1) the eight disease
groups and the student cohort, assuming the students were
a valid proxy for a healthy population sample; and (2)
patients with a mild condition versus those with a moderate
or severe condition. Using the observed mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) ratings as reference, we
defined diabetes and liver disease as mild conditions (relative to the other conditions), and the remaining six as
moderate to severe conditions. Since our main aim was to
compare measurement properties of 3L and 5L, we considered this method to be suitable for assessing their ability

to distinguish between mild and moderate/severe condition
groups.
As a second analysis, we calculated the area under the
receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUROC) as a
non-parametric method of assessing discriminatory power.
AUROC analyses were performed for each pair of condition group comparisons using pooled data on the groups,
with group membership being the outcome and the 3L/5L
utility score being the exposure. AUROCs for 3L and 5L
were calculated and the ratio (5L/3L) was used as the
measure of discriminatory power. The AUROC value can
range from 0.5 (no prediction) to 1.0 (perfect prediction).
Consequently, a 5L/3L AUROC ratio[1.0 indicates 5L to
be more discriminative than 3L. While the F statistic is
directly based on means and dispersion, the AUROC
employs the full distribution.
For all comparisons 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of
the F statistic and AUROC ratios were calculated using
3000 bootstrap samples, enabling us to test whether the
ratio was statistically different from 1.0.
2.3.4 Exploration of Factors Affecting Discriminatory
Power
At least three separate factors determine discriminatory
power results:
1. The effects of the descriptive system, involving choice
of dimensions, number of levels and corresponding
labels, translation effects and reporting heterogeneity.
2. Valuation effects, relating to the valuation protocol,
the valuation study (interviewer effects, quality control, etc.) but also to the modelling of the valuation
data. Valuation effects also encompass true countryspecific variation in preferences, which may be caused
by many underlying factors, e.g. cultural, geographical
or related to demographics, language or health system.
3. A third factor is related to the ability of any scale to
capture the location of a respondent on the true latent
scale. The precision of measuring this location will
have an impact on the descriptive data and consequently the utility distribution of any study sample. As
it appears this important factor is often ignored, we
discuss this in some detail.
A graphical example can illustrate potential misclassification effects due to distributional descriptive 3L–5L
effects (Fig. 1). The general methodology has been widely
discussed in research on reporting heterogeneity [44–48].
Imagine a health dimension scaled with three levels of
granularity: 3L, 5L and 10L (3, 5 and 10 levels respectively). In this example we do not take specific labels into
account (although ‘1’ refers to no problems). There is an
underlying unobservable latent scale which is assumed to
be continuous: all three measurement systems (3L, 5L,
10L) will only be approximations of the true latent value.
The transition area of two adjacent categories is called the
cut-off point (or ‘cut-point’), and in the development of
measurement scales one strives for clearly defined cutpoints with little overlap (as defined by the labels), to avoid
error. The distribution of observed scores of the 3L, 5L and
10L ordinal scales depends on the cut-points. Random error
may occur at the cut-points when overlap exists, and this
overlap may differ between 3L, 5L and 10L. Note that
random error may cause a shift of average values for the
extreme categories of the scale, as misclassification can
only be towards the middle level of the scale due to the
censored nature of the EQ-5D dimensions. Also note that
when applying labels, the middle category of 3L does not
necessarily coincide with the middle level of 10L, or would
have the same latent midpoint, i.e. the middle point of the

category, equidistant from both cut-points. Various types of
misclassification may occur between the three systems.
Imagine five different locations on the latent scale (A
through to E), which we here refer to as respondents,
although these also might indicate group averages. For
respondent A there is no discrepancy between 3L, 5L and
10L: no problems are scored in all three systems. For
respondent B both 3L and 5L lack refinement (no problems) as evidently there are reported problems on 10L.
Respondent C illustrates the reduced ceiling effect with the
introduction of 5L over 3L: no problems are reported in 3L
whereas problems are reported on 5L. Respondent D might
contribute to an overestimation of reported health problems
in 3L when compared to 5L: the middle 3L category is
chosen whereas a milder category is chosen for 5L. The
distance from the 3L midpoint to the true latent value (X) is
larger than the distance from the 5L midpoint to the latent
value (Y) and smallest with 10L (Z). The same goes for
respondent E: the most extreme category is chosen for 3L
whereas a less severe category is scored on 5L. As mentioned, these location effects may also apply to group
means, potentially leading to misclassification, especially
when the group is rather homogeneous. Random error will
increase if the mass of observations of a group is close to a
cut-point of the scale such as location D, and may then
have a strong impact on a crude scale such as 3L, but may
only have a small effect on a more refined scale such as 5L,
and even less on 10L. Generally, we assume that more
levels theoretically will lead to less measurement bias.
With regard to factor 2, specific modelling outcomes on
the intercept and dimension coefficients and the use of
interaction terms such as the N3 term (representing whether any dimension is at level 3) will affect the resulting
utility distributions and may subsequently affect discriminatory power. To explore the role of these modelling
effects we studied the impact of altering the models (based
on the original valuation data) by performing a sensitivity
analysis in which we excluded the N3 term for two 3L
value sets (The Netherlands, UK).
We explored the role of factors 1–3 both numerically
and graphically. The point of departure was the LSS of the
descriptive data, both by dimension and summed over all
dimensions. From the LSS, difference scores between 3L
and 5L were calculated by condition. We investigated how
various value set characteristics contributed to discriminatory power results using tLSS (LSS transformed to a 0–1
scale) as a reference.
As a way of disentangling the intertwined effects of
various factors affecting discriminatory power, we performed a multiple regression analysis with the F statistic
and AUROC as dependent variables and the following
variables representing value set or descriptive system
characteristics as independent variables: intercept
(continuous), modelled range (continuous), N3 (continuous, we included only N3 since this was the most prominent interaction term), version (with 3L as reference) and
country (with Canada as reference).
3 Results
3.1 3L and 5L Value Sets for Seven Countries
There were substantial differences in the models across
value sets (Table 1). For most countries the modelled 5L
value range was smaller than that for the 3L, with the
exception of China and The Netherlands. If 5L value sets
included an intercept, its size was much smaller than 3L
(except for South Korea where the intercept was 0.050 for
3L and 0.096 for 5L). The ‘upper gap’ between the value
for 11111 and the second best health state was reduced
quite substantially in 5L, ranging from a 0.02 reduction for
The Netherlands and 0.04 for Spain to 0.09 for Japan and
0.14 for Canada, with South Korea as the exception (0.09
for 3L and 0.12 for 5L). Note that for Canada the upper gap
was only 0.02 for 5L, because the value for 11111 was set
at 0.949 (1 minus the intercept). Five countries included the
N3 term in their 3L model, while for 5L only two countries
used a similar interaction term (Canada and South Korea).
Considerable variation was apparent in the model coefficients indicating the utility value decrement (‘disutility’) of
dimensions, with mobility showing the highest decrements
for level 3 (3L) for Canada, China, Japan, South Korea and
Spain and for level 5 (5L) for China, Japan and South
Korea. Pain/discomfort had the highest decrement for level
3 (3L) for the UK and The Netherlands and for level 5 (5L)
for Canada, England and Spain. Anxiety/depression
showed the second largest disutility in 5L for Canada,
England, Japan and Spain and the largest for The Netherlands. For The Netherlands, both 3L and 5L value sets
include large disutility values for anxiety/depression.
Figure 9 (Appendix) depicts the distribution plots for all
possible values for the 3L and 5L value sets. Note that these
plots are ranked by utility value for 3L and 5L separately,
implying that ‘comparable’ health states such as 21111 for
3L and 31111 for 5L can be at different positions on the
common utility space (X-axis). For England/UK and Spain,
most 3L index values were concentrated at a much lower
segment of the utility scale when compared to 5L, while for
China it was vice versa, although to a lesser extent.
3.2 Distributional Analyses of 3L and 5L Utility
Values
The descriptive final dataset consisted of 3L and 5L health
profile data for 3467 respondents, with the smallest and
Is EQ-5D-5L Better Than EQ-5D-3L? 681

largest condition groups being depression (n = 250) and
liver disease (n = 588), respectively (Table 2). The ceiling
was always lower in 5L, ranging from a difference between
3L and 5L of 0.8% (stroke) to 12.7% (students). Floor
effects were negligible.
Figure 2 depicts the empirically observed utility values
for all countries. The 5L distributions are smoother and
more evenly distributed than those for 3L. The 3L value
distributions often show clusters and discontinuities across
the entire range of the scale. Due to the intercept for 3L
there is a large upper gap for Japan and Canada, and to a
slightly lesser extent for The Netherlands and the UK. The
5L country-specific distributions look rather similar despite
the model heterogeneity, although for South Korea and
Japan the effect of the intercept is also clearly visible.
While for England and Spain most possible 3L utility
values (Fig. 9, Appendix) were concentrated at a much
lower segment of the scale than 5L, the observed values did
not show this pattern.
The non-parametric Shannon’s H0 and J0 indices
numerically reflected the graphical results (Table 3). For
all comparisons, Shannon’s H0 was much higher for 5L and
Shannon’s Evenness J0 index also was consistently higher
for 5L. After subdivision into 0.05 utility space categories
5L clearly showed substantially higher values than 3L for
both indices in all countries, establishing better distributional evenness for 5L overall.
Figure 3 shows the observed country-specific mean
utility values for each condition group (means and SDs are
listed in Table 6, Appendix). The presentation as a line
graph was chosen to facilitate pattern comparison between
3L and 5L. Overall, the same ranking of average utilities
per condition group across countries is visible in the figure and also a strong similarity of utilities with tLSS
(showing only descriptive 3L–5L differences). Two patterns are visible: between-country valuation effects
appeared larger than 3L versus 5L effects (judging from the
scale differences between countries), and 3L–5L utility
differences did not seem to add very much to the difference
based on tLSS between 3L and 5L. For mild conditions 5L
SDs were generally smaller, except for England/UK and
Spain where SDs in 5L were smaller overall. Two countries
displayed close to identical 3L and 5L condition group
means (Canada and Japan). The other countries and tLSS
values generally indicated an upward or downward shift.
The UK showed a universal upward shift of 5L, South
Korea a downward shift, the remaining countries (China,
The Netherlands and Spain) showed a general shift plus a
modifying effect in four conditions: CVD, stroke, asthma/
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and

3.3 Discriminatory Performance of 5L Versus 3L
Both 3L and 5L distinguished well between the healthy and
the disease groups as well as between mild and moderate/severe condition groups for all country-specific value
sets. All comparisons resulted in statistically significant
results. However, performance in terms of relative efficiency varied noticeably across version (3L/5L), value set
(country and model effects) and the condition groups
compared. Generally, 3L performed better in the healthy–
disease comparisons while 5L performed better comparing
mild and moderate/severe conditions (Fig. 4). Japanese and
Dutch 5L value sets performed better overall while Canadian and Chinese 3L value sets performed better overall.
The bootstrap analysis showed that although most significant results were quite robust, some were borderline significant while others were borderline non-significant.
The results for the AUROC analysis generally supported
the relative efficiency results (Fig. 5), with 3L showing a
better performance in the healthy–disease comparison, and
5L in the mild versus moderate/severe comparisons.
However, overall results showed a significantly better
performance for 5L over 3L when compared to the relative
efficiency results, except for Japan.
3.4 Exploration of Factors Affecting Discriminatory
Power
For the exploratory analysis we initially focused on the
descriptive data, comparing LSS by dimension. Table 4
shows a pronounced shift effect between 3L and 5L (LSS
by dimension recoded to no problems = 0; 3L on the same
scale as 5L). A standardised difference score (D) was calculated, adjusting for sample size. For almost all condition
groups and all dimensions, a shift to less reported health
problems on 5L when compared with 3L occurred, except
for mobility, where 5L represents more health problems for
five condition groups due to ‘confined to bed’ barely being
endorsed in 3L. The sum of the standardised differences
scores shows that over all five dimensions the 3L–5L difference (shift) was smallest for the healthy population
(28.4) and largest for liver disease (75.0). Level distributions by dimension for the pooled dataset graphically
depict this main trend (Fig. 6). The shift was mainly caused
by the very large proportion of respondents scoring level 2
on 3L who scored a level 2 or level 3 on 5L (average 85%
over dimensions), leaving a very small proportion scoring
level 4 on 5L. For pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression
this also occurred at the extreme end of the scale, with a
larger proportion scoring level 3 on 3L who scored level 4
on 5L rather than level 5. These observations translate into
the conclusion that 3L as a scale tended to overestimate
health problems when compared with 5L.
Overall, 3L resulted in higher relative efficiency ratios
for the healthy–disease comparison whereas 5L performed
better for the mild versus moderate/severe comparisons.
Figure 7 provides an example explaining this trend. Using
tLSS as reference, 3L has overall lower average values
than 5L, but as mentioned earlier the differences for the
healthy population were smallest, while for the other
condition groups they were larger, resulting in a larger
difference in means between the healthy and disease
groups for 3L (X) than for 5L (Y), reflected in higher
F statistics for 3L. For the mild disease showing the most
pronounced results on relative efficiency (liver disease), the
descriptive difference between 3L and 5L was largest
(Table 4). Here the difference pattern was reversed, as
indicated at the foot of Fig. 7. The difference in means
between the mild and moderate/severe diseases was larger
for 5L (Y) than for 3L (X), resulting in higher discriminatory power for 5L.
When exploring 3L–5L differences of the countryspecific utilities, various model characteristics emerged as
important underlying factors. A large intercept generally
results in a lower mean and increased variance around the
mean. The net effect on the F statistic is difficult to predict
since both the difference of means and the standard error of
the difference are affected. Overall, we detected a negative
effect on discriminatory power, exemplified by the very
large 3L intercept of Japan, leading to inferior performance
when compared to 5L. Second, an effect of the use of
model interaction terms was visible. The large N3 terms for
the UK, Spain (and to a lesser extent for The Netherlands)
appeared to negatively influence discriminatory power,
caused by a substantial increase in variance. Note particularly that the Canadian 3L set did not contain an N3 term,
but the 5L did include an ‘N4 or N5’ term which might
have contributed to poorer discriminatory performance of
5L. Partly caused by the N3 term, but also due to other
characteristics of 3L value sets, clusters and gaps occurred
in the utility distributions, especially in the moderate to
severe region (0–0.5), whereas 5L employed the utility
scale more efficiently, resulting in smoother distributions.
The histograms for the separate condition group comparisons demonstrate that the modelled range of a given value
set bore no relation to the F statistic results. Instead, the use
of the scale was decisive (as also shown in Fig. 2). One
example is liver disease: while the modelled range for 5L
in Canada and Japan was much smaller than for 3L, the
available value range was being used much more frequently and efficiently in 5L, contributing to higher discriminatory power in 5L.

Is EQ-5D-5L Better Than EQ-5D-3L? 687

The sensitivity analysis, exploring the effect of excluding the N3 term for the 3L value sets for the UK and The
Netherlands, confirmed this pattern. Discriminatory power
clearly increased for 3L as the number of significant results
in favour of 3L increased from 3 versus 4 (3L vs. 5L) to 9
versus 2 for the UK and from 1 versus 10 (3L vs. 5L) to 4
versus 5 for The Netherlands (Figs. 4, 8). Descriptive
statistics showed that this was mainly due to lower levels of
dispersion for the models without N3.
The results from the regression on the F statistic were a
way to validate our interpretation of the relative impact of
various factors. Our findings were confirmed (Table 5),
demonstrating a significant negative coefficient for 5L for
the healthy–disease comparison and a positive coefficient
for the mild versus moderate/severe comparisons. The
modelled range was not significant for both types of
comparison, confirming that the modelled range did not
significantly impact upon the F statistic. The intercept
showed a significant negative value for the healthy–disease
comparison, implying that the use of an intercept decreases
discriminatory power. The N3 term did not show a significant impact. It is of interest to note that the value sets
for the Asian countries resulted in higher discriminatory
power than for the non-Asian countries. Using the AUROC
as the independent variable showed similar patterns, where
the intercept consistently showed a negative effect, as did
the N3 term for the mild versus moderate/severe comparison. The modelled range, however, appeared to contribute
to discriminatory power.
4 Discussion
Our study showed that the 5L version of the EQ-5D
instrument was in many respects superior to the original 3L
version. By separating the performance of description and
valuation, it became clear that these benefits mainly arise
from the improved descriptive system: 5L was superior in
terms of the distributional evenness, efficiency of scale use
and the face validity of the resulting distributions, leading
to an increase in sensitivity and precision in health status
measurement. Refinement of 5L was not offset by more
error, neither in terms of description nor in valuation.
The fewer cut-points of 3L (two instead of four in 5L)
and the position of the cut-points relative to the true latent
scale position could be the main drivers of the larger error
component in 3L. The net effect was that 3L overestimated
self-reported health problems by displaying ‘moderate
problems’ where the true latent score most often was more
likely to be in between ‘no problems’ and ‘moderate’, i.e.
3L suffered from a rather high cut-point between levels 1
and 2 (and for pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression also
between levels 2 and 3). The impact of this artefact of the
descriptive system decreased when the number of levels
increased. The fact that 3L systematically overestimated
reported health problems was unexpected, as for certain
condition groups (e.g. in severe patients) the level of
reported health problems between 3L and 5L could have
been similar, or 3L could have led to the reverse finding.
i.e. an underestimation of health problems. The overestimation of 3L was not trivial and affected any difference
score when making comparisons: differences may be
underestimated or overestimated, such as the overestimation of the difference between a healthy population and

most patient groups in our study. This disadvantage of 3L
has further consequences in the valuation procedure: if
respondents were to value a 3L health profile with moderate problems, and no information was available to inform
them that this would actually (empirically) refer to a mix of
moderate and predominantly milder health problems, then
the disutility would also be overestimated.
When adding utility values to the descriptive data, it was
apparent that although absolute utility means varied substantially, 3L–5L differences were not very large, as usually a constant upward or downward shift was observed.
Nevertheless, this study showed that seemingly small differences do affect results in discriminating between groups,
and are likely to also affect responsiveness. A more precise

discrimination between subgroups is achieved with 5L. The
effect on QALY comparisons might be smaller since here it
would mainly be the difference of mean utilities that would
determine the outcome, with the exception being heterogeneous diseases and/or populations where the redistribution effects were non-linear (in our study CVD, stroke,
asthma/COPD and RA/arthritis), where larger differences
might be expected.
On the assumption that the increased number of levels in
5L led to less bias in the resulting utilities, we concluded
that 3L overestimated health problems and consequently
underestimated utilities when compared with 5L. This was
generally observed across condition groups, but was most
pronounced in liver disease (caused by a large misclassification at location D, as depicted in Fig. 1). Against our
expectation, health problems in this group were apparently
very mild [49], as confirmed by the high mean EQ VAS
rating. A result of 3L misclassification is a biased assessment of discriminatory power that could lead to an overestimation of discriminatory power of 3L in the healthy
versus disease comparisons in our study, or an underestimation of discriminatory power in the mild versus moderate/severe comparisons.
For mild conditions SDs were lower in 5L, which may
be a consequence of 3L overestimation being larger in
these conditions, as 5L was better equipped to capture the
(very) mild skewed distribution, resulting in lower SDs.
For moderate and severe condition groups, 5L SD rates
were higher. Graphical and numerical (Shannon’s indices)
evidence clearly showed that 5L covered a much wider
range of the utility scale in these condition groups and was
more evenly distributed, which in our view resulted in a
much better reflection of the true underlying distribution.
Note also that for the UK and Spain, 3L levels of dispersion
were higher overall, which was in part due to the inclusion
of the N3 term.
The analysis additionally proved useful in detecting
inter-country differences. The relatively poor performance
of 5L in some countries may relate to the use of the initial
EQ-VT version 1.0. For instance, in Canada and England

very few negative values were derived, which could be
caused by poor protocol compliance of the interviewers
and/or a poor explanation of the worse than dead task in the
composite TTO exercise. In general, the value sets for the
Asian countries showed better discriminatory power than
non-Asian countries. We must also accept that structural
components influence preferences, with many possible
underlying factors involved (e.g. culture, demographics,
language, geography), which was also noted by Olsen et al.
[50].
Our study rested on two unique features:
1. The development of an innovative framework to assess
the performance of preference-based measures of
health with varying levels of sensitivity. Note that a
framework such as the COSMIN (COnsensus-based
Standards for the selection of health Measurement
Instruments) taxonomy only partially applies to instruments with separate descriptive and valuation components [51, 52].

2. The use of a large number of published value sets ‘as
is’ in a large multinational parallel 3L–5L dataset
across nine condition groups.
Our innovative framework started with the separation of
potential systematic effects in description and valuation.
This enabled us to clarify hitherto poorly understood
mechanisms underlying differences with a 3L versus a 5L
system [19, 53]. Our study confirms some of the findings
from an earlier study by Richardson et al. [23], showing that
differences between utility results of different preferencebased instruments are mainly attributable to the descriptive
data, although a different methodological approach was
followed in their study, based on parametric techniques.
Our framework incorporated ceiling and floor effects, and
Shannon’s indices as expressions of the evenness of a distribution. Distributional characteristics were based on the
straightforward assumption that we should expect normal or
lognormal distributed outcomes, as commonly observed in
many naturally occurring phenomena, including self-reported health [54–56]. We improved on the use of the F
ratio to quantify discriminatory power, differentiating
between the various underlying sources, e.g. random error,
cut-point-related bias and dispersion in heterogeneous
samples. The successful use of the AUROC is an example
of the wide applicability of this method beyond diagnostics.
This study shows only part of its potential, as described
elsewhere [57, 58]. A main advantage of our framework lies
in the combined strength of the distributional approaches
and different methods to assess discriminatory power,
enabling us to make claims of the superiority of one measure over another. Our methods make clear that 5L is better
than 3L, but they could also demonstrate that a hypothetical
10L might be a poor choice.

There were some limitations that must be acknowledged
for the current study. First, the condition samples were not
optimal for all groups. We used a student cohort to represent a healthy population, whereas a better matched
general population sample, especially in terms of age and
education, would have been more suitable. Second, we
cannot exclude the possibility that inter-country differences
in the descriptive data existed. The condition groups were
from various countries, e.g. the liver disease sample was
derived from an Italian cohort, the student cohort was
entirely Polish and the personality disorder sample was
Dutch. The F statistic was a key component of our study,
assuming a normal distribution. The 3L and 5L utility
scores used in our study were often not normally distributed due to ceiling effects or clusters, although in the
context of health measurement the key factors are similarity of the distributions rather than normality, and
approximately equal-sized samples [42]. Our conclusion
that 3L overestimated health problems might be challenged
for the first three dimensions where level 2 of 3L (some
problems) was not identical to level 3 of 5L (moderate
problems), although we felt justified generalising over all
five dimensions since for pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression, where all labels are identical, overestimation was
largest. Finally, as our study was based on cross-sectional
data, we cannot make firm conclusions about the 3L versus
5L impact on QALYs. However, in the main pharmacoeconomic application of EQ-5D (cost-utility analysis),
the utilities for different health states that are modelled are
typically based on cross-sectional data, often derived from
different patients subgroups.
5 Conclusions
Our study has several implications. Although the 3L can be
considered to be a valid measure in itself, we demonstrated
that its lack of refinement did lead to more reported health
problems on average when compared to a more sensitive
and precise measure. We are aware that an even more
refined system might reveal misclassification in 5L, but
these effects will on average be much smaller. We conclude that 5L results in more precise and valid outcomes,
both descriptive and in terms of valuation. The increased
sensitivity and precision of 5L is likely to be generalisable
to longitudinal designs, such as intervention studies.
Hence, we recommend the use of 5L across applications,
including economic evaluation, clinical studies and burden
of disease or public health studies (e.g. for establishing
population norms). Our results indicate that in situations
where patient groups would experience a uniform recovery
to nearly full health, 3L might artificially show a large
effect. This might have led to the overestimation of QALY
gains in past economic evaluations, especially in assessing
the impact of drugs for mild diseases.
With regard to modelling of the utility data, it was
apparent that the inclusion of an interaction term (such as
N3) and an intercept would lead to undesirable distributional characteristics such as discontinuities and clusters in
the utility scale and would be likely to reduce discriminatory power. It is notable that for the two countries that
included an interaction term in their 5L model (Canada and
South Korea), discriminatory power was not outstanding.
Note that a large intercept might have been caused by
misspecification of mild health states in the valuation procedure (by assigning low utility values), which could be due
to interviewer effects (especially apparent in EQ-VT version 1.0) or cognitive overload in respondents. Our finding
that the use of the scale was an important determinant of
discriminatory performance (as opposed to the modelled
range) shows that the previous preoccupation with the
modelled range is not really justified [29, 50], which was
also reflected in our regression results (Table 5). The use of
3L in conditions with problems with mobility could lead to
severe underreporting of mobility problems. In our study
COPD or CVD patients showed many reported problems in
walking about on 5L, but since these respondents were not
confined to bed they were restricted to score level 2 on 3L,
thereby reducing its sensitivity and discriminatory power
substantially. This is corroborated by results from a study
among patients to receive hip replacement surgery in the
UK. Not a single patient reported a level 3 problem on
mobility on the 3L, whereas there were many reported
problems with mobility in the Oxford Hip Score, a condition-specific measure [59]. Changing the most severe level
descriptor of 3L ‘confined to bed’ to ‘unable to walk about’
in 5L appeared to be a huge improvement.
A final implication of our study includes the introduction of a powerful evaluative framework, allowing for
further extension by using evidence resulting from longitudinal 3L–5L data. Our framework combines parametric
(F statistic) with non-parametric (AUROC) methods, and
may be more broadly applied than assessing granularity of
the system (the number of response options), such as to
investigate the impact of adding dimensions to the EQ-5D,
or assessing translation effects.
The current 5L system would profit from more knowledge on the random error of descriptive data (reliability)
and cut-point effects, which would also be useful in the
development of any new measure. This includes investigating whether the latent scale people use when responding
to the EQ-5D for self-classification is the same as when
valuing hypothetical health states.
