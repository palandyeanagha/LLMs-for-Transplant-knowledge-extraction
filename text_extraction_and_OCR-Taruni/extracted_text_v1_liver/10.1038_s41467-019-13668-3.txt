Mitochondrial TCA cycle metabolites control
physiology and disease
Inmaculada Martínez-Reyes 1 & Navdeep S. Chandel 1,2*
Mitochondria are signaling organelles that regulate a wide variety of cellular functions and
can dictate cell fate. Multiple mechanisms contribute to communicate mitochondrial fitness
to the rest of the cell. Recent evidence confers a new role for TCA cycle intermediates,
generally thought to be important for biosynthetic purposes, as signaling molecules with
functions controlling chromatin modifications, DNA methylation, the hypoxic response, and
immunity. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which the abundance of different TCA
cycle metabolites controls cellular function and fate in different contexts. We will focus on
how these metabolites mediated signaling can affect physiology and disease.
Mitochondria are cellular organelles that generate ATP and metabolites for survival and
growth, respectively. Mitochondria are responsive to execution of commands from the
nucleus. Gene expression changes from the nucleus promote mitochondrial biogenesis
or increase mitochondrial respiratory activity to meet the cellular needs through a mechanism
called “anterograde regulation”. However, it is clear now that mitochondria and the nucleus
maintain a bidirectional regulation. Cells check whether mitochondrial metabolism is fit before
they engage in complex and highly demanding cellular functions, including differentiation or
adaptation to stress. Through a “retrograde signaling” mitochondria can regulate the expression
of different genes to facilitate diverse cellular functions1. The mitochondrial requirements are
diverse among different cell types and they are highly influenced by the microenvironment.
Four prominent mechanisms by which mitochondria communicate with the rest of the cell
include the release of cytochrome c to induce cell death, activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) to control mitochondrial fission and fusion, production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) to activate transcription factors, and the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
to activate immune responses2–5 (Fig. 1). Recent studies indicate a fifth mechanism whereby
mitochondria release TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle metabolites to control cell fate and function
(Fig. 2). TCA cycle metabolites were primarily considered as byproducts of cellular metabolism
important for the biosynthesis of macromolecules such as nucleotides, lipids, and proteins.
Although this is an essential function for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, it is rapidly
appreciated that metabolites in the TCA cycle are also involved in controlling chromatin
modifications, DNA methylation, and post-translational modifications of proteins to alter their
function. The purpose of this review is to highlight the signaling implications of TCA cycle
metabolites and how changes in their abundance control physiology and disease.
The TCA cycle and its regulation
The TCA cycle overview. The TCA cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or the Krebs cycle,
is a series of reactions in a closed loop that forms a metabolic engine within cells (Fig. 3). The

TCA cycle constitutes an epicenter in cell metabolism because
multiple substrates can feed into it. The TCA cycle begins with
the reaction that combines the two-carbon acetyl-CoA, generated
from fatty acids, amino acids or pyruvate oxidation, with a fourcarbon oxaloacetate (OAA) to generate the six-carbon molecule
citrate. In the second step, citrate is converted into its isomer,
isocitrate. The cycle continues with two oxidative decarboxylation
in which isocitrate is converted into the five-carbon α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and subsequently into the four-carbon succinylCoA with the release of two molecules of CO2 and the generation
of two NADH molecules. Next, succinyl-CoA converts into succinate, coupling it to the generation of GTP, which can be converted into ATP. Succinate is oxidized generating the four-carbon
molecule fumarate. In this reaction, two hydrogen atoms are
transferred to FAD, producing 2FADH. Importantly, the enzyme
that carries out this step, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), is also
part of the electron transport chain (ETC) (Fig. 3). Next, fumarate
gets converted into malate and further into OAA that combine
with another acetyl-CoA molecule to continue the TCA cycle.
The TCA cycle participates in both anabolism and catabolism.
As the cycle runs, metabolites from the cycle are transported into
the cytosol where they provide the building blocks for macromolecule synthesis6. For example, citrate is exported to the
cytosol where it is converted to OAA and acetyl-CoA to promote
nucleotide and lipid synthesis, respectively. Importantly, when
TCA cycle intermediates are being shuttled away from the
mitochondria for biosynthetic purposes, the cycle has to be
replenished to keep it running. This process is referred to as
anaplerosis. There are multiple inputs into the TCA cycle but two
important anaplerotic mechanisms are the conversion of pyruvate
to mitochondrial OAA by pyruvate decarboxylase and the activation of glutaminolysis, which converts glutamine to glutamate
Fig. 1 Essential signaling functions of mitochondria. Mitochondria have evolved distinct strategies to integrate environmental cues and communicate their
fitness to the rest of the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis. Release of cytochrome c to invoke caspase-dependent cell death, release of reactive oxygen
species to oxidize thiols within redox-regulated proteins, and induce gene expression and the activation of AMPK under energetic stress to control
mitochondrial dynamics are three prominent mitochondrial-dependent signaling events. Additionally, release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol
triggers inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory responses through the cGAS–STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. Signaling roles of TCA cycle
metabolites are in part mediated by controlling chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, as well as post-translational protein modifications.
Fig. 2 The TCA cycle is a signaling hub. TCA cycle metabolites have diverse non-metabolic signaling roles with important effects in physiology and
disease. Metabolites such as acetyl-CoA, itaconate, succinate, fumarate, and L-2-HG can alter the response of both the innate and adaptive immune
systems. Other functions like lymphangiogenesis or the maintenance of stem cells pluripotency have been associated with acetyl-CoA and α-KG,
respectively. Succinate, L-2HG, and fumarate are well recognized oncometabolites that promote tumorigenesis. In addition to its intracellular functions,
succinate can also act as a systemic signal to regulate thermogenesis upon exposure to cold temperature.

and subsequently to α-KG. The latter mechanism is often used
when α-KG levels drop due to citrate being exported from the
mitochondria into the cytosol for the de novo lipid synthesis.
Interestingly, in cases where the ETC is impaired, the generation
of some TCA cycle intermediates can be maintained by a process
called glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation7. In this
pathway the cycle partially reverses itself to generate citrate from
glutamine-derived α-KG by two subsequent reactions catalyzed
by NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and
aconitase (ACO).
Enzymes of the TCA cycle evolved prior to the presence of
oxygen on earth signifying the primary biosynthetic role of the
TCA cycle. However, over time the TCA cycle has evolved into an
important energy-producing pathway in eukaryotes. The primary
function of one turn of the TCA cycle from an energy-generating
perspective is to oxidize acetyl-CoA to two molecules of CO2. The
completion of the TCA cycle generates ATP and the byproducts 3
NADH and 1 FADH2 that further feed the ETC complex I
(NADH dehydrogenase) and complex II (SDH), respectively.
Complexes I and II then pass their electrons through the ETC to
ultimately produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS). The TCA cycle and OXPHOS are coupled since
the oxidation of NADH and FADH2 in complexes I and II is
required for the TCA cycle to keep functioning (Fig. 3).
The TCA cycle is a tightly regulated pathway. The regulation of
the TCA cycle and its constant feedback with OXPHOS is critical
to keep the cells in a stable state. There are multiple positive and
negative allosteric regulators that control the metabolic flux of the
TCA cycle. NADH inhibits all the regulatory enzymes in the TCA
cycle. Thus, in situations of ETC malfunctioning, NADH accumulates and the TCA cycle shuts down as a consequence. As
NADH generates ATP through the ETC and OXPHOS, ATP is
also an allosteric inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and
IDH. Thus, when cells have ample NADH and ATP, the cycle
slows down. In contrast, high demands for ATP increases the
ADP/ATP ratio and AMP levels, resulting in stimulation of the
regulatory enzymes of the TCA cycle. Abundant acetyl-CoA
inhibits PDH but activates pyruvate carboxylase to increase the
formation of OAA from pyruvate and thus pair the levels of the
two initiating metabolites of the cycle. Another intrinsic regulator
is succinyl-CoA, which inhibits both citrate synthase and α-KG
dehydrogenase to slow the cycle down. Likewise, an increase in
OAA inhibits SDH and decelerates the cycle.
The TCA cycle and cellular signaling
Acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a thioester between the two-carbon
acetyl group (CH3CO) and a thiol, coenzyme A (CoA). As
mentioned in the previous section, the maintenance of an acetylCoA pool is crucial to sustain the TCA cycle activity. To achieve
this, acetyl-CoA can be generated from different sources and in
multiple compartments. In mitochondria, acetyl-CoA can be
generated from the oxidation of pyruvate, through fatty acid
oxidation, by the degradation of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and tryptophan or through the mitochondrial enzyme
aceyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family, member 1 (ACSS1)-
mediated conversion of acetate. Acetyl-CoA can also be generated
in the cytosol. Citrate can travel outside of the mitochondria
through the dicarboxylate antiporter solute carrier family 25
(SLC25A1) and be converted back to acetyl-CoA and OAA by
ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) both in the cytosol and in the nucleus.
Finally, the cytosolic enzyme aceyl-CoA synthetase short-chain
family, member 2 (ACSS2) can metabolize acetate into acetylCoA. Although this is not a common physiological pathway
except in hepatocytes, cancer cells rely on this pathway to
respond to the metabolic stress caused by limited nutrient
availability8,9. The versatile participation of acetyl-CoA in multiple cellular processes makes it a critical metabolite to maintain
cell homeostasis. Acetyl-CoA acts as a metabolic intermediate and
as a precursor of anabolic reactions in the synthesis of fatty acids
Fig. 3 The TCA cycle and OXPHOS are tightly coordinated. In a series of enzymatic reactions the TCA cycle generates the reducing equivalents NADH
and FADH2, which are required to transfer electrons to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, also known as the electron transport chain (ETC). As the
electrons are funneled through the complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane, a functional ETC generates a mitochondrial membrane potential that
is used to produce ATP. This process requires the presence of oxygen and it is known as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondrial complex I
and II in the ETC replenish NAD + and FAD, respectively, allowing the oxidative TCA cycle to function. Succinate dehydrogenase is the only enzyme that
participates in both the TCA cycle and the ETC.

and steroids, and certain amino acids, including glutamate, proline, and arginine.
Acetyl-CoA regulates chromatin dynamics. Likely the most prominent signaling function of acetyl-CoA is related to its ability to
provide the acetyl groups for acetylation, one of the major posttranslational protein modifications in the cell. Special attention
has been paid to the contribution of acetyl-CoA as a necessary
cofactor in the acetylation of histones, a mechanism known to
alter the dynamics of chromatin to drive the epigenetic control of
gene expression by activating transcriptional programs10, 11
(Fig. 4). Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are the enzymes
responsible for catalyzing the addition of acetyl groups in the
histone N-terminal tails. The activity of HATs is sensitive to
changes in the acetyl-CoA levels, which are in turn highly
dependent on glucose availability, fatty acid oxidation and
mitochondrial respiratory function12–14. Changes in acetyl-CoA
abundance have been shown to affect global histone acetylation
and gene expression14, 15. Importantly, genetic or pharmacologic
disruption of ACLY activity can decrease histone acetylation16.
Exogenous acetate can generate acetyl-CoA and maintain global
histone acetylation when ACLY generated acetyl-CoA is
limiting17.
In certain situations, specific genes are preferentially regulated
upon changes in acetyl-CoA availability. For example, in
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines, limited glucose
availability diminished acetyl-CoA levels and decreased the
expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and migration by
controlling the Ca2+-NFAT pathway14, 18. High levels of acetylCoA increased influx of calcium into the cells, activating and
translocating NFAT to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, NFAT
recruits the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) p300 to drive the sitespecific regulation of H3K27ac and increased the expression of
genes related to cell migration and adhesion to the extra-cellular
matrix. The acetylation of this specific locus was maintained even
in limited acetyl-CoA conditions when NFAT was constitutively
active, which suggest that acetyl-CoA levels might not be rate
limiting for site-specific histone acetylation. The results also
suggest a dual regulation in the chromatin remodeling where
histone acetylation can provide binding sites for regulatory
proteins, but also specific transcription factors may be required
for the acetylation of some histones marks in different contexts.
Some transcription factors like Smad2 are regulated by acetylation, so the pool of acetyl-CoA in the cytosol and in the nucleus
can also influence gene expression through this mechanism19.
Acetyl-CoA levels affect immune, cancer, and stem cells functions.
Elevated histone acetylation as a consequence of high acetyl-CoA
levels brings the cells to a pro-anabolic state increasing the
expression of genes involved in cell growth and proliferation,
including glycolytic enzymes14. Thus, cancer cells upregulate
acetyl-CoA generating enzymes like ACLY to increase their
proliferative capacity. Remarkably, inhibition of ACLY suppresses
tumorigenesis20. The signaling pathways that lead to an increased
acetylation of histones in high acetyl-CoA levels seem to vary in
different contexts. For instance, recent findings in pancreatic
cancer showed that high levels of acetyl-CoA and its use in the
mevalonate pathway favored malignant progression of KRAS
mutant acinar cells through the AKT-ACLY signaling axis21.
In other highly proliferative normal cells like T cells, increased
cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels are required for histone acetylation to
promote interferon-γ (IFNγ) production22. Along these lines, the
production of acetyl-CoA by fatty acid β-oxidation regulates
lymphangiogenesis through epigenetic changes regulated by the
transcription factor PROX123. Histone acetylation has also been
linked to macrophages and dentritic cells (DCs) activation.
Activated DCs and macrophages are characterized by a truncated
TCA cycle that causes citrate levels to accumulate. As a
consequence, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages
upregulate ACLY increasing cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels24.
Upregulation of ACLY through NF-kB and STAT signaling
pathways was shown to be necessary for the production of proinflammatory molecules, including nitric oxide (NO), ROS, and
the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in induced macrophages.
Interestingly, the Akt-mTORC1 signaling axis has also been
reported to regulate protein levels and activity of ACLY in
Fig. 4 TCA cycle regulation of chromatin modifications and DNA methylation. The activity of the TCA cycle is essential to provide the metabolites that
control chromatin modifications and DNA methylation. Specifically, histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) is dependent on the
availability of acetyl-CoA, which provides the necessary acetyl groups to enable the reaction. Acetyl-CoA is produced in the cytosol by ACLY using citrate
exported from the TCA cycle in mitochondria. α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) is an essential cofactor of 2-OGDD, including the histone demethylases JMJDs and
TET DNA demethylases. Succinate is the product of 2-OGDD enzymes reactions and thus, when it accumulates, it works as an antagonist of the reaction.
2-HG and fumarate can also rewire the epigenetic landscape of the cells through inhibition of histone and DNA demethylases.

macrophages activated by the polarizing anti-inflammatory signal
IL-425. An increased ACLY activity mediated histone acetylation
and transcriptionally induced a subset of genes associated
with cellular proliferation and production of chemokines25.
These results indicate that a tight coordinated regulation and
context-dependent metabolic control of histone acetylation is
necessary to drive specific macrophages states. In embryonic stem
cell differentiation, as the cells acquire a more quiescent
phenotype the levels of acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation
decrease15. Additionally, mitochondrial respiratory inhibition in
hematopoietic stem cells decreases histone acetylation, which is
associated with a block in cellular differentiation26. Overall, these
studies highlight that acetyl-CoA is not just a passive acetyl group
donor but rather an important signaling molecule involved in the
regulation of the activity of specific transcription factors and
histone marks that ultimately dictate cellular functions by
regulating gene expression.
α-ketoglutarate. α-KG, also known as 2-oxoglutarate, is an obligatory co-substrate for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-
OGDD), a large group of phylogenetically conserved enzymes,
which catalyze hydroxylation reactions on various types of substrates, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolic
intermediates producing CO2 and succinate. The activity of 2-
OGDD is dependent on the intracellular ratio of α-KG to succinate or other inhibitors such as fumarate or 2-Hydroxyglutarate
(2-HG). In addition to α-KG, these hydroxylation reactions
require of Fe2+ as a cofactor and O2 as co-substrate. Ascorbic acid
(vitamin C) also takes part in these reactions by inducing the
reduction of oxidized Fe3+ to Fe2+ and restoring the activity of 2-
OGDD enzymes. In humans, 2-OGDD play a key role in physiologically important processes such as responses to hypoxia and
chromatin modifications. It is important to note that substrate
intracellular concentrations including the levels of α-KG exceed
the enzyme binding site affinity27. Thus, we propose that it is the
accumulation of inhibitors of 2-OGDD reactions, i.e., succinate,
fumarate or 2-HG above α-KG levels that modulate 2-OGDD
enzymes to exert biological effects.
α-KG is a key modulator of the hypoxic response. Prolyl-hydroxylases
PHD1–3 are 2-OGDD enzymes critical in the regulation of the
transcription factor HIF-1, a master regulator of O2 homeostasis. In
normoxia, proline residues located in the oxygen-dependent
degradation domain of HIF-1α are hydroxylated by PHDs. The
hydroxylation of HIF-1α is the signal for the recognition and polyubiquitination of HIF-1α by the VHL protein (von Hippel-Lindau
tumor suppressor), which targets the protein for degradation in the
proteasome. Under limited oxygen conditions or at reduced levels of
α-KG or Fe2+, PHDs activity is impaired, resulting in HIF-1α or
HIF-2α accumulation and translocation to the nucleus where it
promotes changes in the expression of genes related to metabolism,
erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis, as well as stem and immune cell
function28 (Fig. 5). A combination of decreased oxygen levels and
production of mitochondrial ROS diminishes PHDs to increase
HIF-1α29. Mitochondrial ROS accumulation under normoxia can
also inhibit PHDs to activate HIFs30. As discussed below, TCA cycle
intermediates succinate, fumarate and L-2-HG under normoxic
conditions can inhibit PHDs31. Interestingly, in the opposite
direction, the reactivation of PHDs by increased intracellular α-KG
levels in hypoxic cancer cells causes a severe metabolic impairment
that lead to cell death32.
α-KG has multiple functions in physiology by regulating epigenetic
changes. α-KG is also a required substrate of some chromatinmodifying enzymes, including the Jumonji C domain containing
lysine demethylases (KDM2-7), which are the major histone
demethylases and the ten-eleven translocation hydroxylases
(TET1-3) involved in DNA demethylation (Fig. 4). Similar to
PHDs, it has been recently reported that KDM6A and KDM5A
activities are sensitive to changes in O2 levels33, 34. Histone
methylation on single lysine (K) amino acid residues can activate
or repress transcription depending on the particular residue and
the level of methylation. DNA methylation modifies the chromatic structures and typically decreases gene expression by
changing the structure of a single nucleotide. The availability of
α-KG has a direct impact on gene expression and thus can
modulate cellular fate decision by regulating histones and DNA
demethylases. For example, high intracellular levels of α-KG (with
the concomitant increase in the α-KG/succinate ratio) are
necessary to maintain pluripotency by regulating multiple chromatin modifications35.
In macrophages, an important functional role has been
attributed to α-KG in favoring an anti-inflammatory profile
while repressing pro-inflammatory responses36. A primary reason
for increased glutaminolysis in IL-4-activated macrophages is the
increased production of α-KG that contributes to the acquisition
of an anti-inflammatory phenotype by altering the activity of the
histone demethylase Jmjd3. However, in classical macrophages
activation following LPS stimulation, low levels of α-KG was
found to dampen a pro-inflammatory response36. Mechanistically, α-KG suppresses IKKβ activation that is required for the
pro-inflammatory effects driven by the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
pathway in a PHD activity-dependent manner. Furthermore, this
same study described that α-KG produced from glutaminolysis
promotes LPS-induced endotoxin tolerance36. These results
highlight that targeting pathways involved in α-KG production
offers attractive therapeutically opportunities in diseases associated with macrophage malfunction.
2-Hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)
2-HG production and removal. Although 2-HG is not part of
the TCA cycle, this α-KG derived metabolite can be generated
by enzymes in mitochondrial matrix and cytosol. 2-HG competitively inhibits 2-OGDDs and exists in two isomers: L-2-HG
and D-2-HG. Targets of both 2-HG include histone demethylases, TET enzymes that participate in DNA methylation and
PHDs37–39. L- or D-2-HG abundance is limited in normal
tissues however they can reach to millimolar concentrations
under certain pathologic conditions40, 41. The isomer D-2-HG
is accumulated as a consequence of gain-of-function mutations
in the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of IDH42, 43.
Interestingly, IDH1 and IDH2 are the most frequently mutated
metabolic genes in human cancer and are found in multiple
tumor types, including gliomas, acute myelogenous leukemias
(AMLs), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)42–45. Singlepoint mutation of R132 in IDH1 or R172 in IDH2 reorganizes
the active site, causing an increased affinity for NADPH to
promote α-KG reduction at the expense of its principal substrate (isocitrate). The observation of D-2-HG accumulation in
these tumors prompted the community to use the term oncometabolite for the first time. Currently, D-2-HG is being used as
a biomarker to monitor the disease progression, and mutants
IDH1/IDH2-specific inhibitors are in clinical trials for AML
and glioma. Additionally, D-2-HG can be produced
by the promiscuous activity of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
(PHGDH), an enzyme frequently overexpressed in cancer.
Normally, this enzyme catalyzes the first step in the de novo
serine biosynthesis pathway where 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) is
converted to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (3PHP) coupled with
NAD + reduction. However, in human breast cancer cell lines,

PHDGH has been described to convert α-KG to D-2-HG in a
NADH-dependent manner46.
Malate dehydrogenases (MDH) 1 or 2 and lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) A or C can generate L-2-HG47–49 (Fig. 6). MDH2
and MDH1 normally catalyze the conversion of OAA into malate
in mitochondria and cytosol, respectively. The conversion of αKG to L-2-HG by MDHs is coupled with NADH oxidation to
NAD + . In normal conditions, LDH catalyzes the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate. However, LDHA under hypoxia can
generate L-2-HG. The ability of cells to increase L-2-HG in
hypoxic conditions to regulate histone methylation levels,
including H3K9me3 and to reduce cellular reductive stress by
inhibiting key metabolic pathways indicates an important
physiological role of L-2-HG48, 50. Acidic pH has also been
described as a potent driver of L-2-HG production by favoring
the promiscuous activity of LDHA and MDHs enzymes that
utilize α-KG as an alternative substrate51, 52. Mechanistically,
acidic pH generates a protonated form of α-KG that preferentially
binds to LDHA51. An independent study showed that inhibition
of enzymes involved in converting L-2-HG back to α-KG also
accounts for the resulting L-2-HG accumulation observed in
acidic microenvironments52. Importantly, both studies reported
that accumulated levels of L-2-HG in acidic pH lead to
stabilization of HIF-1α in normoxia. As α-KG availability directly
influences the production of L-2-HG, these results bring the
possibility of manipulating α-KG levels as a potential therapeutic
strategy in acidosis.
Pathways for 2-HG removal are evolutionarily conserved. 2-HG
can be converted back to α-KG through the action of the FAD-linked
enzyme 2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (2-HGDH). Humans
have two variants of this enzyme: D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D-2-HGDH) and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase
Fig. 5 TCA cycle metabolites regulate HIF-α stabilization. Under normoxia, HIF-α is hydroxylated by prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) and targeted for
proteasomal degradation by von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) complex. Under hypoxic conditions, PHDs activity is inhibited preventing HIF-α hydroxylation,
which causes its stabilization. HIF-α then translocates to the nucleus where it associates with HIF-1β to activate transcription of HIF target genes involved in
metabolism, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, immune responses, and tumor invasion. In normoxia, ROS released from mitochondria and accumulated levels of
the metabolites succinate, fumarate and L-2-HG can inhibit the activity of PHDs causing a pseudohypoxia state.
Fig. 6 L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) regulates Treg cells function. Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2), its cytosolic counterpart (MDH1) and
lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) A or C in the cytosol can exhibit enzyme promiscuity and catalyze α-KG reduction to L-2-HG. The reaction is coupled with
NADH oxidation to NAD + . L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L-2-HGDH) converts L-2-HG back to α-KG in mitochondria. Accumulated levels of L-2-
HG inhibits the activity of TETs, which are enzymes involved in regulating DNA demethylation. TETs consume oxygen and α-KG as co-substrates
producing CO2 and succinate. The reaction requires of Fe2+ as a cofactor. This mechanism has been observed to specifically repress immunosuppressive
genes when mitochondrial complex III is impaired.

(L-2-HGDH), and both of them are located in the mitochondria. A
deficiency in either of these two enzymes caused by germline
transmission of homozygous mutations can lead to a disease known
as 2-hydroxyglutaric acidurias (2-HGA). D-2-HGA is a rare disease,
with symptoms, including macrocephaly, cardiomyopathy, mental
retardation, hypotonia, and cortical blindness. L-2-HGA is a rare
neurodegenerative disorder that causes hypotonia, tremors, epilepsy,
mental retardation, and psychomotor regression. Notably, it has been
reported that children with L-2-HGA developed medulloblastoma
and glioblastoma multiforme, as well as Wilms tumor53, 54. Moreover, increased L-2-HG levels resulting from reduced expression of L2-HGDH were observed in renal cancer, which suggest a potential
tumorigenic effect for this isomer as well55.
2-HG regulates immune and stem cells functions. All the promiscuous reactions leading to L-2-HG production share in
common the oxidation of NADH, a driver of the reactions when
it accumulates. Elevated NADH levels are a direct consequence of
mitochondrial dysfunction, since one of the essential functions of
complex I is NAD + recycling. Thus, inhibition of mitochondrial
complex III in cancer cells has been shown to increase the production of 2-HG56. Likewise, disruption of complex III activity in
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) promoted an increase in the 2-
HG levels26. Noteworthy, fetal HSC kept their proliferative
capacity in respiration-deficient conditions but were unable to
differentiate. More recently, it has been reported that loss of
mitochondrial complex III in regulatory T cells (Tregs) resulted
in a buildup of 2-HG57. Tregs are key mediators of immunological tolerance and homeostasis. In this study, mice lacking
functional OXPHOS specifically in Tregs developed a lethal
inflammatory disorder causing mice death between the third and
the fourth week of life. Interestingly, complex III-deficient Tregs
lost their suppressive capacity while their proliferation and survival remained unaffected. The transcriptomic profile of complex
III-deficient Tregs compared to wild-type showed differences in
the expression of immune regulatory molecules while maintaining stable FOXP3 expression, the master regulatory transcription
factor of Tregs. In both contexts, in HSCs and Tregs, accumulated
2-HG levels seem to alter the cellular function, which is associated
with hypermethylation of specific histone marks and DNA
methylation.
Interestingly, in Tregs the loci of differentially down-regulated
genes exhibited DNA methylation, suggesting a potential role for
2-HG in contributing to the autoimmune pathological phenotype
of these mice. Accumulated 2-HG due to defective mitochondrial
function then has the ability to mediate cellular signaling by
directly and specifically impacting the expression of immunosuppressive genes to regulate Tregs without affecting other
biological outcomes of this T cells subset (Fig. 6). This study adds
more evidence on the interesting link between 2-HG levels and
the regulation of cell fate in immune cells. For instance, D-2-HG
has been shown to favor T helper 17 (TH17) cells differentiation, a
T-cell population that promotes inflammation by increasing
DNA methylation levels at the Foxp3 locus, which represses the
differentiation of naïve CD4 + T cells towards induced Tregs58.
Glutamate conversion to α-KG by the aspartate aminotransferase
GOT1 was found to be essential for D-2-HG generation and thus
for the regulation of TH17 and induced Tregs fate. Finally, in
mouse CD8 + T cells, elevated levels of L-2-HG in response to Tcell receptor triggering have been reported to favor their
differentiation and antitumor capacity41. Since the expression of
2-OGDDs likely is different among different tissues, the effects of
2-HG are likely to be context dependent. Collectively, 2-HG, a
metabolite that gets accumulated through abnormal metabolic
functions, exert most of the effects through non-metabolic
mechanisms.
Succinate
Succinate as an oncometabolite. Succinate is a TCA cycle metabolite that has multiple intracellular functions, as well as organismal functions. Succinate is considered an oncometabolite that
accumulates due to inactivating mutations in SDH. SDH mutations are commonly found in several cancers, including hereditary paraganglioma (PGL) and pheochromocytoma (PCC)59–62.
Succinate accumulation has an impact in gene expression regulation and promotes tumorigenesis through two main
mechanisms. Succinate is the product of 2-OGDD enzymes
reactions and thus its accumulation inhibits these enzymes.
Consequently, changes in succinate have profound effects in
histones and DNA methylation, changing the epigenetic landscape of the cells and gene expression (Fig. 4). In paraganglioma,
mutations in the SDH genes were found to establish a DNA
hypermethylator phenotype63. SDH-deficient cells displayed an
increased 5-mC/5-hmC ratio and histone methylation, an effect
that was reversed by exogenous addition of α-KG to the culture
medium in vitro. DNA hypermethylation was associated with the
silencing of key genes involved in neuroendocrine differentiation
favoring malignancy. Further studies will determine if analogously to the effects of acetyl-CoA fluctuations in histone acetylation, particular programs get activated to promote histones or
DNA methylation at specific loci instead of global changes in the
presence of high succinate levels. Additionally, succinate can
inhibit PHDs, promoting the accumulation of HIF-1α in the
presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as pseudohypoxia64.
Succinate has an important function in the regulation of innate
immunity. The metabolic profile of LPS treated macrophages
revealed a high abundance of succinate, which induces HIF-1α
stabilization as well as the transcriptional activation of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β65, 66. Succinate oxidation by complex II is necessary to drive the production of IL-1β. Macrophages
lacking the B subunit of SDH showed decreased IL-1β production
and HIF-1α stabilization when stimulated with LPS. The inhibition of SDH in vivo diminished LPS-induced endotoxemia. LPS
stimulation of both succinate oxidation to promote reduction of
the ubiquinone pool accumulation and an increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ψm) raised the production of
mitochondrial ROS through complex I-dependent reverse electron transfer (RET). The excess entry of electrons in the ubiquinone pool from complex II increases the propensity of
electrons to go backward to complex I when the mitochondrial
membrane potential is high. This triggers the generation of
superoxide production from complex I. Thus, the addition of
mitochondrial complex I or II inhibitors decrease IL-1β production and HIF-1α stabilization. The overexpression of an
alternative oxidase (AOX), which is able to help ease up the
excess of electrons in the ubiquinone pool, decreases LPS
induction of ROS levels and production of IL-1β in macrophages.
An independent study showed that E. coli or S. enterica-challenged macrophages stimulate mitochondrial complex II activity
at the expense of complex I activity further supporting an
importing role for SDH in promoting a pro-inflammatory phenotype67. The inhibition of complex II by treating mice with
NPA, hampered the pro-inflammatory function of macrophages.
Succinate-driven RET induction of ROS is not only limited to
immune cells as ischemia reperfusion injury in heart and brain
requires RET68, 69. Currently, strategies to diminish RET by using
complex II or I inhibitors are being tested in the clinic.
Succinate has organismal effects. Beyond its intracellular signaling
role, succinate release has been shown to signal through the Gprotein-coupled receptor succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1). The
ligand for this receptor was unknown up until 2004 when He

et al.70 described that binding of succinate to SUCNR1 induces an
hypertensive effect by modulating the renin-angiotensin system.
Since then, multiple signaling cascades have been described upon
succinate binding to the receptor in various cell types, including
dendritic cells and macrophages where it seems to contribute to
their functionality in driving inflammation71. Taken together,
these studies highlight that succinate oxidation is central and a
main regulator of the immune effector cells functions. Finally, it is
worth noting that recent findings describe succinate as a systemic
molecule that activates thermogenesis in brown adipocytes upon
cold exposure72. In this condition, brown adipocytes exhibited a
high avidity to uptake elevated circulating succinate that was then
oxidized by SDH increasing ROS levels and UCP1 activity. It will
be interesting to see if additional TCA cycles metabolites can
signal systemic responses in other contexts.
Fumarate
Fumarate promotes tumor growth through diverse signaling
functions. Accumulation of fumarate to millimolar levels due to
inactivating mutations of fumarate hydratase (FH) is found in the
genetic disorder fumaric aciduria, as well as the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC)73, in which fumarate
causes hypermethylation of DNA by inhibiting TET enzymes to
trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)74. Fumarate is a
potent inhibitor of 2-OGDD enzymes75, 76 and thus, it also
contributes to the pseudohypoxia state that characterized FHdeficient tumors by allowing HIF-1α stabilization even under
normoxic conditions through the inhibition of the PHDs
enzymes77. Fumarate is an electrophile and can cause succination
of proteins, a process where fumarate binds and inactivates
reactive thiol protein cysteine residues. This protein modification
was first identified in the context of diabetes where elevated levels
of fumarate contribute to a progressive deterioration of β cells
function78, 79. Specifically, succination of critical cysteine in
GAPDH, GMPR and PARK7/DJ-1 were found in mice lacking
Fh1 that develop progressive glucose intolerance and diabetes at
around week 6–8 after birth. In HLRCC, fumarate drives the
succination of KEAP1, the negative regulator of the master
antioxidant transcription factor NRF280–82. Other studies have
shown that high levels of fumarate increase ROS signaling by
binding glutathione83, 84. Succination following fumarate accumulation has also been shown to cause the loss of the mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) activity, which is crucial for
iron–sulfur cluster binding85. Finally, the iron-responsive element
binding protein 2 (IRP2) that promotes the transcription of
transferrin and the family of iron–sulfur (Fe-SA) cluster biogenesis proteins have also been described to be succinated when
fumarate accumulates in cancer cells86.
Fumarate is an anti-inflammatory signal. Fumarate also functions as an immunomodulator by controlling chromatin modifications (Fig. 4) and regulating protein succination.
Specifically, the accumulation of fumarate through glutamine
anaplerosis in response to pro-inflammatory insults has been
shown to be necessary for trained immunity and inflammation
by inhibiting KDM5 histone demethylase activity87. The inhibition of KDM5 increases the levels of H3K4me3, a marker of
active gene transcription at the promoters of Tnfα and Il6
cytokines. Fumarate has also been shown to accumulate in LPSactivated macrophages65, 88. Furthermore, fumarate derivatives
like dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a potent electrophile, can regulate T-cell functions89. DMF is currently being used in the
clinic to treat autoimmune conditions, including multiple
sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis. Using an unbiased proteomic
approach, Blewett et al.89 discovered that different proteins in
T cells are sensitive to covalent modifications of cysteines
induced by DMF. Among these proteins, the authors identified
protein kinase C θ (PKCθ) that can no longer associate with the
costimulatory receptor CD28 in the presence of DMF preventing
T-cell activation. Importantly, the authors showed how a
mutation of these DMF-sensitive cysteines impaired PKCθCD28 interactions and T-cell activation recapitulating the effects
observed with DMF89. Recently, succination of GAPDH that
leads to the inactivation of its enzymatic activity has also been
identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from
mice and patients with MS treated with DMF90. Endogenous
fumarate was also found to inhibit GAPDH through succination
in mouse and human macrophages. These results suggest that
DMF modulate the activity of immune cells by negatively regulating glycolysis, a metabolic pathway required for the activation and proliferation of different subsets of T cells91.
Itaconate
Itaconate is an important immunomodulator and antibacterial
agent. Itaconate is derived from the decarboxylation of the TCA
cycle intermediate cis-aconitate. Accumulation of itaconate
occurs in the lungs of mice infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis92 and in macrophages activated with LPS93. The immuneresponsive gene 1 protein (IRG1) is the enzyme responsible for
itaconate production. IRG1 was consequently renamed as cisaconitate decarboxylase after this discovery. IRG1 loss of function
in macrophages infected with Salmonella enterica had reduced
aconitate levels and decreased anti-bactericidal activity94. The
anti-bactericidal properties of itaconate are derived from its
ability to inhibit isocitrate lyase, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate
shunt, a pathway required for the survival of many parasites
especially under poor glucose conditions. LPS also induces IRG1
to trigger the accumulation of itaconate, which consequently
limits IL-1β production95, 96.
Itaconate induces electrophilic stress. Initially, itaconate was
shown to inhibit SDH thus limiting succinate oxidation and this
was assumed to be the primary mechanism by which itaconate
limits inflammation95, 96. However, itaconate is a relatively weak
competitive inhibitor of SDH raising the possibility that there are
other mechanisms to account for itaconate’s anti-inflammatory
activity. Recent studies indicate that itaconate activates pathways
downstream of the antioxidant transcription factor NRF2, as well
as NRF2 independent mechanisms that contribute to its antiinflammatory properties in activated macrophages. Itaconate has
electrophilic properties that can disrupt KEAP1 interaction with
NRF297. Itaconate can also inhibit the NF-κB inhibitor IκBζ to
dampen LPS stimulation of inflammation98. Interestingly, derivatives of itaconate such as octyl-itaconate or dimethyl-itaconate,
which are strong electrophiles, diminish pro-inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo97, 98. The administration of
dimethyl-itaconate in vivo ameliorated the outcome of an IL17–IκBζ-driven skin pathology in a mouse model of psoriasis.
These results significantly extended the knowledge of itaconate
biology and raised the possibility of using itaconate derivatives as
a therapeutic agent in autoimmune diseases. However, since high
levels of itaconate might cause a B12 deficiency, the safety of
long-term exposures to itaconate needs to be evaluated99.
Conclusion
In the past two decades, mitochondrial biology has undergone a
renaissance partly due to the appreciation that mitochondria have
important biological functions beyond ATP and macromolecules

production. Indeed, mitochondria have evolved from passive to
active players in determining cell fate and function. Mechanistically, TCA cycle metabolites have been demonstrated to control transcription factors and chromatin modifications to change
cell function and fate. However, in many contexts the molecular
details of how changes in TCA cycle metabolites abundance affect
the expression of specific genes remains to be elucidated. Future
investigations might also discover additional mechanisms by
which TCA cycle metabolites exert signaling functions beyond
post-translational modifications. Emerging evidence indicates
that beyond cell autonomous functions, TCA cycle metabolites
control physiology through non-cell autonomous functions.
Discovering systemic effects of metabolites and their role in
communicating different parts of the body will be of much
interest for the field in the upcoming years. A fascinating development is the use of derivatives of TCA cycle metabolites to
ameliorate inflammatory diseases in humans. We hope to see
more of the recent findings of TCA cycle signaling effects being
translated into the clinic. Going forward, we predict that TCA
cycle metabolites will continue to shed new light on biology,
physiology, and diseases.
