Abstract
Radiomics is a quantitative approach to medical imaging, which aims at enhancing the existing data available to
clinicians by means of advanced mathematical analysis. Through mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of
signal intensities and pixel interrelationships, radiomics quantifies textural information by using analysis methods from
the field of artificial intelligence. Various studies from different fields in imaging have been published so far,
highlighting the potential of radiomics to enhance clinical decision-making. However, the field faces several important
challenges, which are mainly caused by the various technical factors influencing the extracted radiomic features.
The aim of the present review is twofold: first, we present the typical workflow of a radiomics analysis and deliver a
practical “how-to” guide for a typical radiomics analysis. Second, we discuss the current limitations of radiomics,
suggest potential improvements, and summarize relevant literature on the subject.

Background
Like many other areas of human activity in the last decades, medicine has seen a constant increase in the
digitalization of the information generated during clinical routine. As more medical data became available in
digital format, new and always more sophisticated software was developed to analyze them. At the same time,
the research on artificial intelligence (AI) has long
reached a point where its methods and software tools
have become not only powerful, but also accessible
enough to leave the computer science departments and
find applications in an increasing variety of domains. As
a consequence, the recent years have witnessed a continuous increase of AI applications in the medical sector,
aiming at facilitating repetitive tasks clinicians encounter
in their daily clinical workflows and to support clinical
decision-making.
The different techniques used in AI—i.e., mainly machine learning and deep learning algorithms—are especially useful when it comes to the emerging field of “big
data”. Big data is defined as “a term that describes large
volumes of high velocity, complex and variable data that
require advanced techniques and technologies to enable
the capture, storage, distribution, management, and analysis of the information.” 1 Due to the high amount of
multi-dimensional information, techniques from the
field of AI are needed to extract the desired information
from these data.

In medicine, various ways to generate big data exist,
including the widely known fields of genomics, proteomics, or metabolomics. Similar to these “omics” clusters,
imaging has been used increasingly to generate a dedicated omics cluster itself called “radiomics”. Radiomics
is a quantitative approach to medical imaging, which
aims at enhancing the existing data available to clinicians by means of advanced, and sometimes nonintuitive mathematical analysis. The concept of radiomics, which has most broadly (but not exclusively) been
applied in the field of oncology, is based on the assumption that biomedical images contain information of
disease-specific processes [1] that are imperceptible by
the human eye [2] and thus not accessible through traditional visual inspection of the generated images.
Through mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of signal intensities and pixel interrelationships,
radiomics quantifies textural information [3, 4] by using
analysis methods from the field of AI. In addition, visual
appreciable differences in image intensity, shape, or texture can be quantified by means of radiomics, thus overcoming the subjective nature of image interpretation.
Thus, radiomics does not imply any automation of the
diagnostic processes, rather it provides existing ones
with additional data.
Radiomics analysis can be performed on medical images from different modalities, allowing for an integrated
cross-modality approach using the potential additive
value of imaging information extracted, e.g., from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography
(CT), and positron-emission-tomography (PET), instead
of evaluating each modality by its own. However, the
current state-of-the-art of the research still shows lack
of stability and generalization, and the specific study
conditions and the authors’ choices have still a great influence on the results.
In this work, we present the typical workflow of a
radiomics analysis, discussing the current limitations of
this approach, suggesting potential improvements, and
commenting relevant literature on the subject.
Radiomics–how to?
The following section will give a practical advice on
“how to do radiomics” by illustrating each of the required steps in the radiomics pipeline (illustrated in
Fig. 1) and highlighting important points.
Step 1: image segmentation
For any radiomics approach, delineation of the region of
interest (ROI) in two-dimensional (2D) or of the volume
of interest (VOI) in three-dimensional (3D) approaches
is the crucial first step in the pipeline. ROIs/VOIs define
the region in which radiomic features are calculated.
Image segmentation might be done manually, semiautomatically (using standard image segmentation algorithms such as region-growing or thresholding), or fully
automatically (nowadays using deep learning algorithms). A variety of different software solutions—either
open-source or commercial—are available, such as 3D
Slicer 2 [5], MITK 3
, ITK-SNAP 4, MeVisLab 5, LifEx 6,
or ImageJ 7 [6], to name only some frequently used
open-source tools. For reviews on various different tools
for image segmentation, please refer to [7, 8].
Manual and semi-automated image segmentation
(usually with manual correction) are the most often encountered methods but have several drawbacks. Firstly,
manual segmentation is time-consuming – depending
on how many images and datasets have to be segmented.
Second, manual and semi-automated segmentation
introduce a considerable observer-bias, and studies have
shown that many radiomic features are not robust
against intra- and inter-observer variations concerning
ROI/VOI delineation [9]. Consequently, studies using
manual or semi-automated image segmentation with
manual correction should perform assessments of intraand inter-observer reproducibility of the derived radiomic features and exclude non-reproducible features from
further analyses.
Deep learning-based image segmentation (often using
some sort of U-Net [10]) is rapidly emerging and many
different algorithms have already been trained for image
segmentation tasks of various organs (currently, most of
them being useful for the segmentation of entire organs,
but not for segmentation of dedicated tumor regions),
several of them being published as open-source. Since
recently, there are also several possibilities for integration of such algorithms in platforms like 3D Slicer or
MITK. Automated image segmentation certainly is the
best option, since it avoids intra- and inter-observer variability of radiomic features. However, generalizability of
trained algorithms currently is a major limitation, and
applying those algorithms on a different dataset often results in complete failure. Thus, further research has to
be devoted to the development of robust and
generalizable algorithms for automated image
segmentation.
Step 2: image processing
Image processing is located between the image segmentation and feature extraction step. It represents the attempt to homogenize images from which radiomic

features will be extracted with respect to pixel spacing,
grey-level intensities, bins of the grey-level histogram,
and so forth. Preliminary results have shown that the
test-retest robustness of radiomic features extracted
largely depends on the image processing settings used
[11–15]. In order to allow for reproducible research, it is
therefore important to report each detail of the image
processing step.
Several of the above-mentioned software platforms
(namely, 3D Slicer and LifEx) have integrations for

radiomics analyses. 3D Slicer has incorporated an installable plugin for the open-source pyRadiomics package
[16] (which can otherwise be used within a solo Python
framework), whereas LifEx is a stand-alone platform
with integrated segmentation and texture analysis tools
and a graphical user interface. The image processing
step in the pyRadiomics package (which currently is one
of the most commonly used packages for radiomics analyses) can be defined by writing a so-called parameter
file (in a YAML or JSON structured text file). This parameter file can be loaded into 3D Slicer or be incorporated into a Python framework. Example parameter files
for different modalities can be found in the pyRadiomics
GitHub repository8
.
Interpolation to isotropic voxel spacing is necessary for
most texture feature sets to become rotationally invariant and to increase reproducibility between different
datasets [17]. Currently, there is no clear recommendation whether upsampling or downsampling should be
the preferred method. In addition, data from different
modalities might need different approaches for image
interpolation. CT, for example, usually delivers isotropic
datasets, whereas MRI often delivers non-isotropic data
with need for different approaches to interpolation. After
applying interpolation algorithms to the image, the delineated ROI/VOI should also be interpolated. For a detailed description of image interpolation and different
interpolation algorithms, please refer to [17].
Range re-segmentation and intensity outlier filtering
(normalization) are performed to remove pixels/voxels
from the segmented region that fall outside of a specified
range of grey-levels [17]. Whereas range re-segmentation
usually is required for CT and PET data (e.g., for excluding pixels/voxels of air or bone within a tumor ROI/VOI),
range re-segmentation is not possible for data with arbitrary intensity units such as MRI. For MRI data, intensity
outlier filtering is applied. The most commonly used
method is to calculate the mean μ and standard deviation
σ of grey-levels within the ROI/VOI and to exclude greylevels outside the range μ ± 3σ [17–19].
The last image processing step is discretization of
image intensities inside the ROI/VOI (Fig. 2).
Discretization consists in grouping the original values
according to specific range intervals (bins); the procedure is conceptually equivalent to the creation of a histogram. This step is required to make feature calculation
tractable [20].
Three parameters characterize discretization: the range
of the discretized quantity, the number of bins, and their
width (size). The range equals the product of the bin
number times the bin width; therefore, only two of the
parameters can be freely set. Different combinations can
lead to different results; the choice of the three parameters is usually influenced by the context, e.g., to simplify
the comparison with other works using a particular
binning:
 The range is usually preserved from the original
data, but exceptions are not uncommon, e.g. when
the discretized data is to be compared with some
reference dataset or when ROIs with much smaller
range than the original have to be analyzed. It is
worth mentioning that when the range is not
preserved and if the number of bins is particularly
small, the choice of the range boundaries can have a
strong impact on the results;
 Fixing the bin number (as is the case of discretizing
grey-level intensities) normalizes images and is especially beneficial in data with arbitrary intensity units
(e.g., MRI) and where contrasts are considered important [17]. Thus, it is the recommended
discretization method for MRI data, although this
recommendation is not without controversies (for
further discussion, please refer to the relative pyRadiomics documentation9
). The use of a fixed bin
number discretization is thought to make radiomic
features more reproducible across different samples,
since the absolute values of many features depend
on the number of grey levels within the ROI/VOI;
 Fixing the bin size results in having direct control
on the absolute range represented on each bin,
therefore allowing the bin sequence to have an
immediate relationship with the original intensity
scale (such as Hounsfield units or standardized
uptake values). This approach makes it possible to
compare discretized data with different ranges, since
the bins belonging to the overlapping range will
represent the same data interval. For that reason,
previous work recommends the use of a fixed bin
size for PET images [14]. It is recommended to use
identical minimum values for all samples, defined by
the lower bound of the re-segmentation range
A still open question is the optimal bin number/bin
width which should be used in this discretization step.
This question becomes particularly important when considering that the discretization is equivalent to averaging
the values within each bin, and the effect is similar to
applying a smoothing filter on the data distribution.
When the bins are too wide (too few), features can be
averaged out and lost; when the bins are too small (too
many), features can become indistinguishable from

noise. A balance is reached when discretization can filter
out the noise while preserving the interesting features; unfortunately, this implies that the optimal choice of binning
is highly dependent from the both data acquisition parameters (noise) and content (features). As an example, previous
preliminary work has shown that different MRI sequences
might need different bin numbers for obtaining robust and
reproducible radiomics features [11]. Moreover, small number of bins can generate undesired dependencies on the
particular choice of range and bin boundaries, thus undermining the robustness of the analysis. The present recommendation is to always start by inspecting the histogram of
the data from which radiomic features are to be extracted
and to decide upon a reasonable set of parameters for the
discretization step based on the experience.
Step 3: feature extraction
After image segmentation and processing, extraction of
radiomic features can finally be performed. Feature extraction refers to the calculation of features as a final
processing step, where feature descriptors are used to
quantify characteristics of the grey levels within the
ROI/VOI [17]. Since many different ways and formulas
exist to calculate those features, adherence to the Image
Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guidelines
[17] is recommended. These guidelines offer a consensus
for standardized feature calculations from all radiomic
feature matrices. Different types (i.e., matrices) of radiomic features exist, the most often encountered ones being intensity (histogram)-based features, shape features,
texture features, transform-based features, and radial
features. In addition, different types of filters (e.g., wavelet or Gaussian filters) are often applied during the feature extraction step. In practice, feature extraction
means simply pressing the “run” button and waiting for
the computation to be finished.
Step 4: feature selection/dimension reduction
Depending on the software package used for feature extraction and the number of filters applied during the process,
the number of extracted features to deal with during the
following step of statistical analysis and machine learning
ranges between a few and, in theory, unlimited. The higher
the number of features/variables in a model and/or the
lower the number of cases in the groups, e.g., for a classification task, the higher the risk of model overfitting.
As a consequence, reducing the number of features to
build statistical and machine learning models during a
step called feature selection or dimension reduction is of
crucial importance for generating valid and generalizable
results. Several “rules of thumb” may exist for defining
the optimal number of features for a given sample size,
but no true evidence for these rules exists in the literature. For some guidance regarding study design or sample size calculation, please consider reference [21]. The
dimension reduction is a multi-step process, leading to
exclusion of non-reproducible, redundant, and nonrelevant features from the dataset.
Multiple ways for dimension reduction and feature selection exist among researchers. The following steps reflect our personal experience and have been performed
in several clinical studies so far [2, 22–27] (Fig. 3).
The first step should involve exclusion of nonreproducible features, if manual or semi-automated
ROI/VOI delineation was used during the image segmentation step. A feature which suffers from higher
intra- or interobserver variability is not likely to be informative, e.g., for assessing therapeutic response. Similarly, the test-retest robustness of the extracted features
should be assessed (e.g., using a phantom). Non-robust
features should also be excluded if the study aim is the
evaluation of longitudinal data, although it is important
that the relevant change of features over time is incorporated into the selection procedure [28]. Simply assessing
reproducibility/robustness by calculation of intra-classcorrelation coefficients (ICCs) might not be sufficient
since ICCs are known to depend on the natural variance
of the underlying data. Recommendations for assessing
reproducibility, repeatability, and robustness can be
found in [29].

van Timmeren et al. Insights into Imaging (2020) 11:91 Page 5 of 16

The second step in the feature selection process is the
selection of the most relevant variables for the respective
task. Various approaches often relying on machine learning techniques can be used for this initial feature selection step, such as knock-off filters, recursive feature
elimination methods, or random forest algorithms.
Since these algorithms often do not account for collinearities and correlations in the data, building correlation clusters represents the logical next—third—step in the
dimension reduction workflow. In some cases, this step
might be combined with the previous (second) step since
few machine learning techniques are able to account for
correlations within the data. The majority, however, is not.
Correlation clusters (for an example, see Fig. 3) visualize
clusters of highly correlated features in the data and allow
selection of only one representative feature per correlation
cluster. This selection process again might be based on machine learning algorithms and/or on conventional statistical
methods and data visualization. As a general principle, the
variable with the highest biological-clinical variability in the
dataset should be selected since it might be most representative of the variations within the specific patient cohort.
The data visualization step is also of high importance once
the dimensionality of the data has been reduced.
Finally, the remaining, non-correlated and highly relevant features can be used to train the model for the respective classification task. Although the present review
does not aim to cover the model training and selection
process, the importance of splitting the dataset into a
training and at least an independent testing dataset (for
optimal conditions even an additional validation dataset)
cannot be stressed enough [30]. This is especially
relevant given the limitations currently encountered in
the field of radiomics as discussed in the following
section.
Current limitations in radiomics
Although radiomics has shown its potential for diagnostic,
prognostic, and predictive purposes in numerous studies,
the field is facing several challenges. The existing gap between knowledge and clinical needs results in studies lacking clinical utility. In case a clinically relevant question is
considered, the reproducibility of radiomic studies is often
poor, due to lack of standardization, insufficient reporting,
or limited open source code and data. Also, the lack of
proper validation and the subsequent risk of false-positive
results hampers the translation to clinical practice [31].
Moreover, the interpretability of the features, especially
those derived from texture matrices and/or after filtering,
mistakes in the interpretation of the results (e.g., causation
vs. correlation), or the lack of comparison with wellestablished prognostic and predictive factors, results in
reservation towards its use in clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, radiomics studies are often based on
retrospectively collected data and thus have low level of evidence and mainly serve as proof-of-concept, whereas prospective studies are required to confirm the value of
radiomics.
Due to the retrospective nature of radiomic studies,
imaging protocols, including acquisition, and reconstruction settings, are often not controlled or standardized.
For each image modality, multiple studies have assessed
the impact of these settings on radiomic features or
attempted to minimize their influence by eliminating
Fig. 3 Dimension reduction and feature selection workflow
van Timmeren et al. Insights into Imaging (2020) 11:91 Page 6 of 16

features that are sensitive to these variabilities. Although
these studies are relevant to create awareness of the influencing factors, it should be noted that the information
is often not directly helpful to future studies. The reproducibility of radiomic features is not necessarily
generalizable to different disease sites, modalities, or
scanners, e.g., robust features in one disease site are
not necessarily robust in another disease site [32].
Moreover, in case robust radiomic features are
assessed using cut-off values of correlation coefficients, one should be aware that these cut-offs are
often arbitrarily chosen and the number of “robust”
features depend on the number of subjects involved.
Furthermore, for the generalizability of robustness
studies, it is important that radiomic feature calculations are compliant with the IBSI guidelines [17].
Apart from the variations in scanners and settings,
radiomic feature values are also influenced by patient
variabilities, e.g., geometry, which impact the levels of
noise and presence of artifacts in an image. Therefore, the aim of a recent study was to quantify these
so-called “non-reducible technical variations” and
stabilize the radiomic features accordingly [33].
The next sections summarize the studies that
assessed radiomic feature robustness for different acquisition and reconstruction settings of CT, PET, and
MRI, as well as for ROI delineation and image preprocessing steps. Figure 4 provides an overview of factors that have been investigated in literature for their influence on radiomic feature values. In Tables 1, 2, and 3,
the studies are collected in one overview for all three modalities considered in this review: CT, MRI, and PET, respectively. A recent review provides an overview of
existing phantoms that have been used for radiomics for
all three modalities [120].
CT and PET CT
Multiple studies (16 were identified in this review) have
investigated the stability over test-retest scenarios for
CT radiomics (Table 1), where the publicly available
RIDER Lung CT collection was often evaluated [121].
For PET, only a few test-retest studies were performed,
which were either on a phantom or lung cancer data
(Table 2). Recently, an extensive review on factors influencing PET radiomics was published [122].

The voxel size was the mostly investigated influencing
reconstruction factor for CT, whereas this was the fullwidth half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian filter for
PET. Four and 12 studies were identified that studied
the influence of image discretization on CT and PET
radiomic features, respectively. Figure 4 provides an
overview of factors that have been investigated in literature for their influence on radiomic feature values.
MRI
The impact of test-retest, acquisition and reconstruction
settings, segmentation, and image pre-processing has
been explored less extensively to date than for PET and
CT. Only four studies were found that investigated the
influence of reconstruction settings, one of these studies
included patient images. The influence of segmentation
on MRI radiomic features has been more extensively
studied for a variety of tumor sites. Table 3 summarizes
the present literature for influencing factors on radiomic
features in MRI. Figure 4 provides an overview of factors
that have been investigated in literature for their influence on radiomic feature values.
Reduce radiomics’ dependency
Recent literature regarding the robustness for different acquisition and reconstruction settings, ROI delineation,
and image pre-processing steps shows that the most commonly used approach to deal with this is to eliminate
radiomic features that are not robust against these factors.
The drawback of this method is that potentially relevant
information could be removed, whereas stability not necessarily means informativity. A few solutions have been
proposed in order to reduce the influence of the aforementioned factors on radiomics studies. One proposed solution is to eliminate the dependency of features on a
certain factor by modeling the relationship and applying

corrections accordingly. This had been explored recently
for different CT exposure settings [123]. Another method
to eliminate the dependency is to convert images using
deep learning, in order to simulate reconstruction with
different settings, which was shown to improve CT radiomics’ reproducibility for images reconstructed with different kernels [62]. This approach has the potential to solve
other radiomics dependencies to improve robustness in
the future. Different than image-wise dependency corrections, post-reconstruction batch harmonization has been
proposed in order to harmonize radiomic feature sets originating from different institutes, which is a method called
ComBat [124–126]. Furthermore, a recent study investigated the performance of data augmentation instead of
feature elimination to incorporate the knowledge on influencing factors on radiomic features [127].
Open-source data
Publicly available datasets like the RIDER dataset 10 help
to gain knowledge about the impact of varying factors in
radiomics [121]. Also, the availability of a public phantom
dataset, intended for radiomics reproducibility tests on
CT, could help to further assess the influence of acquisition settings in order to eliminate non-robust radiomic
features [128]. However, studies are needed to show if robustness data acquired on a phantom can be translated to
the human. Similar initiatives for PET and MRI would
help to understanding of the impact of changes in settings
on radiomics. In other words, open-source data plays an
important role in the future improvement of radiomics.
Solution: quality control and standardization
In order to increase the chance of clinically relevant and
valuable radiomics studies, we would recommend
verifying whether the following questions could be answered with “yes,” prior to commencement of the study:
 Is there an actual clinical need which could
potentially be answered with (the help of)
radiomics?
 Is there enough expertise in the research team,
preferably from at least two different disciplines, to
ensure high quality of the study and potential of
clinical implementation?
 Is there access to enough data to support the
conclusions with sufficient power, including external
validation datasets?
 Is it possible to retrieve all other non-imaging data
that is known to be relevant for the research question (e.g., from biological information,
demographics)?
 Is information on the acquisition and reconstruction
of the images available?
 Are the imaging protocols standardized and if not, is
there a solution to harmonize images or to ensure
minimal influence of varying settings on the
modeling?
Besides these general questions, which should been asked
before the start of a study, there are some recent contributions in the field that aim to facilitate the execution of radiomics studies with higher quality: (1) IBSI: harmonization of
radiomics implementations and guidelines on reporting of
radiomic studies [17, 129], (2) Radiomics Quality Score
(RQS): checklist to ensure quality of radiomics studies [130],
and (3) Transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction
model for individual prognosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement—guidelines for reporting of prediction models for
prognosis or diagnosis [30]. For the radiomic feature calculation, we recommend to use an implementation that is IBSI
compliant, which could be verified using the publicly

available digital phantom [129, 130]. Also, regarding choices
for image discretization and resampling, we recommend following the IBSI guidelines. Besides that, it is important to be
consistent and transparent, and detailed reporting on the
pre-processing steps applied to improve reproducibility and
repeatability of radiomic studies need to be ensured.
A recent study evaluated the quality of 77 oncologyrelated radiomics studies using RQS and TRIPOD, and
concluded that “the overall scientific quality and
reporting of radiomics studies is insufficient,” showing
the importance of guidelines and criteria for future studies [131].
Outlook: workflow integration
While currently many research efforts aim towards
standardization of radiomics, translation into clinical
practice also requires adequate implementation of radiomics analyses into the clinical workflow once the

standardization issue has been adequately addressed and
clinical utility has been proven in prospective clinical
trials.
A useful radiomics tool should seamlessly integrate
into the clinical radiological workflow and be incorporated into or interfaced with existing RIS/PACS systems.
Such systems should provide segmentation tools or
ideally deep learning-based automated segmentation
methods as well as standardized feature extraction algorithms and modality-adjusted image processing adhering
to the standards described above. In case of fully automated segmentation, the possibility to inspect and
manually correct the segmentation results should be
incorporated.
In a future workflow, known important radiomics features could then be displayed alongside other quantitative imaging biomarkers and the images themselves. The
radiologist could then use all these information to support his clinical judgement or—where possible—estimate, e.g., prognostic factors.
It is, however, important to note, that radiomics
should only be viewed as an additional tool and not as a
standalone diagnostic algorithm. Certainly, many challenges lie ahead until radiomics can be integrated in our
daily routine: from the above-mentioned issues surrounding image standardization to legal issues that will
certainly arise regarding regulatory issues. Nonetheless,
it could prove a valuable if not critical step towards a
more integrated approach to healthcare.
Conclusions
Throughout the radiomics workflow, multiple factors have
been identified that influence the feature values, including
random variations in scanner and patients, image acquisition and reconstruction settings, ROI segmentation, and
image preprocessing. Several studies have proposed to either eliminate unstable features, correct for influencing
factors, or harmonize datasets in order to improve the robustness of radiomics. Recently published guidelines and
checklists aim to improve the quality of future radiomics
studies, but transparency has been recognized as the most
important factor for reproducibility. Assessment of clinical
relevance and impact prior to study commencement, increased level of evidence using studies with large enough
datasets and external validation, and its combination with
established methods will help moving the field towards
clinical implementation.
