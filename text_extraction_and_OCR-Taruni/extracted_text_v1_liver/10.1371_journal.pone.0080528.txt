Abstract
Management of recurrent Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection following liver transplantation remains a major challenge.
In non-transplanted HCV genotype 1 patients, the introduction of protease inhibitor-based regimens has significantly
increased the rate of sustained virological response. In this follow-up study, on the first published cohort of post-liver
transplant patients treated with telaprevir-based triple therapy, we investigated both efficacy and safety data in followup to 24 weeks (SVR 24) after end of treatment (EOT). SVR 24 efficacy and safety data from 9 liver transplant HCV
patients being treated with telaprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, showed 5 of the transplanted patients
accomplished the full duration of the 48 week triple therapy.
Notable were the 4 patients found to be HCV RNA-negative at week 4, and 8 patients at week 12. Upon EOT, at
week 48, 6 patients were HCV RNA-negative. Importantly, at follow-up (24 weeks after EOT), a favorable sustained
virological response rate was observed in 5 of these patients with HCV RNA remaining negative, including in one
patient who discontinued treatment prematurely. Due to side effects, 2 patients discontinued, 2 suffered from
virological breakthrough after the telaprevir treatment phase, and 1 patient had a relapse after EOT. Two thirds of
patients exhibited hematological side effects requiring ribavirin dose reductions, administration of erythropoetin, or
even blood transfusions.
This retrospective analysis provides evidence that - with respect to SVR 24 - liver transplant patients suffering from
HCV genotype 1 recurrence may benefit from a telaprevir-based triple therapy as this new regimen showed
acceptable antiviral efficacy in this small cohort of mostly pre-treated patients. Management of drug-drug interactions
is challenging, but feasible. In part severe side effects are frequent during treatment and require therapeutic
interventions.

Introduction
In 2011 the first direct acting antivirals (DAA), the drug class
of protease inhibitors (PI) represented by boceprevir and
telaprevir (TVR), were approved by the authorities for treatment
of chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infections. Due
to superior antiviral efficacy in combination with pegylated
interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) their use was quickly
adopted in the clinic [1,2] even though management of side
effects was more time intensive and costly, compared to the
former dual therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV alone.
Despite this major innovation, difficult-to-treat populations
remained; (i) patients with liver cirrhosis, (ii) non-response

patients, (iii) elderly patients, and especially (iv) patients with
recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation (LT).
Following successful treatment of HCV, post-LT patients
have been shown to exhibit significantly reduced morbidity
rates corresponding to increased survival times [3,4]. The
translation of this superior antiviral efficacy of PI-based triple
therapies from non-LT to post-LT patients therefore constitutes
a very attractive goal [5-7]. However, there were concerns
regarding any post-LT application of PI-based triple therapies.
The main concerns were the potentially complex drug-drug
interactions between immunosuppressive agents and PI due to
the shared metabolic pathway CYP 3A4 [8], possibly resulting
in over or under-dosing of both competing drugs and resulting
in a loss of efficacy or increased toxicity/ side effects of these
agents.
However, in recent work we have been able to demonstrate
that management of a TVR-based triple therapy regimen in
patients post-LT is feasible with respect to drug-drug
interactions, although side effects were common [9]. In this
small pilot study the viral response was shown to be excellent
with no treated patients showing any detectable HCV viral load
at the end of the TVR phase of the TVR-based triple therapy
(treatment week 12)[9].
The aim of this follow-up study is to retrospectively evaluate
the antiviral efficacy and safety of the TVR triple therapy in
post-LT patients with respect to sustained viral response rates
24 weeks (SVR 24) after planned discontinuation of PEG-IFN
and RBV (week 48 of treatment).
Patients and Methods
In this study, 9 patients who were being consecutively
treated for the recurrence of HCV genotype 1 post-LT were
included [9]. The mean age of the patients was 60.9 years and
the majority of patients were male (7 patients). All patients had
a liver biopsy at least once post-LT and the median Ishak
fibrosis score was 2 (the maximum possible score was 6). Liver
function post-LT was compensated, except for 1 patient who
suffered from a cholestatic recurrence of HCV. The
immunosuppressive regimens were heterogeneous: 4 patients
received tacrolimus (TAC), 4 patients were on cyclosporine A
(CSA), and 1 patient received sirolimus (SIR) as the main
immunosuppressive agent. 4 patients were given
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as co-medication. 5 patients
received low-dose steroids (2.5 - 5 mg/day; Table 1). 7 patients
with HCV genotype 1b and 2 patients with HCV genotype 1a
were included in our study. As for the IL28B gene
polymorphism, 8 of the 9 patients had the CT genotype; 1
patient exhibited the most unfavorable TT genotype. 7 study
patients had received antiviral treatment at least once before
LT, and 8 patients had undergone antiviral treatment at least
once post-LT; notably, none of these patients had been able to
achieve a sustained clearance of HCV (Table 1). Two patients
were on low-dose PEG-IFN at the beginning of our post-LT
triple therapy (patients 3 and 5; Table 1). Another patient had
suffered from a cholestatic recurrence of an HCV infection just
shortly post-LT (initial viral load 23.9 Mio IU/ml) and therefore
was set on a PEG-IFN plus RBV dual therapy. Then, due to a
primary viral non-response with a rising viral load after having
reached a nadir, TVR was added after 1 month of this dual
therapy (patient 8; Table 1).
This study has been conducted according to the principles
expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethical committee
of the Medical Faculty of the University of Tübingen approved
this retrospective analysis and waived the need for written
informed consent because of the anonymous evaluation of
patient data from patient records. Treatment indication was
discussed in our interdisciplinary transplant board. As limited
experience existed in the post-LT setting, patients were
thoroughly informed of possible known interactions and side
effects prior to the on-ward treatment in our hospitals outpatient
department.
Patients gave verbal consent, as the used medications (TVR,
PEG-IFN, and RBV) were all approved by the authorities for
treatment of HCV. Consent was documented in the medical
records.
For routine assessment of IL28B genotype, written informed
consent was obtained according to German law.
Adjustment of the individualised doses of
immunosuppressants, under TVR-based triple therapy, were
undertaken in our hospital during a 6-8 day stay with on-ward
surveillance; subsequent outpatient surveillance was organized
in collaboration with general practitioners and our outpatient
department. In close consultation with our study center,
dosages were adjusted to hit the individual target ranges of the
different immunosuppressants (CSA, SIR, and TAC). Visits to
the outpatient department were scheduled at weeks 4, 8, 12,
with additional individual appointments as required. After
ending the TVR-based triple treatment, dual therapy with PEGIFN and RBV was extended until treatment week (TW) 48.
After planned discontinuation of TVR, immunosuppressant
dosages were set back to the same doses used pre-exposure
to TVR and were adjusted again individually in response to
measured trough levels. After the first 12 weeks, visits in the
outpatient department were scheduled at least on TW 16 to 18,
24, 36, 48, and on demand. After finishing the triple therapy,
follow-up visits were scheduled monthly until post-treatment
week 12, and then on post-treatment week 24. Thereafter, the
patients were seen in individual intervals according to our postLT routine. During therapy and follow-up, clinical chemistry
parameters as well as HCV viral loads (Roche Cobas
AmpliPrep/Roche Cobas TaqMan, Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany; lower level of quantification (LLOQ) = 15
IU/mL) were measured at TW 0, 4, 8, 12, 16-18, 24, 36, 48, as
well as in the follow-up period (at 1, 2, 3, 6 months post
treatment), and individually between these dates. Clinical
examinations were performed on the same time points and, if
needed, in between.
Results
Efficacy
The mean time of treatment was 33 weeks (range 2 - 48
weeks). 7 of the 9 patients completed the 12-week phase of
TVR-based triple therapy, and 5 of the 9 patients completed
the full-treatment course of 48 weeks. In the intention-to-treat

(ITT) analysis we found that 4 out of the 9 patients were HCV
RNA-negative at TW 4. After 12 weeks of treatment 8 out of 9
patients were HCV RNA-negative, and after 48 weeks of
treatment 6 out of 9 patients were negative, including one
patient who had discontinued treatment prematurely at TW 4
due to side effects.

At 24 weeks of follow-up (SVR 24) 5 out of 9 patients
remained HCV RNA-negative with a mean follow-up time of 30
weeks (range 24 - 56 weeks; see Table 1 and Figure 1 for
details).
In two instances TVR-based triple therapy had to be
discontinued: One patient suffered from bacterial pneumonia at
week 2 (patient 1; Table 1), and the other patient discontinued
at week 4 due to side effects (patient 9; Table 1). The latter
was HCV RNA-negative at the time of discontinuation and
remained HCV RNA-negative thereafter (follow-up of 56
weeks). Two patients exhibited a virological breakthrough at
TW 16 and 28, respectively (patients 3 and 2; Table 1). One
patient had a virological relapse between follow-up weeks 4
and 12 (patient 4; Table 1).
Remarkably, in our cohort 2 out of 5 patients with previous
post-LT non-response to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy were now able
to achieve a SVR 24 under our TVR-based triple therapy
regimen. Of those patients who had not shown a non-response
to a post-LT dual therapy (PEG-IFN monotherapy, PEGIFN/RBV relapse, or breakthrough), or had not received any
antiviral therapy post-LT, 3 out of 4 patients achieved a SVR
24.
Due to the small number of patients in this pilot cohort, it is
not possible to determine any positive predictors for SVR.
Immunosuppression levels after TVR-based triple
therapy
Changes in immunosuppression due to drug-drug
interactions during the first twelve weeks of TVR-triple therapy
are reported in detail in our recent article [9]. In our cohort,
reestablishment of pre-TVR immunosuppressant dosages and
readjustment of daily doses according to measured trough
levels could be permuted without complications. Importantly, no
case of transplant rejection was observed following
discontinuation of TVR, which had constituted a major concern
before initiation of this study.
Side effects
In our cohort, no patients were lost during therapy or followup, although adverse events occurred in most of the patients.
Treatment was ceased due to severe side effects in only one
case (at TW 2). Five patients were hospitalized during
treatment and follow-up because of adverse events. One of
those patients was hospitalized four times for different reasons
(patient 8, Table 1). The reasons for in-hospital treatment up
until TW 12 were: bacterial pneumonia, TAC overdosing with
renal failure, and infectious enteritis with Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis. During the second phase of treatment
covering the period between discontinuation of TVR (at TW 12)
until the end of treatment (EOT) at TW 48, hospitalizations
were due to exacerbated diabetes mellitus, raised liver enzyme
levels caused by histologically proven non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis, and an attack of gout.
In week 5 of the follow up phase one patient (patient 8, Table
1) was admitted to hospital due to increased liver enzymes
(ALT 4 times above upper limit of normal); a liver biopsy
revealed a histologically confirmed acute rejection. After
treatment with high dose prednisolone and addition of MMF,
liver enzyme levels decreased. Thereafter, the patient suffered
from a reactivation of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) with viral DNA
being positive in both plasma and leukocytes. Following preemptive treatment with valganciclovir this patient’s liver enzyme
levels normalized. Shortly thereafter, the patient presented with
diarrhea at our emergency room, with a Norovirus and

Clostridium difficile co-infection, along with a Proteus spp.
urinary tract infection. In the course of a calculated antibiotic
and symptomatic treatment, the patient recovered completely.
6 of the 9 patients had anemia with a hemoglobin level lower
than 8.5 g/dL. 6 of the 9 patients were treated with
erythropoetin (EPO), and the same number of patients needed
blood transfusions. Only one patient, who was treated for more
than 4 weeks, received neither growth factors nor blood
transfusions. Two other patients, who did not receive EPO or
blood transfusions, discontinued at TW 2 and TW 4,
respectively. 5 of the 9 patients required RBV dose reductions
because of anemia during the first twelve weeks, although in
two patients the RBV dose could be raised again after
discontinuation of TVR (see Table 1 for details). 8 of the 9
patients had leukocyte levels lower than 2,500/µL and 4 of the
9 patients had leukocyte counts less than 1,500/µL during
therapy. Two of the 9 patients needed granulocyte colonystimulating factor (GC-SF) at least once. Five of the 9 patients
had platelet counts less than 50,000/µL with no apparent
clinical side effects. Six patients developed increases in serum
creatinine levels exceeding 1.5 mg/dL.
Discussion
In this retrospective single center study we have analyzed
the antiviral efficacy and safety of a TVR-based triple therapy in
a small cohort of post-LT patients with HCV genotype 1
recurrence. In our cohort, of mostly pre-treated patients, we
were able to demonstrate a substantial rate of sustained viral
response at 24 weeks (SVR 24) after EOT (5 out of 9 patients).
Obviously, our cohort is small in number therefore
comparison with larger, prospective trials is of limited
significance. However, our results suggest that it is possible to
achieve higher SVR rates than those previously obtained with a
dual therapy consisting of PEG-IFN/RBV in a post-LT setting:
in a meta-analysis including all genotypes pooled SVR rates
have to date only reached 30% (range 8 - 50%) [10,11].
Interestingly, our data are in line with an interim analysis
provided by the multicentric CRUSH-C post-LT cohort
presented by Verna et al. at the recent meeting of the
European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2013
[12]: here, SVR 4 rates of 41% (7 out of 17 patients) were
achieved, which exceed data provided by the French post-LT
experience [13], showing SVR 12 rates of 20% (1 out of 5
patients) in the TVR subgroup. In the CRUSH-C study all
patients who achieved SVR 4 had been HCV RNA-negative at
TW 4 [12].
In our study, most of the patients with SVR 24 were HCV
RNA-negative at TW 4, thus emphasizing the exceptional
significance of a rapid viral response for treatment success
also in the post-LT setting. Importantly, in our cohort, 2 out of 5
patients with previous non-response to PEG-IFN/ RBV post-LT
also achieved a SVR 24.
The major side effect of TVR-triple therapy is hematological
toxicity with two thirds of patients suffering from severe anemia,
thus requiring blood transfusions and administration of EPO.
Both Verna et al. (49% transfusion, 87% growth factors; [12]),
and Coilly et al. (85% anemia, 96% growth factors; [13]) found
similar rates of anemia and a need for the application of growth
factors in their cohorts. Accordingly, in an interim analysis of
patients undergoing TVR or boceprevir triple therapy post-LT,
77% of patients in the TVR group received EPO [14]. In the
French post-LT cohort, discontinuation due to side effects
occurred in 23% [13], which corresponded to the range
observed in our cohort (22%). During treatment, especially in
the early post-TVR period, no acute rejections occurred. This
finding could be confirmed in the CRUSH-C group, with a low
frequency of acute rejections during therapy (2 out of 101;
[12]). Of note, no patients died in our small cohort, while in the
larger multicentric cohorts treatment-associated mortality rates
were reported to be in the range of 2-4% [12-14].
In our retrospective analysis, similar to the preliminary results
of the CRUSH-C study and the French post-LT experience, the
antiviral potency of DAA has been positively shown. To some
extent achieving SVR was possible in former non response
patients, who otherwise lacked alternate treatment options.
However, this surplus in antiviral efficacy is associated with
increased rates of side effects which may lead, albeit rarely, to
a deleterious outcome [12-14] thus jeopardizing treatment
success.
The first-generation PI TVR and boceprevir are just the
vanguard of other forthcoming DAA, including secondgeneration PI like simeprevir, polymerase inhibitors like
sofosbuvir, and NS5A inhibitors like daclatasvir, which will be
approved by the authorities in the near future. Moreover, IFNfree treatment regimens will soon be possible by combining
these new drug classes. Next-generation DAA show a superior
antiviral efficacy and exhibit a far less harmful spectrum of side
effects in non-LT patients [15]. Furthermore, sofosbuvir and
daclatasvir have been successfully used in a LT patient and not
shown significant interference with immunosuppression [16].
Most likely, the treatment of post-LT patients in the future will
be dominated by the next-generation DAA, presumably without
PEG-IFN, as they seem to be better tolerated and the side
effects more readily controlled.
In conclusion, respecting the limitations described above,
TVR-based triple therapy in post-LT patients is feasible and
reveals an acceptable efficacy with respect to SVR 24. In part,
severe side effects are frequent during treatment and require
therapeutic interventions. In addition, management of drugdrug interactions is challenging. Future treatment regimens are
likely to lead to less harmful antiviral treatments, however the
current first-generation DAA treatment should be indicated
cautiously, and be conducted by an experienced treatment
center.
