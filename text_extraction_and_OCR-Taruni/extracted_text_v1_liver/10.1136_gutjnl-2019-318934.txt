Abstract
Objective This trial compared the efficacy and safety 
of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE ) plus sorafenib 
with TACE alone using a newly established TACE -specific 
endpoint and pre-treatment of sorafenib before initial 
TACE .
Design Patients with unresectable hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) were randomised to TACE plus 
sorafenib (n=80) or TACE alone (n=76). Patients in the 
combination group received sorafenib 400mg once daily 
for 2–3 weeks before TACE , followed by 800mg once 
daily during on-demand conventional TACE sessions until 
time to untreatable (unTACE able) progression (TTUP), 
defined as untreatable tumour progression, transient 
deterioration to Child-Pugh C or appearance of vascular 
invasion/extrahepatic spread. Co-primary endpoints 
were progression-free survival (PFS), which is not a 
conventional one but defined as TTUP, or time to any 
cause of death plus overall survival (OS). Multiplicity was 
adjusted by gatekeeping hierarchical testing.
Results Median PFS was significantly longer in the 
TACE plus sorafenib than in the TACE alone group (25.2 
vs 13.5 months; p=0.006). OS was not analysed because 
only 73.6% of OS events were reached. Median TTUP 
(26.7 vs 20.6 months; p=0.02) was also significantly 
longer in the TACE plus sorafenib group. OS at 1 year 
and 2 years in TACE plus sorafenib group and TACE alone 
group were 96.2% and 82.7% and 77.2% and 64.6%, 
respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities.
Conclusion TACE plus sorafenib significantly improved 
PFS over TACE alone in patients with unresectable HCC.
Adverse events were consistent with those of previous 
TACE combination trials.
Trial registration number NCT01217034.
Introduction
Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has 
shown survival benefits in patients with intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).1
Most clinical practice guidelines, including those 
of the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC),2
 the 
European Association for the Study of the Liver,3
the American Association for the Study of Liver 
Diseases (AASLD),4 5 the Asian Pacific Association 
Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
► Three trials conducted previously (Korea-Japan 
post-TACE trial, SPACE trial and TACE-2 trial) 
comparing PFS or TTP in TACE plus sorafenib 
with that in TACE alone could not show any 
clinical benefit by the addition of sorafenib to 
TACE.
► It was demonstrated in the exploratory analysis 
of Korea-Japan post-TACE trial that longer 
treatment duration (31weeks) of sorafenib in 
Korean patients is associated with significantly 
favourable TTP (HR=0.38, 95%CI, 0.18 to 
0.81) as compared with TTP (HR=0.94, 95%CI,
0.75 to 1.19) in Japanese patients with shorter 
sorafenib treatment duration (16weeks).
Similarly, in SPACE trial, it was also shown 
that longer treatment duration with sorafenib 
in Asian patients (33.6weeks) is associated 
with more favourable HR of TTP (HR=0.72, 
95%CI, 0.457 to 1.135, p=0.078) than HR 
of TTP (HR=0.865, 95%CI, 0.576 to 1.300, 
p=0.243) in Non-Asian patients with shorter 
treatment duration (26.0weeks). The design of 
these previous trials was based on RECIST1.1 
or modified RECIST as a definition of the 
progression. Therefore, when tumour status 
becomes progression per RECIST1.1/mRECIST 
such as appearance of intrahepatic new lesions, 
protocol treatment had to be terminated at 
the time of progression, leading to a short 
treatment duration of sorafenib.

Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
► However, even when intrahepatic new lesion appears, repeated transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is still effective in intermediate 
stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the routine clinical practice. In other words, progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1/modified RECIST (mRECIST) does not always mean TACE treatment failure or does not suggest switching 
to next line of treatment in case of intermediate stage HCC different from advanced stage HCC, for which only systemic therapy is 
performed. Since intrahepatic metastasis/multicentric occurrence is a natural tumour biology in HCC, different endpoint to prolong 
the treatment duration may be necessary to demonstrate the clinical benefit of the addition of sorafenib. Authors felt that RECIST or 
mRECIST are not adequate for progression registration in the TACE realm and that we used a different progression endpoint, which 
was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver (RECICL).
► In addition, pre-treatment with molecular targeted agent before TACE had been proven in preclinical studies to normalise tumour 
vessels and suppress hypoxia (caused by TACE) inducible factor-1α, upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived 
growth factor, or angiopoietin 2, which further enhance the HCC progression. Previous trials failed to show progression-free survival 
(PFS)/time to progression benefit due to the lack of pre-treatment of sorafenib as well as short treatment duration of sorafenib based 
on inadequate trial design for adjusting the TACE combination trial.
What are the new findings?
► In this trial, RECIST1.1 or mRECIST was not used as a response evaluation criterion, but RECICL was used. PFS based on untreatable 
(unTACEble) progression plus death was defined as a trial endpoint based on a line of routine clinical practice in intermediate stage 
HCC. In this trial, intrahepatic new lesion was not regarded as a ‘progression’ and trial was continued until newly defined progression, 
resulting in very long treatment duration with sorafenib (38.7 weeks) as compared with previous trials (17–21 weeks).
► Pre-treatment with sorafenib 2–3weeks before initial TACE procedure was introduced in this trial, resulting in significantly longer 
interval between each TACE procedure in TACE plus sorafenib group than that in TACE alone group. In Sorfenib or Placebo in 
combination with TACE for intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (SPACE) trial, pre-treatment with sorafenib before TACE was 
already introduced, but treatment duration before TACE was only 3–7 days, which is a bit different trial design as compared with 
current trial design.
► This trial met its primary endpoint: PFS in TACE plus sorafenib group showed significantly longer (25.2months) than that in TACE alone 
group (13.5months) (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.87). Furthermore, time to extrahepatic spread (EHS), time to vascular invasion and 
time to stage progression were significantly longer in TACE plus sorafenib group than those in TACE alone group.
► This is the first ever positive trial of TACE in combination with a molecular targeted agent, sorafenib, in patients with unresectable HCC 
without vascular invasion or EHS. Thus, the combination of TACE plus sorafenib can improve clinical outcomes and may be a choice of 
treatment in patients with unresectable HCC.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
► This trial clearly showed that TACE in combination with sorafenib should not be terminated at the point of intrahepatic tumour 
progression, when TACE is still deemed effective. The results in this trial also suggest that pre-treatment of sorafenib before TACE 
and continued use of sorafenib after TACE will prolong the PFS and prolong the interval between each TACE session, providing the 
prevention of liver function deterioration often caused by TACE repetition. Improvement of PFS and preservation of liver function will 
eventually lead to the prolongation of overall survival. However, further large-scaled validation randomised controlled trial is warranted 
to establish the real benefits of the combination use of targeted agents with TACE.
for the Study of the Liver6 and the Japan Society of Hepatology 
(JSH),7
 have recommended the use of TACE for these patients, 
with TACE becoming the standard of care. Because of the high 
tumour recurrence rate after TACE, this procedure is usually 
repeated many times. However, the repetition of TACE may lead 
to deterioration of liver function, resulting in poor patient prognosis.8
 Furthermore, TACE increases tumour hypoxia, leading 
to the upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α).9–11
Increased HIF-1α, in turn, upregulates the expression of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF) and increases tumour angiogenesis.9–11That is, 
administration of TACE to patients with unresectable HCC has 
been shown to lead to a spike in the intratumoural concentration of VEGF, suggesting that blockade of VEGF receptors may 
prevent the effects of a surge in proangiogenic factors.11 12 A 
preclinical model has shown that the combination of antiangiogenic therapy with TACE reduces tumour volume and vessel 
density, as well as prolonging survival, when compared with 
TACE alone.12
Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting, among 
others, VEGF receptor, RAF and PDGF receptor, thereby 
exerting both antiangiogenic and direct antitumour effects. 
This activity profile suggests that sorafenib may suppress the 
surge of proangiogenic factors after TACE. Sorafenib has been 
shown to significantly prolong overall survival (OS) in patients 
with advanced HCC, resulting in a significant advance in the 
treatment of this disease.13 14 Sorafenib has since been approved 
worldwide and has become the standard treatment for patients 
with advanced unresectable HCC. Because TACE and sorafenib 
have each been shown to prolong survival in patients with unresectable HCC,13–17 their combination may improve clinical 
outcomes.18–21 To date, however, all five randomised controlled 
trials testing combinations of TACE with molecular targeted 
agents such as sorafenib, brivanib and orantinib have failed to 
show clinical benefits of these combinations.22–27
Trials assessing the combination of TACE plus sorafenib in 
patients with unresectable HCC have yielded inconsistent results. 
Several single-arm trials have shown that this combination is safe,

effective and feasible in patients with unresectable HCC.19–21 In 
contrast, three previous randomised controlled trials failed to 
show the benefits of this combination of TACE plus sorafenib.22–24
Subgroup analyses of two of these trials, however, the JapanKorea Post-TACE trial and the SPACE trial, suggested that longer 
duration of treatment with sorafenib in combination with TACE 
may improve clinical outcomes.22 23 Based on the three negative clinical trials, the parameter TACE-specific progression was 
defined as a study outcome in the current trial. The present study 
reports the results of the TACE Therapy In Combination with 
Sorafenib as compared with TACE alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (TACTICS) trial, comparing the safety and 
efficacy of the combination of TACE plus sorafenib with TACE 
alone in patients with unresectable HCC who were not candidates for resection or ablation.
Pati ents and methods
Patients
This randomised, open label, multicentre trial was conducted 
at 33 institutions in Japan and included patients who had 
been diagnosed with unresectable HCC by biopsy, cytology or 
diagnostic imaging, such as dynamic CT or MRI, according 
to the criteria of the AASLD. Patients were included if they 
were aged≥20 years, had a life expectancy≥12weeks and had 
tumours confined to the liver without vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread (EHS) and treatable by TACE. Maximum tumour 
diameter was 10cm, and maximum number of nodules was 10. 
The maximum number of TACE procedures allowed before 
enrolment was 2, with at least 6months since prior TACE. All 
of those patients who had a history of prior TACE achieved 
complete response by previous TACE, but recurred more than 
6months later at the study entry. All patients had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 
0 or 1, Child-Pugh scores≤7 points and adequate organ function. Prior resection or ablation was allowed; however, any prior 
systemic therapy was not allowed.
Patients were excluded if they had another previous or current 
malignant tumour, except for early-stage cancer with low risk 
of recurrence or a malignant tumour curatively treated>3years 
prior to enrolment with no recurrence. Patients were also 
excluded if they had cardiac disease or a serious and active infection, except for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV). Patients with diffuse tumour lesions, extrahepatic metastases, vascular invasion, hepatic encephalopathy, uncontrolled 
ascites or pleural effusion were also excluded, as were patients 
previously treated for advanced HCC, including systemic 
chemotherapy, and those treated with CYP3A4-inducing agents. 
Patients with uncontrollable ascites or decompensated liver function were also excluded.
All patients provided written informed consent prior to 
enrolment.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomised 1:1 to treatment with TACE plus 
sorafenib or TACE alone. Randomisation was performed 
centrally via an interactive Web response system involving 
a computer-generated sequence and Electric Data Capture 
System Software (Viedeoc, Uppsala, Sweden). Patients were 
stratified by study centre, by their meeting or not meeting 
Milan criteria (one nodule≤5 cm in diameter or ≤3 nodules 
≤3 cm in diameter) and by number of prior TACE sessions (0 
vs 1–2).
Treatment protocol
Patients randomised to TACE plus sorafenib were started on 
400mg/day sorafenib 2–3 weeks prior to first TACE to confirm 
tolerability to sorafenib, to normalise tumour neovasculature 
for efficient TACE response and to suppress the VEGF increase 
after the TACE procedure. Sorafenib was discontinued for 2days 
before and 2days after each TACE session.
TACE in both groups consisted of intra-arterial injection of 
lipiodol plus epirubicin or miriplatin,28followed by injection of 
an embolic agent (Gelpart) to interrupt blood flow. Selection of 
anticancer agent (epirubicin or miriplatin) was decided by the 
sites/investigators; however, the same agent must be used at the 
repeated TACE sessions. Therefore, sites were included in the 
one of the stratification factors to avoid any imbalance. When 
necessary in treating very large tumours, split TACE was allowed 
within 4–6weeks of the first TACE session. First image was 
taken 4weeks after split TACE was performed. Repeat TACE 
with the same anticancer agent was recommended when the twodimensional measurement of the viable lesion was >50%that of 
the baseline tumour. TACE was repeated for intrahepatic new 
lesions measuring >10mm, which show arterial enhancement 
with venous washout. If venous washout is not associated with 
arterial enhancement even in lesions >10mm, TACE was waited 
until the time venous washout is confirmed.
Patients in the TACE plus sorafenib group resumed taking 
400mg/day sorafenib 3days after TACE. If this dose was tolerated, dose increases were allowed to 800mg/day in a stepwise 
manner at the discretion of the investigator. At the same dose 
before re-TACE sorafenib was started after the on-demand 
TACE. The dose of sorafenib in patients who experienced 
adverse events (AEs) due to this agent was reduced to 400mg/
day or 400mg every other day, with patients requiring further 
dose reduction undergoing dose interruption or discontinued 
from sorafenib treatment.
Beginning 4weeks after TACE, tumours were assessed by 
dynamic CT or MRI every 8weeks, with tumour marker tests 
performed at the same times. Treatment was continued until 
untreatable (unTACEable) progression, progression to meet 
the TACE refractoriness criteria, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.
Study endpoints
The co-primary endpoint of this trial consisted of progressionfree survival (PFS)/OS, an endpoint determined using a gatekeeping strategy for multiplicity adjustments, such that OS was 
calculated only if PFS was statistically significant.29 PFS was 
defined as the time from randomisation to progression or death 
from any cause, and OS was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause.
Progression in this trial was determined as untreatable (UnTACEable) progression, defined as the inability of a patient to 
further receive or benefit from TACE for reasons that included 
intrahepatic tumour progression (25% increase vs baseline) 
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver 
(RECICL),30 transient deterioration of liver function to ChildPugh C right after TACE, macrovascular invasion (MVI) or 
EHS. When ascites is not controllable or liver function is decompensated, TACE was not performed in both arms since TACE 
is contraindicated in such cases. In this trial, new intrahepatic 
lesions were NOT regarded as ‘progressive disease’, as they are 
indicative of the natural tumour biology of HCC and do not 
imply treatment failure or moving to the next line of treatment.

(RECIST) 1.1 nor modified RECIST criteria were used in this 
trial. Rather, tumour response was evaluated using RECICL.30
Lipiodol retention area in the nodule after 1month following 
TACE was regarded as necrosis.31 Therefore, complete tumour 
response to TACE was defined as complete lipiodol retention 
within the nodule and partial tumour response was defined as 
50%–100%lipiodol retention within the nodule throughout the 
trial. Progression in this trial also included progression that met 
the JSH criteria for TACE failure/refractoriness,32 defined as two 
or more consecutive insufficient responses of the treated tumour 
(viable lesion>50%) or two or more consecutive unnumbered 
increases in liver tumour number, even after changing the 
chemotherapeutic agents and/or reanalysis of the feeding artery, 
as determined by CT/MRI 8weeks after adequate performance 
of selective TACE.
Secondary endpoints of this trial included time to untreatable 
(unTACEable) progression (TTUP), defined as the time from 
randomisation to Child-Pugh grade C, intrahepatic tumour 
progression (>25% increase vs baseline), with new lesions NOT 
defined as tumour progression, MVI or EHS (diameter>10mm); 
and time to progression (TTP), defined as the time from randomisation to unTACEable progression or progression to TACE 
failure/refractoriness. Other secondary endpoints included 
objective response rate (ORR) after the first session of TACE; 
serum concentrations of the tumour markers AFP, AFP-L3 and 
PIVKA-II; and safety.
Statistical methods
All statistical analyses were performed using the data obtained by 
the cut-off date of 2 November 2017, at which time point 118 
patients had experienced disease progression. Efficacy data were 
analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. To adjust for multiple 
comparisons, hierarchical statistical testing was performed in a 
pre-specified fixed-order, first for PFS and then for OS. OS was 
formally compared only when the difference in PFS was significant (p<0.15). The primary endpoints were compared using 
stratified log-rank tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to 
estimate survival curves, from which medians were calculated. 
HRs and CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards 
models. Safety analysis included all patients who received at least 
one dose of the assigned treatment, irrespective of eligibility or 
duration of treatment. All statistical analyses were performed 
using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), V.9.4.
We originally designed this trial such that a total of 125 TTUP 
events would give the trial an 80% power to detect an HR of 
0.71 with a one-sided alpha of 0.15. The required number of 
events was anticipated to be reached by monitoring 168 patients. 
In November 2015, with the investigators and statisticians still 
blinded to all patient data, the protocol was amended due to slow 
recruitment. The primary endpoint was amended to the co-primary endpoints, PFS and OS, because extension of the recruitment period made it possible to observe sufficient numbers of 
PFS and OS events, not only TTUP events that do not require 
long-term follow-up. As such, a total of 125 PFS and OS events 
were required to maintain an 80% power to detect a HR of 0.71 
with a one-sided alpha of 0.15.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 197 patients were screened from February 2011 to 
March 2016; of these, 156 met the inclusion criteria and were 
enrolled and randomised. In contrast, 41 patients did not meet 
the inclusion criteria, for reasons that included Child-Pugh score, 
prior TACE number and laboratory test results (figure 1). Of 
the 156 enrolled patients, 60 (38%) were categorised as BCLC 
stage A, with most having a single large (>5cm) unresectable 
tumour and regarded as good candidates for TACE. Similarly,

18 patients (12%) were categorised as BCLC stage C because 
they had performance status 1, but without EHS or vascular 
invasion. The remaining 78 patients (50%) were categorised as 
BCLC stage B.
In all, 80 patients were randomised to the TACE plus sorafenib 
group and 76 to the TACE alone group; of these, three and five 
patients, respectively, were withdrawn prior to protocol treatment. The three patients in the TACE plus sorafenib and two 
of the five patients in the TACE alone group did not receive 
protocol treatment (TACE) because of worsening liver function; 
the other three patients in the TACE alone group were withdrawn because they were found not to meet eligibility criteria 
after randomisation. The baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics were similar in the TACE plus sorafenib and 
TACE alone groups (table 1).
Doses of study drugs
At a median follow-up of 122.3weeks, the median duration 
of sorafenib treatment in the TACE plus sorafenib group was 
38.7weeks (range, 0.3–245.9weeks), and the mean±SD duration of sorafenib treatment was 57.1±53.3weeks. Only in 42 of 
80 patients in combination group, sorafenib dose was increased 
up to 800mg after initial TACE procedure; however, sorafenib 
dose was eventually reduced during the protocol treatment in all 
of these 42 patients and also other patients who do not increase 
the sorafenib dose up to 800mg due to AEs, patients’ requests or 
physician’s decision. The median actual daily dose of sorafenib 
was 355.2mg (range, 86.8–792.9mg), and the mean±SD actual 
daily dose of sorafenib was 353.6±172.0mg. The median 
interval between TACE sessions was 21.1weeks (range, 15.8–
39.0weeks) in the TACE plus sorafenib group and 16.9weeks 
(range, 10.1–32.1weeks) in the TACE alone group (p=0.018).
Efficacy outcomes
The first co-primary endpoint, median PFS, specifically defined 
for TACE-specific PFS based on unTACEable progression was 
significantly longer in the TACE plus sorafenib than in the TACE 
only group (25.2 vs 13.5 months; HR=0.59; 95%CI, 0.41 to 
0.87; p=0.006; figure 2A). In TACE naïve group, there was no 
statistical difference between median PFS based on unTACEable progression in the combination group and that in TACE 
alone group (HR=0.741; 95% CI, 0.45, 1.22; p=0.23) (online 
supplementary figure 1A). However, in prior TACE 1–2 group, 
median PFS based on unTACEable progression in the combination group was significantly longer than that in TACE alone 
group (HR=0.570; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.99; p=0.04) (online 
supplementary figure 1B). The second co-primary endpoint, 
median OS, was not analysed because only 92 of 125 (73.6%) of 
OS events were mature on the study cut-off date of 2 November 
2017. Independent review committee declared that OS was 
not mature at the PFS manuscript submission on 15 September 
2019; therefore, final analysis could not have been performed 
yet. However, survival rates in TACE plus sorafenib group and 
TACE alone group were 96.2% and 82.7% at 1year and 77.2% 
and 64.6% at 2years at the last data cut-off (2 November 2017), 
respectively, although statistical analysis was not allowed based 
on the protocol regulation.
Analysis of secondary efficacy outcomes showed that median 
TTUP (26.7 vs 20.6months; HR=0.57; 95%CI, 0.36 to 0.92; 
p=0.02; figure 2B) and median TTP (26.7 vs 16.4months; 
HR=0.54; 95%CI, 0.35 to 0.83; p=0.005; figure 2C) were 
also significantly longer in the TACE plus sorafenib than in 
the TACE alone group. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed 
that PFS based on unTACEable progression was longer in all 
subgroups treated with TACE plus sorafenib than with TACE 
alone (figure 3). In contrast, tumour responses, disease control 
rate (DCR) and ORR 4weeks after the first TACE session were 
similar in the two groups (table 2).
Pattern of unTACEable progression
The patterns and frequency of progression did not differ 
significantly in the TACE plus sorafenib and TACE alone 
groups (online supplementary table 1). However, in the 
analysis considering the timing of event occurrence, time 
to MVI (31.3 months vs 4.0 months; HR=0.26, 95% CI,
0.09 to 0.75, p=0.008) and time to EHS (15.7 months vs 
6.9 months; HR=0.21, 95% CI, 0.006 to 0.70, p=0.006) 
were significantly longer in the TACE plus sorafenib than 
in the TACE alone group (online supplementary figure 2). 
Time to stage progression, which was defined as appearance of MVI and/or EHS was also significantly longer in 
the TACE plus sorafenib (22.5 months) than in the TACE 
alone (6.3 months) group (HR=0.31, 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.63, 
p=0.001) (online supplementary figure 3). Discontinuation

Safety outcomes
Table 3 shows the treatment emergent AEs with frequency≥10%in
either group and their corresponding Grades 3 and 4 AEs within 
4weeks after first TACE. All grade AEs more frequent in the TACE 
plus sorafenib group than in the TACE alone group included handfoot skin reaction (HFSR) (53.2% vs 0%), hypertension (51.9% 
vs 39.4%), increased lipase (49.4% vs 25.4%), fatigue (24.7% vs 
9.9%), diarrhoea (14.3% vs 0%), erythemia multiforme (11.7% 
vs 0%), weight loss (11.7% vs 2.8%) and hoarseness (11.7% vs 
0%). Grade 3 AEs more frequent in the TACE plus sorafenib 
group than in the TACE alone group included thrombocytopaenia 
(13.0% vs 2.8%), HFSR (5.2% vs 0%), hypertension (10.4% vs 
4.2%), increased lipase (14.3% vs 2.8%), increased amylase (7.8% 
vs 1.4%), neutropaenia (5.2% vs 0%), fatigue (2.6% vs 0%), diarrhoea (2.6% vs 0%) and erythema multiforme (2.6% vs 0%). AEs 
more frequent in the TACE plus sorafenib group were likely due to 
the effects of sorafenib.
Discussion
The TACTICS trial was a randomised, open label, multicentre 
trial comparing the safety and efficacy of the combination of 
TACE plus sorafenib with TACE alone in patients with unresectable HCC who were not candidates for resection or ablation. This 
study, which assessed one of the co-primary endpoints, median 
PFS based on unTACEable progression, found that the combination of TACE plus sorafenib resulted in significantly longer 
PFS based on unTACEable progression than TACE alone (25.2 
vs 13.5months; HR=0.59; 95%CI, 0.41 to 0.87; p=0.006). 
Moreover, times to vascular invasion, EHS and stage progression were much longer in the TACE plus sorafenib than in the 
TACE alone group, indicating that the combination of TACE 
plus sorafenib markedly prevented the progression of intermediate to advanced stage HCC. In addition, the interval between 
pairs of TACE sessions was significantly longer in the TACE plus 
sorafenib than in the TACE alone group, suggesting that TACEassociated deterioration of liver function is lower in the TACE 
plus sorafenib than in the TACE alone group. ORR was relatively high in both the TACE plus sorafenib (71.3%) and TACE 
alone (61.8%) groups, probably because of the high response to 
TACE performed in a superselective manner. Because OS events 
are not yet mature in this trial, the second co-primary endpoint, 
median OS, could not be analysed.
The combination of TACE plus sorafenib was clinically feasible 
and safe. Many AEs were more frequent in the TACE plus sorafenib 
than in the TACE alone group, with these AEs likely to result from 
treatment with sorafenib. None of the AEs in either group was 
unexpected, and rates of Grades 3 and 4 AEs were relatively low.
These findings differ markedly from those of previous trials 
testing the combination of TACE plus sorafenib in patients with 
HCC. For example, the Japan-Korea post-TACE and SPACE trials 
reported median TTPs of 5.4 and 5.6 months, respectively, with 
the criteria for disease progression determined using RECICL 
2004 and mRECIST criteria, respectively.22 23 The TACE 2 trial

reported a median PFS of 8.5 months, with the criteria for disease 
progression determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria.24 RECIST and 
mRECIST criteria may not be good measures of capturing the 
‘progression’ of intermediate stage HCC, as regrowth of the original tumour or appearance of a new intrahepatic lesion is not indicative of treatment (TACE) failure and does not suggest the need to 
move to a next line of treatment.
In contrast, the TACTICS trial reported a median PFS of 
25.2months, with the criteria for progression being unTACEable progression/TACE failure. New intrahepatic lesions in the 
TACTICS trial were not regarded as progressive disease. The better 
outcomes observed in the TACTICS trial may be due to the much 
longer median duration of sorafenib treatment (38.7weeks), owing 
to the TACE-specific trial design. In contrast, the median durations 
of sorafenib treatment in the post-TACE, SPACE, and TACE 2 trials 
ranged from 17.0 to 21.0weeks.22–24 Another possible explanation 
would be sorafenib was given 2–3weeks before initial TACE was 
performed. This pre-treatment with sorafenib might have led to the 
normalisation of tumour vessel, resulting in enhancement of TACE 
efficacy by dense accumulation of lipiodol mixed with anticancer 
agent and gelatine sponges. In fact, interval between each TACE 
session was significantly prolonged in TACE plus sorafenib group 
than TACE alone group. The third explanation would be sorafenib 
might have stabilised disease progression after each TACE session, 
leading to a prolonged PFS.
This study, however, had several limitations, including the relatively small number of patients included. Moreover TACE-specific
PFS, PFS based on unTACEable progression, which was applied 
in this trial based on lessons learnt from previous negative trials, 
had rarely been used in previous trials, except that ‘unTACEable 
progression’ was used in the SPACE trial. Actually, this concept 
that progression after TACE may not mean treatment failure and 
that treatment could be maintained until untreatable progression 
was first proposed by Bruix et al33 and therefore tested in SPACE 
trial. Thus, we believe that this new TACE-specific endpoint should 
be tested and validated in future TACE combination trials as well.
In summary, this is the first ever positive trial of TACE in combination with a molecular targeted agent, sorafenib, in patients 
with unresectable HCC, providing important results in the 
practice. In contrast to the three negative trials, the present trial 
assessed the efficacy of TACE plus sorafenib using an endpoint 
more suitable for a TACE combination trial, with this endpoint 
being consistent with those used in clinical practice. Furthermore, 
pre-treatment with sorafenib 2–3weeks before initial TACE was 
introduced in this trial similar to, but longer period than SPACE 
trial. Pre-treatment with sorafenib before TACE will enhance the 
treatment effect of TACE through tumour vessel normalisation 
leading to homogeneous distribution of lipiodol mixed with anticancer drugs and gelatine sponge particle within the tumours. 
Furthermore, pre-treatment with sorafenib before initial TACE 
will suppress the HIF-1α induced VEGF or PDGFR, which is 
regarded as the factor responsible for further tumour progression. The results of the TACTICS trial indicate that new intrahepatic lesions may not be regarded as progressive disease or as a 
reason for halting treatment in TACE combination trials. Thus, 
we strongly believe that the definition of treatment success or 
failure by TACE should use a different criteria from RECIST or 
mRECIST.
In TACTICS trial, among unTACEable progression transient 
liver function deterioration to Child-Pugh C was observed only
in 4 of 99 patients, which means many patients were discontinued 
TACE after TACE refractoriness. This event was included in the 
category of intrahepatic tumour growth>25%or TACE refractoriness in online supplementary table 2. The reason why for this 
is that the study protocol clearly specified TACE should not be 
continued once tumour status become refractory to TACE.
In conclusion, this trial clearly showed that the combination of 
TACE plus sorafenib can improve clinical outcomes and may be 
a choice of treatment in patients with unresectable HCC without 
vascular invasion or EHS, who are good candidates for TACE.
