Therapeutic potential of alpha-1 antitrypsin in 
human disease
Review article
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), an alpha globulin glycoprotein, is a member of the 
serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. The clinical significance of AAT is 
highlighted by AAT deficiency. Genetic deficiency of AAT can present as several 
neutrophilic diseases associated with emphysema, liver cirrhosis, panniculitis, and 
systemic vasculitis. Recently, animal and human studies have shown that AAT can 
control inflammatory, immunological, and tissue-protective responses. In addition, 
AAT treatment can prevent overt hyperglycemia, increase insulin secretion, and 
reduce cytokine-mediated apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells in diabetes. These 
multifunctional roles of AAT draw attention to the glycoprotein’s therapeutic 
potential for many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases beyond AAT deficiency. 
As underlying mechanisms, recent studies have suggested the importance of serine 
protease inhibitory activity of AAT in obesity-associated insulin resistance, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis. In this review, we explore the 
multiple functions of AAT, in particular, the anti-inflammatory and serine protease 
inhibitory functions, and AAT’s therapeutic potential in a variety of human diseases 
through published literature.

Introduction
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a 52-kDa serine protease inhibitor, is synthesized in the liver 
by hepatocytes and circulates in the bloodstream; it is also synthesized, to a lesser extent, by 
macrophages/monocyte, pancreas, lung alveolar cells, enterocytes, the endothelium, and some 
cancer cells.1) Recently, many studies have reported that AAT plays important multifunctional 
roles as an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-infection, and tissue repair-related 
molecule2-4) that protects tissues from damage induced by enzymes released from cells.5)
Recent studies have further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of AAT administration 
not only as a replacement therapy for AAT deficiency, but also as a potential therapy for 
many other human diseases. In addition, a few studies have assessed the therapeutic utility 
of alternative AAT sources, including transgenic and recombinant sources, as well as their 
diagnostic value. 
Overview of AAT therapy
1. AAT deficiency
AAT deficiency is an autosomal codominant hereditary disorder that causes defective AAT 
production, which leads to decreased AAT activity in both the blood and lungs as well as the 
accumulation of excessive, non-functional AAT protein in liver cells.6,7) It is often subject

to delayed diagnosis because (1) Asymptomatic AAT level 
reductions, as low as 85% of normal circulation levels in healthy 
individuals, can be easily detected in random assessments8); (2) 
Biochemical analyses, such as western blotting and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays, can misinterpret the inactivated 
form of AAT as the functional form9); and (3) Relative 
functional deficiency can exist as shown through the failure of 
AAT under physiological conditions.10) AAT deficiency affects 
1/4,000–1/5,000 people and 1%–2% of all chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in the United States.11) The 
main clinical conditions associated with AAT deficiency include 
COPD and liver cirrhosis. Nevertheless, it has broad spectrum 
pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations leading to 
pulmonary emphysema or COPD in adults as well as various 
liver diseases, panniculitis, pancreatitis, glomerulonephritis, 
and vascular diseases in a minority of children and adults. 
It is occasionally associated with less common problems 
such as fibromyalgia, mood disorders, and intense creative 
energy.12-15) The development of COPD is related to a decrease 
in the function or levels of AAT in the serum, which renders 
neutrophil elastase (NE) free to break down elastin and causes 
decreased elastin levels. The detected normal range of AAT in 
the serum varies because of variability in commercial standards. 
Based on the onset of emphysema, an abnormal AAT value is 11 
µM or lower.16-18)
The only safe treatment available for emphysema due to 
AAT deficiency is intravenous AAT augmentation. However, 
the efficacy of this treatment remains controversial. Because 
the incidence is usually low and disease progression is slow, it is 
impractical to conduct appropriate studies to evaluate the rate 
of lung function decline and reservation.19-27)
2. Type 2 diabetes 
Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic, chronic inflammatory disease. 
Diabetic inflammation results in local and systemic insulin 
resistance, which causes increases in circulating glucose levels. 
To compensate for increased insulin resistance, the functional 
β-cell mass first swells to induce hyperinsulinemia. Then, local 
and systemic inflammatory reactions destroy the resident islet 
β-cell mass. Blocking the inflammatory pathway can restore the 
insulin response.10)
The mechanism of action of AAT in type 2 diabetes is unclear, 
but AAT is known to protect pancreatic β-cells from apoptosis 
by inhibiting caspase-3.28,29) Recent studies have shown that 
the proportion of individuals with low AAT levels (1.0 mg/mL 
or lower) was 50% higher among diabetic adult patients than 
the non-diabetic population.30) The administration of AAT 
to patients with type 2 diabetes may reduce the severity of the 
disease.
3. Type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes, known as juvenile diabetes or insulindependent diabetes, is a progressive condition caused by little 
or no insulin production by the pancreatic islet β-cells.31) It can 
be caused by numerous factors, including genetics, infection, 
or the destruction of the pancreatic islet β-cells by autoreactive 
T cells.32) The control of blood glucose levels and the reduction 
of diabetic complications are critically linked to the protection 
of pancreatic β-cells. Despite decades of advanced study, the 
ultimate treatment for this disease has not been determined. 
However, recent studies on AAT have indicated that controlling inflammation and immune responses aids pancreatic β-cell 
function through the down-modulation of interleukin (IL)-
1β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines.33) IL-1β is known 
to be harmful to insulin-producing cells. Although the levels 
of circulating AAT in type 1 diabetic patients may appear to be 
within normal ranges, AAT function is impaired as a result of 
extensive non-enzymatic glycation, suggesting that functional 
AAT levels may play a role in disease progression.34-36) In 
the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, which is the 
autoimmune animal model for type 1 diabetes, serum AAT 
levels are only half those found in the majority of wild type 
mice.37) NOD mice recover to normoglycemia 14 days after AAT 
treatment, and NOD mice that overexpress AAT have reduced 
insulitis and do not develop hyperglycemia.38) In addition, the 
administration of clinical-grade human AAT to mice with 
chemically induced diabetes promotes pancreatic islet allograft 
survival and cytoprotective effects.29) 
AAT therapy (80 mg/kg/dose) was reported to be beneficial 
to β-cell function in adult type 1 diabetic patients.39) Rachmiel et 
al.40) reported that AAT treatment was feasible, without serious 
adverse complications, and improved glycemic control and 
serum peak c-peptide levels in pediatric patients with recently 
diagnosed autoimmune diabetes during a 37-week study period. 
Currently, 2 phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled trials enrolling type 1 diabetic patients at the time of 
onset are underway,40) and research into the function of AAT in 
diabetes is ongoing (Table 1).
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
COPD, the third leading cause of death in the world, can have 
a variety of causes, with cigarette exposure the most common.41)
The typical progression of COPD results in alveolar destruction, 
coughing/chronic mucus production, chronic inflammation, 
and irreversible airflow limitation characterized by protease 
imbalance and progressive loss of lung function.42) COPD 
treatments include inhaled bronchodilators, steroids, and longterm oxygen therapy. However, there are no effective therapies 
to reverse COPD.
Although AAT concentrations are within the normal range 
in COPD patients, their protease/antiprotease balances have 
been broken.43) COPD airways present increased NE activity 
compared to that in healthy airways, resulting in exacerbation of 
mucus dehydration and reduction of mucociliary clearance.44)
AAT can minimize pulmonary damage through suppression

of NE activity. The theoretical, potential therapeutic effects of 
AAT therapy include the neutralization of serine proteinases 
from neutrophils, the reduction of leukotriene B4 released 
from macrophages and suppression of neutrophil chemotaxis.1)
One of the main disadvantages of the AAT therapy is that 
intravenous AAT arrives at the lung in a relatively inactive 
state. To overcome this obstacle, direct aerosol delivery to the 
airway has been introduced and short-term studies have shown 
improvements in protection of the lung epithelium and in 
lower respiratory anti-NE defenses.45) To date, the inhaled AAT 
therapy has shown biochemical efficacy and safety in human 
studies.46) In addition, the other recombinant AAT studies as 
stem cell therapy and gene therapy are underway.1) However, a 
long-term follow-up study is needed for this methodology.
5. Cystic fibrosis 
Cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by the mutation of CF transmembrane conductance regulator, progresses from childhood. 
CF patients have various pulmonary symptoms, such as the 
production of thick mucus, chronic airway infection, and 
inflammation, which lead to decreased pulmonary function and 
early death.47) In a CF lung, neutrophil counts are elevated over 
those in a healthy lung and secreted NE leads to the destruction 
of the defense mechanisms of the lung against infection and 
inflammation. Thus, in CF, the treatment focus is on decreasing 
neutrophil hyperactivation and counteracting the effects of NE 
on the lung. To inhibit NE in the lung during CF progression, 
early studies have focused on the augmentation of systemic 
AAT levels by intravenous injection.48) Recently, a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a study in CF patients 
has been further performed to evaluate the safety of 100 or 200 
mg of inhaled AAT once daily for 3 weeks in 30 adult subjects 
and reported that inhalation is safe and well tolerated.49) Further 
multiple studies have demonstrated that AAT administered by 
inhalation can control neutrophil function and NE levels in a 
dose-dependent fashion as well as inflammation in the lung.48)
However, many obstacles still remain in applying AAT in CF 
since mixed results have been observed depending on the 
devices used as well as lung condition and NE concentration of 
patients. 
6. Others 
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which remains a major 
problem in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, is 
ameliorated by the inhibition of IL-1 production/activity, 
inhibition of proteinase 3-related IL-32 activation, and 
increased release of IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-10 in 
animal models.1) In a human study, AAT was well-tolerated and 
demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of steroid-refractory 
severe acute GVHD.50) The injection of human AAT or the 
production of adenoviral plasmid-derived, circulating human 
AAT can delay rheumatoid arthritis development in a mouse 
model via the inhibition of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α along with 
the neutralization of serine proteinases and aggrecanase-1 
from neutrophils.51) Recently published preclinical and 
clinical reports have shown that AAT is related not only to 
infectious diseases, but also to inflammatory bowel disease, 
acute myocardial infarction, and connective tissue/rheumatoid 
diseases.10) In addition, recent animal studies using the colitisassociated colon cancer mouse model demonstrated that AAT

treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor incidence

in colitis-associated colon cancer (personal communication 
with Dr. Q. Cai).
Conclusions
The function of AAT was first illustrated by AAT deficiency 
and AAT has been used as a therapeutic agent for AAT 
deficiency. Recently, various functions of AAT have been 
confirmed in addition to its control of inflammation. This 
provides an opportunity to assess its potential therapeutic value 
for a variety of disease treatments in clinical and preclinical 
studies. There has also been active research into a more 
effective supply of AAT for diseases in which it is currently 
used as a therapeutic agent. In particular, recent and ongoing 
studies continue to investigate the association of AAT with 
and its potential for treating diabetes mellitus, especially type 
1. The beneficial effects of AAT on insulitis, glycemic control, 
and pancreatic islet allografts have been confirmed in animal 
studies. AAT is also currently being used in clinical trials for 
diabetes. Based on these valuable findings on AAT, it may prove 
to be an alternative to various disease treatments and should 
be evaluated in further prospective human studies focused on 
long-term safety and efficacy.
