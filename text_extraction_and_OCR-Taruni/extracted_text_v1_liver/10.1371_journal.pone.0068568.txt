Abstract
Background: Many chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients recur after off-therapy and have to accept prolonged consolidation
therapy with NUCs. We investigated the rate of HBV relapse after stopping NUCs therapy with different time period of
prolonged consolidation therapy in HBeAg positive CHB patients, and analyzed the associated-factor of recurrence.
Methods: We recruited 162 HBeAg-positive CHB patients who met the standard of stopping NUCs therapy recommended
by the 2005 APASL. Patients in group A, without the prolonged consolidation therapy, were as controls. Patients in group B
were divided into 3 subgroups (group B1, 7 (range 3–11) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; group B2, 17
(range 13–20) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy; group B3, 28 (range 25–34) months of the prolonged
consolidation therapy). Virologic relapse was defined as an increase in serum HBV DNA to .103
copies/ml after off-therapy.
Results: One hundred and thirty-six patients (group A, 40 patients; group B1, 54 patients; group B2, 23 patients; group B3,
19 patients) were eligible for this study. The cumulative rates of relapse in group B at 6 months and 48 months were 29.2%,
41.7% after off-therapy, respectively. The cumulative rates of relapse in group B were statistically lower than that in group A
at the same time periods. The cumulative rate of relapse in group B3 or group B2 was statistically lower than that in group
B1, respectively. On multivariate analysis by Cox’s proportional hazard model, age at off-therapy, baseline ALT and the
different time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy were associated with the relapse of HBV after off-therapy.
Conclusions: Consolidation therapy with NUCs after HBeAg seroconversion should be further prolonged. Age at off-therapy,
ALT at baseline and the time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy could provide information to direct anti-viral
therapy.

Introduction
There are approximately 350–400 million people chronically
infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the world [1]. Chronic
hepatitis B (CHB) may evolve to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
cancer (HCC). It is reported that HBV-related end stage liver
disease or HCC is responsible for beyond 0.5–1 million deaths
every year worldwide [2–4]. Hepatitis virus B (HBV), a
hepatotropic double stranded DNA virus, is not directly cytopathic
for hepatocyte, but the immune response to virus or viral antigens
is thought to be responsible for liver damage or virus clearance in
patients with acute and chronic HBV infection [5]. So it is very
important to directly aim at HBV with antiviral therapy.
Nowadays, 4 kinds of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs), Lamivudine (LAM), Adefovir Dipivoxil (ADV), Telbivudine (LDT),
Entecavir (ETV) are used to treat chronic HBV infection in
China. NUCs can effectively inhibit replication of HBV, but not
eradicate HBV in hepatocyte. Many CHB patients recur after
NUCs are discontinued. So CHB patients have to accept longterm therapy of NUCs. Long-term therapy brings many problems
to CHB patients, such as high expenses, HBV drug resistance, etc.
Different researches recommend different end points of therapy
with NUCs. According to guidelines recommended by the Asian
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68568

Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) [6–7], in
HBeAg positive CHB patients, therapy could be stopped when
HBeAg seroconversion with undetectable HBV DNA has been
documented on two separate occasions at least 6 months apart.
According to the 2009 AASLD guidelines [8], therapy may be
discontinued in patient who has confirmed anti-HBe seroconversion (detection on 2 occasions 1–3months apart) and has
completed at least 6 months of consolidation therapy after the
appearance of anti-HBe. However, the rate of relapse is still high
after off-therapy, even if CHB patient is treated with at least 6
months of consolidation therapy [9]. So the time period of the
consideration therapy and the associated factor of recurrence
should be evaluated again.
In the present study, we analyzed the relapse rate of HBV and
the associated-factor of recurrence after stopping NUCs therapy
with the different time period of the prolonged consolidation
therapy in HBeAg positive CHB patients. These patients met the
standard of stopping therapy recommended by the 2005 APASL
guideline [6] and were given the different time period of the
prolonged consolidation therapy.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Patient recruitment started in January 2001 and the last patient
follow-up was in March 2012. We recruited 162 HBeAg-positive
CHB patients who were referred to Department of Infectious
Diseases, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University,
Guangzhou, China. These patients met the standard of stopping
NUCs therapy recommended by the 2005 APASL. The standards
for diagnosis of CHB have been previously described in detail
[10]. The included standards were as follows: (1) HBsAg positive,
HBeAg positive, HBV DNA load of $105
copies/ml; (2) the
history of HBV infection $6 months; (3) the time of abnormal
ALT $6 months; (4) the good compliance of patients. The
excluded standards were as follows: (1) patients with antibodies
against HIV or other forms of chronic liver disease; (2) patients
with long term of drinking history; (3) patients complicated with
fatty liver, the criteria of diagnosis of fatty liver by trans-abdominal
ultrasonography: increased echogenicity, posterior attenuation
and loss of intra-hepatic architectural details; (4) patients whose
ALT were normal; (5) patients who were pregnant or in lactating;
(6) patients with signs of variceal bleeding, ascites, encephalopathy.
The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of The
Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou,
China. Informed written consent was obtained from each patient
in the study.
Study Design
All patients were treated with ADV, ETV, LAM or LDT,
respectively. The standard of stopping therapy recommended by
the 2005 APASL was as follows: anti-HBe seroconversion, HBV
DNA,103
copies/ml (detection on 2 occasions at least 6 months
apart). According to the different time period of the prolonged
consolidation therapy with NUCs, patients were divided into 2
groups: group A and group B. Group A included 40 patients
without the prolonged consolidation therapy. Group B was then
categorized into B1, B2 and B3, depending on the time period of
the prolonged consolidation therapy. Group B1 included 54
patients with 7 (range 3–11) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy. Group B2 included 23 patients with 17 (range 13–20)
months of the prolonged consolidation therapy. Group B3
included 19 patients with 28 (range 25–34) months of the
prolonged consolidation therapy. Sera of all patients were
collected at baseline, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30,
36, 42, 48 months after off-therapy, respectively. HBV DNA,
HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe, ALT were analyzed, respectively. The
standard of virological relapse was serum HBV DNA to
.103
copies/ml.
Laboratory Tests
Liver biochemistry was assayed by routine automated analysis
system (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). HBV serological
markers, including HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg and anti-HBe were
assayed by a chemiluminescent micro particle enzyme immunoassay (Abbott, Chicago, IL). The detection of serum HBV DNA
level was previously described in detail [11].
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as mean6SD or median. The KaplanMeier method was used to calculate the cumulative rate of relapse.
Log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative rate of relapse
among groups. The Cox’s proportional hazards regression model

was adopted to determine the predictive factor for relapse, among
various variables including age at off-therapy, gender, baseline
HBV DNA level, baseline ALT level, baseline AST level, baseline
TBIL level, baseline ALB level, time to virologic response, type of
NUCs, the duration of the prolonged consolidation therapy and
total treatment duration. Receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC curve) was used to calculate cut off value of the relevant
predictive factor for relapse. All statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS v16.00 statistical analysis software (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL). Differences were considered statistically significant at a value
of P,0.05.
Results
Patient Characteristics
One hundred and sixty-two HBeAg-positive CHB patients were
recruited in the present study. After excluding 16 patients lost in
follow-up period and 10 patients whose sera were not collected at
baseline, 136 patients were eligible for this analysis. Sixty patients
were treated with ADV, while 37 patients with ETV, 26 patients
with LAM, 13 patients with LDT. Baseline characteristics of the
136 patients in this study were shown in Table 1.
Cumulative Rate of Relapse
After off-therapy, the cumulative rates of relapse at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48 months were calculated, respectively. As
shown in Fig. 1A, 52.5% patients recurred at 6 months in group A
and only 29.2% patients at 6 months in group B. The cumulative
rates of relapse in group A and group B at 48 months increased to
82.5%, 41.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the difference in the
cumulative rate of relapse between group A and group B was
statistically significant (Fig. 1A).
Subsequently, we compared the cumulative rates of relapse
among group B1, group B2 and group B3. As shown in Fig. 1B–D,
the cumulative rates of relapse in group B3 or group B2 were
statistically lower than that in group B1, respectively. Although the
difference in the cumulative rate of relapse between group B3 and
B2 was not statistically significant, the cumulative rate of relapse in
group B3 was lower than that in group B2.
Relevant Factors for HBV Recurrence
Cox’s regression analysis revealed that HBV recurrence after
off-therapy was associated with age at off-therapy (RR = 1.04;
95% CI, 1.021,1.069; P = 0.000), baseline ALT level
(RR = 0.999; 95% CI, 0.997,1.000; P = 0.016) and the different
time period of the prolonged consolidation treatment (RR = 0.974;
95% CI, 0.951,0.998; P = 0.031). According to regression
coefficients, the younger the patient was, or the higher the
baseline ALT level was, or the longer the time period of the
prolonged consolidation therapy was, the lower the rate of relapse
was. The age was the most significant among the three relevant
factors because the Wald of age was the highest. The time period of
the prolonged consolidation therapy was the least significant

among the three relevant factors because the Wald of the different
time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy was the lowest
(Table 2).
Subsequently, ROC curves of the three relevant predictive
factors were drawn and cut off values of them were calculated,
respectively. Cut off value of age at off-therapy, ALT level at
baseline, and the time period of the prolonged consolidation
therapy, for predicting HBV recurrence, was 37 years old, 80 U/
L, 11 months, respectively.
Then we measured the differences in the cumulative rates of
relapse between age#37 and age.37, ALT.80 U/L and
ALT#80 U/L, the time period of the prolonged consolidation
therapy.11 months and that #11 months, respectively. The
cumulative rate of relapse in patient #37 years old at off-therapy
(45.3%) was statistically lower than that in patient .37 at offtherapy (62.5%) (Fig. 2A). The cumulative rate of relapse in
patient who had ALT .80 U/L at baseline (44.7%) was
statistically lower than that in patient who had ALT #80 U/L
at baseline (66.7%) (Fig. 2B). The cumulative rate of relapse in
patient with .11 months of the prolonged consolidation therapy
(26.0%) was significantly lower than that in patient with #11
months (58.7%) or that in patient without the prolonged
consolidation therapy (85.0%) (Fig. 2Ca–b). Furthermore, the
difference among them was statistically significant. However, the
difference in the cumulative rate of relapse was not statistically
significant between patient with 0–11 months of the prolonged
consolidation therapy and patient without the prolonged consolidation therapy (Fig. 2Cc). These results further demonstrated the
significance of cut off value.
Discussion
In the present study, we found that the relapse rate of HBV after
off-therapy gradually decreased with the increase of the time
period of the prolonged consolidation therapy in HBeAg positive
CHB patients. Age at off-therapy, baseline ALT level and the time
period of the prolonged consolidation therapy were associated
with recurrence of HBV after NUCs were discontinued. If patient
was #37 years old at off-therapy, or ALT at baseline was .80 U/
L, or the time period of the prolonged consolidation therapy was
.11 months, the cumulative rate of relapse would significantly
decrease after off-therapy.
For patients with HBV infection, it is best to eradicate HBV in
hepatocyte, but there is no drug to eradicate HBV in hepatocyte
worldwide. NUCs are widely used to treat CHB because they can
suppress the replication of HBV and decrease the load of HBV
DNA. However, patient with CHB often recurs because the load
of HBV DNA rapidly rises after off-therapy [12]. It is demonstrated that high viral load ($103 copies/ml) is related to the
progression of liver disease [13–14]. As a result, more attention is
paid to the duration and the stopping point of NUCs therapy.
APASL guidelines [6–7], AASLD guidelines [8] and EASL
guidelines [1] recommend different duration and the stopping
point of NUCs therapy for treating CHB with NUCs. In the
present study, even if HBeAg positive CHB patient met the
standard of stopping therapy recommended by the 2012 EASL
guidelines [1], the cumulative rate of relapse was still high (Fig. 1).
Cut-off value of the time period of the prolonged consolidation
therapy also revealed that the cumulative rate of relapse in patient
with .11 months of the prolonged consolidation therapy was
significantly lower than that in patient with #11 months of the
prolonged consolidation therapy (Fig. 2b). Taken together, we
believe that 12 months of the prolonged consolidation therapy
after HBeAg seroconversion were imperfect for HBeAg positive
CHB patients.
Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which functions as
the template for the transcription of viral gene, is required for the
maintenance of HBV infection [15]. Furthermore, it is difficult to
eradicate cccDNA in hepatocyte [16]. Recently, Werle et al [17]
demonstrates that long-term ADV therapy can significantly
decrease cccDNA level in hepatocyte. The mechanisms they
propose are as follows: the replication of HBV is suppressed by
NUCs. The decrease of HBV replication results in the reduction of
nucleotide chain. The reduction of nucleotide chain can not be
converted into enough cccDNA to supplement the consumption of
cccDNA. As a result, cccDNA level gradually lessens. In the
present study, we found that the cumulative rate of relapse in
patient with 28 (range 25–34) months of the prolonged consolidation therapy was the lowest in 136 patients. This might be
associated with the decrease of cccDNA level. However, there
were still 21.1% patients who recurred after 28 (range 25–34)
months of the prolonged consolidation therapy in the present
study. So we think that the consolidation therapy after HBeAg
seroconversion should be further prolonged. Unfortunately, longterm NUCs therapy can result in HBV-resistance. All problems
above are difficult to resolve.
The sustained durability in patient whose age was #37 was
higher in the present study. Chien et al [18] demonstrates that
patient #36 has a high sustained response. Song et al [19]
demonstrates that patient #40 is significantly associated with the
sustained response. Chu et al [20] reports that the incidence of
hepatitis relapse is increased in patient who develops HBeAg
seroconversion after age 40. Recently, it is reported that the
difference in durability based on age can be associated with
immune activity [21]. All these results demonstrated that it was
more likely for younger patient to maintain viral suppression and
high rate of durability after off-therapy. So we think that the
consolidation therapy should be further prolonged for older
patient to lessen the rate of relapse.
ALT level at baseline is an important predictive factor for the
efficacy of antiviral therapy. Yan et al [22] approves that longterm efficacy of LAM is improved if the baseline ALT is more than
220 U/L. In the present study, we found that ALT level at
baseline was associated with HBV recurrence after off-therapy and
the cumulative rate of relapse was decreased if the baseline ALT

was more than 80 U/L. Our results further demonstrated the role
of ALT level in antiviral therapy.
It is reported that genotype B is related with spontaneous
HBeAg seroconversion, and that genotype B patient has a
significantly higher rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion
than genotype C patient [23]. It is also reported that genotype C
patient is more HBeAg positive than genotype B patient [24].
Furthermore, genotype C is associated with more severe liver
disease than genotype B [25]. So genotype C patient was recruited
in the present study. Our results might be valuable for genotype C
patient. Subsequently, in order to verify whether our results could
also be meaningful for other genotype patients, we will investigate
the relapse rate and the associated-factor of recurrence after

stopping NUCs therapy with the different time period of the
prolonged consolidation therapy in other genotype patients.
In sum, we have demonstrated that the APASL recommendations for stopping anti-viral therapy in HBeAg-positive CHB
patients are inadequate. We, therefore, believe that the consolidation therapy with NUCs after HBeAg seroconversion should be
further prolonged and the standard of stopping therapy should be
further evaluated.
Conclusion
Taken together, in the present study, we investigated the relapse
rate and the associated-factor of recurrence after stopping NUCs
therapy with the different time period of the prolonged
consolidation therapy in HBeAg positive CHB patients. We
revealed that the cumulative rate of relapse in patient with the
prolonged consolidation therapy was statistically lower than that in
patient without the prolonged consolidation therapy. Age at offtherapy, baseline ALT level and the different time period of the
prolonged consolidation therapy were associated with HBV
recurrence after off-therapy. Our results demonstrated that the
consolidation therapy with NUCs after HBeAg seroconversion
should be further prolonged, and that age at off-therapy, ALT at
baseline and the time period of the prolonged consolidation
therapy could provide information to direct anti-viral therapy.
