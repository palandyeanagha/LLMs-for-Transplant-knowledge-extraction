Abstract
Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic illness with elevation in
the creatine kinase level to a life-threatening condition associated with
extreme elevations in creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalances, acute
renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Muscular
trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less common
causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities,
infectious causes, drugs, toxins and endocrinopathies. Weakness,
myalgia and tea-colored urine are the main clinical manifestations. The
most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an elevated
plasma creatine kinase level. The management of patients with
rhabdomyolysis includes early vigorous hydration.
Introduction
Rhabdomyolysis means destruction or disintegration of
striated muscle [1]. This syndrome is characterized by muscle
breakdown and necrosis resulting in the leakage of the intracellular muscle constituents into the circulation and extracellular
fluid [2]. Rhabdomyolysis ranges from an asymptomatic
illness with elevation in the creatine kinase (CK) level to a lifethreatening condition associated with extreme elevations in
CK, electrolyte imbalances, acute renal failure (ARF) and
disseminated intravascular coagulation.
The cause of rhabdomyolysis is usually easily identified;
however, in some instances the etiology is elusive. Muscular
trauma is the most common cause of rhabdomyolysis. Less
common causes include muscle enzyme deficiencies,
electrolyte abnormalities, infectious causes, drugs, toxins and
endocrinopathies. Rhabdomyolysis is commonly associated
with myoglobinuria, and if this is sufficiently severe it can
result in ARF. Weakness, myalgia and tea-colored urine are
the main clinical manifestations.
The most sensitive laboratory finding of muscle injury is an
elevated CK level. In the absence of myocardial or brain
infarction, CK > 5000 U/l indicates serious muscle injury. The
management of patients with rhabdomyolysis includes
advanced life support (airway, breathing and circulation)
followed by measures to preserve renal function — the latter
includes vigorous hydration. The use of alkalizing agents and
osmotic diuretics, while commonly used, remains of unproven
benefit.
Historical aspects
Rhabdomyolysis has been described for millennia. In the
Bible a condition with characteristics similar to rhabdomyolysis is described when the Jews suffered a ‘plague’
during their exodus from Egypt, after abundant consumption
of quail [3]. This biblical catastrophe is assumed to have
been caused by intoxication with hemlock herbs that quails
consume during spring migration [4].
Musculoskeletal trauma, in particular crush syndrome,
accounts for a large proportion of the cases of
rhabdomyolysis. The first cases of crush syndrome were
reported in 1908 in the German military literature [5]. Crush
victims who developed ARF were reported during the
bombing of London during the Second World War.
Pigmented casts were found in the renal tubules at autopsy;
however, at that time the relationship between muscle injury
and renal failure was unclear [5]. Additional cases were
described during the Korean War [6]. The incidence of posttraumatic ARF decreased during the Vietnam War — this was
ascribed to the faster evacuation techniques and improved
fluid resuscitation of injured soldiers [7].

The role of myoglobin in the development of rhabdomyolysis
was first described in experimental studies in the early 1940s.
Bywaters and Stead injected rabbits with myoglobin and
reported this ‘toxin’ to be responsible for the ARF following
muscle injury [8]. In 1959, Korein and colleagues divided
rhabdomyolysis into exertional and nonexertional groups [9].
In 1972, Rowland and Penn described a series of inherited
enzyme deficiencies associated with myoglobinuria [10].
Increased recognition of nontraumatic, nonexertional causes
of rhabdomyolysis soon occurred [11].
Epidemiology
About 10–50% of patients with rhabdomyolysis develop ARF
[12]. Indeed, it has been suggested by some authors that
rhabdomyolysis from all causes leads to 5–25% of cases of
ARF [11]. A recent clinical series of patients developing ARF
reports mortality rates of 7–80% [13]. Rhabdomyolysis
occurs in up to 85% of patients with traumatic injuries.
Patients with severe injury who develop rhabdomyolysisinduced renal failure have a mortality of approximately 20%
[14]. Mortality is higher in patients with multiorgan
dysfunction syndrome [15].
Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndrome are common results of
natural disasters such as earthquakes. The Marmara region of
Turkey was devastated by one of the most catastrophic
earthquakes recorded, registering a magnitude of 7.4 on the
Richter Scale, on 17 August 1999 [16]. The Marmara region,
a densely populated and highly industrialized area, is located
in the northwestern part of Turkey with a population of
20 million. According to official reports, the disaster caused
17,480 deaths. Owing to the efforts of the Turkish Society of
Nephrology and the International Society of Nephrology,
detailed epidemiological data were collected [16]. Since
almost all of the hospitals situated in the disaster area were
partly or completely destroyed, victims were transferred by
boat, helicopter or road to 35 reference hospitals located in
adjacent cities. A total of 9843 patients were admitted to
these reference hospitals, of whom 5392 were hospitalized
and 425 died. Age was the only independent predictor of
outcome. The average time under the rubble was 11.7 hours,
which was not significantly different between survivors and
nonsurvivors. Six hundred and thirty-nine patients developed
renal failure (12% of all hospitalized patients), of whom 477
(74.6%) were treated by dialysis.
Causes and pathophysiology
There are multiple causes of rhabdomyolysis, which can be
classified as physical and nonphysical causes (see Table 1).
The major causes of rhabdomyolysis in patients admitted to
the emergency department of an urban population in the
United States were reported to be cocaine, exercise and
immobilization [17]. In the United States, rhabdomyolysis is
commonly diagnosed in intoxicated patients subjected to
prolonged muscle compression as they lay motionless, in
elderly patients following a fall or stroke and in patients with

seizure disorders [17]. Trauma and crush injuries following
motor vehicle accidents and the collapse of buildings are
other common causes of rhabdomyolysis [18,19]. During the
collapse of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001,
nephrologists in New York City were prepared to dialyze
large numbers of people with ARF in the days following the
terrorist attack. Few patients were hospitalized with crush
injuries, however, with only one reported case of rhabdomyolysis [20,21]. This case occurred in a 38-year-old
policeman who was trapped under debris for 24 hours, who
required hemodialysis for 1 month before fully recovering.
Traumatic rhabdomyolysis may also occur in people who
struggle against restraints and in children following abuse.
Rhabdomyolysis has rarely been reported when a surgical
procedure is performed in an improper position or following
the prolonged use of a tourniquet [22–25].
Myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria and a mild elevation of
creatine phosphokinase (CK) may occur after strenuous physical
exertion [26]. When physical exertion is extreme, however, it can
cause myolysis with severe rhabdomyolysis; this is especially
likely to occur when strenuous exercise is performed under
conditions of high temperature and humidity [27]. Hypokalemia
increases the risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous exercise.
This may be related to the fact that hypokalemia limits
vasodilatation in the muscle microvasculature [28]. Athletes who
abuse diuretics are therefore at a high risk of developing
rhabdomyolysis during strenuous exercise. The pathogenesis of
rhabdomyolysis following severe exertion appears to be due to a
combination of mechanical and thermal muscle injury and ATP
depletion. Excess muscle activity may also lead to
rhabdomyolysis in conditions such as status epilepticus
myoclonus and severe dystonia [29].
Rhabdomyolysis may complicate a high-voltage electrical
injury and lightning strikes [30]. Rhabdomyolysis has been
reported in 10% of subjects that survive an electrical shock.
The degree of rhabdomyolysis is not related to the size of the
wounds or to the site of entry [31]. The clinical course
following an electrical burn is similar to that following a crush
injury [32]. Myolysis following an electrical injury is attributed
to the electrical disruption of sarcolemmal membranes, with
loss of barrier function and massive calcium influx [33].
Hyperthemia may cause muscle damage. The syndromes of
malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome
are characterized by fever, generalized muscular contraction
and rigidity, metabolic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis [34].
Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal dominant genetic
disorder in 50% of cases and an autosomal recessive genetic
disorder in 20% of cases that affects males more frequently
than females [35]. It occurs abruptly with the administration
of anesthetic agents. The most common agents that cause
malignant hyperthermia are succinylcholine and halothane
[36]. The onset of malignant hyperthermia is usually within
1 hour of the administration of general anesthesia. Malignant
hyperthermia results in excessive sweating, causing
hypokalemia, which as previously stated potentiates the
muscle injury [37].
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an idiosyncratic reaction
to antipsychotic agents such as butyrophenones, phenothiazines and thioxanthenes, with haloperidol being the most
common offending agent [38]. In this syndrome, there is a
gradual development of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, fluctuating consciousness and autonomic instability
[39]. This clinical entity is believed to result from central
nervous system dopamine receptor blockade, or from
withdrawal of exogenous dopaminergic agonists [40].
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can also develop in patients
with Parkinson’s disease following withdrawal of levodopa
therapy [41–43].
Heat stroke is another cause of hyperthermia leading to
rhabdomyolysis. By definition, patients with heat stroke have
a core body temperature in excess of 40.5°C and their
course is often complicated by acute respiratory distress
syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal or
hepatic failure, rhabdomyolysis and seizures [44,45]. Heat
stroke has a reported mortality approaching 21% [46].
Hypothermia can also cause rhabdomyolysis [47]. By
reducing muscle perfusion, cold induces tissue ischemia and
freezing causes cellular destruction [48,49].
Inherited disorders of carbohydrate metabolism can cause
rhabdomyolysis [50]. McArdle’s disease (myophosphorylase
deficiency) is an autosomal recessive condition in which there
is selective necrosis of type 2 muscle fibers [51]. These fibers
are more dependent on glycolysis for generation of ATP and
are therefore more sensitive to an enzyme defect that prevents
the formation of glucose from glycogen. ATP depletion is
responsible for rhabdomyolysis in this disease. Other diseases
that affect the glycolytic/glycogenolytic pathways and cause
rhabdomyolysis include Tarui’s disease (congenital
phosphofruktokinase deficiency) and phosphoglycerate
mutase deficiency [52]. Other inherited metabolic disorders
that are associated with rhabdomyolysis include carnitine
palmitoyltransferase deficiency, an autosomal recessive
disorder that has been considered the most common
hereditary disease causing rhabdomyolysis [53]. In this
deficiency disease, muscle pain and rhabdomyolysis develop
after prolonged exercise with inadequate nutrient intake [54].
Medications and recreational drugs are important causes of
rhabdomyolysis (see Table 2). Drug-induced rhabdomyolysis
encompasses a large group of substances that can affect
muscles by different mechanisms. Any drug that directly or
indirectly impairs the production or use of ATP by skeletal
muscle, or increases energy requirements that exceed the
rate of ATP production, can cause rhabdomyolysis [55]. The
potential mechanism of drug-induced sarcolemmal injury is
presumably due to changes in the viscosity of sarcolemma

161
caused by activation of phospholipase A. These changes
result in increased permeability of the sarcolemma, permitting
leakage or intracellular contents, as well as an increase in the
entry of sodium ions into the cell [56–58]. The increased
intracellular sodium ion concentration activates Na+,K+-
ATPase, a process that requires energy. This exhausts the
supplies of ATP and impairs cellular transport proteins [59].
The increase in cellular sodium ion concentration leads to the
accumulation of intracellular calcium, which activates neutral
proteases causing further cellular injury [60].
The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase
inhibitors, or statins, has been shown to reduce major
cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary
prevention. Statins have consequently become one of the
most widely prescribed class of medications, with more than
76 million prescriptions filled in the United States in 2000
[61]. Statins are well tolerated by most patients. The most
serious side effects of these drugs are myositis with
rhabdomyolysis. This risk was emphasized by the withdrawal
of cerivastatin in August 2001 after the drug was associated
with approximately 100 rhabdomyolysis-related deaths [62].
Statins have been postulated to interfere with ATP
production by reducing levels of coenzyme Q, a component
of the electron transport chain [63]. Rhabdomyolysis may
developed acutely soon after initiating therapy (2–3 weeks) or
months or years later after a precipitating event such as an
intercurrent illness or infection, strenuous exercise or a drug
interaction. Clinically important rhabdomyolysis with statins is
rare, with an overall reported incidence of fatal rhabdomyolysis of 0.15 deaths per one million prescriptions [64].
The FDA MedWatch Reporting system lists 3339 cases of
statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported between 1 January
1990 and 31 March 2002 [61].
Statins are also associated with a chronic myositis syndrome,
characterized by muscle pain and weakness with or without
evidence of clinically detectable rhabdomyolysis [65]. Few
data are available on the frequency of the chronic myositis
syndrome, which may affect between 0.1% and 1% of
patients. Risk factors for the development of a statin-induced
myopathy include high dosages, increasing age, female sex,
renal and hepatic insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and
concomitant therapy with drugs such as fibrates, cyclosporine, macrolide antibiotics, warfarin and digoxin [61].
Individual statins may differ in their risk of inducing rhabdomyolysis, with some patients developing this syndrome when
switching from one statin to another. Other patients develop
rhabdomyolysis when exposed to any statin. It is probable
that genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of this
syndrome.
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in solid organ transplant
recipients [66]. The use of immunosuppressive drugs,
particularly cyclosporine, has been implicated in these
cases. Alcohol directly injures the sarcolemma and
increases sodium permeability [67]. Analysis of skeletal
muscle from chronic alcoholics and experimental animals
fed ethanol demonstrates a marked depletion of intracellular
potassium, phosphorus and magnesium, and demonstrates
elevated sodium, chloride, calcium and water content
[68,69]. Acute alcohol-induced rhabdomyolysis can occur
after binge drinking or a sustained period of alcohol abuse,
and is associated with pain and swelling of muscles,
particularly the quadriceps [70]. Drugs such as D-lysergic
acid diethylamide (known as LSD), sympathomimetics and
phencyclidine, which induce delirium or agitation, and those
that cause prolonged involuntary muscle contraction, lead
to increased ATP demand and to eventual exhaustion of its
energy stores [71].

Cocaine is a common cause of both traumatic and nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. Twenty-four percent of emergency
department patients presenting with cocaine-related
disorders have acute rhabdomyolysis [72]. Cocaine produces
rhabdomyolysis by several different mechanisms. Prolonged
vasoconstriction of intramuscular arteries can produce
muscle ischemia and acute rhabdomyolysis. In addition, large
doses of cocaine can have a direct toxic effect and can
produce acute skeletal myofibrillar degeneration. Cocaine
may also produce traumatic rhabdomyolysis by causing
generalized tonic–clonic seizures, or by coma and secondary
physical compression of a major muscle group for prolonged
periods of time [73].
A number of electrolyte abnormalities are associated with
rhabdomyolysis [74]. Examples include chronic hypokalemia,
hypophosphatemia and hyponatremia as well as rapid
correction of hyponatremia [11,75,76]. Overuse of diuretic or
cathartic drugs can lead to massive total body potassium
depletion, causing rhabdomyolysis [77]. Potassium depletioninduced rhabdomyolysis can occur in the presence of normal
or elevated serum potassium levels, which are maintained by
the ongoing release of potassium from dying myocytes [28,31].
Any condition that produces major electrolyte losses, such as
hyperemesis gravidarum, can be associated with rhabdomyolysis [78].
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are chronic autoimmune
conditions that in rare cases can progress to rhabdomyolysis
[79,80]. An interesting and challenging cause of rhabdomyolysis is the ingestion of large quantities of licorice. It is
well known that licorice contains a mineralocorticoid-type
agent that causes renal potassium wasting [81]. Hyperosmolar states such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar
nonketotic coma have been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis [82,83]. On rare occasions rhabdomyolysis has
been associated with thyroid storm and pheochromocytoma;
both conditions increase sympathetic stimulation and
metabolic demands, resulting in an extreme hypermetabolic
state [84].
Infections have also been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis
[85]. This includes bacterial pyomyositis, which presents with
localized signs of muscle infection with erythema, edema and
tenderness [86]. Legionella infection is classically associated
with rhabdomyolysis [87]. Rhabdomyolysis can be seen in
septic patients without direct muscle infection [88]. In these
instances, muscle damage can be caused by a toxin, or from
associated fever, rigors and dehydration [89]. Acute viral
infections with influenza A and influenza B, Coxsackievirus,
Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, parainfluenza,
adenovirus, echovirus, HIV and cytomegalovirus have been
associated also with rhabdomyolysis [90,91].
Muscle injury, regardless of mechanism, results in a cascade
of events that leads to leakage of extracellular calcium ions
into the intracellular space [57] (Fig. 1 and Table 3). The
excess of calcium causes a pathologic interaction of actin
and myosin, and activates cellular proteases with muscle
destruction and fiber necrosis [51]. The final common
effector pathway is thought to be an increase in free cytosolic
ionized calcium, which may start a cascade of effects leading
to major cell permeability and capillary leak [22]. Mechanisms
affecting membrane ion channels, activity of the membrane
sodium–potassium pump and the production of ATP link the
initial causes of rhabdomyolysis to the final effector pathway.
Such mechanisms are initiated by direct damage to the
membrane caused by toxins, severe exercise or compression,
or failure to provide adequate ATP following ischemia or a
defective oxidative metabolism. With muscle injury, large
quantities of potassium, phosphate, myoglobin, CK and urate
leak into the circulation. Myoglobin in the renal glomerular
filtrate can precipitate and cause renal tubular obstruction,
leading to renal damage [57].
Mechanisms of ARF in rhabdomyolysis
patients
It has been suggested that there are two crucial factors in the
development of myoglobinuric ARF; these include hypovolemia/
dehydration and aciduria. Three main mechanisms influence
heme protein toxicity: renal vasoconstriction with diminished
renal circulation, intraluminal cast formation and direct heme
protein-induced cytotoxicity. In the absence of hypovolemia
and aciduria, heme proteins have minimal nephrotoxic effects;
when these conditions are present, however, heme proteins
can induce renal dysfunction by a variety of mechanisms [67].

163
Released heme proteins produce a synergistic effect on renal
vasoconstriction initiated through hypovolemia and activation
of the cytokine cascade [92] (Fig. 2). This effect possibly
occurs through the scavenging of nitric oxide, which acts as a
vasodilatory mediation, or through the activation of endothelin
receptors consequent upon free-radical formation induced by
heme protein. The enhanced renal vasoconstriction and
resultant ischemia add, through depletion of tubular ATP, to
the potential for damage to the renal tubular cells, already
threatened by the heme-protein-induced free radicals [93].
Pigmented casts are a characteristic of rhabdomyolysisassociated ARF (see Fig. 3). These are a result of the interaction of Tamm–Horsfall protein with myoglobin, which is
enhanced at a low pH [53]. It has been suggested that ARF is
caused by a tubular obstruction causing increased intraluminal
pressure and thus opposing glomerular filtration [94].
Alternative mechanisms that have been suggested include
the precipitation of heme protein providing a ready supply of
material that can generate toxic free radicals [95]. The
propensity for cast formation is determined by the pH, the
filtered load of myoglobin and the flow through the renal
tubule [96]. Heme-produced free radicals induce oxidative
damage to the renal tubule [95]. Investigational work has
suggested that myoglobin is central to the oxidative injury
manifested as lipid peroxidation, and that this may be
inhibited by an alkaline pH [97].
Clinical manifestations
There is a wide variation in the clinical presentation of
rhabdomyolysis. The ‘classic’ triad of symptoms includes
muscle pain, weakness and dark urine [98]. The clinical
manifestations can be classified as musculo-skeletal signs,
general manifestations and complications. The muscle pain,

weakness, tenderness and contracture may involve specific
groups of muscles or may be generalized [99]. The most
frequently involved muscle groups are the calves and the
lower back. The muscles can be tender and swollen, and
there can be skin changes indicating pressure necrosis.
However, these classic features are seen in less than 10% of
the patients. Some patients experience severe excruciating
pain. The calf pain may erroneously result in a work-up for
deep venous thrombosis and the back pain can mimic renal
colic. Similarly, involvement of the chest musculature can
present with ‘anginal’ type chest pain. Over 50% of the
patients may not complain of muscle pain or weakness [17].
The initial clinical sign of rhabdomyolysis may be the
appearance of discolored urine. Urine can range from pinktinged, to cola-colored, to dark black [100].
The general manifestations of rhabdomyolysis include malaise,
fever, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting. The complications can
be classified as early or late complications. The early
complications include hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, elevated
liver enzymes, cardiac dysrrhythmias and cardiac arrest, while
the late complications include ARF and disseminated
intravascular coagulation.
Severe hyperkalemia occurs secondary to massive muscle
breakdown, causing cardiac dysrrhythmias and possibly
cardiac arrest. Hepatic dysfunction occurs in 25% of patients
with rhabdomyolysis. Proteases released from injured muscle
cause hepatic injury [101]. ARF and diffuse intravascular
coagulation are late complications, developing 12–72 hours
after the acute insult.
Laboratory findings
Although the patient history and physical examination can
provide clues, the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis is confirmed
by laboratory studies. CK levels are the most sensitive
indicator of myocyte injury in rhabdomyolysis [47]. Normal CK
enzyme levels are 45–260 U/l. CK rises in rhabdomyolysis
within 12 hours of the onset of muscle injury, peaks in
1–3 days, and declines 3–5 days after the cessation of
muscle injury. The peak CK level may be predictive of the
development of renal failure [12]. Abnormal CK levels are
commonly seen in injured intensive care unit patients, and a
level of 5000 U/l or greater is related to renal failure [102].
The half-life of CK is 1.5 days and so it remains elevated
longer than serum myoglobin levels [29]. Estimation of
myoglobin in serum and urine is useful, particularly in the early
phases of the disease [103]. Myoglobin is filtered by the
kidney and appears in the urine when the plasma
concentration exceeds 1.5 mg/dl [29,104]. It imparts a dark
red–brown color to urine when the urine concentration
exceeds 100 mg/dl. Myoglobin has a short half-life
(2–3 hours) and is rapidly cleared by renal excretion and
metabolism to bilirrubin [17]. Serum myoglobin levels may
return to normal within 6–8 hours.

Other muscle markers can also be used. For example,
carbonic anhydrase III is present in skeletal muscles but not in
myocardium, and an increase in its levels is more specific for
skeletal muscle injury than are CK levels [105]. Aldolase is
another glycolytic pathway enzyme that is found in high
concentration in skeletal muscle, the liver and the brain. While
increased aldolase levels are not as specific or as sensitive for
muscle disease as CK levels, increased aldolase together with
an increased CK level is highly suggestive of muscle injury
[106]. In addition to these enzymes, troponin I and troponin T
can be helpful in diagnosing early rhabdomyolysis [107].
Both ARF and the increased release of creatinine from skeletal
muscle increase the serum concentrations of urea nitrogen and
creatinine. However the creatinine is elevated to a greater
extent than the blood urea nitrogen, narrowing the normal 10:1
ratio of urea nitrogen to creatinine to a ratio of 6:1 or less
[108]. A classic pattern of changes in serum electrolytes occurs
in rhabdomyolysis. Serum levels of potassium and phosphate
increase as these components are released from the cells;
levels then decrease as they are excreted in urine [109]. Serum
concentrations of calcium are initially decreased as calcium
moves into the cells and then gradually increase. Electrolyte
levels in each patient depend on the severity of the rhabdomyolysis, the stage of the illness and the therapeutic interventions that have been initiated [18]. The classic laboratory
finding is an elevated serum CK of at least five times the normal
value, where the creatinine kinase isoenzyme found predominately in striated muscle (CK-MM) predominates [109]. Myoglobin becomes detectable in urine and produces pigmenturia.
Other findings include hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and hyperuricemia along with elevated levels of
other muscle enzymes like lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase,
aminotransferases and carbonic anhydrase III [29].
Clotting studies are useful for detecting rhabdomyolysis —
disseminated intravascular coagulation and toxicological
screening should be performed if drugs are the suspected
causal agent [110]. Urinalysis in patients with rhabdomyolysis
will reveal the presence of protein, brown casts and uric acid
crystals, and may reflect electrolyte wasting consistent with
renal failure [111]. A urine dipstick is a quick way to screen for
myoglobinuria, as the reagent on the dipstick that reacts with
hemoglobin also reacts with myoglobin [18]. These reactants
will detect hemoglobin at concentrations of 0.3 mg/l, and a
similar concentration would be predicted for myoglobin [112].
Myoglobin imparts its characteristic red–brown color to urine
at concentrations above 300 mg/l (see Table 3).
Management
The treatment of rhabdomyolysis includes initial stabilization
and resuscitation of the patient while concomitantly
attempting to preserve renal function [113]. Retrospective
analysis demonstrates that early aggressive fluid replacement
with saline is beneficial in minimizing the occurrence of renal
failure. The longer it takes for rehydration to be initiated, the
more likely it is that renal failure will develop [22,24]. Forced
diuresis, when started within 6 hours of admission, has been
reported to minimize the risk of ARF [53,114].
Mannitol and bicarbonate are commonly employed following
the initial resuscitation with saline [115–119]. Experimental
studies suggested that mannitol may be protective due to the
associated diuresis that minimizes intratubular heme pigment
deposition [53,67,116]. It has also been suggested that
mannitol acts as a free-radical scavenger, thereby minimizing
cell injury [22]. Furthermore, mannitol reduces blood viscosity
and is a renal vasodilator [120–125]. Furosemide and other
loop diuretics have also been advocated for use in patients
with myoglobinuric renal impairment in an attempt to initiate
diuresis and convert anuric to oliguric renal failure
[126–128].
Alkalinization of the urine has been suggested to minimize
renal damage after rhabdomyolysis [129]. After resuscitation
and restoration of normal renal perfusion, the kidneys clear a
large acid load resulting in an acidic urine. It has been
postulated that these patients may be unable to alkalinize
their urine without the administration of bicarbonate, and this
increases the risk of tubular cast development and renal injury
[130–132]. Knochel and Moore, and Knottenbelt, however,
have argued that large-volume infusion of crystalloid alone
creates a solute diuresis sufficient to alkalinize the urine
[133,134]. Furthermore, large doses of bicarbonate may
worsen the degree of hypocalcemia, especially if hypovolemia
is corrected [135].
While mannitol and bicarbonate are considered the standard
of care in preventing ARF in patients with rhabdomyolysis
[115–119], there is little clinical evidence to support the use
of these agents. While randomized controlled trials are
lacking, the available evidence suggests that mannitol and
bicarbonate have no benefit over and above aggressive fluid
resuscitation [120–123]. In a retrospective study of 24
patients Homsi and colleagues demonstrated that volume
expansion with saline alone prevented progression to renal
failure and that the addition of mannitol and bicarbonate had
no additional benefit [119]. Using their Trauma Registry and
intensive care unit database, Brown and colleagues reviewed
the case records of 1771 trauma patients with increased CK
levels [102]. Overall 217 patients (12%) developed renal
failure, with 97 requiring dialysis. In this study, peak CK
> 5000 U/l was associated with an increased risk of
developing renal failure. Of the 382 patients with CK
> 5000 U/l, 154 patients (40%) received mannitol and
bicarbonate whereas 228 patients did not. There was no
significant difference in the incidence of renal failure (22%
versus 18%), of dialysis (7% versus 6%) or of mortality (15%
versus 18%) between the two groups. Based on these data it
would appear that mannitol and bicarbonate have little
additional benefit over aggressive volume replacement with
saline alone.

The role of free-radical scavengers and antioxidants
The magnitude of muscle necrosis caused by ischemiareperfusion injury has been reduced in experimental
models by the administration of free-radical scavengers
[136]. Many of these agents have been used in the early
treatment of crush syndrome to minimize the amount of
nephrotoxic material released from the muscle [137].
Pentoxyphylline is a xanthine derivative used to improve
microvascular blood flow. In addition, pentoxyphylline acts
to decrease neutrophil adhesion and cytokine release
[138]. Vitamin E (alfa tocopherol), vitamin C (ascorbic
acid), lazaroids (21-aminosteroids) and minerals such as
zinc, manganese and selenium all have antioxidant activity
and may have a role in the treatment of the patient with
rhabdomyolysis [139,140].
Dialysis
Despite optimal treatment, some patients will develop ARF,
often with severe acidosis and hyperkalemia [141]. These
patients will require renal replacement therapy to correct
fluid, electrolyte and acid–base abnormalities. Daily
hemodialysis or continuous hemofiltration may be required
initially to remove urea and potassium that are released from
damaged muscles [142]. This allows gradual removal of
solutes and the slow correction of fluid overload.
Normalization of potassium is the priority, because hyperkalemic cardiac arrest is a life-threatening early complication
[143]. Peritoneal dialysis is inadequate to remove the large
solute loads in patients with rhabdomyolysis-induced ARF,
but it can offer temporary help [144]. The removal of
myoglobin by plasma exchange has not demonstrated any
benefit [145].
A unique management issue in rhabdomyolysis-induced
ARF is the development of hypercalcemia during the
recovery phase in 20–30% of patients [146,147]. To
minimize this complication, the administration of calcium
should be avoided during the renal failure phase, unless the
patient has symptomatic hypocalcemia or severe
hyperkalemia [148–150].
Conclusions
Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening condition that
must be suspected in all patients with a history of any
circumstance that can result in damage of skeletal muscle.
Important clinical signs and symptoms (i.e. muscle pain,
muscle tenderness and dark urine) and laboratory tests such
as an elevated serum CK level and a urinalysis that reveal
casts and is positive for hemoglobin, without red blood cells
on microscope examination, are common. Aggressive
hydration may prevent the complications of this illness.
Mannitol and bicarbonate, although commonly recommended, are of unproven benefit.
