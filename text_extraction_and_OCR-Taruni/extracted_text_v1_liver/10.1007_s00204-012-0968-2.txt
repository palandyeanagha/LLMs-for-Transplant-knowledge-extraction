Abstract Current 2-dimensional hepatic model systems
often fail to predict chemically induced hepatotoxicity due to
the loss of a hepatocyte-specific phenotype in culture. For
more predictive in vitro models, hepatocytes have to be
maintained in a 3-dimensional environment that allows for
polarization and cell–cell contacts. Preferably, the model
will reflect an in vivo-like multi-cell type environment
necessary for liver-like responses. Here, we report the
characterization of a multi-cell type microtissue model,
generated from primary human hepatocytes and liverderived non-parenchymal cells. Liver microtissues were
stable and functional for 5 weeks in culture enabling, for
example, long-term toxicity testing of acetaminophen and
diclofenac. In addition, Kupffer cells were responsive to
inflammatory stimuli such as LPS demonstrating the possibility to detect inflammation-mediated toxicity as exemplified by the drug trovafloxacin. Herewith, we present a novel
3D liver model for routine testing in 96-well format capable
of reducing the risk of unwanted toxic effects in the clinic.

Introduction
Current strategies to test drug-induced liver injury (DILI)
are predominantly based on in vivo animal models (Hartung
2009). However, significant species-specific variation
between rodents and humans as well as genetic variability
in humans impacts the extrapolation to the clinical situation
(Hartung 2009). A recent analysis demonstrated that 43 %
of toxic effects in humans were correctly predicted by tests
in rodents, whereas this increased to 63 % when non-rodent
animals were included (Olson et al. 2000). This low correlation highlights the fact that many adverse effects are not
detected by traditional in vivo toxicity tests. More organotypic human in vitro models are expected to support toxicity
assessment and decrease the risk of DILI in the clinic.
Unfortunately, maintaining liver-specific functionality
in vitro is a delicate business as hepatocytes have to retain
their polarized 3D structure to maintain liver-specific
functionality (Lecluyse et al. 2012; Berthiaume et al. 1996).
Growing a single layer of hepatocytes between two extracellular matrix layers is the current gold standard method to
maintain polarization. However, such hepatocyte cultures
are phenotypically and functionally not very stable over
time which impedes their use for long-term toxicity testing
(Berthiaume et al. 1996). Furthermore, hepatocyte sandwich cultures are difficult to scale down to a 96-well format
due to the instability of the overlaying gels and pronounced
edge effects. For these reasons, larger well plates are typically used which hampers toxicity testing at early time
points in the drug development process.
Primary mammalian cells retain their capacity to reform
a tissue without the use of any scaffold material. Gravityenforced cellular self-assembly in hanging drops is a wellestablished technology for tissue reformation enabling the
formation of size-controlled, multi-cell type microtissues
(Kelm and Fussenegger 2004). Assembling primary human
hepatocytes into 3D liver microtissues allows cells to
maintain extensive cellular contacts. Heterotypic cell–cell
contacts in co-cultures further enhance the hepatocellular
phenotype, maintaining hepatocytes in their differentiated

state (Lecluyse et al. 2012). In addition, the implementation of non-parenchymal cells provides hepatocytes with
diffusible growth factors and cytokines. For example,
Kupffer macrophages release both pro-proliferative (e.g.,
TNF-a, IL-6) and anti-proliferative (IL-1, TGF-b) cytokines and signals (Lecluyse et al. 2012). These cytokines
were shown to be involved in precipitating idiosyncratic
toxicity of certain drugs, such as trovafloxacin (Liguori
et al. 2010; Shaw et al. 2007, 2010). Treatment of mice or
rats with inflammatory stimuli such as LPS or TNF-a
together with trovafloxacin caused toxicity only in the
presence of the inflammatory stimulus. However, routine
assessment of inflammation-mediated toxicity in vitro has
so far been difficult due to lack of commercially available
primary human liver model systems incorporating inflammatory cells.
Results and discussion
Here, we introduce a human liver microtissue model in a
96-well format composed of cryopreserved primary human
hepatocytes in combination with non-parenchymal cells
(Kupffer and endothelial cells) and its use for long-term
testing and inflammation-mediated toxicity (3D InsightTM
Human Liver Microtissues). The accumulation of hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells in hanging drops resulted
in microtissue formation within 3 days (Fig. 1a). After
microtissue formation, the spheroids were either harvested
for histological analysis or transferred into a non-adhesive
spheroid-specific 96-well plate for long-term culture and
drug treatment (Fig. 1b–d). Immunohistochemical staining
for the epithelial marker cytokeratins 8 (CK8) reveals an
intact cellular phenotype, indicates direct cell–cell contacts

and the typical polygonal, bicuboidal shape of hepatocytes
(Fig. 2a). Kupffer cell populations were distributed
throughout the microtissue and were observed by CD68
staining similar to endothelial cells positive for CD31
(Fig. 2b, c). The macrophages exhibited typical morphology
with elongated shapes. Glycogen storage capability was
confirmed by periodic acid schiff staining (Fig. 2d, dark
violet stain). The presence of transporters was exemplified
by staining for the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)
and bile salt export pump (BSEP) (Fig. 2e, f). These transporters are ATP-dependent drug efflux pumps mediating
transport of endogenous and xenobiotic substances. The
transporters are clearly expressed in a polarized manner on
the apical surface of the primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2e, f).
Their staining pattern indicates presence of bile canaliculi,
into which hepatocytes secrete their metabolized toxic
products. Some of the bile canaliculi appear to be open to the
outer surface of the hepatosphere, as highlighted by MDR1
staining (Fig. 2e). Liver microtissues remained stable over
5 weeks in culture as shown by a constant ATP content
(Fig. 3a). This extended life span compared to 2D cultures of
hepatocytes is most likely due to extensive cell–cell contacts,
which are essential for maintaining the differentiated status
of hepatocytes. Besides the stable viability, functionality of
liver microtissues is preserved over 5 weeks, as indicated by
persistent albumin secretion (Fig. 3b).
The prolonged hepatocyte lifetime and functionality in
comparison with conventional 2D culture of hepatocytes
allows for long-term studies with repeated dosing to evaluate chronic hepatotoxic effects. Two hepatotoxic compounds acetaminophen and diclofenac were tested with
respect to their long-term toxicological profile. Acetaminophen is the major cause of DILI in humans, although
toxicity is dose-dependent and varies between patient
populations (Stine and Lewis 2011). At therapeutic doses, a
proportion of the drug undergoes bio-activation by
CYP2E1, CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. The reactive intermediate depletes intracellular glutathione pools leading to
hepatocyte cell death (Park et al. 2005). So far, 2D cultures
of hepatocytes have not been able to convincingly

recapitulate acetaminophen-induced toxicity in vitro
(Fey and Wrzesinski 2012). Treatment of liver microtissues
over 14 days with 3 re-dosing’s resulted in a concentrationdependent increasing cell death with an IC50 value of
754.2 lM (Fig. 4a). Diclofenac is a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug that has a strong association with hepatotoxicity. The mechanism is thought to involve phase I
enzyme activity (multiple P450-catalyzed oxidations),
phase II enzyme activity (glucoronylation) and mechanism-based inhibition (Park et al. 2005). In comparison
with 2D cultures of human hepatocytes (calculated IC50
value of 331 lM) (Bort et al. 1999), long-term treated liver
microtissues displayed an increased sensitivity toward this
drug with an IC50 value of 178.6 lM (Fig. 4b).
Most directly hepatotoxic compounds are detected during
pre-clinical investigations. However, indirectly hepatotoxic
compounds involving the immune system are not detected
during pre-clinical phases, such as trovafloxacin (Shaw et al.
2010). Recent animal experiments indicated that trovafloxacin is only hepatotoxic in combination with an inflammatory stimulus, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TNF-a
(Shaw et al. 2007, 2010; Liguori et al. 2010). The mechanism
is thought to involve enhanced cytokine secretion and
accumulation in the liver, causing caspase activation and
subsequent liver injury. Induction of the inflammatory
response in liver microtissues by LPS resulted in elevated
levels of IL-6 secretion, verifying the responsiveness of
incorporated macrophages in the liver microtissues
(Fig. 4c). The addition of LPS shifted the hepatotoxic
threshold of trovafloxacin about threefold from 220 (without
LPS) to 71 lM in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4d).
Developed to overcome the limitations of conventional
2D culture, multi-cell type 3D liver microtissues resemble
liver-like cell composition and an extended stability in
culture. The long-term viability and functionality of liver
microtissues allows for routine compound testing as well as
chronic and inflammation-mediated toxicity. The 96-well
format allows for microtissue mass production enabling the
implementation of an organotypic liver model at an early
time point in drug development.
