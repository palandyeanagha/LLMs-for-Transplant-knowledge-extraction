INTRODUCTION 
A common and devastating complication of liver cirrhosis is the 
development of ascites. Most generally, ascites can be defined as 
the pathological accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. The 
lymphatic vascular system plays a critical role in ascites formation.1
The lymphatic vascular system removes interstitial fluid from tissues in the body and returns it to the bloodstream. This interstitial 
fluid is called lymph when it enters lymphatic capillaries. Lymphatic fluid resembles blood plasma in its composition and contains 
white blood cells. Failure of normal lymphatic function results in a 
build-up of interstitial fluid and can lead to the clinical manifestations such as lymphedema and ascites.1-4 While structural analyses 
of the lymphatic vascular system have been conducted extensively 
in the liver, its regulatory mechanisms are largely unknown. This 
article summarizes the lymphatic vascular system and its role in 
liver diseases with special attention to ascites formation.
THE LYMPHATIC VASCULAR SYSTEM
The lymphatic vascular system is essential for tissue fluid homeostasis, immune surveillance and lipid uptake in the gastrointestinal organs.2-4 Disruption of normal lymphatic vascular structure and function plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of 
various disease conditions. In many forms of cancer, for example, 
metastatic spreading of tumor cells often occurs through the lymphatic vascular network. Furthermore, an impairment of its function causes lymphedema and ascites. Thus, understanding the 
regulatory mechanisms of the lymphatic vascular system is imporThe lymphatic vascular system in liver diseases: its role

The lymphatic system is part of the circulatory system and plays a key role in normal vascular function. Its failure plays a 
crucial role in the development and maintenance of various diseases including liver diseases. Lymphangiogenesis (the 
growth of lymphatic vessels) and changes in the properties of lymphatic vessels are associated with pathogenesis of 
tumor metastases, ascites formation, liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Despite its significant role in liver 
diseases and its importance as a potential therapeutic target for those diseases, the lymphatic vascular system of the 
liver is poorly understood. Therefore, how the lymphatic vascular system in general and lymphangiogenesis in particular 
are mechanistically related to the pathogenesis and maintenance of liver diseases are largely unknown. This article 
summarizes: 1) the lymphatic vascular system; 2) its role in liver tumors, liver fibrosis/cirrhosis and portal hypertension; 
and 3) its role in ascites formation. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2013;19:99-104)

tant for the development of therapeutic strategies in these pathological conditions. In this section, general knowledge of the lymphatic vascular system is presented.
The structure of the lymphatic vascular system
The lymphatic vascular system consists of closed-ended capillaries and larger collecting lymphatic vessels (also called collecting 
ducts) (Fig. 1). The lymphatic capillaries are composed of a single 
layer of lymphatic endothelial cells and absence of a continuous 
basement membrane. Smooth muscle cells and pericytes (i.e., the 
smooth muscle-like contractile cells that wrap around the outer 
surface of blood vessels) are absent in the terminal lymphatic capillaries but are present in the collecting lymphatic vessels.5
 Patency 
of the lymphatic capillaries is maintained by wispy connective tissue fibers that attach to surrounding connective tissue. Whether 
cirrhosis results in disruption of these connective tissue fibers, 
thereby disrupting patency of lymphatic vessels is unknown. 
Regulation of lymph flows
The lymphatic capillaries first gather into precollecting lymphatic 
vessels, which merge into larger collecting lymphatic vessels. The 
collecting lymphatic vessels are covered by smooth muscle cells, 
which provide contractile activity to assist the flow of lymph, and 
possess a continuous basement membrane. The lymph collected in 
the collecting lymphatic vessels is drained into the thoracic duct 
and is then returned to the blood circulation through the lymphatic-blood vessel connections at the junction of the jugular and subclavian veins.
When the surrounding interstitial pressure changes, these lymphatic vessels either expand and fill with lymph or contract and 
push lymph.6 The contractility derived by surrounding smooth 
muscle cells of the collecting lymphatic vessels has been proposed 
as one of the major driving forces of the lymphatic circulation.7 Nitric oxide (NO) produced in lymphatic endothelial cells is also 
thought to contribute to the regulation of lymphatic flows by 
modulating the contractility of smooth muscle cells.8 Ribera et al9
Figure 1. Lymphatic vascular systems in normal and pathological conditions. A filtrate (essentially plasma) escapes from blood vessels into the 
interstitial space of the surrounding tissues. The lymphatic vascular system removes this excess interstitial fluid and returns it to the bloodstream. 
The lymphatic vascular system consists of closed-ended capillaries and larger collecting lymphatic vessels. The lymphatic capillaries are 
composed of a single layer of lymphatic endothelial cells and absence of a continuous basement membrane, making it highly permeable to fluid 
and macromolecules. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are absent in the lymphatic capillaries but are present in the collecting lymphatic vessels. The 
collecting lymphatic vessels have intraluminal valves that prevent lymphatic backflow. Insufficient lymphatic drainage results in lymphedema 
and ascites.

reported increased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels in endothelial cells isolated from mesenteric lymphatic vessels of cirrhotic 
rats generated by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) inhalation. They also 
showed decreased smooth muscle cell coverage in mesenteric 
lymphatic vessels in those rats. This decrease in smooth muscle 
cell coverage was reversed by a treatment with a NOS inhibitor, 
suggesting that NO produced by lymphatic endothelial cells inhibits smooth muscle cell coverage of mesenteric lymphatic vessels in 
cirrhotic rats. Thus, similar to the case of blood vessels, NO decreases contractility as well as recruitment of smooth muscle cells 
in lymphatic vessels.
THE LYMPHATIC VASCULAR SYSTEM IN LIVER 
DISEASES
The liver produces a large amount of lymph, which is estimated 
to be 25 to 50% of the lymph flowing through the thoracic duct.10
Similar to those in other organs, lymphatic vessels in the liver 
function to retain fluid and regulate the immune system. The hepatic lymph derives primarily from the hepatic sinusoids, and to a 
lesser extent from the peribiliary plexus. Fluid filtered out of the sinusoids into the space of Disse flows through the channels traversing the limiting plate either independently of blood vessels or 
along blood vessels and enters the interstitial space of either portal tract or sublobular veins. Fluid in the space of Disse also flows 
through similar channels traversing the hepatocytes intervening 
between the space of Disse and the hepatic capsule and drains 
into the interstitial space of the capsule. Fluid and migrating cells 
in the interstitial space pass through prelymphatic vessels to finally 
enter lymphatic vessels. The hepatic lymphatic system is an integral part of the liver microcirculation. Studies have shown that significant structural changes of lymphatic vessels occur in liver diseases. This section discusses a potential role of the lymphatic 
vascular system in the formation of liver tumors, fibrosis/cirrhosis 
and portal hypertension, starting with identification of lymphatic 
vessels.
Identification of lymphatic vessels in the liver
Markers that distinguish lymphatic vessels from blood vessels 
are critical to understand lymphatic vessel formation and function 
in the liver.11 These markers include vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor-3 (VEGFR3)/FLT4, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE)-1, Prox-1 (a transcription factor), podoplanin, macrophage mannose receptor 1, Chemokine (C-C motif) 
ligand 2 (CCL21), Desmoplakin, Plakoglobin and integrin α9 (see 
review by Adams and Alitalo).12 However, these proteins are not 
exclusively found in lymphatic vessels and their expression patterns may differ depending on the disease type (e.g., fibrosis vs. 
tumor). For example, VEGFR3/FLT4, which is also a receptor for 
VEGF-C and D, was originally described as restricted to adult lymphatic endothelial cells, but later found in angiogenic blood vessels of retinas, wounds and tumors, and fenestrated capillaries of 
normal tissues.13 LYVE-1, a CD44 homologue, is frequently used as 
a marker of lymphatic vessels. However, Mouta et al11 demonstrated that LYVE-1 is not exclusive to lymphatic vessels. Indeed, LYVE1 is also present in normal liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and 
Kupffer cells in mice and humans.11 Surprisingly, LYVE-1 is absent 
from angiogenic blood vessels of human liver tumors and only 
weakly present in the microcirculation of regenerative hepatic 
nodules in cirrhosis, although both vessels are largely derived from 
liver sinusoids. A combination of lymphatic markers, such as Prox1 or podoplanin, with LYVE-1, may be necessary for accurate identification of lymphatic vessels.
Liver tumors and lymphangiogenesis
By double immunostaining LYVE-1 and Prox-1, Mouta et al 
showed in human HCC liver specimens that lymphatic vessels are 
more developed in fibrous areas that circumscribe tumors but absent within the core of tumors.11 It was also reported that LYVE-1 
and Prox1-positive lymphatic vessels are abundant in the immediate vicinity of HCC and liver metastasis.11 HCCs expressing VEGF-C 
are more liable to metastasis.14 Since VEGF-C is known to enhance 
new lymphatic vessel formation, i.e., lymphangiogenesis, these 
observations may indicate that metastasis is associated with increased VEGF-C expression and resulting increased lymphangiogenesis.15
Fibrosis and lymphangiogenesis
The number of lymphatic vessels increases in fibrotic/cirrhotic 
livers.11,16,17 Previous studies of experimental fibrosis have shown 
that VEGF levels are increased in regions of fibrosis but whether 
VEGF-C expression specifically is elevated remains unknown.18
Both the number and area of lymphatic vessels are positively 
correlated with the severity of fibrosis around the portal tracts of 
human liver specimens.16 Similarly, in cirrhotic rats generated by 
CCl4 inhalation, increased lymphatic vessels (podoplanin positive

vessels) were observed in portal areas.17 Interestingly, a significant 
increase in VEGF-D expression, another inducer of lymphangiogenesis, was observed in cirrhotic livers. In addition, VEGF-D expression was positively correlated with the progression of liver fibrosis. Collectively, these observations in both rats and humans 
suggest that lymphatic vessel enlargement and density coincides 
with the severity of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the increased lymphatic vessel formation in fibrosis/cirrhosis are largely unknown.
Portal hypertension and lymphangiogenesis
An increase in portal lymph flow occurs in liver fibrosis/cirrhosis.19,20 Barrowman and Granger21 showed a 30-fold increase in 
lymph flow from cirrhotic livers of rats and a positive correlation of 
hepatic lymph flow with increasing portal pressures. Most remarkably, they showed that in cirrhotic livers the functional capacity of 
lymphatic vessels to absorb interstitial fluid was compromised. 
Oikawa et al22 reported that the area of portal lymphatic vessels is 
increased in idiopathic portal hypertension. Collectively, it is speculated that the new lymphatic vessels are formed in cirrhosis, 
which could accommodate increased lymphatic flows. This compensatory lymphangiogenic response may help to reduce the high 
portal pressure observed in idiopathic portal hypertension as well 
as portal hypertension that develops with liver cirrhosis.
ASCITES FORMATION AND THE LYMPHATIC 
VASCULAR SYSTEM
Failure of the lymphatic vascular system is commonly manifested 
in the development of ascites. An impairment of lymphatic drainage and a build-up of interstitial fluid are direct causes of ascites 
formation. Although ascites is often related to chronic liver disease, the lymphatic vascular system in the liver can be overwhelmed in diseases where injury to the liver occurs secondarily to 
processes that originate elsewhere or primarily affect non-parenchymal cells.1-4 Therefore, this section is particularly dedicated to 
the formation of cirrhotic ascites and non-cirrhotic ascites in relation to the lymphatic vascular system.
Cirrhotic ascites
In cirrhotic patients, interstitial fluid is increased. The lymphatic 
vascular system reabsorbs excess fluid in the liver and splanchnic 
region and helps to prevent ascites formation. Consequently, 
lymph flows in the liver are increased, which stimulates hepatic 
lymphangiogenesis.20 Ascites is developed due to increased intravascular hydrostatic pressure, enlarged splanchnic arterial vasculature and decreased plasma oncotic pressure.23 These changes in 
pressure and structure of the vasculature facilitate excessive fluid 
filtration, which is exacerbated by the concomitant transformation 
of the hepatic microvasculature into a capillarized and defenestrated endothelium,24,25 which is often observed in liver cirrhosis. 
As liver cirrhosis progresses, the antidiuretic and antinatriuretic 
properties of compensatory neuroendocrine systems, which are 
activated secondary to arterial vasodilation, worsen the edematous condition and contributes to ascites formation.1
 However, the 
role of the lymphatic vascular system in the pathogenesis of ascites remains to be fully elucidated.
NON-MALIGNANT HEPATIC ASCITES
A common cause of ascites originating from a non-hepatic disease is cardiac ascites. Typically classified as a ‘post-sinusoidal’ 
cause of ascites, a myriad of cardiac diseases comprising right-sided heart failure can result in hepatic congestion. These include 
constrictive pericarditis, valvular heart disease (especially tricuspid 
regurgitation), cor pulmonale, cardiomyopathy, and others. Tricuspid valve dysfunction and regurgitation, in particular, results in severe hepatic congestion because right ventricular pressures are directly transmitted to the draining vessels of the liver.26 Elevated 
pressures directly affect the hepatic veins and small venules that 
drain the hepatic acini. This forces protein-rich fluid into the space 
of Disse due, in part, to the inability of hepatic lymphatics to compensate for the increase in interstitial fluid. This protein-rich fluid 
is in contrast to the protein-poor content fluid that develops in liver cirrhosis.
A clinical picture similar to that seen in the development of cardiac ascites is the hepatic venous outflow obstruction known 
eponymously as Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS).27 Causes of BCS include myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera and 
hypercoagulable states that stem from diseases such as systemic 
lupus erythematosis (SLE) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Hepatic venous outflow can also occur from disorders that 
predispose to thrombosis formation such as anti-thrombin III, Protein S and C deficiencies, Factor V Leiden mutations, drugs such 
as oral contraceptives, and others. In addition, the inciting injury 
in the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (previously known as veno-

occlusive disease) originates in the sinusoidal endothelial cells but 
eventually involves the hepatic veins resulting in a vascular outflow obstruction pattern.28 In these conditions, it is likely that elevated pressures within the space of Disse overwhelm the capacity 
of hepatic lymphatics to carry interstitial fluid back into the systemic circulation. Whether compensatory lymphangiogenesis occurs in these conditions and can be manipulated to increase the 
functional capacity to reasborb fluid, however, remains unknown.
Malignancy-related hepatic ascites
The presence of metastatic lesions to the liver can lead to ascites without the development of cirrhosis.29,30 Massive liver infiltration from metastases can lead to portal hypertension and ascites 
formation. Lymphomas can disrupt the normal lymphatics with resulting ascites that is often chylous in nature. In these conditions, 
the normal lymphatic flow is disrupted by either tumor infiltration 
directly in the lymph vessels or in the outflow vascular tracts 
thereby resulting in increased fluid within the space of Disse and 
the accompanying inability of existing lymphatics to absorb this 
fluid.
CONCLUSION
Lymphangiogenesis is associated with tumor metastasis and increases in liver fibrosis. It is, however, not known whether or how 
increased lymphangiogenesis contributes to the development of 
liver fibrosis. Since an increase in hepatic lymphatic vessels occurs 
in cirrhotic rats with portal hypertension, it is speculated that increased lymphatic vessels may be a compensatory response to alleviate elevated portal pressures by handling the increased lymphatic flow that derived from increased perfusion. These 
observations linking the lymphatic vascular system to liver diseases indicate its potential as a therapeutic target. How the lymphatic 
vascular system in general and lymphangiogenesis in particular 
are mechanistically related to the pathogenesis and maintenance 
of those liver diseases is largely unknown and warrants future investigation.
