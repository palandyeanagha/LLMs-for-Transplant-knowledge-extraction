Abstract As the cohort of survivors with the singleventricle type of congenital heart disease grows, it becomes
increasingly evident that the state of chronically elevated
venous pressure and decreased cardiac output inherent in the
Fontan circulation provides the substrate for a progressive
decline in functional status. One organ at great risk is the
liver. Wedged between two capillary beds, with the pulmonary venous bed downstream, which typically has no
pulsatile energy added in the absence of a functional right
ventricle, and the splanchnic bed upstream, which may have
compromised inflow due to inherent cardiac output restriction characteristic of the Fontan circulation, the liver exists
in a precarious state. This review summarizes a consensus
view achieved at a multidisciplinary symposium held at
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in June 2011. The
discussion includes current knowledge concerning the
hemodynamic foundations of liver problems, the diagnostic
tools available, the unique histopathology of the liver after
the Fontan operation, and proposed mechanisms for hepatic
fibrosis at the cellular level. At the completion of the symposium, a consensus recommendation was made by the
authors’ group to pursue a new prospective protocol for
clinical evaluation of the liver for all patients in our practice
10 years after the Fontan operation.

Advances in diagnostic capacities, surgical techniques, and
perioperative care, as well as overall better understanding
of the circulatory pathophysiology have contributed to
major improvements in outcome. Survival through surgery
and into the early years of life currently is expected for
most individuals born with this condition [53]. As the
number of survivors into adolescence and early adulthood
continues to increase, questions have arisen concerning the
capacity of the Fontan circulation to sustain a good quality
and a normal duration of life.
The Fontan operation directs the systemic venous return
into the pulmonary circulation, allowing for passive venous
flow into the lungs without ventricular propulsion. This
achieves the goal of reduced intracardiac mixing and
improves systemic oxygen saturation, although with a
number of physiologic limitations. After the Fontan operation, systemic venous pressure is obligatorily elevated.
Limited preload filling of the systemic ventricle due to a
missing pulmonary ventricle contributes to low stroke
volume and diminished cardiac output [24]. Venous congestion and decreased perfusion (i.e., diminished oxygen
delivery) are the hallmarks of this circulation.
As the cohort of survivors grows, it is increasingly
evident that the state of chronically elevated venous pressure and decreased cardiac output provides the substrate for
a progressive decline in functional status. Arrhythmia,
valvular insufficiency, and ventricular dysfunction are
common [4, 41]. Complications directly related to an
impaired cardiovascular system such as reduced exercise
capacity are noted [26]. In addition, there is growing evidence for a multitude of end-organ dysfunctions. Poor
somatic growth and development, delayed pubertal maturation, increased risk of thromboembolism, peripheral
venous insufficiency, protein-losing enteropathy, and
plastic bronchitis are being identified with increasing frequency after the Fontan operation [10, 12, 45, 54, 55, 63].
One organ at great risk is the liver. In June 2011, a
multidisciplinary symposium was held at The Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia to discuss the problem of the liver
after the Fontan operation. The participants in this symposium included experts from both the pediatric and adult
fields of congenital heart disease, cardiothoracic surgery,
heart failure, and gastroenterology/hepatology, The group
reviewed current knowledge concerning the hemodynamic
foundations for liver problems, the diagnostic tools available, the unique histopathology of the liver after the Fontan
operation, and proposed mechanisms for hepatic fibrosis at
the cellular level. At the completion of the symposium, a
consensus recommendation was made to pursue a new,
prospective protocol for clinical evaluation of the liver.
The following summary reviews our discussions concerning the precarious state of the liver after the Fontan
operation.
Impact of the Fontan State on Hepatic Circulatory
Physiology
The Fontan patient, because pulmonary blood flow is
passive, experiences an obligate elevation in systemic
venous pressure compared with normal individuals. Similarly, because ventricular filling is limited by the passive
flow of blood through the pulmonary circulation, the cardiac output in Fontan patients is diminished, and the ability
to increase cardiac output in response to metabolic
demands is substantially diminished [59]. These physiologic derangements become progressively more severe
with each passing year [42].
In individuals with normal heart anatomy and function,
hepatic blood flow accounts for approximately 25 % of the
cardiac output. Approximately one-fourth of this flow is
fully oxygenated arterial afferent supply via the hepatic
artery. The remainder is deoxygenated blood at venous
pressure (average, 6 mmHg) via the portal vein. Importantly, no capacity exists for autoregulation of portal
venous flow. It is dependent on the mesenteric circulation
and directly related to the gradient between portal and
hepatic venous pressures.
The hepatic artery, which exhibits classic arterial autoregulation, is responsible for all autoregulation of hepatic
blood flow. This autoregulation results in what has been
termed the ‘‘hepatic arterial buffer response’’ (HABR).
Decreased portal flow is buffered by increased hepatic
arterial flow. It is estimated that the hepatic artery is
capable of buffering a 30 % to 60 % decrease in portal
inflow [14].
Very little data exist on hepatic circulation in the
Fontan patient. However, certain likely implications can
be inferred from the known physiologic derangements.
Given the elevated venous pressure and limited cardiac
output in patients after Fontan, portal flow likely is
diminished and portal vein saturation decreased, resulting
in a dependency of the liver on HABR. This state likely
exists even in patients with what are considered relatively
favorable Fontan hemodynamics. As patients age and
hemodynamic changes become more pronounced, it is
very possible that the capability of HABR to compensate
for diminished portal vein flow is exceeded, contributing
to organ injury.
Scope of the Problem: The Southampton Experience
The liver is the chief metabolic engine of the body. It
effects xenobiotic and antimicrobial endotoxin clearance
from the gut; coordinates carbohydrate, protein, lipid,
vitamin, and hormone pathways; and importantly, plays a
potentially key role in vasomotor dysregulation of the

cardiovascular system when normal hepatic function is
deranged.
Potential discrete points of liver injury are commonplace
in the natural and surgical history of patients undergoing
single-ventricle palliative surgery. The initial clinical presentation may be marked by cardiovascular collapse, congestive heart failure, and marked hypoxemia in the infant
with a single ventricle, factors well recognized to induce
acute liver injury. Perioperative insults at the time of aortopulmonary shunts, Glenn shunts, or completion of the
Fontan circulation also are well documented as causing
ischemic liver insults. Chronic venous congestion characterizes the late Fontan circulation, and this combined with
low cardiac output, particularly during periods of cardiovascular stress, is likely to induce hypoxic stress and acute
chronic injury that may trigger inflammation, subsequent
fibrosis, and potential cirrhosis (Fig. 1).
The Southampton group and others have demonstrated
gross alterations in liver structure, and more recently, in
function, consistent with long-term hepatic insults [35].
Cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography (CT)
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for further characterization has demonstrated altered perfusion patterns that
are zonal and reticular. The liver margin frequently is
irregular, consistent with marked distortion of the liver’s
gross architecture (Fig. 2a–c). Furthermore, investigators
have observed positive markers of frank portal hypertension such as the presence of varices and splenomegaly.
Recently, the presence of arterialized nodules in the
Fontan liver were described [6]. These occur with relatively high frequency. They typically reside in the outer
margins of the liver and are seen in Fontan patients with
higher venous pressures. These findings are consistent with
changes seen in hepatic venous outlet obstruction such as
Budd-Chiari syndrome. It is believed that they represent
arterialization of the hepatic blood supply, an adverse
adaption associated with portal venous deprivation of the
liver parenchyma, perpetuating the underlying liver injury.
Although these nodules are benign and pathologically
identifiable as focal nodular hyperplasia, the initial characterization and follow-up treatment is challenging but
vitally important because the main differential is hepatocellular carcinoma, which currently is increasingly
reported.
Histologically, the adult Fontan liver phenotype is typified by massive and universal sinusoidal dilation [33]. This
is associated with a diffuse felt-work of sinusoidal fibrosis,
which is largely orcein negative, suggesting the potential

for reversibility. Also frequently encountered, however, are
broad fibrous spurs of orcein-positive scars, which in the
more severe cases bridge the vessels, consistent with cirrhosis. These broad scars correspond macroscopically to
the reticular pattern seen on CT. Quite disturbingly and of
great concern, hepatocellular carcinoma in Fontan patients
currently is documented clearly in the literature [25, 56].
The fundamental questions arising from these observations are how does such altered liver structure affect
hepatic function, and what is the relevance in relation to
clinical decision making? In this context, the Southampton
group used indocyanine green clearance to document
impaired liver function in Fontan patients, similar to a
comparative group of compensated viral cirrhotic patients
[28]. Both the disappearance and retention rates were significantly abnormal in Fontan patients. Contrary to what is
observed in viral hepatitis–associated cirrhosis, the degree
of dysfunction, however, was not proportional to the degree
of fibrosis in the Fontan patients. Much more information is
required to delineate this dysfunction further and its
implications for the future prognosis and perioperative
behavior of Fontan patients with demonstrated impaired
function. In Southampton, it was decided on the basis of
advanced liver disease not to operate on 3 of approximately
50 patients evaluated for Fontan revision surgery. One of
these patients went on to experience hepatic encephalopathy and had hemodynamics ultimately and fatally dictated
by decompensating cirrhosis. Velpula et al. [65] also documented acute variceal bleeding in the postoperative period
of another patient who had undergone Fontan revision
surgery.
It is safe to conclude that liver injury is universal in
adult Fontan patients, whose liver is incorporated into the
venous return to the lungs. The pattern of injury is very
similar to other forms of cardiac cirrhosis in both its gross
and histologic features. The important drivers appear to be
high venous pressures, diminished cardiac output, and
discrete insults pre- and perioperatively, as well as during
late follow-up evaluation under circumstances of acute
cardiovascular stress.
Noninvasive Assessment of Liver Function
and Fibrosis: Utility After the Fontan Operation
Noninvasive measures of hepatic function, structure, and
fibrosis have been developed for clinical use and tailored to
several different disease states. Testing can be focused on
assessment of ongoing liver injury (test results that reflect
liver damage or inflammatory states such as liver enzymes,
FibroTest findings, and others) including measurements of
true liver function (e.g., bilirubin, albumin, international
normalized ratio [INR], indocyanine green clearance) and
assessments of liver anatomy or fibrosis (e.g., routine
imaging, elastography, diffusion-weighted MRI, contrastenhanced ultrasound). Despite this plethora of available
options, tests that distinguish accurately between milder

gradations of liver disease in children are almost completely lacking [2], and this is especially true for the
assessment of liver disease in the setting of congestive
cardiac disease.
Evaluation of the degree of liver compromise in children
and adults with congenital heart disease is of particular
importance due to the significant impact of even mild liver
disease on outcome from cardiac surgery, with overall
mortality as high as 17 % [40] and an even higher mortality
rate among those with more advanced liver disease.
It is clear that assessment of hepatic disease before
cardiac surgery or transplantation is clinically important.
Children with Fontan physiology pose particular difficulties for the clinician due to the nature of Fontan-associated
liver disease (FALD) and the confounding features of
Fontan physiology or treatment. The FALD condition is
unique. Although variable, congestive hepatopathy appears
to develop slowly in most of these children, often without
obvious clinical features [3, 25]. Generally, elevation in
liver enzymes is minimal or absent due to the lack of
significant inflammation and cell death as fibrosis gradually
accumulates.
Hepatic function is well preserved in FALD as fibrosis
develops, as reflected by normal bilirubin. Serum albumin
is normal in most children and if depressed, it is more
commonly the result of protein-losing enteropathy rather
than hepatic dysfunction. Clotting function, as reflected in
the INR, also is normal unless confounded by warfarin
therapy [3]. It is interesting to note that by the time of
presentation to adult centers, those with failing Fontan
physiology have a much higher rate of overt hepatic
abnormalities, as shown by both standard blood testing and
imaging [9, 36]. Screening tests that could identify earlier
stages of hepatic fibrosis development would clearly be
advantageous.
More sophisticated analyses of liver function such as the
indocyanine green clearance test [17] or breath testing such
as the 13C-caffeine [48] or 13C-aminopyrine [17] breath
tests are intriguing possibilities that may be able to detect
gradations of changes in liver function. Indocyanine green
(ICG) is an inert dye eliminated exclusively by the liver
through the bile without enterohepatic circulation. Clearance depends on hepatic extraction and bile flow and can
be measured by serial blood testing or by transcutaneous
colorometric monitoring similar to pulse oxymetry [67].
In a study of adults with chronic liver disease but no
cardiac disease, ICG clearance and 13C-aminopyrine
breath testing could distinguish between cirrhotic and
noncirrhotic livers and accurately predict the risk of complications during the wait for a liver transplant. The
13C-caffeine breath test is based on the high oral bioavailability of caffeine as well as its nearly exclusive
hepatic metabolism via demethylation by cytochrome P450
1A2 to carbon dioxide (CO2). Enrichment of breath
13-CO2 can thereby be used to calculate the hepatic
metabolism of caffeine. This system, which is similar in
concept to the aminopyrine breath test, has been studied in
the setting of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
[47] and steato-hepatitis [48], and the results correlate with
other parameters of hepatic function and fibrosis (at least in
distinguishing cirrhotic from noncirrhotic disease). Alterations in caffeine and aminopyrine metabolism in cirrhosis may
be hypothesized to occur due to altered first-pass metabolism
rather than solely as a result of hepatocyte dysfunction.
However, this may be a useful aspect for those with FALD.
Physical exam findings of portal hypertension such as
caput medusa or splenomegaly often are lacking in patients
with Fontan physiology, possibly due to altered hemodynamics, and platelet counts often are normal despite significant portal hypertension. When physical findings of
portal hypertension do appear, consideration should be
given to local anatomic causes such as portal vein thrombosis or stenosis after umbilical line placement in infants.
Radiologic assessment of liver fibrosis using a variety of
methods also is available. Standard ultrasonography and
CT scanning can assess nodularity with variable sensitivity.
Doppler ultrasonography can be used to assess portal vein
flow and the presence of collateral vessels as reflective of
portal hypertension. Both nodularity from fibrosis and
portal flow changes would be expected to be late findings
and therefore not helpful in detecting signs of early hepatic
compromise. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound, in which the
transhepatic movement of microbubble contrast agents are
traced with ultrasound, can improve detection of cirrhosis
but again does not accurately distinguish earlier stages of
fibrosis [39].
Transient elastography, an ultrasonographic method for
surveying stiffness of a cylindrical hepatic sample, has
advantages of rapidity, ease of use, and reliability among
trained users. The use of elastography in Fontan-associated
liver disease, however, is problematic in that any cause of
altered hepatic stiffness (not only fibrosis) will have an
impact on the results, particularly on vascular congestion
[68], a universal finding in all Fontan subjects.
Friedrich et al. [21] studied 39 subjects with Fontan
physiology using a variety of methods and found that 36 of
the 39 subjects had abnormal stiffness by transient elastography, and 28 of 39 had fibrosis shown by the FibroTest
(Paris, France). However, no liver biopsies were performed, and the issue of congestion as a complicating
factor was not addressed. A comprehensive meta-analysis
of 40 studies examining transient elastography in various
clinical settings determined that though transient elastography theoretically has good sensitivity for cirrhosis,
claims that it identifies various earlier stages of fibrosis
have not been validated [62].

123

Diffusion-weighted MRI also has been proposed for
evaluation of hepatic fibrosis but is plagued with similar
problems. Sandrasegaran et al. [57] retrospectively
reviewed the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured by MRI in subjects who also had undergone liver
biopsy within 6 months after imaging. Although the ADC
values for cirrhotic and noncirrhotic subjects differed significantly, the values did not differentiate among other
fibrosis grades.
Current noninvasive tests are therefore relatively
insensitive in any patient with liver disease, and the diagnostic dilemmas may be magnified in Fontan patients. It
may be possible to develop a combination of complementary assessments that together more adequately predict
the presence of liver disease and outcome of cardiac surgery for children with Fontan-associated liver disease. To
do this, existing testing options must be considered carefully and prospective studies performed in children with
Fontan physiology undergoing clinically indicated liver
biopsy. Although the ‘‘gold standard’’ and best test available, liver biopsy itself has significant drawbacks ranging
from the risk of the procedure (sedation in cardiac disease,
bleeding) to the potential for sampling error and difficulty
in interpretation of results. Therefore, the development of
noninvasive alternatives would be a significant clinical
advance.
Liver Histology After the Fontan Operation
and the Role of the Liver Biopsy
In the Fontan patient, elevated right-sided pressure is
transmitted to the liver directly via the inferior vena cava
and the hepatic veins and results in venous and perivenular
sinusoidal congestion with atrophy of the liver plates in
zone 3 (the centrilobular zone). With increasing right-sided
failure, a combination of increasing right-sided pressure
and low cardiac output results in hypoxemia, with further
degeneration and eventual necrosis of zone 3 hepatocytes.
The reticulin condenses, collagen formation increases, and
perivenular fibrosis develops in the areas of necrosis, giving a venocentric pattern of fibrosis with bridging of
adjacent hepatic veins (Fig. 3). As the disease advances,
fibrous septae also link hepatic veins and portal tracts [7].
The histologic changes induced in the liver by the
Fontan operation have been documented in a relatively
small number of retrospective studies. Ghaferi and
Hutchins [25] reported chronic passive congestion, centrilobular necrosis, and cardiac cirrhosis as single features or
in combination at autopsy for nine patients who had
undergone the Fontan procedure a few hours to 18 years
previously. In their study, the severity of the hepatic
changes observed correlated with the time elapsed after the
Fontan operation and with right atrial pressures. The
patients with the longest survival had cardiac cirrhosis,
with the additional development of neoplastic transformation associated with the cirrhosis in two of the longest
survivors.
In a report of 12 Fontan patients who underwent liver
biopsies, Kiesewetter et al. [35] observed parenchymal
atrophy, sinusoidal dilation, and fibrosis in all 12 patients,
and cardiac cirrhosis in 7 of the patients. Broad scars were
noted in eight of the patients. In their study, the severity of
fibrosis, evaluated by ‘‘scoring’’ the biopsies, correlated
with hepatic vein pressures and Fontan duration. These
authors proposed a role for the liver biopsy in the management of patients with Fontan circulation.
In a follow-up publication from the same institution, the
liver biopsies of 18 patients with Fontan circulation were
evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring system,
including a score for fibrosis developed for clinical studies
of chronic hepatitis C [34]. The majority of the biopsy
specimens had distorted architecture and fibrosis without
any evidence of inflammation. The most marked feature of
the biopsy specimens was sinusoidal dilation, which did
not correlate with the degree of architectural distortion.
The authors discussed the limitations of scoring fibrosis in
this setting using a method originally developed for evaluation of another disease. In particular, pericellular sinusoidal fibrosis, observed in the majority of their biopsies, is
not a feature evaluated in current scoring systems.
In a recent autopsy study from The Children’s Hospital
of Philadelphia, portal-based fibrosis, not previously recognized in this population, was commonly observed and
associated with time since the operation [58]. It also was
seen in patients dying soon after the Fontan operation,

sinusoids. (Masson-Trichrome stain; magnification, 9100)

suggesting that hepatic injury in this population may begin
before the procedure (Figs. 4 and 5).
We can draw several conclusions from the foregoing
discussion:
1. Liver fibrosis is a significant finding in patients with
Fontan physiology.
2. The pathophysiology of the fibrosis may share similarities with typical cardiac hepatopathy, although the
finding of significant portal-based fibrosis suggests
involvement of additional factors.
3. The evaluation of liver fibrosis on biopsies may play
an important role in the management of these patients,
but staging fibrosis using current semiquantitative
systems is problematic.
In current clinical practice, use of liver biopsy to grade
the severity of inflammatory changes and to stage the
extent of fibrosis plays an important role in the evaluation
and management of patients with a wide range of diseases,
including chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis,
autoimmune hepatitis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
Specimen size and quality must be adequate for interpretation to justify the inherent risk of the procedure. The
biopsy must be large enough for an adequate number of
portal tracts to be viewed, which is essential in the evaluation of liver architecture. An adequate number of portal
tracts is proposed to be 10 or 11, the number being proportional to the biopsy size, which is recommended to be
about 2 cm in length [52]. Short specimens may result in
difficulties for patients with cirrhosis and could lead to
failure in recognizing cirrhosis in up to 20 % of cases
according to some studies [1, 51].
The width of the needle also is an important factor. In
one study, both the grade and stage of viral hepatitis were
significantly underestimated. An 18-gauge needle obtained
samples 1 mm in diameter compared with wider specimens
obtained using a 16-gauge needle [11].
Another important issue relates to the characterization of
liver fibrosis in biopsies. Currently used methods of
assessing liver damage and consequently, fibrosis, may not
apply to the evaluation of liver biopsies in Fontan
physiology.
First, scoring systems such as the Ishak, Scheuer, or
METAVIR scoring systems were devised primarily to
assess liver damage in chronic hepatitis, whereas no scoring system has been devised specifically for cardiac
hepatopathy. These staging systems usually are part of a
larger classification system that also includes assessment of
inflammatory activity (grading). The liver damage in
chronic hepatitis results primarily from a portal-based
progressive inflammation-induced necrosis. These scoring
systems reflect this portal-based pathology, whereas the
damage in cardiac liver disease appears to be largely
central and sinusoidal.
Second, these scoring systems rely primarily on architectural distortion and nodularity and do not relate specifically to the amount of fibrosis in the liver sample. Given
that fibrosis in Fontan livers may be both central and portal
based, an assessment of the overall amount of fibrosis may
be more relevant.
Third, these scoring systems are descriptive categories
and not a set of numbers arithmetically related to each
other. That is, stage 2 is not half of stage 4.
Finally, the histopathologic assessment of fibrosis in
liver samples usually is performed with trichrome or
reticulin stains, which do not correspond quantitatively to
the amount of collagen in the biopsy. Histochemistry using
Sirius red, which has an affinity for collagen types 1 and 3,

may be more suitable for quantitative assessment [23].
Evaluation of fibrosis using Sirius red staining in combination with digital image analysis may offer a quantitative
assessment of fibrosis that does not depend on an architectural-based semiquantitative scoring system.
Image analysis has been used in a few studies evaluating
changes in hepatic fibrosis after alpha-interferon therapy. A
recent study using computerized quantification of liver
fibrosis in biliary atresia found that the volume of fibrosis
correlated with transplant-free survival, whereas the Ishak
scoring system showed no correlation [46]. In another
study correlating fibrosis with hepatic venous pressure in
patients with hepatitis C, the amount of collagen assessed
by digital image analysis was a better histologic correlate
with hepatic venous pressure than the Ishak stage [8].
Mechanisms of Hepatic Fibrosis in Patients With
the Fontan Circulation: The Questions
Hepatic fibrosis refers to the presence of excess and
abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM)—scar tissue—in the
liver. Although significant breakthroughs in understanding
the general mechanisms of fibrosis have occurred over the
last two decades [18], the rodent model systems and human
diseases typically studied differ significantly from Fontanassociated liver disease, which has several unusual features. As demonstrated in a published study of histologic
findings in livers of patients with a Fontan circulation,
inflammation and hepatocyte damage, seen in most other
forms of fibrosis and important contributors to fibrosis
progression, are absent. Additionally, as noted earlier,
although many forms of fibrosis are located in the parenchyma or biliary regions, fibrosis in Fontan patients was
found to be pericentral and sinusoidal.
The following sections discuss four areas relating to
fibrosis in Fontan patients that would benefit from further
research specific to this condition.
The Nature of the ECM
Fibrosis is notable for changes in the amount, distribution,
and quality of ECM. These changes vary according to the
etiology of fibrosis and potentially determine the nature of
fibrosis progression as well as the response to treatment.
The newly deposited matrix in a fibrotic liver comprises
a variety of matrix proteins. Of these, the best studied are
the fibrillar collagens (particularly types 1 and 3), which
are the major components of the fibrotic scar. In addition to
increases in expression, these collagens undergo significant
cross-linking as fibrosis progresses. This cross-linking,
which is mediated by enzymes in the lysyl oxidase and
tissue transglutaminase families [32, 50], enhances the
mechanical stiffness of the collagens and may regulate
their susceptibility to degradation [15, 64]. Understanding
the nature and regulation of cross-linking in fibrosis may be
important to identifying specific antifibrotic therapies and
determining the potential for fibrosis to regress.
Fibronectin, a normally abundant ECM protein, increases further in fibrosis, particularly the cellular fibronectin
isoform and many of its multiple splice variants. Although
the functions of these splice variants are debated, they may
include facilitation of angiogenesis. Other matrix proteins
upregulated in fibrosis include a variety of proteoglycans,
most notably members of the small leucine-rich family of
proteoglycans that play a role in collagen organization and
elastin, which undergoes cross-linking similar to collagen.
Fibrotic areas of Fontan livers stain with the dye orcein,
which binds to elastin and to cross-linked collagen, suggesting maturity of the scar and chronicity of the injury
[31, 34].
There are multiple matrix-related questions that merit
further examination in the livers of patients with a Fontan
circulation: What is the distribution of the excess abnormal
ECM in Fontan livers (pericentral, sinusoidal, periportal),
and does this change as fibrosis progresses? How much
elastin is present, and what is its distribution? Does this
reflect maturity of the scar, or is it a function of the
localization of the disease process? How highly crosslinked are collagens and elastin in Fontan livers, and which
enzymes mediate their cross-linking? Do other matrix
proteins highly expressed in Fontan livers exist that are
relevant to collagen mechanics or angiogenesis?
Myofibroblasts: The Effector Cells of Fibrosis
Myofibroblasts, defined operationally as cells that express
a-smooth muscle actin de novo, are the matrix-producing
cells of the fibrotic liver. They are contractile, motile, and
proliferative cells responsible for the majority of abnormal
ECM deposition in tissue fibrosis. Myofibroblasts differentiate from a variety of precursor cells. In the liver, the
best described are hepatic stellate cells, located in the space
of Disse adjacent to the sinusoids, and portal fibroblasts,
located in the periportal space. Hepatic stellate cells play
multiple roles in the liver. In additional to being mediators
of fibrosis, they also function as pericytes in angiogenesis
and are highly contractile cells that potentially regulate
sinusoidal hemodynamics [19]. Portal fibroblasts are the
‘‘first responders’’ after biliary injury and thus play a critical role in biliary fibrosis [13, 37]. It is possible that
fibroblasts around the central vein play a similar role in
pericentral fibrosis (e.g., in the Fontan liver) [29]. However, these cells have not been well studied.
Myofibroblasts derived from hepatic stellate cells and
portal fibroblasts can be differentiated on the basis of

marker protein expression [5]. They also appear to differ
functionally in their response to various stimuli and their
profiles of ECM expression [29], with portal fibroblasts, for
example, expressing elastin [38]. Much of the known
information about the characterization and function of liver
myofibroblasts is derived from the study of isolated primary cells in culture. Both hepatic stellate cells and portal
fibroblasts activate to myofibroblasts in culture, and the
study of enhancers and inhibitors of this process has proved
to be invaluable in understanding the dynamics of myofibroblasts in fibrosis. Importantly, however, although the
isolation of relatively pure populations of portal fibroblasts
by our group and others has been described [38], this
population may include pericentral fibroblasts that cannot
be differentiated from portal fibroblasts.
The myofibroblast populations involved in Fontanassociated fibrosis are not known. In particular, although
hepatic stellate cells likely play an important role in sinusoidal fibrosis, the myofibroblasts responsible for pericentral fibrosis have not been well defined. Relevant questions
about the myofibroblast population in Fontan livers include
the following: Which cells are the main myofibroblast
precursor cells? Are pericentral fibroblasts involved? Does
this change as fibrosis progresses? What are pericentral
fibroblasts? Are they functionally similar to portal fibroblasts, and do they deposit elastin? Are hepatic stellate
cells involved in the sinusoidal fibrosis of Fontan livers?
Does this have implications for sinusoidal hemodynamics
or angiogenesis?
Factors Causing Activation of Precursor Cells
to Myofibroblasts
Multiple factors have been shown to mediate myofibroblast
activation, most of which have been identified through in
vitro studies. These include the soluble transforming
growth factor-b (TGFb), which appears to be a central
mediator in all forms of organ fibrosis and is downstream
of many other soluble factors found to influence the process of activation [27].
Mechanical tension also is required for activation of
myofibroblasts [60]. Tension can be generated through
matrix stiffness, which regulates the differentiation of both
hepatic stellate cells and portal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts [38, 44]. In the fibrotic liver, increased deposition of
rigid ECM proteins such as the fibrillar collagens influences the local mechanical environment. Increases in collagen cross-linking due to lysyl oxidase may enhance these
changes [22]. In some contexts, the release of active TGFb
from its latent form requires a stiff environment, suggesting
that matrix, the mechanical environment, and TGFb are
interrelated [66].
The role of mechanical forces other than matrix stiffness
in myofibroblast differentiation is not well understood. In
particular, whether the elevated outflow tract and sinusoidal pressure that characterize many Fontan livers can
facilitate the activation of myofibroblast precursor cells has
not been well studied. One publication reported that culturing hepatic stellate cells under conditions of elevated
hydrostatic pressure resulted in enhanced hepatic stellate
cell upregulated a-smooth muscle actin expression and
collagen deposition [43]. Also unknown is whether such
mechanical forces can influence TGFb activation.
Increased pressure in the biliary tree as a result of bile duct
ligation leads to fibrosis, suggesting that such mechanical
forces can influence myofibroblast behavior [30].
Hypoxia has recently been shown to regulate hepatic
stellate cell function, both directly and indirectly, and may
be at the crossroads between fibrosis and angiogenesis [61].
The relative portal venous hypoxia in some Fontan patients
may provide an additional mechanism for liver fibrosis.
Thus, understanding why fibrosis develops in patients
with a Fontan circulation requires answering several key
questions: What is the role of increased central vein and
sinusoidal pressure in myofibroblast activation? Does it
function similarly to increased matrix stiffness? Is
increased pressure in the central vein transmitted to the
sinusoids, and does it have effects on peri-sinusoidal
myofibroblast precursors (hepatic stellate cells)? Do
Fontan-associated mechanical changes have an effect on
the release of active TGFb from its latent form? What are
the implications of improved venous outflow pressure for
fibrosis in Fontan livers? Does hypoxia contribute to any of
the changes seen in Fontan livers?
The Regression of Fibrosis and, Potentially, Cirrhosis
Regression as opposed to resolution of fibrosis unquestionably occurs when the underlying chronic insult is
removed [16, 20]. This has been demonstrated in multiple
human diseases and in animal models and is thought to
require apoptosis of myofibroblasts as well as degradation
and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Whether
regression of cirrhosis occurs is debatable. Although early
cirrhosis likely can regress, the heavily cross-linked collagen and elastin of late cirrhosis may be resistant to
remodeling [31]. Additionally, late cirrhosis is characterized by significant vascular changes, including marked
shunting, which are responsible for many of the clinical
manifestations of the disease. These may persist even in the
setting of architectural remodeling [49]. Thus, there may be
a ‘‘point of no return’’ along the spectrum of cirrhosis.
Where that point is and whether it varies according to the
etiology of the disease are not known.
Pediatr Cardiol (2012) 33:1001–1012 1009
123

Regression is a particularly relevant issue for clinicians
caring for Fontan patients who may face the issue of heart
versus heart/liver transplantation. Other speakers and discussants at the symposium suggested that Fontan patients
with liver disease, even without cirrhosis, are at high risk
for liver decompensation in the setting of a heart transplant.
Aside from these acute issues, however, it is possible that
patients with fibrosis and early cirrhosis whose circulation
is normalized with a heart transplant could undergo clinically relevant regression of liver disease, avoiding the need
for a liver transplant.
Key questions underlying regression in the Fontanaffected liver include the following: What are the vascular
changes in Fontan-associated liver disease? When do they
occur and do they reverse in the setting of matrix remodeling? At what point in the progression of Fontan fibrosis
does regression become unlikely? Is this related to the
qualities of the deposited matrix (elastin content, degree of
cross-linking)? If the factors (potentially mechanical) that
induce fibrosis in patients with the Fontan circulation were
reversed, would liver disease regress? What implications
does this have for the treatment of circulatory abnormalities in patients with early liver disease? What implications
does it have for fibrotic and cirrhotic patients undergoing
heart transplantation?
Where Do We Go from Here? A Recommendation
for Systematic Evaluation of the Liver After the Fontan
Operation
In our view, an abundance of data confirms the presence of
an indolent but devastating pathologic process affecting the
liver after the Fontan operation. Although invasive and still
not ideal, liver biopsy appears to be the most accurate
means for assessing the degree of hepatic pathology present. Realizing the potential insult and ongoing damage, our
group consensus after the Symposium is to recommend
initiation of a program for evaluation of liver status through
tissue biopsy analysis, framed within the context of a
contemporary detailed characterization of cardiovascular
status. We plan to evaluate all patients approximately
10 years after the Fontan operation. The evaluation will
include a liver biopsy combined with cardiovascular
assessment through cardiac catheterization and cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging.
Although many questions remain, it is clear that liver
damage is taking place in survivors of Fontan surgery. Is a
program of proactive liver biopsy and cardiac evaluation
after Fontan operation to be considered investigational
research? In our view, assessing the degree of liver
pathology for any individual patient may be considered a
new clinical care approach and is not research.
Individual patient care will be dictated based on the
findings. For example, if significant bridging fibrosis is
discovered within the context of elevated central venous
pressure, then initiation of pulmonary vasodilator therapy
may be considered. Such patients would be ‘‘flagged’’ and
referred to the care of hepatology specialists for closer
serial follow-up evaluation and management. Furthermore,
patients with extensive liver pathology could be considered
for possible heart transplantation therapy or could be at the
top of the list for consideration of more innovative therapies such as mechanical assist and support devices currently in development.
No doubt there will be interest in creating generalizable
knowledge as the clinical experience with detailed liver
evaluation in our Fontan population grows. In particular,
development of noninvasive correlates with the liver
biopsy findings is essential. Creation of a detailed registry
of patients who will undergo hepatic and cardiovascular
evaluation at this decade milestone will be of great
importance. We endorse a shift in philosophy, from one of
reactivity to the onset of clinical complications to a proactive, systematic clinical investigation of end-organ
function in our survivors of the Fontan operation. Liver
pathology is present, likely progressive, and demands a
better understanding both for the individual patient and for
the community of survivors, which is rapidly expanding.
