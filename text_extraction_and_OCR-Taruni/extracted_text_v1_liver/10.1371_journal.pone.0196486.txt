Abstract
Purpose
Although it has been known for decades that patients with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency
(AATD) have an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, limited data exist
on non-invasive imaging-based methods for assessing liver fibrosis such as magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) quantification, and
no data exist on 2D-shear wave elastography (2D-SWE). Therefore, the purpose of this
study is to evaluate and compare the applicability of different elastography methods for the
assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis.
Methods
Fifteen clinically asymptomatic AATD patients (11 homozygous PiZZ, 4 heterozygous
PiMZ) and 16 matched healthy volunteers were examined using MRE and ARFI quantification. Additionally, patients were examined with 2D-SWE.

Results
A high correlation is evident for the shear wave speed (SWS) determined with different elastography methods in AATD patients: 2D-SWE/MRE, ARFI quantification/2D-SWE, and
ARFI quantification/MRE (R = 0.8587, 0.7425, and 0.6914, respectively; P0.0089). Four
AATD patients with pathologically increased SWS were consistently identified with all three
methods—MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE.
Conclusion
The high correlation and consistent identification of patients with pathologically increased
SWS using MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE suggest that elastography has the
potential to become a suitable imaging tool for the assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis. These promising results provide motivation for further investigation of non-invasive
assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis using elastography.
1. Introduction
Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a common, but frequently overlooked, autosomal
co-dominant hereditary disorder affecting the lungs and liver. Besides pulmonary emphysema,
AATD is known to cause chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The two largest screening studies in newborns were performed in 107,038
infants in Oregon, USA, and in 200,000 infants in Sweden and found a prevalence of 1/5097
and 1/1639, respectively [1,2]. Stoller et al. estimate that less than 10% of the approximately
70,000 to 100,000 AATD patients in the United States have been diagnosed [3]. AATD-related
cirrhosis and HCC are predominantly observed in male Caucasians from Europe and North
America [4–6]. In a cohort of 647 AATD patients in Florida, USA, a prevalence of 7.9% of any
liver disease and 3.4% of cirrhosis was observed [7]. An autopsy study, covering a 20-year
period from 1963–1982, revealed cirrhosis in approximately 35–40% of adult homozygous
AATD (PiZZ) patients at the time of death [6]. Most of these patients did not have any known
liver disease. The same study reported a mean survival of 2 years after the diagnosis of cirrhosis
with portal hypertension [6].
The alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) molecule is a serine protease inhibitor that is mainly synthesized in the liver and secreted into the blood stream. One of its most important functions is to
protect lung tissue against aggressive proteolytic enzymes such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 [8]. In patients with the PiZZ genotype, glutamate is substituted for
lysine at position 342 of the polypeptide chain in the AAT gene (SERPINA1). This mutation
changes the tertiary structure and causes the formation of falsely folded glycoprotein conglomerates in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes [8]. An accumulation of insoluble AAT in
hepatocytes leads to apoptosis and hepatic inflammation, which trigger fibrogenesis and hepatocarcinogenesis [9]. Patients with a heterozygous genotype (i.e., PiMZ) develop less severe
clinical features. Overall, for reasons not yet known, there is wide variation in the development
of liver disease [10].
Diagnostic tests include determination of AAT blood concentration and genotyping. In
contrast to pulmonary involvement and other chronic liver diseases, the ongoing AATD-related damage of liver tissue is mostly a clinically silent process without elevated liver enzymes.
Clark et al. reported that even in patients with AATD-related cirrhosis, no significant elevation

of alanine transaminase was evident [7]. Because of this diagnostic challenge, liver involvement
is frequently overlooked and discovered only once patients have developed cirrhosis or HCC,
which is associated with an unfavorable prognosis [5]. Currently, there is no effective treatment for AATD-related liver disease except for liver transplantation.
Liver biopsy is the invasive gold standard for staging liver fibrosis. However, due to pain
and the risk of complications, liver biopsy does not seem to be adequate for the screening or
follow-up of asymptomatic patients. Additionally, the limited diagnostic accuracy of this invasive method has been shown by many studies [11–13].
Elastography is an emerging imaging technique for the non-invasive assessment of mechanical tissue properties [14–17]. Quantitative measurement using shear wave excitation of biological tissue is a valuable complement to qualitative morphological imaging modalities such
as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US). According to the 2017 version of
the appropriateness criteria of chronic liver disease issued by the American College of Radiology, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is the most accurate non-invasive method for
assessing liver fibrosis, allowing assessment of the entire liver even in patients with ascites and
obesity [18]. Drawbacks are general MRI contraindications such as cardiac pacemakers or
defibrillators, cochlear implants, hepatic iron overload, and claustrophobia. Ultrasound elastography (USE) techniques such as acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) quantification and
2D-shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) have several advantages: (i) higher availability, (ii)
faster examination, (iii) lower costs, (iv) fewer contraindications, and (v) more established cutoff values for staging liver fibrosis [19–21]. Additionally, 2D-SWE has the benefit of a larger
field of view compared to ARFI quantification.
Although it has been known for decades that patients with AATD have an increased risk of
cirrhosis and HCC, limited data exist on non-invasive imaging-based methods for assessing
liver fibrosis such as MRE and ARFI quantification, and no data exist on 2D-SWE. Therefore,
the purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the applicability of different elastography
methods for the assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis.
2. Patients and methods
In this prospective study, 15 AATD patients (11 PiZZ, 4 PiMZ) and 16 healthy volunteers were
examined using MRE and ARFI quantification. Additionally, patients were examined with
2D-SWE. Healthy volunteers were matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). The
study was approved by the institutional review board (ethics committee) of the Charite´ -
Universita¨tsmedizin Berlin, Germany, and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants. AATD was confirmed by measurement of AAT serum levels, and genotyping if
indicated. Inclusion criteria were AATD patients of all genotypes and age of 18 to 79 years.
Exclusion criteria were decompensated cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, acute hepatopathies, cholestasis, signs of right heart failure, increased daily alcohol consumption (>30 g/d for men, >20 g/
d for women), malignant disease, pregnancy, and general MRI contraindications. Before USE
and MRE, all participants had fasted for at least 4 h to avoid an increased postprandial liver
stiffness [22]. The examinations were performed by three experienced physicians with 3 (K.
M.), 5 (M.W.), and 7 (R.R.) years of experience in elastography imaging. ARFI quantification
and 2D-SWE were performed on the same day, while MRE followed after a median of 125
days (interquartile range: 28 days). In healthy volunteers, MRE and ARFI quantification were
performed on the same day. All elastography methods used in this study are based on quantitative shear wave elastography using a dynamic type of force. An assessment of liver enzymes
was not considered, as no significant correlation to hepatic parenchyma damage was observed
in several previous studies including a significantly larger number of AATD patients [2,7,23].

2.1 MRE
Patients and healthy volunteers underwent MRE on a 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner (Magnetom
Aera, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel phased-array surface coil.
MRE was performed as described by Hirsch et al. 2014 using a piezoelectric driver integrated
into the patient table and fast single-shot 3D wave-field acquisition at seven drive frequencies
between 30–60 Hz with an increment of 5 Hz [24]. For each frequency, 9 slices, 3×3×5 mm
voxel size, 2 averages, and 8 time steps were acquired. MRE image acquisition took approximately 4:30 min and was performed in free and shallow breathing. For postprocessing, Matlab
9.0 R2016a (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was used. Elastograms were generated
using the k-MDEV algorithm [25]. Regions of interest (ROI) were generated in two steps: (i)
manual segmentation of the liver contour using the magnitude image and (ii) selective removal
of large vessels and other areas with little shear wave excitation using a predefined threshold.
The best results were obtained with a threshold of 1 m/s (Fig 1). Fibrosis assessment was classified as reliable after visual evaluation of the magnitude image and the elastogram. For MRE,

there are no directly comparable non-invasive cut-off values for fibrosis staging at present due
to the use of a newly developed setup with a piezoelectric driver and multifrequency dual
parameter reconstruction. Nevertheless, MRE is the best possible non-invasive comparison for
USE available to date.
For morphological liver assessment, the following MRI pulse sequences were acquired:
axial T1-weighted dual gradient-echo in-phase (IP) and out-of-phase (OP) sequences and axial
and coronal T2-weighted half-fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo (HASTE)
sequences. Dual gradient-echo signal intensities (SI) were used to calculate liver fat content
(LFC in %) according to Fischer et al. 2012: LFC = (SIIP ± SIOP) / (2SIIP) [26]. Negative LFC
values were set to zero. A large ROI was selected avoiding vessels and artifacts.
2.2 USE
Patients and healthy volunteers were examined with ARFI quantification (Virtual Touch Quantification, curved array 4C1, Acuson S2000, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Additionally, patients were examined with 2D-SWE (curved array 6–1, Aplio 500, Toshiba Medical
Systems Corporation, Otawara, Japan). USE was performed according to the guidelines of the
European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB) from
2017 [27]. All USE measurements were performed during breath hold in liver segment VI using
an intercostal approach with the subject in supine position and the right arm in abduction.
Measurements were performed approximately 2 cm beneath the liver capsule (Figs 2 and 3).
For 2D-SWE, a temporal stability of the elastogram of approximately 5 s during breath hold was
strived for. Ten measurements were obtained for the calculation of shear wave speed (SWS in
m/s). The USE reference values (Table 1) we used make no distinction between stage F0 and F1
fibrosis [20,21]. For comparison of USE and MRE, mean SWS and its standard deviation (SD)
were calculated for all methods. An USE assessment was classified as reliable with a success rate
of  60%.

2.3 Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was assessed using a two-sided t-test and Pearson’s linear correlation
coefficient with a level of significance of P<0.05.
3. Results
All parameters determined in patients and healthy volunteers are compiled in Table 2. SWS
results obtained by MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE in patients are displayed in Fig 4.
The percentage of women in the patient and healthy volunteer groups was 47% and 50%,
respectively. Patients and healthy volunteers do not show a statistically significant difference
for LFC, BMI, and age (P = 0.3240, 0.9270, and 0.2690, respectively). Therefore, the two groups
were considered suitable for comparison. The mean values and SD of LFC, BMI, and age of
patients and healthy volunteers were 5.51 ± 8.06% and 3.10 ± 5.06%, 24.07 ± 3.67 kg/m2 and
24.19 ± 3.67 kg/m2
, and 56 ± 10 years and 52 ± 12 years, respectively. Mean LFC is low in both

31.80 kg/m2
, respectively). All other participants showed a BMI < 30 kg/m2. According to the
above-mentioned reliability criteria, measurements failed for patient No. 2 (ARFI quantification, 2D-SWE), and patient No. 4 (MRE). Therefore, both patients were excluded from pairwise comparison of all parameters in the correlation analysis.

3.1 MRE
Mean SWS tended to be higher in patients compared to healthy volunteers with 1.42 ± 0.15 m/
s and 1.34 ± 0.07 m/s, respectively. However, no statistical significance was reached in this
small cohort (P = 0.0696). Despite the concerns of some patients having to cough due to
AATD-related pulmonary emphysema during the MRE examination, there were no significant
limitations in image quality due to motion artifacts, except for patient No. 4.
3.2 ARFI quantification
Mean SWS was significantly higher in patients compared to healthy volunteers with 1.40 ±
0.56 m/s and 1.10 ± 0.18 m/s, respectively (P = 0.0475). According to the reference values from
the meta-analysis of Nierhoff et al. 2013, the median fibrosis stage was F2 (F0-1: n = 8, F2:
n = 3, F3: n = 1, F4: n = 2) in patients and F0-1 in volunteers (Table 1) [20]. A single healthy
volunteer (No. 12) showed an increased SWS of 1.39 ± 0.12 m/s but no increased MRE
value compared to all other healthy volunteers and no history of liver disease. Therefore,
this result may be considered an outlier possibly caused by eating shortly before the USE
examination.

3.3 2D-SWE
Mean SWS was 2.65 ± 0.47 m/s in patients. According to the reference values from the metaanalysis of Herrmann et al. 2015, the median fibrosis stage was F0-1 (F0-1: n = 9, F2: n = 2, F3:
n = 2, F4: n = 1) with a tendency toward F2 (F22.66 m/s) (Table 1) [21].
3.4 Parameter correlation
The results of pairwise comparison of all parameters for patients (n = 13) in whom all three
methods were completed successfully are presented in Table 3. Linear correlation of MRE,
ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE is displayed in Fig 5. A high correlation is evident for the
different elastography methods: 2D-SWE/MRE, ARFI quantification/2D-SWE, and ARFI
quantification/MRE (R = 0.8587, 0.7425, and 0.6914; P0.0089). The correlation of ARFI
quantification/MRE is stronger for patients alone than for patients and healthy volunteers
taken together (R = 0.6914 and 0.6108, respectively; P0.0089). No statistically significant
influence of LFC, BMI, and age on the SWS of MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE is evident (Table 3).

4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the non-invasive assessment of AATDrelated liver fibrosis using both USE (ARFI quantification and 2D-SWE) and MRE in the same
patients and volunteers. Additionally, this is the first study investigating 2D-SWE in the assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis. At the time the examinations were performed, all AATD
patients were asymptomatic and none had a clinical indication for liver biopsy. However, this
asymptomatic course of liver disease, which is typical for AATD, frequently leads to a clinically
mute progression to cirrhosis and HCC and delays the diagnosis [5–7]. In view of this situation, there is a need for a non-invasive and precise diagnostic method for detecting and characterizing AATD-related liver fibrosis.
Two groups emerge when the results in patients and healthy volunteers are taken together.
Group 1: Most patients and healthy volunteers have similarly low SWS determined by MRE
and ARFI quantification. This group is classified as normal. In comparison to MRE, ARFI
quantification yields a wider range of SWS values. Possibly, this might explain the fact that
MRE could only show a tendency but not statistical significance for higher SWS in patients in
comparison to healthy volunteers. Group 2: Four AATD patients have consistently higher
SWS with all three diagnostic methods—MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE. Therefore,
this group is classified as pathological.
The higher correlation of ARFI quantification/MRE in patients alone versus patients and
healthy volunteers taken together might possibly be explained by a better diagnostic accuracy
in classifying more advanced fibrosis stages, as demonstrated in a previous study by Asbach
et al. [15]. Mostafavi et al. assessed 47 AATD patients (32 PiZZ, 15 PiSZ) using ARFI quantification. They found median liver stiffness to be significantly increased in PiZZ and PiSZ men
compared to PiMM men [28]. In agreement with our study, no relationship between LFC and
ARFI quantification was evident. Conversely, Mostafavi et al. showed a statistically significant
correlation between BMI and ARFI quantification. This discrepancy to our findings might be
attributable to the investigation of different study populations. Median BMI was lower in our
patient group than in the group studied by Mostafavi et al. (23.9 kg/m2
, range: 18.1–31.9 kg/
m2 versus 24.0–26.5 kg/m2
, range: 19.0–43.0 kg/m2). In our study, only one patient had a
BMI > 30 kg/m2
. Kim et al. investigated 9 PiZZ patients using MRE and correlated the findings with liver biopsy [29]. Four patients in this study had histologically proven fibrosis (F1:
n = 2, F2 or higher: n = 2). Therefore, they defined a cutoff of 1.73 m/s (3 kPa) for the detection
of any fibrosis (F1). However, Kim et al. used a different technical setup, and, therefore, this
reference value is not applicable to our study. The high correlation of USE methods in our
study is in agreement with a study of Gerber et al. including 132 patients with various chronic
liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B and C, steatohepatitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. It
was shown that ARFI quantification and 2D-SWE yield equally good results in the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis [30]. However, the focus of our study was to investigate and
compare MRE and USE in patients with a different and as yet rather poorly understood liver
disease.
Limitations of this study include the missing histopathological gold standard, the small
number of patients, due to the diagnostic challenge posed by AATD, the time interval between
USE and MRE, and the fact that 2D-SWE was only performed in patients and not in healthy
volunteers. Moreover, SWS of most patients indicated fibrosis in the F0-1 range. Therefore,
the high correlation of different methods is based on a few patients with elevated SWS. Despite
the long time interval between USE and MRE for patients, we presume, based on a previous
study by Singh et al., a rather slow disease progression and, hence, only a small dynamic of
liver fibrosis and its viscoelastic properties [31].

5. Conclusion
The high correlation and consistent identification of patients with pathologically increased
SWS using MRE, ARFI quantification, and 2D-SWE suggest that elastography has the potential to become a suitable imaging tool for the assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis. It
seems possible that AATD-related liver fibrosis can be detected early and before the development of cirrhosis. These promising results provide motivation for further investigation of
non-invasive assessment of AATD-related liver fibrosis using elastography.
