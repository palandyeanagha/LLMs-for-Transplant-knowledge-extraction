fatty liver disease: sites and mechanisms

Abstract Aims/Hypothesis: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with the metabolic syndrome. However, it is not clear whether insulin resistance is
an independent feature of NAFLD, and it remains to be
determined which of the in vivo actions of insulin are impaired in this condition. Methods: We performed a twostep (1.5 and 6 pmol min−1 kg−1
) euglycaemic insulin clamp
coupled with tracer infusion ([6,6-2
H2]glucose and [2H5]
glycerol) and indirect calorimetry in 12 non-obese, normolipidaemic, normotensive, non-diabetic patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and six control subjects. Results: In
NAFLD patients, endogenous glucose production (basal
and during the clamp) was normal; however, peripheral
glucose disposal was markedly decreased (by 30% and 45%
at the low and high insulin doses, respectively, p<0.0001) at
higher plasma insulin levels (p=0.05), due to impaired glucose oxidation (p=0.003) and glycogen synthesis (p<0.001).
Compared with control subjects, glycerol appearance and
lipid oxidation were significantly increased in NAFLD
patients in the basal state, and were suppressed by insulin to
a lesser extent (p<0.05–0.001). The lag phase of the in vitro
copper-catalysed peroxidation of LDL particles was significantly shorter in the patients than in the control subjects
(48±12 vs 63±13 min, p<0.04). Lipid oxidation was significantly related to endogenous glucose production, glucose
disposal, the degree of hepatic steatosis, and LDL oxidisability. Conclusions/interpretation: Insulin resistance appears
to be an intrinsic defect in NAFLD, with the metabolic
pattern observed indicating that adipose tissue is an important
site.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes a wide
spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis to
steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis, with histologic features of alcohol-induced liver disease in individuals who do
not consume significant amounts of alcohol. There is growing concern regarding NAFLD due to its high prevalence in
the general population and its potential for progression to
cirrhosis [1], terminal liver failure [2] and hepatocellular
carcinoma [3]. In a recent survey based on the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III
[4], unexplained aminotransferase elevations, most likely
due to NAFLD, were found in 5.4% of the general population. Similar prevalence data have been obtained in
Japanese [5] and Italian [6] populations. Multiple lines of
evidence link NAFLD with the metabolic syndrome [7],
and (visceral) obesity and type 2 diabetes are the most
commonly associated features [8–13]. Despite this, recent

studies have reported that none of the known risk factors
for insulin resistance can be found in a considerable proportion of these patients. Thus, among adult participants in
the NHANES III selected for unexplained elevated alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) activity, 55% had a BMI<30 and
16% a BMI<25 [14]. Likewise, in a population of nondiabetic NAFLD subjects, 22% were lean, 64% did not
meet the minimal criteria for metabolic syndrome (according to the National Cholesterol Education Program—Adult
Treatment Panel III definition) [15], and 12% had none of
the features of the metabolic syndrome [16].
It remains to be determined which of the in vivo actions
of insulin are impaired in NAFLD and whether these are
related to hepatic steatosis. In the present study, we selected
a group of non-obese, non-diabetic NAFLD patients to explore the extent, sites and mechanisms of insulin resistance.
Insulin-resistant states are characterised by oxidative modification of circulating LDL cholesterol particles, which are
responsible, among other factors, for damage to the vascular
endothelium [17]. Oxidative stress has been involved in the
development of steatosis and its progression to steatohepatitis [18, 19]. Based on these findings, we investigated the
oxidative status of circulating lipids in NAFLD by measuring the in vitro susceptibility of serum LDL to oxidative
damage.
Subjects and methods
Study subjects Twelve male subjects with NAFLD were
studied. All patients had chronically elevated (>6 months)
levels of ALT. The diagnosis of NAFLD was based upon the
results of a liver biopsy and the exclusion of other aetiologic
factors of chronic liver disease. Subjects were screened for
hepatitis B (HBsAg, anti-HBcAg antibodies), hepatitis C
(anti-HCV antibodies), non-organ-specific autoantibodies,
α1-antitrypsin deficiency, copper-storage disease, anti-endomysium antibodies and thyroid hormones. Alcohol consumption was assessed by detailed history, confirmed by
other family members, and laboratory markers (immunoglobulin A levels, mean red blood cell corpuscular volume); patients consuming more than 10 g of alcohol per
day were excluded. To minimise the impact of known determinants of insulin resistance, additional inclusion criteria were: (1) a BMI<30 kg/m2
; (2) a waist circumference
<102 cm; (3) a normal serum lipid profile (defined as a
serum triglyceride concentration <2 mmol/l and serum total
cholesterol <6 mmol/l); and (4) normal glucose tolerance as
determined by a 75-g OGTT (i.e. a fasting plasma glucose
concentration <7 mmol/l and a 2-h postglucose plasma
glucose concentration <7.8 mmol/l) [20, 21]. No patient had
evidence of advanced liver disease. Patients with a histological diagnosis of cirrhosis were excluded. The control
group consisted of six healthy men (with normal fasting
glucose levels, lipid profiles and liver function tests) who
were matched to the NAFLD group in terms of age, weight
and body composition (Table 1). All participants gave their
written consent prior to inclusion, and the study was approved by the ethics committee of the institution.
Histological data Liver biopsy specimens were scored
using the criteria described by Brunt [22]. On liver biopsy,
patients had variable degrees of macrovesicular steatosis
(40±21%, range 15–75%), and necro-inflammation (grade
1 in three patients, grade 2 in seven patients, and grade 3
in two patients). Fibrosis was observed in six patients
(stage 1 in five patients and stage 2 in one patient); none of
the patients had evidence of cirrhosis.
Abdominal and visceral fat measurement Fat-free mass
(FFM) was calculated according to Hume’s formula, which
has recently been validated against measurements obtained
by the tritiated water technique or electrical bioimpedance
[23]. Fat mass was calculated as the difference between
body weight and FFM. In six NAFLD patients and five
control subjects, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat depots
were estimated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as
previously described [24].
Experimental protocol All patients followed a balanced
diet (50% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 15% protein) for 3
days before the study. All experiments were performed in
the morning after an overnight fast. Teflon catheters were
placed into an antecubital vein for isotope infusion and
into a contralateral dorsal hand vein (heated at 55°C to
achieve arterialisation of venous blood) for blood sampling. The experimental protocol consisted of two periods:
1. Postabsorptive period. After obtaining a basal blood
sample, primed continuous infusions of [6,6-2
H2]glucose (0.22 μmol min−1 kg−1
; prime 17.6 μmol/kg) and
[
2
H5]glycerol (0.1μmol min−1 kg−1; prime 1.5μmol/kg)
were initiated, and continued at a constant rate throughout the study (basal and euglycaemic insulin clamp).
Blood samples for the determination of tracer enrichments, substrates and hormone concentrations were
drawn at 10-min intervals during the last 30 min of the
2-h basal period, when isotopic steady state was achieved.
2. Insulin clamp. A two-step euglycaemic–hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed using insulin infusion rates
of 1.5 pmol min−1 kg−1 and 6 pmol min−1 kg−1 (Humulin
R; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA); each step lasted for
2 h. Plasma glucose concentrations were measured every
5 min, and a 20% glucose solution was infused at a
variable rate to keep plasma glucose constant at the basal
level [25]. The 20% glucose solution was enriched with
[6,6-2
H2]glucose, and the constant infusion of [6,6-2H2]
glucose was gradually reduced and stopped 20 min into
the clamp [26]. Blood samples were drawn at 20-min
intervals during the first 80 min and every 10 min during
the last 40 min of each step.
Indirect calorimetry Using an open-circuit canopy system,
rates of CO2 production (VCO2) and oxygen consumption
(VO2) were determined for 30 min during the basal period
and during the last 30 min of each insulin clamp step.
Urine was collected at the end of the study, and the amount
of protein oxidised was calculated from urinary nitrogen
excretion.

Analytical determinations Plasma glucose levels were
measured by the glucose oxidase method (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA; interassay CV<4%). Plasma
insulin and C-peptide concentrations were assessed by a
double-antibody RIA (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los
Angeles, CA, USA; interassay CV<13%). Enzymatic kits
were used to determine fasting levels of serum cholesterol,
triglyceride, glycerol (all Alfa Biotech, Rome, Italy) and
NEFA (NEFA C; Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). HDL
cholesterol levels were evaluated after precipitation of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins with heparin and manganese chloride. Urinary nitrogen was determined by the
Kjeldahl procedure.
Deuterium (2
H) enrichment of plasma glycerol and glucose was determined as previously described [27, 28]. A
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system (model no.
5972; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to
measure 2
H enrichment, selectively monitoring ions at m/z
200, 201 and 202 for glucose, and 145 and 148 for glycerol.
Isotopic enrichments were expressed as ratios of tracer/
tracee [29].
LDL oxidisability During the basal state and after the insulin
clamp, blood samples were collected into Vacutainer tubes
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing
EDTA (1 mg/ml), immediately centrifuged, and then stored
at −20°C. LDLs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation in NaBr solution containing EDTA (density 1.019–
1.063) and stored at 4°C. The susceptibility of the LDL
fraction to oxidation was evaluated as the length of the lag
phase during copper-catalysed oxidation as previously
described [30, 31].
Data analysis In the basal state, endogenous glucose production was calculated as the rate of appearance (Ra) of
glucose according to the steady-state equation for stable
isotopic tracers [26, 27]. During the clamp, glucose Ra was
calculated using a two-compartment model as previously
described [32]. Endogenous glucose production during the
clamp was calculated as the difference between glucose Ra
and the infusion rate of exogenous glucose. The mean rate
of endogenous glucose production during each insulin infusion step was added to the glucose infusion rate during
the same period (corrected for the glucose changes in its
distribution space) to determine the total body glucose disposal rate. Since plasma insulin is a strong inhibitory stimulus
for endogenous glucose production [33], even mild hyperinsulinaemia may mask hepatic insulin resistance; therefore
an index of insulin resistance in relation to endogenous
glucose production was calculated as the product of fasting
endogenous glucose production and fasting plasma insulin
concentration. Experimental validation for the use of this
index has been published [34]. The posthepatic clearance
rate of insulin was estimated as the ratio between the insulin
infusion rate (at each of the two clamp steps) and the
corresponding increment in plasma insulin concentration

above baseline, corrected for the percentage change in Cpeptide concentrations. Posthepatic insulin delivery rates
were then calculated as the product of posthepatic insulin
clearance and the appropriate plasma insulin concentration.
Glucose and lipid oxidation rates were obtained from
calorimetric measurements as previously described [35].
Non-oxidative glucose disposal was calculated as the difference between the total glucose disposal rate and glucose
oxidation. Endogenous glucose production, the glucose
disposal rate and its components were normalised per kg of
FFM (μmol min−1 kgFFM−1
). Glycerol Ra was determined in
the basal state and during the last 30 min of each step of
the insulin clamp, in view of the relatively short time for
glycerol enrichment to reach a steady state, using the steadystate calculation. Studies tracing both endogenous glycerol
and endogenous NEFA have established that plasma glycerol Ra reflects the hydrolysis of both adipose tissue and
VLDL triglycerides at an approximate ratio of 4:1. To overcome this caveat, glycerol Ra was used as an index of wholebody lipolysis [36, 37].
Statistical analysis Results are expressed as means±SD in
the text and as means±SEM in the figures. Mann–Whitney
U-test was used to compare groups; proportions were compared using the chi square test. Changes in any variable
during the clamp steps were tested by ANOVA for repeated
measures, with group as one factor, time (or insulin dose) as
the other factor, and their interaction (to indicate differential
effects of insulin in the two groups). The mean values of the
last four measurements of the basal period and each clamp
period were used in all of the analyses. A p value of less than
0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Clinical and biochemical data The patients with NAFLD
were matched to the control subjects in terms of age, body
size and fat mass, although the latter was more centrally
located in patients than in control subjects according to the
WHR (Table 1). The amount of subcutaneous fat (201±
33 cm2 in NAFLD patients vs 264±9 in control subjects,
p=0.06) was slightly higher in control subjects than in
NAFLD patients; conversely, visceral fat (99±41 vs 75±
18 cm2
, respectively, p=0.27), and the ratio of visceral fat:
subcutaneous fat (0.48±0.16 vs 0.30±0.11, respectively,
p=0.07) tended to be higher in patients than in control
subjects, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. Three of the six NAFLD patients and none of the
control subjects reached the threshold value of 130 cm2 for
visceral fat area, above which a greater prevalence of abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome has been described [38].
Basal plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and serum
lipid levels were within the normal range in both groups.
However, fasting insulin and C-peptide levels tended to
be higher (Table 2), HDL cholesterol concentrations were
significantly lower, and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects. In subjects

with NAFLD, ALT exceeded aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) in all cases (AST/ALT ratio 0.4±0.4). Blood pressure was within the normal range in all patients. Type 2 diabetes was present in first-degree relatives of three patients
with NAFLD and two control subjects (p=ns).
Insulin clearance and secretion Posthepatic insulin clearance tended to be lower in patients than in control subjects
(0.83±0.17 vs 1.04±0.45 l/min, p=0.09), whereas fasting
posthepatic insulin delivery was not significantly different
between the two groups (65±35 vs 43±16 pmol/min, p=ns).
Plasma C-peptide levels were significantly (p=0.01) higher
in NAFLD patients than in control subjects across the insulin
dose–response curve, indicating impaired insulin-mediated
suppression of endogenous insulin release (Table 2).
Glucose metabolism In the basal state, endogenous glucose production was not different between NAFLD patients
and control subjects. During the clamp, the dose–response
curve for insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production was shifted upward slightly in patients
compared with that in control subjects, but this difference
was not statistically significant (p=0.2) (Fig. 1). The hepatic
insulin resistance index, calculated to take into account the
differences in plasma insulin concentrations, was significantly higher in the patients across the dose–response function (p=0.05) (Table 3). The ability of insulin to stimulate
glucose disposal was markedly impaired in NAFLD patients compared with control subjects (Fig. 1), by 30% at the
lower insulin dose and by 45% at the higher insulin dose
(p<0.0001). No correlations were observed between the
degree of hepatic or peripheral insulin resistance and the
amount of fatty infiltration of the liver, or histological
grading or staging.
Although the basal rate of glucose oxidation was similar
in the two groups, the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose
oxidation was significantly (p=0.003 for the interaction
term) blunted in patients compared with control subjects, as
was the insulin-stimulated increase in non-oxidative glucose disposal (p<0.001 for the interaction term) (Table 3).

and β-hydroxybutyrate were all significantly elevated in
patients compared with control subjects (Tables 1, 2).
Likewise, basal glycerol Ra (p<0.03) and lipid oxidation
(p=0.09) were higher in the patients. The insulin dose–
response functions for glycerol Ra and NEFA concentrations
(Fig. 2), and those for lipid oxidation and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations (Fig. 3), showed the expected inhibition
by insulin (p<0.0001 for all), but were each significantly
shifted upward in patients compared with those in control
subjects (p<0.05–0.001). Using the whole dataset (i.e. basal
and insulin data in both groups), lipid oxidation was positively related to glucose production (r=0.65, p<0.0001)
and negatively associated with glucose disposal (r=−0.81,
p<0.0001) (Fig. 4). Liver steatosis showed a positive correlation with the mean rate of lipid oxidation (Fig. 5).
LDL oxidisability The lag phase, the length of which is
proportional to LDL resistance to copper-induced oxidative stress in vitro, was significantly shorter in NAFLD
patients than in control subjects (48±12 vs 63±13 min,
p<0.04). When NAFLD and control data were pooled, an
inverse correlation was found between average lipid oxidation and the length of the lag phase (r=0.71, p=0.004).
Discussion
The group of NAFLD patients examined in this study was
carefully selected not to be obese, hypertensive or dyslipidaemic, to have normal glucose tolerance, and not to
have marked abdominal visceral fat accumulation, as these
conditions are associated with insulin resistance. None of
the patients met the three minimum criteria required to
identify the metabolic syndrome [15] (two patients met
one criterion, three patients met two criteria, and the remaining seven NAFLD patients met none of the criteria).
Furthermore, the patients were closely matched to the control subjects in terms of age, BMI and body composition.
Despite these efforts to minimise the impact of known determinants of insulin resistance, the NAFLD patients had
an increased WHR, a somewhat increased ratio of visceral:
subcutaneous abdominal fat (as determined by MRI) and
subclinical dyslipidaemia (higher serum triglycerides and
decreased HDL cholesterol).
In these highly selected patients, we found insulin resistance in the following target pathways: (1) endogenous
insulin release; (2) endogenous glucose production; (3)
whole-body glucose disposal and its main components (i.e.
glucose oxidation and non-oxidative glucose disposal); (4)
glycerol Ra (a reflection of lipolysis); and (5) lipid oxidation. This pattern of metabolic defects is consistent with
accelerated lipolysis—the immediate result of insulin resistance in adipose tissue—being responsible for the increased NEFA supply and oxidative use of lipid at the
whole-body level. In the liver, which normally extracts circulating NEFA with high efficiency (25–40%) [39], higher
rates of lipid oxidation and impaired suppression of hepatic
lipid oxidation by insulin (evidenced by the higher blood
β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations across the insulin dose–
response curve) provide the energy and biochemical signals
required to stimulate the gluconeogenic pathway [40]. In
normoglycaemic individuals, increased gluconeogenesis
forms the basis of hepatic insulin resistance, i.e. rates of
glucose release that are inappropriately elevated for the

prevailing insulin levels. In peripheral tissues, increased fat
oxidation may impede glucose disposal, both oxidative and
conservative, through substrate competition [41]. Although
the current results do not directly show any cause–effect
relationships, the tight correlations between lipid oxidation
and glucose production/disposal (Fig. 4), as measured by
independent techniques (calorimetry, tracer infusions and
clamp, respectively), suggest that the hepatic and peripheral
insulin resistance associated with NAFLD may be the result
of insulin resistance in adipose tissue. However, we cannot
exclude a degree of independent resistance in the liver and
skeletal muscle tissues in addition to that caused by increased fatty substrate delivery and oxidation.
Previous results have shown that NAFLD is associated
with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. In large
population studies, nearly all of the NAFLD patients examined were insulin resistant according to the homeostasis
model assessment [11, 12]. These preliminary observations
have subsequently been confirmed by more direct methods
for the measurement of insulin resistance. Employing the
glucose clamp technique, Marchesini et al. [42] demonstrated a reduction in insulin-mediated glucose disposal in
NAFLD. Although patients with diabetes and obesity were
excluded from this study, most of the subjects had multiple
features of the metabolic syndrome, such as hypertriglyceridaemia and central fat accumulation. A separate study described the abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism
and the site(s) of insulin resistance in NAFLD [43]. However, the patients enrolled were obese and had a high
prevalence of IGT—both inherently insulin-resistant states.
Although the frequently sampled IVGTT has been employed to confirm the presence of insulin resistance in lean,
non-diabetic patients with NAFLD [44], the impact of
insulin resistance on lipid metabolism was not examined in
this study.
A recent study [45] reported that lean subjects with normal
transaminases and high liver fat (∼10%, as determined by 1
H
magnetic resonance spectroscopy) had reduced suppression
of endogenous glucose production and serum NEFA during
a low-dose (2 pmol min−1 kg−1
) hyperinsulinaemic clamp
compared with matched healthy men with low liver fat
(∼2%). Since hepatic insulin resistance was significantly
related to liver fat content independently of BMI, subcutaneous fat volume and intra-abdominal fat volume (as assessed by MRI), the authors concluded that hepatic steatosis
rather than adipose tissue triglyceride content can be a major
determinant of insulin resistance in humans. Kelly et al. [46]
recently reported that the presence of liver steatosis (assessed
using computerised tomography criteria) in patients with
type 2 diabetes is associated with more severe insulin resistance (during a 6 pmol min−1 kg−1 insulin clamp). Using both
a low-dose (1.5 pmol min−1 kg−1
) and a high-dose (6 pmol
min−1 kg−1
) insulin infusion, we have conclusively demonstrated the co-existence of hepatic and peripheral insulin
resistance in biopsy-proven NAFLD independent of obesity
and diabetes. When the patients were stratified according to
histological grading and staging into fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (the latter diagnosed on the basis
of the presence of fibrosis stage 1 or higher, or necroinflammation grade 2 or higher) we were unable to identify
any differences between the two subgroups with respect to
the metabolic parameters examined (data not shown).
Although the increased lipid turnover in our NAFLD
patients is unlikely to be due to increased subcutaneous fat,
the role of visceral adiposity is an important issue [13]. It is
generally accepted that visceral adipose tissue is more insulin resistant than subcutaneous adipose tissue [47, 48].
Consequently, portal NEFA drainage may be more important than the systemic flux in the development of liver steatosis. However, in non-diabetic subjects, a visceral fat area of
∼100 cm2 (i.e., the average area in our NAFLD patients as
assessed by single-scan MRI) corresponds to a total visceral
fat mass of ∼2 kg (as determined by multiscan MRI) [49].
Even if overactive in terms of lipolysis, this adipose depot can
at most account for ∼20% of the total prehepatic NEFA load,
which is not sufficient to justify liver steatosis. Rather, it is
possible that an altered endocrine activity of visceral fat may
contribute to liver damage [50].
Whatever the role of visceral fat, it is clear that steatosis
can result from an increased delivery of circulating lipids to
the liver due to a reduced antilipolytic effect of insulin in
adipose tissue. Within the liver, part of this NEFA excess is
oxidised and the remainder is re-esterified to be exported
into the circulation as triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Reesterification is dependent on the availability of glycerol,
and the packaging of triglycerides into VLDL is dependent
upon apolipoprotein B synthesis. Since glycerol-3-phosphate can be diverted into the overactive gluconeogenic
pathway, and apolipoprotein B production may be reduced
in NAFLD (as recently described [51]), the liver retains
excessive amounts of lipids, and steatosis ensues. Our finding of a correlation between whole-body lipid oxidation and
amount of steatosis (Fig. 5) lends support to this proposed
sequence of events.
A comparison with other insulin-resistant states is of
interest. Insulin resistance in liver, muscle and fat is found in
a high proportion of patients with overt type 2 diabetes.
Furthermore, in this condition, hepatic insulin resistance is
usually more severe and results in absolute glucose overproduction [52]. However, the NEFA turnover rate and total
lipid oxidation have been reported to be only mildly abnormal in non-obese type 2 patients and in first-degree relatives of diabetic patients [53, 54]. In non-diabetic patients
with liver cirrhosis, basal endogenous glucose production is
normal and is normally suppressed by insulin; skeletal muscle is insulin resistant because of reduced glycogen formation
[55, 56], whereas glucose oxidation has been found to be
normal in the basal state and after insulin administration. In
these patients, lipolysis is increased in the postabsorptive
state, but is suppressed by insulin in an almost normal
manner [56]. Furthermore, the increased lipid flux that occurs during the fasting state results not only from insulin
resistance, but also from “accelerated starvation”, with the
early recruitment of alternative fuels for energy needs and
for gluconeogenesis (as the glycogen stores of the cirrhotic
liver are significantly reduced) [26]. Moreover, hyperinsulinism is also caused by hepatocellular dysfunction and
intrahepatic shunting in liver cirrhosis [57]; these mech640

anisms were not operative in our patients, who had normal
liver function and no histological evidence of cirrhosis. In
summary, the insulin resistance associated with NAFLD
shows similarities to, as well as differences from, other
well-characterised insulin-resistant states in terms of the
sites and mechanisms involved. These observations suggest
that the underlying mechanisms may differ, at least in part.
Several lines of evidence suggest that chronic oxidative
stress occurs concomitantly with NAFLD [58]. A possible
source of oxidative stress is enhanced lipid oxidation itself.
In an attempt to gauge this phenomenon in our patients, we
measured the susceptibility of LDL cholesterol particles to
copper-catalysed oxidation. Measurements obtained using
this in vitro method have been shown to correlate with in
vivo measurements assessed using NMR spectroscopy [59].
Compared with the control group, LDL oxidisability was
increased in the NAFLD group and, perhaps more importantly, was directly related to lipid oxidation.
In conclusion, in non-obese, non-diabetic patients with
biopsy-proven NAFLD, insulin resistance is marked and
involves the liver and the peripheral (adipose and skeletal
muscle) tissues and multiple intracellular pathways of substrate (glucose and lipids) disposition. Whether hepatic
steatosis is a consequence of peripheral insulin resistance
or causes insulin resistance remains unclear, but the results
of this study suggest that excess NEFA flux due to peripheral
insulin resistance may contribute to hepatic steatosis. Adipose tissue insulin resistance and endocrine overactivity,
especially in ectopic depots, may be salient features of the
metabolic profile for NAFLD.
