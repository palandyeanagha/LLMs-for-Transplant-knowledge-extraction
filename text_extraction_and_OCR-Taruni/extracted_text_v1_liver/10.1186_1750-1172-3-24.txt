Abstract
Background: Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare lysosomal storage disease subdivided
into three phenotypes of increasing severity: Scheie, Hurler-Scheie and Hurler. To gauge the
effectiveness of treatments and to determine the load likely to fall on health-care systems, it is
necessary to understand the prevalence and natural progression of the disease especially with
regard to life-expectancy. In general such data on the natural history of lysosomal storage diseases
is sparse.
Methods: Analysis of prevalence and patient survival in MPS I disease using a unique longitudinal
data set initiated and maintained over a period of more than 20 years by the Society for
Mucopolysaccharide Diseases (UK).
Results: The birth prevalence of MPS I in England and Wales over the period 1981 to 2003 was
1.07/100,000 births and within ± 5% of estimates reported in several studies that examined
reasonably large populations. The median survival for MPS I patients (including all phenotypes
irrespective of various treatments) was found by Kaplan-Meier analysis to be 11.6 years. This result
was driven by the relatively poor survival of patients with the Hurler phenotype who, irrespective
of any treatments received, had a median survival of 8.7 years; when censoring for receipt of bone
marrow transplant (BMT) was implemented median survival of Hurler patients was diminished to
6.8 years. The difference between these survival curves was statistically significant by log rank test
and can be attributed to beneficial effects of BMT and or selection of patients with superior
prognosis for intervention with BMT. Survival curves for Hurler patients who received and did not
receive BMT were very different. Probability of survival at 2 year after BMT was ~68% and was
similar to this after 5 years (66%) and ten years (64%); the mean age of Hurler patients at receipt
of BMT was 1.33 years (range 0.1 to 3 years). Follow up was insufficient to determine median
survival of the milder phenotypes however, unsurprisingly, this was clearly superior to that for
Hurler patients.
Conclusion: The birth prevalence of MPS I in England and Wales is 1.07/100,000 and the median
survival for MPS I patients is 11.6 years.

Background
Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a panethnic,
chronic and progressive, autosomal recessive lysosomal
storage disease in which degradation of the glycoaminoglycans (GAGs) dermatan and heparan sulphate is
deficient. First described by Hurler in 1919, a milder phenotype was later identified by Scheie in 1962 [1]. Currently three clinical syndromes are often referred to which,
from severe through intermediate to mild phenotypes, are
termed Hurler, Hurler-Scheie and Scheie. It is clear however that this is an oversimplification and that the full
phenotypic spectrum of disease forms a continuum.
The deficient enzyme in MPS I is α-L-iduronidase responsible for removing terminal iduronic acid residues during
the sequential degradation of dermatan and heparan sulphates [1]. The disease is characterised by inappropriate
storage of these GAGs with accompanying organ enlargement, the excretion of abnormal quantities of GAGs in
urine, and disrupted GAG turnover that especially affects
connective tissue [1]. The multi-system sequelae result in
clinical manifestations that vary between individuals but
may include mental retardation, skeletal abnormalities,
enlarged liver and spleen, respiratory problems, heart disease and reduced life expectancy [1].
Traditionally treatments for MPS I have aimed at relieving
symptoms. More radical treatments have been explored
including bone marrow transplantation which has
become the treatment of choice for carefully selected
Hurler patients. Enzyme replacement therapy (alpha-Liduronidase, Aldurazyme®) is now available to treat the
intermediate and milder phenotypes (Hurler-Scheie and
Scheie) as well as recently more severely affected patients
[2]. The development of enzyme enhancement therapy,
substrate reduction strategies and also of gene therapy for
lysosomal storage diseases and other metabolic disorders,
and the various combinations of such strategies, are possible future developments.
In view of the extremely high cost of some new therapies
that have been or are being developed under the exclusivity provided by orphan drug legislation it becomes important to estimate the health gains returned with use of these
treatments so that a clear understanding can inform the
deployment of limited health resources. Difficulties arise
in taking appropriate account of the clinical and costeffectiveness of such interventions because of the sparsity
of good quality data as amply exemplified in recent
Health Technology Assessment of enzyme replacement
therapy for Gaucher's disease [3-5]. Many data-collecting
initiatives are prompted by marketing of new technologies with or without recommendation from regulatory
authorities. However such data collection will usually
only gain good quality (i.e. prospective) information for
patients on-treatment and fails to provide evidence about
'natural progression' of disease in the absence of the new
technology since patients that are off-treatment are not
representative of the whole disease population and are
likely to differ from those on-treatment. Therefore there is
very little evidence from such sources with which a new
technology can be assessed. This leads to difficulties for
physicians and health-care commissioners in determining
the clinical and ultimately the relative cost-effectiveness of
a technology under conditions of competing budgetary
requests.
In order to gauge the effectiveness of new and future treatments it is necessary to understand the natural progression of the disease especially with regard to patients'
quality of life and life-expectancy. In general such data on
the natural history of lysosomal storage diseases is sparse.
Here we analyse patient survival in MPS I and disease
prevalence of MPS I using a unique longitudinal data set
initiated and maintained over a period of more than 20
years by the Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases
(UK). This data will be of interest to clinicians, health care
authorities, commissioning bodies, those engaged in
diagnosis of rare diseases and to patient societies and
patient families.
Methods
The Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases UK (SMD)
made available anonomysed records of MPS I patients
held in its registry. The Society has aimed to collect data
on every UK MPS I sufferer. As most, if not all, patients are
now seen at a small number of designated centres, most if
not all UK patients are entered into the register. While the
number of patients likely to be missing from the register
is unknown, it is estimated by collators of the register and
by clinicians treating MPS I patients to be zero or very few.
Therefore, the dataset can be considered as virtually complete for all UK patients from 1981.
The dataset was analysed for patients entered in to the register between 1981 and May 2005. This registry holds
information on birth dates and country of birth, diagnosed MPS I syndrome, receipt of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and date of transplant, receipt of
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and date of death.
Date of diagnosis and genotype of a significant proportion of patients is also recorded but is incomplete; as
would be expected [6] the recorded genotypes were highly
variable and mostly private except for the W402X mutation which was fairly common.
Prevalence
Due to the well-documented possible delays in diagnosis
of MPS I, especially with regard to the milder syndromes,
we considered births up to 2003 rather than more recent.

Although the registry records are judged comprehensive,
we considered that ascertainment for England and Wales
was most likely to be complete and that these cases would
also account for the vast majority of MPS I patients in the
UK. The three-year running average by year for MPS I
births was calculated and compared with the three-year
running average for all births in England and Wales. These
averages were utilised in order to smooth chance year on
year fluctuations which might be expected to occur with
rare events such as MPS I births. Total number of births in
England and Wales was accessed from National statistics
[7].
Survival
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, median survival estimates
and log-rank tests were performed using Stats Direct and
STATA (version 8) software for all patients in the registry.
Results
At the time of analysis the registry held data on a total of
196 MPS I patients covering the 24 years 1981 to 2005.
The patients were categorised according to syndrome as
follows: 143 Hurler, 41 Hurler-Scheie, and 12 Scheie.
Prevalence
Figure 1 shows the three-year running average for MPS I
births and for all births in England Wales 1981 to 2003.
Of the 167 MPS I births 118, 38 and 11 were classified as
Hurler, Hurler-Scheie and Scheie respectively. The birth
prevalence for MPS I across this period calculates to 1.07/
100,000 births. The prevalence of the sub-syndromes of
MPS I were Hurler syndrome: 0.76/100,000, Hurler-Sheie
syndrome 0.24/100,000 and Sheie syndrome 0.07/
100,000.
Table 1 lists the birth prevalence by syndrome and compares our results with others reported in the literature [8-
15]. For overall prevalence of MPS I, there is good agreement (within ± 5%) between our results and those
reported from studies that examined reasonably large
populations except for substantially lower rates observed
for Germany which the authors termed exploratory[15].
Survival
Of the 196 MPS I patients 85 had died. The Kaplan-Meier
survival curve and approximate 95% CI for all 196 MPS I
patients is shown in Figure 2A. Median survival estimated
from this plot was 11.6 years, 95% CI: 9.5 to 13.7 (see

syndrome where these were calculable). The survival curve
for the 143 Hurler patients is shown in Figure 2B. Median
survival from this plot was 8.7 years, 95% CI: 7.6 to 9.7. It
is clear that the curve for all MPS I patients is dominated
by the 79 deaths among Hurler patients. The survival plot
for 41 Hurler-Scheie patients is shown in Figure 2C. There
was insufficient information for estimation of median
survival but it is obvious this is superior to that for Hurler
patients. Of the 12 Scheie patients one was deceased (aged
17.5 years) and the remaining 11 alive with ages ranging
14.1 to 24.6 years as of May 2005.
Twenty nine patients (25 Hurler-Scheie and 4 Scheie) had
received ERT but the date of commencement was unrecorded. Due to the small proportion receiving ERT and the
short time that ERT has been available it was not possible
to model survival of these patients post-treatment. The
unlikelihood of a dramatic short-term effect on mortality
amongst milder syndrome patients means it is very
unlikely that the survival curves would be materially
altered by not censoring these patients at the time they
started ERT.
Bone marrow transplant therapy and survival
Two Hurler-Scheie and 65 Hurler patients were in receipt
of BMT. The effect of this on the survival curve for Hurler
patients was examined by censoring those patients in
receipt of BMT at the time they received BMT and comparing the resulting curve with that for Hurler patients irrespective of BMT therapy (i.e. without censoring for receipt
of BMT (Figure 2D)). The curves are significantly different
according to the log rank test (Hazard Ratio 0.58, chi
squared p = 0.0004). The difference could be attributed to
superior prognosis of those selected for BMT, to benefits
upon survival of receiving BMT or to both.
Survival of Hurler patients who received BMT after receipt
of BMT is shown in Figure 2E. The mean age at transplant
was 1.33 years. A particularly hazardous period is the year
immediately following transplant. This might be attribTable 1: Prevalence studies of MPS I

uted to poor short-term prognosis for those selected for
transplant, or more likely inherent risks of the BMT procedure or perhaps relative frailty of Hurler patients compared with other patients in receipt of BMT. After one year
post-BMT probability of survival remains good (68%,
66%, and 64% at 1, 5, and 10 years post-BMT). These
results are similar to those reported in a recent pan-European study [16]. The survival from birth of Hurler patients
who subsequently did and did not receive BMT is shown
in Figure 2F.
Discussion
In this retrospective study, utilising a registry of patient
data encompassing most, if not all, UK patients with MPS
I, the prevalence of the disease was 1.07/100,000. The
prevalence not only falls within all definitions of an
orphan disease but meets the definition of an ultraorphan disease (less then 2/100,000) as defined by the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [17].
This is the largest reported prevalence study, involving
nearly twice as many cases and a slightly bigger population pool of the next largest (see Table 1). The prevalence
obtained was similar to that from other studies with a
large population pool from which cases were ascertained.
All studies have been undertaken in developed countries
with predominantly Caucasian populations. The prevalence of the sub-syndromes of MPS I reported here are of
the same order of magnitude as other studies that have
been able to measure the prevalence or have reported it
(see Table 1) [15]. The prevalence of Hurler syndrome is
highest and Sheie the lowest. The effect of detection bias
due to the more ready identification of severe compared
to less severe syndromes within these findings is unclear.
As expected survival analysis indicated the relative severity
of Hurler's syndrome, with median survival of 8.7 years,
and the relative mildness of Sheie syndrome relative to
Hurler-Sheie syndrome and all MPS I patients. Median
survival could not be calculated for the Hurler-Sheie or
Sheie syndromes at present due to the longer duration of
follow up required.
Although 60% (25/41) of Hurler-Scheie and 33% (4/12)
of Sheie patients had received treatment with enzyme
replacement therapy the small sample sizes and the too
recent emergence of treatment precluded the possibility of
estimating an effect of the therapy on survival. With
regard to bone marrow transplant in Hurler patients, censoring those patients who received a transplant reduced
survival indicating the better prognosis of those selected
to receive BMT and/or the benefit of BMT. The survival of
Hurler patients post-BMT was very similar in this study to
that recently reported for a pan-European multicentre
study [16] which contained twice as many cases (n = 148
compared to 68), with survival rates at one year being
68% and remaining relatively stable for those followed for
up to 10 years.
Surveillance of long term effectiveness and of adverse
events relating to drug and other treatments is best reliant
on large, population-based, disease-specific, well organised studies. For very rare conditions, disease specific registries would represent the best way of monitoring
treatment effectiveness in terms of survival and other
patient-centred outcome measures. Furthermore, they are
very useful for measuring adverse events which are doubly
difficult to monitor through hopefully low frequency of
such events and the rarity of the disease. Whilst the treatment licensing bodies can request post-marketing studies,
in addition to post-marketing reporting of adverse events,
these usually only collect data on patients treated with the
specific intervention and thus untreated patients or
patients treated with other interventions (licensed or otherwise) are often not included [18]. Furthermore, the US
Food and Drug Administration documentation demonstrates that post-marketing studies committed to by the
pharmaceutical industry are infrequently implemented or
completed [19]. The clinical registries of individual or
multiple specialist centres set up for disease-specific conditions and unique charitable registries, such the one utilised in this report set up by the Society for
Mucopolysaccharide Diseases UK [20], may offer the only
reliable source of information on the natural history and

the effect of therapies for specific rare conditions. With
more therapies on the horizon, their likely marketing
approval under orphan drug legislation and relative great
expense, it is important that properly functioning registries be created or supported if they already exist, to record
data on all patients whether treated with emerging technologies or not.
Conclusion
This study, with the most extended follow up to date in a
large target population, sets the birth prevalence of MPS I
at 1.07/100,000 live births and median survival at 11.6
years.
