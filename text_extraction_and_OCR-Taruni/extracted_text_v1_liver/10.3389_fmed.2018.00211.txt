The risk of mineral and bone disorders among patients with chronic kidney disease is
substantially elevated, owing largely to alterations in calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D,
parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23. The interwoven relationship among
these minerals and hormones results in maladaptive responses that are differentially
affected by the process of kidney transplantation. Interpretation of conventional
labs, imaging, and other fracture risk assessment tools are not standardized in
the post-transplant setting. Post-transplant bone disease is not uniformly improved
and considerable variation exists in monitoring and treatment practices. A spectrum
of abnormalities such as hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism,
osteomalacia, osteopenia, and osteoporosis are commonly encountered in the
post-transplant period. Thus, reducing fracture risk and other bone-related complications
requires recognition of these abnormalities along with the risk incurred by concomitant
immunosuppression use. As kidney transplant recipients continue to age, the drivers
of bone disease vary throughout the post-transplant period among persistent
hyperparathyroidism, de novo hyperparathyroidism, and osteoporosis. The use of
anti-resorptive therapies require understanding of different options and the clinical
scenarios that warrant their use. With limited studies underscoring clinical events such as
fractures, expert understanding of MBD physiology, and surrogate marker interpretation
is needed to determine ideal and individualized therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are a unique population with substantial risk factors for
bone disease and associated complications. KTRs can experience persistent alterations in mineral
and bone disease (MBD) parameters, immunosuppressive modification of osteoblast/osteoclast
activity, de-novo MBD abnormalities, and age-related bone loss. Understanding the patterns and
pathophysiology of MBD pre- and post-transplant is important to accurately interpret laboratory
and radiologic tests, and to guide therapy to reduce complications, including fractures.
The abrupt change in kidney function and the medications required to maintain a graft
are competing forces that simultaneously affect bone disease. In the first 12 months after
kidney transplantation, bone loss, as evidenced by surrogate laboratory and imaging tests,
is most pronounced (1, 2). Depending on kidney function, both bone mineral density
and markers of bone turnover may return to pre-transplant and even normal levels (3).
Despite this eventual normalization, the risk of hip fractures during the first 3 years after

Vangala et al. Mineral and Bone Disorders After Kidney Transplantation
kidney transplantation is greater than the already elevated hip
fracture risk of dialysis-dependent patients (4, 5). Subsequently,
the risk improves and is identical to that noted in pre-transplant
patients. This fluctuating risk is likely related to bone loss from
transplant medications and the slow evolution of MBD that
accompanies near normal kidney function. Between 1997 and
2010, the incidence of hip fractures, the most substantial bonerelated clinical event, was reported to be 3.8 per 1000 patientyears (6). Recent studies have demonstrated that hip fracture
incidence has declined (6, 7), possibly coinciding with more
steroid-minimizing or sparing protocols.
As per the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR)
annual data report (8), kidney waitlisted patients in year 2016,
when compared to 2006, had higher percentage of patients aged
≥65 years (22.5 vs. 15.3%) and similarly, 18.4% of KTRs in
2016 were ≥65 years of age compared to around 10% in 2004.
Thus, even if MBD and glucocorticoid use do not result in
significant bone pathology, patients are still at risk for age-related
osteopenia, and osteoporosis, especially in this era of improved
patient and graft survival post-transplant.
Due to the numerous factors impacting mineral and
bone homeostasis, evaluation, and treatment are not
standardized. Responses to decreased bone mineral density,
hyperparathyroidism, perioperative hypophosphatemia,
and vitamin D disorders vary by institution. Consequently,
examining treatment regimens to address mineral disorders
and modify risk in bone-related disease, and the evidence that
supports these plans, can help identify gaps in knowledge in need
of further examination.
MBD PHYSIOLOGY: PRE- AND
POST-TRANSPLANTATION
Calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH),
and bone-derived fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23) interact
through a series of underlying feedback mechanisms. In patients
with normal kidney function, the main goal of this interplay is
to preserve serum concentrations of calcium and phosphate, and
ultimately bone health. PTH synthesis and secretion is influenced
by calcium, phosphate and vitamin D levels. In a functioning
kidney, 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) is converted to active
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D) by 1α-hydroxylase, an
enzyme that is upregulated by PTH and inhibited by high
FGF-23 levels. Active vitamin D can stimulate gut calcium
and phosphate absorption. Either through increased sodiumphosphate cotransporter (NaPi-IIb) expression or increased
transport via brush-border membrane vesicles, vitamin D
stimulates intestinal phosphate absorption (9). PTH secretion is
very sensitive to its primary stimulus, serum calcium levels, and
is also responsive to hyperphosphatemia (10). In conjunction
with another phosphaturic hormone, FGF-23, serum phosphate
levels can be restored, provided adequate kidney function. The
majority of filtered phosphate is reabsorbed in the proximal
tubule via the NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc cotransporters (11). PTH
and FGF-23 (after binding to the FGF receptor-Klotho complex)
interfere with tubular phosphate reabsorption by internalization
of NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc transporters (12, 13). Absence of
theses cotransporters leads to significant urinary phosphate loss.
In addition, elevated FGF-23 can reduce the production of
active vitamin D and interfere with transepithelial absorption
of phosphorus in the intestines (14). However, paracellular gut
phosphate absorption remains constant and the contributions of
each mechanism of absorption are still uncertain. Lastly, PTH
releases calcium and phosphorus from the bones.
In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney
injury (AKI), when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls to less
than 60 ml/min, a rise in FGF-23 production by osteocytes and
osteoblasts is one of the earliest changes (15). In these patients,
serum phosphate is either normal or even slightly lower due to
high FGF-23 levels. The exact stimulus for FGF-23 production in
the bone is not certain, but 1,25(OH)D, dietary phosphate, and
reduced clearance have been reported as potential mechanisms
of elevated serum levels (16–19).
The distal convoluted tubule is responsible for the majority
of α-klotho production (20). Klotho has been deemed an
antifibrotic, antioxidant, and anti-aging protein. Within the
domain of MBD, membrane-bound α-klotho has a well-defined
role in forming a complex with its obligate co-receptor, FGF23, and increasing phosphaturia. However, all of the endocrine
functions of soluble α-klotho independent of FGF-23 have
not been fully uncovered. In addition to the kidney, α-klotho
is produced by chief cells of the parathyroid gland (21).
With FGF receptors also expressed in the parathyroid gland,
speculation exists on whether α-klotho in conjunction with
FGF-23 may decrease PTH production, possibly by increasing
expression of both calcium-sensing receptors and vitamin D
receptors (21, 22). Yet, despite increasing FGF-23 levels in CKD,
hyperparathyroidism persists due to other stimuli.
As CKD advances and GFR falls further, phosphate excretion
must increase per nephron to maintain balance. For reasons that
have yet to be elucidated, FGF-23 levels increase. A combination
of high FGF-23 levels and reduced functional nephron mass
leads to low 1α-hydroxylase activity and resultant low active
vitamin D levels. These lower active vitamin D levels, in
conjunction with resulting hypocalcemia, stimulate a subsequent
increase in PTH (15). Eventually, once the renal capacity is
critically reduced, phosphorus retention and hyperphosphatemia
result. Hyperphosphatemia stimulates even more PTH secretion,
perpetuating further a maladaptive response. Of note, confusion
exists over what PTH levels are deleterious because skeletal
resistance to PTH has been recognized in patients with kidney
disease(23). Overall, the end result of progressive CKD is the
development of hyperparathyroidism, hypovitaminosis D, and
hypocalcemia (Figure 1A).
Immediately post-transplant, circulating levels of FGF-23 and
PTH are still high. However, with successful transplantation,
GFR is significantly higher. As a result, high levels of PTH
and FGF-23 result in significant urinary phosphorus losses and
hypophosphatemia (Figure 1B). FGF-23 levels drop dramatically
at 3 months post-transplantation (24) and at 1 year mimic
levels seen in CKD patients with comparable eGFR (25). From
a vitamin D perspective, a functioning transplanted kidney and
eventual reductions in FGF-23 lead to a gradual increase in

hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to active 1,25(OH)D, thereby leading
to higher gut absorption of calcium and phosphorus. How αklotho levels change in the transplant setting is not yet clear.
Smaller studies have reported substantial increases in urinary
soluble klotho on postoperative day 2 and 5 while no substantial
distinction has been detected in serum levels before and after
transplant (26, 27).
Understanding of MBD physiology is not yet complete. While
the role of FGF-23 in phosphate and vitamin D metabolism has
been increasingly uncovered, uncertainty over its most proximal
stimulus remains. Several studies have demonstrated increases in
FGF-23 with phosphate loading (28–31) and reduced levels with
dietary restriction and binders (32); yet, serum phosphate levels
when altered by intravenous administration have not yielded
changes in FGF-23 (30). Clearly, the mechanism of FGF-23
stimulation lies within phosphate homeostasis but may not be
as direct as an inverse relationship with serum phosphate levels.
Limited understanding exists about the role of membrane-bound

CLINICAL SPECTRUM
Clinical disorders related to MBD in KTRs include calcium
and phosphate disorders, vitamin D deficiency, secondary and
tertiary hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis, and osteonecrosis
(Table 1). While there are other MBD disorders including
vascular calcification and kidney stones, this review will focus
on common mineral and bone clinical disorders following kidney
transplantation.
Calcium Disorders
Hypercalcemia
Hypercalcemia is common after kidney transplantation and has
been reported in 11–31% of KTRs within 1 year (33–38). In some
studies, prevalence of hypercalcemia is noted in more than 50%
of patients, especially in the subset of patients who had moderate
to severe hyperparathyroidism prior to kidney transplantation.
Severe hypercalcemia can cause acute kidney injury in the
allograft due to volume contraction and by reducing perfusion
to the allograft by direct vasoconstriction. In the presence of high
PTH, phosphaturia and alkaline urine resulting from concurrent
use of oral alkali, there is also concern of nephrocalcinosis.
The primary drivers of hypercalcemia are persistent
hyperparathyroidism and high vitamin D levels. In addition to
high PTH levels, resolution of uremia post-transplant is also
associated with a decrease in skeletal resistance to PTH. In
addition to these endogenous changes, most transplant programs
use calcium and vitamin D supplements, especially when a
steroid is part of the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen.
Rarely, acute severe hypercalcemia can occur in the immediate
post-transplant period, requiring emergency parathyroidectomy.
Often these patients were on high doses of cinacalcet prior
to transplantation (39). Abrupt discontinuation of cinacalcet
post-transplantation coupled with high PTH and vitamin D
levels can lead to acute, severe hypercalcemia.
Even though hypercalcemia is multifactorial, most patients
have inappropriately high PTH level for the degree of
hypercalcemia. In such patients, especially in the first few months
after transplant, no further work up may be needed. However, if
PTH is appropriately suppressed, non-PTH related causes need
to be investigated. Similar to evaluation of hypercalcemia in nontransplant patients, other etiologies including granulomatous
disease, milk-alkali syndrome, malignancies need to be ruled
out (40–42). Low turnover or adynamic bone disease may be
associated with hypercalcemia.
In majority of patients, hypercalcemia is gradual,
asymptomatic, and can be medically managed. In patients
with mild hypercalcemia, we encourage adequate fluid intake
and avoidance of medications that can independently increase
serum calcium levels, such as thiazide diuretics and calcium
supplements. If vitamin D replete, vitamin D supplements
should be discontinued. If hypercalcemia persists despite these
measures, and if PTH level is persistently high, cinacalcet can be
started temporarily and dose titrated (43). If cinacalcet cannot be
continued for financial reasons or intolerance to the drug, then
subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered to treat tertiary
hyperparathyroidism (44, 45). Since involution of hyperplastic
parathyroid glands and a resultant decline in PTH concentration
occur over a year, many transplant physicians prefer to
wait for at least a year after kidney transplantation before
proceeding to surgery, provided there is no graft dysfunction
related to hypercalcemia. Also, treatment of osteoporosis with
bisphosphonates and denosumab may improve serum calcium
levels.
Hypocalcemia
Hypocalcemia is infrequently observed after kidney
transplantation. Serum calcium levels may decrease initially
in the first week after transplantation, likely secondary to a fall
in PTH levels and discontinuation of exogenous calcium and
vitamin D supplements (46). In such patients, hypocalcemia is
usually mild. However, severe hypocalcemia and hungry bone
disease can be seen after parathyroidectomy surgery. While it
is hard to predict the severity and duration of hypocalcemia
with hungry bone disease, most patients have high presurgery PTH levels. Similarly, patients who had undergone
parathyroidectomy pre-transplant may be on high dose

Vangala et al. Mineral and Bone Disorders After Kidney Transplantation
parenteral vitamin D supplements, and usually the transplant
team and the patient are unaware of parenteral medications
administered during dialysis. Often these patients are also on
calcium-based phosphate binders that are also discontinued
post-transplantation. Abrupt cessation of parenteral vitamin D
and oral calcium supplements post-transplant may lead to severe
hypocalcemia. Lastly, a combination of hyperphosphatemia and
associated hypocalcemia can be noted in the immediate
post-transplant period in patients with delayed graft
function.
Phosphate Disorders
Hyperphosphatemia is usually only seen in patients with delayed
graft function, or in transplant patients with advanced CKD.
On the other hand, hypophosphatemia is common in KTRs
and occurs in ∼50% of patients. It most commonly occurs 3–4
weeks after transplantation, especially in patients with immediate
graft function and high pre-transplant PTH levels (47). ESRD
patients have high concentrations of PTH and FGF-23 just prior
to transplantation. When GFR rises sharply with immediate graft
function, these two phosphaturic hormones increase urinary
fractional excretion of phosphate and result in significant urinary
loss of phosphorus (Figure 1B). It is usually self-limited and
serum phosphorus levels begin to normalize within the first
few months, correlating with decline in FGF-23 levels (37).
However, in a small fraction of patients, renal phosphate
wasting persists for few months despite normal phosphate
levels, and this may be related to persistent hyperparathyroidism
(48).
Among medications, glucocorticoids can reduce the
expression of Na-Pi co-transporters and worsen urinary
loss of phosphorus (49). Steroids can also reduce oral
phosphorus absorption in the intestines (50, 51). Rapamycin
may modulate Klotho expression through mTORC2 activation
and contribute to hypophosphatemia (52, 53). Tenofovir
can cause Fanconi-like syndrome and lead to urinary
phosphate loss. In rats, ischemia-reperfusion injury can
reduce phosphate reabsorption in the tubules (54). However,
it is unclear if phosphaturia is increased in humans who
undergo deceased donor transplantation with associated
kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury. Recently there have been
multiple reports of hypophosphatemia with the use of ferric
carboxy-maltose for iron deficiency anemia (55–58) and it
appears to be related to acute and reversible increase in FGF-23
levels.
In majority of patients, hypophosphatemia is asymptomatic.
Muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis do not
occur until serum phosphorus concentration is <1 mg/dL.
Hypophosphatemia may be associated with a lower risk of deathcensored graft failure and cardiovascular mortality, but not
non-cardiovascular or all-cause mortality (59). On the contrary,
another study showed that serum phosphorus <2.5 mg/dL at 1-
year post-transplant was associated with higher mortality and
death-censored graft failure (60). However, this may likely reflect
an underlying association with elevated FGF-23 levels, which has
been demonstrated to be a risk factor for graft loss and mortality
(61).
Vitamin D Disorders
The majority of KTRs have vitamin D deficiency (62–64). When
compared with non-transplant controls, KTRs have significantly
lower 25(OH)D levels (65). Even though seasonal variation in
serum 25(OH)D concentration due to presence or lack of sun and
heat exposure is not consistently observed (63, 66), transplant
patients frequently have significant vitamin D deficiency in both
seasons. This may be related to avoidance of significant sun
exposure and to the use of sunscreen lotions to reduce the risk
of skin cancer (62, 63) post-transplant.
From a transplant perspective, low 25(OH)D maybe
associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Very
low levels may also be associated with rapid decline in kidney
function (67). Vitamin D deficiency at 3 months post-transplant
may be associated with higher risk for significant interstitial
fibrosis and tubular atrophy at 1 year and as a result, lower
GFR (68). However, there are conflicting reports about the link
of vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of acute rejection
(69–72). Also conflicting is the link between low vitamin D levels
and increased risk of cytomegalovirus and BK virus infections
(71, 73, 74). These observations have not been validated with
prospective randomized studies. Results of the randomized
trial (VITA-D) to evaluate the effect of cholecalciferol on graft
function, acute rejection rates, and the number and severity of
infections within first year of transplantation have not yet been
published (75).
In the last few decades, vitamin D and its effect on extraskeletal health has gained significant interest, especially its role
in cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mortality (76).
Among KTRs, studies have not consistently shown an association
between low vitamin D levels and risk of cardiovascular diseases
or malignancies (77–79). Severe vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D
<10 ng/mL] may be associated with higher risk for posttransplant diabetes (80). A small observational study suggests
that the activated vitamin D, paricalcitol, reduces proteinuria in
KTRs by reducing inflammation (81). A prospective randomized
study (VITALE) underway is evaluating the effect of vitamin
D supplementation on a composite endpoint of de novo
diabetes mellitus, major cardiovascular events, de novo cancer
and mortality in KTRs (82). Until it sheds light, the link
between vitamin D supplementation and extra-skeletal benefits
is unknown.
Hyperparathyroidism
Secondary hyperparathyroidism in advanced CKD results from
multiple stimuli, including hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia,
low 1,25(OH)D levels, and skeletal resistance to PTH. These
factors result in continuous stimulation of PTH synthesis
and secretion. Parathyroid hyperplasia that ensues is initially
diffuse and polyclonal, and still responds to vitamin D therapy
and cinacalcet. However, with time, there is down regulation
of vitamin d receptors and calcium-sensing receptors in the
parathyroid tissue, and hyperplasia often becomes monoclonal
or nodular in nature (83). In such patients, PTH synthesis
and secretion become autonomous with minimal response to
therapeutic agents and is often associated with hypercalcemia.
When measured by ultrasound, diffuse polyclonal hyperplastic
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 211

Vangala et al. Mineral and Bone Disorders After Kidney Transplantation
glands are significantly smaller than nodular monoclonal glands
(84).
With successful transplantation and higher GFR, most of these
stimuli of parathyroid hyperplasia abate. This often leads to a
gradual decline in PTH concentrations. Unlike FGF-23 levels that
precipitously decline post-transplant, the fall in PTH is more
gradual. It has been reported that 25 to >80% of patients still have
inappropriately high PTH beyond 1-year post transplant (37,
85, 86). Pre-transplant cinacalcet use, development of nodular
hyperplasia, and dialysis vintage are associated with high PTH
levels after transplant (87), while use of vitamin D pre-transplant
appears to be protective.
Renal Osteodystrophy
Progressive kidney disease commonly results in the spectrum
of bone diseases known as renal osteodystrophy. How this
collection of bone diseases evolves in the post-transplant period
is unclear due to the lack of available bone biopsies. This paucity
of histological evidence hampers our ability to understand the
evolution of osteodystrophy post-transplantation. As in the pretransplant period, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with
severe cases of osteomalacia in KTRs. In a small study of 20
subjects, adynamic bone disease was the predominant pathology
prior to transplant, and low-turnover disease persisted 6 months
after transplant. The relative decrease in PTH secretion as a result
of improved phosphaturia may be the reason for these early
findings. However, as allograft function deteriorates over time,
high-turnover disease, such as osteitis fibrosa cystica, becomes
more common (88).
Osteopenia and Osteoporosis
Osteopenia and osteoporosis are conditions highlighted by
microarchitectural changes that result in reduced bone mass and
increased skeletal fragility. As in the general population, age, race,
ethnicity, weight, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, and menopausal
status influence osteoporotic risk. With aging, an imbalance
in bone remodeling results from increased osteoclast activity
and reduced osteoblast production and differentiation. After
transplantation, several other factors including residual MBD,
glucocorticoids, hypomagnesemia, and hypogonadism play a role
in bone loss.
Transplant medications modify osteoprotegerin and the
receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL),
potent mediators of the bone remodeling process. Through
regulation of the RANKL system, glucocorticoids decrease
osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, while promoting
osteoclastogenesis (89–91). Additionally, they decrease intestinal
calcium absorption and increase urinary calcium loss (92). The
rate of bone loss is greatest in the first 3–6 months of steroid
use when assessed by bone mineral density (BMD) (93). Even
when these reductions in bone mass are not evident, low dose
glucocorticoid use is still associated with reduced bone strength
(89). Microarchitectural changes through increased death of
osteocytes are evident regardless of bone volume. In the era
of reduced rejection with tacrolimus, strategies to minimize
steroid exposure in low immunologic risk recipients can limit
glucocorticoid-induced bone loss. However, both tacrolimus and
sirolimus can increase osteoblast apoptosis (94).
Hypomagnesemia, possibly by stimulating PTH secretion
and osteoclastogenesis while inhibiting osteoblast proliferation,
increases fracture risk in dialysis patients (95). Magnesium
deficiency is a common complication for KTRs and is often
related to medications, including calcineurin inhibitors, proton
pump inhibitors, and pentamidine. However, there are no studies
to show an independent association between hypomagnesemia
and fracture risk in KTRs.
Gonadal hormones play a significant role in achieving peak
bone mass, and hypogonadism is associated with bone loss and
low BMD. Around 40% of ESRD patients have testosterone
deficiency, (96, 97) and sex hormone production can improve
significantly within the first 3 months post-transplantation in
patients younger than 50 years old (97). Despite resolution of
uremia, persistence or development of other chronic diseases and
chronic use of glucocorticoids may decrease gonadal hormones
in KTRs and promote bone loss.
Other risk factors include poor nutritional status, tobacco use,
and alcohol use. Recently, proton pump inhibitors have been
associated with hip fractures among KTRs (98). While many
mechanisms have been theorized, reduced cation absorption
appears to be the leading hypothesis for this mechanism of
increased risk.
Osteonecrosis
Osteonecrosis or avascular bone necrosis, a pathological
condition characterized by bone death, has a strong
association with glucocorticoid use. Prevalence has been
reported to be between 3-40% in different studies (99, 100).
However, with introduction of calcineurin inhibitors and
consequent reduction in steroid doses, the incidence of
osteonecrosis has declined significantly (101). While the
exact pathogenesis remains unclear, possible mechanisms
include steroid-induced decrease in vascular endothelial
growth factor, alterations in circulating lipids with resultant
fat emboli, increased apoptosis of osteoblasts, osteocytes and
endothelial cells, adipogenesis, procoagulant state, modulation
of vasoactive mediators, and elevated intraosseous pressure,
which eventually lead to ischemia and necrosis (102). The
hips, knees, and shoulders are the most commonly affected
sites.
Prevention, early diagnosis, and slowing the progression of
osteonecrosis is key, as there is no proven therapy, especially
for advanced disease. This includes limiting steroid use, and
avoiding other risk factors, including alcohol use and smoking.
Surgical options for symptomatic patients with progressive
early stage osteonecrosis include core decompression,
osteotomy, and bone grafting. When bone collapse has
already occurred, hemiarthroplasty or total-hip arthroplasty
may be offered. Recently, surgeons have considered combining
core decompression with stem cell-based (implantation of
autologous bone marrow concentrate or mesenchymal stem
cell) and growth factor-based (bone morphogenic proteins,
vascular endothelial growth factor) regenerative therapies
(103).

EVALUATION OF MBD POST-TRANSPLANT
Biochemical Assessment
Biochemical abnormalities of disordered mineral metabolism are
common and fluctuate widely, especially in the immediate postkidney transplant period. Hypophosphatemia occurs early after
kidney transplantation. Initial hypocalcemia could be followed by
hypercalcemia, and in some patients, hypercalcemia could persist
beyond 1-year post-transplantation. Therefore, the KDIGO
2017 guideline update recommends that serum calcium and
phosphorus levels be measured at least weekly in the immediate
post-kidney transplant period until stable (graded 1B) (104).
After the immediate post-kidney transplant period, the frequency
of monitoring serum calcium and phosphorus levels can be based
on the rate of progression of CKD, the presence and magnitude
of abnormalities, and whether the patient is receiving treatments
for CKD-MBD (not graded). As shown in Table 2, recommended
monitoring intervals include: (1) every 6–12 months in CKD
stages 1-3T; (2) every 3–6 months in CKD stage 4T; and (3) every
1–3 months in CKD stage 5T.
Considering the high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism
and vitamin D deficiency in KTRs, serum 25(OH)D and
PTH levels are commonly measured after transplantation.
The KDIGO 2017 guideline update suggests that a baseline
25(OH)D level might be measured in the immediate posttransplant period, and repeated testing should be determined
by baseline values and interventions (105). It also recommends
measuring a baseline PTH level in the immediate posttransplant period and subsequent monitoring be based on the
rate of progression of CKD, baseline level, and whether the
patient is receiving treatments for CKD-MBD (not graded).
Recommended monitoring intervals include: (1) variable in CKD
stages 1-3T, depending on baseline level and CKD progression;
(2) every 6–12 months in CKD stage 4T; and (3) every 3–
6 months in CKD stage 5T (104, 105). However, there is
no recommendation as to what acceptable PTH levels are
post-transplant and when intervention is needed. Presumably,
the skeletal resistance to PTH is removed with new-found
kidney function and loss of uremic toxins, suggesting that levels
should substantially reduce or approach the normal range. With
poor predictive value and variable degrees of graft function,
PTH levels often do not correlate well with bone turnover.
Additionally, the levels that are deemed “appropriate” must be
individualized to the degree of graft function. Until more specific
bone turnover markers that are independent of kidney function
can be introduced into regular practice, confidence in treatment
exists in the most extreme trends in PTH levels.
EVALUATING FRACTURE RISK
Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry Bone
Mineral Density (DXA BMD)
The use of DXA to predict fracture risk in KTRs remains
a challenge. Limitations include: (1) inability to distinguish
between cortical and trabecular bone, which are differentially
affected in secondary hyperparathyroidism; (2) confounding
signals from concomitant vascular calcification; and (3)
observations that glucocorticoid-induced fractures occur at
higher BMD values than in patients with non-glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis (106). However, a recent study showed
that KTRs with hip bone osteopenia (HR 2.7; 95% CI 1.6–4.6)
and osteoporosis (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.8–6.4) noted on DXA
have an increased risk of fracture; the predictive value of DXA
BMD results in the lumbar spine was much less certain (107).
Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis and several prospective
studies in adults with CKD G3a to G5D stages showed that DXA
BMD, especially at the total hip region, predicts fractures across
the spectrum of CKD (108–111). Based on these data, KDIGO
guidelines 2017 update recommends BMD testing in patients
with CKD G1T-G5T with risk factors for osteoporosis, if results
will alter therapy (grade 2C) (105). With the overwhelming

Vangala et al. Mineral and Bone Disorders After Kidney Transplantation
majority of KTRs having additional risk factors (steroid use, age,
diabetes, etc.) for osteoporosis, screening DXA scans are ordered
at months 3 and 15 at our institution.
Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX)
The World Health Organization’s FRAX Tool is used commonly
in the general population to predict the 10-year probability of a
major osteoporotic fracture. It utilizes an algorithm that includes
age, sex, and several clinical risk factors for fracture, including
parental hip fracture, previous fragility fracture, rheumatoid
arthritis, current smoking, secondary osteoporosis, low body
mass index (BMI < 19 kg/m2), prolonged glucocorticoid use,
and excessive alcohol intake. The FRAX score does not require
bone densitometry data to predict fracture risk, making it
an attractive clinical tool. However, the etiology of transplant
bone disease is multifactorial, and pathology is widely variable.
Therefore, factors in the FRAX algorithm that are associated with
fracture risk in the general population may not accurately predict
fractures in KTRs.
Recently, two Canadian studies assessed the prognostic value
of FRAX in KTRs and patients with reduced kidney function
(112, 113). In a single-center, retrospective cohort study of
458 KTRs who were followed for a mean of 6.4 years, the
observed 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk of 6.3% was
concordant with FRAX predictions (5.0% with BMD, 5.6%
without BMD). Furthermore, FRAX showed modest fracture
prediction and discrimination similar to general population
(112). The other multicenter, prospective observational study
showed that in patients with CKD stages 3-5 (eGFR < 60
ml/min/1.73 m2) FRAX was able to accurately predict fracture
risk; however, only 4.0% had CKD stage 4 or 5. Moreover, FRAX
major osteoporotic fracture discrimination in individuals with
eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 was similar to those with eGFR
≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2(113). While these studies show promise,
additional validation is needed before FRAX can be used to guide
treatment decisions in KTRs.
Evaluation/Imaging Beyond DXA
In KTRs, particularly those with reduced kidney function,
the presence of renal osteodystrophy complicates our
understanding of bone disease. Bone pathology varies between
low-turnover, high-turnover, and mixed states. Consequently,
2-dimensional measurements of bone density often provide
limited understanding of bone disease, missing measures of
quality and strength. Glucocorticoid-induced fractures occurring
at relatively higher BMD values (106), substantiates a need for
measurements beyond density in KTRs.
High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
tomography provides a mechanism for understanding density
and microarchitecture of cortical and trabecular regions
separately (114). In particular, cortical porosity may be used as a
measure of estimated bone strength. Methods for distinguishing
trabecular and cortical compartments are not definitive or
standardized. Peripheral examination also ignores the two most
common osteoporotic fracture sites: proximal femur and spine.
Bone architecture associated with kidney disease is not uniform
and radial evaluation may not reflect the turnover, density, and
strength present at the hip. Currently, this technology largely
exists for research purposes, as the above barriers, along with
cost, must be overcome before broader clinical application
materializes.
A novel parameter for describing microarchitecture,
trabecular bone score, may provide a potential method for
examining bone quality and strength through gray-scale
variograms of the spine image available from a DXA (115).
In KTRs, trabecular bone scores are associated with fractures
independent of a Fracture Risk Assessment score including
BMD (116). These scores were also predictive of worsening
trabecular microarchitecture and failure load as measured by
high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography
(117) and have already been incorporated into the World Health
Organizations FRAX tool. This additional assessment should
warrant more attention given its simplicity and accessibility.
Bone Biopsy
Bone biopsy is an informative diagnostic procedure to evaluate
bone abnormalities in patients with kidney disease. To
interpret bone biopsy results better, TMV classification was
developed using three histologic descriptors assessed by bone
histomorphometry; bone turnover (T), mineralization (M) and
volume (V). While mineralization is classified as normal or
abnormal, turnover and volume can be classified as low, normal
or high.
Common bone histopathologic descriptions in ESRD patients
include normal bone, osteitis fibrosa cystica, mixed uremic
osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, and adynamic bone disease.
Compared to older studies that showed higher prevalence of
mixed uremic osteodystrophy in KTRs (118), recent studies have
shown that osteitis fibrosa is more common (88). However,
in a more recent study, bone turnover was normal and bone
mineralization was delayed in the majority of patients (119).
Typically after kidney transplantation, uremia-related
bone changes improve rapidly, even though changes of
hyperparathyroidism can take more than a year to improve
(120). Dynamic parameters tend to improve in patients with
adynamic bone. But in most patients, there is a slight increase
in osteoclast function, decrease in osteoblast function, and
retardation of dynamic parameters (118). High turnover bone
disease improves after transplantation, and low turnover bone
disease may emerge (121). During long-term follow up, bone
alterations observed consist of a mixed bone disease with features
of high bone turnover coexisting with altered bone formation
and delayed mineralization (3). The rate of bone formation
decreases along with significant lengthening of bone formation
period, resulting in reduced amount of bone replaced during a
remodeling cycle (122).
Old age, time on dialysis, and time after transplant are
significant predictors for negative effect on bone mass (118).
Male gender is also a significant predictor, but serum testosterone
level does not predict densitometric or histomorphometric
variables (123). Among transplant medications, steroids and
cyclosporine are associated with osteoclast stimulation and
osteoblast suppression and retardation of mineral apposition and
bone formation rates (124).
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 211

Vangala et al. Mineral and Bone Disorders After Kidney Transplantation
Despite the presence of standardized classification,
interpretation of existing literature is difficult. First, only
recent studies have used the TMV classification. Second, there
was significant variation when bone biopsy was performed after
transplantation, making it difficult to interpret. Third, there has
been a significant change in immunosuppressive medications
over the years, including recent steroid sparing protocols,
making it difficult to compare new and old studies. Lastly, since
bone biopsy is invasive, most patients had only one biopsy
and there is limited data on follow up and evolution of bone
histology.
While bone biopsy provides the most direct information
regarding bone health, it’s relevance is not generalizable to
every region. Femoral, lumbar, and radial pathology can be
substantially different. More importantly, due to substantial
discomfort associated with the procedure, bone biopsies have
fallen out of favor. Our institution does not utilize bone biopsy
as part of clinical evaluation for the above reasons.
TREATMENT
Treatment of MBD post-transplant often requires a holistic
approach with ultimate focus on bone health, instead of focusing
on individual lab abnormalities. Also, it is important to note
that metabolic and bone changes after transplantation tend to be
dynamic and a cookie-cutter approach may not be appropriate
for all patients.
Phosphorus, Calcium, and Vitamin D
Replacements
Phosphate Supplementation
Due to ongoing urinary losses in the immediate post-transplant
period, it is often difficult to achieve and maintain normal serum
phosphate levels with oral replacements. Oral supplements (oral
sodium-potassium phosphate tablet and powder) are started
when serum phosphate level is <2 mg/dL with a goal to
maintain serum level around 2 mg/dL. It is recommended
not to elevate serum level to normal range for fear of
exacerbating hyperparathyroid state. There is also concern
of nephrocalcinosis with aggressive replacement, especially in
the presence of hyperparathyroidism, simultaneous use of
cinacalcet, and oral alkali. Each 250 mg tablet contains around
8 mmol of phosphate. Neutral phosphate salt supplementation,
in addition to correcting hypophosphatemia, has been shown
to increase muscle ATP and phosphodiester content without
affecting other mineral metabolism and has been shown to
improve renal acid excretion (125). In addition to pharmacologic
supplementation, we recommend high phosphorus containing
diets. We recommend patients to liberalize intake of skim milk
every day and other dairy products; 480 mL of skim milk contains
15 mmol of phosphate. If skim milk cannot be tolerated, a less
favorable alternative would be temporary intake of diet cola
drinks.
Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation
While most patients with mild hypocalcemia can be managed
with oral calcium supplements, patients with hungry-bone
disease and severe hypocalcemia need high-dose activated
vitamin D such as calcitriol or paricalcitol, along with
parenteral calcium infusions followed by high-dose oral
calcium supplements. We recommend the use of calcium
and cholecalciferol in all kidney transplant patients with
normal serum calcium. Especially when steroids are given,
administration of vitamin D improves GI calcium absorption.
In the absence of randomized trials, the dose and choice of
vitamin D is quite variable across transplant centers. Most agree
the use of adequate dose of vitamin D to correct vitamin D
deficiency and maintain serum 25(OH)D level of >30 ng/mL.
The KDIGO 2009 guidelines suggest Vitamin D deficiency
should be corrected as recommended for the general population
(graded 2C) (104). If the patient develops hypercalcemia, vitamin
D supplementation should be discontinued until serum calcium
normalizes.
Active vitamin D supplementation has been used successfully
to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in KTRs in much the
same way that it is utilized in patients with CKD. In fact,
paricalcitol, whether given intravenously or orally, has even been
shown to be more effective than cinacalcet in reaching goal PTH
and reducing markers of bone turnover (126). Both the use of
calcitriol and paricalcitol have resulted in improved BMD while
reduced markers of inflammation have been found among KTRs
that are administered paricalcitol (127, 128). Paricalcitol has also
demonstrated variable results regarding proteinuria reduction in
KTRs (128, 129) and has been touted as having an anti-fibrotic
advantage over calcitriol in mice studies (127). Despite these
benefits, active vitamin D supplementation results in relative
increases in FGF-23, the downstream effects of which are still not
completely understood.
Cinacalcet
In KTRs with hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia,
cinacalcet reduces PTH levels and as a result, improves serum
calcium (130–133) and serum phosphate levels (134–136).
Regression of parathyroid hyperplasia has been documented
(137). Some studies have shown improvement in bone mineral
density, especially at the hip level (138, 139). However,
these potential benefits must be balanced by the commonly
encountered gastrointestinal intolerance and higher urinary
fractional excretion of calcium and hypercalciuria (140–144).
In fact, reports of allograft nephrocalcinosis (145, 146) and
consequent graft failure have been reported. Despite this risk,
studies demonstrating no change in allograft function with
long-term use of cinacalcet exist (134–136). Due to cinacalcet’s
effect on renal sodium handling, some studies have shown
improvement in blood pressure (141, 147). However, there are
no randomized controlled trials that have shown improvement
in patient survival, much less fractures.
There may be drug-drug interaction between cinacalcet
and tacrolimus; when given together, cinacalcet may reduce
tacrolimus concentration (148, 149). While the exact mechanism
is unclear (150), it is prudent to monitor tacrolimus levels when
cinacalcet is started. This is especially important in sensitized
patients who are at high risk for acute rejection. Cinacalcet does
not seem to interfere with pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 211

Vangala et al. Mineral and Bone Disorders After Kidney Transplantation
or mycophenolate (149). It is also important to note that coadministration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., protease
inhibitors, itraconazole, diltiazem etc.) may increase serum levels
of cinacalcet since the drug is partially metabolized by that
pathway. Serum calcium should be closely monitored in such
patients. In addition, cinacalcet is also a potent inhibitor of
CYP2D6 pathway. When cinacalcet is combined with other
potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 pathway like SSRI antidepressants
(fluoxetine, paroxetine), inhibition of this metabolic pathway
can be profound. In such patients, doses of medications that
are metabolized by CYP2D6 pathway (metoprolol, carvedilol,
tricyclic antidepressants, flecainide etc.) should be adjusted to
avoid toxicity.
In the post-transplant setting, cinacalcet is primarily used for
the management of severe hypercalcemia associated with tertiary
hyperparathyroidism. Since cinacalcet is not FDA approved
in KTRs, most programs use the drug only in patients with
refractory and severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium
>11 mg/dL). There are no clear guidelines for the use of this drug.
Thus, while the benefit for serum calcium reduction and perhaps
BMD improvement is evident in tertiary hyperparathyroidism,
its utility in persistent hyperparathyroidism without
hypercalcemia or de novo hyperparathyroidism is less certain.
With unclear targets, particularly as graft function worsens,
one risks over-suppression and potential adynamic bone
disease.
Anti-Resorptive Agents: Bisphosphonates
Bisphosphonates are the most commonly used anti-resorptive
medication in the general population. However, among KTRs,
bisphosphonates have largely demonstrated improvements in
BMD without notable changes in fracture risk. Kan et al.
conducted a systematic review that noted an improvement
solely in lumbar spine BMD (151), while the review performed
by Toth-Manikowski et al. demonstrated an association with
improved lumbar spine BMD, as well as femoral BMD (152).
Unfortunately, proof of improvement in clinical events is lacking
from these reviews and trials. Coco and colleagues reported
improvements in vertebral BMD, and not hip BMD, among
pamidronate recipients, and the limited numbers that received
bone biopsies demonstrated a significantly higher number of
adynamic bone disease among pamidronate recipients. Thus, this
initial improvement in bone volume with bisphosphonates may
still portend a substantial fracture risk given the trade-off in bone
quality (153). With a very low level of evidence, the KDIGO
guideline on transplant suggests considering bisphosphonate
treatment within the first 12 months of transplant (154). In
particular, the guideline highlights the utility of bone biopsy
if considering bisphosphonate therapy. However, excluding
adynamic bone disease with this antiquated procedure is not
feasible in most transplant centers. Thus, care is reduced to
estimating bone turnover rate in conjunction with BMD to
determine the utility of bisphosphonates. If the risk of adynamic
bone disease can be eliminated with elevated markers of bone
turnover such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, KTRs
with high risk and reduced BMD should be considered for
bisphosphonate therapy.
After the first-year post-transplant, insufficient evidence exists
to guide whether bisphosphonate therapy should be continued.
KTRs should be re-evaluated in terms of their glucocorticoid dose
and repeat DXA. Long-term studies examining clinical events
are needed to fully understand the utility of bisphosphonate.
Additionally, research is needed to understand the utility
of alternative therapy in patients with reduced BMD and
without overt laboratory evidence of increased bone turnover.
More specifically, an alternative anti-resorptive medication,
teriparatide, a PTH analogue, may have a role in adynamic bone
disease, which is characterized by PTH resistance and relative
PTH deficiency.
Denosumab, a RANKL inhibitor presents an attractive
alternative, particularly in patients with low GFR. These
patients require close monitoring for hypocalcemia. Much
like bisphosphonate use, BMD parameters seem to improve,
but no evidence exists for changes in fracture risk (155).
Teriparatide has been successfully used to improve BMD
in patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis
(156). Studies among KTRs are limited by size and have
not yielded demonstrable changes in BMD (157). At
our institution, when patients present with substantially
reduced BMD and elevated markers of bone turnover,
we collaborate with colleagues in endocrinology and
frequently employ denosumab with concomitant vitamin D
therapy.
Parathyroidectomy
With the advent and expanded therapeutic use of cinacalcet
in KTRs, the role of parathyroidectomy (PTX) in tertiary
hyperparathyroidism has evolved. In current practice, PTX is
limited to KTRs with profoundly elevated parathyroid hormone
and calcium levels, symptomatic disease (fractures, EKG changes,
neurologic sequalae, etc.) or failure of long-term medical
management (158, 159).
When compared with cinacalcet, a greater percentage of KTRs
who underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy had normocalcemia,
normal PTH levels, and increased femoral neck bone mineral
density at 1 year (160). However, the applicability of data
is limited by the small sample size, lack of long-term
analysis and the patterns of cinacalcet dose adjustments in
the study population (161). Further, in clinical practice, the
choice of intervention is undoubtedly influenced by multiple
factors, including patient preference, patient suitability as an
operative candidate, access to therapy, and potential financial
costs.
The optimal timing and choice of surgery for tertiary
hyperparathyroidism is often debated. Reduced all-cause and
cardiovascular mortality is seen among patients with CKD
and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, and presumably
pre-transplant surgery offers this benefit among KTRs (162).
Among patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, the
inability to determine which glands will involute with new-found
kidney function and medical therapy clouds the determination
of pre-transplant PTX utility. Consequently, we are reliant on
PTH levels and nuclear imaging. As previously mentioned,
larger, more nodular glands are likely to be monoclonal
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 211

Vangala et al. Mineral and Bone Disorders After Kidney Transplantation
and therefore have persistent secretion post-transplant.
The optimal level at which PTX confers an advantage in
secondary hyperparathyroidism remain unclear. A large
retrospective examination of the SRTR of 11,776 patients
did not show any association between pre-transplant PTH
values greater than 800 pg/mL and graft failure, delayed
graft failure, or acute rejection (163). On the other hand, a
more recent retrospective study of 913 patients at a single
center that underwent kidney transplantation concluded
that levels greater than 6 times normal were associated with
graft failure, and pre-transplant PTX decreased the risk of
allograft failure (164). Thus, we believe that pre-transplant
PTX should be determined on a case by case basis. Extreme
values with evidence of nodularity and significantly increased
size may warrant surgical intervention prior to transplant
to prevent further complications in the post-transplant
period.
Even though high PTH levels (>500 pg/mL) and serum
calcium level (>9.5 mg/dL) are risk factors for needed
PTX post-transplant, enough time should be given for
spontaneous regression of gland hyperplasia if surgery is
planned post-transplant. Post-transplant PTH levels appear to
fall rapidly in functional allografts 3-6 months post-operatively,
and then follow a more gradual decline that plateaus at 1
year (158, 159). It follows then that referral for operative
intervention for persistent disease should be delayed at least
3 months, but not extend past 1 year due to cumulative risk
of cardiac, bone and graft complications associated with high
PTH and calcium levels (158). Data regarding the effect of
parathyroidectomy on renal allograft function is conflicting, with
some studies suggesting decreasing function post intervention,
while others found no significant long-term difference
(44, 158, 165).
The choice of operation has evolved over time. Classic
approaches included subtotal or total PTX with auto
transplantation (45, 158). Current reports suggest a less extreme
approach, including less-than-subtotal parathyroidectomy,
may achieve similar therapeutic goals (158, 166). Known
complications following PTX include recurrent laryngeal nerve
injury (2%), wound bleeding (0.3%), and transient symptomatic
hypocalcemia (20–85%).
CONCLUSIONS
The risk of bone disease and its complications vary throughout
the post-transplant timeline. Appreciating the residual
maladaptive responses found in end-stage kidney disease
and the new onset risks that accompany transplant are key to
perioperative management. As most MBD parameters begin
to normalize with time, subtle aspects of evaluation must be
appreciated to reduce the development of bone pathology.
Clinicians encounter a different spectrum of MBD abnormalities
including hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and persistent
hyperparathyroidism. Reversal of MBD abnormalities and
vitamin D deficiency is the focus of initial management of
KTRs. Parathyroidectomy is reserved for patients with tertiary
hyperparathyroidism who fail medical treatment. Later in
the post-transplant period, clinicians should aim to mitigate
age-related bone disease. While bisphosphonates demonstrate
improvements in bone mineral density, no evidence exists for
impacting fracture risk and more novel therapies require further
study.
Limitations to evaluation center around the poor predictive
value of laboratory measures, imaging, and clinical tools. PTH
values are idiosyncratic in their influence by graft function
and pre-existing nodular hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland.
The addition of trabecular bone score may be able to capture
measures of bone quality and strength that are missing from DXA
scans alone. The FRAX tool shows early promise in its prediction
of fractures among KTRs.
The heterogeneity of KTRs and competing influences make
studying therapies directed at MBD particularly challenging.
Additionally, the latent period before detectable clinical events,
such as fractures, is lengthy. With more detailed and specific
surrogate markers, investigators will be able to generate
feasible studies with increased clinical relevance.
