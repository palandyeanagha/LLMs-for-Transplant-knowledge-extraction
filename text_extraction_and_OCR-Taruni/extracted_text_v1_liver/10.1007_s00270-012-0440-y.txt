Abstract
Purpose This is a review of literature on the indications,
technique, and outcome of portal vein embolization (PVE).
Methods A systematic literature search on outcome of
PVE from 1990 to 2011 was performed in Medline,
Cochrane, and Embase databases.
Results Forty-four articles were selected, including 1,791
patients with a mean age of 61 ± 4.1 years. Overall technical success rate was 99.3 %. The mean hypertrophy rate
of the FRL after PVE was 37.9 ± 0.1 %. In 70 patients
(3.9 %), surgery was not performed because of failure of
PVE (clinical success rate 96.1 %). In 51 patients (2.8 %),
the hypertrophy response was insufficient to perform liver
resection. In the other 17 cases, 12 did not technically
succeed (0.7 %) and 7 caused a complication leading to
unresectability (0.4 %). In 6.1 %, resection was cancelled
because of local tumor progression after PVE. Major
complications were seen in 2.5 %, and the mortality rate
was 0.1 %. A head-to-head comparison shows a negative
effect of liver cirrhosis on hypertrophy response. The use
of n-butyl cyanoacrylate seems to have a greater effect on
hypertrophy, but the difference with other embolization
materials did not reach statistical significance. No difference in regeneration is seen in patients with cholestasis or
chemotherapy.
Conclusions Preoperative PVE has a high technical and
clinical success rate. Liver cirrhosis has a negative effect
on regeneration, but cholestasis and chemotherapy do not
seem to have an influence on the hypertrophy response.
The use of n-butyl cyanoacrylate may result in a greater
hypertrophy response compared with other embolization
materials used.

Introduction
Liver resection is in many cases the only option for longterm survival for patients with primary or secondary liver
malignancies. Unfortunately, only 10–20 % of patients
with colorectal liver metastases are candidates for liver
resection. The resectability rate for hepatocellular carcinoma is approximately 20–30 % in patients with normal
livers but is reduced in patients with cirrhotic livers [1]. In
literature, the postoperative liver failure rate ranges from 0
to 30 % and is still the major cause of death following
major liver resection. When patients prove unresectable
because of insufficient remnant liver volume, portal vein
embolization (PVE) is one of the methods to stimulate
growth of the future remnant liver (FRL), thereby sustaining the possibility of extensive liver resection.
The first to demonstrate the regenerative capacity of the
liver following portal vein occlusion were Rous and Larimore in the 1920s. In a rabbit model, they showed atrophy
of the hepatic lobe ipsilateral to the ligated portal branches,
while compensatory hypertrophy was observed in the
contralateral lobe [2]. In 1961, portal vein ligation was

reported in humans as part of a two-stage extended hepatectomy [3]. Kinoshita et al. [4] reported the first preoperative PVE in a human being in 1986. Since then,
numerous reports have shown the efficacy of inducing
compensatory hypertrophy of the FRL after PVE in preparation for surgery to resect primary or metastatic cancers
in the liver [5–7].
Several techniques for portal vein occlusion have been
reported, including intraoperative portal branch ligation
[8–10], transileocolic PVE [11–13], and the percutaneous
transhepatic ipsilateral [14, 15] or contralateral [16, 17]
PVE technique. The underlying principle is to block the
portal venous blood flow to the liver segments that are
planned to be resected. This induces atrophy of the ipsilateral liver segments and compensatory hypertrophy of the
contralateral liver segments, resulting in increase of the
size of the FRL. In addition to the different techniques,
different embolization materials are used clinically, e.g.,
polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA), coils, gelatin sponge,
n-butyl cyanoacrylate and lipiodol, or fibrin glue.
Many clinical studies have been published on the effects
of PVE on hypertrophy of the FRL in small and larger
patient cohorts. However, only few data have been published on the difference between the use of different
embolization materials and the effect of chemotherapy or
preexisting liver cirrhosis on the growth of the FRL after
PVE.
In 2008, a meta-analysis was published by Abulkhir et al.
which reviewed all publications on PVE between 1990
and 2005. They focused especially on the differences
between various access techniques (transhepatic vs. transileocolic) regarding the ensuing hypertrophy response
and surgical outcome [18]. However, with the growing
availability of radiological intervention suites, during the
past decades, the percutaneous transhepatic technique has
become the standard technique for PVE. In addition, many
new articles on PVE have been published since Abulkhir’s
report.
In this review, we systematically evaluated all publications on PVE in the past 20 years to assess the technical
and clinical results of PVE, with special interest in the
influence of chemotherapy, preexisting liver cirrhosis,
cholestasis, and the use of different embolization materials
on the hypertrophy response.
Materials and Methods
Search Strategy
A systematic literature search was performed in Medline,
Cochrane, and Embase from January 1, 1990 to May 1, 2011.
The applied search heading was: ‘‘portal vein embolization’’
limited to clinical studies, including at least 10 cases, published in the English language. Titles and abstracts were
screened to identify potentially relevant articles. Referred
and related articles also were checked. Articles were selected following the selection criteria and were independently
evaluated by two of the authors (vL, vdE), using a scoring
list. The final selection was made in consensus.
Selection Criteria
All clinical studies on PVE were included for further
analysis. Full-text articles were retrieved and were included
if they contained information on patient characteristics,
indication for PVE, pre- and post-PVE liver volumes or
percentages of the FRL, the technique that was used, time
between PVE and CT/surgery, results, and complications
of PVE, as well as results of liver surgery.
After the initial search, articles were excluded because
they were written in a non-English language, were reports
about portal vein ligation, were animal studies, were articles
concerning chemoembolization, or were review articles.
Furthermore, articles were excluded when patient characteristics, indications, methods, and results were not adequately described or when the FRL data were not sufficient
and could not be extracted from the published data. Articles
that overlapped with previously published data, that were
published by the same author, or overlap with patient
cohorts from the same study group or combined study
groups was suspected were excluded.
Study Quality and Data Extraction
All included studies were evaluated for study quality
characteristics by two reviewers (vL, vdE) independently.
Study quality was assessed using an adapted version of a
checklist of the Dutch Cochrane Centre [19].
The main points of interest included: (1) patient characteristics (number of patients, age, sex, type of liver
tumor, liver fibrosis, chemotherapy); (2) indication for PVE
(minimal percentage FRL based on CT volumetry data or
indocyanine green (ICG) clearance); (3) embolization
technique (transileocolic, transhepatic ipsilateral, transhepatic contralateral) and embolization material used (polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVAc), gelatin sponge, n-butyl
cyanoacrylate, fibrin glue, ethanol, coils, vascular plug, or a
combination); (4) data on CT volumetry; (5) follow-up
(PVE success rate (successful occlusion of the portal vein),
clinical success rate, post-PVE complications and morbidity); and (6) surgical outcome (percentage and type of
resection, postoperative complications and mortality).
Articles were valid and used for data extraction if the
above-mentioned points were described clearly.

Results
The broad initial search using the search heading ‘‘portal
vein embolization’’ resulted in 961 publications. Primary
survey of the abstracts and articles excluded 684 articles
dealing with subjects other than PVE, experimental animal
studies or articles in a non-English language.
After critical evaluation of the remaining full text articles, 84 articles remained for the final scoring, using an
item-list with the minimum requirements for final inclusion. Finally, 44 publications [5, 9, 11, 12, 14–17, 20–55]
were included for meta-analysis (Fig. 1), consisting of
1,791 patients, including 1,139 men (63.6 %) and 617
women (34.5 %). The sex of the remaining 35 patients
could not be extracted from the articles. The mean age was
61 ± 4.1 years. The underlying pathology is summarized
in Table 1.
Indications for PVE
The indication for PVE varied in literature, but the percentage of the FRL was mainly used as the criterion for
PVE. A resection of more than 70–75 % of the total liver
volume in normal livers and more than 60–65 % in compromised livers (i.e., cirrhosis, fibrosis) was mainly the
threshold for performing preoperative PVE in most studies.
Three studies [20–22] used the ICG plasma disappearance
rate or retention rate at 15 min [56]. A 15-min retention
rate of more than 15–20 % in combination with a large
liver resection constituted an indication for PVE.
In the pre-procedural workup computed tomography
(CT) scans were performed to measure the volumes of the
total liver, the part planned to be resected, total tumor
volume, and the FRL. In most studies (30/44, 68.2 %), the
absolute volumes were used to calculate the percentage
FRL [5, 9, 11, 12, 14–17, 23–45, 57].
%FRL ¼ FRLV
TLV  TV

In the other studies (14/44, 31.8 %), the total estimated
volume (TELV) was calculated using CT volumetry in
combination with the body surface area, in the equation:
TELV ¼ ð Þ total liver volume  706:2 body surface
area þ 2:4 as previously described [58] or using the standardized FRL (sFRL), which was calculated by dividing
FRL-V (measured by CT volumetry) by total liver volume
(

by Vauthey et al. [59]:

PVE Technique
PVE is performed by using a transileocolic or transhepatic
approach. The transileocolic approach requires a minilaparotomy or can be performed as part of a two-stage
resection. Using the transhepatic approach, the procedure
can be performed by ipsilateral or contralateral puncture
(Table 2).
The embolization materials mainly used for PVE were
PVA, gelatin sponge, fibrin glue, n-butyl cyanoacrylate with
lipiodol, polidocanol-foam, or combinations of these materials with coils or Amplatzer vascular plugs (Table 3). Gelatin sponge and n-butyl cyanoacrylate, as the primary
embolization-material, were used the most in the evaluated
studies (59.5 %), often in combination with other materials.
Success Rate of PVE Procedure and its Effect
on the Hypertrophy Response
The mean time interval between PVE and the follow-up CT
scan was 25.9 ± 10.1 (range, 14–42) days.

The mean technical success rate of the PVE procedures
was 99.3 % (range, 86.6–100 %). Reasons for failure were
the impossibility of cannulating the portal system [17, 34,
42, 46] because of altered portal anatomy caused by the
tumor mass or unexpected thrombosis of the portal system
due to tumor progression/invasion [17, 25, 46, 47]. The
clinical success rate (successful PVE procedure, inducing
enough hypertrophy of the FRL to allow resection) however was 96.1 %.
In 70 patients (3.9 %), surgery was not performed. In 51
patients (2.8 %), the hypertrophy response was insufficient
to perform the resection, although the embolization procedure was successful. In the other 19 cases, 12 did not
technically succeed (0.7 %) and 7 caused a complication
leading to nonresectability (0.4 %). These complications
consisted of severe cholangitis, large abscesses and sepsis,
and portal venous or mesentericoportal venous thrombosis.
Hypertrophy Response
The growth of the FRL as a result of PVE can be calculated
or expressed in two ways:
The difference in FRL volume before and after embolization in relation to the FRL volume before embolization
(percentage volume increase):
%FRL volume increase ¼ %FRLpostPVE  %FRLprePVE
%FRLprePVE
 100%
The difference between the percentage FRL before and
after embolization (in literature referred to degree of
hypertrophy [DH]):
DH ¼ %FRLpostPVE  %FRLprePVE
when available, the percentage FRL volume increase was
extracted from the article; otherwise, it was calculated from
the available data. The mean increase of the FRL volume
was 37.9 ± 0.1 % (20.5–69.4 %).
Atrophy of the Embolized Lobe
Embolization of the liver not only causes hypertrophy of
the nonembolized lobe but also atrophy of the embolized
lobe. Only 10 studies, including 593 patients, contained all
data on total liver volumes, FRL volumes, and the volumes
of the embolized lobe before and after PVE [16, 24, 25, 34,
36, 45–49]. From these studies, we could calculate the
percentage of atrophy of the embolized liver (EL), using
the following equation:
% atrophy ¼ %ELpostPVE  %ELprePVE
%ELprePVE
 100%
In these studies, the influence of the tumor volume was
not taken into account. The mean percentage of atrophy of
the embolized liver in these studies was -12.3 % (range,
-24.5 to 0.0 %), measured 29 days after PVE (range,
14–42).
Influence of Different Variables on the Hypertrophy
Response
A meta-analysis on the variables influencing the hypertrophy response was not possible because of inhomogeneity of the studies and a limited number of articles within
the subgroups. Insufficient data were available to make a

strong statistical comparison between the effect of right
PVE and additional embolization of segment 4 branches on
the hypertrophy response. The same applies to the effect of
cholestasis. For evaluation of the effect of chemotherapy
and cirrhosis/fibrosis on the hypertrophy response, enough
studies are available for a head-to-head comparison
(Tables 4, 5). Comparing the data, chemotherapy seems to
have no influence on the hypertrophy response; however,
patients with preexisting chronic liver disease (cirrhosis or
fibrosis) show less hypertrophy response than patients with
a normal liver. Statistical significance is not given in these
studies.
Table 6 shows only the studies that used a single
embolization material. There seems to be a trend that the
use of the permanent occluding n-butyl cyanoacrylate
results in a greater % FRL volume increase compared with
gelatin sponge, fibrin glue, and PVA.
Complications After PVE
Fifteen articles lacked a detailed description of complications encountered after embolization [9, 11, 12, 16, 24, 31,
40–43, 49–53]. From the other 29 studies (1,179/1,248
patients), the complication rates are summarized in Table 7.
In 0.4 %, major complications after PVE led to nonresectability of the patient. These complications consisted of
severe cholangitis, large abscesses and sepsis, and portal
venous or mesentericoportal venous thrombosis.
The only study to describe PVE-related mortality was
published by Giraudo et al. [17]. In a group of 146 patients,
1 patient died 20 days after PVE due to lethal pulmonary
embolism. No embolization material was detected in the
lung. A second patient developed cholangitis and died of
septic shock 39 days after PVE. All other studies reported
no PVE-related mortality, resulting in an overall mortality
rate of 0.1 %.
Liver Resection
In total, 20 % (358/1,791) of the originally planned liver
resections after PVE were cancelled. Seven studies (327
patients) lacked a detailed description of the cause of
cancellation. In the other 37 studies (1,464 patients),
18.7 % of the planned resections were cancelled: in 6.1 %
because of local intrahepatic tumor progression or newly
developed metastases in the FRL, making resection
impossible; in 8.1 % because of extrahepatic tumor spread
(peritoneal metastases, mesenteric lymph node metastases,

or lung metastases); and in 4.5 % by other causes (insufficient hypertrophy of FRL despite PVE, complications of
PVE leading to nonresectability, patients refusing further
treatment, preoperative mortality).
The mean period between PVE and liver surgery was
36.9 (range, 21–84) days. The types of operative procedures are summarized in Table 8. In more than 70 %, a
right hemihepatectomy or extended hemihepatectomy was
performed.
Complications after surgery can be divided into major
and minor complications. Major complications are defined
as complications that required surgical treatment and/or
lead to prolonged hospital stay. Minor complications are
defined as complications that could be treated conservatively, not leading to prolonged hospital stay.
In 11 publications, a detailed description of the postoperative complications after resection was lacking [9, 12,
14, 15, 25, 38–41, 46, 54]. In the other 33 articles (1,210
patients), the overall morbidity was 21.7 %. Major and
minor complications are given in Table 9. The overall
mortality after liver resection was 3.3 %. Primary liver
failure (0.4 %) or liver failure in combination with multiple
organ failure (1.2 %) caused death in 50 % of the cases.
Other causes were myocardial infarction (0.1 %), sepsis
(0.2 %), abdominal/liver bleeding (0.2 %), multiple organ
failure (0.4 %), cholangitis (0.1 %), or unknown cause
(0.4 %).
Discussion
Since the first publication on clinical PVE by Kinoshita in
1986 [4], many articles have been published on this subject. The exact mechanisms leading to atrophy of the
embolized lobe and hypertrophy of the FRL are still
unknown. Recent studies have shown that in addition to the
redistribution of portal blood flow PVE induces an increase
in hepatic growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth
factor (TGF)-a and -b, which contribute to the hypertrophy
of the non-embolized lobe [60, 61].
New techniques have been developed, and new embolization materials have been used and tested. The results of
PVE and its role in the management of liver malignancies is
mainly based on small or larger case series; No randomized,
controlled trials on the efficacy of PVE have been conducted. Only one meta-analysis has been published on PVE
[18]. This meta-analysis mainly focused on the differences
between the surgical transileocolic (TIPE) and the percutaneous transhepatic (PTPE) technique, demonstrating a
significantly higher increase in FRL in PTPE than in TIPE.
There were no differences in major complications [18].
However, with the increasing availability of radiological
intervention suites, the percutaneous transhepatic technique
has become the standard technique for PVE. Percutaneous
PVE can be performed by an ipsilateral or contralateral
approach. Using the ipsilateral approach (53.8 % of the
cases in this review) has the advantage of not puncturing the

healthy FRL tissue, thereby reducing the risk of complications like portal vein thrombosis, dissection, or subcapsular hematoma of the FRL. However, reverse-curved
catheters or multiple lumen balloon occlusion catheters are
usually necessary depending on the embolization material
used. Additional embolization of the segment 4 branches
often is easier when using the ipsilateral approach. The
contralateral approach (33.8 %) is easier in catheterization
of the right portal branches and delivering the embolization
material in the direction of the portal flow. This reduces the
chance of migration of embolization material in the portal
branches of the FRL. This review could not extract enough
data to evaluate the differences in complications of the
ipsilateral or contralateral approach. However, studies by
Ribero et al. [51] and Di Stefano et al. [62], which evaluated
complications of the ipsilateral and contralateral approach,
respectively, showed almost the same types of complications and no significant difference in complication rates.
The selection of patients for PVE is based traditionally
on CT volumetry. Most studies use a FRL volume of
25–30 % of the original liver volume as threshold to select
patients for PVE when no compromised liver function is
expected. In patients with a compromised liver function,
such as in postchemotherapy liver damage, liver cirrhosis/
fibrosis, and long-lasting cholestasis, a threshold of
35–40 % is preferred as minimum FRL volume. Worldwide there is consensus on these indications. Functional
information can be obtained by the ICG plasma disappearance or retention rate test at 15 min. This technique,
introduced in 1980, can accurately estimate postresection
remnant liver function [56]. According to the literature,
only few authors, mainly Japanese, have used this method
to select patients for preoperative PVE. More recently
developed quantitative liver function tests, such as
99Tc-labelled mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy HBS
[63] and 99Tc-galactosyl-human serum albumin (GSA)
scintigraphy, could play an important role in a more
accurate selection of patients for PVE.
It is important to calculate the percentage of FRL volume following PVE to ensure that enough functional liver
tissue is left after resection. The importance of the size
of the FRL is stressed by Ribero et al. [51]. They showed
that both a small FRL and limited degree of hypertrophy
(DH) are strongly associated with postoperative hepatic
dysfunction. The percentage of FRL volume can be calculated by using the absolute volumes by CT volumetry or
by relating FRL volume (measured by CT volumetry) to a
standardized liver volume based on BSA [58, 59]. Monitoring FRL function after PVE is difficult, because only a
few liver function tests can measure the specific increase of
the FRL. 99Tc-labelled mebrofenin HBS with single photon
emission tomography (SPECT) [63] and 99Tc-GSA
scintigraphy can be used for this purpose [50, 64, 65].
De Graaf et al. showed that the increase of FRL function
exceeded the increase of FRL volume, suggesting that the
necessary waiting time until resection could be shorter than
indicated by volumetric parameters only.
There is no consensus regarding the optimal waiting
time between PVE and liver resection. We found a wide
range of time intervals between PVE and the follow-up CT
scan: 14–42 days (mean, 25.9 ± 10.1 days). A longer time
interval allows extra growth of the FRL. However, volumetric data presented by Ribero et al. [51] show that after
the initial hypertrophy in the first 3 weeks, a plateau phase is
reached. This is confirmed in the study by Nagino et al. [15].
Additionally, there is the issue of induction of tumor
growth by PVE. Clinical studies demonstrate that tumor
progression after PVE is possible in both the embolized
and nonembolized liver segments. However, so far, accurate data regarding the risk of tumor progression after PVE
are currently not available [66]. In this study 6.1 % of
planned liver resections are cancelled because of local
intrahepatic tumor progression after PVE. This can be
regarded as complication of the treatment, causing irresectability. A direct causality seems obvious and is
described in literature but is not yet proven. An additional
8.1 % of the resections are cancelled because of extrahepatic tumor spread (peritoneal metastases and distant
metastases). To restrict tumor growth, the time between
PVE and liver resection should be limited. Furthermore,
sequential transarterial chemoembolization and PVE can
be performed, particularly in patients with HCC [67] to
limit tumor growth.
Post-PVE chemotherapy is another option in patients
with CRM. Beal et al. reported a reduction in tumor size in
six of the ten patients who had chemotherapy compared
with tumor growth in four of the five patients without
chemotherapy. However, they also observed less hypertrophy of the FRL in patients who received chemotherapy
in the weeks between PVE and resection [25]. Other
studies showed no significant difference in hypertrophy
response or in postoperative complications when chemotherapy was continued [68]. A few large studies evaluated
in this review show no significant difference in increase of
the FRL volume after PVE in patients who previously did
or did not receive chemotherapy [14, 16, 42, 51]. However,
de Baere et al. described a significant lower hypertrophy
response in patients who received chemotherapy with
platin agents. Restricted by the limited number of articles
and their inhomogeneity, evaluation was only possible by
head-to-head comparison.
The same applies to the effect of preexisting liver
damage (liver cirrhosis and fibrosis) on hypertrophy
response after PVE. Comparison of relevant studies show
K. P. van Lienden et al.: Portal Vein Embolization, a Systematic Review 31
123

an impaired hypertrophy response compared with normal
livers; however, statistical significance has not been demonstrated. Farges et al. [31] stated that patients with cirrhotic livers and a normal hypertrophy response had less
postoperative complications. On the other hand, failure of
increase of the FRL could be considered an indicator of
inability of regeneration of liver parenchyma and liver
resection should be avoided.
Many different embolization materials have been
applied for PVE. The combination of n-butyl cyanoacrylate
and lipiodol and the combination of PVA particles with
coils are mostly used. Both are nonabsorbable materials,
which lead to persistent occlusion of the portal branches,
preventing peripheral recanalization. Because gelatin
sponge is absorbable, portal recanalization is frequently
seen, sometimes 2 weeks after PVE [6, 69]. PVA particles
are easy to use and provide permanent occlusion in the
periphery of the portal venous system. Little inflammatory
reaction of the liver tissue is seen when using PVA. The
use of n-butyl cyanoacrylate requires more experience of
the radiologist, because delivery must be very precise to
prevent embolization of nontargeted branches. Using the
appropriate delivering catheters, procedure time can be
decreased. N-butyl cyanoacrylate induces a strong inflammatory reaction, rendering surgical resection sometimes
technically more difficult [6]. Large clinical studies that
compare the effect of different embolization materials on
the hypertrophy response are lacking. The data in this
review suggest that the use of n-butyl cyanoacrylate results
in a higher % FRL volume increase.
Finally, both the overall technical success of PVE
(99.3 %) and clinical success rate (96.1 %) of PVE are
very high. Only 2.8 % of the patients could not undergo a
liver resection because of insufficient hypertrophy. Suggested reasons for insufficient hypertrophy after successful
PVE are recanalization of the embolized portal branches,
activation of underlying liver disease, and the presence of
major portal hypertension with portosystemic shunting [31].
Only 0.4 % of patients appear unresectable because of
PVE-related complications, such as a large subcapsular
hematoma, portal thrombosis, or biliary or infectious
complications in the FRL after a contralateral procedure.
Overall complication rates are higher, but these complications rarely need treatment and they rarely lead to
unresectability.
Conclusions
Preoperative PVE is an effective method to increase FRL
volume with a high technical and clinical success rate. The
complication rate is low, but local tumor progression after
PVE is an imminent cause of unresectablilty. Preexisting
liver damage due to cirrhosis seems to have a negative
effect on the hypertrophy response. Chemotherapy however
does not seem to have any influence on the hypertrophy
response, except for platin agents. The use of n-butyl cyanoacrylate may result in a greater hypertrophy response
compared with the other embolization materials used.
