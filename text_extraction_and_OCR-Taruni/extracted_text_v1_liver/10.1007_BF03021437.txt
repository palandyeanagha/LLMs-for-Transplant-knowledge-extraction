Purpose: The use of transesophageal echocardiography has increased over the past several years. It is generally considered a 
safe diagnostic and monitoring tool. Whereas complications associated with echocardiographic examination rarely occur, such 
complications must be known to echocardiographers performing these examinations. The purpose of this review is to summarize potential complications associated with transesophageal 
echocardiography.
Sources: A systematic search of the English and French literature was undertaken using PubMed from the National Library 
of Medicine. Relevant articles were obtained from a Medline 
search spanning the years 1975 – 2007, and their reference lists 
were used to retrieve additional articles.
Principal findings: Complications of transesophageal echocardiography are primarily related to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems, and include infection, toxic drug 
reaction, local reaction through contamination of the probe, and 
ultrasound cavitation. Strategies to prevent these complications 
are reviewed.
Conclusion: Whereas transesophageal echocardiography is associated with a low complication rate, the echocardiographer 
must be knowledgeable about the types of complications and 
their predisposing factors, and should be meticulous in preventing their occurrence.

Objectif : Au cours des dernières années, l’utilisation de
l’échocardiographie transoesophagienne a augmenté. Cette modalité est en général considérée comme un outil de diagnostic et
de monitorage sécuritaire. Bien que des complications associées
à un examen échocardiographique ne surviennent que rarement,
il est néanmoins important que les échocardiographistes en soient conscients. L’objectif de ce compte-rendu est de résumer les
complications potentielles associées à l’échocardiographie transoesophagienne.
Sources : Une recherche systématique de la littérature en anglais
et en français a été menée dans la base de données PubMed de la
Bibliothèque nationale de médecine américaine. Les articles pertinents ont été extraits d’une recherche Medline couvrant la période
1975-2007, et leurs listes de références ont été utilisées pour récupérer d’autres articles pertinents.
Constatations principales : Les complications associées à
l’utilisation de l’échocardiographie transoesophagienne sont principalement liées aux systèmes gastro-intestinal, cardiovasculaire et
respiratoire. Elles comprennent l’infection, la réaction toxique au
médicament, la réaction locale en raison d’une contamination de la
sonde, et la cavitation des ultrasons. Les différentes stratégies pour
prévenir ces complications sont passées en revue.
Conclusion : Bien que l’échocardiographie transoesophagienne soit
associée à un faible taux de complications, l’échocardiographiste
doit connaître les différents types de complications ainsi que les
facteurs les prédisposant, et devrait apporter un soin particulier à
les prévenir.

Conclusions
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a very 
useful, semi-invasive diagnostic and monitoring technique. Since the initial work published by Frazin in 
1976,1
 there has been a substantial increase in comprehensive knowledge of cardiovascular anatomic and 
hemodynamic correlations, as well as progress and 
innovation in the technique. Transesophageal echocardiography is presently in widespread use in ambulatory clinics, coronary care units, intensive care units 
(ICUs), and operating rooms. Examinations using 
TEE are considered safe when conducted in a controlled environment by trained operators.2 Information obtained from TEE can have a significant impact 
in cardiac3–9 and non-cardiac surgery,10–12 as well as in 
making decisions in the ICU.11,13,14 Considering the 
widespread application of this technique, it is important to address the issue of safety. In this article, we 
present a comprehensive review of the literature pertaining to TEE complications reported during examinations undertaken in cardiology suites, operating 
rooms, and ICUs. We also suggest strategies aimed at 
the prevention of TEE-related complications.
Literature search strategy
A systematic search of the English and French literature was performed using the database PubMed 
from the National Library of Medicine. Literature was 
searched for the period 1975 to 2007. The bibliography of each article was then reviewed to seek additional references and to produce a detailed reference 
list. The term ‘transesophageal echocardiography’ was 
paired with the following MeSH keywords: ‘adverse 
effects’, ‘complications’, ‘injuries’, ‘safety’, ‘esophagus/hypopharynx injuries’, ‘endoscopy’, ‘intoxication’, and ‘infection/bacteriemia’.
Articles describing experiences with the use of TEE 
were reviewed for reported complications. In addition, 
for completeness, articles reviewing complications in 
relation to upper airway endoscopy were retrieved, 
because the latter procedure is similar to probe insertion with TEE. Additional references from the endoscopy literature were inserted when pertinent to the 
discussion. Using that strategy, 207 references were 
reviewed. A total of 30 reports of patients with perforations and 14 reports of patients with bleeding are 
described in Table I. Complications were reviewed in 
17 adult databases, representing 42,355 patients, and 
one pediatric database of 1,650 patients (Table II). 
Figure 1 summarizes the TEE-related complications.
I- Gastrointestinal complications
Tolerance and airway reflexes
Retching commonly occurs during TEE examination 
in awake subjects, with a reported incidence of 39%.15
In ambulatory TEE procedures, sedation, local anesthesia, and transtracheal block16 can improve patients’ 
tolerance and reduce the severity and duration of retching. Patients experiencing retching complain mostly of 
having a sore throat. During TEE examination, elderly 
patients manifest a reduction of the physiological gag 
reflex as compared to younger subjects.15,17 MalloryWeiss syndrome, which is associated with forceful 
vomiting efforts, has been reported in the endoscopy 
and TEE literature.18,19 In the presence of intractable 
gasping or vomiting, TEE examination should not be 
pursued, and sedation and analgesia plans should be 
re-evaluated. A lack of tolerance to probe placement is 
often the reason for failed esophageal intubation or for 
a premature termination of the procedure in the awake 
state.2,20 Complications associated with forceful retching and gasping create a Valsalva maneuver response, 
the hemodynamic effects of which will be discussed in 
Section II: Cardiovascular system complications. 
Occult gastroesophageal lesions and anatomic variations
Occult gastroesophageal lesions and anatomic changes are risk factors for complications associated with 
TEE probe insertion. Elderly patients are more likely 
to suffer occult esophageal lesions such as diverticula,2,20 arthritic mechanical modification of the cervical 
spine,21,22 hiatal hernia, neoplasms, or inflammatory 
mucosal changes. The evaluation of patients should 
always include specific inquiries related to gastroesophageal symptoms such as dysphagia that could 
reveal an underlying, yet undiagnosed, abnormality.
It is at the level of the cricopharyngeal muscle that 
esophageal intubation most often fails. The prominence of the cricoid muscle can be an obstacle for 
esophageal intubation, as is the presence of cervical

osteophytosis.21 Schatzki’s ring (a diaphragm-like thin 
mucosal ring, usually located at the squamocolumnar junction, with an incidence of 10% in the general 
population) can complicate TEE due to esophageal 
narrowing. This complication can be predicted by dysphagia occurring in about 30% of patients when the 
esophageal diameter is less than 12 mm. Prior cervical 
surgery, such as extensive resection or laryngectomy, 
may also produce an anatomical distortion of the 
region23 requiring special care during probe insertion.
During esophageal intubation, the probe may slide 
repeatedly into a Zenker’s or a Killian-Jamieson diverticulum. The former is located on the posterior pharyngoesophageal wall above the cricopharyngeus.24
The latter originates on the anterolateral wall of the 
proximal cervical esophagus below the cricopharyngeus and lateral to the longitudinal tendon of the 
esophagus. Depending on the size and depth of the 
diverticulum, a variable length of the probe will be 
inserted until resistance is felt. An esophageal diverticulum may easily be perforated during forceful insertion, thus increasing the risk of morbidity. To avoid 
such a risk, several techniques have been reported and 
have documented the safe use of TEE in patients with 
a known diagnosis of Zenker’s diverticulum.25–28
Disorders that can reduce the esophageal lumen and 
complicate TEE include esophageal achalasia (i.e., a 
failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax), 
Barrett’s esophagus, chemical esophagitis, late scleroderma, Chagas disease, and benign as well as malignant esophageal tumours that can erode and bleed.2
Peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux can also cause 
esophageal stricture and erosion that complicate TEE 
examination.29 
Unexpected difficulties have been encountered in 
patients with hiatal hernia.30 A fluid-filled hiatal hernia 
can appear as a thick-walled cystic mass posterior to 
the left atrium.31 Air-fluid level within a hiatal hernia 
can produce ultrasound propagation and shadowing 
of more anterior structures, thus making TEE technically difficult.31 A sliding hiatal hernia is more common than a paraesophageal hernia, but neither is a 
contraindication to TEE. In the sliding hernia, the 
gastroesophageal junction and a portion of the fundus 
of the stomach slide upwards into the thorax. In contrast, in the paraesophageal hernia, only the fundus of

the stomach migrates past the gastroesophageal junction, leaving this junction in its normal location. In 
patients with total or partial gastrectomy, TEE is not 
contraindicated as long as the probe is manipulated 
within the esophagus.32
Normal anatomical variants, such as an aortic 
impression, a large left atrium and left main bronchus, 
or pathological conditions, such as an enlarged heart, 
a mediastinal tumour,33 or esophageal duplication, can 
compress the esophagus, distort its imaging, and complicate esophageal intubation.34 Esophageal vascular 
abnormalities, such as prominent venous plexus or 
varices associated with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, may cause bleeding during TEE; therefore, TEE 
should either not be used at all, or should be used 
with great caution during hepatic transplantation.35 
Cervical instability, due to trauma or to subluxation at the C1 and C2 levels associated with Down’s 
syndrome or severe rheumatoid arthritis, may make 
esophageal intubation difficult because of the need for 
airway management.36 Careless manipulation of the 
cervical spine can induce neurological deficits.

ing to such problems include lack of cooperation or 
the lack of operator experience, accounting for most 
cases (98.5%), as well as anatomical abnormalities, 
accounting for 1.5% of cases.2 Anatomic abnormalities 
producing esophageal intubation failure include a double aortic arch,37 cervical osteophytes21 and decreased 
cervical range of motion,28 swallowing impairment, 
mucosal abnormalities such as prior radiation exposure 
or decreased saliva production,28 prior tracheostomy,38
and an inflated endotracheal balloon. 
Several suggestions have been advanced to overcome 
failed intubation. Deeper sedation and local analgesia 
may provide relief from muscular spasm and improve 
patient cooperation. If resistance at the level of the 
esophagus is not eliminated by a swallowing effort, 
the examination should be aborted, and radiological 
evaluation should be considered in order to rule out 
anatomical obstruction. In Tam’s cohort, for example, 
cervical spondylosis associated with vertebral spurs was 
the most common cause of failed intubation in 16 of 
40 patients.21 With anatomic variants such as cervical 
osteophytes, flexion of the neck may help to overcome 
the obstruction. In intubated and ventilated patients, 
the endotracheal tube balloon cuff can be deflated if 
resistance at the level of the larynx is encountered during probe insertion. In our own experience in such 
situations, we prefer to intubate under direct vision. 
Whereas a nasogastric tube rarely impedes intubation, 
it often leads to sub-optimal image acquisition. Limited mouth opening can also be an obstacle.
Injuries, perforation, laceration and tear of the gastroesophageal tract
Dental trauma,39 jaw subluxation,20,40 tonsillar bleeding, 
erosion, and submucosal hematoma of the pharyngeal 
area22,41 are some of the injuries related to TEE probe 
insertion of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
Esophageal perforation occurs in the abdominal 
(57.3%), intrathoracic (33.3%), and cervical (9.3%) 
portions of the esophagus.42 It can be caused by poor 
patient cooperation, inadequate technical skills, unexpected anatomical characteristics (GI abnormalities, 
extrinsic compression of the esophagus from enlarged 
left atrium,33,43,44 a large calcified lymph node,45 a cervical spur), or mucosal damage (due to motion, local 
ischemia, or pressure and heat by the probe). The 
hypopharynx and upper esophagus are the regions 
most vulnerable to perforation,41 because the esophageal wall has an intrinsic weakness caused by fibres 
crossing from the pharyngeal constrictor and the cricopharyngeal muscles. Neck extension, either with or 
without prominent anterior vertebral osteophytes, can 
increase the risk of perforation at the hypopharynx and 
upper esophageal region by stretching the mucosa and 
muscular fibres. Shearing stress, prolonged flexion of 
the probe tip, and probe mobilization in a locked position may result in esophageal tearing or perforation. 
Such complications have been documented endoscopically.46 Several upper GI injuries related to perioperative TEE were reviewed by Augoustides.47
Factors that can contribute to ischemic esophageal 
wall injury include non-pulsatile flow, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass,48 celiac occlusion,48 distended 
atrium49 and mechanical compression,50 as well as 
excessive heat from the probe. Whereas pressures of 
less than 17 mmHg are not expected to be harmful,51
the TEE probe can sometimes generate pressures of 
up to 60 mmHg, causing compression and injury. In a 
recent series, Lennon52 reported six GI complications, 
where four involved tears or lacerations of the distal 
esophagus or proximal stomach, and two involved 
perforation of gastric cardia. Lacerations of distal 
esophagus can be explained when the probe is placed 
in a deep transgastric view position. Gastric cardia 
would result from either the localization or from the 
probe when obtaining left ventricular short axis views. 
Excessive heat generated by the probe can be rapidly 
transmitted by blood flow, causing thermal injury. To 
prevent such injuries, a sensor in the probe shuts the 
system when the temperature exceeds 40°C. 
Epidemiological studies of GI endoscopy reported a 
0.02% to 0.2% rate of perforation in diagnostic procedures.53 In one series, there were no observed GI perforations in 9,000 endoscopic diagnostic procedures.54
In a comparable study involving 10,049 patients, Daniel2
 reported a 0.02% incidence of bleeding associated 
with blind TEE probe insertion and no esophageal 
perforation. In a cohort of 7,200 patients undergoing TEE for heart surgery, perforation and bleeding 
rates of 0.01% and 0.03%, respectively, were recorded.55 We experienced two esophageal perforations in 
a series of 8,000 patients examined in the operating 
room and ICU (Figure 2). When patients are conscious and sedated for TEE, perforations are evident 
from signs of subcutaneous emphysema, dyspnea, 
and pain. In contrast, under general anesthesia, the 
esophageal intubation is usually performed with ease, 
and the perforation goes unnoticed. Such occult iatrogenic esophageal lesions can result in mediastinitis, 
sepsis, and multisystem organ failure.56–61 Esophageal 
perforation is associated with prolonged hospitalization and with a mortality rate of 20% to 30%62 and, 
therefore, it must be suspected and diagnosed.58 Diagnosis can be confirmed endoscopically or radiologically by computed tomography with contrast upper 
GI barium swallow studies and with chest radiographs

in the upright position. Radiological findings would 
include pneumothorax, pleural effusion, empyema, 
air/fluid levels, mediastinal shifts, and subcutaneous 
emphysema (Figure 2).
Bleeding of the gastroesophageal tract 
Minor mucosal trauma during TEE can result in 
hematemesis or in blood-tinged sputum.63 Early 
bleeding associated with TEE can be seen as spontaneous drainage upon probe removal or as blood flow 
during aspiration from the nasogastric tube. Several 
cases of Mallory-Weiss tear related to intraoperative 
TEE presented with bright red blood coming from 
the nasogastric tube.43,50,64
Late bleeding, that is, more than seven days after 
the procedure, is suggestive of an ulcerative process.65 
Risk factors that can precipitate upper GI bleeding 
due to TEE following cardiac surgery include a previous ulcerative process, vasoactive drug utilization, 
and absence of H2 antagonism in the perioperative 
period.66 Other factors, such as a long cardiac bypass 
period, urgent surgery, re-operation,67 or aspirin use,55
have also been implicated.
Anticoagulants may pose another potential problem. 
However, 107 individuals under full anticoagulation 
regimen (intravenous heparin or oral anticoagulation) 
for thrombotic disease or prosthetic valves displayed no 
increase in upper GI bleeding after TEE examination.40 
In contrast, hemothorax developed following esophageal abrasion by TEE in a patient who subsequently 
received thrombolytic therapy,2 and post TEE supraglottic hematoma requiring tracheostomy occurred in 
a patient taking coumadin.68 It can be surmised that, in 
patients receiving anticoagulants and undergoing nonvisualized TEE, any minor trauma to the larynx, pharynx, or esophagus can result in serious complications.

Changes in esophageal lumen integrity
Intraoperative monitoring of ventricular function by 
TEE exposes the esophageal mucosa to ultrasound 
waves and to pressure for long periods. It is therefore 
important to consider whether this procedure results in 
esophageal injury. Endoscopic evaluation of the esophagus completed on children between four months and 
ten years of age immediately following intraoperative 
TEE disclosed abnormalities in 64% of the patients.69
Abnormalities encountered included erythema (54%), 
edema (24%), hematoma (22%), mucosal erosion 
(14%), and petechiae (4%). Also, mild mucosal injury 
was documented more frequently in patients weighing less than 9 kg. No association of injury with probe 
length in the esophagus or with the duration of its 
use was found, and no long-term feeding or swallowing difficulties attributable to TEE manipulation were 
noted in the children who survived. In a similar study 
performed in nine children aged nine to 16 yr, endoscopy did not result in visible esophageal abnormalities.70 It therefore seems that such lesions occur more 
frequently in smaller children.
No such studies have been reported, thus far, for 
adult subjects undergoing endoscopy during surgery. 
In an experimental study, however, TEE monitoring, 
for up to six hours during cardiac surgery in small monkeys and large dogs, did not lead to any macroscopic or 
microscopic esophageal changes or to thermal injury.71
Injury to solid organs and skin
Two rare cases of splenic laceration were reported after 
TEE monitoring during cardiac surgery.72,73 Such laceration could be explained by deep insertion of the 
probe into the stomach for the purpose of transgastric 
imaging, placing it in close proximity to the spleen. 
Further advancement into the gastric cardia may place 
the probe in direct contact with the spleen,74 thus producing traction on the splenic capsule72 via the gastrosplenic ligament that contains the short gastric vessel. 
Withdrawal of the probe can relieve such traction and 
facilitate hemostasis.74
An incidental complication in a small infant occurred 
when the probe was left flexed in the stomach. It 
resulted in a prominent abdominal lump which was 
inadvertently lacerated during sternal incision.75 These 
case reports emphasize the importance of maintaining an appropriate neutral probe position when not 
recording.
Dysphagia, recurrent laryngeal palsy, and tongue 
injuries
Perioperative TEE is an independent risk factor for 
dysphagia.76 The mechanisms of such dysphagia may 
include local compression from the insertion maneuver 
or from the extent of probe insertion, both of which 
could affect the pharyngoesophageal tissue and/or the 
laryngeal nerve. Laryngeal nerve palsy occurs more 
commonly in female patients77,78 because of a narrower 
laryngeal anatomy in females than in males.77 Adult 
patients undergoing TEE display a 7.8-fold increase 
in postoperative dysphagia.76 Dynamic swallowing 
studies have proven that four percent of adult patients 
exhibit mechanical swallowing dysfunction presenting 
as cough and dysphagia upon extubation after cardiac 
surgery.79 Using barium cineradiography, dysphagia 
was observed in 7.9% of 126 patients undergoing 
intraoperative TEE during cardiac surgery vs 1.8% of 
712 patients who did not undergo TEE.76 Dysphagia was associated with pulmonary aspiration in 90% 
of cases, resulting in greater incidence of tracheotomies and a longer hospital stay. Associated risk factors 
include advanced age (P < 0.001), length of postoperative intubation (P < 0.001), and perioperative TEE 
examination (P < 0.003).79
In pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery, 
the incidence of dysphagia and left side vocal cord 
paralysis was 18% and 8%, respectively.80 Associated 
risk factors were age of less than three years, tracheal 
intubation prior to surgery, operation for a left-sided 
obstructive lesion, and size of the probe in relation 
to patient’s weight.80 As in adults, dysphagia affects 
postoperative recovery and contributes to morbidity.
Patient positioning is another factor associated with 
dysphagia. Cucchiara81 reported two cases of transient 
laryngeal dysfunction after TEE monitoring in neurosurgical patients who had been kept in a sitting position. 
Local effects of the probe, combined with an extreme 
flexion of the head in the sitting position, could contribute to and exacerbate local tissue stretching, resulting 
in dysphagia. Tongue swelling82 and tongue necrosis83
were reported after prolonged TEE placement, probably due to local compression by the TEE probe during 
perioperative monitoring.84 Tongue injury is a rare but 
potentially lethal postoperative complication. 
Probe tip buckling
Probe tip buckling should be suspected when imaging 
is difficult, when inappropriate resistance is felt during probe advancement, removal or mobilization, and 
when the control knobs are fixed.81,85,86 When buckling is encountered, the probe should be advanced 
into the stomach where it can recover its neutral position prior to withdrawal. If the probe is pulled out in 
haste, its distal end can injure the esophagus (Figures 
3 and 4).87
Such buckling is unlikely to occur in conscious 

632	 canadian journal of anesthesia
CAN J ANESTH 55: 9 www.cja-jca.org September, 2008
patients who can swallow or when laryngoscopy is 
undertaken. Chee et al.40 noted only two cases of buckling in 901 conscious and sedated patients. Although a 
rare complication, it is a potentially dangerous technical malfunction. The risk factors associated with buckling are flaccidity of the probe tip, improper insertion 
technique, general anesthesia, and operator inexperience.85,88 Inspection of the probe is mandatory, especially when using aging probes - after more than 300 
examinations.88 With time, steering wires controlling 
the flexion of the probe tip can become elongated, 
leading to insufficient stiffness required for esophageal 
intubation.
Other foreign bodies in the esophagus
The TEE probe in the esophagus sometimes shares 
the same space as other devices, such as a temperature 
probe, transesophageal stethoscope, nasogastric tube, 
and feeding tube. A broken nasal temperature probe 
associated with distal esophageal displacement has 
twice been reported.89,90 An intact esophageal stethoscope was retrieved from a patient’s stomach after 
TEE insertion during aortic valve replacement.91
II- Cardiovascular complications
Esophageal intubation is a stimulating maneuver that 
can induce vagal and sympathetic reflexes such as 
hypertension or hypotension, tachyarrhythmia or bradycardia, but it can also induce angina and myocardial 
ischemia.40,92–95 In a multicentre European study,2
 cardiovascular complications during TEE occurred rarely 
(0.8%) and manifested as arrhythmias, non-sustained 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia (three cases), transient 
atrial fibrillation (three cases), and third degree block 
(one case). Cardiovascular complications increase with 
age, as > 70 vs < 50-yr-old patients have been reported 
to display systemic hypotension 3.5 times more frequently.92 Sedation can be a contributing factor, as it 
can cause vasodilation and hypotension, especially in 
fasting patients, in those who have been receiving antihypertension or other drug treatment, and in those 
with other pre-existing conditions. Hypoxemia is also 
dangerous, as it can induce myocardial ischemia. A 
combination of sedation, catecholamines, and hypoxemia in patients suffering from reduced systolic function has been reported to precipitate heart failure63
or fatal ventricular arrhythmia.96 For these reasons, 
patients with coronary artery disease should be closely 
monitored during TEE, and they should receive prophylactic oxygen supplementation.
Under normal conditions, the contact pressure of the 
probe on the right atrium is less than 10 mmHg51 and, 
therefore, if the patient has a mass in the right atrium, 
the chance of dislodging it during TEE is minimal. 
However, upon the initiation of TEE in conscious 
patients, retching (39% of patients) and coughing 
Figure 3 Difficult insertion of the transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe often results from a lateral insertion, as 
opposed to one from the midline (B-C). If excessive pushing 
occurs (D), the probe could be inserted in a flexed position resulting in buckling (E). With permission from Informa Healthcare 
(Denault et al. 2005).
Figure 4 Buckling of the transesophageal echocardiography
(TEE) probe can result in the inability to withdraw it from the 
esophagus. If this condition is suspected, pushing down the probe 
with distal extension will lead to successful removal of the probe.

commonly occur despite sedation and local anesthesia of the pharynx. The associated Valsalva maneuver 
increases intrathoracic, central venous, and pulmonary 
pressures, and its release results in an abrupt decrease 
of systemic pressure. The pressure variation by the 
Valsalva maneuver, used during echocardiographic 
examination to detect inter-atrial septal defects by its 
enhancement of right-to-left shunt, is thought also 
to cause the mobilization of any intracardiac material present. The extent of such embolization will 
depend on the hemodynamic fluctuations as well as 
on the size, density, and mobility of the mass.97 It has 
been reported that large intrathoracic pressures and 
hemodynamic changes resulting from retching have 
produced fatal pulmonary embolization from a right 
atrial mass,98,99 embolization of mitral vegetation and 
a left intracardiac thrombus resulting in stroke,40,100 a 
myxoma embolus,99 and progressive aortic dissection 
and cardiac tamponade.101
Pediatric patients may be more vulnerable to TEE, 
in that the esophageal probe can significantly compress vascular structures69 such as a normally positioned34 or aberrant right subclavian artery,102,103 the 
descending aorta,104,105 the innominate artery,106 and 
the pulmonary venous confluence in an infant with 
total anomalous pulmonary venous return.107–109 The 
hemodynamic effect of the TEE on cerebral perfusion 
pressure must also be reduced, especially in the presence of elevated intracranial pressure. In all of these 
situations, a strategy must be developed based on preexisting medical conditions.
III- Respiratory complications
As with endoscopic procedures, TEE examinations in 
sedated patients may be associated with a small, but 
significant, reduction of oxygen saturation. During 
endoscopy, the degree of desaturation is usually modest, about 4 to 6%, but desaturations as low as 51% have 
also been reported.110,111 Whereas a mean fall in oxygen 
saturation reached 4.7% (ranging from 1% to 49%) in 
mildly sedated patients undergoing TEE, 18% of the 
patients exhibited significant hypoxemia, as defined 
by a persistent oxygen saturation below 90%.112 Obesity increases the likelihood for oxygen desaturation 
during upper GI endoscopy and for aspiration during 
endoscopy,113,114 although one study did not find any 
difference in transient oxygen desaturation between 
obese (mean body mass index 41 kg·m–2) and nonobese patients undergoing TEE examination.115 When 
performed in the emergency department, TEE may 
cause further complications such as respiratory insufficiency and failure116 (e.g., location-related examination complications). For these reasons, prophylactic 
oxygen supplementation should be administered to 
sedated conscious patients undergoing TEE. Such 
prophylaxis improves, but does not abolish, the oxygen desaturation, and, therefore, it is no substitute for 
diligent oxygen monitoring.
Although pulmonary complications during TEE in 
awake patients are rare, the potential difficulties include 
bronchospasm,2,117 laryngospasm,118 posterior pharyngeal wall hematoma,41 supraglottic hematoma,68 and 
subglottic stenosis.119 Unilateral and bilateral pulmonary edema,21,118,120 atelectasis,121 and airway obstruction122 can also be encountered. Prior oropharyngeal 
dysfunction and sedation enhance the risk for aspiration and call for brief endotracheal intubation under 
the care of an anesthesiologist.
An erroneous insertion of the esophageal tube in 
the trachea has been reported in four out of 1,500 
examinations (0.27%) in ambulatory adults.117 Symptomatically, such occurrences can be recognized by 
shortness of breath, stridor, and incessant coughing,117
however, these symptoms can be masked by sedation. 
With accidental tracheal intubation, image quality is 
poor, the distinction of distal structures is difficult, 
and resistance to probe insertion is perceived at about 
30–32 cm.123–125 Also, the short axis of the aortic valve 
and the pulmonary artery bifurcation will not be seen 
at 30 cm,124 and long axis views of the aortic arch, similar to those obtained from a suprasternal transducer 
position, will display poor distal resolution.124,126
Esophageal tube placement, movement, or removal may alter the placement of an endotracheal tube, 
particularly in the pediatric population, where extubation,75,127 displacement into a large bronchus,75,90
damage to the pilot cuff,128 and a 1–2% incidence of 
severe airway obstruction have been reported.75,129
Airway obstruction by a similar mechanism was also 
reported in two cases of adults undergoing repair of 
aortic aneurisms.130 Even a compression by the esophageal probe of the pulmonary tree or the endotracheal tube can alter ventilation,75,122,129,131–135 especially 
when congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, such as 
double aortic arch and truncus arteriosus, co-exist.122
Decreased oxygen saturation, increased ventilation 
pressure, and modification of ventilation pattern of 
end-tidal CO2 could signal such compression by the 
esophageal probe and should be assessed, not only 
under a static probe position,136 but also dynamically, 
during the manipulation of the probe.
IV- Infections and prophylactic antibiotics
The risk of bacteremia associated with TEE must be 
considered, because bacteremia can lead to morbid 
infections, depending on a patient’s immune status 

634	 canadian journal of anesthesia
CAN J ANESTH 55: 9 www.cja-jca.org September, 2008
and pre-existing conditions, and it can also lead to 
endocarditis. The most likely organisms are alphahemolytic streptococci and staphylococci, comprising, 
respectively, 55% and 25% of cases associated with 
native valve infection and 30% and 45% of cases associated with prosthetic valve infections.137 The incidence 
of transient bacteremia varies greatly with the procedure.138 Whereas the incidence of bacteremia is not 
altered by biopsies,139 it ranges from 2% to 15% after 
diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.139 Reports vary with 
regards to TEE, from stating a very low incidence of 
bacteremia, similar to anticipated blood culture contamination rates,140,141 to declaring an incidence of 0% 
to 17%119,142–144 in ambulatory and ICU patients.139
Thus far, only two cases of bacterial endocarditis temporally related to TEE examination have been reported.142,145 The single study in 24 patients reporting a 
17%143–146 incidence of transient bacteremia, but no 
endocarditis, concluded that bacteremia was common, 
and that antibiotic therapy should be routinely instituted during TEE.143 However, the isolated organisms 
in that study were not sensitive to the antimicrobial 
prophylactic agents recommended by the American 
Heart Association (AHA).143,144,147
The use of antibiotic therapy during TEE is controversial. The AHA guidelines suggest such prophylaxis 
for patients who have prosthetic valves, previous endocarditis, complex cyanotic congenital heart disease, 
and surgically-constructed systemic pulmonary shunts 
or conduits. However, Eichelberger148 reviewed antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of endocarditis from 
20 different centres during TEE in patients with preexisting esophageal disease or poor oral and dental 
hygiene, and he concluded that there was no convincing evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis benefited 
this subgroup of patients. Further, a prospective study 
of 85 patients with prosthetic valves who underwent 
TEE disclosed that none showed evidence of bacterial 
endocarditis on follow-up,149 and that positive blood 
cultures resulted from contamination. These authors 
concluded that the likelihood of bacteremia is very 
low, and that routine chemoprophylaxis in patients 
with prosthetic valves is not justified, except in cases of 
poor oral hygiene, prolonged or traumatic TEE procedures, or in subjects undergoing TEE in the first two 
months after valve replacement. Immunosuppression, 
an underlying cardiac pathology, an enduring bacteremia, and the type of organism involved might contribute to endocarditis and justify the use of antibiotics 
during TEE. Antibiotics are also essential for sepsis 
following intraoperative TEE associated with esophageal lesions, iatrogenic perforation, and mediastinitis, 
as discussed in a previous section.56,58
Clindamycin mouthwash has not been shown to 
reduce bacteremia after esophageal dilatation.150 Whereas a latex cover sheath, adding a physical barrier, could 
be considered,151 it may produce latex allergy. Its bulkiness can make probe insertion difficult and add discomfort, especially in awake patients, and its air tightness 
is not easily established.151 As cleaning and disinfection 
are still needed to prevent probe contamination, it is 
not clear whether the cover sheath offers any advantage 
over standard measures for infection prevention.63
Although not yet demonstrated with TEE, bacterial 
and hepatitis B virus transfer via the probe has been 
documented in endoscopy.152,153 The absence of a channel for aspiration or for instrumentation on the TEE 
probe, however, greatly reduces the risk of residual 
contamination. Mechanical cleaning, alone, removes 
organic and inorganic debris, reducing microbial 
contamination by 99%. The probability of contamination is further diminished with glutaraldehyde in 
the reprocessing protocol. Pseudomonas contamination of the lubricating jelly is another potential source 
of contamination. It was reported that a nosocomial 
outbreak of Legionella pneumophila was caused by a 
contaminated TEE probe.154 Evidently, the strains isolated from three contaminated patients were identical 
to those obtained from the water used for rinsing the 
TEE probe. However, no endoscopy-transmitted HIV 
has been reported.139 HIV appears to be very sensitive 
to disinfection practices, as a TEE probe contaminated 
with high HIV viral counts in body fluids displayed 
undetectable HIV by reverse transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction after cleaning.155 Ideally, the personnel and operator should be aware of the viral status 
of the patient, however, this is generally unknown.156
The importance of vaccination and self-protection 
(goggles, gloves, gowns) must be emphasized, as a 
possible contamination from accidental biting, fluid, 
and droplets is unpredictable. Herpetic infection of 
a finger, resulting from contaminated oral secretions 
and herpetic conjunctivitis acquired during endoscopy 
from saliva spray, occurs frequently enough to deserve 
the sobriquet “endoscopist eye”.
V- Medication-related complications
Sedation
Sedation improves patient tolerance during TEE 
examination. It reduces coughing, vomiting, and 
pain. Repeated episodes of retching, not only decrease 
patient comfort and willingness to pursue the procedure, but also prevent proper cardiac imaging. Anesthetic and medical associations have developed criteria 
and guidelines for non-anesthesiologists to follow 
when administering sedation in conscious patients.157

Côté et al. complications of transesophageal echocardiography 635
CAN J ANESTH 55: 9 www.cja-jca.org September, 2008
Various sedative agents can be used, such as benzodiazepines or propofol, in combination with small 
doses of short-acting narcotics. Adverse drug reactions, such as respiratory depression, hypotension, 
paradoxical agitation, and allergic response, must be 
recognized and treated promptly. Dosage should be 
adjusted to age, weight, and pre-existing medical condition. Elderly or disabled patients and those suffering 
from sleep apnea are overly sensitive to sedation and 
analgesia and should be carefully monitored. In most 
elderly patients, minimal sedation is required or, in 
up to one third, local anesthesia is sufficient.158 The 
results of successful sedation for TEE should include 
anxiolysis, amnesia, and cooperation. The benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, can reverse the adverse 
effects of midazolam which occur in 6% of patients 
with cardiac pathology undergoing TEE.159
Local anesthetic medications
Sedation combined with local anesthesia reduces the 
hemodynamic effects associated with esophageal intubation and probe manipulation.118 The local anesthetic 
drug is rapidly absorbed when applied on mucous surfaces, and if adequate local anesthesia and suppression 
of the gag reflex cannot be obtained, a superior laryngeal nerve block can be performed.16 Allergic reactions to 
local anesthetics are rare. Central intoxication by lidocaine occurs in 0.6 to 1.3% of cases and is expressed by 
marked lethargy, disorientation, confusion and drowsiness. An underlying liver dysfunction, congestive heart 
failure, or a concomitant use of lidocaine analogs may 
predispose patients to such toxic side effects.160
Methemoglobinemia
Methemoglobin is hemoglobin A in which iron exists 
in its ferric form (trivalent state) rather than its normal 
ferrous state (divalent state). Oxygen-carrying capacity is greatly reduced, as the ferric form cannot bind 
oxygen. Methemoglobin also shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, lowering the ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen to tissues. Methemoglobin is 
continuously formed in erythrocytes and is reduced to 
deoxyhemoglobin by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent methemoglobin reductase enzyme. 
Congenital absence of the methemoglobin reductase 
enzyme may predispose patients to the development 
of methemoglobinemia. Topical anesthetics, such as 
prilocaine, lidocaine, and benzocaine, cause oxidation 
of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. When the rate of 
such oxidation exceeds that of methemoglobin reduction, methemoglobin accumulates, leading to methemoglobinemia. Whereas the physiological level of 
methemoglobin is below 2%,161 many cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in outpatient TEE 
examination settings.162–172
The presence of methemoglobinemia is suggested 
by central cyanosis, despite adequate arterial oxygen 
partial pressure, and by low measured hemoglobin saturation unresponsive to oxygen therapy. Dyspnea with 
mild associated mental confusion can also be observed 
as well as dizziness, frank coma, and even death. Cooximetry is necessary to diagnose methemoglobinemia, 
as methemoglobin is a dark pigment that causes blood 
to appear chocolate in color. Treatment of cyanosis 
due to methemoglobinemia is achieved by intravenous 
infusion of 1 to 2 mg·kg–1 of methylene blue. The 
total dose given should not exceed 7mg·kg–1. An overdose can cause dyspnea, hemolysis, and chest pain.173
Methylene blue acts as a co-factor to restore hemoglobin’s oxygen-carrying capacity. Congenital methemoglobin or glucose-6-dehydrogenase deficiency should 
be suspected if no improvement is seen after injection 
of methylene blue. In such cases, a consultation with 
hematology is mandatory, and exchange transfusion 
or dialysis should be considered.
Anticholinergic agents
Anticholinergic agents are used to reduce salivation 
and to enhance the action of local analgesic agents. 
Glycopyrrolate exerts milder tachycardic effects than 
does atropine, but it can cause tachyarrythmia, premature ventricular contractions, and atrial fibrillation, 
perhaps augmented by the stress of the procedure.174
Other side effects sometimes occur,175 and these agents 
should be used with particular caution in patients 
with glaucoma or urinary retention.156 Unlike glycopyrrolate, a synthetic antimuscarinic agent, atropine 
and scopolamine can cause excitement or delirium, 
because both cross the blood-brain barrier.176
VI- Miscellaneous complications
Glutaraldehyde and nucleotide probe contamination
A disruption of the integrity of the protective probe 
sheath can create a lumen between the probe’s external sheath and internal core. This lumen can fill with 
fluids and contaminants, such as glutaraldehyde, that 
can then be ingested. Improper cleaning of intact 
probes can lead to chemical burns from residual 
Cidex® (orthophtaldehyde)177 or to contamination by 
radionucleotides.178
Latex aerosolization
Powdered latex gloves used for maintenance of TEE 
machines can produce aerosolized latex particles that 
can cause latex-induced anaphylaxis in vulnerable 
patients.179

636	 canadian journal of anesthesia
CAN J ANESTH 55: 9 www.cja-jca.org September, 2008
Location-related complications
Performing TEE in the emergency department has 
a higher complication rate than in other clinical settings that average 1% to 3% (Table II). A retrospective 
review of TEE examinations in emergency departments demonstrated a 12.6% incidence of complications, including death, respiratory insufficiency or 
failure, hypotension, emesis, agitation, and cardiac 
dysrythmia.116 Compared to patients with medical 
or elective conditions, trauma patients experience a 
higher incidence of complications, because they often 
present with marginal hemodynamic and respiratory 
conditions and with multiple co-existing injuries (such 
as unstable C-spine damage). Considered as subjects 
with full stomachs, such trauma patients also have a 
significant risk of aspiration, especially when combined 
with altered levels of consciousness. Before proceeding 
with TEE examination in that population, it is mandatory to protect the airway by endotracheal intubation. 
Whereas TEE is a versatile tool for diagnosing and 
treating severely ill patients, lack of space in the ICU 
suite and difficult passage of the probe render this procedure problematic.180,181
Transnasal esophageal echocardiography
Whereas transnasal probe introduction has recently 
been suggested, this procedure has significant shortcomings, such as a failure rate of 10% to 16%,182–184
nasopharyngeal bleeding in 0 to 31%,182–184 and difficult management requiring nasal tamponade. It is 
wrong to believe that the transnasal approach protects 
against esophageal perforation. In addition, image 
quality and its interpretation appear to be less precise 
with this approach, thus arguing against nasal intubation as an indicated approach. 
VII-Local effects of ultrasound waves on surrounding tissues
Theoretically, a powerful ultrasound beam can cause a 
vibration of small gas-filled structures (i.e., cavitation), 
thus producing hemorrhage or hemolysis. Whereas 
such effects have been reported in experiments conducted in animals,185–187 none has been shown in 
humans.188 Furthermore, a powerful ultrasound beam 
can produce excessive tissue heat and damage and can 
be used in therapeutic indications such as during lithotripsy. However, when used at low intensity, typically 
at 5 MHz for TEE procedures, ultrasound has yet to 
display any harmful effects.189,190 Therefore, the World 
Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology 
and common sense dictate that the operator know the 
precise power output and intensity of the ultrasound 
instrument being used. The operator must balance the 
benefits against the risks of its use and minimize the 
patient’s exposure to ultrasound.
VIII-Echocardiographer expertise
Because of the complexity of TEE and its associated 
risks, the American Society of Echocardiography, the 
Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the 
European Society of Cardiology have strict requirements for optimal initial training of echocardiographers and for their ongoing advancement of expertise 
in performing this procedure.191–194
IX-Prevention of transesophageal echocardiography-related complications
Prior to undertaking TEE, the procedure must be 
explained to the patient, risks vs benefits stated, and

an informed consent obtained. A complete physical 
examination and careful questioning on medical history, allergies, and medications are essential. The examination must include an evaluation of oral hygiene and 
loose teeth (for preventive antibiotic treatment), an 
assessment of neck mobility, stability, and arthritic 
changes, and an analysis of the airways. Swallowing 
problems, a possible indicator of orogastric narrowing, may be a possible contraindication to TEE probe 
insertion195 and should prompt consultation with 
gastroenterology and radiological barium swallowing 
studies. Past GI surgery, recent endoscopic procedure, 
and chest wall radiotherapy may hint at esophageal 
abnormalities, and a chest x-ray should be performed 
to rule out pathologies, such as hiatus hernia (Figure 
5). Sometimes, even such precautions do not prevent 
esophageal laceration during TEE.196
It is essential to properly store the probe holder and 
the probe, itself, and to protect its distal part.197–200
Prior to TEE examination, the probe must be inspected for both mechanical dysfunction and for damage to 
the flexible outer sheath that can collect contaminated 
fluid causing electrical or thermal injuries,39 potentially 
resulting in arrhythmia and death201 or to a steel wire 
damage of the esophageal mucosa.202 The control system must be unlocked at all times to ensure probe flexibility and to prevent esophageal tear by rigid tubes.85
Monitoring vital signs at baseline and throughout 
TEE is essential. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, 
and pulse oximetry must be monitored throughout 
the intervention. Oxygen supplementation and venous 
access should be established for sedation or to manage any complications. Equipment should include a 
suction device and resuscitation cart, and supporting 
personnel should be present to alleviate some of the 
burden placed on the echocardiographer.203
The TEE examination under conscious sedation 
is very different from that under general anesthesia. 
Whereas rapid anesthetic induction in emergency 
situations is followed by orotracheal intubation, in 
an elective procedure performed in an awake, fasting 
patient, the patient is placed in a left lateral decubitus position to minimize the risk of aspiration, and 
a suction device is placed close at hand and ready 
for use.63 Sedation and local anesthesia will improve 
the success of esophageal intubation. Dental fixtures 
must be removed before intubation, and a bite guard 
should be placed, especially in awake procedures and 
in patients with full dentures, as it protects the instrument and the operator’s fingers. The TEE probe 
should be lubricated, in an unlocked control-wheel 
position, and its passage never forced. The probe 
must be kept central to the tongue and guided in 
a fluid movement without excessive force in a posterior manner against the posterior pharyngeal wall. 
The awake patient is asked to swallow during probe 
insertion. This closes the vocal cords bringing the 
larynx up and forward under the posterior aspect of 
the tongue and opening the cricopharyngeal muscle. 
Under general anesthesia, a jaw thrust maneuver can 
help overcome resistance felt in the hypopharynx 
region when the probe is in contact with the epiglottis or with other glottic structures. Probe placement under direct laryngoscopy may reduce the risk 
of lesions associated with numerous blind attempts. 
The screen monitor should be active to confirm the 
proper location of the probe in the esophagus.124
Careful insertion of 40 to 50 cm from the incisors is 
advocated.204 Resistance to probe insertion within the 
esophagus can result from esophageal abnormalities, 
as discussed earlier. When the probe is introduced 
under general anesthesia, the entire oropharyngeal 
musculature is relaxed. This could predispose the 
probe to being pushed into a mucosal fold and ultimately to buckle or to cause a lesion. Such a risk 
is reduced in awake subjects who can collaborate by 
swallowing the probe and indicating the presence of 
pain or discomfort during probe manipulation. Under 
general anesthesia, patients do not experience intolerance, retching, or gag reflex. The endotracheal tube 
and its cuff provide some protection against aspiration. Any nasogastric or feeding tube or temperature 
probe should be removed to avoid potential kinking, 
knotting, or gastric migration and loss, as well as to 
prevent interference during image acquisition. Special care must be taken during cardiac surgery, as the 
TEE probe stays much longer than during a diagnostic examination, and as anticoagulation during the

chest (A) and behind the left atriun on the lateral view (B).

bypass period, the hypothermic state, and blood flow 
reduction can render the mucosa more susceptible 
to pressure necrosis and ischemia. Cardiopulmonary 
events account for most of the complications during 
TEE and endoscopic procedures in sedated patients. 
Continuous monitoring and vigilance are required 
to anticipate problems and make prompt corrections 
(Table IV).
After the procedure, the patient should remain 
under observation until the effects of the sedation and 
the local anesthetic agent dissipate. A trained assistant 
must continue monitoring the patient during this transition period prior to discharge. Eating and drinking 
are allowed once the effects of local anesthetic have 
dissipated. Driving after the procedure is prohibited 
because of sedation during the examination. Furthermore, the patient should be discharged to the care of 
a responsible escort. Table V summarizes a practical 
approach in the use of TEE in our Centre.
Limitations
Although we tried to carefully review the most relevant 
and up-to-date literature on the topic of complications 
related to TEE, we identified at least one article205 that 
mentions complications related to gastroscopy, without being the central theme. It is possible that our 
search strategy overlooked some articles; however, we 
have tried to provide clinicians using TEE with a practical presentation of the most important complications 
in relation to this technique. 
Conclusions
Compared to regular transthoracic echocardiography, 
in which bone and lung tissue can interfere with cardiac imaging, TEE allows greater probe proximity to 
posterior cardiac structures, thus greatly improving 
the imaging of cardiac anatomy and function. Whereas this echocardiographic approach is more invasive 
and can be associated with complications, experts in 
this technique should be aware of the nature of such 
complications, to minimize risk factors and to take the 
necessary precautions to prevent their occurrence.
