of its aetiology

Although organ fibrosis causes significant morbidity and mortality in chronic diseases,
the lack of detailed knowledge about specific cellular contributors mediating fibrogenesis
hampers the design of effective antifibrotic therapies. Different cellular sources, including
tissue-resident and bone marrow-derived fibroblasts, pericytes and epithelial cells, have been
suggested to give rise to myofibroblasts, but their relative contributions remain controversial,
with profound differences between organs and different diseases. Here we employ a novel
Cre-transgenic mouse that marks 99% of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a liver-specific
pericyte population, to demonstrate that HSCs give rise to 82–96% of myofibroblasts in
models of toxic, cholestatic and fatty liver disease. Moreover, we exclude that HSCs function
as facultative epithelial progenitor cells in the injured liver. On the basis these findings, HSCs
should be considered the primary cellular target for antifibrotic therapies across all types of
liver disease.

F
ibrotic diseases account for up to 45% of deaths in developed
countries, but we still lack effective antifibrotic therapies1.
Knowledge about cells contributing to the myofibroblast
pool and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in organ fibrosis
is important for designing targeted therapies2,3. Several cell
populations, including tissue-resident or bone marrow (BM)-
derived fibroblasts, pericytes and epithelial cells, have been
suggested as relevant contributors to the myofibroblast pool2,3,
but their contribution varies between organs and different
diseases, and remains a matter of debate.
Liver fibrosis occurs as a result of chronic liver disease and is
associated with severe morbidity and mortality4. Hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs), a pericyte-like cell population of the liver, and portal
fibroblasts are widely considered the most relevant sources of
hepatic myofibroblasts, but their precise contribution remains
unknown. It is thought that the underlying liver disease
determines the cell types that contribute to the myofibroblast
pool, with profound differences between toxic and cholestatic
liver diseases, and portal fibroblast exerting a key role in the
latter4–7. Other cell types such as BM-derived fibrocytes may also
contribute to the myofibroblast pool, but to a lesser degree8,9.
However, most evidence about relevant myofibroblast sources
and functions derives from cell isolates and in vitro studies10–12,
whereas in vivo studies quantifying the relative contribution of
different cell populations in the fibrotic liver are missing. In this
regard, fate-tracing studies have excluded a contribution of
hepatocytes and cholangiocytes to the myofibroblast pool13–15,
but positive identification of cell types contributing to the
myofibroblast pool by fate tracing is lacking. As such, previous
studies employing collagen-driven Cre or Wt1-Cre have tracked
either all collagen-producing myofibroblasts, but not specific
cellular sources of myofibroblasts12, or mesothelial cells, which
give rise to subcapsular fibroblasts within 150 mm of the liver
surface but not to intrahepatic myofibroblasts, that is, those that
cause organ fibrosis and its deleterious complications16. Attempts
at fate-tracing HSCs, one of the prime candidates4,11,17, using
Cre driven by the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter
(hGFAPCre) are hampered by the fact that hGFAPCre marks
cholangiocytes18,19 (https://ndp.jax.org/NDPServe.dll?ViewItem?
ItemID=1741&XPos=11536496&YPos=5169511&ZPos=0&Lens=
1.25&SignIn=Sign%20in%20as%20Guest), thereby limiting
interpretation.
Here we employ a novel fate tracing method for HSCs
to demonstrate that HSCs are the dominant contributors
to collagen-producing myofibroblasts in models of toxic, biliary
and fatty liver fibrosis. Moreover, we exclude that HSCs serve as
facultative epithelial progenitors in the injured liver.
Results
LratCre but not hGFAPCre labels HSCs. Using three different
Cre reporters, we confirmed that hGFAPCre mice labelled bile
ducts and cytokeratin 19-expressing cholangiocytes (Fig. 1a, e–h).
Of note, hGFAPCre mice did not efficiently mark HSCs or collagen-producing myofibroblasts (Fig. 1b–g). Likewise, mice
expressing Cre under the murine Gfap promoter did not label
HSCs (Fig. 1i). To achieve faithful labelling of HSCs, we generated
a bacterial artifical chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse in
which Cre expression is driven by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase
(Lrat; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Lrat was selected in screens
among several candidates because of high expression in HSCs,
virtually undetectable expression in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and
cholangiocytes (Fig. 2a), and its key role in the formation of
retinyl ester-containing lipid droplets, one of the defining features
of HSCs20. In contrast to a previous study21, we also
did not detect Lrat protein or messenger RNA expression
in endothelial cells (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. S1A). LratCre
transgenic mice marked 99% of HSCs as demonstrated by flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry in two different Cre
reporter mice, showing nearly complete overlap of HSC
markers desmin and Pdgfrb with LratCre-induced ZsGreen Cre
reporter by confocal microscopy, no significant overlap with
hepatocyte, macrophage and cholangiocyte markers, and only few
spots of overlap with endothelial cell markers, most likely to be
due to their very close proximity to HSCs (Fig. 2b–e and
Supplementary Fig. S1C–G).
HSCs are the main contributors to toxic liver fibrosis. To
determine the contribution of HSCs to the myofibroblast pool, we
first subjected LratCre mice to the well-established model of
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis. In this
model, LratCre-induced ZsGreen expression—marking HSCs—
and a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) expression—marking
myofibroblasts—completely overlapped, and displayed microand macroscopic ZsGreen fluorescence with the characteristic
septal pattern of liver fibrosis (Fig. 3a,b). To determine the
relative contribution of HSCs to the myofibroblast pool, we
quantified the overlap between LratCre-induced Cre reporter and
aSMA. In CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, the overlap between
LratCre-induced ZsGreen and aSMA was 93.6% (±2.3% s.d.,
n ¼ 4, Fig. 3b), providing evidence that HSCs are the almost
exclusive source of myofibroblasts in toxic liver fibrosis. To
confirm this data by a second approach, we generated LratCre
mice co-expressing red-fluorescent Cre reporter tdTomato and a
green-fluorescent Col-GFP reporter, which faithfully marks collagen-producing cells22. LratCre-induced tdTomato almost
completely overlapped with Col-GFP fluorescence in the CCl4
model (96.0%±2.4% s.d., n ¼ 4, Fig. 3b), thus matching the
degree of overlap that we found between aSMA and LratCreinduced ZsGreen. Accordingly, nearly all aSMA-positive cells
were also Col-GFP-positive (Fig. 3c). To exclude that our data
may be specific to the CCl4 model, we confirmed our findings in a
second well-established model of toxic liver fibrosis, induced by
thioacetamide (TAA) treatment. Livers from TAA-induced
treated mice also displayed a characteristic macro- and
microscopic septal pattern of ZsGreen fluorescence, and the
same range of co-localization between LratCre-induced
TdTomato and Col-GFP fluorescence (94.8±0.3% s.d., n ¼ 3)
as in the CCl4 model (Supplementary Fig. S2A–C). To further
substantiate the functional contribution of HSCs to fibrogenesis,
we ablated HSCs via LratCre-induced diphtheria toxin receptor.
This strategy strongly reduced HSC numbers in untreated and
CCl4-treated livers, albeit not completely (Fig. 3d,e and
Supplementary Fig. S3A). However, it should be noted that this
approach typically does not result in complete ablation unless a
strongly intensified regimen of diptheria toxin injection is
employed23. The reduction of aSMA and profibrogenic gene
expression by at least the same degree as ablation of HSCs,
assessed by desmin mRNA and immunohistochemisty (Fig. 3d,e),
confirms the relevant contribution of HSCs to fibrogenesis. In
contrast, hepatic inflammation, injury and expression of
endothelial marker vWf were not affected by HSC ablation
(Supplementary Fig. S3B–D).
HSCs are the main contributors to biliary liver fibrosis. After
having established HSCs as the main contributors to toxic liver
fibrosis, we next determined the contribution of HSCs to
cholestatis-induced liver fibrosis. In this setting, portal fibroblasts
are believed to be an essential contributor to fibrogenesis4,5,7. In
three well-established models of cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis,

collidine (DDC)-containing diet and Mdr2ko mice, tdTomato
expression almost completely overlapped with Col-GFP reporter
expression, reaching X89% co-localization and thus almost the
same degree as in toxic liver fibrosis (Fig. 4a–c,e). This data was
confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of the entire nonparenchymal cell pool, in which 82–85% of collagen-producing
cells were tdTomato-positive HSCs (Fig. 4d,e). A high contribution
of HSCs to collagen-producing cells was even noted during early
cholestatic liver fibrosis (87–90% co-localization, Supplementary Fig.
S4A–D, G) and in the methionine–choline-deficient diet model of
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (Supplementary Fig. S4E–G). Similar
to CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, LratCre not only marked collagenproducing cells but also aSMA-expressing cells, with 80 and 88%
overlap between aSMA and LratCre-induced tdTomato after 7 and
14 days BDL, respectively, and a strong overlap between aSMApositive and Col-GFP-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A,B).
Lrat-negative portal fibroblasts-like cells are distinct from
HSCs. In addition to LratCre-labelled, Col-GFP-positive HSCs,
we also found a small population of Col-GFP-positive but
LratCre-unlabelled fibroblasts, both in the liver and in cell isolates
of cholestatic fibrosis models. These cells were predominantly
located around the portal tracts and did not contain retinoid lipid
droplets, consistent with characteristics of portal fibroblasts
(Fig. 4f,h). This LratCre-negative, Col-GFP-positive population
of portal fibroblast-like cells (PFLCs) showed low expression
of genes characteristic for HSCs, such as Lrat, Lhx2 and HGF, and
was morphologically distinct from HSCs (Fig. 4g,h). PFLCs were
aSMA- and Col-GFP-positive, and abundantly expressed Acta2,
Col1a1, Lox, Timp1 and Vim in comparison with whole liver
(Supplementary Fig. S6A,B), confirming them as myofibroblasts.
However, they expressed significantly lower levels of fibrogenic
genes than HSCs in our isolates (Fig. 4g), thus excluding that

PFLC might represent a less abundant but more fibrogenic
population than HSCs. Together, these data indicate that portal
fibroblast constitute a myofibroblast population that is not HSCderived and significantly less abundant than HSCs, and probably
fulfils specialized functions in cholestatic liver disease.
Myofibroblasts derive from LratCre-labelled retinoid-positive
HSCs. aSMA staining in normal liver (where HSCs are quiescent
and do not express aSMA) revealed that LratCre also labelled
some vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs, Supplementary Fig.
S7A). This may be explained by the fact that VSMCs and pericytes/HSCs are considered to be of the same lineage24, sharing a
common precursor in the liver25. Although LratCre-labelled
HSCs outnumbered LratCre-labelled VSMCs by a factor of 4200
(Supplementary Fig. S7B), we wanted to further exclude a major
contribution of LratCre-labelled VSMCs, or any other non-HSC
population to the hepatic collagen-producing fibroblast pool. As
specific labelling of hepatic VSMCs is not feasible, we employed
retinoid fluorescence to identify LratCre-labelled myofibroblasts
of HSC origin. Retinoid fluorescence was observed in 490% of
tdTomato- and Col-GFP-positive cells in the CCl4, BDL and
Mdr2ko fibrosis models (Supplementary Fig. S7C,D), albeit at a
lower level than in quiescent HSCs, thus confirming that these
myofibroblasts are of HSC and not of VSMC origin. Collectively,
our data establish HSCs as principal contributors to the collagenproducing myofibroblast pool across all types of liver fibrosis.
HSCs are not epithelial progenitors. Next, we determined
whether HSCs may exert functions besides fibrogenesis in liver
injury. Previous studies, employing hGFAPCre and aSMAHSCs Hep

CreERT2 mice for fate tracing, suggested that up to 24% of
hepatocytes were derived from HSCs in the methionine–cholinedeficient ethionine-supplemented (MCDE) diet and BDL
models18,19. By employing LratCre mice, we tested whether
short- and long-term injury induced by BDL, Mdr2ko, MCDE
diet, DDC diet, CCl4, TAA or 70% partial hepatectomy resulted
in the generation of HNF4a-positive hepatocytes expressing
ZsGreen Cre reporter, thus identifying them as progeny of
LratCre-expressing HSCs. Although we found rare HNF4apositive hepatocytes (at a frequency of E0.2 per 1,000 cells)
expressing Cre reporter ZsGreen, none of the injury models
increased this rate in the liver (Fig. 5a–g and Supplementary
Fig. S8A–C). We also did not observe increased ZsGreen-positive
cells with hepatocyte morphology (positive control shown in the
insert of Fig.5A) in liver sections (Fig. 5a–f and Supplementary
Fig. S8B–C) or in primary hepatocyte isolates (Fig. 5h,i and

not give rise to cytokeratin-positive liver progenitor cells or
cholangiocytes in any of the chronic injury models (Fig. 2e and
Supplementary Fig. S9A–E). Collectively, these data exclude that
HSCs function as epithelial progenitors.
LratCre-positive HSCs are not BM derived. Finally, we
employed LratCre mice to assess whether HSCs constitute a
liver-resident or BM-derived cell population, a point of substantial controversy26–28. We did not detect LratCre-labelled
HSCs in normal liver or fibrotic livers after BDL or long-term
injury induced by 20 CCl4 injections despite successful BM
transplantation as evidenced by mTom-positive (that is, nonrecombined) BM-derived cells in the spleen and mTom- and
F4/80-double-positive BM-derived macrophages in the liver
(Fig. 6a–c). These data confirm HSCs as liver-resident cell
population.

Discussion
Despite the lack of solid in vivo evidence that HSCs are the
primary drivers of liver fibrosis, much of the current research and
drug discovery work focus on this cell type. After the discovery
that HSCs produce significantly larger amounts of collagen than
hepatocytes and endothelial cells in vitro and thus constitute a
prime candidate for hepatic myofibroblast precursors11, little
progress has been made to further establish and precisely quantify
the relative contribution of HSCs to the hepatic myofibroblast
pool and liver fibrosis in vivo. Most subsequent studies have
investigated HSC activation in cell cultures, a process that
differs substantially from in vivo activation10,29, or studied
HSC isolates from normal and fibrotic livers10,12. Because of
the lack of fate tracing techniques that specifically label precursor
populations such as HSCs, sources of hepatic myofibroblasts
have not yet been established or precisely quantified in vivo.
Fate tracing has excluded a contribution for epithelial cells to
the hepatic myofibroblast pool13–15 and characterized the

embryonic origin of HSCs16. However, positive identification of
myofibroblast precursors has not been achieved, as fate-tracing
approaches have labelled all myofibroblast populations but not
specific precursors13 or subpopulations, such as subcapsular
fibroblasts, which contribute little to organ fibrosis and the
deleterious complications of fibrosis due to their sparsity and
anatomic location16.
The most important finding of our study is the in vivo
identification of HSCs as a universal and liver-resident source for
myofibroblasts, exerting a dominant role across toxic, biliary and
fatty liver diseases. These data suggest that HSCs should be
considered the primary target for the development of new
antifibrotic therapies, which has become an important focus of
the field30–32. Revealing HSCs as the by-far dominant source in
cholestatic fibrosis is unexpected, as portal fibroblasts have been
considered a key contributor in cholestatic liver fibrosis4,5,7. The
consistently high contribution of HSCs was observed in three
different models of cholestasis, including the Mdr2ko model,
which mimicks defects in cholestatic patients33. Thus, our data
refute the hypothesis that the underlying disease dictates the cell
type that contributes to the myofibroblast pool in liver fibrosis,
and instead establish HSCs as universal responders that trigger
wound repair across different types of liver injury. Despite the
dominant role of HSCs, there was a higher contribution of nonHSC myofibroblast sources in biliary than in toxic liver fibrosis.
Accordingly, we identified a population of LratCre-negative
fibroblasts around portal tracts that were distinct from HSCs in
terms of gene expression and anatomic localization. Despite being
less abundant than HSCs, these cells most likely exert important
functions in cholestatic liver disease. Although portal fibroblasts
probably do not make a major contribution to organ fibrosis and
associated complications such as portal hypertension owing to
their low abundance, their anatomic localization suggests that
they may exert specialized functions related to bile ducts. This
might be the mechanical stabilization of bile ducts as an adaptive
response to increased pressure, or a contribution to biliary
stenosis as a maladaptive response. It is also conceivable that
portal fibroblasts represent a cell population that has a role in
early biliary fibrosis serving as ‘rapid responders’7, and that it is
essential in recruiting HSCs, which then in turn contribute to the
majority of ECM production. Further studies should also
determine whether LratCre-negative portal fibroblasts may
produce different type of ECM than HSCs.
The second relevant finding of our study is that HSCs are not
progenitor cells and do not contribute to the generation of
hepatocytes in the injured liver. Previous studies had suggested
that HSCs contribute up to 24% of newly formed hepatocytes18,19. As we labelled 499% of HSCs by LratCre and
investigated their contribution to hepatocyte generation in liver
sections from seven different injury models and in primary
hepatocyte isolates from two injury models, in the liver and in
hepatocyte isolates without finding increased number of HNF4aand ZsGreen-double positive cells, or ZsGreen-positive cells with
hepatocyte shape, we can exclude HSCs as a source for epithelial
regeneration in the liver. Our findings are congruent with studies
showing that hepatocytes and, to a lesser degree, bipotential
progenitors function as efficient cellular sources for epithelial
regeneration34–36.
Finally, our data, showing that GFAPCre transgenic mice efficiently label cholangiocytes but not a significant amount of HSCs,
suggest that previous studies employing GFAPCre13,18,19,37,38 are
likely to be not HSC-specific. We cannot completely rule out that
there may be differences in the recombination in different floxed
alleles or Cre reporters, but have tested three Cre reporters,
confirmed GFAPCre by sequencing, tested functional Cre
expression in brain sections and have used mice expressing
Cre under the human GFAP as well as the murine Gfap
promoter. Furthermore, previous publications18,19 and Jackson

in cholangiocytes.
Our study has several limitations. First of all, murine
fibrogenesis may not fully reflect human fibrogenesis due to its
shorter duration, different biology and difficulties to model all
relevant diseases adequately in mice. We have assessed the HSC
contribution in a large number of murine models, but human
confirmation is warranted. This may be achieved by developing
markers that clearly distinguish between HSC and non-HSC
myofibroblast populations such as portal fibroblasts. Second of
all, LratCre also labelled some VSMCs in our study. This is likely
to be because of the fact that pericytes and VSMCs share a
common precursor in many organs, including the liver24,25.
However, we found that 490% of LratCre-labelled myofibroblasts contained retinoid lipid droplets characteristic for
HSCs, thus providing strong evidence that LratCre-labelled
myofibroblasts are indeed derived from HSCs. Third, it is
conceivable that LratCre activity is turned on in non-HSC
populations during fibrogenesis, and that we overestimate the
contribution of HSCs. However, we found that non-HSC
myofiboblast populations such as PFLCs were LratCre-negative
and distinct from HSC. We also did not find a significant amount
of LratCre-labelled hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, endothelial cells
or Kupffer cells in CCl4-induced liver injury, providing further
evidence that LratCre activity is not significantly induced in nonHSC populations in the injured liver. Moreover, the above
discussed finding that 490% of LratCre-positive myofibroblasts
also contained retinoids characteristic for HSCs also excludes a
significant contribution of non-HSC populations. As such,
retinoid lipid droplets are a defining feature of HSCs and the
only parameter by which they could be clearly defined to date.
Tamoxifen-inducible LratCre would be helpful to further confirm
these data and further exclude LratCre activity in other cell types
during disease, but is likely to achieve a lower labelling efficacy
than constitutive LratCre and a less precise quantification of HSC
contribution to the hepatic myofibroblast pool. Fourth, our
isolation of PFLCs may contain cells other than portal fiboblasts
as the employed isolation method relied on exclusion of HSCs
and not on positive identification. Further establishment of high
purity portal fibroblast isolates will allow more powerful
qualitative comparison between HSCs and portal fibroblasts.
In contrast to the dominant role of HSCs in liver fibrosis, the
contribution of pericytes in fibrosis of other organs remains
controversial with some studies in the kidney, lung and spinal
cord39–41 showing a key contribution but other studies reporting
opposite findings42,43. Confirming a key role for pericytes in
fibrogenesis in additional organs may allow to determine
common targets for antifibrotic therapies across different organs.
Methods
Generation of LratCre mice. A Cre-containing cassette was PCR-amplified with
60-bp overhangs homologous to the upstream and downstream sequence
surrounding the ATG site of the mouse Lrat gene. The PCR product was inserted
into a BAC containing the mouse Lrat gene by recombineering. After removal of
the Neo cassette by arabinose-induced flippase, BAC DNA was microinjected into
the pronucleus of fertilized CBAxC57BL/6J oocytes. Out of six positive founders,
the one showing the strongest LratCre-induced Cre reporter expression in the liver
and HSCs was used for further studies. Pups were born in a male/female ratio of 1:1
(50.3% versus 49.7%, n ¼ 179).
Mice and genotyping. Mice in which Cre expression is driven by the human
GFAP promoter (hGFAPCre)44, the murine Gfap promoter (mGfapCre)45 and
mice expressing Cre reporters ZsGreen, TdTomato46 or mTom/mGFP47 were
obtained from Jackson. Mdr2ko mice48 in FVB/N background have been described.
For all experiments, LratCre mice were maintained in a mixed background after
breeding one to two times into the ZsGreen, tdTomato reporter and mTom/mGFP
strains of the C57Bl/6 background, or Mdr2ko mice. Mice for HSC isolations were
used at ages 12–18 weeks. Mice used for fibrosis or injury models, or for nonparenchymal cell isolation were used at ages 8–12 weeks unless otherwise indicated.
Mice of both genders were used with the exception of the BDL and DDC
models for which only male mice were employed. Genotyping for LratCre was
done using forward primer 50
-CCTTTCTTTGACCCCCTGCAC-30 and reverse
primer 50
-GACCGGCAAACGGACAGAAG-30. Genotyping for hGFAPCre mice
was done using forward primer 50
-ACTCCTTCATAAAGCCCT-30 and reverse
primer 50
-CGCCGCATAACCAGTGAAAC-30. The PCR product for hGFAPCre
genotyping was sequenced and presence of human GFAP promoter sequence was
confirmed.
Liver fibrosis and injury models. Toxic liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injections of either CCl4 (0.5 ml g  1, dissolved in corn oil at a ratio of
1:3) for various intervals, or of TAA (dissolved in NaCl 0.9%) for 6 weeks (three
injections per week) at increasing concentrations (first dose: 50 mg kg  1, second
dose: 100 mg kg  1, third to sixth dose: 200 mg kg  1, all following doses:
300 mg kg  1) as previously described49. For the induction of cholestatic liver
fibrosis, mice underwent ligation of the common bile duct27. Briefly, after
abdominal incision, the common bile duct was ligated distally. For additional
models of cholestatic liver fibrosis, mice were either fed a 0.1% DDC-containing
diet for 4 weeks or LratCre mice were crossed with Mdr2ko mice48 in FVB/N
background. ZsGreen, tdTomato and mTom/mGFP Cre reporter mice46,47, as well
as Col-GFP reporter22 mice, have been described elsewhere. As a model of fatty
liver disease, liver fibrosis was induced by feeding mice a methione–cholinedeficient diet for 9 weeks. Seventy per cent partial hepatectomy was performed as
described50. Briefly, after midline abdominal incision, the left lateral and the
median liver lobes were mobilized, ligated and cut off50. As models of liver injury
with progenitor expansion, we employed the above described DDC diet and
methionine–choline-deficient diet combined with 0.15% ethionine supplementation
in drinking water (MCDE diet)18,19. All animal procedures were in accordance
with guidelines by the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University.
Primary cell isolations. HSCs were isolated from mice as described previously49,51. Briefly, after cannulation of the inferior vena cava, the portal vein was
cut, allowing retrograde stepwise perfusion with pronase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA)- and collagenase (Roche, Germany)-containing solutions, and
subsequent 9.7% Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. Purity was assessed by vitamin A
autofluorescence under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus 71IX). The entire
population of non-parenchymal cells was isolated using pronase/collagenase
perfusion and a 16.95% Nycodenz gradient. Murine hepatocytes were isolated by
collagenase perfusion and low-density centrifugation with Percoll52. F4/80-positive
hepatic macrophages were isolated after collagenase/pronase perfusion, followed by
a 16.95% Nycodenz gradient and subsequent positive selection of F4/80-positive
cells by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) using biotinylated F4/80 antibody
(clone: BM8; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and anti-biotin MACS beads
(Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA)53. On the basis of the specific marking of bile
ducts by hGFAPCre, cholangiocytes were isolated by flow cytometry from
hGFAPCre mice expressing ZsGreen Cre reporter after pronase/collagenase
perfusion of mouse livers. Cholangiocyte identity was confirmed by western
blotting for cytokeratin 19. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells were isolated by
collagenase perfusion followed by MACS using anti-CD146 MACS beads (Miltenyi
Biotec) and subsequent FACS analysis to exclude HSCs in the isolate54.
Analysis of vitamin A content and Col-GFP expression. Vitamin A fluorescence
was analysed by flow cytometry in isolated HSCs or non-parenchymal liver cells
using 405–407 nm lasers for excitation and a 450/50-nm bandpass filter for
detection. To determine vitamin A expression of activated HSCs, Col-GFP- and
tdTomato-double-positive cells were gated. Vitamin A-negative cells expressing
Col-GFP were used as negative controls to set the threshold for positive signals for
Vitamin A. GFP expression was analysed using 488 nm lasers and 530/30 nm
bandpass filter for detection. Non-parenchymal liver cell isolations from untreated
Col-GFP-positive, LratCre-positive and tdTomoto-positive mice were used to set
the threshold for positive Col-GFP signals. TdTomato expression was analysed
using 488 nm lasers and 582/15 nm bandpass filter for detection. Four to six
independent cell isolates were analysed for each model, using a minimum for
100,000 events for data evaluation. Flow cytometric data were analysed by FlowJo
software.
BM transplantation. BM transplantation was performed as described previously27. Briefly, wild-type mice were macrophage depleted by injection of
liposomal clodronate, followed by lethal irradiation with 2  6 Gy and intravenous
injection of 10  106 BM cells from LratCre-positive, mTom/mGFP mice.
Successful BM transplantation was confirmed by the presence of mTom-positive
cells in the spleen and mTom-positive macrophages in the liver.

Immunohistochemical staining and microscopy. Immunohistochemistry was
performed on frozen liver sections. Mouse livers were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded. Frozen tissue blocks were cut to yield 5 mm sections
for immunohistochemical staining49 using primary antibodies against desmin
(1:300, rabbit, Lab Vision catalogue number RB-9014-P; Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Fremont, CA, USA), aSMA (1:500, mouse, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated,
Sigma-Aldrich F3777), cytokeratin (1:250, rabbit, DAKO Z0622), F4/80 (1:250, rat,
AbD serotec MCA497A64), CD31 (1:500, rat, Pharmingen 553369), PDGFRb
(1:50, rabbit, Cell Signaling 3169) and HNF4a (1:100, goat, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology SC-6556), and matching secondary anti-rabbit (1:500, donkey,
A21207), anti-rat (1:500, chicken, A21472), anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(1:1,000, rabbit, A11090) and anti-goat (1.500, chicken, A21468) with various
fluorescent conjugates (all from Invitrogen). Confocal microscopy was performed
on a Nikon A1 confocal laser microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA)
using a 20  lens or 40  and 60  oil-immersion lenses. For some pictures and
for quantification, four to six sections were merged. For macroscopic imaging,
livers were visualized under a Leica MZ 16F fluorescent dissecting microscope.
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting for Lrat, desmin or cytokeratin was performed
on isolated primary hepatic cell populations using a mouse anti-Lrat antibody
(dilution 1:5,000)55, desmin (Lab Vision, 1:2,000) and cytokeratin 19 (rat, TromaIII, 1:1,000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa). Briefly,
cell or liver lysates were electrophoresed on 10% acrylamide SDS gels and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Loading was confirmed by Ponceau S
staining. Blots were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk, followed by overnight
incubation at 4 C with primary antibody, 1 h incubation with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detection by luminescence
(SuperSignal, Thermoscientfic). Specificity of the Lrat antibody was determined
using liver extracts from wild-type and Lrat knockout mice (Supplementary
Fig. S10C). Blots were reprobed with actin antibody (1:5,000; MP Biomedicals) to
confirm equal loading. Full-length images of all immunoblots are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S10.
Quantification of positively stained cells. HNF4a-positive hepatocytes were
quantified in merged 20  pictures representing 70–100 random 20  fields per
mouse. Three to four mice per treatment group were analysed. To determine ColGFP-positive cells or aSMA-positive cells originating from HSCs, at least 50
random 40  pictures were analysed per mouse. Experiments were performed in
three to five animals per treatment group. Quantification of HNF4a-positive,
aSMA-positive cells and Col-GFP-positive cells, and determination of co-localization with fluorescent Cre reporters were performed using ImageJ software.
Statistical evaluation. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (GraphPad,
San Diego, CA). Differences between two groups were calculated by Student’s
t-test. Significance of differences between multiple groups was determined by oneway analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc test. All data are expressed
as means±s.d.
