Abstract. Background/Aim: The sacrifice of a major
hepatic vein can cause hepatic venous congestion (HVC). We
evaluated the effects of HVC on regional liver function using
the liver uptake value (LUV), that was calculated from 99mTc-labeled-galactosyl-human-serum-albumin (
99mTcGSA) single-photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT) /contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT)
fused images. Patients and Methods: Sixty-two patients
underwent 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT prior to hepatectomy
for liver cancer and at 7 days after surgery were divided into
groups with (n=8) and without HVC (n=54). In the HVC
group, CT volume (CTv) and LUV were separately
calculated in both congested and non-congested areas.
Results: The remnant LUV/CTv of the HVC group was
significantly smaller than that of the non-HVC group
(p<0.01). The mean functional ratio was 0.47±0.05, and all
ratios were ≥0.39. Conclusion: After hepatectomy with
sacrifice of major hepatic vein, liver function per unit
volume in the congested areas was approximately 40% of
that in the non-congested areas.
Hepatic venous congestion (HVC) often seems to be related
to extended right and left hepatectomy when sacrificing the
middle hepatic vein and venous congestion has been observed
in the left medial or right anterior sector of the remnant liver,
respectively (1, 2). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography
(CE-CT) imaging is clinically useful in the diagnosis of
postoperative HVC (3). The negative impact of HVC has
been reported in morphological regeneration after
hepatectomy (1, 4-6). However, the liver volume cannot
directly represent hepatic functional change itself (7, 8). Thus,
the liver volume measured from CT (CTv) alone is not
completely adequate for assessing the overall effects of HVC
on hepatic functional recovery after hepatectomy. 99mTc-Labeled galactosyl human serum albumin (
99mTcGSA) scintigraphy has been used for the quantitative
assessment of preoperative liver functional volume for
patients with liver cancer (9-12). Moreover, the indices
obtained by 99mTc-GSA single-photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) have been proven useful in evaluating
the hepatic function during the regeneration process (9).
Quantitative indices of liver uptake value (LUV) obtained by
the combination of 99mTc GSA SPECT and CT images have
yielded an accurate estimation of the hepatic function and
histopathological damage in patients with chronic liver
disease (13). We crafted a 99mTc-GSA SPECT and CE-CT
fused imaging technique using SPECT and a multi-detector
row CT integrated system, which is now commercially
available (8, 14, 15). The registration between 99mTc-GSA
SPECT and CE-CT images is considered to be satisfactory,
and able to estimate the remnant liver function and the
congested area precisely based on the LUV.
In HVC, remnant hepatocytes are regarded as
compensating for the functional loss during the initial stages
after hepatectomy (16-18). However, little is known
regarding the exact nature of the effects of HVC on the

regional and remnant hepatic functions. The aim of the
present study was to clarify the impact of HVC on regional
and remnant hepatic functions using the 99mTc-GSA
SPECT/CE-CT fused imaging technique.
Patients and Methods
Between January 2011 and December 2014, 333 patients underwent
99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT examinations for the perioperative
evaluation of hepatectomy, mainly for liver cancer. We selected the
patients who underwent segmentectomy or more and performed
99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT examinations on them prior to surgery
and then again at 7 days after surgery. The presence or absence of
a congested area was assessed using the method described below.
The primary endpoint was a comparison of liver function per unit
volume in the congested and non-congested areas. Secondary
endpoints included the influence of HVC on postoperative liver
function and the postoperative course. Blinded evaluation of
functional scintigraphic and functional CE-CT imaging was
performed by separate radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians
(M.Y. and S.S.). Based on the hepatic function on postoperative day
7 and the criteria established by the International Study Group of
Liver Surgery (19), we determined whether postoperative liver
failure actually occurred in these patients. Data were prospectively
collected. This study was approved by our Institutional Review
Board (approval number: 1383), and informed consent was obtained
from all patients.
Liver resection. Liver resection was performed using our previously
described techniques (15, 20). A suitable extent of liver resection
was selected according to the indocyanine green (ICG) retention
rate at 15 min (ICG R15) and functional volumetry by 99mTc-GSA
SPECT/CE-CT images (21). If the estimated congested area was
extensive, then venous preservation or reconstruction was planned.
Detection of HVC. Hepatic regions drained by hepatic vein
tributaries were calculated on the basis of preoperative CE-CT
imaging using the Ziostation2 workstation (ZIOSOFT, Tokyo,
Japan). In previous studies (3, 4). HVC has been recognized as the
attenuation difference area on arterial and hepatic portal phase CT
images (Figure 1). We confirmed that the hepatic attenuation
difference area calculated from postoperative CE-CT imaging
obtained on postoperative day 7 was the same as the hepatic vein
tributaries calculated from preoperative CE-CT imaging on the
workstation. Patients were divided into two groups: the group with
congestion who had definite postoperative HVC and the non-HVC
group who did not have postoperative HVC.
CT volumetry. The region of interest was manually set for the whole
liver on each image of every slice; regions without any tumors were
included (8, 20). We measured the whole liver and simulated remnant
CTv from preoperative CE-CT images and the remnant CTv from
postoperative CE-CT images. Moreover, in the HVC group, the
simulated remnant volumes of the congested and non-congested areas
were also measured on the basis of the surgical procedure and hepatic
portal/venous tributaries from preoperative CE-CT imaging.
Functional volumetry by 99mTc-GSA scintigraphic imaging. A
SPECT/CT system was used for scintigraphy and CT imaging,
respectively (22). 99mTc-GSA (185 MBq) was injected as a bolus
into an antecubital vein. The image parameter of SPECT image is
summarized in Table I. The attenuation-corrected SPECT and CT
images were analyzed using a dedicated workstation (Ziostation2;
ZIOSOFT, Tokyo, Japan). Whole-liver and simulated remnant LUVs
were calculated from the preoperative 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT
images, and the remnant LUV was obtained from the postoperative 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT images (8). Moreover, in the HVC
group, we calculated the simulated LUV of the congested and noncongested areas on the basis of the surgical procedure and hepatic
portal/venous tributaries from preoperative CE-CT imaging.
According to the attenuation difference on postoperative CE-CT
images, we separately measured the LUV of these areas. To evaluate
apparent effects of HVC on regional function, the LUV/CTv was
calculated using pre-and postoperative 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT
images. Furthermore, in the HVC group, the LUV/CTv of the
congested and non-congested areas were independently measured.
Finally, we calculated the functional ratio between the congested
and non-congested areas using the following formula:
Functional ratio=(LUV/CTv of congested area)/(LUV/CTv of noncongested area)
Statistical analysis. Values are expressed as mean±standard
deviation (range). To examine variations in the parameters within
any two groups, a two-way analysis of variance in multiple
comparisons was used. Values between any two groups were
compared using the Mann–Whitney U-test, and correlations were
analyzed using the Pearson test. Statistical analysis was performed
using the JMP statistical software package (version 11; SAS, Cary,
NC, USA). p-Values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
Initially, out of the 333 patients, 65 who underwent
segmentectomy or more were selected. A total of 11 patients
were diagnosed as having impaired blood flow; however,
three patients were excluded because they had accidental
congestion in the remnant liver. They experienced partial
outflow block with or without inflow block. Finally, 62
patients were divided into two separate groups: an HVC
group comprising eight patients in whom the trunk of the

main hepatic vein had been sacrificed and the non-HVC
group comprising 54 patients without transection of the main
hepatic vein trunk. A typical case with HVC is shown in
Figure 1. The perioperative clinical characteristics of patients
are summarized in Table II. In the HVC group, six out of the
eight patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one had
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and one had a large
hemangioma. In the non-HVC group, 41 out of the 54
patients had HCC, seven had liver metastasis, five had
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and one had a large
hemangioma. Segmentectomy, monosectionectomy, and
disectionectomy or more were performed on two, none, and
six patients in the HVC group and two, 26, and 26 patients
in the non-HVC group, respectively. There were no statistical
differences in the preoperative hepatic functional tests,
hepatic fibrosis, and surgical insult between the two groups.
Effects of HVC on regional hepatic functional volume. In the
HVC group, the simulated CTv of the congested and noncongested areas before hepatectomy was 172.1±70.7 cc and
711.6±210.2 cc, respectively, and 124.9±60.7 cc and
837.1±231.4 cc, respectively, after hepatectomy. Before
hepatectomy, the LUV/CTv of the HVC and non-HVC groups
was 0.043±0.017%/m2/cc and 0.043±0.012%/m2/cc,
respectively, but the differences were not significant (p=0.96).
After hepatectomy, the remnant LUV/CTv of the nonHVC group was 0.052±0.018%/m2/cc. In the HVC group,
LUV/CTv of the congested and non-congested areas was
0.029±0.008%/m2/cc and 0.050±0.019%/m2/cc, respectively
(Figure 2). There were no significant differences between
the remnant LUV/CTv of the non-HVC group and that of
non-congested areas in the HVC group (p=0.96). In
contrast, the remnant LUV/CTv of the congested areas was
significantly smaller than that of the non-HVC group
(p<0.01). The remnant LUV/CTv of the congested areas
was smaller than that of the non-congested areas, but the
difference was not significant (p=0.07). The functional ratio
was 0.47±0.05, and all of the recorded data were ≥0.39
(Figure 3).
Postoperative liver failure. There were no surgery-related
deaths within the 3 months after the surgery. According to
the criteria (24), on postoperative day 7, 16 out of the 62
patients experienced postoperative liver failure, including
three (38%) out of the eight patients and 13 (24%) out of
the 54 patients in the HVC and non-HVC groups,
respectively. In the HVC group, one patient had grade A,
one had grade B, and one had grade C postoperative liver
failure. In the non-HVC group, nine patients had grade A,
three had grade B, and one had grade C postoperative liver
failure. The frequency of all grade liver failure was similar
in both groups (p=0.22), whereas that of grades B and C
was higher in the HVC group than in the non-HVC group,
but the difference was not significant (p=0.24).

Figure 1. Patient 1 underwent extended left hepatectomy (S5). In the arterial (a) and portal (b) phases, venous congestion is seen in the anterior
section. On 99mTc-labeled-galactosyl-human-serum-albumin (99mTc-GSA) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CE-CT) fused imaging (c), radioactivity was lower in the congested area than that in the non-congested area.

Discussion
In the present study, we focused on patients with planned
HVC and estimated the liver function of the congested area
was approximately 40% that of the non-congested area.
Although the function of the congested area can be
calculated using the 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT system,
currently this system is not widely used. In contrast, in
patients with planned HVC, future congestion volume is
easily simulated before surgery as a perfusion area of the
sacrificed hepatic vein from preoperative CE-CT imaging in
the dedicated workstation. Considering that the functional
ratio of the congested area was approximately 40% or more,
it is immediately possible to calculate the limit of safe liver
resection volume. If the liver function of the congested area
is calculated as 0%, then the remnant liver function can be
estimated to be smaller than actual liver function.
In congested areas, the venous blood was regurgitated to
the portal vein through the sinusoid and portal blood supply
was reduced (3, 25). In a completely congested area, the
blood can flow into the hepatic artery and out of the portal
vein, instead of the hepatic vein (25). Decreased GSA uptake
in the congested area is caused by a decrease in the portal
blood supply. The degree of HVC might be related to that of
hepatic dysfunction at the very early postoperative stages.
Moreover, the congested area can develop venous collaterals
into the remnant hepatic venous system during the course of
postoperative regeneration (25). In this study, the functional
ratio was distributed within a narrow range of 0.39-0.52.
On intra-operative ICG fluorescence imaging,
Kawaguchi et al. found the hepatic function in the
congested areas in HVC was reduced to 40% compared
with that in the non-congested areas (26). This imaging
modality can evaluate the liver function of the congested
area in HVC immediately after hepatic vein occlusion.
Surprisingly, their functional ratio of 40% for the congested
area was identical to that of our study. ICG fluorescence
imaging was difficult to perform before hepatectomy and
was captured only on the liver surface in their study,
whereas 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CE-CT can be performed
before hepatectomy and can evaluate the entire liver. We
recommend that these two methods be used in a
complementary manner. In contrast, upon using
gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine penta-acetate
magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI), the hepatic
function in the congested segment was reduced to 70%
compared with that in the non-congested segment (27). In
that study, the liver to muscle ratio was compared between

of the groups with and without hepatic venous congestion (HVC) on
postoperative day 7. No significant differences were observed between the
remnant LUV/CTv of the non-HVC group (0.052±0.018%/m2/cc) and that
of non-congested areas (0.050±0.019%/m2/cc) in the HVC group (p=0.96).
On the other hand, the remnant LUV/CTv of the congested areas
(0.029±0.008%/m2/cc) in HVC was significantly smaller than that of the
non-HVC group (p<0.01) and was also smaller than that of the noncongested areas in HVC, but the difference was not significant (p=0.07).

non-congested area and whole HVC segment. The HVC
segment included both congested and non-congested areas:
therefore, the hepatic function was estimated to be better
than actual liver function. Although EOB-MRI was useful
for detecting the tumor, a functional assessment for
preoperative simulation was not completely established (27,
28). By evaluating the clinical course, several reports have
confirmed that 99mTc-GSA SPECT/CT is useful for

preoperative functional simulation and assessment of
postoperative functional liver regeneration (8, 11, 15).
In the HVC group, there was a relatively higher incidence
of postoperative liver failure; therefore, HVC might be a
factor responsible for this medical complication. Not much
attention has been paid to the role of HVC at the time of
preoperative decision making regarding liver resection. In
this study period, we made minor changes to the extent of
liver resection intraoperatively. Considering the relationship
between HVC and portal blood supply, the effect of HVC
on regional hepatic function might not be mild. Impaired
portal blood supply substantially reduces regional hepatic
function (7). The subsequent lack of portal blood supply
impairs early postoperative liver function and regeneration
of the liver remnant (4-6). In this study, three patients
experienced liver failure. Considering the latent risks
involved in hepatectomy, we recommend venous
reconstruction or portal vein embolization in patients with
an insufficient functional reserve (29, 30). In patients with
noninvasive HCC, the preservation of the hepatic vein is
also possible.
There exist some limitations to the present study. Firstly,
this was a retrospective study performed at a single academic
center. The population included a small number of patients
with HVC. Therefore, the results obtained need further
confirmation by large multicenter studies. Secondly, the
degree of HVC varied among cases on postoperative day 7
because of the degree of the formation of intrahepatic
collaterals between obstructive and non-obstructive veins.
Thirdly, we did not evaluate the relationship between HVC
and other risk factors of postoperative liver failure, such as
preoperative chemotherapy, blood transfusion, postoperative
complications, and postoperative external biliary drainage
(31, 32). These may be related to both hepatic functional
recovery and postoperative liver failure.
We conclude that hepatic function per unit volume in the
congested areas was approximately 40% of that in the noncongested areas. For preoperative simulation, a more
accurate estimation of the future remnant liver volume may
be obtained by calculating the sum of the volume of the
congested area multiplied by 0.4 and the volume of the noncongested area.
