Abstract
Ischemia/reperfusion injury occurring during liver transplantation is mainly due to the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) upon revascularization. Thus, delivery of antioxidant enzymes might reduce the deleterious effects of ROS and
improve liver graft initial function. Mangafodipir trisodium (MnDPDP), a contrast agent currently used in magnetic
resonance imaging of the liver, has been shown to be endowed with powerful antioxidant properties. We hypothesized that
MnDPDP could have a protective effect against liver ischemia reperfusion injury when administrated to the donor prior to
harvesting. Livers from Sprague Dawley rats pretreated or not with MnDPDP were harvested and subsequently preserved
for 24 h in CelsiorH solution at 4uC. Organs were then perfused ex vivo for 120 min at 37uC with Krebs Henseleit solution. In
MnDPDP (5 mmol/kg) group, we observed that ATP content was significantly higher at the end of the cold preservation
period relative to untreated group. After reperfusion, livers from MnDPDP-treated rats showed better tissue integrity, less
hepatocellular and endothelial cell injury. This was accompanied by larger amounts of bile production and higher ATP
recovery as compared to untreated livers. The protective effect of MnDPDP was associated with a significant decrease of
lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis. Interestingly, MnDPDP-pretreated livers exhibited activation of
Nfr2 and HIF-1a pathways resulting in a higher catalase and HO-1 activities. MnDPDP also increased total nitric oxide (NO)
production which derived from higher expression of constitutive NO synthase and lower expression of inducible NO
synthase. In conclusion, our results show that donor pretreatment with MnDPDP protects the rat liver graft from cold
ischemia/reperfusion injury and demonstrate for the first time the potential interest of this molecule in the field of organ
preservation. Since MnDPDP is safely used in liver imaging, this preservation strategy holds great promise for translation to
clinical liver transplantation.

Introduction
Liver transplantation has been established as the most effective
and durable therapy for end-stage liver disease [1]. Although the
clinical results have improved dramatically, initial graft dysfunction still occurs in a significant number of liver recipients [2,3].
Early graft failure remains a serious concern because it is
associated with higher morbidity and early retransplantation rates,
the latter significantly affecting long-term survival [4].
The ability of a graft to recover normal functions after
reperfusion depends on its intrinsic quality before procurement
(i.e. donor’s factors), on the clinical status of the recipient, on the
implantation period and more importantly on the preservation
conditions. Ischemia and subsequent reperfusion are unavoidable
causes of graft injury in the current practice of organ transplantation and represent a major risk factor for graft dysfunction [5,6].
This multifactorial and interdependent damage process has
become even more significant with increasing use of marginal
grafts to meet the current growing demands [7]. Hence,
developing strategies to minimize ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
injury could potentially have an enormous impact on transplant
outcomes and support safer use of less than ideal organs [8].
In liver transplantation, the detrimental effects of I/R are
mainly due to the acute generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) following the reoxygenation process at time of revascularization [9]. Although low concentrations of ROS have an
important role as mediators in normal cellular metabolism and
signal transduction [10], in higher concentrations they are
responsible for tissue damage. Indeed, overproduction of reactive
molecules can initiate a cascade of deleterious cellular responses
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50235

leading to inflammation, cell death and eventually organ failure
[9]. A complex endogenous defense network, called the antioxidant system, has been developed in mammals to keep these
hazardous products at a tolerable level. During a severe ischemic
insult, this natural defense mechanism is however overwhelmed by
the large amounts of ROS produced.
A large number of membrane and extracellular antioxidant
agents have been tested experimentally to counterbalance the
endogenous enzymatic depletion and improve liver graft initial
function [11–15]. Other strategies used intracellular antioxidants
components with controversial results [10,16–18]. Overall, none
of these strategies have found the way into routine clinical practice.
Hence, the use of antioxidant agents with a long half-life and
targeting both intra and extracellular sites might be more efficient
to protect against the oxidative stress that is imposed to the liver
allograft during the transplantation procedure.
Mangafodipir trisodium (MnDPDP), a magnetic resonance
imaging contrast agent, is currently used for liver imaging,
especially for the detection of liver neoplasm. Recently, it has
been demonstrated that this molecule was endowed with powerful
antioxidant properties with a high level of liver intracellular
penetration [19–22]. In vitro, MnDPDP displays superoxide
dismutase-like, catalase-like and glutathione reductase-like activities, allowing both detoxification of mitochondrial ROS and
regeneration of the GSH pool [19]. Preventive administration of
MnDPDP was associated with significant liver injury decrease in a
mouse model of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure [19].
More recently, the same group confirmed the protective properties
of MnDPDP using a mouse model of hepatic I/R injury [23].
Besides, it has been reported that MnDPDP decreases myocardial
damage in ischemic porcine myocardium [20–22]. In this case,
MnDPDP improved the contractile function and reduced enzyme
release in rat heart tissues during reoxygenation [20]. Another
study showed that MnDPDP prevented myocardial cell damages
through modulation of lysosomal and mitochondrial pathways
[24]. However, the cellular mechanisms behind the protective
effect of MnDPDP in the liver are currently unknown.
In the present study, by using an isolated perfused rat liver
model, we demonstrated that MnDPDP administration to the
donor shortly before liver harvesting also exerts a beneficial effect
against cold I/R injury. Donor pretreatment leads to the
maintenance of liver energetic status, attenuation of oxidative
stress, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, as well as an
enhancement of nitric oxide production. This protective effect is
also associated with the activation of Nrf2 and HIF-1a pathways.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Mangafodipir (MnDPDP), also marketed as TeslascanH, was
supplied from Nycomed Amersham Health (Amersham, UK).
CelsiorH preservation solution was purchased from Genzyme
(Saint Germain en Laye, France). All chemicals were from Sigma
(Saint Quentin, Fallavier, France).
Ethics Statement
Experiments were conducted according to the European Union
regulations (Directive 86/609 EEC) for animal experiments and
complied with our institution’s guidelines for animal care and
handling. Animal studies described herein were reviewered and
approved (agreement no. 35–16 delivered to Dr. Anne Corlu, 06/
08/2010) by the Directeur de´partemental des Services Ve´te´rinaires de la Pre´fecture d’Ille et Vilaine (Rennes, France). Surgical
procedure was conducted under general anesthesia and all animals
were sacrificed by exsanguination upon liver procurement.
Animals and Experimental groups
In this study, we used an isolated perfused rat liver model which
is a useful experimental system for evaluating hepatic functions
without the influence of other organ systems, undefined plasma
constituents and neural-hormonal effects. Moreover, hepatic
architecture, microcirculation and bile production are well
preserved in this experimental model [13,25].
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150 to 200 g
(Janvier, Le Genest-St-Isle, France) were used in this study.
Animals had ad libitum access to water and a standard diet. Rats
were divided randomly into three groups: i) Control group
(control, n = 6), ii) ischemia/reperfusion group (I/R, n = 6) and iii)
MnDPDP+ischemia/reperfusion group (MnDPDP+I/R, n = 6 for
each tested dose). In control group, livers were harvested from
untreated rats, flushed with Ringer’s lactate solution and
immediately connected (without cold storage) via the portal vein
to a recirculating perfusion system for 120 min at 37uC. Rats from
I/R group received 1 ml of sodium chloride solution intraperitonealy 20 minutes prior to liver harvesting. After 24 hours of
cold storage in CelsiorH solution, livers were flushed with Ringer’s
lactate solution and immediately connected via the portal vein to a
recirculating perfusion system for 120 min at 37uC. Rats
belonging to MnDPDP+I/R group received 1 ml of MnDPDP
intraperitonealy 20 minutes prior to liver harvesting. Three doses
of MnDPDP were tested in this study (3, 5 and 15 mmol/kg body
weight). The choice of MnDPDP concentrations was based on
clinical studies showing that 5 mmol/kg corresponded to the
relevant and safe dose for liver magnetic resonance imaging [26].
After 24 hours of cold storage in CelsiorH solution, livers were
flushed with Ringer’s lactate solution and immediately connected
via the portal vein to a recirculating perfusion system for 120 min
at 37uC.
Twelve additional rats were used to evaluate tissue content of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) prior to ex vivo perfusion. These rats
were divided randomly into three groups: i) normal liver group
(n = 4): livers were harvested from untreated rats, ii) ischemia
group (n = 4): 20 minutes after intraperitoneal administration of
1 ml of sterile sodium chloride solution, livers were harvested and
subsequently preserved for 24 h at 4uC in CelsiorH solution and iii)
MnDPDP+Ischemia group (n = 4): 20 minutes after intraperitoneal administration of 1 ml of 5 mmol/kg MnDPDP, livers were
harvested and subsequently preserved for 24 h at 4uC in CelsiorH
solution. Fragments of liver tissue were collected, frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 280uC until determination of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). This determination was only performed with
the effective dose of MnDPDP.
Liver procurement
Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a
mixture of Ketamine (90 mg/kg) and Xylasine (10 mg/kg). The
surgical technique was performed as previously reported [13,27].
Briefly, the liver was exposed through a midline incision. The
common bile duct was cannulated distally with a polyethylene tube
(PE nu50, ID 0.58 mm, Harvard Apparatus). The portal vein was
isolated and the splenic and gastroduodenal veins were ligated.
The infrarenal aorta was dissected free and cannulated (BD InsyteWH, 20G, Le Pont-de-Claix, France). Then, the supra-celiac aorta
was immediately cross-clamped, the suprahepatic vena cava was
cut off after incision of the diaphragm. The organs were washed
out via the infrarenal aorta with the ice-cold CelsiorH solution
(40 ml).

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50235

Once the liver was rinsed, the portal vein was cannulated (BD
Insyte-WH, 16G, Le Pont-de-Claix, France). Liver washout was
then completed through the portal vein (20 ml). Finally, the liver
was retrieved carefully and stored for 24 hours, floating in 100 ml
of CelsiorH solution at 4uC.
Perfusion of isolated liver
After 24 hours of cold preservation at 4uC, livers were flushed
with lactated Ringer’s solution through the portal vein. The
aliquots of the effluent flush were sampled for measurements of
cumulative alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) after prolonged
ischemia. In order to account for the period of rewarming during
surgical implantation in vivo, all livers, except those of the control
group, were exposed to room temperature (22uC) on a Petri dish
for 30 minutes prior to reperfusion [13].
Livers were then immersed in the Krebs Henseleit Buffer
(Sigma Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France) in a perfusate
chamber and connected via the portal vein to a continuous and
closed perfusion circuit built in our laboratory [28]. Livers were
reperfused for 120 min at 37uC. Time 0 corresponded to the
satisfactorily connection of the portal catheter to the circuit. The
perfusate was propelled in the circuit with a peristaltic pump
(BVP-pump, Ismatec, Zurich, Switzerland). During the first
15 minutes of perfusion (initial equilibration period), the flow
was gradually increased to reach a constant value of 3 ml/min/g
of liver [25]. After the initial equilibration period, perfusion
pressure was continuously monitored throughout the reperfusion
period [13,25]. The perfusate temperature (37uC) was regulated
by means of a thermostatically controlled bath into which the
perfusate chamber was placed [13,29]. The buffer was continuously ventilated with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture and
passed through a bubble trap prior to entering the liver [13,28].
During the 120 min of normothermic reperfusion, samples were
collected from the hepatic effluent fluid at 30 min intervals and
stored at 280uC for later analyses. Bile was collected by gravity in
graduated test tubes placed outside the thermostatically controlled
bath to avoid dilution of the bile by condensed water. Bile output
was determined at 120 min of reperfusion. At the end of the
reperfusion period, fragments of liver tissue were collected, frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC for further determinations.
Some tissue samples were placed in paraformaldehyde for
histological analyses.
Bile output
Liver function was assessed by measurement of bile production
[13]. Bile was collected through the cannulated bile duct and
output reported in ml/120 min/g liver.
Biochemical Determinations
Hepatic injury was assessed by determination of AST, ALT,
LDH and gamma-GT levels in perfusate samples [13,29] using an
automatic analyzer (Olympus automated chemistry Analyzer AU
2700). Liver function was evaluated by measurement of albumin,
alkaline phosphatase levels in perfusate samples, as well as by
determination of biliary bilirubin excretion using an automatic
analyzer (Olympus automated chemistry Analyzer AU 2700).
Hepatic ATP content after cold ischemia, as well as after
normothermic reperfusion was measured by using the bioluminescence assay kit from Sigma Aldrich (St Quentin Fallavier,
France).
Lipid peroxidation was used as an indirect measurement of the
oxidative stress induced by ROS [13]. It was determined in whole
liver homogenates by measuring the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) with the thiobarbiturate reaction [13], using the
TBARS assay kit from Interchim (Montluc¸on, France). Hepatic
catalase activity was determined by using the peroxidation
function of catalase. This colorimetric method is based on the
reaction of catalase with methanol in presence of sufficient
concentration of hydrogen peroxide (Catalase assay kit from
Interchim, Montluc¸on, France). SOD activity was measured in
liver tissues with a method utilizing a tetrazolium salt for detection
of superoxide radicals generated by xanthine oxidase and
hypoxanthine. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount of
enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of superoxide radical
(SOD Activity Detection kit from Interchim, Montluc¸on, France).
Purine Nucleotide Phosphorylase (PNP) activity was measured by
an enzymatic method described by Nakagami et al [30]. Nitric
Oxide (NO) production in liver was determined by tissue
accumulation of nitrite and nitrate, as previously reported [13].
Activity of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), a mitochondrial
enzyme that indicates mitochondrial damages, was measured
using an enzymatic method as previously described [13,30].
Western Blotting
Liver tissues were homogenized and subcellular fractions were
prepared as previously described [13,31]. Total liver lysates were
used to quantify heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), constitutive NO
synthase (eNOS), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cytochrome c,
caspase 9 and caspase 3 (total and cleaved) by Western blot.
Cytosolic fractions were used to quantify cytochrome c and
cleaved caspase 9. Mitochondrial fractions were used to determine
the cytochrome c release. Nuclear fractions were used to
determine hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and nuclear
factor-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2). Proteins were separated by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes
were immunoblotted with antibodies directed against HSC70,
HO1, Nrf2 and HIF-1a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 9,and cytochrome c (Cell
Signalling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), and against eNOS and
iNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Protein
expression was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (ECF, Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). The values were
obtained by densitometric scanning and the quantity software
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The scanning values
for HO1, eNOS, iNOS, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase 9 and 3, as
well as HIF-1a and Nrf2 were normalized with the scanning
values for HSC70, While, those for cytosolic and mitochondrial
cytochrome c were normalized by the total cytochrome c. Cleaved
caspase 3 and 9 were divided by the full length fragment of each
protein, respectively.
Histology and TUNEL Assay
For standard histology evaluation, a hematoxylin/eosin staining
was performed [31]. Damage score were estimated by counting
morphological alterations in 10 randomly selected microscopic
fields from 6 samples of each group and from at least 3
independent experiments. The morphological liver integrity was
graded on a scale of 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Grading was adapted
from t’Hart et al [32] and described as: (1) normal rectangular
structure, (2) rounded hepatocytes with an increase of the
sinusoidal spaces, (3) vacuolization, (4) nuclear picnosis and (5)
necrosis. Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL,
Roche Molecular Biochemical’s, Mannheim, Germany). TUNELpositive nuclei were counted in 10 random high power fields (640
objectives) [31]. The apoptotic index was calculated as a ratio of
Mangafodipir Protects against Ischemia/Reperfusion
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50235

the apoptotic cell number to the total cell number in each field and
was expressed as a percentage. Histological evaluation of damage
score and ratio of the apoptotic cell number were performed in a
blinded fashion by 3 different observers.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as means 6 SEM. Data were analyzed
using Graph Pad Prism software (Version 4.0; Graph Pad, San
Diego, CA). Statistical analysis was performed by variance analysis
(Kruskal-Wallis test), followed by Mann-Whitney U test when the
overall comparison of groups was significant. p,0.05 was
considered as significant.
Results
MnDPDP protects against hepatic damage and maintains
liver function
After 24 h of cold ischemia and 120 min of normothermic
reperfusion, higher levels of enzyme leakage (ALT, AST and LDH
) were observed in cold stored livers (I/R group) compared with
livers immediately perfused without cold preservation (control
group) confirming the high sensitivity of parenchymal cells to cold
ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (Figure 1 A). LDH and ALT
levels in livers of rats pretreated with MnDPDP at a concentration
of 3 mmol/kg and 15 mmol/kg were similar to those observed in I/
R group. In contrast, pretreatment with MnDPDP at 5 mmol/kg
caused a significant reduction of ALT, AST and LDH activities
when compared to I/R group (Figure 1 A). Similar patterns for
ALT, AST and LDH were observed at 30, 60 and 90 min (data
not shown). Noteworthy, no statistical difference was found for
cumulative ALT, AST and LDH release in flushing effluent
between I/R group and MnDPDP-treated group at the end of
cold ischemia (data not shown). In all experimental conditions,
Gamma GT levels were below to the threshold detection.
Importantly, the MnDPDP dose-effect relationship was correlated
with hepatocellular functional recovery upon reperfusion as
indicated by higher bile production, biliary bilirubin excretion,
albumin and alkaline phosphatase production in pretreated rats
with MnDPDP at 5 mmol/kg or 15 mmol/kg compared to I/R
group (Figure 1). MnDPDP administration at 3 mmol/kg did not
improve liver function. Based on hepatocellular damage and
functional parameters, the maximal protective effect of MnDPDP
was obtained at the dose of 5 mmol/kg.
Histological changes following I/R were in keeping with
biochemical parameters of hepatic injury and only histological
findings with the most effective dose of MnDPDP (5 mmol/kg) are
presented in figure 2. Standard histological examination revealed
pronounced hepatocyte vacuolization and marked disintegration
of hepatic architecture in I/R group as compared to control group
(Figure 2A), the damage score being significantly different between
the two groups (3.560.2 vs 1.260.1, p,0.05) (figure 2B).
Hepatocyte integrity was better maintained in 5 mmol/kg
MnDPDP pretreated livers than in I/R group. Hepatocyte in
MnDPDP+I/R group appeared at most rounded with an increase
of the sinusoidal spaces, with a damage score significantly lower
relative to I/R group (2.160.2 vs 3.560.2, p,0.05) (Figure 2).
Altogether, these observations led us to evaluate the mechanisms
Figure 1. Mangafodipir limits the enzyme leakage and improve
liver function. (A) Alanine amino transferase (ALT), Aspartate amino
transferase (AST) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were
measured in liver perfusates at the end of normothermic reperfusion
(T = 120 min). (B) Bile production was assessed in livers along the
120 min of normothermic reperfusion. Biliary Bilirubin excretion (C)
perfusate Albumin (D) and alkaline phosphatase (E) levels were
determined at the end of normothermic reperfusion. Control group:
untreated rat livers immediately submitted to 120 min of normothermic
reperfusion; I/R group: liver procured from vehicle (NaCl) pretreated
rats, cold stored for 24 h at 4uC and submitted to 120 min of
normothermic reperfusion; MnDPDP+I/R group: livers procured from
3, 5 or 15 mmol/kg MnDPDP-pretreated rats, cold stored for 24 h at 4uC
and submitted to 120 min of normothermic reperfusion. Results were
expressed in UI/L. * p,0.05: either I/R or MnDPDP+I/R versus Control; +

by which MnDPDP protects livers against the deleterious effects of
I/R injury only at the effective dose of 5 mmol/kg.
MnDPDP preserves liver energy status following cold
preservation and normothermic reperfusion
As shown in figure 3A, lower amounts of ATP were observed in
24 h-cold stored livers (Ischemia group) when compared to nonpreserved livers (normal livers). Similarly, ATP recovery after
120 min normothermic reperfusion was lower in livers that had
been cold stored for 24 h in celsiorH solution (I/R group)
compared to control group (figure 3B).
In contrast, depletion of ATP content was significantly
attenuated in MnDPDP pretreated livers at the end of cold
preservation relative to ischemia group (1.1060.16 mmol/mg liver
vs 0.3260.09 mmol/mg liver, p,0.05) (Figure 3A). Also,
MnDPDP pretreatment improved ATP recovery at the end of
the normothermic reperfusion period compared with I/R group
(0.2360.06 vs 0.0760.02 mmol/mg liver, p,0.05) (Figure 3B).
MnDPDP protects against hepatic apoptosis and
mitochondrial injury
Cold ischemia followed by 120 min of normothermic reperfusion was associated with an increased number of apoptotic liver
cells as demonstrated by the higher percentage of TUNEL-positive
hepatocytes when compared to control group (Figure 4A and B).
This observation was correlated with an increased release of the
cleaved forms of caspase-3 (19 and 17 kDa) in I/R group relative
to controls (Figure 4C). Interestingly, a significant reduction in cell
TUNEL staining and cleaved caspase-3 levels was evidenced when
MnDPDP was administered to liver donors (Figure 4). To further
evaluate the mechanisms leading to liver cell injuries, we also
investigated mitochondrial damage. Cold ischemia followed by
120 min of normothermic reperfusion led to significant (p,0.05)
increases of GLDH activity (Figure 5A), cleavage of caspase-9
(Figure 5B) and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into
cytoplasm (Figure 5C and D). MnDPDP pretreatment improved
mitochondrial integrity as evidenced by the lower increase of
GLDH activity, caspase-9 cleavage and cytochrome c release
compared to the liver of I/R group (p,0.05).
MnDPDP protects against oxidative stress
Lipid peroxidation has been used as an indirect marker of ROSinduced hepatic damage. As shown in Figure 6A, MDA levels
were significantly increased in I/R group when compared to
control group (131612.4 mg/mg protein vs 2467 mg/mg protein,
p,0.05). Increase of MDA levels in liver rats pretreated with
MnDPDP was significantly reduced (77.867.9 mg/mg protein)
compared to I/R group (131612.4 mg/mg protein, p,0.05).
Pretreated livers also exhibited a significant higher catalase activity
(213646.5 mmol/min/mg protein) when compared to values
found in I/R group (61.7612.6 mmol/min/mg protein)
(Figure 6B). SOD activity level was similar between MnDPDPpretreated and unpretreated group (Figure 6C). In parallel, rat
pretreatment with MnDPDP significantly increased liver HO-1,
HIF-1a and Nrf2 expressions compared to observed levels in livers
from I/R group (figure 6D–F).
MnDPDP protects endothelial cells and favors nitric oxide
production
ROS injury to the endothelial cells was detected by quantification of PNP. As shown in figure 7A, rat livers from I/R group
released significant higher levels of PNP into the perfusate
compared with control group. MnDPDP pretreatment
(MnDPDP+I/R group) partially prevented PNP release relative
to I/R group (Figure 7A). The effect of MnDPDP on Nitric Oxide
(NO) production which reflects the nitrite and nitrate contents in
liver tissues was also evaluated. As expected, hepatic NO level was
decreased in I/R group compared to the control group (Figure 7B).
By contrast, a higher level of NO production was observed in livers
of rats pretreated with MnDPDP in comparison to levels observed
in I/R group. This increase in NO production was well correlated
with the constitutive NO synthase (eNOS) expression level
(Figures 7C). Conversely, the expression of inducible NO synthase
(iNOS) was induced in livers of I/R group compared to control
group and MnDPDP pretreatment partially prevented this
increase (Figure 7D).
Discussion
Ample evidence suggests that the generation of ROS is critical
in the pathogenesis of I/R injury [9]. Despite the mainly vascular

origin of the post-ischemic oxidant stress, ROS generated by
Kupffer cells or adherent neutrophils is responsible for a
substantial intracellular oxidant stress in hepatocytes. This suggests
that intracellular defense mechanisms are critical for detoxification
of ROS generated by intracellular as well as extracellular sources
[31–33].
In this study, using an isolated perfused rat liver model, we
demonstrate for the first time that MnDPDP protects the rat liver
from cold I/R injury when administrated to the donor prior to
liver harvesting. MnDPDP pretreatment at concentration of
5 mmol/kg improved graft function, lessened hepatocellular as
well as endothelial injury and allowed a better-preserved liver
integrity. This protective effect was associated with attenuation of
oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. These
observations are of interest since the efficient concentration of
5 mmol/kg corresponded to the relevant and safe dose used in the
clinical setting for liver magnetic resonance imaging [26].
Moreover, MnDPDP pharmacogical and pharmacokinetic properties favor high level of liver intracellular penetration. This
property is related to the fodipir moiety of MnDPDP, a chelate of
manganese resulting from the condensation of two pyridoxal 59-
phosphate molecules [21]. This fodipir moiety binds to the
pyridoxal 59-phosphate receptor on hepatocytes and ensures a
high intrahepatic concentration of MnDPDP through its specific
biding to vitamin B6 receptors expressed by hepatocytes [23].
The role of the cell membrane is to maintain the cell structure
and communication lines to the extracellular compartment. The
release of intracellular enzymes into the perfusate closely reflects
the leakiness of the cell membrane and, therefore, indirectly
predicts the degree of organ damage [34,35]. A study on
transmembranous ion exchange by means of magnetic resonance
spectroscopy has also shown that injury of the hepatic cell
membrane play an important role in graft dysfunction [36]. In our
study, pretreatment with 5 mmol/kg of MnDPDP reduced the
release of transaminases and LDH in the course of normothermic
reperfusion and was also associated with a better histological
integrity, suggesting lower parenchymal injury.
Accordingly, MnDPDP administration also led to a greater
capacity of bile production relative to untreated rats and
correlated to the lesser hepatic damage. In the isolated perfused
liver model, bile production is widely considered as a reliable
marker of global liver function [25,34]. It is a complex process that
requires both the preservation of the ultrastructural, biochemical
and physiological integrity of the liver [34]. It is noteworthy that
bile secretion is an active mechanism that closely rely on Na+/K+
ATPase activity [37], indirectly reflecting the ability of hepatocytes
to synthesize ATP [38]. ATP represents an indispensable energy
source to the cell for the maintenance of its structural and
functional integrity. It has been shown that ATP depletion in
hepatocytes leads to an increase in cytolytic protease activity [39].
In our study, we showed that improvement of post-ischemic bile
flow in MnDPDP-pretreated livers was consistently associated with
higher tissue ATP content after cold ischemia, as well as after
normothermic reperfusion. Indeed, MnDPDP administration
limited the depletion of ATP reserves after cold ischemia as
compared to untreated animals. In the clinical setting, it has been
shown that liver ATP content before implantation was an
independent predictor of initial graft function [9,40,41].The
potential of MnDPDP to enhance liver energy metabolism may
be related to its efficiency in carrying and releasing manganese

ions to the hepatocytes in a time shorter than the plasmatic
clearance. Manganese is an essential element required in living
organisms both as an activator and a constituent of several
enzymes. In addition, the active form of ATP implies the presence
of magnesium and manganese. Manganese is a cofactor of
mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant enzyme that
scavenges oxygen free radicals [42] and is involved in a major
metabolic pathway such as the electron transport system. While
cold storage by itself is known to induce Ca2+ uptake that causes
an inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, it could be also
expected that the presence of Mn2+ at low doses after MnDPDP
dissociation may efficiently antagonize several adverse effects of
Ca2+ on mitochondria.
A well-known mechanism of cell death induced by extracellular
ROS is lipid peroxidation. Since polyunsaturated fatty acids in the
cell membrane are vulnerable to lipid peroxidation, this free
radical-mediated process leads to liver cell death very rapidly [43].
In our conditions, MnDPDP pretreatment prevented lipid
peroxidation as indicated by significant lower MDA levels in
MnDPDP-pretreated livers when compared to levels found in I/R
group. This effect supports an antioxidant action of MnDPDP in
the post-ischemic liver tissue. Using different models of stress,
previous studies indicate that a protective effect of MnDPDP is
associated with catalase-, SOD- and GSH reductase-like properties, allowing this compound to act at multiple steps of the ROS
cascade [19,20,22,23]. It has also been suggested that MnDPDP
protects leukocytes from apoptosis induced either by H2O2 or by
chemotherapeutic agents like oxaliplatin and paclitaxel [44], and
prevent Huh-7 hepatoma cell death induced by H2O2 and
superoxide anion [19]. In our conditions, there was no difference
in SOD and GSH reductase activities (data not shown) between
livers procured from MnDPDP-pretreated rats and unpretreated
ones. However, MnDPDP-pretreated livers exhibited a higher
catalase activity that may be responsible, at least in part, for the
beneficial effects against oxidative stress. Interestingly, it has been
demonstrated in animal models, that an increase of catalase
activity significantly suppresses the subsequent I/R-induced acute
liver injury [45]. Moreover, like various macromolecular subFigure 4. Mangafodipir prevents liver cells apoptosis.

stances, catalase represents a new class of therapeutic agents that
has been examined for various ROS-mediated injuries, especially
those associated with I/R [45]. In our conditions, the protection
against oxidative stress might also be explained by the capacity of
MnDPDP to increase the expression of Nrf2, HIF-1a and HO-1.
On one hand, Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant response element in
the promoter region of numerous genes encoding antioxidative
and phase 2 enzymes, including HO-1, NAD(P)H: quinone
oxidoreductase 1, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase. Phase 2 enzymes play a major role in the detoxification of
ROS during I/R [46]. On the other hand, HIF-1a triggers an
increase in gene expression involved in glycolysis, glucose
metabolism, mitochondrial function, cell survival and resistance
to oxidative stress. Induction of HO-1 has also been implicated in
numerous clinically relevant disease states and I/R injury [47–49].
It has been suggested that this enzyme exerts anti-oxidative, antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions [50]. Interestingly both
transcriptional factors can activate HO-1. Overall, the protective

effect of MnDPDP could be related to the activation of Nrf2 and
HIF-1a pathways that lead to the induction of HO-1, catalase,
glutathione reductase activities and improvement of liver functions.
The effectiveness of MnDPDP in reducing I/R injury possibly
involves other undefined mechanisms. Sinusoidal endothelial cells
(EC) have been described as the least tolerant non-parenchymal
hepatic cells to I/R injury and represent the initial target of
oxidative and inflammatory mediated damages [51]. Hepatic EC
are particularly vulnerable to cold ischemia which induces serious
morphological alterations such as retraction, cell body detachment, and sinusoidal denudation. EC dislocation is responsible for
impaired graft microcirculation, platelet activation and adhesion
molecules up-regulation. Cytoskeleton disorders also contribute to
Kupffer cell activation, neutrophil infiltration, and finally hepatocyte death upon reperfusion. Moreover, there is a direct
correlation between EC injury and length of cold ischemia, graft
function and, above all, long term outcome after liver transplantation [52]. Notably, our present data suggest that pretreatment of
donor with MnDPDP improved the tolerance of liver EC to I/R
injury, as reflected by significant lower levels of PNP release into
the perfusate. PNP being primarily localized in the cytoplasm of

the endothelial cells, its release by the preserved livers indicates a
lysis of those non-parenchymal cells. PNP release has been shown
to be inversely related to sinusoidal EC viability and also reflect the
oxidative stress intensity of livers subjected to I/R injury [52].
Although the mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, a
direct EC protective effect by the MnDPDP and/or an indirect
effect mediated through improved microcirculation are plausible.
MnDPDP was also described to stabilize and conserve nitric
oxide (NO) generated in intact EC, thus protecting them against
I/R injury [26,53]. NO is produced from L-Arginine by nitric
oxide synthases (NOS) that exists in both inducible (iNOS) and
constitutive (eNOS) forms. A low concentration of NO produced
by eNOS may serve to maximize blood perfusion, promote cell
survival and protect liver against I/R injury [54] while a sustained
expression of iNOS might become detrimental through an
increase of toxic ROS, leading to liver injury [54,55]. In the
present study, we observed that MnDPDP increased total NO
production, as evidenced by the nitrite/nitrate levels. This increase
of NO levels could be beneficial in our condition since it was
associated with a higher expression of eNOS and a lower
expression of iNOS in MnDPDP-pretreated livers. Moreover,
our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that the
generation of ROS is needed along with NO to confer organ
protection after ischemic preconditioning. In our condition, NO
production after MnDPDP treatment was associated with a
moderate ROS generation relative to controls.
To further elucidate the mechanisms by which MnDPDP
conferred liver protection against I/R injury, we also evaluated
apoptotic cell death and mitochondrial damage. Apoptosis has
been identified as a hallmark of I/R-induced graft damage
[56,57]. The mitochondrial cytochrome c release into the cytosol
is known as an early molecular event of apoptosis in response to
oxidative load in the mitochondria [31,58]. It further induces
caspase 9 activation that in turn leads to the activation of the
effector caspase 3, a downstream event in the apoptotic cascade
[59]. Under our conditions, we could notice that MnDPDP
pretreatment was associated with a decrease of hepatocyte
apoptosis as evidenced by a significant reduction in the percentage
of TUNEL positive hepatocytes, as well as a decrease of cleaved
caspase-3 levels compared to those observed in untreated livers. In
addition, the administration of MnDPDP to the donor improved
mitochondrial integrity. Indeed, GLDH activity, cleaved caspase-9
level and cytosolic cytochrome c release were significantly reduced
whereas mitochondrial cytochrome c amount was significantly
increased when MnDPDP was administered to the donor prior to
liver harvesting. Taken together, our data suggest that mitochondria might also be an important target through which MnDPDP
exerts its cytoprotective effect. Our findings support previous data
regarding protective effects of MnDPDP on cardiac dysfunction
after reperfusion [22,60] and liver injury [19,23] through
prevention of mitochondrial apoptotic cascade and caspase-3
activation.
In conclusion, donor pretreatment with MnDPDP is effective
for protecting the liver from post-ischemic reperfusion injury. It
confers protection through attenuation of ATP depletion, oxidative stress, apoptosis and endothelial cells as well as mitochondrial
damages. This is the first study showing the potential interest of
this molecule in the field of organ preservation. Since MnDPDP is
safely used in liver imaging for many years, this preservation
strategy holds great promise for translation to clinical liver
transplantation. Further investigation in large animal model of
liver transplantation will be required to elucidate the relevance of
MnDPDP, for clinical liver transplantation.
