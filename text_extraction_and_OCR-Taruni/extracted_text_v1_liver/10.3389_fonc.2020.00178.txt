Objective: Neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Lymphocyte mononuclear cell ratio (LMR),
and Platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) can be used as various prognostic factors for
malignant tumors, but the value of prognosis for patients with adenocarcinoma of the
esophagogastric junction (AEG) has not been determined. This study used meta-analysis
to assess the value of these indicators in the evaluation of AEG prognosis.
Methods: Relevant literatures on the prognostic relationship between NLR, LMR, PLR,
and AEG was retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Wanfang data, and Chinese National
Knowledge Infrastructure. The search time from database establishment to June 30,
2019. The language is limited to English and Chinese. Data was analyzed using Stata
15.0 software.
Result: Six retrospective studies were included, five of them involved NLR and six
of them involved PLR. No LMR literature that adequately satisfied the conditions was
retrieved. Increased NLR was significantly associated with a significant reduction in
overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), or disease specific survival (DSS) in
patients with AEG [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.545, 95% CI: 1.096–2.179, P < 0.05]. Subgroup
analysis showed that NLR had significant value in the prognosis of both Chinese and
Non-Chinese patients (P = 0.009 vs. P = 0.000). NLR had significant prognostic value
for ≥3 and <3 groups (P = 0.022 vs. P = 0.000). NLR has a significant prognostic value
for samples ≥500 and <500 (P = 0.000 vs. P = 0.022). NLR and OS/CSS/DSS single
factor meta-regression showed that regional NLR cut-off values and sample size may
be the source of heterogeneity in AEG patients (all P < 0.05). There was no significant
association between elevated PLR and OS in patients with AEG (HR = 1.117, 95% CI:
0.960–1.300, P > 0.05). PLR had no significant prognostic value for both Chinese and

UK patients (P = 0.282 vs. P = 0.429). PLR had no significant prognostic value for ≥150
group and <150 group (P = 0.141 and P = 0.724). No significant prognostic value was
found in either the 300 group and <300 group (P = 0.282 vs. P = 0.429).
Conclusion: Preoperative NLR rise was an adverse prognostic indicator of AEG.
High-risk patients should be treated promptly. The results showed that PLR was not
recommended as a prognostic indicator of AEG.

INTRODUCTION
Esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancer mainly refers to cancer
whose center of the malignant tumors is within 5 cm of the
proximal and distal ends of EGJ, including EGJ distal esophageal
adenocarcinoma, cardiac cancer, and proximal gastric cancer
(1). In recent years, trend of EGJ cancer is increasing yearly
in Europe, the United States, and many Asian countries (2–6)
and has become a worldwide problem that seriously endangers
human health (7). The adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric
junction (AEG), first proposed by Siewert (8) in 1999, is a tumor
with unique clinicopathological features and biological behavior.
AEG lymph node metastasis has a high incidence and a low longterm survival rate, affecting the prognosis of patients seriously
(9, 10).
Effective markers are screened to identify high-risk
patients and helpful for the individualized treatment and
prognosis improvement of AEG. Xu et al. (11) reported
that log odds of positive lymph nodes can predict the
prognosis of patients with Siewert type II AEG. Felismino
et al. (12) believes that the prognosis of locally advanced
esophagogastric cancer can be determined by pathological
staging and primary site. Kudou et al. (13) believes that
postoperative sarcopenia can be used as a prognostic
indicator for AEG, but these indicators are postoperative.
Unfortunately, effective preoperative biomarkers are
still lacking.
Laboratory indicators may be used as prognostic indicators
for gastrointestinal tumors (14, 15), including: neutrophil to
lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR),
lymphocyte monocyte ratio (LMR), Glasgow prognostic score
(GPS), and Prognostic nutritional index (PNI). Although some
studies have reported the relationship between these indicators
and the prognosis of patients with AEG, a consensus has not
been reached. Urabe et al. (14) indicated that preoperative
NLR and PLR is associated with OS and DFS in patients
with AEG. Zhou et al. (16) postulated that preoperative
LMR and PLR are very useful predictors for AEG surgery;
but Zhang et al. (17) reported that preoperative NLR can
be used as prognostic factor for Siewert type II/III AEG
patients, but PLR value is limited. The present study aims
to evaluate the value of NLR, LMR, and PLR in evaluating
the prognosis of patients with AEG through systematic
review and meta-analysis and to provide evidence-based
supporting the use of these markers as prognostic indicators
of AEG.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature Search Strategy
Search for the relationship between NLR, PLR, LMR, and
AEG prognosis or clinicopathological features in databases
such as PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Wanfang data,
and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. The search
time frame for database establishment was till June 30, 2019.
Search terms included: “NLR,” “PLR,” “LMR,” “esophagogastric
junction cancer,” and “AEG.” The language was limited to English
and Chinese.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria: (1) Patients confirmed pathologically as AEG;
(2) Assessed preoperative NLR, PLR, or LMR overall survival
(OS), disease-free survival (DFS), tumor-specific survival
(relationship between cancer specific survival (CSS), or disease
specific survival (DSS); (3) Reported hazard ratio (HR) and 95%
confidence interval (CI) or indirect calculation HR and 95%
CI. If HR could not be directly extracted from the literature, we
calculated it by formula. Our calculation formula is b = In (HR),
stderr = b/inverse-normal-distribution (P/2), 95% CI = exp (b
± 1.96 ∗stderr). (4) Full text in English or Chinese.
Exclusion criteria: (1) HR and 95% CI cannot be obtained
directly or indirectly, NLR, PLR, or LMR have no clear cut-off
point; (2) Non-research literature such as review, case report,
conference summary, etc.; (3) Animal research or basic cell
research; (4) Repeated published literature, research literature on
the same cohort study subjects.
Test Screening and Data Extraction
We conducted this study in accordance with the systematic
reporting and preliminary analysis items (18) (preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses,
PRISMA). Since all data are based on published literature, this
study does not address any ethical issues. Two reviewers (Liu and
Zhang) read the title and abstract independently in a doubleblind manner, excluded non-compliant studies, read full-text
documents that met the inclusion criteria, and cross-checked
the included articles. In case of differences and discussions, an
independent third party was asked to decide. Data extraction
content was based on: title, author, region, publication time,
sample size, critical value, HR, and 95% CI of OS, DFS, CSS,
or DSS.

Quality Evaluation
The quality of the included studies was assessed using
the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS).
NOS consists of three aspects: selection, comparability,
and exposure or outcome; a total score of 9 points,
and a total score of ≥6 in the study is considered high
quality (19).
Statistical Methods
Meta-analysis was performed using Stata statistical software
(Stata Corporation, version 15.0, College Station, TX, USA).
HR and 95% CI were combined in the study to evaluate the
value of NLR, PLR, and LMR in predicting the prognosis of
patients with AEG. A meta-analysis forest map that plots the
effect indicators. The Q-test and I2 of the chi-square test were
used to evaluate the heterogeneity between studies. I2and Qtests were used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the included
research questions. If I2 <50% and P-test of P > 0.1, it indicates
that the studies are homogeneous and a fixed effect model is
selected; P < 0.1, indicating that there is heterogeneity between
studies, and a random effect model was selected (19, 20). To
find the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were used
to explore sources of heterogeneity. The publication bias was
assessed by Egger test and Begg test. When P < 0.05, the

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Included Literature
According to the above strategy, a total of 20 articles were
screened and finally included in six articles (Figure 1), all of
which were retrospective studies. Five of which involved NLR
and six of which involved PLR. The information on the literature
included in this study (Table 1).
Meta Analysis Results
The Prognostic Role of NLR in AEG
Five studies have analyzed the relationship between NLR
and OS/CSS/DSS in patients with AEG, and a significant
heterogeneity exists among these studies (P < 0.05, I2 = 91.6%),
and random effects model was used. These results indicate that
an increase in NLR decreases predicts OS/CSS/DSS shortening in
patients with AEG (HR = 1.545, 95% CI: 1.96–2.179, P < 0.05,
Figure 2).
The Prognostic Role of PLR in AEG
Six studies analyzed the relationship between PLR levels and OS
in patients with AEG. There was no significant heterogeneity
between the studies (P = 0.198, I2 = 31.7%), so a fixed effect
model was used. The results showed that PLR was not suitable
as an OS judgment index for AEG patients (HR = 1.117, 95%
CI: 0.960–1.300, P > 0.05, Figure 3). Two studies analyzed the
relationship between PLR levels and DFS in patients with AEG.
There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (P =
0.050, I2 = 74.0%), and random effects model was used for
analysis. The results showed that PLR was not suitable as a
predictor of DFS in patients with AEG (HR = 1.90, 95% CI:
0.92–3.92, P > 0.05, Figure 4).
Subgroup Analysis Results
Heterogeneity Between NLR Studies
A subgroup analysis of heterogeneity sources between
OS/CSS/DSS studies of NLR and AEG patients. NLR had
significant value in the prognosis of patients in China and
Non-China (P = 0.009 vs. P = 0.000, Figure 5); China group
had significant heterogeneity (P = 0.000), but Non-China
group did not have significant heterogeneity (P = 0.884). NLR
had significant prognostic value for cutoff value ≥3 group
and <3 group (P = 0.022 vs. P = 0.000, Figure 6); ≥3 group
had significant heterogeneity (P = 0.000), <3 group was not
significant heterogeneity (P = 0.294). NLR had significant
prognostic value for samples ≥500 group and <500 group (P =
0.000 vs. P = 0.022, Figure 7), ≥500 group had no significant
heterogeneity (P = 0.294), while <500 group had significant
heterogeneity Sex (P = 0.000). The results are presented in
Table 2.
Heterogeneity Between PLR Studies
A subgroup analysis of heterogeneity sources between OS
studies of PLR and AEG patients. There was no significant
heterogeneity in the China group (P = 0.591) (Figure 8),
and there was significant heterogeneity in the UK group
(P = 0.024). PLR had no significant prognostic value for
Cutoff value ≥150 group and <150 group (P = 0.141 vs.
P = 0.724, Figure 9); there was no significant heterogeneity
between the two groups (P = 0.133 and P = 0.443). PLR
had no significant prognostic value for ≥300 group and <300
group (P =0.282 vs. P =0.429, Figure 10); ≥300 group had
no significant heterogeneity (P = 0.591), <300 group was
significantly heterogeneous Sex (P = 0.024). The results are
presented in Table 3.
NLR shows a significant prognostic value in Chinese and
non-Chinese patients. A significant heterogeneity was also
observed in the Chinese group but not in the non-Chinese
group. Meta-regression analysis was conducted to determine the

factors that might cause heterogeneity. The variables included
region and sample size. NLR and OS/CSS/DSS meta-regression
analysis showed that the region might be the source of
AEG heterogeneity.
Meta-Review Analysis
To find factors that may cause heterogeneity, we used metaregression analysis, the variables included region, cut-off value,
and sample size. The NLR and OS/CSS/DSS single factor metaregression showed that the region, cut-off value, and sample
size were all possible reason. It is the source of heterogeneity in
patients with AEG (all P < 0.05, Table 4).
Risk of Bias
Begger’s test and Egger’s test were used to evaluate the published
bias, and the results showed that the NLR published bias test
(PBegg = 0.806 vs. PEgger = 0.141) revealed no significant bias.
DISCUSSION
Infection may involve the entire process of tissue carcinogenesis,
directly or indirectly affecting its development (26). Systemic
inflammatory response is associated with the inhibition of
apoptosis, angiogenesis and DNA damage, leading to tumor
progression and metastasis (27). Although the mechanism
between hematological parameters and tumors remains

unclear, their correlation can be explained by infiltrating
immune cells and inflammatory proteins (28). A tumor
microenvironment contains many different mediators.
Neutrophils promote tumor development (29), cytokine
production, and provide a microenvironment for tumor
survival. Neutrophils can promote the production of a variety
of inflammatory cytokines, providing a good microenvironment
for tumor survival and proliferation. On the contrary,
lymphocytes play an important role in tumor-specific
immune response.
As an independent factor, the effect of chronic inflammation
on gastrointestinal cancer has been demonstrated (30). The
level of NLR may reflect the inflammatory state of the body.
Neutrophils can promote tumor growth and progression by
increasing the concentration of some inflammatory substances,
such as vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-6, and
IL-1 (31, 32).
In addition, increased neutrophils inhibit the lysis activity
of some cells, such as lymphocytes, natural killer cells and
activated T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes play an immunity-related
role in tumors. Cytokines released and their mediated cytotoxic
by lymphocytes can inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis.
However, cytokines produced by cells can lead to lymphocyte
depletion and decrease the anti-tumor effect of lymphocytes. As

a result, the risks of recurrence and metastasis are increased,
leading to poor prognosis (33).
Relative lymphocyte reduction may reduce lymphocytemediated anti-tumor cellular immune responses. Platelet
aggregation promotes adhesion and aggregation of circulating
tumor cells, which enhances the ability of tumor cells to
escape immune attack (34). In addition, activated platelets
release more vascular endothelial growth factor and a variety
of cytokines, thereby increasing the angiogenesis of tumor
tissue and ultimately promoting its growth (35, 36). Therefore,
in the current situation of the lack of more reliable tumor
prognostic indicators, NLR and PLR may provide information

on patient prognosis. It is currently known that NLR and/or
PLR may be associated with a variety of tumor prognosis,
including non-digestive tumor NSCLC (37), breast cancer (38),
ovarian cancer (39), Hodgkin lymphoma (40), prostate cancer
(41), cervical cancer (42), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (28), and

PLR for AEG. The meta-analysis showed that NLR can be
used as a prognostic indicator for patients with AEG, but PLR
may not be suitable for the OS and DFS of patients with
AEG as indicators. Similarly, NLR has significant prognostic
value in each subgroup, but PLR has no significant prognostic
difference in each subgroup. NLR and OS/CSS/DSS univariate
meta-regression showed that regions, NLR cutoffs, and sample
sizes may be sources of heterogeneity in patients with AEG,
while PLR and OS/CSS univariate metasindicate that the regions,
cutoffs, and sample sizes are not possible sources of heterogeneity
in patients with AEG. Despite great efforts to obtain relevant
research, some data that are not published online are still not
available. Hence, more studies should be included in the later
stage to reduce heterogeneity.

This study has the following limitations. First, despite we
were very cautious about the literature included to draw our
conclusions, the number of included studies is not large and
covers only Chinese and English literature. Second, the selected
literatures are retrospective studies, lacking a prospective cohort
study, may result in analytical bias. Third, other inflammatory
conditions have not been discussed in the original study.
Inflammatory control samples from patients without AEG are
not included. Fourth, whether the stage of the tumor will affect
the outcome is unknown. We also tried to further determine
a possible effect through the subgroup analysis. However, on
the basis of the available data, the subgroup analysis cannot
be completed. Relative to more emergence, we can conduct
additional analysis to further the value of NLR and PLR for
AEG in different stages. Finally, meta-analysis is an observational
study that may be limited by raw data bias and defects.
NLR is an inexpensive, easy-to-access, and multi-examination
index. It is also an expected index for patients with AEG.
This indicator helps identify high-risk patients and determine
treatment plans. However, given the above limitations, NLR
should be carefully used as a marker before it is recommended
for clinical applications. The value of NLR in the prognosis of
AEG should be verified before it is applied to clinical decisionmaking, and the value of PLR and LMR in AEG is worth
further exploration.
