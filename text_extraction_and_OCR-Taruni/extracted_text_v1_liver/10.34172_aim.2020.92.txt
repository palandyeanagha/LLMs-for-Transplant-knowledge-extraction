Abstract
The coronavirus associated disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has rapidly spread all around the world 
and became pandemic in March 2020. Data on liver transplantation and chronic liver disease during the pandemic has remained 
scarce, and there is little information on whether immunosuppressed patients are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 
infection. This review provides information for health care providers who care for patients with liver transplantation and chronic 
liver diseases.

Introduction
The COVID-19 infection was first reported in Wuhan 
in December 2019.1 This infection is caused by a novel 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and became pandemic in 
March 2020.2 In the previous two months, Iran has 
witnessed more than 88000 patients with positive 
respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and a 
case-fatality rate of nearly 6% as of April 24, 2020.3 The 
transmission of this disease occurs via human-to-human 
contact, and the major mode of spread is through droplets.4
The most common symptoms are fever, fatigue and dry 
cough and some present with shortness of breath, diarrhea, 
nausea and vomiting.5,6 Some preliminary data has shown 
that severe disease is related to older age, hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.7
Given the presence of the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in the liver and biliary epithelial 
cells, the liver can be a potential target for COVID-19 
infection.8-10 One of the presentations of this disease is 
elevation of liver enzymes which is mostly seen in patients 
who have been admitted in the hospital with an incidence 
ranging from 14% to 53.1%.11,12 COVID- 19 infection 
may worsen liver function in patients with underlying 
chronic liver diseases.13 The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) has stated that patients older than 
65 years, and those with liver diseases are at higher risk of 
fatal disease.14
Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus infection and 
unknown behavior of this disease, there are debates 
regarding management of chronic liver diseases and 
patients with liver transplantation during the COVID-19 
pandemic. In this review, we aimed to provide data about 
COVID-19 and its effects on hepatologists, liver transplant 
providers and their patients. 
COVID-19 and Liver Diseases
In those without a history of liver disease, the COVID-19 
infection and simultaneous rise in ALT or decrease in 
serum albumin and platelet count were associated with 
higher mortality rate.6
These laboratory data abnormalities may be 
due to preexisting liver disease, inflammation or 
hypercoagulopathy due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Cirrhosis as a cause of immune system dysfunction is a 
risk factor for infection.15
The chronic hepatitis B virus infection seems not to affect 
the outcome of COVID19.5 The effect of chronic hepatitis 
(hepatitis B or C) infection on exacerbation of liver injury 
due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is still unknown.16 It is 
recommended that treatment of hepatitis B and C should 
be continued in those who have already been on treatment 
and do not have COVID-19.17 Initiation of treatment for

Taher et al 
hepatitis B and C is not recommended in patients with 
COVID-19, unless there is a high suspicion for severe 
acute hepatitis.17
The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical 
and biochemical course of cholestasis in patients with 
underlying cholestatic liver disease such as primary biliary 
cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis is not well 
known with recent available data.12
Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may be at increased risk of severe 
COVID-19 infection as a result of metabolic syndrome 
and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and 
obesity).18
In patients with autoimmune hepatitis, 
immunosuppressive agents should be continued 
unless drug side effects or severe viral infection occur. 
However, the impact of steroid prescription in patients 
with autoimmune hepatitis and COVID-19 on disease 
prognosis remains unclear12 (Table 1).
Liver Transplantation and COVID-19
Before Transplantation
During a period of 23 years, 4485 liver transplantations 
were performed in six centers in Iran. Of these, 4106 were 
from deceased donors and 379 from living donors.19 Liver 
transplantation in the Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex 
affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences, was 
started in 2002 and 1057 liver transplantations were 
performed until January 2020.20
However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, liver 
transplantation is more challenging. All transplant centers 
should assess their local circumstances and their effect on 
patients on the waiting list.
There is currently little information on the transmission 
of SARS-CoV-2 from organ donors, but most organ 
transplant centers recommend that all organ donors be 
tested for SARS-CoV-2 and removed from the donation 
list if the test is positive.21
A national consensus in Iran was developed by several 
representatives of organ transplantation teams organized 
by the ministry of health and medical education updated 
in April 21, 2020. The most important points of this 
consensus are:
•	 Liver transplantation should be performed for 
patients with a Model for End-stage Liver Diseases 
(MELD) score more than 20. Other candidates are 
patients with acute or acute-on-chronic liver failure. 
Patients with significant complications of chronic 
liver disease (e.g. high-grade hepatic encephalopathy, 
gastrointestinal bleeding or recurrent cholangitis) 
should be also considered for liver transplantation.
•	 On the day of liver transplantation, all transplant 
recipients should be screened for the COVID-19 
infection. Medical history and physical examination, 
CBC with differentiation, CRP and chest CT scan 
and PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 should be done for 
all patients. A consultation with an infectious diseases 
specialist must be requested.
•	 All deceased donors should be assessed for SARSCoV-2 by chest CT scan and PCR-based tests 
obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal 
sample. A consultation with an infectious diseases 
specialist should be performed for all organ donors.
•	 History of recent contact with suspected or confirmed 
Table 1. Patient Care in Patients with Chronic Liver Disease and Liver Transplant during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
Patients Considerations 
Patients with compensated 
liver disease
•	 Use telemedicine visits as much as possible.
•	 The risk of severe COVID-19 does not increase with viral hepatitis.
•	 Due to comorbidities in NAFLD/NASH patients (hypertension, diabetes), the risk of severe COVID-19 may 
increase.
•	 Patients with autoimmune hepatitis should not change the immunosuppressive therapy.
•	 We can consider delaying surveillance of HCC and screening for varices.
Patients with 
decompensated liver 
disease waiting for liver 
transplantation
•	 Limiting liver transplantation listing to patients with MELD score more than 20 and patients with life-threatening 
complications.
•	 All transplant recipients should be evaluated for COVID-19 by history and physical examination, CBC with 
differentiation, CRP and chest CT scan and PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on the day of liver transplantation.
•	 Emphasis on importance of influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination.
•	 All deceased donors should be assessed for SARS-CoV-2 by chest CT scan and PCR-based tests obtained from 
bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal sample.
•	 Transplantation from all deceased donors with a history of serious contact with a patients with or suspected of 
COVID-19 in the previous 2 weeks should be canceled.
After liver transplantation
•	 Minimizing health care providers' exposure through the use of telemedicine.
•	 Advise against reducing immunosuppression.
•	 In patients with COVID-19, minimize the steroid dose; in the setting of lymphopenia and progressive pneumonia, 
discontinue azathioprine, mycophenolate and CNIs.
•	 If using ritonavir, the dose of tacrolimus should be decreased given the strong drug-drug interaction.

COVID-19 and Chronic Liver Disease and Liver Transplantation 
cases of COVID-19 in the past two weeks should be 
evaluated in all deceased donors and transplantation 
should be canceled if such a contact exists.22
We should notify patients that the COVID-19 pandemic 
may increase their waiting time on the transplant list. We 
should also advise all potential recipients to avoid attending 
crowd places and keep social distance in the society. It is 
not necessary to ask patients to update their MELD score 
frequently (Table 1).
After Transplantation
Post-transplant patients should not travel during the 
COVID-19 pandemic and must take preventive measures 
like frequent hand washing, cleaning touched surfaces, 
avoiding large crowds and staying away from individuals 
who are sick. 
We should conduct medical rounds with the lowest 
number of staff and the shortest time needed to care 
for patients after liver transplantation. Walk-in-clinic 
visits should be minimized by more frequent telecommunication, and elective procedures must be 
deferred.23
Studies have shown that immune response is the 
basis of pulmonary injury caused by COVID-19 and 
immunosuppression may have a protective effect.24,25
Immunosuppressive drugs after liver transplantation have 
not been shown to be a major risk factor for mortality due 
to SARS (2002–2003) and MERS (2012–present).25
A recent report from a liver transplant center in Italy 
showed that all COVID-19-related deaths pertained to 
patients on minimal long-term immunosuppression after 
liver transplantation rather than recently transplanted, fully 
immunosuppressed patients.26 Metabolic complications 
after liver transplantation play a more important role 
than immunosuppression in the development of severe 
COVID-19 in patients with liver transplantation.5
Immunosuppression can prolong viral shedding in liver 
transplanted patients with COVID-19.23,27 Nevertheless, 
immunocompromised patients have higher viral titers 
and may be more infectious than immunocompetent 
individuals.23
Due to the risk of acute rejection, we should not reduce 
immunosuppression, even mycophenolate mofetil, in posttransplant patients without symptoms of COVID-19. 
However, in post-transplant patients with COVID-19, we 
consider the lowest effective dose of steroid but keep it 
sufficient to prevent adrenal insufficiency.
In patients with lymphopenia, fever or progressive 
pneumonia related to COVID-19, we should consider 
minimizing rather than discontinuing the dose of 
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and calcineurin 
inhibitors.
We can initiate high-dose immunosuppressive therapy 
in patients with or without COVID-19, only if there is a 
strong indication (e.g. acute rejection) (Table 1).17
Hepatocellular Carcinoma and COVID-19
The impact of COVID-19 on hepatocellular carcinoma 
is unknown. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are 
not at higher risk for severe COVID-19 related to their 
malignancy status.28
During the COVID-19 pandemic, monitoring of HCC 
in patients on or off therapy and surveillance of HCC 
in those at risk of HCC (e.g., cirrhosis and hepatitis B) 
should be continued. We should discuss risks and benefits 
of delaying surveillance of patients, although a delay up to 
two months may be acceptable.
Discussion on diagnosis and treatment of HCC should 
be performed in a virtual tumor board with liver transplant 
surgeons, hepatologists and interventional radiologists 
and HCC treatment should not be delayed due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.17
Diagnostic Procedures in Patients with Chronic Liver 
Disease
Endoscopic procedures are considered aerosol-generating. 
Physician should decide to do some procedures based 
on their impact on treatment. Liver biopsy may be done 
as a tool to rule out rejection or diagnose autoimmune 
hepatitis. Therapeutic paracentesis, transjugular 
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and/or endoscopy for 
variceal bleeding, follow-up band ligation, and urgent 
biliary drainage for symptomatic disease such as cholangitis 
and sepsis could be performed.29
Upper and lower endoscopy could be done but the 
endoscopists should wear N95 masks (as opposed to 
surgical masks) and use two gloves.30
In pandemic conditions, screening programs for varices 
should also be postponed to another time.31
Decision for performing ERCP for post-transplant 
biliary strictures should be individualized based on the 
severity of stricture and its complications and possibility 
of transmission of virus to health care providers.
Liver biopsy is recommended only in patients whose 
treatment plan may affect prognosis as in the case 
of suspicious autoimmune hepatitis and increase in 
aminotransferases levels more than 5 times the upper limit 
of normal.
Generally, in patients with COVID-19, liver biopsy 
could be postponed because of the risk of infection and 
histology changes due to infection.
Pharmacologic Management of COVID-19 and Drugdrug Interactions in Patients with Chronic Liver 
Diseases and Liver Transplantation
There is currently no approved drug to prevent or 
treat COVID-19. Many investigational therapies for 
COVID-19 may be hepatotoxic. 
Ritonavir/ Lopinavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, 
which is involved in the metabolism of calcineurin 
inhibitors, everolimus and sirolimus. Using ritonavir, the 

716 Arch Iran Med, Volume 23, Issue 10, October 2020 
Taher et al 
tacrolimus dose should be decreased to 1/20 to 1/50 of 
baseline given the strong drug-drug interaction. Sirolimus 
should not be prescribed with ritonavir/ lopinavir.32
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an analogue of 
chloroquine with a better safety profile, has anti-SARSCoV-2 activity in vitro.
33 HCQ can potentially increase 
the level of calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors. 
So, the serum level of these agents should be monitored 
carefully.33 HCQ therapy has not been associated with 
ALT changes and is an extremely rare cause of acute liver 
injury.18
Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue with activity 
against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vitro, and recently 
against SARS-CoV-2.34,35 This drug has had promising 
outcomes in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe 
COVID-19 in some studies.36-38 Remdesivir can increase 
aminotransferases and should be avoided in patients with 
ALT more than 5 times the upper limit of normal.17 There 
is no clinically significant interaction between remdesivir 
and immunosuppressive agents32 (Table 2). 
In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously 
and widely affected healthcare resources throughout the 
world. All efforts are being made to minimize the risk of 
health care providers’ exposure to SARS-CoV-2, so that 
they can provide adequate care for patients with chronic 
diseases, including patients with chronic liver diseases. 
The pandemic has affected patients waiting for liver 
transplantation because of the possibility of transmitting 
the infection from donor and donor shortage. One of 
the major challenges of liver transplant programs now is 
how to deal with the increase in mortality of patients in 
the waiting list due to organ shortage if the fight against 
COVID-19 becomes prolonged.
This article could guide physicians to help their 
chronic liver disease patients to reduce the impact of the 
COVID-19 infection on their underlying disease and give 
them the best care they could. This pandemic is spreading 
rapidly and these recommendations will need to evolve 
with acquisition of new data.
