Introduction
Glucose is the predominant form of circulating sugar in animals, 
while sucrose, the disaccharide composed of equal portions of glucose and fructose, is the predominant circulating sugar in plants. 
As plants form the basis of the food chain, herbivores and omnivores are highly adapted to use sucrose for energetic and biosynthetic needs. Because fructose does not circulate at high levels in 
animals, ingested fructose may be uniquely positioned to convey 
signals related to sugar consumption. Therefore, understanding 
mechanisms by which fructose is sensed may be of consequence 
for understanding the adaptive physiology of sucrose metabolism 
as well as potential pathophysiological consequences of excessive 
sugar consumption.
Sugar in the form of sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup, 
both of which are composed of nearly equal amounts of glucose 
and fructose, is added to numerous manufactured food products. 
Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a major source of added 
sugar in diets worldwide and include sodas, fruit-flavored drinks, 
and sport drinks. On average, SSBs contribute approximately 7% 
of daily calories (1) and nearly 50% of added sugars in the diet 
(2). Although trends in SSB consumption have declined in recent 
years, almost 66% of US youths still consume at least one SSB per 
day (3). Other major contributors to added sugar intake include 
candy and desserts, contributing approximately 4% to 9% of daily 
energy intake depending on age (2, 4).
Whether increased sugar consumption is a major contributor 
to the epidemics of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease remains controversial (5–7). While the relationships 
between some measures of dietary sugar exposure and cardiometabolic risk factors are inconsistent, greater SSB consumption consistently associates with indices of higher cardiometabolic risk (5). 
Several large meta-analyses associate increased SSB consumption 
with increased body weight, and much, though not all, of this 
increased weight is likely due to increased total energy consumption (5, 8). SSBs may increase cardiometabolic risk by increasing 
visceral adiposity, which accounts for much of the weight gain. A 
recent prospective study showed that daily SSB consumers had a 
29% greater increase in visceral adipose tissue volume over 6 years 
compared with nonconsumers (9). A causal association is supported by evidence that intake of 1 liter of SSB daily for 6 months 
increased visceral and liver fat, but increases were not observed in 
those consuming isocaloric semiskim milk, noncaloric diet soda, or 
water (10). While increased visceral adiposity is a major cardiometabolic risk factor, SSBs may increase risk independently of adiposity. For instance, daily SSB consumption is associated with an 
unhealthy metabolic profile across BMI strata and with increased 
risk for type 2 diabetes independently of obesity (11, 12).
Hypertriglyceridemia is a major cardiovascular risk factor and 
is another mechanism by which SSBs might increase cardiovascular risk. Few large cross-sectional studies have examined the risk of 
dyslipidemia with SSB intake, and these studies show that dyslipidemia prevalence increases with higher SSB intake (13, 14). One prospective study reported that consuming more than 1 soft drink per 
day increased the odds of developing hypertriglyceridemia by 25% 
over 4 years compared with consuming less than 1 soft drink per 
day (15). Moreover, two recent prospective cohort studies showed 
that daily SSB consumption was associated with approximately 
25% greater risk of developing coronary heart disease in both men 
and women compared with nonconsumers (13, 16).
SSB consumption also associates with hypertension, another 
major cardiovascular risk factor. A recent meta-analysis found a 
modest 12% increase in hypertension risk among the highest SSB 
consumers compared with the lowest (17). Thus, SSB intake may 
contribute to hypertension, but it may play a lesser role in this risk 
factor compared with other cardiometabolic risk factors.
On the basis of short-term overfeeding studies conducted 
predominantly in animals, the fructose component of SSBs and 
added sugar appears to be particularly harmful. Feeding animals 
large amounts of fructose can rapidly produce multiple features 
of the metabolic syndrome, including obesity, dyslipidemia, fatty 
liver, hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes (18, 19). Some, 
but not all, short-term dietary intervention studies in humans 
also demonstrate that overfeeding fructose, but not glucose, can 
increase visceral adiposity, postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, and 
insulin resistance, and effects on specific traits may be impacted by 
gender (20, 21). One concern with such studies is that the amount 
Increased sugar consumption is increasingly considered to be a contributor to the worldwide epidemics of obesity and 
diabetes and their associated cardiometabolic risks. As a result of its unique metabolic properties, the fructose component 
of sugar may be particularly harmful. Diets high in fructose can rapidly produce all of the key features of the metabolic 
syndrome. Here we review the biology of fructose metabolism as well as potential mechanisms by which excessive fructose 
consumption may contribute to cardiometabolic disease.

carbohydrate nutrients and a known transcriptional regulator of 
TXNIP (37), also regulates intestinal GLUT5 expression and is 
required for systemic fructose tolerance (38). In the future, it will 
be interesting to determine whether variability in the expression 
or function of GLUT5 or its regulatory factors contributes to the 
variability in fructose absorption in humans.
Intermediary fructose metabolism
Fructose concentrations in peripheral plasma are typically about 
0.04 mM, can acutely increase 10-fold after fructose consumption, and return to fasting levels within 2 hours (39–41). This rapid clearance is mediated in large part by efficient extraction by 
the liver. Whereas the liver extracts only 15% to 30% of an oral 
glucose load, it is capable of extracting 70% of an oral fructose 
load (42, 43). Following fructose ingestion, plasma fructose can 
achieve low millimolar concentrations in the portal vein accompanied by peripheral circulation levels of approximately 0.2 mM, 
indicating that peripheral fructose concentrations rarely exceed 
the high micromolar range (44).
The SLC2A2 glucose transporter, also known as GLUT2, has 
lower affinity for fructose (Km = 11 mM) than GLUT5 (45). GLUT2 
is a minor contributor to intestinal fructose transport (45), whereas it is likely a major contributor to hepatic fructose uptake, since 
GLUT5 is not robustly expressed in the liver (46, 47). SLC2A8, also 
known as GLUT8, may also contribute to hepatocellular fructose 
transport (48). Fructose is a poor substrate for the hepatic hexokinase glucokinase (GCK). Instead, ketohexokinase (KHK, also 
known as fructokinase) rapidly phosphorylates fructose to generate fructose-1-phosphate (F1P). KHK’s high activity and insensitivity to cellular energy status account for the liver’s ability to efficiently extract fructose. F1P is metabolized to dihydroxyacetone 
phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), which 
enter the glycolytic/gluconeogenic metabolite pools (Figure 1).
Cellular metabolic status and energy status tightly regulate the 
phosphofructokinase (PFK) step in glycolysis, which limits hepatic 
glycolytic flux (49). In contrast, fructose-derived metabolites enter 
the triose-phosphate pool distal to PFK and therefore bypass this 
restriction. As hepatic fructolysis is unrestricted, fructose loads can 
lead to large, rapid expansions in the hexose- and triose-phosphate 
pools, potentially providing increased substrate for all central carbon metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation.
The disposition of fructose-derived carbon among the major 
metabolic pathways depends on the overall nutritional and endocrine status of the animal as well as the status of key regulatory 
checkpoints in intermediary metabolism. For instance, in starved 
animals, low levels of fructose-2,6-biphosphate inhibit PFK activity and glycolysis and activate fructose-1,6-biphosphatase and glucose production (50). Thus, in a starved animal, fructose-derived 
triose-phosphates are preferentially routed through the gluconeogenic path (51, 52). The fate of ingested fructose may also depend 
on coingested nutrients. For instance, infusing physiological concentrations of fructose to fed rats and humans increases serum 
glucose and lactate levels without affecting hepatic glycogen accumulation (53, 54). However, when fructose is infused with glucose, 
which stimulates insulin secretion, marked glycogen accumulation 
occurs (55). Chronic fructose consumption can affect metabolic 
of fructose consumed often exceeds that commonly found in ad 
libitum diets. The average consumption of fructose in US populations accounts for approximately 9% of total energy intake, while 
consumers in the 95th percentile average approximately 15% of 
total energy from fructose (22). In contrast, many interventional 
studies are short in duration (less than 4 weeks) and include dietary 
intakes closer to 25% of total energy intake from fructose (23, 24).
Large randomized controlled dietary intervention studies 
assessing the effects of added sugars on cardiometabolic risk 
factors over long periods of time are lacking. Complexity, cost, 
compliance, and potential ethical issues likely prohibit the conducting of such studies. Nevertheless, some short-term interventional studies, even those within the range of “normal” fructose 
consumption, show that fructose can rapidly impair intermediate 
physiological endpoints like circulating lipids and insulin sensitivity in humans (25). Several recent reviews comprehensively discuss the physiological effects of added fructose or sugar on pathophysiological endpoints in human subjects (26, 27).
Understanding the mechanisms by which the isolated monosaccharide fructose might contribute to the development of metabolic disease may provide fundamental insights into pathogenic 
mechanisms that can be used to develop new diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic strategies. Here we will review the biochemistry and molecular genetics of fructose metabolism as well 
as potential mechanisms by which excessive fructose consumption contributes to cardiometabolic disease. We hope that lessons 
learned from improved understanding of fructose metabolism 
and fructose-induced cardiometabolic risk may also apply to other 
forms of diet-induced and genetically induced metabolic disease.
Fructose absorption
Ingested fructose is predominantly absorbed passively from the 
intestinal lumen via the hexose transporter SLC2A5, also known as 
GLUT5, which has high affinity for fructose (Km = 6 mM). GLUT5 
is highly expressed on enterocytes’ luminal membrane and is also 
expressed basolaterally (28). Deletion of Glut5 in mice reduces 
fructose absorption by 75% and causes cecum and colon dilatation 
as well as gas accumulation (29). These features are suggestive of 
fructose malabsorption, frequently cited as a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms in humans (30, 31). The intestine’s capacity to 
absorb fructose is saturable (32), and a healthy adult’s ability to 
absorb free fructose ranges from less than 5 g to more than 50 g 
(33). Unabsorbed fructose can impose an osmotic load on the distal 
small intestine and the colon, which may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms (32). Moreover, fructose can serve as a substrate for 
bacterial fermentation, leading to formation of gas and other bacterial metabolites, which can affect intestinal motility and cause 
various symptoms such as abdominal pain and bloating (34).
Intestinal GLUT5 mRNA levels and fructose transport rates 
are very low prenatally and rapidly increase with weaning independently of diet, but they can be further induced following weaning to diets containing fructose (35). Recent data showed that 
high-fructose feeding induces intestinal thioredoxin-interacting 
protein (TXNIP), which binds and regulates GLUT5-mediated 
intestinal fructose transport (36). Consistent with this, we recently showed that carbohydrate-responsive element–binding protein 
(ChREBP), a transcription factor that responds to intracellular

glucose uptake and phosphorylation, leading to rapid glycogen 
accumulation (66). F1P may also enhance glycogen synthesis by 
allosterically inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase (67, 68). Lastly, 
F1P also allosterically activates pyruvate kinase, the terminal step 
in glycolysis, contributing to increased circulating lactate levels following fructose ingestion (69). In rodent liver, hepatic F1P levels 
increase 10-fold to approximately 1 mM within 10 minutes after 
fructose ingestion and remain elevated for several hours (70). F1P 
concentrations of only approximately 200 μM are sufficient to alleviate the inhibitory effect of GCKR on GCK (71). Thus, fructose 
ingestion is likely to have rapid, robust, and sustained effects on 
hepatic glucose uptake and intermediary metabolism.
While the efficiency and rapidity with which the liver can 
extract and phosphorylate ingested fructose are likely important 
for its role in integrating nutritional and systemic fuel metabolism, 
this robust metabolism may also have deleterious consequences. For instance, decreases in intracellular free phosphate due 
to rapid hepatic fructose phosphorylation can increase uric acid 
production through activation of AMP deaminase, which leads to 
catabolism of AMP to uric acid (72, 73). Fructose feeding may also 
gene expression programs that further affect fructose disposition. 
These mechanisms will be described in greater detail below.
Although the liver metabolizes the majority of ingested fructose, the intestine itself can metabolize up to 30% of an oral 
fructose load (56, 57). All of the fructolytic enzymes are highly 
expressed in the small intestine and notably in the jejunum, where 
the highest levels of GLUT5 are observed (58). Similarly to GLUT5, 
intestinal expression of fructolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes 
including glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC) increases upon fructose 
feeding (59) and depends on GLUT5 and KHK activity (60). However, most prandial fructose is not metabolized in the intestine but 
rather passes via the portal vein to the liver (61, 62).
In addition to providing substrate for metabolic processes, 
hepatic fructose metabolism generates specific metabolites that 
also perform signaling functions (Figure 2). Importantly, F1P, the 
fructose-specific metabolite produced by KHK, exerts strong positive regulatory control on GCK by promoting its release from the 
inhibitory GCK regulatory protein (GCKR). GCKR sequesters GCK 
in an inactive state in the nucleus (63–65). “Catalytic” amounts of 
fructose, in part through activation of GCK, can promote hepatic 
Figure 1. Fructose biochemistry. Upon entering hepatocytes, fructose is phosphorylated by KHK to F1P. F1P is cleaved to DHAP and glyceraldehyde by 
ALDOB. Glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated by triose-kinase (TKFC, also known as dihydroxyacetone kinase 2 or DAK) to form the glycolytic intermediate 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P). Both fructose-derived DHAP and GA3P enter the glycolytic/gluconeogenic metabolite pool at the triose-phosphate 
level, and these metabolites have numerous metabolic fates. F1P also allosterically regulates metabolic enzymes (red and green lines) to regulate the 
disposition of fructose-derived substrate and other metabolic products like uric acid. AMPD3, adenosine deaminase; GA, glyceraldehyde; IMP, inosine

sugars are consumed. This activation enhances net hepatic glucose uptake and storage as glycogen and lipid. Interestingly, at 
supraphysiological/pathological levels, glucose itself can dissociate GCK from GCKR and may contribute to the increased hepatic 
GCK activity described in obese diabetics and in genetic models of 
obesity and diabetes (85, 86). Thus, in the setting of uncontrolled 
diabetes, the liver may aberrantly sense hyperglycemia as a state of 
increased sugar consumption. Understanding the metabolic effects 
of hepatic “sugar sensing” may be of consequence for understanding the pathophysiology of diabetes and hyperglycemia.
Genetic lessons about fructose metabolism
KHK exists as two alternatively spliced isoforms produced by 
mutual exclusion of the adjacent exons 3C and 3A within the KHK
gene (87, 88). The “A” isoform is ubiquitously expressed but has 
low activity due to relatively low affinity for its substrate (Km = 8 
mM) (89). Expression of the “C” isoform is primarily restricted to 
metabolic tissues including the liver, kidney, and intestine, and 
this isoform has much higher affinity for fructose (Km = 0.8 mM) 
(89, 90). Mice deficient in both isoforms were fully protected from 
fructose-induced metabolic disease even though blood and urinary fructose levels were markedly increased (91). Thus, elevated 
blood fructose itself is not deleterious; rather, fructose metabolism is essential for fructose-induced metabolic disease. Lossof-function mutations in KHK cause the benign human disorder 
essential fructosuria, characterized by impaired hepatic fructose 
metabolism leading to high blood and urine fructose levels after 
sucrose or fructose consumption (92). Consistent with observations in mice, there are no documented adverse health effects 
observed in people with this condition. Altogether, these results 
suggest that inhibiting KHK may be a safe therapeutic strategy to 
prevent fructose-induced metabolic disease.
In contrast with global KHK deletion, selective deletion of the 
A isoform exacerbates the adverse metabolic effects of fructose 
feeding (91). These results suggest two important hypotheses: (a) 
fructose metabolism outside of tissues that express the C isoform is 
non-negligible and contributes to whole-body fructose clearance, 
and (b) fructose metabolism within the tissues expressing KHK-C 
is critical for fructose-induced metabolic disease. This is supported 
by recent data showing that selective knockdown of KHK in mouse 
liver protects against fructose-induced steatosis (93). Recent data 
also indicate that altered splicing between KHK-A and KHK-C isoforms may contribute to the development of distinct diseases like 
hepatocellular carcinoma and heart failure (94, 95).
Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a rare autosomal 
recessive disease caused by a deficiency of aldolase B (ALDOB), 
stimulate purine synthesis, contributing to uric acid production 
(74). Increased circulating uric acid levels increase the risk of gout, 
a condition characterized by painful inflammation due to deposition of uric acid crystals in joints. Indeed, a growing body of evidence implicates sugar intake as a risk factor for gout (75). Moreover, elevated serum uric acid levels and gout are associated with 
other cardiometabolic risk factors in diverse populations (76–78). 
A substantial body of work suggests that increased uric acid levels 
may independently regulate important aspects of metabolism and 
contribute to cardiometabolic risk (79–83). However, Mendelian 
randomization studies do not strongly support a causal role for 
circulating uric acid in mediating cardiometabolic disease (84). 
The association between uric acid levels and cardiometabolic risk 
may be indirect and may reflect activation of distinct fructoseregulated processes that contribute both to uric acid production 
and cardiometabolic risk.
The liver is at a metabolic crossroads and is crucial for gauging 
nutrient consumption and integrating peripheral nutrient status 
to regulate systemic fuel storage versus provisioning. While hormones like insulin and glucagon help inform the liver of systemic fuel status, the liver is also well configured to integrate signals 
derived directly from fuel substrates. In this sense, the signaling 
properties of fructose-derived F1P, and particularly its regulation 
of GCK activity, may function as an evolved mechanism allowing 
the liver to use fructose metabolism to “sense” sugar (i.e., sucrose 
or high-fructose corn syrup) consumption. Robust physiological 
activation of hepatic GCK occurs only when fructose-containing

glucose production. These metabolic pathways contribute to steatosis, 
VLDL packaging and secretion, as well as glucose production and the generation of lipid intermediates that may affect hepatic insulin sensitivity

also acutely suppresses hepatic fatty acid oxidation (116). Thus, 
fructose contributes to hepatic triglyceride production both by 
providing substrate for fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis and by 
activating signaling systems to enhance lipid production (Figure 2).
The liver is the primary site of DNL, the process by which fatty acids are synthesized from dietary precursors, predominantly 
carbohydrates (117). Due to the differences in hepatic glucose and 
fructose metabolism, a larger fraction of diet-derived fructose 
than glucose metabolites are available for conversion to fat in the 
liver via DNL in animals and humans (20, 118–120). Additionally, fructose metabolites entering the triose-phosphate pool are in 
equilibrium with glycerol 3-phosphate, which is used to synthesize 
the glycerol backbone in triglyceride. Moreover, the metabolite 
malonyl-CoA generated via DNL limits fatty acid oxidation by 
inhibiting carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), the enzyme 
required for translocation of fatty acids into the mitochondria 
(121). CPT1A inhibition further increases the availability of fatty 
acids for triglyceride production. Triglyceride can be incorporated 
into lipid droplets, leading to steatosis, or can be incorporated into 
VLDL and secreted from the liver.
In addition to providing substrate for lipogenesis, chronic fructose consumption increases transcriptional regulation of 
DNL by activating key transcription factors, including sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and carbohydrateresponsive element–binding protein (ChREBP) (122). SREBP1c 
promotes lipid synthesis and is regulated at the transcriptional and 
posttranslational levels by nutrients and hormones. Insulin is a 
major hormonal activator of hepatic SREBP1c (123, 124). Although 
acute fructose feeding does not directly stimulate insulin secretion, chronic fructose ingestion can lead to hyperinsulinemia, 
which may increase hepatic SREBP1c expression and activation 
(125, 126). Fructose may also activate SREBP1c independently of 
insulin, since SREBP1c responds to high-fructose feeding in liver-specific insulin receptor–knockout (LIRKO) mice (125). Fructose consumption may also promote ER stress, which may induce 
proteolytic cleavage of SREBP1c and the lipogenic program (127, 
128). Fructose-induced ER stress may also enhance lipogenesis 
via activation of the transcription factor x box-binding protein 1 
independently of other lipogenic transcription factors (129).
ChREBP couples carbohydrate metabolites to lipid synthesis 
by inducing enzymes required for DNL (130). ChREBP may also 
suppress fatty acid oxidation by downregulating enzymes like 
CPT1A, in part by antagonizing peroxisome proliferator–activated 
receptor α (PPARα), a key transcriptional regulator of the fatty acid 
oxidation gene program (131, 132). ChREBP is highly expressed 
in key metabolic tissues, including liver, adipose tissue, small 
intestine, pancreatic islets, and kidney, where it regulates carbohydrate metabolism in an insulin-independent manner (37, 125, 
130). The observation that ChREBP-deficient mice are intolerant 
to diets containing fructose but not to diets containing dextrose 
suggests a specific role for ChREBP in regulating fructose metabolism (37, 133). Moreover, ChREBP activity was markedly higher 
in rats fed high-fructose compared with isocaloric high-glucose 
diets (126). We recently demonstrated that ingesting fructose, but 
not glucose, acutely and robustly induces hepatic expression of 
the potent ChREBP-β isoform along with its lipogenic, fructolytic, 
and glycolytic targets (133, 134). The mechanism by which sugar 
which is highly expressed in the liver, kidney, and small intestine 
(96). People with HFI develop abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, symptomatic hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, and potentially liver failure and death following ingestion of foods containing 
fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol (97). The precise mechanisms by 
which ALDOB deficiency causes symptoms are not entirely clear. 
An Aldob-deficient mouse model mimics the human HFI condition (98). These mice fail to thrive and die when exposed to highfructose diets. Interestingly, even on a fructose-free diet, Aldobdeficient mice develop steatosis (98), possibly due to impaired 
metabolism of endogenously synthesized fructose (99).
Endogenous fructose production
While the vast majority of metabolized fructose is derived from 
dietary sources of sugar, animals including humans are capable 
of synthesizing fructose endogenously. The sorbitol (polyol) pathway, which is active in a wide range of tissues, is responsible for 
endogenous fructose formation from glucose (100, 101). In this 
pathway, glucose is first reduced to sorbitol by aldose reductase 
(102). Sorbitol is then oxidized to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase (103). Physiologically, endogenously synthesized fructose 
is the primary energy source for sperm and may be important for 
fertility (104–106). The placenta may also synthesize sorbitol that 
the developing fetus may use to synthesize fructose, suggesting a 
broader role for endogenous fructose in reproductive and developmental biology (107).
Sorbitol pathway activity increases during diabetic hyperglycemia (108). Endogenous fructose synthesis and polyol metabolites are considered key players in the development of diabetic 
microvascular complications (109). Interestingly, semen fructose 
concentrations are increased in type 1 diabetes and in obesity, 
in which it is associated with impaired sperm parameters (105, 
110). Whether endogenous fructose synthesis might occur at sufficient rates to contribute to other aspects of fructose-induced 
cardiometabolic risk has only recently been addressed. Glucose 
dose-dependently induces aldolase reductase in human tissues, 
and chronic exposure to a high-glucose diet induces polyol pathway activation in mice (99, 111). This may be a mechanism by 
which severe hyperglycemia may exacerbate cardiometabolic 
risks. Additionally, Lanaspa et al. report that endogenous fructose 
production and KHK activation within the kidney contribute to 
the development of diabetic nephropathy (112). Although sorbitol 
dehydrogenase is expressed at high levels in human liver (113), 
whether this pathway is sufficiently active in humans to play an 
adverse metabolic role will require further investigation.
Fructose effects on lipid homeostasis
As noted above, excessive fructose consumption may have significant effects on lipid metabolism, contributing both to steatosis and to increased circulating triglyceride levels in the form of 
very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Hepatic lipid accumulation 
results from a combination of increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL), esterification of preformed fatty acids derived from the 
diet or adipose stores, decreased VLDL secretion, and decreased 
hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Activation of the lipogenic program is 
observed immediately after a single load of fructose and contributes to increased VLDL triglyceride secretion (114, 115). Fructose

metabolites activate ChREBP remains controversial but involves 
allosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphate as well as modulation 
by other carbohydrate metabolites and posttranslational modifications (135–137). ChREBP knockdown using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in fructose-fed rats reduced circulating triglyceride levels and confirmed a role for ChREBP in fructose-mediated 
dyslipidemia, although steatosis was unaffected (138). Consistent 
with this, GWAS have identified multiple common SNPs within 
the ChREBP locus associated with increased serum triglyceride 
and low HDL cholesterol levels (139, 140).
ChREBP knockdown’s selective effect on circulating triglycerides but not steatosis in the experiment described above 
highlights the fact that fat accretion in lipid droplets and VLDL 
secretion are distinct processes. ChREBP potently regulates DNL, 
and fructose-induced DNL strongly correlates with fructoseinduced hypertriglyceridemia (141). However, in steatotic human 
subjects, DNL-derived fatty acids contribute a minor fraction of 
fatty acids to VLDL (142), and the mechanistic connection between 
DNL and VLDL secretion remains uncertain. Moreover, ChREBP 
may have effects to increase circulating triglycerides independently of increasing VLDL secretion. ChREBP may transactivate expression of the apolipoprotein APOC3 as well as angiopoietin-like 8 
(ANGPTL8), both of which may inhibit lipoprotein lipase and limit 
VLDL clearance (refs. 143, 144, and Figure 3). Thus, it is possible 
that high-fructose feeding may increase circulating VLDL both by 
enhancing VLDL production and secretion and by reducing VLDL 
clearance, but the precise mechanisms remain to be determined.
PPARγ coactivator 1β (PGC1β) is a transcriptional coactivator that increases the activity of multiple key transcription 
factors, such as PPARγ, PPARα, estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), and liver X 
receptor (LXR) (145, 146). PGC1β can also 
bind SREBP1 and ChREBP and enhance 
their transcriptional activity (147, 148). 
ASOs targeting PGC1β prevented SREBP1c 
expression and lipogenesis, which in turn 
decreased lipid accumulation in fructosefed rat livers. PGC1β-targeting ASOs also 
prevented increases in adiposity, glycemia, 
and plasma insulin and triglycerides in 
fructose-fed rats. Thus, PGC1β is uniquely 
positioned to coordinately regulate both 
ChREBP and SREBP1c activities in the context of high-fructose feeding.
Increased sugar and fructose consumption is implicated in 
both simple steatosis and the progression toward more advanced 
forms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma 
(149). Important steps in DNL and VLDL synthesis occur at the ER 
membrane, and fructose-induced lipogenesis may elicit ER stress 
and the ER stress response (150). Moreover, signaling elements 
in the ER stress response may contribute to NAFLD pathogenesis and progression (151). Recent work from Zhang et al. suggests 
that ChREBP may protect the liver against fructose-induced ER 
stress and hepatic inflammation (152). However, we have recently observed that liver-specific ChREBP-knockout mice do not 
develop ER stress or hepatic inflammation when challenged with 
high-fructose diets (38). Mechanisms by which fructose may contribute to progression of NAFLD will require further investigation.
Fructose effects on glucose homeostasis
Fructose does not directly stimulate pancreatic β cell insulin secretion (153, 154). However, high-fructose feeding readily induces 
hyperinsulinemia in animal models. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia 
is more pronounced in rodent models with high-fructose compared with high-dextrose feeding despite similar increases in 
body weight and adiposity (155, 156). Similarly, hypercaloric fructose feeding increases circulating insulin in human subjects (157). 
Fructose-induced hyperinsulinemia, often considered a proxy for 
insulin resistance, might be the result of insulin resistance in some 
combination of liver, muscle, and/or adipose tissue.
The mechanisms by which high-fructose feeding causes hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance remain uncertain. 
Figure 3. Consequences of fructose overconsumption. Fructose metabolism in key metabolic 
tissues including the small intestine, liver, and 
kidney may contribute to diverse cardiometabolic 
risk factors including steatosis, increased glucose 
production, hypertriglyceridemia, increased 
adiposity, and hypertension. Fructose provides 
substrate for metabolic processes that contribute 
to cardiometabolic risk and engages cellular 
and hormonal signaling systems that regulate 
these metabolic and pathological processes. LPL,

Fructose-induced steatosis may contribute to hepatic insulin 
resistance through increased hepatic diacylglycerol accumulation, PKC activation, and impairment of insulin-mediated Akt2 
activation (158–160). However, whether steatosis itself can cause 
hepatic insulin resistance remains controversial (131, 161). In addition to ChREBP’s role in fructose-induced dyslipidemia, Erion et 
al. demonstrated that ChREBP knockdown enhanced peripheral 
insulin sensitivity in high-fructose-fed rats (138). Whether the 
improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity was directly related to the improvement in circulating lipid levels or adiposity is 
uncertain. We recently demonstrated that while hepatic ChREBP 
is essential for fructose-mediated upregulation of fructolytic, glycolytic, and lipogenic enzymes, ChREBP also mediated upregulation of G6PC, the terminal enzyme in glucose production (133). 
We showed that a fructose-induced, ChREBP-mediated increase 
in G6PC activity is a major determinant of endogenous glucose 
production. Moreover, fructose activated ChREBP and induced 
G6PC in the absence of FOXO1a, indicating that substratedriven activation of ChREBP and G6PC to enhance glucose production dominates over the suppressive effects of insulin (133). 
This ChREBP/G6PC signaling axis is also conserved in humans. 
These results are consistent with dietary intervention studies in 
humans indicating that either eucaloric substitution or hypercaloric addition of fructose may have more significant effects on 
hepatic insulin resistance than peripheral insulin resistance (157). 
However, as hyperinsulinemia itself can induce peripheral insulin 
resistance (162, 163), we speculate that chronic hyperinsulinemia 
that compensates for fructose-induced glucose production may 
subsequently lead to peripheral insulin resistance. This hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally.
Fructose effects on appetite and adiposity
Increased SSB consumption and fructose overconsumption are 
consistently associated with increased adiposity, which may be 
attributed to increased caloric intake as well as effects on energy 
balance and nutrient partitioning that are independent of caloric intake. Fructose is among the sweetest of sugars, and sweetness generally enhances food palatability. This likely contributes 
to the addition of fructose-containing sugars like sucrose and 
high-fructose corn syrup to the food supply. Enhanced palatability may increase feeding behavior and thus encourage overeating 
(164). Moreover, fructose and sucrose can enhance palatability 
and induce addiction-like behaviors such as binging and dependence in part by stimulating dopaminergic pathways (165–168). 
Distinct from fructose’s hedonic value, whether fructose impacts 
additional signaling systems to regulate appetite and feeding 
behavior has also been studied. For instance, high-fructose 
feeding may induce leptin resistance, which in turn may lead 
to increased food intake and obesity (169, 170). Additionally, 
dietary fructose decreases leptin excursions compared with isocaloric dietary glucose, and fructose is less potent than glucose 
in suppressing the orexigenic hormone ghrelin (171). In human 
subjects, fructose versus glucose ingestion has differential 
effects on hypothalamic blood flow and cerebral cortex reactivity to food cues, suggesting the possibility that fructose and 
glucose have distinct effects on brain function that may impact 
feeding behavior (172, 173). The mechanisms by which fructose 
and glucose differentially regulate appetite and feeding behavior 
remain to be determined.
Prospective studies in which excess fructose is added on top 
of habitual diets often document spontaneous reductions in other 
forms of sugar consumption, suggesting strong feedback mechanisms that specifically regulate sugar consumption (141). Such compensatory mechanisms may contribute to difficulties in accurately 
assessing dietary sugar consumption in both observational and 
interventional studies. FGF21 is a liver-derived hormone that regulates energy, glucose, and lipid homeostasis and may also participate 
in a feedback mechanism regulating macronutrient selection (refs. 
174–178 and Figure 3). Increased circulating FGF21 is associated 
with cardiometabolic risk factors including obesity, NAFLD, type 2 
diabetes, and insulin resistance (179–181). FGF21 is a ChREBP transcriptional target (182), and fructose ingestion acutely and robustly 
induces circulating FGF21, whereas the response to glucose ingestion is less substantial and is delayed (175). Fructose-induced, circulating FGF21 may protect the liver from fructose-induced metabolic 
disease (183). Interestingly, data from animal models suggest that 
sugar-induced circulating FGF21 may signal to the brain to suppress 
additional sugar consumption (184, 185). GWAS also support a role 
for FGF21 in macronutrient preference, as variants in the FGF21
locus associate with increased dietary carbohydrate consumption 
relative to dietary fat in human populations (186, 187). However, 
variants associated with increased carbohydrate consumption also 
associate with increased circulating FGF21 levels, which is inconsistent with the negative feedback model. More investigation will be 
required to understand the role of FGF21 in the context of increased 
sugar and fructose consumption.
Effects of fructose on hypertension
The mechanisms by which fructose contributes to the development of hypertension are less well characterized than its effects 
on glucose and lipid homeostasis. High-fructose feeding in 
rodents can increase intestinal salt absorption in part through 
induction of an intestinal anion exchanger, Slc26a6 (188). Moreover, this induction and associated hypertension are prevented 
in GLUT5-knockout mice (188). However, these results are confounded by the fact that GLUT5-knockout mice suffer generalized 
malabsorption and become ill when challenged with fructose. 
Johnson and colleagues have hypothesized that fructose-induced 
hyperuricemia may impair kidney function, contributing to 
hypertension (189). However, as discussed above, genetic data do 
not strongly support a major role for hyperuricemia in cardiometabolic disease. As fructose is robustly metabolized in the kidney, 
fructose-mediated changes in renal salt handling may also be 
important. However, this has yet to be rigorously studied and is 
an area ripe for further investigation.
Conclusions and future directions
The combination of mechanistic data supporting a role for excessive fructose ingestion and epidemiological data supporting a 
role for SSBs in the development of cardiometabolic disease supports recent dietary recommendations to limit sugar consumption published by several public health agencies, including the 
American Heart Association, the World Health Organization, 
and the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (2, 190, 191).

Safe thresholds for sugar consumption and concrete recommendations for targets to reduce cardiometabolic risk remain in dispute. Moreover, implementing effective programs to alter dietary 
habits remains challenging. However, initial reports indicate 
that “sugar taxes” may be effective in reducing SSB consumption 
(192, 193). Time will tell whether such approaches can improve 
health outcomes. Hopefully, by improving our understanding 
of the underlying mechanisms by which sugar and fructose can 
cause disease, we will be able to bring informed, comprehensive 
approaches to bear on our current metabolic epidemics.
