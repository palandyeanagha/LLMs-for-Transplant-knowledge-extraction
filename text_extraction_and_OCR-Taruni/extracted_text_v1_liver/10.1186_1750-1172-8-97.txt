Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic and progressive disease leading to right heart failure and
ultimately death if untreated. The first classification of PH was proposed in 1973. In 2008, the fourth World
Symposium on PH held in Dana Point (California, USA) revised previous classifications. Currently, PH is devided into
five subgroups. Group 1 includes patients suffering from idiopathic or familial PAH with or without germline
mutations. Patients with a diagnosis of PAH should systematically been screened regarding to underlying mutations
of BMPR2 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2) or more rarely of ACVRL1 (activine receptor-like
kinase type 1), ENG (endogline) or Smad8 genes. Pulmonary veno occusive disease and pulmonary capillary
hemagiomatosis are individualized and designated as clinical group 1'. Group 2 'Pulmonary hypertension due to left
heart diseases' is divided into three sub-groups: systolic dysfonction, diastolic dysfonction and valvular dysfonction.
Group 3 'Pulmonary hypertension due to respiratory diseases' includes a heterogenous subgroup of respiratory
diseases like PH due to pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, lung emphysema or interstitial lung disease for exemple. Group 4
includes chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension without any distinction of proximal or distal forms.
Group 5 regroup PH patients with unclear multifactorial mechanisms. Invasive hemodynamic assessment with right
heart catheterization is requested to confirm the definite diagnosis of PH showing a resting mean pulmonary artery
pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mmHg and a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≤ 15 mmHg. The
assessment of PCWP may allow the distinction between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH (PCWP > 15 mmHg).
Echocardiography is an important tool in the management of patients with underlying suspicion of PH. The
European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society (ESC-ERS) guidelines specify its role,
essentially in the screening proposing criteria for estimating the presence of PH mainly based on tricuspid
regurgitation peak velocity and systolic artery pressure (sPAP). The therapy of PAH consists of non-specific drugs
including oral anticoagulation and diuretics as well as PAH specific therapy. Diuretics are one of the most important
treatment in the setting of PH because right heart failure leads to fluid retention, hepatic congestion, ascites and
peripheral edema. Current recommendations propose oral anticoagulation aiming for targeting an International
Normalized Ratio (INR) between 1.5-2.5. Target INR for patients displaying chronic thromboembolic PH is between
2–3. Better understanding in pathophysiological mechanisms of PH over the past quarter of a century has led to
the development of medical therapeutics, even though no cure for PAH exists. Several specific therapeutic agents
were developed for the medical management of PAH including prostanoids (epoprostenol, trepoprostenil, iloprost),
endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan) and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil,
tadalafil). This review discusses the current state of art regarding to epidemiologic aspects of PH, diagnostic
approaches and the current classification of PH. In addition, currently available specific PAH therapy is discussed as
well as future treatments.

Definition and classification
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is defined by
right-heart catheterization (RHC) showing precapillary
pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary artery
pressure (mPAP) of >25 mmHg and a normal pulmonary
artery wedge pressure (PCWP) of <15 mmHg [1,2]. The
classification of pulmonary hypertension (PH) has gone
through a series of changes since the first classification
proposed in 1973 which designated only two categories,
primary pulmonary hypertension or secondary PH, depending on the presence or absence of identifiable
causes or risk factors [3,4]. In 1998, a second World
Symposium on PH was held in Evian (France) and this
classification attempted to create categories of PH that
shared similar pathogenesis, clinical features and therapeutic options [5]. This classification allowed defining
homogenous groups of patients to conduct clinical trials
and to obtain approval for specific PAH therapies
worldwide. In 2003, the third World Symposium on PH
(Venice, Italy) did not propose major changes. However,
the terms idiopathic PAH, familial PAH, and associated
PAH were introduced. The other prominent change was
to move pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and
pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) from separate categories into a single subcategory of PAH.
In 2008, the fourth World Symposium on PH held in
Dana Point (California, USA) and the consensus of an
international group of experts was to revise previous
classifications in order to accurately reflect published
data, as well as to clarify some areas that were unclear.
In 2013, the fifth World Symposium on PH held in Nice
(France) and proposed only minor modifications, however, since the definite conclusions of this symposium
were not yet published, we presented the Dana Point
classification of PH (Table 1).
Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension
The nomenclature of the subgroups and associated conditions has evolved since the first classification, and additional modifications were added in the Dana Point
classification.
Group 1.1/1.2 Idiopathic and heritable PAH
Idiopathic PAH describes a sporadic disease with neither
a family history of PAH nor an identified risk factor.
When PAH occurs in a familial context, germline mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2
(BMPR2) gene, a member of the transforming growth
factor beta (TGF- ß) signaling family, can be detected in
about 70% of cases [6,7]. More rarely, mutations in
activin receptor like kinase type 1 (ACVRL1 or ALK1) or
endoglin genes, also coding for members of the TGF-ß
signaling family, have been identified in patients
with PAH, predominantly with coexistent hereditary
hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Some authors suggested that
mutations of genes encoding for Smads proteins
(Smad8, Smad1 and Smad5), which are other members
of the TGF-ß signaling pathway, or mutations in
caveolin-1 gene may predispose to PAH [8-10].
BMPR2 mutations have also been detected in 11–40%
of apparently idiopathic cases with no family history

[11,12]. Indeed, the distinction between idiopathic and
familial PAH with BMPR2 mutations is artificial, as all
patients with a BMPR2 mutation have heritable disease.
In addition, BMPR2 mutations were identified in only
70-80% families with PAH. Thus, it was decided to abandon the term “familial PAH” in favor of the term “heritable PAH”, including idiopathic PAH with germline
mutations and familial cases with or without identified
mutations [13,14].
Group 1.3 Drug- and toxin-induced PAH
A number of risk factors for the development of PAH
have been individualized in the last European Respiratory Society/ European Society of Cardiology (ERS/ESC)
conjoint guidelines of PH [15] (Table 2).
Aminorex, fenfluramine derivatives and toxic rapeseed
oil represent the only identified “definite” risk factors for
PAH [5,16]. Souza et al. have demonstrated that this subgroup of PAH shares clinical, functional, hemodynamic,
and genetic features with idiopathic PAH, suggesting that
fenfluramine exposure represents a potential trigger for
PAH without influencing its clinical course [17].
Two prospective epidemiologic investigations, the SNAP
(Surveillance of North American Pulmonary Hypertension)
and the SOPHIA (Surveillance of Pulmonary Hypertension
in America) study, were conducted in the USA [18,19].
These investigations included retrospectively 559 and 1335
patients with PH, respectively, and confirmed the previously described association between idiopathic PAH and
the use of fenfluramine. In the SNAP study, the odds ratio
of developing PH was 7.5 for the use of fenfluramine more
than six months of treatment [18].
The agent benfluorex is structurally and pharmacological related to fenfluramine and may be also considered
as an anorectic agent. Frachon and co-workers [20]
showed a significantly higher prevalence of unexplained
valvular heart disease in patients taking benfluorex compared to controls. In addition, Savale and co-workers
demonstrated recently that exposure to benfluorex is suggested to be a trigger in the development of PAH [21].
Benfluorex was withdrawn from the market in 2009.
The SOPHIA study examined intake of a variety of
nonselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants and anxiolytics. No increased risk of developing PAH was observed [19].
Amphetamine use represents a “likely” risk factor, although they are frequently used in combination with
fenfluramine. A recent retrospective study suggested a
relationship with the use of methamphetamine (inhaled,
smoked, oral, or intravenous) and the occurrence of
PAH [22]. Methamphetamine use is now considered a
“very likely” risk factor for the development of PAH.
Recently published data from the French registry of
pulmonary hypertension suggested that dasatinib, a tyrosine kinsase inhibitor (TKI), may induce precapillary
PAH [23]. Several cases of precapillary PH in chronic
myelogenous leukemia patients treated with dasatinib
have been reported.
Group 1.4.1 PAH associated with connective tissue
diseases
PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD)
represents an important clinical subgroup, in which systemic sclerosis represents the major cause of CTD associated PAH. The prevalence of PAH has been well
established only for systemic sclerosis (SSc). Prospective
studies using echocardiography as a screening method
and RHC for confirmation found a prevalence of PAH
between 7–12% [24,25]. PH due to lung fibrosis [26],
diastolic left heart dysfunction [27] and primary cardiac
involvement [28] are also frequent in the setting of pulmonary hypertension in these patients, emphasizing the
importance of a systemic evaluation with RHC to accurately classify the underlying mechanism of PH.
Group 1.4.2 HIV infection
PAH is a rare complication of HIV infection [29,30].
HIV-associated PAH has clinical, hemodynamic, and

histologic characteristics broadly similar to those seen in
idiopathic PAH. Epidemiologic data in the early 1990s, a
time when therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy was not yet available, indicated a prevalence of 0.5%
[31]. The prevalence of HIV-associated PAH was evaluated more recently and showed a stable prevalence of
0.46% [32].
Group 1.4.3 Porto-pulmonary hypertension
Porto-pulmonary hypertension (POPH) is defined by the
development of PAH associated with increased pressure
in the portal circulation [33,34]. Prospective hemodynamic
studies have shown that 2-6% of patients with portal
hypertension had PH [35,36]. However, RHC is mandatory
for the diagnosis of portal PH, as several mechanisms may
increase pulmonary artery pressure in the setting of advanced liver disease: hyperdynamic circulatory state with
high cardiac output, fluid overload and diastolic dysfunction. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is usually normal in these cases.
Group 1.4.4 Congenital heart diseases
A significant proportion of patients with congenital
heart disease (CHD), in particular those with systemicto-pulmonary shunts, will develop PAH if left untreated.
Eisenmenger's syndrome is defined as CHD with an initial large systemic-to-pulmonary shunt that induces progressive pulmonary vascular disease and PAH, with
resultant reversal of the shunt and central cyanosis
[37,38]. It represents the most advanced form of PAH
associated with CHD. It has been reported that a large
proportion of patients with CHD develop some degree
of PAH [39-41]. The prevalence of PAH associated with
congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts in Europe and
North America has been estimated between 1.6 and 12.5
cases per million adults, with 25-50% of this population
affected by Eisenmenger’s syndrome.
Group 1.4.5 Schistosomiasis
In the Dana Point classification, PH associated with
schistosomiasis was included in Group 1. Recently, it
has been demonstrated that PH associated with schistosomiasis may have a similar clinical presentation and
histological findings as idiopathic PAH [42,43]. The
mechanism of PAH in patients with schistosomiasis is
probably multifactorial including portal PH, a frequent
complication of this disease [44] and local vascular
inflammation, whereas mechanical obstruction by
schistosoma eggs seems to play a minor role. More than
200 million people are infected and 4–8% of them will
develop hepatosplenic disease. Then, PAH associated
with schistosomiasis represents a frequent form of PAH
in countries where the infection is endemic. Data from a
recent study based on invasive hemodynamics evidenced
the prevalence of PAH in patients with hepatosplenic
disease of 4.6%; also important was the prevalence of
post-capillary hypertension (3%) reinforcing the need
of invasive hemodynamics for the specific diagnosis of
PAH in schistosomiasis [45].
Group 1.4.6 Chronic hemolytic anemia
The chronic hemolytic anemias represent a subcategory of
PAH. There has been increasing evidence that PAH is a
complication of chronic hereditary and acquired hemolytic
anemias, including sickle cell disease [46,47], thalassemia
[48], hereditary spherocytosis [49], stomatocytosis [50], and
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia [51].
PH has been reported most frequently in patients
with sickle cell disease, however the prevalence of
PAH is not yet clearly established. The prevalence of
PH in sickle cell disease is undoubtedly much lower
than 32% as suggested by echocardiography [47]. Recently, a prospective epidemiologic studies using
echocardiographic screening and direct hemodynamic
confirmation were conducted in 398 outpatients with
sickle cell disease at referral centers in France [52]. In
this study, the prevalence of a tricuspid regurgitant
jet velocity of at least 2.5 m per second measured by
echocardiography was 27%. In contrast, the prevalence of pulmonary hypertension confirmed on
catheterization was only 6%, suggesting that echocardiographic evaluation alone had a low positive predictive value for PH in this population. Indeed, the
precise mechanism of PAH in sickle cell disease remains uncertain.
Group 1’: Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and/or
pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis
PVOD and PCH are uncommon conditions, but they are
increasingly recognized as causes of PH [53]. A recent
clinicopathologic study [54] analyzed specimens from 35
patients diagnosed as having either PVOD (n = 30) or
PCH (n = 5). PCH was identified in 24 (73%) cases diagnosed as PVOD. Indeed, venous involvement was
present in 4/5 cases initially diagnosed as PCH. These
findings suggest that PCH may be an angioproliferative
process frequently associated with PVOD. Similarities in
pathologic features and clinical presentation suggest that
these disorders may be two different presentation of the
same disease [54].
Although PVOD and PCH may present similarly to
idiopathic PAH, there are a number of important differences. These include the presence of crackles on examination, radiologic abnormalities on high-resolution
computed tomography of the chest (ground glass opacities, septal thickening, mediastinal adenopathy) [55-58],
hemosiderin-laden macrophages on bronchoalveolar lavage [59], and a lower DLCO and PaO2 in patients with
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 4 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

PVOD or PCH [58]. PVOD/PCH remains a difficult disorder to categorize, as it shares characteristics with idiopathic PAH but also has a number of distinct
differences. Given the current evidence, it was decided
that PVOD/PCH should be a distinct category but not
completely separated from PAH and PVOD/PCH are
designated as 1’ in the current classification.
Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart
disease
Left-sided ventricular or valvular diseases may produce
an increase of left atrial pressure, leading to a backward
transmission of the pressure and a passive increase of
pulmonary arterial pressure. Left heart disease, probably
represents the most frequent cause of PH [60]. In this
situation, PVR is normal or near normal (<3.0 Wood
units) and there is no gradient between mean PAP and
pulmonary wedge pressure (transpulmonary gradient
<12 mm Hg). In the Dana Point classification, the increasing recognition of left-sided heart dysfunction with
preserved ejection fraction leads to changes in the subcategories of Group 2 and now this group include three
distinct etiologies: left heart systolic dysfunction, left
heart diastolic dysfunction, and left heart valvular disease. In some patients with left heart disease, the elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure is out of proportion
to that expected from the elevation of left arterial pressure (transpulmonary gradient >12 mm Hg), and PVR is
increased to >3.0 Wood units (19–35% of patients) [60].
However, there is no widely accepted hemodynamic definition of transpulmonary gradient, and future recommendations may propose new definition and threshold
of this gradient. Some patients with left heart valvular
disease or even left heart dysfunction can develop severe
PH of the same magnitude as that seen in PAH [61-63].
The elevation of PAP and PVR may be due to either the
increase of pulmonary artery vasomotor tone and/or
pulmonary vascular remodeling [64,65].
Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases
and/or hypoxia
In this group, the predominant cause of PH is alveolar
hypoxia as a result of either chronic lung disease, impaired control of breathing, or residence at high altitude.
However, the precise prevalence of PH in all these conditions remains largely unknown. In the revised classification, the heading has been modified to reinforce the
link with the development of PH. A category of lung disease characterized by a mixed obstructive and restrictive
pattern was added, including chronic bronchiectasis,
cystic fibrosis and the recently described syndrome of
combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema in which
the prevalence of PH is almost 50% [66,67]. In PAH associated with parenchymal lung disease, the increase of
pulmonary arterial pressure is usually modest (mean
PAP lower than 35 mmHg) [68]. Interestingly, in some
patients, increase of PAP is out of proportion and be
higher than 35 mmHg [69]. In a retrospective study of
998 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
who underwent RHC, only 1% had severe PH [70].
These patients with more severe PH were characterized
by mild-to-moderate airway obstruction, severe hypoxemia, hypocapnia, and a very low diffusing capacity for
carbon monoxide.
Group 4: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
hypertension
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
(CTEPH) was included in Group 4. The incidence of
CTEPH is uncertain. CTEPH represents however a frequent cause of PH and occurs in up to 4% of patients
after an acute pulmonary embolism [71,72]. In the classification from the third World Symposium on PH,
CTEPH was divided into 2 subgroups: proximal CTEPH
and distal CTEPH, depending on the feasibility of
performing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Currently, there is no consensus about the definitions of
proximal and distal CTEPH and the decision of surgery
may vary depending on individual centers [73]. Thus,
the Dana Point Classification propose only one group
irrespectively of proximal or distal obstruction. Patients
with suspected or confirmed CTEPH need to be referred
to expert centers with experience in the management of
CTEPH, to consider the feasibility of performing
surgery. The indication for surgery depends on the
location of the obstruction, the correlation between
hemodynamics and the degree of obstruction assessed
by angiography, comorbidities, the willingness of the patient, and the experience of the surgeon [74,75]. Patients
who are not candidates for surgery may benefit from
PAH-specific medical therapy [76,77]; however, further
evaluation of these therapies in randomized control trials
are needed [78].
Group 5: PH with unclear or multifactorial etiologies
Group 5.1 Hematologic disorders
PH has been reported in chronic myeloproliferative disorders including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia [79,80]. Several
mechanisms may be implicated in PH associated with
chronic myeloproliferative disorders including high cardiac output, asplenia, direct obstruction of pulmonary
arteries by circulating megakaryocytes [81], CTEPH [82],
portal PH, and congestive heart failure. Splenectomy as
a result of trauma or as a treatment for hematologic disorders may increase the risk of developing PH [83]. As
described above, dasatinib use may be one cause of
PAH, particularly in chronic myeloid leukemia [23].
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 5 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

Group 5.2 Systemic disorders
The second subgroup includes systemic disorders, including
sarcoidosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis,
lymphangioleiomyomatosis, neurofibromatosis or vasculitis.
PH is a well recognized complication of sarcoidosis
[84], with a reported prevalence of 1–28% [84]. PH is
multifactorial and usually attributed to the destruction
of capillary bed by the fibrotic process and/or the result
of chronic hypoxemia [85]. However, the severity of PH
is frequently out of proportion to the degree of parenchymal lung disease and blood gas abnormalities,
suggesting specific pulmonary vascular involvement [86].
Such mechanisms may include extrinsic compression of
large pulmonary arteries by lymph node enlargement,
and granulomatous infiltration of the pulmonary vasculature, especially the pulmonary veins, which sometimes
mimic PVOD [87].
Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is an uncommon cause of infiltrative and destructive lung disease.
Severe PH is a common feature in patients with end
stage disease [88] and PH in these patients is usually related to chronic hypoxemia and/or abnormal pulmonary
mechanics. Histopathologic examination has shown severe diffuse pulmonary vasculopathy involving predominantly intralobular pulmonary veins and, to a lesser
extent, muscular pulmonary arteries [89].
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare multisystem disorder predominantly affecting women, characterized by
cystic lung destruction, lymphatic abnormalities, and abdominal tumors. PH is relatively uncommon in patients
with lymphangioleiomyomatosis [90]. Recently, a series
of 20 cases of lymphangioleiomyomatosis associated PH
has been reported showing that PH is usually moderate
in this setting and associated with pulmonary function
impairment [91].
Neurofibromatosis type 1, also known as von
Recklinghausen’s disease, is an autosomal-dominant
disease. The disease is occasionally complicated by
systemic vasculopathy. A series of cases of PH have
been reported in the setting of Neurofibromatosis
type-1 [92].
Group 5.3 Metabolic disorders
PH has been reported in a few cases of type Ia glycogen
storage disease, a rare autosomal-recessive disorder
caused by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase [93-95].
The mechanisms of PH are uncertain but portocaval
shunts, atrial septal defects, severe restrictive pulmonary
function defects or thrombosis are thought to play a
role. In one case, autopsy findings revealed the presence
of plexiform lesions [96].
Gaucher’s disease is a rare disorder characterized by a
deficiency of lysosomal B glucosidase, which results in an
accumulation of glucocerebroside in reticuloendothelial
cells. In a study of 134 patients with Gaucher’s disease
who were systematically screened by echocardiography,
PH was not uncommon [97]. In this setting, several potential mechanisms for PH have been suggested, including
interstitial lung disease, chronic hypoxemia, capillary plugging by Gaucher cells and splenectomy [97,98].
The association between thyroid diseases and PH has
been reported in some studies [99]. A prospective study
of 63 consecutive adult patients with PAH found a
prevalence of autoimmune thyroid disease, including
both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, in 49%,
suggesting that these conditions may share a common
immunogenetic susceptibility [100].
Group 5.4 Miscellaneous conditions
The last subgroup includes a number of miscellaneous
conditions, including tumoral obstruction, fibrosing
mediastinitis or chronic renal failure on dialysis.
A progressive obstruction of proximal pulmonary arteries leading to PH may be observed in tumor obstruction when a tumor grows into the central pulmonary
arteries with additional thrombosis. Such cases are due
principally to pulmonary artery sarcomas, which occur
rarely but are usually rapidly fatal [101-103]. The differential diagnosis with CTEPH can be difficult and CT
angiography may be useful to differenciate an obstruction by tumor or thrombotic material. Occlusion of the
microvasculature by metastatic tumor emboli represents
a cause of rapidly progressive PH.
Fibrosing mediastinitis have been mainly reported in
sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and after radiotherapy. Fibrosing mediastinitis may be associated with
severe PH due to compression of both pulmonary arteries and veins.
Lastly, PH has been reported in patients with end-stage
renal disease maintained on long-term hemodialysis.
Based on echocardiographic studies, the prevalence of PH
in this patient population is estimated up to 40% [104].
PH in these patients may be explained by high cardiac
output (resulting from the arteriovenous access, anemia
and fluid overload) and potential diastolic and systolic left
heart dysfunctions. Furthermore, hormonal and metabolic
modification associated with end-stage renal disease might
lead to dysfunction of normal pulmonary vascular tone.
Epidemiology
Information relative to the natural history of PAH was
derived from a national registry conducted in the USA
in the early 1980s, which included 187 patients with
idiopathic PAH followed for up to 5 years. This study
characterized the disease and confirmed its poor prognosis with a median survival of 2.8 years [105,106]. Better understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of
PAH has led to the development of novel therapeutic
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 6 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

strategies in the last decade which improved quality
of life, exercise capacity and survival of these PH
patients [107].
In France, a national multicenter registry prospectively
collected data from 674 adults with PAH from October
2002 to October 2003 and followed these patients during
a 3-year period [108]. This prospective study has shown
more up to date data on the epidemiology of PAH. This
registry has confirmed the female predominance in most
subtypes of PAH with a female/male sex ratio (SR) of 1.9
for all PAH patients, and particularly in idiopathic PAH
(SR 1.6), familial PAH (SR 2.2) and anorexigenassociated PAH (SR 14.9) [108]. The mean age of PAH
patients in this cohort was 50 years with a quarter of patients older than 60 years underlining the possibility of
developing PAH in all ages. In this assessed cohort,
39.2% of patients had idiopathic PAH and 3.9% familial
PAH. In the subgroup of PAH, where PAH was associated with other conditions, 15.3% had connective tissue
disease, 11.3% congenital heart diseases, 10.4% portal
hypertension, 9.5% anorexigen-related PAH and 6.2%
HIV infection [108]. In France, the low estimation of the
prevalence of PAH and idiopathic PAH are respectively
of 15 cases and 5.9 cases/million adult inhabitants. The
low estimation of PAH incidence is 2.4 cases/million
adult inhabitants/year. This study conducted five years
after the withdrawal of fenfluramine derivatives underlines that anorexigen-associated PAH remains an important medical problem nowadays.
Recent prospective data in consecutive patients with
idiopathic, familial or anorexigen-associated PAH patients followed-up for a period of three years (56 incident and 298 prevalent cases) showed better survival
rates than historical cohort. For incident cases, estimated
survival rates were 85.7%, 69.6% and 54.5% at one, two
and three year of follow-up, respectively. In combined
mixed population (incident patients and prevalent patients diagnosed within three years before study entry),
estimated one, two and three year survival was 82.9%,
67.1% and 58.2%, respectively. Parameters significantly associated to improved survival were female
gender, preserved 6-MWD and normal cardiac output
on RHC [109].
Data from the REVEAL registry (US Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management)
are similar concerning the one year survival rate estimated to 91%. Variables independently associated with
increased mortality included pulmonary vascular resistance >32 Wood units, NYHA functional class IV, men
older than 60 years and familiy history of PAH [110].
Genetics
It is now well known that PAH can be either sporadic or
clustered in families [111-114]. In 1954, Dresdale published a detailed description of a family that included
three related subjects with severe PAH of unknown aetiology. Because of physician’s awareness of the familial
occurrence of the disease, other cases of familial PAH
were described. The National Institute of Health Registry
(NIH Registry) provided the first estimate of this condition, and evaluated that at least 6% of individuals diagnosed with sporadic PAH have a family history of the
disorder. In the French PAH registry, 26 cases of familial
PAH were identified in the cohort of 674 patients, which
corresponds to a prevalence of 3.9% of all cases of PAH
and a proportion of 7.3% of familial PAH in the subgroup of idiopathic, familial or anorexigen-associated
PAH [108]. Studies of genealogies of familial PAH advanced our understanding that the disease segregates an
autosomal dominant trait with a markedly reduced
penetrance, since only 10-20% of necessary carriers of
the mutation will develop PAH [115,116]. In 2000, linkage analysis in PAH affected families found mutations
within the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2
gene (BMPR2) [117,118]. BMPR2 gene encodes for a type
2 receptor member of the transforming growth factor
beta (TGF-β) family. Nowadays, germline BMPR2 mutations are detected in 58-74% of PAH patients with a
family history of the disease, and in 3.5-40% of so called
idiopathic PAH patients [6,11,108,119-123]. The observation of the development of PAH in patients displaying
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), an autosomal dominant vascular dysplasia, allowed us to
identify two other PAH predisposing genes: ACVRL1
(Activin A receptor type II-like kinase 1) and ENG
(endoglin) genes. Mutations in these two genes are infrequent in PAH but are frequently identified in HHT
[120,124-130]. Moreover, recent reports described two
PAH patients carriers of a mutation in Smad8 gene, one
PAH patient carrier of a Smad1 mutation and one PAH

patient carrier of a Smad5 mutation [8,9]. BMPR2 gene,
ACVRL1, ENG, Smad8, Smad1 and Smad5 genes are encoding proteins which are involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. More recently, using whole exome
sequencing in a large PAH family, Austin et al. demonstrated the involved of mutations in caveolin-1 gene in
the development of PAH [10] They confirmed their
findinds identifying a caveolin-1 mutation in an unrelated PAH patient. Caveolin-1 protein is necessary for
the formation of calveola, which are crucial for joining
membrane receptors and initiating cellular signaling cascade such as TGF-β signalling pathway. This supports
the hypothesis that mutations in genes involved in the
TGF-β signaling pathway may be a trigger for pulmonary vascular remodeling. Moreover, this signaling pathway controls growth, differentiation and apoptosis of
various cell types like pulmonary vascular endothelial
cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Thereby,
mutations in genes involved in the TGF-β signaling
pathway may be responsible for abnormal proliferation
of pulmonary vascular SMCs and may promote ECs
apoptosis, which might lead to the selection of apoptosis
resistant cells and formation of plexiform lesions, the
hallmark of idiopathic PAH [131,132].
The analysis of clinical, functional and hemodynamic
characteristics of PAH patients revealed that patients
carriers of a BMPR2 or an ACVRL1 mutation are younger at diagnosis than patients with idiopathic PAH. In
addition, they have more severe hemodynamic parameters at diagnosis [114,120].
Several lines of evidence point to the potential requirement of additional factors, either environmental or genetic, in the pathogenesis of the disease. As mentioned,
Humbert and co-workers have shown that exposure to
fenfluramine derivatives greatly increase the risk of developing severe PAH in patients with BMPR2 mutations
[111]. Moreover, modified genes could participate or facilitate the development of PAH. In fact, recent studies
have suggested the potential role of serotonin transporters, serotonin receptors, potassium channels, or
angiopoietin-1 [133]. Finally, PAH mostly occurs in females irrespective of BMPR2 mutation status [134]. To
explain overrepresentation of PAH female patients, it
was suggested that estrogen metabolism might participate in the pathogenesis of PAH [135,136].
Pathophysiology
PAH is a disease which affects small pulmonary arteries.
It is characterized by vascular obstruction leading to
progressive increase in vascular resistance. This increases right ventricular afterload and consequently results in right ventricular failure. Intima and media
proliferation and its consequent pulmonary vascular obstruction are considered to be the key element in the
pathogenesis of PAH. Vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling and thrombosis are factors that increase pulmonary
vascular resistance in PAH [107,137]. These processes
involve a multitude of cellular and molecular elements
(Figure 1).
Cellular factors
Proliferation of smooth muscular cells in the small peripheral pulmonary arteries is a common characteristic in
all forms of PAH. In hypoxic models, fibroblasts of the
adventitia migrate to the media and intima, where proliferation and production of matrix proteins are observed
[138]. Neovascularization, mainly of the adventitia, occurs concomitantly to the thickening of the vascular
walls [139].
In response to certain stimuli, endothelial cells abnormally proliferate to form plexiform lesions in several
forms of PAH. Plexiform lesions consist of endothelial
cells, matrix proteins and fibroblasts and obliterate the
vascular lumen [140]. The stimuli for endothelial proliferation is still unknown but several factors have been incriminated such as hypoxia, inflammation, shear stress,
drugs, viral infections and genetic susceptibility.
Extrapulmonary cells may also participate in the vascular
remodeling responsible for PAH. Indeed, fibrocytes and
c-kit + cells are mobilized from the bone marrow, and
may differentiate into vascular cells and/or produce proangiogenic factors to participate in the pathogenesis of
PAH [141,142]. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis may play an
important role in the pulmonary recruitment of these
circulating progenitors and can be therapeutically
targeted [143].
Inflammatory mechanisms seems to play an important
role in certain forms of PAH such as PAH associated
with auto immune diseases or HIV infection [144]. In
fact, in severe cases of PAH associated with systemic
lupus erythematosus disease, some patients improved
both clinically and hemodynamically with administrated
immunosuppressant treatment. Thirty to 40% of patients
with PAH have circulating auto-antibodies and elevated
plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines
such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
chemokines such as fractalkine and MCP-1 [145,146].
Inflammatory cells, such as lymphocytes B and T, macrophages, mastocytes and dendritic cells, can also be
found in plexiform lesions of severe PAH [147,148].
Chemokines, like RANTES and fractalkine are also
overly expressed in the pulmonary vascular endothelium
of PAH patients [145].
Thrombosis and platelet dysfunction can be important
in the development of PAH. Abnormalities of thrombosis, endothelial cells or platelets can generate or aggravate thrombosis in situ. Elevated plasma concentrations
of D-dimers and fibrinopeptides A and B, in certain
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 8 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

patients with PAH, are the proof of an abnormal
intravascular coagulation process. Elevated plasma
concentrations of von-Willebrand factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 also reflect endothelial
dysfunction in PAH. It has been demonstrated that shear
stress creates pro-thrombotic vascular lesions in PAH
that may lead to thrombosis in situ. But platelet function
is not limited to coagulation. In response to certain
stimuli, platelets can produce prothrombotic, vasoactive
or mitogenic factors, such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2),
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), serotonin (5-
hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), transforming growth factor
beta (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) that participate in vasoconstriction and vascular
remodeling [149,150].
Autoimmunity and PAH
The self-tolerance is controlled in the periphery by a
particular population of T-lymphocytes called regulatory
T-lymphocytes (Treg). The breakdown of self-tolerance
can lead to the development of an autoimmune response
(i.e. directed against self antigens) that can finally give
rise to an autoimmune disease. Huertas et al. [151]
showed that circulating Treg number was comparable in
idiopathic PAH and SSc-PAH patients. However the percentage of those expressing leptin receptors was higher
in idiopathic PAH and SSc-PAH as compared to
controls, and their function was reduced in idiopathic
PAH and SSc-PAH patients as compared to controls in a
leptin-dependent manner [151]. Work on chronic inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases suggest
that pathogenic antibodies and T cells may be generated
locally, in the targeted organ, in highly organized ectopic
lymphoid follicles commonly called tertiary lymphoid
tissues. Recently, Perros et al. [152] described the presence of highly organized perivascular follicles in idiopathic PAH lungs arguing for specific immune-adaptive
mechanisms in the pathophysiology of the disease. One
can propose that deregulated and unresolved pulmonary
inflammation on the background of a genetic predisposition, could result in persisting vascular remodelling
leading to PAH. An initial acute inflammation that is
normally expected to resolve with return to homeostasis,
could conduct the production of auto-antibodies against
vascular wall components, and would shift to chronic
persisting and chronic inflammation, endothelial barrier
breakdown, infiltration by immune cells, local and
chronic autoimmunity, and vascular remodeling culminating in PAH.
Molecular factors
Many authors consider pulmonary vasoconstriction as
an early event in the process of PAH. Vasoconstriction
has been associated with an abnormal function or
Figure 1 Pathophysiology of PAH. The pulmonary vascular remodeling responsible for PAH is the consequence of closely intertwined
predisposing and acquired factors. Thoses pathological elements affect all three layers of precapillary pulmonary arteries leading to intimal
hyperplasia, medial thickening and adventitial remodeling/fibrosis. Intra- but also extra-pulmonary cells, such as inflammatory and progenitor
cells, are suspected to play a role in this remodeling. This increases right ventricular afterload and consequently results in right ventricular failure.

expression of potassium channels and with endothelial
dysfunction [107]. Endothelial dysfunction results in a
decreased production of vasodilators such as nitric oxide
(NO) and prostacyclin and an increased production of
vasoconstrictors such as endothelin-1 [153].
Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is a potent pulmonary vasodilator that acts via the cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) pathway. It inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and decreases platelet aggregation. Production of prostacyclin is reduced
in endothelial cells of patients with PAH [154]. PAH
therapy based on prostacyclin and its derivates have
proven efficacy both hemodynamically and in clinical
trials. NO is also a pulmonary vasodilator which acts
via the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
pathway. To increase pulmonary vasodilatation dependant on NO, a recent therapeutic strategy has
targeted type 5 phosphodiesterase which degrades
cGMP. Sildenafil or tadalafil, type 5 phosphodiesterase
inhibitors, have proven their efficacy in patients with
PAH [155]. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a
neurotransmitter that has systemic and pulmonary
vasodilator properties. It also inhibits smooth cell
proliferation and decreases platelet aggregation and
acts via the activation of the cAMP and cGMP systems [156]. Low plasmatic concentrations of VIP have
been measured in pulmonary arteries of patients with
PAH.
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is an endothelially-derived peptide
that has two receptor subtypes, designated as endothelin A
(ETRA) and endothelin B (ETB), located on smooth muscle
cells of pulmonary arteries. By ligating the ETRA, ET-1
intracellular calcium concentrations increase and activates
the protein kinase C pathway [157]. ET-1 is a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor and stimulates mitosis of arterial
smooth muscle cells, thus contributing to pulmonary vascular remodeling. Pulmonary and plasma levels of ET-1 are elevated in human PAH and in experimental animal models
of PAH [158]. The therapeutic efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists (Ambrisentan, Bosentan) has been demonstrated in clinical trials in the pathophysiology of PAH.
In hypoxic models of PAH, hypoxia inhibits one or
several voltage dependant potassium channels of the
pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. This leads to
membrane depolarization and opening of voltage dependant calcium channels with a subsequent increase of
the intracellular calcium concentration and cellular
contraction. Certain potassium channels are under
expressed in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells of
patients with PAH [159,160]. It is still unknown whether
abnormalities of the potassium channels are acquired or
genetic. However, it has been demonstrated that
anorexigens, such as dexfenfluramine and aminorex, directly inhibit certain potassium channel subtypes [161].
Certain medications such as dichloroacetate and sildenafil
increase the expression and function of potassium
channels.
In PAH, plasmatic concentrations of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) are elevated [150]. An association
between anorexigens and serotonin was established in the
1960s. Aminorex and fenfluramin both increase plasmatic
levels of serotonin. The variability of the expression and
activity of the transporter of 5-HT (5-HTT) contributes to
pulmonary vascular remodeling in human and experimental models of PAH [162]. Some studies have shown that
the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor fluoxetin prevents the development of PAH in mice [163]. Some 5-HT
receptor subtypes may also be implicated in the development of hypoxia induced PAH [164].
Rho proteins regulate fundamental cellular functions
such as contraction, migration, proliferation and apoptosis. Several studies have implicated Rho protein A and
Rho kinases in the vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling of PAH [165,166]. RhoA and Rho kinase activities
are increased in idiopathic PAH, in association with enhanced RhoA serotonylation. Direct involvement of the
5-HTT/RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway in 5-HTTmediated pulmonary artery-smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation and platelet activation during PH
progression identify RhoA/Rho kinase signaling as a
promising target for new treatments against PH [167].
Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription
factor that principally regulates cellular adaptation to
hypoxia but also regulates several genes implicated in
angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, cellular metabolism and
survival [168]. In experimental mice heterozygote for the
gene coding for HIF-1 alpha, hypoxia induced right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular pressure and medial thickening of pulmonary arterioles are reduced [169].
In immunohistological analysis of human plexiform lesions of patients with severe PAH, there was an
overexpression of HIF-1 alpha in proliferating endothelial cells [170].
In conclusion, the pathophysiology of PAH is heterogeneous and multifactorial. The genetic mutations found
in familial PAH and in a proportion of sporadic PAH are
neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of
PAH. Therefore, the current hypothesis is that of a genetic predisposition for PAH followed by a superimposed
environmental factor (infection, inflammation, autoimmunity). Our understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PAH has lead to the
development of new treatments such as prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists and type 5
phosphodiesterase inhibitors. However, future progress
is still necessary in order to discover new pathophysiological pathways and to develop new therapeutic strategies in PAH.

Histopathology: vascular changes
Vascular remodelling in pulmonary arterial and venous
hypertension typically involves the small pulmonary vessels. Muscular arteries of less than 500 μm display a
thickening within the intimal, medial and adventitial
compartment. When involved, pulmonary veins of the
interlobular septa and smallest preseptal venules show
fibrous obliteration and / or muscularization. Even the
smallest vascular level may be involved: patients with
pulmonary venous hypertension frequently present focal
proliferation of alveolar capillaries. The different histological pattern is presented here below.
Arterial lesions
Isolated medial hypertrophy
This abnormality of the vessel wall can be observed in
all subgroups of PAH and may even be encountered in
other forms of PH, e.g. in mitral valve stenosis. The lesion corresponds to a smooth muscle cell proliferation
and / or recruitment within the tunica media; the histological criterion of hypertrophy / hyperplasia is fulfilled,
when the diameter of a single medial layer, delimited by
its internal and external elastic lamina, exceeds 10 per
cent of the arteries cross-sectional diameter (Figure 2A).
Isolated hypertrophy of the medial layer may be considered as an early and even reversible event as it has been
shown in PH due to hypoxia in high altitude [171].
However, medial hypertrophy is usually associated with
other PAH-lesions.
Concentric and eccentric non-laminar intimal fibrosis
Fibrotic lesions of the intimal layer are frequent in PAHdiseased lungs. The intima may be thickened by proliferation and recruitment of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and
other connective tissue cells, and consequently by the
interstitial deposition of collagen (Figure 2B, C). In a
purely descriptive approach, this thickening may be uniform and concentric, or focally predominating and eccentric. However, the eccentric intimal thickening is
frequently observed in cases with thrombotic events and
could represent residues of wall-adherent, organized
thrombi. Thrombotic lesions, or so called in situ thrombosis, are a frequent pattern in different PAH-subgroups:
organization and recanalization of totally occluding thrombotic material may lead to bizarre, fibrotic multi-channel
lesions (so called “colander-like” lesions) which can be
easily confounded with proliferative complex lesions (see
below) (Figure 2D). Frequently, adventitial fibrosis is associated to intimal modifications (Figure 2A, B).
Concentric laminar intimal fibrosis
This morphologically conspicuous phenotype of intimal
fibrosis is also known as “onion-skin” or “onion-bulb” lesion. Numerous concentrically arranged fibrotic layers
occlude the arterial lumen of small (diameter: 100–
200 μm) arteries (Figure 2E). The scary, cell-lacking
morphology of this lesion is frequently found in patients
suffering from idiopathic PAH and PAH associated to
CTD [172]. Nevertheless, immunohistochemical analysis
reveals fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and smooth muscle
cells.
Complex lesions
The pathological classification of the World Symposium
meetings in Venice and in Dana Point comprises three
patterns, plexiform lesion, dilation lesion and arteritis.
The plexiform lesion probably represents the most illustrious form of vascular lesions in PAH and affects various vascular compartments: focal intimal thickening of
small pulmonary arteries, preferably beyond branching
points and exuberant endothelial cell proliferation, leading to the formation of capillary-like, sinusoidal channels
on a smooth muscle cell and collagen-rich matrix within
the native arterial lumen and resulting in obstruction
[173,174]. This glomeruloid-like arterial zone feeds into
dilated, vein-like congestive vessels, which are perceivable at low magnification (Figure 2F). The latter veinlike vessels are also known as dilation lesions and may
predominate the histological pattern (Figure 2G). Classical arteritis with transmural inflammation and fibrinoid
necrosis, as first described by Heath and Edwards for
PAH associated to congenital cardiac disease
(Eisenmenger), is not a regular finding in PAH [175].
Nevertheless, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of
diseased pulmonary arteries in PAH-patients, consisting
mainly of T- and B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells, mastcells and macrophages can be regularly found
[141,148,176] (Figure 2H). It has not been elucidated
until now, whether this inflammatory pattern is of
pathogenetic importance, or if it represents a pure epiphenomenon within disease evolution. The reported
evidence of proinflammatory mediators, so called
chemokines, released by altered endothelial cells of
PAH-lungs strongly indicates a self-supporting and selfamplifying process [145,177].
Venous and venular lesions (Pulmonary veno-occlusive
disease and pulmonary hemangiomatosis)
A clear-cut differentiation between pre-and post-capillary
pulmonary vascular lesions is sometimes difficult to make:
lesions frequently concern veins and arteries in lungs of
patients with PVOD, and vice-versa veins may be strongly
involved in some subgroups of PAH. This is not contradictory because the clinical approach to ‘difficult-to-treat’
PAH-groups may be similar to clinical management of
PVOD and PVOD-patients are frequently treated – under
great precaution – with pulmonary arterial dilators, e.g.
prostanoids. Recent reports, for example, indicate that
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 11 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

CTD associated PAH, classically being considered as precapillary PH, simultaneously displays a PVOD-like pattern
in histology [178,179]. Like in PVOD, the observed postcapillary lesions concern septal veins and pre-septal
venules and usually consist of a loose and pauci-cellular
and cushion-like intimal fibrosis that may totally occlude
the lumen. A muscularization of both, septal veins and
pre-septal venules may be observed (Figure 3A, B).
Importantly, occult pulmonary hemorrhage regularly occurs in patients displaying PVOD. This particularity,
which is certainly due to the post-capillary bloc, is of diagnostic importance, as bronchio-alveolar lavage can reveal
an occult hemorrhage. The degree of hemorrhage can be
evaluated semi-quantitatively and qualitatively using the
Golde Score, which takes number and Perls-PrussianBlue staining-degree of intra-alveolar siderophages into

consideration (Figure 3C) [180]. Pulmonary capillary
hemangiomatosis has been historically described as an aggressive capillary proliferation with patchy distribution
within the pulmonary parenchyma: alveolar septa are
thickened by 3 to 4 capillary layers, and infiltration of venous and bronchiolar structures with secondary occlusion
may be present (Figure 3D). It is thought, that a clinically
relevant post-capillary bloc is owed to this angiomatoid
expansion. Occult hemorrhage or hemosiderosis, therefore, is frequently found [181]. However, Lantuejoul and
co-workers have shown in a remarkable retrospective
histological analysis, that capillary hemangiomatosispattern is virtually always present in PVOD, and veinremodelling is constantly observed in case with a primary
diagnosis of PCH [54]. The authors suggest the possibility,
that PVOD and PCH might be the same disease, with a
vein- or a capillary-predominating pattern. We fully support this view, and in our experience from the French National PH Reference Center, no clinical distinction is made
between both conditions.
Clinical description
Symptoms and clinical signs of PH
There is no pathognomonic clinical sign of PH. Clinical
presentation is related either to right heart failure or to
associated diseases. Persistant dyspnea on exertion is the
most frequent symptom; and it is present in almost patients even in the presence of mild hemodynamic abnormalities [1,182]. Dyspnea usually starts insiduously and
is often neglected by patients which explain the delay of
around two years in establishing the diagnosis of PH.
The New York Heart Association (NYHA) provides a
classification system for the clinicial evaluation of dyspnoea. Four categories are proposed to classify patients
in functional classes (FC) based on how much they are
limited during physical activity; the limitations/symptoms are in regard to normal breathing (Table 3).
However, at time of diagnosis, 70% of patients are in
NYHA FC III or IV. Chest pain, light-headedness and
syncope may occur, particularly during physical efforts
and are major signs of disease severity. Palpitations are
frequent during physical efforts and may reveal true cardiac arrhythmias. Other symptoms of PAH include fatigue and weakness. Hemoptysis may complicate PAH
and could be life-threatening, justifying embolization of
dilated bronchial arteries. Hoarseness of the voice may
occasionally be noted and is due to compression of the
left laryngeal nerve by the dilated pulmonary artery
(Ortner’s syndrome).
Signs of right heart failure may be observed in the
most severe patients, including venous jugular distension, hepato-jugular reflux, hepatomegaly and hepatalgia.
Lower limb edema, ascitis and generalized edema underscore the severity of right heart failure. Cardiac
auscultation shows usually a prominent pulmonary component of S2, a systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and more rarely a diastolic murmur of pulmonary
regurgitation. Pulmonary auscultation is usually normal
and contrasts with the importance of dyspnea. History
and clinical examination should also screen for manifestations of extra thoracic diseases, particularly Raynaud’s
syndrome which can be found in PAH associated with
CTD and particularly in systemic sclerosis.
Diagnostic methods
The diagnostic process of PAH requires a series of investigations that are intended to make the diagnosis, to clarify the
clinical class of PH and the underlying type of PAH and to
evaluate the functional and hemodynamic impairment
[183]. The detection of PH requires investigations including
electrocardiogram, chest radiograph and trans-thoracic
echocardiogram. Other conditions which can induce PH will
be identified by tests such as pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases, ventilation and perfusion lung scan, high
resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) of the chest and
pulmonary angiography. Additional investigations are required for evaluation of PAH severity including exercise testing and hemodynamics. Additional imaging may clarify
underlying lung abnormalities. Finally, right heart catheterisation confirms the definite diagnosis.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
The ECG may provide suggestive or supportive evidence
of PH by demonstrating right ventricular hypertrophy
and strain, and right atrial dilation. Right ventricular
hypertrophy and right axis deviation are present in respectively 87% and 79% of patients with idiopathic PAH
[105]. Unfortunately, the ECG has low sensitivity and
specificity as a screening tool for detecting PH.
Chest radiography
In 90% of idiopathic PAH patients, chest radiography is
abnormal at the time of diagnosis [105]. Findings include
central pulmonary arterial dilatation which contrasts with
loss of the peripheral blood vessels. Right atrial and ventricular enlargement may be seen in more advanced cases.
Chest radiography may help to identify associated
moderate-to-severe lung disease or pulmonary venous
hypertension due to left heart abnormalities.
Pulmonary function test and arterial blood gases
Pulmonary function tests (PFT) will help to assess underlying lung abnormalities. Forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV1) and total lung capacity (TLC) in idiopathic
PAH are usually normal or slightly abnormal. Low diffusing
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) has been
reported in PAH patients, but is more pronounced in
PVOD patients with often severe reductions under 50% of
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 13 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

the predicted value [56,184]. Results of arterial blood gases
usually show mild hypoxemia and hypocapnia. Severe hypoxemia may be a parameter of underlying PVOD or chronic
lung disease.
Exercise testing
The normal physiologic response of the pulmonary vasculature to exercise consists of distension of pulmonary
arteries and arterioles as well as recruitment of previously unused vascular bed. Thus, in health, pulmonary
artery pressure rises minimally in response to increased
blood flow and pulmonary vascular resistance decreases
because of the remodeled vasculature. These mechanisms are impaired in the course of PH. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has been shown to be
useful in assessing the severity and prognosis of PAH
[15,185]. Several mechanisms are associated: (1) failure
to perfuse the ventilated lung, leading to an increase of
physiologic dead space and ventilatory requirement; (2)
failure to increase cardiac output appropriately in response to exercise, causing an early lactic acidosis,
thereby increasing acid ventilatory drive; and (3)
exercise-induced hypoxemia increasing the hypoxic ventilatory drive. The ventilatory expired gas abnormalities
precipitated by PH are multifactorial and associated with
disease severity. CPET assesses and measure the ventilation–perfusion mismatch (i.e. acceptable ventilation/diminished perfusion), reflected by an elevated VD/VT or
VE/VCO2 ratio or slope and diminished partial pressure
of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), and the decreased peak VO2 and VO2 at the ventilatory threshold
(VT). Peak VO2, VE/VCO2 ratio or slope or PETCO2,
measure during CPET, all demonstrated independent
and strong prognostic value as univariate markers [186].
Transthoracic doppler-echocardiography (TTE)
TTE is a non-invasive screening test for patients with
suspected PH. TTE estimates pulmonary artery systolic
pressure (sPAP) and may provide additional information
about the cause and consequences of PH. The estimation of PAP is based on the peak velocity of the jet of tricuspid regurgitation. The simplified Bernoulli equation
describes the relationship of tricuspid regurgitation velocity and the peak pressure gradient of tricuspid regurgitation = 4 x (tricuspid regurgitation velocity). Estimation
of PA systolic pressure require to take into account right
atrial pressure (PA systolic pressure = tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient + estimated right atrial pressure). Right atrial pressure cannot be measured and is
estimated based on the diameter and respiratory variation of the inferior vena cava [15]. An alternative approach to echocardiographic diagnosis of PH is based on
the comparison of tricuspid regurgitation velocity with
values reported in a healthy population. Ideally, the influence of age, sex and body mass should be taken into
consideration [187]. This method avoids cumulative
error but is less directly linked to the accepted
hemodynamic definition of PH based on mPAP [15].

Other echocardiographic variables that might raise or
reinforce suspicion of PH independently of tricuspid regurgitation velocity should always be considered. They
include an increased velocity of pulmonary valve regurgitation and a short acceleration time of RV ejection into
the PA. Increased dimensions of right heart chambers,
abnormal shape and function of the interventricular
septum, increased RV wall thickness, pericardial effusion
and dilated main PA are also suggestive of PH, but these
signs are considered to be related to the hemodynamic
severity [15].
Besides identification of PH, TTE also allows a differential diagnosis of the possible causes of pulmonary
hypertension. TTE can recognize left heart valvular diseases and myocardial diseases responsible for postcapillary PH, and congenital heart diseases with
systemic-to-pulmonary shunts. The venous injection of
agitated saline can help to identify patent foramen ovale
or small sinus venosus type atrial septal defects.
Transesophageal echocardiography is rarely required in
the setting of PH.
Ventilation/perfusion lung scan
Ventilation/perfusion lung scan should be systematically
assessed to screen for CTEPH. Indeed, V/Q lung scan is
the method of choice to detect CTEPH [188] and normal V/Q scan can eliminate CTEPH.
High resolution computed tomography of the chest
High resolution computed tomography of the chest
(HRCT) supplies detailed information about underlying
lung parenchyma disease, such as pulmonary emphysema or interstitial lung disease. A number of various
pathologic features may be detected on chest HRCT including pericardial effusions and pulmonary artery enlargement, defined by the ratio of the diameter of main
pulmonary artery to that of the thoracic aorta >1. In the
setting of CTEPH, contrast HRCT of the pulmonary arteries may show changes like complete vessel obstruction, vessel cut-offs, intimal irregularities, incorporated
thrombus formations as well as bands and webs [189].
Furthermore, collaterals from bronchial arteries can be
identified with this technique. Proximal pulmonary obstruction is displaying about significant and accessible
organized fibrous tissue in segmental or subsegmental
arteries. If no proximal obstruction or obliteration is
noted; lesions are considered to be distal, non-accessible
to surgery intervention. In some cases, pulmonary angiography is necessary to differentiate between proximal
or distal obstructions. Chest HRCT may also suggest
PVOD in the presence of adenopathy mediastinal,
ground glass opacities and septal lines [53].
Pulmonary angiography
In CTEPH, pulmonary angiography may be helpful to
determinate surgically accessible form. Typical angiographic findings in CTEPH are complete obstruction,
band and webs as well as intimal irregularities [74]. Pulmonary angiography may be also helpful in the setting
of fibrosing mediastinitis.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows non
invasive evaluation of right ventricular size, morphology
and shape. It provides information on right ventricular
function and allows non-invasive assessment of blood
flow including cardiac output, stroke volume, distensibility of pulmonary artery and right ventricular mass
[190,191]. Decreased stroke volume, an increased right
ventricular right ventricular end-diastolic volume and a
decreased measured at baseline are associated with poor
prognosis of disease [192,193]. In addition, it has been
demonstrated that deterioration of these parameters at
one-year follow-up were also predictors of mortality
[193]. Thus cardiac MRI could represent a non-invasive
tool to evaluate severity of PAH patients at baseline and
during follow-up. Further studies are needed to evaluate
the precise place of cardiac MRI in the management of
PAH patients.
Abdominal ultrasound scan
Abdominal ultrasound should be performed in all patients if PH is suspected to exclude portal hypertension
or liver disease. When portal hypertension is suspected,
the diagnosis can be confirmed during RHC by measurement of an increased gradient between the free and occluded hepatic vein pressure [194].
Blood tests
Serological tests for HIV, hepatitis B or C serology
should be performed to screen for associated diseases.
The thyroid hormone measurement may reveal either
hyperthyroid dysfunction or autoimmune thyroiditis, frequently encountered in PAH.
Right heart catheterization
Invasive hemodynamic assessment with right heart
catheterization is requested to confirm the diagnosis of
PH showing a resting mPAP of ≥25 mmHg and a normal
PCWP [2]. This value has been used for selecting patients in all RCTs and registries of PAH, however normal
mPAP at rest is around of 14 mmHg, with an upper
limit of normal of 20 mm Hg. The significance of a
mean PAP between 21 and 24 mmHg is currently unclear. No definition of PH on exercise was currently
adopted, because of the large variability of mPAP on exercise in healthy individuals.
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 15 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

The assessment of PCWP may allow the distinction
between precapillary (normal PCWP ≤15 mmHg) and
postcapillary PH (PCWP >15 mm Hg). In post-capillary
PH, the last guidelines from the 4th World Symposium
(Dana Point) proposed a dichotomy between "passive"
and "reactive" (out-of-proportion) post-capillary PH
based on transpulmonary pressure gradient (mPAP–
PCWP, respectively ≤ or > 12 mm Hg). Indeed, there is
no clear consensus on this definition and the future recommendations arising from the last World Symposium
on PH (Nice, 2013) should propose new definition to define these two entities.
Measurement values obtained by RHC are PAP (diastolic, mean and systolic), right atrial pressure (RAP),
PCWP, right ventricular pressure and cardiac output
(CO) preferably by the thermodilution method. In contrast to the thermodilution method, the Fick method is
mandatory in patients with suspected CHD. In experienced centres, RHC procedures have low morbidity and
mortality rates [195]. Elevated mean right atrial pressure
reduced CO and mixed venous oxygen saturation
(SVO2) are related to the prognosis of PAH patients.
Assessment of disease severity
NYHA functional class at baseline or after initiation
of epoprostenol treatment, signs of right heart failure,
6-MWD, peak VO2, echocardiographic parameters,
hemodynamic parameters and biological tests (hyperuricemia, brain natriuretic peptide, troponin) predict prognosis
in idiopathic PAH when assessed at baseline.
Patients presenting PVOD or PAH associated with
CTD (frequently associated with venous involvement)
have a worse prognosis than patients with idiopathic
PAH [53]. Patients with PAH associated with congenital
systemic to pulmonary shunts have a more slowly progressive course than idiopathic PAH patients. Few data
are available in other conditions such as HIV infection
or portal hypertension. In these circumstances, underlying diseases may contribute to the overall outcome. In
clinical practice, the prognostic value of a single variable
in the individual patient may be less significant than the
value of multiple concordant variables.
A score has been proposed (REVEAL Registry Risk
Score) to evaluate severity of newly diagnosed PAH patients
[196]. This score was based on several parameters including
subgroups of PAH, renal insufficiency, age > 60 years,
NYHA FC, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, 6-MWD,
BNP, pericardial effusions, DLCO, RAP and PVR [196].
Management of PAH
General measures
Physical activities
Peripheral vasodilatation or increased cardiac demand will
put PAH patient at risk of acute cardiac failure and
syncope. Thus, we traditionally advise against extreme
physical activity. Patients are taught to stay active while
adapting effort according to their symptoms. Nevertheless,
the appropriate level of physical activity is difficult to define. To date, only few studies have evaluated to effect of
cardio-respiratory rehabilitation in PAH. One of this program involved three weeks of inpatient rehabilitation
followed by three month training at home with phone call
supervision. No modification on cardiac hemodynamic
was observed on echocardiography but 6-MWD and quality of life were improved. As proposed in ERS/ESC guidelines, more data are required before appropriate
recommendations can be made [15].
Altitude and hypoxia
As hypoxic vasoconstriction may be an aggravating factor in PAH, stays at altitude above 1500-2000 meters
without supplemented oxygen and air flight in
unpressurized cabin should be avoided [15]. Chronic
hypoxia (PaO2 <60 mmHg) warrants oxygen therapy for
symptoms and to avoid PAH deterioration.
Pregnancy and contraception
The hemodynamic and hormonal modifications occurring
during pregnancy and peripartum period can lead to severe, and sometimes fatal, right heart failure [197,198].
Pregnancy is considered to be associated with high rate of
mortality (30-50%) in PAH patients [15]. Thus, pregnancy
is contraindicated in women affected by PAH. Consequently, contraception is strongly recommended in
PAH women of childbearing age [197,198]. Combined
estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive is theoretically contraindicated because their pro-thrombotic activity. Therefore, mechanical contraception (intra-uterine device for
example) or surgical sterilization should be proposed.
Nethertheless, pregnancy should be managed with specific
PAH therapies and planned elective delivery in expert centres [15].
Anaesthesia and surgery
Hypotension induced by anaesthetic drugs, and
hemodynamic insults following surgical and anaesthetic
interventions are generally poorly tolerated by PAH patients, with a high procedural morbidity and mortality.
Consequently, it is recommended in general that PAH
patients avoid unnecessary procedures. When required,
these should be highly planned with the multidisciplinary team, either within, or in close liaison with, the expert centers, in order to coordinate surgical and medical
interventions [199].
Proscribed drugs
Vasoconstrictors used in cold medication to relieve nasal
congestion should be avoided in PAH patients. BetaMontani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 16 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

blockers have been shown to be deleterious to PAH patients because they prevent the important adaptive
physiologic response that allows preservation of adequate
cardiac output. To discontinue such drugs in a patient
with PAH may lead, by itself, to important clinical and
hemodynamic improvement [200].
Non specific drugs
Diuretics
Diuretics are one of the most important treatments in
the setting of PAH because right heart failure leads to
fluid retention, hepatic congestion, ascites and peripheral
edema. Right ventricular overload is part of clinical
symptoms and has been associated with a poor prognosis in PAH [201]. Diuretics and salt-free diet relieve
hypervolemia and associated symptoms. Whether this
strategy improves prognosis is unknown. Dose adjustment of diuretics is needed, based on clinical and
hemodynamic findings. Renal function and blood chemistry should be monitored to avoid renal failure or
dyskalemia [192].
Oral anticoagulation
Pathology specimens from PAH patients may show in situ
thrombosis and thrombi recanalisation. Only few studies
support anticoagulation treatment in PAH (mostly retrospective or not randomized) [202,203]. Current recommendations propose oral anticoagulation aiming for
targeting an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 1.5 and 2.5. Although the somewhat sparse
evidence base is derived exclusively from idiopathic,
heritable and PAH due to anorexigens, anticoagulation
has been generalised to all patient groups, given the absence of contraindication. Anticoagulation is usually not
recommended in porto-pulmonary hypertension because
of the risk of esophageal variceal haemorrhage. In patients
with systemic sclerosis, oral anticoagulation can be difficult to manage because of their high risk of bleeding, especially from the gastrointestinal tract. Variceal ligation is
a preventive option in these cases. Long-term oral
anticoagulation is essential in CTEPH with an INR which
is recommended to be between 2 and 3.
Digitalis
Digoxin has been suggested as part of PAH therapy in
the past because it produces an acute increase in cardiac
output [204], although its efficacy is unknown in PAH.
Therefore it is usually proposed in PAH associated with
atrial tachyarrhythmias [192].
Calcium channel blockers
Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are indicated in patients with a positive vasodilatation challenge test after
inhaled NO. CCB are vasodilators and were initially
introduced in the 1980’s as part of PAH therapy to counteract vasoconstriction that has traditionally been assumed to be a preponderant mechanism in PAH. In the
1990’s, Rich and colleagues showed in an open prospective study that high dose of calcium channel blockers (nifedipine 90 to 240 mg/day or diltiazem 360 to 900 mg/
day) significantly improve prognosis in patients with an
acute vasodilation response [203]. Sitbon et al. showed
that only 12.6% out of the patients could be treated by
CCB according to criteria's establish by Rich and coworkers [203]. Moreover, only half of them maintained
actual long-term benefit defined as NYHA FC I or II at
one year without the need for additional treatment
[205]. In this study, a decrease in mean PAP > 10 mmHg
to reach a value < 40 mmHg, with a stable or increased
cardiac output, during acute vasodilator test was predictive of long-term response to CCB. Contrarily, CCB must be
avoided in the absence of acute vasoreactivity because of the
risk of significantly reduced cardiac output and systemic
blood pressure [205]. The choice of CCB is based upon the
patient’s heart rate; nifedipine and amlodipine were preferred in the presence of relative bradycardia and diltiazem
in the presence of tachycardia. Doses of CCB used in this
setting are relatively high, 120-240 mg de nifedipine, 240-
270 mg for diltiazem, and up to 20 mg for amlodipine [15].
If the patient does not show a correct response (NYHA FC
I or II with marked hemodynamic improvement), additional
PAH specific therapy should be added. Of note, CCB is contraindicated in PVOD because of the high-risk of life threatening pulmonary edema, even in the presence of acute
vasodilator response that can be observed in the same proportion as in idiopathic PAH [53].
PAH-specific therapies
Better understanding in pathophysiological mechanisms
of PH over the past quarter of a century has led to the development of medical therapeutics, even though no cure
for pulmonary arterial hypertension exists. Several specific
therapeutic agents were developed for the medical management of PAH including prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
Furthermore, emerging treatments such as tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase activators (riociguat)
and prostacyclin receptor agonists (selexipag) are currently being evaluated in PAH.
Prostanoids
Endothelium-derived prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), or prostacyclin, is an arachidonic acid produced by endothelial cells.
Prostacyclin is a powerful systemic and pulmonary vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation through the
increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) [206,207]. Moreover, prostacyclin plays an important role in antiproliferative, antithrombotic, antimitogenic
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 17 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

and immunomodulatory activity [208]. Prostanoids are a
family of prostacyclin analogues available in intravenous,
subcutaneous, or inhaled form.
Epoprostenol In the 1980s, intravenous epoprostenol was
the first prostanoid evaluated in PAH [209]. As the half-life
of epoprostenol is <5 minutes, it requires an indwelling
central venous catheter which is connected to an infusion
pump for continuous intravenous administration. Treatment with epoprostenol is complex, uncomfortable and expensive and cannot be considered as an ideal treatment
despite its evident clinical benefit. Common side effects associated with treatment include headache, flushing, jaw
pain and gastrointestinal disturbance [201,210]. The efficacy
of continuous i.v. administration of epoprostenol has been
tested in three unblinded RCTs in idiopathic PAH
[207,211] and PAH associated with systemic sclerosis [212].
Barst and colleagues [183] showed improvement in exercise capacity with an increase in 6-MWD of 47meters
after 12 months of epoprostenol treatment in 81 patients
with idiopathic PAH. Moreover, a significant improvement of survival was observed (no death at three months
of treatment in the group with epoprostenol against 8
deaths in the group receiving conventional treatment including diuretics and anticoagulants [213]. Long-term
persistence of efficacy has also been shown [201,214] in
idiopathic PAH, as well as in other associated PAH
[215,216] and in non operable CTEPH [217]. Long term
effectiveness has never been evaluated prospectively but
retrospective analysis comparing patients treated by
intravenous epoprostenol with data from patients treated
with conventional therapy find meaningful clinical benefit for patients in NYHA FC III or IV [201,214,218,219].
Functional class, hemodynamic parameters and long
term survival were all improved in the group treated
with i.v. epoprostenol.
Epoprostenol had initially been proposed as a bridging
therapy for lung transplantation but it is currently
regarded as the treatment of choice for patients in
NYHA FC IV. If treatment with epoprostenol is necessary, it will be started at low dose of 2-4 ng/kg/min and
is gradually increased to 10-16 ng/kg/min according to
side effects [201]. Treatment interruption secondary to
pump dysfunction or the rupture of the catheter, although rare, can induce serious adverse events [201]. Because of its route of administration, central venous
catheter bloodstream infections can occur, and should
be systematic searched in the context of unexplained
clinical deterioration.
Treprostinil Due to complications related to the central
venous catheter used for the i.v. administration of
epoprostenol, other prostacyclin agonists have been developed. Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue which benefits
from a longer half-life of 58–83 minutes by subcutaneous
administration [220]. It is delivered by a minipump similar
to those used for insulin [221]. A multicenter randomized
trial evaluated subcutaneous administrated treprostinil versus placebo over three months in patients in NYHA functional class II-IV suffering from idiopathic PAH, PAH
related to CHD with a shunt or PAH associated with CTD
[221]. Patients treated with treprostinil increased 6-MWD
and had benefits like quality of life, pulmonary
hemodynamics and improvement of clinical symptoms.
Unfortunately, local side-effects such as pain and inflammation at the injection site are present in the majority of patients treated with treprostinil which often lead to
limitation of increasing dose or treatment cessation.
Intravenous treprostinil is only licensed for the use in
the USA and provides the advantage of less frequent
need for drug reservoir replacement [220]. Inhaled
treprostinil was examined in a placebo-controlled
TRIUMPH-1 study [222], but results of this formulation were not convincing and this product is not yet licensed outside the USA.
Inhaled Iloprost Iloprost is a prostacyclin analogue administered by inhalation or the intravenous route. The
pulmonary vasodilating effects of inhaled iloprost lasts
nearly 45 minutes, therefore six to nine inhalations daily
are needed, with each of them requiring approximately
30 minutes [223,224]. Common side effects of treatment
were cough, flushing, jaw pain and headache [223]. In
the AIR study [223] conducted in at 37 European pulmonary hypertension centers, study participants (idiopathic PAH, PAH associated to systemic sclerosis,
anorexigen associated PAH or non operable CTEPH) in
functional class III or IV were assessed during a three
month period. Patients received a daily inhalation of
2.5 μg or 5.0 μg of iloprost 6 or 9 times a day or placebo.
After 3 months of treatment, 17% of patients receiving
iloprost reached the combined endpoint of improvement
in functional class and 10% gain in 6-MWD as compared to 5% in the placebo group.
Endothelin receptors antagonists
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and therefore plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PAH.
In addition, it is responsible for smooth muscle cell proliferation [158]. Elevated ET-1 plasma levels are found in
patients suffering from PAH and are correlated with poor
prognosis. There are two existing isoforms of ET-1 receptors: endothelin A (ETRA) and endothelin B (ETRB). Activation of ETRA and ETRB on pulmonary artery smooth
muscle cells induce proliferation and vasoconstriction,
whereas activation of ETRB on pulmonary endothelial
cells leads to release of NO and prostacyclin and participate to the clearance of circulating ET-1.

Bosentan Bosentan is an oral active dual ETRA and
ETRB antagonist. Bosentan has been evaluated in PAH
(idiopathic, associated with CTD, and Eisenmenger’s syndrome) in five RCT’s (Pilot, BREATHE-1, BREATHE-2,
BREATHE-5, and EARLY) that have shown improvement
in exercise capacity, functional class, haemodynamic,
echocardiographic and Doppler variables, and time to
clinical worsening [107,225-228]. The first placebocontrolled study included 32 patients affected by idiopathic PAH or scleroderma presenting with PAH showing
significant exercise improvement with a gain of 76 meters
after three months of treatment with bosentan as compared to placebo [225].
The BREATHE 1 study confirmed the efficacity of
treatment with Bosentan in more than 200 assessed patients in NYHA functional class III or IV compared to
placebo in a three month trial. After three months of
treatment with bosentan, improvements in NYHA functional class were observed in 42% of patients receiving
bosentan compared with 30% in the placebo arm. 6-
MWD was improved overall to 44 meters in favor of
bosentan. Furthermore, delayed time to clinical worsening was also noted as well as better results in dynpnea
scores [226]. One accepted common side effect of treatment is increase in liver enzymes; this is why monthly
monitoring of liver transaminases is mandatory in all patients receiving bosentan. Treatment is started at a dose
of 62.5 mg twice a day and increased to the dose of
125 mg twice daily after one month of treatment.
Subsequently published data of treatment with
bosentan suggested persistent improvements in pulmonary hemodynamics, exercise capacity and modified
NYHA functional class and possibly survival rate of patients [229-231]. Results from the EARLY study (doubleblind, randomised controlled 6 months trial) showed
that the effect of the dual endothelin receptor antagonist
bosentan in patients with mildly symptomatic PAH
could be beneficial for PAH patients in NYHA functional class II [228].
Ambrisentan Ambrisentan is a selective ETA receptor
antagonist administrated once daily at a dose of 5 mg or
10 mg. Two large RCTs (ARIES I and II, i.e.
Ambrisentan in Pulmonary Hypertension, Randomized,
Double blind, Placebo-controlled Multicenter, Efficacy
Studies I and II) have demonstrated efficacy on symptoms, haemodynamics and time to clinical worsening of
patients with idiopathic PAH and associated to CTD
and HIV infection [232]. An extension study of the
ARIES study is the recently published ARIES-E study by
Klinger and colleagues [233]. They followed patients for
a mean period of 60 weeks in where patients underwent
hemodynamic evaluation. The authors concluded that
treatment with ambrisentan leads to hemodynamic stability in PAH patients.
Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors
NO is a potent pulmonary arteries SMC relaxant that
disposed vasodilator activity through up-regulation of
its associated down-stream signalling molecule, cyclic
GMP (cGMP), metabolism of which is dependent on
the activation of a number of PDEs [208]. Phosphodiesterase type 3, 4 and 5 are the three main types of
this enzyme found in pulmonary artery contractive
cells. PDE-5 is the most abundantly expressed isoform
in pulmonary circulation which was confirmed by
several experimental investigations showing a beneficial effect of PDE-5 inhibitors on vascular remodelling and vasodilatation [234,235].
Sildenafil Sildenafil is an oral PDE-5 inhibitor that is
available in Europe since 2005 for PAH patients in
functional class II-III whereas this drug is licensed in
Canada and the USA for patients in functional class IIIV. Basis for the authorization of this drug in the setting of PAH was a large randomized, placebocontrolled trial in which different doses of sildenafil
were assessed in 278 patients presenting with idiopathic PAH, PAH related to CTD or congenital systemic to pulmonary shunts surgically corrected. The
majority of study patients were in functional class IIIII. After three months of treatment, the mean
placebo-adjusted changes in 6-MWD for 20 mg, 40 mg
and 80 mg doses of sildenafil were 45 meters, 46 meters and 50 meters, respectively. Furthermore, significant hemodynamic and functional class improvements
were noted in every sildenafil group as compared to
placebo. Common side effects of treatment with sildenafil include headache, flushing and dyspepsia but
no hepatic enzymes increase was noted as compared
with endothelin receptor antagonists. Long term extension data from 222 patients who completed one
year of sildenafil monotherapy with a dose of
80 mg three times daily showed encouraging results
with a gain in 6-MWD, suggesting a durable treatment
effect [236]. However, sildenafil approval in Europe is
currently limited to 20 mg three times a day. No data is
currently available on the long-term efficacy of this
lower dosage.
Tadalafil Another PDE-5 inhibitor is tadalafil which was
granted for use in patients with PAH in Europe and
North America in 2009. Galiè and colleagues [237]
assessed in the PHIRST trial 405 randomly assigned patients who were either treatment naïve or already receiving bosentan therapy to placebo or one of the several
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 19 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

proposed doses of tadalafil 2.5 mg or 10 mg or 20 mg or
40 mg once daily for a period of three months. At study
completion, patients receiving tadalafil showed an overall mean placebo-correlated increase in 6-MWD of 33
meters [208]. Thus, this increase was dose-dependent,
with only the 40 mg dose achieving the prespecified
value for statistical significance for improvement. Data
analysis of comparative hemodynamic data from 93 patients who underwent repeat RHC has significant reduction in mPAP and PVR under treatment with tadalafil.
Barst and co-authors [238] underlined favourable effects
with tadalafil 40 mg among patients receiving background bosentan, although improvements were less
marked compared with treatment naïve cohort.
Combination therapy
Another therapeutic option is to combine drugs with
different mechanisms of action, in order to optimize
clinical benefit while minimizing side effects. The two
possible strategies for combination therapy are either to
add a new medication to an ongoing treatment (sequential combination) or in first intention by starting from
the beginning with a combination treatment. The
BREATHE-2 trial compared the association of i.v.
epoprostenol and oral bosentan with i.v. epoprostenol
and placebo among 33 patients with severe PAH over a
12 weeks period [227]. Reduction in pulmonary vascular
resistance was greater with combination therapy, although it did not reached statistical significance. Furthermore, no benefit could be shown on the 6-MWD
with combination therapy compared to epoprostenol
alone (+ 68 m and + 74 m, respectively). These results
however may be related to the small number of patients
and the short term follow up in the context of the
addition of a treatment to a drug already known to bring
an important benefit in severe PAH patients. In a recent
controlled trial, the sequential addition of oral sildenafil
80 mg three times daily for patients already receiving i.v.
epoprostenol with insufficient improvement, proved to
be more effective than the placebo on the 6-MWD and
hemodynamic parameters. Indeed, there was a significant reduction in the number of patients showing clinical worsening and an improvement of survival among
most severe patients [239]. There is currently no data on
the addition of bosentan in such context. The combination of iloprost to bosentan in patients with idiopathic
PAH or associated PAH in NYHA functional class III
was shown to be significantly better than placebo and
bosentan in terms of 6-MWD (+ 26 m), NYHA functional class and on post inhalation hemodynamic parameters (PVR −26.4%) [240].
Several uncontrolled studies evaluated the efficacy of
other associations with encouraging results. The openlabel sequential addition of bosentan or sildenafil to
epoprostenol, treprostinil or iloprost was shown to be of
interest [241-243]. Also, the association of ERA and
PDE5, both available in oral form, offers an interesting
option [244,245]. Currently, the limited data precludes
consensus on which combined treatment or strategy
should be preferred. Also, no long term evaluation of
combination therapy is available.
The best strategy of combination therapy should be
discussed in the next world symposium of Pulmonary
Hypertension. Current ERS/ESC guidelines propose sequential combination therapy without any recommendation regarding the best way to associate available specific
PAH therapies.
Potential future therapies
Macitentan
Macitentan, also called ACT-064992, is a novel, highly
potent, tissue-targeting dual ET-1 receptor antagonist
characterized by a high lipophilicity [247]. Macitentan
has been tested in the largest, long-term, event-driven
randomized, controlled study (SERAPHIN, Study with
an Endothelin Receptor Antagonist in Pulmonary arterial
Hypertension to Improve clinical outcome) [246]. The
Seraphin study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of macitentan through the primary endpoint of
time to first morbidity and all-cause mortality event in
742 patients with symptomatic PAH. Patients were
treated for up to three and a half years.
Macitentan has met its primary endpoint, decreasing the
risk of a morbidity/mortality event over the treatment
period versus placebo. Secondary efficacy endpoints, including change from baseline to month six in 6-MWD, change
from baseline to month six in NYHA FC and time – over
the whole treatment period - to either death due to PAH or
hospitalization due to PAH, also showed a dose-dependent
effect. Treatment with macitentan in this study was well tolerated; headache, nausea and vomiting were reported as
minor adverse events [248]. The safety set comprised 741
patients, who received at least one dose of study treatment
(placebo, 3 mg or 10 mg). The number of adverse events
reported and patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was similar across all groups. Similar elevations
of liver aminotransferases greater than three times the upper
limit of normal were observed in all groups. In addition, no
difference was observed between macitentan and placebo in
terms of fluid retention (edema). A decrease in hemoglobin -
reported as an adverse event - was observed more frequently on macitentan than placebo, with no difference in
treatment discontinuation between groups.
Vardenafil
Vardenafil is another PDE5 inhibitor. Recently published
data from a prospective, randomised study including 66
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 20 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

patients with PAH suggests improvement in 6-MWD and
hemodynamic parameters after 3 months of treatment with
vardenafil as compared to placebo. Side effects are not
reported and proposed dosage is 5 mg twice daily [249].
However, further studies are needed.
Riociguat
Endothelium-derived NO regulates vascular homeostasis
through pulmonary arteries SMC relaxation via the activation of the second messenger cGMP. The clinical benefits
associated with the PDE-5 inhibitor class has led to interest
in testing whether other agents that modulate NO signaling
might be similarly beneficial in PAH. Riociguat is a firstin-class drug that augments cGMP biosynthesis through
direct stimulation of the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase
(sGC) promoting vasodilatation by direct stimulation of
sGC in an NO-independent fashion, and by sensitization of
sGC to low endogenous NO levels [250].
A phase I randomized placebo-controlled study in 58
healthy male subjects were given riociguat orally was
designed to test the safety profile, pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of riociguat
(0.25–5 mg). A proof-of-concept study was conducted
to investigate oral riociguat in patients with moderate to
severe PH in a two-part, non-randomized, open-label,
single center trial [251]. Riociguat was well tolerated in
doses up to 2.5 mg, whereas 5 mg caused asymptomatic
hypotension in one patient. Therefore the 2.5 mg dose
was used in the second part of the trial to demonstrate
efficacy. Riociguat significantly reduced mPAP, PVR and
systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac index
[251]. Results from a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase II trial involving 75 patients with PAH
(n = 33) and chronic thrombo-embolic PH (n = 42)
showed that 12 weeks of oral riociguat given 3 times
daily conferred improvements in symptoms, NYHA FC,
exercise capacity, NT-proBNP level, and pulmonary
hemodynamics [252]. Riociguat is also under investigation in other form of PH as PH associated with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, with interstitial lung disease or with left ventricular dysfunction [253-255].
The Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled PATENT-1 study investigated the efficacy and
safety of riociguat in patients with symptomatic PAH
[256]. Treatment-naïve patients and patients pre-treated
with ERAs or prostacyclin analogues were eligible.
Riociguat was titrated from a starting dose of 1 mg three
times daily (t.i.d.) [range 0.5–2.5 mg t.i.d.]. The primary
outcome was the change from baseline in 6-MWD at
week 12. Secondary endpoints included the change from
baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), NTproBNP, NYHA FC, clinical worsening, living with PH
questionnaire and Borg dyspnea score. A total of 445 patients were randomized. Preliminary analysis showed a
significant increase in 6-MWD from baseline of 35.8 m
with riociguat versus placebo (95% CI 20.1–51.5 m, p <
0.0001). Predefined exploratory analyses indicated that
riociguat improved 6-MWD in pretreated patients
(+35.7 m [95% CI 15.0–56.3 m]) as well as treatment
naïve patients (+38.4 m [95% CI 14.5–62.3 m]). Significant improvements were also seen in PVR (p < 0.0001),
NT-proBNP (p < 0.0001), functional class (p = 0.003),
clinical worsening (p = 0.0046), living with PH questionnaire (p = 0.002) and Borg dyspnea score (p = 0.002).
Riociguat was well tolerated and had a favorable safety
profile. Thus, riociguat may represent a new treatment
option for patients with PAH. An open-label extension
study (PATENT-2) will evaluate the long-term safety of
riociguat in patients with PAH.
Selexipag
Selexipag is an orally active prodrug metabolized to
the highly selective prostacyclin IP receptor agonist
ACT-333679 (previously known as MRE-269), which
has a half-life of over 6 h [257]. With in high selectivity for the IP receptor over other prostanoid receptors (at least 130-fold selectivity), selexipag can be
distinguished from beraprost or iloprost currently
used in the management of PAH [258]. With no affinity for the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (EP3),
selexipag exerts similar vasodilatory activity on both
large and small pulmonary arterial branches [259] and
its relaxant efficacy is not modified under conditions
associated with PAH, whereas relaxation to
treprostinil may be limited in the presence of mediators of disease such as ET-1 [260]. Preclinical study
results showed that twice-daily administration of
selexipag attenuates right ventricular hypertrophy, improves pulmonary hemodynamics, and significantly increases survival in MCT-treated PH rats [259].
A phase II study, involving 43 PAH patients showed
that treatment with selexipag for 17 weeks conferred
significant improvements in PVR (−30.3% versus placebo) compared with placebo [261]. Treatment with
selexipag was well tolerated by most patients in this
study. Adverse events were consistent with the known
side effect profile of IPr agonism such as headache, pain
in extremity, pain in jaw, nausea, and diarrhea. These
side effects decreased over time in patients treated with
selexipag [261].
A phase III randomized trial GRIPHON [262] to
examine the effect of selexipag on morbidity and mortality in PAH is underway and will afford more information
regarding efficacy and safety of selexipag.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
One of the most promising targets in PAH is plateletderived growth factor (PDGF). PDGF has been
Montani et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:97 Page 21 of 28
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/97

implicated in endothelial cell dysfunction and proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells. It has been
suggested that PDGF may play a role in PAH [263-265].
Pulmonary vascular remodelling in different animal
models of PAH was shown to regress with the administration of imatinib mesylate (Gleevec®), a PDGF receptors antagonist approved for the treatment of chronic
myeloid leukaemia [266]. Moreover, case reports suggest
a beneficial effect of imatinib among severe PAH patients and a first randomized (imatinib vs placebo),
double-blind, 24 weeks Phase II study was performed in
59 PAH patients in NYHA functional class II to IV receiving specific PAH therapies [267]. The primary endpoint (6-MWD after 24 weeks) was not different
between 2 groups (+22 m in imatinib group as compared
to placebo) even if a significant improvement of
hemodynamic parameters was observed, especially
among the patients with the most severe hemodynamic
compromise [267]. This preliminary study does not allow
concluding on the potential benefits of imatinib in PAH,
but led to development of a phase III clinical trial
(IMPRES) evaluating imatinib in a randomized controlled
double-blind trial of 24-week, in 202 severe PAH patients
treated with at least two PAH specific drugs. After
24 weeks, a significant improvement in the primary endpoint, 6MWD, was observed (+32 m in imatinib group vs.
placebo) as well as an improvement of secondary endpoints including hemodynamic parameters [268]. However, several cases of subdural hematoma were reported in
patients treated with imatinib: 2 cases in the double-blind
period of 24 weeks and 7 supplemental cases in an openlabel extension phase of the study. The mechanism of
these subdural hematomas is not elucidated and the high
incidence observed may be partly favored by
anticoagulation recommended for PAH patients. Subdural
hematoma is a complication of imatinib previously
reported in other settings where it has been used, including oncology or pulmonary fibrosis. Netherless, this complication has rarely been reported in previous clinical
trials in PAH or in registries. In addition, it has been demonstrated that tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including
imatinib, may have possible cardiac adverse effects on long
term use that might limit its benefice in PAH [269].
According to these results, the benefit/risk ratio of
imatinib in PAH was not considered to be sufficient and
to date, the use imatinib was not recommended in PAH.
Non medical treatment
Balloon atrial septostomy
The presence of a right-left shunt, secondary to congenital cardiac malformation, or a patent foramen oval,
among patients with severe PAH, seems to carry a better
prognosis [270]. Atrioseptostomy is an artificial communication interauricular to decrease the right heart
volume, subjected to a high after load secondary to increased pulmonary resistances [271]. The surgical creation of a right-left shunt decreases right auricular
pressure and increases systemic blood flow, later on, reduction in right ventricular wall tension is expected
[271]. Thus, in spite of arterial desaturation induced by the
shunt, oxygen delivery is improved [271]. Atrioseptostomy
has however never been studied in controlled clinical trials.
However, several experienced teams reported their data and
it seems that immediate mortality is high, reaching 14% during the first week, particularly in the case of severe desaturation and right heart failure [105,271-273]. Among patients
who survived, clinical improvement with regression of
symptoms and gain of functional capacity can be observed.
Atrioseptostomy should only be carried out in centers
with significant experience, both in performance of
atrioseptostomy and management of PAH patients, especially post interventional. The impact of balloon atrial
septostomy on long term survival has not been established
in RCTs [271,274].
Lung transplantation
Lung transplantation was historically the treatment of
choice for severe PAH and remains treatment of choice
if medical treatments are insufficient [197]. However,
this particularly heavy surgery can be proposed only to a
minority of patients suffering from PAH. Moreover,
long-term benefits remain disappointing with approximately 50% survival at 5 years [275]. Early mortality is
mainly related to infectious complications whereas late
mortality reflects mostly chronic rejection such as obliterating bronchiolitis. Mono-pulmonary transplantation
had good long-term results [276,277], but most centers
currently prefer bi-pulmonary transplantation which has
less post-operative complications [278]. Cardiopulmonary transplantation may be necessary for patients presenting with terminal right heart failure or complex
congenital heart disease [279]. In conclusion, PAh is a
rare group of diseases that shares broadly similar pathological features, pathophysiology and clincal presentation. The discovery of the central role of endothelial
dysfunction leads to the development of specific PAH
therapies including prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors. Even these therapeutic
advances, no cure of the disease can be achieved and the
prognosis remains unsatisfactory.
