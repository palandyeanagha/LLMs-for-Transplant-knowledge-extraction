The liver plays a central role in metabolism, protein synthesis and detoxification. It possesses
unique regenerative capacity upon injury. While many factors regulating cellular proliferation
during liver repair have been identified, the mechanisms by which the injured liver maintains
vital functions prior to tissue recovery are unknown. Here, we identify a new phase of
functional compensation following acute liver injury that occurs prior to cellular proliferation.
By coupling single-cell RNA-seq with in situ transcriptional analyses in two independent
murine liver injury models, we discover adaptive reprogramming to ensure expression of both
injury response and core liver function genes dependent on macrophage-derived WNT/βcatenin signaling. Interestingly, transcriptional compensation is most prominent in nonproliferating cells, clearly delineating two temporally distinct phases of liver recovery. Overall,
our work describes a mechanism by which the liver maintains essential physiological functions prior to cellular reconstitution and characterizes macrophage-derived WNT signals
required for this compensation.

The liver is a vital organ with a wide array of functions,
including homeostasis of glucose, protein, and lipid
metabolism; production of bile; synthesis of critical serum
proteins; and metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic toxins1.
The liver experiences frequent toxic insults that can result in
cellular injury and death. Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the
most common cause of toxic liver injury in the United States2.
Another cause for acutely reduced liver function is surgical
resection, often used to remove liver tumors or cancer metastases3. Typically, any injury to the liver is followed by liver
regeneration through cellular proliferation4. While the process
and signals involved in liver regeneration have been studied in
great detail, it remains unclear how an organism can survive the
period immediately following the loss of substantial functional
liver tissue.
Hepatocytes are the major parenchymal cells of the liver and
are organized into lobules with coordinated blood flow from the
portal to the central vein. Within each lobule, hepatocyte gene
expression is heterogenously structured, governed by metabolic
demands and signaling pathways, supporting distinct hepatocellular functionality across the periportal, midlobular, and pericentral zones1. The impact of either zone-specific injury or global
loss of liver mass on gene expression in these different regions has
not been examined.
Pioneering studies on liver regeneration have primarily focused
on the signaling mechanisms that underlie re-establishment of
lost cell mass through hepatocyte proliferation and coordinated
angiogenesis4–7. While cell cycle initiation can be detected at
12–24 h after injury, cell proliferation typically begins only after
~24–30 h and does not peak until ~40–48 h7,8. This is in great
contrast to regenerative responses in other organs, such as skin,
where cell proliferation is initiated within a few hours following
injury8. The reason for this delay in hepatocyte proliferation has
been enigmatic.
Here, we investigate compensatory responses in the liver during key phases of liver regeneration in both a toxic (APAP) injury
model and following surgical resection (partial hepatectomy, PH)
(Fig. 1a). Utilizing the powerful combinatorial approach of SeqWell, a massively-parallel single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq)
platform ideally suited for fragile cells like hepatocytes, and
single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH), we
define transcriptional changes after injury9. We discover that
remaining hepatocytes functionally compensate for lost liver mass
by increased transcriptional output of key hepatocyte genes.
Importantly, hepatocytes also alter their zone-specific functional
identities within the liver lobule to maintain global expression of
select transcripts. We find that hepatocyte functional compensation precedes the peak phase of cellular proliferation and that
cycling cells do not participate in this process to the same degree
as non-cycling hepatocytes during the regeneration phase. Both
cycling and non-cycling cells show upregulation of Wnt signaling
targets—known to play a central role in normal hepatocyte
development, maintenance, and liver regeneration;10–24 we
demonstrate that compensation depends on intact Wnt/β-catenin
activation through macrophage-secreted Wnts. Overall, our
results identify previously unappreciated plasticity among hepatocytes during a newly discovered compensatory phase after liver
injury, as well as Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a therapeutically
relevant pathway for maintaining and re-establishing homeostatic
liver function.
Results
Transcriptional adaption after liver injury. To assess global
transcriptional shifts in hepatocytes at single-cell resolution following acute liver injury, we employed scRNA-Seq to characterize
response dynamics in both PH and APAP models, capturing the
injury, regeneration, and termination phases of liver regeneration4 (Fig. 1b, c). We profiled a total of 16,019 cells across 19
different experiments to an average sequencing depth of >48,000
reads/cell (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c, Supplementary Methods).
Immune and endothelial cell types, as well as low-quality cells,
were filtered out from the dataset, retaining 10,762 high-quality
hepatocyte transcriptomes for subsequent analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e, Supplementary Data 1, Methods). Shared nearest
neighbor clustering (SNN) visualized on a t-Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) plot revealed hepatocyte populations that
cluster by injury model and post-injury time point (Fig. 1d,
Methods). While hepatocytes from each untreated mouse clustered independently, the injury samples grouped by time point
and injury type, rather than mouse of origin, indicating that the
transcriptional response to injury causes individual hepatocytes to
become more similar to one another. To confirm that this clustering captures biological, rather than technical, variation, we
performed differential expression to identify genes unique to each
cluster. Clusters were defined by many genes related to liver
function, injury response, and oxidative stress (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Data 3), and technical gradients led to variation within,
rather than across, clusters (nGene, nUMI; Supplementary Fig. 2).
Regression over technical variables (i.e., number of genes) largely
removed these technical gradients, but preserved other, biologically important signals; removal of PC1, which captured technical
effects, similarily resulted in a reduction of technical signals while
preserving key biological ones. Since regression changed very
little, other than downweighting technical differences in cell
quality, and the biological signals on which this work focuses
were robust to regression, we opted to use the non-regressed
dataset in our downstream analysis to avoid possible introduction
of artificial variation.
APAP injury resulted in pericentral necrosis after 6 h as
demonstrated by histological analysis (hereafter A6; Fig. 1b, c).
Hepatocytes scoring high for a pericentral hepatocyte signature
(PCHSig) were absent at 6 h post-APAP (A6, Fig. 1f). Surprisingly, at 24 h post-APAP, the pericentral hepatocyte expression
signature returned (A24, Fig. 1f), despite histology showing
persistent pericentral necrosis (A24, Fig. 1b, c). In particular,
expression of two typically pericentrally restricted genes—Cyp2e1,
responsible for metabolizing APAP, and Glul, which assimilates
ammonia into glutamine—was maintained, or returned, following
pericentral injury. For example, Cyp2e1 + hepatocytes decreased
from 67% (Untreated, UT) to 5% (A6), but returned back to 46%
by 24 h with no significant change in the number of Glul +
hepatocytes at any time point. These results suggest the intriguing
possibility of compensatory expression of pericentral genes by
non-pericentral hepatocytes.
scRNA-seq is a powerful tool for determining global
transcriptional changes in subsets of cells from a heterogenous
organ, such as the liver; however, meticulous validation is
necessary to overcome some limitations of this rapidly-evolving
technology, such as inefficiencies in transcript capture. To
validate these findings in a spatiotemporal context, we assessed
the distribution of the pericentral markers Cyp2e1 and Glul using
highly sensitive smFISH analysis (Fig. 2a–e; Supplementary
Figs. 3, 4). Cyp2e1 extended further into the lobular midzone
following APAP exposure, with pericentral necrosis at A6 and
A24 (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4). Expression then normalized
at A48, following the cell proliferative response. Glul expression is
normally restricted to a single layer of cells surrounding the
central vein25, which underwent necrosis following APAP
overdose (Fig. 2b). Surprisingly, we observed that Glul was now
expressed at low levels across the entire liver lobule (A6, A24,
Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 4). Glul expression patterns return to

normal by A48 (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 4). These findings
reveal compensatory expression of pericentral genes through
adaptive reprogramming of midzonal hepatocytes after pericentral toxic injury.
In contrast to APAP, PH does not result in zone-dependent
injury but represents a massive loss of ~70% of liver cell mass
(compared to ~10% total cell loss after APAP injury), imposing
extreme functional demand on remaining hepatocytes. Similarly
to APAP toxicity, functional compensation was also observed
after PH, evident from a dramatic increase in Glul + hepatoctyes
(Fig. 1g) from 18% (Control) to 60% (P3). This is further
supported by the observation that Cyp2e1 + hepatocytes only

decrease by 18% (67 to 49%) at P3 (Fig. 1g). smFISH analysis
confirmed expanded expression zones and total expression levels
for both Cyp2e1 and Glul in PH (Fig. 2c, e; Supplementary Fig. 4a,
b). In addition, we observed functional compensatory upregulation of the periportal marker Arg1, suggesting that adaptive
reprogramming of hepatocytes is not exclusive to pericentral
genes (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). These results highlight that
hepatocytes alter their transcriptional output to maintain the
expression of zonally expressed genes otherwise lost due to injury.
Liver injury causes both injury- and non-specific responses. To
further define shared and unique responses in both liver injury
models, we determined differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
between each treatment condition and untreated controls (UT),
and then pooled results to reveal composite DEG results for
APAP and PH (Methods, Supplementary Data 4), for which we
performed specific validations using smFISH (Fig. 3, Supplementary Figs. 6–10). A number of gene expression alterations
could be attributed to injury-specific effects. A large number of
gene expression changes, however, were shared between the two
models, indicating that they do not reflect the specific nature of
injury (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 5).
Gene set analysis (GSA) revealed an enrichment of pathways
involved in toxic injury within the APAP model (Supplementary
Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 6)26. The PH model, meanwhile,
exhibited an enrichment among pathways involved in cell proliferation, possibly due to differences in the extent of injury
between the two models (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary
Data 6). Following APAP overdose, there was a substantial antioxidant response by GSA and expression of individual antioxidant response genes, such as thioredoxin reductase (Txnrd1)
and glutamate-cysteine ligase subunit c (Gclc) (Fig. 3b). Surprisingly, smFISH analysis revealed an upregulation of Txnrd1 and
Gclc across the entire liver lobule reaching into the periportal
region (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Figs. 6–10). These findings suggest
that some injury responses are not exclusive to lobular localization of injury.
DEG analysis further highlighted the breadth of the functional
compensatory response with a large number of the most
significantly upregulated genes being involved in classic hepatic
functions, such as secreted protein synthesis, gluconeogenesis,
blood clotting, and ion homeostasis (Fig. 3, Supplementary
Figs. 6–10). Albumin is the most abundant serum protein and is
produced by all hepatocytes across the liver lobule, with the
highest expression in the periportal region. Acute injury in both
models resulted in a dramatic upregulation of albumin across the
entire liver lobule beginning at the earliest observed time points
(A6 and P3) (Fig. 3c). However, most genes involved in essential
liver function responded at a level correlated to the extent of
injury (Fig. 3b–e, Supplementary Figs. 6–10, Supplementary
Data 5). This is consistent with the larger total loss of hepatocytes
in the PH model compared to the APAP model (~70% vs. ~10%,
respectively), resulting in a greater need for functional compensation. These findings highlight not only the rapidity of hepatic
functional adaptation but also the plasticity of hepatocytes across
the liver lobule.
Proliferation is inversely correlated with functional adaptation.
Liver regeneration research has traditionally focused on hepatocyte proliferation4–7. It is unknown whether actively dividing
hepatocytes can equally contribute to functional compensation.
We observed a down-regulation of many hepatic function genes
during activation of the proliferative response (A24, P48,
Fig. 3b–e). Therefore, we identified cells that became transcriptionally active for cell cycle genes in the scRNA-Seq dataset
(Fig. 4a), and analyzed hepatocyte-specific transcript output
compared to those cells at all time points that are not cycling.
Compared to non-cycling cells (NC), there was a significant
down-regulation of the Hepatocyte Signature Score in cycling
cells (CC) in both injury conditions (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary
Fig. 11, Methods). DEG revealed substantial differences between
cycling and non-cycling cells. CCs expressed many classic cell
proliferation markers and exhibited down-regulation of many
hepatic function genes (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Data 7). Proliferating hepatocytes in general scored lower for hepatocyte
markers. This was corroborated in individual cells by co-staining
for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and either the
glucose transporter Slc2a2 or serum protein Alb by smFISH
(PCNA IF/smFISH, Fig. 4e). Additionally, the cell cycle inhibitor
p21 is upregulated following acute injury leading to the observed
delay in cell proliferation27. scRNA-seq data corroborated this
previously described observation (Fig. 4f). Further, smFISH
analysis of both p21 and functional compensatory genes (Fig. 4g,
Supplementary Fig. 11) show a correlation between p21 expression and the functional compensatory response. Taken together,
these data suggest that the functional compensatory response is
strongest in non-proliferating hepatocytes that are actively
inhibited from entering the cell cycle.
To identify pathways and potential upstream regulators
involved in cell cycle activation, we performed GSA over DEG
calculated between CCs and NCs from A24 and P48, revealing an
upregulation of cell cycle-related pathways. Further, there was a
strong enrichment for Wnt/β-catenin-related pathways (Supplementary Fig. 11). It has been shown extensively that Wnt
signaling is involved with normal hepatocyte turnover and liver
regeneration10,12–24. These Wnt factors are derived from the
endothelium and contribute to the activation of hepatic
progenitor cell genes (Axin2, Tbx3, and Sox9)17,28. We observed
upregulation of Axin2, Tbx3, and Sox9 in each acute injury
model, with expression reaching multiple cell layers into the
midzone (Supplementary Fig. 12). These data support activation
of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to injury, which may be
co-localized with the induction of genes associated with hepatic
plasticity17,29.
Wnt mediates functional compensation in addition to proliferation. Given the demonstrated role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in establishing liver zonation and proliferation during liver

regeneration, we investigated whether Wnt signaling might activate adaptation of already present hepatocytes to maintain
essential hepatic function18,30–36. scRNA-seq data corroborated
previous observations of increased Wnt activity in proliferating
hepatocytes (Fig. 5a)22,33,37. Further, it revealed activation of Wnt
target gene expression in the majority of hepatocytes in both the
APAP and PH models, preceding the onset of cell proliferative
activity (A6 and P3, Fig. 5b).
To identify if the hepatic compensatory response following
injury is dependent on Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we evaluated
conditional Wntless (Wls) KO mice with impaired Wnt processing
and secretion as well as hepatocyte-specific β-catenin KO mice
after acute injury (Fig. 5c)18,38 (Supplementary Fig. 13). This
strategy enabled identification of the cellular source of secreted
Wnt ligands responsible for the functional compensatory response.

resulted in a down-regulation of hepatic function genes at baseline
consistent with the role of Wnt signaling in hepatic function33,39,40
(Fig. 5d, e). Importantly, EC-Wls-KO mice can still transcriptionally compensate following PH but have altered cell proliferation
(Fig. 5d, e and Supplementary Fig. 14c)18. In contrast, loss of Wnt
processing in macrophages of Mac-Wls-KO mice resulted in
down-regulation of all examined hepatocyte genes after injury with
complete loss of transcriptional compensation following PH.
Proliferative capacity was modestly decreased, yet overall maintained (Fig. 5d, e and Supplementary Fig. 14)41. Resident hepatic
macrophage numbers and geographic distribution were similar

macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e). The number of detected
transcripts decreased substantially with increased distance from
macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 14f). These data reveal a
dichotomy of the function of Wnt signaling within the regenerating liver, where macrophage-derived Wnts are required for the
observed functional compensation following PH, while
endothelium-derived Wnts are more important for the cell
proliferative response. In contrast, livers of Mac-Wls-KO mice
maintained the ability to functionally compensate following APAP
injury (Fig. 5d, e), suggesting an alternate injury-dependent
mechanism for the functional compensatory response.
To investigate the role of intact β-catenin activity on functional
compensation, hepatocyte-specific β-catenin KO mice were
subjected to acute liver injury (PH) (Supplementary Fig. 13),
which revealed that functional compensation is β-catenindependent for select genes, such as Alb, Glul, and Cyp2e1.
However, Arg1 is still compensatorily expressed even following βcatenin loss. These findings indicate that both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling may play a role in functional
compensation of select genes.
Discussion
The liver uniquely maintains complex metabolic function
throughout injury and subsequent regeneration to enable survival
of an organism42,43. It has long been thought that the liver has
sufficient functional reserve to maintain these functions through
excess baseline capacity43–47, but the exact hepatic reserve capacity has been mostly a theoretical concept. Liver injury induces a
regenerative response where functionally active hepatocytes are
the major contributor to cellular regeneration. Turnover of
hepatocytes in the uninjured organ is typically slow, with the
entire liver being repopulated by new hepatocytes after ~ 1
year17,48. The liver can quickly respond to an acute insult, however, through activation of a regenerative response. Liver regeneration within the mouse model shows a peak of hepatocyte
proliferation between 30 and 36 h for both PH and APAPinduced injury49,50. Cell cycle genes are activated well before
hepatocyte proliferation begins (priming phase) following
injury42,43,51. Cell cycle inhibitors, such as p21 and p27, however,
are concurrently upregulated early in liver regeneration and block
progression of hepatocytes into the cell cycle27,52. It has been
speculated that this co-expression of both stimulators and
repressors of the cell cycle aides in the control of liver regeneration to a precise endpoint42.
Here, we discover a mechanism by which the liver maintains
essential function through transcriptional compensation prior to
the proliferative response. Hepatocytes upregulate transcription
of important liver genes, typically by adapting gene expression
patterns extending beyond homeostatic zonal boundaries.

Importantly, many hepatocyte function genes are expressed or
upregulated predominantly in non-proliferating hepatocytes,
while those cells that enter cell cycle express hepatocyte function
genes at lower levels. This suggests the presence of a division-oflabor between hepatocytes contributing to the maintenance of
hepatic function and those responsible for the proliferation
response and a return of cellular mass. Further investigation is
needed to determine if select sub-populations of hepatocytes exist
that contribute to each aspect of the response or if this dichotomy
is present due to the differential availability of energy and cellular
building blocks. Collectively, our data define a compensatory
phase following liver injury, thereby complementing previous
studies which have elegantly established the field of liver regeneration by focusing on the hepatocyte proliferative response4–8.
We define a dual role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in liver
regeneration: it not only promotes cell proliferation and cellular
recovery, as previously demonstrated in multiple studies10,12–24,35,36,
but is also required for functional compensation (Fig. 6). We identify
macrophages, but not endothelial cells, as the main source of
secreted Wnts that enable transcriptional compensation, particularly
following massive loss of hepatic tissue after PH. Further investigation will be necessary to determine whether other signals are
involved in this process dependent on the extent and nature of
injury, particularly for APAP toxicity and other forms of chemical
liver injury. The contribution of macrophage-dependent Wnts to
transcriptional compensation complements other studies, which
have highlighted the role of endothelial-derived Wnts to maintain
hepatic zonation, as well as both endothelial- and macrophagesecreted Wnts to enable cellular proliferation15,18,41,53,54. Our results
establish that macrophages, which are responsible for broad
inflammatory and immunologic functions55, are also essential for
delivering Wnts locally throughout the entirety of the hepatic lobule,
both in midzone and periportal areas, because of their ability to
migrate and release Wnt ligands throughout the tissue. It has been

previously shown that an increased amount of Wnt ligands spanning many members of the family are detectable across the liver
lobule during liver regeneration18. In particular, Wnts 2b and 9 are
primarily upregulated in endothelial cells and macrophages. Further
investigation will be needed to determine whether specific Wnt
ligands initiate the functional compensatory response during liver
regeneration or if all ligands can contribute equally. Additionally, the
roles of both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling to control
compensation of individual genes and specific cellular functions
need to be elucidated. Our findings further highlight the potential of
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a therapeutic target in acute liver
failure and other liver pathologies, where maintenance of liver
function is essential. Future studies will be needed to identify specific
Wnt ligands to promote liver function, regeneration, and survival in
regard to multiple pathologies that result in acute liver failure.
Methods
Animals. Three-month-old, male, C57BL/6J mice, purchased from Jackson
Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA), were used in acute liver injury studies (APAP
and PH). β-catenin KO studies were conducted using Alb‐cre+/−;Ctnnb1flox/flox
mice. Wntless KO studies were conducted using Lyve1‐cre+/–;Wlsflox/flox (endothelial cell, EC-Wls) and Lyz2‐cre+/–;Wlsflox/flox(macrophages, Mac-Wls). All
animals were housed in Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care—accredited facilities under a standard 12-h light/dark
cycle at 71 °F and 30–70% humidity with access to chow and water ad libitum.
Partial hepatectomy studies were approved by the University of Kansas Medical
Center and University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC). APAP studies were approved by the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center and Brigham and Women’s Hospital IACUCs. Wnt studies were
approved by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center IACUC. All relevant
guidelines for work with mice were adhered to during this study.
Acetaminophen (APAP) exposure. Mice were fasted 12 h before administration
of APAP. APAP was dissolved in warm 0.9% saline, and mice were injected with
300 mg/kg APAP, i.p. Food was returned to the mice after APAP treatment. Mice
were then used for isolation of primary hepatic cells for single-cell RNA-sequencing or tissue harvest for further downstream analysis.
Partial hepatectomy. Partial hepatectomy surgeries were performed as previously
described52. Mice were euthanized at 3 h, 48 h, and 5 days post-partial hepatectomy
by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia and livers were harvested for
downstream analysis. Further, mice were used for isolation of primary hepatic cells
at 3 h, 48 h, and 5 days post-partial hepatectomy.
Tissue harvest. Untreated (n = 3 for each sex) and APAP-treated mice (n = 3 for
6, 24, 48, and 96 h following APAP exposure and 3, 48, and 120 h following PH)
were euthanized by cervical dislocation following carbon dioxide exposure. A
portion of liver tissue was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h and
further processed to obtain paraffin blocks and 5 μm thick sections. A portion of
liver tissue was frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium and used to
obtain 10 μm fresh frozen sections.
Isolation of primary hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. Mouse hepatic
cells were isolated by a modification of the two-step collagenase perfusion
method53. Cells were isolated from untreated (n = 3 for each sex), APAP-treated
mice (n = 2 for each sex at 6, 24, 48, and 96 h following APAP exposure), and mice
subjected to partial hepatectomy (n = 3; 3 h, 48 h, and 5 days). The digestion step
was performed using Liver Digest Medium (Cat. #17703034; ThermoFisher Scientific; Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Cell suspensions were used immediately for SeqWell.
Library preparation and sequencing. Sequencing libraries were prepared from the
single-cell suspension using the Seq-Well method as described in Gierahn et al. 9.
Briefly, a microwell array was loaded with barcoded polyT mRNA capture beads
(Chemgenes). Then 200 μl of media containing 15,000 single cells were loaded onto
the array and allowed to settle into the wells by gravity. Membrane sealing, lysis,
hybridization, reverse transcription, exonuclease digestion, second-strand synthesis, PCR, and library construction by Nextera were all performed as previously
described54. Resulting libraries were quantified by Qubit and tape station (Agilent),
and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (UT and APAP samples, 2 arrays per
run) or a NovaSeq (PH samples, 10 arrays per run) 30 cycle, paired end sequence
reads, single 8 cycle index for NextSeq or dual 8 cycle indexes for NovaSeq.
Single-cell sequencing data processing. Sequencing data were demultiplexed
and aligned to mm10 with STAR aligner. Libraries were sequenced to an average
depth of >48,000 reads per cell per sample. See Supplementary Data 1 for additional sequencing and data quality metrics.
Barcodes with fewer than 400 genes were discarded from the genes x cells data
matrix as non-cells, with 16,019 cells remaining. Data were log normalized and
TPM-like (base 10,000) normalized and analyzed using the Seurat package in R54.
The resulting data displayed fairly even nGene and nUMI distributions across each
sample type (Supplementary Fig. 2h). We performed a principal component
analysis (PCA) and selected the top 13 principal components (PCs) for tSNE
dimensional reduction. We then performed shared nearest neighbors (SNN)
clustering, and identified 14 distinct clusters in the data (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d).
We calculated differential expression across the clusters using Wilcox test in the
FindAllMarkers function in the Seurat R package and quantified expression of
marker genes for known liver cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). We
identify nine high-quality hepatocyte clusters, separated by treatment condition;
one low-quality hepatocyte cluster with a high percent mitochondrial content and
low nGene and nUMI; a kupffer cell cluster; a liver endothelial cell (LEC) cluster; a
neutrophil cluster; and a mixed immune cluster, which appears to contain T cells, B
cells and monocytes. We calculated a hepatocyte signature score using
AddModuleScore in Seurat over multiple highly expressed hepatocyte genes which
span the lobule: Apoa1, Glul, Acly, Asl, Cyp2e1, Cyp2f2, Ass1, Alb, Mup3, Pck1,
G6pc, Fabp1.
In order to focus on hepatocyte responses, we subsetted our data to include the
nine high-quality hepatocyte clusters. Following subsetting, we observed a
remaining few cells scoring low on the hepatocyte signature. We filtered out any
cells with a Hepatocyte Signature score less than 3 standard deviations below the
average as non-hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1e). These non-hepatocyte cells
originated primarily from the A6 sample, which had the largest immune
infiltration in response to injury and the highest fraction on non-parenchymal cells

in the total sample. The filtered non-hepatocytes are likely non-parenchymal cells
incorrectly assigned to a hepatocyte cluster by SNN. Following these filtering steps,
we retained 10,833 high-quality hepatocytes for analysis.
Single-cell sequencing data analysis (hepatocyte data). We performed
dimensional reduction and clustering again on our filtered hepatocyte only dataset.
Principal component 1 (PC1) describes 46.9% of and captures technical variation
(nGene, nUMI) in the data (Supplementary Fig. 2e). This is not surprising for a
dataset comprised of a single-cell type. Each of our treatment conditions scores
similarly on PC1 (Supplementary Fig. 2b). PC2 partly captures
pericentral–periportal variation. We identify zonally restricted genes in PC2
loadings (Cyp2e1, Cyp1a2, Gtsm3; Cyp2f2). We also note periportal–pericentral
variation captured in PC4.
To more clearly visualize pericentral–periportal variation, we scored cells on
this pericentral–periportal metric. To generate a list of pericentral genes, we
calculated gene-by-gene correlations with Cyp2e1, a canonical pericentral gene. To
generate a pericentral gene list, we selected genes positively correlated with Cyp2e1,
and to generate a periportal gene list, we selected genes negatively correlated with
Cyp2e1 (Supplementary Data 8). To generate a list of genes to be used for our
signatures, we considered all genes with a Cyp2e1 correlation >0.3 for PCHSig and
a Cyp2e1 correlation < −0.3 for PPHSig. From the genes falling within this range of
values, we selected moderately expressed genes with large variability in expression
across the dataset, removing lowly expressed genes and genes expressed in small
numbers of cells. Positive correlations with Cyp2e1 range from 0.823 (Cyp2c29) to
0.356 (Ang); negative correlations with Cyp2e1 range from −0.569 (Cyp2f2) to
−0.311 (Serpina12). The 0.3/−0.3 cutoff is more than 3 standard deviations above/
below the mean of all gene correlations with Cyp2e1 (mean = −0.01280654; mean
+ 3sd = 0.2605311; mean − 3sd = −0.2861442). We then calculated the
pericentral hepatocyte (PCH) score and periportal hepatocyte (PPH) score using
AddModuleScore for these genes. We then confirmed that PCH Score and PPH
Score are inversely correlated as expected. We observe a pericentral–periportal
gradient across PC2 using these scores (Supplementary Fig. 2). To generate a single
score that captures pericentral–periportal character, we subtracted the PCH Score
from the PPH Score to create the PPH-PCH Score, in which pericentral
hepatocytes will score negatively and periportal hepatocytes will score positively.
We also generated PCH and PPH scores from the zonated hepatocyte genes
data presented in Halpern et al., Table S3. Briefly, we selected non-randomly
zonated genes with a q-value < 0.01, removed lowly expressed genes with a total
average expression lower than the average over the dataset, and split the genes into
percentral or periportal markers based on relative zonal expression. This resulted in
110 genes for PCH and 96 genes for PPH. We calculated module scores with these
gene lists for the dataset. The PCH_Halpern Score did not capture loss of PCH in
the A6 sample as well as the PCH Score calculated above with the Cyp2e1
correlation gene list. The PPH_Halpern Score did not distribute the cells as evenly
over the distribution as the correlation score. These Halpern scores were generated
from a different dataset, which may contribute to their lesser ability to capture
relevant signal in our dataset. Despite these differences, the PCH and PPH
correlation-derived scores correlate well with the Halpern-derived scores (PCH: R2
= 0.567, p < 10e−5; PPH R2 = 0.399, p < 10e−5, Supplementary Fig. 2i, j).
To better visualize the data, we performed tSNE dimensional reduction.
Hepatocytes from all samples look rather similar in lower PCs which describe
shared variation, such as technical differences or cross-lobule variation, while the
higher PCs capture inter-sample variation. We calculated percent variation
captured per PC and generated an elbow plot to determine the correct number of
PCs to use in further analysis. We selected the top 13 PCs to include in our
analysis, which well separated samples by treatment condition and did not appear
to be driven by technical artifacts. We observe a technical gradient across each
cluster (which is orthogonal to the pericentral–periportal gradient across each
cluster), but the clusters themselves do not appear technically driven
(Supplementary Fig. 2h).
Heatmap genes were found using FindAllMarkers in Seurat, Wilcox test, min.
percent = 0.10, thresh.use = 0.25. Mitochondrial and hemoglobin genes were
removed from the list prior to heatmap plotting.
Shared and unique by injury model gene lists were assembled by combining DE
results across all time points for each injury. We ran differential expression using
Wilcox test in the FindAllMarkers Seurat function between each treatment
condition (A6, A24, A48, A96, PH3, PH48, PH120) individually and untreated
(UT) (Supplementary Data 2). We then combined results across all time points
within each injury model to obtain a list of all DEGs from any time point in APAP
experiments (A6, A24, A48, A96) and PH (PH3, PH48, PH120). A small number of
genes were up at one-time point, but down at another. In these cases, the gene was
retained in the list (up- or down-regulated) with the largest magnitude average log
fold-change to capture to more significant change in expression.
We ran pathway analysis on the composite DE results using the piano R package.
Reference gene sets were downloaded from MSigDB (Broad Institute). We used
geneSetStat = “fisher”, adjMethod = “fdr”, and signifMethod = “geneSampling”. We
then parsed the results to identify shared and unique reference gene sets for each
injury. Any reference gene set with a q-value greater than 0.05 was discarded as
insignificant. We then identified reference gene sets with significant overlaps with
only APAP and with only PH composite DE results. To focus on truly unique
responses, we filtered out any reference gene set from the unique tables which had a
q-value < 0.2 for the other injury model. We then identified shared responses by
compiling all reference gene sets with a q-value of < 0.05 in both APAP and PH.
Selected reference gene set −log(q) are plotted in Fig. 3.
To identify cycling cells in the data, we calculated Cell Cycle Score using
AddModuleScore in Seurat over the cell cycle markers56. We classified cells with a
Cell Cycle Score 2 standard deviations above the average as cycling cells (Fig. 4). To
better compare cycling and non-cycling cells (CC and NC, respectively), we
subsetted the data to create a dataset containing all 51 CCs from the A24 condition
and an equal number of NCs also from A24; similarly, we created a dataset
containing all 123 CC from PH48 and an equal number of NCs also from PH48.
Pathway analysis was done on a DE result obtained from comparing 174 CC from
A24 and PH48 against an equal number of NCs from these time points. Piano was
run as described above. Fig. 4 plots −log(q) values for selected reference gene sets
with a q-value < 0.05. Wnt Target Labbe Sig was calculated using AddModuleScore
and the reference gene set LABBE_WNT3A_TARGETS_UP which was identified
as significant in Piano gene set enrichment analysis.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Histology was performed by the histology core at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center using standard procedures and automated
workflow. Samples were processed and embedded following fixation in 10% neutral
buffered formalin for 48 h. Samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5
μm thick. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a Leica autostainer (Leica
Biosystems) with enzyme treatment (1:1000) using standard protocols. The antibody used for assessment of cell proliferation was PCNA (Cell Signaling, Cat.
13110, 1:800), and cell death was ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection
Kit (Millipore, Cat. # S7100). Macrophages were stained using the anti-F4/80 (Cell
Signaling, Cat. 70076, 1:500). Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin,
dehydrated, and film cover slipped. A minimum of four representative images was
captured per slide using the Zen 2 v2.0 software package. TUNEL-positive area,
PCNA-positive cells, and F4/80-positive cells were measured and averaged across
the four images for each sample using ImageJ v2.0.
Single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH). smFISH was
conducted using RNAscope technology (RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Kit;
Cat. # 320850; Advanced Cell Diagnostics; Neward, CA, USA). Fresh frozen
sections (10 μm thick) were used following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Probe
sets were designed by the manufacturer and can be found at acdbio.com/catalogprobes. Probe sets were chosen for genes that span multiple classic hepatic
functions, such as secreted proteins, gluconeogenesis, blood clotting, ion
homeostasis, and metabolism. and that were among the top 100 DEGs in the
analysis of the scRNA-seq data. A 6 × 6 40x field was captured of a 10 μM z-stack
(0.5 uM per slice) using the NIS-Elements v5.11 software package. This resulted
in multiple liver lobules available for analysis within a single section. Images
were cropped to the size of a single liver lobule and cellular outlines were defined
using CellProfiler v2.255. smFISH signal was then quantified using FISH-quant
v357. Post-processing of mRNA detection was performed with custom-written
Python scripts (available at https://bitbucket.org/muellerflorian/pyfishquant/)57.
Pseudo-color images of transcript abundance were generated by setting the pixel
values of each segmented cells to its corresponding transcript level. To determine
the spatial expression gradients relatively to the central vein, we manually
outlined the vein as a polygon. This polygon served as a reference point to count
RNAs in concentric rings. These counts were lastly renormalized by the ring area
contained within the image. AUC (area-under-curve) for the RNA counts across
the individual lobules was calculated using GraphPad Prism (v8.3.0) with the
average AUC presented with calculated standard deviation. The values are
presented as “Average Total RNA Counts”.
Statistical analysis. We calculated P values for shifts in gene expression or module
scores using the Wilcox test, Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing. Gene set
enrichment results in piano were calculated using Fisher’s test and the gene
sampling method and corrected by FDR. P values for average RNA expression
(smFISH) and IHC counts (PCNA, F4/80, and TUNEL) were calculated using
unpaired, two-tailed, t tests with Welch’s correction. Histograms were tested using
the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Specific tests used for each figure are listed in the
figure legends with represented P values. Statistical analysis of IHC and smFISH
quantification was performed using Graphpad Prism 8 v8.2.1.
