Abstract
Osmotic injury induced by rapid correction of severe chronic
hyponatremia has been implicated in the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Organic osmolytes known previously
as "idiogenic osmoles" accumulate intracellularly to protect
cells from osmotic injury. We investigated the changes of these
organic osmolytes as well as electrolytes in the brain during the
induction and correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using 'Hnuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found
that in rats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d, serum sodium =
109±3 meq/liter), brain concentrations of myoinositol (41%),
glycerophosphorylcholine (45%), phosphocreatine/creatine
(60%), glutamate (53%), glutamine (45%), and taurine (37%)
were all significantly decreased compared with control values
(percentage control value shown, all P < 0.01). The contribution of measured organic osmolytes and electrolytes to the total
brain osmolality change was 23 and 72%, respectively. With
rapid correction by 5% NaCI infusion, significant brain dehydration and elevation of brain Na and Cl levels above the normal range occurred at 24 h. These changes were not seen with
slow correction by water deprivation. Reaccumulation of most
organic osmolytes except glycerophosphorylcholine is delayed
during the correction of hyponatremia and is independent of the
correction rate of serum sodium. It is concluded that: most of
the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be
accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated
with an overshoot of brain sodium and chloride levels along
with a low organic osmolyte level. The high cerebral ion concentrations in the absence of adequate concentrations oforganic
osmolytes may be relevant to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. (J. Clin. Invest. 1991. 88:303-309.) Key

maintain cell volume and cellular functions when extracellular
osmolality increases (1, 2). It is well known that amino acids
such as taurine, glutamate, and glutamine accumulate in the
brain ofexperimental animals with chronic hypernatremia (3-
5). More recently, we and others have demonstrated that
myoinositol, glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC),' and phosphocreatine (PCr)/creatine (Cr) are also important organic osmolytes (6-9). It is estimated that the increase of these measured
organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes can account for virtually all of the observed increase in brain osmolality during
hypernatremic states. The term "idiogenic" to describe these
organic osmolytes is probably outdated (6).
Central pontine myelinolysis, first described by Adams and
his associates (10), is characterized by a loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin with relatively well reserved neuronal cell
body and axons in central basis pontis as well as extra-pontine
sites such as basal ganglia, internal capsule, and cerebellum
(1 1, 12). Clinical studies have suggested that rapid correction of
hyponatremia, especially a large magnitude of correction
(greater than 25 meq/liter in first 24-48 h), may be associated
with this neurological lesion (13, 14). Animal studies have definitively shown that symmetrical demyelinating lesions of the
central nervous system occur after hypertonic infusion for correction of severe chronic hyponatremia (15-18). Slow correction of hyponatremia, however, does not appear to be associated with this neurological lesion either clinically or experimentally (13-17).
It has been postulated that organic osmolytes may play
some role in the pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis
because the accumulation of organic osmolytes would be expected to be outpaced by the rise ofosmolarity during the rapid
correction of hyponatremia. Thurston and others have
previously shown that the brain content of some of these organic osmolytes does not normalize at 9 h after the correction
of hyponatremia with hypertonic saline infusion (9, 19). In this
paper, we have investigated the time course of the changes of
brain water, electrolytes, and the concentrations of the major
organic compounds believed to be important organic osmolytes in rats during rapid or slow correction of chronic hyponatremia.
Methods
Animal models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350 g were
used. Hyponatremia was induced with the methods described by Verbalis and Drutarosky (20). In brief, rats were treated with minipump
(Alzet 2002; Alza Co., Palo Alto, CA) infusion of DDAVP (1-des1. Abbreviations used in this paper: Cr, creatine; GPC, glycerophosphorylcholine; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; PCr, phospho-Cr;

Fort Washington, PA) along with feeding of 40 ml liquid diet (AIN76A; Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA) per day for 3 d. Control rats received
the same diet without DDAVP infusion. Rapid correction was accomplished by a single intraperitoneal injection of 5% saline 2.5 ml/100 g
body weight. Slow correction was accomplished by water deprivation.
The liquid diet was discontinued and rats were allowed ad libitum
normal chow (Wayne Lab Blox; Ralstron-Purina Co., St. Louis, MO).
Daily weight and series of serum Na, K, Cl, osmolarity, and urea nitrogen were determined. Once serum sodium level reached the normal
range, rats were allowed to drink water ad lib. On day 1, 2, and 7 after
initiation of treatment, rats were decapitated and brains were used for
measurement of brain water, electrolytes, and organic osmolytes.
Brain water and electrolyte content. Total brain water content was
measured by weighing before and after desiccation (16 h at 1000C).
The dried residue was subsequently digested with concentrated nitric
acid for 48 h for Na and K measurement using an atomic absorption
spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Co., Norwalk, CT) or with 0.75 N
HNO3 for 72 h for chloride (Cl) measurement using a chloridometer
(Haake-Buchler Instruments, Frankfort, Germany) as described
previously (20, 21).
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Whole brains
were extracted with perchloric acid, then neutralized, lyophilized, and
reconstituted in D20 "spiked" with the sodium salt of trimethylsilylproprionate (TSP; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as an internal
chemical shift and concentration standard (6, 7). 'H-NMR spectroscopy was performed using a 7.05 Tesla, 10-cm vertical-bore cryomagnet, AM-300 spectrometer, and commercial 5-mm probe (Bruker Instruments, Inc., Billerica, MA). 'H-NMR spectra were obtained at 300
MHz using a sweep width of 10 ppm and 16,000 data arrays. 128
transients were collected with 90 degree pulses applied every 10 s and
summed. The free induction decay was Fourier transformed without
further manipulation. All spectra were baseline corrected before peak
integration. The integral of each peak was analyzed relative to the integral of the TSP peak and converted into a chemical concentration, as
described by Gullans and co-workers (7) and reported previously by
our group (6).
High performance liquid chromatography. HPLC was performed
using a Sugar-Pak 1 column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA) as described by Wolff and others (22). An aliquot of 50 !1 of brain extract
was injected and eluted with 0.1 mM calcium disodium EDTA at 0.5
ml/min and 80'C. Metabolites were detected with a refractive index
detector (Altex Scientific, Inc., Berkeley, CA) and analyzed as described previously (6).
Statistics. One way analysis of variance was performed to demonstrate differences among group means. Comparison of group means
with the control was done using Student's t test for unpaired data employing Scheffe's method to correct for multiple comparisons (23). Significance levels are reported at the P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 levels.
Results
Effects ofchronic hyponatremia
Physiologic measurements. All rats survived the induction of
hyponatremia without significant symptoms. Table I shows the
body weight changes during the induction of hyponatremia.
There was a small but significant weight gain 1 and 2 d after
implantation ofthe minipump. This weight gain is due to positive water balance as demonstrated by Verbalis and Drutarosky
in their initial description ofthis hyponatremic rat model (20).

urea nitrogen, and osmolality after induction of chronic hyponatremia. In rats with chronic hyponatremia, serum Na

cantly compared with control rats (all P < 0.01). Serum K and
urea nitrogen levels were not changed in hyponatremic rats.
Brain water and electrolytes. Table III summarizes the effects of chronic hyponatremia on brain water content and
brain electrolyte concentrations. Brain water content was not
significantly different between chronically hyponatremic
(79.0±0.4%) and control (78.6±0.2%) rats. Brain Na (44±2 vs.
56±2 meq/kg H20), K (97±3 vs. 121±4 meq/kg H20), and Cl
(30±3 vs. 42±2 meq/kg H20) in hyponatremic rats decreased
significantly compared with controls (all P < 0.01).
Brain organic osmolytes. Organic osmolytes were measured with NMR spectroscopy and HPLC. Previous studies
from our laboratory have shown that HPLC with a Sugar-Pak 1
column can be used to quantitate myoinositol, GPC, taurine,
glutamine, and urea in brain extract. 'H-NMR can be used to
measure all of these organic osmolytes except urea. Table IV
summarizes the concentrations of individual osmolytes measured with 'H-NMR spectroscopy and HPLC. All measured
organic osmolytes decreased significantly in hyponatremic rats
compared with controls. NMR study showed that the concentration of myoinositol in the brain of hyponatremic rats decreased from 5.1±0.4 to 2.1±0.6 mmol/kg H20; GPC from
1.1±0.2 to 0.5±0.1 mmol/kg H20; PCr/Cr from 3.5±0.2 to
2.1±0.3 mmol/kg H20; glutamate from 11.6±1.0 to 6.1±0.9
mmol/kg H20; glutamine from 4.0±0.3 to 1.8±0.6 mmol/kg
H20; and taurine from 3.5±0.4 to 1.3±0.4 mmol/kg H20 (all P
< 0.01). The results obtained from HPLC were extremely consistent with those from NMR spectroscopy. The brain urea
concentration in hyponatremic rats was not significantly different from that in the control (3.4±0.3 vs. 4.1±0.6 mmol/kg
H20, P = NS).

are osmotically active, thus, the osmotic activity coefficient of
each individual molecule is close to one. The decrease ofbrain
electrolytes accounted for 72% of the observed osmolality
change. Specifically, changes in tissue Na contributed 18%,
changes in tissue Cl 18%, and changes in tissue K 36% of the
change. The contribution ofthe measured organic osmolytes to
the total osmolality change was 23%. Specifically, changes in
the tissue concentrations of amino acids contributed 15%,
changes in tissue myoinositol 5%, and changes in tissue concentrations of GPC and PCr/Cr 3%. Altogether, 95% of the
observed change in brain tissue osmolality was accounted for
by the changes in tissue concentrations of these measured electrolytes and organic osmolytes.
Effect ofcorrection ofhyponatremia
Physiologic measurements. Chronic hyponatremia was corrected either rapidly with hypertonic saline injection or slowly
with dehydration. Among those rats that were allowed to live to
day 7 after initiation of treatment, 4 rats out of 10 died after
rapid correction: 2 on day 3, 1 on day 4, and 1 on day 5; only 1
rat out of 7 died (day 4) after slow correction ofhyponatremia.
With slow correction, the rats lost 11±2% of body weight on
day 1 and 6±2% on day 2 and then gradually regained body
weight to nearly pretreatment values by day 7. With rapid correction, the rats lost 10±3% of weight on day 1 and 7±3% on
day 2. Most ofthem did not gain weight afterward and weighed
77±9% of pretreatment weight on day 7. Fig. 2 A shows the

change of serum Na during the correction of hyponatremia.
With rapid correction, serum Na increased from 109±4 to
138±4 meq/liter within 24 h. The serum Na decreased slightly
to 135±3 on day 2 and was found in normal range on day 7
(142±3 meq/liter). With slow correction, serum sodium increased from I 1 1±5 to 128±4 meq/liter on day 1 and to 140±4
meq/liter on day 2. The serum Na remained in the normal
range thereafter. The changes in serum Cl concentration and
osmolality paralleled the changes in serum Na.
Brain water and electrolytes. Fig. 2 B demonstrates the time
course ofthe changes in brain water content during the correction of chronic hyponatremia. With rapid correction, significant brain dehydration occurred on day 1 with brain water
content falling to 77.4±0.3% of tissue weight compared with a
normal value of78.6±0.2% (P < 0.01). The brain water content
increased to 78.3±0.2% on day 2 and was 78.5±0.2% on day 7.
No brain dehydration was observed during slow correction of
hyponatremia. The brain water content was 78.5±0.2% on day
1, 78.4±0.2% on day 2, and 78.5±0.2% on day 7. Fig. 2, Cand
D shows the time course of the changes in brain Na and Cl
concentrations, respectively. With rapid correction, both brain
Na and Cl increased to a level significantly above normal on
day 1 (Na 65±3 vs. 56±2 meq/kg H20; Cl 52±2 vs. 42±2 meq/
kg H20, both P < 0.01) and returned to normal by day 2. With
slow correction, brain sodium increased to 52±2 meq/kg H20
on day 1 (P < 0.01 vs. rapid correction) and to 57±2 meq/kg
H20 on day 2. Similarly, brain Cl increased to 38±2 meq/kg
H20 on day 1 (P < 0.01 vs. rapid correction) and to 44±2
meq/kg H20 on day 2. Brain K increased more slowly with
rapid correction compared with brain sodium ( 1 1±2 meq/kg
H20 on day 1, 1 15±2 meq/kg H20 on day 2). With slow correction, brain K reached a near normal level on day 2 (107±2
meq/kg H20 on day 1, 116±2 meq/kg H20 on day 2). Therefore, the change in brain K was parallel to the change ofserum
Na with slow correction. With rapid correction, normalization
of brain K occurred 1 d after the correction of serum Na.
Brain organic osmolytes. Table V shows the changes of
brain organic osmolytes during the correction of hyponatremia. Brain urea level was determined by HPLC, and concentrations of other molecules were determined by 'H-NMR spectroscopy. Brain myoinositol concentration decreased on day 1
with either rapid (1.2±0.2 mmol/kg H20) or slow (1.1±0.2
mmol/kg H20) correction of hyponatremia. The myoinositol
concentration then increased to 2.2±0.3 mmol/kg H20 on day
2 and achieved a normal value on day 7 (5.3±0.4 mmol/kg
H20) with slow correction. With rapid correction, brain
myoinositol concentration increased and did not reach normal
by day 7 (4.1±0.3 vs. 5.1±0.4 mmol/kg H20, P < 0.01). With
rapid correction, brain GPC concentration reached the normal
range on day 1 (1.0±0.2 mmol/kg H20) and increased significantly above normal (1.9±0.4 vs. 1.1±0.2 mmol/kg H20) on

day 7. The changes in brain PCr/Cr concentrations were similar with both rapid and slow correction. On day 2, PCr/Cr
concentrations were still significantly below normal with both
forms of correction (rapid correction 2.5±0.3 mmol/kg H20;
slow correction 2.4±0.3 vs. 3.5±0.2 mmol/kg H20, both P

both forms ofcorrection. Brain concentrations ofmajor amino
acid osmolytes including glutamate, glutamine, and taurine
also increased gradually after the correction of hyponatremia.
With rapid correction, glutamate, glutamine, and taurine were

tion, the brain urea content increased significantly to 5.3±0.5
(vs. control 4.1±0.6 mmol/kg H20, P < 0.05) on day 2. The
brain urea concentrations decreased when dehydration was
stopped and were normal range on day 7.
Fig. 3 demonstrates the contributions of both electrolytes
and organic osmolytes to total brain osmolality in control rats,
hyponatremic rats, and rats subjected to both rapid and slow
correction at the time ofnormalization ofserum Na. In control
rats, the ratio ofthe sum oftissue ion concentrations to the sum
of tissue organic osmolyte concentrations was 6.8±0.2. In hyponatremic rats, both electrolytes and osmolytes decreased significantly as described earlier. The ion/osmolyte ratio rose to
10. 1±0.5 (P < 0.01 vs. control). As serum sodium returned to
normal, the sum of electrolytes and osmolytes also reached
normal in both groups of correction. However, with rapid correction, the increase ofosmolality was mainly due to Na and C1
concentrations which are significantly above normal. The ion/
osmolyte ratio was found to increase to 12.5±1.0 with rapid
correction (P < 0.01 vs. control). With slow correction, both
ions and osmolytes increased with an ion/osmolyte ratio of
8.0±0.4 (P < 0.05 vs. control; P < 0.01 vs. rapid correction
group).
Discussion
In this study we investigated the effects ofinduction and correction of chronic hyponatremia on brain water, electrolytes, and
organic osmolytes in rats. Clinical and experimental observations have suggested that rapid correction of severe chronic
hyponatremia (serum Na < 120 meq/liter) is associated with
the development of central pontine myelinolysis (13-18). Verbalis and Drutarosky have demonstrated that chronic hyponatremia induced by the combination of minipump infusion of
DDAVP and feeding of a liquid diet is well tolerated by rats
(20). When the rats with chronic hyponatremia were treated
with hypertonic solution, serum Na was corrected to the normal range within 24 h, and 90% of the rats developed demyelinative lesions (24). In our study, using the same animal model
developed by Verbalis and Drutarosky, we were able to examine the roles of the changes in brain electrolyte and organic
osmolyte concentrations on the pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis.
With 3 d oftreatment with DDAVP infusion and feeding of
a liquid diet, all rats developed profound hyponatremia (serum
sodium 109±3 meq/liter). The brain water content of the hyponatremic rats was not significantly different from the control

electrolyte concentrations were significantly reduced with
chronic hyponatremia. The contributions ofthe loss of Na, K,
and Cl to the total decrease in brain osmolality were: Na, 18%;
K, 36%; and C1, 18% (Fig. 1). The decreases in brain electrolyte
concentrations in response to hyponatremia has been well documented (19-21, 25-28), and our results were quite consistent
with these previous reports in which the contribution of electrolytes to the observed changes in osmolality during hyponatremia ranges from 61 to 74% (20, 21, 25-28). Organic osmolytes also decreased significantly and contributed - 23% ofthe
total decrease ofbrain osmolality in our study. The decrease of
individual organic osmolytes ranged from 40 to 63%. Thurston
and co-workers studying weanling mice with sustained hyponatremia observed that decreases in brain amino acid concentrations accounted for 25% of the observed decreases in brain
osmolality (9, 19). In our study, we measured only glutamate,
glutamine, and taurine concentrations and found that the contribution ofthe changes in concentrations ofthese amino acids
accounted for 15% of the observed decrease in osmolality. It is
likely that the major part of the undetermined molecules in
Fig. 1, which amounts to 5% ofthe total change in osmolality,
can be accounted for by changes in the concentrations of
amino acids that we did not measure. The use of different species, ages of animals, and experimental models probably accounts for the small remaining discrepancy. This 5% ofosmotically-active particles, which are not accounted for in this study,
might also be unmeasured ions or other non-amino acid organic osmolytes.
From our results, we can estimate the contributions ofelectrolytes and organic osmoles to the osmolality changes in the
intracellular and extracellular fluid. Holliday et al. (21) have
found that the contribution of extracellular volume was unchanged in the brain ofrats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d) by
measuring chloride space. In this study, the brain water content
of hyponatremic rats was not significantly different from controls. Therefore, we assume that the contribution of the extracellular volume in hyponatremic rats is the same as that in
control, i.e., - 20% as estimated by van Harreveld (29). In this
compartment, the decreases in Na and Cl concentrations can
account for most ofthe observed decrease in osmolality. Therefore, the contribution ofchanges in intracellular solute concentrations to the change in intracellular osmolality can be estimated as follows: sodium, 10%; chloride, 10%; potassium, 45%;
and organic osmolytes, 35% (assuming the undetermined fraction is also organic osmolytes as discussed above).
The effects of rapid and slow correction of hyponatremia
on brain water and electrolytes were different. Rapid correction, but not slow correction, was associated with brain dehydration and a transient overshoot of brain Na and Cl concentrations. Brain dehydration after rapid correction has been
observed previously. It occurs because of inadequate reaccumulation and resynthesis of intracellular electrolytes and organic osmolytes after a rapid rise in extracellular osmolality.
Sterns et al. also noted the overshoot of brain sodium after
correcting serum sodium from 98 to 129 meq/liter in 9 h. The
brain sodium content became 10% higher than controls in their
study (28). In our rapid correction group, serum Na was
corrected to normal within 24 h. Brain Na and Cl became 16
and 24% higher than control, respectively. On the other hand,
brain K recovered more slowly than brain Na. With this rapid
correction, brain K was still 8% lower than controls when
serum Na was corrected to the normal range. Similar results

were reported by other groups (25, 28). This overshoot ofbrain
Na and Cl is probably due to the bulk flow of cerebrospinal
fluid into the brain in response to acute rising of serum osmolarity. Cserr et al. have shown that the gain of Na and Cl after
elevation of plasma osmolality is mainly from the CSF influx,
while plasma is the source of volume regulatory gain of K (30,
31). The Na from the cerebrospinal fluid diffuses into the interstitial fluid and then enters the cell through a Na+/H' exchange
system. Adler and Simplaceanu have shown that the brain pH
of hyponatremic rats (2 d) was increased from 7.09 to 7.18
when plasma sodium was corrected from 122 to 146 meq/liter
(32). It is likely that the rise of serum Na activates the Na-H
antiporter, therefore, causing an increased intracellular Na and
decreased intracellular proton content. A similar phenomenon
has been observed in many cell culture systems such as in glial
cells (33) and lymphocytes (34).
Most of the brain organic osmolytes recovered slowly in
response to correction of hyponatremia. Brain GPC and glutamate concentrations, however, recovered more quickly. Brain
GPC concentrations returned to the normal range on day 1 in
both rapid and slow correction groups. Glutamate concentrations returned to normal on day 2 with rapid correction and
approached normal range on day 2 with slow correction. The
other brain organic osmolytes did not reach normal concentrations on day 2 in either experimental group. Myoinositol and
taurine concentrations, in fact, decreased on the first day of
correction and, only then, started to increase in both experimental groups. It appears that brain cells regulate the intracellular concentrations oforganic osmolytes quite differently. The
study of the cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of
these organic osmolyte concentrations will be an important
area for further investigation.
When adding all the measured osmolytes together, as
shown in Fig. 2 F, the rate of reaccumulation of osmolytes is
not different between the groups with rapid and slow correction. On day 7, all osmolytes return the normal range in the
group with slow correction. However, in the group with rapid
correction, brain concentrations of myoinositol is lower and
GPC is higher than controls at this time. We are not able to
explain these changes at present. The changes of brain osmolyte concentrations during the correction of hyponatremia in
rats which we observed, were, in general, quite similar to those
observed in hyponatremic weanling mice subjected to a similar
treatment in the study by Thurston et al. (19). However, we
noted in our study that the increases in brain glutamate concentrations during correction was much slower than that observed by Thurston et al. in weanling mice. Again, species difference, age of the animals, and differences in experimental
model can account for this discrepancy.
The results of our study may offer insight into the potential
injury associated with rapid correction of hyponatremia. This
insight is, perhaps, best illustrated in Fig. 3 which demonstrates
the contributions ofboth electrolytes and organic osmolytes to
total brain osmolality in rats subjected to both rapid and slow
correction at the time of normalization of serum Na. The ratio
of the sum of tissue ion concentrations to the sum of tissue
organic osmolyte concentrations was 6.8 in control rats. This
ratio was found to increase to 12.5 with rapid correction but
only 8.0 with slow correction. High ionic strength may be detrimental to cells by a variety of mechanisms including effects on
protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions (1, 2). Yancey and Burg (35), and Yancey et al. (36) showed that a hyperosmolar medium inhibited cell growth and survival of a renal
epithelial cell line measured as colony-forming efficiency. The
addition of organic osmolytes, such as betaine, restored the
colony-forming efficiency, while the inhibition of sorbitol (a
renal osmolyte) synthesis reduced colony-forming efficiency.
These experiments demonstrate that osmolytes have significant protective effects against osmotic stress in cultured mammalian cells. The protective effect of osmolytes has also been
shown in animal studies. Trachtman et al. reported that taurine
depletion rendered kittens more susceptible to chronic hypernatremia judging by higher mortality and seizure activity and
lower brain water content compared with controls (37). Although in our studies, histological examinations of the brain
was not performed, previous studies have clearly demonstrated
that rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia to normonatremic or hypernatremic levels causes demyelinated lesion in basal ganglia, internal capsule, cerebellum, corpus striatum,
brainstem tegmentum, and other areas in the rats (15, 17),
rabbits (18), and dogs (16). More recently, Verbalis and Martinez (24) have demonstrated that demyelination lesions could
be found in 90% ofrats that received hypertonic saline infusion
for rapid correction of hyponatremia, but only 5% in rats
treated with water restriction. The methods of induction and
correction of hyponatremia as well as the degree of hyponatremia and rate of correction in this study are quite similar to
those described by Verbalis and Martinez. Therefore, the observations in this study that the high cerebral ion concentrations achieved without adequate protection from organic osmolytes during rapid correction of hyponatremia, may be relevant to the development ofosmotic demyelination ofthe brain
reported by previous investigators. However, the brain is a heterogeneous organ with many different anatomic compartments and individual cell types. Why certain areas and certain
cell types, such as oligodendrocytes, are more susceptible to the
rapid increase of osmolality is not clear and is currently under
investigation in our laboratory.
In summary, this investigation established that most ofthe
change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be
accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated
with an overshoot of brain Na and Cl levels along with a low
organic osmolyte level. The high ion to organic osmolyte ratio
achieved with rapid correction of hyponatremia suggests that
brain cells could be subjected to ion-induced injury without
adequate protection from organic osmolytes. Whether these
electrolyte and organic osmolyte changes play a role in the
pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis remains to be determined.
