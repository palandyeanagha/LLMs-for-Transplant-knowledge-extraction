Abstract
Background: Jehovah’s Witnesses represent a tremendous clinical challenge when indicated to liver transplantation
because they refuse blood transfusion on religious grounds and the procedure is historically associated with
potential massive peri-operative blood loss. We herein describe a peri-operative management pathway with
strategies toward a transfusion-free environment with the aim not only of offering liver transplant to selected
Jehovah’s Witnesses patients but also, ultimately, of translating this practice to all general surgical procedures.
Methods: This is a retrospective review of prospective medical records of JW patients who underwent LT at
our Institution. The peri-operative multimodal strategy to liver transplantation in Jehovah’s Witnesses includes
a pre-operative red cell mass optimization package and the intra-operative use of normovolemic haemodilution, venovenous bypass and low central venous pressure.
Results: In a 9-year period, 13 Jehovah’s Witness patients received liver transplantation at our centre representing the
largest liver transplant program from deceased donors in Jehovah’s Witnesses patients reported so far. No patient
received blood bank products but 3 had fibrinogen concentrate and one tranexamic acid to correct ongoing hyperfibrinolysis. There were 4 cases of acute kidney injury (one required extracorporeal renal replacement treatment) and
one patient needed vasoactive medications to support blood pressure for the first 2 postoperative days. Two patients
underwent re-laparotomy. Finally, of the 13 recipients, 12 were alive at the 1 year follow-up interview and 1 died due
to septic complications.
Conclusions: Our experience confirms that liver transplantation in selected Jehovah’s Witnesses patients can be feasible
and safe provided that it is carried out at a very experienced centre and according to a multidisciplinary approach.

Background
The religion of Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW) was founded
in the nineteenth century and its community counts
about 250.000 members in Italy (https://www.jw.org/it/
testimoni-di-geova/nel-mondo/IT). Liver transplantation
(LT) is the only therapeutic option for patients with
end-stage liver disease (ESLD) or acute liver failure and
its outcomes markedly improved over the last decades
[1]. Since the risk of life-threatening peri-operative
bleeding in LT remains considerable and JW refuse
blood transfusion on religious grounds, they always represented a tremendous clinical challenge and generated
ethical and legal concerns when indicated to this procedure [2]. At the University of Pisa, Azienda OspedalieraUniversitaria Pisana, we developed a peri-operative management pathway with strategies toward a transfusionfree environment with the aim not only of offering LT
to selected JW patients but also, ultimately, of translating this practice to all general surgical procedures. Since
there are so few LT centers willing to perform LT on

JW patients and literature detailing their peri-operative
care and outcomes is poor, in this report we describe
our experience of LT in JW and analyze feasibility and
safety and evaluate the optimal management.
Methods
This is a retrospective review of prospective medical records of JW patients who underwent LT at our Institution
from 2007 to 2016. The study was approved by the local
ethical committee, Comitato Etico Area Vasta Nord
Ovest, Pisa (Nr 1552; 03/08/2018).
Preoperative management
JW patients were evaluated as per our standard Institutional clinical protocol. For this particular class of patients,
two or more indicators of severe portal hypertension
(platelets < 50 × 103 μL, grade 3 esophageal varices, ascites,
previous variceal hemorrhage and hepatic encephalopathy) were considered contraindications for listing [3] as
well as INR > 2.5 and stage 2 kidney injury according to
the AKIN classification. Patients were deactivated from
the list if, due to worsening of their clinical condition, they
fell outside these criteria. Patients with previous upper abdominal surgery and UNOS status 1 and 2 were also excluded. Once indicated to LT and provided that involved
senior surgeons and anesthesiologists agreed to perform
the procedure, patients were requested to attend two interviews: one in presence of the next of kin and a JW elder
and one alone with our centre’s clinical leadership. All patients were required to sign a consent form that reflected
their wishes formally refusing the use of blood products
even in case of life-threatening anemia and stating the accepted therapies. In fact, since acceptance of blood fractions by JW depends on patient’s free will apart from
church doctrine [4], there are some therapies that all JW
refuse (whole homologous blood and its main fractions:
plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and
preoperative storage of autologous blood for later use during surgery) whereas there are some other treatments that
most, but not all, Witnesses accept (perioperative blood
salvage; products derived from the main components of
blood, such as albumin, clotting factors, antithrombin III,
synthetic hemoglobin, autotransplantation of stem cells,
transplant of solid organs, normovolemic hemodilution).
Finally, some other therapies are accepted by all Witnesses: plasma substitutes, which are not derived from
blood, erythropoietin and hemopoietic agents obtained
from genetic recombination [4]. Therefore, all of the
JW candidate to LT received detailed and written information about each of the available therapies. Following admission to the waiting list, patients showing an
Hemoglobin (Hb) level < 12 mg/dL underwent
hematological consultation in the aim to optimize their
red cell mass. We developed a preoperative protocol for
JW candidates to LT which includes supplementation
with iron or vitamin (vitamin B12, folic acid) and subcutaneous recombinant erythropoietin (40.000 IU weekly).
The hematological package inserts also monthly laboratory checks and interviews in order to adjust treatments.
Transplant candidates with Hb > 12 mg/dL were monitored with regular laboratory checks and, if necessary, they
were included in the optimization protocol.
Intra-operative management
Standard anesthetic management was used as already reported [5]. During hepatectomy and the anhepatic phase
(the time from the physical removal of the native liver
until the revascularization of the graft), patients were
managed by the attending anesthetist aiming at a low central venous pressure (CVP), ideally ≤5 mmHg, by restrictive volume infusion. Intra-operative cell salvage (ICS) and
acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) were adopted
whenever feasible. The ICS (Cell Saver 4, Haemonetics
Corporation, Braintree, MA, USA; Dideco Electa; Sorin
Group, Miradola, Italy) was used in all procedures and its
circuit was maintained in continuity with patient’s circulation. The volume of red cells returned to patients from
ICS was used as an estimation of intra-operative bleeding
[6]. For the purposes of ANH, we contraindicated it in patients with Hematocrit (Hct) < 35%, platelets count <
100.000 and INR > 1.5. In case of ANH, blood was removed from a central line by gravity and drained to a
citrate-phosphate-dextrose (CPD) bag after anesthesia induction with the patient’s intravascular volume being
maintained by infusion of crystalloid solutions. The CPD
tubing remained connected to the patient at all times conforming to the patients’ religious beliefs. Hypothermia was
limited by the use of forced air warmer blankets and intravenous fluids warmers. All LTs were performed using the
conventional surgical technique with vena cava replacement and veno-venous bypass. Coagulation profiles were
tracked using rotational thromboelastography and patients’ approved component therapies were administered
accordingly. Finally, experienced surgeons and anesthetists
were in charge of all cases.
Post-operative management
After surgery, all patients remained under observation in
the ICU and then transferred to the regular ward. Optimal basic conditions for coagulation was ensured and
antifibrinolytic treatment was initiated early if needed. In
case of sub-optimal oxygenation, general anesthesia, intubation and hyperoxic ventilation were considered
early. Post-operative cell salvage of drainage blood was
implemented in case of massive production and surgical
re-intervention was considered immediately in case of
worsening anemia. Laboratory tests were reduced to a
minimum and, if necessary, performed with low volume

blood sampling systems. Postoperativelly, erythropoiesis
was stimulated when needed following the same criteria
and protocol used for pre-OLT preparation.
Statistical analysis
Results are reported as median [IQR]. One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with Tuckey’s correction for multiple comparisons was used for statistical analysis and
the significance was set at p < 0.05. Data analysis was
performed using GraphPad Prism (version 7.00 for
Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Results
Since 2007, 16 JW patients were considered for LT at
our Institution: 3 of them showed more that 2 indicators
of severe portal hypertension and were not admitted to
the transplant whereas the other 13 were listed and received a graft from a deceased donor. Age at the time of
LT was 51 [44.5–57.5] years with a BMI of 23.7 [20.8–
26.9] kg/m2. MELD score, the scoring system for assessing
the severity of chronic liver disease [7], was 15 [12–22]
and the diseases indicating LT were post infection liver
cirrhosis (n = 8, 61.5%) which was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in the 75% of cases (n = 6), alcoholic
cirrhosis (n = 2, 15.4%), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 1,
7.7%), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (n = 1, 7.7%) and
hemochromatosis (n = 1, 7.7%), (Table 1). One patient was
thalassemic and another had a previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt due to repeated variceal
bleeding. Waiting time before LT was 189 [58.5–390.5]
days. Graft’s cold and warm ischemia times were 460
[425.5 to 528.5] and 74 [68–86.5] minutes respectively
and total surgery duration was 435 [420 to 450] minutes.
Patients Hct at the time of listing was 38.5 [35.1–42.3] %
with an hemoglobin level of 12.8 [11.8–15.4] mg/dL. Two
patients needed red cell mass optimization and the
targeted Hct was achieved within 2 months. All of the
transplanted patients agreed to receive AHN, ICS and, in
case of need, coagulation factors concentrates and fibrinogen concentrate. A comprehensive report of patients
hematologic profile is reported in Table 2 whereas Table 3
shows individual data. ANH was performed in 6 patients
with 3 [2.7–3] retrieved Units. The volume of red cells
returned to patients from ICS was 400 [217–720] mL. No
patient received blood bank products, 3 had fibrinogen
concentrate 2 g and one also needed 2 g tranexamic acid
to correct ongoing hyper-fibrinolysis. The amount of
fluids infused during surgery was 3560 [3425–4300] mL,
all balanced crystalloid solutions. ICU and hospital length
of stay were 4 [3–5] and 18 [11–31] days respectively.
There were 4 cases of acute kidney injury (one required
extracorporeal renal replacement treatment). Two patients
received nor-epinephrine at reperfusion (Table 1), in one
of them it was continued for the first 2 postoperative days

(peak dose 2.5 mcg/kg/min) to support blood pressure.
Two patients underwent re-laparotomy: one on postoperative day (POD) #4 for a large abdominal hematoma
wash-out with no detectable source of bleeding and another on POD #14 due to duodenal perforation. In both
cases patients did not show signs of coagulopathy and did
not receive transfusions. One patient developed an urinary
tract infection on POD #5 due to Escherichia coli. Finally,
of the 13 JW recipients, 12 (92.3%) were alive at the 1 year
follow-up interview: 1 patient died 11 months from LT
due to ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL)-related septic
complications.
Discussion
Two key factors led us in deciding to offer LT to JW patients. The first was our large experience in the procedure. In fact, we transplanted our first JW patient in
2007, 11 years and 930 procedures from the start of our
LT program in 1996. The second was the rate of bloodless LT characterizing our activity in the years prior to
that decision [5]. In our experience, a careful selection of
recipients was a key-player as we decided to admit JW
patients to the pre-LT screening only if they did not
show indicators of severe portal hypertension since
bleeding in LT is predominantly linked to portal hypertension rather than primary coagulopathy [8–12]. Thus,
early referral and careful timing for listing is highly
desirable in these patients. Predicting cases requiring
peri-operative transfusions is very desirable, particularly
in JW patients, but it remains a very difficult task in LT
[8, 11, 12]. In fact, despite several investigations have
attempted to identify preoperative predictors of blood
transfusion, their value remain inconsistent and weak
[2, 8–14]. In recent years, models to predict blood
utilization with preoperative variables have been proposed [11, 14, 15]. However, their limitations and differences in the results highlight significant concerns
about their generalizability and recognize that it may
be very difficult to develop a single, reliable, and universally applicable model to predict transfusion requirements for patients undergoing LT. In our series,
the use of techniques that minimize blood loss played
a major role. The adoption of a fluid restriction policy and low CVP is important as it results helpful in
decreasing blood transfusion requirements during LT
[8, 16]. In fact, liberal volume loading in cirrhotic patients tends to pool in the splanchnic circulation with
minimal improvement in cardiac preload or output
but increased risk of surgical bleeding because of congestion of the portal circulation [9, 10, 15]. Moreover,
dilution of clotting factors and clot disturbance can
result, particularly if colloids are used [2, 13]. Further,
lowering the pressure in the central veins can help in
minimizing blood loss also because it may augment
venous drainage from the liver, encouraging flow of blood
away from the surgical field [9–12]. Other intra-operative
blood conservation strategies can be important to achieve
transfusion-free surgery. In our JW patients we performed
ANH but only in selected patients in order not to excessively dilute clotting factors, including PLT. Finally, in the
view of a multimodal strategy aimed at reducing blood
loss [9], we used in all cases the veno-venous bypass to
minimize the impact of mesenteric congestion and abdominal bleeding during portal and caval cross-clamping
[17]. In case of peri-operative coagulopathy, since JW will
not accept fresh frozen plasma or platelets, the use of coagulation factor concentrates and/or tranexamic acid
guided by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) or
thrombelastography (TEG™) [8–11] should be considered.
Therefore, the use of fibrinogen concentrate (which can
support fibrin clotting without transfusion of PLT), clotting factors concentrates and tranexamic acid should be
explained and proposed to these patients in the consideration that acceptance of blood fractions by JW depends
on patient’s free will, apart from church doctrine [4, 13].
Regarding the use of recombinant erythropoietin to
optimize red cell mass, it has a number of potential benefits. The most obvious is that patients will start LT with a
higher blood Hb level that, besides enabling use of ANH
[9, 10], correlates with peri-operative low or no use of red
blood cells transfusion [2, 18]. Since erythropoietin’s use
was associated to a possible risk of thromboembolism
[18], we performed regular clinical and laboratory monitoring of LT candidates on erythropoietin treatment also
in consideration that the waiting time for a suitable deceased donor is unpredictable. The use of ICS in patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma could be discussed because
of the potential risk of infusing malignant cells into patients. To date, 4 studies have evaluated the oncological
safety of using ICS in LT. One concluded that the device
is effective in removing malignant cells from the aspirate,
except in cases of tumor rupture whereas the other 3,
evaluating clinical outcomes such as mortality and recurrence, did not demonstrate negative effects associated with
the use of ICS [19]. On the contrary, the use of cell salvage
during LT for hepatocellular carcinoma has been found to
reduce the exposure to allogeneic blood and to be costeffective [20]. In summary, also according to the most recent guidelines [21], despite theoretical risks and benefits,
there is no conclusive evidence that ICS can induce metastases or affect cancer prognosis. The theoretical risk of
inducing metastatic spread (unproven) is offset by reduced
allogeneic transfusion and immunomodulation, which is
proven [21]. During the last decade, blood product requirements in LT patients have significantly decreased in
most centres. This improvement was related to different
factors including better surgical techniques, LT indication
and liver graft preservation techniques [8–11]. Also,
Costanzo et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:31 Page 5 of 7

experience of the surgical and anesthesiological team is
important. In particular, surgical experience and skill during hepatic dissection and meticulous hemostasis has long
been recognized as meaningful in determining the amount
of intraoperative blood loss [22].
However, experience is difficult to quantify and many
unforeseen intraoperative events with the potential occurrence of technical difficulties impart complex changes
predisposing to extensive bleeding. Furthermore¸ there
is evidence that transfusional requirements can be reduced if the anesthesia team followed protocols including goal-directed transfusion practices [23]. However,
comparison of intraoperative transfusion requirements
from different transplant centers may be inherently
biased by an inability to account for differences in transfusion triggers and clinical practices. Consequently, the
predictive models developed in one institution may
hardly, if ever, be applicable in others.
Few other cases of LT in JW have been reported so far
and, since the first one ever in 1994 [24], our series is, to
the best of our knowledge, the second most numerous
overall and the largest from deceased donors. In fact,
Jabbour and colleagues from University of Southern
California reported in 2005 the results of 27 consecutive
LT in JW patients, 19 from living and only 8 from deceased donors whereas Detry and colleagues reported 6
cases from Liege in Belgium [6, 25]. Other smaller case
series are available from different countries [26–28].
It is undeniable that a rather diffused concern exists
about offering LT to JW patients. In fact, the acceptance
of solid organ transplantation and contemporary refusal
of transfusion are hardly understandable for non-JW.
However, it is important to remember that, as far as
organ transplants are concerned, each Witness is called
on to decide personally whether to accept them or not,
with the proviso that no part of the transplantation
process may include the use of blood or its main fractions [4, 13]. Therefore, each JW patient should be interviewed individually excluding external pressure and the
use of every available peri-operative option aimed at a
blood sparing management, including the use of factors
and fibrinogen concentrates, should be carefully discussed and clarified. Since our patients have been transplanted over a period of 10 years, it could be argued that
peri-operative management policies could have changed
during this period with a possible effect of time on results. However, no substantial changes in clinical care of
recipients were made during the considered period and
there was also consistency in anesthesiology and perioperative treatments.
Conclusion
We herein presented the results of the largest LT program from deceased donors in JW patients that has been
reported so far. Our experience shows that the risk-tobenefits ratio of LT can be maintained in selected adult
JW patients provided that it is carried out at a very experienced centre and according to a multidisciplinary approach. We reported our experience in the aim to offer
a template for a broader concept of transfusion-free surgery principles rather than as a focus on a technical
achievement in such a complicated clinical setting. Anesthesiologists, as users of blood products, are called to
lead a continuous re-evaluation process aimed at defining the most proficient approach to bloodless surgery
and at contributing to the debate about benchmarking
in difficult clinical scenarios.
