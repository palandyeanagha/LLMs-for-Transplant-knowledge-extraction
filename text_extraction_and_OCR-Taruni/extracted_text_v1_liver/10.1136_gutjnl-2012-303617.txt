ABSTRACT
Objective Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a treatable
form of chronic pancreatitis that has been increasingly
recognised over the last decade. We set out to better
understand the current burden of AIP at several
academic institutions diagnosed using the International
Consensus Diagnostic Criteria, and to describe long-term
outcomes, including organs involved, treatments, relapse
frequency and long-term sequelae.
Design 23 institutions from 10 different countries
participated in this multinational analysis. A total of
1064 patients meeting the International Consensus
Diagnostic Criteria for type 1 (n=978) or type 2 (n=86)
AIP were included. Data regarding treatments, relapses
and sequelae were obtained.
Results The majority of patients with type 1 (99%)
and type 2 (92%) AIP who were treated with steroids
went into clinical remission. Most patients with jaundice
required biliary stent placement (71% of type 1 and
77% of type 2 AIP). Relapses were more common in
patients with type 1 (31%) versus type 2 AIP (9%,
p<0.001), especially those with IgG4-related sclerosing
cholangitis (56% vs 26%, p<0.001). Relapses typically
occurred in the pancreas or biliary tree. Retreatment with
steroids remained effective at inducing remission with or
without alternative treatment, such as azathioprine.
Pancreatic duct stones and cancer were uncommon
sequelae in type 1 AIP and did not occur in type 2 AIP
during the study period.
Conclusions AIP is a global disease which uniformly
displays a high response to steroid treatment and
tendency to relapse in the pancreas and biliary tree.
Potential long-term sequelae include pancreatic duct
stones and malignancy, however they were uncommon
during the study period and require additional follow-up.
Additional studies investigating prevention and treatment
of disease relapses are needed.
INTRODUCTION
Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a unique form of
chronic pancreatitis with characteristic histological
features, frequent elevations of serum IgG4 levels
and a predictable response to steroid therapy.
Although the identification of a steroid-responsive
form of chronic pancreatitis was initially reported
in 1995 by Yoshida et al, there was minimal progress in understanding this disease until a serum
biomarker (IgG4 antibody) was identified by
Hamano et al.
1 2 Over the last decade significant
progress has been made in understanding this
disease, including identification of two distinct
histological subtypes, with different clinical phenotypes (termed type 1 and type 2 AIP), incorporation of seemingly unrelated diseases within the
spectrum of IgG4-related disease (of which AIP is
the pancreas manifestation) and treatment of refractory patients with rituximab.3–6
Despite these advances, many questions remain
unanswered. Although patients respond initially to
steroid therapy, many patients will develop disease
relapse either during steroid taper or following
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a treatable
form of chronic pancreatitis that is felt to be
responsive to steroid treatment.
▸ There are few long-term data regarding response
to treatment and subsequent disease sequelae.
What are the new findings?
▸ Disease relapses are common after steroid
discontinuation, and typically occur in the
pancreas and/or biliary tract.
▸ Pancreatic duct stones are relatively
uncommon, but are seen more frequently in
patients with at least one disease relapse.
▸ The occurrence of incident cancers following
AIP diagnosis appears to be uncommon.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the
foreseeable future?
▸ Since disease relapses are common, additional
studies are needed to compare different
treatment strategies for maintaining disease
remission.
▸ Further investigations are needed to understand
if the risk of cancer is increased compared with
the general population.

steroid discontinuation. Reported rates of disease relapse have
ranged from 15–60% in various series.4 7–10 Although there is
general agreement that steroids are the ideal initial treatment,
there is no clear consensus regarding treatment for disease
relapses.
Due to the recent recognition of patients with this condition,
the long-term sequelae of the disease are largely unknown.
Follow-up data are recently becoming available, permitting the
present analysis. In an effort to better understand these knowledge
gaps we set out to perform an international analysis of patients
with type 1 and type 2 AIP. One previous study evaluated the distribution of AIP subtypes worldwide, however multiple diagnostic
criteria were used based on the country of origin.11 Recently a
multinational group met and agreed upon diagnostic criteria,
termed International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria (ICDC).12
This classification scheme categorises diagnostic evidence into one
of two levels of confidence in the following categories: pancreatic
parenchymal imaging, imaging of the pancreatic duct (ie, endoscopic retrograde pancreatogram), serum IgG4 level, other organ
involvement of IgG4-related disease, histology of the pancreas
(from core biopsy or resection) and response to steroid treatment.
We specifically set out to gain additional understanding of the
current burden of AIP at several large, academic institutions using
the ICDC, and to describe the long-term outcomes of this disease
including organs involved, treatments, relapse frequency and longterm sequelae.
METHODS
A total of 31 institutions were invited to participate in this study
on the basis of their scientific merit in this field, or established
experience in management of AIP; ultimately 23 institutions
from 10 different countries participated. The Tokyo
Metropolitan Komagome Hospital in Japan and Mayo Clinic in
the USA served as the coordinating centres. The study was
approved by the institutional review board of Tokyo
Metropolitan Komagome Hospital and was in compliance with
the Declaration of Helsinki.
In centres with existing patient databases, patient follow-up
data were updated and retrieved. If data were not available,
investigators retrospectively reviewed paper and/or electronic
medical records or contacted patients by telephone for data collection. Each centre independently reviewed histological, radiographic, and clinical records of subjects with suspected AIP.
Subjects classified as either definite or probable type 1 or type 2
AIP according to the ICDC were selected for this study (see
online supplementary tables S1–S4).12 The two subtypes
are definitively distinguished based on their histology in which
type 1 AIP (also known as lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis) demonstrates lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, obliterative phlebitis, storiform fibrosis and abundant IgG4-postive
cells, while type 2 AIP (also known as GEL+ pancreatitis or
idiopathic duct-centric chronic pancreatitis) shows granulocytic
infiltration of the duct wall (termed GEL) and absent or
minimal IgG4-postive cells. Additionally, type 2 AIP patients are
unlikely to have serum IgG4 elevation or other organ involvement. Site data through 1 January 2012 were compiled using a
standardised data collection form, then submitted to the lead
investigator (TK) for analysis.
Definitions
For the purposes of this study, proximal biliary was defined as
involvement of either intrahepatic bile ducts or the extrahepatic
common bile duct proximal to the head of the pancreas. When
it occurred in the context of type 1 AIP it was referred to as
IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-related SC)). On the
other hand, distal biliary disease referred to disease isolated to
the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. Serum
IgG4 values vary depending on the assay used, so normal levels
were recognised as those less than the upper limit of normal for
the lab where the test was performed. Pancreatic duct stones
were identified with the use of either cross-sectional imaging or
endoscopic retrograde pancreatography.
Treatment regimens
A wide variety of steroid regimens were employed for induction
and maintenance of remission. For the initial dose of steroids,
all centres used either a weight-based strategy (0.6 mg/kg/day of
prednisolone) or fixed-dose regimen (30–40 mg/day) that were
roughly equivalent for treatment of a 70 kg individual. Tapering
strategies ranged from 5–10 mg decrease every 1–2 weeks. All
Asian centres (n=10) used a maintenance strategy of low-dose
(2.5–5 mg/day) prednisolone, which was continued for anywhere from 6 months to 3 years. In general, the European and
North American groups tapered the steroids off within
3 months and did not provide maintenance doses of steroids.
Multiple centres elected to use immunomodulator drugs instead
of low-dose steroids for maintenance therapy (n=5). In the four
centres treating more than five subjects with this strategy,
azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day) was the preferred agent and was
used for a variable duration of time (1–3 years).
Many patients initially underwent surgery either due to the
absence of typical features of AIP or clinical presentation prior
to the recognition of AIP as a disease entity. Surgeries were performed for resection of mass-forming lesions (ie, pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal splenectomy) or palliative bypass (ie,
gastrojejunostomy) for those with an apparently unresectable
cancer. Surgery was not intentionally performed as primary
treatment for AIP. A number of patients were treated conservatively, without the use of steroids or surgery. Supportive care
was provided for a variety of reasons including asymptomatic
disease, severe comorbid disease (eg, metastatic cancer) or
patient preference.
Statistical analyses
Continuous variables were compared using Student t test, χ2 test
and Fisher’s exact t test (when one or more expected cell frequencies were <5) were used for comparison of proportions.
A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
AIP subject characteristics
A total of 1064 subjects were identified, 978 with type 1 AIP
and 86 with type 2 AIP. The average age of subjects at diagnosis
was 61.4 and 39.9 years for type 1 and type 2 subjects, respectively. The proportion of males was 77% in type 1 subjects and
55% in type 2 subjects (p<0.001). The proportion of patients
diagnosed with type 2 AIP was lower in Asian countries (3.7%)
compared with European (12.9%, p<0.001) and North
American (13.7%, p<0.001) countries (figure 1).
Treatment response
The majority (74%) of subjects with type 1 AIP were initially
treated with steroids, rather than surgical or conservative treatments, in comparison with type 2 subjects in which only 62%
were treated with steroids (p=0.01). Remission was successfully
induced in almost all subjects with type 1 and type 2 AIP
(table 1). The per cent of subjects achieving remission was
higher in type 1 subjects who received intervention (either

steroids or surgery) (99.2%) compared with those who were
managed conservatively (55.2%, p<0.001). However, initial
remission rates were similar in patients with type 2 AIP who
received intervention compared with conservative management
(83.5% vs 66.7%, respectively, p=0.29). Interestingly many of
the patients who underwent palliative surgical bypass achieved
successful clinical remission; however the total number of cases
was small. Initial treatment strategies and indications for treatment and concurrent therapies used in those receiving steroid
treatment are also shown in table 1. Treatment for diabetes mellitus was given to a minority of patients prior to steroid treatment. However, biliary stenting was performed for most
subjects presenting with jaundice. In subjects with type 1 AIP,
jaundice (63%) was the most common indication, followed by
abdominal pain with or without biochemical pancreatitis. In
those with type 2 AIP, abdominal pain and inflammatory bowel
disease were major indications.
In subjects with type 1 AIP and abnormal serum IgG4 levels
(n=446) prior to steroids, the serum level decreased in 427
(95.7%) subjects and returned to within normal limits for 204
(45.7%). Of 609 type 1 AIP subjects with pancreatic enlargement at the time of diagnosis, the parenchyma appeared normal
in 400 (65.7%), atrophic in 173 (28.4%) and persistently
enlarged in 35 (5.9%) subjects following steroid treatment.
In contrast, 50 type 2 AIP subjects had pancreatic enlargement
at diagnosis. Following treatment the appearance returned to
normal in the majority (43/50, 86%) with progression to
atrophy in the remaining seven subjects.
Relapse data
Of the 978 subjects with type 1 disease, a total of 302 (31%)
subjects experienced at least one disease relapse during the
study period, compared with 8 (9%, p<0.001) subjects with
type 2 AIP (table 2). The vast majority of relapse episodes
occurred in steroid treated subjects following steroid discontinuation (67%), as compared with during the steroid taper (15%)
or while on maintenance steroids (18%). Most relapses occurred
in the biliary system or pancreas for type 1 AIP, while relapses in
type 2 AIP were limited to the pancreas.

Predictors of relapse
The proportion of subjects having a relapse was similar in those
with persistently abnormal IgG4 levels following steroids compared with those with a normal level (32.7% vs 31.4%, respectively, p=0.77). Likewise, the proportion of subjects with at least
one relapse was similar regardless of whether they initially had
diffuse (42/440, 32.3%) or focal pancreatic parenchymal
enlargement (92/285, 32.3%, p=0.99). In contrast, 96/171
(56.1%) subjects with IgG4-related SC had at least one relapse,
while only 142/551 (25.7%) subjects without IgG4-related SC
had a relapse (p<0.001). The rates of relapse were similar in
those with and without distal biliary disease (33.9% vs 31.1%,
respectively, p=0.44). Since there were very few relapse episodes in subjects with type 2 AIP, a meaningful comparison of
risk factors for relapse could not be completed.
Treatment for disease relapse
Steroids were the most commonly used treatment for managing
disease relapse in type 1 AIP, and inducing remission was successful in 201/210 (95%) of subjects. The addition of azathioprine was used for 68 subjects with successful induction in
56 (85%). Medications used in other subjects (n=18) included
mycophenolate mofetil (n=8), cyclosporine (n=3), methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab.
Successful remission was achieved in 12 (86%) of these subjects
with follow-up.
Long-term sequelae in type 1 AIP
Pancreatic duct stones were uncommonly seen occurring in
46/659 (7%) subjects with follow-up imaging permitting evaluation for stone disease. Pancreatic duct stones were more likely
to occur in subjects with at least one relapse, compared with
those who had never had a relapse (14.4% vs 4.0%, respectively,
p<0.001).
The most frequently occurring cancers during follow-up were
gastric, lung and prostate (table 3). Importantly, pancreatic
cancer was diagnosed in five male patients at a median age of
77 years (range 65–80) at the time of cancer diagnosis. All
cancers were diagnosed more than 3 years following AIP diagnosis with the exception of one patient. His cancer was diagnosed 9 months following AIP diagnosis, which was made on
the basis of diffuse pancreatic enlargement and elevation of
serum IgG4 more than twice the upper limit of normal (definitive histology for type 1 AIP was confirmed on the resected
pancreatic specimen). In the two patients with serum IgG4
levels obtained at the time of cancer diagnosis, it was mildly
(1–2×upper limits) elevated. Eight (73%) of the subjects with
gastric cancers were from study sites located in Japan or Korea,
and risk factors for gastric cancer were not reported. No subjects with type 2 AIP developed an incident cancer or pancreatic
duct stone during the study period.
DISCUSSION
This study represents the largest, multinational analysis of
patients with type 1 and type 2 AIP diagnosed according to
ICDC and provides insights into treatment strategies and potential long-term sequelae. Previously noted differences in clinical
profiles of type 1 and type 2 AIP, including age and gender differences, were confirmed in this study.4 11 Type 2 AIP represented a smaller proportion of AIP in Asian countries compared
with European and North American countries.
Types 1 and 2 were highly-responsive to steroid treatment;
however disease relapses were common in type 1, especially in
those with proximal biliary disease (ie, IgG4-related SC). Most
patients who required steroid therapy had predominantly pancreatobiliary disease manifestations ( jaundice, abdominal pain
or abnormal pancreas imaging). Although most subjects with
jaundice required biliary intervention prior to steroid therapy,
the need for diabetes treatment was unexpectedly low. The
remission rate of treating patients following disease relapse
remained high. Pancreatic duct stones were relatively uncommon, but occurred more frequently in patients with at least one
disease relapse. A number of cancers occurred and further
studies are needed to understand whether this represents a true

increased risk for malignancy in subjects with AIP or is due to
older age of type 1 patients and ascertainment bias as patients
with AIP have extensive diagnostic studies and close follow-up.
Our present compilation of more than 1000 patients is the
largest to date, and the number of institutions required to reach
this enrolment illustrates the rarity of this disease. Since the
landmark discovery that elevated serum IgG4 levels are associated with AIP the number of newly diagnosed cases of AIP has
increased dramatically.2 The disease spectrum of IgG4-related
disease, which encompasses AIP and IgG4-related SC, continues
to expand also contributing additional diagnoses. It is more
likely that the increasing recognition of the diseases is due to its
increased awareness rather than true increase in incidence of the
disease.
Since its initial description by Yoshida et al, type 1 AIP has
been recognised as a steroid-responsive disease.1 The current
study shows that both types of disease are characterised by very
high remission rates with steroid therapy, suggesting that the
diagnosis must be reconsidered in those who do not respond to
steroids. Although a noteworthy proportion (55%) of patients
initially managed conservatively had spontaneous disease remission, this rate was inferior to that in patients who were treated
with steroids or surgery (99% remission rate). Since inflammatory pancreatic and biliary disease can progress to irreversible
pancreatic insufficiency and secondary biliary cirrhosis, we feel
early treatment is advisable, even in the absence of rigorous
evidence-based medicine demonstrating that steroid treatment
alters the natural history of AIP. In the absence of a validated
induction regimen variation in steroid dosing is inevitable, but
despite this remission rates were universally high across all
centres. Most patients required treatment for jaundice, abdominal pain or abnormal pancreatic imaging. Interestingly, although
most patients with jaundice required endoscopic biliary stenting
prior to steroids, less than half of patients required treatment
for diabetes. Smaller series have shown an interesting, paradoxical improvement in glycaemic control after steroid therapy, presumably due to recovered pancreatic endocrine function with
treatment.13 14 This finding, experienced anecdotally by many
of the authors, led to the withholding of diabetes treatment for
some patients with hyperglycaemia. Nonetheless, it is important
to monitor blood sugars during steroid treatment to recognise
and prevent hyperglycaemia-related morbidity.
Disease relapses in type 1 and type 2 AIP predominantly
involve the pancreas and/or biliary system. Cumulative relapse
rates could not be accurately calculated since time to event
(ie, relapse) data were not available for most patients. However,
the relapse rate in this study of 31% falls within the range
(15–60%) of that in previous reports. Unfortunately due to the
nature of this study, it is not statistically valid to compare
relapse rates on the basis of treatment strategies used (eg, with
or without maintenance steroids). Due to challenges with study
enrolment, a prospective treatment trial to clarify this choice is
not expected soon; so the decision must be made on the basis
of the provider’s familiarity with the treatment strategy, considering the side effect profile, and patients’ personal relapse histories and preferences.
For most patients in this study relapses occurred after steroid
discontinuation. Patients treated again with steroids continued
to respond favourably with a high remission rate. Some patients
with relapses were treated with an immunomodulator (most
commonly azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil). These
steroid-sparing approaches are attractive to some due to the possibility of avoiding complications from long-term steroid exposure.6 8 14–16 However, to date no large series have demonstrated
either treatment effectiveness or decreased incidence of
treatment-related side effects.
Two sequelae identified in other forms of chronic pancreatitis
are pancreatic duct stones and pancreatic cancer. So we specifically examined the rates of these complications in this study
cohort.17 18 The occurrence of pancreatic duct stones in this
study is low with higher prevalence in those with at least one
relapse. Additionally, we report the first systematic collection of
malignancies in patients with AIP. Importantly, there were only
five cases of pancreatic cancer in this study; however, considering the overall large denominator of AIP patients at risk, limited
follow-up and lack of a control population, it is difficult to
understand the true clinical significance of this finding.
Additional studies with longer follow-up will help refine our
understanding of these long-term sequelae.
We estimate that this multinational collaboration of many of
the academic foci for AIP permitted analysis of a significant proportion of the world’s current AIP population. Our utilisation
of the recently developed ICDC permitted study of patients
with a unified set of diagnostic criteria. Our data must be interpreted with caution recognising this collaboration could inadvertently introduce heterogeneity in disease on the basis of
unknown ethnic differences in the natural history of disease, as
well as variations in the standards of care regarding disease
evaluation and follow-up.
Although the basic clinical profiles and initial treatment strategies for AIP are generally understood, many questions remain.
The importance of steroid treatment at disease onset is commonly accepted, however whether or not one could use a lower
steroid dose has not been systematically evaluated and may
potentially decrease treatment-related morbidity. The prediction
of disease relapse remains inadequate. Except for IgG4-related
SC, no clinical factor has been consistently demonstrated to
predict subsequent relapse. Finally, it remains unclear whether
or not maintenance therapy (using either low-dose steroids or
an immunomodulator) actually prolongs relapse-free survival,
thereby altering the course of disease.
In summary, in this multinational analysis of more than 1000
patients with AIP we have shown that most patients are treated
with steroids for predominantly pancreatobiliary manifestations
of their disease. Initial and subsequent treatment responses to
steroid therapy are exceedingly high, so the diagnosis should be
reconsidered if patients do not respond to steroids. Relapses
occur in a substantial proportion of patients and typically
involve the pancreas and/or biliary system. Pancreatic duct
stones and malignancies are two potential long-term sequelae,
which require ongoing surveillance to further understand their
full clinical significance. We are hopeful that multinational collaborations, such as the present one, will provide opportunities to
better understand this disease, and permit a long-awaited randomised treatment trial.
