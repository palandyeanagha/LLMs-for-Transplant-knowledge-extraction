Abstract
The unprecedented pandemic of COVID-19 has impacted many lives and afects the whole healthcare systems globally. In 
addition to the considerable workload challenges, surgeons are faced with a number of uncertainties regarding their own 
safety, practice, and overall patient care. This guide has been drafted at short notice to advise on specifc issues related to 
surgical service provision and the safety of minimally invasive surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although laparoscopy can theoretically lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, there is no evidence available to confrm this is the case 
with COVID-19. The ultimate decision on the approach should be made after considering the proven benefts of laparoscopic 
techniques versus the potential theoretical risks of aerosolization. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety would warrant 
treating the coronavirus as exhibiting similar aerosolization properties and all members of the OR staf should use personal 
protective equipment (PPE) in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status. 
Pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated via a fltration system before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, 
or conversion to open. All emergent endoscopic procedures performed during the pandemic should be considered as high 
risk and PPE must be used by all endoscopy staf.

COVID-19 has demonstrated a propensity to spread at an 
exponential rate in several countries, signifcantly impacting 
many lives and signifcantly afecting the healthcare practice and healthcare professionals. The Society of American 
Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) and The 
European Association for Endoscopic Surgeons (EAES) are 
committed to the protection and care of patients, supporting

their members surgeons and staf, and all who are served by 
the medical community at large.
These joint recommendations draw on a number of 
sources including the limited available literature on the 
topic but more immediately from practicing surgeons across 
Europe, Asia, North America, and beyond. This guide is 
subject to update and we will continue to monitor emerging 
evidence and support novel research to address clinical and 
scientifc gaps in this topic.
Through this prism, the following recommendations 
are being made with the aim that they can be of support 
to the surgical community in general and Minimally invasive Surgery (MIS) in particular, by addressing a number of 
uncertainties regarding the surgical practice, staf safety, and 
overall patient care. The recommendations are summarized 
in Table 1 and depicted in an infographic diagram (Fig. 1).
Rationalization of service
All elective surgical and endoscopic cases should be 
postponed at the current time. These decisions however 
should be made locally, based on COVID-19 burden and 
in the context of medical, logistical, and organizational 
considerations. There are different levels of urgency 
related to patient needs, and judgment is required to discern between them. However, as the numbers of COVID19 patients requiring care is expected to escalate over the 
next few weeks, the surgical care of patients should be 
limited to those whose needs are imminently life threatening. These may include patients with malignancy that 
could progress or with active symptoms that require 
urgent care. All others should be delayed until after the 
peak of the pandemic is seen. This minimizes the risk to 
both patient and health care team, as well as minimizes 
utilization of necessary resources, such as beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE).
All non-essential hospital or ofce staf should be allowed 
to stay home and telework. All in-person educational sessions should be cancelled and could be replaced by online 
resources. The minimum number of necessary providers 
should attend patients during rounds and other encounters. Adherence to hand washing, antiseptic foaming, and 
appropriate use of PPE should be strictly enforced. When 
necessary, in-person surgical consultation should be performed by decision makers only.
All non-urgent in-person clinic/ofce visits should be 
cancelled or postponed, unless needed to triage active 
symptoms or manage wound care. All patient visits 
should be handled remotely when possible, and in person only when absolutely necessary. Access to clinics 
should be maintained for those special circumstances to 
avoid patients seeking care in the Emergency Department 
(ED). Only a minimum of required support personnel 
should be present for these visits, and PPE should again 
be appropriately utilized. When in critical need, consideration should be given to redeploying OR resources for 
intensive care needs.
Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings should be held 
virtually as possible and/or limited to core team members 
only, including surgeon, pathologist, Clinical Nurse Specialist, radiologist, oncologist, and coordinator. The MDT 
is responsible for the decision making and classifying the 
patient’s priority level of need for surgery.
Procedural considerations
1. There is very little evidence regarding the relative risks 
of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) versus the conventional open approach, specifc to COVID-19. We will 
therefore continue to monitor emerging evidence and 
support novel research to address these issues.
Table 1 Summary of the main recommendations on COVID-19 and surgery
1. Suspension of non-essential surgical care during the immediate phases of the COVID-19 pandemic
2. Testing all patients before surgery is desirable
3. Consent discussion with patients to cover the risk of COVID-19 exposure and the potential consequences
4. Dedicated COVID-19 OR must be used during the pandemic with a minimum number of staf members during the procedure
5. All members of the OR/endoscopy staf should use PPE in all procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID 
status
6. A closed smoke evacuation/fltration system with Ultra Low Particulate Air Filtration (ULPA) capability should be used during MIS
7. Minimize the use of energy sources (risk of aerosolization) during surgery and endoscopy
8. All pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated from the port attached to the fltration device before closure, trocar removal, specimen 
extraction, or conversion to open
9. Since patients can present with gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19, all emergent endoscopic procedures performed in the current 
environment should be considered as high risk
10. Advanced endoscopic procedures that require additional insufation and or energy sources should be avoided

2. It is strongly recommended, however, that consideration 
be given to the possibility of viral contamination to staf 
during open, laparoscopic, or robotic surgery and that 
protective measures are strictly employed for OR staf 
safety and to maintain a functioning workforce.
3. Although previous research has shown that laparoscopy 
can lead to aerosolization of blood borne viruses, [1–3] 
there is no evidence to indicate that this efect is seen 
with COVID-19, nor that it would be isolated to MIS 
procedures. Nevertheless, erring on the side of safety 
would warrant treating the coronavirus as exhibiting 
similar aerosolization properties. For MIS procedures, 
use of devices to flter released CO2 for aerosolized particles should be strongly considered.
4. Proven benefts of MIS of reduced length of stay and 
complications [4–7] should be strongly considered in 
these patients, in addition to the potential for ultrafltration of the majority of aerosolized particles. Filtration of 
aerosolized particles may be more difcult during open 
surgery [8, 9].
5. There may also be enhanced risk of viral exposure to 
proceduralists/endoscopists from endoscopy and airway 
procedures. When these procedures are necessary, strict 
use of PPE should be considered for the whole team, following Centers for Disease Control (CDC, https://www.
cdc.gov) or WHO (https://www.who.int) guidelines for 
droplet or airborne precautions. The PPE should include, 
at a minimum, N95 masks and face shields [10, 11].
Practical measures for surgery
1. Consent discussion with patients must cover the risk of 
COVID-19 exposure and the potential consequences.
2. If readily available and practical, surgical patients should 
be tested pre-operatively for COVID-19 and delay of 
surgery or additional protective measures enacted as 
appropriate for COVID-positive patients.
3. If needed and possible, intubation and extubation should 
take place within a negative pressure room (https://www.
asahq.org/in-the-spotlight/coronavirus-covid-19-infor
mation, https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org; [12, 13]).
4. Operating rooms for presumed, suspected, or confrmed 
COVID-19-positive patients should be appropriately fltered and ventilated and, if possible, should be diferent 
than rooms used for other emergent surgical patients.
5. Only those considered essential staf should be participating in the surgical case and unless there is an emerFig. 1 Infographic illustration of SAGES/EAES recommendations for COVID-19 and surgery

gency, there should be minimal exchange of room staf 
[14].
6. All members of the OR staf should use PPE as recommended by national or international organizations, 
including the WHO or CDC. These recommendations 
may be modifed by local hospital policy, as necessary. 
Appropriate gowns and face shields should be utilized. 
These measures should be used in all surgical procedures during the pandemic regardless of known or suspected COVID status. Placement and removal of PPE 
in should be done according to CDC guidelines (link to 
CDC https://www.cdc.gov [15])
7. Electrosurgery units should be set to the lowest possible 
settings for the desired efect. Use of monopolar electrosurgery, ultrasonic dissectors, and advanced bipolar 
devices should be minimized, as these can lead to particle aerosolization [16–22], and if available, monopolar diathermy pencils with attached smoke evacuators 
should be used.
8. Surgical equipment used during procedures with 
COVID-19-positive or person under investigation (PUI)/
suspected COVID patients should be cleaned separately 
from other surgical equipment.
Practical measures for laparoscopy
1. Incisions for ports should be as small as possible to 
allow for the passage of ports but not allow for leakage 
around ports.
2. CO2 insufation pressure should be kept to a minimum 
and an ultrafltration (smoke evacuation system or fltration) should be used, if available.
3. At the end of surgery or before converting to open 
surgery or removal of trocars, the pneumoperitoneum 
should be carefully released [23] and should be safely 
evacuated via a filtration system in case of aerosol 
formed during the operation [9, 24, 25].
Practical measures for endoscopy
1. The ability to control aerosolized virus during endoscopic procedures is lacking, so all members in the 
endoscopy suite or operating room should wear appropriate PPE, including gowns and face shields. Placement 
and removal of PPE should be done according to CDC 
guidelines [15, 26, 27].
2. Since patients can present with gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19, all emergent endoscopic procedures performed in the current environment should be 
considered as high risk [10, 26–28].
3. Since the virus has been found in multiple cells in the 
gastrointestinal tract and all fluids including saliva, 
enteric contents, stool, and blood, surgical energy should 
be minimized [29, 30].
4. Endoscopic procedures that require additional insufation of CO2 or room air by additional sources should 
be avoided if possible until we have better knowledge 
about the aerosolization properties of the virus. This 
would include many of the endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoluminal procedures.
5. Removal of caps on endoscopes could release fuid and/
or air and should be avoided.
6. Endoscopic equipment used during procedures with 
COVID-19-positive or PUI patients should be cleaned 
separately from other endoscopic equipment.
Conclusions
The surgical management of patients with suspected or 
known or COVID‐19 requires specifc considerations for 
theater staf and patient safety. Although specifc evidence 
to COVID-19 and the risk for aerosol transmission during 
laparoscopy is lacking, every efort must be made to minimize this potential risk during surgery to protect staf and 
maintain a functioning workforce that can continue to care 
for our patients.
