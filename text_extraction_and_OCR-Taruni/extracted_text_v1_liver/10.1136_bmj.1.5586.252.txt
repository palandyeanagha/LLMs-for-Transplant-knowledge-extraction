vesicles on the body. In the next few days
there was further improvement. From thirteen
days on, palms and soles desquamated in large
flakes. On the sixteenth day the mouth had
healed, with residual brown spots on lips. Skin
of soles peeled off like sandals, in one piece.
The patient was admitted to a general ward
and treatment was symptomatic. On discharge the patient was warned that for some
time he might spread foot-and-mouth
disease among animals, and that therefore he
should avoid contact with susceptible animals.
Veterinary authorities were notified about this
patient and carried out inspections in the
district in which the slaughterhouse was
situated. Foot-and-mouth disease was found
among animals, although previously this
district was declared free from disease.
In conclusion I would like to emphasize
that the health authorities would be well
advised to pay close attention to the possibility
of the disease in man as a potential factor
in the spread of foot-and-mouth disease.-I

Budd-Chiari Syndrome after Oral
Contraceptives
SIR,-I have read with interest the two
.recent case reports (16 December, p. 660, and
,6 January, p. 53) of hepatic-vein thrombosis
(Budd-Chiari syndrome) in young women
taking the contraceptive pill. A similar case
was admitted to St. Bartholomew's Hospital
in November 1965.
A 24-year-old housewife was transferred to
the care of Mr. A. H. Hunt. Four weeks pre-
.viously she had been admitted to another hospital for investigation of peripheral oedema,
ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly. She had noted
increasing abdominal distension for five months,
and for four months before the onset of these
symptoms she had been on Anovlar (norethisterone acetate and ethinyloestradiol). After
paracentesis of nearly 5 1. an exploratory
laparotomy was done. An enlarged, firm, and
congested liver was noted and the spleen was
considerably enlarged. Liver biopsy showed appearances suggestive of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
On examination she was ill, with gross peripheral oedema and reaccumulation of ascites, but
with no stigmata of liver disease, and liver-
.function tests were only slightly impaired.
Shortly after admission the abdominal incision
disrupted. While this was being resutured she
had a cardiac arrest. The heart was restarted
after one and a half hours of cardiac massage,
and on recovery of consciousness several days
later her mental state was impaired. During
this time she developed an ischaemic right foot,
which subsequently required a below-knee amputation. The tibial vessels were thrombosed.
With the collaboration of Dr. A. M. Dawson,
an unsuccessful attempt was made to control the
,oedema and ascites with large doses of steroids
and diuretics. Her condition gradually deteriorated and she died 10 weeks after admission.
Necropsy confirmed the diagnosis of BuddChiari syndrome. The hepatic veins were
almost completely obliterated, with only a
pinhole opening left. Histological sections
showed widespread occlusion of these veins
and their small divisions by organized
thrombus. The liver showed patchy congestion and haemorrhage, with areas of livercell atrophy and early interstitial fibrosis.
-Thrombosis causing partial occlusion of the
vessel lumen was also noted in the hepatic
segment of the inferior vena cava, the left
common iliac vein, and the superior mesenteric, splenic, and main portal veins. The
bifurcation of the right common femoral
artery was occluded by a recent saddle embolus, and infarcts were noted in both lungs,
both kidneys, and the left ventricle. The
extent of the thrombotic process in this
patient strongly suggested a generalized condition affecting the intima of the blood
vessels.
It is interesting to note that three oral
contraceptives have now been reported as
being associated with hepatic-vein thrombosis.
The first reported case had been on mestranol
for only 14 days before the onset of symptoms'; the second case had been on lynoestrenol for 12 to 18 months (16 December,
p. 660); and the third case (6 January,
p. 54) had been on Anovlar for a year or
more and was fortunate to have recovered.
The present case had been on this latter drug
for four months. The usual prognosis with
Budd-Chiari syndrome is a progressive
deterioration with a fatal termination, as
occurred with this and two of the other
reported cases.
I am grateful to Mr. A. H. Hunt for permission to publish details of this case.

SIR,-Following recent reports in your
columns (16 December, p. 660, and 6 January, p. 53) of two cases of the Budd-Chiari
syndrome in women who had been taking
oral contraceptives, we are able to add a
further case, resembling in many respects that
of Drs. K. Sterup and J. Mosbech.
A 40-year-old woman sought medical advice
on account of increasing abdominal distension,
stress incontinence, flatulence, and anorexia. She
was the mother of four children, aged from 12
to 21 years, and had been taking an oral contraceptive, megestrol acetate and ethinyl oestradiol,
for two years. Examination revealed a mass in
the pelvis and hepatic enlargement. Laparotomy
was performed nine days later and showed a
fibroid uterus, the size of a 16-week pregnancy,
ascites, and a large liver which appeared to be
cirrhotic. Abdominal hysterectomy was performed, which was followed by paralytic ileus
and rapidly increasing ascites. Fluid leaked
through the abdominal wound and on the
eleventh postoperative day led to a rupture of
the abdominal scar. Her condition deteriorated
steadily from then onwards. She became comatose and died 14 days after operation.
Necropsy Findings.-The liver weighed
1,440 g. and presented a striking appearance:
its surface was slightly lobulated and the colour
was dark red with coarse golden-yellow mottling
throughout the parenchyma. Histological examination revealed widespread centrilobular necrosis
with gross distension of the central veins, most
of which were occluded by thrombus. The portal
tracts contained a lymphocytic infiltrate and
increased amounts of fibrous tissue. In addition,
both femoral veins were distended with recent
thrombi which extended through the iliac veins
into the inferior vena cava. Small old infarcts
were also found in the left cerebral hemisphere,
but no recent thrombi were found in the cerebral
vessels.
The cause of death was recorded as
"hepatic necrosis following hepatic-vein
thrombosis." In view of the reported association between the taking of oral contraceptives
and a tendency to thrombosis in comparatively young women, this case was reported to
H.M. Coroner and to the Safety of Drugs
Committee.-We are, etc.,

Length of Menstrual Cycle
SIR,-It is well known that the administration of oestrogens with synthetic progestogens
in combination or used sequentially over 20,
21, or 22 days of the month not infrequently
leads to some change in the menstrual cycle.
Usually the cycle becomes more regular and
pain previously associated with the menses
often disappears. Some women, however,
experience shortened cycles and in others the
cycle length may be prolonged. With the
introduction of low-dosage preparations and
sequential regimen the incidence of breakthrough bleeding and amenorrhoea has fallen.
It is also quite clear that with combination
preparations those containing a 19-norprogestogen (norethisterone, ethynodiol diacetate,
lynoestrenol, etc.) give rise to a much lower
incidence of shortened cycles than those containing a progestogen of the 17-acetoxy series
(megestrol acetate, chlormadinone, etc.).
Since the introduction of these preparations
for use in conception control women of
reproductive age have necessarily come under
much closer observation than hitherto,
although it has long been known that the
effects of organic disease, shock, change of
domicile, different occupation, or illicit relationships, etc., may lead to shortening of the
cycle or, more commonly, lengthening of the
cycle and amenorrhoea. The precise mechanisms for these changes in the non-medicated
woman is not known, but presumably alterations along the corticohypothalamic pathways
may affect secretion of gonadotrophin releasing factors with its sequelae. The late Dr.
Gregory Pincus frequently cited the data
collected by Haman' and observed that some
10% of menstrual cycles in apparently normal women are less than 24 days in length.
Pincus' pointed out that following the
administration of ovulation-inhibiting steroids
the incidence of shortened cycles often falls
below 10%, the medication producing a better
than normal control of cycle length. I have
previously drawn attention to the variation in
cycle length from that usually accepted as
normal.' This information obtained from 11
studies is tabulated below.
