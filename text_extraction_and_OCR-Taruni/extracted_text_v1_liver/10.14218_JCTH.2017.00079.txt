Abstract
Background and Aims: Recurrent hepatitis C (HCV) disease
in liver transplant (LT) recipients is associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. With the availability of noninterferonbased therapy, eliminating HCV may be achievable in LT recipients. Methods: We studied all consecutive recipients who
underwent LT at the University of California Los Angeles between January 2005 and June 2017. We collected data on date
of transplant and last follow-up, as well as laboratory values. We
also recorded type and timing of antiviral therapy relative to LT.
Analyses were performed to assess the proportion of LT recipients who are viremic after transplant. Results: Six hundred
thirty-four patients underwent LT with a diagnosis of HCV. There
was a statistically significant trend for patients to be cured before (p < 0.001) and after liver transplantation (p < 0.001) for
the study period of 2014 to 2016 relative to 2005 and 2013,
respectively. Of the 634 recipients eligible for therapy, 8% and
74% were treated within 12 months of transplant for the study
periods 2005 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016, respectively. There
was a significant decrease between the two study periods in
the proportion of patients undergoing re-LT 1 year after the
original LT: 5.5% (n = 28/510) and 1.5% (n = 2/124) respectively for study periods 2005 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016 respectively (p = 0.011). Conclusions: The proportion of LT recipients
who are viremic has decreased over time. Eliminating HCV in LT
recipients is feasible after the introduction of direct-acting
agents. Curing HCV should translate to improved clinical outcomes in LT recipients who were transplanted for HCV infection
with longer follow-up. Preliminary results suggest the decreased need for transplant in the direct-acting agents era.

Introduction
Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) remains one of the most common
indications for liver transplantation (LT) in the USA.1,2 Recurrent infection is universal, and can lead to both patient and graft
loss.3,4 Treatment of HCV has substantially evolved over the
years.5–7 The sustained viral response (SVR) or ‘cure’ rates
with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin were approximately
23%.6,7 The first generation of direct-acting agents (DAAs),
with the backbone of interferon, was associated with increased
cure rates but with substantial adverse effects, permitting only
select LT recipients, generally those with progressive liver
disease, to be eligible for treatment.5 Thus, when all-oral
DAAs became available, LT recipients were recommended to
have priority treatment allocation.6 The use of all-oral DAAs
has been found to be safe, effective and tolerable after LT.7,8
With increasing access and identification of patients infected
with HCV, it is believed that viral infection can become a rare
disease in the general population within the next couple of
decades.9 There are already several examples of elimination
strategies of HCV from various cohorts.10–13 Liver transplant
recipients infected with HCV would be an ideal cohort to
attempt elimination or eradication because recurrent infection
clearly impacts patient and graft survival, as well as health care
utilization.3,4,14 Although patients can be treated with DAAs both
prior to and after LT, the optimal timing of antiviral therapy is
unclear.15,16 Progressive liver disease in liver transplant candidates may lower the likelihood of SVR and increase the adverse
effects of DAAs.16–18 Nevertheless, the impact of treating LT
candidates with DAAs has begun to be realized across the
USA, as evidenced by changes in the number of HCV patients
registered on the LT waitlist.19–21
Because of the medical impact of recurrent HCV infection
and the safety and efficacy of DAAs in LT recipients, we sought
to describe the impact of DAAs on the elimination of HCV in LT
recipients. Our hypothesis was that HCV can be eliminated in
LT recipients with the use of DAAs.
Methods
We performed a retrospective chart review of all adult (age >18
years) recipients who underwent a liver transplant for HCV at
the University of California Los Angeles Medical Center (UCLA)
between January 2005 and June 2017. Inclusion criteria
included adult recipients (age 18 years or older) with HCV
infection confirmed by a detectable HCV RNA at any time or a
clinical history of having HCV infection without documentation

of antiviral therapy. We assumed no spontaneous clearance.
Exclusion criteria was met for recipients who expired within 30
days of the LT. The study was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Because of the nature of the current study,
obtained informed consent was not required.
Data were obtained by medical chart review and the UCLA
Liver Transplant database. Demographic data (age, sex), date
of liver transplant and HCV therapeutic regimen were collected.
Recipients received the standard immunosuppressant regimen
including prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate acid after
transplant, and were eventually weaned off to only tacrolimus if
there was no renal insufficiency or if recipients had complete
renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Mycophenolate was utilized
with tacrolimus in recipients with renal insufficiency but who
were not on hemodialysis. SVR was defined as the absence of
HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after completing therapy. Date of
last follow-up, death or graft failure was also recorded. Dates
when different antiviral regimens were used are shown in
Table 1.5,22–25 All-oral DAA regimens were used starting in
2014. The regimens utilized were: sofosbuvir+ribavirin;
sofosbuvir+simeprevir; sofosbuvir+ledipasvir; sofosbuvir
+daclatasvir; sofosbuvir+elbasvir+grazoprevir+ribavirin.
Differences in SVR were summarized using two different
models for the time periods of 2005 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016,
namely the spline model and Cox proportional hazards model.
Median with interquartile range (IQR) was used to describe
data distribution. Each model had an indicator for whether
patients were transplanted prior to or after January 1, 2014.
This time was chosen because this is when DAAs without
interferon were made available at our institution. The spline
model was a simple linear spline with an interaction between
time from start of study and the indicator for availability of
DAAs without interferon. The Cox proportional hazards model
censored patients at their last clinical follow-up or at the date of
SVR. Time to sustained viral suppression was measured from
last transplant if the patient had multiple LTs. A p-value below
0.05 was considered statistically significant and the statistical
analysis was performed in the R Statistical Computing Environment (R Core Team; Vienna, Austria).
Results
We identified 634 consecutive liver transplant recipients who
were transplanted for HCV at our institution during the study
period. The demographics are shown in Table 2. Most recipients
were men (70%), and the median age (IQR) was 58 (53 – 63)
years at the time of liver transplant. The median (IQR) followup was 2.69 (0.89 – 5.83) years. Thirty recipients required reLT during the first year of LT. There was a significant difference
in re-LT rate between the two periods at 1 year. The re-LT rate at
1-year for patients originally transplanted pre-2014 was 5.5%
(n = 28/510), compared to 1.5% (n = 2/124; p = 0.011) for
recipients transplanted after 2014.
The use of DAAs without interferon began in our institution
in 2013. Less than 10% (57/634) of the recipients were cured
of HCV prior to the LT. There was a statistically significant
higher rate of pretransplant HCV treatment in recipients
undergoing LT after 2013 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The median
time from transplant to treatment was 6.21 (confidence interval [CI]: 5.42 to 6.86) years for the time period 2005 to 2013,
compared to 0.466 years (CI: 0.40 to 0.69) for LT recipients in
the later era of 2014–2016 (hazard ratio: 14.2, 95%CI: 9.87
to 20.45) (Fig. 2). Prior to the year 2014, 5% (25/506) of
LT recipients had been treated before LT. After 2014, 25%
(32/128) of LT recipients had been treated prior to surgery.
Over the study period, 42% (236/558) of LT recipients who
were viremic and did not expire within 30 days of transplant
were cured after transplant. There was a statistically significant
trend to treat HCV earlier after LT during the period of 2014 and
2016 compared to 2005 and 2013 (Fig. 3) (p < 0.001).
Between 2005 and 2013, 6% (29/506) of LT recipients were
treated within the first year of transplant. Between 2014 and
2016, 33% (42/128) of LT recipients were treated within the
first year of transplant. Within 2 years of LT, the cumulative
proportion of LT recipients cured of HCV increased from 18%
(90/506) in the earlier era (2005–2013) to 78% (100/128) in
the later era (2014–2016) (p < 0.001).
Discussion
The results of our study demonstrate the proportion of recipients transplanted for HCV who are viremic after surgery has
significantly decreased with the introduction of DAAs. Whereas
most of our recipients were treated after liver transplant,
a substantial percentage of recipients appear to have been
treated even before LT. Such a strategy has been recently
demonstrated to be cost effective.26 However, differences in

Saab S. et al: HCV elimination

the need for re-LT has not been seen, likely as a result of limited
follow up in the latter cohort.
The timing of antiviral therapy is somewhat controversial.
Most providers agree that patients with cirrhosis Child–Pugh
class A should be offered therapy, but the role of DAAs in
patients with Child–Pugh class B and C is less clear. In patients
with Child-Pugh class C, the benefits of antiviral therapy are not
as clearly defined as those patients with Child-Pugh class B.
Indeed, there are reports of the model for end-stage liver
disease threshold, beyond which may be associated with
adverse effects from therapy.16 Treatment may be limited in
patients with renal insufficiency since regimens approved for
patients with decompensated liver disease are sofosbuvir-based
regimens. Most therapeutic regimens include ribavirin, which
has tolerability and safety issues in patients with advanced
liver disease. However, those studies that highlighted potential
adverse effects utilized protease inhibitors in their treatment
regimen. The metabolism of a protease inhibitor occurs in the
liver, so levels increase with worsening liver function.16
Achieving SVR in patients waiting for LT is associated with
improved model for end-stage liver disease score/Child-Pugh
class and the prevention of reinfection in the new liver graft.
The treatment of liver transplant candidates has been shown to
be cost effective.26 Although SVR is generally lower in patients
with decompensated liver disease, two DAA drug combinations
have been recently approved by the USA’s Federal Drug
Administration for patients who failed DAA treatment.27,28
Until DAAs became readily available, interferon-based therapy
was limited to not necessarily all viremic patients but only those
patients with established recurrent HCV disease.
Liver transplant recipients are an ideal population to achieve
HCV elimination. Treatment is biologically and technically
feasible, cost and benefits favor therapy, and there are strong
societal and political considerations.29 For instance, diagnosis
of both viral infection and recurrent disease is readily made and
noncontroversial. Antiviral therapy is not only highly effective,
but safe and tolerable. Although several DAA regimens list the
use of cyclosporine as a contraindication, most liver transplant
recipients receive tacrolimus as their backbone immunosuppression. The treatment of HCV has been considered cost effective across all cohorts studied.30–32 There is also a high level of
political consensus and support for eliminating HCV in liver
transplant recipients. Reinfection is universal and recurrent
disease clearly impairs patient and graft survival.3,4 Moreover,
the role of re-LT for HCV is controversial, with practices varying
throughout the country.
Our study has several important limitations. First, the study
represents a single institution’s experience, and the results may
not be generalizable to other settings. Nevertheless, our cohort
included over 500 recipients whose care spanned over a
decade. Another limitation is the brief follow-up in the era of
DAAs. Although we were able to demonstrate that HCV is being
eliminated from the LT recipient population, the recent utilization of DAAs prevents observing differences in re-LT rates for
recurrent HCV. We suspect that the utilization of DAAs both preand posttransplant will decrease the need for re-LT with longer
follow-up. Curing HCV has already been shown to lead to
decreased health care utilization in LT recipients.14 We were
also not able to define the SVR rates before LT. As demonstrated
by our results, there is an increasing number of LT candidates
being treated unbeknownst to our center. Thus, we are unable
to comment on the SVR, since the total number of candidates
treated are unknown to us. The SVR in liver transplant recipients
has been previously reported by us.5,22–25 The range of SVR
described using pegylated-interferon+ribavirin, pegylatedinterferon+ribavirin+boceprevir, and all-oral DAAs has been
10% to 30%, 40% to 60% and 90% to 95%, respectively.7
Hepatitis B (HBV) was once considered a relative contraindication for LT because of decreased patient and graft survival

Saab S. et al: HCV elimination

compared to other indications for LT.33 Advancement in the
treatment to prevent HBV reinfection in LT recipients has
resulted in HBV being associated with among the best survival
rates among all indications for LT.34,35 In the recent past, HCV
was also associated with one of the worst survival rates for any
of the major indications for LT.36 However, HCV can be eliminated from the liver transplant cohort in this country with treatment commencing either before or after liver transplantation.
The safety, efficacy and tolerability has resulted in a greater
proportion of patients being treated before their LT. Elimination
of HCV should eventually translate to improved patient and
graft survival.
