Ethical and economic considerations of rare
diseases in ethnic minorities: the case
of mucopolysaccharidosis VI in Colombia
Diego Rosselli,1 Juan-David Rueda,1 Martha Solano2
ABSTRACT
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI is an autosomal recessive
lysosomal storage disorder associated with severe
disability and premature death. The presence of
a mucopolysaccharidosis-like disease in indigenous
ethnic groups in Colombia can be inferred from
archaeological findings. There are several indigenous
patients with mucopolysaccharidosis VI currently
receiving enzyme replacement therapy. We discuss the
ethical and economic considerations, regarding both
direct and indirect costs, of a high-cost orphan disease in
a marginalised minority population in a developing
country.
Rare diseases warrant different ethical and
economic considerations, particularly when present
in indigenous populations or other minorities.
Barriers to access, for both diagnosis and treatment,
are exacerbated by geographical and cultural
marginalisation, as well as by the institutional
distrust that results from generations of neglect. In
addition, isolation often leads to consanguinity,
a breeding ground for recessive disorders.1 This
paper describes some of the special considerations
for an indigenous ethnic group affected by an
autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder.
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI)dor
MaroteauxeLamy syndromedis due to a lack of
arylsulfatase B, resulting in incomplete degradation
and cellular accumulation of glycosaminoglycans,
which leads to cell injury, severe disability and
premature death. Estimated illness prevalence
ranges from 1 in 43 261 births in Turkish immigrants living in Germany2 to 1 in 1 505 160 births in
Sweden.3 In Colombia, we know of 27 cases, 10 of
which are in indigenous groups. This works out at
an estimated prevalence of about 1 in 1 700 000 of
the general population, or 1 in 140 000 of the total
population of indigenous people in Colombia. From
any of these perspectives, MPS VI fits the definition
of a ‘very rare disease’ (prevalence <1 per 50 000
population).4
Treatment for MPS VI with galsufase (Naglazyme) was introduced in 2005 in the USA, and
a year later in Europe, and has been approved by the
FDA and EMA, the American and European
agencies, respectively.5 This enzyme replacement
therapy (ERT) is administered through weekly
intravenous infusion. Ideally, treatment should be
initiated early,6 since tissue injury can be delayed
but, at most, only partially reversed. Clinical trials
have shown improvement in walking capacity,7
pulmonary function,8 and growth and pubertal
development.9 In Europe, the cost per year per
patient has been estimated to range between
V150 000 and V450 000.10
Evidence of the presence of an MPS-like disease
dates back to prehistoric times in southwestern
Colombia. Several clay figurines from the Tumaco
culture (300 BC to 500 AD) depict patients with
craniofacial and spinal malformation, interpreted
by experts as cases of MPS.11e13 The Totoró is one
of 82 indigenous groups that survive in Colombia;
they live in the southwestern Andean highlands,
and their population is estimated to be 4130.14
Several cases of MPS VI have been confirmed in this
and other indigenous groups in Colombia.
These patients normally have a late diagnosis
and encounter various barriers to access to therapy,
which are common findings in rare diseases. An
ethical dilemma, often seen when treating indigenous groups, is the relationship with traditional
healers, who are sometimes overtly opposed to
orthodox medical interventions. This position adds
to generalised distrust in Western medicine. In the
case of the Totoró, we were not able to obtain
informed consent to publish the case of a family
with three affected siblings, with their difficulties
for authorisation to receive ERT, and the consequent direct, indirect and intangible costs associated with their condition, despite the good
response they have shown to the therapy.
A serious concern when treating these patients is
the cost of therapy. In the treatment of very rare
diseases, the cost of drugs is inversely proportional
to the prevalence of the disease.15 There are two
main reasons for this: first, the small number of
patients who will use a drug (the actual ‘market’
for the drug) means that each individual patient
will necessarily have to be charged a high fee;
second, it is difficult to find enough patients for
clinical trials. For example, the phase III trial that
led to approval of galsufase for ERT required
recruitment in 25 centres from 11 countries for
a final sample of 39 patients.7 Patient scarcity has
several consequences: it not only increases the time
and number of sites involved in a trial, it also leads
to lower statistical power and less chance of
proving differences between treatment alternatives.
Once the benefit was proven in the above trial, for
ethical reasons all patients in the trial received ERT,
losing the advantages of a placebo control group.
The first tendency of most medical decision
makers is to reject the possibility of ERT, on the
basis of its high opportunity cost (alternative uses
for these resources). On the other hand, those who
support paying the costs of treating rare disease

advocate the ‘rule of rescue’, originally proposed by Jonsen in
1986 (cited in Cookson et al16), which refers to the social
imperative to rescue identifiable individuals who face avoidable
death (or severe disability). These interventions would not fit
the conventional definitions, or fixed thresholds, of ‘cost-effectiveness’. The social value attached to rescuing shipwrecked
sailors or trapped miners is an example of this rule. The experience with the 33 Chilean miners confined hundreds of feet
underground is a recent example. Nobody questioned the 20
million dollars or so invested in their rescue.17 The same budget
would be needed to treat a similar number of patients with MPS
VI for 3 years in Colombia. Life-threatening decisions made by
people who have not seen the patients and their families should,
in our opinion, always be questioned.
According to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory
Committee, there are three requirements for the application of
the rule of rescue: (1) there is no existing alternative treatment;
(2) the medical condition should be severe, progressive and
decrease life expectancy; and (3) the number of patients affected
should be ‘very small’.
16 Another argument in favour of treating
rare diseases is the relatively low impact of these costs on the
national healthcare budget.
Cost-effectiveness studies do not usually include out-ofpocket expenses, or indirect and intangible costs, which in our
particular cases are significant. Transportation to specialised
centres for ERT, for both the patient and a care giver, can
represent a high burden for a poor family. Academic performance
and employment possibilities have been hindered for the whole
family of our patients, including unaffected siblings. Untreated
patients encounter even higher out-of-pocket indirect and
intangible costs, such as higher costs associated with complications, more frequent healthcare encounters, and more care
giver dedication. The heaviest burden in these diseases usually
falls on the mother, whose quality of life is most seriously
affected, and in ways that are difficult to quantify. When
denying ERT, most decision makers are not considering the
direct, indirect and intangible benefits obtained by the care
givers.
Access to treatment has been a serious problem for indigenous
patients with MPS VI who have to travel 2e4 h to the nearest
infusion centre. Our patients have received less than half of
the infusion sessions prescribed, mostly because each intravenous infusion requires the approval of the local health authority,
a bureaucrat in the provincial capital who perhaps sees this as
a distant (and expensive) problem.
In the long run, the burden of MPS VI and other inherited
disorders could be reduced with genetic counselling and
screening in high-risk populations. Currently, the Colombian
Ministry of Health is considering the introduction of tandem
mass spectrometry for neonatal screening of metabolic disorders.
A promising example of the benefits of screening has been set
with TayeSachs syndrome, an inherited lysosomal sphingolipid
storage disorder common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations.
Genetic screening has resulted in a 90% reduction in its incidence
in selected groups.18 Couples with early detection in pregnancy
must then make the difficult decision between abortion and
continuing with pregnancy. Other alternatives include adoption,
preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and artificial insemination.
In conclusion, orphan diseases, particularly in minorities,
should be addressed cautiously. Application of normal thresholds
for cost-effectiveness do not apply in these circumstances, where
distributive justice should be a main concern. This has led to
special regulations and financing schemes for rare diseases. In
addition, indirect and intangible costs and benefits should
always be taken into account before an expensive treatment is
denied.
