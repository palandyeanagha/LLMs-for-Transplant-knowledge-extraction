Abstract
Although a cure for HCV is on the near horizon, emerging drug cocktails will be expensive, associated with side-effects and
resistance making a global vaccine an urgent priority given the estimated high incidence of infection around the world. Due
to the highly heterogeneous nature of HCV, an effective HCV vaccine which could elicit broadly cross-neutralizing
antibodies has represented a major challenge. In this study, we tested for the presence of cross-neutralizing antibodies in
human volunteers who were immunized with recombinant glycoproteins gpE1/gpE2 derived from a single HCV strain
(HCV1 of genotype 1a). Cross neutralization was tested in Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cell cultures using infectious
recombinant HCV (HCVcc) expressing structural proteins of heterologous HCV strains from all known major genotypes, 1–7.
Vaccination induced significant neutralizing antibodies against heterologous HCV genotype 1a virus which represents the
most common genotype in North America. Of the 16 vaccinees tested, 3 were selected on the basis of strong 1a virus
neutralization for testing of broad cross-neutralizing responses. At least 1 vaccinee was shown to elicit broad crossneutralization against all HCV genotypes. Although observed in only a minority of vaccinees, our results prove the key
concept that a vaccine derived from a single strain of HCV can elicit broad cross-neutralizing antibodies against all known
major genotypes of HCV and provide considerable encouragement for the further development of a human vaccine against
this common, global pathogen.

Introduction
HCV is a major global health concern infecting 170 million
people worldwide [1]. Replication of the HCV RNA genome is
mediated by virus-encoded non-structural protein NS5B, an error
prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the low fidelity of
the enzyme has contributed to the high mutagenic rate and broad
antigenic diversity of the hepacivirus genus creating a major
challenge in developing a global vaccine. Historical therapy using
a combination of interferon-alpha and ribavirin has had significant
but limited success and while the recent addition of drugs
inhibiting a viral protease have increased the overall therapeutic
response, this combination exhibits substantial toxicity and more
than 30% of patients are not cured [2]. New, highly promising
drug cocktails are expected to be available over the next few years
and while a complete cure can be envisaged for nearly all treated
patients, the high expense and sophisticated clinical care required
for these drug combinations makes the prospect of universal
delivery very unlikely. Therefore, it remains imperative to develop
a global HCV vaccine. However, there are 7 major genotypes of
HCV and many hundreds of subtypes distributed globally, with
genotype 1a being the most prominent virus in the North America
and genotype 1b infecting the most people worldwide [3,4].
Among all genotypes, there is up to 31–33% nucleotide diversity
[4]. Various genotypes of HCV have been shown to have
differences in disease outcome and response to antiviral therapy
[5,6]. A global vaccine will therefore have to be effective against

this vast diversity of HCV variants and has represented a major
challenge.
A small fraction of individuals can spontaneously clear HCV
infection leading to the belief that prevention of HCV is possible if
a vaccine can elicit similar immune responses [7,8,9]. Cellular
immunity has been shown to be important to control HCV
infection. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells has been shown to
allow chronic, persistent infection in chimpanzees [10]. On the
other hand, the role of antibodies to control HCV infection has
been understudied, largely due to the lack of suitable assays for
neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibodies, until recently
[11,12,13,14,15]. Cross-neutralizing antibodies can be isolated
from chronically-infected patients [16,17,18] but only years after
the original infection when virus-specific cellular immune
responses are already blunted [17]. Despite the failure of these
antibodies to eradicate chronic infection, there is evidence that
they are actively driving evolution of the viral envelope
glycoproteins suggesting they are partially controlling infection
[19]. More recently, studies have demonstrated a correlation
between the presence of neutralizing antibodies and the clearance
of acute infection without the development of chronic, persistent
infection [9,20,21]. Furthermore, cross-neutralizing antibodies
have been shown to confer protection in passively-immunized
SCID mice transplanted with human hepatocytes [16,22].
All successful viral vaccines developed to date have been based
on the induction of neutralizing antibodies [23,24] usually
targeting the virion surface proteins. An important function of
these proteins is to interact with cellular receptors to mediate cell
entry and to fuse with host membranes during uncoating [25].
Neutralizing antibodies have been identified in natural HCV
infections targeting these proteins [26]. Our earlier work has
shown that a recombinant gpE1/gpE2 HCV vaccine is immunogenic in guinea pigs [27] and chimpanzees [28] and has been
shown to induce protective immune responses in the latter model
against experimental challenge with either homologous or
heterologous genotype 1a HCV strains [28]. Vaccinated chimpanzees had a significantly reduced rate of chronicity following
experimental challenge and some animals were even sterilized
against homologous virus challenge [29,30,31]. The gpE1/gpE2
antigen was derived from strain HCV1 of genotype 1a, the first
identified HCV genome [32]. A phase I dose-ranging clinical trial
has been conducted to test the safety and immunogenicity of this
vaccine in healthy volunteers [33]. All volunteers elicited
antibodies against the glycoproteins gpE1/gpE2 as measured in
EIA formats [33] and the vaccine was effective in inducing strong
T-helper responses to the vaccine [33]. Further studies have shown
that the vaccine induced antibodies targeting known neutralizing
epitopes and the sera of selected vaccinees prevented in vitro
infection by HCV derived from genotypes 1a and 2a [34,35].
Evidence for cross-neutralization of some diverse genotypes was
derived from vaccinated animals [22,27,28].
In this study, antisera from the phase I clinical trial was assessed
for cross neutralizing activity against representatives of all seven
major genotypes of HCV that occur globally. Very broad crossneutralization activity was evident but not all genotypes were
neutralized with similar efficiencies. We conclude that this vaccine
can elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies in human that target
epitopes that are highly conserved among all major genotypes of
HCV. When combined with the demonstrated efficacy of this
vaccine in the chimpanzee model [30], the current findings
strongly encourage the further development of this and related
vaccine candidates.
Results
Recombinant gpE1/gpE2 vaccine elicits neutralizing
antibodies
During the phase I dose-ranging clinical trial testing the
recombinant gpE1/gpE2 vaccine in healthy volunteers, maximal
anti-gpE1/gpE2 EIA antibody titers were observed at two weeks
post-third immunization [33]. Accordingly, we examined the
neutralizing activity of volunteers’ sera collected at two weeks post
third vaccination using the highest dose (100ug) of antigen in this
study. Chimeric virus encoding core, gpE1, gpE2, p7 and NS2
genes from heterologous H77C (genotype 1a) in the backbone of
JFH-1 genome has been produced to allow the study of genotype
1a specific entry [3]. This heterologous 1a chimeric virus was preincubated with dilutions of volunteers’ sera then added to cultured
hepatoma Huh7.5 cells and the subsequent level of infection was
quantified 2 days post-infection. As shown in Figure 1A, postvaccination sera showed significant neutralization of the heterologous 1a chimeric virus, with 5 of 13 sera being able to neutralize
over 50% of the virus, two of which neutralized up to 80% of viral
infectivity. Components in human sera, such as apolipoproteins,
have been shown to have non-specific effects on virus entry and
therefore may have contributed to the variable background in the
pre-vaccination samples [36,37]. In order to control for individual
differences in serum components, the neutralization activity of
post-vaccination sera was normalized using the neutralization
activity of the pre-vaccination sera from the same individual
(Figure 1B). This analysis showed that 92% (12/13) individuals
elicited significant neutralization activities, 5 of which (volunteers
1, 2, 5, 6 and 7) showed higher neutralizing activity compared to
others within the group. These data showed the vaccine was
capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies against heterologous 1a
virus infection. Importantly, volunteer 4 appeared to display
somewhat less virus neutralization after vaccination which is
consistent with an possible enhancement effect of the vaccine.
Further work is needed to ascertain if this effect is truly due to
vaccine enhancement in this individual or due to a high, variable
background in this particular individual combined with a low level
of neutralization elicited by the vaccine in volunteer 4.
Vaccine induced antibodies confer broad cross-genotype
neutralization in vitro
We chose sera from volunteers 1, 5 and 7, due to their high
neutralization activities among assayed volunteers, to test for crossgenotype neutralization activity using chimeric HCVcc encoding
core, gpE1, gpE2, p7 and NS2 genes derived from representative
strains of all 7 major genotypes that occur globally [3]. In Figure 2,
volunteers 5 and 7 showed a broad range of neutralization activity
against viruses of all 7 major genotypes. The profiles of broad cross
neutralization activity are very similar using both sera but in both
cases (and with volunteer 1), less cross-neutralization was observed
against 2b, 3a and 7a viruses. This indicates that while there must
be a neutralizing epitope(s) that is highly conserved across all
clades of HCV, genotype-specific neutralizing epitopes may also
be present.
Interestingly, all sera tested showed strong neutralization
activity against the chimeric virus HK6a/JFH-1. There are two
adaptive mutations in the glycoprotein region, F350 within gpE1
and N417 within gpE2. The N417 is a highly conserved residue
among all genotypes and mutation of this site leads to elimination
of a N-glycosylation site [3]. These mutations appear to confer
higher sensitivity to neutralization (Figure 2). This is consistent
with other data showing that various HCV antibodies neutralize
the tissue culture-adapted HK6a efficiently despite showing low

neutralization activity against other genotypes of HCV (data not
shown).
We observed a dose-dependent neutralization with increasing
amount of sera (Figure 3). Increasing the antiserum concentration
two-fold (to a 1:25 dilution) resulted in a significant enhancement
of neutralization activity compared with the standard dilution used
in the other figures of this paper (1 in 50 dilution). This
enhancement was observed against infection of both genotype
1a and genotype 2a viruses.
The Neutralization activity of human antisera is mediated
by immunoglobulin
The sera of the vaccinated volunteers was shown to have
neutralization activity inhibiting HCV infection. We wanted to
examine if this inhibition was antibody-mediated. Immunoglobulins were purified from antisera and tested for neutralization
activity. The isolation achieved over 90% purity of immunoglobulin monitored by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4A). Subsequent neutralization assays revealed that the purified-immunoglobulin accounts
for the majority of the neutralization activity, since the level of
neutralization activity was comparable between serum and
purified immunoglobulins. As expected, the neutralization activity
of the purified immunoglobulin was diminished upon dilution of
the amount of IgG added to the assay (Figure 4B).
Discussion
In this study, the neutralization activities of sera from human
volunteers vaccinated with a recombinant HCV gpE1/gpE2
vaccine in a phase I clinical trial were evaluated. The vaccine can
induce cross neutralizing activity against heterologous 1a challenge
in vitro (Figure 1). The neutralization activity of sera was mediated
by neutralizing antibodies (Figure 4) and 92% of post-vaccinated
sera showed evidence of neutralization activity against the 1a
genotype which predominates in Canada and the USA. Furthermore, two of the three tested sera showed broad cross-neutralizing
activity against representative viruses from all 7 HCV major
genotypes that are known to occur globally (Figure 2). This shows
that despite previous concerns about HCV envelope glycoprotein

and ‘‘post’’ sera were collected 2 weeks post-third immunization [33]. Grey line connects the neutralization activity of pre- and post- vaccination of
the same volunteer. The paired t test score of mean neutralization activity between pre- and post-groups is shown indicating a significant difference.

three volunteers’ sera within this group were not shown due to inconsistent results from two independent experiments.

vaccines being only able to elicit isolate-specific neutralization, a
vaccine derived from envelope glycoproteins of a single genotype
can elicit a broad, cross-genotype neutralizing response. The tested
sera showed better neutralization activities against viruses of
genotypes 1a/b, 2a, 4a, 5a and 6a, as compared with genotypes
2b, 3a and 7a, indicating that a cocktail of diverse antigens may
constitute an optimal global vaccine, although it remains to be
determined if antigens from a single strain can still confer adequate
global protection.
The recombinant gpE1/gpE2 vaccine has been shown earlier to
elicit a significant level of cross neutralization antibodies in the
chimpanzee model [28] and also to be efficacious at reducing the
incidence of chronic infection following experimental challenge
with either homologous or heterologous viral strains [30]. The
breadth of neutralizing antibodies elicited in chimpanzees was
similar to our finding reported here, with the vaccinated sera of
chimpanzees being more effective at neutralizing virus of
genotypes 1a, 4a 5a, 6a compared with genotype 2a and 3a
(genotype 7a was not tested) [28]. Although human antisera only
partially neutralized HCVcc in vitro, lower dilutions of serum
resulted in greater neutralization (Figure 3). Cross-neutralizing
antibodies isolated from chronically infected patients or by
molecular cloning have been shown to protect humanized mice
against heterologous viral infections [16,22]. It will be important to
test if the vaccine-induced antibodies reported here exhibit a
similar protective potency although this would seem feasible.
The vaccine was successful at inducing E1E2-reactive antibodies [33], but not all sera have strong neutralization activity as
shown in this study and elsewhere [35]. Limited characterization
of these vaccine antibodies has been reported [34]. Viral
neutralization may be facilitated by a strong avidity of antibodies
to previously identified neutralizing eptitopes [35], although new,
unidentified neutralization epitopes may exist. We are performing
research aimed at mapping the neutralization epitopes targeted by
this vaccine candidate in humans. Since broad cross-neutralization
has been observed, at least one cross-neutralizing epitope must be
highly conserved throughout all genotypes of HCV despite the
presence of considerable genetic heterogeneity elsewhere in the
viral genome. Broad, cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies

against chimeric 1a (H77C), 1b (J4), 2a (J6), 2b (J8), 3a (S52), 4a (ED43), 5a (SA13), 6a (HK6a) or 7a (QC69) HCVcc [3]. Virus neutralization assays were
performed using pre- and post- vaccination sera at a concentration of 1 in 50. Levels of neutralization activity of post-vaccination sera were
normalized with the activity of pre-vaccination sera. Representative of two independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown.

level of infection was monitored after staining using NS5A antibodies. Results of an experiment preformed in triplicates are shown. Fold changes of

have been isolated previously [26] and it remains to be determined
which of these antibody epitopes are also targeted by this vaccine.
In this study, we have used chimeric viruses derived in cell
culture to identify cross-neutralizing antibodies. It has been shown
that the physical properties of cell culture-derived virus are
different from animal-derived virus due to differences in lipid
composition [38]. The term ‘‘lipo-viro particle’’ has been used to
reflect the close association of HCV virus with apolipoproteins
which may affect the cell entry process [39,40]. Further studies are
needed to directly examine the neutralization activity of human
vaccinee antisera against virus derived from infected chimpanzees
and humans. Dreux et al have reported a negative impact of
human serum components on the activity of neutralizing
antibodies against HCV pseudoparticles [41]. However, we have
observed similar neutralization activity when immunogloblin was
purified with high efficiency from our human antisera and tested
at amounts equivalent to the original volume of serum. This would
indicate that in human vaccinees, no such inhibition of neutralization of HCVcc is detectable. It was also of interest to detect very
effective neutralizing antibodies against the chimeric virus bearing
genotype 6a envelope glycoproteins since this particular chimeric
virus is the only one containing adaptive mutations within the
envelope glycoprotein coding region [3]. It remains to be
determined which of these mutations mediates this enhanced
sensitivity to neutralization.
The data shown in this work indicates that a vaccine derived
from a single strain of HCV is capable of eliciting broad crossneutralizing antibodies implying that there must be a highlyconserved neutralization epitope(s) within the highly variable
gpE1/gpE2 envelope glycoproteins. The cross-neutralization titers
have so far been detected in only a minority of vaccinees and
tended to be low and although it is unknown what titers actually
mediate vaccine efficacy, it will be important in future to attempt
to enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine by further
modifications to the antigens, adjuvant and formulation (work in
progress). When combined with previous data demonstrating the
protective efficacy of this vaccine in the chimpanzee model, these
data offer considerable encouragement for the eventual production of an efficacious global vaccine to prevent the development of
chronic, persistent infection and associated disease in exposed
individuals.
Materials and Methods
Cells and viruses
Huh7.5 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS, 0.1 mM NEAA and 100 mg each of penicillin and
streptomycin as described [14].
Cell culture derived HCV (HCVcc) are produced using
previously described protocol [14]. Cells were washed twice with
ice cold PBS and subsequently resuspended to 1.56107 cell/ml.
400 ml of the cell suspension were mixed with 5 mg in vitro
transcribed RNA encoding HCV genome in 2 mm gap electroporation curvettes. 5 pulses of 860 V (99 ms, 1.1 s interval) were
delivered using the ElectroSquare Porator ECM 830 (BTX,
Holliston, MA). Post-electroporation, cells were incubated at room
temperature for 10 minutes before plating. Pre-cleared media was
collected as virus stocks either 3 or 4 day post-electroporation.
Virus titer (50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)) was
determined by limited dilution as described [14].
Volunteers’ sera and neutralization assay
All sera were acquired from a completed phase I randomized,
double-blinded, placebo-controlled study assessed the safety and
Figure 4. Neutralization of human antisera is mediated by immunoglobulin. Immunoglobulin was purified from volunteers’ pre- or postvaccinated sera. (A) 3 mg total protein of purified immunoglobulin of volunteers 5 and 7 were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie staining
for visualization. Heavy and light chains of purified immunoglobulin are marked with arrows. (B) The starting concentration of purified
immunoglobulin was used at 1 in 5 (by volume) followed by three 3-fold dilutions (i.e. 1 in 15, 1 in 45 and 1 in 135) in the neutralization assay using
chimeric 1a H77C/JFH-1 HCVcc (grey). The neutralization activities of the post- vaccinated samples were normalized against pre-vaccinated samples
of the same individual at the indicated dilution. As comparison, the neutralization activity of sera using at 1 in 50 dilution is shown (red). During the
purification, the recovered immunoglobulin were diluted 10 times in the procedure, therefore, 10 times more in volume of purified immunoglobulin
(1 in 5 dilution) was used compared with sera (1 in 50 dilution) (see materials and methods).

immunogenicity of HCV E1E2/MF59C.1 (DMID01–012), approved by the Saint Louis University Institutional Review Board
(IRB #15719) [33]. All volunteers’ sera of pre- and postvaccination were heat inactivated at 56uC for 1 hour.
16104 huh 7.5 cells per well were seeded on poly-lysine coated
96 well plates, 1 day prior to infection. For infection, 100 TCID50
HCVcc were premixed with heat inactivated sera diluted at 1 in
50 (by volume), for 1 hour at 37uC followed by adding to cells.
12 hour post-infection, the antibody-virus inoculum was replaced
with fresh culture media. Cells were then fixed 48 hours postinfection with methanol using previously described methods [14].
The amount of infection was quantitated by counting the number
of NS5A-positive foci detected using mouse monoclonal NS5A
antibody (9E10) [14]. The foci were detected and counted using a
CTL S6 immunospot analyzer (CTL, Cleveland Oh) as described
[42]. The percentage of neutralization was reported by comparison with no serum control or normalized with pre-vaccination
serum as described in text. The neutralization activity was
calculated using the following formula: % neutralization = (prepost)/pre 6100% where pre/post represent the number of NS5Apositive foci done after incubating with either the pre- or postvaccination sera as described in text.
In vitro RNA transcription
Plasmids encoding chimeric HCV genomes representing all
major genotypes (1–7) have been described [3]. DNA templates
were generated by linearizing plasmids using Xba I and infectious
RNA were generated using T7 RiboMAX large scale RNA
production system (Promega, Madison, WS). RNA was subsequently purified using the RNeasy mini kit (QIagen, Hilden
Germany).
Immunoglobulin purification
Immunoglobulin was purified using the Melon gel IgG spin
purification kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford IL). The purified
immunoglobulin was diluted 10 times in volume compared to the
starting material, i.e. 500 ml of purified immunoglobulin was
recovered at the end by starting with 50 ml of serum. Therefore,
ten times more (by volume) of purified immunoglobulin (as
compared with the original serum) was used to compare the
neutralization activity between the purified immunoglobulin and
the serum. The purity of isolated immunoglobulin was monitored
by SDS-PAGE followed by coomassie blue staining. The purity of
immunoglobulin using this method was higher than 90%.
