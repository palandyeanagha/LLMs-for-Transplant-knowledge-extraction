Tacrolimus (FK506) is widely used as an immunosuppressor in clinical practice; nonetheless a great part of its mechanisms of action and the processes triggering side effects 
remain unknown.1) A wide spectrum of adverse effects 
including neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, gastrointestinal, metabolic
and hematological effects have been reported associated with
tacrolimus.2) The major central nervous system (CNS) complications induced by this calcineurin inhibitor include
headaches, altered mental status (AMS), seizures, cortical
blindness, auditory and visual hallucinations, spasticity, paresis, and ataxia.3—5) The brain in many aspects differs from
the other organs of the body; particularly because it is completely separated from the systemic circulation by the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and haemato-cerebrospinal (HCE) barriers.6) P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is expressed in the luminal face of
the BBB endothelial cells membrane.7) A relevant role of Pgp
in the extrusion of toxic metabolites from brain and the impairment of drugs to cross the hematoencephalic barrier has
been determined using culture of brain capillary endothelial
cells and Pgp knockout mice.8—13) Substantial increases in
the concentration of vinblastine, paclitaxel and doxorubicin
were found in brains of knockout mice. These findings are
probably due to the drug removal function exerted by this
ATP-dependent efflux pump, also associated with the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenomenon.6) In humans, Pgp is
encoded by two genes MDR1 and MDR3 the first being associated with MDR phenotype.14) The participation of MDR3
P-glycoprotein in multidrug resistance has been suggested by
numerous studies; however, the rate of MDR3 P-glycoprotein-mediated transport is low for most drugs, and is not detectable due to its low expression rate.15—17) The expression
of other two ATP-binding cassette (ABC) type transporters,
ABCA2 and ABCA5, was also detected in human brain capillary cells.18) ABCA2 was related to cholesterol and phospholipids remodelling function in neurons and glial cells,
while ABCA5 lacks a recognized function in brain.19)
An effect of tacrolimus on multiple resistance to drugs was
early observed in lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines leading
to an increase in the intracellular accumulation and therefore
cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents.20) In addition, other
studies indicate that tacrolimus works as a substrate for
Pgp.21) Although many of tacrolimus mechanisms of action
and processes triggering neurotoxicity are still unknown, we
proposed to explore the possibility that the side effects of
tacrolimus at blood concentrations 30 ng/ml, could be
linked to the functional blockade and variations in the expression levels of MDR proteins, such as MDR1, and probably ABCA5 in BBB cells.

Tacrolimus is an agent used in clinical immunosuppressive drug therapies. A wide spectrum of adverse 
effects has been reported in association with this immunosuppressor, including neurotoxic effect. The upper limit
of therapeutic blood concentrations of tacrolimus has been described as 30 ng/ml in immunosuppressed patients.
We investigated the effect of this therapeutic dose of tacrolimus on the expression and activity of the multidrug
resistance protein 1 (MDR1 or Pgp, P-glycoprotein) and ATP-binding cassette transporters A5 (ABCA5) in
human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), derived from Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) endothelium,
these being the most predominantly expressed transcripts in these cells. The expression and activity of MDR1
transporter decreased with 30 ng/ml tacrolimus. The cell viability was not changed with the therapeutic dose
used. By contrast, ABCA5 transcripts, of unknown role as yet, increased their expression at this concentration.
We propose that the secondary cytotoxic effects of this immunosuppressor on CSN, besides the functional blockade related to multidrug resistance proteins, such as MDR1, and probably ABCA5, could be linked to variations
in the expression levels of these proteins at the BBB.

5 mg/ml MTT (thiazol blue tetrazolium) in RPMI 1640
medium for 1 h, and the formazan crystals were dissolved in
100 ml DMSO. Absorbance values at 550 nm were then measured using a microplate reader (Awareness Technology Inc.).
Absorbance values were expressed as percentages relative to
untreated controls.
Caspase-3 Assay The cells (1106) were grown for 24 h
in complete media then were treated with different concentrations of the immunosuppressor and staurosporine (as positive control of apoptosis) for 24 h (30, 100, 1000 ng/ml of
tacrolimus and 3 mM of staurosporine). The cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold PBS and suspended in Cell
Lysis Buffer (EnzChek Caspase-3 Assay Kit N°1); the cell
lysate was prepared by repetitive freeze-thaw cycles. The
lysate was centrifuged and the cell extracts, were harvested.
In these extracts caspase activity was assayed by detection of
a cleavage product in a spectrofluorophometer (Perkin Elmer
LS-50) at 405 nm. The amount of colour produced upon
cleavage is proportional to the amount of DEVDase (Caspase-3) activity present in the sample. The kit contains the
reversible aldehyde inhibitor to confirm that the observed fluorescence signal is due to the activity of caspase-3-like proteases.
Reverse Transcription and Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol® Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen, U.S.A.). First cDNA strand was
synthesized from 1 mg of total RNA using the 50 U of MMuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Stratagene, U.S.A.) and oligo
dT18 following manufacturer’s recommendation. PCR amplifications were carried out in a Personal Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf, U.S.A.) using 1 ml of cDNA, 1PCR buffer, 1.5 mM
Mg2, 0.4 mM dNTP’s, 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, U.S.A.) and 0.5 mM of gene-specific oligonucleotide.
Human specifics oligonucleotide primers were: b-actin-S: 5-
TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATC-3, b-actin-A: 5-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCC-3, MRP1-S: 5-CGTGTACTCCAACGCTGAC-3, MRP1-A: 5-CTGGACCGCTGACGCCCGTGAC-3, ABCA2-S: 5-CCCGGAAGATTGGCCGTATCCTGG-3, ABCA2-A: 5-TTGAAGGACAGCTGGGCCGC-3, ABCA5-S: 5-GATGATTCACTGAAGTGTATGGGTTA-3, ABCA5-A: 5-ATCTTAACTGCCCAGACACCATGAT-3, MDR1-S: 5-CCCATCATTGCAATAGCAGG-3,
MDR1-A: 5-GTTCAAACTTCTGCTCCTGA-3, MDR3-S:
5-GCTGTGTCAGGAATTGTTGA-3, MDR3-A: 5-TCGAAAAACAACCGGCATAGG-3. The PCR amplifications
were carried out in 30 cycles each consisting of denaturing
92 °C for 60 s, annealing to 55 °C (MDR1, MDR3, MRP1, bactin) or 62 °C (ABCA2 and ABCA5) for 45 s and extension
to 72 °C for 30 or 60 s. The PCR products were run on a 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced. Et-Br fluorescence intensities were quantified by densitometry analysis
using Molecular Analyst Software (BioRad, U.S.A.). The relative abundances of transcripts from each gene in HBMEC
cells were estimated by comparison of the ratios to b-actin.
Real-Time PCR Experiments were performed using a
LightCyclerTM Rapid Thermal Cycler (Roche Diagnostics,
U.K.). In brief, reactions (10 ml) included 0.5 mM gene specific primers; dNTPs, Taq DNA polymerase and reaction
buffer from QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN, U.K.). HotStart Taq DNA polymerase was activated
(95 °C, 15 min), and assays included a 95 °C denaturation
(15 s), annealing (20 s) at 55 °C (MDR1 and b-actin) or 62 °C
(ABCA5), and extension at 72 °C for 10 s. Product specificity
was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% v/v), melting curve analysis and sequencing. MDR1, ABCA5 and b
actin standards were prepared by amplicons purified from
agarose gels. The reactions were done in triplicate for each
cDNA sample.
Functional Assay by Calcein Accumulation To measure the effect of tacrolimus on MDR1 expression, the cells
(2105) were incubated in complete medium with or without
FK506 (30 ng/ml) on 24 well plates for 24 h. Then they were
washed three times with PBS 1X and incubated in complete
medium supplemented with 1 mM calcein-AM for 15 min
(Vybrant Multidrug Resistance Assay Kit, Molecular ProbesInvitrogen). Next, cells were washed three times with icecold PBS and then lysed in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X100. The fluorescence in cells extracts was measured in a
spectrofluorophometer (Perkin Elmer LS-50). The collected
data are the intensity of average fluorescence from 3105
cells for calcein (excitation: 494 nm, emission: 517 nm) (Vibrant Multidrug Resistant Assay kit, Molecular Probes).
For measuring the effect of the immunosuppressor on accumulation of fluorescent substrate, cells (2105
) incubated
in complete medium for 24 h were washed three times with
PBS 1X and incubated in complete medium supplemented
with 1 mM calcein-AM and adding 30 ng/ml FK506 for 15
min (Vybrant Multidrug Resistance Assay Kit, Molecular
Probes–Invitrogen). Then the fluorescence in cells extracts
was measured as mentioned above.
Western Blot Analysis Aliquots of HBMEC cell lysates
containing 50 mg proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad,
U.S.A.). The upper fraction of the blots were incubated with
anti-human Pgp mouse antisera (C-19, Santa Cruz, U.S.A.) at
1 : 500 dilutions for 1 h and the lower fraction with an antihuman b-actin antisera (Calbiochem, U.S.A.) at 1 : 5000 dilution. After washing, the blots were further incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-labelled anti-mouse IgG antibody
(DAKO, Denmark) at 1 : 5000 dilution at RT for 1 h. Following treatment of the blots immunodetection was revealed by
the chemiluminescent reagent ECL-plus (Amersham Pharmacia, Sweden).
Statistical Analyses Analyses were carried out on raw
data using the Peritz F multiple means comparison test.22)
Student's t-test was applied for unpaired data and p0.05
was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Expression of MDR Transporters in HBMEC Cells It
was determined that the genes encoding ABCA2, ABCA5,
MRP1 and Pgp (including MDR1 and MDR3 or both) are
expressed in the BBB cell line HBMEC, (Figs. 1A—C). The
semi-quantitative analysis shows that ABCA2 and MDR3
showed the less transcript content (Figs. 1A—C). On the
other hand, the most abundant transcripts in these cells were
for MDR1 (Fig. 1B) and ABCA5 (Fig. 1A). Due to their
higher expression in HBMEC cells their response under immunosuppressor treatment will be evaluated.
Effect of Tacrolimus on HBMEC Viability We evaluated the effects of therapeutic doses of tacrolimus, as those
1912 Vol. 31, No. 10

found in blood of immunosuppressed patients,23,24) on cell viability. The concentration of tacrolimus 30 ng/ml did not
have a significant effect on HBMEC viability upon exposure
for 24 h (928%, p0.01) (Fig. 2A). We observed approximately 20% reduction (826.5%, p0.01) in cell viability
only when, the tacrolimus concentration was as high as 1000
ng/ml (Fig. 2A). Similarly, higher concentrations of the immunosuppressor (100 ng/ml) induced apoptosis in HBMEC,
while no effect was observed at therapeutic doses of
tacrolimus (Fig. 2B).
Altered Expression of MDR1 and ABCA5 Genes by
Tacrolimus After showing that no modification on the viability of the HBMEC cells occurs at tacrolimus therapeutic
concentrations, it was verified in the HBMEC line that the effect of the immunosuppressor involved changes in the content of the transcripts of MDR1 and ABCA5 genes. When
HBMEC cells were exposed to 30 ng/ml of tacrolimus for
24 h, the MDR1 transcripts content decreased by a factor of
0.55 (p0.05) compared with untreated control cells (Fig.
3A). These data were correlated with the observed decrease
of the Pgp 170 kDa protein content over basal levels in approximately 30% (686%, p0.05) in these cells (Fig. 3B).
However, the transcripts content of ABCA5 increased 0.6
times (p0.05) following similar treatment using the immunosuppressor (Fig. 3C).
Diminution of Pgp Activity by Tacrolimus Finally, we
measured the Pgp transport activity using, as indicator, the
intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent substrate calcein-AM. There was an increased ability for accumulation of
the substrate in cells previously pre-incubated with 30 ng/ml
of tacrolimus for 24 h of 1.5 times over control (p0.01)
(Fig. 4A). As we hoped, a similar decreased transport activity
and higher intracellular accumulation of this substrate (1.8
times over control, p0.01), were also observed when
tacrolimus 30 ng/ml was present in HBMEC that had not
been pre-incubated for with the immunosuppressor 24 h (Fig.
4B). The ABCA5 function is still unknown; in consequence
its activity was not measured, nevertheless this transporter
showed the highest expression pattern in this cell line (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we focused on characterizing the expression,
in BBB cells HBMEC of ABC transporters. We found little
expression of ABCA2 and MDR3 transcripts in the HBMEC
cells. With respect to MDR3, it has been detected in mouse
brain capillaries.25) This finding does not agree with recent
reports on murine brain using high-resolution immunofluorescence, where MDR1, MRP1, MRP2 and MRP5 were detected in brain endothelial cells whereas MRP3 and MDR3

were undetectable.26) At this time, the function of this particular isoform in human is a phosphatidylcholine translocase,
or “flippase,” mediating export of this phospholipid into
bile.5) We found that MDR1 (Pgp) and ABCA5 are apparently the most expressed transcripts in HBMEC cells. It has
been reported that Pgp is widely distributed in the intestine,
lung, kidney, liver, adrenal gland, BBB, placenta and in some
types of blood cells.7,27) The expression of two types of
ABCA transporters, ABCA2 and ABCA5, has been detected
in endothelial cells of human brain capillaries.18) In addition,
ABCA5 has been mainly found in tissues such as brain, pancreas, muscle and testis, without a known function for this
transporter.19,28) Interestingly, this transporter has been localized intracellularly suggesting that rat ABCA5 may participate in intracellular sterol/steroid trafficking.29) While no evident function in extrusion of metabolites toward blood could
be attributed to this protein due to its intracellular localization, we thought that it should have an important function in
these haemato-encephalic barrier cells due to the high expression observed in our RT-PCR studies in HBMEC cells.
Moreover, the increased expression of this transporter upon
exposure to tacrolimus remains to be an interesting matter.
A significant relationship between organ rejection and median trough tacrolimus concentrations in the first month posttransplant has been established, with patients who display
low concentrations being more likely to reject the organ. It is
concluded that in order to minimize rejection in the first
month after renal transplantation, trough concentrations greater
than 10 ng/ml must be achieved.30) On the other hand, we reinforce that therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful in
the management of tacrolimus therapy and that tacrolimus
whole blood trough concentrations should preferably be kept
20 ng/ml to avoid side-effects, such as nephro- and neurotoxicity and infections as described by Bötigger et al.4) Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of pharmacokinetic drug interactions depends on a number of considerations, of which
the therapeutic index of the drug is the most important.31,32)
Tacrolimus is considered a narrow therapeutic index drug.33)
Since the correlation between tacrolimus dose and blood
concentration is poor because of inter and intraindividually
variable pharmacokinetics,33,34) monitoring of tacrolimus
blood concentrations is required to guide dosage.35,36) In clinical practice, tacrolimus therapeutic drug monitoring is almost exclusively based on Cmin. However, it must be taken
into account that in individual patients the terminal half-life
of tacrolimus can exceed 100 h37) and at 12 h postdose, when

the Cmin is collected, it is not yet completely postdistributive
and neither is in the terminal exponential phase. Target Cmin
may vary from centre to centre and depends on the analytical
method used the type of transplant, differences in immunosuppressive protocols and individual factors such as immunological risk and tolerability.36) Several studies have addressed the question whether a relationship exists between
blood tacrolimus concentrations and the development of toxicity or the risk of organ rejection.38,39) Most clinical studies
in kidney and liver graft patients confirmed that higher blood
tacrolimus concentrations are associated with an increased
incidence of toxicity,34,39—44) such as nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. On the other hand, significantly lower tacrolimus
Cmin
34,39) and AUC1240) values were found in patients with rejection compared to those without acute rejection after kidney or liver transplantation. Most of tacrolimus pharmacokinetic studies, when administered alone or associated with
other drugs in numerous transplant recipients have shown
that in a high percentage of patients analyzed, blood tacrolimus
concentration is close or exceeds values of 30 ng/ml, nonetheless, the average Cmin and Cmax values may range from 6 to 26
and 14 to 38 ng/ml, respectively.31,45—49) Based on the latter
information we decided to use in our study 30 ng/ml tacrolimus
treatments.
Studies have shown that tacrolimus and its analog rapamicin were able to revoke the MDR phenomenon by increasing
intracellular accumulation of cytotoxic drugs such as
chemotherapeutic agents in drug resistant cells.20) However,
less is known about the effect of immunosuppressors on the
expression of ABC transporters. A previous study showed
that therapeutic doses of cyclosporine increased the expression of Pgp in endothelial and renal tubule cells, however
tacrolimus lacks of this effect.50) Our results show for the first
time that there is a differential variation in the expression of
the transcripts for MDR1 and ABCA5 under exposure to
tacrolimus in BBB cells (HBMEC). Similarly, a decrease of
the MDR1 expression in lymphocytes under renal transplant
using tacrolimus as immunosuppressor has been observed.51)
Since the main function of Pgp in the hematoencephalic
barrier is the extrusion of toxic metabolites back to the
blood,5) and the effect of tacrolimus is to decrease the expression and activity of this transporter, we postulate that the
neurotoxic consequences of the use of this immunosuppressor are probably due to the endothelial accumulation and increased flux of this and other toxic molecules toward the
brain. A genetic polymorphism in the MDR1 gene was recognized as a predictor factor for tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity which may be explained by a reduced activity of Pgp
and accumulation of tacrolimus into the brain.21) In addition,
calcineurin is selectively enriched within neurons of the
CNS.
