Hypoxic encephalopathy and osmotic demyelination are independent clinical entities. We
describe a rare case with these two complications as demonstratedby magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). A 58-year-old womanhad adrenal crises twice a decade due to Sheehan syndrome. At the
second crisis, hyponatremia wasremarkable with consciousness disturbance which was rapidly
corrected by intraveneous administration of glucocorticoid and hypertonic saline. The maneuver
improved consciousness disturbance, but resulted in hypokalemic ventricular fibrillation with
circulatory failure. After the normalization of the circulation, however, her consciousness level
deteriorated again. Repeated brain MRIrevealed acute and chronic phases of cortical laminar
necrosis and central pontine myelinolysis.

Introduction
The central nervous system is vulnerable to hypoxia and
rapid osmotic changes. Transient anoxia or hypoxemia has
been reported to irreversibly affect neurons in the cerebral
cortex and corpus striatum ( 1 ). On the other hand, hyponatremia
below 120 mEq// brings about signs related to brain edema,
weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, irritability, seizures,
and consciousness disturbance. These symptoms typically subside following the correction of hyponatremia, but a rapid
correction of hyponatremia has been reported to cause central
pontine and extra pontine myelinolyses (2). Although
hyponatremic encephalopathy lacks a specific neuropathological lesion, myelinolysis has been reported to be due to the
moderate loss of the myelin (3). The recent progress in the brain
imaging has enabled us to diagnose these lesions. We treated a
rare case with the combined disorders of anoxic encephalopathy and osmotic myelinolysis. Here, we report the clinical
course and the findings of detailed computed tomography (CT)
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of this patient with
central pontine myelinolysis as well as anoxic encephalopathy
due to secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Case Report
A 58-year-old woman was diagnosed as Sheehan syndrome
due to panhypopituitarism and a history of massive delivery
bleeding at the age of 22. She had a history of partial thyroidectomy due to nodular struma at the age of 32. In 1983, at the
age of 51, she had the first episode of adrenal crisis with
hyponatremia (1 13 mEq//). At this time, panhypopituitarism
was pointed out, but she had not been treated with the supplementation of glucocorticoid, except for thyroid hormone
(thyradin S 50 jug/day). The second adrenal crisis developed in
January 1990 with drowsiness, diarrhea, fever, and severe hyponatremia.
She was admitted to another hospital on February 5, 1990
due to a short attack of generalized tonic seizure. She was
unconscious, and her light reflexes were slightly delayed with
round and normal sized pupils. She had increases in tendon
reflexes and positive Babinsky signs. Blood pressure was 1 10/
60 mmHgand ECGwas within the normal range. Serum
sodium (Na) and potassium (K) were 96 and 4.3 mEq//, respectively (Fig. 1), and plasma osmolality was 230 mOsm/kg. The
hyponatremia normalized to 1 40 mEq// with the administration
of glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone 100 mg) and hypertonic

improved when serum Na increased to 120 mEq// (Fig. 1).
During these treatments, however, hypokalemia (2.36 mEq//)
and 5 episodes of ventricular fibrillation over 8 hours were
observed. At each episode, defibrillation was attempted to
recover her systemic circulatory failure with i.v. administration of KC1. She recovered regular sinus rhythm 12 hours after
the last attack of ventricular fibrillation. However, her consciousness deteriorated again during these episodes and she
becameunconscious.
She was transferred to Tohoku University Hospital on February 7, 1990, when her blood pressure and serum Na and K
levels had already normalized. On admission, she showed
delirium tremens. She had equal and round pupils, but her light
reflex was sluggish. Pathological reflexes were also noticed.
Serum enzymes were elevated, LDHwas 2,232 IU//, GOT
1,560 IU//, GPT 1,560 IU//, and CPK 1,243 IU//. On blood
analysis, WBCwas 17,700/^,1, RBC 3,550,000/jnl, and platelet

findings had not been noticed 2 days before the admission and
gradually became normalized over the subsequent 3 months
(Fig. 1). Endocrinological data are shown in Table 1. Urinary
excretion of 17-OHCSand 17-KS was decreased. Plasmalevels
of gonadotropins, thyrotropin, and ACTHwere decreased.

were within the normalrange.
For one monthduring admission, serumelectrolytes were
maintained within normal range with a replacement of glucocorticoid (dexamethazone 0.5 mg/day) (Fig. 1). Under administration of glucocorticoid, urinary diluting ability normalized.

pressin concentrations were within the normal range (0.2-1.0
pg/ml). Serumelectrolyte levels were normal even after the
induction of tube feeding. Her consciousness did not improve
during the admission. Electroencephalography showed a quasistuporous state on February 20 and a severe vegetable state on
March 23. On Mayll, she was transferred to the previous
hospital for further treatment.
Plain brain CT on February 7 showed only a slight effusion
in the right intracranial space (Fig. 2 A-l and -2), and diffuse
brain swelling on February 15 (Fig. 2 B-l and -2). Plain CT on
April 3 (Fig. 2 C-l and -2) showed not only diffuse cortical
atrophies but also low density areas in the grobus pallidus,
internal and external capsules, and the thalamus. Brain MRI
studies on unenhanced axial Tl-weighted (TR, 500 ms; TE, 15
ms) images on February 15 (Fig. 3 A-l and -2) showed mild
cortical laminar hyperintensity. On March 29, MRstudies
under the same condition showed increases in the cortical
hyperintensity and the subcortical hypointensity in the right
hemisphere (Fig. 3 B-l and 2). Hyperintensities in the basal
ganglia were also noticed in the same studies (Fig. 3 B-2). On
April 19, there was a slight progression of the subcortical
hypointensity (Fig. 3 C-l and -2). Sagittal MRI studies were
repeated during the admission and showed hypointensities on
Tl-weighted (TR, 500 ms/TE, 15 ms) images on April 19 and
hyperintensities on T2-weighted (TR, 2,500 ms/ TE, 90 ms)
images on March 1 in the central pontine region and pituitary
fossa, respectively (Fig. 4A and B). These slices also showed

Discussion
In the present patient, it is plausible that hyponatremia was
caused by the glucocorticoid deficiency, because under the
supplementation of hormonewater diuresis normalized and
hyponatremia was not observed. Kimura et al (4) reported that
secondary adrenocortical insufficiency impairs renal diluting
ability with subsequent hyponatremia. Moreover, it is well
known that sufficient doses of glucocorticoid can prevent
patients with adrenal insufficiency from an adrenal crisis under
stressful states such as infection, operation, and high fever.
However, such a sufficient dose of glucocorticoid was not
administered to the present patient. The initial episode of
consciousness disturbance might have been due to the
hyponatremia, because its correction improved consciousness
disturbance. However, the subsequent neurological deterioration following the normalization of serum Na levels appeared
to be related to more complex disorders. Repeated ventricular
fibrillation might give rise to circulatory insufficiency with the
subsequent cerebral hypoxia or anoxia and the fairly rapid
correction of hyponatremia could cause demyelination in the
*pons. Indeed, central MRIrevealed the existence of cortical
laminar necrosis and central pontine myelinolysis. Both lesions
might be responsible for the impairment of consciousness.
Laminar cortical necrosis has been reported to be one of the
findings due to anoxic or hypoxic encephalopathies (1). The
lesion is diffuse and not limited within a single vascular territory
in the brain cortex. Metabolic disorders, anemia, and circulatory disorders have been considered to be pathogenetic. Boyko
et al (5) have revealed that cortical neurons between cortical and
gray layers are necrotic with hemorrhage. On MRI, recently,
Takahashi et al (6) have shown that edematous changes are
dominant in the acute phase and laminar thickening of the
cortical layer with a high intensity is remarkable in the chronic
phase. In the present patient, therefore, it is plausible that the
cardiogenic shock might have given rise to the hypoxic encephalopathy, thereby resulting in the cortical necrosis and the
irreversible neurological deterioration. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the potassium balance to prevent serious cardiac
impairment, while treating hyponatremia.
On the other hand, pathophysiologies of central pontine
myelinolysis (CPM) following the rapid correction of
hyponatremia have been explained as follows. Laureno and
Karp (3) showed that rapid increases in plasma osmolality are
critical for the impairmentof the myelin sheath, whereas axons
and neurons were not affected. Sterns et al (2) reported that
increases of less than 12 mEqin serum Na within 24 hours were
adequate to prevent CPM. Brunner et al (7) found that the initial

severity and duration of the hyponatremia were crucial factors
in the development ofpontine lesions. In an animal study, Lien
et al (8) reported that a rapid correction of hyponatremia due to
Na infusion provokes an overshoot of intracellular Na and Cl
levels in brain tissues with decreased ideogenic osmol. MRIhas
been shown to be effective to detect disorders such as CPM.
Rippe et al (9) reported that a low intensity on the Tl-weighted
image as well as a high intensity on the T2-weighted image in
the central pons is characteristic ofCPM. Sterns et al (2) showed
that two-thirds of the disorder have been found to be reversible
based on neurological symptomssuch as coma, quadriplegia,
pseudobulbar palsy, and behavioral changes. In the present
case, it is likely that the rapid increase in plasma osmolality, but
not the hypoxic episode was responsible for the CPM,because
neurons are moresensitive to hypoxia than myelin.
Cacciari et al (10) reported that empty sella shows the
existence of cerebrospinal fluid in the fossa, which could be
detected as a high intensity on T2-weighted image and a low
intensity on Tl. These findings might be compatible with the
MRI findings in the present case. Indeed, Fleckman et al (1 1)
suggested that Sheehan syndrome is one of the causes of the
secondary empty sella.
In conclusion, adrenal insufficiency induced by hypopituitarism brought about water-electrolyte disturbances, cardiac
emergency and a variety of types of brain damagewith consciousness disturbance. MRIrevealed brain cortical laminar
necrosis, one of the hypoxic encephalopathies, and central
pontine myelinolysis related to the rapid correction of severe
hyponatremia.
