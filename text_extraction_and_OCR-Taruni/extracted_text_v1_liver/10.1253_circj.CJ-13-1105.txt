Introduction
Many complex cardiac malformations are characterized by the 
existence of only one functional ventricle, which has to maintain both the systemic and pulmonary circulations. Surgical 
approaches to palliating single-ventricle (SV) physiology must 
focus on ameliorating the two major challenges of this parallel 
circuit of blood flow: (1) cyanosis induced by mixing of systemic deoxygenated and pulmonary oxygenated blood and (2) 
chronic volume overload assumed by the single functional 
ventricle, which leads to dilatation, hypertrophy, and failure 
without palliation. 
In 1971, Francis Fontan published his successes with a new 
surgical approach for patients with tricuspid atresia (TA) that 
completely separated the pulmonary and systemic circulations.1 The SV was committed solely to the systemic circulation while the pulmonary circulation was driven by venous 
return directly to the pulmonary arteries, bypassing the right 
heart. This led to a marked improvement in survival among 
patients with univentricular physiology. 
The Fontan procedure has continued to evolve over the past 
four decades, leading to improved early and intermediate 
prognoses. However, it remains a palliative procedure and 
limited in its ability to fully eliminate the problems associated 
with SV physiology. As the early Fontan patients move to 
adulthood, there remains a steady attrition rate attributable to 
several known complications of the procedure, with the three 
most common modes of death being heart failure (HF) from 
ventricular dysfunction, thromboembolism and sudden death.2,3
As our knowledge continues to evolve, new therapeutic targets 
and treatment strategies have been identified that have led to 
improved overall morbidity and mortality. 
Staged Surgical Palliation
The Fontan operation was first used in 1968 for the repair of TA 
and was described by Fontan and Baudet in 1971.1 It included 
the insertion of an aortic or pulmonary homograft valve, at both 
the inflow and outflow of the right atrium. In 1973, Kreutzer et 
al described the use of the pulmonary valve of a patient with 
TA to connect the right atrium (RA) to the pulmonary artery 
(PA).4 These initial operations were based on the principle that 
the RA can act as the “pump” for the pulmonary circulation.5
Candidates for the Fontan procedure must be carefully selected to give each procedure an optimal chance of succeeding. The ideal age for the Fontan operation remains a focus of 
debate despite advances in surgical techniques over the years. 
Optimal criteria for Fontan completion include normal systolic and diastolic ventricular function, unobstructed pulmonary venous return, near normal pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR), unobstructed PA flow, appropriately sized PAs, and 
absence of atrioventricular (AV) valve insufficiency or stenosis.6 The size and caliber of the pulmonary vessels and the 
functionality of the ventricle remain the most important criteria in the choice of patients for a successful Fontan operation.5
Management strategies in the neonatal period are directed 
toward providing an adequate source of pulmonary blood flow 
using a surgically created aortopulmonary shunt (BlalockTaussig shunt), ensuring systemic flow via a Norwood or 
Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure and allowing for unrestricted

The Adult With a Fontan: A Panacea Without a Cure?
– Review of Long-Term Complications –
Lauren Lastinger, MD; Ali N. Zaidi, MD
The univentricular heart includes a spectrum of complex cardiac defects that are managed by staged palliative 
surgical procedures, ultimately resulting in a Fontan procedure. Since 1971, when it was first developed, the procedure has undergone several variations. These patients require lifelong management, including a thorough knowledge 
of their anatomic substrate, hemodynamic status, management of rhythm and ventricular function, together with 
multi-organ evaluation. As these patients enter middle age, there is increasing awareness of long-term complications 
and mortality. This review highlights the concept behind the staged surgical palliations, the unique single ventricle 
physiology and the long-term complications in this complex cohort of patients. (Circ J 2013; 77: 2672–2681)

circulation is affected by the role of gravity on regional pulmonary blood flow. West et al divided the upright lung into 3 
zones. The superior zone has no flow because the alveolar 
pressure is higher than the arterial pressure. The inferior zone 
has the maximum flow because the arterial and venous pressures are higher than the alveolar pressure. In between, the 
arterial pressure is higher than the alveolar pressure but lower 
than the venous pressure, causing the so-called waterfall phenomenon.12 This zone is likely to be smaller in Fontan patients 
whose “pulmonary vascular capacitance” is thereby reduced.
The Fontan circulation often leads to a contractility-afterload mismatch, consisting of an increase in ventricular afterload and a lack of compensatory increase in contractility. In a 
biventricular circulation, CO and stroke work are maintained, 
despite increased ventricular afterload (eg, aortic stenosis and 
systemic hypertension) by increased ventricular contractility. 
This compensatory mechanism does not exist in the Fontan 
circulation and leads to decreased CO and stroke work.13,14 It 
should be emphasized that the driving force of the circulating 
blood volume between the systemic and pulmonary veins is 
the pressure gradient between central venous pressure and the 
left atrium (LA), assisted mechanically by the thoracic muscles and respiratory function.5
Ventricular function and contractility in the SV patient are 
often depressed, thought to be because of abnormal pre-Fontan 
development when the ventricle is subjected to large volumes 
and often high pressures following PA banding, leading to 
ventricular hypertrophy and dilation.15 The rapid reduction of 
preload that occurs after cavopulmonary connection results in 
an under-loaded ventricle, leading to a mismatch in diastolic 
volume and ventricular mass. Although hypertrophy may decrease over time following the Fontan operation, abnormal 
ventricular relaxation and decreased ventricular compliance 
persist, leading to a slow decline in diastolic function and CO 
with relatively well-preserved systolic function.10,15,16
Long-Term Complications in the Adult 
With Fontan Physiology
Functional Status and Exercise Capacity In the early stages following a Fontan operation, most patients report a satisfying quality of life and functional status.17,18 Maximal exercise 
capacity at baseline has been shown to be lower than expected 
compared with healthy individuals and progressively declines 
as Fontan patients age.19,20 Although the reasons for this decline are not well understood, predictors for poor functional 
status include time since Fontan surgery, right ventricular (RV) 
morphology, pre-Fontan end-diastolic pressure, and pre-Fontan oxygen saturations.21 Blaufox et al22 showed that in pediatric patients (6–18 years) after the Fontan procedure, a lower 
resting heart rate and a higher peak heart rate are each independently associated with better physical function as measured by 
anaerobic threshold and Child Health scores. However, these 
correlations are weak, suggesting that other factors may have 
a greater effect on the functional outcome of pediatric patients 
after the Fontan operation.22
PVR In the absence of the hydraulic force of the RV, Fontan circulation results in a paradox of systemic venous hypertension and PA hypotension. The absence of pulsatile blood 
flow and low mean pressure in the PA underfills the pulmonary vascular bed and increases the PVR. The PAs may often 
be abnormal (ie, small, discontinuous, or stenosed) and it is 
important to identify restricted blood flow to and from the 
lungs.23 It is well known that pulmonary over circulation leads 
to increased PVR and over time will lead to PA hypertension 
atrial mixing via an atrial septectomy. The first cavopulmonary 
connection is created in the first year of life via the bidirectional Glenn shunt (Figure 1). The Fontan circulation is completed by connection of the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the PA 
once growth of the pulmonary vasculature is appropriate, usually between 1 and 5 years of age. This staged surgical process 
serves to slowly acclimate the pulmonary vessels to the increased blood flow and the SV to decreased volume load in a 
stepwise fashion. The end result achieves a complete separation of pulmonary and systemic blood flow, and allows the SV 
to function solely as the systemic ventricle.5,6
Historically, the IVC connection was made by anastomosing the “ventriculized” RA to the PA in an attempt to maintain 
some pump function in the pulmonary circuit.4,5 This “old 
style” atriopulmonary (AP) Fontan (Figure 2) has since been 
replaced by the total cavopulmonary connections, which have 
the advantage of preserving energy and eliminating less effective blood flow. The lateral tunnel (LT) (Figure 3) and the 
extracardiac (EC) conduits (Figure 4) have shown improved 
survival and hemodynamic superiority over the AP technique.5–8 The LT operation was introduced in the 1980s and 
creates a path from the IVC to the PA using a prosthetic baffle 
sutured to a portion of the lateral wall of the RA.7 It has the 
advantage of being able to grow with the patient, but still assumes a significant risk of inducing atrial arrhythmias because 
of the suture lines in the atrial wall and pressure induced on 
the RA from venous return to the PA. The EC conduit was 
introduced in the early 1990s and uses a tube of synthetic graft 
material to connect the IVC to the PA, bypassing the RA entirely and minimizing risk of inducing atrial arrhythmias.8
However, this variant cannot grow with the patient and cannot 
be performed until the patient is large enough to receive an 
appropriate sized graft. Additional disadvantages of the EC 
Fontan include the potential for tunnel stenosis requiring stenting or surgical revision.9 Frequently, in high-risk patients, a 
small fenestration is created between the conduit and the 
pulmonary atrium to allow a residual right-to-left shunt, thereby limiting caval pressure and congestion, but increasing the 
preload of the systemic ventricle and cardiac output (CO) at 
the expense of mild cyanosis. Fenestrations may be electively 
closed via percutaneous catheter techniques. Low-risk Fontan 
patients can be managed surgically without a fenestration, 
thereby eliminating the need to close the fenestration if it 
persists over many years. 
Fontan Physiology: An Interplay of Pulmonary 
Vascular Resistance, Ventricular 
Contractility and Cardiac Output
Unlike normal cardiac physiology, which functions ideally with 
balanced contributions of preload, afterload and contractility, 
the loss of ventricular contractility to the pulmonary circulation 
in the Fontan physiology results in CO that is almost entirely 
dependent on preload, which itself is dependent on PVR.6,10
Current estimates indicate that preload and CO at rest are reduced to approximately 70% of expected for body surface area 
following a Fontan operation.11 The most important variable in 
determining preload (and thus CO) is PVR, a concept that is 
supported by multiple studies on Fontan hemodynamics. The 
lack of pulsatility in the pulmonary circulation is thought to 
induce endothelial dysfunction, which leads to increased PVR. 
Such increments in PVR lead to decreased CO and exercise 
intolerance, increased risk of Fontan failure and decreased 
survival.10–12 In addition, nonpulsatile preload in the Fontan

side the atrium.31 Bradyarrhythmias have also been observed 
in patients undergoing the EC technique.32
By far, the most common arrhythmia is intraatrial re-entrant 
tachycardia (IART), which is thought to be caused by postoperative atrial scarring.33,34 Atrial fibrillation is a less common 
complication and more often associated with the LA. Often 
atrial arrhythmias are difficult to control using conservative 
treatment and can lead to progressive ventricular dysfunction.35
Short-term treatment options are often limited to direct current 
(DC) cardioversion, as preload-sensitive Fontan patients respond very poorly to the rapid ventricular rate, particularly in 
the setting of high PVR and poor contractility. However, antiarrhythmic medications can also be effective in the hemodynamically stable patient. Long-term treatment options include 
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and medication. RFA may be 
only temporarily effective, with new re-entrant pathways 
emerging from scar tissue and suture lines. Patients with AP 
Fontans who develop IART may experience the greatest benefit from Fontan conversion, atrial reduction surgery with RA 
Maze procedure. AV nodal ablation and pacemaker placement 
is considered a last resort for therapy-resistant IART.36
Sinus node dysfunction is frequently seen because all Fontan 
operations involve surgery around the sinus node, and may 
directly damage the node or affect its innervation or blood supply.27 Damage to the sinus node will ultimately require epicardial pacemaker placement in symptomatic patients. Transvenous leads may be an option in the AP or LT Fontan patients, 
but are not feasible with the EC conduit because of the absence 
of a RA communication. Patients with heterotaxy syndromes 
and anomalies of the AV valve can also develop such arrhythmias.5 Ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death have 
rarely been reported in patients with SV physiology and may 
occur in the setting of progressive ventricular dysfunction. 
When atrial tachyarrhythmias are detected, underlying hemodynamic causes, such as obstruction of the RA to PA anastomosis, should be sought and anticoagulation pursued.33,37
Thromboembolism Thromboembolism is a commonly encountered complication of the Fontan circulation, occurring in 
up to 20% of patients both early and late in the surgery.38 In-
(PAH). The pre-Fontan surgical stages attempt to limit pulmonary blood flow either by PA banding or PA division with 
shunt placement. Maintaining a low PVR after the Fontan 
operation is crucial to its success, as this allows for maximal 
blood return to the pulmonary vascular bed in the nonpulsatile 
pulmonary circulation. As a result, the Fontan CO is driven by 
PVR, unlike a normal cardiovascular circuit in which CO is 
driven by heart rate, stroke volume and contractility. 
Causes of increased PVR and subsequently decreased CO 
include mechanical obstruction of the Fontan circuit (ie, thrombus, pulmonary stenosis) and PA vasoconstriction. Mechanical 
obstruction is often amenable to repair via cardiac catheterization with stenting or angioplasty. Treatment of diffuse PA vasoconstriction is more complex, largely targeting the impaired 
production of vasoactive mediators such as nitric oxide and 
prostacyclin by the pulmonary vascular endothelium and overproduction of endothelin-1.24 Historically, patients have been 
minimally responsive to pulmonary vasodilators, although improved exercise capacity has been demonstrated with the use 
of sildenafil25 and inhaled iloprost.26 Further research to evaluate the benefits of PAH medications in the failing Fontan patient, either as a maintenance medication or as a bridge to 
transplant, is warranted.
Arrhythmias Atrial arrhythmias are one of the most common complications associated with the Fontan repair, affecting more than 50% of patients, often as early as 5 years following the surgery.27 This complication has been attributed to 
atrial dilation and hypertrophy, atriotomy and suture lines, and 
disruption of normal atrial blood flow during surgery. Incidence has decreased over the past 30 years as the surgical 
technique has moved away from the AP Fontan toward the LT 
and the EC conduit, both of which exclude the atrial cavity 
from the circulation.28 Overall, the EC conduit seems to have 
the lowest incidence of postoperative atrial arrhythmias, making it the surgery of choice in many centers.29,30 Rarely, atrial 
arrhythmias can recur, with access to the arrhythmia substrate 
via a transbaffle puncture may be considerably complicated by 
an EC conduit. The LT technique is a risk factor for the development of arrhythmias because of the suture lines placed inFigure 5. Image from a transesophageal echocardiogram showing a

Long-Term Complications of Fontan Surgery 2677
Protein-Losing Enteropathy Protein-losing enteropathy 
(PLE) is one of the least understood complications associated 
with the Fontan operation, yet it is also one of the most significant in terms of its effect on mortality. It is defined as the 
loss of serum proteins into the gut as a result of a compromised intestinal barrier, which occurs in 3.7% of patients with 
Fontan-type surgery and is clinically characterized by fatigue, 
peripheral edema, pleural and pericardial effusions, ascites, 
and chronic diarrhea.52 The etiology of PLE is unproven, but 
thought to be related to low CO in combination with an increase in systemic venous pressure (specifically mesenteric) 
that leads to dilated lymphatics and loss of protein in the gut.53
The diagnosis has historically been associated with increased 
mortality, with survival at 5 years after PLE diagnosis being 
50%, although this may have improved in the past 15 years 
with the advent of multiple treatment options for this complex 
problem.52
Treatment of PLE can often be frustrating, with few treatment options proven to have significant benefit in reducing 
symptoms or improving mortality. Hemodynamic assessment 
via cardiac catheterization is recommended to evaluate for 
structural complications with the Fontan that may be amenable 
to directed intervention or for ventricular failure that may be 
optimized with medications. Atrial pacing to increase CO may 
be of some benefit in patients with sinus node dysfunction.54
If hemodynamic compromise is not found, the diuretic combination of furosemide and spironolactone is often the first-line 
treatment for mild PLE. Short-term symptomatic relief in patients with severe hypoalbuminemia may be attained with 25% 
albumin followed by furosemide for diuresis, although these 
effects cannot be maintained long term. Other medical options 
include use of subcutaneous heparin55 or systemic corticosteroids;56,57 these therapies have caused remission in specific 
cases, but an overall benefit has not been demonstrated in large 
cohorts, and significant side effects associated with each medication may limit their use. There have been anecdotal therapeutic successes with approaches involving dietary modifications with high-protein and high–medium-chain triglycerides, 
afterload reduction agents, inotropic agents, octreotide and 
prednisone.33,52
Surgical options for treating PLE include Fontan conversion in patients with an AP connection, fenestration creation, 
and cardiac transplantation. Cardiac transplantation is the only 
intervention that is a consistently proven “cure” of PLE, with 
very low rates of recurrence demonstrated post-transplant.58,59
Systemic Ventricular Dysfunction Physiologic changes 
affecting the systemic ventricle, as described before, frequently lead to HF, prompting management strategies to focus on 
correcting and preventing ventricular dysfunction. Prior studies have suggested that the systemic left ventricle (LV) tends 
to have better preserved function than the RV, with the hypothesis that the RV is not physiologically designed to pump 
against higher systemic pressures;60 however, this observation 
has not necessarily affected survival or ventricular function in 
the long-term.61
Effective medical therapy for ventricular dysfunction is well 
established for adult patients with HF in the absence of congenital heart disease (CHD), and is often applied to patients 
with SV physiology after extrapolation from adult HF data.62,63
Medications used in chronic HF, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and β-blockers, have theoretical 
benefits for patients with SV dysfunction, but there is only 
limited evidence in the literature to support this theory.21,63
Beta-blocking agents inhibit neurohumoral activation in 
chronic HF and when used in conjunction with ACE inhibition 
creased risk is secondary to a variety of factors, including low 
flow states and venous stasis because of the loss of pulsatile 
flow to the pulmonary circulation and atrial arrhythmias.39 The 
Fontan circulation also produces a hypercoagulable state because of deficiencies of protein C, protein S, and antithrombin 
III.33,40 Increased platelet reactivity has also been recognized in 
patients with SV physiology.41 Venous thrombi complicate the 
pulmonary circulation by obstructing the Fontan circuit, which 
may lead to hemodynamic instability and increased PVR in the 
case of emboli reaching the pulmonary vasculature (Figure 5). 
They may also embolize through graft fenestrations and into 
the systemic arterial system. Thrombi originating from the 
systemic circulation (SV, ligated PA stump, atria) may embolize to the central nervous system causing stroke, to the coronary arteries leading to myocardial ischemia, or to the systemic circulation leading to various embolic phenomena. In 
addition, as many as 13–19% of patients experience “silent” 
emboli, the clinical significance of which is not yet known.42
Consensus has not been reached on optimal medical management to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. Multiple 
studies have evaluated the use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents as prophylaxis against thromboembolic events without clear improvement in morbidity and mortality and without 
superiority of heparin or warfarin over aspirin.39,43 Current 
guidelines recommend either aspirin or therapeutic unfractionated heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists over no therapy.37,44 Treatment of confirmed thromboembolic events is recommended in accordance with established adult guidelines for 
the specific neurological event. 
Liver Disease Prevalence of liver disease, even in wellcompensated and asymptomatic Fontan patients, has not been 
well demonstrated, but seems to be more common than previously thought. The spectrum ranges from abnormal liver function tests and coagulation factors to fibrosis and even liver 
failure.45,46 Although the process of chronic liver injury is not 
completely understood, the mechanism is thought to be related 
to chronic hepatic congestion induced by the Fontan circulation, as well as pre-Fontan hypoxemic injury and during the 
multiple surgeries the patient undergoes early in life.47,48 Although most patients are asymptomatic, presenting complaints 
related to liver disease may include vague right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal swelling related to 
ascites. Because of its association with hepatic congestion, 
hemodynamic assessment is required in any patient with ongoing liver dysfunction.
Evaluation of liver tissue has shown histopathologic abnormalities across the board in Fontan patients, even preceding the 
actual Fontan operation.49 The most common finding is some 
degree of liver fibrosis, but cirrhosis as well as portal hypertension, hypervascular nodules, and rarely hepatocellular carcinoma.50 Given the increasing morbidity associated with liver 
disease, identifying it early with appropriate ongoing surveillance is becoming an increasingly applied goal of many congenital cardiologists. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard 
for evaluating fibrosis, its invasiveness and risk of significant 
complications make it a less desirable screening and surveillance tool. Imaging has been shown to accurately identify 
structural liver disease, but not necessarily the degree or severity, and laboratory evaluation of serum biomarkers has been 
shown to correlate with the degree of fibrosis in various types 
of liver disease.51 However, no studies to date have accurately 
correlated imaging and laboratory findings with histopathology 
from liver biopsy specimens. This will be an important area of 
future research in developing screening guidelines for liver 
disease in adult patients with Fontan palliation.

and often death.78 It seems plausible that plastic bronchitis in 
patients with Fontan physiology is similar to PLE, having a 
multifactorial pathogenesis with genetic factors, inflammation, 
and elevated systemic venous pressures all contributing to the 
pathogenesis and eventual outcome.
The incidence of plastic bronchitis remains low and an effective treatment strategy has not been established. A number 
of therapies have been tried with mixed success, including 
vasodilation with sildenafil or bosetan, destruction of casts 
with aerosolized fibrinolytics, cast expectoration with mucolytics, and immunosuppression with inhaled or systemic steroids.79 Similar to PLE, attempts to optimize Fontan hemodynamics with directed interventions, surgical Fontan revision, 
or cardiac transplantation may also be used to treat plastic 
bronchitis. 
Pregnancy As survival of Fontan patients improves, many 
women are reaching child-bearing age and becoming pregnant. During pregnancy, the cardiovascular system undergoes 
multiple physiologic changes, including doubling of intravascular volume and CO, and a decrease in SVR. These changes 
peak around the third trimester, primarily between 24 and 30 
weeks’ gestation. If a patient’s hemodynamics remain optimized, pregnancy and delivery are usually tolerated well. 
Nonetheless, the risks to both mother and fetus in this patient 
population are best assessed on an individual basis. 
The most commonly encountered complication of Fontan 
patients during pregnancy is atrial arrhythmias. Other notable 
morbidities include a decline in functional status, increased 
thromboembolic risk and an increased risk of HF. An increased 
rate of miscarriage has been observed as well.80,81 Such patients 
should be managed via a multidisciplinary approach that includes high-risk obstetric and anesthetic care, specialized adult 
congenital cardiology assessment with close follow-up, and 
genetic counseling.37
Fontan Failure The term “Fontan failure” is used to describe the constellation of complications described leading to 
late morbidity and mortality following the Fontan operation. 
Although this clinical picture was previously seen much earlier in cases of the AP Fontan, the introduction of the total 
cavopulmonary connection via the LT and EC conduit techniques has markedly improved outcomes.2,61,82 Fontan failure 
is characterized by a low CO state, markedly decreased exercise tolerance, and persistent and difficult to treat comorbidities such as recurrent tachyarrhythmias, edema, and PLE. It is 
historically resistant to medical therapy, although the use of 
medications may help bridge patients to a more definitive 
surgical solution.77
Fontan Revision Many adult Fontan patients who have 
survived into their third or fourth decades invariably undergo 
the AP connection. Many of these have benefited from Fontan 
revision, a surgical intervention that includes conversion of 
pulmonary venous return to total cavopulmonary anastomosis 
via a LT or an EC conduit, debulking of the dilated RA and 
removal of atrial thrombi, epicardial pacemaker placement, 
surgical cryoablation, atrial scar removal, and often a modified 
right atrial Maze procedure.2,33 Left-sided atrial Maze procedures are not routinely performed, primarily because of the 
long ischemic time.83,84 Perceived advantages of Fontan revision include a lower incidence of atrial arrhythmias and thrombosis related to atrial distension and improved hemodynamics.33 There has been improved exercise tolerance, improved 
NYHA class, decreased incidence of late arrhythmias and 
sinus node dysfunction and avoidance of thromboembolic risk 
associated with intracardiac prosthetic material.37,85–87
Mechanical Assist Devices and Cardiac Transplantation In 
can result in improved ventricular ejection fraction (EF), reduced symptoms and lower mortality.64 The use of carvedilol 
has been demonstrated to improve EF as well as NYHA class 
in patients with a Fontan, though further studies are required 
to determine if the long-term use of beta-blockers will be of 
benefit to the patient with failing Fontan physiology.65,66 Several studies have demonstrated elevated levels of antidiuretic 
hormone, aldosterone, renin, and angiotensin in patients with 
Fontan circulation, leading to salt and water retention.67 Diuretic therapy with loop diuretics and aldosterone antagonists 
has been described as commonly used to treat fluid overload 
related to ventricular dysfunction.68
There is a role for the use of intravenous inotropes postoperatively in pediatric patients with single ventricles, particularly phosphodiesterase inhibitors, which provide inotropy, 
lusiotropy, and vasodilatory properties that would appear beneficial to the failing Fontan patient.69 Chronic intravenous 
therapy with milrinone has been described, despite the absence 
of long-term supportive data in patients with failing Fontan 
physiology with ventricular dysfunction.70 Similarly, nesiritide, a recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide, is currently used 
with success in acute decompensated HF in adults;71 however, 
there is very limited experience in pediatric patients with acute 
HF, with no data on its use in chronic HF in adults with SV 
dysfunction. 
There are multiple studies that have repeatedly shown that 
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves measures 
of cardiac function and clinical status in adult patients with 
moderate-to-severe HF and a prolonged QRS interval.72,73 CRT 
reduce the degree of ventricular dyssynchrony (as evidenced 
by a shortened duration of the QRS interval), an increase in the 
left ventricular EF, a decrease in the LV end-diastolic dimension and in the magnitude of mitral regurgitation in patients 
with biventricular anatomy.72,74 CRT with multisite pacing was 
found to improve the myocardial performance in Fontan patients in acute postoperative settings; however, its role is unclear in chronic Fontan patients with progressive myocardial 
dysfunction.75
With improved medical therapies, late deaths have diminished dramatically from 25% early in the experience to 5% 
over the past decade.3 However, optimal medical management 
of the failing Fontan has generally been anecdotal and continues to vary widely among academic centers.21
Hypoxemia/Shunts Fontan patients are mildly hypoxemic 
with oxygen saturations in the low 90s, even after full repair 
and closure of atrial level shunts.76 This slight desaturation is 
secondary to coronary sinus drainage into the LA, pulmonary 
arteriovenous malformations, and venovenous collaterals that 
drain to the pulmonary veins or directly to the LA.77 More 
significant desaturation may be attributable to surgically created fenestration or baffle leaks. These shunts may be identified via catheterization techniques or echocardiography and 
managed with transcatheter device therapy as indicated. Other 
causes include pulmonary pathology that includes a restrictive 
respiratory function pattern, hepatic venous connection to the 
coronary sinus or LA, right-to-left interatrial shunting via 
small thebesian veins, and diaphragmatic paresis.33
Plastic Bronchitis A very rare but serious complication of 
the Fontan circulation is plastic bronchitis, the formation of 
mucoid bronchial casts caused by leakage of lymphatic fluid 
into the airway mucosa. Casts vary in size from small plugs that 
can be expectorated to large branching structures that fill the 
tracheobronchial tree. Depending on the extent of cast formation, patients may present with symptoms ranging from a productive cough and mild dyspnea to respiratory distress, failure

patients with complex failing Fontan physiology are only growing in numbers, with cardiac transplantation being the only 
successful long term definitive palliation in such patients.

spite of surgical advances that have led to markedly improved 
morbidity and mortality among Fontan recipients, there remains an almost inevitable late decline of the Fontan circulation. When medical therapy and other surgical interventions 
fail, cardiac transplantation has become an increasingly utilized and successful solution for the failing Fontan.88 Cardiac 
transplantation provides an option for treating these patients; 
however, the indications for, timing of, and outcomes after 
transplantation remain undefined. 
Survival following orthotopic heart transplant in patients 
with the Fontan diagnosis is significantly lower than that of 
patients without CHD, as well as non-Fontan patients with 
CHD, although recent survival has improved as reported from 
a single institution.59,89–91 The highest risk for mortality appears to be in patients who are transplanted because of early 
Fontan failure, with much better outcomes observed in patients 
with late Fontan failure.92
Increased survival in the recent era of cardiac transplantation 
in patients with CHD has been attributed to improved patient 
selection, as well as advances in critical care management.93
Fontan failure in the absence of ventricular dysfunction, mechanical ventilation at time of transplant, and listing for transplant soon after the Fontan operation appear to predict worse 
outcomes and higher mortality post-transplant.94,95
Though transplantation remains the standard of care to improve survival and quality of life when conventional medical 
and surgical therapies have failed, it remains limited by the 
scarcity and unpredictability of donor organ availability. As 
such, the use of ventricular assist devices (VADs) as a bridge 
to transplant is gaining popularity.96 Recent advances in pulmonary vasodilators and implantable devices (eg, axial flow 
blood pumps) may have a major effect on future transplantation indications in patients with failing univentricular physiology.97 Based on data from the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study 
(PHTS) and Cardiac Transplant Research Database, the most 
common cardiac lesion from 6 months of age to adulthood 
necessitating a cardiac transplant is SV anatomy. However, it 
has been a disappointing endeavor, with only 50% survival 
when compared to overall pediatric and adult VAD survival of 
70–86%.98 The approach of VADs as destination therapy is 
expanding in adults with CHD who have end-stage HF, though 
it remains reserved for patients with significant comorbidities 
or other obstacles precluding transplantation. 
Conclusions
The Fontan operation is the repair of choice for patients with 
a variety of congenital heart lesions with a functional SV. Suitable patient selection and selection of the appropriate surgical 
modification are crucial for ensuring the best long-term outcome. It remains a palliative, complicated operation with a 
high incidence of long-term complications. Despite proper 
selection criteria, PLE, arrhythmias, thromboembolic concerns, liver dysfunction and ventricular failure lead to therapeutic and management challenges. Despite careful long-term 
follow-up, there remains continual but late attrition of patients 
from long-term complications. Management of these patients 
includes a detailed assessment to treat any correctable lesions, 
management of arrhythmias, treatment for PLE and plastic 
bronchitis, manipulation of systemic and pulmonary vascular 
resistances and Fontan conversion of the less favorable AP 
connection to an EC or LT cavopulmonary connection together with arrhythmia surgery. There is a growing role of 
VADs in adults with end-stage HF with complex CHD, although its primary purpose is reserved for cases of significant
