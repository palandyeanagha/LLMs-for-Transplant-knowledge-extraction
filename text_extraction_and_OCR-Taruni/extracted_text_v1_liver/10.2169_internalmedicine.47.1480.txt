Abstract
Primary infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV) commonly occurs subclinically or manifested by a selflimited mononucleosis-like syndrome in immunocompetent subjects. Severe clinical pictures are uncommon.
We present a case of acute myopericarditis and hepatitis in a previously healthy 32-year-old man with primary CMV infection, assessed by serology and positive pp65 antigenemia. He was successfully treated with
a course of oral valganciclovir therapy, with an immediate clinical response and normalization of laboratory
tests. The literature on simultaneous presentation of CMV pericarditis and hepatitis in immunocompetent
hosts, as well as the role of oral valganciclovir in this clinical setting, is reviewed.

Introduction
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is endemic around the
globe, with notable differences in the seroprevalence according to geographical region and socioeconomic status. Acquisition of the virus (via saliva, sexual contact, breastfeeding,
placental transfer, blood transfusion or transplantation) arises
gradually from an early age; overall seroprevalence varies
from 40% to 70% of the adult population in developed regions, and it may exceed 90% in specific groups (homosexual subjects) or developing countries (1). Primary CMV infection presents as a symptomatic event in less than 10% of
immunocompetent people (1, 2). However, a wide range of
presentations have been described in this population, ranging
from mononucleosis-like syndrome, to uncommonly severe
clinical pictures with multivisceral involvement (such as interstitial pneumonitis, hepatitis, hematologic disorders, or
meningoencephalitis), and it is often associated with significant mortality (2, 3). Cardiovascular complications constitute
a very unusual manifestation of CMV infection, with a few
cases reported to date in the literature (4-8). Herein, we describe a previously healthy patient who developed acute
myopericarditis and hepatitis following primary CMV infection; he responded favourably to a 14-day course of oral
valganciclovir.
Case Report
A 32-year-old man presented to the emergency department of a primary care hospital with pleuritic chest pain
which radiated to the shoulders lasting for about 48 hours.
The patient was a non-smoker with no relevant past medical
history; he denied any previous trauma, recent alcohol consumption, or illicit drug abuse. He had never received blood
products. A diagnosis of acute myopericarditis was estab１Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital “12 de Octubre”, Madrid, Spain, ２Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital

lished on the basis of clinical history, presence of pericardial
friction rub on physical examination, and moderate elevation
of myocardial necrosis markers; symptomatic treatment with
salicylic acid was subsequently initiated. Nevertheless, the
patient referred himself to our institution five days later because of persistence of symptoms. He also complained of
asthenia, cephalea, myalgias and difusse arthralgias. Recent
drug history did not include exposure to β-lactam antibiotics. On admission his blood pressure was 105/66 mmHg,
pulse rate 62 beats per minute, respiratory rate 21 breaths
per minute, and temperature 36.6℃. The physical examination was unremarkable except for a three-component pericardial friction rub on thoracic auscultation, accompanied by a
single, subcentimetric, asymptomatic right cervical lymphadenopathy. Neither rash nor splenomegaly was detected.
Routine serum testing revealed relative lymphocytosis of
over 50.0% (white blood cell count, 5.67×109
/L; lymphocyte count, 2.83×109
/L), associated to a moderate elevation
of serum cardiac troponin T (0.23 ng/mL; cutoff value, <
0.04); other laboratory investigations, including liver function tests, initially remained within normal values. Laboratory data on admission at our institution are summarized in
Table 1. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus
rhythm with incomplete right bundle-branch block, similar
to previous studies. Chest X-ray was normal. Over the following 96 hours the serum myocardial enzyme levels continued to rise to a maximum of 0.53 ng/mL for troponin T
(Table 1). Diagnosis of acute myopericarditis was confirmed
as assessed by the association of clinical history with both
auscultatory and laboratory findings. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treatment with high doses of salicylic
acid was continued. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram revealed
normal left ventricle function with no findings suggestive of
pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade. In the course of
the following days, the patient’s general condition deteriorated with nausea, vomiting, right hypochondralgia, and
marked asthenia. Liver function tests showed: aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), 678 IU/L (normal range, 5-45);
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1,178 IU/L (normal range,
5-45); gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), 112 IU/L
(normal range, 3-52); lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), 498 IU/L
(normal range, 90-230); and prothrombin activity, 48% (normal range, 80-120 %). Total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,
and creatinine levels, were within normal limits. There was
no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal ultrasonography showed no relevant findings. An extensive serological screening was performed with the aim to identify
any possible viral cause of hepatitis: hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B core antigen immunoglobulin (Ig) M
and IgG, hepatitis C virus IgG, hepatitis A virus IgM and
IgG, Toxoplasma gondii IgM, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and -2 total IgG, and Epstein-Barr anti-capsid
viral antigen (VCA) IgM, were all negative. We ruled out
other potential causes of acute hepatitis, including druginduced or autoimmune hepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease, or α1-antitrypsin deficiency. CMVspecific IgM titer (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)
was strongly positive (96.3), associated with undetectable
CMV IgG values (<0.5); pp65 antigenemia (by immunofluorescent assay in peripheral blood leukocytes) was also performed, showing more than 10 positive cells per 2×105 leukocytes. The patient was diagnosed with acute myopericarditis and hepatitis due to primary CMV infection. In view
of his stable clinical condition, we started specific antiviral
treatment with oral valganciclovir (900 mg q 12 hours for 2
weeks) in association with oral salicylic acid (1.8 g q 8
hours). In the subsequent days the patient’s general condition showed an obvious clinical improvement, with rapid

resolution of asthenia, nausea and hypochondralgia. The
pericardial friction rub disappeared within one week after
starting the treatment. Progressive normalization of both
liver function indices and serum myocardial enzymes following valganciclovir introduction is shown in Fig. 1. The
patient underwent a second echocardiographic examination
previous to discharge, with no evidence of clinically relevant
myocardial or pericardial disease. CMV antigenemia assay
became negative within 14 days of treatment. Four months
after discharge, he remains asymptomatic without evidence
of recurrent pericardial or liver disease. All laboratory values
are within normal ranges (ALT, 37 IU/L; AST, 25 IU/L;
GGT, 17 IU/L; CK, 64 IU/L; troponin T, <0.04 ng/mL), and
convalescent CMV IgG titer rose from 0.49 to 9.10.
Discussion
In most of the immunocompetent adults, primary CMV
infection constitutes an asymptomatic episode or typically
runs a self-limited, mononucleosis-like clinical picture (1).
The potential role of CMV, either via reactivation of latent
infection or via primary acquisition, may be considered into
the differential diagnosis of prolonged, unexplained, relapsing febrile syndrome associated with diverse non-specific
symptoms (such as asthenia, arthralgia, or sweating) (2, 3).
Evidence of cardiovascular events, mainly acute pericarditis
or myopericarditis, following CMV infection has been rarely
reported in immunocompetent hosts without any identifiable
risk factor (4-9). However, it has been suggested that this
association may remain underdiagnosed due to its usually
non-severe evolution (5). Most of the previous reports have
dealt with CMV pericarditis as an incidental electrocardiographic finding during the course of a typical
mononucleosis-like syndrome (3, 7). However, severe complications associated with acute myopericarditis, such as
hemodynamically significant cardiac tamponade or acute
heart failure, have been reported in this setting (4, 6, 8). In a
series of 115 hospitalized non-immunocompromised adults
with proved or presumed diagnosis of primary CMV infection, Bonnet et al included only two cases of pericarditis
(1.7% of the entire cohort), diagnosed as a fortuitous finding
during routine echocardiogram (3). In a prospective clinical
trial of subxiphoid pericardial biopsy in 57 adults with large
pericardial effusions, Campbell et al found five patients with
CMV pericardial disease (four of them with CMV cultureproven diagnosis in pericardium or pericardial fluid, and one
case diagnosed retrospectively by serologic testing) (8). Predisposing factors for the development of CMV infection
were present in three of the five cases (rheumatoid arthritis
treated with prednisone, chronic renal failure, and congenital
heart disease, respectively).
Liver function test abnormalities are frequently reported
in immunocompetent adults with clinically relevant primary
CMV infection, occurring in up to 90% of cases (1, 3). Subclinical, mild to moderate elevation of circulating level of
transaminases, that rarely exceeds 5-fold above normal, constitutes the most frequently observed laboratory alteration,
affecting alanine aminotransferase more than aspartate
aminotransferase (3, 9). Increases in alkaline phosphatase or
total bilirubin levels are uncommon. These findings are usually self-limited, with progressive normalization of transaminase levels after a few weeks (1, 3). However, unusual
clinical patterns with severe cholestatic course, granulomatous hepatitis, or acute hepatocellular failure, have been
rarely described (10, 11).
The data regarding the need for specific antiviral therapy
in non-immunocompromised subjects with severe CMV infection, are rather conflicting (3, 9). The clinical improveFigure 1. Clinical and laboratory evolution and effect of valganciclovir therapy.

ment observed in some uncontrolled case reports may be related to the usually self-limiting course of the disease; however, some authors have advocated a relatively short course
of parenteral ganciclovir in order to reduce the symptomatic
phase of the infection (11, 12). Although the role of oral
valganciclovir in the management of CMV disease in highrisk seropositive transplant patients has been well established (13), its usefulness in non-immunocompromised subjects remains unclear. No definitive conclusions can be
drawn about the indication of such therapy from the few experiences reported in this clinical setting (14, 15). In the
present patient, the progressive character of liver function
deterioration associated with mild coagulopathy, with normal
bilirubin levels and no signs of encephalopathy, prompted us
to introduce specific treatment with valganciclovir. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first case of CMV myopericarditis and hepatitis successfully treated with oral valganciclovir in an immunocompetent host. However, any presumed benefit derived from specific antiviral therapy must
be weighed against its potential toxicity and the risk of selection of resistant viral strains after long-term courses of
treatment (3).
A review of the English language literature revealed only
three previous, well documented cases reporting simultaneous acute myopericarditis and hepatitis associated to primary CMV infection in an immunocompetent subject (5, 9,
10). Remarkably, no predisposing factors resulting in increased susceptibility to CMV disease were present in the
present patient. In conclusion, the possibility of primary
CMV implication should be considered in cases of simultaneous development of acute myopericarditis and hepatitis,
even in the absence of apparent risk factors for immunosuppression. The present case illustrates that oral treatment with
oral valganciclovir may be beneficial in such patients. However, more clinical experience is necessary to evaluate the
potential role of this specific antiviral therapy in this setting.
