Abstract
Background: Lenvatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with novel binding ability. It is considered the standard of
care for metastatic thyroid cancer; moreover, whether it is indicated for other malignant tumors has been
examined. Lenvatinib increases the risk of kidney injury in some patients. In comparison with sorafenib, which is a
conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), lenvatinib results in more side effects, including hypertension and
proteinuria. We describe a case of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) that developed following
treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer with lenvatinib and reviewed the mechanisms of renal impairment.
Case presentation: We describe a patient with metastatic thyroid cancer who developed hypertension, nephrotic
syndrome, and acute kidney injury after 3 months of lenvatinib treatment. Renal biopsy results revealed that 7 of 16
glomeruli indicated complete hyalinization, and that the glomeruli with incomplete hyalinization showed FSGS due to
a vascular endothelial disorder and podocyte damage, which seemed to have been induced by lenvatinib treatment.
These findings were similar to those of renal impairment treated with conventional TKIs. Although lenvatinib treatment
was discontinued, up to 15 months were required to achieve remission of proteinuria, thus leading to chronic kidney
disease with hyalinized lesions.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of secondary FSGS by lenvatinib treatment.
Renal impairment treated with TKIs is commonly associated with minimal change nephrotic syndrome/FSGS findings,
and it is suggested that renal involvement with TKI is different from that with the vascular endothelial growth factor
ligand. Overexpression of c-mip due to TKI causes disorders such as podocyte dysregulation and promotion of
apoptosis, which cause FSGS. Lenvatinib may result in FSGS by a similar mechanism with another TKI and could cause
irreversible renal impairment; therefore caution must be used. It is essential to monitor blood pressure, urinary findings,
and the renal function.

Background
Lenvatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with novel
binding ability and selective inhibition against receptor-type
tyrosine kinase involved in tumor angiogenesis and malignant tumor transformation [1–3]. The target molecules of
lenvatinib are vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) receptors (VEGFRs) 1–3, fibroblast growth
factor receptors (FGFR)1–4, platelet-derived factor
receptor-α (PDGFRα), RET (rearranged during transfection), and KIT proto-oncogenes [1–3]. Because lenvatinib has greater inhibitory activity against VEGFRs
and inhibits FGFR more than other VEGF inhibitors
[1–3], it is expected to have therapeutic effects on patients who have developed resistance to other VEGF
inhibitors [4]. Moreover, whether lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of various malignant tumors
has been examined [5]. For thyroid cancer, neovascularization is necessary for tumor growth and

metastasis. Because the expression of angiogenesis
factors, such as VEGF, tyrosine kinase receptors are
enhanced [6]. Therefore, it is expected that tumor
regression can be achieved by using tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) such as lenvatinib, sorafenib, and
sunitinib.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be classified as type I to
type V according to the binding site of the target kinase
and the conformation of kinases on inhibitor binding.
Most TKIs are type I or type II. An analysis of the
co-crystal structure using X-rays revealed that lenvatinib
has a novel ability to bind to VEGFR2 (type V). A kinetic
analysis demonstrated that lenvatinib binds to the target
molecule immediately and strongly inhibits kinases, and
it has been speculated that its novel binding ability may
contribute to these actions [7].
In Japan, lenvatinib was recently approved as a therapeutic drug for the treatment of unresectable thyroid
cancer [4]. In 2018, it was realized that this drug was indicated for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma [8].
Lenvatinib is considered the standard of care for metastatic thyroid cancer because of its inhibitory effectiveness and because it does not require dose adjustments
based on renal function or therapeutic drug monitoring
(TDM) [9].
Lenvatinib is a TKI with novel binding ability; however,
it is associated with more side effects, including hypertension and proteinuria, compared with sorafenib, which
targets VEGFRs 1–3, RET, RAF, and PDGFRβ; in
addition, lenvatinib has been associated with acute kidney injury in some patients [4, 10, 11]. Renal impairment
caused by conventional TKIs commonly involves minimal change nephrotic syndrome/focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)-like lesions, which are caused by
impaired podocytes [12].
We describe a case of secondary FSGS that developed
following treatment of metastatic thyroid cancer with
lenvatinib. We also discuss the possible pathomechanisms by which lenvatinib likely induced glomerular
damage.
Case presentation
A 79-year-old woman initially presented with diabetes in
2008. Her HbA1c level was 8.8%, and treatment with an
oral hypoglycemic agent was initiated. At that time, the
patient also reported swelling on the anterior surface of
her neck in the area of the thyroid gland; therefore, she
sought consultation at an ambulatory otolaryngology
clinic. She was diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastasis to the right cervical lymph nodes.
In 2011, a pulmonary tumor was detected; it was
resected via thoracoscopy and a diagnosis of metastatic
thyroid cancer was confirmed. In December 2012, her
serum creatinine level was 0.57 mg/dL, with no evidence
of proteinuria. In 2013, the patient underwent resection
of the right lobe of the thyroid gland, including bilateral
dissection of the paratracheal lymph nodes and the right
parotid lymph node.
In January 2016, the patient experienced exacerbation
of her unresectable thyroid cancer; therefore, oral administration of 10 mg lenvatinib was initiated.
The findings of the pretreatment laboratory assessment were as follows: normal blood pressure (118–132/
64–77 mmHg); creatinine (Cr), 0 .72 mg/dL; and albumin (Alb), 3.8 g/dL, respectively, and her estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 58 mL/min/
1.73 m2
. In addition, the urine sample test showed negative results for red blood cells (1–4/HPF), and the urine
qualitative analysis showed negative results for protein.
However, after initiation of treatment (Fig. 1), the patient
developed hypertension that required treatment with
candesartan (8 mg/day). By February 2016, her Cr level
had increased to 0.82 mg/dL, and her eGFR and Alb
levels had decreased to 51 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 3.5 g/
dL, respectively. She also developed hypertension (blood
pressure, 140–170/60–70 mmHg). Based on these findings, we added a daily dose of amlodipine (5 mg/day) to
her treatment; thereafter, the dose was increased to
10 mg/day. By March 2016, her Cr level continued to increase to 0.84 mg/dL, and her eGFR and Alb level continued to decrease (49 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 3.0 g/dL,
respectively). Her blood pressure increased to 150/
60 mmHg, and the candesartan dose was increased to
12 mg/day. However, she developed lower limb edema.
In April 2016, she was diagnosed with acute kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome. Development of generalized edema and weight gain were noted, her Cr level
increased to 1.17 mg/dL, and her eGFR decreased to
34 mL/min/1.73 m2
. Measurements of other relevant parameters were as follows: total protein (TP), 5.1 mg/dL;
Alb, 2.5 mg/dL; total creatinine (TC), 329 mg/dL;
low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 204 mg/dL; and urinary
protein, 11.78 g/gCr. The patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation and treatment.
Clinical presentation on admission
On admission, the patient’s medications included lenvatinib (10 mg), glimepiride (0.5 mg), pioglitazone
(915 mg), alogliptin (925 mg), candesartan (12 mg), and
amlodipine (10 mg). On physical examination, her height
was 155 cm, weight was 55 kg (usual weight, 44 kg),
body mass index was 21.4 kg/m2
, blood pressure was
142/60 mmHg, heart rate was 72 beats/min, temperature
was 36.2 °C, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min. A
surgical scar from her thyroidectomy was visible on the
anterior aspect of her neck. In addition, bilateral edema
of her lower limbs was evident. Significant medical history included a uterine myoma, appendicitis, and a
Furuto et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:273 Page 2 of 9

fundal hemorrhage due to diabetic retinopathy at the
ages of 50, 51, and 77 years, respectively. Her family history was negative, and she had no known allergies. The
patient was a non-smoker and only consumed alcohol
socially. Her urine and blood laboratory data are
summarized in Table 1. Large quantities of urine protein
and urine occult bleeding, anemia, renal function disorder, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia were
observed. Urinary Bence-Jones proteins, increased ferritin, hypergammopathy, low-complement blood symptoms, and ANCA and ds-DNA antibodies were not
observed, however.

and serum albumin decreased. The lower section shows urinalysis results. Before lenvatinib administration, urinalysis results were normal. After
lenvatinib administration, the urine quantitative analysis revealed the presence of red blood cells (20–29/HPF) and proteinuria (3+)

Multiple pulmonary metastases were observable on
computed tomography (CT) imaging. Although there was
no evidence of malformation of the kidneys, generalized
edema and thoraco-abdominal fluid were observed.
Treatment course
Considering the development of elevated blood pressure
and nephrotic syndrome after administration of lenvatinib, drug-induced nephrotic syndrome was suspected as
the primary clinical diagnosis. Therefore, lenvatinib
treatment was discontinued.
The patient’s diabetes was controlled well with the use
of oral hypoglycemic agents (HbA1c of 5.7%). However,
her blood pressure remained high at 140–145/50–
60 mmHg despite treatment with oral antihypertensive
agents. Because of her history of diabetic retinal
hemorrhage, papillary thyroid carcinoma with relatively
new onset of distant metastasis, hematuria, low selectivity index (0.247), information based on the negative findings of hypocomplementemia, absence of MPO-ANCA,
PR3-ANCA, ds-DNA antibodies, we thought that minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and rapidly
progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) would not be
correct diagnoses.
Because it is necessary to differentiate FSGS from
diabetes nephrosis syndrome and secondary membranous nephropathy due to a malignant tumor, and because most TKIs are type I or type II and lenvatinib
has novel binding ability (type V), we performed a
renal biopsy.
Renal biopsy using light microscopy (Fig. 2a-d) revealed that 7 of 16 glomeruli had complete hyalinization,
and that glomeruli with incomplete hyalinization showed
partial glomerular collapse (arrow in Fig. 2b); FSGS was
confirmed because the glomeruli showed lobular and
segmental expansion. Vacuolar degeneration of the
podocytes (see arrow in Fig. 2a) and enlarged endothelial
cells with a thickened loop were evident, suggesting
endothelial injury (arrow head in Fig. 2a). Thrombotic
microangiopathy was absent. The mesangial matrix
slightly increased, but the mesangial cells did not increase (Fig. 2b, c). Periodic acid methenamine silver
(PAM) staining showed mesangial interposition-like
changes and a duplicated basal membrane (arrow head
in Fig. 2d). The endarterium was slightly thickened and
the arterioles showed partial hyaline consolidation.
Immunofluorescence (Fig. 3) of the IgG showed nonspecific staining, no linear pattern, and negative results.
Only IgA, IgM, C3, and C4 were granular and slightly

indicated complete hyalinization, and the glomeruli with incomplete hyalinization showed partial glomerular collapse (arrow in b). The diagnosis was
FSGS because the glomeruli showed lobular and segmental expansion. Vacuolar degeneration of podocytes (arrow in a) and enlarged endothelial cells
with a thickened loop were observed, suggesting endothelial injury (arrow head in a). Thrombotic microangiopathy was absent. The mesangial matrix
slightly increased, but the number of mesangial cells did not increase (b, c). Periodic acid methenamine silver (PAM) staining showed mesangial
interposition-like changes and a duplicated basal membrane (arrow head in d). The endarterium is slightly thickened and the arterioles show partial

positive in the mesangial areas, and there was no staining of the loop wall. C1q was negative.
Vacuolar degeneration of podocytes (arrow in Fig. 4a)
was observed on electron microscopy (Fig. 4a, b). The
loops were thickened and a duplicated basal membrane
was observed. Mesangial interposition-like changes were
found (arrow in Fig. 4b), and endothelial cells invaded
the basal membrane (arrow head in Fig. 4b).
Electron-dense deposits suggesting immune complexes
were not observed. Foot process effacement was almost
60–70%. It suggested that this is a case of podocytopathy
and not a secondary effect of hypertensive/hyperfiltration injury.
The mesangial matrix slightly increased, but there was no
nodular glomerulosclerosis such as a Kimmelstiel-Wilson
lesion or IgG immunofluorescence staining with a linear
pattern along the basement membrane, thereby suggesting
that the diagnosis was not advanced stage disease that
could lead to diabetes nephrosis syndrome. The glomeruli
showed lobular expansion, but mesangial cells were not increased and an electron-dense deposit was not observed;
therefore, the diagnosis was not MPGN.
With regard to morphologic variants of FSGS based
on the Columbia classification, the collapsing variant of
FSGS is diagnosed because of the presence of collapsed
glomeruli.
Treatment included the discontinuation of lenvatinib,
dietary modifications, and the use of palliative diuretics.
The patient’s weight decreased over the course of the
subsequent 2 weeks (loss of 8.7 kg from admission
weight) but showed improvement in the edema of her
lower limbs. Glycemic control was achieved. Because
nephrotic syndrome was improved after discontinuation
of lenvatinib therapy, and because diabetic changes in
the kidneys including increased thickness of the mesangial matrix were mild, we confirmed a diagnosis of secondary FSGS caused by lenvatinib.
The patient was discharged on day 11 after admission.
Although her renal function status did not improve from
that on admission (Cr, 1.16 mg/dL; eGFR, 35 mL/min/
1.73 m2
) to that at discharge (Cr, 1.17 mg/dL; eGFR,

), her proteinuria did improve from
11.8 g/day on admission to 5.4 g/day at discharge. She
was followed-up on an outpatient basis, and her proteinuria continued to gradually decrease over time. In July
2017, her Cr level was 1.04 mg/dL and eGFR was
39 mL/min/1.73 m2
, with complete remission of urinary
protein (qualitative urinary protein, 116 mg/gCr) and no
evidence of hematuria. A period of 15 months was required to achieve complete remission after discontinuation of lenvatinib treatment. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD; stage G3bA1) was diagnosed. Regular follow-up
examinations are performed at our outpatient clinic.
Discussion and conclusions
This is the first report of renal histopathological findings
associated with secondary FSGS due to a vascular endothelial disorder and podocyte damage induced by lenvatinib treatment. Nephrotic syndrome developed at
approximately 3 months following initiation of lenvatinib
treatment for metastatic thyroid cancer in our patient.
The development of lesions with complete hyalinization
caused irreversible renal failure.
Results of the international cooperative phase III trials
[4, 13, 14] identified the following adverse side effects as
risk factors for lenvatinib treatment: hypertension (incidence rate, 67.8%); urinary protein (32.6%); hematuria
(5%); and nephrotic syndrome (0.4%; a single case). Of
these, hypertension (10%) and urinary protein (10%)
were included in the main toxicity criteria with a grade ≥
3. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider that dose
adjustment might be necessary to lower the risk of toxicity [9, 14].
The period between initiation of lenvatinib treatment
and the advent of renal impairment was 43 (range, 5–
799) days, with a mean of 43 (range, 13–560) days in
Japan [4, 13–15].
Side effects of lenvatinib can be observed at any time
following lenvatinib initiation [12], and these side effects
are caused by the effects of lenvatinib on VEGF inhibition
[4, 13–15]. There might be an opportunity to perform
dose modification to lower the risk of these renal events;
however, it takes an average of 8.8 weeks to resolve proteinuria after dose modification of lenvatinib [14].
Effects of VEGF inhibition on blood pressure should
be considered. VEGF regulates blood pressure through
its effect on vascular tone; specifically, VEGF inhibitors
suppress nitric oxide (NO) and phospholipase A2 activation, which decrease the production of prostacyclin
(PGI2) and increase the release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) as
a vasoexcitor, thus causing vasoconstriction. Oxidative
stress due to VEGF inhibition results in endothelial cell
injury, a decrease in microvessel network density, and
increased vascular resistance. Furthermore, the reduction of NO leads to increased vascular volume via
reabsorption of sodium. Increased vascular resistance
and increased vascular volume due to these mechanisms
result in hypertension [15–17].
The use of VEGF inhibitors is also associated with the
risk of proteinuria, and the prevalence of hypertension is
higher among patients with proteinuria [18]. It has been
proposed that proteinuria develops due to VEGF
inhibition-derived changes in glomerular architecture
and impairments in filtration function [19].
VEGF is produced by podocytes and binds to VEGFR2,
which is expressed by endothelial cells [20]. The interactions of podocyte VEGF and glomerular VEGFR regulate
endothelial function and glomerular vascular permeability [21, 22]. This impairs the regulation of the tight junction, allowing an increased passage of protein that
impairs normal glomerular function [19, 21, 23, 24]. The
risk of proteinuria due to the use of VEGF inhibitors has
been reported to be higher among Asian populations
[25]. In our case study, renal biopsy findings were indicative of secondary FSGS resulting from damage to the
vascular endothelium and podocytes. The development
of nephrotic syndrome secondary to the use of VEGF inhibitors has been reported [21, 26, 27]. Furthermore, a
case report described the development of thrombotic
microangiopathy that resulted in nephrotic syndrome
and secondary FSGS, similar to our case, in a patient
treated with the TKI sunitinib [27].
Although the cause of FSGS associated with the use of
VEGF inhibitors has not been clearly determined, it is
known that vascular endothelial damage occurs locally
at the site of podocyte loss [28–30]. FSGS is also a typical glomerular change among patients with eclampsia
who develop nephrotic syndrome [31]. In this clinical
population, the placenta promotes the expression and
secretion of soluble feline McDonough sarcoma virus
(fms)-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt1) that inhibits the bioactivity of VEGF, which is considered the cause of vascular endothelial damage. Because VEGF inhibitors or
adenoviruses that express sFlt1 are associated with the
onset of eclampsia, there may be an association between
VEGF inhibition and the process of vascular endothelial
damage resulting in FSGS [21, 32].
Among patients treated with bevacizumab as a VEGF
ligand and sunitinib as a TKI, the following renal pathologies have been reported: FSGS [17, 27, 33]; thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) [17, 21, 27, 34, 35];
crescentic glomerulonephritis [17, 36]; minimal change
nephropathy [17, 37]: tubulointerstitial nephritis or
tubular necrosis [17, 37–39]; cryoglobulin-related glomerulonephritis [40]; glomerular collapse [41]; proliferative immune-complex glomerulonephritis [42, 43]; and
TMA and IgA deposits with glomerular collapse [32].
Currently, it is not clear whether the changes in renal
structure and function might be reversible. In patients
Furuto et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:273 Page 6 of 9

with anti-VEGF-induced TMA, FSGS and MCNS, podocytes are mostly depleted with VEGFs [12]. VEGF inhibition is believed to be the underlying mechanism leading
to the development of podocyte and endothelial cell
damage [17, 25, 34].
VEGF ligands (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) target
VEGFRs 1, 2, and 3, whereas TKIs interfere with the activity of VEGFR and other growth factor receptors, such
as PDGF receptors, stem cell factors, FMS-like tyrosine
kinase-3, b-raf, and Bcl-Abl. Therefore, they are commonly called multitargeted TKIs [32].
Patients receiving receptor TKIs mainly develop MCNS/
FSGS-like lesions, whereas TMA complicates VEGF ligand
therapy [12, 44]. Therefore, it is suggested that renal impairment can be classified into two types of VEGF-targeted
therapy. It is also suggested that the renal involvement of
TKI is different from that of VEGF ligands.
With TMA, c-mip was not detected, and an abundance of RelA, which is part of the NK-κB family, was
observed. However, in MCNS/FSGS-like cases, an abundance of c-mip was observed and a few RelA were
detected.
TKIs inhibit RelA activity and promote c-mip expression [12]. Similarly, in TMA, KI-67 was not observed
and a normal amount of synaptopodin-like control was
confirmed. In MCNS/collapsing FSGS cases, an abundance of KI-67 was found and no synaptopodin was detected. More often, podocytopathies are secondary to
TKIs than to VEGF ligands [44]. Furthermore, the finding that the TKI sorafenib induces impressive cytoskeleton changes in cultured podocytes suggests that this
class of therapy has direct effects on podocytes [12].
Uncontrolled NF-κB has an important pathophysiologic role in impaired podocytes. Inhibition of NK-κB activity by TKIs leads to overexpression of c-mip [45].
Additionally, it has been reported that overexpression of
c-mip causes impaired podocytes, such as podocyte
dysregulation and the promotion of apoptosis leading to
MCNS/FSGS, resulting in progressive FSGS [46–48].
Histologic findings of our case have implied that FSGS
due to lenvatinib is associated with these mechanisms.
To the best of our knowledge, kidney biopsy results of
patients with renal dysfunction due to the use of lenvatinib have not been previously reported despite previous reports of secondary hypertension, proteinuria, and acute
nephrotic syndrome. Based on the current evidence, patients treated with TKIs, including lenvatinib, should
undergo blood pressure and urinary protein screening for
early detection of hypertension and, as needed, aggressive
administration of antihypertensive agents. Regarding
hypertension treatment, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have
been shown to be effective for lowering the risk of vascular endothelial damage through their effects on expanding
efferent arterioles, reducing glomerular pressure, and
decreasing proteinuria via the intercellular spaces of the
glomerular podocytes. Therefore, blood pressure control
using these antihypertensive agents is important. Moreover, lowering the dose of TKIs, or their withdrawal and
discontinuation, should be considered for patients who
develop uncontrolled hypertension or other side effects
[14]. Depending on the clinical symptoms and severity of
glomerular disease, the following schedule of lenvatinib
withdrawal is suggested: 20, 14, 10, 8, or 4 mg once per
day [9].
The criteria for withdrawal, reduction, and discontinuation of lenvatinib are summarized in Table 2 [9]. The
package insert for lenvatinib recommends reduction or
withdrawal of the drug for patients who develop proteinuria because the incidence of proteinuria is considered
dose-related and variable for different VEGF inhibitors
[49–51]. Age is also a risk factor for renal damage secondary to the use of VEGF inhibitors, with higher risk
found among elderly patients [52].

The 2016 clinical practice guidelines for the management of kidney disease among cancer survivors [53] recommend that clinicians should individually evaluate the
advantages and disadvantages of continuing the administration of VEGF inhibitors for patients who develop proteinuria and have practical treatment options for drug
reduction or withdrawal while considering the patient’s
requests. Although it is generally considered that renal
damage secondary to lenvatinib treatment can be ameliorated with drug withdrawal, our findings indicated
that lenvatinib can cause intractable and irreversible
renal damage.
In conclusion, we report, for the first time, a case of
lenvatinib-induced FSGS that resulted in irreversible renal
damage. Lenvatinib is an antineoplastic agent used to treat
thyroid cancer due to its inhibitory effects on several tyrosine kinases involved in tumor vascularization and growth.
However, lenvatinib increases the risk of hypertension and
proteinuria, which can result in nephrotic syndrome and
acute renal damage. Our patient’s renal biopsy results confirmed the presence of FSGS caused by vascular endothelial disorder and podocyte damage due to TKI, which
resulted in the development of complete hyalinization lesions and led to chronic kidney disease. Lenvatinib is a
TKI with novel binding ability, but its renal damage mechanism seems to be similar to that of conventional TKIs.
Moreover, the clinical course indicated that nephrotic syndrome remission was reached over the course of a protracted timeline after discontinuation of lenvatinib
treatment. Ongoing screening for hypertension and proteinuria might be beneficial for early identification of possible renal damage in patients treated with lenvatinib.
Based on our findings, we suggest that potential renal
damage should be fully considered when using lenvatinib.
