Abstract
Objective The efficacy of lamivudine for fulminant hepatitis B has been reported in Europe and West Asia.
However, in these reports, the main infection genotype is D. Furthermore, if lamivudine improves survival,
prognostic factors for fulminant hepatitis B may differ from those reported previously. The aim of this study
was to clarify the prognostic factors and the efficacy of lamivudine for fulminant hepatitis B in Japan, where
the main infection genotype is B.
Methods This study was a retrospective cohort study. We selected 37 consecutive patients with fulminant
hepatitis due to acute hepatitis B virus infection. As 4 of them had received liver transplantation, the data of
33 patients with a median age of 45 (range, 20-74) years were analyzed.
Results Lamivudine was administered to 10 patients. There were no differences in clinical features at the
time of the diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis B between patients treated with and without lamivudine. Survival
rates of patients treated with and without lamivudine were 70% and 26%, respectively. Age (45 years),
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and non-administration of lamivudine were associated with fatal
outcomes. The survival rates of patients treated with and without lamivudine, who were in a state of systemic
inflammatory response syndrome, were 50% and 9%, and in patients aged 45 years, 50% and 8%, respectively.
Conclusion This study suggests the efficacy of lamivudine for fulminant hepatitis B in the area where the
main infection genotype is B. We consider that lamivudine is worth administering to patients with fulminant
hepatitis B.

Introduction
Worldwide, hepatitis B virus infection is one of the most
frequent causes of fulminant hepatic failure. It has been reported that fulminant hepatitis B occurs in approximately
1% of patients with acute disease and carries a mortality
rate of up to 80% (1-3). Liver transplantation has been the
only established treatment for fulminant hepatitis B.
Recently, the safety and efficacy of lamivudine treatment
for patients with severe acute or fulminant hepatitis B has
been reported (4-7). Tillmann et al (6) reported that lamivudine treatment led to fast recovery with the potential to
prevent liver failure and liver transplantation when administered early enough. On the other hand, Kumar et al (7) reported that, though lamivudine significantly decreased hepatitis B virus DNA levels in patients with acute hepatitis B, it
did not produce significant biochemical and clinical improvement compared to that in patients receiving a placebo.
Thus, it has been controversial whether lamivudine treatment improves the survival of severe acute or fulminant
hepatitis B. Furthermore, in these previous reports, the number of patients with hepatic coma was limited, and most of
the study populations were infected with hepatitis B virus

genotype D (4-7). The hepatitis B virus has been classified
into eight genotypes (A-H), and clinical differences between
genotypes have been reported (8, 9). Genotypes affect clinical features of acute hepatitis B virus infection (10, 11). In
Japan, most patients with fulminant hepatitis B are infected
with genotype B (12). Thus, the efficacy of lamivudine
treatment for Japanese patients with fulminant hepatitis B
has remained in doubt.
On the other hand, if lamivudine treatment improves the
survival of fulminant hepatitis B, the prognostic factors for
the disease may differ from those previously reported
(prothrombin time, hepatic coma grade, age, etc) (2, 13).
Recently, we reported the importance of systemic inflammatory response syndrome as a prognostic factor for fulminant
hepatic failure (14).
In this study, we tried to clarify the prognostic factors and
the efficacy of lamivudine treatment for Japanese patients
with fulminant hepatitis B.
Patients and Methods
Patients
This study was a retrospective cohort study. We selected
37 consecutive patients with fulminant hepatitis due to acute
hepatitis B virus infection (17 males and 20 females) with a
median age of 45 (range, 20-74) years who admitted to
Okayama University Hospital or 7 affiliated hospitals with a
liver transplantation program for fulminant hepatic failure,
which started in 1998, between January 1990 and December
2006. All patients were negative for human immunodeficiency virus at the time of the diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis B, with no evidence of pre-existing liver disease. Patients
who had tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen previously, or who had a family history of chronic hepatitis B
were excluded from this study.
Diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis B
Diagnoses of acute hepatitis B virus infection were based
on positivity for the IgM anti-hepatitis B virus core antibody.
Fulminant hepatic failure is defined as the development of
coma grade II or greater encephalopathy within 8 weeks of
the first symptoms of illness, with a prothrombin time less
than 40% of the normal value, and no previous chronic or
alcoholic liver diseases (15). Acute and subacute types of
fulminant hepatic failure were defined as the development of
coma grade II or greater encephalopathy within 10 days and
between 11 days and 8 weeks, respectively. Hepatic coma
was graded on the standard scale from I to IV. Cases whose
ultrasonography or computed tomography showed the features of chronic liver disease (splenomegaly, atrophy of the
right lobe with enlargement of the left lobe, and varices or
collaterals) were excluded from this study.
Diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome was defined
according to the criteria of the Consensus Conference on
Sepsis and Multiple Organ Failure (16): a temperature
>38℃ or <36℃, heart rate >90 beats per minute, tachypnea
>20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 <4.3 kPa, white blood cell
count >12×103
/mm3 or <4×103/mm3, or the presence of immature neutrophils >10%. Systemic inflammatory response
syndrome was diagnosed by the presence of 2 or more components.
Treatment
All patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and
received supportive care with monitoring of clinical, biochemical and hemodynamic parameters. Patients received
lamivudine treatment, pulse steroid treatment, administration
of protease inhibitor, plasma exchange, and hemodiafiltration. As anti-viral therapy, 100-150 mg/day of lamivudine
was administered. Pulse steroid treatment was performed
with 500-1,000 mg/day of methylprednisolone for three days
in order to suppress the activity of liver injury. As a protease
inhibitor, 1,000-2,000 mg/day of gabexate mesilate or 100-
200 mg/day of nafamostat mesilate was administered in order to prevent the development of disseminated intravascular
coagulation. Plasma exchange was performed three to five
times during the initial 7-10 days in order to remove unfavorable substances such as protein-binding agents, endotoxins, and immune complexes from the plasma, and to supplement coagulation factors. The duration and volume of
plasma exchange was 5 to 6 hours, 3.2 to 4.8 L, respectively. Hemodiafiltration was also performed continuously or
over 3 to 4 hours in order to enhance the removal of the
middle-sized molecules that cause hepatic coma or hepatic
failure and to maintain the acid-base balance. Indications at
the time of apheresis was performed were divided into the
following groups: (i) patients with coagulopathy were indicated for plasma exchange; (ii) patients with central nervous
disorder including hepatic encephalopathy were indicated for
plasma exchange only or plasma exchange combined with
hemodiafiltration; and (iii) patients with renal failure caused
by fulminant hepatic failure were indicated for hemodiafiltration. When the circulation state was unstable, continuous
hemodiafiltration was performed.
Liver transplantation was performed based on the criteria
established in 1996 by the Acute Liver Failure Study Group
of Japan (15). The criteria are similar to those of the King’s
College Hospital (2, 15). Patients who required a liver transplantation were conveyed to Okayama University Hospital.
Statistical analysis
All data were entered into an Access database (Microsoft
Corp., Redmond, WA). We used the SPSS statistical program (release 11.0.1 J, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) for statistical analysis.

The clinical characteristics of patients treated with lamivudine were compared with those not treated with lamivudine. In order to analyze the independent clinical factors
for fatal outcomes, we analyzed 11 factors at the time of diagnosis in patients with fulminant hepatitis B who did not
receive liver transplantation: age, gender, type of disease onset, hepatic coma grade, systemic inflammatory response
syndrome, platelet count, total bilirubin level, ratio of total
to direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase level, creatinine
level, and prothrombin activity, and a treatment factor: lamivudine treatment.
Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were performed to identify factors for poor prognosis.
Continuous variables were expressed as medians and ranges.
Dichotomous variables were comparedof by the Fisher exact
test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the significance of differences in the continuous variables. Cumulative survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier
method. p values <0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Patient selection
During the clinical course, 4 of the 37 patients (11%) received living related donor liver transplantation within three
days after the diagnosis, and it was difficult to assess the effect of treatments including lamivudine in the 4 patients.
Thus, in this study, factors for poor prognosis were analyzed
in 33 patients with fulminant hepatitis B treated without
liver transplantation, consisting of 16 males and 17 females
with a median age of 45 (range, 20-74) years.
Lamivudine treatment was started in 10 of 33 patients
(30%) within three days after the diagnosis. During the
clinical course, pulse steroid treatment, administration of
protease inhibitor, plasma exchange, and hemodiafiltration
were performed in 7 (21%), 22 (67%), 29 (88%), and 19
(58%) of the 33 patients, respectively. Thirteen patients
(39%) survived without liver transplantation and the remaining 20 (61%) died.
Comparison between patients treated and not
treated with lamivudine
There were no differences in clinical features at the time
of diagnosis of fulminant hepatitis B between patients
treated with and without lamivudine (Table 1).
Prognostic factors associated with fatal outcomes
of 33 patients with fulminant hepatitis B
Using a univariate Cox proportional hazard model, age
(45 years), systemic inflammatory response syndrome,
and non-administration of lamivudine were associated with
fatal outcomes. A tendency for a higher ratio of total to direct bilirubin was observed in patients with a poor outcome.
The type of disease onset, hepatic coma grade, total bilirubin level, and prothrombin activity were not associated with
fatal outcomes (Table 2-A).
Using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, age
(45 years), systemic inflammatory response syndrome,
and non-administration of lamivudine were associated with
fatal outcomes (Table 2-B).
One-week and overall survival rates of patients aged < 45
years were 77% and 64%, respectively, while those of patients aged 45 years were 68% and 21%, respectively.
One-week and overall survival rates of patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome at the time of diagnosis were 39% and 15%, respectively, while those of patients without systemic inflammatory response syndrome
were 95% and 55%, respectively. One-week and overall survival rates of patients treated with lamivudine were 90% and
70%, respectively, while those of patients not treated with
lamivudine were 65% and 26%, respectively (Fig. 1).
In patients who were in a state of systemic inflammatory
response syndrome at the time of diagnosis, the overall survival rate of those treated with and without lamivudine was
50% and 9%, respectively. On the other hand, in patients
who were not in a state of systemic inflammatory response
syndrome at the time of diagnosis, the overall survival rate
of those treated with and without lamivudine was 75% and
41%, respectively. Furthermore, in patients aged 45 years
at the time of diagnosis, the overall survival rate of those
treated with and without lamivudine was 50% and 8%, respectively. On the other hand, in patients aged < 45 years at
the time of diagnosis, the overall survival rate of those
treated with and without lamivudine was 100% and 50%, respectively.
Discussion
This is the first report that indicates the efficacy of lamivudine for patients with fulminant hepatitis due to acute
hepatitis B virus infection in the area where most of the patients are reported as being infected with genotype B. In this
study, age (45 years), systemic inflammatory response
syndrome, and non-administration of lamivudine were associated with fatal outcomes. Furthermore, we speculate that
systemic inflammatory response syndrome affects survival
for less than one week after diagnosis, while age affects survival in the period more than one week after diagnosis.
Lamivudine treatment may improve the survival gradually
through the clinical course. Importantly, this study was retrospective, and the number of our study population was limited. Thus, a further prospective study with a larger number
of patients is required to confirm these findings.
The King’s College Group and the U.S. Acute Liver Failure Study Group have reported that systemic inflammatory
response syndrome, which indicates a clinical whole-body
state, is an important prognostic factor for fulminant hepatic
failure (17, 18). During the progression from systemic inflammatory response syndrome to septic shock, patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and multiple or-

gan failure (19). Furthermore, we have recently reported that
systemic inflammatory response syndrome is associated with
fatal outcomes in patients with fulminant hepatitis B, and
that patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome
exhibit hepatic failure of increased severity (14, 20). This
study indicates that, even in fulminant hepatitis B with systemic inflammatory response syndrome, lamivudine treatment may improve the survival. We consider that lamivudine
is worth administering to patients with fulminant hepatitis B
who are in a state of systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
In our previous report, the ratio of total to direct bilirubin,
which reflects the capacity for hepatic bilirubin conjugation,
was associated with fatal outcomes in patients with fulminant hepatitis B (20). In this study, the ratio of total to direct bilirubin might be surpassed by lamivudine administration as a prognostic factor for fulminant hepatitis B. Furthermore, in this study, direct measures of hepatic function, such
as prothrombin activity, total bilirubin, and hepatic coma
grade, were not found to be prognostic factors. On the other
hand, Sainokami et al (21) reported that in patients with fulminant hepatitis B, serum levels of hepatitis B virus-DNA
on admission was higher in patients who died than in those
who recovered. Kumar et al (7) reported that in patients
with acute hepatitis B, serum levels of hepatitis B virusDNA fell more rapidly in the lamivudine-treated group than
in the placebo-treated group. These findings may indicate
that lamivudine administration decreases serum levels of
hepatitis B virus-DNA rapidly and partially prevents the
progression of liver failure in patients with fulminant hepati-

tis B when lamivudine is administered early enough.
The importance of age as a prognostic factor for fulminant hepatitis B has been reported previously (2, 13, 20).
However, the meaning of age as a prognostic factor has not
been clarified. In this study, in patients without systemic inflammatory response syndrome at the time of diagnosis who
received lamivudine, survival rate of those aged 45
years and < 45 years was 50% and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, according to the results of this study, age may not
affect the prognosis in the first week after diagnosis. Thus,
we speculate that the residual capacity of liver regeneration
in patients aged 45 years may be less sufficient than in
those aged < 45 years, or that patients aged 45 years
have greater risk of complications such as infections and
multiple organ failure.
Kumar et al (7) reported that there was a slightly lower
rate of development of protective antibodies to the hepatitis
B surface antigen in the lamivudine-treated group. Yotsuyanagi et al (22) reported that, in the window period when
both the hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to it are
absent from serum, immunoglobulin-bound hepatitis B virus
is predominant, but free hepatitis B virus still persists at a
low level, and that, after the seroconversion to antibodies to
hepatitis B surface antigen, free hepatitis B virus is not detectable. The absence of free hepatitis B virus in serum generally indicates a loss of infectivity. Thus, we considered
that the administration of lamivudine should be continued
until the development of antibodies to hepatitis B surface
antigen.
In order to rescue more patients, to accurately identify patients with a potentially fatal outcome and to clarify the
prognostic factors are important. In this study, age (45
years), systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and nonadministration of lamivudine were associated with fatal outcomes. Furthermore, this study suggests that, even in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or

aged 45 years, lamivudine treatment may improve their
prognosis. However, the mechanism of the efficacy of lamivudine for fulminant hepatitis B has yet to be fully clarified.
On the other hand, direct measures of hepatic function, such
as prothrombin activity, total bilirubin, and hepatic coma
grade, were not found to be prognostic factors. Further prospective studies with a larger number of patients are required to confirm these findings.
