ABSTRACT
Background Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are a 
heterogenous group of lesions with varying degrees 
of malignant potential. PCLs are often incidentally 
detected on imaging. Management for patients without 
an immediate indication for resection or tissue sampling 
entails radiographic surveillance to assess for features 
concerning for malignant transformation. This study 
aims to determine the rates of adherence to surveillance 
recommendations for incidental PCLs, and identify factors 
associated with adherence or loss of follow-up.
Methods We conducted a single-centre retrospective 
study of patients at a tertiary safety net hospital with 
incidentally discovered asymptomatic PCLs. Follow-up 
was defined as having undergone repeat imaging as 
recommended in the radiology report. Data were analysed 
using logistic regression.
Results Within our cohort (n=172), 123 (71.5%) 
subjects completed follow-up imaging. Attending a 
gastroenterology appointment was most strongly 
associated with completing follow-up for PCLs and 
remained significant (p=0.001) in a multivariate logistic 
regression model. Subjects without a documented primary 
care provider were less likely to have follow-up (p=0.028).
Larger cyst size was associated with completion of followup in univariate only (p=0.067).
Conclusion We found that follow-up of an incidentally 
discovered PCLs was completed in the majority of 
our subjects. Incomplete follow-up for PCLs occurred 
in up to one in three to four patients in our cohort. 
Access to primary care and utilisation of subspecialty 
gastroenterology care are associated with completion of 
follow-up for PCLs. If validated, our findings can guide 
potential interventions to improve follow-up rates for PCLs.
INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) represent 
a wide array of clinicopathological lesions 
with varying degrees of malignant potential. 
Advancements in the quality of cross-sectional 
imaging combined with the frequent utilisation of such imaging studies to investigate 
non-specific abdominal complaints has led to 
an increase in the incidental detection of small 
PCLs, which are estimated to be prevalent in 
at least 15% of the population.1 2 Incidentally detected PCLs present a management 
dilemma for clinicians as their natural history 
is not known with certainty, but it is accepted 
that some of these lesions have malignant 
potential—such as intraductal papillary 
mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) and mucinous 
cystic neoplasms (MCNs).3 The American 
Gastroenterological Association reported 
that the risk of malignant transformation is 
approximately 0.24% per year, and therefore imaging surveillance is recommended 
for MCNs and IPMNS, even though reduction in pancreatic cancer mortality through 
surveillance remains unproven.1 4 5 Complicating matters is the fact that there are several 
Summary box
What is already known about this subject?
► Pancreatic cysts are often incidentally discovered 
on abdominal imaging, and with varying benign and 
malignant potential, they often represent a diagnostic dilemma for clinicians.
► The American College of Gastroenterology recommends routine surveillance imaging in surgically fit 
patients with asymptomatic pancreatic cysts.
► At this point, the reduction in pancreatic cancer 
mortality through surveillance remains unproven.
What are the new findings?
► Access to primary care and utilisation of subspecialty gastroenterology care are associated with appropriate surveillance follow-up for pancreatic cystic 
lesions (PCLs) in a large safety net hospital.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► Optimising the management of incidentally discovered pancreatic cysts will require further research 
to assess if detection and management of PCLs can 
reduce morbidity and mortality for patients.
► If validated, our findings can guide potential interventions to improve follow-up rates in vulnerable 
populations.

published guidelines for surveillance of PCLs and they 
differ in their recommendations in regards to frequency 
and duration of surveillance.4–7 While recognising these 
limitations, it is nonetheless critical that these incidental 
findings undergo surveillance imaging so patients are not 
‘lost to follow-up’. While endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) 
has an important role in the diagnosis and surveillance 
of PCLs in some patients, it is primarily used in patients 
with larger cysts or those with concerning radiographic 
features and necessitates involvement of a gastroenterologist (GI) in the patient’s care. For the purposes of this 
study, we elected to focus solely on adherence to radiographic surveillance recommendations.
There are few studies that have explored what factors 
influence PCL surveillance follow-up. In a recent cohort 
study of 100 patients with newly diagnosed incidental 
cysts, 53% did not receive the recommended follow-up.
8
Another study looked at 445 subjects with IPMNs and 
found that 33% failed to undergo surveillance imaging 
within 2 years of diagnosis.9
 In this study, the majority of 
patients (over 50%) were white English speaking males 
with mid-to-high household incomes. At this point in 
time, no study has explored adherence rates of PCL 
surveillance in a large urban safety net hospital serving 
a diverse population comprising a significant proportion 
of non-white, non-English speaking patients. Hence, our 
study aims to determine the rates of adherence to surveillance recommendations for incidental pancreatic cysts at 
our institution and identify factors associated with adherence or loss of follow-up.
METHODS
We hypothesised that demographic factors, social determinants of health and cyst characteristics would be associated with adherence to surveillance recommendations 
for PCLs. We conducted a single-centre retrospective 
observational study of patients at a tertiary safety net 
hospital with incidentally discovered asymptomatic PCLs. 
Patients with incidental PCLs found on imaging from 
1/1/2010 to 7/1/2018 were included. We considered 
adherence to surveillance to be complete if a follow-up 
imaging study for the PCL had been performed within 
1 year of the surveillance interval recommended in the 
radiology report. Subjects with known pancreatic cancer, 
pseudocysts from acute or chronic pancreatitis or symptomatic PCLs were excluded.
We collected the following demographic data: age 
at initial PCL detection, sex, race, ethnicity, country of 
origin, language, employment status, education, insurance type, primary care physician (PCP) affiliation and 
follow-up with a GI. We also collected the following 
radiographic data: cyst location, size and number and 
the presence of pancreatic duct dilation. Size was dichotomised to larger than 1.5 cm or not, based on previous 
data, suggesting that this cut-off was relevant for further 
workup and detection of malignancy.
10
Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with completion of follow-up. We first performed 
univariate logistic regression of the variables above with 
completion of follow-up. Factors that were significantly 
(p<0.05) associated with completion of follow-up were 
included in a multivariate logistic regression model. Analyses were performed with the R programming language, 
V.3.4.1.
RESULTS
During the study period, 262 patients were identified by 
data query. Of these, 90 subjects were excluded due to 
findings of pseudocysts (n=29), imaging not within the 
study timeline (n=25), unobtainable radiographic studies 
(n=24), metastatic or pancreaticobiliary malignancy 
at time of PCL diagnosis (n=5), cystic lesions removed 
at outside hospitals (n=3), patients declining follow-up 
imaging (n=3) and one subject who died during the 
admission when the PCL was discovered. Subsequently, 
172 subjects met inclusion criteria as having asymptomatic, incidentally discovered PCLs with a radiology report 
recommending follow-up. In terms of the imaging modalities used in these incidental findings, 111 were captured 
by CT, 55 by MRI, 3 by abdominal ultrasound and 2 by 
EUS.
Of these 172 subjects, 123 (71.5%) successfully 
completed follow-up imaging (median age 64.3, 70% 
female). Within this cohort, 74 (43%) were white and 84 
(48.8%) were black; 33 (19.7%) were Hispanic. English 
speaking and subjects born in the USA accounted for 131 
(75.7%) and 101 (58.4%), respectively. Additionally, 137 
subjects (79.2%) had a PCP and 106 (61.3%) had been 
seen in the GI clinic for any reason prior to the incidental 
PCL finding or within 1 year of discovery. In terms of 
medical insurance, 61 (35.3%) had federal, 79 (45.7%) 
state, 29 (16.8%) commercial and 4 (2.3%) had no 
insurance. In terms of education, 34 (19.7%) completed 
college, 79 (46%) completed high school and 59 (34.1%) 
did not complete high school or have formal schooling. 
Associated cyst characteristics of size, location, pancreatic 
duct dilation and number of cysts are reported in table 1.
In a univariate model, sex, language, PCP affiliation, 
follow-up in GI clinic and cyst size were significantly associated with follow-up or lack thereof. Education status, 
insurance type, ethnicity and race were not statistically 
significant. Male subjects (p=0.0207), subjects without 
a PCP (p=0.0276) or with a PCP not affiliated with our 
centre (p=0.0469) were less likely to complete follow-up. 
Subjects with a cyst smaller than 1.5 cm (p=0.0513) were 
marginally less likely to complete follow-up. Gastroenterology clinic follow-up was strongly associated 
with completion of follow-up (p<0.0001). In comparison with English speaking subjects, those that spoke a 
language other than English or Spanish were more likely 
to complete follow-up (p=0.0429). In the multivariate 
model including these variables (table 2), follow-up with 
GI (p=0.0019 and speaking a language other than English

or Spanish (p=0.0423 remained significantly associated 
with completion of follow-up, whereas having no PCP 
remained significantly associated with loss of follow-up 
(p=0.0286) in comparison with subjects that had a PCP 
at our medical centre.
DISCUSSION
This study found that the majority (71.5%) of subjects 
completed the recommended surveillance as indicated 
in the radiology report. Interestingly, GI clinic follow-up 
for any reason was the most significant predictor of 
completed PCL surveillance in our cohort. Although 
we did not explore whether PCL surveillance was the 
primary reason for GI clinic follow-up or whether it was 
the GI who ordered the surveillance imaging study, this 
association would suggest that rates of adherence to 
surveillance can be improved by ensuring patients with 
PCLs are seen in specialty clinic. Our institution had 
previously conducted a similar study on follow-up of 
pulmonary nodules, which culminated in the creation of 
a ‘Lung Nodule Clinic’ staffed by pulmonologists, nurses 
and health navigators. Others have demonstrated that a 
multidisciplinary approach to lung nodule management 
improves care and adherence to follow-up recommendation.11 As such, optimising the management of incidental 
PCLs will require further research to assess if detection 
and management of PCLs can reduce morbidity and/or 
mortality for patients.
Few studies have explored adherence rates of incidental PCL surveillance, and in particular whether 
social determinants of health or other demographic 
factors have an impact.8 9 Tabrizian et al reported that 
socioeconomic disparities did not influence surveillance compliance; instead, they found that patients with 
major comorbidities were less likely to be compliant with 
follow-up imaging, reasoning that their medical comorbidities took priority over surveillance of an incidental 
radiographic abnormality.9
 In comparison to the study 
population in the work by Tabrizian et al. (predominately 
white, English-speaking males), 65% of our subjects were 
female, 48.5% were black, 19.6% were Hispanic, 41% 
were not born in the USA, 24% did not speak English 
and 34% did not complete high school or have formal 
schooling. Yet, in our study, we also did not find statistically significant socioeconomic or demographic factors 
that impacted surveillance rates, other than the somewhat unexpected finding that non-English/non-Spanish 
language was a predictor of surveillance on multivariate 
analysis. It is important to highlight that this group was 
small (18 patients) and very heterogenous (primary 
languages included Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Chinese 
and Vietnamese), making it difficult to draw firm

conclusions on this issue, although it is possible that our 
hospital’s extensive patient education and navigation 
services could have played a role in ensuring follow-up 
care for these patients. When comparing our findings 
to other cancer surveillance practices, the results are 
mixed. A study from the National Cancer Screening 
Program in South Korea found that adherence rates to 
follow-up after a positive faecal occult blood test were 
associated with being a younger male of high socioeconomic status.12 For cervical cancer screening, it has been 
reported that English fluency and number of years in the 
USA were positively associated with adherence rates.13
Thus, it is critical for clinicians to recognise these differences, for which interventions may help reduce healthcare disparities.
In a study with a similar aim as ours, Schenck et al
studied surveillance adherence rates over a 2-year period 
at a tertiary care centre and found that over 50% of 
subjects received no follow-up.
8
 Their study identified 
the following four predictors of PCL surveillance: (1) the 
radiology report mentioned a cyst and (2) recommended 
follow-up in the conclusion of the report, (3) presence of 
main pancreatic duct dilation and (4) absence of multiple 
cysts.8 This study limited their cohort to subjects that 
lived in one of four zip codes near the hospital and had at 
least two outpatient clinical encounters after detection of 
the PCL—criteria which should have served to enhance 
the likelihood of follow-up. In our univariate analysis, 
not having a PCP affiliated with our centre was associated with a lower likelihood of surveillance. A possible 
explanation could be that the PCPs for these subjects 
were less likely to receive the radiology report or recommendations for PCL surveillance. Ensuring that PCPs are 
alerted to the detection of a PCL via closed-loop communication may be a way to improve surveillance rates. This 
finding needs to be validated in additional cohorts and/
or prospectively because it highlights a potential area for 
quality improvement and clinical intervention to improve 
surveillance rates.
Last, in terms of cyst characteristics, our analysis showed 
that patients with cysts smaller than 1.5 cm were marginally less likely to complete follow-up, although this did 
not achieve statistical significance. While size <1.5 cm is 
considered a lower risk category, malignant transformation can still occur, so surveillance is still recommended 
in order to document stability over time and exclude the 
development of worrisome or high-risk features such as 
enhancing nodules or main pancreatic duct dilation. In 
contrast to our findings, Schenck et al found that pancreatic duct dilation and the absence of multiple cysts were 
predictors for higher rates of surveillance, while size and 
location were not.8
 Taken together, our studies would 
indicate that patients with multiple, small (<1.5 cm) cysts 
without pancreatic duct dilation are at increased risk for 
loss of follow-up and may benefit from intervention to 
ensure surveillance is completed.
There are a few limitations of our study to highlight. 
First, the duration of the study occurred over an 8-year 
period in which surveillance and management guidelines 
were updated more than once.1 4 5 14–16 We are unable to say 
with certainty if evolving guidelines influenced radiology 
recommendations at time of diagnosis. Second, we do 
not know if patients received follow-up elsewhere. This 
could have influenced subjects who had a non-affiliated 
PCP, where follow-up scans may have not been available in our database. Third, the strong association with 
GI follow-up may be confounded by a patient-intrinsic 
quality that we are unable to capture. One could posit 
that patients who attend GI appointments and follow-up 
with clinical recommendations (ie, imaging surveillance) 
have higher rates of adherence than patients who are 
lost to follow-up. Plus, we were unable to ascertain which 
patients were not referred to GI. Finally, this study was 
retrospective and conducted at a single institution where 
our results may not be applicable to other practice and 
regional settings.
In conclusion, we found that follow-up of an incidentally discovered PCLs was completed in the majority of 
our patients. Access to primary care and utilisation of 
subspecialty GI care were associated with completion of 
follow-up for PCLs and represent potential areas of intervention to improve surveillance rates. Further studies 
are needed to validate these findings as well as further 
explore other potential factors that impact surveillance 
rates.
