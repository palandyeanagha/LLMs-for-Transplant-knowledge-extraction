The last 3 years have seen the emergence of promising targeted therapies for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Sorafenib has been the mainstay of treatment for a decade and newer modalities were ineffective and did not confer any increased
therapeutic benefit until the introduction of lenvatinib which was approved based on its non-inferiority to sorafenib. The
subsequent success of regorafenib in HCC patients who progress on sorafenib treatment heralded a new era of second-line
treatment and was quickly followed by ramucirumab, cabozantinib, and the most influential, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
Over the same period combination therapies, including anti-angiogenesis agents with ICIs, dual ICIs and targeted agents in
conjunction with surgery or other loco-regional therapies, have been extensively investigated and have shown promise and
provided the basis for exciting clinical trials. Work continues to develop additional novel therapeutic agents which could potentially
augment the presently available options and understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for drug resistance, with the goal
of improving the survival of patients with HCC.

INTRODUCTION
Primary liver cancer remains a major problem for all health care
systems worldwide and is associated with a significant clinical,
economic, and psychological burden. Hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) accounts for ~90% of cases of non-metastatic tumors of the
liver.1 During the past decades, research has shed light on the
epidemiology, risk factors, and molecular and genetic profiles of
HCC‚ contributing to the evolution of strategies for prevention,
surveillance, early diagnosis, and treatment.2,3 Liver resection,
ablation, and liver transplantation are potentially curative but
require diagnosis at a sufficiently early stage. Unfortunately, a
significant proportion of HCC patients present with intermediate
and advanced stage disease often, despite diligent surveillance,
and curative treatments are frequently not possible.4 In these
patients, systemic therapy remains essential and its pivotal role
and potential have stimulated considerable research over the past
decade. In this review, we examine recent advances in targeted
therapy and discuss the impact this has had on the management
of HCC. We also provide an overview of the most important areas
of HCC research including novel clinical trials and technical
platforms which promise to facilitate substantial progress within
the next decade.
APPROVED FIRST-LINE AGENTS FOR HCC
Sorafenib
The success of SHARP and Asia-Pacific trial promoted the approval
of sorafenib as first-line targeted therapy for advanced HCC,5–9
ushering in the era of systemic treatment. Subsequently, virtually
all trials were centered around sorafenib and it was used as a
control with which novel first-line agents were compared and
evaluated in an attempt to improve the prognosis of patients with
HCC. Unfortunately, despite a number of trials which compared
these novel agents including sunitinib,10 brivanib,11 cediranib,12
linifanib,13 dovotinib,14 and immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to
sorafenib, none achieved the predefined primary end points (Fig. 1).
In addition, during the decade when these agents were investigated, the median overall survival (OS) of sorafenib monotherapy as
first-line treatment for advanced HCC increased from 10.7 months
(SHARP) to 14.7 months (CheckMate-459), further consolidating its
position. Meanwhile, the anti-tumor activity and safety of sorafenib
have been validated in real-world setting. Subanalyses of the SHARP
and Asia-Pacific trials found sorafenib was effective and safe
irrespective of disease etiology, disease burden, ECOG (Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status) status, etc.15–17
The safety of sorafenib was consistent across Child-Pugh A and B
patients in clinical practice18 and the occurrence of side effects such
as hand-foot syndrome and diarrhea were associated with an
improved OS.19 Baseline hepatic function, clinicopathological
factors, and etiology also affect the prognosis in HCC patients
treated with sorafenib.20 In addition, sorafenib exerts anti-tumor
effects with recurrent tumors following liver transplantation,
conferring a survival advantage when compared with best
supportive care (BSC).21–23 Noticeably, the application of sorafenib
in clinical practice displays significant regional variations and
incompliance with guidelines besides its usage as first-line therapy.
It is common that initially unresectable HCCs got downstaged after
sorafenib treatment and underwent curative-intent surgery24–28 and
locoregional therapies before sorafenib were commonly encountered in real-world settings.29,30

The clinical benefit of sorafenib however remains modest and
the complex molecular pathogenesis of HCC stimulated the
investigation of combinations of sorafenib with other molecular
targeting drugs. Sorafenib has been combined with antiangiogenic agents, MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors, mTOR pathway
inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, EGF/EGFR pathway
inhibitors, and HGF/c-Met pathway inhibitors.31 Other agents
such as interferon,32 selumetinib,33 capecitabine,34 tegafur-uracil,35 gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX),36,37 and gemcitabine
alone38 have also been evaluated but to date no treatments
involving combinations containing sorafenib have succeeded in
phase III trials.
Since sorafenib and TACE are both recommended therapies for
advanced HCC, it is reasonable to expect that their combined use
would confer benefits when compared with monotherapy. Results
however highlighted regional differences and the heterogeneity
of the trial protocols. In TACE 2, the multi-center, randomized,
placebo-controlled, phase 3 European trial, when compared with
TACE alone the addition of concurrent sorafenib, unlike the SPACE
trial,39 did not improve progression free survival (PFS).40 It was also
shown that the addition of sorafenib did not confer any survival
benefit in patients with unresectable HCCs, who had already
responded to TACE.41 Contrasting with these findings, retrospective studies from China have shown that combination therapy
with sorafenib and TACE increased OS by more than 50%
compared with TACE alone,42–53 which was supported by the
findings from a number of other groups.54,55 Recently, the
TACTICS trial, a randomized, multi-center prospective trial from
Japan reported an improved PFS for TACE plus sorafenib
compared with TACE alone (25.2 vs 13.5 months; p = 0.006),56
although this trial used a redefined PFS (not conventional PFS but
time until “unTACEable” progression). The TACTICS trial also used
time to any cause of death plus OS as primary endpoints (results
not reported) and compared with sorafenib monotherapy, TACE
plus sorafenib was only superior in controlling tumor progression
and did not prolong OS.57,58
The acceptance of sorafenib as the standard to which other
newer agents and non-surgical interventions are compared has
resulted in studies comparing its use as monotherapy with TACE
plus external beam radiotherapy59 and TACE plus intensitymodulated radiotherapy combined with sorafenib.60 In the SARAH
study, selective internal radiotherapy with yttrium-90 resin microspheres did not produce any survival benefit compared with
sorafenib in locally advanced and inoperable HCC (median OS, 8.0
vs 9.9, p = 0.18), and did not meet the primary endpoint of OS.61
Similarly, the addition of selective internal radiation therapy to
sorafenib did not result in a significant improvement in OS
compared with sorafenib alone.62 Bettinger et al.63 however did
demonstrate that stereotactic body (external beam) radiotherapy
employed as monotherapy (SBRT) was able to improve OS
compared with sorafenib and SBRT with TACE also provided
improved OS and PFS when compared with sorafenib and TACE in
combination.64 In a recent trial of hepatic arterial infusion
chemotherapy (HAIC; NCT02774187), He et al.65 reported that
sorafenib plus HAIC with FOLFOX improved OS compared with
sorafenib alone in advanced HCC when portal vein invasion was
present, which was supported by other studies.66,67 Although the
SCOOP-2 trial found sequential HAIC with cisplatin and sorafenib
did not improve the survival benefit compared with sorafenib
alone this is likely to have resulted from the study being
underpowered for the primary and secondary endpoints.68
Due to the high recurrence rates following hepatectomy for
HCC, approaches to adjuvant therapy has been extensively
investigated although previous attempts, including the use of
anti-viral agents, have been largely unsuccessful. Based on the
palliative use and success of sorafenib its potential in the adjuvant
setting was investigated and improved survivals following surgery
anticipated. Unfortunately, this has not been demonstrated and it
failed to reduce postoperative tumor recurrence in the STORM
trial69 and other western studies.70 Explanations for the negative
outcome in the STORM trial include high-dose modification rates,
short treatment durations, and the enrollment of patients who
were not at high risk of tumor recurrence (91% with no evidence
of tumor satellites, 91% with one lesion, and 68% with no
microscopic vascular invasion).71 Consistent with this viewpoint,
Wang et al.72 reported no case of recurrence during the sorafenib
dosing period whereas 4/14 patients suffered recurrence of their
tumor within 7 months of discontinuation of sorafenib72 and
persistent sorafenib intake following postoperative recurrence
improved OS.73 Considering that patients who respond to
sorafenib may belong to limited clinical or biological subsets,
the effectiveness of sorafenib in an unselected population cohort
supports its use in the adjuvant setting. A number of studies from
the Far East including China, Japan, and Korea include patients
with HCCs who are treated with hepatectomy despite their tumors
being outside Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Classification (BCLC)
guidelines, and although the results are difficult to compare due
to heterogeneity of the protocols the results are positive.

Zhuang et al.77 demonstrated that adjuvant therapy increased
disease free survival (DFS) and OS. Sorafenib treatment following
hepatectomy significantly prolonged the OS of advanced HCC
rather than intermediate HCC.78 In addition to BCLC stage,
patients who underwent hepatectomy and were pathologically
diagnosed with microvascular invasion (MVI) also benefited from
adjuvant sorafenib treatment.79 In line with these results, a large
recent study with propensity score matching analysis also
demonstrated that sorafenib significantly improved overall and
recurrence-free survival following resection.80 The results from
these studies which include all eligible patients suggest that more
precise stratification would enable the identification of those
patients who will benefit most from the use of adjuvant sorafenib
and those in where additional treatment is not appropriate.
Ongoing trials are attempting to evaluate the role of sorafenib in
patients with MVI following radical resection (NCT02867280 and
NCT02537158).
Lenvatinib
Following the approval of sorafenib for use in the treatment of
HCC it takes more than a decade before the second first-line
targeted agent for HCC emerged. Lenvatinib was approved for the
first-line therapy in advanced HCC following the results of the
REFLECT trial, a randomized phase III non-inferiority trial published
by Kudo et al.81 Although not approved for long, further multicenter data from “real-world conditions” confirmed the efficacy of
lenvatinib, regardless of previous tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
therapies82,83 and lenvatinib monotherapy demonstrated antitumor activity for more than 4 years in unresectable HCC when
portal vein invasion was present.84 In intermediate-stage HCC
patients with tumors exceeding the up-to-seven criteria, for whom
TACE is not helpful, lenvatinib could provide significant longer OS
(37.9 vs. 21.3 months) and PFS (16.0 vs. 3.0 months).85 Lenvatinib
pharmacokinetics in HCC is affected by body weight86,87 and a
sufficient dose (relative dose intensity, RDI) is required to achieve a
good therapeutic effect and consequently improved outcomes
and prognosis are associated with the preservation of liver
function which reduces the number of patients who need to
discontinue their treatment.88–91 With lenvatinib, unlike other TKIs,
there are issues with thyroid toxicity and surveillance for thyroid
abnormalities during treatment is important.92 Hypothyroidism is
not unusual and there are also fewer common reports of
thyrotoxicosis and destructive thyroiditis.93 From a health
economics standpoint however, lenvatinib is more cost effective
than sorafenib.94,95
Second-line targeted agents for HCC
Still, sorafenib displays limited anti-tumor activity and some
initially sorafenib-sensitive would eventually succumb to the
disease, indicating the acquired resistance to sorafenib reduces
its beneficial effects and an urgent need for second-line therapy.
Regorafenib
Initial attempts to discover effective second-line agents were
unsuccessful and mirrored attempts to develop first-line agents
which were superior to sorafenib.96 The RESORCE trial was a
randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, and phase III trial
demonstrating the effectiveness of regorafenib in patients who
had progressed on sorafenib treatment. This study finally
confirmed the potential of second-line agents and ushered in
the era of second-line and sequential therapy.97 Regorafenib
provided survival benefit regardless of the rate of disease
progression during prior sorafenib treatment or since the last
sorafenib dose.98 This was confirmed by Yoo et al.99 in a
retrospective study of safety and efficacy in Korean patients
where data were consistent with those from the RESORCE trial.
Regorafenib was even shown to be effective in patients with HCC
recurrence following liver transplantation with a median OS of
12.9 months following regorafenib initiation and 38.4 months
following sorafenib initiation (95% CI, 18.5–58.4) for the sorafenib
followed by regorafenib sequential therapy.100
However, not all patients who progress on sorafenib are
candidates for second-line therapy.101 In clinical practice only
~30% of patients are eligible for second-line regorafenib
treatment.102 Good liver functional reserve and ECOG performance status during sorafenib treatment contributed to the
efficacy and better outcomes of subsequent treatment,103,104
including lenvatinib.105 This may in part be due to the RDI
required to achieve a clinically significant improvement in
prognosis.106 This is supported by the demonstration that the
new liver reserve function biomarker, albumin-bilirubin grade
(ALBI),107 successfully identified regorafenib candidates and that
in the selected cohort a median OS of 15.6 months was achieved
compared with 6.8 months for non-candidates.108 Even in patients
not eligible for regorafenib, the ones with an ECOG-PS score of 0,
the absence of MVI, and TTP (time to progression) ≥4 months
could still have acceptable postprogression survival.109 Long-term
treatment with regorafenib has also been shown to reduce
angiogenesis and improve portal hypertension (PHT) and acute
administration ameliorates portal haemodynamics, suggesting
that it may be especially suitable for patients with PHT and
preserved liver function.110
Cabozantinib
Cabozantinib is another small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine
kinases which are implicated in the progression of HCC and the
acquired resistance to sorafenib. Cabozantinib blocks the receptors involved in oncogenesis and angiogenesis including VEGFR 1,
2, 3, hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), AXL and the
angiopoietin receptors TIE-2, RET, c-Kit and FLT-3 in vitro and
in vivo. In CELESTIAL trial, cabozantinib achieved the primary
endpoint with median OS of 10.2 months compared with
8.0 months for the placebo group111 and was consequently
approved in the EU and USA. There remains a paucity of data
however from real-world clinical practice examining the sequential
treatment utilizing cabozantinib as the second-line agent, it is a
costly option associated with frequent high-grade adverse events.
Consequently, several studies have addressed the cost-effectiveness
of cabozantinib using the cost and utility data extracted from the
CELESTIAL trial. The conclusion from these studies is consistent and
confirms that at its current cost point, the gain of quality-adjusted
life-years for cabozantinib (QALYs, 0.067–0.16) and the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, $156 437–$1,040,675) mean that it is
not a cost-effective treatment option for patients with sorafenibrefractory HCC,112–114 compared with regorafenib (QALY, 0.18–0.25
and ICER, $201,797–$224,362).115,116
Ramucirumab
Ramucirumab is a fully human recombinant IgG1 monoclonal
antibody targeting the VEGF2 receptor. Although ramucirumab
failed to meet its primary endpoint as second-line treatment in the
REACH trial,117 subgroup analysis found survival benefit in patients
with AFP of 400 ng/ml or higher.118–121 This was later confirmed in
the REACH-2 trial,122 which led to the approval of ramucirumab as
second-line treatment for advanced HCC. REACH-2 is the first
positive phase 3 trial in patients with HCC performed in a
biomarker-selected patient cohort and more recent findings
demonstrated that AFP-enriched HCCs displayed significant
activation of VEGF which suggests the underlying mechanism of
action and confirms the potential value of biomarker-driven
clinical trials.123
Immune checkpoint therapy and TKI inhibitors
ICIs stand as the mainstream of immunotherapy. The CheckMate040124 and KEYNOTE-224125 studies evaluated the safety and
efficacy of nivolumab and pembrolizumab in patients with
Targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma

advanced HCC refractory to previous sorafenib treatment, which
established the basis for accelerated approval by the FDA as
second-line treatment. Subanalysis of CheckMate-040 data validated the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in Asian cohort.126 In
an international real-world cohort study, ICIs have showed
promising efficacy and safety in advanced HCCs as systemic
first-/second-/third-/fourth-line treatment, with median OS and
PFS of 11.0 and 4.6 months respectively127 and an excellent
response to anti-PD-1 therapy has also been described in case
report.128 Although the subsequent phase III KEYNOTE-240 trial
did not meet its pre-specified statistical significance in respect of
improved PFS and OS, the results were consistent with previous
KEYNOTE-224.129 The KEYNOTE-394 presently underway in Asian
patients may clarify the role of pembrolizumab in cases of
advanced HCC with a viral background (NCT03062358). Recently,
CheckMate-459, the multi-center phase III randomized sorafenib
controlled trial evaluating nivolumab as first-line treatment for
advanced HCC, failed to achieve its endpoints (ESMO 2019) but
nivolumab did prolong OS (16.4 vs. 14.7 months) and achieve
long-time disease control, less adverse events (AEs) and survival
benefit regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. Furthermore,
nivolumab improved the survival of HCC patients whose etiology
was HBV/HCV and did not reactivate hepatitis. Camrelizumab
(SHR-1210, Hengrui Pharmaceutical), is an anti-PD-1 inhibitor from
China investigated for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma and
HCC. It has been shown to have antitumor activity in previously
treated Chinese patients with advanced HCC in a multi-center,
open-label, parallel-group, randomized, phase II trial
(NCT02989922),130 providing evidence for the effectiveness of
PD-1 therapy for HBV related HCC in Chinese patients. The results
from other trials investigating novel ICIs including durvalumab,
avelumab, tislelizumab, sintilimab, tremelimumab, ipilimumab,
spartalizumab, and toripalimab will hopefully yield positive results
and provide further options for the treatment of patients with
HCC, particularly those who have relapsed on first-line treatments.
Further efforts to enhance the treatment effect of ICIs include
dual ICIs treatment and combination therapy of ICIs with other
kinds of targeted agents. For dual ICIs treatment, the initial results
from CheckMate 9DW were astonishing: the objective response
rate was 32%, higher than monotherapy of any ICIs alone. FDA has
approved nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab for patients
with HCC previously treated with sorafenib. Treatment modalities
such as radiotherapy and anti-angiogenesis agents which affect
antigen release or modulate the tumor microenvironments have
the potential to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy and the
combination of targeted agents with ICIs are attracting the
attention of a number of research groups and in vitro studies and
early-phase clinical trials assessing combination treatments have
shown promising anti-tumor effects in patients with advanced
HCC. In vitro evidence by Qui et al.131 demonstrated that
lenvatinib and regorafenib could affect the expression of PD-L1
and real-time PCR results suggested that the mRNA expression of
PD-L1 in the lenvatinib group was significantly higher than that in
the control group, while its expression in the regorafenib group
was significantly lower. When combined with anti-PD-1, lenvatinib
can modulate cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment
and enhance antitumor activity.132,133 In July 2019, the FDA
announced its approval of the first combination therapy employing the TKI lenvatinib with the ICI pembrolizumab based on the
results from the KEYNOTE-524/Study 116 (NCT03006926) for the
treatment of HCC. Recently, results from Study 117 (Phase Ib,
NCT03418922) showed marginally better results for lenvatinib
with nivolumab than lenvatinib with pembrolizumab. METmediated phosphorylation leads to a decreased expression of
PD-L1 using the combination of MET inhibitors tivantinib and
capmatinib, anti-PD1 and anti-PDL1 produced an additive effect
which slows the growth of HCCs in mice.134 Clinically, based on
the results from the experimental arm A of the GO 30140 study
(NCT02715531), the FDA approved atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as breakthrough therapy for untreated advanced or
metastatic HCC.135 Individual case studies also reported promising
results for the use of combined TKI and anti-PD1/PD-L1 agents for
advanced HCC.136–138 Such results were confirmed in the phase III
trial IMbrave 150 study (NCT03434379) which reported that
atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab resulted in better OS
and PFS than sorafenib in patients with unresectable HCC.139
Other combination therapies include Galunisertib with nivolumab
(NCT02423343), spartalizumab with and without capmatinib
(NCT02795429), FGF401 with spartalizumab (NCT02325739),
regorafenib with pembrolizumab (NCT03347292), cabozantinib
with nivolumab (NCT03299946), avelumab with axitinib
(NCT03289533), ramucirumab with durvalumab (NCT02572687),
and XL888 with pembrolizumab (NCT03095781; Table 1).
Immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) occur frequently during
treatment with ICIs and the clinical consequences can be
significant.140 Activation of the immune system leads to damage
of normal healthy tissues and IRAEs can have myriad effects and
involve a number of different organs and have been reported to
produce colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, myocarditis,
endocrine glands inflammation, and rheumatic and musculoskeletal phenotypes including inflammatory arthritis, arthralgia,
myositis, and sicca syndrome.141 Although the precise pathophysiology underlying the IRAEs side effects during treatment with
ICIs remains unknown, discontinuing administration and the use
of steroids is generally effective. In severe cases, however,
additional immunosuppressants may be required but based on
current available evidence, immunosuppression for IRAEs does not
appear to compromise the antitumor response to the ICI
treatment.142,143
Promising agents and treatment regimens
Despite abovementioned targeted drugs, novel agents have been
continuously under development (Table 2). Of note, apatinib, a
novel inhibitor of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase, has attracted considerable attention and there is now a significant body of work
describing clinical experience with its use. Although less effective
than sorafenib as a first-line treatment in a retrospective study,144
apatinib still displayed promising anti-tumor effects in sorafenibresistant HCC,145–147 where portal vein invasion was present,148
when metastases have occured,149,150 and for unresectable and
relapsed HCCs.151,152 Combination therapy in studies utilising
apatinib with TACE have achieved better clinical effectiveness
than TACE alone, with tolerable AEs.153–161 Recently, the
combination of apatinib with the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody
camrelizumab achieved partial response rates of 50%.153 The
results of other ongoing trials including the phase III trial
comparing TACE and apatinib with sorafenib as first-line treatment
for locally advanced or metastatic and unresectable HCC (NCT
03764293) and the adjuvant apatinib after hepatectomy for the
prevention of tumor recurrence (NCT03722875 and NCT03261791)
will hopefully prove effective and add to the presently available
therapeutic options.
These promising results have stimulated the investigation of
other new agents, the combinations of agents and regimens,
which have been thoroughly discussed in a recent review from
Zhu and Sun.154 The combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib
has been extensively evaluated as first-155 or second-line in
advanced HCCs,156–162 but unfortunately the heterogeneous
nature of the results precludes firm conclusions and recommendations. Recently, a single-arm meta-analysis of prospective
studies found that combination therapy with bevacizumab and
erlotinib used as second-line treatment was associated with a
favorable PFS (16 weeks, P = 0.012) and OS (12 months, P = 0.048),
suggesting that future well-designed and sufficiently powered
large-scale RCTs should be able to identify the potential
contribution of these agents.163
Targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma

Preclinical evidence for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) targeting
therapies in HCC has showed promise and supports their
investigation,164–166 especially with the potential ability to
abrogate the emergence of sorafenib resistance167 and sensitize
HCC to regorafenib treatment.168 A number of CKD inhibitors are
presently undergoing evaluation including palbociclib
(NCT01356628), milciclib (NCT03109886), and ribociclib
(NCT02524119). The anti-MET monoclonal antibody emibetuzumab exhibited the greatest antitumor activity in HCC when
combined with ramucirumab and had an excellent safety
profile169 and for HCC with high MET expression there was an
almost 3-fold increase in PFS (8.1 vs. 2.8 months) relative to those
with low MET expression, suggesting the potential for further
biomarker-driven clinical trials. Rigosertib is a synthetic benzyl
styryl sulfone small molecule inhibitor which has been used in the
treatment of monomyelocytic leukemia and due to its activity as a
RAS- and PLK1-signaling inhibitor, it was investigated in HCC
patients who demonstrate upregulation of PLK1 during tumor
development and HRAS expression in advanced HCC. High
expression levels of PLK1 are also significantly correlated with
poor patient survival and the multiple effects of rigosertib could
be beneficially employed to produce a therapeutic “dual-hit”
approach in selected patients.170 Donafenib is a novel multi-kinase
inhibitor which is similar to sorafenib, displaying comparable or
better safety and efficacy when treating advanced HCC in phase
1b trial and phase 3 studies using sorafenib as the control
(NCT02645981).171 There are ongoing trials evaluating novel
agents such as anlotinib, another multi-kinase inhibitor which is
orally administered and targets VEGFR, fibroblast growth factor
receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR),

and c-kit (NCT02809534). Tivozanib is another oral inhibitor of
VEGFR-1/2/3 with promising activity against HCC in vivo
(NCT01835223) and TRC105, which despite demonstrating clinical
activity and being well tolerated in HCC patients following
sorafenib, has not to date met prespecified criteria and its
development in HCC continues as combination therapy with
sorafenib (NCT02560779).
Biomarker-driven targeted therapy
Despite extensive research investigating potential biomarkers to aid
the development of protocols for the treatment of HCC, none have
so far been identified to be able to predict the effect of, or response
to treatment with sorafenib.172–182 Although the molecular
classification of HCC has been widely reported (Table 3) to date it
remains unclear whether this basic genomic and proteomic data
will prove valuable in guiding targeted therapies.183–190
The continued belief that the future lies with personalized
treatment which will be made possible through the rapid
developments in next generation sequencing and the precision
medicine that it underpins, have encouraged the development of
novel trial designs.191 These novel trials designs offer new hope
that biomarker-driven targeted therapies can be modulated and
tailored on an individual basis.192,193 Using the prospectively
archived tumor tissue and baseline plasma samples from HCC
patients receiving regorafenib in the RESORCE trial, it was found
the plasma miRNA panel and genetic mutational signatures in
tumors were able to predict the response to regorafenib.194 In
BIOSTORM, the biomarker companion study of STORM, multigene
signatures associated with improved RFS with adjuvant sorafenib
treatment after hepatectomy were identified and in the future
could be used to guide treatment protocols.195 This approach is
supported by case series where patients with CDKN2A-inactivating, CTNNB1-activating, PTEN-inactivating, and MET-activating
mutations received palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), celecoxib
(COX-2/Wnt inhibitor), sirolimus (mTOR inhibitor), and cabozantinib, respectively, with a reduction of des-gamma-carboxy
prothrombin and AFP following treatment.196
Approaches to developing biomarker-driven targeted therapy
strategies have also been examined in vitro and inactivating
mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 have been shown to confer sensitivity
to the mTOR protein. Aurora kinases are known to be oncogenic
and overexpressed in a variety of tumors including colon, breast
and prostate cancer and HCC tumor and other genetic mutations
are known to affect the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and
amplification of the MET gene is associated with hypersensitivity
to cabozantinib which inhibits the tyrosine kinases c-Met and
VEGFR2.197,198 The Wnt/β-catenin and Akt/mTOR pathways have
been investigated and are reported to be co-activated in 14.4% of
HCCs with the result that inhibition of the Jak/Stat pathway has
therapeutic potential.199 Considering the wide range and type of
genetic alterations which may act as potential targets,185 it is
reasonable to believe that with an appropriate and well-designed
trial protocol it should be possible to identify and validate specific
biomarkers which will predict the response to specific targeted
agents. Thus, we can prevent the use of treatments which can
have no therapeutic effect, and may be associated with significant,
avoidable toxicity.
Drug resistance of targeted therapy for HCC
Drug resistance remains the principle cause of treatment failure
during the use of targeted therapies200 and tumor heterogeneity
and clonal evolution are the underlying mechanisms (Fig. 2), with
the former mainly involved in primary resistance and the later
acquired resistance.201 HCC is a remarkably heterogeneous
disease exhibiting inter-patient heterogeneity, intertumoral heterogeneity among multifocal tumors and intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) within tumors. This heterogeneity explains the
attraction of targeted therapies and the search for biomarkers
which can reliably predict the response to different agents.
Nevertheless, it is also clear that the potential for this degree of
heterogeneity renders the task of identifying single useful
biomarkers or combinations of biomarkers extremely complex.
On the other hand, the heterogeneity that has been identified
does explain the, often quite dramatic, differences in the response
to different therapeutic agents or combinations of agents.
Unlike other primary cancers, multifocal lesions in liver is not
uncommon whether derived from synchronous carcinogenesis or
intrahepatic metastases. When multiple tumors occur, despite the
fact that they originate from genetically similar cells and the
potential etiology is the same, the lesions differ significantly (often
very significantly) from each other demonstrating genomic
alterations, varied biological behavior and loco-regional tumor
microenvironment diversity which produces the well described
differences in response to therapeutic agents.202,203 Within the
tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) has been found at
genomic,204 epigenetic,205 transcriptional206, and protein
level.207,208 Considering the level and extent of the intratumoral
heterogeneity it is not surprising that the response to single
treatment is equally heterogenous and irrespective of the efficacy
of a single agent the most favorable outcome that can be
reasonably expected is the eradication of a small portion of the
total tumor cell burden leaving resistant clones surviving and
responsible for progression.209 Although trunk mutational events
in HCC are less heterogeneous210 and it is reported that single
region sample could effectively recapitulate the genomic or
proteomic features of HCC,211–213 which seems to shed light on
overcoming drug resistance by ITH, tumor evolution due to
selective pressure from targeted therapy brings new challenges.214 Thus, we have to find new ways to circumvent tumor
heterogeneity and tumor evolution.
Fortunately, several novel techniques including single-cell
sequencing, liquid biopsy, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA),
patient-derived cell-lines (PDC), patient-derived organoid (PDO),
and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) should enable us to track
cancer evolution in HCC. Compared with bulk tumor tissue
sequencing, single-cell sequencing provides higher sensitivity and

specificity, delineating tumor biology and characterization of
cancer stem cell heterogeneity to understand the cellular diversity
of HCC.215 Single-cell whole-genome sequencing has been used
to examine the diverse modes of clonal evolution in HCC and
relate this to tumor morphology. Variations are seen to occur early
in tumor development but subsequently demonstrate stability
during tumor progression. These findings suggest that treatment
strategies could be developed based on the knowledge of tumor
morphology.216
ctDNA represents a non-invasive, dynamic method to profile
the tumor genome, predict treatment response, monitor disease
progression, and help elucidate the mechanisms of drug
resistance.217 In gastrointestinal cancers, ctDNA has been shown
to outperform single-lesion tumor biopsies in discovering alterations which produce clinically relevant resistance and the
mechanisms responsible for resistance to multiple agents.218
Novel alterations and parallel evolution which result in treatmentassociated resistance are common in ctDNA, although the
occurrence of multiple treatment related alterations in the
circulation confound attempts to integrate the results into clinical
protocols.219 When tumor biopsies are not available genetic
profiling is possible using ctDNA which can provide a similar level
of accuracy in respect of identifying somatic mutations and has
the added advantage of being able to also detect de novo
mutations.220 To date, few studies had examined the value of
ctDNA to guide targeted therapy in HCC patients although
preliminary results have demonstrated the feasibility of ctDNA in
circumventing ITH,212 delineating tumor evolution,221,222 efficiently capturing mutations indicative of targeted therapy,196,223
and dynamically revealing genomic change during pharmacological treatment.224
Other approaches to understand the evolution of HCC and the
mechanisms which underly the resistance to targeted therapy
include next generation sequencing, the use of cancer organoids
(PDOs) and PDX. PDO and PDX closely mimic hepatocarcinogenesis and preserve the tumor microenvironment making them
excellent preclinical models for drug screening, biomarker
development and research into the alterations and mechanism
responsible for drug resistance.225–227 An example of this
approach is our recent study using a patient-derived xenograft
where we established 103 stable and transplantable xenograft
lines that could be serially passaged, cryopreserved and revived.
These lines maintained the diversity of HCC and the essential
features of the original specimens at the histological, transcriptome, proteomic, and genomic levels. Using this model, we
explored the predictive markers for sorafenib response and found
that mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP3K1)
might play an important role in sorafenib resistance and sorafenib
response is impaired in patients with MAP3K1 downexpression.228 The combination of ctDNA sampling, next generation sequencing and PDX modeling has been applied to the
clinical management of melanoma and facilitated personalized
treatment.229 This approach using combinations of investigative
techniques may also be applicable in the management of HCC
and allow us to improve our understanding of the problems and
opportunities for targeted therapy, tumor clonal evolution and
interactions and facilitate the implementation of precision,
personalized treatment (Fig. 3).
Unsolved issues in targeted therapy for HCC
Several issues remain to be determined in the near future (Fig. 4).
The best treatment strategy is still not clear, especially which
targeted agent is the most appropriate for a specific HCC patient
cohort. In the past, patients were faced with the harsh reality of
knowing that other than sorafenib no therapeutic candidates were
available. Today, a number of first and second-line options are
available to clinicians. But in real-world medicine and most health
care systems around the world, the majority of oncologist have to
take into account the economic consequences before prescribing
a particular treatment. Medical reimbursement or economic issues
unfortunately remains an unavoidable consideration which
influences decisions about treatment and the lack of our ability
to provide clear guidance in respect of targeted treatment due to
the myriad issues producing resistance to most therapies (vide
supra) further complicates these decisions. We propose that the
discovery and validation of novel biomarkers to reliably predict
the response to treatment and define suitable candidates for a
specific targeted agent, improving response rates and limiting
avoidable toxicity in those who are unlikely to benefit, should be
the focus of future HCC research.
In the clinical setting, we should ensure that we adhere to
established treatment protocols particularly in respect of sequential targeted therapies or when a change of therapeutic agent is
indicated. It is not uncommon for patients to be switched from

sorafenib to lenvatinib, from regorafenib to lenvatinib, or from
sorafenib to lenvatinib and to regorafenib when drug resistance
develops, and these changes may be instigated by an oncologist
or the patient themselves. While many patients do clearly benefit
from these treatment changes, there is no evidence base
underpinning many of these changes and this practice is
undesirable as it confounds data collection at best and potentially
exposes the responsible clinician to criticism especially where
serious adverse events occur.
CONCLUSION
An iterative approach to targeted therapy has provided a wealth
of data and encouraging results particularly in those patients
where resistance to sorafenib develops. Although the understanding and management of HCC has changed dramatically due
to the extensive basic and clinical research which has occurred
over the last decade, HCC sadly remains a devastating disease
which has a ubiquitous, enormous impact on health care systems
across the world. The advances over this period however mean
that patients can be comforted by the knowledge that there is a
huge international effort underway from oncologists, hepatologists, and basic scientists to fully understand the mechanisms
which are providing more rapid progress and ensure that the
prognosis continues to improve.
