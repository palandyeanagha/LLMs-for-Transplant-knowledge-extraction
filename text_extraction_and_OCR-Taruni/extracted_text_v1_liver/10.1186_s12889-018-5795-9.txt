Abstract
Background: Evidence-based behavioral weight loss interventions are under-utilized. To inform efforts to increase
uptake of these interventions, it is important to understand the perspectives of adults with obesity regarding
barriers and facilitators of weight loss intervention initiation.
Methods: We conducted a qualitative study in adults with obesity who had recently attempted weight loss either
with assistance from an evidence-based behavioral intervention (intervention initiators) or without use of a formal
intervention (intervention non-initiators). We recruited primary care patients, members of a commercial weight loss
program, and members of a Veterans Affairs weight loss program. Intervention initiators and non-initiators were
interviewed separately using a semi-structured interview guide that asked participants about barriers and facilitators
of weight loss intervention initiation. Conversations were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed with
qualitative content analysis. Two researchers used open coding to generate the code book on a subset of
transcripts and a single researcher coded remaining transcripts. Codes were combined into subthemes, which were
combined in to higher order themes. Intervention initiators and non-initiators were compared.
Results: We conducted three focus groups with participants who had initiated interventions (n = 26) and three
focus groups (n = 24) and 8 individual interviews with participants who had not initiated interventions. Intervention
initiators and non-initiators were, respectively, 65% and 37.5% white, 62% and 63% female, mean age of 55 and
54 years old, and mean BMI of 34 kg/m2
. Three themes were identified. One theme was practical factors, with
subthemes of reasonable cost and scheduling compatibility. A second theme was anticipated effectiveness of
intervention, with subthemes of intervention content addressing individual needs; social aspects influencing
effectiveness; and evaluating evidence of effectiveness. A third theme was anticipated pleasantness of intervention,
with subthemes of social aspects influencing enjoyment; anticipated dietary and tracking prescriptions; and identity
and self-reliance factors. Different perspectives were identified from intervention initiators and non-initiators.
Conclusions: Strategies to engage individuals in evidence-based weight loss interventions can be developed using
these results. Strategies could target individuals’ perceived barriers and benefits to initiating interventions, or could
focus on refining interventions to appeal to more individuals.

Background
Lifestyle interventions that include a focus on dietary
change, increasing physical activity, and behavioral strategies can produce clinically significant weight loss and
improve quality of life [1–3] and therefore are recommended in current obesity guidelines [4]. However,
nationally representative data suggest that only a small
portion of adults with obesity (< 10%) use weight loss interventions [5]. Even in settings where interventions are readily available at low or no cost, a large majority of eligible
individuals do not take the first step of initiating weight
loss interventions [6–8]. Low initiation of evidence-based
weight loss interventions limits the ability of these interventions to impact population-level weight [9, 10].
To increase initiation of evidence-based weight loss
interventions among adults with obesity, facilitators of
and barriers to initiating interventions must be identified. There is substantial literature focused on attrition
from weight loss interventions [11, 12], however, this literature is of limited value for addressing intervention
initiation because the factors that lead to intervention
initiation may be different from those that lead to
discontinuation. Indeed, several theoretical models of
behavior change differentiate between factors involved in
initiation and maintenance of behavior [13, 14]. For
example, Rothman suggests that initiation of a health
behavior is determined primarily by favorable expectations about outcomes of behavior change, whereas maintenance of behavior is determined by satisfaction with
achieved outcomes [13]. Another body of literature
focuses on the facilitators of and barriers to engaging in
the weight loss behaviors of dietary change and exercise
(independent of intervention use). However, this literature is limited in its ability to address reasons for initiating weight loss interventions; joining a weight loss
intervention involves many elements in addition to dietary change and exercise (e.g., group meetings, prescriptions to track food) and therefore likely has distinctive
barriers and benefits.
We are aware of three studies that specifically address
barriers to weight loss intervention initiation [15–17]. All
asked participants to endorse items from a list of potential
barriers to intervention use. These studies revealed some
potentially important intervention barriers, such as cost,
stigma, concerns about group format, and concerns about
intervention effectiveness. However, because these studies
used close-ended surveys, they did not provide participants the opportunity to identify barriers outside of those
queried about by the researchers; thus, it is possible that
important barriers are missing from this research. The use
of close-ended surveys in these studies also limits the details available about the identified barriers, decreasing the
usefulness of this information for developing approaches
to address low treatment initiation. For example, one
study identified negative feelings towards interventions as
a barrier to intervention use, but did not specify the nature or source of those negative feelings [15]. Additionally,
these previous studies did not focus on the potential benefits of interventions. Obtaining information on what
adults with obesity see as the benefits of interventions will
be crucial to inform strategies to increase intervention initiation among this population. Thus, in the current study,
we aimed to describe the range of reasons that adults with
obesity provide for initiating or not initiating
evidence-based behavioral weight loss interventions. To
do this, we conducted focus groups with individuals who
had recently chosen to try to lose weight with the assistance of evidence-based behavioral interventions (“intervention initiators”) or without the assistance of any formal
intervention (“intervention non-initiators”).
Methods
Design, setting, population, and recruitment
We used a stratified purposeful sampling approach. We
conducted one-time focus groups with intervention initiators who had chosen to initiate behavioral weight loss
interventions in the past year and separate groups with
intervention non-initiators who had not used any weight
loss interventions for at least the past 5 years. Focus groups
were used because the topic was initially perceived not to
be sensitive in nature, and because focus groups offer
greater convenience. We additionally conducted individual
interviews with intervention non-initiators to allow us to go
in to greater depth about topics that were raised during the
focus groups and to see if other themes would emerge
given the additional privacy afforded by interviews. Initiator
and non-initiator focus groups were conducted separately
given that the different experiences of the participants with
regard to weight loss interventions necessitated that some
questions differ between the two groups.
Participants were recruited from an academically-affiliated primary care clinic; a commercial weight loss intervention center (Weight Watchers); and the VA-based weight
loss intervention program called MOVE!, all in Durham,
NC. Intervention non-initiators were recruited from the
primary care setting and intervention initiators from all
three settings. Weight Watchers and the VA MOVE! program were selected as recruitment sites because they are
evidence-based programs [6, 18, 19] that represent different
intervention approaches and cater to different populations.
Evidence-based intervention was defined using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
Task Force 2013 guidelines for the management of overweight and obesity in adults [4]. In particular, we considered an intervention to be evidence-based if it contained
components focused on diet, physical activity, and behavioral strategies and was conducted by a trained interventionist and provided opportunity for repeated sessions.
McVay et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:854 Page 2 of 11

Among other differences between the two programs from
which we recruited, participation in the VA MOVE! Weight
Management Program generally required a provider referral
at the time of our study, whereas Weight Watchers did not.
To identify primary care patients, electronic health records were used to extract contact information of patients
who met eligibility criteria for age, BMI, and contraindications to weight loss, and who had a primary care appointment in the previous 2 months. These patients were sent
an informational letter and were proactively called for further screening if they did not opt out. Participants recruited at weight loss programs were informed of the
study via an announcement at the beginning of a class and
were called by telephone for screening if they gave permission and contact information.
Inclusion criteria included age 18–70 and BMI ≥ 30 kg/
m2 based on self-reported weight and height. Because we
were interested in why individuals attempt weight loss with
assistance from an evidence-based comprehensive intervention versus attempt weight loss on their own without formal assistance, we excluded people who had made no
weight loss attempt in the past year (i.e., those who
responded negatively to “Have you tried to lose weight in
the past year by changing your diet or physical activity
level?”). We focused on the past year so that participants
would be more likely to recall their experience of choosing
to use or not use a weight loss program. Exclusion criteria
included conditions contraindicated for weight loss (e.g.,
pregnancy, cancer in past year) or bariatric surgery in past
year. An additional inclusion criterion for intervention initiators was that they had used an evidence-based formal
weight loss intervention in the past year (with
evidence-based intervention defined according to clinical
guidelines presented above). Individuals were eligible if they
used a group or individual format interventions. Intervention non-initiators were required to have no use of
evidence-based formal interventions in the past 5 years. A
five-year time frame was selected to create a clear distinction between intervention initiators and non-initiators.
Procedures
Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted on
the academic medical center campus. Group discussions
lasted approximately 90 min, and individual interviews
lasted about 30 min. Groups and individual interviews were
moderated by the first author, who had no clinical relationship with participants. All focus groups and interviews were
audio recorded and later transcribed. We planned a priori
to conduct three focus groups for initiators and three for
non-initiators, and then to evaluate if this number of
groups was sufficient to achieve informational redundancy
and conduct more as needed. At the end of each focus
group and interview, two authors reviewed themes that
emerged. No new themes were raised in the third wave of
groups, indicating saturation had been reached. However,
we elected to conduct individual interviews of
non-intervention initiators after considering that participants might be reluctant to share in a focus group setting
their concerns about group-based interventions. We determined that saturation was reached by the end of eight interviews and thus did not conduct more.
A semi-structured moderator script was used to guide
discussion (see Additional file 1 for script). This script was
developed based on a qualitative content analysis approach,
a method for interpreting textual data through a systematic
classification process [20]. The moderator script for initiators and non-initiators differed as a consequence of the different histories these groups had with weight loss
interventions. We began the non-initiator discussions by
asking what led participants to try to lose weight in the past
year without intervention. We then provided a definition of
evidence-based intervention. We asked them to think about
evidence-based interventions delivered in a group setting
and to discuss what it would take for them to join such a
program as well as what concerns they might have about
doing so. We chose to focus on group format interventions
given that they are the most common and often most
cost-effective intervention approach. We also asked about
telephone and internet-based treatments, but that data is
not presented here.
We began the initiator groups by asking them to discuss
what led them to join a weight loss intervention. When it
was not spontaneously addressed, we probed about the role
of learning more about diet, physical activity, social support,
and motivation. We also asked the initiator groups what
barriers they had to overcome before joining a program.
For initiators and non-initiators, we next queried about
the following specific barriers to intervention based on past
research in the areas of behavioral intervention initiation,
weight management more generally, and the authors’ experiences: embarrassment discussing weight, interacting with
others, time/scheduling conflicts [16, 17], cost [17], support
from family/friends [21], intervention asking them to do
things they do not wish to do (self-monitoring, exercising more than they want to) [22], and who would
lead the intervention. The moderator guide was created by two study authors and was reviewed by other
study authors. We pilot-tested the guide with a small
focus group (data not analyzed) and refined the interview guide by re-wording and re-ordering questions
before collecting the data reported herein.
Data analysis
A conventional content analysis approach was used to
analyze the data [20]. Focus group and individual data
were analyzed with the same approach and presented together, consistent with the study goal of generating as
many perspectives as possible. All transcripts were
McVay et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:854 Page 3 of 11

placed into qualitative data management software
(Atlas.ti, Version 7.5). Two coders with backgrounds in
social and clinical psychology independently coded the
first transcript using open coding, allowing codes to
emerge from the data, then compared and reconciled
codes. They repeated this procedure for approximately
60% of the transcripts in order to develop a taxonomy of
consensus codes. The coding scheme was then applied
to the remaining transcripts by a single coder. After
reviewing codes, both coders identified subthemes that
emerged from the codes and higher-order themes emerging from the subthemes. A matrix was created to compare presence of specific codes by intervention initiation
status for each subtheme. Quotes in this manuscript
(provided in tables) were chosen to be illustrative of the
subthemes.
Results
Participants
Three intervention initiator groups were conducted with
24 total participants (group sizes: 5, 9, and 10). Three
intervention non-initiator groups were conducted with 26
total participants (group sizes: 6, 9, and 11). In addition, 8
non-initiator participants completed individual interviews.
Thus, there were 58 participants in total (24 intervention
initiators and 34 non-initiators).
Participants had a mean age of 54–55 years, mean
BMI of 34 kg/m2
, were predominantly female and college educated or higher (Table 1). Intervention initiators
were predominantly white, whereas non-initiators were
predominantly African American (Table 1).
The perspectives on barriers and benefits of initiation
of evidence-based weight loss interventions were classified into three higher-order themes, each with several
subthemes.
Practical factors
One higher-order theme identified was practical factors.
This theme included the subthemes of reasonable costs
and scheduling compatibility (See Table 2 for summary).
Reasonable costs
Both intervention initiators and non-initiators reported
that intervention entry was facilitated by having the

ability to afford an intervention, either on their own or
through insurance or workplace programs. Intervention
initiators, but not non-initiators, reported that intervention entry was favored as a result of money saved due to
changing their eating habits as a result of joining the intervention (e.g. via reducing restaurant eating) offsetting the
costs of the intervention. Intervention non-initiators indicated that if the cost appeared reasonable in relation to
the expected effectiveness, intervention entry would be
facilitated. Non-initiators also indicated that being unable
to afford the intervention was a potential barrier to intervention entry.
Scheduling compatibility
Both intervention initiators and non-initiators reported
that compatibility of the intervention schedule with other
obligations favored initiation, as did flexibility in scheduling intervention sessions (e.g., availability of classes at different times of day without the requirement to commit to
specific class). For both initiators and non-initiators, anticipation of incompatibility with their schedule favored
non-initiation. Intervention non-initiators stated that
short intervention sessions would be a facilitator to intervention entry.
Anticipated effectiveness of intervention
The second theme was anticipated effectiveness of intervention. Individuals’ decisions to initiate interventions
were influenced by their perceptions of how effective it
would be in helping them achieve weight loss. Subthemes identified that contributed to their perceptions
of intervention’s anticipated effectiveness were: 1) how
the content of interventions would address their needs,
2) how social aspects of interventions enhance intervention effectiveness, and 3) their evaluation of the evidence
of interventions’ effectiveness (See Table 3 for summary).
Intervention’s content addresses needs
Both intervention initiators and non-initiators reported
that intervention entry was facilitated by the desire to
learn behavioral strategies and a desire to gain useful information about nutrition. Intervention initiators reported that their decision to enter an intervention was
positively influenced by the intervention they selected
having a limited focus on physical activity. On the other
hand, non-initiators identified a focus on physical activity as favoring intervention initiation. They shared their
perception that physical activity is important to weight
loss; some reported believing that physical activity alone
was enough to lose weight.
Both initiators and non-initiators commented on the
individualization of intervention content, but from different perspectives. Initiators identified individualization
as a factor that favored their entry in to intervention.
For example, an intervention initiator reported that the
ability to obtain personalized dietary suggestions contributed to her decision to initiate an intervention (notably, she was enrolled in a one-on-one program). For
intervention non-initiators, concern that content would
not be individualized or match their specific life situation was identified as favoring non-initiation of interventions. Related to this, non-initiators expressed the
perception that interventions would not offer anything
that was not already known to them, or that they could
not learn or do on their own.
Intervention’s social aspects enhance perceived
effectiveness
Some intervention initiators and non-initiators felt that
a group format enhances weight loss success through
support and affirmation from others who are having
similar experiences. Both initiators and non-initiators
also reported that having a group or an intervention

leader also facilitated intervention entry by offering accountability, e.g., intervention leaders and/or group
members who would be aware of and track their successes and struggles. Initiators and non-initiators also reported that a group format could offer learning
opportunities, such as when group members share their
weight loss strategies or recipes. Additionally, both initiators and non-initiator participants reported that a
group-based weight loss program would be appealing to
them because they could motivate themselves by viewing
weight loss as a competition with other group members.
Evaluating evidence of effectiveness
Intervention initiators and non-initiators reported that
learning of a scientific evidence base for an intervention
would increase their trust in a intervention’s effectiveness, and thus would favor intervention initiation. Both
groups also reported that intervention initiation would
be favored by obtaining a recommendation to join intervention by a trusted health care provider. Intervention
initiators and non-initiators described how observing
others’ experiences with weight loss and their own past
experience with weight loss efforts influenced their perception of initiating an intervention, with some difference in these observations between initiators and
non-initiators (see Table 3 for additional details).
Intervention initiators, but not non-initiators, reported that intervention entry was favored when a
weight loss intervention program had been operating
for a prolonged period, thus increasing their confidence in its effectiveness. Non-initiators reported that
entry to interventions was negatively influenced by
skepticism of some claims made by interventions,
particularly when the presenter of the claims may
have motives to be dishonest, such as a desire to
profit from an intervention.

Anticipated pleasantness of interventions
The third theme was anticipated pleasantness of interventions. The decision to enter an intervention was reported
as being influenced by perceptions of how pleasant or unpleasant the experience of the intervention would be. Subthemes identified that contributed to the perceived
pleasantness included 1) social aspects influencing pleasantness, 2) intervention’s dietary and tracking prescriptions, and 3) identity and view of self-reliance as it relates
to intervention use (see Table 4 for summary).
Social aspects influencing enjoyment
Both intervention initiators and non-initiators reported
that starting an intervention alongside someone they
know could make initiating intervention more pleasant,
favoring intervention entry. Although both initiators and
non-initiators described positive aspects of accountability (discussed above with regard to intervention effectiveness), participants in both groups also reported that
accountability could be a barrier to intervention initiation by impacting their anticipated enjoyment of an
intervention. Specifically, they reported that having
others monitoring their progress presented a risk of
disappointing others, causing them embarrassment, and
feeling judged.
Intervention initiators, but not non-initiators, reported
that intervention initiation was facilitated by use of strategies to manage anxiety related to the social aspects of the
group. Examples included using a “pep talk” to manage
anxiety about group setting, purposefully selecting a program that they believed would have a non-judgmental
approach, and selecting a program that did not require
them to talk in a group format. For initiators, a potential
barrier to initiation was frustration with the interactions
with some group members, for example, individuals who
dominate the group discussion or who share things that
are off-topic. Also favoring non-initiation among intervention initiators was concern about competition among
group members, which some participants felt would be intimidating and discouraging (in contrast to other members who found competition to favor intervention entry
due to possible increase in intervention effectiveness,
noted previously).
Barriers to intervention entry reported by intervention
non-initiators include not relating to other group members and concern that they would have to share sensitive

or potentially embarrassing information in a group setting (e.g., discussing gastrointestinal issues).
Anticipated dietary and monitoring prescription
Both initiators and non-initiators reported that an intervention that prescribed specific foods that they disliked,
or that required foods to be eaten at certain times (e.g.
requiring breakfast), would be a barrier to intervention
entry. Intervention initiators, but not non-initiators, reported that intervention initiation was facilitated by a
willingness to rearrange their personal schedule to fit demands of food preparation, such as coming home from
work early to prepare food. Initiators also reported that
intervention entry was facilitated by an approach to food
that was compatible with their family life (e.g., that
allowed them to share meals with their family). Finally,
intervention initiators reported that initiation was favored when interventions offered an approach to food
that would not contribute to feeling deprived, for example, by allowing them to continue to eat their favorite
foods.
Non-initiators reported that intervention entry would
be favored if interventions had an approach to food that
was quick, easy, and convenient (e.g., pre-packaged
food). Non-initiators also reported that a barrier to
intervention entry was anticipating that the intervention
would require tracking food, and particularly, that it
would require a complicated approach to tracking. Related to this, intervention initiators reported that an approach to dietary tracking that is simple and easy
favored intervention entry.
Identity and self-reliance factors
Both initiators and non-initiators reported that a barrier
to intervention entry was embarrassment that they could
not lose weight on their own. Related to this, intervention initiators reported that intervention entry was facilitated when they accepted that they needed help losing
weight. Intervention non-initiators reported that another
barrier to initiating an intervention was a desire to avoid
reliance on others and concerns about having their autonomy compromised. Additionally, non-initiators described concerns that intervention initiation would be
inconsistent with their identity.
Discussion
Effective interventions to help individuals lose weight are
underutilized. Only a few previous studies have examined
the perspectives of adults with obesity on barriers and
benefits to weight loss intervention initiation [15–17], and
those studies queried participants about a narrow range of
possible barriers to intervention use and did not address
potential benefits of intervention use. In the current study,
we aimed to describe the breadth of benefits and barriers
to initiating evidence-based weight loss interventions as
perceived by a diverse sample of adults with obesity who
have recently tried to lose weight, either with or without
the help of a formal weight loss intervention. Our data revealed several novel facilitators and barriers to intervention initiation and identified potential differences in
perspectives between intervention initiators and
non-initiators.
Reasons for intervention initiation reported by participants were aggregated in to the broad themes of practical factors, anticipated intervention effectiveness, and
anticipated pleasantness of interventions. The theme anticipated effectiveness of intervention related to participants’ sense for how well an intervention would work
for them, and the factors that influenced that. This
theme has some conceptual overlap with constructs
from several theoretical models, including perceived benefits of health behavior from the Health Belief Model
[23] and outcome expectancies from Social Cognitive
Theory [24]. Anticipated effectiveness was also suggested
as a determinant of intervention initiation by past research. Specifically, Tinker and Tucker found that the
most highly cited barrier to intervention initiation was the
belief that individuals could lose weight as well on their
own as with an intervention [15]. However, that study,
and existing theory, do not provide information on what
factors influence perceptions of effectiveness. In this study,
we found that intervention initiation is favored when content is perceived to be individualized and addresses individuals’ perceived needs; when social aspects of an
intervention that are perceived to increase intervention effectiveness are present (such as a leader to increase accountability); and when sources of evidence for an
intervention’s effectiveness are trustworthy (such as a recommendation by a health care provider). There was some
evidence of a potential difference between initiators and
non-initiators in perceptions of intervention effectiveness.
Of particular note, non-initiators were concerned that
intervention would not be individualized or would not
offer them any new information, whereas initiators, who
predominantly enrolled in group-based interventions, did
not express this concern.
Anticipated pleasantness of interventions also emerged
as a theme from our data. This theme primarily focused
on negative experiences that individuals anticipate with
interventions. There is some conceptual overlap of this
theme with The Health Belief Model construct perceived
barriers to health behavior. Negative or unpleasant experiences have also been identified as a barrier to dietary
change or intervention in past empirical literature. For
example, Burke et al. reported that some weight loss
intervention participants found self-monitoring burdensome [22] and numerous studies report that taste preferences can be a barrier to changing diet [25, 26].
McVay et al. BMC Public Health (2018) 18:854 Page 8 of 11

Additionally, Ciao et al. [16] identified shame and
stigma as barriers to weight loss intervention use in a
small portion of their participants. However, the
current study provides a fuller picture of the potential
unpleasant experiences that concern intervention initiators and non-initiators. Unpleasant experiences of
concern included discomfort with social aspects of
intervention (e.g., fear of judgement), dislike of anticipated dietary recommendations, and worry about
needing to disclose sensitive information in a group.
Whereas past research identified that dietary tracking
and eating less preferred foods could be viewed negatively [22, 25, 26], the current study is the first to our
knowledge to identify the role of dietary monitoring
and taste preferences as potential barriers to initiating
interventions. We also found that differences emerged
between intervention initiators and non-initiators
related to anticipated pleasantness. For example,
non-initiators reported a desire to avoid relying on
others for weight loss and to maintain their autonomy, whereas initiators reported that intervention initiation was facilitated when they recognized a need to
get help in order to lose weight.
We also identified practical factors as a theme.
Practical barriers such as cost have been identified in
previous studies on intervention use barriers [16, 17]
and these factors are consistent with the construct
perceived barriers of health behavior within the
Health Belief Model.
These results may inform strategies for increasing initial engagement in weight loss interventions. Two distinct approaches to increasing intervention initiation can
be informed by results of the current study. First, intervention-focused approaches involve changing some aspect of an intervention to increase the chances of
initiation. For example, a barrier to intervention entry
described by some of our participants was intensive dietary tracking, which is common in evidence-based
programs. Interventions that offer simpler tracking
approaches may be more appealing to some patients.
Previous research suggests that simpler self-monitoring
approaches can be effective for increasing adherence and
weight loss [27, 28], suggesting that offering approaches
that utilize these simpler self-monitoring methods might
be valuable for increasing intervention uptake. As another example, our results suggest that some individuals
are seeking a physical activity-focused approach to
weight loss and are not drawn to existing interventions
that primarily focus on diet. Greater intervention enrollment might result if intervention options were available
that placed greater emphasis on physical activity. It is
notable that some individuals’ intervention preferences,
such as greater emphasis on physical activity or less dietary tracking, may make the intervention less effective.
Potentially, offering interventions that are less effective
than the gold-standard intervention approach (while still
more effective than no intervention) could increase
population weight loss if the greater uptake offsets the
lower weight loss per person.
The other potential set of approaches to increasing intervention entry are individual-focused approaches, which
focus on addressing individual barriers and facilitators to
entering existing evidence-based interventions. For example, some non-initiators felt that they already knew
everything that an intervention would tell them. Thus,
when communicating to individuals interested in losing
weight, it may be important to communicate that an intervention is valuable for providing motivation and support,
rather than just knowledge. Efforts to increase initiation
could involve providing education on the evidence for relatively greater importance of diet compared to physical activity for weight loss. Given the variability we observed in
intervention preferences and barriers to interventions, offering several types of interventions, or interventions that
can be customized on important dimensions, may lead to
greater uptake.
There are several limitations to this study. Although
we compared initiators and non-initiators, there were
some differences in the prompts that were used between
the two groups, due to differences in their history of
intervention use. Our intervention non-initiator group
included people who may have used an intervention
more than 5 years ago; different results might be obtained with only individuals who have never used intervention. Because our interview script asked specifically
about group-based interventions, our data may not have
captured factors that would differentially affect the decision to enter a one-on-one intervention. Individuals not
represented in our study, such as those who attended
one-on-one programs, may have perspectives that we
did not observe in this study.
Finally, although there is some evidence that intervention initiation differs by race and gender [29–31], this
study was not designed to examine gender and racial or
ethnic differences. It is notable that a few of the factors
relevant to intervention initiation identified in this study
differ across races in the general US population, and
thus could contribute to racial differences in intervention initiation. In particular, we identified that obtaining
a referral from a trusted health care provider could facilitate intervention entry; given that African Americans
on average report greater distrust of health care professionals [32], lower trust may contribute to racial differences in intervention initiation. Similarly, we identified
cost as a barrier to intervention entry; given mean differences in wealth between African Americans and white
Americans, this cost barrier could also contribute to racial differences in intervention use.

Conclusions
Greater initiation of weight loss interventions may be
achieved by addressing the factors identified in this study
among individuals who are trying to lose weight without interventions. Tailored approaches to increasing intervention
initiation may provide the most benefit given observed
variability in facilitators and barriers to intervention entry.
