Abstract
Purpose of Review The choice of optimum transplant in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and chronic kidney
disease stage V (CKD V) is not clear. The purpose of this review was to investigate this in more detail—in particular the choice
between a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) and living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT), including
recent evidence, to aid clinicians and their patients in making an informed choice in their care.
Recent Findings Analyses of large databases have recently shown SPKT to have better survival rates than a LDKT in the longterm, despite an early increase in morbidity and mortality in SPKT recipients. This survival advantage has only been shown in
those SPKT recipients with a functioning pancreas and not those who had early pancreas graft loss.
Summary The choice of SPKT or LDKT should not be based on patient and graft survival outcomes alone. Individual
patient circumstances, preferences, and comorbidities, among other factors should form an important part of the
decision-making process. In general, an SPKT should be considered in those patients not on dialysis and LDKT in
those nearing or already on dialysis.

Introduction
Patients with T1DM and CKD V currently have the following
transplant options—a deceased donor kidney transplant
(DDKT), LDKT, or SPKT. That kidney transplantation offers
significant survival benefit over remaining on dialysis is now
well established [1]. Similarly, LDKT offers significant advantage over DDKT in terms of graft and patient survival [2, 3].
When it comes to comparing SPKT with LDKT, evidence is
less convincing of the advantage of one over the other. There
are no randomized controlled trials for any form of
transplantation in this cohort of patients. Large registry
studies have shown contradictory results between these
two modalities of transplantation. This review aims to examine the evidence for these two modalities of transplant
in further detail, to aid clinicians in making an informed
choice of the most appropriate mode of transplant with
their individual patients.
SPKT Versus LDKT—Graft and Patient Survival
Outcomes
Pancreas transplant outcomes have improved in recent times
due to advanced surgical techniques [4] and better immunosuppression [5]. However, early mortality (within 90 days) is
still significantly higher in SPKT than in LDKT or DDKT.
This is due to the more complex procedure and the complications associated with it [6, 7]. In spite of this, studies have
shown long-term survival benefits with SPKT compared to
DDKT [8]. With regard to SPKT versus LDKT, the evidence
is less clear. Morath et al. showed that long-term survival was
better in SPKT than LDKT during years 10–18 after transplant [9] This survival benefit was because of less

cardiovascular death and was noted specifically in those recipients with a functional pancreas at 10 years, indicating the
benefit of long-term glycemic control in SPKT. In contrast,
Young et al. demonstrated in a large OPTN/UNOS analysis
that LDKT was associated with lower risk of death and graft
loss [10]. This could have been due to the shorter follow-up in
this study of 72 months, which may have introduced a bias
against SPKT due to its higher early mortality risk as compared to LDKT. A recent analysis of the UK registry showed
that there was no overall difference in patient survival in the
two groups. However, those SPKT recipients with a functioning pancreas graft at 90 days had significantly better patient
survival and similar kidney graft survival to LDKT recipients
[11••]. It also demonstrated that LDKT was an independent
predictor of improved kidney graft survival compared to
SPKT. Similarly, other recent studies have highlighted the
importance of early pancreas allograft survival to long-term
outcomes. In a study of SPKT wait-listed patients, Weiss et al.
showed that those patients who underwent surgery and had a
functional pancreas at 12 months, had significantly better survival outcome over the following 7 years than those who had
lost the pancreas early but still had a functioning kidney. This
advantage was seen even over the group that received a
LDKT. The group that suffered early pancreas loss showed a
survival rate mirroring that of DDKT [12]. This is not surprising as loss of pancreas essentially leaves the SPKT recipient
with a DDKT, outcomes of which are inferior to both SPKT
and LDKT. The main reason for this lack of overall benefit
seems to be due to the detrimental effects of pancreas graft
loss on patient survival as well as kidney graft survival [11••].
A large retrospective analysis by Norman et al. showed that
those SPKT recipients who had early pancreatic graft loss
within 90 days had a 70% higher risk of kidney graft failure
after 3 years and more than double the risk of death [13].
Another large single center study from Minnesota also
showed similar results when the pancreas graft was lost within
90 days in SPKT recipients [14]. Therefore the focus in pancreas transplantation should be to improve pancreas graft outcomes as much as possible. To this effect, all efforts should be
directed towards improving pancreas donor selection, pancreas assessment, organ preservation [4, 12], reduction of cold
ischemia, and optimal management of complications after surgery. It must be noted that there is a high risk of selection bias
in these observational studies, as access to the waiting list is
hampered for the diabetes patients. This is mainly due to the
fact that majority of the guidelines recommend strict screening
criteria, especially for cardiovascular disease, in these patients
[15]. Therefore, the above results are applicable in this group
of type 1 diabetics, who passed these strict selection criteria
and were eligible for an SPKT. Another bias to consider in
these studies would be the referral bias in these highly specialized centers. SPKT is generally performed in high volume
centers, and this affects the generalizability of outcomes from
these centers. Also, the healthiest of these patients would be
allocated to receive an SPKT, from the highest quality donors
[16] and more often get a pre-emptive transplant [17, 18••].
In summary, these results indicate that patients with T1DM
derive greater benefits over time from SPKT, as patient survival curves cross at the 5-year point in favor of SPKT.
Therefore, the addition of a pancreas transplant in addition
to a kidney transplant alone, confers long-term survival benefit in these patients, mainly due to euglycemia and reduced
cardiovascular death. However, for those patients who have a
living kidney donor available, LDKT is as good an option as
SPKT, with a future PAK option in the short-term.
Secondary Complications of Diabetes
Few studies have looked into the benefits of a pancreas transplant upon the secondary complications of diabetes including
neuropathy [19], retinopathy [20] and nephropathy [21]. Most
of these studies are small, single-centered without adequate
controls or powered to be conclusive. A recent review by
Boggi et al. looked at the impact of pancreas transplantation
on secondary complications of diabetes. This review found
that there is now growing data to show that a successful pancreas transplant may slow the progression, stabilize, and even
favor the regression of some of these complications [22].
Pre-Emptive Transplants
Increased mortality risk while awaiting transplant is inherent
to those patients who are already on dialysis [23, 24]. Time
spent on dialysis remains one of the strongest factors associated with poor kidney graft outcomes in these patients [24,
25]. Accumulation of dialysis time while awaiting either an
SPKT or a LDKT is associated with reduced post-transplant
survival [26]. However, a large retrospective analysis looking
at a 7-year survival of preemptively transplanted LDKT versus SPKT with up to 2 years of dialysis time showed no difference in survival rates. This study also showed that preemptive SPKT provided comparable survival to LDKT with
or without subsequent PAK [27].
Patient Preference
Based on these findings, there is no clear advantage of one
modality of transplant over the other. Therefore, individual
patient preferences and circumstances must be taken into account before making a choice of transplant. Those patients
with brittle diabetes and who are more troubled by hypoglycemic unawareness may benefit more from the euglycemic
effect of a pancreas transplant and hence considered for an
SPKT. Conversely, those patients for whom dialysis has a
significant detrimental effect on their quality of life may be
best served by the quicker cessation of dialysis offered by a

LDKT. With regard to quality of life (QoL) after transplantation,
there are only a few studies comparing SPKT to LDKT. A study
by Sureshkumar et al. compared QoL in patients with T1DM
who received SPKT, LDKT, and DDKT or were still on the
waiting list. They reported an improvement only in diabetesrelated QoL after SPKT but not in general QoL. But all modalities of transplantation showed a definite improvement in QoL
over remaining on waiting list [28]. Similarly, a Spanish study
showed improvement in QoL after SPKT compared those still on
renal replacement therapy [29]. Ziaja et al. showed an improvement in QoL after SPKT compared to kidney transplant alone
[30]. However, a study by Smith et al. reported an improvement
in QoL in only half of SPKT recipients and a decrease in QoL in
a third [31]. Past psychiatric disorder was a key factor in these
patients. It is therefore important to educate patients before transplant regarding goals and treatment expectations. More studies
are needed to look into this important aspect post transplant in
this group of patients.
Individual Patient Comorbidities
Traditionally, an age less than 50 years and BMI under 30
have been applied as criteria for selection of recipients by
pancreas transplant centers. Advances in medical therapy
and improved surgical outcomes in pancreas transplant mean
that this age barrier is no longer applicable. Studies by individual centers are reporting comparable pancreas and patient
survival in recipients over 50 years of age [32–34]. However,
obesity still remains a significant risk factor for post-operative
complications and pancreas graft loss in pancreas transplantation. A large retrospective database analysis from the USA
showed that obesity was associated with a higher risk of not
only post-operative complications but also pancreas graft loss,
kidney graft loss, and death at 3 years [35]. Smaller, singlecenter studies are more optimistic, in spite of higher postoperative complications [36, 37].
It is therefore very important to thoroughly screen this
high-risk group of patients before surgery and before choosing
the modality of transplant.
Simultaneous Islet-Kidney (SIK) and Islet After Kidney
(IAK) Transplant
Transplantation of isolated islets of Langerhans is an accepted treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes
mellitus. In 2000, insulin independence was achieved
consistently with a steroid-free immunosuppression protocol by the Edmonton group [38]. However, multiple
islet transplants are required to achieve insulin independence, and long-term function remains a problem even
after multiple transplants [39]. In spite of this, islet transplantation has been shown to be much safer than whole
organ pancreas transplantation [40]. At present, SIK and
IAK transplants are established treatment options for patients with T1DM and CKD V [41]. There are no randomized trials comparing islet transplants with whole
organ pancreas transplants due to the obvious ethical
reasons with regard to the different surgical procedures
and the resulting complications. A retrospective study by
Gerber et al. compared long-term outcomes of glucose
control, renal function, and procedure-related complications between SPK and SIK transplants [40]. In terms of
glucose control, SIK transplant was comparable to SPK.
Endogenous insulin production by islet transplantation
combined with optimal insulin therapy was shown to be
sufficient to maintain near-normal glucose levels and
avoid hypoglycemia. However, SPK transplantation was
found to have a higher insulin independence rate (96 vs
31% in SIK group). This was at the cost of higher rate of
surgical complications after an SPK transplant (40% relaparotomies vs 0% in SIK group). Kidney function in
both groups was similar. Another retrospective study by
the same group compared SIK or IAK transplantation
versus intensive insulin therapy (IIT) and waiting list
for islet transplantation (WLI) [41]. This long-term study
with more than 7-year follow-up showed that glycemic
control improved significantly in the SIK/IAK group
compared to the IIT/WLI groups. The rates of severe
hypoglycemia also reduced significantly in the SIK/IAK
group. Both these studies are limited by low patient
numbers and being retrospective in nature. In spite of
this, these studies demonstrate that SIK and IAK transplants are valuable alternatives to the more invasive SPK
and PAK transplants. They may be suitable in those patients with significant comorbidities which preclude a
whole organ pancreas transplantation and in whom better
glycemic control and avoidance of severe hypoglycemias
are more important than achieving insulin independence.
Artificial Pancreas Treatment
The emerging evidence of benefits of artificial pancreas treatment in type 1 diabetes patients warrants a note about this modality of treatment. A recent systematic review and metaanalysis of 40 randomized clinical trials showed that artificial
pancreas treatment was efficacious and safe in patients with
T1DM [42]. The study demonstrated that the proportion of time
in the near normoglycemic range (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) was significantly higher with artificial pancreas use, both overnight
(weighted mean difference 15.15%, 95% confidence interval
12.21 to 18.09%) and over a 24-h period (9.62, 7.54 to
11.7%). Results were consistent in a subgroup analysis both
for single hormone and dual hormone artificial pancreas systems. This has significant implications in those type 1 diabetics
who have brittle diabetes and severe hypoglycemic unawareness, but who are pre-dialysis and not affected so much by the

kidney failure, who may benefit the most by these artificial
pancreas treatment options. However, the study noted that there
were limitations of current research evidence in terms of inconsistency in outcome reporting, small sample size, and short
follow-up duration of individual trials.
Conclusions
In summary, an SPKT or LDKT is much better than a DDKT
in patients with T1DM and CKD V. The choice between an
SPKT and a LDKT is more difficult and cannot be based
primarily upon patient and graft survival outcomes. The
modality of choice should take into consideration patients’
individual circumstances, preferences for therapy, perceived quality of life, their risk of morbidity and mortality
for an SPKT, and the waiting times based on local allocation
policies. Similar to the recommendations of previous such
reviews [18••, 43], it is reasonable to pursue an SPKT in a
pre-emptive setting. If the patient is nearing or already on
dialysis, an LDKT should be considered due to the associated risk of morbidity and mortality while on the waiting
list. PAK transplant is an option in these patients and should
be considered within a year after LDKT. A proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 1, reflecting the above conclusions,
adapted from previous reviews [43].
