Introduction
Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma is the most common type of
cholangiocarcinoma, accounting for approximately 60 %
of cases, followed by the distal and then the intrahepatic
forms. Although its surgical resection is technically
demanding, many surgeons have adopted an aggressive
approach to perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, as surgical
resection is the only way to cure this intractable disease. In
the past two decades, with advances in diagnostic and
surgical techniques, the surgical outcomes and survival
rates have gradually improved [1]. In this Editorial, we
discuss the benefit of an aggressive surgical approach to
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma, including combined vascular
resection and hepatopancreatoduodenectomy.
Portal vein resection
Portal vein invasion was previously the main cause of
unresectability of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. In 1990s,
several authors stressed the importance of using portography to demonstrate portal vein invasion as a contraindication to surgery. However, this philosophy has recently
become outdated. Combined portal vein resection is now a
routine procedure in leading centers in both the East and
West, and its clinical benefit has been validated by many
studies. Portal vein resection is performed primarily in
cases of right-sided hepatectomy, most likely due to
technical feasibility. However, we should note that vessel
resection is often required in cases of left-sided hepatectomy for advanced tumors with left-sided predominance
[2].
In our previous study [3], we reported a mortality of
9.6 % and a 5-year survival rate of 9.9 % in combined liver
and portal vein resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
(n = 52; study period from 1979 to 2000). Since then, the
outcome has markedly improved as we have gained more
experience: in 185 patients between 2001 and 2012 (portal
vein resection alone in 111 patients, simultaneous resection
of the portal vein and hepatic artery in 74 patients), the
mortality decreased to 3.2 % and the 5-year survival rate
increased to 24.6 % (unpublished data). Indeed, 20 patients
survived for more than 5 years.
Portal vein resection should be performed only when the
vessel adheres to and cannot be freed from the tumor
during the skeletonization resection of the hepatoduodenal
ligament. We have never used the ‘‘no-touch technique’’
introduced by Neuhaus et al. [4], as it lacks scientific
validation. In their series, the 5-year survival rate of 60 %
was calculated from the data of only 14 patients, after
excluding both operative deaths and R1/2 resections. The
mortality in patients who underwent hepatectomy with
portal vein resection was as high as 17 %. In addition,
cancer invasion of the resected portal vein was histologically observed in only 22 % of patients who underwent
combined resection. Under the concept of ‘‘no-touch
technique’’, these findings strongly indicate that unnecessary portal vein resection was performed in many patients.
In his series in which right-sided hepatectomy was preferred, the overall 5-year survival rate including all deaths
was only 22 %. Although the no-touch technique may
warrant further study, we do not believe that these findings
demonstrate superiority of the concept.

Hepatic artery resection
Recent advances in surgical techniques and knowledge,
which have been gained from experiences with liver
transplantation, have facilitated the performance of hepatic
artery resection with reconstruction. These advances have
encouraged some aggressive hepatobiliary surgeons to
perform this difficult resection for locally advanced tumors.
Most of the previous studies, however, showed negative
results and did not recommend the combined resection of
the hepatic artery for biliary cancer. For example, Miyazaki
et al. [5] reported a mortality rate of 33.3 % (=3/9) in
patients who underwent hepatectomy with hepatic artery
resection, and none of these patients survived for more than
3 years. From these observations, they concluded that
hepatic artery resection, unlike portal vein resection, cannot be justified.
In 2010, we reported our experiences with major hepatectomies with simultaneous resections and reconstructions
of the portal vein and hepatic artery (n = 50) and showed
that this challenging surgery can be performed with an
acceptable mortality rate of 2 % and offers a better chance
of long-term survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 30 %
[2]. Thereafter, the number of patients who underwent
combined hepatic artery resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma has increased, now reaching 107 (including the
50 patients mentioned above). Of them, 28 patients underwent hepatic artery resection alone and the remaining 79
patients underwent simultaneous resection of the portal vein
and hepatic artery. The types of hepatectomy performed
included left trisectionectomy in 64 patients, left hemihepatectomy in 38, right-sided hepatectomy in 4, and central bisegmentectomy in 1. The resected hepatic arteries
were reconstructed mainly by end-to-end anastomosis: an
interposition graft using the radial artery or greater saphenous vein was required in 18 patients, and an arterioportal
shunt was performed in 4 patients, due to the failure of
reconstruction. The overall mortality rate was 2.8 %, and
the 5-year survival rate was 34.1 % (unpublished data).
The clinical significance of hepatic artery resection is
still debatable, and further follow-up studies are needed in
some leading centers. However, we believe that our data
are promising and encourages hepatobiliary surgeons to
perform this technically demanding resection.
Hepatopancreatoduodenectomy (HPD)
A major hepatectomy combined with a pancreatoduodenectomy, i.e., a hepatopancreatoduodenectomy (HPD), is
indicated for laterally advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Since
Takasaki et al. [6] first introduced HPD for the treatment of
locally advanced gallbladder cancer in 1980, many Japanese
surgeons and a small number of Western surgeons have
employed this extended procedure for the treatment of biliary cancer. However, a limited number of patients and a
high rate of mortality ranging from 13 to 60 % hindered our
ability to reach to a definitive conclusion regarding the
survival benefit of this procedure. Even today, HPD for
biliary cancer remains controversial and is the most challenging operation employed by hepatobiliary surgeons.
In 2012, we reported the surgical outcome of 85 patients
with cholangiocarcinoma who underwent HPD from 1992
to 2011 [7]. The main tumor location was perihilar in 59
patients and distal in 26 patients. The types of hepatectomy
performed included right-sided hepatectomy in 55 patients,
left-sided hepatectomy in 23 patients, and central hepatectomy in 7 patients. Combined portal vein resection was
performed in 24 patients, and hepatic artery resection was
performed in 7 patients. Despite this aggressiveness, the
mortality rate was only 2.4 %, and the overall 5-year survival rate was 37.4 %. The survival rate of 57 patients with
pM0 disease who underwent R0 resection was 54.3 %.
Our data clearly demonstrate that HPD can be performed
with a low-mortality rate and offers an improved chance of
long-term survival in selected patients. We stress that HPD
is an important procedure for treating extensively spreading
cholangiocarcinoma that is otherwise unresectable, and it is

now the fourth standard procedure following hepatectomy,
bile duct resection, and pancreatoduodenectomy [7].
The current challenge is super-extended resection, i.e.,
hepato-ligamento-pancreatoduodenectomy (HLPD), in
which HPD is performed with an en bloc resection of the
hepatoduodenal ligament requiring the simultaneous
resection of the portal vein and hepatic artery (Fig. 1). Till
date, we have performed this super-extended surgery in 7
patients, without mortality. We will report its outcome and
survival in the near future.
Closing remarks
There are still several issues to be resolved in the surgical
treatment of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma; therefore, further collaboration of endoscopists, radiologists, oncologists, and surgeons is essential to conquer this disease.
Compared to pancreatic or gallbladder cancer, however,
cholangiocarcinoma has rather mild biologic behavior,
indicating that the benefit arising from an aggressive surgical approach is great. As chemotherapy is less effective,
the most important matter is to relentlessly pursue the
possibility of surgical resection. In this regard, hepatobiliary surgeons must make an effort to expand understanding
of liver anatomy and to refine their surgical skill, to perform difficult hepatectomies.
Conflict of interest None.
