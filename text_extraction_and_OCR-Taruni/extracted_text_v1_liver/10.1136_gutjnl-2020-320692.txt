Changing TACTICS in intermediate HCC: 
TACE plus sorafenib
Pompilia Radu ,1 Jean-François Dufour 1,2
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents 
a serious health problem, mainly due to the 
high cancer-related mortality. Transarterial 
chemoembolisation (TACE) is currently 
used as the first-line treatment for 
intermediate-stage HCC (Barcelona Clinic 
Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B), despite the 
fact that this stage comprises patients with a 
wide range of liver function, variable 
tumour number and size.1–4 In clinical practice, only 50%–60% of patients with BCLC 
stage B benefit from TACE, so TACE is 
usually repeated to achieve maximum 
tumour recession. The main factors that 
impact the effectiveness of TACE include 
the worsening of both the liver function and 
recurrence rate. The latter is the result of 
the angiogenic response triggered by TACEinduced hypoxia, which stimulates residual
tumour growth.5
 This has led to the concept 
that combining TACE with an antiangiogenic treatment such as sorafenib will offer 
better tumour control.6
 During the last 
decade, this hypothesis was tested in several 
trials, but the results were inconsistent.7–10
According to a recent meta-analysis the 
combination of TACE plus sorafenib for 
unresectable HCC was superior in terms of 
time to progression but not in overall 
survival (OS).11
In Gut, a new trial combining TACE with 
sorafenib, the TACTICS trial, is published.12
The authors report that in patients with 
BCLC stage B, the progression-free survival 
(PFS), which was 13 months with TACE 
alone, reached 25 months with the addition of sorafenib to TACE. Similarly, the 
time to untreatable (unTACEable) progression increased significantly from 21 to 
27 months. No significant differences in 
adverse events between the two treatment 
arms were observed. This trial stands out 
for being clearly positive with longer time 
to reach endpoints than those in previous 
trials (table 1).
Several aspects of the TACTICS 
trial have to be discussed. This trial 
used novel TACE progression criteria, 
according to which PFS was defined as 
the time to either unTACEable progression or death. Currently, the most 
commonly used evaluation radiological 
criteria of response to TACE are based 
on the measurement either of the tumour 
as a whole (Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors V.1.1) or of its viable 
portion (modified Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors), without taking 
into consideration the patterns of HCC 
progression.13 In the TACTICS trial, the 
authors evaluated the treatment based 
on the Response Evaluation Criteria in

Commentary
Cancer of the Liver (RECICL), according 
to which new intrahepatic lesions were 
no longer considered as progressive 
disease (PD). The PFS was defined as the 
time from randomisation to PD or death 
from any cause, and they define progression as untreatable (UnTACEable) 
progression, caused by the inability of a 
patient to further receive or benefit from 
TACE for reasons that included intrahepatic tumour progression (25% increase 
vs baseline) according to RECICL, 
the detection of extrahepatic spread, 
vascular invasion or transient deterioration of liver function to Child- Pugh C 
after TACE.
The timing of sorafenib administration relative to TACE is important 
and differs among various studies. 
Several approaches have been tested 
for the timing of sorafenib initiation: 
(1) sequential administration, (2) the 
interrupted administration and (3) 
the continuous administration.14 The 
sequential approach involves treating 
patients with TACE, then initiating the 
sorafenib treatment (as an adjuvant 
therapy) once the TACE sessions have 
been completed.7 8 The interrupted 
approach involves placing patients on 
treatment with sorafenib between the 
TACE sessions and pausing sorafenib 
during TACE to avoid possible adverse 
events.9 10 In the continuous approach, 
patients are prescribed sorafenib without 
interruption before, during and after 
TACE. Although the first two approaches 
might be superior in reducing complications, the third approach has the benefit 
of potentially eliminating the angiogenic 
response after TACE-induced hypoxia 
and may therefore prevent tumour 
growth after TACE.15 The feasibility of 
this approach was demonstrated in an 
initial phase I trial that assessed sorafenib 
given continuously and that began 7 
days before TACE.16 In the TACTICS 
trial, patients included in the TACE plus 
sorafenib arm started sorafenib 2–3 weeks 
before TACE, at a dose of 400 mg once
daily. This approach aimed to normalise 
the tumour vasculature, improve TACE 
effectiveness and suppress the cascade of 
proangiogenetic signalling pathways triggered by TACE-induced hypoxia. In the 
TACTICS trial, TACE was administered 
‘on demand’ at the growth of the viable 
lesions, whereas in the phase 2SPACE 
trial, the TACE sessions were scheduled.9
The population enrolled in the TACTICS 
trial differs significantly from the patient 
population enrolled in previous trials 
combining TACE with sorafenib. In the 
TACTICS trial, 80% of patients were classified as having Child-Pugh A5 compared
with 60%–68% in previous trials.7–10 Not 
surprisingly, patients with a less advanced 
Child-Pugh stage tend to have a longer OS 
when treated with sorafenib.15 Another 
possible difference in the patient population 
is the percentage of non-cirrhotic patients. 
In previous trials, the cohorts comprised 
up to 80% of cirrhotic patients, while this 
proportion was not stated in the TACTICS 
trial.
These specificities in the TACTICS 
trial design resulted in a longer sorafenib 
treatment length (38 weeks) compared

Commentary
with previous trials (17–21 weeks). As 
BCLC stage B comprises a heterogeneous 
patient population, careful patient selection is essential. In this setting, several 
questions arise: (1) What is the benefit 
of adding sorafenib to TACE not only in 
terms of disease control but also in terms 
of quality of life and costs? (2) Which 
patients would benefit the most from the 
combination TACE and sorafenib (Asian/
non-Asian, cirrhotic/non cirrhotic)? (3) 
Which criteria are the most appropriate 
for evaluating therapeutic response? The 
answers to these questions are crucial 
in order to define the target population 
and to design the optimal protocol. The 
study by Kudo et al highlights the need 
to optimise treatment for patients with 
BCLC stage B.12 In order to achieve this, 
redefining the criteria for both patient 
selection and treatment evaluation may 
be required. Until new trials for BCLC 
stage B confirm the results obtained by 
Kudo et al, it remains a matter of debate 
whether the combination of TACE plus 
sorafenib is a suitable choice of treatment for all patients with intermediate 
HCC or whether it should be reserved 
only for a specific group. Future studies 
that compare TACE plus sorafenib versus 
sorafenib alone in BCLC stage B may 
further improve our understanding of 
the real benefit of adding sorafenib to 
TACE.
