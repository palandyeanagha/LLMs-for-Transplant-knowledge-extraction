Abstract Increasing interest in functional foods has driven
discovery in the area of bioactive compounds. Prebiotics
are non-digestible carbohydrate compounds that, when
consumed, elicit health benefits and aid in the prevention
and treatment of chronic diseases. While prebiotics have
been shown to improve a number of chronic, inflammatory
conditions, growing evidence exists for prebiotic effects on
calcium metabolism and bone health. These novel dietary
fibers have been shown to increase calcium absorption in
the lower intestines of both preclinical and human models.
Rodent models have also been imperative for understanding prebiotic effects on bone mineral density and measures
of skeletal strength. Although fewer data are available for
humans, bone-related prebiotic effects exist across the
lifecycle, suggesting benefits for attainment of peak bone
mass during adolescence and minimized bone resorption
among postmenopausal women. These effects are thought
to occur through prebiotic–microbe interactions in the large
intestine. Current prebiotic mechanisms for improved
mineral absorption and skeletal health include alterations in
gut microbiota composition, production of short-chain fatty
acids, altered intestinal pH, biomarker modification, and
immune system regulation. While the majority of available
data support improved mineral bioavailability, emerging
evidence suggests alternate microbial roles and the presence of an intricate gut–bone signaling axis. Overall, the
current scientific literature supports prebiotic consumption
as a cost-effective and sustainable approach for improved
skeletal health and/or fracture prevention. The goal of this
review is to discuss both foundational and recent research
in the area of prebiotics, mineral metabolism, and bone
health.

Introduction
Recent advances in genomic sequencing technologies have
resulted in a great appreciation for the gut microbiome and
its role in physiological processes that affect health. This
rapidly growing area of research is demonstrating the great
importance of microbes for intestinal barrier function,
energy metabolism, nutrient supply, immune and inflammatory responses as well as for disease prevention and
treatment [1, 2]. While many studies have linked alterations in gut microbiota structure with obesity, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and cardiometabolic diseases [3],
new methods of genomic inquiry now allow for the study
of gut microbial interactions with peripheral tissues, such
as bone. In fact, several mechanisms to support a gut–bone
axis have recently been reviewed [4], for which the gut
microbiota play an important role. This concept greatly
expands our understanding of the intestine’s role in bone
health beyond simply facilitating the absorption of minerals important for bone health.
The GI tract is a highly innervated tissue which mediates digestion and absorption of dietary constituents while
also facilitating communication with peripheral tissues
through various microbially produced signaling molecules.
Host behavior is central to these processes as the gut
microbiota are dependent on dietary intake of the host for
survival. Consumption of non-digestible food components

is one way in which human behavior can dramatically
modify the gut microbiota for improved host health.
Dietary components like prebiotic dietary fiber have been
linked to shifts in the gut microbial community composition. A growing body of preclinical and clinical literature
shows that prebiotics are essential for improving the
intestinal absorption of calcium and other minerals and also
for enhancing skeletal health [5, 6]. Carefully designed
clinical trials with prebiotics have resulted in a better
understanding of potential mechanisms by which microbiota impact bone health, but a large gap exists to understand how prebiotics indirectly or directly manipulate the
gut–bone axis (Fig. 1) to prevent or treat age-related bone
diseases such as osteoporosis. Therefore, the goal of this
review is to thoroughly review the current preclinical and
clinical literature on prebiotic-mediated bone effects in the
context of potential gut microbiota mechanisms. The
clinical importance of these findings, types of prebiotics,
and areas for future research will also be discussed.
Prebiotics
Prebiotics are functional food components which occur
both naturally in plant-based foods or from synthetic production via enzymatic conversion of sugars. These compounds are generally carbohydrate structures or soluble
dietary fibers which are selectively metabolized by
microbes in and on the body. This action thereby supports
the proliferation of specific microbes and confers a health
benefit to the host (Fig. 2) [7]. With rapid growth in the
area of diet–gut microbiome interactions, a new definition
has recently been proposed which challenges the idea that
prebiotic effects must be selective or specific [8]. This
revision also suggests a need to focus on more diverse
compounds (beyond carbohydrates) that influence overall
microbial ecology and function which may align more
clearly with host physiology [8]. Oligosaccharides like
inulin-type fructans and galactooligosaccharides are the
best-known fibers in this class of functional fibers and are
well supported in the literature for their prebiotic effects.
Specifically, these oligosaccharides have been well characterized for their ability to stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria and to a lesser degree lactobacillus [9].
Although prebiotics are classified under the umbrella of
dietary fiber, the scientific concept of this more functional
classification did not emerge until 1995 [10]. This definition was later modified and now expands beyond GI
influences to include other microbial communities on the
human body (e.g., oral, skin, urogenital) [7].
Foods containing greater amounts of prebiotics have
been consumed for centuries with intakes as high as
135 g/day estimated for hunter–gatherer populations [11].
Current prebiotic consumption in Western industrialized
countries is quite low in comparison with estimated daily
consumption ranging from 1 to 4 g in Americans and
3–11 g in Western Europeans [12]. This is despite the
presence of prebiotics in a diverse set of foods including
vegetables, tubers, and grains. Prebiotic fibers are specifically prevalent in chicory root, leeks, Jerusalem artichokes,
asparagus, garlic, onion, wheat, oats, and soybeans.
Bananas also contain small amounts of the fructose-rich
Fig. 1 Proposed prebiotic–gut–bone axis. Dietary consumption of
prebiotics stimulates gut microbial mechanisms that mediate the
intestinal environment and tissue morphology. These changes
promote the production of signaling molecules, immune cells, and
metabolites thought to beneficially influence bone mineral uptake.
Microbial signaling molecules may trigger systemic neuroinflammatory responses that ultimately stimulate the release of hematopoietic
and immune stem cells from the bone marrow which feed back to the
intestinal tissue to influence intestinal microbial communities and
tissue inflammation

prebiotic, inulin. Although many foods naturally contain
prebiotics, it is also important to consider other factors
when evaluating their effectiveness, including prebiotic
activity and probiotic/microbe-stimulating capacity [13].
Prebiotics with Well-Established Bone Effects
Non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs) are currently
regarded as the most promising prebiotics for bone health
(Fig. 3). Examples of these compounds include lactulose,
galactooligosaccharides (GOS), fructooligosaccharides
(FOS), oligofructose, and inulin. These bioactive food
components, extracts, and synthetic compounds are
available with varying degrees of polymerization (DP,
number of sugar monomers in each chain). Oligosaccharides make up the largest group of prebiotics with a mean
DP between 4 and 10. However, disaccharides (lactitol,
lactulose, etc.) and longer-chain molecules (DP 10–60)
such as inulin and long-chain FOS also have prebiotic
effects [14]. The area of prebiotic research has grown
considerably in the past decade. Beyond the compounds
mentioned above, other functional fibers and prebiotics
have been identified for their positive health effects [9, 14].
With regard to bone health outcomes, the majority of
available data suggest the effectiveness of FOS, inulin,
GOS, lactose derivatives, and soluble corn fiber (SCF).

metabolic requirements for the

123

Compounds such as xylooligosaccharides (XOS), arabinoxylans, beta-glucans, and synbiotics have been shown to
have prebiotic effects but fewer data are available for their
ability to influence calcium metabolism and bone health.
Fructans
Fructans make up the most diverse commercially available
category of prebiotics which include non-digestible polymers of fructose. Their effects on calcium absorption and
bone mineral density have been reviewed [14, 15]. The
terminology used to describe these oligosaccharides and
polysaccharides has not been well standardized but
includes classifications such as oligofructose, inulin, inulintype fructans, and FOS. A hallmark of these compounds is
that the majority of glycosidic bonds in each chain are beta
(b) (2–1) fructosyl-fructose linkages [16]. Fructose chains
may contain a terminal glucose or consist entirely of
fructose monomers. With a DP ranging between 2 and 60,
fructans have been sub-classified by chain length. Shortchain fructooligosaccharides (sc-FOS) have been characterized as having a DP of 3–6 units and oligofructose a
mean DP of 4. While inulin typically has an average DP of
12, long-chain FOS (lcFOS) and high-molecular weight
inulin have been characterized with a mean DP of 25 [14].
These compounds can be synthetically made but also
occur naturally in plant-based foods including chicory root,
artichoke, wheat, onion, asparagus, agave, and banana [16].
Hot water extraction of chicory root is the most common
method of producing inulin from natural sources. These
extracts can be refined further into oligofructose by partial
enzymatic hydrolysis via endoinulase [17] or to high-purity
inulin via physical separation [17]. Commercial production
of synthetic FOS results from the enzymatic conversion of
sucrose, commonly by exploiting the beta-fructosidase
enzyme of the fungus Aspergillus niger [17]. This process
results in chains of fructose with b(2–1) linkages. FOS
synthesis from glucose is also common but results in shortchain inulin or FOS (DP of 2–4) with a higher proportion
of glucose [18].
Galactooligosaccharide
GOS are well-established prebiotic ingredients that result
from a mixture of galactose-based oligosaccharides with
varying DP and linkages to different sugar monomers
including glucose and lactose. The diverse oligosaccharide
composition of GOS accounts for their varied health benefits. Studies have shown that GOS fosters the growth of
important gut microbes like bifidobacteria and lactobacillus
during early life, as these compounds mimic human milk
oligosaccharides known to promote gut health and immunity in nursing infants [19, 20].
GOS are industrially synthesized through the enzymatic
hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond present in lactose by a
kinetically controlled b-galactosidase reaction. The reaction is one of acid/base balance where the catalytic residues
are stereochemically selected for hydrolysis [21]. The
resulting galactose chain with a glucose anchor has a mean
DP of 2–8 and is connected via b(1–2), b(1–3), b(1–4), and
b(1–6) glycosidic linkages [22, 23]. The combination of
these types of linkages between galactose units and
galactose–glucose units has been associated with this prebiotic’s ability to promote the growth of specific beneficial
gut microbes (e.g., bifidobacteria) [22]. Animal studies
have observed that GOS consumption in postmenopausal
rat models resulted in significant increases in skeletal calcium content of ovariectomized rats [24] and bone mineralization in male rats [25, 26]. Dietary GOS has also been
observed to increase calcium absorption in postmenopausal
women [27].
Lactose Derivatives
Lactose is the predominant disaccharide found in dairy
products. It is composed of the sugar monomers glucose
and galactose which are connected by a b(1–4) glycosidic
linkage. Rats with a diet rich in lactose and calcium have
been shown to have improved bone mineral content and
strength [28]. As humans age, the enzymatic activity of
lactase decreases, possibly allowing for microbial digestion
of this sugar as it reaches the lower GI tract [29]. This may
result in greater mineral absorption as lactose-intolerant
individuals have been observed to experience greater calcium absorption from lactose-containing milk compared to
individuals with normal lactase activity [30]. However, one
study found that lactose did not increase calcium absorption among lactase-deficient individuals compared to those
with normal lactase activity [31]. Lactase-deficient individuals have also been found to absorb more calcium than
lactase-sufficient individuals when comparing unhydrolyzed milk to lactose-hydrolyzed milk [32]. Differences
in lactase enzyme activity among individuals may be
responsible for the observed differences among lactasedeficient and sufficient individuals, but the b-galactosidase
activity of colonic microbiota may also play a role which
ultimately challenges whether lactose should be considered
a prebiotic [33].
Lactulose, a product of heat-treated lactose, has been
utilized in the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries
for decades due to its beneficial interactions with gut
microbes, laxation-promoting effects, and its activity as a
detoxifying agent [34]. Industrial production of lactulose is
performed by the isomerization of lactose in alkaline
media, which results in the exchange of the glucose unit for
a fructose, retaining the same b(1–4) glycosidic linkage to
446 C. M. Whisner, L. F. Castillo: Prebiotics, Bone and Mineral Metabolism
123

galactose [35]. Lactulose consumption has been shown to
significantly increase calcium absorption in both rats [36]
and postmenopausal women [37].
Soluble Corn Fiber
Soluble corn fiber (SCF) is a soluble fiber with a mean DP
of 10 that is produced by the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn
starch, resulting in glucose chains containing a mixture of
a(1–2), a(1–3), a(1–4), and a(1–6) glycosidic linkages.
SCF has a low viscosity and is resistant to processing and
manufacturing techniques such as heat and variable pH
[38]. The a-linkages present in SCF are indigestible in the
upper GI tract, thereby allowing for microbial fermentation
in the lower gut. Studies suggest that daily consumption of
8–21 g/day of SCF increases the proportions of Bifidobacteria in feces [39] and intakes of up to 65 g/day were
better tolerated than inulin at lower doses [40]. SCF studies
in animals and humans have associated this fiber with
improved calcium absorption and bone strength in rats
[41], greater calcium absorption in adolescent boys and
girls [42, 43], and improved calcium retention in postmenopausal women [44].
Synbiotics
The combination of prebiotics with other bioactive ingredients such as probiotics (live microorganisms) or
polyphenolic compounds is another area of greater study
with regard to bone health as the combination of different
products is believed to elicit a synergistic health benefit.
Traditionally, the term ‘‘synbiotic’’ has been used to refer
to the combination of prebiotics and probiotics which
improve the viability of probiotics being consumed [45]. In
the context of this review, we will broaden the term
‘‘synbiotic’’ to include more diverse combinations because
other bioactive compounds also appear to elicit synergistic
effects on bone health outcomes when combined with
prebiotics.
One approach to synbiotics is the mixing of prebiotics of
varying chain lengths and monomer linkages as this has
been shown to prolong the prebiotic effect across a larger
portion of the GI tract [46]. Short-chain prebiotics, such as
oligofructose, are believed to be metabolized in the proximal colon, while long-chain compounds, like inulin, may
be metabolized more distally or along an extended portion
of the intestine. The most cited prebiotic mixture with
varying chain lengths is composed of inulin-type fructans
and often called ITF-mix. This mixture has been shown to
have positive effects on calcium and magnesium absorption and bone health outcomes in both adolescents and
postmenopausal women [47–52]. Varying the type of prebiotics to include different sugar monomers has also been
shown to be effective as greater trabecular bone mineral
density, bone volume, osteoblast surface area, and measures of stiffness and elasticity have been observed in
growing rat models following the consumption of a GOS
and FOS mixture [53].
Synergistic effects of prebiotics with plant polyphenols
have broad applicability for bone health as well. One study
reported improvements in trabecular microarchitectural
properties of the tibia despite no change in BMD following
treatment with a FOS and soy isoflavone mixture in
ovariectomized rats [54]. FOS combined with dried plum
fractions in soy-based diets have also resulted in greater
whole-body BMD in ovariectomized rats [55].
Synbiotic investigation that evaluates the effectiveness
of prebiotics in combination with probiotics is a rapidly
growing research area. Currently, Bifidobacterium species
are the best studied in synbiotic applications with regard to
bone health. FOS combined with the bacterial species,
Bifidobacterium longum, increased the calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus content of bone as well as bonebreaking force in rats [56]. Another study reported that
combining two species, Bifidobacterium bifidum and
longum, with GOS significantly increased calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus bioavailability and hind limb bone
mineral content [57, 58].
Dairy products, especially fermented milk products,
have also been investigated for their synergistic effects on
mineral and bone metabolism. Fermented milk consumption before sleeping for 2 weeks among postmenopausal
women resulted in decreased bone resorption [59]. Despite
the addition of inulin-type fructans and caseinophosphopeptides to the fermented product, no additional effect was
seen on bone resorption; however, this supplemented group
resulted in greater urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus which may be the result of increased intestinal
absorption [59]. Another study of kefir-style fermented
milk had no effect on bone turnover, as measured by biochemical blood and urine markers, but this may have been
due to the intervention product being supplemented with
1600 mg of calcium carbonate [60]. FOS–inulin-supplemented milk consumption for 12 weeks among both preand postmenopausal women resulted in significant reductions in bone resorption (decreased urinary excretion of
C-telopeptide of type I collagen) among postmenopausal
but not premenopausal women [61].
Potential Candidates for Prebiotic–Bone
Interactions
A number of other dietary fibers and sugar alcohols have
been evaluated for their prebiotic effects in the gut and
subsequent health benefits in relation to metabolic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity,

123

and metabolic syndrome. While these prebiotics have not
been extensively investigated for their effects on mineral
metabolism and bone outcomes, it is possible that they also
elicit similar effects on mineral bioavailability and bone
health parameters. Therefore, a future area of investigation
would be to evaluate the effectiveness of these compounds
and compare their effects to prebiotics with alreadyestablished bone effects.
Beta-Glucans
Beta-glucans (b-glucans) are polysaccharides of D-glucose
monomers linked by b-glycosidic linkages. This wellstudied dietary fiber is found in cereal grains, yeast,
mushrooms, seaweeds, and some bacteria. Chemically, bglucans are non-starch polysaccharides with repeating
glucose units that may or may not contain branch points.
The prebiotic benefits of b-glucans have been reviewed and
primarily highlight their blood lipid-lowering effects [62].
Among finisher pigs, b-glucans have been shown to
increase short-chain fatty acid production in the intestine
and promote the growth of beneficial bacteria such as
bifidobacteria, but no effect of this prebiotic was observed
for calcium and phosphorus digestibility or retention [63].
Further work is needed to evaluate the diverse types of bglucans currently available in the food supply and to see if
these effects on calcium metabolism also occur in other
animal models, as well as in humans.
Arabinoxylans
Arabinoxylans (AX) are an important contributor to fiber
consumption in the Western diet, as they are the main nonstarch polysaccharides found in many cereal grains. They
consist of b(1,4) linked D-xylopyranosyl residues to which
arabinofuranosyl moieties are attached. Partial enzymatic
hydrolysis of AX yields arabinoxylan oligosaccharides
(AXOS) and xylooligosaccharides (XOS) which have been
evaluated for their prebiotic and health effects in a recent
review [64]. Specifically, AX has been associated with
greater fecal bifidobacteria content [65].
Xylitol
Xylitol is an emerging prebiotic that has shown promising
applications in food, pharmaceutical, and medical industries as a low-calorie sweetener. Xylitol is a non-digestible
pentose sugar with an alcohol moiety. Manufacturing of
this prebiotic results from the extraction from lignocellulosic materials (polymers of cellulose, hemicellulose, and
lignan) such as birchwood [66]. In whole foods, xylitol is
found naturally in many fruits and vegetables [66]. Xylitol
has been observed to promote the proliferation of
lactobacilli and bifidobacteria while decreasing the presence of pathogens in the intestines [66].
Xylooligosaccharides
Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are non-digestible oligosaccharides with a mean DP of 2–6 and b(1–4) glycosidic
bonds that also result from the direct enzymatic auto-hydrolysis of xylan-rich lignocellulosic materials [67]. XOS
are indigestible in the upper part of the GI tract, thereby
affecting the host by selectively stimulating the growth or
activity of bacteria in the colon. XOS have been shown to
increase cecal bifidobacterial counts and total anaerobic
bacteria in the lower gut of rats fed non-digestible
oligosaccharides which included a XOS treatment [68]. In
comparison to other prebiotic oligosaccharides, XOS
resulted in greater colonic total wet weight but had no
effect on colon wall weight [68]. Interestingly, a very
recent investigation of dietary XOS on bone mineral
crystallinity in swine femurs suggests that XOS increases
the crystallinity of bone and that the influence of XOS on
bone may be more prevalent during periods of growth, as
the effects were not seen in bones collected during later
stages of life [69].
Local Intestinal and Systemic Effects of Prebiotics
Diet is a well-accepted contributor to bone health but how
prebiotics interact with the microbiome to impact bone
remains poorly understood. Intestinal microbiota represent
an immensely rich community of bacteria, fungi, viruses,
and archaea that collectively contribute more than 3 million unique genes [70], the activities of which are farreaching as evidenced by the excretion of more than 200
microbially produced metabolites in urine [71]. While it
remains difficult to separate host gene actions from those of
the gut microbiota following prebiotic consumption, it is
clear that the gut microbiome has large impacts on host
metabolic actions through stimulated immune responses,
increased digestion and absorption of dietary components,
displacement-mediated pathogen inhibition, and/or
improved intestinal barrier function. The following section
provides a summary of data to support current mechanistic
theories mediated by prebiotic–microbiome interactions.
Microbial Community Composition
The interaction between gut microbiota and skeletal tissue
became apparent when ovariectomized rats were fed
antibiotics, or antibiotics in the presence of prebiotics or
polyamines [72, 73] and very recently when germ-free
mice treated with feces from conventionally raised mice
448 C. M. Whisner, L. F. Castillo: Prebiotics, Bone and Mineral Metabolism
123

experienced a decrease in trabecular bone mineral density,
trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, and cortical
bone area [74]. Inoculation with microbiota also increased
the total number of osteoclasts relative to control germ-free
mice. While these findings suggest a microbial role in bone
catabolism, prebiotics appear to elicit an anabolic effect via
the microbiome. To date, very few studies have evaluated a
link between prebiotic-induced microbial changes in the
gut with improvements in calcium absorption and/or
markers of bone health. Of the animal studies that have
explored this interaction, bifidobacteria and Bacteroides
have been identified as mediators of calcium absorption,
intestinal morphological and pH changes, and improved
bone strength [26, 75–77]. Two recent studies of adolescent
calcium absorption which aimed to correlate improvements
in calcium absorption with changes in the gut microbiota
found that SCF increased Bacteroides, Butyricicoccus,
Oscillibacter, Dialister, Parabacteroides, and Clostridium
[42, 43]. With age, the gut microbiome changes, so whether the same microbial genera associated with calcium
absorption during adolescence persist to elicit the same
effects later in life (e.g., postmenopausal period) remains
an open question. Largely, the bacterial groups that have
currently been identified for their role in calcium absorption are known for their starch and fiber fermentation
capabilities which supports the following mechanisms.
Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) and Luminal pH
Currently, the most widely accepted theory explaining
prebiotic–bone interactions is through the production of
short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the lower gut (Fig. 4).
Microbial fermentation and hydrolysis reactions transform
prebiotics to SCFAs, thereby lowering the pH of intestinal
luminal contents [73]. Greater acidity in the colon is
thought to prevent calcium from complexing with negatively charged metabolites including phytates and oxalates.
The release of calcium from these molecules increases the
mineral’s availability for absorption and subsequent bone
mineralization. Prebiotic fibers have been shown to
increase the cecal content of SCFAs (acetate, propionate,
butyrate, isobutyrate, valerate, and isovalerate) in animal
models [41, 78, 79]. Despite observed changes in intestinal
SCFA production, a few animal studies designed to
observe prebiotic-associated increases in these metabolites
reported different findings: While one study found no
change in SCFA production [80], another study that
observed increases found only weak associations between
cecal SCFA concentrations, calcium absorption, and bone
mineral density [41]. Intestinal chamber experiments
comparing calcium absorption following exposure to
SCFA or hydrochloric acid, an attempt has been made to
identify whether SCFAs or pH is responsible for the
observed bone effects. Findings suggested that only the
SCFA treatment increased calcium transport across colonic
cells [81]. This finding provides support for alternative
roles of SCFAs in cellular proliferation and cell signaling
pathways as discussed below.
Changes in Tissue Morphology and Transport
Proteins
Increases in cell density, intestinal crypt depth, and blood
flow have been observed in the lower gut following prebiotic consumption (Fig. 5), which are believed to increase
intestinal surface area and allow for greater mineral
absorption [73, 79]. A possible reason for these morphological changes is greater SCFA production, as butyrate is
the preferred energy source for colonocytes [82]. Gut
microbes synthesize a large portion of intestinal SCFAs
Fig. 4 A primary mechanism to
explain prebiotic benefits on
calcium absorption is through
(a) fermentation of prebiotics by
saccharolytic microbes. This
results in (b) the production of
short-chain fatty acids and (c) a
reduction in intestinal pH.
These actions are believed to
(d) ionize calcium from
negatively charged compounds
in the colon, thereby allowing
calcium to absorb into the

which may explain the link between gut microbiota and
increases in intestinal mucosal cell proliferation [83]. With
regard to bone health, morphological changes following
prebiotic consumption have been associated with increases
in calcium absorption in animal models [79]. Beyond
physical changes observed at the tissue level, changes at
the cellular level have also been observed. In animal
models, prebiotic consumption has been shown to increase
cecal and colon expression of Calbindin D9k, an intracellular calcium transport protein [84]. Regulation of mineral
transport proteins may be the result of gene expression, as
SCFAs are believed to be involved in epigenetic modifications of the DNA structure [85].
Hormonal and Immune Signaling
Alternative hormonal and immune signaling mechanisms
(Fig. 6) may explain further the link between SCFAs and
bone health, but at this time data are not available to
directly link these pathways with prebiotic-induced bone
outcomes. Gut microbiota are believed to interact with the
immune system as evidenced by germ-free mice presenting
with reduced mucosal immune function and signaling
[74, 86]. Beyond the gut, systemic inflammation and disrupted immune signaling have been linked to decreased
bone mass [87]. This link with bone may arise from activated T cells stimulating the production of TNFa in bone
marrow and subsequent osteoclastogenesis [5].
SCFAs may also be involved in hormonal signaling that
affects bone, as specific gut microbial strains have been
linked to peripheral serotonin production [88]. In vitro
studies of osteoblast cells suggest that serotonin signaling
activates the serotonin 6 G-protein-coupled receptor (5-
HT6R) which inhibits bone mineralization possibly by
downregulating alkaline phosphatase [89]. When gut
microbial production of serotonin was inhibited, ovariectomized rats developed significantly more bone mass [90].
Currently, no studies have evaluated the effects of prebiotics on gut microbe-derived serotonin and whether such
hormones interact with skeletal tissue, but emerging data
clearly link gut microbial activities with bone health outcomes. Prebiotics do stimulate the proliferation of beneficial gut microbes which could be a target for promoting the
production of beneficial metabolites for bone health,
including immune and hormonal signaling molecules.
Evidence from Preclinical Models
The majority of literature to support the effects of prebiotics on bone comes from animal research with a small
portion from in vitro cell studies. Together, this literature
provides the strongest support for mechanisms of action
while also characterizing interactions between prebiotic
type and calcium dose when evaluating bone outcomes
[91, 92]. Preclinical studies also provide ample evidence
for prebiotic effects on bone throughout the life course as
Fig. 5 Prebiotics influence intestinal morphology and the presence of
calcium transport proteins. This mechanism involves (a) fermentation
of prebiotic fibers by saccharolytic microbes in the large intestine to
form SCFAs such as butyrate and acetate. Cellular uptake of SCFAs
increases cell proliferation ultimately resulting in (b) increased
intestinal crypt depth and (c) greater cell density and blood flow in the
villi. This increase in mucosal tissue provides greater surface area for
calcium absorption. Additionally, microbial metabolites such as
SCFA may signal for (d) greater gene expression of the intracellular
calcium transporter calbindin D9k. D9k calbindin D9k, PMCA plasma

evidence is available from young, adult, and elderly animal
models. Despite the depth and breadth of the animal literature, few studies have integrated gut microbial community data with bone health outcomes in an attempt to
model/elucidate how prebiotics influence gut–bone interactions [6]. A summary of animal studies can be found in
Table 1.
In Vitro Calcium Availability and Absorption
Models
Of the data currently available, findings from in vitro cell
models suggest that prebiotics foster cellular calcium
uptake but that microbes differentially regulate this process. Caco-2 cell monolayer studies indicate that difructose
anhydride III, difructose anhydride IV, FOS, and raffinose
(trisaccharide made of galactose, glucose, and fructose) all
increased paracellular calcium absorption in a dose-dependent manner [93]. Conversely, in a similar Caco-2 cell
model, inoculation with a human intestinal bacterial suspension resulted in a decreased presence of calcium in the
basolateral filtrate but greater intracellular calcium content
[94]. This suggests that prebiotics in the presence of gut
microbiota influenced luminal uptake of calcium while
possibly limiting further absorption into the blood. It is
possible that specific members of the intestinal microbial
community are responsible for facilitating calcium
absorption. In the latter study, Caco-2 cells were only
inoculated with Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, and
Enterococcus after extraction from human feces [94].
Previously, a comparison of two probiotic strains (Lactobacillus salivarius and Bifidobacterium infantis) with
commensal E. coli suggested that Lactobacillus salivarius
significantly increased cellular calcium uptake, while
E. coli slightly but non-significantly increased calcium
uptake in comparison to B. infantis which had no effect
[95].
Animal Models—Prebiotic Effects at the Intestinal
Level
The majority of animal data exist for fructose-based prebiotics, primarily inulin and FOS [75, 80, 96], but positive
impacts of GOS [24] and polydextrose [97] on calcium
absorption have also been observed. Because animal
studies are more cost and time effective, they have been
instrumental for understanding the effects of varying prebiotic doses, types, and chain lengths (DP) on mineral
absorption [98, 99]. Despite a diverse body of literature
regarding dose and prebiotic structural components, the
animal literature is supportive; however, greater evidence
is needed to understand how age, treatment duration, and
microbial community constituents influence mineral
absorption at the intestinal level.
Effects of Age
Intestinal physiology changes across the lifespan to
accommodate different metabolic needs. Therefore, age
may play an important role in facilitating prebiotic-induced
mineral absorption in the intestine. To date, few studies
have compared prebiotic effects across a wide age range. A
well-designed study evaluating the effects of inulin consumption at 3.75% of diet weight for four days followed by
3 weeks with 7.5% inulin content reported greater calcium
and magnesium absorption in rats aged 2, 5, 10, and
20 months when compared to non-inulin-fed controls
[100]. The magnitude increase for magnesium was more
similar across all ages, while inulin-induced calcium
absorption was significantly greater among 2- and

microbial metabolites; and
(d) production of serotonin and
cytokines. Presence of these
metabolites in the systemic
circulation may influence gene
expression in bone cells and
also interact with neural

further affect bone tissue via

5-month-old rats (* 66%) compared to older rats
(* 27%). Intestinal pH, cecal wall and content weights,
and fecal SCFA concentrations were also evaluated.
Intestinal morphology and pH were modified by inulin but
the effects did not differ by age; however, an age–inulin
interaction emerged for SCFA content with greater acetate
and butyrate in 10-month-old rats compared to the other
three age groups [100]. A potential explanation for the
blunted effect of inulin on calcium absorption in the older
animals may be the tight regulation of calcium flux compared to that for magnesium. A reduction in calcium
transporters involved in active transport in the small
intestine, but not the large intestine, has been observed with
inulin consumption [101, 102]. Further, calcium absorption
effects have been observed to decline slightly throughout
prebiotic experimental trials suggestive of treatment
adaptation [103]. Similar findings have been reported for
intestinal zinc and copper absorption following inulin
consumption. Despite increased absorption with 7.5%
inulin across age groups, inulin-induced zinc and copper
absorption was lower in older rats (11 and 21 weeks)
compared to younger animals (3 and 6 weeks) [104]. This
presents important questions of whether prebiotic effects
can be sustained with long-term consumption and if varying prebiotic approaches are needed at different life stages.
In conjunction with age, prebiotics may also elicit positive effects on calcium absorption in the context of
estrogen deficiency. Calcium absorption was significantly
improved in ovariectomized rats fed 5% GOS for 30 days
but the benefit disappeared after 20 days of GOS supplementation [24]. This effect was accompanied by significant
increases in cecal wall and content weight, and greater
luminal contents of acetic, propionic, butyric, and succinic
acids as well as total SCFA content. Similar effects were
observed among ovariectomized rats consuming inulinenriched diets (5% of diet) for 21 days which resulted in
improved calcium balance [105]. Prebiotics have also been
shown to elicit benefits in the presence of nutritional
deficiencies in the context of estrogen deficiency. Fourweek consumption of the prebiotic disaccharide, difructose
anhydride III (DFAIII; 15 g/kg diet), increased calcium
absorption in vitamin D-deficient ovariectomized rats
[106]. Taken together, findings from animal models suggest that mineral absorption may differ by age and estrogen
deficiency. For example, when given similar doses of FOS
(50 g/kg) a study in young growing rats found improvements in calcium absorption [107], while another study in
ovariectomized rats did not observe an effect on calcium
absorption [108]. In the ovariectomized rats, benefits to
calcium absorption and retention were most consistently
observed over 16 weeks when high calcium intakes (10 g/
kg) were combined with 50 g/kg oligofructose, while
phosphorus retention was greater with 100 g/kg
oligofructose through 4 weeks and 50 g/kg oligofructose
through 8 weeks [108]. This ultimately suggests the
importance of hormonal status and a need to understand
how similar prebiotic doses influence different minerals at
different stages of life, which doses are most effective, and
whether benefits persist across longer interventions.
Prebiotic Type, Dose, and Duration Effects
The effects of prebiotics may be dependent upon the type
of prebiotic used, and the dose and length of treatment.
Following an elegant evaluation of nine different fibers
(two resistant starches, soluble corn fiber, soluble fiber
dextrin, pullulan, polydextrose, inulin, long-chain inulin ? short-chain FOS, and cellulose), calcium and iron
retention, as measured by balance studies, were unaffected
by all treatments despite beneficial effects on bone which
are discussed in the next section relating to bone outcomes
[41]. Magnesium retention was only affected by soluble
fiber dextrin, while copper retention was improved by all
fibers except inulin, and zinc retention was improved by
soluble fiber dextrin, both resistant starches, and the inulin–
FOS mixture [41].
Varying the dose of selected prebiotics in animal models
appears to yield similar results with regard to calcium
absorption [36, 109, 110]; however, chain length and
branching of the prebiotic may have a greater impact on
mineral bioavailability. Adult male rats consuming different fructan combinations that contained a range of chain
lengths and branching found that only an oligofructose–
inulin combination resulted in significantly increased calcium absorption [98]. The combination of short- and longchain fructans in this study may have resulted in synergistic
effects by allowing for prolonged fermentation and
absorption of calcium throughout the large intestine.
The dose of calcium administered may also interact to
influence prebiotic effectiveness, especially in states of
estrogen deficiency. Oligofructose proved more effective at
increasing calcium absorption and retention in ovariectomized rats when consuming a high-calcium diet, while
phosphorus absorption decreased relative to the control
treatment at this intake of calcium [108]. The influence of
calcium dose was also apparent when growing rats consumed 10% inulin for 40 days in conjunction with calcium
intakes at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75% by weight of the diet [91].
Findings from this study suggested that, during periods of
growth, inulin initially increased calcium absorption at all
calcium concentrations but dissipated with the 0.75% calcium diet by the end of the study. Overall, the effect of
prebiotics on calcium absorption can be seen in a few days
but which types of prebiotics and respective doses are most
appropriate requires further exploration.

Animal Models—Prebiotic Effects at the Level
of Bone
Due to their accelerated lifespans, rodent models have
proven highly useful for studying the effects of prebiotics
on bone mineral density, skeletal tissue structure/geometry,
and fracture risk. Despite this fact, fewer studies have
evaluated the impact of prebiotics on measures of skeletal
health. Broadly, prebiotics have been shown to increase the
mineral content [26, 111, 112], architecture, and strength
[111, 113–115] of bone. Discrepancies have emerged such
that findings have not been consistent among animal
models meant to depict periods of juvenile skeletal growth
[98, 116]. Occasional findings have also been suggestive of
improved bone architecture and strength when bone mineral density was not affected [113, 114]. Among studies
that report benefits to bone tissue, it has been postulated
that beneficial effects are the result of changes in the more
metabolically active, trabecular bone.
Effects of Age
Growing animals experience improvements in bone mineral content and density [96] and trabecular bone volume of
the femur [112] with FOS consumption. Similarly, GOS at
varying intakes improved volumetric bone mineral density
and breaking strength of both the femur and tibia [26]. In
postmenopausal animal models, FOS may be more effective at eliciting benefits to bone when combined with other
ingredients, or as synbiotics. FOS alone has resulted in
positive [80] and null effects [97] on bone mineral density.
However, administering inulin and FOS reduced bone
resorption, increased femoral calcium content, and
improved bone mineral density [105]. Further, combining
FOS and soy isoflavones improved bone mass of the femur
in ovariectomized rats in one study [117], while no synergistic effect was observed in another [118].
Prebiotic Type, Dose, and Duration Effects
In a 12-week study comparing 8 different prebiotics to
cellulose in growing rats, femur calcium uptake was
increased significantly by the inulin–FOS mixture, while
measures of bone strength (peak breaking force and cortical area and thickness) were most improved by soluble
corn fiber and soluble fiber dextrin [41]. This study
attempted to correlate findings with mechanistic data by
evaluating changes in fecal SCFA concentrations and cecal
morphology. While the production of SCFAs was slightly
associated with bone benefits, overall, mechanistic findings
were unclear as different calcium and bone parameters
were associated with differing intermediate intestinal
variables.
In a similarly complex 16-week study of ovariectomized
rats that compared varying levels of dietary calcium (5 or
10 g/kg) and oligofructose (25, 50 and 100 g/kg), differential effects on bone were also observed [108]. Across the
16 weeks, both femur calcium and phosphorus content
decreased but at recommended calcium intakes (5 g/kg),
25 g/kg of oligofructose preserved trabecular area and
thickness, 50 g/kg increased trabecular perimeter, and
100 g/kg improved trabecular perimeter and trabecular
area. When calcium intake increased to 10 g/kg, the
addition of 50 g/kg of oligofructose resulted in increased
calcium content of the lumbar vertebrae and greater trabecular area and thickness but no change in trabecular
number when compared to a similar calcium diet with no
oligofructose. The authors of this study concluded that
ovariectomy-induced bone loss was prevented but that
calcium and oligofructose interacted to affect the geometry
and architecture of bone. Interestingly, oligofructose elicited the strongest effects on bone with 10 g/kg of calcium,
as it was the only combination that significantly maintained
trabecular connectivity while increasing cortical bone
thickness. In comparison to another study which varied
dietary calcium content (0.25, 0.50, 0.75%) with and
without inulin for 40 days, no effect of inulin was observed
for either calcium or magnesium content of the tibia
despite increases in intestinal mineral absorption [91].
However, among growing male rats followed for 22 weeks,
whole-body bone mineral content and area were improved
by the addition of inulin-type fructans (5 and 10 g/100 g
diet) regardless of dietary calcium content (0.2, 0.5, and
1.0 g/100 g diet) [96]. The effect on bone was not
improved further by increasing prebiotic consumption to
10 g/100 g. While findings from the former study in
ovariectomized rats suggest varying effects of prebiotic
and calcium doses over time, the findings from the latter
study in growing rats imply that prebiotics benefit bone
regardless of dietary calcium content. Currently, few
studies have followed animal models for long periods of
time which make it difficult to understand how differential
prebiotic doses in combination with varied calcium intakes
influence bone properties across life. More work is needed
to understand these combined effects.
As suggested earlier, prebiotic structure (branching and
chain length) may also influence calcium and bone health
outcomes. In a study comparing agave fructans (similar
degrees of polymerization but one branched and the other
linear chains) with inulin, the agave fructans were slightly
more effective at preserving structural properties of trabecular bone in ovariectomized rats [80]. Further, the more
branched of the two agave fructans (CAF1), which also had
a greater DP, resulted in slightly higher femoral calcium
content. All of the fructan treatments in this study resulted
in significantly greater intestinal SCFA content and greater

circulating concentrations of osteocalcin. This particular
study highlights that bone may be influenced differently by
prebiotics within the same class, suggesting that specific
FOS can be used to correct different structural features of
weight-bearing bones.
Animal Models—Influence of Gut Microbes
on Prebiotic-Induced Bone Effects
Very few studies have evaluated the role of gut microbiota
in prebiotic–bone interactions. In a dose–response study,
rats consuming GOS had greater intestinal microbial
community diversity and improved bifidobacteria content
after 8 weeks [26]. Consumption of GOS also led to greater
calcium and magnesium absorption and improved femur
and tibia strength. In this study, changes to intestinal tissue
(greater cecal wall and content weight, and decreased
luminal pH) and microbial community structure were
correlated with calcium absorption and femur bone mineral
density outcomes. These findings suggest the importance of
gut microbes as a potential mechanism for prebiotic benefits to bone.
The role of microbial community members was further
supported by findings from a comparison of prebiotics,
probiotics, and synbiotics during a period of estrogen
deficiency. In this investigation, ovariectomized rats consumed either Lactobacillus acidophilus (PRO), oligofructose ? acacia gum (PRE), or combined L. acidophilus with
oligofructose ? acacia gum (SYN) for 16 weeks [75].
While PRE was the only treatment to significantly improve
calcium absorption, no treatment resulted in improved
femoral calcium content relative to control. SYN consumption resulted in significant improvements in lumbar
vertebrae calcium content and a slight reduction in bone
alkaline phosphatase. Although none of the treatments
improved measures of bone histomorphology, the SYNinduced changes in lumbar vertebrae were associated with
greater bifidobacteria counts at 6 weeks and greater Bacteroides at 16 weeks. Further, PRE and SYN reduced the
pH of intestinal contents, specifically in the cecum. PRE
tended to increase the weight of cecal contents, while SYN
increased colonic tissue weight. As a whole, these data
suggest that synbiotics may prevent bone loss by increasing
fermentation capacity, microbial mass, and surface area in
the intestine while also reducing bone turnover.
Evidence from Clinical Trials
While the gross majority of human research indicates that
prebiotics are beneficial for improving calcium absorption,
fewer studies have evaluated their effects on bone mineral
density. Even fewer studies have incorporated gut
microbial measures as a potential mechanistic outcome for
positive calcium metabolism effects. This section summarizes the current literature while taking into consideration
conflicting results (Table 2). Variation in treatment conditions, intervention duration, lack of controlled diets, host
genetics, baseline bone mineral status, and participant age
will be addressed.
Clinical Trials—Prebiotic Effects on Calcium
Absorption and Mineral Balance
Effects of Age
Human prebiotic interventions have shown positive effects
on mineral absorption, but these effects have varied some
by age. While short-chain inulin at doses of
0.75–1.25 g/day improved iron and magnesium retention in
infants 6–12 months of age, calcium and copper absorption
were not affected at these doses [119]. Similarly, delivery
of a 1:1 ratio of GOS and polydextrose (4 g/L) to formulafed infants did not increase calcium absorption beyond that
of formula-fed infants without prebiotic enrichment [120].
Both formula treatments (with and without prebiotics) in
this study increased total absorbed calcium beyond that
observed in human breastmilk-fed infants; however, the
absorption efficiency was significantly greater from human
milk when compared to both formulas. The larger quantity
of calcium absorbed was likely due to the much higher
calcium content of the formulas and should not be the
reason to avoid breastfeeding as breastmilk has numerous
benefits for infants including the ideal ratio of proteins,
fats, vitamins, and immunological factors.
During the pubertal growth spurt, when poor calcium
intakes can negatively influence attainment of peak bone
mass, fructans, GOS, and SCF have been found to increase
calcium absorption by 6–12% relative to control treatments
in interventions ranging in length from 3 months to one
year [42, 43, 47, 51, 121, 122]. These effects appear to
persist throughout life, as consumption of lactulose, inulin,
and GOS among postmenopausal women has resulted in
significant increases in calcium absorption [27, 37, 52].
The menopausal transition is complex and presents an area
for further investigation as little is known about how prebiotics influence calcium absorption in the early and late
stages of menopause. One study of SCF that specifically
focused on women during stable estrogen deficiency suggested that prebiotics improve calcium retention [44],
while a study of utilizing 10 g/day short-chain FOS found
that calcium absorption was improved in late-phase postmenopausal women but not early-phase postmenopausal
women [123].

Prebiotic Type, Dose, and Duration Effects
Prebiotics have been shown to influence calcium absorption across a wide range of doses ranging from 8 to
20 g/day [27, 37, 42, 43, 47, 50, 51, 121, 122] with only a
few studies showing no effect [123–125]. Calcium intake
may explain differential effects on calcium absorption. In
one of the null studies, calcium intakes (1500 mg/day)
exceeded the recommended intake of 1300 mg/day suggesting that at high intakes the prebiotic effect may be
overpowered by increased luminal calcium concentrations
[125]. Conversely, another study with null effects may
have been due to lower calcium intakes, but the authors
also utilized a study design which lacked consistent consumption of the prebiotic. The latter findings suggest the
importance of regular consumption in order to receive
benefits to mineral absorption and bone health [124].
The long-term effects of prebiotic supplementation on
calcium absorption have not been well studied as the
majority of studies have followed participants for acute
periods ranging from 9 days to 4 weeks. A slightly longer
study with 6-week consumption of 10 g/day of both shortand long-chain inulin-type fructans observed significant
increases in calcium and magnesium absorption among
postmenopausal women [52]. Currently, the longest prebiotic consumption trial measuring calcium absorption was
a 12-month evaluation of an inulin-type fructan mixture
(8 g/day) in adolescent boys and girls [47]. This study
measured calcium absorption at both 8 weeks and
12 months, and while absorption was significantly
increased at both time points, a slight decrease was
observed at 12 months relative to the earlier time point.
Further, this study observed that the Fok1 genotype may
influence early response to prebiotics which further suggests a need for longer term studies when non-responder
effects are observed in the short term. Whether other prebiotics or variation in doses elicits similar responses over
time remains severely understudied.
To date, dose–response studies on calcium absorption
have been limited in human models. Among postmenopausal women, lactulose consumption at 10 g/day
was successful at increasing calcium absorption in contrast
to a 5 g/day treatment which did not differ from that of the
control treatment [37]. In another study of postmenopausal
women, SCF elicited a significant dose–response effect
such that the 10-g treatment resulted in a 5% increase and
the 20-g treatment a 7% increase in skeletal calcium
retention [44]. The same fiber, when provided to adolescent
boys and girls at the same doses, did not elicit a dose–
response effect on calcium absorption; instead, both 10-
and 20-g treatments resulted in approximately a 13%
increase in absorption [43].
Clinical Trials—Prebiotic Effects at the Level
of Bone
Effects of Age
Human prebiotic studies that evaluate bone mineral density
are extremely limited because long periods of time are
required before changes in skeletal mineral can be seen by
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, the current gold standard measurement technique. In the 12-month intervention
of adolescents mentioned above, consumption of inulintype fructans resulted in significantly greater whole-body
bone mineral content (? 35 g) and density (? 0.015 g/
cm2
) [47]. Interestingly, this study also observed that
approximately one-third of the study cohort did not
respond to the prebiotic fiber, with responders (C 3%
increase in calcium absorption relative to baseline) experiencing greater skeletal calcium accretion over the
12-month study when compared to non-responders (\3%
change in calcium absorption) and controls. The rare, longlived (half-life of 105 years) radioisotope, 41Ca, has been
used to label the bone of postmenopausal women and study
the effects of prebiotics on bone turnover. Daily supplementation with 50 g/day SCF resulted in improvements in
calcium balance in the bone, as well as a significant
increase (? 8%) in bone alkaline phosphatase on the larger
20 g/day prebiotic dose [44].
Prebiotic Type, Dose, and Duration Effects
Shorter studies have also contributed to our understanding
of bone tissue effects in humans, primarily by evaluating
prebiotic-induced bone turnover changes. Among adolescent girls and boys, significant changes in biochemical
markers of bone turnover were not observed but this may
have been due to the high variance in these markers during
such an intense period of growth [42]. Conversely, urinary
concentrations of the resorption marker, deoxypyridinoline,
were significantly lower in postmenopausal women consuming fructans [126]. The largest (n = 300) and longest
duration known to have measured bone turnover markers,
as well as bone mineral density, in postmenopausal women
was 24 months [127]. This study found that 3.6 g/day
short-chain FOS ? 800 mg/day calcium consumption
(CaFOS) decreased serum concentrations of C-telopeptides
of type I collagen at 12 months and osteocalcin at
24 months to a greater degree relative to maltodextrin
(9.8 g/day) control. While this suggested that CaFOS
reduced bone turnover better than other treatments, significant preservation of total body bone mineral density
was only seen in the CaFOS group compared to calcium
(800 mg/day) alone. Further, this study suggested a greater
benefit to women with osteopenia which highlights the

importance of metabolic condition when evaluating the
influence of prebiotics on bone health.
Clinical Trials—Influence of Gut Microbes
on Prebiotic-Induced Bone Effects
Quantitative PCR has been used more regularly to assess
changes in specific microbial groups in relation to prebiotic
treatment, but this method does not take into account
changes in the overall microbial community. Highthroughput sequencing of the conserved 16S ribosomal
RNA gene now allows for assessment of changes in
microbial diversity, as well as changes down to the genus
level across the entire microbial community. This
sequencing method has begun to allow researchers to
answer microbially related mechanistic questions in calcium metabolism studies. To date, only a few studies have
implemented these methods in prebiotic–mineral absorption studies.
Changes in the gut microbial composition have been
associated with improvements in calcium absorption in
adolescent girls and boys consuming 12 g/day of SCF [42].
Specific genera that increased with SCF consumption were
Bacteroides, Butyricicoccus, Oscillibacter, and Dialister.
In a dose–response study using the same fiber at 10 and
20 g/day doses, improvements in calcium absorption
among Caucasian adolescent girls correlated significantly
with a number of microbial genera known to ferment
prebiotic dietary fibers [43]. Additionally, diversity of the
fecal microbial community was also increased in this study.
Specific changes in the intestinal microbial community
were increased proportions of Parabacteroides and
Clostridium. Overall, these preliminary studies in humans
suggest the importance of microbial community shifts in
contributing to improved mineral absorption, but further
research is needed to elucidate causal pathways and confirm that findings are relevant to other populations and
prebiotic fibers. To date, fecal microbial analysis has not
been extensively studied in postmenopausal women in
relation to measures of calcium or bone metabolism.

Two primary strategies exist for promoting bone health
across the lifespan. Earlier in life, the best strategy is to
engage in behaviors that promote the attainment of peak
bone mass. Once this peak has been achieved, the strategy
must shift toward one of maintaining and reducing the loss
of bone. Despite substantial evidence that calcium consumption is critical for optimal bone health and reducing
fracture risk later, Americans do not consume adequate
amounts of calcium [128]. Prebiotics are an alternative and
effective method for increasing calcium absorption and
bone mineral density among individuals with inadequate
calcium intakes. They also appear to reduce the rate of
bone loss and reduce fracture risk in later life making them
an effective public health approach for older individuals as
well. Overall, the benefits of prebiotics are modest and
should not be viewed as a singular approach for bone
health, especially among individuals with gross deficiencies of calcium intake.
Fiber has long been known to influence metabolic diseases in a beneficial manner, but the current literature only
reports beneficial impacts of these fibers when extracted or
delivered in more concentrated doses. While extracted
prebiotics have proven beneficial for calcium absorption
when delivered to humans in a variety of foods ranging
from baked goods, drinks, smoothies, and juices
[42, 44, 47, 121], no studies, to our knowledge, have
evaluated the effects of fiber-rich diets as a means to
increase prebiotic intake and subsequent bone health outcomes. As mentioned earlier in this review, a variety of
foods including grains, vegetables, and some fruits naturally contain prebiotic fibers. How the matrices of these
foods influence prebiotic availability and digestibility by
intestinal microbes remains largely unanswered. Currently,
the largest contributor of inulin and oligofructose in the
American diet is wheat products [129]. Wheat also contains
compounds, especially in the bran fraction, which have
been shown to decrease calcium bioavailability [130].
More recent research with regard to intestinal microbiota
effects suggests that arabinoxylan oligosaccharide-rich
wheat bran extracts and whole-grain wheat may increase
the composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus
[131, 132], which have been linked to improvements in
bone health. If prebiotics elicit their benefit to bone through
actions of the gut microbiota, dietary approaches to
incorporate these functional ingredients or foods naturally
containing prebiotics should be a focus of bone health
recommendations.
Conclusions and Areas for Further Research
The study of prebiotic effects on calcium metabolism and
bone health is a rapidly growing area of investigation. The
majority of current evidence suggests their beneficial
impact during periods of rapid adolescent growth and also
life stages characterized with greater bone mineral loss and
fracture risk. A primary concept for prebiotic effectiveness
is their ability to resist digestion by human enzymes, but
little is known about how the source and structure of these
compounds influence the overall community and specific
microbial members to elicit benefits to bone.

To date, research has focused primarily on bifidobacteria counts, with disaccharide (e.g., lactulose and difructose
anhydrides), oligosaccharide (e.g., short-chain FOS, GOS),
and polysaccharide (e.g., long-chain FOS and inulin) prebiotics altering the microbial content of the intestine in
different ways. Further, it appears that prebiotic type differentially influences the absorption of different minerals
and bone mineral and strength parameters. Therefore, further study to clearly elucidate the unique skeletal benefits
of prebiotic fibers (sugar monomer composition, degree of
polymerization, branching, bonds, etc.) is needed. Further,
comparison of whole-food dietary approaches with currently used supplementation approaches would expand our
ability to identify specific foods and fiber types that are
most beneficial for bone health. Future research should also
strive to understand the long-term effects of prebiotics and
how different doses influence outcomes, as this will be
important for future dietary and clinical recommendations.
The most exciting of future research efforts will be those
that continue to characterize gut microbial communities but
also evaluate microbial metabolism beyond SCFAs.
Specifically, the study of signaling molecules on metagenomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic pathways will greatly
contribute to current mechanistic understandings. Further
exploration in these areas will ultimately allow clinicians to
manipulate the gut microbiome for optimal bone health and
possibly avoid the use of pharmaceuticals with adverse side
effects for the treatment of osteoporosis.
