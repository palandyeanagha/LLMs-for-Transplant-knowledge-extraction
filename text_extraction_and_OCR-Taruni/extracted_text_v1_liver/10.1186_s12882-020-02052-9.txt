Abstract
Background: New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is associated with reduced patient and graft survival. This
study examined the clinical and selected genetic factors associated with NODAT among renal-transplanted Malaysian patients.
Methods: This study included 168 non-diabetic patients (58% males, 69% of Chinese ethnicity) who received renal
transplantation between 1st January 1994 to 31st December 2014, and were followed up in two major renal transplant centres
in Malaysia. Fasting blood glucose levels were used to diagnose NODAT in patients who received renal transplantation within 1
year. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely; rs1494558 (interleukin-7 receptor, IL-7R) and rs2232365 (mannosebinding leptin-2, MBL2) were selected and genotyped using Sequenom MassArray platform. Cox proportional hazard
regression analyses were used to examine the risk of developing NODAT according to the different demographics and clinical
covariates, utilizing four time-points (one-month, three-months, six-months, one-year) post-transplant.
Results: Seventeen per cent of patients (n = 29, 55% males, 69% Chinese) were found to have developed NODAT within oneyear of renal transplantation based on their fasting blood glucose levels. NODAT patients had renal transplantation at an older
age compared to non-NODAT (39.3 ± 13.4 vs 33.9 ± 11.8 years, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, renal-transplanted patients who
received a higher daily dose of cyclosporine (mg) were associated with increased risk of NODAT (Hazard ratio (HR) =1.01 per
mg increase in dose, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00–1.01, p = 0.002). Other demographic (gender, ethnicities, age at
transplant) and clinical factors (primary kidney disease, type of donor, place of transplant, type of calcineurin inhibitors, duration
of dialysis pre-transplant, BMI, creatinine levels, and daily doses of tacrolimus and prednisolone) were not found to be
significantly associated with risk of NODAT. GA genotype of rs1494558 (HR = 3.15 95% CI 1.26, 7.86) and AG genotype of
rs2232365 (HR = 2.57 95% CI 1.07, 6.18) were associated with increased risk of NODAT as compared to AA genotypes.
Conclusion: The daily dose of cyclosporine and SNPs of IL-7R (rs1494558) and MBL2 (rs2232365) genes are significantly
associated with the development of NODAT in the Malaysian renal transplant population.

Background
The first successful renal transplant was performed between identical twins in Boston, U.S.A on 23rd of December 1954 [1]. Over the ensuing decades, tremendous
improvements had been achieved in the practice and
outcomes of renal transplantation, including increased
rates of graft and patient survival [2]. Unsurprisingly,
transplantation has been a preferred option for treating
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as compared to other treatment modalities [3]. However, newonset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT)
is a known complication among renal transplant recipients [4] and remains a challenge. Thus, it is essential to
identify the risk factors that predispose this subset of patients, with the aim of treating them early.
Chow et al. in their systematic reviews have identified
various risk factors that could predispose to the development of NODAT, including the use of corticosteroids and
calcineurin inhibitors [5]. Other patient factors that have
been shown to predispose to NODAT are age, ethnicity,
family history, and body weight [6]. On the other hand, a
meta-analysis of genetic association studies has identified
the possible association of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) with NODAT, such as Interleukin-7 (IL7)
rs1494558, Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q
Member 1 (KCNQ1) rs2237892, and Transcription Factor
7 Like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 [7], indicating that genetic
factors play a part in NODAT development.
β-cell dysfunction is considered as the main contributing factor to the development of NODAT due to the alteration in insulin secretion [8]. Several cytokines have
been identified to induce pancreatic β-cell inflammation.
Genetic variations of interleukins; IL-7R, IL-17E, IL-17R,
and IL-17RB, which was recently reported to be associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus, could be associated
with the pathogenesis of NODAT in renal-transplanted
patients [9]. Mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2), a major
recognition molecule of the lectin pathway of complement activation [10] is a candidate gene that may play
an important role in inflammatory damage [11] after
organ transplantation.
The Malaysian National Transplant Registry reported
an impressive outcome of renal transplantation in this
country, with more than 90% of patients with graft survival at one-year post-renal transplantation [12]. Given
the increasing prevalence of risk factors, such as type 2
diabetes mellitus and hypertension in Malaysia [13], a
higher incidence of end-stage kidney disease requiring
renal transplantation would be expected in the future.
Two clinical studies conducted earlier showed that the
incidence of NODAT in Malaysia ranges from 5.5% [14]
to 13.3% [15] at one-year post-transplantation. However,
both studies were performed in a single centre and did
not include a genetic component. The role of genetic
polymorphism in the development of NODAT in Malaysian renal-transplanted patients is still unknown.
This study aimed to examine the possible association
between selected clinical parameters and genetic polymorphisms with the development of NODAT in Malaysian renal transplant patients. Two common SNPs in
Asian, the IL-7 receptor (rs1494558) and MBL2
(rs2232365), will be examined in association with the development of NODAT in this population.
Methods
Study design and patient population
Malaysian patients who underwent renal transplant between 1st January 1994 to 31st December 2014 who
were followed-up at two main renal transplant centres,
namely Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and University of
Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) were identified (n =
250). Patients without a history of diabetes mellitus before renal transplant and had attended their follow-up at
the two hospitals were recruited into the study (n = 192)
(Fig. 1). This study was approved by the Medical Research and Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health
Malaysia (reference no NMMR-14-1527-21,690 (IIR)
and conformed with the ethical regulations of the World
Medical Association and the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained from the patients before they participated in the study.
Demographic and clinical information
Demographic information and clinical information were
obtained retrospectively from medical records. Demographic information included gender, age and ethnicity
while clinical parameters included primary kidney disease, duration of dialysis prior to transplant, place of
transplant, age at transplant, types of the donor and immunosuppressive protocol. Retrospective data at onemonth, three- months, six-months and one-year posttransplant were obtained for levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and creatinine, body mass indices (BMI),
types of immunosuppressive agents and dosage of drugs.
Patients without FBG data (n = 3), those with loss of
graft or those who died within 1 year post-transplant
were excluded (n = 21). All patients received a standard
triple immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with calcineurin inhibitors (either cyclosporine or tacrolimus),
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids
(prednisolone) within 1 year of transplant. The patients
who had switched from one calcineurin inhibitor to another were considered to have been exposed to both.
Definition of new-onset diabetes mellitus after
transplantation (NODAT)
NODAT was diagnosed according to the levels of FBG
used by the American Diabetes Association Guideline:
Guad et al. BMC Nephrology (2020) 21:388 Page 2 of 8

FBG ≥126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) and not on oral
hypoglycaemic agents or insulin at any point of follow
up period within one-year of renal transplant [16, 17].
Blood collection
Patients were invited to provide DNA samples during
their routine clinic follow-up for this study. Five milliliter of whole blood was drawn into the EDTA tube and
kept in an icebox before being transported to the laboratory for DNA extraction.
DNA extraction and genotyping
DNA samples were extracted using the QIAamp Blood
Purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per manufacturer protocols. DNA was stored at − 80 °C until
processed. Two SNPs, the IL7R (rs1494558) and MBL2
(rs2232365) were genotyped using the Sequenom Mass
Array platform (Sequenom, USA). The procedure of
genotyping is described elsewhere [18].
Statistical analyse1s
A total of 168 patients with clinical and genotyping data
were included in the final statistical analysis. Categorical
variables were expressed as percentages, while continuous variables were expressed as mean with standard deviation (SD). Patients were categorized into NODAT
NODAT (n = 29, 17%) and non-NODAT (n = 139, 83%).
Comparisons of demographic and clinical variables between the two groups were performed using the chisquared test for categorical variables and Student’s t-test
or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables as
appropriate.
The patients were followed-up using for time-points
(one-month, three-months, six-months and one-year)
post-transplant. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to examine
the relationship between demographics and clinical covariates, and the development of NODAT utilizing the
four time-points. NODAT was considered as the ‘event’
and patients were followed up until they developed
NODAT, or until the end of the one-year study period
for those who did not develop NODAT. Covariates were
selected from the univariate analysis, considering a p <
0.05 as being statistically significant. The risks of
NODAT with each parameter were presented as adjusted hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI).
Results
Patients’ characteristics
A total of 168 patients were included in this study (58%
males, mean age at transplant: 34.8 ± 12.1 year), with
48% of patients (n = 80) were recruited from the UMMC
while the remaining were from Hospital Kuala Lumpur
(n = 88). Of those, 29 patients (17%) developed NODAT
within one-year of post-renal transplant.
Under the ethnicity stratification, Chinese patients
made up the majority of renal transplant recipient in this
study (68%). Two-thirds of the patients underwent their
renal transplant in Malaysia (n = 114) while others had
their transplants performed overseas (n = 54) as presented in Table 1. The kidney donors were living-related
(41%), living unrelated (11%) and cadaveric grafts (48%).
These patients were administrated with either cyclosporine (54%) or tacrolimus (40%), while others received
both immunosuppressant medications within a year of
transplantation.
Demographic and clinical variables associated with
NODAT
Comparing those who developed NODAT and those
who did not, patients with NODAT were significantly

older at transplant (39.3 ± 13.4 vs 33.9 ± 11.8) (Table 1).
There were no significant differences between NODAT
and non-NODAT patients in terms of gender, ethnicities, primary kidney disease, type of donor, place of
transplant and the duration of dialysis before transplant.
Besides, there were no significant differences between
the two groups in terms of their BMI, serum creatinine
and average daily doses of immunosuppressants at oneyear post-transplant.
A significantly increased risk of NODAT with increased age at transplant, patients of Chinese ethnicity
compared to Malay ethnicity, and patients with
hypertension as compared to those with glomerulonephritis was found in the univariate analysis (Table 2). The
univariate analysis also showed that increased duration
of dialysis prior to transplant was associated with a lower
risk of NODAT. Also, patients prescribed higher doses
of cyclosporine, tacrolimus and prednisolone were associated with a significantly increased risk of NODAT per
unit mg increase in the dose of each drug.
In the multivariate analysis, following adjustment for
recipient’s age, gender, ethnicities, primary kidney disease, the duration of dialysis and dosage of immunosuppressants, the single parameter which remained

(95% CI 1.00–1.01) per mg increase in dose.
Genetic polymorphisms and incidence of NODAT
For rs1494558 of the IL7R variant, those with the GA
genotype were associated with a significantly increased
risk of NODAT in the pooled Malaysian renal transplant
patients as compared to the AA genotype (adjusted
HR = 3.15 (95% CI 1.26,7.86), as shown in Table 3.
Meanwhile, the AG genotypes of the rs2232365 MBL2
variants were associated with a higher risk of NODAT
with adjusted HR of 2.57 (95% CI 1.07, 6.18) compared
to the AA genotype. The frequencies for rs1494558 and
rs2232365 SNPs were not significantly different from
those expected based on the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium indicating that the sample was uniformlydistributed. The genotype frequencies for the rs1494558
and rs2232365 SNPs, according to ethnicity is presented
in Table 4.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that those with NODAT in the
Malaysian population had a significantly higher age at
transplant when compared to those without NODAT. In
addition, a higher dose of cyclosporine appeared to confer a slightly higher risk for NODAT among transplanted patients per mg increase in dose.
Polymorphisms in the IL7R (rs1494558) and MBL2
(rs2232365) genes were associated with a higher risk of
NODAT among pooled Malaysian renal transplanted
populations.
Despite similar diagnostic criteria, high variability in
the incidence of NODAT within 1 year posttransplantation has been reported in different populations [19–21]. The incidence of NODAT at one-year
post-transplantation in our study was slightly higher

than the earlier reports by Foo et al. (13.3%) [15] and Lai
et al. (5.5%) [14] in their studies in single centres in
Malaysia. This finding indicates that variability could
exist based on the socio-geographical location in this
country. Nevertheless, our finding was consistent with
that of our neighbouring county, Singapore, which consisted of a similar multi-ethnic population. Their incidence of NODAT was reported to be at 15.8% following
one-year of transplantation in 2011 [6]. It should be
noted that a vast majority of end-stage renal disease patients live in developing countries (such as South Africa
and South East Asian countries) and could contribute to
the increased number of transplanted patients and thus
occurrence of NODAT worldwide [22].
Ageing has been consistently shown to be a significant
risk factor for NODAT, especially among patients who
are above 40 years of age [23]. This finding is not surprising considering the influence of age on the higher incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the general
population [24]. Despite our study population comprising of younger aged patients (mean age of 34.8 years
old), those with NODAT were found to be older than
those without (mean age 39.3 vs 33.9 years old).
However, no significant increased risk was found in the
multivariate model.
Several published reports had demonstrated a
higher incidence of NODAT following the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors in renal transplantation
[25]. In this study, we have not established a higher
risk of NODAT with tacrolimus as compared to
cyclosporine. Similarly, an earlier study among the
Malaysian population by Lai et al. [14] found no significant difference in the risk of NODAT with the
use of the two calcineurin inhibitors. This study
found an increased risk of NODAT with increasing
daily dose of cyclosporine (per unit mg increase).
Although the risk is modest (HR = 1.01 (95% CI 1.00–
1.01)) per mg increase in the daily dose, this is
considered important, especially in those who are prescribed a high dosage of cyclosporine. Previous randomized control trial using different dosing regimen
of cyclosporine has shown a higher incidence of posttransplant diabetes in patients receiving standard-dose
cyclosporine (trough level 150–300 ng/ml), compared
to lower-dose (50–100 ng/ml) [26].
Our study demonstrated a significant association between GA genotypes of rs1494558 in IL7R gene and
NODAT risk when compared to the AA genotype. Betacell dysfunction is considered as the main contributing
factor in the development of NODAT, leading to an alteration in insulin secretion [27]. One of the mechanisms of beta cells malfunction is increased expression
of IL-7R, IL-17E, IL-17R and IL-17RB, and the association of these cytokines with NODAT among renal
transplanted patients in several populations has been reported [27, 28]. In addition, we demonstrated that the
AG heterozygous variant of the MBL2 gene (rs2232365)
carries a higher risk of NODAT when compared with
the AA variant. Since MBL plays an essential role in the
lectin pathway of complement activation [10] and is
therefore involved in the non-infectious inflammatory
damage [11] including organ transplantation, genetic

polymorphism of this molecule may alter insulin secretion from the pancreas.
In countries which are composed mainly of Caucasians, research findings have revealed the role of ethnicity in the development of NODAT [29]. Malay and
Indian ethnicities constituted a smaller sample size as
compared to the Chinese ethnicity in our study, as also
reported by Lai et al. [14], a reflection of the demographics of our participating hospitals. After adjusting
for possible confounders, there were no significant differences in the risk of NODAT based on ethnicity in this
population. Consistent with the findings from Nepali R
et al. [30], being males was not associated with a higher
risk of NODAT compared to females in the current
study.
Other studies have shown cadaveric kidney donor as
having an increased risk of NODAT [31]. In our study,
there was no significant increased risk of NODAT found
in cadaveric donors compared to living transplant donors, probably due to a small number of cadaveric donors in this study. Although there were more patients
with hypertensive who developed NODAT compared to
those with glomerulonephritis, this associated was not
significant after adjustment of covariates.
We did not establish any significantly increased risk of
NODAT with increased BMI in this study. The mean
BMI within 1 year of transplant for both groups in our
study were within the normal range of BMI, suggesting
that our renal transplanted patients were rather lean on
average. As such, we were unable to capture the true risk
of BMI in the development of NODAT in our transplanted population.
This study has several strengths. Two main transplant
centres in the country were systematically evaluated for
NODAT in the transplant patients according to the
ADA guidelines, as previously recommended. Furthermore, patients were followed up longitudinally for 1 year
(4-time points) based on the FBG as a criterion of
NODAT, rather than using a single diagnostic point
after one-year. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study on the association of genetic polymorphism
and NODAT (17%) among renal transplanted patients in
Malaysia.
We could not exclude the possibility of selection bias,
since patients who were transplanted in the study period
who died, were transferred to other transplant centres,
or did not attend follow-up sessions during the recruitment year, were excluded from the study. Despite the
recommendation to use combined diagnostic criteria
with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C) for glucose
measurements [32], HbA1c monitoring was not routinely performed in the hospitals setting during the study
period chosen. The retrospective data obtained were not
linked to pharmacy data, and the cumulative dose of
immunosuppressants as taken by patients were not available. The dosages of the immunosuppressants were obtained using clinical records and not specified using the
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of defined
daily dose (DDD). Thus, calculations of daily dose may
not be truly reflective of doses received and taken by
patients.
Additionally, the exclusion of patients with a history of
type 2 diabetes mellitus may lead to the selective exclusion of risk alleles, which could lead to an underestimation of the true risk conferred by these genetic variants.
Some clinical information was not available in the clinical records, such as the presence of a family history of
diabetes mellitus. Therefore, a multi-centre prospective
study in the future is recommended to provide more
insight into the contributors of NODAT, especially the
genetic associations of inflammatory markers gene.
Conclusion
A potential measure to reduce diabetes risk after renal
transplantation, including the choice of an optimal dose
of cyclosporine during the first year of posttransplantation, should be taken into consideration to
prevent NODAT. A comprehensive renal transplant
registry that includes various clinical outcomes and drug
information is needed for future well-designed studies
on renal transplanted patients in Malaysia. Future studies to examine genetic polymorphisms, especially those
involved in beta cell dysfunction, should be undertaken
to explore their potential implication, as SNPs such as
rs1494558 in IL7R and rs2232365 in MBL2 were shown
to be associated with NODAT in this population.
