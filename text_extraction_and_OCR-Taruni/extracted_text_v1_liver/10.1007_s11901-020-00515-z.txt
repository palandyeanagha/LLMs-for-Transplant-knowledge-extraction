Abstract
Purpose of Review Patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) are at high risk of sarcopenia and associated physical frailty.
This review summarises advances in our knowledge of the definition, assessment, clinical implications and management of
sarcopenia in LT.
Recent Findings Sarcopenia is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, physical disability and poor quality of life
both before and after LT. Assessment tools have evolved from solely relying on imaging (i.e. muscle area only) to
reproducible measures of function and physical performance status (i.e. liver frailty index). The multi-faceted management of sarcopenia is heavily reliant on nutrition (protein > 1.5 g/kg/day) and exercise (combined aerobic and resistance)
advice.
Summary There is an increased awareness of the clinical implications, assessment tools and management for patients
with sarcopenia awaiting LT. Future studies need to investigate the role of specific nutritional supplements, pharmaco-/
behavioural therapy and the long-term outcomes (e.g. survival) of reversing sarcopenia in this patient population.

Introduction
Over the past decade, there has been increased recognition of
the importance of sarcopenia in patients with liver disease, in
particular those with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and those
undergoing liver transplantation (LT). The prevalence ranges
from 20 to 70% in these populations, with higher rates in men
[1, 2]. The definition of sarcopenia has evolved from the sole
focus being on loss of skeletal muscle mass (via imaging) to
the inclusion of muscle strength and function, which are commonly assessed by hand grip strength (HGS) and gait speed/
chair stands, respectively. The severity of sarcopenia, mainly
on cross-sectional imaging, is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, physical disability and poor quality of life
both before and after LT [3, 4•]. Interestingly, measures of
muscle strength (HGS) and function (including frailty indices
incorporating chair stands and balance) have recently been
shown to be independent predictors of mortality in ESLD
and after LT, irrespective of the severity of the underlying liver
disease [5•, 6]. This raises important questions in this cohort as
to the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, its reversibility and what is
the optimal therapeutic approach [4•, 7, 8•]. The recognised
causes for sarcopenia in ESLD are multi-factorial and largely
revolve around a state of severe protein catabolism, poor nutritional intake, chronic inflammatory state and barriers to
physical activity (fatigue, fluid retention, encephalopathy)
(Fig. 1). However, with the exception of dietetic input and
exercise advice, there is a paucity of established therapies.
The only current curative treatment for ESLD remains LT,
which is one of the single largest, surgical physiological
stressors the human body encounters in modern day health
care. Therefore, it remains paramount that we continue to
increase our knowledge of the clinical assessment tools and
therapeutic strategies surrounding sarcopenia in order to optimise the patient before and after LT. This review will focus on
recent advances in our knowledge of sarcopenia and the future
challenges in the setting of LT.

Methods
A literature search was performed using PubMed and Google
Scholar to identify articles published from January 1, 2009, to
December 31, 2019, using the following terms: ‘sarcopenia’,
‘malnutrition’, ‘liver transplantation’, ‘end stage liver disease’, ‘muscle mass’, ‘muscle function’, ‘frailty’, ‘ liver disease’, ‘liver cirrhosis’. Primary research articles, review articles, practice guidelines and editorials were included. Only
articles published in English were used.
Definition and Assessment of Sarcopenia
One of the main challenges in the literature is the heterogeneity with regard to defining (i.e. cut-offs for skeletal muscle
mass ± function) and assessment tools for sarcopenia in patients awaiting or having undergone LT. The term was first
described in 1989 to describe the process of skeletal muscle
decline in the ageing population [9], and it is only in the last
decade that the importance of muscle strength and/or function
has been recognised [10]. The combination of low muscle
mass and function to define sarcopenia first emerged from
the European Working Group in Sarcopenia in Older People
(EWGSOP) in 2010 [11]; however, due to the lack of defined
cut-offs for these parameters, it has not been widely adopted.
Tools to assess and diagnose sarcopenia have remained varied
and inconsistent in both the literature and everyday clinical
practice, with the field of LT being no exception [12••]. The
vast majority of LT studies have retrospectively focused on
measures of skeletal muscle mass alone using cross-sectional
imaging [13, 14], with only a handful of reports focusing on
muscle (hand-grip) strength [8•, 15].
Assessment of Muscle Mass
The most frequently used measure of muscle mass in patients
with ESLD and after LT is skeletal muscle index (SMI) of the
L3 lumbar level on CT. This is largely due to the increasingly,
routine use of abdominal CT imaging as part of the LT assessment and for the investigation of post-LT complications [16].
In 2016, a large meta-analysis (19 studies), consisting of 3802
patients awaiting or undergoing LT, investigated the utility of
CT assessed skeletal muscle as a predictor of LT morbidity
and mortality. In the recognition that there was significant
study heterogeneity (sample size, imaging, muscle type, liver
disease severity), overall sarcopenia was associated with both
pre- (HR 1.7) and post-LT (HR 1.8) mortality and to a lesser
extent complications, including infection [14]. Due to a lack
of standardised definition of sarcopenia and specific sexdefined cut-offs in these studies, widespread application to
routine clinic practice has been challenging. However, the
recent formation of the North American FLEXIT (Fitness,
Life Enhancement and Exercise in Liver Transplantation)
Consortium has resulted in validated cut-offs for SMI at L3
to define sarcopenia in ESLD; namely < 50 cm2
/m2 in men
and < 39 cm2
/m2 in women. Sex-specific cut-offs of SMI correlated with LT waiting list mortality [17, 18], but the same
was not true for psoas muscle evaluation (in the form of psoas
muscle index [PSI]), which particularly underestimated clinical impact in males [19]. It is important to recognise the setting
when applying SMI. For example, in patients with high modified end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores and with acute
deterioration, low SMI resulted in 4-fold increased risk of
post-LT mortality in men (SMI < 48 cm2
/m2), but in contrast,
no differences were seen in women [20•]. Furthermore, a large
cohort of 669 patients with cirrhosis highlighted that adding
SMI onto the MELD (termed ‘MELD-sarcopenia’) improved
the predictive accuracy of mortality, especially in those with a
low MELD under 20 [21]. Other modalities for assessing
muscle mass include bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). In general,
these are cheaper, safe, reproducible, time efficient and offer
less radiation exposure compared to CT [22]. However, their
use is restricted in individuals with fluid retention (i.e. ascites,
anasarca) due to their inability to distinguish water from muscle and in limited studies they have not been shown to be as
accurate as CT imaging [23].
Even though CT assessment of muscle area is reproducible
and accurate in patients with ESLD, it is hard to justify the cost
and repeated radiation exposure to monitor response to treatment (i.e. nutrition), with exception of imaging requested for

other clinical indications (i.e. cancer monitoring, vasculature
patency). Anthropometry and more specifically mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) is cheap and can be safely used in
out-patients to assess repeated measures of muscle mass.
When performed by trained individuals, MAMC has good
intra-/inter-observer agreement [24] and has been shown to
predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis and those after LT
[25]. Surprisingly, some studies have shown that MAMC
poorly correlates with CT and MRI. In addition to MAMC,
targeting specific muscle groups (i.e. quadriceps, and in particular vastus lateralis) with ultrasound have shown promise in
the elderly population [12••, 26] and in isolated LT studies [1].
Ultrasound is accessible (i.e. performed by the bedside), sequential monitoring is not limited by radiation exposure, and
has the ability to detect subtle changes of sarcopenia in the
vastus lateralis. The latter of which may enable early identification and targeted intervention. Even though it has high reported levels of inter- and intra-observer reliability [1], its
reproducibility in the setting of LT remains unknown.
The LT literature at present is still lacking evaluation of
muscle mass in different ethnicities (i.e. majority of data from
North America and the Far East) and rarely accounts for the
gender disparity in sarcopenia (mortality: male>female) [27]
(Table 1). Furthermore, the evolving prevalence of sarcopenia
in parallel with the epidemic of obesity (termed ‘sarcopenic
obesity’) poses a significant challenge in the field of LT, with
rates of 20–40% reported in patients awaiting LT [28•, 29].
The majority of the literature on the impact of sarcopenic
obesity on LT is provided by the living-donor LT experiences,
in which patients with sarcopenic obesity have worse 1-year
post-LT survival than those with non-sarcopenic obesity (54%
vs 84%) [30]. There remains a paucity of data in patients with
a body mass index (BMI) > 35–40 kg/m2
, in whom sarcopenia
may go unrecognised using measures of muscle mass alone in
the absence of functional/physical assessments.
Assessment of Muscle Strength
HGS (non-dominant hand) is the most readily used assessment of muscle strength due to the fact it is easy to perform,
can be serially measured to assess progression/regression and
has the strongest evidence base in ESLD. Subsequently, HGS
is currently recommended by both recent international guidelines (European Association of Study of Liver (EASL);
European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism
(ESPEN)) in the assessment of all patients with cirrhosis and
liver failure [31••, 32••]. HGS has been shown to be a better
predictor of adverse clinical outcomes than measures of muscle mass [33] and MELD [8•]. It can represent a quick, bedside
global assessment of muscle strength in patients with ESLD as
it correlates strongly with lower extremity muscle power [34].
In a recent North American study of 145 male patients undergoing LT assessment, an increase in 1 kg of HGS was
associated with a 6% reduction in mortality, independent of
the baseline MELD [8•]. In combination with MELD, HGS
was significantly superior to MELD + CT muscle mass in
predicting transplant-free survival on the LT waiting list [8•].
This however would need to be reproduced in a female
population.
Assessment of Muscle Function and Physical Performance
Various simple, cheap, non-invasive assessments of muscle
function and physical ‘functional’ ability exist that can be
performed either by the patient’s bedside or at their outpatient
clinic appointment (Table 1). To date, the main physical ‘functional’ performance measures that have been described in patients awaiting LT, include Karnofsky Performance Status
(KPS) [1, 35], Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale [36•,
37], Short physical performance battery (SPPB) [38], 6-min
walk test (6MWT, also referred to as 6MWD(distance)) [39,
40], gait speed [41] and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)
[42, 43]. A detailed description of the above has been
summarised in an expert opinion statement by the American
Society of Transplantation Liver and Intestinal Community of
Practice [12••].
With the exception of CPET, the other measures are cheap,
easy-to-access and can be performed in seconds to minutes.
The SPPB, which consists of chair stands, gait speed and
balance (each scored out of 4; total 12), is associated with
overall mortality in LT, with a cut-off < 10 increasing the odds
of mortality by 2.5 [44]. It is, however, limited in patients with
higher levels of baseline physical function (SPBB 12 out of
12), as it has a ceiling score of 12, which means interventions
may be overlooked in these individuals. In contrast, the
6MWT does not a have a ceiling effect, as it is a continuous
scale of distance based on a sub-maximal exercise test used to
assess aerobic capacity. In the last 5 years, cut-offs of distance
have been described in relation to all-cause mortality [39, 40].
The largest study to date of 213 out-patients with ESLD
awaiting LT highlighted that a distance of < 250 m resulted
in a 2-fold increased risk of mortality [40]. Unlike these ‘easyto-perform’ tests, CPET requires specialist expertise and expensive equipment (cyclometer or treadmill) [45]. In 2016,
Ney and colleagues performed a systematic review of 7 studies consisting of over 1000 patients and highlighted that CPET
variables (most notably peak VO2 and anaerobic threshold
[AT]) were independent predictors of pre-LT and post-LT mortality [42]. The majority of these studies are retrospective in
design and are limited by selection-bias, in that those with a
low aerobic exercise capacity may have been declined listing
for LT and thus their outcomes remain unknown. It is also
important to highlight that no single cut-off for AT or VO2
peak should be used in isolation to determine a patient’s physical fitness for LT. If CPET is utilised it should be taken in
context with the patients ADLs, disease severity, co130 Curr Hepatology Rep (2020) 19:128–137

morbidities and other markers of sarcopenia. Of note, the
Duke Activity Index (DASI) questionnaire, which takes less
than 5 min to complete, has been shown to be a better predictor of death or major cardiac events than CPET in patients
undergoing major non-cardiac surgery [46•]. Future studies
should aim to evaluate if this holds true for those undergoing
LT, as not only would this reduce costs and clinician time, but
could be assessed virtually in order to begin optimising those
‘at risk’ before assessing them at the tertiary care LT centres.
Most recently the North American Expert Opinion statement on sarcopenia have issued their rationale of using muscle
mass alone to define sarcopenia, whilst incorporating muscle
dysfunction in their definition and concept of ‘frailty’ [12••].
Certainly, the field has moved towards a global assessment of
muscle strength and functional ability, using easy-to-perform
tests, rather than CT-muscle mass alone in order to evaluate
and predict the outcome of patients undergoing LT.
The Evolution of the LFI) in LT
Frailty is a multi-dimensional construct (physical, psychological, environmental/social components) that combine to define
a clinical state of decreased physiologic reserve and increased
vulnerability to health stressors [47]. Physical frailty is the
component that has most frequently been described in LT
since 2014 and encompasses muscle mass/strength (i.e.
sarcopenia), functional capacity (i.e. ability to complete
ADLs) and aerobic exercise capacity (i.e. ability to utilise
oxygen during physical exertion) [48•]. In order to capture
an accurate, quick, objective assessment of muscle strength
and function (i.e. 2 key components of physical frailty) Lai
and colleagues devised the ‘Liver Frailty Index (LFI)’ in 2017
from a cohort of 536 patients with ESLD [49••]. Using the
concept of the well-known Fried Frailty Index [47] and the
SPPB [50], the LFI consists of dominant HGS, time to do 5
chair stands and time holding 3 balance positions (feet side by
side, semi-tandem and tandem). Importantly, LFI is a liver
disease-specific, continuous variable (i.e. no ceiling or floor
effect) that can then be categorised into frail, pre-frail and
robust and assessed longitudinally. Over the last 3 years, the
LFI has been shown to be a good predictor of LT waiting list
mortality (independent of MELD-sodium, ascites, encephalopathy), hospital admissions and post-LT mortality and most
recently rates of acute cellular rejection [5•, 49••, 51–53].
There is a pressing need to validate the LFI in non-US countries, in the acutely unwell (i.e. acute-on-chronic liver failure),
inpatients and for studies to assess its dynamic ability to assess
response to nutritional/exercise interventions. In doing so,

indexes such as LFI could be used as a standard tool in all LT
units to facilitate clinical comparisons. It is, however, important to emphasise that there is no data to support a single frailty
cut-off at which a patient should not undergo LT [54•].
Impact of Sarcopenia in LT
Sarcopenia, regardless of how it is measured or whether it is
defined within physical frailty, is a strong predictor of clinically significant adverse outcomes before LT including: poor
quality of life [55], hepatic decompensation [56] (including
hepatic encephalopathy [57]), infection [58] and mortality
[14, 21, 38, 59]. It also predicts outcomes after LT as patients
with sarcopenia have a longer hospital stay, need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care, an increased risk of infection,
higher health care costs and an increased 1-year mortality post
LT [2, 6, 20•, 51, 53, 58, 60, 61].
Graft choice is determined by the pre-LT assessment of the
patient (i.e. age, disease severity, co-morbidities, surgical history) and is an integral part of a successful outcome post-LT.
Interestingly, a UK-based study of 232 consecutive LTs
highlighted that of those who received a marginal graft (i.e.
steatotic, cold ischaemia time > 12 h) the patients with malnutrition (as determined by the Royal Free Hospital-Global
Assessment tool) or muscle mass depletion (L3 on CT imaging) had significantly higher rates of infection and intensive
care/hospital length of stays; irrespective of their baseline
MELD [6]. Even though this requires further validation, it
highlights the importance of careful graft selection in patients
with sarcopenia or the need to re-evaluate graft choice after a
period of nutritional optimisation.
Management of Sarcopenia: a Multi-faceted
Approach
Unlike other risk factors associated with LT (i.e. age, MELD,
sex, donor type), sarcopenia and its counterparts of physical
frailty (malnutrition, poor functional status) are potentially
modifiable with lifestyle, nutrition, exercise and pharmacotherapy [31••, 32••, 48•, 62–65]. Even though it’s a hugely
neglected area in LT, incorporation of behavioural/
psychological therapies alongside nutrition and exercise advice, are likely to be key in motivating the patient, overcoming
their own personal/social barriers and maximising healthcare
engagement. Therefore, a multidisciplinary team (MDT) assessment and approach is integral in order to fully optimise the
muscle health and physical ‘functional’ performance status of
a patient, both before (prehabilitation) and after
(rehabilitation) LT [48•, 54•, 63]. Despite advances in recognition that sarcopenia and physical frailty result in adverse
outcomes in ESLD and LT, there remains very little data that
improving muscle mass ± function increases survival pre- and
post-LT [66, 67]. This is largely due to a lack of robust
prospective studies in this field and the multi-factorial complexity of this patient group (Table 1).
Lifestyle
All patients with ESLD and those on the LT waiting list, irrespective of aetiology, should be advised to abstain from alcohol and smoking. This is even more paramount in the ‘frailer’
patient as a result of the compound effect of ethanol and/or
smoking has on sarcopenia [68, 69]. It is also important to
optimise glycaemic control in patients with glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes in the setting of LT, as it is an integral
part of preventing and potentially reversing sarcopenia.
Insulin resistance and the resultant hyperinsulinaemic state
not only drive fat accumulation in the muscle (myosteatosis),
but also reduce protein synthesis and increase catabolism,
which together drive sarcopenia [57]. This is particularly pertinent in the immediate post-LT setting, as the standard inclusion of prednisolone in the immunosuppression regimen, not
only promotes hyperglycaemia but the debilitating early-onset
(atrophic) effects of glucocorticoids in the muscle are well
known [70].
Nutrition
The imbalance of increased muscle protein catabolism and
reduced protein synthesis occurs in patients with ESLD due
to a number of nutritional factors, including; an increased
catabolic state, reduced nutrient absorption and decreased
caloric/protein intake (i.e. early satiety, anorexia, nausea, encephalopathy) [71, 72]. Daily intake of total calories, proteins
and carbohydrates is inadequate in approximately 85–95% of
patients referred for LT assessment [73]. All patients undergoing assessment for LT, and ideally at the point of diagnosis of
ESLD, should undergo a comprehensive nutritional evaluation in the form of anthropometry (MAMC, HGS, tricep skin
fold thickness, calculated dry BMI) and accurate analysis of
food intake. The latter remains a challenge and has been a
rather neglected area of research in the last 5 years. To date,
several tools have been developed to assess food intake, including the 2-day, 3-day and 7-day food diaries, the Food
Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and the 24 h recall.
However, it still remains unclear in the literature which tool
is the most accurate as a result of limitations in reproducibility,
clinical availability and inaccurate reporting (especially in patients susceptible to encephalopathy). International guidelines,
as recent as 2019, are however consistent in their recommendations that an individual’s caloric and protein requirements
must be met by frequent feeding, oral dietary supplementation
and/or when indicated by (par) enteral routes [31••, 32••]. The
latter is particularly important in patients hospitalised with
acute deterioration, who are unlikely to meet their caloric
requirements.
132 Curr Hepatology Rep (2020) 19:128–137

In non-obese patients (based on estimated dry body weight)
the recommended daily caloric intake is at least 35 kcal/kg/
day, whereas this should be cautiously reduced by 500–
800 kcal/day in patients with sarcopenic obesity, in order to
promote reduction in excess adiposity [31••]. The precise caloric target to achieve this effectively and safely (i.e. losing
adipose mass whilst preserving/ improving muscle mass) remains unresolved [32••]. This is therefore a critical research
question moving forwards, especially in light of the rising
prevalence of NAFLD and its co-existing metabolic syndrome
in patients referred for LT [74]. One of the most influential
nutritional changes in advice over the last decade has been the
switch from active protein restriction [75] to the consistent
need to obtain high levels of protein intake, irrespective of
the severity of encephalopathy [31••, 32••]. The protein target
recommended is 1.5 g/kg/day, with this increasing up to
2.0 g/kg/day in cases of severe hepatic decompensation (e.g.
high MELD, regular paracentesis for refractory ascites) [31••].
The decision to formally advise vegetable-based (rich in
branched chain amino acids (BCAA)) over animal-based protein (rich in aromatic amino acids [AA]) intake still requires
further research. However, there does appear to be a rationale
argument for avoiding amino acids that are not metabolised by
muscle (i.e. aromatic AAs may promote encephalopathy) and
targeting those that reduce serum ammonia (i.e. BCAA via
glutamate-glutamine pathway) [76].
Patients with ESLD have ‘accelerated starvation’ and are
susceptible to rapid muscle catabolism with prolonged periods
of fasting. Therefore, a regular eating pattern of 2–3 hourly
meals and snacks should be encouraged, with emphasis on the
importance of not missing breakfast after an overnight fast
[72]. Although the optimal snack content is not defined in
the literature, a late-evening snack/before bedtime is recommended, with 50 g carbohydrate and up to 20 g protein commonly utilised [77].
Exercise
Over the last 5 years, there has been a drive to reverse physical
frailty and improve physical function/exercise capacity in patients awaiting LT. Indeed, in 2014 the American Society for
Transplantation set out a clear research agenda for exercise
interventions in patients awaiting solid-organ transplantation
[78]. The application of exercise training in patients awaiting
LT has previously lagged behind that of other forms of solidorgan transplantation (i.e. lung, heart), which in part may have
been due to anxieties surrounding acute increases in portal
pressures and the potential for variceal haemorrhage [79].
Reassuringly, however the Italian SportDiet study of 50 patients with compensated cirrhosis highlighted that 16-weeks
diet and exercise intervention was both safe and significantly
reduced portal pressures [80•]. To date, eleven studies (5 RCT,
5 observational, 1 case report) have demonstrated that exercise
improves anaerobic thresholds, peak VO2, 6MWD, muscle
mass/function and to a certain extent quality of life in patients
with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis [62, 81–83].
None of these studies investigated survival benefit and the
majority were small (1–50 patients), focus on supervised,
hospital-based aerobic exercise interventions (i.e. cycle ergometer) and largely excluded patients requiring a LT (i.e.
MELD > 12) [48•, 63, 84].
Large geographical areas, impractical travel times and
costs, ill health and family and/or work obligations tend to
limit the applicability of supervised (2–3× weekly) hospitalbased exercise interventions in patients awaiting LT [48•]. In
light of these limitations, recent studies (albeit small pilot
studies) have focused on the safety, feasibility and efficacy
of home-based exercise programmes in patients awaiting LT
[65, 84, 85]. In particular, one UK-based study (n = 18)
highlighted safety, compliance and improvements in physical
function (SPPB, daily step count, shuttle walk testing) whilst
on the LT waiting list, following a 12-week home-based combined aerobic (walking) and body-weight resistance exercises
(no additional equipment) [84]. Even though large RCTs are
still required, in general, a combination of a minimum of
12 weeks of aerobic (3 days/week) and resistance exercises
(2 days/week), performed at moderate-high intensity, should
be recommended to optimise muscle health and physical performance status whilst awaiting LT [48•]. Ideally, programmes
should be easily accessible (ideally home-based) and focus on
each individual’s barriers to exercise and baseline physical
frailty. Further research is also required to guide nutritional
replacement both before and after exercise, as this data is
currently lacking in patients with ESLD.
Following LT, several rehabilitation studies have demonstrated that predominantly supervised (only one home-based)
aerobic exercise improves measures of sarcopenia, exercise
capacity and reported to a lesser degree - quality of life [86,
87•, 88]. Similarly to the pre-LT setting, these studies are small
and heterogenous (timing, type, intensity), but highlight that
combined aerobic and resistance exercises yield the most
promising improvements.
Pharmacotherapy
Pharmacotherapy is another promising research area in
sarcopenia, with potential targets in including micronutrients,
vitamin D [89], ammonia-lowering treatments [90], hormonal
therapy (i.e. testosterone replacement in males [91•]) and Lcarnitine (an amino acid required for fatty acid oxidation, reported to suppress muscle loss) [92]. In particular, there has
been a lot of pre-clinical interest in myostatin antagonists [93]
and direct mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) [94] activators, which play key roles in protein
synthesis and skeletal muscle mass. In particular, myostatin
is a protein member of the transforming growth factor-β
Curr Hepatology Rep (2020) 19:128–137 133

(TGF-β) superfamily, which is produced and released by
myocytes and in turn inhibits muscle cell growth and differentiation. Even though the provisional murine/primate studies
have highlighted that myostatin antagonism results in increased muscle mass and performance, these interventions
are likely to require extensive ‘mechanistic’ pre-clinical study
and reproducible human clinical trials before they can be applied to routine clinical practice [93]. An extensive overview
of future pharmacotherapy targets is summarised elsewhere
[4•].
Summary
Patients with ESLD are for a multitude of factors at high risk
of sarcopenia and physical frailty beyond their years of life.
CT-confirmed sarcopenia and clinical measures of physical
frailty have been shown to be strong predictors of adverse
clinical outcomes and premature mortality; often independently to the severity of the liver disease itself. The clinicians’
ability to provide an objective assessment of the ‘frail’ liver
patient in the out-patient setting has been significantly advanced with the emergence of easy-to-perform indices of frailty (e.g. LFI). However, further research is required to understand the use of these tools as sequential measures of clinical
deterioration and/or response to multi-faceted interventions,
such (p)rehabilitation. Robust international ‘nutrition’ guidelines now exist for patients with ESLD, with specific emphasis
on high protein intake and 2–3 hourly food intake to minimise
periods of fasting. In parallel, evidence (albeit small sample
sizes) has emerged regarding the safety and efficacy of aerobic
and resistance-based exercises in patients with ESLD, whom
were previously felt to be too high risk to partake. Larger
RCTs are required to consolidate these findings and investigate the optimal type, frequency and intensity of aerobic and
resistance exercises. Future research also needs to focus on
specific behavioural/motivational techniques, additional
nutritional/micronutrients supplements (i.e. before/after exercise, late-night snack contents) and novel pharmacotherapies
in order to maximise the physical conditioning and reserve of
patients awaiting or recovering from LT.
