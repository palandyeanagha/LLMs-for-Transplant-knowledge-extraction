Description
An 83-year-old man presented with an acute history 
of weight loss and jaundice. He had a history of type 
2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He consumed 
30 units of alcohol per week.
The patient was cachectic and jaundiced with 
non-tender hepatomegaly and no evidence of 
chronic liver disease. There was evidence of hypoalbuminaemia (albumin 25g/L, reference 34–51g/L), 
hyperbilirubinaemia (bilirubin 188μmol/L, reference <22μmol/L) and a raised alkaline phosphatase (629 IU/L, reference 35–105 IU/L). Full 
blood count, coagulation tests and the remaining 
liver function tests were normal. An estimated 
Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 71mL/
min/1.73m2
. Autoantibodies and immunoglobulins were normal. Hepatitis viral serology was 
negative. Serum light chain measurements revealed 
kappa chain concentration of 13.3 (reference 
3.3–19.4mg/L) and lambda chain concentration of 
28.5 (reference 5.7–26.6mg/L) with a ratio of 0.47 
(reference 0.26–1.75). A CT abdomen revealed 
hepatomegaly and ascites. He subsequently had a 
liver biopsy (figures 1–3). The histology from the 
liver biopsy demonstrates hepatic amyloid with 
extensive deposition of extracellular hyaline material (figure 1A,B). Staining with Congo red shows 
characteristic salmon pink amorphous material 
(figure 2). Lambda staining shows diffuse positivity confirming AL-type amyloidosis (figure 3). A 
bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of bone 
marrow plasmacytosis or amyloid deposition.
Three weeks later, liver function deteriorated (bilirubin 349μmol/L, alkaline phosphatase 1072 IU/L).
Additionally, there was progressive kidney injury 
(eGFR 39mL/min/1.73m2
) with evidence of microalbuminuria (albumin:creatinine ratio 3.1mg/mmol)
presumed secondary to renal amyloid involvement.
Amyloidosis involves a complex pathway of 
extracellular protein deposition and poses significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. The most 
common subtype is primary/amyloid-light chain 
(AL) amyloidosis due to haematological disorders, 
commonly clonal plasma cell disorders. Secondary/
Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis due to chronic 
inflammation, infection or malignancy has become 
less common in recent years due to advancement 
in treatment for these conditions. Transthyretin 
(ATTR) amyloidosis is now the second most 
common subtype in the UK and includes wild-type 
ATTR (previously known as systemic senile amyloidosis) and hereditary ATTR.1
The deposition of protein in the gastrointestinal 
tract mostly occurs in the small bowel and liver. 
Hepatic deposition is not an uncommon consequence of amyloidosis, with one autopsy study identifying 70% of patients with primary amyloidosis 
having liver involvement.2
 However clinical manifestations of hepatic amyloidosis are rare. A review 
of 98 patients with hepatic amyloidosis concluded 
that weight loss, hepatomegaly and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels should warrant consideration 
of primary amyloidosis.3
 Hyperbilirubinaemia was 
a poor prognostic factor with a median survival of 
1month in patients with a level over 34μmol/L. If
considered, systemic amyloidosis can be diagnosed

through safer means such as subcutaneous fat or rectal biopsy, and 
liver biopsy is discouraged due to risk of bleeding.
The treatment for primary amyloidosis involves combination chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Regression of the disease is slow and clinical improvement is 
often not apparent until 6–12 months after completion of 
chemotherapy.1
 In view of progressive liver and renal involvement, aggressive treatment for this patient was deemed inappropriate due to a poor prognosis (estimated less than 6 weeks). He 
received best supportive care and died 3months after admission.

Learning points
► In systemic amyloidosis, deposition of protein occurs in a 
variety of tissues, yet it is the degree of organ impairment 
inflicted by protein deposition that is clinically relevant. 
Clinical manifestations of hepatic amyloidosis are rare and it 
is type-dependent.
► Hyperbilirubinaemia is a poor prognostic factor in hepatic 
amyloidosis.
► Liver biopsy can lead to a definite diagnosis of hepatic 
amyloidosis. However, it is not a requirement and should be 
initially discouraged due to risk of bleeding, unless alternative 
diagnosis is considered. A rectal biopsy or subcutaneous fat 
biopsy carries a high yield in establishing a diagnosis and 
should be considered to remove the need for unnecessary 
organ biopsies.
