Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is an important issue for liver transplant recipients, since increased ICP 
is associated with advanced hepatic encephalopathy or graft reperfusion during liver transplantation. Invasive 
monitoring of ICP is known as a gold standard method, but it can provoke bleeding and infection; thus, its use 
is a controversial issue. Studies have shown that optic nerve sheath diameter > 5 mm by ocular ultrasonography 
is useful for evaluating ICP > 20 mmHg noninvasively in many clinical settings. In this case report, we present 
experiences of using ocular ultrasound as a diagnostic tool that could detect changes in ICP noninvasively during 
liver transplantation. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2013; 64: 451-455)

Hepatic encephalopathy is associated with cerebral edema, 
increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and subsequent neurologic 
complications [1]. In addition, graft reperfusion during liver 
transplantation can increase ICP [2,3]. Thus, ICP monitoring has 
been proposed for the diagnosis and management of the high 
ICP during preoperative and intraoperative periods in criticallyill liver transplant recipients [4]. Although direct measurement 
of ICP using an intraventricular catheter has been known to be 
a gold standard method for evaluating ICP, it is a highly invasive 
technique that may not be feasible in many clinical settings 
due to the severe complications associated with its use, such 
as hemorrhage and infection [5]. For this reason, noninvasive 
techniques such as the transcranial Doppler (TCD) have been 
recommended for evaluating ICP [6]. Recently, ultrasonographic 
measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been 
increasingly used for the assessment of the risk of high ICP [7,8].
Herein, we report two interesting cases, in which simple 
and rapid assessment of ONSD by ocular ultrasonography was 
performed immediately before anesthesia induction or during 
graft reperfusion in liver transplant recipients recipients with 
acute liver failure.

Case Reports
Case 1
A 53-yr old woman (body weight: 63 kg, height: 162 cm) was 
scheduled for living donor liver transplantation due to acuteon-chronic liver failure. Thirteen years ago, she was diagnosed 
with hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis. Two days ago, she was 
intubated due to rapidly developing grade 3-4 hepatic encephalopathy. In the preoperative evaluation, the chest X-ray, 
electrocardiography, and echocardiography were within 
normal range. Her laboratory examination showed Hb 7.9 g/dl, 
platelet count 27 × 109/L, prothrombin time 3.5 international 
normalized ratio, fibrinogen 52 mg/dl, antithrombin III 6%, 
sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, creatinine 3.8 mg/
dl, glucose 163 mg/dl, albumin 3.1 g/dl, total bilirubin 52.8 mg/
dl, and ammonia 205 μmol/L. Her Child-Pugh and Model for 
End-Stage Liver Disease scores were 12 and 49, respectively. 
However, brain computerized tomography and invasive 
ICP monitoring could not be performed because the acute 
exacerbation of her clinical condition requires urgent liver 
transplantation.
Upon arrival at the operating room, she was still intubated 
and was in a comatose state. Dopamine of 10 μg/kg/min, 
dobutamine of 15 μg/kg/min, and norepinephrine of 0.1 μg/
kg/min had been administered continuously. Her systolic/
diastolic/mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were 
100/50/67 mmHg and 80 beats/min, respectively. After 
establishing the standard monitoring used in our institute, 
ultrasound ONSD measurements were done by a physician 
well-trained in ocular ultrasonography before anesthetic 
induction. Based on the method described in a previous report 
[8], both eyes were scanned using a 7.5-MHz probe (ProSound 
SSD-4000, ALOKA, Tokyo, Japan) through closed eyelids with 
the patient in the supine position. Right and left eyes were 
scanned in both sagittal and transverse planes, and the ONSD 
value was calculated by estimating the average results of these 
measurements. The ONSD was measured 3 mm posterior to the 
globe in each eye. Her ONSD just before anesthesia induction 
was 6.4 mm (Fig. 1A). Simultaneously, TCD was performed 
to assess cerebral blood flow velocity and ICP noninvasively. 
Transtemporal insonation of the left middle cerebral artery was 
done using a 2-MHz probe (Companion III, Viasys Healthcare, 
Warwick, UK). TCD measurements showed her systolic/
diastolic/mean cerebral flow velocities were 100/7/37 cm/s 
(normal reference values of systolic/diastolic/mean velocities 
[mean ± SD]: 77.1 ± 12.23/37.4 ± 7.13/50.6 ± 8.42 cm/s). The 
resistance index was 0.93 (normal reference value: 0.52 ± 0.05) 
and the pulsatility index was 2.5 (normal reference value: 0.80 ± 
0.13), and the second systolic peak (Windkessel effect) was lost, 
suggesting elevated ICP (Fig. 1B) [6,9]. The bispectral index and 
suppression ratio were 30 and 20, respectively, and right and left 
regional cerebral oxygen saturations were 15/15%.
Anesthesia was induced with thiopental and vecuronium, 
and was maintained using 0.5-1% isoflurane, a 50% O2/
air mixture, and continuous infusion with fentanyl and 
vecuronium. The patient’s lungs were ventilated with a tidal 
volume of 10-12 ml/kg at a respiratory rate of 10-12 breaths/
min to maintain hypocarbia (PaCO2: 28-32 mmHg) throughout 
the procedure. Also, mild hypothermia (34-35oC) was induced, 
and mannitol of 40 g was administered every six hours for the 
management of ICP. After anesthesia induction, her arterial 
blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.33, a PaCO2 of 28 mmHg, a 
PaO2 of 209 mmHg, bicarbonate of 14.8 mEq/L, and base excess 
of -10.0 mmEq/L. Intraoperative hemodynamics and laboratory 
data were shown Table 1.
After finishing surgery, she was transferred to the surgical 
intensive care unit. On the second postoperative day, right

with acute-on-chronic liver failure 
(case 1). Note that the ONSD (6.4 mm) 
is dilated, suggesting increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Also, note that 
the second systolic peak (Windkessel 
effect) is lost, the systolic peak is sharp 
and narrow, and the diastolic cerebral 
blood flow velocity is low, suggesting a 
high ICP.

and left pupil size were 3/3 mm. According to Glasgow coma 
scale evaluation, eye opening score was 4, best motor response 
score was 4, best verbal response score was not evaluated due 
to endotracheal intubation. Bispectral index score ranged from 
70 to 90. However, on the third postoperative day, she was 
developed septic shock, and the patient died by septic shock on 
the fourth postoperative day.
Case 2
A 40-yr old man (body weight: 73 kg, height: 172 cm) was 
scheduled for living donor liver transplantation surgery due to 
acute liver failure. One week ago, he developed grade 1 hepatic 
encephalopathy. In the preoperative evaluation, electrocardiography and echocardiography were within normal range. 
Chest X-ray showed mild pleural effusion on both lungs. His 
laboratory examination showed Hb 9.9 g/dl, platelet count 107 
× 109/L, prothrombin time 2.2 international normalized ratio, 
fibrinogen 82 mg/dl, antithrombin III 12%, sodium 135 mmol/L, 
potassium 3.0 mmol/L, creatinine 1.1 mg/dl, glucose 144 mg/
dl, albumin 3.0 g/dl, total bilirubin 23.1 mg/dl, and ammonia 82 
μmol/L. Her Child-Pugh and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
scores were 12 and 28, respectively.
Upon arrival at the operating room, his mental state was 
alert. His systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressure and heart 
rate were 132/68 mmHg and 98 beats/min, respectively. After 
establishing institutional standard monitoring, an ultrasound 
ONSD measurement was done by a physician well-trained 
in ocular ultrasonography. His ONSD just before anesthesia 
induction was 4.8 mm (Fig. 2A). The bispectral index and 
suppression ratio were 98 and 0, respectively, and right and 
left regional cerebral oxygen saturations were 43 and 44%, 
respectively.
General anesthesia was induced and maintained by the 
standard protocol at our institute. His lungs were ventilated with 
a tidal volume of 8-10 ml/kg at a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/
min (PaCO2, 35-40 mmHg). Intraoperative hemodynamics and 
laboratory data were shown Table 1. He experienced severe 
hypotension (systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressure: 62/48 
mmHg) and bradycardia (56 beats/min) after graft reperfusion, 
and was treated with epinephrine (20 μg), after which systolic/
diastolic arterial blood pressure (122/72 mmHg) and heart rate 
(92 beats/min) rapidly recovered to within the normal limit. His 
ONSD was dilated at 5.7 mm to 5 min after reperfusion (Fig. 2B), 
and hyperventilation was performed with a tidal volume of 12 
ml/kg at a respiratory rate of 13 breaths/min (PaCO2, 28 mmHg). 
His ONSD decreased to 5.1 mm at 30 min after reperfusion (Fig. 
2C), and ventilation was adjusted to maintain normocarbia 
until the end of surgery. He was moved to the surgical intensive 
care unit after surgery, and then transferred to a general ward 
without any complications on the seventh postoperative day.
Discussion
Noninvasive estimation of ultrasonographic ONSD has 
been reported to be a useful method for evaluating elevated 
ICP (defined as ICP > 20 mmHg). In case 1 of a liver transplant 
recipient with grade 4 hepatic encephalopathy, we evaluated 
elevated ICP using ultrasonographic ONSD and TCD flow 
velocity before anesthesia induction. In case 2, we evaluated 
ONSD during the graft reperfusion period. This patient 
had grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy and showed a normal 
ONSD before anesthesia induction and had a dilated ONSD 
immediately after reperfusion. We also found that the dilated 
ONSD decreased after hyperventilation.

Advanced hepatic encephalopathy (grade 3 and 4) is 
associated with the development of cerebral edema, which is 
usually diagnosed by detecting an increased ICP [1]. Indeed, 
cerebral edema and a high ICP can decrease cerebral perfusion 
pressure, resulting in brain damage and mortality. During liver 
transplantation, the graft reperfusion period is critical due to the 
high risk of acute hemodynamic changes, which can range from 
a mild hypotensive episode to profound cardiovascular collapse, 
known as the postreperfusion syndrome. Furthermore, the 
reperfusion of a new graft can induce an increase in ICP, which 
is possibly related to cerebral vessel dilatation and vasoactive 
substances [2,10,11]. Thus, these observations suggest that liver 
transplant recipients are particularly exposed to high ICP and 
decreased cerebral perfusion pressure during the perioperative 
period, and that intraoperative ICP monitoring is important in 
patients with high ICP-related neurologic abnormalities.
Invasive monitoring of ICP is known to be a gold standard 
method; however, it may not be feasible in recipients undergoing liver transplantation, since severe coagulopathy can 
develop as a result of preexisting coagulopathy, dilutional 
coagulopathy, fibrinolysis, hypocalcemia, hypothermia, intravascular coagulation, or the heparin effect during liver transplantation surgery, which exposes patients to a greater risk of 
hemorrhage.
The optical nerve sheath is continuous with the dura mater 
of the brain, and has a subarachnoid space [12]. The subarachnoid space in the optic nerve sheath communicates with 
the craniospinal subarachnoid space, and thus ONSD can 
be influenced by changes in cerebrospinal fluid pressure in 
the cranial cavity [12]. Moreover, it is well known that ONSD 
measured 3 mm behind the optic globe is increased by 
elevated ICP [13]. Based on these considerations, noninvasive 
measurement of ONSD has been increasingly attempted 
for monitoring ICP in many clinical settings [8]. Especially, 
ultrasonographic ONSD assessment has proven to be useful for 
monitoring high ICP in patients with brain injury, idiopathic 
intracranial hypertension, and spontaneous intracranial 
hemorrhage [7,13,14].
Moretti et al. [7] reported that there is a linear correlation 
between ONSD and an invasive ICP measurement, and that a 
significant reduction of the ONSD occurs after cerebrospinal 
fluid drainage for the management of high ICP (ONSD: from 
5.89 to 5.0 mm). They also suggested that the optimal cut off 
value of ONSD to predict ICP > 20 mmHg is 5.2 mm [7]. In 
another study, the best cut off value of ONSD for predicting 
elevated ICP was reported to be in the range of 5.0-5.9 mm 
in neurocritically ill adults [8]. However, there is limited 
information available about the usefulness of ultrasonographic 
ONSD assessment in liver transplant recipients, who may 
experience severe coagulopathy and high ICP during liver 
transplantation. We found that ultrasonographic ONSD was 6.4 
mm before induction in one recipient (case 1) with advanced 
hepatic encephalopathy and 5.7 mm after graft reperfusion in 
another recipient (case 2), indicating high ICP. Based on these 
findings, we believe that noninvasive estimation of ocular 
ultrasonography can provide important information about ICP 
during liver transplantation.
Treatment strategies such as hyperventilation, hypothermia, 
and mannitol administration have been employed for the 
management of high ICP. Especially, mild hyperventilation 
prior to graft reperfusion was shown to prevent the increase 
in ICP above the pre-reperfusion level in TCD flow velocity, 
suggesting that hyperventilation may be effective in reducing 
reperfusion-related high ICP during liver transplantation [15]. 
In case 2, the dilated ONSD observed after graft reperfusion was 
decreased by hyperventilation. It is not clear whether shortFig. 2. Changes in optic nerve sheath 
diameters (ONSD, dash line) (A) 
before induction of general anesthesia, 
(B) 5 min, and (C) 30 min after graft 
reperfusion in a liver transplant recipient 
with acute liver failure (A: 4.8 mm, B: 5.7 
mm, C: 5.1 mm) (case 2). Note that the 
dilated ONSD > 5 mm after reperfusion 
decreases 30 min after reperfusion.

term hyperventilation induces directly a reduction in ONSD. 
However, we consider that it may, at least in part, influence the 
change in ONSD. This finding suggests that ultrasonographic 
ONSD measurement provides useful information about the 
effectiveness of treatments used to lower ICP in liver transplant 
recipients with high ICP.
TCD can also be used to evaluate high ICP noninvasively 
by measuring cerebral blood flow velocity. TCD findings in 
case 1 agree with those of a report by Aggarwal et al. [9], in 
which high ICP induced a loss of the second systolic peak 
(Windkessel effect) and a sharpness of the systolic peak in the 
TCD waveform. Also, TCD-derived indices such as diastolic 
and mean cerebral blood flow velocities have been used for 
the calculation of ICP [6]. Based on the previous report, ICP 
can be assessed noninvasively by TCD using the following 
formula [6]: estimated ICP = the mean arterial blood pressure 
× (1 - diastolic flow velocity/mean flow velocity) - 14. The 
ICP calculated by the formula was 40 mmHg in our liver 
transplant recipient (case 1), supporting that the dilated ONSD 
is associated with ICP > 20 mmHg. 
In this case report, we can not examine simultaneously ONSD 
and TCD at several specific time points (such as anhepatic 
phase, post-reperfusion phase, or neohepatic phase) during 
liver transplantation. Further studies will be required to evaluate 
the ICP status by simultaneous examinations of ONSD and 
TCD at specific time points. In addition, a possible limitation of 
ocular ONSD measurement is intra-observer or inter-observer 
variability, which is dependent on clinical experience and skill 
of observers. However, we consider that ONSD measurements 
are highly reliable because they were done by a physician welltrained in ocular ultrasonography.
In summary, the cases described in this report suggest that 
ultrasound measurement of ONSD may have clinical relevance 
as a feasible diagnostic tool for the noninvasive, rapid, and 
simple detection of increased ICP in liver transplant recipients.
