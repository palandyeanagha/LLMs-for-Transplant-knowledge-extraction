Abstract
Purpose of Review This article aims to review published outcomes associated with full-thickness vascularized abdominal wall
transplantation, with particular emphasis on advances in the field in the last 3 years.
Recent Findings Forty-six full-thickness vascularized abdominal wall transplants have been performed in 44 patients worldwide.
Approximately 35% of abdominal wall transplant recipients will experience at least one episode of acute rejection in the first year
after transplant, compared with rejection rates of 87.8% and 72.7% for hand and face transplant respectively. Recent evidence
suggests that combining a skin containing abdominal wall transplant with an intestinal transplant does not appear to increase
sensitization or de novo donor-specific antibody formation.
Summary Published data suggests that abdominal wall transplantation is an effective safe solution to achieve primary closure of
the abdomen after intestinal or multivisceral transplant. However, better data is needed to confirm observations made and to
determine long-term outcomes, requiring standardized data collection and reporting and collaboration between the small number
of active transplant centres around the world.

Introduction
Abdominal wall transplantation is principally indicated to
achieve expansion of the abdominal domain and abdominal
wall closure after intestinal transplantation. Closure of the
abdominal wall after intestinal transplant (ITx) or
multivisceral transplant (MVT) is an essential element in
preventing complications and preserving transplant function.
An open abdomen after ITx or MVT may lead to sepsis and
fistula formation, whilst closure under excessive tension risks

abdominal compartment syndrome, bowel ischemia and respiratory compromise [1••, 2]. Inability to achieve primary closure after transplantation occurs in approximately 20–40% of
cases. This is commonly a result of loss of abdominal domain
due to a combination of extensive intra-abdominal scarring
(multiple preceding laparotomies and enterocutaneous fistulae) and post-transplant bowel oedema [1••, 3].
Several reconstructive options have been described to augment closure in these complex cases, including component
separation, tissue expansion, use of absorbable and nonabsorbable mesh, acellular dermal matrices, pedicled thigh
flaps and vascularized or non-vascularized rectus fascia grafts
[4••, 5–9]. However, in malnourished, total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-dependent patients undergoing transplantation,
many of these options carry significant additional morbidity.
In 2001, Levi et al reported vascularized, full-thickness abdominal wall transplants (AW-VCA) as an alternative solution for abdominal wall closure after ITx [1••]. Retrieving the
entire anterior abdominal wall, as part of multiorgan procurement, allowed ‘like-for-like’ reconstruction, with no donor
site morbidity for the recipient. Crucially, this early report
was not associated with increased immunosuppression requirements when compared to ITx in isolation, encouraging
further development of the technique.
The aim of this article is to review the published literature
on abdominal wall transplantation, with particular emphasis
on outcomes and advances in the field of AW-VCA over the
last 3 years. We have excluded cases of abdominal fascial
transplantation performed in-continuity with the liver, as these
were not separate transplants and did not include muscle or
skin components.
The data presented in this article is from a comprehensive
literature search of the PubMed and EMBASE electronic databases on the 4th of April 2020. Search terms included ‘abdominal wall transplant’, ‘vascularized composite allotransplantation’, ‘VCA’ and ‘intestinal transplant’. Only articles
relating to full-thickness vascularized AW-VCA, with sufficient data to facilitate comparative analysis, were included.
Updated International Experience
with AW-VCA
Over the last two decades, 46 full-thickness AW-VCAs
have been performed in 44 patients. Seven international
units in five countries have now performed AW-VCAs,
with Duke the most recent new unit to perform an AWVCA in 2018. There are many units advertising AW-VCA
capability who are yet to perform AW-VCA, which is indicative of the interest in the technique. An updated summary of the international experience of AW-VCA can be
seen in Table 1.
Indications for AW-VCA
AW-VCA is principally indicated when candidates for intestinal transplantation have loss of the abdominal domain due to
(1) multiple previous laparotomies, perforations and subsequent adhesions; (2) extensive enterocutaneous fistulae (e.g.
secondary to Crohn’s disease or due to surgical complications); (3) abdominal wall fibrosis and scarring preventing
wall expansion, e.g. following previous abdominal wall radiotherapy, or healing by secondary intention; and (4) resection
of the abdominal wall due to tumour involvement (desmoid/
pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP)) (Fig. 1). AW-VCA may
also be indicated as a technique to reconstruct massive herniation when no other techniques are possible, or have previously failed, especially for patients that already have a transplant and are immunosuppressed.
A summary of the indications for ITx can be seen in
Table 2. Difficulty in abdominal wall closure after intestinal
transplantation occurs in 40% of recipients [2, 21].
Difficulties, and hence indications that are more likely to require AW-VCA, commonly occur after a significant period of
intestinal failure and cachexia. The resulting short gut syndrome following significant intestinal resection leaves a
scaphoid abdomen with little abdominal domain, especially
against a background of multiple abdominal wall scars from
previous procedures, stomas and/or fistulae. By contrast, patients with PMP often have expanded abdominal cavities and
do not need AW-VCA unless there has been significant abdominal wall resection required for tumour involvement.
The indications for AW-VCA is an ongoing area of controversy. Many centres feel that non-transplant methods of
abdominal wall reconstruction are adequate, and may avoid
the additional morbidity and complexity AW-VCA adds to an
already complex procedure. These centres either reduce the
quantity of intestinal graft transplanted, restrict donors to
smaller sizes or lower BMIs or use techniques such as staged
closure, expansion, component separation, flaps, grafts or implants such as biological or prosthetic supplementary closure,
despite the associated increased risks of these techniques.
Against these known risks are balanced the relatively unknown risks of adding an AW-VCA to an ITx. Traditional
immunological teaching and understanding has always been
that skin is the most immunogenic organ in the body. As such,
the main fear was that by transplanting skin in addition to a
visceral transplant, there would be an increased risk of immunological rejection, an increase in immunosuppression requirements and an increased risk of sensitizing the patient to
produce anti-donor antibodies, prompting chronic rejection
and fibrosis, or leading to graft versus host disease (GVHD)
due to the large quantities of immunologically active cells in
skin. There were also fears that AW-VCA would lead to extended operative times and stress, potentially endangering the
patient and increasing the ischaemia reperfusion burden.
280 Curr Transpl Rep (2020) 7:279–290

More controversy exists when considering AW-VCA
transplantation in patients with a history of malignancy,
due to concerns that immunosuppression may lead to cancer recurrence. However, a number of cases have now been
reported [22–24]. Despite initial technical successes reported in these VCA recipients, long-term outcomes relating to
cancer recurrence are not available. It remains unknown
whether an additional AW-VCA transplant increases the
risk of malignancy compared to ITx alone. There are a
number of case reports of mortalities resulting from overwhelming new or recurrent malignancies following facial
transplantation [25, 26]. However, to-date, this has not
been the case in AW-VCA, with follow-up extending beyond 4 years.
Future Indications for AW-VCA
Oxford have performed one isolated AW-VCA for reconstruction of a massive hernia in a patient with an existing
functional kidney transplant. As the patient was already immunosuppressed, the ethical debate about non-life saving
transplantation was avoided, though there was debate regarding risk to the kidney transplant. Two units from the USA
have now performed penis VCAs that included varying
amounts of abdominal wall within the transplant [27••, 28].
This new combined VCA, without associated visceral organ
transplantation, offers hope for many war veterans who have
sustained composite genitourinary and abdominal wall
injuries.

These examples raise the possibility of AW-VCA transplantation as a reconstructive option for patients with massive
abdominal wall defects that cannot be reconstructed by other
methods. The need for AW-VCA will need to be balanced
against the risks of immunosuppression.
Technical Considerations
Work-Up for Combined AW-VCA and ITx/MVT/MMVT
Standard pre-operative protocols for ITx, MVT or modified
multivisceral transplant (MMVT) are followed, with no additional requirements for simultaneous AW-VCA. ABO
matching of donors and recipients is routinely performed
and the HLA status of the patient is known. Consent for
AW-VCA is obtained from donor families and recipients, including counselling for possible skin tone mismatch. A pretransplant computed tomography scan gives an indication of
recipient abdominal capacity and also images the inferior epigastric, deep circumflex iliac and internal mammary vessels,
as potential recipient vessels for AW-VCA.
Venous drainage is a frequent issue for these patients due to
multiple, and prolonged venous access for parenteral nutrition. However, inferior vena cava and iliac vein thrombosis
and occlusions are not contraindications to AW-VCA as in
our experience, despite IVC occlusion, drainage via patent
inferior epigastric veins somehow bypasses the occlusion. In
the absence of inferior epigastric veins, alternative veins can
be used as described later.
No additional procurement criteria are raised that might
restrict offers or procurement such as skin tone, sex, size, or
other matching characteristics as occurs in VCA hand and face
transplantation.
AW-VCA Retrieval
The donor AW-VCA is retrieved as part of routine multiorgan
transplant procurement. Most commonly, the AW-VCA and
intestinal or multivisceral graft originate from the same donor.
However, three cases of delayed AW-VCA, from different
donors have also been reported [1, 13]. Full thickness AWVCA comprises peritoneum, posterior rectus sheath, both rectus abdominis muscles, anterior rectus sheath, overlying fat,
skin and parts of the internal and external obliques and
transversus abdominis. The AW-VCA is most commonly retrieved using a longitudinal elliptical incision over both rectus
abdominus muscles, permitting direct closure of the donor
defect. Though this limits the width of the skin component
to a few centimetres lateral to the linea semilunaris, the

musculoaponeurotic component can include the obliques and
transversalis laterally to the costal margins and iliac crests.
Contrary to the experimental studies performed by Light
et al in 2017, it is our experience that these lateral muscles
extending to their origins and a near-total anterior abdominal
wall can be successfully vascularized on the inferior epigastric
supply alone [29].
Vascular Anastomosis
AW-VCA can be performed using a macroscopic or microscopic approach. In the macroscopic approach, larger calibre
iliac vessels as a cuff or conduit to the inferior epigastric vessels are used for anastomosis to the recipient iliac or femoral
arteries. However, this method may not be possible in the
setting of liver retrieval, where the iliac vessels are also retrieved for the purpose of liver inset [4••]. The microscopic
approach uses the donor and recipient inferior epigastric vessels, anastomosed in an end-end fashion (Fig. 2).
In order to minimize ischaemia reperfusion injury and cold
ischaemia time, and to reduce operative time in fragile patients, Giele et al. described immediate, temporary revascularization of AW-VCA grafts onto the recipients’ ulnar or radial
arteries [16]. This technique is performed simultaneously
alongside ITx or MMVT. Following completion of visceral
transplantation, the patient’s physiological status and recipient
vessel status are assessed. If the patient remains physiologically stable and vessels are identified, then direct microsurgical anastomosis is performed, and the recipient forearm vessels are repaired. If the patient is unstable, then the AW-VCA
remains perfused by the forearm vessels and is pedicled to
allow closure of abdominal wall. At a 4–6-week interval, the
pedicle from the forearm can be divided, the flap having
established a vascular supply from the adjacent native abdominal wall. If there is doubt regarding AW-VCA vascularity,
this can be augmented with a microsurgical anastomosis to the
inferior epigastric or internal mammary vessels as required.
This technique can also be used when the inferior epigastric
vessels are of poor quality. Alternative recipient vessels are
the deep circumflex iliac that we, and the unit in Bologna,
have used with success. We suggest an additional iliac crest
incision to approach these vessels rather than accessing them
through the midline laparotomy. We have also revascularized
the AW-VCA through the intestinal transplant graft using arterial grafts to the superior mesenteric artery stump with venous drainage via vein grafts to the transplanted splenic vein
on one side and a gonadal vein on the other.
Erdmann et al. describe an alternative approach for synchronous revascularization of ITx and AW-VCA. They create
bilateral arteriovenous (AV) fistulae, by dissecting the saphenous veins, at the level of the mid-thigh, and rotating them
through 180°, before performing end-to-side anastomosis
with the common femoral arteries. The left AV fistula is
transected and an end-to-end anastomosis with the donor inferior epigastric artery and vein is performed using 7-0
Prolene sutures. After adequate perfusion is achieved, the
AW-VCA is temporarily secured to the thigh until ITx is
completed. Subsequently, revascularization of the right side
is then performed and the AW-VCA inset [10•, 30].
As mentioned earlier, venous drainage is often more troublesome than the arterial input due to long-term venous access
issues. In addition to the strategies already mentioned, in the
event of occlusion or deficient inferior epigastric veins, we
have on occasion drained the AW-VCA via the deep circumflex iliac vessels or via the mesenteric veins through the intestinal transplant.
Postoperative Monitoring for Rejection
All units employ routine endoscopic intestinal biopsies as part
of local intestinal transplant monitoring. The previous Oxford
protocol included protocol-driven endoscopies and mucosal
biopsies, performed three times a week for the first 3 months,
then twice a week for the next 3 months and subsequently at
an interval of one endoscopy every 2 weeks until stoma closure, and then once a year for routine check-ups. However,
current protocols due in part to the useful presence of the
abdominal wall skin no longer includes protocol biopsies but
relies on monitoring of stoma output and serum citrulline
levels as well as skin monitoring. In addition, intestinal endoscopies are performed in response to episodes of suspected
rejection [15]. ITx biopsies are reported in accordance with
universally recognized histological rejection criteria [31].
Follow-up for AW-VCA in Oxford comprises of visual
inspection of colour, warmth and capillary refill. Skin biopsies
are only taken if there is a clinical suspicion of AW-VCA such
as erythema, rash or oedema, or if there is suspected or biopsy
proven intestinal transplant rejection. AW-VCA skin biopsy

results are reported in accordance with the Banff 2007 working classification of skin-containing composite tissue allograft
pathology [32].
Clinical Outcomes for AW-VCA
The following clinical outcomes are from published studies.
Thirteen publications yielded data for 37 AW-VCA grafts in
35 patients, performed between 2001 and 2020 [1••, 10•, 11,
12, 14•, 18]. Three cases from Chennai, and the five most
recent cases performed in Oxford, were excluded as they are
currently unpublished. Limited data exists for the single case
report from Indiana. Four original articles detailing clinical
experience with AW-VCA have been published over the last
3 years [10•, 11, 12, 14•]. Clinical outcomes and complications
relating to AW-VCA are summarized in Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Operative Outcomes
The aim of AW-VCA is to expand the abdominal domain to
accommodate the intestinal transplant and to permit primary
closure thus avoiding associated complications. The outcomes
regarding the period spent in intensive care, return to theatre,
time to wound healing, abdominal compartment pressures or
its surrogate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or duration of
hospital stay are poorly recorded. What is published suggests
that the primary aim of expanding the abdominal domain and
achieving primary closure was achieved in all cases. There
does not seem to be a need to innervate the abdominal musculature as the rate of herniation or bulging seems low, with
three reports of patients being able to contract their abdominal
muscles following AW-VCA [15, 18].
Improved recording of events is needed to determine if
AW-VCA achieves the additional goals of reducing complications, return to theatre and length of stay.

Patient Survival
Patient survival data for publications relating to AW-VCA is
challenging to interpret and compare. No studies present survival data as standard 30 day, 1-, 3- or 5-year survival figures,
or as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Oxford reported 33%
deaths in 18 patients with AW-VCA and ITx, and Miami
and Bologna combined their figures and reported 64% deaths
in their 15 grafts in 14 patients. With that in mind, our best
estimate is that at least 53% of patients who received AWVCA with ITx or MVT/MMVT were still alive at the time of
publication (mean follow-up range 6 to 85 months). Cause of
death for all units included: sepsis (n = 4); recalcitrant acute
rejection (n = 1); CMV enteritis (n = 1); cerebral oedema/
hyperammonaemia (n = 1); GVHD (n = 1); upper gastrointestinal bleed (n = 1), transplant pancreatitis (n = 1); primary nonfunction of the transplanted intestine (n = 1); PTLD (n = 1).
This is comparable to non-VCA visceral transplant recipients
[14•]. All AW-VCAs were reported to be functioning at the
time of death and no patients died secondary to complications
from the AW-VCA. Our estimated survival figures appear to
reflect published 1- and 3-year survival figures for corresponding intestinal transplants [33].
AW-VCA Loss
AW-VCA losses can be considered as those that occur immediately postoperatively due to poor perfusion and later losses
due to chronic rejection or explantation for other reasons.
Immediate postoperative losses for all units is currently
4.3% (2/46). The Miami Group lost two AW-VCAs in the
early postoperative period. The first was lost due to venous
outflow obstruction and graft thrombosis at day 6 after transplantation, with eventual healing due to secondary intention.
The second graft was lost on day 1 post-transplant due to
primary non-function of the intestinal graft and associated
hypoperfusion of the AW-VCA, requiring removal of both
transplants. Late losses represent 2.5%, or a risk of 3% of
grafts that survive. Gerlach et al. from Oxford report explantation of one AW-VCA and ITx after 30 months due to chronic rejection of the AW-VCA and ITx. The patient ultimately
underwent retransplantation [15]. The rate and risk of losses of
AW-VCA compare favourably to other VCAs and to solid
organ transplants [34].
Visceral Graft Loss After Combined AW-VCA and ITx,
MVT or MMVT
ITx graft loss is closely associated with death. Weissenbacher
et al. report 1- and 3-year intestinal graft survival rates of 94%
and 57% respectively. This compares to 1- and 3-year intestinal graft survival rates of 78% and 70% (p = 0.67) in patients
with ITx/MMVT alone [14•]. Miami reported 2/12 intestinal
graft losses due to post-op perfusion problems and recalcitrant
rejection, but with less than 33 months follow-up of the remainder. There does not seem to be an increased rate of patient
or intestinal graft loss associated with AW-VCA.

Immunological Outcomes
Immunosuppression Protocols
Individual induction, maintenance and rescue immunosuppression protocols between units are summarized in Table 3.
Miami, Oxford, Chennai and Bologna use induction with intravenous alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody)
followed by tacrolimus monotherapy for long-term maintenance. The other units used thymoglobulin induction and triple therapy maintenance using tacrolimus, mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF) and steroids. Indiana excluded the MMF.
Rescue therapy consists of IV corticosteroids in a weaning
protocol. Most cases of AW-VCA and ITx acute cellular rejection (ACR) were successfully managed with intravenous
corticosteroids.
Trentadue et al. from Groningen in the Netherlands have
also described the successful use of the humanized mouse
anti-a4b7 monoclonal antibody Vedolizumab in the management of recurrent recalcitrant ACR in an AW-VCA patient
[11•].
Donor-Specific Antibodies
Measurement of donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) and nonDSAs forms part of routine pre-transplant work-up. It is possible for transplant recipients to be pre-sensitized by alloantigens after pregnancy, previous transfusions or previous transplants. However, the majority of DSAs develop after transplantation has occurred [35, 36]. The development and management of pre-sensitized VCA recipients has now been reported [37]. The clinical significance of DSAs in VCA remains poorly defined, and even a recent multicentre study in
hand transplant recipients was unable to highlight a strong
statistical correlation between DSA and hand allograft survival and function. However, trends appear to support poorer
outcomes after the development of DSAs (especially after
HLA class 2 mismatch) [35].
Weissenbacher et al. investigated the role of de novo DSAs
(dnDSA) following combined ITx and AW-VCA, and found
that the addition of a VCA to the ITx did not appear to increase
sensitization or dnDSA formation, when compared to ITx
alone [14•]. This finding was of particular interest as it goes
against traditional concepts regarding the high antigenicity of
skin compared to other tissue types.
Episodes of Acute Cellular Rejection
At least one episode of biopsy proven ACR affected 35% (13/
37) of AW-VCA grafts, and 22% (8/37) of ITx grafts in the
first post-transplant year. These results compare favourably
with hand and face VCA skin ACR rates of 87.8% and
72.7% respectively, in the first post-transplant year [34].
Intestinal transplant rejection rates are reported at 30–50%,
indicating that the addition of an AW-VCA does not appear
to increase the risk of ITx rejection.
When interpreting rates of ACR in published literature, one
must pay close attention to the denominator. For example, the
Miami Group lost two AW-VCA grafts in two patients in the
very early postoperative period. In subsequent combined publications with Bologna, both patients were included in the
denominator of calculations relating to AW-VCA ACR, when
they had little time to develop ACR, and as such likely leads
an under estimation of ACR rates.
To date, Oxford have reported no cases of ITx ACR without preceding, or simultaneous AW-VCA skin ACR. This
demonstrates uni-directional concordant rejection between
skin and intestine when intestine rejected, but discordant rejection on most occasions when skin rejected as the intestine
did not reject at that time. This may have been because the
skin rejection was detected and treated early in the immunological process before intestinal rejection manifested.
Oxford reported 37% (7/19) of AW-VCA grafts had at
least one biopsy confirmed ACR event presenting as a visible
skin rash. Three of these seven patients had associated intestinal transplant rejection at presentation or within a few days,
confirmed by biopsy. There were no intestinal rejection events
without skin rejection. This 17% (3/18) rate of intestinal ACR
compares favourably against the rejection incidence of 36%
(5/14) in patients who received only an intestinal transplant
and no AW-VCA. There was no evidence that the presence of
a VCA increased the frequency of intestinal rejection episodes
(p = 0.23) or overall rejection events [14•]. This goes some
way to alleviating the concern that the addition of an AWVCA would increase rejection events or immunosuppressive
requirements either in maintenance dosing or rejection treatment dosing. In their case report, Erdmann et al. from Duke
did not correlate their single episode of AW-VCA ACR with
biopsy confirmed ITx rejection [10•].
In contrast, in the 14 cases reported by Miami and Bologna,
AW-VCA rejection was seen in 4/13 patients. They also reported intestinal rejection in two patients, but AW-VCA and
intestinal rejections did not occur together and were always
discordant. This series has limited follow-up of between 1 and
33 months. It is worth considering that in two of the four
patients who suffered rejection of the AW-VCA, the AWVCAs were from different donors to the visceral transplant.
Furthermore, the absence of AW-VCA rejection in the presence of intestinal rejection was assessed clinically rather than
by biopsy [18, 19]. In Groningen, they reported intestinal
biopsy proven rejection occurring at day 6 after transplantation, preceding skin biopsy changes by 15 days [11•]. The
authors are aware that the skin of the AW-VCA showed erythema on the day of the intestinal rejection but the biopsy
reported at that time showed only mild non-specific inflammatory changes, not diagnostic of rejection. Skin biopsies
286 Curr Transpl Rep (2020) 7:279–290

only became diagnostically positive for rejection 15 days later.
That this episode of rejection occurred so rapidly after administration of the induction agent anti-thymocyte globulin
(ATG) raises the possibility that ATG has a disproportionate
effect on AW-VCA skin.
VCA skin as an immune monitor in intestinal transplantation
The findings detailed above may indicate that signs of
ACR on the AW-VCA skin (rash, erythema, oedema)
may allow early detection and treatment of ACR, prior
to detectable rejection in the intestine [15]. In Oxford, this
finding has facilitated a reduction in endoscopies and permits remote monitoring and follow-up of combined AWVCA and ITx recipients via telemedicine [38]. However,
it seems that discordant intestinal rejection can occur so
the utility of skin as a diagnostic tool for intestinal rejection remains to be assessed and verified. The sensitivity,
specificity and positive and negative predictive values also need to be determined. The difficulty in doing so is
that there is no gold standard diagnostic tool for intestinal
rejection and that it is unethical to observe skin rejection
and withhold treatment to see whether the intestine will
subsequently reject. Furthermore, treatment of the skin
rejection naturally prevents intestinal rejection from occurring so comparing the skin with the gold standard diagnostic test is not possible. Instead, future studies will
have to rely on surrogates such as comparative numbers
of rejection episodes.
Gerlach et al. from Oxford also highlighted the utility of the
skin component of the AW-VCA in patients presenting with
intestinal dysfunction of indeterminate cause [15]. They found
that in a cohort of 28 patients (of which 13 had an AW-VCA),
11 patients that presented with intestinal dysfunction, but with
no associated skin changes, suffered infection related intestinal dysfunction. On initial presentation, this is a challenging
diagnosis to make, and in retrospect Oxford mistreated 7/11
patients as having acute rejection. In 5/11 patients that had no
AW-VCA, and 2/11 with AW-VCA, prednisolone was administered after biopsy of the intestine but before final results
were available. The problem of course being that to get microbiological or virological confirmation of infection sometimes takes days. However, these patients failed to respond to
Methylprednisolone and later investigations revealed the infectious cause. Given this experience, they subsequently felt
that in the absence of skin changes in any intestinal dysfunction, it should be approached cautiously with respect to increasing immunosuppression, perhaps delaying immunosuppressive treatment until the diagnosis was confirmed as either
infection or rejection. This approach was tested on the remaining four patients with intestinal dysfunction and no AW-VCA
changes, and subsequent positive infectious agent investigation results verified this approach.
Possible Protective Effect of Combined AW-VCA and ITx
or MVT/MMVT
It is documented that rates of ACR are lower in combination
transplants when compared to single organ transplants [39,
40]. The degree to which this occurs and the mechanisms
are still poorly defined. The same phenomenon may also hold
true for combined AW-VCA and ITx or MVT/MMVT.
Weissenbacher et al. present a 16.8% (3/18) ITx ACR rate
when combined with AW-VCA, compared to 35.7% for isolated ITx or MMVT. Although not reaching statistical significance, this trend highlights a possible protective effect of
combination VCA and SOT transplant. An AW-VCA rejection rate of 38.9% in combined AW-VCA and intestinal transplant seems reduced compared to reported hand and face VCA
skin ACR rates of 87.8% and 72.7%, respectively in the first
post-transplant year [34]. There is a need for robust long-term
outcomes reporting and immunological investigation to determine the extent of this effect and its mechanism.
Episodes of chronic rejection
To date, Oxford are the only unit to present a case of chronic
rejection (CR) of both AW-VCA and ITx, making the current
CR rate for AW-VCA 2%. The Oxford case presented as
tissue fibrosis, including vascular fibrosis, leading to obstruction and necrosis. Global estimates for CR for all types of
VCA is approximately 6% (13/205) and 15% for ITx [33,
41]. Limited published long-term patient follow-up, small patient numbers and a lack of standardized diagnosis and
reporting of CR in AW-VCA may be leading to an
underreporting of cases of CR.
Adverse Outcomes
An updated summary of all reported adverse outcomes in the
field of AW-VCA can be seen in Table 4. Taking into account
non-standardized reporting of complications and small patient
numbers, current complication rates do not appear to be greater than what would be expected for VCA or solid organ transplant (SOT) in isolation. Of particular relevance, there does
not appear to be an increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) or graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) for skin containing AW-VCAs when combined with
ITx or MMVT/MVT, compared with SOT outcomes in isolation [14•, 15].
Psychosocial and Quality of Life Impact of AW-VCA
There is a need to employ objective, standardized psychosocial and quality of life (QoL) measures across the field of
VCA. Numerous studies have now described measures for
the assessment and follow-up of face and hand
Curr Transpl Rep (2020) 7:279–290 287

transplantation, but to date, this has not been investigated for
AW-VCA [42, 43]. Ambrose et al. recently showed that QoL
improved after ITx including patients with AW-VCA, compared to their pre-transplant intestinal failure state [44]. They
employed standardized measures, including EQ-5D, SF36
and the ITx-QOL score at regular time intervals. The effect
of the addition of a visible transplant to a normally invisible
intestinal transplant has yet to be reported.
Conclusions
AW-VCA fulfills the need to expand the abdominal domain and obtain primary closure after intestinal transplantation, seemingly without increasing the risk to the intestinal transplant or patient. There is some evidence that
there may also be additional benefits from AW-VCA in
providing additional information regarding immune status
for monitoring and diagnosis when intestinal dysfunction
occurs, and in perhaps reducing the number of intestinal
rejection events by virtue of the combination transplant
effect and improved monitoring and earlier treatment. In
the future, better data is needed to report on long-term
outcomes and verify or refute some of the observations
made. There is a need to better define the underlying
immunology of the AW-VCA skin component, the effect
of multi-component transplantation, ascertain the psychosocial and quality of life impact of AW-VCA on recipients. Given the small numbers of patients, all of these
areas will require close collaboration between transplant
units.
