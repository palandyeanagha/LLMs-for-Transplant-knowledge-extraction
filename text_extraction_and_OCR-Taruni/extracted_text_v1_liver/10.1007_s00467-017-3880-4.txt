Abstract
Combined and sequential liver–kidney transplantation (CLKT and SLKT) is a definitive treatment in children with end-stage
organ failure. There are two major indications: - terminal insufficiency of both organs, or - need for transplanting new liver as a
source of lacking enzyme or specific regulator of the immune system in a patient with renal failure. A third (uncommon) option is
secondary end-stage renal failure in liver transplant recipients. These three clinical settings use distinct qualification algorithms.
The most common indications include primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
(ARPKD), followed by liver diseases associated with occasional kidney failure. Availability of anti-C5a antibody (eculizumab)
has limited the validity of CLKT in genetic atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The liver coming from the same donor
as renal graft (in CLKT) is immunologically protective for the kidney and this provides long-term rejection-free follow-up. No
such protection is observed in SLKT, when both organs come from different donors, except uncommon cases of living donation
of both organs. Overall long-term outcome in CLKT in terms of graft survival is good and not different from isolated liver or
kidney transplantation, however patient survival is inferior due to complexity of this procedure.

Introduction
Combined liver–kidney transplantation (CLKT) is a procedure in which liver (whole or partial) and kidney allografts,
coming from the same (deceased in most cases) donor, are
transplanted to the pediatric recipient during a single surgical
procedure. Sequential liver–kidney transplantation (SLKT) is
divided into two distinct stages: isolated transplantation of the
liver (or kidney) and (after a certain time interval) – transplantation of the kidney (or liver) allograft, coming from different
(deceased) or the same living-related donors. This review describes aspects of surgical and post-transplant management,
immunosuppression-related issues, several specific indications for CLKT and SLKT, as well as the outcomes of both
procedures.
Surgical aspects and immediate
post-operative care
Combined liver and kidney transplantation (CLKT) is a very
uncommon procedure (e.g., the overall number of annual
number of transplantations worldwide in children with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) usually
does not exceed 30 cases), therefore should be performed by
experienced surgical and multidisciplinary teams, as its complexity may be the reason of early failure with fatal consequences, especially in young children of low body weight
[1]. CLKT is almost exclusively performed with organs from
deceased donors. Although technically possible, procurement
of part of the liver and a kidney from the same living donor is
considered a risky procedure. It is more feasible when performed sequentially, usually the liver first and then the kidney
[2]. In case of CLKT of organs procured from a deceased
donor, the difference of body mass between donor and recipient should not exceed 50%. In children with portal hypertension and hypersplenism, removal of the large spleen may be
necessary to make place for a relatively large liver graft.
CKLT should not be accompanied by native nephrectomy in
patients with ARPKD, as the extension of surgery increases
the overall risk of procedural complications. Transplantation
of the whole liver without its reduction avoids prolonged cold
ischemia time for both liver and kidney, and reduces the risk of
postoperative complications related to partial graft transplantation (like bleeding or bile leak). Keeping cold ischemia time
as short as possible is crucial for immediate post-transplant
function, thus reperfusion of both grafts should be done as
early as possible. Cold ischemia time of the liver should not
exceed 8–10 h and of the kidney graft should not be longer
than 10–12 h. This is available with good center-driven logistics. The liver graft is transplanted first and after vascular
anastomoses the liver is reperfused. Immediately after liver
reperfusion, the kidney graft is implanted, anastomoses of
the renal vein and artery in the Bend to back^ fashion to external or common iliac vessels are done, and the graft is reperfused. Single doses of mannitol (0.5 g/kg) and furosemide (3–
5 mg/kg) are given at this moment to force the diuresis. The
biliary and then ureterovesical anastomoses are done after
reperfusion of both grafts and wounds are closed with the
drains left around the transplanted organs.
In anuric patients, e.g., in children with ARPKD after bilateral native nephrectomy performed early in life [3], CLKT
is more difficult in terms of intra-surgery fluid challenge. This
is an indication to introduce continuous hemodialysis/
hemodiafiltration (CVVHD/CVVHDF) in the operating theater and maintain this treatment during the whole surgery.
Extracorporeal treatment is performed via single superior vena
cava (SVC) double-lumen access or twin access with blood
circulating from a catheter placed in the inferior vena cava
(IVC) to a catheter introduced into the SVC. This helps to
maintain blood pressure without fluid overload, particularly
in the anhepatic phase, when the infrahepatic IVC is clamped.
In cases of inadequate hourly diuresis, CVVHDF should be
continued after transplantation, with no anticoagulation if possible. Citrate anticoagulation is safer compared to heparinbased anticoagulation in terms of the risk of bleeding, unless
liver graft insufficiency increases the risk of citrate intoxication [4].
In cases of CLKT performed in patients with hyperoxaluria
type 1 (PH1), the intensive hemodiafiltration should be continued after transplantation to remove the excess oxalate, intensively mobilized from the body deposits to plasma and
urine. This approach is mandatory in cases of delayed renal
graft function, however it might also be used in cases of immediate renal graft function in selected patients with severe
systemic oxalosis and high oxalate burden. The aim is to protect the transplanted kidney against rapid recurrence of
nephrocalcinosis. The optimal duration of post-transplant
hemodiafiltration is not defined, however it is reasonable to
monitor plasma oxalate concentration and maintain extracorporeal removal of oxalate until stable normalization below the
saturation level (< 30 μmol/l) is achieved with good renal
function [4–6].
During the whole CLKT surgery, particular attention
should be given to achieving good surgical hemostasis and
controlling coagulation. In patients with liver-related coagulopathy, the major disturbances should be corrected before
surgery with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, or
platelets, if necessary. The infusion of tranexamic acid may
be given to control fibrinolysis during surgery, particularly in
2228 Pediatr Nephrol (2018) 33:2227–2237

patients with a history of previous abdominal surgeries or
advanced portal hypertension with multiple intra-abdominal
varices and hypersplenism, as in these cases native hepatectomy is difficult and associated with marked blood loss. One the
other hand it is important not to overcorrect coagulation, as it
may lead to vascular thrombotic complications after reperfusion of both organs, thus administration of FFP, platelets,
cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen formulations, and other
procoagulants during surgery should be limited to the minimum necessary. Apart from routine laboratory tests, the best
intraoperative monitoring of coagulation during CLKT is provided by repeated thromboelastometry, which shows real clinical coagulation status and guides adequate treatment. In some
cases the infusion of catecholamines (dopamine and norepinephrine) should be given to maintain adequate blood pressure without fluid overload.
Doppler ultrasound examination should be done in the operating room before wounds are closed to ensure adequate
blood flow through vascular anastomoses. Early postoperation care requires staying in the pediatric intensive care
unit as mechanical ventilation may be necessary for 1–2 days.
Very close monitoring of the patient and both transplanted
organs is mandatory in the early postoperative period. Very
detailed fluid balance (both water-electrolyte and volume),
including all drained losses and hourly urine output should
be kept to promote perfusion of the grafts and maintain adequate diuresis from the transplanted kidney [4]. Central venous pressure (CVP) should be maintained within a range of
5–10 cm.
H2O by supplementation of 100% of abdominal
drainage volumes and hourly diuresis. Hematocrit is kept between 25 and 30% during the whole perioperative period and
coagulation should not be corrected unless there is clinically
symptomatic bleeding or the international normalized ratio
(INR) exceeds 3–3.5. Administration of blood-driven products (packed red blood cells, fresh-frozen plasma, platelets,
albumin) should be kept to a minimum and related to the
current needs of the recipient, measured losses, and results
of laboratory tests. Our center uses anticoagulants (fractionated or low molecular weight heparin) postoperatively for 7–
14 days as routine antithrombotic prophylaxis.
Patency of vascular anastomoses should be checked twice
daily with Doppler ultrasound during the first 7 days after
transplantation and then less frequently until discharge.
In most clinical situations of sequential procedure
(SLKT), the liver transplantation precedes kidney transplantation, with the exception of a few patients with renal
polycystic disease and liver fibrosis. The transplantation
surgery of each individual graft in SLKT is not different
from combined transplantation and is just performed as
two separate procedures. In SLKT, most often one of the
organs may be procured from a living donor and another
one from a deceased donor, however using the same livingrelated donor has also been reported [2].
Immunoprotection and immunosuppression
Immunoprotection
There are data suggesting a protective effect of the liver to the
kidney when procured from the same donor and transplanted
during one surgical procedure (CLKT), which translates to a
low rate of acute rejection compared to isolated kidney or liver
transplantation, and results in improved renal allograft survival [7, 8]. There are various suggested mechanisms behind
observed clinical immunoprotection, related to ability of the
liver to modify the recipient immune system. Circulating alloantibodies may be neutralized by soluble class I HLA antigens produced by the transplanted liver. The liver graft delivers soluble HLA-G antigen, exerting an inhibitory effect
on natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells. Kupfer cells of
the liver graft are able to clear circulating anti-HLA antibodies. They may also be bound to the HLA glycoproteins presented on hepatic endothelial cells [9–11].
It should be noted that a study analyzing 2484 adult recipients of CLKT showed that patient (P = 0.002) and overall
kidney graft survival (P = 0.015) were significantly diminished among sensitized patients. Differences in patient survival translated to an estimated half-life of 10.3 years among
nonsensitized recipients, versus 7.8 years among sensitized
recipients. Therefore, presensitization may need to be considered in a risk stratification of CLKT [12]. The recent report
from the ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry on outcomes of CLKT
vs. isolated kidney transplantation in children with autosomal
recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) does not show
a protective effect of liver transplantation on renal graft survival [1]. Among our patients with ARPKD who received
CLKT, including three cases who had lost previously
transplanted kidneys due to chronic rejection, there was no
episode of acute rejection in renal grafts (n = 15) and a single,
mild episode of rejection in a liver graft at 5-year follow-up.
However, none of those three retransplanted patients (with
kidney in CLKT) could be classified as highly sensitized [13].
The protective effect has not been observed in sequential
liver and kidney transplantation (SLKT), however some studies have indicated the importance of HLA matching of the
second graft with the previous one (kidney after liver) for
improved outcome. The better the HLA match between liver
and kidney, the lower the further incidence of acute rejection
of the renal graft [8, 14]. The protective effect of liver to
kidney, coming from the same living-related donor and
transplanted sequentially (SLKT; kidney after liver) to a pediatric recipient against positive cross-match and presence of
donor-specific antibodies, has also been reported [15]. This
effect of a good match on long-term outcomes has confirmed
in a specific study, in which the same living-related donors
were used for primary liver and then secondary kidney transplantation (SLKT; n = 13), with 100% (death-censored) 10-

year graft survival [2]. Overall, it seems that clinically significant protective effect of liver to kidney in CLKT has some
limitations and is mainly seen in nonsensitized patients, while
in SLKT, is present only in cases where both organs were
sequentially procured from the same living-related donor,
which is a rare situation.
Immunosuppression
There are no universal recommendations with regard to the
choice of optimal immunosuppression in CKLT and SLKT
patients, and the decision is based on the experience of a
particular center. There are a variety of protocols reported,
including one calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine; CsA or tacrolimus; TAC); one antiproliferative agent (azathioprine;
AZA or mycophenolate mofetil; MMF); mTOR inhibitor
(sirolimus; SIR) and steroids (prednisolone; Pred) in different
combinations: - triple therapy (CsA/TAC+ MMF/AZA +
Pred); − double therapy (TAC + Pred; SIR + Pred) or steroidfree regimens (TAC+ MMF; TAC monotherapy). Use of induction was also variable and both blocking (anti-IL2R ab;
basiliximab or daclizumab) and administration of depleting
(polyclonal or monoclonal) antibodies (thymoglobuline/
alemtuzumab) have been reported [13, 16–21].
Indications
There are three major groups of indications for liver–kidney
transplantation. The first group includes cases where there is
not irreversible liver failure, but specific isolated functional
(metabolic or immunological) defect of the native liver is an
underlying mechanism of systemic disease and renal failure is
one of the clinical manifestations. The native liver with a
single specific defect otherwise maintains other functions,
therefore the liver allograft is transplanted exclusively as the
source of the lacking enzyme. The second group includes endstage liver failure of various underlying causes, including
ciliopathies (such as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney
disease with liver fibrosis), accompanied by concomitant renal
failure. CLKT or SLKT may be performed in both settings,
however the selection of modality depends on current individual status of both organs, general condition of the recipient,
and center experience. The third group includes secondary
chronic renal failure in recipients of non-renal solid organ
transplant in whom sequential kidney (after liver) transplantation is necessary (usually) several years thereafter.
Based on data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients, the most common liver-related indication for
CLKT was primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1; 37%), followed by congenital liver fibrosis (accompanied by renal failure)
(18%), other non-PH1 metabolic diseases (7%), and polycystic liver disease (5%), as well as various other liver-related
disorders (each about 1%). The most common primary renal
disease in patients undergoing CLKT was primary
hyperoxaluria (oxalate nephropathy) (36%), followed by
polycystic kidney disease (25%) [22]. Indications for liver–
kidney transplantation are summarized in Table 1.

alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase—leads to systemic accumulation of oxalate deposits in many tissues, except the liver,
where the enzyme is localized. Oxalate forms crystals with
calcium in the urine, with further formation of stones, development of nephrocalcinosis and finally, renal failure. The lower the renal function, the more generalized is the disease, and
the deposition of oxalates accelerates when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines below 40–50 ml/min/1.73 m2
. The
most rapid progress to renal failure is seen in young children
with infantile PH1. The OxaEurope expert group (Cochat
et al.) recommends planning pre-emptive organ transplantation at chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b to avoid the
complications of systemic oxalosis.
Experts do not recommend either isolated renal transplantation (unless there is no other option) or isolated liver
transplantation [unless in selected patients (GFR 30–59 ml/
min/1.73 m2
)] [23]. The latter option (pre-emptive isolated
liver transplantation) was reported as very successful by
Perera et al., however the pre-transplant GFR in children
who received liver grafts was over 80 ml/min/1.73 m2
. In
any case, all transplanted patients maintained renal function
for many years. Another report included three cases with
median GFR of 40 (30–46) ml/min/1.73 m2 who received
pre-emptive liver transplant successfully as well [24, 25].
The OxaEurope expert group recommends CLKT or SLKT
in patients with PH1, according to patient’s condition and
local facilities. Patients with GFR between 15 and 29 (CKD
stage 4) may be considered as candidates for SLKT (optionally), and patients with lower GFR (< 15 ml/min/1.73 m2
;
CKD stage 5), as well as small children with infantile PH1,
should receive CLKT [23].
Recent advances in developing RNA interference (RNAi)-
based therapeutics, targeting glycolate oxidase and hydroxyproline dehydrogenase, aimed at treating liver-related diseases
(including oxalosis), may change the policy of final treatment
of PH1. The new drugs (undergoing phase III trials) are able to
modify oxalate turnover to the extent that they probably will
replace other therapies and limit the indications for performing
CLKT/SLKT in the future [26].
There are reports on failure of isolated kidney transplantation in hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2), associated with genetic
mutations resulting in decreased activity of glyoxylate
reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR). Despite the
generally milder clinical course (compared to PH1) and fact
that expression of this enzyme is not limited to the liver, cases
(both pediatric and adult) of renal allograft failure due to recurrence of oxaluria and presence of oxalate deposits in
transplanted kidneys have been described [27, 28]. In one of
these (an adult case), a further CLKT was performed with
further normalization of plasma oxalate within 2 weeks after
transplantation. The clinical course of these cases raises the
question of qualification policy to isolated kidney vs. combined liver–kidney transplantation in PH2.
Ciliopathies
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD)
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is
one of the ciliopathies and is caused by mutations of the
PKHD1 gene, encoding fibrocystin. There have been more
than 300 mutations described and these may cause variable
phenotypes, as there is no strict genotype–phenotype correlation. The underlying pathology of renal failure is related to the
presence of multiple medullary and corticomedullary cysts in
enlarged kidneys. Portal fibrosis and hypertension, dilatation
of biliary ducts, cholangitis, and malformations of ductal
plates are common hepatic pathologies. From a clinical point
of view, ARPKD can be divided into four subgroups. The first
group (perinatal) presents in early infancy with severe renal
disease, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hypoplasia.
The second group (neonatal) presents predominantly progressive renal failure and Caroli syndrome in the liver, whereas the
two remaining groups—infantile and juvenile—present
milder renal disease and more severe hepatic complications,
mostly expressed as hepatic fibrosis [29, 30]. Many cases
(about 70–90%) may be finally treated with isolated kidney
or liver transplantation; therefore the incidence of combined/
sequential transplantation in patients with ARPKD is about
10–30%. In cases of failure of both organs (developing sequentially or present in parallel)—the therapeutic options include SLKT in younger children (kidney first, then liver),
whereas CLKT or SLKT (liver first, then kidney) are performed mainly in older patients (infantile and juvenile variants
of ARPKD) [31–33]. There have been specific concerns reported in ARPKD patients treated with organ transplantation:
one was the increased risk of ascending cholangitis in native
liver after isolated renal transplantation, especially in cases
with a phenotype of Caroli disease (up to 10 times higher
compared to cases with hepatic fibrosis), developing as the
consequence of bacterial infection, exacerbated by immunosuppression given after renal transplantation; the second issue
is increased sepsis-related mortality [34–36]. Therefore, qualification for CLKT/SLKT in ARPKD should be decided carefully, on an individual basis, based on multidisciplinary discussion and dependant upon center experience. The presence
of irreversible renal and liver failure with relevant complications (despite specific treatment), together with PELD score (>
10) has been suggested as the algorithm for management of
children with ARPKD in terms of CLKT [37]. However, most
ARPKD patients present preserved synthetic liver function,
therefore the PELD scoring system may not reflect the optimal
criterion for CLKT, so other factors, including therapyresistant portal hypertension, ascending cholangitis or pruritus
should also be considered [1]. An experienced group reported
three (out of eight in the series) patients with ARPKD, who
received pre-emptive CLKT at CKD stage 4 (eGFR about
Pediatr Nephrol (2018) 33:2227–2237 2231

20 ml/min/1.73 m2
) with successful outcome, showing that
the rule of qualification may be individual. Moreover, successful CLKT was associated with significant improvement
of life quality and improvement of growth velocity in this
series [21]. The availability of body size-matched deceased
donors of kidney and liver is one of the important issues,
especially in small recipients, even though large kidneys and
native liver will be removed before and during final
transplantation.
Nephronophthisis associated with liver fibrosis (Boichis
syndrome)
Up to 5% of patients with nephronophthisis present hepatic
fibrosis and this clinical pattern is known as Boichis syndrome. The relevant genetic background (mutation of the
TMEM67 gene) has been identified [38, 39]. The French multicenter group reported three cases of this syndrome (among
overall 18 in the series of transplanted patients) who received
CKLT [40]. Sequential transplantation (SLKT) was also reported in a patient with Boichis syndrome, interestingly with
both organs coming from the same living-related donor. The
liver transplantation was complicated with rapid progression
of chronic renal failure and 4 months later the kidney was
transplanted. Both grafts were functioning at 1.5-year
follow-up [15].
Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)
Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is heterogenous inborn error
of metabolism most typically caused by mutations in the
vitamin-B12-dependent enzyme methylmalonyl- CoA – mutase (MUT). The defect of this enzyme leads to multiorgan
failure and disability caused by chronic intoxication with
methylmalonic acid and creating megamitochondria in affected organs [41]. As the overall survival of the patients has
improved, renal failure is currently more frequently reported
as a long-term complication [42]. Organ transplantation is,
however, a therapeutic, not a curative option, as some systemic dysfunctions (such as neurologic or muscle impairment)
may persist despite normal graft function. It is crucial to maintain the specific high-calorie diet for life, which is low in
propiogenic amino acid precursors, as well as regular metabolic monitoring, despite transplantation, because of ongoing
extrahepatorenal production of methylmalonic acid derived
from skeletal muscles [42]. Some reported patients received
isolated liver transplants, some isolated renal transplant, and
the others underwent CLKT [43–46]. Pre-emptive isolated
renal transplantation was also suggested as a form of Bcell
therapy^, however overall experience with this form of therapy was poor, with more complications than benefit for the
patients [42]. There are reports on isolated liver and CLKT
in children with MMA. Several patients undergoing CLKT
were nephrectomized. Parenteral nutrition containing amino
acids is an important part of post-operative management [43,
45]. Optimal transplant modality in patients with MMA is still
not clear. The risks and complexity of CLKT (especially in
young recipients) must be balanced with prolonged exposure
to complications of the native disease if the qualification to
transplantation is postponed [43].
α1-antitrypsin deficiency (α-AT)
α1-antitrypsin deficiency (α1-AT) is a genetic disease caused
by mutations in the gene SERPINA1 and in cases of homozygous mutation children develop end-stage liver failure requiring liver transplantation [46]. Membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is one of the associated co-morbidities, which rarely may progress to renal failure [47]. The
precise mechanism of this association in not fully clarified,
although it has been suggested that abnormal protein released
from injured hepatocytes may act as an antigen, which triggers
an immunological response and leads to deposition of
antitrypsin-containing deposits in glomeruli [48]. Isolated liver transplantation may cause disappearance of MPGN in native kidneys and this should be considered in qualification to
isolated liver transplantation or CLKT [49]. Successful CLKT
was reported in a case of end-stage renal failure in the course
of MPGN in a patient with liver failure due to α-AT deficiency
[48].
Type 1a glycogen storage disease (von Gierke
disease)
Type 1a glycogen storage disease (GSD1) is an autosomal
recessive disorder with deficiency of glucose-6 phosphatase
and related multiorgan accumulation of glycogen resulting in
multiple dysfunctions, including hepatomegaly and liver failure, development of hepatocellular adenomas, and renal failure in the course of secondary glomerulosclerosis. Two successful case reports of CKLT in GSD1 have been published
[50, 51].
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)
Combined liver–kidney transplantation was used as a therapeutic option in patients with genetic aHUS at high risk of
recurrence before the availability of anti-C5 monoclonal antibody (eculizumab), and the relevant recommendations
concerning eligibility of patients for CLKT or isolated liver
transplantation have been released by the consensus group.
Successful CLKT may be curative in aHUS, however this
procedure is not free from significant complications and
peri-transplant overall mortality rate is about 15% [52–54].
Currently, with increasing experience in the efficacy of longterm administration of eculizumab, which prevents the
2232 Pediatr Nephrol (2018) 33:2227–2237

recurrence of aHUS after isolated renal transplantation, CLKT
was abandoned as first-line treatment option in most relevant
cases [55, 56]. The availability of these expensive drugs is
increasing and in many countries the drug company-driven
program of repeated i.v. administration at home is helpful in
cases of necessary long-term prophylaxis. In rare cases of
suboptimal response to eculizumab, sequential liver after kidney transplantation may be a curative option, as recently reported by an Italian group [57]. The definitive recommendation on considering (or not) CLKT as a curative option in
genetic aHUS is not yet available and longer follow-up of
eculizumab-driven cases with isolated renal transplantation
should bring more evidence, which will make this decision
more reasonable.
Renal failure after liver transplantation
There are two distinct subgroups of patients who develop
renal failure after liver transplantation. One includes patients
who received liver transplant having developed CKD at stage
4/5 or developing chronic post-acute renal failure in the course
of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The second group includes
patients with normal renal function at the moment of liver
transplantation, but who develop chronic kidney injury several years thereafter, mainly due to nephrotoxicity of calcineurin
inhibitors (CNI). There are no specific pediatric recommendations regarding this, however there is ongoing discussion on
optimal therapy in the first setting, conducted among transplant physicians and surgeons treating adult patients. The consensus guidelines divide (adult) candidates for CLKT into two
renal categories: (1) persistent acute kidney injury (AKI)
≥4 weeks, or eGFR ≤35 ml/min (by MDRD-6 formula) or
eGFR ≤25 ml/min (by iothalamate clearance), and (2) CKD
for 3 months before qualification, defined as eGFR ≤40 ml/
min (by MDRD-6 formula) or eGFR ≤30 ml/min (by
iothalamate clearance) or proteinuria ≥2 g/day or chronic pathology in renal biopsy (> 30% global glomerulosclerosis or >
30% interstitial fibrosis) or metabolic disease involving kidneys [58]. These criteria reflect experience showing better
outcomes in CLKT vs. isolated liver transplantation in adult
cirrhotic patients with pre-existing renal failure [59]. More
recent data are more careful in terms of qualification rules,
and show that the real benefit in patient survival after CLKT
is limited to those cases who required dialysis before transplantation [60]. In children with liver failure and after liver
transplantation, the modified Schwartz formula may overestimate renal function, therefore cystatin C-based calculation of
eGFR is indicated for more accuracy [61, 62]. Children with
end-stage renal disease developing as a consequence of
hepatorenal syndrome will be apparent candidates for SLKT.
The other subgroup of indications includes patients with liver
failure, who develop CKD, then end-stage renal disease after
many years after liver transplantation and require renal transplantation (SLKT). The incidence of GFR decrease < 90 ml/
min/1.73 m2 at 5–10 years after liver transplantation is about
30% [62], however the development of end-stage renal disease is reported as below 10% in children after long-term
follow-up [63]. There are preventive measures undertaken to
avoid renal transplantation for this reason. The first includes
careful detailed surveillance of renal function and blood pressure in pediatric liver transplant recipients [64] and the second
is aimed to minimize exposure to CNI [61]. There have been
several randomized controlled trials aimed at reducing the risk
of CKD in adult liver transplant recipients, based on conversion from CNI to mTOR inhibitors. A recent meta-analysis
showed that patients who converted to mTORi had significantly better renal function at 1 year after randomization compared with patients remaining on CNI (mean difference,
7.48 ml/min/1.73 m2
). However, conversion to mTORi was
associated with a higher risk of acute rejection (RR, 1.76) and
study discontinuation due to adverse events (RR, 2.17) up to
1 year after randomization [65]. A similar approach was reported recently in children, where treatment with everolimus
and low-dose CNI revealed over-immunosuppression associated with use of this particular protocol and recruitment was
stopped prematurely due to high rates of PTLD, treatmentrelated serious infections leading to hospitalization and premature study drug discontinuation, despite significant benefits
in terms of improvement of GFR [66]. Clinical factors used
for qualification of patients CLKT/SLKT are presented in
Table 2.
Outcomes
There are variable data on long-term outcomes of CLKT, depending on the series of patients and specific indications
(when compared to outcomes of isolated organ transplantation). The major difference is also related to the primary parameter of outcome: - incidence of acute rejection, or - patient
and graft survival. Overall, the incidence of acute rejection in
CKLT is lower compared to isolated liver or kidney transplantation (reports from UNOS and CTS databases) [7, 14], which
supports the idea of an immunoprotective effect of the
transplanted liver to the kidney coming from the same donor.
The ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry data on outcomes of CLKT
in children with ARPKD shows that 5-year patient survival
after kidney transplantation is 97.4%, in contrast to 87.0%
after combined liver–kidney transplantation. The age- and
sex-adjusted risk for death after combined liver–kidney transplantation was 6.7-fold greater than after kidney transplantation (P = 0.005) [1]. These data also show that 5-year deathcensored kidney transplant survival following combined liver–kidney and kidney transplantation was similar (92.1 vs.
85.9%; P = 0.4), which is in contrast to the opinion of a
Pediatr Nephrol (2018) 33:2227–2237 2233

protective effect of the liver on the renal graft. Overall, the
early post-transplant period in CLKT is associated with high
risk for patients (mainly small children), while long-term graft
survival is not inferior compared to isolated transplantations.
Data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
(SRTR), including 152 primary cases of CLKT (1987–
2011), shows that patient survival was 86.8, 82.1, and
78.9%, liver graft survival was 81.9, 76.5, and 72.6% and
renal graft survival 83.4, 76.5, and 66.8% at 1, 2, and 10 years,
respectively. Similar survival rates for isolated liver transplantations were 86.7, 81.2, and 77.4%, and for isolated kidney
transplantations 98.2, 95.4, and 90%, respectively. In patients
undergoing CLKT, PH1 as the underlying disease (the most
common indication; 37% of all CLKT cases) was associated
with reduced patient, liver, and kidney graft survival (p = 0.01;
p = 0.01; p = 0.01; respectively). The study also showed that
during one decade, graft outcome after CLKT significantly
improved (p = 0.04 for liver and p = 0.02 for kidney transplantation), however this did not translate into better patient survival (p = 0.2). The study demonstrated the center effect on
overall patient survival, with inferior outcomes in children
receiving CLKT in centers with minor experience (defined
as 1–2 CLKTs performed) [22]. Overall, 100% 1- and 5-year
(death-censored) liver and kidney graft survival, and 94% 5-
year patient survival in children with ARPKD treated with
CLKT was reported by our center, which is an active national
pediatric transplant center [13]. The UNOS registry data on
patient and graft survival in children with SLKT (liver transplant recipients subsequently receiving renal graft) showed
that overall patient survival was inferior (90% at 5 years and
82% at 10 years; p = 0.002), however (death-censored) graft
survival was similar compared to isolated kidney recipients
(82% at 5 years and 67% at 10 years; p = 0.65) [67]. These
data suggest the overall high risk of multiorgan transplantation, also in the setting of sequential procedures, compared to
isolated transplantation.
Key summary points
• Indications for combined or sequential liver–kidney transplantation (CLKT/SLKT) include parallel or sequential failure
of both organs, the need to replace the liver as the source of a
specific missing enzyme in a patient with renal failure, and the
need for renal transplantation in the recipient of liver graft due
to renal failure.
• The selection of optimal approach (CLKT vs. SLKT) is
individual depending on specific clinical indications, current
status of both organs, general condition of the recipient, and
experience of the center.
• In CLKT, the liver exerts a protective immunological
effect upon the kidney, which translates to low acute rejection

rates and good long-term graft survival, however this effect
seems to be limited to non-sensitized patients.
• In SLKT, there is no protective effect, as in most cases
liver and kidney come from different donors, however the
HLA matching between sequential organs (liver and kidney)
is important for future outcome.
• Overall outcome of CLKT/SLKT is good in terms of
long-term graft survival, however it is not superior to an isolated liver or kidney transplantation setting in terms of patient
survival, which is related to the complexity of transplantation
procedures, especially in young children and the high risk
during the early perioperative period.
