Abstract
Backgrounds Liver transplantation is considered as one of
therapeutic approaches to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of various
therapeutic options for HCC.
Materials and methods One hundred twenty patients with
known HCC in various tumour stages were evaluated in the
present study. Patients were treated either with primary
tumour resection, transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE)
or liver transplantation (LTx) by an interdisciplinary team.
Results The overall 1-year and 5-year survivals of patients
in LTx group were 95 and 57%, respectively, which were
significantly higher than those in primary tumour resection
group (65 and 33%, P<0.01) and those in TACE group (44
and 4%, P<0.01). In parallel, 1-year and 5-year tumourfree survivals of patients in LTx group (75 and 62%) were
significantly higher than those in primary tumour resection
group (50 and 11%, P<0.01). There were no significant
differences in 1- and 5-year survivals of patients with early
tumour stage received LTx or primary tumour resection,
whereas patients in advanced tumour stage based on
pathological findings of explanted liver significantly
benefited from LTx as compared to primary resection.
Conclusions LTx can be a curative approach for patients
with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis.
However, organ shortage is a major limiting factor in the
selection of HCC patients for LTx.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents 5% of all
cancers worldwide with increasing incidence and striking
differences in geographic distribution. It occurs mostly in
patients with cirrhosis after high alcohol intake and/or
viral hepatitis. Therapeutic approaches, either curative or
palliative, include interventional and surgical therapies, like
transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), percutaneous
alcohol instillation, thermoablation, primary resection and
transplantation. A number of studies on the effects of TACE
failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect in patient survival
in comparison to conservative treatment, but it may be a
therapeutic option for unresectable tumour. The role of
TACE as bridging treatment for HCC before liver transplantation is still controversial. Evidence-based analysis did
not show a beneficial effect of TACE as bridging therapy
before liver transplantation (LTx) for HCC patients.
However, the long-term effects of TACE on the tumourfree survival, particularly for the patients with advanced

tumour stage, need to be further evaluated [1, 2]. Primary
tumour resection for HCC is limited by the size, number,
location and vascular invasion of tumours. Extent of
cirrhosis is also an important limiting factor for primary
tumour resection that is due to the maintaining malignant
potency after resection and the requirement for sufficient
function in the remaining liver tissue [3–5]. Furthermore,
small nodules may be overseen by radiologic and sonographic means in their potency of discriminating cirrhotic
nodule from tumour. Frequently, tumour nodules are
detected incidentally only in explanted livers after transplantation. In these cases, LTx remains one of the most
attractive approaches for patients with HCC and cirrhosis.
In a selected patient group following the Milan Criteria
(UICC I and II), 5-year survival rate can reach more than
70% [3, 5–7]. On the other hand, it was shown that the
UICC tumour classification system does not have prognostic power for the long-term outcome after LTx [8]. The
intention of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic
options for patients with advanced HCC in regards to the
best therapy that is reflected by overall and tumour-free
survival.
Materials and methods
Patients and tumour classification
During 1995 to 2000, 113 patients with HCC and seven
patients with incidentaloma of HCC that were found after
LTx were consecutively treated at the University of
Göttingen Medical Centre and followed up for at least
5 years. The tumour staging was initially based on the
radiological findings [computed tomography (CT) and/or
magnetic resonance imaging], histological diagnosis and the
pathological findings of the resected tumours or explanted
livers. The diagnosed tumours were stratified into HCC in
cirrhotic and HCC in non-cirrhotic livers. The cirrhotic
livers were classified with the Child–Pugh–Turcotte score.
Tumour stages were classified according to UICC (Union
International Centre Cancer) and Milan Criteria [6] to
evaluate prognostic estimation. Tumour recurrence was
defined with the Barcelona Criteria as radiological findings
of a focal lesion >2 cm with arterial hypervascularisation and
an increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level >400 ng/ml [4].
Therapeutic strategies
Patients were treated by a multidiscipline team based on their
tumour stage, location and liver function with either primary
resection of the tumour, TACE, LTx or LTx after bridging
TACE therapy. Patients eligible for LTx were evaluated
according to the German Transplantation Regulation.
TACE was performed in patients with unresectable
tumours due to functional or anatomic reasons. The femoral
artery was used as access vessel, and the embolisation
catheter was introduced retrograde through the abdominal
aorta and celiac trunk. Under suspicion of multilocular
tumour growth, the whole liver was embolised even when
the tumour was present in only one lobe. The liver was
embolised either at a single time or alternatively one lobe
first and the second lobe 2 weeks thereafter. The injected
substance was a combination of 50 ml Lipidol for a whole
liver embolisation and Doxorubicin (50 mg for the whole
liver and 25 mg in patients with impaired liver function or
portal vein thrombosis). The procedure was repeated every
6 weeks. After every two cycles, the tumour status was
reevaluated by imagings.
Primary tumour resections were a primary option for
patients with known HCC. They were performed by two
experienced surgeons. Median laparotomy with right lateral
extension was performed. Sonography of the tumor liver
was performed to evaluate relation of tumour to vessels and
its resectability. The tumour was then resected under
Pringle maneuver with or without temporary occlusion of
the suprahepatic and infrahepatic caval veins. Dissection
was either performed with a Metzenbaum scissor or a
water-jet device. After resection of the primary tumours,
regional lymph nodes and/or the lymph nodes at the celiac
trunk were resected.
HCC Patients with cirrhosis and poor liver function were
considered to treat with LTx. All patients received downstaging protocol with TACE. Patients within Milan’s
criteria were chosen to treat with LTx. LTx was performed
by the same two experienced surgeons. The transplant was
either performed as a whole-organ orthotopic liver transplantation with resection of the retrohepatic caval vein or as
split liver (right lobe allograft) with remaining recipient
caval vein. Immunosuppressive therapy after LTx consisted
of a tacrolimus-based drug regimen including corticosteroids. The corticosteroids were tapered within 3 months
after transplantation. No adjuvant anti-cancer treatment was
applied after surgery. During the first month after discharge,
all patients were followed up weekly in the outpatient
clinic. AFP assessments and abdominal ultrasound were
carried out for tumour recurrence screening. Chest X-ray
and abdominal CT scan were performed yearly. In case of
HCC recurrence, bone scintigraphy and magnet resonance
imaging was performed additionally.
Histopathologic analysis
The characteristics of HCC in resected livers and explanted
liver including size, number of the tumour nodes and the
micro- or macrovascular invasion of the tumour was
evaluated by two pathologists. Additional information on

the influence of the tumour on the clinical course was
gained from tumour-positive regional lymph nodes and the
resection status. Patients were then stratified into the UICC
staging system.
Statistics
Data were collected retrospectively from patient charts.
Descriptive statistical analysis was performed with SigmaStat Version 3.1 (Systat Software, Richmond, CA, USA).
The cumulative survival of patients was analysed with
Kaplan–Meier curves and with COX regression method as
indicated. Significance was defined as P<0.05.
Results
Demographics and tumour staging
One hundred twenty patients (96 men and 24 women) were
included. The average age was 59±11 years (range, 25 to
82 years). Stratified to therapeutic options the average age
in patients without treatment for HCC was 63±13 years
(range, 43 to 82 years), in the TACE-group 59±10 years
(range, 35 to 79), the OLT group 52±11 years (range, 27 to
65 years) and the resection group 61±11 years (range, 25 to
76), revealing significant differences between the groups
(P=0.002). Among the patients with HCC, 74 of them
(61.6%) were accompanied with cirrhosis that was classified with the Child–Pugh–Turcotte score (Table 1). Twentyeight patients (26 men and 2 women) were in stage A, 29
patients (25 men and 4 women) were in stage B, and 17
patients (15 men and 2 women) were in stage C. According
to UICC classification, six patients were in UICC stage I
(including five with cirrhosis and one without cirrhosis),
22 patients were in UICC stage II (including 13 with
cirrhosis and nine without cirrhosis), 23 patients were in
UICC stage III (including 14 with cirrhosis and nine
without cirrhosis), and 69 patients were in UICC stage
IV (including 45 with cirrhosis and 24 without cirrhosis). The stratification of patients according to UICC
classifications and therapeutic options were shown in
Table 2.
Therapeutic options
Ten of 120 HCC patients received only supportive therapies
due to extrahepatic metastases (in three patients), protracted
age and high cardiopulmonary risk (in two patients)
including decease before treatment (in four patients), and
refusal of treatment (in one patient). From the remaining
110 HCC patients, 47 of them had unresectable HCC, who
received TACE. Thirty-six of them were primarily resected,
20 patients underwent TACE followed by LTx, and seven
incidentalomas were transplanted and diagnosed as HCC
thereafter (Tables 2 and 3).
The extension of liver resections consisted of single
segment resections (n=2), bisegemental resections (n=5),
left hemihepatectomies (n=15), right hemihepatectomies
(n=5), and extended right hemihepatectomies (n=15). No
tumour cells were identified in the margin of all resected
livers in final pathohistology.
Overall survival
All patients were followed up for at least 5 years. Median
of follow-up in the non-treatment group was 72 days
(range, 6 to 238 days), 200 days in TACE group (range,
16 to 2054 days), 774 days in the LTX group (range, 67 to
2,223 days), and 399 days in the resection group (range, 11
to 2,220 days). The cumulative overall survival for all
patients with HCC in our centre after 1 and 5 years was
100% in UICC stage I, 86 and 64% in UICC stage II, 72

and 45% in UICC stage III, and 42 and 8% in UICC stage
IVA patients (P<0.05).
Stratified into the different treatment regimens after
diagnosis of HCC was confirmed in final pathohistology
that included all UICC stages. The survival after 1 and
5 years in patients that underwent LTx was 95 and 57%,
respectively. The 1- and 5-year survival of patients with
primary resection was 65 and 33%. In a group of patients
treated with TACE, only 44% were alive after 1 year and
4% after 5 years. The difference between groups was highly
significant (P<0.01). This is reflected by the median
survival times (3.8 months in the non-treated patient,
9.0 months in the TACE group, 22.8 months in the
resection, and 101.6 months in the LTx group). From 27
transplanted patients, ten showed vascular macroinvasion in
post-transplant pathology, which led to a significant
decrease in survival after 1 and 5 years in those patients
(P=0.012; Fig. 1).
Tumour stage-based survival
One- and 5-year patient’s survival rates in UICC stage I and
II were 100 and 87% in the transplant group, 100 and
80% in the resection, and 72 and 27% in the TACE group
(p=0.00003, Tables 4 and 5). In UICC stage III, 100 and
68% of the transplant patients, 63 and 25% of the resection
group, and 62 and 0% in the TACE group were alive (p=
0.0006). One- and 5-year survival for UICC stage IVA
revealed significant advantages for the liver transplant
patients (75 and 38% in the transplant group, 38 and 0%
in the resection, and 38 and 7% in the TACE group, P=
0.000009). In the resection group, survival was significantly
lower when patients had UICC stage III or IVA (P=0.0006).
Survival rates in the transplant group with UICC stage IVA
after 1 year and with UICC stage III and IVA after 5 years
was significantly lower than the remaining stages (P=0.007
and P=0.0031 for incidentalomas).
Stratification of the liver transplanted patients into Milan
Criteria (UICC stage I and II) or exceeding criteria showed
17 patients within and ten patients exceeding Milan
Criteria. One- and 5-year survival rates were 89 vs 62%
and 75 vs 62%, respectively, which showed a significant
advantage for patients being within Milan Criteria (P=
0.002). In the resection group, there was no significant
difference between groups (P=0.65). The data suggest that
in a group of patients with HCC exceeding Milan Criteria
may benefit from liver transplantation as compared with
primary resection in terms of 5-year survival.

Mortality rate after LTx and after primary tumour resection
Thirty-day mortality of the LTx group was 0%. One patient
died after 119 days in a septic shock. In the long term, three
further patients died without relation to HCC or transplantation (one with myocardial infarct in 34 months, one with
gastric bleeding in 9 months, one with esophageal cancer
in 30 months). In contrast, 30-day mortality rate of the
primary tumour resection group was 8.3% (3/36), and one
patient died on day 35 after resection. Among them, two
patients underwent a left hemihepatectomy, and additionally, one was combined with a pancreas head resection
(who died on day 17 from myocardic infarct and on day 35
from septic shock). Another two patients received an
extended right hemihepatectomy (who died on day 13 from
Cor pulmonale and on day 16 from pancreatitis).
LTx is superior to primary tumour resection in terms
of tumour-free survival
In the LTx group and resection group, which were
considered to be treated with curative intention, tumourfree survival after 1 and 5 years was 75 and 72% for
patients in the LTx group vs 50 and 11% in the resection
group (Fig. 2). Patients significantly benefited from liver
transplantation compared to primary resection in terms of
tumour-free survival (P=0.005). Stratification of the LTx
patients again into Milan Criteria or exceeding criteria
showed 17 patients within and ten patients exceeding
criteria. One- and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were
89 vs 62% and 75 vs 62%, respectively. This suggests a
significant advantage for patients being within Milan
Criteria in 1-year tumour-free survival (P=0.002), whereas
there was no significant difference in 5-year tumour-free
survival. In the resection group, there was no significant
difference between groups (P=0.65).
Discussion
Based on the present analysis of a single centre data, liver
transplantation represents the best curative approach in
the treatment of patients with HCC. Data on TACE show
1-year overall survival rates of 21% [9], 24% and 51% [10],
82% [8], and 57% [11] in comparison to 44% in our
collective data, which is consistent. Efficacy of TACE with
complete tumour response is 0–4.8%, and thus, very rare,
as variable tumour cells remain after the procedure.
Consequently, only patients with a stop in tumour progress
really do benefit from TACE in the long term. It can be
achieved by the LTx [12, 13]. Our data on surgical
resection show 77 and 32% in 1- and 5-year survival rates,
respectively, which comparable is with the data in literature
showing 1-year survival rate ranging from 44 to 100% and
5-year survival rate ranging from 32 to 93% [14–19]. Ikai
et al. [19] give different survival rates after resection in
dependence from tumour size. One- and 5-year survival
after resection of small HCC (2.1–5 cm in diameter) is 70
and 53% vs large HCC (5.1–10 cm in diameter) of 53 and
37%. In our collective UICC, stages II and III include
tumours of the same size, and survival rates after 1 and
5 years are 100 and 80% in stage II and 63 and 25% in
stage III. Finally, data on LTx are absolutely consistent with
our findings, and survival rates after 1 year ranging from 80
to 90% as compared to 95% in our series, and after 5 years
ranging from 61 to 75% as compared to 57% in our series
[1, 3, 6, 7, 20].
Patients may still benefit from LTx even if they suffer
from an HCC in an advanced stage. Our data show that
survival rates are significantly better within each single
UICC stage, in particular in advanced stages, for LTx than
for resection and TACE-treated patients. TACE can be an
adjuvant, rarely curative, therapeutic approach [21]. Patients
often receive TACE as a bridging therapy to LTx in our
centre. However, its role still has to be evaluated in a
randomised control trial. Nevertheless, TACE can be an
option of treatment for the patients being in the waiting list
to reduce the high mortality rate before they get an offer
for LTx.

Tumour-free survival in our LTx data containing all
UICC stages was 75 and 72% after 1 and 5 years, which is
significantly better than in the resection group. Stratification into Milan Criteria and exceeding criteria revealed
1- and 5-year tumour-free survival rates of 89 and 62%.
Data from literature show similar results in tumour-free
survival of approximately 90 and 70–80% after 1 and
5 years [6, 22]. Nevertheless, there are fine differences of
tumour-free survival within the LTx group. Pathohistology
of micro- and macroangioinvasive tumor growth decreased
overall and tumour-free survival in the LTx group significantly. This observation is consistent with data in literature.
Figueras et al. [23] showed macrovascular invasion to be an
independent risk factor for mortality and recurrence.
Actually, all ten patients in our series with angioinvasive
tumor growth had a significant drop in the median survival
and tumour-free survival. It may suggest that the vascular
invasion can still be a risk factor for the tumour recurrence
after transplantation.
Interestingly, the stratification of surgery proceeded
patients into Milan and exceeding criteria did not impact
the tumour-free survival, which can probably be explained
by remnants of tumour or additional non-detected tumour
nodes in cirrhotic tissue, which occasionally presents as
incidentalomas after LTx [24, 25]. In comparison to other
kinds of treatment, LTx remains the best therapeutic option
for HCC in our series.
The mortalities after primary tumour resection and after
LTx in our series are comparable. Outcome of primary
tumour resection depends on various factors. Patients with
impaired liver function (mainly suffering from cirrhosis
Child B-C) face the problem of the function of remaining
cirrhotic liver with potential risks of increasing mortality
and morbidity after the procedure. The treatment of choice
in non-cirrhotic patients remains resection, and it can be
performed with less life-threatening complications [8].
Indeed, two of three mortal cases within the first 30 days
after surgery in our series had cirrhosis. The surgical
refinement and standardisation of the procedure of LTx
may make it comparable to large liver resection in terms of
complications and mortality.
In conclusion, LTx can be a curative approach for HCC
patient in all tumour stages without extrahepatic metastases,
as compared to alternative conservative, interventional or
other surgical therapies. This concept should be further
proved by a prospective study. Based on the data of present
study, all HCC patients without extrahepatic metastases
could be potentially placed onto waiting lists for liver
transplantation. This will dramatically increase the organ
shortage. A refinement of selection criteria (or refinement
of extended Milan criteria) is currently needed to benefit all
patients with HCC or with end-stage liver diseases. Future
approaches to further improvement in overall and tumourfree survival in LTx patients with primary disease of HCC
should focus on two major subjects. First, due to organ
shortage, priority should be given to patients within Milan
criteria vs those exceeding criteria in the same MELD
score. Second, individualisation of immunosuppression in
patients with HCC is recommended. As the commonly used
immunosuppressant drugs, like calcineurin inhibitors, have
potential disadvantages in the prevention of tumour
recurrence, there is a requirement for substances that can
provide adequate immunosuppressive effects and can
suppress tumour recurrence in the recipient. A group of
mTOR inhibitors are likely to have this potential, but their
probable and singularly observed beneficial effect on the
recurrence of HCC after LTx must be evaluated in a
prospectively randomised study.
